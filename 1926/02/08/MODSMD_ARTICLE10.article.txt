# ARIZONA PRESIDENT IS SURPRISED WITH STANFORD'S GROWTH
## 
### 
"The improvement of education in
American universities," declared Dr.
Cloyd H. Marvin, president of the
University of Arizona, in an interview
yesterday, "must rest on three funda
mental steps. The first of these will
be the raising of the salaries offered
to professors to a point high enough
that the colleges can command out
standing men in all fields.
The second step will be in more
closely selecting the students who will
study under these high grade men.
The college will have to ask the stu
dent, directly, if he is a good enough
man to merit a course under a $20,000
a year instructor. In the third case,
the tenure system should be changed
to give the universities free right to
eliminate men who are not fully com
petent."
Yesterday was the first time Presi
dent Marvin has been on the Stanford
campus since 1917. "I was everywhere
impressed," he commented, "by the
remarkable growth of Stanford. There
is no use in talking about your good
old days; the good old days are right
here now."
President Marvin is in San Fran
cisco at the present time as one of
a picked group of twenty-four West
ern educators who are meeting under
the auspices of the Carnegie Founda
tion for Adult Education. While on
the campus he was a guest of the local
chapter of the Delta Chi Fraternity,
of which he is a member. Dr. Marvin
graduated from Stanford in 1912.
