# WATER POLO MATCH WITH CALIFORNIA IS DELAYED ONE WEEK
## Bears Request Postponement Of Game Because of Poor Condition 
### 
The date for the Stanford-California
varsity and freshman water polo
! games has been postponed from Feb
! ruary 13 to either February 18 or 19.
j The change has been made by Ernst
1 Brandsten, coach of swimming and
| water polo, in response to a request
i from the Berkeley coach who stated
j that his men could not possibly get
j into good enough condition to give
: Stanford any sort of competition by
I the original date, California having
started practice only the beginning
j of this month.
The delay will probably be valuable
to the Cardinal as well as the Blue
and Gold teams, for the Stanford
players can make good use of the
extra week in perfecting their game
J and developing smoother and more
efficient teamwork. None of the men
are sufficiently on edge to be at a
point where there is any danger that
j they will become stale or over-trained
from the added work.
Practice Daily
Frosh and varsity players have been
working out daily, including Saturday
mornings, at the Encina pool, perfect
j ing handling of the ball and dribbling,
| with a full-length game each time. In
i the varsity seven the most noticeable
change has been the improvement of
i the players in the backfield lineup
j around whom many of the plays will
; be built. They are being relied upon
j by Coach Brandsten to shoot as many
| goals in the game as the forwai'ds.
Arden Allen, captain, and Bob Wil
liams, a veteran from last year's team,
together with Ken Graham, will make
up the backfield. During the last few
workouts Allen and Williams, both
j among the fastest sprinters on the
swimming team, have improved their
i dribbling.
Forward Line
Stanford's varsity team will be a
1 reversal of the conventional system
of fast men forward and slow swim
| mers in the backfield. The forward
lineup, which will consist of Van den
| Akker, center forward, Art Stewart,
i and either Johnny Mack or Phil
; Brooks, will be only moderately
I speedy, while two of the backs, Allen
and Williams in the guard positions,
are fast in any company of swimmers.
Ward Poulsen has been playing goal
i guard and has shown ability to guess
where the ball is going to come and
i judgment in placing it out for his own
j team .
