# WATSON DRAWINGS AT STANFORD FOR ONE MORE WEEK
## 
### 
The collection of sculptures and
paintings displayed by the Society of
Famous American Women has been
removed from the Art Gallery, and a
new exhibit will take its place this
week.
The exhibit of charcoal drawings
and block prints by Ernest W. Watson
of Brooklyn, New York, will remain
for another week, as will the work
done by the Minneapolis school chil
dren. This contains many interesting
pieces, and has a group of exceedingly
bright and colorful posters, which de
pict the different customs of the vari
ous countries of the world. Junior
high school pupils have made posters
describing the Norse-American Cen
tennial. Silhouette and chalk draw
ings also come in for their share of
praise.
Art work done by pupils from the
grades of one through twelve are
shown, with an explanation of the
purpose of the work in various grades,
demonstrating the interpretation of
language through art. The aim
throughout all the work is to increase
the pupil's power of graphic expres
sion in terms of drawing and design.
