# STUDENTS AT U. C. START PETITION TO ESTABLISH RECALL
## 
### 
University of California students
have formed a special committee to
circulate a petition asking for an
amendment to the constitution of the
Associated Students that 'will provide
for a recall election at any time. With
in three hours after the committee
started its campaign 300 names had
been added to the list of petitioners.
This amendment is sought as a re
sult of the recent turmoil between
student organizations and the execu
tive committee. At the present time
a recall election can be held only
twice a year at the semi-annual meet
ings of the A.S.U.C,
"We feel that the executive com
mittee is not representative of the
student body and that in the past its
members have been autocratic in
handling the affairs of the student
government," says J. Elwood Squires,
chairman of the special petition com
mittee. "Our petition is not aimed at
any particular person. What we de
sire is recall provisions that may be
held as a threat at all Mines in the
future."
