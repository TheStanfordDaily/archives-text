# An Hour With Our Critics
## 
### 
Last night we were among the uninvited guests at a discussion of the
"Causes, Consequences, and Cures of the Daily Palo Alto" conducted by
the Canterbury club of the First Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto. The
advance reports of the affair caused mirth about the Daily office; so we
went to hear the editors take a beating, and to find out how unjustly the
Daily was treating everyone and everything.
We were disappointed. No one in the whole group accused us of being
rascals; no one appeared with our effigy to burn; no one wanted to meet
us in hand to hand combat. Instead the group was wondering about the
whys and wherefores of the Daily's policy. It was open to conviction.
The members of the club thought some mistakes had been made and that
some organizations had been slighted. We tried to explain the underlying
reasons why certain things had been done and certain steps taken. Per
haps, a better understanding was created. We hope so.
But, we learned something from the discussion last night. The criti
cism being received by the Daily is largely upon matters which can easily
be explained to the disgruntled to their satisfaction. Since the Daily is a
student newspaper, published by and for the students, we feel that we owe
s duty to them to give reasonable weight to their ideas. Hence, we ap
preciate criticism, especially when it comes without malice, and suggest
that students who feel the Daily is deficient in some respect drop around
to the office with their suggestions for improvement. The editors always
have reasons for doing things in a particular way, and perhaps the average
student would not be so apt to complain, if he would first obtain first hand
information from the editors as to their motives.
