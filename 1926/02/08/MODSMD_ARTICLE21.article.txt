Dispatches from the east yesterday stated that the National Profes
sional Football association had declared itself opposed to signing up college
stars l>efore they finish their senior college year, and has instructed its
members accordingly. This is a praiseworthy step, and one in the di
rection of that urged by the Daily Polo Alto at the time "Red" Grange left
Illinois for the professional gridiron.
After witnessing Grange and his Chicago Bears play good, bad, in
different, and dirty football in San Francisco a few weeks ago we relaxed
a bit, feeling confident that professional football would never be able to
surpass the college game in popularity. And that opinion is made more
certain with the announcement of the co-operative action taken by the
professional association. Since organized professional teams cannot now
sign college players until the term ends the days of big, over-paid stars
given excessive publicity because the rah-rah of their last college victory
has not died out, will be virtually over. Professional football will become
a conservative, business proposition and will not detract from the college
sport while it is earning reasonable returns for its promoters. At least
this is true if the association is able to exercise control over professional
football.
