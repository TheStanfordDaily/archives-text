# Nice Going, Boys

Coach Andy Kerr and fourteen members of the Stanford basketball
team arrived home this morning after a brilliant three game series in
Los Angeles. The Redshirts played sensational basketball throughout,
caging baskets when baskets were needed, and snatching victory out of the
hands of the two opponents when all hope seemed gone. The blot of the
early season defeat by Southern Branch was completely erased, and
U.S.C.'s cellar claim was substantiated beyond all doubt.
The southern papers were loud in their praise of Coach Kerr's strategy,
and the success of the player's efforts is sufficient praise in itself for them.
The team had plenty of fight and all the condition in the world or it
couldn't have come back in an extra period after the third game to ring up
a top-heavy score. That rally after a gruelling three days should be a
source of satisfaction to the students as well as to Coach Kerr.
And, after trampling over the Wolf-pack this week we will sit back
and confidently await the results of the two remaining California games.
