# SPORTS OF 1926
## The
						Court Painter 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"I am going abroad on a pleasure trip—l expect to
study art, to see sights, and to play in tennis tournaments."
Thus quoth the fair Helen of Berkeley, California, as she
sailed from New York the first week in January for La
Belle France. I submit an imaginary picture of Miss
Wills, the art student, completing her first painting while
at the Riviera.
But don't get the idea that Our Helen (who seems to
have taken Mary Pickford's place as "America's Sweet
heart") would poke fun at any of her rivals. She will poke
plenty of tennis balls at them —long, hard-hit drives that
go skimming over the net and hugging the side-lines —but
she's far too good a sport ever to draw a comic valentine
of the Jeanne D'Arc of French tennis — even if she'd like to.
The Carlton Cup tournament starts today on the
Riviera, and if both Miss Wills and Mile. Lenglen play,

let's hope they meet —have a wonderful match —and that Helen makes
Suzanne look like thirty sous. Then maybe the press dispatches would cease
the reports of "cool nods," so-called catty remarks, and, above all, the "Apple
preen gown worn by Miss Wills" and the "Cote D'Azur worn by Mile. Lenglen."
Are they tennis players or cloak models?
One can't help thinking that the artistic endeavors of Our Helen, if they
lead to too quick a monetary gain to her tennis fame, may cause the esteemed
U.S.L.T.A. to pass a "player-painter" rule to cover all artists and models who
draw the tournaments in which they play. Miss Wills has already sold a page
of tennis drawings to Vanity Fair. Is the pencil mightier than the racquet?
FEG MURRAY SAYS—
A Florida landlady reported that the new boarder at her house
was Jack Dempsey. However, it proved to be only an idle roomer.
