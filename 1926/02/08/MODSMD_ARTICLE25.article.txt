### Monroe Eaton Letitia Lemon 
Episode 111
Summary of Episode II: Letitia
meets alias John Smith in unclean
circumstances.
I Am Pursued
I relate the following experience to
show the constant danger under which
i a good girl lives at college. (Must I
repeat that I was a good girl when j
I came to college?)
There is a class of men at the unl
; versity I attended (too well known
| to mention) that make it their busi-
I ness to bother women. (Some of my
experiences with these men were very
illuminating but they must be rele
gated to later episodes). The man of
whom I am about to tell, however, be
longed to the opposite class; he wore
knickers.
I was walking to my morning class
from the hall where I lived (for the |
first month), when I heard footsteps
behind me. I did not look to see who
it was at first, thinking that they
would presently go in some other di
rection. But still I heard the footsteps
behind me, never gaining, never re
ceding.
Finally as I turned a corner I looked
behind to see who was following me
so closely. As I looked I felt immedi- j
ate and instinctive repulsion toward
the person I saw. As I mentioned be
fore he wore knickers. He was rather j
short and lightly put together. 1-Ie
walked with a somewhat nonchalant'
air, and his eyes were fastened in- 1
tently upon me. His pale face was |
made to seem all the more palid by
contrast with the black tortoise shell
rims of a huge pair of spectacles, and
the glaring brilliance of his almost j
orange-colored hair. A second later I
turned into the door of my classroom
and he walked past, his eyes still fixed
upon me.

Summary of Episode II: Letitia
meets alias John Smith in unclean
circumstances.
I Am Pursued
I relate the following experience to
show the constant danger under which
i a good girl lives at college. (Must I
repeat that I was a good girl when j
I came to college?)
There is a class of men at the unl
; versity I attended (too well known
| to mention) that make it their busi-
I ness to bother women. (Some of my
experiences with these men were very
illuminating but they must be rele
gated to later episodes). The man of
whom I am about to tell, however, be
longed to the opposite class; he wore
knickers.
I was walking to my morning class
from the hall where I lived (for the |
first month), when I heard footsteps
behind me. I did not look to see who
it was at first, thinking that they
would presently go in some other di
rection. But still I heard the footsteps
behind me, never gaining, never re
ceding.
Finally as I turned a corner I looked
behind to see who was following me
so closely. As I looked I felt immedi- j
ate and instinctive repulsion toward
the person I saw. As I mentioned be
fore he wore knickers. He was rather j
short and lightly put together. 1-Ie
walked with a somewhat nonchalant'
air, and his eyes were fastened in- 1
tently upon me. His pale face was |
made to seem all the more palid by
contrast with the black tortoise shell
rims of a huge pair of spectacles, and
the glaring brilliance of his almost j
orange-colored hair. A second later I
turned into the door of my classroom
and he walked past, his eyes still fixed
