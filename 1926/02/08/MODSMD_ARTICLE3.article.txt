# WEDNESDAY SET AS DEADLINE FOR POINT SYSTEM SUGGESTIONS
## Special Women's Election to Take Place Last of This Month 
### 
Individual study of the proposed
plans for the point system by every
woman is necessary in order that it
be a truly representative system of
regulation. As Wednesday is the dead
line set by the committee to receive
suggestions and corrections, all wo
men f are urged to make an effort to
understand its workings in order to
vote correctly when the Quad election
occurs the last of the month.
Freshmen and sophomores will be
especially affected by the regulations
if the plans are approved.
The prospect of a point system is
an innovation in the University with
which every woman is concerned.
Criticism will have no effect after
Wednesday.
All the campus offices open to wo
men have been arranged in five groups,
first, in respect to their prestige, and,
second, according to the amount of
time necessary to fill the offices effi
ciently. Each group has its restric
tions, and the point system records
committee, which will be appointed
by the president of Associated Wo
men's Students, will take charge of
the official working out of the regu
lations. If this system is put into ef
fect each woman's work will be ar
ranged in accordance with the rules,
and thus a small group of women will
be prevented from being overbur
dened with two much outside activity.
The complete grouping of the pro
posed point system of the Associated
Women will be found on page four
of today's paper.
