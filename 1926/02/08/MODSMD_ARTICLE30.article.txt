# PAST, PRESENT ART EDUCATION RELATED BY ARTHUR CLARK
## 
### 
Editor's Note: The following
story is written by Arthur B.
Clark, professor of education, who
will leave soon for New York to
attend a meeting of the Federated
Council on Art Education. Profes
sor Clark is president of the Pa
cific Arts Association.
Art education was once an "extra."
The mothers of some of the oldest of |
us took lessons in "crayon drawing"
and copied certain stirring pictures
from copies which the drawing teacher
had copied from her teacher. These
included the portrait of a horse's head
and much-curved neck. "A Stag at
Bay" was another, and "The Ruins of
Carthage." A search through attic
chests will discover some of these.
As a contrast in showing the present,
day understanding of what art is, one
may notice the program of the Pacific
Arts Association which is to hold its
annual convention in Los Angeles in
March, on the 18th, 19th, and 20th.
This "P.A.A.," as it is called, draws
its membership from seven states, its
three-day program, with three to four
sessions each day, contains fifty-five
speakers. The California State Board
of Elucation recognizes its importance
fcy designating it as a State Conference
and so authorizes leaves of absence
for attendance of art teachers without
loss of salary.
Student Exhibits
The exhibits will include typical stu
dent work in representation and poster
art; also in design and its application
to costume, furniture, house-building
and yard-planting; also works in crafts
of metal, wood, and textiles; and a sec
tion devoted to the art work of
teachers.
Among the addresses are included
such topics as: pageantry, landscape
architecture, appreciation of architec
ture, the relation of period furniture
to the modern home, shopping in Eu
rope for appreciation classes in Cali
fornia, art of the theatre, visit to a
motion picture studio, a play by the
Community Players of Pasadena, the
contribution of modern art to dress,
costume designing for motion pictures,
and the Paris Industrial Exposition.
Various phases of art teaching are
dealt with in three separate round
table discussions representing elemen
tary, high school, and university art
instruction.
Lectures Planned
The speakers on these various topics
are masters of their subjects, a profes
sional landscape architect, Lasky's cos
tume designer, the chief designer of
Los Angeles' largest department store,
Barkers Brothers' chief interior deco
rator, the director of the Pasadena
Community Players, and supervisors
of art education who have art a living
topic in the large city schools by at
least a dozen.
Requirements in the training of the
art teacher; credit in art for college
entrance; the proper sequence in art
training, in grades, high school, and
college; art schools, their methods,
content, standards, etc.; minimum es
sentials in all school grades; are spe
cific topics among others which will
be discussed and reported on at the
coming meeting.
The activities of these two large art
organizations show the needs and in
terests of everyday life. It becomes
a mental attitude which, like literary
and social instincts, functions continu
ally and unconsciously. And what a
contrast with the remotely-related,
Mid-Victorian, parlor-curiosity art of
our grandmothers.

Community Players, and supervisors
of art education who have art a living
topic in the large city schools by at
least a dozen.
Requirements in the training of the
art teacher; credit in art for college
entrance; the proper sequence in art
training, in grades, high school, and
college; art schools, their methods,
content, standards, etc.; minimum es
sentials in all school grades; are spe
cific topics among others which will
be discussed and reported on at the
coming meeting.
The activities of these two large art
organizations show the needs and in
terests of everyday life. It becomes
a mental attitude which, like literary
and social instincts, functions continu
ally and unconsciously. And what a
contrast with the remotely-related,
Mid-Victorian, parlor-curiosity art of
our grandmothers.
Editor's Note: The following
story is written by Arthur B.
Clark, professor of education, who
will leave soon for New York to
attend a meeting of the Federated
Council on Art Education. Profes
sor Clark is president of the Pa
cific Arts Association.
Art education was once an "extra."
The mothers of some of the oldest of |
us took lessons in "crayon drawing"
and copied certain stirring pictures
from copies which the drawing teacher
had copied from her teacher. These
included the portrait of a horse's head
and much-curved neck. "A Stag at
Bay" was another, and "The Ruins of
Carthage." A search through attic
chests will discover some of these.
As a contrast in showing the present,
day understanding of what art is, one
may notice the program of the Pacific
Arts Association which is to hold its
annual convention in Los Angeles in
March, on the 18th, 19th, and 20th.
This "P.A.A.," as it is called, draws
its membership from seven states, its
three-day program, with three to four
sessions each day, contains fifty-five
speakers. The California State Board
of Elucation recognizes its importance
fcy designating it as a State Conference
and so authorizes leaves of absence
for attendance of art teachers without
loss of salary.
Student Exhibits
The exhibits will include typical stu
dent work in representation and poster
art; also in design and its application
to costume, furniture, house-building
and yard-planting; also works in crafts
of metal, wood, and textiles; and a sec
tion devoted to the art work of
teachers.
Among the addresses are included
such topics as: pageantry, landscape
architecture, appreciation of architec
ture, the relation of period furniture
to the modern home, shopping in Eu
rope for appreciation classes in Cali
fornia, art of the theatre, visit to a
motion picture studio, a play by the
Community Players of Pasadena, the
contribution of modern art to dress,
costume designing for motion pictures,
and the Paris Industrial Exposition.
Various phases of art teaching are
dealt with in three separate round
table discussions representing elemen
tary, high school, and university art
instruction.
Lectures Planned
The speakers on these various topics
are masters of their subjects, a profes
sional landscape architect, Lasky's cos
tume designer, the chief designer of
Los Angeles' largest department store,
Barkers Brothers' chief interior deco
rator, the director of the Pasadena
Community Players, and supervisors
of art education who have art a living
