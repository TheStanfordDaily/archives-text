# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Is there anything we can do abo
the condition of the paths around t
campus? I wonder if the administi
tion cares how much mud is tracks
into the halls and the classroom
When the ground is dry we can wa
anywhere, but during this wet weath
there isn't a path that is fit to wa
on. Around Toyon and Branner t!

walks are thick with mud and water,.
We can't go from our rooms to mealsi
without wading through muddy paths..
From Encina to the Library or the;
Engineering corner, the field we have
to cross is almost a swamp in places.
I realize there are a great many
things the administration has to look
after, but even at that, can't we have
a few good walks which will remain
partially dry throughout the year.

The Editor, Sir:
It is impossible for me to resist the
temptation of writing (his 4'View
point," principally because I share it
with most of the audience which was
present at the showing of "Siegrfried"
in the Assembly hall Wednesday eve
ning.
The Dramatic Council deserves i
praise for getting so worthy a picture I
for the Stanford audience; but it was 1
certainly not a praiseworthy act to
use but one projector in its presenta
tion. The awkward waits in the semi
darkness spoiled the whole effect of
the picture, and it lies, in my mind at
least, as a series of pretty scenes in
terspersed with moments of acute eye
strain trying to determine whether the
girl in Row J really was pretty, or
whether it was just the way the light
struck her.
Most of us remember the time when
we paid our nickel and wandered
trustfully into the "Elite" or the
"Ilijou" for the two-reol Westerns.
Most of us remember that, between
reels, the whirring projector stopped,
the house lights came on, and we
scuttled busily about under the chairs
searching for the lost peaiiut. while
the operator painfully changed the
film. We didn't expect any better in
1910.
The Stanford Dramatic Council still
has the 1910 idea of projection. If they
cannot, because of technical difficul
ties. install another machine, they
should emulate those theaters which
once dotted the side streets of town
and city: go out of business. One or
two further attempts such as that of
Wednesday evening, and they prob
i ably will. —H. M.
