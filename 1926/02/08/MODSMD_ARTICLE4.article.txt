# VALENTINE NUMBER OF CHAPARRAL TO APPEAR ON FRIDAY
## 
### 
The advent of St. Valentine's Day
on the forthcoming Sabbath will be
officially recognized by Hammer ana
Coffin Society in the appearance of
the Valentine Number of Chaparral,
which will be placed on sale on the
Quad Friday morning. Selling will be
done by the freshman women, which
will definitely insure the fact that
there will be at least one hundred
copies of the issue in each sorority
house, while the other places of resi
dences on the campus are expected
also to do right by the newer com
ponents of the Five Hundred.
When traced to his laid today by a
persistent reporter from the Daily, the
Old Boy was loathe to give out any
statement for publication regarding
the Valentine Number. He did state
definitely, however, that the issue
would abound in good clean fun, and
would contain almost every known
old-time Valentine joke, together with
one or two new ones created espe
cially for the occasion. When pressed,
he declared that one of the best of
these was receiving a Valentine from
a freshman woman and at the same
time being separated from thirty
cents. "Hut no one will care," he ob
served, "for Love is blind, so no one
will see what is being handed out in
return for the money."
