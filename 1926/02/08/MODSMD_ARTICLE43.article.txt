# LAFAYETTE ALLOWS STUDENTS TWENTY CUTS A SEMESTER
## 
### 
Lafayette University authorities
have found that their system of grant
ing cuts has failed. Forty-two thou
sand euts have been taken by the
students during the last year, or an
average of slightly less than forty cuts
to a man.
Each man is allowed twenty cuts,
and most of the students have taken
advantage of this rule to allow them
selves vacations during the school
year. Anyone taking more than the
twenty allowed cuts loses his registra
tiirtt, no matter what his excuse.
The unfairness of this rule and the
large number of times Lafayette stu
dents cut their classes have led the
faculty to consider revising the sys
tem. It has been suggested that the
professors be allowed to make their
own rules as to the number of cuts
allowed in their courses, such as Stan
ford instructors do.
Honor students at Lafayette are
now followed voluntary attendance to
classes, but this does not mean that
the whole student body would ever
have that privilege. In fact, the atti
tude of the students points towards
more restriction than there is now.
