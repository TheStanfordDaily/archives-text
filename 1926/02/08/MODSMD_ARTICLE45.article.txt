# MAN'S REJECTION OF KEY FAILS TO WORRY PHI BETES
## 
### 
The refusal of Floyd Simonton, stu
dent at the University of Kansas, to
accept a Phi Beta Kappa key, be
cause he considered the prevalent sys
tem of grading a false criterion of
scholarship, occasioned a letter from
Oscar Voorhees, Secretary of the so
ciety, in which he stated that Phi Beta
Kappa members were not worried be
cause of this action.
"In the last three years," said Mr.
Voorhees, "only three students have
declined to accept membership in Phi
Beta Kappa. Two of these were wo
men; the last, Mr. Simonton. During
the same period we have had about
6000 acceptances, hence the declina
tions do not bulk very large, and we
are not at all worried.
"I wrote at the time to the two
young ladies and found that both of
them declined under a misapprehen
sion, and I judge, if the newspaper
report is correct, that the same is
true respecting Mr. Simonton.
"Phi Beta Kappa does not claim
that grades are the final test of schol
arship. It does not believe, however,
that men and women who are in col
lege cannot claim to have made good
use of their opportunities unless their
work secures some recognition on the
part of the faculty. Nor does Phi Beta
Kappa base its elections entirely upon
grades. The theory prevails that these
must be supplemented by good moral
character and such interest in the
affairs of the institution as to indicate
a wide sympathy with the best things
in education. It may be that in some
cases those who are administering the
affairs of the chapters are not as care
ful as they might be to appraise these
other qualifications. The fact that
these are in our theory of elections
should be recognized.
"It is a very simple matter, of
course, for a young man to manifest
a supercilious attitude toward Phi
Beta Kappa. That can only be the
case when he fails to appreciate the
serious purpose of the organization, its
remarkable history, and the great num
ber of distinguished men and women
in other generations as well as in our
own who count it an honor to be
members. You can readily see that we
do not worry at all when they take
this attitude. Phi Beta Kappa will not
miss them. They will miss an asso
ciation which might be exceedingly
helpful and consequently they are the
only losers."

should be recognized.
"It is a very simple matter, of
course, for a young man to manifest
a supercilious attitude toward Phi
Beta Kappa. That can only be the
case when he fails to appreciate the
serious purpose of the organization, its
remarkable history, and the great num
ber of distinguished men and women
in other generations as well as in our
own who count it an honor to be
members. You can readily see that we
do not worry at all when they take
this attitude. Phi Beta Kappa will not
miss them. They will miss an asso
ciation which might be exceedingly
helpful and consequently they are the
only losers."
