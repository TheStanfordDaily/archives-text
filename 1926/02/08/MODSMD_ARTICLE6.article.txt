# ROVER BOYS WILL ARRIVE ON CAMPUS FOR LIMITED STAY
## 
### 
Careworn, dusty, and travel
stained, but bubbling over with
good, clean fun, the Rover boys
will arrive on the campus tomor
row at noon for a limited stay
in fulfillment of their contract
with Ram's Head Society. They
have promised to appear person
ally in the show which is being
given next Friday and Saturday.
Tom, Dick, and Sam are com
ing from Petaluma tomorrow
morning where they have been
feted by the Chamber of Com
merce and several other august
bodies. They were chosen judges
of a fowl show on the strength
of their experiences with chick
ens in college. The annual egg
throwing contest was won by
Tom, who accredits all his skill
to the grand old art of bull
throwing which he learned at the
loss of many hours of sleep and
the consumption of a great deal
of midnight oil (mostly fusel).
The Band, with brassy blares
of glee, will proclaim the arrival
of the Rover limousine and lead
the huge parade which will be
in waiting at the English corner
to give the boys a welcome be
fitting their exalted state.
