Encina 3E won its second straight
victory in rapid fashion in a hard-j
fought intramural basketball contest j
played Friday afternoon with the Phi
Sigma Kappa team. The score was 24
to 6. The Row live, after holding the
freshmen to a small lead during the !
first half, were completely routed in
the second period and were unable to
score while their opponents ran up
thirteen points. The Delta Tau Delta
quintet easily downed the Sigma Nu
team by a 19 to 3 score in the other
scheduled tilt.
Encina 3E used the man-in-the-hole
offensive with great success against
the Phi Sig squad. Thomason played
in the hole and every time the stand-1
ing guard was watching Jiim too!
closely he would pass to Smalling who
made good a large share of his shots.
Several times the Row team was com
pletely fooled by this strategy.
Freshmen Lead
By the end of the first half the 1
freshman five had a lead of 11-6 due !
almost entirely to Smalling's shooting. !
He made ten points, while Hayes, i
standing guard, shot a foul for the J
other tally. Hawkins made two diffi
cult baskets and Bryant made two!
scores for the Phi Sigs. Smalling
started the second half well with a
short shot, and Thomason sank two I
more, giving them an eleven-point 1
lead. After a few minutes of scoreless j
playing during which time the ball i
was under the fraternity team's goal
most of the time, Smalling scored j
three more points and Zombro sank a
short shot and another from the side- 1
lines to end the Encina team's scoring.
Sigma Nu Loses
During the first half everyone but
the standing guard took part in Delta j
Tau Delta's scoring; Morrison and
