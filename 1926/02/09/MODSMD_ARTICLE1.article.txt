# VARSITY NINE SET FOR CLASH WITH OLYMPIC CLUB
## GAME HERE SATURDAY Oviatt Will Start Tilt as Pitcher; Sypher Takes Catcher's Position 
### 
Coach Harry varsity base
ball team will meet the Olympic Club
aggregation on the varsity field at 3
o'clock Saturday afternoon in the first
practice game of the quarter.
The San Francisco Police Club game
scheduled for tomorrow was called
off this morning.
Wolter plans to start the game with
Tod Oviatt pitching and Sypher catch
ing. Oviatt has been showing great
form lately along with the other var
sity pitchers. From present Indica
tions competition for every one of the
positions on the nine will be keener
this year than for some years past.
There are three or four men of first
class calibre competing for each berth.
The rest of the infield for the game
with the clubmen will be as follows:
Johnston, first base; Garibaldi, sec
ond base; Cuddeback, third base;
Bush, shortstop. The outfield has not
yet been decided upon.
If the team plays tomorrow in the
same form it has shown in practice so
far there will probably be some real
batting exhibited for there is a col
lection of heavy and frequent hitters
on the team. Johnston, Weaver, Gari
baldi, and McGuire are some of the
outstanding sluggers on the squad.
The loss of Ernie Nevers in the
pitching line will be felt, but not seri
ously. Oviatt and Philippi have both
been twirling a nifty brand of ball.
Sobieski and Reynolds, both of last
year's freshman team, have improved
so much in the past few weeks that
they are keeping the other two men
on edge.
Practice was held yesterday with a
five-inning game between the frosh
team and a second varsity team, fol
lowed by a game between varsity
nines. The freshmen showed class in
•defeating their opponents. Lewis, at
pitcher's position, Harder at third, and
Rogers at short, played stellar games
for the first-year men.
