# Y.W.C.A. PLANS OPEN MEETING TO EXPLAIN ASSOCIATION WORK
## 
### 
Senior, sophomore, and freshman
cabinets of the Y.W.C.A. will hold an
open meeting and forum tonight to
which all women interested in the
work of the organization are invited.
The meting will be at 7:15 o'clock in
Isabel Capps' office in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Emelita Cohen, high school Girl Re
serve secretary in San Francisco, will
speak on "Girl Reserves as a Profes
sion." The Girl Reserve movement is
the organization sponsored by the
Y.W.C.A. for girls of high school age,
and is international in its scope. Clubs
are organized by secretaries especially
trained for the work. The secretaries
must, among certain other qualifica
tions, be college graduates.
Since the student Y.W.C.A. is only
one section of the world-wide Y.W.C.A.
efforts are being made to acquaint the
members of the student body with the
other phases of the work. The meeting
tonight is a step in that direction. It
will take the place of the regular
forum for February. Miss Cohen is
visiting the student secretary for sev
eral days, and will be present at the
Advisory Board supper tonight and at
a Freshman Cabinet picnic tomorrow
at Lagunita.
