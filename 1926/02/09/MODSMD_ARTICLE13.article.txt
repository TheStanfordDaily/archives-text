# EXPERIENCED CARD BOXERS WILL MEET CALIFORNIA AGGIES
## Captain Schall, Arthur, Miron, Collins Mainstays in Bouts Saturday 
### 
Four veterans of Stanford-California
Aggie bouts last year will represent
the Cardinal in the first of the match-1
es which will be held at the Davis
Farm next Saturday. Led by Captain
Myron Schall, who has never lost a j
middleweight bout while in collegiate
competition, Stanford boxers should
again give the Aggies several close
and interesting bouts in the matches
between the two institutions.
Collins, diminutive bantamweight, j
will again fight in this division. Al
though losing twice to the 1925 Davis
captain, Mihle, Pacific Coast intercol
legiate champion, Collins' experience
from last year's bouts should make
him a strong contender for the title
this year.
Carlos Miron, featherweight, is one
of the best boxers of the Stanford
team. Shifty, possessed of clever foot
work, and having a hard and fast
punch, he can be counted on to give
his opponent a battle. Jim Arthur, the
fourth Cardinal veteran, has been
selected as the Cardinal heavyweight.
Harry Stevenson, a find of the an
nual novice tournament, is the wel
terweight contender by virtue of his
win over Bob Keerl in the finals of
the tournament. Fain, a sophomore,
will be the Stanford man in the light
heavyweight division, while Cold
j water, winner of the novice light
| weight championship, will represent
| Stanford in this class.
A return match with the Aggies will
be held at Stanford February 26, while
bouts with the Olympic Club have
; been arranged for March 5 by Homer
j Dombaugh, boxing manager.
