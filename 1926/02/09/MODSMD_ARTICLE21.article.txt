Today marks the end of this editorial regime. Tomorrow the Daily
will pass into the hands of John N. Levi, who will inherit a capable staff,
an experienced group of department editors, and an editorial column that
has not been torn by campus disputes for some weeks.
The present editor regrets that his task has been completed. He had
hoped to accomplish certain things. A few of his ideas have become
realities ; but in most things he has failed —in a few instances it is best that
he did—and in others he still believes that his ideas were the right ones,
even though the authorities were all the other way.
One thing of lasting duration has been accomplished during the past
term. The Daily Palo Alto has been enlarged in size from six to seven
columns. That step, we hope, will be only one in a stream of steady
progress for the Daily. The next should be to a morning paper; then we
hope for further enlarging to enable the Daily to carry telegraph reports.
Other policies advocated during the quarter have met with little per
manent success. Our one political venture failed; professional football,
the sponsor system, freshman discipline, and the decadence of traditions
had their editorial fling—and resulted in little, if any, actual change.
Perhaps we made a few people think, to take the problem a little seriously.
If we did, it is enough.
The outgoing editor has neither love nor regard for the present system
for control over freshmen nor for its consequences—the forgetting of
splendid traditions. All he was able to do was to create a furor, only to
have it subside when final examinations took the stage. Perhaps we have
paved the way for changes in the somewhat distant future. It is at least
our hope.
And as we turn the editorial column over to our successors we find
ourselves agreeing with that serious, reflective Persian, Omar Khayyam:
"When you and I behind the veil are passed,
Oh. but the long, long while the world shall last,
Which of our coming and departure heeds
As much as ocean of a pebble cast."
We are writing today; tomorrow the campus will go along unheeding
and forgetful of the tempests and dissentions that rocked the students
yesterday. It is well.
The editor has been accused of excessive fault finding. He has been
accused of doing nothing but declaring that the University individually
and collectively was going to hell, either across lots or in a roundabout way.
He hastens to correct that opinion. The discussions have been upon the
little, immaterial things. We have never suggested a change in a problem
of major importance. Stanford is being guided to its place in the sun by
a conscientious Board of Trustees and by a far-sighted and brilliant presi
dent. Under their leadership we see Stanford becoming the greatest insti
tution in the West and one ranking equally with the one great university
of the East.
And now that the swan song is about sung we will gather our papers
and notes from the office and turn over the editorial sanction to the man
who has been chosen to watch over the Daily Palo Alio for the next few
months. We know he will do a good job of it, and we are pleased to step
aside that he may have his sway.
And having spent the best part of four years around the Daily office
we shall leave and begin a search for the friends of our freshman year.
We are sure to find that most of them, at least the older ones, are missing.
(The University has served them and they have gone their way. We will
do likewise within a short time. And once more we will look to Omar for
solace before we follow in their footsteps:
"For some we loved, the loveliest and the l>est
, That from his vintage rolling Time hath pressed,
Have drunk their cup a round or two before
And one by one crept silently to rest."
Tamam.
