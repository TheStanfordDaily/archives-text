## "NOCTUPIN" 
### Monroe Eaton 
If I but knew the words to speak
To make love blush against your j
cheek —
Then, if I'd tell what's deeply hidden i
You'd make reply, "Now, quit your
kiddin'."
And if I'd whisper sweet and low
To tell you what you ought to kno\f — |
But then, if I should speak, you'd say (
To me, "How do you get that way?"
If I should murmur "I've a hunch
You'd better be my honey bunch," i
You'd turn your blue eyes up to mine, |
And say, "Oh, heavens, what line!"
I guess I'm glad that I don't care
To spill to you such gushy flare!
For then, if I should try to tell
I know what you would say—oh, well!

TODAY'S BEST SPORT—Sitting in
the Reserve Book Room and watching
one student after another wildly at
tempt to push open the door marked
"Enter," which was locked tight.
P.S.: You can't appreciate the great
fun in this sport unless you start by
getting fooled yourself.

Now that there is water in the lake
the biology classes can expect to saw
up frogs ad infinitum, ad nauseum.
