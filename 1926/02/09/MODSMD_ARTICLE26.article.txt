# Those Were the Good Old Days.

### 
If we are to take this poem, from
Harper's Bazaar of February 1880, lit
erally, life is no longer worth while,
not even on the Stanford Campus:
Winsome young witches of supple
sixteen,
Pouting young puppets of nine;
Vain little virgins In brown velveteen,'
Pinafored peris divine.
Shuttlecock sirens in shortest skirt
ettes,
Eyes Willi an instinct to err;
Battledore beauties in tucked trouser
ettes,
Clever young kittens in fur.
Romping young rebels in openwork
socks,
Children in skipping rope skilled;
Damsels still wearing the briefest of
frocks,
Fairies most famously frilled.
Plump little rosy-cheeked, kissable
pets,
Bonnily booted croqueses;

Dimpled young darlings and graceful
girlettes,
Babies in sandals and shoes.
Muscular maidens in neat knicker
bocks,
Dainty, demure little doves;
Light-hearted lasses, with free-flowing
locks,
Lawntennisonian loves.
Sparkling bright row of the prettiest
pearls,
Joy of a sweet sunny day.
Blooming bright bouquet of beautiful
girls,
Shower of blossoms in May.
