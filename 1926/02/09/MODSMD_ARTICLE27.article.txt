# LATIN STUDY GAINS POPULARITY IN HIGH SCHOOLS, COLLEGES
## 
### 
Latin is more than holding its own
as a subject for high school and col
lege students, according to Clifton
Price, professor of Latin at the Uni
versity of California. He cites the re
port of the United States Department
of Elucation to substantiate his ob
servation. More students study Latin
in the high schools of the country
than are engaged in the study of all
other foreign languages combined;
1,040,000 being the total listed by the
federal department as Latin students,
and only 1,026,000 as students of all
other languages.
"There are evidences on all sides
that it is gaining in popularity, ,r says
Professor Price. "High school princi
pals are turning away from certain
modern languages and are recom
mending Latin to the student because
of its greater all-around value. The
reports that hre coming from all parts
of the state indicate an increased en
rollment in Latin in the high schools,
and this is reflected in the demand
for high school teachers."
The number of requests for Latin
teachers received at the University of
California was more than twice as
large as the number graduated in that
field in the same year, reports Profes
sor Price. This difference is being
met, however, by increased enrollment
in th department of that institution.
"In the lower division, which reflects
the trend of Latin most quickly, the
number of students has increased 35
per cent over the registration of last
year," he reports. "A large proportion
of these are planning to major in
Latin; partly because of their belief in
its intrinsic value and partly because
of their desire to teach it."
That the experience of the Univer
sity of California is the experience of
many other schools and colleges
throughout the United States is his
belief, and he says "the future of Latin
is secure, and its growth assured."
