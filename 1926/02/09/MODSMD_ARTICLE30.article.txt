# BAND PLANS FORMAL CONCERT APRIL 30 IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## May Take Summer Trip After Invitation of Conn Instrument Company 
### 
Stanford's band plans to givt its
first formal concert held for several
years on April 30 in the Assembly
hall. A matinee may possibly be held
for the students of the Palo Alto high
school and of the University. Such
concerts previous to the World War
were held regularly, but during the
â– war the band lost many of its musi
cians that the programs were discon
tinued, and since that time they have
been held only occasionally.
Several big overtures, new to the
American public, will be played by the
band. Director Ernest Whitney Martin
has just recently handed out to the
members music he procured while in
France during the war. These works
are not sold in the United States.
Other features on the program will be
several soloists, both from members
of the band and from out-ow-town
artists.
Instruments Needed
After the program a dance will take
place at the Women's Clubhouse. The
returns from the concert and the
dance will be used to pay for the new
uniforms recently acquired, to buy in
struments which are badly needed,
and to furnish the clubhouse.
Recently the Conn San Francisco
Co., a branch of the C. G. Conn Lim
ited Company, which is the largest
manufacturing concern of band instru
ments, has proposed to take the band
on a summer trip from June 21 to
July 21 that will cover Vancouver,
8.C., and possibly the entire Pacific
Coast. All money that is made on the
trip will be used to create a fund with
which to buy instruments.
Questionnaires Issued
Whether the band accepts the pro
posal depends on the members them
selves, if they can afford to leave
summer duties for a month. Question
naires were sent out Thursday and are
supposed to be checked in tonight.
This offer of this trip is the culmina
tion of a twenty-year effort of Director
Martin to get such a thing, and recog
nition of the Stanford band by such
a large concern is quite an honor.
The only other band on the Pacific
Coast which will take a trip this sum
mer is the U.S.C. band, which is being
backed by the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce.
Sunday Concert
Next Sunday afternoon, following a
custom instigated several years ago,
the band will give their annual con
cert at the veterans' hospital. The
program will be given out of doors if
the weather permits, otherwise it will
be held in the Red Cross auditorium.
At present the band has over ninety
members, so in order to obtain better
results from practice two groups have
been formed which meet separately.
Also every Saturday morning a class
for the instruction of those who intend
to be directors of a band in high
school is held.
