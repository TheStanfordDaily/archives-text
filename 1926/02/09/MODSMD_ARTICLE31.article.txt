# PAINTED PAVEMENT TRAFFIC SIGNALS ABANDONED IN CITY
## 
### 
Abandonment of the painted pave
ment as a traffic regulator in San
Francisco has been decided upon by
the traffic squad of the police depart
ment. This week, Captain Henry Glee
son, in charge of traffic, asked the
California State Automobile Associa
tion to erect 201 boulevard stop signs
at crossings on Pine, Bush, Fell, and
Fulton streets as a start of the pro
gram to replace all white lines with
signs where arterial traffic has the
right of way on boulevards.
"It has been found that the painted
pavement signs wear out so quickly
and are so soon obscured that motor
ists cannot see them," said J. W. John
eon, in charge of the Association's
road sign service. "When arrested for
crossing a boulevard, motorists in
variably reply that they could not see
the white line and this is true in
most cases. San Francisco is going to
replace all these lines with the stand
ard boulevard stop sign of the Asso
ciation. The initial order for 201 signs
is the beginning of the program.
"The boulevard stop has proved an
efficient regulator of traffic. It speeds
up traffic on main arteries of travel
and prevents accidents by giving the
right of way to travel on these main
arteries and putting on the motorist
crossing these arteries responsibility
for stopping before crossing a boule
vard."
