# TENNIS PROSPECTS LOOM BRIGHT AFTER WIN OVER GRIZZLIES
## 
### 
With a sweeping victory over the
University of California, Southern
Branch, to its credit, the varsity ten
nis team seems destined for a bright
season, culminating in the California
meet at Berkeley in April.
Already interest is developing in
the prospective match between Cran
ston Holman, premier Cardinal player,
and Edward Chandler, first man and
captain of the Blue and Gold. These
men are old opponents. Last year Hol
man defeated his rival in the annual
competition by the close score of 6-4,
3-6, 6-4. Later, however, in the inter
collegiate championship tournament
back East, Chandler turned the tables
bn his former conqueror and wrested
the individual laurels from him in the
finals, 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
During the remainder of the sum
mer, each player won various other
titles. Holman gained the national
junior crown without the loss of a
single set, and Chandler copped the
Providence, R. 1., tournament in an
equally impressive manner. This
spring, with their individual reputa
tions as well as the colors of their
respective colleges to uphold, they
should put up a wonderful exhibition.
Lionel Ogden, second man and cap
tain of the varsity, has been incapaci
tated of late with a sprained ankle re
ceived in the local intramural basket
ball series. This injury will handicap
his game for several weeks but it
should be healed perfectly before the
end of this quarter. Last summer
Ogden toured the East with Holman
and the two paired together in dou
bles. In the combination event of the
intercollegiate championship, they
reached the semi-final round where
they were defeated by Stratford and
Hillis of California, who eventually
won the title. This fall Ogden has
been showing the effects of his sum
mer's competition in a greatly im
proved game. s
Herrington Ranks Third
Alan Herrington, captain of the '28
freshman team, is at present ranked
third on the varsity squad. In Los
Angeles this summer he caused con
siderable comment in tennis circles by
his fine tournament play against Fer
nandini and Godshell, two of the rank
ing stars of the South. At present
Herrington is playing a high brand
of tennis that should avenge his de
feat by Bradsliaw Harrison in the
California matches last spring.
Fourth place on the tentative team
is held by Paul Fairchild, a member
of last year's varsity. He lost his
singles game to Gerald Stratford of
California, but paired with Harold
Overfelt almost defeated Stratford and
Hillis in the feature doubles match.
This season Fairchild has been prac
ticing steadily. As an experienced
veteran, he will be valuable to the
team.
The immediate reserve strength of
the varsity lies in three members of
the '28 freshman squad: Gomer Thom
as, Ralph McElvenny, and Frank Dunn.
Thomas seems to be the most promis
ing at present, but he is closely pur
sued by both McElvenny and Dunn,
who are eager to improve their rela
tive position at his expense.
A round robin tournament is now in
progress among the squad members
to determine the four-man team that
will take the trip to Los Angeles dur
ing the coming inter-quarter vacation.
Games are scheduled with U.S.C.,
U.C.5.8., and several tennis clubs, so
valuable competition will be given the
players to tune them up for the Cali
fornia match. >

respective colleges to uphold, they
should put up a wonderful exhibition.
Lionel Ogden, second man and cap
tain of the varsity, has been incapaci
tated of late with a sprained ankle re
ceived in the local intramural basket
ball series. This injury will handicap
his game for several weeks but it
should be healed perfectly before the
end of this quarter. Last summer
Ogden toured the East with Holman
and the two paired together in dou
bles. In the combination event of the
intercollegiate championship, they
reached the semi-final round where
they were defeated by Stratford and
Hillis of California, who eventually
won the title. This fall Ogden has
been showing the effects of his sum
mer's competition in a greatly im
proved game. s
Herrington Ranks Third
Alan Herrington, captain of the '28
freshman team, is at present ranked
third on the varsity squad. In Los
Angeles this summer he caused con
siderable comment in tennis circles by
his fine tournament play against Fer
nandini and Godshell, two of the rank
ing stars of the South. At present
Herrington is playing a high brand
of tennis that should avenge his de
feat by Bradsliaw Harrison in the
California matches last spring.
Fourth place on the tentative team
is held by Paul Fairchild, a member
of last year's varsity. He lost his
singles game to Gerald Stratford of
California, but paired with Harold
Overfelt almost defeated Stratford and
Hillis in the feature doubles match.
This season Fairchild has been prac
ticing steadily. As an experienced
veteran, he will be valuable to the
team.
The immediate reserve strength of
the varsity lies in three members of
the '28 freshman squad: Gomer Thom
as, Ralph McElvenny, and Frank Dunn.
Thomas seems to be the most promis
ing at present, but he is closely pur
sued by both McElvenny and Dunn,
who are eager to improve their rela
tive position at his expense.
A round robin tournament is now in
progress among the squad members
to determine the four-man team that
will take the trip to Los Angeles dur
ing the coming inter-quarter vacation.
Games are scheduled with U.S.C.,
U.C.5.8., and several tennis clubs, so
valuable competition will be given the
players to tune them up for the Cali
fornia match. >
With a sweeping victory over the
University of California, Southern
Branch, to its credit, the varsity ten
nis team seems destined for a bright
season, culminating in the California
meet at Berkeley in April.
Already interest is developing in
the prospective match between Cran
ston Holman, premier Cardinal player,
and Edward Chandler, first man and
captain of the Blue and Gold. These
men are old opponents. Last year Hol
man defeated his rival in the annual
competition by the close score of 6-4,
3-6, 6-4. Later, however, in the inter
collegiate championship tournament
back East, Chandler turned the tables
bn his former conqueror and wrested
the individual laurels from him in the
finals, 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
During the remainder of the sum
mer, each player won various other
titles. Holman gained the national
junior crown without the loss of a
single set, and Chandler copped the
Providence, R. 1., tournament in an
equally impressive manner. This
spring, with their individual reputa
tions as well as the colors of their
respective colleges to uphold, they
should put up a wonderful exhibition.
