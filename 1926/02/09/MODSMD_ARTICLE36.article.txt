# BULLETIN DISCUSSES OPPORTUNITIES IN VARIED PROFESSIONS
## 
### 
The sort of training desirable for
the various professions or occupations
of life, and what Stanford has to offer
the student is discussed completely in
the bulletin, "Vocational Information,"
recently prepared by the Stanford
faculty. The bulletin is about 200
pages long and treats its various
topics very fully. Copies are on sale
at the registrar's office at 25 cents
a copy.
What opportunities are there to of
fer in this or that profession? What
are the personal qualities that are
most likely to lead to success, and
what are the prospects for the future
of the profession? What are different
vocations likely to pay? These and
many other similar questions are an
swered in the bulletin. Members of
the committee on vocational training
are available for conference with stu
dents regarding the choice and pur
suit of a vocation. The chairman is
Professor Edward K. Strong, Jr., of
the Psychology department and the
Graduate School of Business.
So far as students already enrolled
in the University are concerned, the
"Vocational Information" bulletin is
designed to aid in making an intelli
gent choice of a life work, to help in
outlining a course to the best advan
tage, and to indicate ways of getting
established in the chosen vocation
without loss of time.
The articles are written by persons
familiar with the vocations concerned
and with the organization of the Uni
versity. They present the important
facts about the vocations which uni
versity graduates enter, college studies
which are considered important in
preparation for these vocations, and
the opportunities for employment and
promotion.
In the organization of the book voca
tions have been grouped to afford a
chance to compare these which are
similar in type or closely related n
one way or another, and the articles
are cross referenced so that all related
vocations may be easily found.
