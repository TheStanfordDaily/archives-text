# HINDOOS' INTRIGUES FILL PLOT OF "GREEN GODDESS"
## 
### 
Intrigues, deep, dark plots of Ra
jahs and Hindoo priests, and a setting
in the heart of India, will give a new
tone to campus dramatics when "The
Green Goddess," by William Archer,
is produced in the Assembly hall
March 5. The play is being directed
by Gordon Davis and sponsored by the
English Club.
The plot of "The Green Goddess"
centers about a group of inventors
who are forced to land with their air
plane near a village in the interior of
India. They are captured by an un
friendly Indian potentate, and therein
lies the plot—do they escape? You
know they do. But how —that's a dif
ferent matter.
George Arliss played the part of the
Rajah in the play as it was originally
produced in New York in 1923. He had
a long run there and then went to
London, where the play remained for
over a year. It is considered one of
the best plays written in recent years.

Arliss' work in the leading role helped
to put it over in its initial perform
ance, but it has steadily grown in
favor, and was recently filmed with
Arliss playing the lead.
The English Club play will conclude
the winter quarter dramatic season.
Last year the club presented "Mac
beth," which is typical of the sort of
plays this organization usually pro
duces. Though "The Green Goddess"
does not have such a large cast as
"Macbeth," it is full of colorful cos
tumes and tense dramatic action.
This will be Gordon Davis' last work
of the year before he goes on his
annual trip to New York to study the
situation of drama there. Every year
he makes this trip at the end of the
winter quarter and comes back to try
out new experiments he has learned.
This enables him to keep the drama
at Stanford on the high plane that it
now enjoys.
The complete cast for the play will
be announced tomorrow.
