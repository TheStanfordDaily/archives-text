# Southern California Cage Star "Earns" No. 13 Jersey
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8. â€”Number
13 was recently awarded Jack Bruner,
center of the Southern California bas
ketball team, because Bruner had es
tablished himself the champion hard
luck man of the season. Bruner played
the first cage games with an infected
toe, broken arch, and two weak ankles.
He threw a vertebrae out of place
before the California games, his knee
slipped out of place in one of the
Bear games, and in the first game
with Stanford his elbow collided with
a Stanford player's teeth and then
Bruner went to the hospital with
blood poisoning. While in the hospital
bis team received new jerseys, and
after these had been given out, Num
ber 13 was the only one left. This
went to Bruner.
