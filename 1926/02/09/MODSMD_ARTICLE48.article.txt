# SPORTS OF 1926
## A 						Modern Victory

Back in 1918, Loren Murchison, then an embryo sailor
at the Great Lakes Naval Station, won the two hundred
and twenty yard dash in the National A. A. U. track and
field meet. Before then he had been known as a fine
sprinter around St. Louis, and now, eight years later, he
is still adding fame to his name and further strengthening
his title of "Indoor Sprint King of America."
Sprinters' careers are not short by any means, for
Paddock and Scholz, as well as Murchison, have been
winning and breaking records since before the war.
But there is something about the irrepressible Murchison
that catches one's fancy, and distinguishes him from the
colorful Paddock and the uncolorful Scholz. Loren, al
though he does not get into the headlines as often as his
fellow globetrotter, Sir Charles William Paddock, never
theless manages to hog more than his share of the lime-

'light. If it isn't a new record, it's a call down from the A. A. U. f or an
automobile accident, or a sensational divorce, in which the Olympic hero
lost his wife's love to follow his life's ambition on the cinder track."
Murch's defeat of Hubbard, Hussey, Norton, Bowman, and Clarke in the
Brooklyn College games last month —his 35th, 36th, and 37th consecutive
indoor victories —must have been very sweet to the veteran sprinter, especially
as his training workouts had been few and far between, due to the fact that
he is on the road almost continually for a Chicago firm.
I had the pleasure of being a teammate of Loren's in the Olympic Games
at Antwerp in 1920. Coming home on the transport Sherman, the "life of the
party" was Mr. Murchison himself, and he made things miserable for big Pat
McDonald, much to the amusement of all on board. And when he wasn't
kidding Pat, he was opening little Frankie Genaro's eyes even wider with
some yarn of his own invention. "Murch" would be popular for his sprinting
ability alone, but he has many other qualities that endear him to all who know
him well.

Recent news photos show9d Red Grange meeting Luther Bur
bank. The difference between the two is that Burbank crosses a
lemon with an orange and makes a grapefruit, while Grange crosses
a goal line with a football and makes a touchdown.
