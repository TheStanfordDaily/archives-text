# RAM'S HEAD FIRST STUDENT DIRECTED SHOW THIS YEAR
## Dave Mannoccir to Produce 'Ray, 'Ray, Rover Boys Friday, Saturday 
### 
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," the Ram's
Head production which will be given
in the Assembly hall Friday and Sat
urday, holds a unique place among
Stanford dramatic productions as one
of the few shows presented by student
talent alone. With the exception of the
Junior Opera, occasionally the Senior
Farce, a few of the track and football
shows, and the annual Ram's Head
show, all of the other year's produc
tions depend upon outside aid in di
recting.
F. David Mannoccir, director of
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," was in charge
of the Ram's Head show, "The Devil's
Daughter," produced last year. In con
junction with Charles H. Parks, he
also directed the 1925 Track Review,
and in addition has gained experience
in this line while in Pasadena before
entering Stanford.
As an actor, Mannoccir was cast as
the Master Robot in Karel Copen's
melodrama, "R.U.R.," produced by
Gordon Davis last year, and also
played in "The Merchant of Menace"
and "So This Is Eden."
A plot written by Dave Lamson and
Mike Ely, former Chaparral editors,
casting of students for both the main
characters and the choruses, and stage
settings and costumes by Les Kiler
and Chrysella Dunker Kiler, in addi
tion to direction by Mannoccir, make
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys" a true Stan
ford production.
Tickets left over from the seat sale
today may be purchased tomorrow at
1 o'clock at the A.S.S.U. office in the
Old Union.
