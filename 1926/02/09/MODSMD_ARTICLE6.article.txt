# PI LAMBDA THETA'S ORIGIN DISCUSSED BY HISTORY GRADUATE
## 
### 
Started in 1917 with seven chapters
Pi Lambda Tlieta now numbers nine
teen chapters, according to Miss Jes
sie Hill, history graduate, who talked .
on "The Origin of Pi Lambda Theta" i
at a meeting of the Women's Educa
tion Club yesterday afternoon. Pi ;
Lambda Theta recently accepted the
petition of the Stanford Women's Edu
cation Club for a charter.
Pi Lambda Theta began in Missouri i
in 1911 as a local organization, and the |
national organization started in 1917 ;
held its first convention in 1919 at the j
University of Pennsylvania. At the [
University of Missouri Pi Lambda
Theta took the place of Phi Beta j
Kappa in the School of Education i
since Phi Beta Kappa members were
only admitted from the School of Let-;
ters and Sciences. To maintain stand
ards similar to those of Phi Beta i
Kappa, Pi Lambda Theta required
high scholarship, and a national re
quirement for membership is the main- j
tenance of a "B" average.
Installation of the local chapter will
be at the beginning of spring quarter.
Miss Hill, who is a member of Alpha
chapter at Missouri, has been desig
nated as the installing officer by the
national board.
North Dakota was the last college
to be granted a chapter and the Uni
versity of California is now petition
ing for a charter.
