# GEOGRAPHIC BOARD NAMES MOUNTAIN IN JORDAN'S HONOR
## Tulare County Peak Chosen To Bear Chancellor Emeritusâ€™ Name 
### 
David Starr Jordan, chancellor emer
itus of Stanford University, has been
honored by the United States Geo- j
graphic Board by its naming a moun-:
tain peak in Tulare county after him. j
The peak is on the crest of the Kings-
Kern divide, on the west slope of the
Sierra Nevadas, at latitude 36.41, long- j
titude 118.27.
This action was taken upon the urg-;
ing of the Sierra Club of California.'
Dr. Jordan, hearing of the event,
issued the following statement:
"I notice in the press that a peak,in
the King's Kern Divide in the High
Sierras in Tulare county has been j
named Mount Jordan, Some thirty
years ago a peak farther north, the
second highest in the state, one of a
series called the Palisades, was called
Mount Jordan by Professor Bolton
Coit of Stanford University. This
name went on the maps for a time,
but Dr. Joseph LeConte, in making
a map of the region, discovered that
the early Whitney Survey had called
the mountain in a general way the
North Palisade, not exactly as the
name of a peak but as a mountain
ridge, but the Lieutenant Wheeler
Survey which followed gave this par
ticular crest of the mountain the name
of North Palisade. The stream at the
foot of the mountain flowing into the
San Joaquin, I believe is still called
Jordan Creek.
"Some years after, a number of us
from Stanford climbed one of the high
peaks of King's Kern Divide and
named it Stanford University Peak,
or in short, Mount Stanford. Adjoin
ing this is a very rocky point early
called Gregory's Monument, and a
third peak of some 14,000 feet has re
mained unnamed. Dr. John N. LeConte
and Mr. Francis P. Farquahr, a moun
taineer prominent in the Sierra Club
and chairman of the Committee on
Names, have called this peak for me
and are arranging to have the name
put on the maps of the U. S. Geologi
cal Survey. Ms. Farquhar observes:
'We feel that you will be particularly
pleased at the selection of a peak in
the region where you spent some time
in 1899 and which was the inspiration
for your admirable book on the Kings-
Kern Divide.'
"I can stand it if the mountain can
and I feel honored to be connected
; with one of the giants of the Sierras."
