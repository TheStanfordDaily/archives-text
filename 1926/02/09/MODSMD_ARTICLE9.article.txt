fight than the 12 to 5 score would indi
cate. Sigma Chi captured second place
in League II by overwhelming the
Theta Delta Chi team 15-7, after the
Theta Delt team had obtained a one
point lead at half time.
The Breakers-Theta Chi tilt started
out in furious fashion with both teams
fighting for the lead with about equal
success. Hogle, Sawyer, and Richmond
each tossed in a basket to total six
points for the Row squad before the
end of the half, while Breakers were
scoring seven points including two
baskets by George, running guard, two
foul shots by Carlsmith, and one foul
shot by Cook.

low, and George each scoring a field
goal. Richmond and Dice each shot a
goal for the fraternity five to bring
; its score up to ten.
Phi Delta Theta brought its string
1 of victories up to five by downing the
Encina 2W quintet 12-5 in a hard
! fought game. Duncan was the best
all-around player on the Encina team,
making four of the freshmen's scores.
Davis scored their other point. The
Phi Delts took the lead from the start
and were never headed. Garibaldi was
high scorer with eight points. Snyde,
center, and Kenny, forward, each shot
a goal. Fletcher did some effective
guarding for the winners.
King Starts Sig Scoring
King, Sigma Chi forward, started
off the scoring in the Sigma Chi-Theta
Delta Chi contest with a nifty shot.
The Theta Delts gained a 3 to 2 lead
a minute later when Pendleton shot a
field goal from a tip-off play and Har
ter caged a foul shot. Sigma Chi then
regained the lead after a wild scram
ble for points when Clark, running
guard, sank a close one which was fol
lowed a moment later by King's sec
ond basket. Their opponents then ral
lied with a difficult side-line shot by
Harter and a second goal by Pendle
ton. The half ended with the Theta
Delts ahead 7-6.
The second half was all Sigma Chi.

Scarlet fever in the school post
poned a Chicago high school basket
ball game.
After an extremely close and excit
ing battle, Breakers Club beat the
Theta Chi team 16 to 10, to win the
championship in League I of the intra
mural basketball tourney. Though
Theta Chi was behind only one point
at half time, the club team drew away
from its opponents toward the end of
the game. Phi Delta Theta retained
its hold on the laurels in League II
by defeating Encina 2W after a closer
fight than the 12 to 5 score would indi
cate. Sigma Chi captured second place
in League II by overwhelming the
Theta Delta Chi team 15-7, after the
Theta Delt team had obtained a one
point lead at half time.
The Breakers-Theta Chi tilt started
out in furious fashion with both teams
fighting for the lead with about equal
success. Hogle, Sawyer, and Richmond
each tossed in a basket to total six
points for the Row squad before the
end of the half, while Breakers were
scoring seven points including two
baskets by George, running guard, two
foul shots by Carlsmith, and one foul
shot by Cook.
Breakers Take Lead
With the start of the second half,
the club team took the lead, which it
gradually extended to six points. Four
players had a hand in the rally which
brought the victory, Cook, Bush, Har
low, and George each scoring a field
goal. Richmond and Dice each shot a
goal for the fraternity five to bring
; its score up to ten.
Phi Delta Theta brought its string
1 of victories up to five by downing the
Encina 2W quintet 12-5 in a hard
! fought game. Duncan was the best
all-around player on the Encina team,
making four of the freshmen's scores.
Davis scored their other point. The
Phi Delts took the lead from the start
and were never headed. Garibaldi was
high scorer with eight points. Snyde,
center, and Kenny, forward, each shot
a goal. Fletcher did some effective
guarding for the winners.
King Starts Sig Scoring
King, Sigma Chi forward, started
off the scoring in the Sigma Chi-Theta
Delta Chi contest with a nifty shot.
The Theta Delts gained a 3 to 2 lead
a minute later when Pendleton shot a
field goal from a tip-off play and Har
ter caged a foul shot. Sigma Chi then
regained the lead after a wild scram
ble for points when Clark, running
guard, sank a close one which was fol
lowed a moment later by King's sec
ond basket. Their opponents then ral
lied with a difficult side-line shot by
Harter and a second goal by Pendle
ton. The half ended with the Theta
Delts ahead 7-6.
The second half was all Sigma Chi.
Brady, Sig center, started the scoring
and gave his team a one-point lead.
King followed with three points and
McElroy ended the scoring with two
clever shots. The Theta Delta Chi
team, though it had many chances,
were unable to score in the second
half.
Pendleton Theta Delt Star
King was high-point winner for the
winners with seven points. Pendleton
was the outstanding player for the
losers and also their high-scorer with
four points. Clark and McClellan, Sig
guards, by their close guarding forced
the Theta Delts to resort to long shots.
Three games were forfeited yester
day. Kappa Alpha defaulted to Encina
IW, Encina 4E won by default from
Zeta Psi, and Branner II failed to ap
pear for its game with Sequoia 11.
The games for tomorrow are as fol
lows:
4:15 —Encina 3W vs. Chi Psi.
4:50 —Branner I vs. Delta Kappa
Epsilon.
7:15 —El Tigre vs. Sigma Alpha
