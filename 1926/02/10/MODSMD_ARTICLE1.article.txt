Kappa Sigma won the title in
League 111 by defeating the Junipero

The first half was featured by clever

with any degree of regularity. The
first period ended 5 to 4 in favor of

down the court on numerous occasions.
Many good chances to score were

Harold, forward on the club team,
was the star of the game, and is

together well at the forward positions
for the winners.
