Kappa Sigma won the title in
League 111 by defeating the Junipero
Serra team in an exciting game, 12
to 8. The two teams were the leaders
in their league and entered the con
test with even chances for victory.
The game was close from the begin
ning until the end, but superior team
work on the part of the fraternity
team formally cinched the champion
ship.
The first half was featured by clever
defensive work, and neither team was
able to penetrate the other's territory
with any degree of regularity. The
first period ended 5 to 4 in favor of
the Kappa Sigs. The winners started a
smoother working offensive in the last
half, and succeeded in passing the ball
down the court on numerous occasions.
Many good chances to score were
missed in the last half by both teams.
Harold, forward on the club team,
was the star of the game, and is
credited with all of his team's eight
points. Middleton played his usual
good game at center for the Kappa
Sigs. Southworth and Stevens worked
together well at the forward positions
for the winners.
Theta Xi's Win Title
Theta Xi made it five straight by
defeating Alpha Delta Phi in a rag
gedly played contest. This victory
gives Theta Xi the placque in League
IV. The winners displayed better team
work and better shooting in compari
son to the Alpha Delts' erroneous
passing and shooting, and are given
credit for a well-earned victory.
The score at half time favored the
winners, 4 to 2. Freeman, Theta Xi
forward, found the basket twice in
quick succession at the start of the
second period, giving his team a lead
that was never challenged by the
losers. Both teams showed a marked
inability to cage their shots during the
latter part of the game.
Freeman and Anderson tied for high
point honors with four apiece. Hol
man, Alpha Delt forward, made all of
his team's three counts. Evans played
a good defensive game for the losers,
as did Fain and Smith for Theta Xi.
Alpha Sigs Beat Frosh
Alpha Sigma Phi took a close deci
sion from Encina 2E in a rather list
lessly played contest that dragged on
to a 13 to 10 conclusion. Many easy
shots under the basket were missed
by both teams and the defensive play
ing was extremely ragged. The score
at half time favored the fraternity
five, 5 to 2.
Ophuls, Encina center, found the
range of the hoop in the second half
and ran up three field goals in quick
order. The freshmen tied the count at
11-all with about five minutes left to
play, but Ferguson connected for a
basket that won the game. Neither
team played very good basketball near
the end of the game, and many
chances to win the contest decisively
were not made good.
Fijis Try Hard
After being blanked in the first half
of their game with El Capitan, the
Phi Gamma Delta players came back
with a rally in the second period that
nearly won the game. The club team
led 6 to 0 at half time, but the Fijis
started off with a rush that fell two
points short of the victory, the game
ending 12 to 10' for El Capitan.
Canfield, El Capitan center, gave a
good exhibition for the club quintet,
and was the main cog in the offense.
He is credited with four points. Kir
wan, Fiji running guard, carried off
high-point honors with three field
goals for a total of six markers. Chase
played well at forward for the fra
ternity team.
Phi Psis Defeat A.K.L.'s
The Phi Kappa Psi-Alpha Kappa
Lambda tussle was featured by poor
shooting by both teams. Excellent
teamwork was ruined repeatedly by a
marked inability to connect with the
goal. The Phi Psis seem to hold a
little advantage in floorwork during
the entire game.
The losers led at half time 4 to 3,
but the Phi Psis came back strong in
the second half and outplayed their
opponents. Field goals by Knox and
Wisely won the game for the Phi Psis
in the latter part of the contest. Bar
nett, A.K.L. forward, and Wisely, Phi
Psi running guard, were the best per
formers.
Encina IE ran rings around Los
Arcos and had little difficulty run
ning up a 27 to 8 score. The freshman
five showed the effects of steady prac
tice in its passing and shooting. Los
Arcos resorted to ineffective individu
al attempts at an offense.
Richards, Encina running guard,
was the outstanding player of the
game. He ran off with high-point hon
ors with 12 points, and was largely
responsible for the majority of the
other baskets made by his team.
Walling, Los Arcos running guard,
captured high-point rating for his team
with four points. West played a nice
game at forward for the freshmen,
being credited with eight markers.
Following are the contests scheduled
for tomorrow:

order. The freshmen tied the count at
11-all with about five minutes left to
play, but Ferguson connected for a
basket that won the game. Neither
team played very good basketball near
the end of the game, and many
chances to win the contest decisively
were not made good.
Fijis Try Hard
After being blanked in the first half
of their game with El Capitan, the
Phi Gamma Delta players came back
with a rally in the second period that
nearly won the game. The club team
led 6 to 0 at half time, but the Fijis
started off with a rush that fell two
points short of the victory, the game
ending 12 to 10' for El Capitan.
Canfield, El Capitan center, gave a
good exhibition for the club quintet,
and was the main cog in the offense.
He is credited with four points. Kir
wan, Fiji running guard, carried off
high-point honors with three field
goals for a total of six markers. Chase
played well at forward for the fra
ternity team.
Phi Psis Defeat A.K.L.'s
The Phi Kappa Psi-Alpha Kappa
Lambda tussle was featured by poor
shooting by both teams. Excellent
teamwork was ruined repeatedly by a
marked inability to connect with the
goal. The Phi Psis seem to hold a
little advantage in floorwork during
the entire game.
The losers led at half time 4 to 3,
but the Phi Psis came back strong in
the second half and outplayed their
opponents. Field goals by Knox and
Wisely won the game for the Phi Psis
in the latter part of the contest. Bar
nett, A.K.L. forward, and Wisely, Phi
Psi running guard, were the best per
formers.
Encina IE ran rings around Los
Arcos and had little difficulty run
ning up a 27 to 8 score. The freshman
five showed the effects of steady prac
tice in its passing and shooting. Los
Arcos resorted to ineffective individu
al attempts at an offense.
Richards, Encina running guard,
was the outstanding player of the
game. He ran off with high-point hon
ors with 12 points, and was largely
responsible for the majority of the
other baskets made by his team.
Walling, Los Arcos running guard,
captured high-point rating for his team
with four points. West played a nice
game at forward for the freshmen,
being credited with eight markers.

Kappa Sigma won the title in
League 111 by defeating the Junipero
Serra team in an exciting game, 12
to 8. The two teams were the leaders
in their league and entered the con
test with even chances for victory.
The game was close from the begin
ning until the end, but superior team
work on the part of the fraternity
team formally cinched the champion
ship.
The first half was featured by clever
defensive work, and neither team was
able to penetrate the other's territory
with any degree of regularity. The
first period ended 5 to 4 in favor of
the Kappa Sigs. The winners started a
smoother working offensive in the last
half, and succeeded in passing the ball
down the court on numerous occasions.
Many good chances to score were
missed in the last half by both teams.
Harold, forward on the club team,
was the star of the game, and is
credited with all of his team's eight
points. Middleton played his usual
good game at center for the Kappa
Sigs. Southworth and Stevens worked
together well at the forward positions
for the winners.
Theta Xi's Win Title
Theta Xi made it five straight by
defeating Alpha Delta Phi in a rag
gedly played contest. This victory
gives Theta Xi the placque in League
IV. The winners displayed better team
work and better shooting in compari
son to the Alpha Delts' erroneous
passing and shooting, and are given
credit for a well-earned victory.
The score at half time favored the
winners, 4 to 2. Freeman, Theta Xi
forward, found the basket twice in
quick succession at the start of the
second period, giving his team a lead
that was never challenged by the
losers. Both teams showed a marked
inability to cage their shots during the
latter part of the game.
Freeman and Anderson tied for high
point honors with four apiece. Hol
man, Alpha Delt forward, made all of
his team's three counts. Evans played
a good defensive game for the losers,
as did Fain and Smith for Theta Xi.
Alpha Sigs Beat Frosh
Alpha Sigma Phi took a close deci
sion from Encina 2E in a rather list
lessly played contest that dragged on
to a 13 to 10 conclusion. Many easy
shots under the basket were missed
by both teams and the defensive play
ing was extremely ragged. The score
at half time favored the fraternity
five, 5 to 2.
Ophuls, Encina center, found the
range of the hoop in the second half
and ran up three field goals in quick
order. The freshmen tied the count at

Kappa Sigma won the title in
League 111 by defeating the Junipero
Serra team in an exciting game, 12
to 8. The two teams were the leaders
in their league and entered the con
test with even chances for victory.
The game was close from the begin
ning until the end, but superior team
work on the part of the fraternity
team formally cinched the champion
ship.
The first half was featured by clever
defensive work, and neither team was
able to penetrate the other's territory
with any degree of regularity. The
first period ended 5 to 4 in favor of
the Kappa Sigs. The winners started a
smoother working offensive in the last
half, and succeeded in passing the ball
down the court on numerous occasions.
Many good chances to score were
missed in the last half by both teams.
Harold, forward on the club team,
was the star of the game, and is
credited with all of his team's eight
points. Middleton played his usual
good game at center for the Kappa
Sigs. Southworth and Stevens worked
together well at the forward positions
for the winners.
Theta Xi's Win Title
Theta Xi made it five straight by
defeating Alpha Delta Phi in a rag
gedly played contest. This victory
gives Theta Xi the placque in League
IV. The winners displayed better team
work and better shooting in compari
son to the Alpha Delts' erroneous
passing and shooting, and are given
credit for a well-earned victory.
The score at half time favored the
winners, 4 to 2. Freeman, Theta Xi
forward, found the basket twice in
quick succession at the start of the
second period, giving his team a lead
that was never challenged by the
losers. Both teams showed a marked
inability to cage their shots during the
latter part of the game.
Freeman and Anderson tied for high
point honors with four apiece. Hol
man, Alpha Delt forward, made all of
his team's three counts. Evans played
a good defensive game for the losers,
as did Fain and Smith for Theta Xi.
Alpha Sigs Beat Frosh
Alpha Sigma Phi took a close deci
sion from Encina 2E in a rather list
lessly played contest that dragged on
to a 13 to 10 conclusion. Many easy
shots under the basket were missed
by both teams and the defensive play
ing was extremely ragged. The score
at half time favored the fraternity
five, 5 to 2.
Ophuls, Encina center, found the
range of the hoop in the second half
and ran up three field goals in quick
order. The freshmen tied the count at
11-all with about five minutes left to
play, but Ferguson connected for a
basket that won the game. Neither
team played very good basketball near
the end of the game, and many
chances to win the contest decisively
were not made good.
Fijis Try Hard
After being blanked in the first half
of their game with El Capitan, the
Phi Gamma Delta players came back
with a rally in the second period that
nearly won the game. The club team
led 6 to 0 at half time, but the Fijis
started off with a rush that fell two
points short of the victory, the game
ending 12 to 10' for El Capitan.
Canfield, El Capitan center, gave a
good exhibition for the club quintet,
and was the main cog in the offense.
He is credited with four points. Kir
wan, Fiji running guard, carried off
high-point honors with three field
goals for a total of six markers. Chase
played well at forward for the fra
ternity team.
Phi Psis Defeat A.K.L.'s
The Phi Kappa Psi-Alpha Kappa
Lambda tussle was featured by poor
shooting by both teams. Excellent
teamwork was ruined repeatedly by a
marked inability to connect with the
goal. The Phi Psis seem to hold a
little advantage in floorwork during
the entire game.
The losers led at half time 4 to 3,
but the Phi Psis came back strong in
the second half and outplayed their
opponents. Field goals by Knox and
Wisely won the game for the Phi Psis
in the latter part of the contest. Bar
nett, A.K.L. forward, and Wisely, Phi
Psi running guard, were the best per
formers.
Encina IE ran rings around Los
Arcos and had little difficulty run
ning up a 27 to 8 score. The freshman
five showed the effects of steady prac
tice in its passing and shooting. Los
Arcos resorted to ineffective individu
al attempts at an offense.
Richards, Encina running guard,
was the outstanding player of the
game. He ran off with high-point hon
ors with 12 points, and was largely
responsible for the majority of the
other baskets made by his team.
Walling, Los Arcos running guard,
captured high-point rating for his team
with four points. West played a nice
game at forward for the freshmen,
being credited with eight markers.
