# EDUCATION VITAL TO DEMOCRACY-SAYS MANSBRIDGE
## English Workers Education Association Founder Gives Lecture 
### 
Adult education in England is an
esential factor in giving impetus to
the democratic movement, according
to Dr. Albert Mansbridge, founder of
the Workers Education Association in
England, who spoke on "Adult Educa
tion and Democracy" last night in the
Assembly hall.
"Education has a universal appeal,
is unrestricted as to class, and can be
assimilated by the working man as
well as the aristocrat," says Dr. Mans
bridge.
"The essential feature of democracy
is that it is a state of society in
which everybody has the opportunity
to make the best of himself," declared
Mansbridge. "Education provides that
opportunity, not of doing the best you
can in life, but of taking the best of
life into yourself."
Dr. Mansbridge traced the develop
ment of adult education in England
since the beginning of this century.
The adult education movement grew
out of a request of a small group of
workingmen who, becoming enthusi
astic through contact with university
extension work, appealed to Oxford
University which granted their re
quest for a tutor. A class was then
formed.
"These were ignorant people," Dr.
Mansbridge said, "and yet within a
year they had advanced to such a de
gree that twenty-five per cent of the
essays written then were declared by
th tutor to be equal to those written
by students who had gained first-class
honors in the School of Modern His
tory.
"It is true that this is exceptional,
but wherever there is such genuine
zeal for study and learning, there will
be such results. Although many -of
these men were employed at hard
work during the day, they attended
classes regularly and completed the
three years of work they had re
quested."
According to the English plan of
adult education the students are ex
pected to fulfill the equivalent of the
honor degree in three years of study.
There are 528 classes in England
studying under this plan.
The adult education movement has
altered English universities, according
to Dr. Mansbridge, in that it has pro
vided a new light in the approach to
the study of economics by furnishing
actual examples.
Adult education has brought the uni
versities closer to the people who now
understand the functions of the uni
versities. The adult education move
ment makes an appeal to almost every
type of community and is not con
cerned with any particular type of
people, according to Dr. Mansbridge.
It aims to bring education within the
reach of all.

Adult education in England is an
esential factor in giving impetus to
the democratic movement, according
to Dr. Albert Mansbridge, founder of
the Workers Education Association in
England, who spoke on "Adult Educa
tion and Democracy" last night in the
Assembly hall.
"Education has a universal appeal,
is unrestricted as to class, and can be
assimilated by the working man as
well as the aristocrat," says Dr. Mans
bridge.
"The essential feature of democracy
is that it is a state of society in
which everybody has the opportunity
to make the best of himself," declared
Mansbridge. "Education provides that
opportunity, not of doing the best you
can in life, but of taking the best of
life into yourself."
Dr. Mansbridge traced the develop
ment of adult education in England
since the beginning of this century.
The adult education movement grew
out of a request of a small group of
workingmen who, becoming enthusi
astic through contact with university
extension work, appealed to Oxford
University which granted their re
quest for a tutor. A class was then
formed.
"These were ignorant people," Dr.
Mansbridge said, "and yet within a
year they had advanced to such a de
gree that twenty-five per cent of the
essays written then were declared by
th tutor to be equal to those written
by students who had gained first-class
honors in the School of Modern His
tory.
"It is true that this is exceptional,
but wherever there is such genuine
zeal for study and learning, there will
be such results. Although many -of
these men were employed at hard
work during the day, they attended
classes regularly and completed the
three years of work they had re
quested."
According to the English plan of
adult education the students are ex
pected to fulfill the equivalent of the
honor degree in three years of study.
There are 528 classes in England
studying under this plan.
The adult education movement has
altered English universities, according
to Dr. Mansbridge, in that it has pro
vided a new light in the approach to
the study of economics by furnishing
actual examples.
Adult education has brought the uni
versities closer to the people who now
understand the functions of the uni
versities. The adult education move
ment makes an appeal to almost every
type of community and is not con
cerned with any particular type of
people, according to Dr. Mansbridge.
It aims to bring education within the
reach of all.
