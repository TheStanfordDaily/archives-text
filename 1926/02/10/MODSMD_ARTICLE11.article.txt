# ALLEN WILL PLAY BACH COMPOSITIONS IN ORGAN RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen will play three
numbers in his recital in the Memorial
Church tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
o'clock. "Passacaglia and Fugue" by
J. S. Bach will open the program.
In this number, a dance of the old
classic form, in which much music
was written in Bach's time, precedes
a fugue. The fugue is especially asso
ciated with the name of Bach, for it
was he who developed it from a stiff
and lifeless musical pattern to a point
where it was expressive of the loftiest
thought and most advanced concepts.
In the fugue several melodies are
heard at the same time, blending to
gether to form a coherent and impos
ing whole. It is perhaps the greatest
development of the classical school of
polyphonic writing, of which Bach was
the greatest leader.
The Passacaglia is a rapid dance in
triple time. Translated literally, the
name means "running in the street."
The overture to the opera "Euryanthe"
by Weber will be played by Allen.
"Euryanthe" was the second opera of
Weber who was the originator of the
national German opera. Weber's music
is romantic and stirring. He made
great use of the dramatic situations
of his operas. His influence is clearly
traceable in Wagner, who brought the
German opera to its summit.
The overture tells the story of the
opera in a condensed form and con
tains its greatest arias and melodies.
A suite of three pieces, "Fireside
Sketches," by J. S. Cloakey, will finish
the program. These are descriptive of
domestic scenes and are simple and
quaint.
