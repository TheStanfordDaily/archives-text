# Sophomore Tryoutees Will Lead Yells at Nevada Game
## 
### 
Sophomore tryoutees for yell leaders
will make their last appearance as a
group between the halves of the Stan
ford-Nevada games on Thursday and
Saturday nights. These will be the last
two times that tryoutees will lead the
yells during the basketball season.
During the track meets they will lead
in groups of two.
About a dozen tryoutees have been
practicing three times a week since
the beginning of the quarter in the
class in yell-leading conducted by
Jimmy Farr and Bob Fraser. They first,
displayed their abilities during the
Stanford-California freshman game.
