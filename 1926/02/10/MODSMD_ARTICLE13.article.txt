A scene in a play supposed to repre
sent a scene in a play is one of the
unique features of the setting for the
second act of "Ray! Ray! Rover Boys,"
the Ram's Head show of 1926, which
will be presented in the Assembly
hall on Friday and Saturday nightq. In
this scene, supposed to be the setting
of a Junior Opera Insertnameof
University, Leslie Kii^r, J ..technical di
rector, gently satirize&"musical comedy

The action'Qf .a" section of the sec
ond act of' "Ray! Ray Rover Boys"
is the production of the opera for
which the satirical set was designed.
The t main purpose of this supposed
opera, although it does serve a very
important part in the plot of the
Ram's Head Show, is also to act as
a device for the introduction of a num
ber of songs, parodies, and specialtiec
which were deemed by the director
to be too good to be omitted. In add
ition, a number of the song hits from
past productions of Ram's Head So
ciety have been selected by David
Mannoccir, director of the show, as
sisted by Dave Lamson and Mike Ely,
the authors, for rendition in this di
vision of the play.
Among the old-time hits which will
be given revivals are "Candlelight,"
"My Little Bungalow," and "Ole Vent
Avay." "Candlelight," probably the
greatest song hit of "Koo Koo Kubis-

town," was written £|fc<pick Midgley,
with a l?ric from jtm> pen of Dan
Evans. Evans are ac
credited with having been the best
song-writing combination which Stan
ford has ever produced. Evans is re
membered by the present college gen
eration as a co-author of "The Devil's
Daughter," last year's Ram's Head
show. The song is introduced into the
present production by Len Schwartz
and Pat Kelly, assisted by the pony
chorus.
"My Little Bungalow" is an old
Ram's Head song which has been of
ten revived in such campus produc
tions as Alumni Day and Track Meet
shows; it is a tuneful sentimental
number which ranks with the best
music of campus composers; the lyric
is also excellent. Llewellyn Forrest,
leading man of "So This Is Eden,"
Junior Opera of 1923, and By Kissing
er, who sang in last year's opera, sing
the song in close harmony, rendering
one chorus quite comparable to the
famous vocal duet in Irving Berlin's
"Who," which "My Little Bungalow"
resembles in type. "Ole Vent Avay"
was the unquestionable song hit of
"The Merchant of Menace." Its theme
is the plaint of a buxom Swedish
maiden who has been deserted by her
Norse lover. The song will be sung in
"Ray! Ray! Rover Boys" by Charles
Simons, who acquired the encore rec
ord of the 1924 show by his manner
of presentation.
