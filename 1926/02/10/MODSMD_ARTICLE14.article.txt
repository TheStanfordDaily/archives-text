Pitchers Are Capable
The varsity team will be one of the
heaviest-hitting aggregations that
Stanford has put on a diamond in a
long time. A staff of capable pitchers
who are still improving adds to the
strength of the outfit. There are sev
eral men of first-class ability strug
gling for each position on the team,
so Wolter's chief worry is which to
leave out. Stanford could put two or
three nines on the field that would be
almost on a par with each other in
every department of the game.
The lineup for Saturday afternoon
will probably be as follows: Oviatt
pitcher; Sypher, catcher; Johnston,
first base; Garibaldi, second base;
Cuddeback, third base; and Bush,
shortstop. The outfield is still unde
cided.
Oviatt Stars
Oviatt has been showing great form
in his twirling during the last few
days. He has to in order to have the
edge on the three pitchers from last
year's freshman team who are getting
better every day, and do not seem to
be nearing their limit. These are
Phillippi, Sobieski, and Reynolds.
