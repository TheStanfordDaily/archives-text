# NED ANDERSON OUT OF NEVADA SERIES WITH ANKLE INJURY
## X-Ray Shows Chipped Bone; Kerr Grooming Man for Standing Guard 
### Jim Adams 
With Ned Anderson laid up with » n
ankle believed to be broken, Coach
Andy Kerr is confronted with t* lo
problem of grooming a standing guard
to take his place, if he is unable to
compete in the California games. An
derson injured his ankle in th< second
half of the initial U.S.C. game last
week, and x-ray pictures reveal a
chipped bone. The""accuracy ot the
pictures has been questioned. a ncl
there is a poßsibilit>\_that the bone
is not bßOkeh'but only bruised. He
will be absent from the lineup tomor
row night when r the Cards meet Ne
vada. v >
If the injury is not serious, * ie wi "
probably be 'able to play in the games
with the Bears. His " loss would he a
serious blow to the Cards as h G f° rnls
the backbone of the defense, and al
though Newhouse and Biaginni ar<
good and played splendid .ball in the
South they are not of the same calibi >>
as Anderson. Kerr tried Steele at
standing guard in scrimmage last night
and may use him there if necessar>.
Reserves Show Class
One of the most gratifying features
of the victorious play last week was
the class exhibited by the reserves.
Everyone was used in almost all the
games and each player came through
in great style. It was the reserve team
that gave the Grizzlies an even battle
in the first half of the Southern
Branch game and the same group that,
rushed in on the tired Trojans in the
I second game and paved the w r ay lor
the regulars to come back strong and
! snatch a victory.
] Lack of capable substitutes has al
ways been a handicap to Kerr ii com
petition with California. This yea" ie
plact of any rpgnlar could be fii M '
without greatly weakening the lineu
with the possible exception of the
standing guard berth. Even in the lat
ter position either Newhouse or Biag
; gini fits in nicely with the first five.
Opposition Will Be Strong
Tomorrow night the Stanford quin
tet will tackle the Nevada team and
j will play a second game with them
! Saturday evening. Although the Wolf
j Pack is expected to give the Cards
! some tough opposition, the Redsliirts
are doped to take the two games with
out extending themselves to the limit.
Kerr gave his men a rest Monday
night and is watching their condition
closely in order to have them in the
best of shape for the second California
| game at Oakland a week from Satur
[ day night.
