With today's issue of the Daily Palo Alto five staff members receive
rewards, in the form of promotions, for work they have done for the
paper.
Florence Gallagher drops her duties as a Desk Editor and assumes
those of the Women's Editor. Miss Gallagher has been a member of
the staff for only a year but this has been long enough for her to
demonstrate that she is capable of supervising the work of the women
newsgatherers.
The work of the Managing Editor will be done by Harry Bennett.
He has spent nearly two years on the Daily doing good, conscientious
work, both as a reporter and an executive. He will be concerned chiefly
with the technical end of the paper; but as he is thoroughly familiar
with the work of the news staff, he should be able to link the two
branches of the publication efficiently.
Douglas Meservey emerges from the ranks of the desk editors with
the title of Assistant Editor. Two and a half years of writing experience
on the Daily should make him an invaluable assistant in conducting the
editorial column. His position will also call for executive work in the
news v organization
Because the editor feels that there has long been a need for someone
directly supervise the work of the reporters and the desk editors he
has created a new title and along with it a new job. Alfred Post will
be given both the name and worries of the Chief News Editor. Post
has covered a wide range of territory in his two years of service, and
has come into intimate contact with all fields from which the paper
gleans its stories.
Isabel Schanck, who has for some time been at the top of the list
of reporters, will today find her name under the caption of Desk Editor.
Her signature the past few months has been attached to the largest part
of the articles dealing with dramatics.
