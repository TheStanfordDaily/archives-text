Assuming that it were possible, it would be undesirable for the
editor of a college paper to lay down in advance a definite course of
procedure. College conditions are constantly shifting, and the paper
must shift with them. We can only speculate what the course of events
will be on the morrow. So, at the outset it is sufficient to say that for
the next five months we will attempt information rather than reforma
tion.
Reading the papers of other universities has given us the impres
sion that nine times out of ten Stanford is abreast of the modern educa
tional trend. The tenth time it is ahead.
When the occasion arises for comment on matters which may at the
time look gigantic but which will later undoubtedly shrink into minute
ness, we shall endeavor not to become verbally pugnacious. A light,
humorous treatment is often times more effective.
As in the past, campus opinion will be welcomed, providing that
the writer makes his identity known, and confines his thoughts to 200
wor d s —less if possible. Communications that bring up a new problem
will be every bit as acceptable as those which rehash what has already
transpired. Criticism of our methods is the only way we have to measure
our success or failure; so if you do not wish to write your views, feel
at liberty to drop into the office at any time and give them to us orally.
