# SPORTS OF 1926
## Mermaids Hold Sway 
### "FEG" MURP 
This seems to be ladies' week in the world of sports.
There's the Helen-vs.-Suzanne controversey at Cannes, the
women's indoor swimming and diving championships at St.
Augustine, and Valentine's day coming next Sunday! To
day let's take a peek at the peaches who navigate via the
sixbeat-trudgeon crawl stroke (sounds very vegetarian) or
who dive in graceful arcs and curves from the lucky spring
board.
A glance at the list of entries in the various events
now in progress at the oldest city in the United States
gives one the impression that, while natatorial ability and
pulchitrude are there in abundance, something is lacking.
What is it, or rather who are they? None other than the
three Graces of the swimming world, Helen Wainwright,
Aileen Riggin, and Gertrude Ederle, all turned professional
in the year 1925. Imagine a national swimming champion-

ship without Helen, Aileen, and Gertrude! A close study of the results of the
meet at St. Augustine last year, however, will show that, while Miss Wain
wright copped more than her share of honors with over twenty-one points
to lier credit, neither Aileen nor Gertrude was able to win a first place.
But they will be missed, nevertheless.
But how the remaining champions have gathered for the various events!
From far-off Hawaii has come Mariechen Wehselau, Olympic record holder at
100 meters. California has sent Mrs. Clarence Pinkston, nee Betty Becker,
Olympic diving champion; and Eleanor Garrati, the sensation of the meet last
year. Chicago has its two standbys, Sybil Bauer, world's backstroke champion,
and Ethel Lackie, who recently broke the world's record for 100 yards with a
new mark of 1 minute, 2 4-sth seconds.
The question seems to be: Can the Women's Swimming Association of
New York win the team championship again in spite of the loss of their three
most famous mermaids? Agnes Geraglity, Ethel McGary, Helen Meany,
Martha Norelius, and other leading stars of the W.S.A. answer "Aye." But
the eyes don't always have it, in the case of a bathing girl.
FEG MURRAY SAYSâ€”
There is an Oriental prizefighter, a former laundryman, no doubt,
named Hip Sing Lee. "No tickee, no sockee!"
