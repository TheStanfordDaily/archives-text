# STUDENTS OFFERED FELLOWSHIPS FOR PHYSICAL RESEARCH
## 
### 
La Fayette College, Easton, Pa., an- j
nounces two fellowships of $500 and I
$750 respectively in Physical Chemis
try to be awarded to American or !
Canadian College students that have
had training equivalent to a degree of
Bachelor of Science in Chemistry at j
that college.
Holders of the fellowship are not;
expected to pay tuition, are not per
mitted to enter upon other gainful oc
cupation, and are not to be called upon
for teaching duties. The work can be
counted upon for advanced degree.
Each fellow will devote the greater
portion of his time to the pursuance j
of a research problem.
The research is generally theoretical i
in character, being related to the fun- j
damental properties of fluidity, plas- i
ticity, and elasticity, but sometimes ;
it is of a more practical character
when an attempt is made to correlate
the property of plasticity with those
somewhat vaguely used terms in vari-1
ous industries, such as consistency, I
workability, hardness, and shortness. |
Applications, giving in regard to!
training, character, and experience a
statement which will enable the Re
search Committee to judge on the
merits of the candidates, should be !
addressed to Eugene C. Bingham, i
chairman of the Research Committee, j
The applicant should also submit his j
photograph and letters of recom- 1
mendation and references.
