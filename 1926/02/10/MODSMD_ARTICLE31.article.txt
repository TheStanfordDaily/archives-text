# QUAD VERSES SHOW JOYS, SORROWS OF STANFORD PIONEERS

### Clifford Weigle 
The history of the pioneer class of
Stanford University, the class of 1895,
is chiefly a story of "beginnings." Com
ing to a new university with no foun
dation of tradition to build on, these
pioneers started right in to establish
them. As a result they founded many
customs which are still in existence,
and which will probably last for many
years to come.
The most notable achievement of
that first class to finish a full four
year course at the University was the
conception and publication of the first
Stanford Quad; which they named the
Quad because, as they said, "in the
Stanford Quadrangle is embodied the
nucleus of the University settlement
and sentiment."
Burn Midnight Oil
The class of '95 set the example of
burning the midnight tallow in En
cina; they were the first to decorate
the water tank in '92, and successfully
defended their rights against the class
of *96 in the first class rush which
took place in 1893.
Society at the University during
the first year, 1891, was in a rather
unsettled state. There were no large
parties and very few small ones, ac
cording to the "society editor" of the
day, who said, "An occasional recep
tion, perhaps, like the Martha Wash
ington, where boys in abundance were
the chief attraction, or a reception to
the faculty, where there was no chief
attraction at all, but a most monto
nous dullness, comprised the society
events at first."
Social Life Unsettled
But with the second year began a
constant whirl of "gaiety, jollity, fun,
and frivolity." Afternoon teas given by
the professors' wives, Kappa Alpha
Theta "At Homes," Kappa Kappa
Gamma Hallowe'en parties, Phi Gamma
Delta parties in their new home, and
"Phi Psi," Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and
Phi Delta Theta dances comprised a
full social program. But the climax of
this gay whirl was the grand Zeta
Psi hop at the old Hotel Vendome in
San Jo6e.
That these early social functions
were rather primitive and full of in
conveniences, might be judged from
the following verse clipped from the
Quad of 1895:
"ENCINA'S FIRST RECEPTION"
Dripping, dripping, dark and dreary,
Slipping, tripping, cold and skeery,
Homeward to the lights of lloble
Maiden helpeth maiden nobly.
While upon the wind it groaneth,
'It was from Encina's first reception,
We were coming home alone!'
Fainter yet it waileth, moaneth,
'From Encina's last reception.
We are coming home alone!'"
Another crude verse from the same
Quad portrays some of the difficulties
of pioneering on the Row:
"No rug, no dish, no bedding,
No water and no light;
No soap, of course no towels,
No furniture in sight;
No chimney and no cooking stove,
No hammer, hatchet, nails;
No pictures, books, no music—
Ah, yea, the pussy wails!
No food but crackers: friends to tea,
No ice, nowhere to go;
But, oh, the«fun that we did have,
Pioneering on the Row."
Yet another rhyme, this one by
Charlie Field, proves beyond doubt
that the 170 graduates in the pioneer
class of Stanford had a thoroughly
good time, even though they didn't
have Fords, ukuleles, Charleston con
tests, and home brew:
"Dear chum of mine, do you recall,
When college had begun.
The gladness of that glorious fall,
And how we spent the 'mon'?
The Days of Cheer, The Days of Beer,
The Days of '91.
Dear maid of mine, do you recall
When first my heart you won,
There were no lights in Roble Hall,
But, oh, such loads of fun?
The Days of Dark, The Days of Spark,
The Days of '91.

dation of tradition to build on, these
pioneers started right in to establish
them. As a result they founded many
customs which are still in existence,
and which will probably last for many
years to come.
The most notable achievement of
that first class to finish a full four
year course at the University was the
conception and publication of the first
Stanford Quad; which they named the
Quad because, as they said, "in the
Stanford Quadrangle is embodied the
nucleus of the University settlement
and sentiment."
Burn Midnight Oil
The class of '95 set the example of
burning the midnight tallow in En
cina; they were the first to decorate
the water tank in '92, and successfully
defended their rights against the class
of *96 in the first class rush which
took place in 1893.
Society at the University during
the first year, 1891, was in a rather
unsettled state. There were no large
parties and very few small ones, ac
cording to the "society editor" of the
day, who said, "An occasional recep
tion, perhaps, like the Martha Wash
ington, where boys in abundance were
the chief attraction, or a reception to
the faculty, where there was no chief
attraction at all, but a most monto
nous dullness, comprised the society
events at first."
Social Life Unsettled
But with the second year began a
constant whirl of "gaiety, jollity, fun,
and frivolity." Afternoon teas given by
the professors' wives, Kappa Alpha
Theta "At Homes," Kappa Kappa
Gamma Hallowe'en parties, Phi Gamma
Delta parties in their new home, and
"Phi Psi," Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and
Phi Delta Theta dances comprised a
full social program. But the climax of
this gay whirl was the grand Zeta
Psi hop at the old Hotel Vendome in
San Jo6e.
That these early social functions
were rather primitive and full of in
conveniences, might be judged from
the following verse clipped from the
Quad of 1895:
"ENCINA'S FIRST RECEPTION"
Dripping, dripping, dark and dreary,
Slipping, tripping, cold and skeery,
Homeward to the lights of lloble
Maiden helpeth maiden nobly.
While upon the wind it groaneth,
'It was from Encina's first reception,
We were coming home alone!'
Fainter yet it waileth, moaneth,
'From Encina's last reception.
We are coming home alone!'"
Another crude verse from the same
Quad portrays some of the difficulties
of pioneering on the Row:
"No rug, no dish, no bedding,
No water and no light;
No soap, of course no towels,
No furniture in sight;
No chimney and no cooking stove,
No hammer, hatchet, nails;
No pictures, books, no music—
Ah, yea, the pussy wails!
No food but crackers: friends to tea,
No ice, nowhere to go;
But, oh, the«fun that we did have,
Pioneering on the Row."
Yet another rhyme, this one by
Charlie Field, proves beyond doubt
that the 170 graduates in the pioneer
class of Stanford had a thoroughly
good time, even though they didn't
have Fords, ukuleles, Charleston con
tests, and home brew:
"Dear chum of mine, do you recall,
When college had begun.
The gladness of that glorious fall,
And how we spent the 'mon'?
The Days of Cheer, The Days of Beer,
The Days of '91.
Dear maid of mine, do you recall
When first my heart you won,
There were no lights in Roble Hall,
But, oh, such loads of fun?
The Days of Dark, The Days of Spark,
The Days of '91.
