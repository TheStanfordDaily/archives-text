# COL. MITCHELL TRIAL TOPIC OF EUPHRONIA DEBATERS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Euphronia Debating Society's sec
ond bi-weekly debate will be held this
evening at 7:30 o'clock in the lobby
of (he Old Union, members of the so
ciety debating on the question, "Re
solved, That this house is opposed to
the principle underlying the Mitchell
trial." Members of Euphronia and
those interested in the topic are in
vited to attend the meeting.
The debate this evening is one of a
series planned by the organization for
the quarter. A motion which has first
been approved and announced by the
president is submitted at a meeting
of the society and is seconded by a
member. The man making the motion
is allowed to give the opening speech,
to be followed by the leader of the
opposition, the member seconding the
motion, and a second speaker for the
opposition. The debate will then be
open to any member who wishes to
speak, and the motion will be dis
cussed until there are no further mem
bers wishing to talk or until the time
for closing the debate.
The purpose of this plan is to stim
ulate real interest in debating, not as
a mere matter of competition with
other organizations or with other uni
versities, but as an end in itself, to be
indulged in by its devotees for their
own pleasure and for no other reason.
The plan endeavors to combine a good
debate with free discussion.
