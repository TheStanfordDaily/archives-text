# VERNE DODSON, BRUIN JAVELIN ACE, WILL COMPETE THIS YEAR
## 
### 
University of California, Feb. 9. â€”
Practical certainty of point-scoring in
the javelin event has been assured
with the announcement that Vern
Dodson would be eligible for this
year's California track team. Dodson
was ineligible last season and com
peted for the Olympic Club of San
Francisco, under whose colors the
husky spear tosser defeated the best
the Golden Bears had to offer in this
event.
Charles Willi, one of the most prom
ising sprinters who was expected to
turn out for Walt Christie's team, is
not in college this season. He has
entered business with his father, but
there is a chance that he will return
to the squad next semester for foot
ball.
Meanwhile the brunt of the sprint
ing will fall on the flashy feet of
Captain Phil Barber, who is expected
to enjoy his best season under the
Blue and Gold.

The interfraternity council at the
University of North Dakota has
banned the wearing of corsages at
the 1926 junior prom.
