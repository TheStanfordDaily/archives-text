# BEARS MEET BRANCH, U.S.C. BEFORE NEXT STANFORD CONTEST
## 
### 
University of California, Feb. 9. —
Gilding the lily, so to speak, Stanford's
victory over the University of South
ern California adds new interest to
the coming game between the Cali
fornia and Cardinal quintets. The next
game of the "Big Series" is slated
for February 20, but meanwhile the
Bears have two important engage
ments to fill.
The Bears will probably leave Thurs
day evening for Los Angeles and while
in the South will tackle the U.S.C.
Trojans and the Southern Branch.
The Trojans, although the Bears de
feated them twice, could cause plenty
of trouble by trouncing the Blue and
Gold although they are out of the run
ning themselves.
The game with the Branch team, al
though no championship is in the
offing; appears formidable to the
Bears. California's record of not being
defeated this season stands a good
chance of being shattered by the
Grizzlies, as earlier in the season the
Cards fell before the same quintet,
as did Idaho and Utah Aggies.
Walker Mills, who has been filling
in for Vern Carver the last two games,
is doing well, and if Carver does not
recover from his injured ankle he may
find plenty of competition in winning
his berth back again.
