# DRAMATIC REVIEWS PAGE IS CHAPPIE'S NEWEST ADDITION
## 
### 
As a special feature to be in
augurated in the forthcoming
Valentine Number, "Chaparral"
will publish a page of dramatic
reviews. The page will be some
what similar to those contained
in "Judge," "Life," and other
humorous publications of an
equal calibre, and is intended to
be as accurate a guide to San
Francisco and campus produc
tions as are the pages conducted
by George Jean Nathan and Rob
ert Bencliley to the plays on
Broadway.
"Our main difficulty," says
Greg Williamson, editor of Chap
pie, "is the problem of acquiring
in two weeks the bored, blas6 at
titude of the New York review
ers, who devote about twenty of
the best years of their lives to
its acquisition. However, the Old
Boy will do his best to make up
for lost time."
