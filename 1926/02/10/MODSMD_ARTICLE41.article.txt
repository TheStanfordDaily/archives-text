Tickets for the second campus con
cert of the San Francisco Sypmhony
Orchestra went on sale yesterday at
the Stanford Bookstore and at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto. The orchestra,
under the direction of Dr. Alfred
Hertz, will play here at 8:15 o'clock
the night of Tuesday, February 16.
The entire orchestra of 95 pieces,

The four numbers selected for the
concert on February 16 are taken from
among the most popular concert num
bers in the literature of orchestra
music. Tchaikowsky's Fourth Sym
phony will be the chief work on the
program. It was composed in 1878 and
held a foremost place in the affections
of its composer who held it to be his
finest work. It is unique among the
works of the usually melancholy Tchai
kowsky for its humorous touches,
which are remarkable considering the
general depressed state of mind of
its great composer.
The first of the four movements of
the symphony has a stately and ma
jestic opening theme. After it closes
with great vigor and force. The second
movement is one of the most fasci
nating Tchaikowsky ever wrote be
cause of its beautiful melody. The
third movement, a scherzo, is unique
for the pizzicato manner in which all
the stringed instruments are played
throughout its course.
The finale is a brilliant allegro
movement opening with a stately
theme played by full orchestra. Three
themes are introduced in the course
of the movement opening with a state
ly theme played by full orchestra.
Three themes are introduced in the
course of the movement and developed
in the brilliant manner that was char
acteristic of Tchaikowsky. Effects
ranging from pianissimo to very loud
are heard and the close is a tremen
dous outburst of energy.
Besides the symphony three other
numbers will be played: "The Sor
cerer's Apprentice" by Paul Dukas,
"Danse Macabre by Camille Saint
Saens, and Overture to * the opera
"Euryanthe."

which are remarkable considering the
general depressed state of mind of
its great composer.
The first of the four movements of
the symphony has a stately and ma
jestic opening theme. After it closes
with great vigor and force. The second
movement is one of the most fasci
nating Tchaikowsky ever wrote be
cause of its beautiful melody. The
third movement, a scherzo, is unique
for the pizzicato manner in which all
the stringed instruments are played
throughout its course.
The finale is a brilliant allegro
movement opening with a stately
theme played by full orchestra. Three
themes are introduced in the course
of the movement opening with a state
ly theme played by full orchestra.
Three themes are introduced in the
course of the movement and developed
in the brilliant manner that was char
acteristic of Tchaikowsky. Effects
ranging from pianissimo to very loud
are heard and the close is a tremen
dous outburst of energy.
Besides the symphony three other
numbers will be played: "The Sor
cerer's Apprentice" by Paul Dukas,
"Danse Macabre by Camille Saint
Saens, and Overture to * the opera
"Euryanthe."
Tickets for the second campus con

The entire orchestra of 95 pieces,

a program of four numbers.
Tickets are priced at $1.25, $1.75,
and $2.25. Seats will be sold in the

recital will be the final appearance of
the orchestra in the Assembly hall this
season. On the evening of Founders'
Day, March 9, it will play in the
Memorial Church in a memorial con
cert presented by the University.
The four numbers selected for the
concert on February 16 are taken from
among the most popular concert num
bers in the literature of orchestra
music. Tchaikowsky's Fourth Sym
phony will be the chief work on the
program. It was composed in 1878 and
held a foremost place in the affections
of its composer who held it to be his
finest work. It is unique among the
works of the usually melancholy Tchai
kowsky for its humorous touches,
which are remarkable considering the
general depressed state of mind of
its great composer.
