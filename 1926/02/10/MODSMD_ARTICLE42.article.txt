# EASTERN COLLEGES DIVIDE OVER CLASS ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
## 
### 
The system of non-compulsory class
attendance for seniors recently inaugu
rated at Harvard lias raised a storm
of student press opinion throughout
the country, and has divided univer
sity authorities into two sharply de
fined conservative and radical groups.
"By the time a student reaches the
classification of a senior, he should be
able to weigh the value of a classroom
lecture and conduct himself according
ly," says the Daily Kansan, in advo
cating an adaptation of the Harvard
system for the University of Kansas.
It is rumored that many of the
upperclassmen at Brown are consider
ing transferring to the more liberal
institutions, since Brown has met the
Yale-Harvard movement with "an
extra quantity of summonses." This
seems to argue that if half of the
American colleges are half free that
the majority of the adventuresome,
intellectually self-reliant students will
be found in the liberal universities.
A survey of student opinion on lec
tures, classes, and the Harvard system
has been made by the Silver and Gold,
the University of Colorado publication.
Men prominent in scholarship and ac
tivities, and the ordinary run of stu
dents were interviewed. The concen
sus of opinion seemed to be that too
often professors' lectures give the
student nothing which he cannot gain
from reading or facts which the stu
dent memorizes but does not under
stand.
Smith College has also been aroused
by the Yale-Harvard movement. The
Smith faculty voted to grant the privi
lege of regulating class attendance to
the whole college with the exception
of a small group on the registrar's
list. This system has been in opera
tion at Smith since last September.
Smith is the only college which is giv
ing these privileges to all four classes.
Harvard and Yale hope to extend the
privileges to include juniors and
sophomores, but they feel that their
freshmen will never be capable of
withstanding the 'temptation of un
limited cuts.
