# ST. MARY'S FROSH OPPOSE YEARLING CAGE FIVE TONIGHT
## Hunt's Men Beat Palo Alto High School Squad in Practice Tilt 
### Cliff McDowell 
Saint Mary's freshman quintet will
oppose the Stanford frosh tonight in
the usual mid-week game. The contest
will start at 8 o'clock, following the
preliminary game by the 145-pound
team.
Hunt's men had a hard workout yes
terday when they scrimmaged the
Palo Alto High School team. The prac
tice game ended 17 to 7 in favor of
the frosh. Hunt used almost his entire
squad in the game, trying to find the
best combination to use in the next
California freshman game.
Worden, who started yesterday, has
been doing most of the work at stand
ing guard, but is wealf on defensive
playing. Palo Alto was' able to make
many close-in shots that would prove
disastrous in a close contest. Robb,
playing the other guard position, has
shown the best defensive form on the
squad. It was Robb's defensive play
ing that kept the score to one field
goal in the Salinas High School game
last Saturday.
While no starting lineup has been
announced by Hunt for tonight's game
it is almost certain that McCandless
will be in his usual position at center.
McCandless has been the most con
sistent player on the squad this season
and has captured high-point honors in
all but one game.
Davis, Sibbett, Sexson, and Renzel
are making the race for the forward
positions fast and furious. So far none
of these men have an edge on the
jobs, although Renzel has displayed
more real basketball in the last two
games than any of the other candi
dates.
Hunt will probably change his men
frequently in the game tonight, giving
as many as possible a chance to show
their worth.
