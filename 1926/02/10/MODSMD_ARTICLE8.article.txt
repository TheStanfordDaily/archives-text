# DAVIS ANNOUNCES CASE OF ENGLISH CLUB PRODUCTION
## Lloyd Nolan, Helen Lewis Are Selected to Play Leads In "Green Goddess" 
### Frank Baker 
Principal roles for "The Green God
dess," the English Club play being
presented in the Assembly hall on
March 5, were announced last night;
by Gordon Davis. Not all of the minor j
parts have been chosen yet, as it is
necessary to have another special try- j
out for people who can speak an Eng
lish dialect or the mottled English of
the natives of Hindustan.
Lloyd Nolan, as the Rajah Rukh,
has the leading part. He hardly needs
any introduction to the Stanford stage,
for he has been in numerous campus '
productions of a varied nature. This
year he played the principal part in
"What Price Phi Bete?" the one-act j
satire written by Dave Lamson for j
Football Gaieties, and was also in a j
blackface skit in the same show. No- i
lan has had vaudeville experience be- j
sides his work on the campus, and he
promises to carry the role created by
George Arliss in a very polished man
ner.
Wiggin Plays Comic Part
Jack Wiggin will be seen in one of
his comic impersonations of a cockney
Englishman. He is Watkins, valet to
the Rajah. Wiggin has lived in Bom- i
bay, India, for a considerable time j
and is familiar with several cockney
dialects. His interpretation of the part
of Willie, in last year's Junior Opera,
a riotously dumb young man, was con
sidered one of the best pieces of work
during the year. His knowledge of
India should also be a help in putting
native atmosphere into the play.
Major Crespin, D.S.C., an English J
army officer, is being played by Garth |
Winslow, who made Ins debut on the :
campus stage last quarter in the i
Sophomore play, "In the Next Room." j
Sam Hayes, a freshman, is to have!
the other leading male role, Dr. Basil
Trail erne. Hayes has never been in a
campus production yet, so his progress !
will be eagerly watched by those in
terested in dramatics.
Helen Lewis Has Lead
The only woman lead will be taken
by Helen Lewis, as Lucilla, wife of
Major Crespin. Miss Lewis has done
acting since a year ago last fall, when j
she played the feminine lead in'
"R.U.R." She has a depth of feeling
and a quiet, calm assurance on the
stage that ranks her as one of the j
most pleasing actresses on the cam-!
pus.
The parts of an aviator, several high j
priests, elders, who are advisors to'
the Rajah, native soldiers, and other â– 
minor roles have not been chosen, i
Davis has not set the date for his I
special tryout, but it will be very soon,>
as there is an abundance of important
mob work requiring some very capa-1
ble actors and difficult directing.
