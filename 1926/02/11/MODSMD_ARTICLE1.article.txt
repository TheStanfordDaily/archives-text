# CARDINALS EXPECT HARD GAME FROM WOLF PACK SQUAD
## Ned Anderson's Injury Will Keep Him Out For Rest Of Season 
### Jim Adams 
Nevada's basketball team should
provide the Cards with a fast and
hard-fought game tonight when the
two quintets meet in the pavilion at
8 o'clock, although Stanford is favored
to win. A number of experienced play
ers are included in the lineup of the
Wolf Pack, and judging by the games
with California last week they require
their opponents to be on guard every
minute.
The Redshirts have progressed to a
finished stage, and need only a little
polishing before they will be ready
for California next week. The games
with Nevada tonight and Saturday
evening should provide Kerr with the
means to brighten up a few places in
the Cards' playing. With a few excep
tions every man on the team at pres
ent is playing the best basketball of
the season.
Anderson's Bone Broken
One gloomy event mars the bright
outlook of beating California, and that
occurred yesterday when a second set
of x-ray pictures of Anderson's ankle
verified the first, showing a chipped
bone. According to the physician,
Andy will watch both California
games from the sidelines. This dis
appointment prevents the Cards from
showing their greatest strength to the
Bears, but has only made the Stanford
players more determined. Kerr will
use Biaggini at standing guard to
night.
The Redshirts may get something
to worry about, however, if Nevada
goes as it did in the first California
game last week. Coach Nibs Price had
to rush in his regulars in the last half,
after playing the reserves most of the
time, in order to put the Bears on
the long end of the 26-20 score. Cali
fornia won the second affair 39-10.
Know Stanford's Play
Last year the Wolf Pack brought a
strong, experienced squad down to
Palo Alto and gave Stanford a pair
of close tilts. A number of veterans
are on this year's five and are ac
quainted with the pavilion court and
Stanford's style of play. Fredericks
and Goodale have had four and three
years of varsity experience respec
tively, while Watson has had two.
Coach Kerr is greatly pleased with
the progress Bill Clark has made this
season and has a lot of confidence in
the sophomore. He has the admirable
quality of making baskets when they
are most needed. Captain Price seemed
to have hit his stride in the South
last week, and is playing his usual
steady game, which makes him valu
able on both the defense and offense.
David received a setback with his re
cent illness but is rounding into shape
so that next week should find him in
lip-top form.
The Card line-up as announced by
Kerr is: Price and Clark, forwards;
Jayred, center; and Vincenti and Biag
gini, guards.
