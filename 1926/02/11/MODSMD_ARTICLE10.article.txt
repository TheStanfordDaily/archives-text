# Rover Burlesque Shows Finish In Dress Rehearsal
## 
### 
Dress rehearsal of the Ram's Head
show, "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," nearly
raised the roof last night with laugh- j
ter and applause from the few on-1
lookers. The rehearsal demonstrated
that the performances tomorrow and j
Saturday nights will be all that a
critical audience will want in the form
of real comedy.
Dave Mannoccir, who is directing
the show, has had experience both as

an actor and a di-'
rector. He directed ;
Ram's Head last year i
and has been in sev
eral campus produc
tions, besides doing
work of a similar na
ture in Pasadena. He
has a number of ex
perienced men to
work with in the
principal roles, and
their- knowledge of
acting has made a
more than usually
polished show.
Charles Parks, tak- \

ing the part of the first Rover boy, is j
! the most experienced actor on the
! campus. He co-starred with Gordon
Davis in "The Importance of Being
Earnest," and has been in presenta-j
| tions of a varied nature for the past|
: four years. Leonard Schwartz, the sec
| ond Rover, made his campus debut in
; "You and I" last year and has been
i seen in several plays since. A1 Cass
makes his first appearance tomorrow
night; he has a faculty of putting over
pure nonsense with the nonchalance
j of an old actor.
Pat Kelly and Mel Lindsay have a
delicate touch in playing the femine
leads. Kelly took a prominent part in
"The Devil's Daughter" last year.
George Eardley and Lee Flood in j
blackface parts have both been seen :
: in plays and skits this year.
