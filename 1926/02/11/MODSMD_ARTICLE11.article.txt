# DEFEATS DAMPEN HOPES OF NEVADA BASKETBALL TEAM
## 
### 
University of Nevada, Feb. 10. â€”The
1 University of Nevada basketball team
I leaves Reno tonight to engage Stan
ford University at Palo Alto in a
two-game series tomorrow and Satur
' day. Eight men will accompany Coach
Martie on the third Coast invasion of
the Wolves.
The defeats received at the hands
of California have in no way dam
pened the fight of the sagebrush team.
I Martie is very emphatic in not con
ceding victory to Stanford. In his
opinion if the Wolves can find the
; basket as in games previous to the
ones with the Golden Bear, the Cardi
nals will have to play basketball for
j every point chalked on their side of
I the book.
The same lineup that has repre
sented Nevada in past encounters will
! probably take the floor for the op-en
! ing tip-off: Fredericks and Goodale at
forwards, Watson at center, and
Bream and Clover at guards. In the
| California game Fredericks and Clo
i ver were conceded by several Coast
papers to be the pair largely responsi
ble for the impressive showing of the
Wolves, and they will undoubtedly
;cause plenty of doubt for several
hours at Palo Alto.
Nevada is being led by St. Mary's
in the Far West Conference, and the
form with which the Wolves emerge
| from the Stanford contests should be
a fairly reliable criterion of their
showing for the remainder of the sea
j son.
