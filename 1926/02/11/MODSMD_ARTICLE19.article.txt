Reports that have drifted into the Daily office recently indicate that
the humorous magazines in many of the Pacific Coast universities are be
ing drowned by a reform wave. Some of the comics so submerged have in
reality committed suicide; and others, whose policies have been less offen
sive, are battling manfully against the tide of faculty wrath.
The report has come in twice within the past few weeks that our neigh
bors across the bay have been purged of printed evil. "Faculty mouth
wash" has likewise been substituted for the traditional "faculty axe" at
the University of Southern California, the University of Washington, and
the University of Oregon.
At U.S.C. The li'ainpus was suppressed for an issue, and the editor
and manager requested not to re-register in the university for the new
semester; rather than be subjected to a gag rule, Columns at the Univer
sity of Washington has left the campus, and an attempt is being made to
publish it elsewhere. At Berkeley the English Club, co-publishers with
Hammer and Coffin Society of Pclican, has withdrawn from the campus,
and has threatened to take with it the comic, which itself did not escape
censure from the Executive Committee at the recent clean-up.
It is an entire impossibility to give an opinion as to whether or not the
tactics that have been resorted to by the authorities have been justifiable.
Nevertheless, it is clear that there are certain standards of good taste and
decency which a publication representing a university must maintain.
Fortunately, at Stanford, we are confronted by no such problems as
those which vex our neighbors up and down the coast. Chaparral has
demonstrated that a college humorous publication can please both students
and faculty, can l>e both spicy and pure, without suffering a decline in
quality or popularity. Three volumes, containing twenty-seven numbers
of "Chappie" have been published in the last three years with the receipt
of only two "We regret to inform you" letters from the President's office.
Likewise the four issues of the present year have escaped without censure.
The Old Boy is to be congratulated upon such a record. The fact that
Chaparral has not only managed to keep out of the gutter and up on the
curbstone, but has also achieved national approbation from' eminently
qualified critics, of the calibre of Judge and Vanity Fair, should serve as
an indictment to its less wholesome and less fortunate contemporaries.
