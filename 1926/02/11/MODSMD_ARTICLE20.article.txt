# Give Them a Chance

### 
Sorority chatter is beginning to take on the feverish, exciting, sleepless
atmosphere that always marks the approach of women's rushing. The
man who is wise will turn his thoughts to poker or stag movies until the
melee is over. Heaven pity the man who openly rushes for a house, and
then finds that something went wrong and his "nugget" went elsewhere.
We have heard stories of groups of men who, after alcohol had re
moved their inhibitions, made a wager that they could turn certain women
from one house to another during the last few days of rushing. They
succeeded only too well, much to the discomfort of the women who were
left on the sack end of the proposition.
Women have enough trouble in their selection of new classes without
having to cross swords with the master snake who moulds the mind of the
illusioned freshman woman like so much clay, or the disappointed date
seeker who is out to get even. We will admit that in some cases certain
men materially influence the choices of new women who rely on their
experience and alleged knowledge of the "inside." Too often sorority
women take to the hospital after a strenuous and disappointing rushing
season, and it is hardly fair to them to have their task made harder by
meddlesome and efficacious men.
And on the rushee's side of the question the same rule holds. Tt is a
hard decision for most women, and since it is they and not the men who
have to live in the houseâ€”why not let them meet the problem themselves,
and decide without hindrance from those who have ulterior motives in
sending them a particular way ?
