# SPORTS OF 1926
## Young Lochinvar 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The saying that "Youth will be served" is an old gag
in reference to lawn tennis, but it is especially appropriate
in the case of Cranston Holman, the young collegian from
California who served so well and so often that he was
ranked eighth among the players of the nation after his
first and only season on the turf courts of the East. And
it wasn't a full season at that, for Cranston had to go back
to the Coast before the national singles tournament got
under way, while, if he had played as well in that as he did
in other events, he might have been ranked even higher.
Followers of the court game were reminded of Robert
Lindley Murray, the sensational southpaw, who, like Hol
man, also invaded the East while a young student at Stan
ford University and scored such a big hit among the tennis
elite. He was ranked fourth in 1914, and four years later
beat Rill Tilden for the national title. Will young Holman

have the same success that young Murray had? He must take good care of
himself to do so.
The experts were united in praise of Cranston, and all predicted a bright
future for him as a tournament player. He was runner-up in the intercolle
r'a>> tournament, played exceptionally well in the East-West matches, de- j
feated the one and only Bill Tilden (who was handicapped with a lame
shoulder), and easily won the junior championship in Chicago in August.
Among those whom he beat during the summer were Ray Casey, John Hen-!
nessey, and his tutor, Howard Kinsey.
Holman has a fine forehand, a good service and overhead, and he has j
plenty of time to develop his volley and backhand strokes. He is a fine court
coverer, his tactics are splendid—and he comes from California, whence come
so many great tennis players. Watch young Holman's rise in the tennis world! j
FEG MURRAY SAYS—
If some wrestler ever gets a scissors hold on that mustache, it
will be a close shave for Ivan Poddubny.
