# CABBAGES and THINGS
## POINT! POINT! WHO'S GOT THE POINT? 
### Monroe Eaton 
Far be it from Cabbages to venture
any pointed remarks about such a
pointless institution as the Women's
Point System; but we have been led,
perhaps by a misinterpretation of the
provisions, to believe that this sys
tem allows women altogether too
much leeway in the choice of activi
ties.
* * *
Furthermore, we fear that instead
of studying their university subjects,
women will spend all their time study
ing the point system grouping in order
to find whether or not they can, for
instance, be secretary-treasurer of the
Y.W.C.A. when they are already presi
dent of that organization.
♦ * *
Perhaps the reason that no Campus
Opinions have so far been written on
the point system is that no one wishes
to show his utter ignorance of the
entire subject.
* * ♦
By our interpretation of the rules
we infer that "any woman can be
either two news editors or three staff
members of the Daily Palo Alto, presi
dent, vice-president, and secretary
treasurer of the W.A.A. (is this an
imitation of a baby crying?), or three
members ( a majority) of the Roble
committee of five.
The allowance of such a monopoly
of offices and activities is to be
frowned upon point-blank.
* * *
The point system would also allow
woman to be president of Roble Hall
and president of a sorority house at
the same time. Such a combination of
activities would be dangerous to the
health.
* * *
Cabbages recommends that the fol
lowing provisions be added to the
point system in order to clear up the
date problem at Stanford:
Group MCMXXV
1. Four blind dates each week.
2. Three heavy dates each week, on
different days and hours.
3. One date to Ihe Junior Prom with
a hall man.
4. One date to the Junior Prom with
a fraternity man.
Restrictions: One additional activity
in Group MCMXXVI.
Group MCMXXVI
1. One lockout a month.
2. Ten lockouts a month.
3. One date blind or otherwise to
the Sophomore Cotillion.
Restrictions:
a. One additional activity in Group j
MCMXXVI.
b. No additional activities in Group
MCMXXV.

Perhaps the reason that no Campus
Opinions have so far been written on
the point system is that no one wishes

By our interpretation of the rules
we infer that "any woman can be
either two news editors or three staff
members of the Daily Palo Alto, presi
dent, vice-president, and secretary
treasurer of the W.A.A. (is this an
imitation of a baby crying?), or three
members ( a majority) of the Roble
committee of five.
The allowance of such a monopoly
of offices and activities is to be
frowned upon point-blank.

The point system would also allow
woman to be president of Roble Hall
and president of a sorority house at
the same time. Such a combination of
activities would be dangerous to the
health.

A machine to take and grade exams
