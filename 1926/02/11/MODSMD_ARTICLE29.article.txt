# U.S.C. TRACK TEAM WILL BE POWERFUL IN DISTANCE EVENTS

### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 10.â€”Distance
runners, who have been as scarce as
the proverbial hen's molars at the
University of Southern California in
the past, are now forming an import
ant cog in the track machine which
Coach Dean Cromwell will take to
Boston this spring to try for another
I.C.A.A.A.A. title.
Coach Cromwell has Les Heilman
and Mike Elwood, both of whom com
peted in the meet at Philadelphia last
year but failed to place in the point
gathering class. Heilman has come
down to 4:26 this season and Elwood
is now running 4:28. Ralph Shawhan,
who transferred from Ames two years
ago, is now a Trojan runner and has
done 4:25. All three of these men
should make the trip East.
The most joy, however, comes from
the frosli stars who will be eligible
next year. Chief of these is Chesley
Unruh, winner of the Southern Cali
fornia and state titles while a prep
last season. He was clocked at 4:20.3.
Bryce Schurr ran under 4:30 while in
high school as did Gerald Kerr. The
latter will probably specialize in the
two-mile.
Champion sprinters have always
been a hobby with Cromwell. He
trained Howard Drew who equalled
the 9.6 record in 1914 and Charles
Paddock who has officially equalled
that mark four times. But since Pad
dock's graduation, Cromwell has had
no great sprinters.
Now comes two freshman stars who
show promise. One is Weldon Draper
of Fort Worth, Texas, who did the 100
in 9 4-5 seconds twelve times in his
last year of high school competition.
He was clocked at one time at 9.6 by
two timers but the judges refused to
grant that a high schooler could run
that fast. Draper runs the 220 under
22 seconds.
The other youth is Charles Borah,
from Philips-Exeter Academy in Mas
sachusetts. Borah has run the century
in 9 4-5 and the 220 under 22 flat. In
the meet with Andover last year,
Borah clipped off the 100 in 10 flat,
sprinted the 220 in 22 2-5, grabbed
the quarter in 49 3-5, and then broad
jumped 21 feet to win that event.
