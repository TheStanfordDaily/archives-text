# ALCOHOL NO STIMULANT STATES PROFESSOR MILES

Alcohol is not a stimulant. This fact
which is contrary to the generally ac
cepted belief was voiced by Professor
W. R. Miles of the Psychology depart
ment in a talk he made before the
Faculty Research Club last night in
the Faculty Clubhouse. His subject
was "The Curve of Toxic Intensity
from Alcohol."
Professor Miles has been studying
the effects of alcohol for some years.
He finds that it is the shock of a siz
able amount of alcohol taken in a
short time that takes hold of a man's
nervous system.
It acts much the same way as elec
tricity does. Given a slow, steady cur
rent a person does not have any ef
fect, but turn on a fast current and
an immediate shock is produced. Alco
hol, when taken a little at a time, does
not have any noticeable effect, except
in the damage it may do to the bodily
organs over a period of time. But
given a heavy dose the nervous sys
tem is at once shocked and upset.

After a single dose of ethyl alcohol,
taken not in the beverage of the boot
legger, but in a laboratory mixture,
and following the penetration of the
fluid into the blood stream for a
period of three or four hours, it is
discovered that the toxic effect rises
very rapidly while the alcohol is still
becoming intensified in the blood. But
when the intensity reaches its peak
the toxic effect drops almost abruptly
to normal, while the alcohol leaves
only at a slow rate of decline. This
accounts for the fact that a person
who is exceedingly under the effects
of alcohol for a considerable period
suddenly becomes sober without any
intermediate stages.
When it is stated that the alcohol
gives a shock to the nervous system,
this must not be construed to mean a
stimulating effect, for it is really quite
the opposite. Some time ago Professor
Miles made an experiment with type
writing wherein he had five experi
enced secretaries who had been in the
