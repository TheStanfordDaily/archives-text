# ALCOHOL NO STIMULANT STATES PROFESSOR MILES

Alcohol is not a stimulant. This fact
which is contrary to the generally ac
cepted belief was voiced by Professor
W. R. Miles of the Psychology depart
ment in a talk he made before the
Faculty Research Club last night in
the Faculty Clubhouse. His subject
was "The Curve of Toxic Intensity
from Alcohol."
Professor Miles has been studying
the effects of alcohol for some years.
He finds that it is the shock of a siz
able amount of alcohol taken in a
short time that takes hold of a man's
nervous system.
It acts much the same way as elec
tricity does. Given a slow, steady cur
rent a person does not have any ef
fect, but turn on a fast current and
an immediate shock is produced. Alco
hol, when taken a little at a time, does
not have any noticeable effect, except
in the damage it may do to the bodily
organs over a period of time. But
given a heavy dose the nervous sys
tem is at once shocked and upset.

After a single dose of ethyl alcohol,
taken not in the beverage of the boot
legger, but in a laboratory mixture,
and following the penetration of the
fluid into the blood stream for a
period of three or four hours, it is
discovered that the toxic effect rises
very rapidly while the alcohol is still
becoming intensified in the blood. But
when the intensity reaches its peak
the toxic effect drops almost abruptly
to normal, while the alcohol leaves
only at a slow rate of decline. This
accounts for the fact that a person
who is exceedingly under the effects
of alcohol for a considerable period
suddenly becomes sober without any
intermediate stages.
When it is stated that the alcohol
gives a shock to the nervous system,
this must not be construed to mean a
stimulating effect, for it is really quite
the opposite. Some time ago Professor
Miles made an experiment with type
writing wherein he had five experi
enced secretaries who had been in the
habit of using alcohol to a moderate
extent take sets of tests over a period
of days. Some days the subjects were
given alcohol and sometimes not. It
was in a liquid in which the alcohol
could not be distinguished; so there
was no chance of conscious effort on
the part of the subjects.
Alcohol Increases Errors
He found that when he gave the
men a dose which would correspond
to an ordinary glassful of 15 per cent
wine the errors increased at the end j
of forty minutes to a degree equal to
that obtained only after three and a j
half or four hours without the alcohol, j
When twice the amount of alcohol
was given twice the amount of errors \
were made at the end of the forty
minutes as had been caused by ordi
nary fatigue in four hours.
Speed did not seem to be noticeably \
changed by the alcohol. But serious
mistakes occurred more often, show- j
ing that the effect was to make the
subject more erratic throughout.
While there is a higher surface tem-1
perature and a faster beating of the
heart with alcohol in the system, this
is not due to speeding up; rather the i
opposite is true. A partial paralysis I
of the heart's governor is caused and
this allows the heart to go free as it
does when one runs a long way. When
the speed of eye movement was tested, i
and various reflexes of the muscles, it j
was found that response was slower
in every instance after the absorption
of alcohol than before.
