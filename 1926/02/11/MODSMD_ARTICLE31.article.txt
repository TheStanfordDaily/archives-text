# Sophomore Women Down Juniors in Basketball
## 
### 
The sophomore women's basketball
team defeated the juniors 21 to 12 in
a practice game yesterday afternoon.
In the third quarter the sophomores
took the lead, and kept it the rest of
the game.
Every player of both squads played
in this game, and frequent changes in
line-up were partly responsible for the
junior loss.
