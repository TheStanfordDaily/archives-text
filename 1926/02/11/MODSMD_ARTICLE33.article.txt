# Episcopal Students Meet At Dinner for Bishop
## 
### 
"The trouble that students have
with religion is not due to religion,
but to the students' ignorance of it,"
said Bishop Edward L. Parsons at a
dinner for Episcopal students in Palo
Alto last evening. The Bishop de
clared that most students took their
views from Sunday School days, and
so had in their minds only a vague
mess of ideas. He pleaded that college
young men and women be intelligent
about their religion.
Over a hundred students attended
the dinner, which was followed by
speeches. Herndon C. Ray was toast
master, while other speakers were Ida
Railey, Sterling Beckwith, Charles J.
Simon, William Christian ,and the Rev.
Oscar F. Green.
