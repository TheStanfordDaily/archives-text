# Freshman Women Engaged Will Sell Valentine Chappie Sororities to Mob Booths
## 
### 
Chaparral's 1926 Valentine number
will go on Quad sale tomorrow morn
ing. Instead of the sororities having
sales girls, freshman women will sell
the issue for this month.
A collegiate cover design# shows a
young man enrapt in a St. Valentine's
Day dream. Several full-page cartoons
of subjects related to the central
theme have been scattered through
the issue.
Two tables will be placed on the
Quad\where the freshman women will
sell the thirty-cent copies of the forty
page issue.
