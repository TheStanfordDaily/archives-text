### 
The Rev. C. W. Wise, of the Palo
Alto Methodist church, spoke to the
Freshman Council at its weekly meet
ing last night on "The Student's God."
Rev. Wise emphasized the personal
element in religion and urged that an
effort be made on the part of the
student to maintain a more satisfac
tory personal conception of God.
He stated that there was no con
flict between sure science and reli
gion, but merely a misunderstanding
as to their respective fields. After the
talk, discussion was held by the mem
bers.
