# 145'S LOSE THROUGH ERROR IN TIME TO PALO ALTO ALUMNI
## Opponents Get Credit for 23-20 Win, But Score Should Favor Cards 
### 
Due to an error on the part of the
timekeepers the Stanford 145-pounders
officially lost to the Palo Alto High
School Alumni by a score of 23 to 20,
although they actually won the game
18 to 17. The game was played in the
pavilion last night as a curtain-raiser
to the Stanford Freshmen-St. Mary's
Freshmen event.
The mistake was made in this man
ner: time was called at the end of
the game with the Cardinal quintet
leading 18 to 17, but the gun failed
to go off. The referee called a foul
on a Redshirt player and a Palo Alto
man converted for the point necessary
to tie the count. During the extra
five-minute period the Palo Altans
made five markers while the Stanford
middleweights shot only two free
throws. Actually the overtime should
not have been played, as the time
keepers should not have allowed the
last foul to be played. Time was out
and the game was over, so that the
Stanford 145's actually won the game,
and were forced to lose it on account
of the mistake made by the timers.
The Cardinals started off slowly and
were trailing on the short end of a 7
to 5 score at half time. They came
back with a rush and won the game,
only to lose it later. George was high
point man for Stanford, shooting four
goals and a foul for a total of nine
counters.
Pors won the game for the Palo
Alto Alumni by shooting a field goal
and a foul in the extra period. He
made a total of ten points and led
both teams in the scoring. Dunniway
also contributed a field goal in the
overtime, bringing his point-making
for the evening up to five. Ed Haley
was another player to furnish five
counters toward the overthrow of the
Cardinals.
