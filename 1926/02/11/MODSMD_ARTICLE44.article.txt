# SMALLER NORTHERN COLLEGES ORGANIZE SPORTS CONFERENCE
## 
### 
A new Northwest Conference, com
! posed of Pacific, Whitman, Willamette,
j College of Idaho, Linfield, and College
j of Puget Sound, was organized at the
j final session of the Coast Conference
| meeting after the large schools had
! withdrawn from the old athletic asso
ciation.
i
This change has been contemplated
for several years, but none of the
smaller schools have been willing to
take the step. The six large schools
in the Northwest group who are also
members of the Pacific Coast Football
Conference, took the initiative last
week and are now members of the lat
ter conference only. Gon/aga, not be
ing a member of the coast association
and not willing to join the conference
of smaller schools, is now a lone wolf.
The readjustment was accomplished
without any hard feelings on the part
of the little schools for they realized
that a change was essential. Their
representatives immediately met at
Tacoma and elected Dean F. M. Erick
son of Willamette, president, and H.
L. Hopkins, of Pacific, secretary.
Although the small schools are in a
separate conference it will not mean
that they cannot play the large
schools, but will merely mean that the
results of their gjunes will not count
in the percentage columns of their
larger opponents. In the past, compli
cations have arisen because some
large colleges filled their schedule with
small school games and claimed a
championship by virtue of their easy
victories which gave them an impos
ing record.
