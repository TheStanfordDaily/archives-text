El Tigre won the title in League V
by defeating Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
last year's University basketball cham
pions, in one of the biggest upsets of
the current intramural season. The
club team started out with a rush and
was never headed by the S.A.E. quin
tet. The score at half time favored
the winners, 7 to 4.
Woodhead Tigre Star
Woodhead, El Tigre center,, was
mainly responsible for his team's vic
tory. He played a clever floor game,
and succeeded in getting around the
hitherto impregnable S.A.E. defense
with little trouble. In the second half
the El Tigre five, with Woodhead on
the scoring end of the majority of the
plays, passed the ball under the bas
ket on numerous occasions. Woodhead
accounted for five field goals, four of
which came in the last period.
The fraternity team was decidedly
off its game, and seemed to have
great difficulty getting the offense to
working smoothly. Gibbons and Mc-
Dermont played their usual good game
but their efforts were not enough to
overcome the lead maintained by the
El Tigre team.
Encina 3E Beats El Cuadro
Encina 3E came back with a greatly
improved style of play in the second
half of its game with El Cuadro and
took the honors with a 12 to 8 score.
Both teams played raggedly in the
first half, and the period ended with
El Cuadro leading, 4 to 2.
Smalling, Encina center, started his
team off on a brilliant scoring rally
by ringing up two field goals in 'quick
succession. Thomason connected for a
basket, and then followed it with a
pretty shot from the sidelines. Sewell
and Eraser made one apiece for El
Cuadro, but Smalling shot another
goal that cinched the contest for
Encina.
El Campo Wins Thriller
The El Campo-Sigma Nu tussle was
closely played, with first one and then
the other team holding a short advan
tage.
Bigelow, club forward, was the scor
ing ace of the game. He connected for
all of his team's five points in the
first half, and then rang up four more
in the last period for a total of nine
markers. Quinn scored high for Sigma
Nu with six points.
Chi Psi's Lose Close Game
Chi Psi and Encina 3W played ex
cellent basketball in the first half of
their game, and then let their playing
gradually fall down to a slow finish.
The score at half time was 12 to 11
for the freshman team.
Chi Psi made one point in the last
half, and Encina made two. Walker,
Chi Psi running guard, was the high
point scorer of the game with three
field goals and one free throw for a
total of seven points. Major and Mil
ler, with five points each, played the
best game for Encina.
Following are tomorrow's games:
4:15 —Chinese Club vs. Sequoia I.
