# CARDS DOWNED BY NEVADA IN OPENING CONTEST OF SERIES
## Final Score 24 to 17; Stanford Five Will Have Chance for Comeback When Teams Meet Tomorrow Night 
### Jim Adams 
| EADING throughout the entire game, a fighting Nevada team caught the j
" Cards napping last night and handed them a surprise defeat in the j
pavilion by a score of 24 to 17. The Stanford squad was way off its game i
and will have to register a normal temperature tomorrow night if it expects i
to come back and beat the Wolf Pack.
The visitors started their scoring by two long baskets tossed by Fredericks
and Watson respectively. The former individual figured prominently from
then on in all scoring activities, turning in a total of twelve markers for j
high-point honors. Tight guarding, close following the ball, and well-aimed |

shots on the part of Nevada spelled
defeat for the Redshirts. In spite of
a great effort at the end they were
never able to break down the stub
born defense of their opponents.
Kerr shifted his men frequently but
no five could get together and show
the home folks any real basketball.
The Cards were without the services
of Anderson, but no alibi can be
claimed in that branch because Biag
gini played a good, aggressive game
and most of the baskets that were
slipped in within his territory can be
blamed on others for lack of support.
Clark Goes Well
Clark sank three pretty field goals
but his floorwork was far below par.
For a while during the first half the
team looked as if it was capable of
collecting itself and playing a winning
brand of ball, but in the second half
their play was even more loose. Price
didn't juggle the ball as badly as the
rest, but only once during the game
did he find the basket. This was a
long shot from the center which was
followed by a close one by Clark.
These two baskets gave promise of a
Stanford rally but it soon lost its mo
mentum.
Subs Added Fire
Steele, David, and Bryant were sent
in the latter part of the first period
and added a great deal of fire to the
team, but hardly had time to over
come the lead of the Wolves when
sent in in the second half with the
score 23-15. Steele hounded the ball
every minute and was especially ef
fective in work under the basket.
David also rustled the ball well but
couldn't find the range of the basket.
Nevada cashed in on six of the thir
teen free throws offered them while
the Cards got three out of eight. The
Redshirts were certainly not hitting
the basket in their field shots.
Second Game Tomorrow
Probably tomorrow night the Stan
ford five will be fully awake to their
situation and will come back with a
victory. The erratic playing of the
Cards just at this stage in the season
when they ought to be in their prime
takes away all confidence in predicting
what they might do in the future. Kerr
may have decided 011 a change of line
up when the two teams meet at 8
o'clock in the pavilion tomorrow night
and perhaps the trouble will all come
out in the wash.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (17) Nevada (24)
Price (C) (2) F Goodale (4)
Clark (6) F Bream (5)
Jayred (2) C Watson (2)
Vincenti G Fredericks (12)
Biaggini G Clover
Substitutions for Stanford: Steele 2,
David 1, Bryant 4, Mitchell, Shipkey.
For Nevada: Bailey, Conaly 1.

team, but hardly had time to over
come the lead of the Wolves when
sent in in the second half with the
score 23-15. Steele hounded the ball
every minute and was especially ef
fective in work under the basket.
David also rustled the ball well but
couldn't find the range of the basket.
Nevada cashed in on six of the thir
teen free throws offered them while
the Cards got three out of eight. The
Redshirts were certainly not hitting
the basket in their field shots.
Second Game Tomorrow
Probably tomorrow night the Stan
ford five will be fully awake to their
situation and will come back with a
victory. The erratic playing of the
Cards just at this stage in the season
when they ought to be in their prime
takes away all confidence in predicting
what they might do in the future. Kerr
may have decided 011 a change of line
up when the two teams meet at 8
o'clock in the pavilion tomorrow night
and perhaps the trouble will all come
out in the wash.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (17) Nevada (24)
Price (C) (2) F Goodale (4)
Clark (6) F Bream (5)
Jayred (2) C Watson (2)
Vincenti G Fredericks (12)
Biaggini G Clover
Substitutions for Stanford: Steele 2,
David 1, Bryant 4, Mitchell, Shipkey.
For Nevada: Bailey, Conaly 1.
| EADING throughout the entire game, a fighting Nevada team caught the j
" Cards napping last night and handed them a surprise defeat in the j
pavilion by a score of 24 to 17. The Stanford squad was way off its game i
and will have to register a normal temperature tomorrow night if it expects i
to come back and beat the Wolf Pack.
The visitors started their scoring by two long baskets tossed by Fredericks
and Watson respectively. The former individual figured prominently from
then on in all scoring activities, turning in a total of twelve markers for j
high-point honors. Tight guarding, close following the ball, and well-aimed |

shots on the part of Nevada spelled
defeat for the Redshirts. In spite of
a great effort at the end they were
never able to break down the stub
born defense of their opponents.
Kerr shifted his men frequently but
no five could get together and show
the home folks any real basketball.
The Cards were without the services
of Anderson, but no alibi can be
claimed in that branch because Biag
gini played a good, aggressive game
and most of the baskets that were
slipped in within his territory can be
blamed on others for lack of support.
Clark Goes Well
Clark sank three pretty field goals
but his floorwork was far below par.
For a while during the first half the
team looked as if it was capable of
collecting itself and playing a winning
brand of ball, but in the second half
their play was even more loose. Price
didn't juggle the ball as badly as the
rest, but only once during the game
did he find the basket. This was a
long shot from the center which was
followed by a close one by Clark.
These two baskets gave promise of a
Stanford rally but it soon lost its mo
mentum.
Subs Added Fire
Steele, David, and Bryant were sent
in the latter part of the first period
and added a great deal of fire to the
team, but hardly had time to over
come the lead of the Wolves when
sent in in the second half with the
score 23-15. Steele hounded the ball
every minute and was especially ef
fective in work under the basket.
