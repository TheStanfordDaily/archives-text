# LIGHTWEIGHTS LOSE TO SAN MATEO HIGH BY 18 TO 12 SCORE
## 
### 
In the last few minutes of the game, j
| with the score tied at 12-12, the San
Mateo high school 130-pounders chalked
up three field goals to win their cotnest
from the Stanford lightweights last night
|by a score of 18 to 12. The game was
j played in the Pavilion as a preliminary
to the Stanford-Nevada varsity clash, ,
The Redshirted 130's played better last
night than they have in most of their |
games this season, and it looked as if j
they were going to win from the San j
Mateans during the greatest part of the
j struggle. Their passing has improved!
j quite a bit in the last few days, but
] much practice is needed on shooting has- ;
! kets. The San Mateo boys did not show
I very much until the end of the game,!
when they rallied sufficiently to leave the
Cardinals on the short end of the score. l
I
i They broke from defense to offense and
I back again much faster than the Stan-
S ford team did.
Spradling was tlie big gun for Stan- i
ford, ringing up three field goals and a
, free throw for a total of seven points. 1
Thomas did most of the rest of the
j scoring, contributing four markers.)
Chanteloupe of San Mateo was high man,
shooting four baskets. '
