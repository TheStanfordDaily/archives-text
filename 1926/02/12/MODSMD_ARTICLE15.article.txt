# ROVER BOYS WILL SAVE COLLEGE AT RAM'S HEAD SHOW
## TWO SHOWS SCHEDULED Fiction Heroes Brought to Life by Ram's Head Comedians 
### 
Tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the As
sembly hall the curtain will rise to
disclose the antic√ü of the famous
Rover Boys, of childhood fiction fame,
and make clear to the assembled mul
titude exactly how they saved (Insert
nameof) University from ruin, in the
annual burlesque show to be produced
under the auspices of Ram's Head so
ciety.
The dress rehearsal last night was
one of the smoothest which has been
had by a campus musical show for
some time, and the indications are
that the cast and choruses under the
direction of Dave Mannoccir and
Chrysella Kiler will give performances
of professional snap and finish both
tonight and Saturday.

The settings, executed by Leslie
Kiler, technical director, give promise
of being very effective, and several
specialties which have been arranged,
will enliven the waits between acts,
although Kiler declares that the
changes of scenery have been so re
hearsed as to make them more rapid
than usual. The first scene of "Ray!
Ray! Rover Boys" takes place upon
the campus of (Insertnameof) Univer
sity, showing a section of the college's
brand new stadium, just built from
contributions of the alumni, and also
a section of the President's brand new
pink stucco shack, the funds for which
were produced by devious means. The
second act depicts the typical setting
for a collegiate musical show, and
Kiler has broadly satirized some of
the musical comedy settings which
have been seen with Stanford shows
during the past two years. The third
act is supposed to take place in the
chapter house of the Rho Dammit Rho
fraternity, and is also a satire on con
ventional settings.
The presentation this evening is
fundamentally intended for the cam
pus audience, on account of tho basket
ball game which is scheduled for to
morrow evening, although both per
formances will be exactly the same.
Tonight, however, will be "the first
night" with reviewers from local and
San Francisco papers present. Fol
lowing the show, there will be a one
o'clock dance with Chub Tyroller's
orchestra in the Women's Clubhouse.
There will be no dance after the pro
duction on Saturday night. A block
of especially reserved seats and
roughs' seats will go on sale this
evening at the box office at 7:00
o'clock.
