# Ray! Ray! Ram's Head
## 
### 
It is always with pleasure that the campus looks forward to the annual
Ram's Head shows. To see them is to invariably laugh and enjoy them.
Of course there have been presentations in the past wherein the villain's
mustache dropped to the floor in a crucial moment, or the hero has proudly
.strutted across the stage with suspenders dragging; but the pathos of such
tragedies has been felt only by the actor. To the audience, it is all part
of the show.
This year in addition to laughing at the actors and the lines, we are
going to laugh at ourselvesâ€”American college students. Youngsters of
more than a decade ago found new thrills in the adventures of the base
Jack Dalton and "the fun loving," heroic Rover Boys. Whatever the
author made his characters do, their antics were close to the dreams of the
average American boy.
Ram's Head's 1926 version of the Rover Boys would probably prove
u disillusionment to the 1912 boy but it is certain that the vehicle will be
long remembered at Stanford. Authorities on national humor tell us that
the college is either afraid, or too lazy, to burlesque its own life; that it
would be far better to find humor right in the heart of the American col
lege. Ram's Head is attempting this in "Ray! Ray! Rover Boys!"
The critics call the idiosyncracies of our nine months of school life
"that college stuff" and in a certain sense it is "stuff." What the Rover
Boys will do remains to be seen; but it is sure that the American university
"pulls enough boots" for several burlesques and a dozen Rover Boys.
In the meantime, hail to (Insertnameof) University!

THE BOARD OF ATHLETIC CONTROL generously provides
two officials for every varsity basketball contest. Assistance from the
sidelines merely complicates matters, and helps neither the referees nor the
playing of the team.
