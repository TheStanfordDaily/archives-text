"Came the Jawn," as the movie sub-title writers would
say it. "Jawn" first saw the light of day some fifty-three
years ago. He has been manager of the New York Giants
for the past twenty-three years, and anyone who has read
his "My Thirty Years in Baseball" (which some say Mc-
Graw read for the first time when it was published) knows
the history of the cocky fighting kid who started pro base
ball with the Oleon Club in 1890. John has gone up in the
world physically and financially since then —his salary of
$00 a month has grown to $65,000 a year, and his 120
pounds have increased to nearly 200. But he still has the
old fighting spirit that won him the nickname of "Muggsy"
thirty-six years ago.
McGraw's friends will tell you how he has won ten
National league pennants for New York since he first took
over the managerial duties in 1903. His enemies will

retort, "Yes, and he's lost seven world series." It is said that the famous
manager shows off his worst qualities tor public inspection, and keeps his
fine characteristics for those lucky few who know him intimately. He has
been rough and rowdy at times, both on and off the ball field, yet his many
big-hearted acts in pensioning former players who were down and out, and
his kindly interest in young players have escaped the same publicity that his
roughneck tactics have received.
McGraw is certainly one of the greatest of all managers, a good realtor,
and as a player he ranks with Anson and other pioneers of the game who did
so much in introducing baseball strategy and tactics which have become
fixtures for thirty or more years.
FEG MURRAY SAYS—
American track fans, who doubt some of the records claimed by
Huber Houben, the German sprinter, are evidently suspicious of the
Watches on the Rhine,
