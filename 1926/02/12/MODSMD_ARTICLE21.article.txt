# CABBAGES and THINGS
## THE 						RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO 
### Monroe Eaton Letitia Lemon Episode IV 
A Female Bull Session
Maurathea Providence, my room-1
ate, and Rosamond Thorn, the girl
; who lived next dear, eventually be-1
> i came very close friends, although at
. | first Maurathea was forever telling me
! "how much that Thorn Girl irritated
her." (That this friendship finally cul
minated in a conspiracy that led to
my undoing, I need not mention here).
Maurathea (who was quite good
looking), returned one night from a
; date was always an occasion for an
| early morning conclave. (Two dozen
i of these were held in my room alone
| in the first month). Within five min-
L jutes five alarm clocks rang in the
rooms next door and across the hall.
I will not record here all that my
| roommate said for it would take up
!too much space. (Suffice it to say
that I heard things that were never
mentioned back in dear old Squaw
Lookout, Nevada.) But I will repeat
a small saple of the conversation that
is particularly interesting.

MEN STUDENTS NOTE WELL
Although it is true that you read 1
cabbages for the sole purpose of un
earthing the slight trace of humor
which occasionally finds its way into '
this column, Cabbages earnestly re- i
quests that you lay aside all joking!
for the time being and read with due
regard and reverence the following
FASHION NOTES:
DON'T TIP YOUR HAT. (Which re
minds Cabbages of that "stingy
Scotchman joke"). It was permissible
years ago with the overtrimmed pic
ture hat, but it is pass 6 today.
* * *
The reversible coat is to be the:
coming vogue for spring.
♦ * *
Fine felt hats are good for spring
with narrow brims and high crushed
crowns. A band of narrow ribbon j
| around the brim is the only trimming, j
(What about dinks?)
♦ * *
Dresses falling from the shoulders
in a straight line are on the decrease.
I (Heaven only knows how else they
are supposed to come off). The new 1
| tendency is slightly shaped at the
waist so as to Follow the Curves of
the body to some extent and indicate
the waist without accentuating it.
* * *
The large figure should not wear
materials with large patterns or de
signs. A stout figure should not wear
stripes unless they are light in value
with a light background or dark in
value with a dark background. (What
are we going to do about jail-birds?)
* * *
A stout medium figure can wear
I serge or soft materials as voiles, but
'should not wear pan velvet, satin, or
any material with a distinct high light.
I (We regret that nothing is said regard-
I ing cords, sweatshirts, etc.)

A Female Bull Session
Maurathea Providence, my room-1
ate, and Rosamond Thorn, the girl
; who lived next dear, eventually be-1
> i came very close friends, although at
. | first Maurathea was forever telling me
! "how much that Thorn Girl irritated
her." (That this friendship finally cul
minated in a conspiracy that led to
my undoing, I need not mention here).
Maurathea (who was quite good
looking), returned one night from a
; date was always an occasion for an
| early morning conclave. (Two dozen
i of these were held in my room alone
| in the first month). Within five min-
L jutes five alarm clocks rang in the
rooms next door and across the hall.
I will not record here all that my
| roommate said for it would take up
!too much space. (Suffice it to say
that I heard things that were never
mentioned back in dear old Squaw
Lookout, Nevada.) But I will repeat
a small saple of the conversation that
is particularly interesting.
