# GYM REQUIREMENTS REVISED FOR WOMEN IN LOWER DIVISION
## 
### 
Formal gymnastics will cease to be
a required subject in the Women's
Physical Education department spring
quarter this year, according to a state
ment made yesterday afternoon by
Miss Helen Masters Bunting, head of
the department. Under the new ar
rangement lower division women will
have a choice of a combination of
one hour of formal gymnastics each
week and two of sports; or four hours
of sports. The four hours of sports
may be taken either in one activity
or in two.
Upper division students will be able
by this plan to take athletics for credit
without taking formal gymnastics, if
they take four hours a week. On the
other hand, they may take formal gym
nastics if they prefer.
By the new plan formal gymnastics
classes will be held on Fridays instead
of on Mondays, and sports classes on
Mondays and Wednesday and on Tues
days and Thursdays. Only two hours
of practice will be required each week
for eligibility to teams, in order that
women in athletics may register in
two sports. Thus upper division stu
dents not desiring credit may come
only twice a week and still have a
chance to make teams.
W.A.A. board passed a resolution
supporting the gymnasium department
in the adoption of this plan, at its
meeting Wednesday evening.
