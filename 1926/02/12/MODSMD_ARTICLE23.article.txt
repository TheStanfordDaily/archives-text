competed in many University tourna
ments in his three years at Stanford.

weight class will again be Carlos Miron,

middleweight opponent, repeating his two
victories of 1925.

son for his opponent, Eveleth will meet

Captain Myron Schall of Stanford, and

Miron, Card veteran.

Gerson, who is confident that the ability
of his men will stand off the Stanford
men. A1 Gomez will meet Goldwater,
Captain Miller will have Harry Steven
son for his opponent, Eveleth will meet

Captain Myron Schall of Stanford, and
the other Gomez twin will fight Carlos
Miron, Card veteran.

Art Schover, an Aggie freshman, will
fight Jim Arthur in the heavyweight di
vision, while Grubbs of the Davis boxers
will meet Fain, Stanford light-heavy
weight. The bantamweight bout will
bring together Jack Brem, an Aggie
newcomer, and Collins, Stanford bantam
of the 1925 varsity.
California Aggie boxers will be the
first opponents of the Stanford men in

their match tomorrow night at the Davis
Farm. With Captain Schall, Collins,
Miron, and Arthur, all members of last
year's team which twice faced the Aggies
again rapresenting the Cardinal, several
close and hard-fought bouts are expected.
Goldwater, diminutive lightweight, will
be the Stanford contender for honors in
this division. This will be the first var
sity match the winner of the novice
tournament has fought, although he has
competed in many University tourna
ments in his three years at Stanford.
The Cardinal fighter in the feather
weight class will again be Carlos Miron,
who lost two close decisions in his bouts
with the Aggie men last year. With an
added year of experience, the fast and
heady featherweight is one of the
strongest men on the Stanford team.
Stevenson, a find of the novice tourna
ment, will fight in the welterweight di
vision, filling the hole left by the gradua
tion of Vincent Martin, captain of the
1925 boxers. Stevenson will be hard
pressed to follow the footsteps of the
last year's Card leader who twice de
feated his opponents from the Davis
Farm, the first time by a knockout.
Fain, a big sophomore, will fight in
• the light-heavyweight class, with Jim
Arthur, heavyweight of last year's var
sityfi again in this division. Fain will
also be fighting his first varsity match
tomorrow night.
Bantamweight honors will be upheld
by Collins, who last year lost two close
verdicts to the best of the collegiate
boxers in this class. Schall, Stanford
captain, is a heavy favorite to whip his
middleweight opponent, repeating his two
victories of 1925.
Four Davis veterans, the Gomez twins,
Captain Miller, and Eveleth, will wear
the glove under the direction of Coach
Gerson, who is confident that the ability
of his men will stand off the Stanford
men. A1 Gomez will meet Goldwater,
Captain Miller will have Harry Steven
son for his opponent, Eveleth will meet

Captain Myron Schall of Stanford, and
the other Gomez twin will fight Carlos
Miron, Card veteran.

Art Schover, an Aggie freshman, will
fight Jim Arthur in the heavyweight di
vision, while Grubbs of the Davis boxers
will meet Fain, Stanford light-heavy
weight. The bantamweight bout will
bring together Jack Brem, an Aggie
newcomer, and Collins, Stanford bantam
of the 1925 varsity.
