# HUMOR ILLUSTRATED IN COMPOSITION ON ORCHESTRA PROGRAM
## "Sorcerer's Apprentice" Has Ludicrous Effects; Is From Old Legend 
### Herbert Klein 
Humor in music is a thing often dis
cussed but less often is an actual
example heard. "The Sorcerer's Ap
prentice" by Paul Dukas, which is on
| the program of the San Francisco Or
j chestra in its concert in the Assembly
[ hall Tuesday night, is a rare example
of musical humor that has delighted
audiences at concerts since its com
position.
A poem by Goethe is the inspira
tion for the work. Goethe in turn based
his verses upon an old legend which is
i known to go back to the early days
i of Egypt, so that the musical compo
! sition is probably the most modern
setting of a fable many centuries old.
The story the legends poem, and
music all tell is as follows: A great
| magician once had an apprentice who
| was very anxious to learn the use of
| all the formulas of the Black Art. One
! day while the master is away, the
apprentice repeats some charms he
| has overheard. He commands a broom
stick standing in a corner to draw
water from a nearby river. The
broomstick starts off with jerky move
ments which are ludicrously repre
sented in the music. Soon enough
water is drawn, and the apprentice
i realizes to his horror that he does
I
not know how to turn the charm off!
He tries everything in vain. He even
chops the stick in half but both ends
continue to draw water from the river.
Everything in the house is flooded.
I The apprentice cries out for help; the
| masterer sorcerer returns home, stops
the broom, and banishes the rash ap
prentice from his house.
The bassoon, which has been called
the "clown of the orchestra," because
of its lugubrious sound, has been used
i by the composer to play the theme of
the broomstick as it moves jerkily
and stiffy about. Soon the unmistak
j able sound of gurgling water comes
from the orchestra as the flood begins
| to rise. Even the effort of the appren
i tice to cut the stick in half is repre
sented. A great blare announces the
I return of the master magician and his
dispelling of the charm. The instru
ments tell in no uncertain terms of
the banishment of the apprentice. A
sad and disillusioned melody at the
close depicts the unlucky lad wander
ing forth into the world.
Paul Dukas, the composer, is one of
the best-known composers of the mod
ern school in France. He is especially
successful in his orchestration of sym
phonic works. This is his best-known
j composition.
Other numbers on the program are:
: Tchaikowsky's Fourth Symphony;
| Overture to the opera "Euryanthe," by
Weber; and "Danse Macabre" by
Saint Saens, another recent French
I composition also based on a super
j natural and ancient legend.
