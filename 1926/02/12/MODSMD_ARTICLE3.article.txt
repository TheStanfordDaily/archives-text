# YEARLING HOOP FIVE MEETS LIVERMORE IN PRELIMINARY GAME
## Revamped Squad Will Take Floor in Last Start Before U.C. Tilt 
### 
As a preliminary to the Varsity-Ne-1
vada game tomorrow night, the Cardinal
freshman quintet will meet the Livermore j
high school team. The freshman game !
will start at 7 o'clock.
Just a week remains until the freshmen ;
meet the California babes for the second j
time, and Coach Hunt has entirely re-1
built his team since the last game with
the Blue and Gold cubs. Hunt has found j
a new pair of guards in Robb, who has
played the last three games at this posi- j
tion, and Kopp. who has been out with '
a sprained ankle for two weeks, but!
played against Saint Mary's Wednesday
night. Kopp played a great defensive j
game, and along" with Robb held thej
visitors to four field goals, made by long :
shots.
Renzel and Osmonson have shown :
much improvement in the past two weeks |
and while no definite lineup for tomor- j
row night's game has been made by Hunt, !
it is certain that these two men will get j
in the game at the forward positions.!
T his pair was by far the best in passing J
and shooting that played against Saint'
Mary's. McCandless is still the out-1
standing star of the squad and the best'
freshman centcr in several seasons. His
shooting is the best on the team and has
enabled the yearlings to pull out of sev
eral tight games with the winning end
of the score.
Sexson and Davis are still among the
best forwards Hunt has to choose from, j
Sexson is one of *the prettiest floor players ]
in the squad. His pivoting has seldom ;
failed to out-fox his opponents, but his !
shooting has been weak. Crary shows j
good form in spurts; sometimes he looks |
like a star and at other times fails to
show any form whatever. Sibbett is a :
more consistent player and will probably
be used against Livermore.
Lewis, Marks, and Worden are battling
for the guard positions along with Robb J
and Kopp. Lewis demonstrated his abil-!
it.v for long shots in the game Wednes
day night.
