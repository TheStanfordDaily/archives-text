# POLO TEAM LOSES TO FAST MIDWICKS IN SECOND TOURNEY
## 
### 
Stanford was definitely eliminated
from further competition in Del Monte
polo yesterday when the fast Midwick
Juniors from Los Angeles carried away
a victory with a score of 8 to 0, in the
San Mateo eight goal handicap tourna
ment.
The poor showing of Stanford during
the two tourneys was partly due to the
inferior horses which the squad was
obliged to use. Time and again, mem
bers of the Cardinal team got away for
long and clear approaches to the goal,
only to have the ball backed by players
of the opposition whose horses were
faster.
The entire game was played in a driv
ing rain. Despite the heavy turf and
slow field, no spills occurred. The Mid
wick team has one of the strongest ag
gregations in the tournament competi
tion, and are playing in the finals of the
Novice Tournament.
Stanford did not play two of her regu
lar starting men. Vanderburgh and
Thompson were the only regulars in the
lineup. The line-up is as follows:
Stanford: Kenneth Krohn, C. O.
Thompson, George Baker, Lyall Vander
burgh. Midwick: C. B. Wrightman (1),
Neil McCarthy' (2), Royland Piiddock
(3), Willis Cooley (0). Handicap (2).
