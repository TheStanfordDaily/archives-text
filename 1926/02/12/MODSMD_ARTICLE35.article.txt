# "APPLE POLISHING" DISCUSSED BY PROFESSORS DESIRE CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH STUDENTS CRUSADE AGAINST PERSONAL CONTACT DENIED

"Apple polishing," instead of being the j
subtle but effective method of impressing i
the professor and improving deficient j
grades which it is traditionally thought'
to be, is, on the contrary, nothing but a
regrettable hoodoo, in the opinion of
representative members of the faculty,
who were interviewed on this subject.
The "apple polishing" situation was
brought into the news recently through
a letter published in Campus Opinion, in
which the writer complained that the
dread of being called "apple polisher"
keeps many sincere students from enter
ing into association with their professors
on frank terms.
"A professor with brains can tell an
'apple polisher' in a minute," declared j
Miss Margery Bailey, instructor in Eng- j
lish. "The student should not be afraid
of being accused of 'apple polishing' when
he approaches his professor with a ques
tion or a problem. Freshmen and sopho
mores are naturally shy in their attitude
toward their instructors and seem to hold
them in awe, but upperclassmen have the
intelligence to iealize that the professor
is at their service when they arc per
plexed."
"Some of my most brilliant students
do appear to hesitate to approach me,
though," Miss Bailey added, "and I often
have to call them to my desk to tell them
I like their work."
It is the belief of Ephraim D. Adams,
professor of history, that any student
who shows particular interest in his work
attracts the instructor.
"Unfortunately there is not the oppor
tunity at Stanford for the professor to
meet his students at his home, as in small
colleges. However, in his office he is
ready to welcome the student when he
is not busy."
Professor Carl F. Brand of the history
department declared that in the matter
of breaking down the wall of formality

which is complained of, the initiative is
in the hands of the student.
Speaking for the citizenship depart
ment, Professor Edgar E. Robinson ex
pressed the wish that the Relationship
between student and instructor be one so
natural and friendly that no one would
question it.
"On the basis of three years of experi
ence with freshmen, I can say our rela
tionships have been entirely happy."
None of the faculty who were ap
proached knew anything of an official
"crusade" to eliminate "apple polishing,"
as was intimated in Campus Opinion.
The problem is not considered serious,
association of instructor with instructed
bbeing regarded as more to be encour
aged than frowned upon.

grades which it is traditionally thought'
to be, is, on the contrary, nothing but a
regrettable hoodoo, in the opinion of
representative members of the faculty,
who were interviewed on this subject.
The "apple polishing" situation was
brought into the news recently through
a letter published in Campus Opinion, in
which the writer complained that the
dread of being called "apple polisher"
keeps many sincere students from enter
ing into association with their professors
on frank terms.
"A professor with brains can tell an
'apple polisher' in a minute," declared j
Miss Margery Bailey, instructor in Eng- j
lish. "The student should not be afraid
of being accused of 'apple polishing' when
he approaches his professor with a ques
tion or a problem. Freshmen and sopho
mores are naturally shy in their attitude
toward their instructors and seem to hold
them in awe, but upperclassmen have the
intelligence to iealize that the professor
is at their service when they arc per
plexed."
"Some of my most brilliant students
do appear to hesitate to approach me,
though," Miss Bailey added, "and I often
have to call them to my desk to tell them
I like their work."
It is the belief of Ephraim D. Adams,
professor of history, that any student
who shows particular interest in his work
attracts the instructor.
"Unfortunately there is not the oppor
tunity at Stanford for the professor to
meet his students at his home, as in small
colleges. However, in his office he is
ready to welcome the student when he
is not busy."
Professor Carl F. Brand of the history
department declared that in the matter
of breaking down the wall of formality

which is complained of, the initiative is
in the hands of the student.
Speaking for the citizenship depart
ment, Professor Edgar E. Robinson ex
pressed the wish that the Relationship
between student and instructor be one so
natural and friendly that no one would
question it.
"On the basis of three years of experi
ence with freshmen, I can say our rela
tionships have been entirely happy."
None of the faculty who were ap
proached knew anything of an official
"crusade" to eliminate "apple polishing,"
as was intimated in Campus Opinion.
The problem is not considered serious,
association of instructor with instructed
bbeing regarded as more to be encour
aged than frowned upon.
