1 Larkins, Winged "O" baseball coach, has
! developed a capable and smoothly work-
I ing team but Coach Harry Wolter feels
j confident that the Cardinal ball players
■ will start the game with at least an
| even chance for victory.
J Wolter is satisfied with the showing
! his men have made during the few work
i outs they have been able to go through
! lately, and by the prospect for improve
| metit which they have exhibited.
Rain Halts Practice
A water soaked diamond has pre
, vented any practice for the last three
days hut the Olympic team has also suf
fered from the same handicap which
I will help to keep things even. Wolter
believes that the team will have effective
team work as well as snappy individual
playing, for in practice several combina
| tions of the men have exhibited ability
! in working together.
•
The opening lineup for Stanford will
j be kept intact for only a few innings at
the most, for Wolter plans to send in as
j many men as he is able in order to get
: a line 011 their ability in actual play.
| At least 15 or 18 men will go in during
| the course of the game for Stanford.
1 The first inning will see the Cardinals
| line up as follows: Oviatt, pitcher;
j Sypher, catcher; Johnston, first; Gari
| baldi. second ; Cuddeback, third ; Busch,
I shortstop; Stewart, Weaver, and Nissen,
' outfielders.
Oviatt Shows Class
Oviatt has shown real pitching ability
j this season and Wolter expects him to
|be the king-pin of the hurling staff.
He and Sypher, first-string catcher, work
well together.
Other pitchers who may get into action
| during the course of the game are:
Philippi, Sobieski, and Reynolds, all from
1 last year's freshman ball team. Philippi
appears to have a slight advantage over
the others but their rapid improvement
during the last few weeks have made
! them likely material.
1 rr
The team will have a chance to dem
' onstrate its late revival of heavy hitting.
Members of the squad have been knock
ing the ball all over the lot, even though
the varsity pitchers have been offering
i their trickiest throws.
