# LINCOLN GREAT IN POLITICAL SAGACITY STATES DR. JORDAN
## February 12, 1807, Was Also Birthday of Charles Darwin 
### 
"Lincoln, from the point of political
sagacity," said Dr. Jordan at his con
ference last night, "is in a way the
greatest man who has ever lived. He
always had the faculty of saying just
the right word at the right time. His
most distinct quality, however, was in
always counting the cost, especially
in times of great crises."
Charles Darwin and Abraham Lin
coln were both born on February 12,
ISO 7. One was born in a mansion and
the other in a log cabin; both will be
remembered as the leading figures of
their time. "Lincoln may have split
rails, at least that is what they said in
the campaign speeches," remarked Dr.
Jordan, "but, then, so did I. However,
it was such hard work that I took the
first opportunity to quit it."
Darwin was in every way a model
scientist. He had a great and peculiar
persistence which kept him working
away for thirty years before publish
ing his findings. With the compara
tively meager scientific apparatus at
his command, Darwin was able to
change the aspect of practically every
field of study. He was not a dynamic
figure, but always slow and careful
and never ahead of the facts.
