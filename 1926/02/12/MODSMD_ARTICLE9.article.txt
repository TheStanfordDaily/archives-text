Beta Thefa Pi cinched the title in
League VIII by decisively trouncing En
cina Basement, 17 to 6. The fraternity
team held a decided advantage through
out the contest due to a superior offense
and effective defense. The freshmen hesi
tated to shoot at the basket even when
they had good chances, and their at
tempts to work the ball under the goal
were stopped repeatedly by the quickly
covering Beta guards.
The winners started out in the first
few minutues of play by running up six
points on baskets by Mannoccir and Watt.
Mannoccir contributed a field goal and
two baskets in quick succession near the
end of the half. Bushneli counted with
a field goal just as the pericxl ended,
giving his team a 13 to 0 lead over the
Encina quintet.
Brown Scores
Brown, Encina forward, found the
basket at the start of the second half
and rang up two goals in rapid order.
The Betas experienced a little difficulty
with their shooting in this half and
succeeded in adding but four more
points to their total. Mannoccir, Beta
center, kept up his high scoring with
11 points. Montgomery and Watt showed
to advantage in the guard positions f or
the winners. Brown and O'Sullivan
I played good games tor the freshmen.
Delta Tau Delta captured the placque
| in League VI by means of an easy win
| over Phi Sigma Kappa. The winners
played rings around the slowly moving
j t J ni Sigs, and had no trouble scoring a
\ 19 to 2 victory. Clever teamwork on the
| part of the Delta Tau players worked
j the hall down the court consistently
| where accurate shooting under the goal
I accounted for the majority of their points,
i The score at half time favored the win
; ners 11 to 2.

The Delta Tau scoring was about
evenly divided, a fact which shows the
effectiveness of their teamwork. Morri
son, Stewart and Meyers were respon
sible for the major part of the baskets
scored by the winners. Hawkins counted
for the only field goal scored by the
Phi Sigs. Morrison is credited with high
point honors with six markers. Stewart
and Meyers added four points apiece to
their team's total. Wise and James did
some effective guarding for the winners.

El Toro Defeats Encina

El Toro defeated Encina 4W in a
slow contest that finally dragged on to
an 8 to 5 decision. Both teams put up
a ragged exhibition that was marked by
a glaring inability to connect with the
basket on easy tries. The game was
roughly played and was marred by fre
quent fouling. The club team led at half
time, 4 to 3.
Knowles livened matters a little in the
second half by making two pretty bas
kets from the sidelines. El Toro showed
an improvement in teamwork in this pe
riod, but the effectiveness of good pass
ing was lessened by poor shooting. The
freshmen also had a number of easy
chances but were unable to find the
basket.
Fowler, EI Toro forward, was the
high scorer of the game, with two field
goals and two free throws to his credit.
Clifford accounted for the other El Toro
basket. Ludeke played a good game for
the winners in the standing guard posi
tion. Clark and Doyle gave the best
exhibitions for the freshmen.

The Independents won the title in
League VII with five straight victories.
The last was gained by a forfeit by
Delta Upsilon. Alpha Tau Omega's for
feit gave Phi Kappa Sigma third place
in League VII.

Beta Thefa Pi cinched the title in
League VIII by decisively trouncing En
cina Basement, 17 to 6. The fraternity
team held a decided advantage through
out the contest due to a superior offense
and effective defense. The freshmen hesi
tated to shoot at the basket even when
they had good chances, and their at
tempts to work the ball under the goal
were stopped repeatedly by the quickly
covering Beta guards.
The winners started out in the first
few minutues of play by running up six
points on baskets by Mannoccir and Watt.
Mannoccir contributed a field goal and
two baskets in quick succession near the
end of the half. Bushneli counted with
a field goal just as the pericxl ended,
giving his team a 13 to 0 lead over the
Encina quintet.
Brown Scores
Brown, Encina forward, found the
basket at the start of the second half
and rang up two goals in rapid order.
The Betas experienced a little difficulty
with their shooting in this half and
succeeded in adding but four more
points to their total. Mannoccir, Beta
center, kept up his high scoring with
11 points. Montgomery and Watt showed
to advantage in the guard positions f or
the winners. Brown and O'Sullivan
I played good games tor the freshmen.
Delta Tau Delta captured the placque
| in League VI by means of an easy win
| over Phi Sigma Kappa. The winners
played rings around the slowly moving
j t J ni Sigs, and had no trouble scoring a
\ 19 to 2 victory. Clever teamwork on the
| part of the Delta Tau players worked
j the hall down the court consistently
| where accurate shooting under the goal
I accounted for the majority of their points,
i The score at half time favored the win
; ners 11 to 2.

The Delta Tau scoring was about
evenly divided, a fact which shows the
effectiveness of their teamwork. Morri
son, Stewart and Meyers were respon
sible for the major part of the baskets
scored by the winners. Hawkins counted
for the only field goal scored by the
Phi Sigs. Morrison is credited with high
point honors with six markers. Stewart
and Meyers added four points apiece to
their team's total. Wise and James did
some effective guarding for the winners.

El Toro Defeats Encina

El Toro defeated Encina 4W in a
slow contest that finally dragged on to
an 8 to 5 decision. Both teams put up
a ragged exhibition that was marked by
a glaring inability to connect with the
basket on easy tries. The game was
roughly played and was marred by fre
quent fouling. The club team led at half
time, 4 to 3.
Knowles livened matters a little in the
second half by making two pretty bas
kets from the sidelines. El Toro showed
an improvement in teamwork in this pe
riod, but the effectiveness of good pass
ing was lessened by poor shooting. The
freshmen also had a number of easy
chances but were unable to find the
basket.
Fowler, EI Toro forward, was the
high scorer of the game, with two field
goals and two free throws to his credit.
Clifford accounted for the other El Toro
basket. Ludeke played a good game for
the winners in the standing guard posi
tion. Clark and Doyle gave the best
