Beta Thefa Pi cinched the title in
League VIII by decisively trouncing En
cina Basement, 17 to 6. The fraternity
team held a decided advantage through
out the contest due to a superior offense
and effective defense. The freshmen hesi
tated to shoot at the basket even when
they had good chances, and their at
tempts to work the ball under the goal
were stopped repeatedly by the quickly
covering Beta guards.

few minutues of play by running up six
points on baskets by Mannoccir and Watt.
Mannoccir contributed a field goal and
two baskets in quick succession near the
end of the half. Bushneli counted with
a field goal just as the pericxl ended,
giving his team a 13 to 0 lead over the
Encina quintet.
