One-hoss shay queeners
and long-hairs
T N the olden days when young folks queened
in one-hoss shays, hair-cuts came about once
a month. Today, however, men are more par
ticular about their appearance.
Especially is the College Man careful about the
impression his hair-cut makes. His hair must
be cut the way he wants it and with careful
workmanship.
Here at the Union, the barbers are skilled in
giving Collegians the carefully finished haircuts
that they demand. Come in and see for yourself.
Sincerely,
Jim & Ernie

We've never seen a Gaucho ride and throw the bolas neat
We've never heard Brazilians sing those lively "Santos Blues"
But, boy, we'll get all this—and more
