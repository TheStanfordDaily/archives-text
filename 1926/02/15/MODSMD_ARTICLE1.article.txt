# NEVADA DELIVERS SECOND BLOW TO STANFORD QUINTET
## FINAL SCORE 21 TO 16 Cards Completely Off Game In Last Practice Tilt Of 1925 Season 
### Jim Adams 
While the Stanford five repeated
their Thursday evening performance
of an amateur juggling act, the alert
little Nevada team seized the oppor
tunity to add injury to insult by
trouncing the Cards for a second time
Saturday night in the pavilion by a
score of 21 to 16. The Redshirts
trailed the entire game, never press
ing the Wolves for the lead except
once at the start of the game when
they come within a two-point distance.
It wasn't a question of a couple of
individuals being off their game it
was a question of the entire Stanford
team, which includes all of the twelve
men that played, being in a slump. As
individuals they played poor basket
ball; as a team they played worse.
Fredericks Stars
Fredericks was again the star of
the game, scoring ten points for
Nevada. His favorite trick was to
make a bee line for the basket with
a Redshirt running alongside for com
pany and then to drop the ball in as
.a matter of course. Goodale and Bream
also played commendable games. The
Nevada team was made up of fleet
footed gentleman who broke fast on
the offense and out-distanced the Card
defense in the race for their basket.
Clark almost started a Stanford
rally in the last few minutes of the
game with a long basket and a free
•throw but it ended up with Fredericks
scoring three points for Nevada. The
former player made two of the four
field goals for the Cards and was high
point man for his team with seven
tallies. His floorwork, however, was
no better than the rest of the team
and he was a party in the general
slump.
Many Subs Used
Kerr tried an even dozen players in
order to find a team but his efforts
failed. David started in place of Cap
tain Price but the latter went in early
in the first period. It was apparent
that if five of the Stanford twelve
could only get together and smooth
out their teamwork they could have,
perhaps, emerged victorious, but it
was ofjen a question whose side they
were on.
U. C. Beats Nevada
Throughout the entire game the
Stanford rooters were wondering just
how it was the Cards held California
18 to 17 when the Bears beat Nevada
35 to 10 in their second game. The
odds on California to win the next
match with the Cards probably took
a tremendous leap. Fortunately, the
Nevada games have no bearing on the
conference standing.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (16) Nevada (21)
David (1) F Goodale (4)
Clark (7) F Bream (5)
Jayred (2) C Watson (2)

their Thursday evening performance
of an amateur juggling act, the alert
little Nevada team seized the oppor
tunity to add injury to insult by
trouncing the Cards for a second time
Saturday night in the pavilion by a
score of 21 to 16. The Redshirts
trailed the entire game, never press
ing the Wolves for the lead except
once at the start of the game when
they come within a two-point distance.
It wasn't a question of a couple of
individuals being off their game it
was a question of the entire Stanford
team, which includes all of the twelve
men that played, being in a slump. As
individuals they played poor basket
ball; as a team they played worse.
Fredericks Stars
Fredericks was again the star of
the game, scoring ten points for
Nevada. His favorite trick was to
make a bee line for the basket with
a Redshirt running alongside for com
pany and then to drop the ball in as
.a matter of course. Goodale and Bream
also played commendable games. The
Nevada team was made up of fleet
footed gentleman who broke fast on
the offense and out-distanced the Card
defense in the race for their basket.
Clark almost started a Stanford
rally in the last few minutes of the
game with a long basket and a free
•throw but it ended up with Fredericks
scoring three points for Nevada. The
former player made two of the four
field goals for the Cards and was high
point man for his team with seven
tallies. His floorwork, however, was
no better than the rest of the team
and he was a party in the general
slump.
Many Subs Used
Kerr tried an even dozen players in
order to find a team but his efforts
failed. David started in place of Cap
tain Price but the latter went in early
in the first period. It was apparent
that if five of the Stanford twelve
could only get together and smooth
out their teamwork they could have,
perhaps, emerged victorious, but it
was ofjen a question whose side they
were on.
U. C. Beats Nevada
Throughout the entire game the
Stanford rooters were wondering just
how it was the Cards held California
18 to 17 when the Bears beat Nevada
35 to 10 in their second game. The
odds on California to win the next
match with the Cards probably took
a tremendous leap. Fortunately, the
Nevada games have no bearing on the
conference standing.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (16) Nevada (21)
David (1) F Goodale (4)
Clark (7) F Bream (5)
Jayred (2) C Watson (2)
Vinoenti (1) G Fredericks (10)
Biaggini G Clover
Substitutes for Stanford —Price (C),
