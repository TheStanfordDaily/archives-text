### Gordon French 
FRIDAY'S RESULTS
Sequoia I 22; Chinese Club 2.
Japanese Club 8; Delta Chi 5.
After a slow start in the first half,
the Sequoia I quintet overwhelmed the
diminutive Chinese by totaling sixteen
points while their opponents were held
! scoreless. In the other game played,
: the Japanese Club nosed out the Delta
Chi after a see-saw game.
Brandt did the heavy work for the
winners in the Sequoia-Chinese Club
tilt. His floorwork was good and he
had an uncanny habit of tossing the
; ball in the hoop from any position.
Stimpson showed up well as running
guard for the winners; besides guard
ing well his passing was accurate and
he sank a difficult shot. Fortine, cen
-1 ter, and Lentz, forward, each shot a
pair of baskets.
The first half was fairly even with
baskets by Fortine, Brandt, and Stimp
son giving the hall team a 6 to 2 lead,
Pay and Tan scoring a point apiece
for the Orientals. With the opening
1 of the second half the Sequoia five
| commenced piling up a large score,
j Fortine started the landslide with a
toss from underneath the basket, and
his shot was quickly followed by a
j difficult field goal by Brandt.
After several minutes of unproduc
tive play, Lentz made it 14-2 with two
baskets in rapid succession. From
' then on to the finish, the game was a
parade featuring Brandt, who tossed
in four baskets and brought his total
scoring up to twelve and easily gained
high-point honors.
Endo Whole Show
Endo was again the whole show for
the Japanese Club, with his all-around
ability. He scored six of his team's
eight points. His dribbling was fast
and tricky, although at times he took
things a little too easy. Horii did some
clever guarding for the winners.
Rowles played the best game for the
losers at running guard.
SufTern started the scoring for the
Delta Chi team with a neat goal. Endo
then proceeded to knot up the count
when he tossed the ball from behind
the foul line and it went in without
touching the rim. After several min
utes devoted to futile attacks at the
goal, Endo gave his team a two-point
lead when he sank a long shot. The
half ended a moment later, after
Slater, Delta Chi center, had made
the score 4-3 by shooting a free throw.
Second Half Close
Endo tossed in a fpul shot to start
the scoring for the second half, and a
moment later he made the score 6-3
with a second free throw. Again, for
several minutes neither team could
score, but finally Sano, Japanese Club
forward, increased the club's lead to
five by sinking a long shot. With the
score 8-3 against it, the Row squad
started a rally, but soon after Rowles
had made it 8-5 the game ended.
