# ERNIE NEVERS PLANS TO VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS THIS WEEK
## 
### 
,
Ernie Nevers will be on the campus ;
! sometime this week, according to a stale- j
•ment he made on returning to San Fran-j
,cisco last Friday from his Eastern in-,
vasion as a professional football player. |
Nevers played two games of football |
in Jacksonville, Florida, for which he re-j
ceived $26,600 and his transportation. He*!
| luckily, demanded an advance of $25,000
before lie left Santa Rosa, so when the j
financial end of the two Jacksonville |
games did not turn out as advantageously!
as the promoters expected, lie was still:
able to consider it a profitable venture.
Since his football games Nevers has j
been in Green F.ay, Wisconsin, where he
attended school in his prep days. Rumors j
| that lie was going to remain at Madison'
and finish his college work were un- j
j founded. While in Wisconsin he played |
with professional basketball teams for (
five games.
Ernie has received several offers from !
moving picture companies, but he has so;
; far turned all of them down. One cor- I
puration offered him $1,000 a week fori
as long as it used him, but how long he ■
would be used was not stated.
The St. Louis Browns start training at j
Tarpon Springs March 1, and as Nevers
.will have to report there at that time, lie.
will not have much time on the Coast.
When he signed the contract to play for |
the Browns his manager Finlaw Geary
saw to it that a clause was inserted that
allowed him to play football next fall if;
he so desired. He expects to play pro-!
fessional football for another season and |
if he clcans up as he intends to he will
run Red Grange a close second for foot
j ball earnings.
