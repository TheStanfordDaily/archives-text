# SECOND ELECTION WILL FILL SEVEN STUDENT OFFICES
## POLLS OPEN TOMORROW Candidates Failing to Get Majority Last Week On Ballot Again 
### 
Polls open tomorrow morning at
8:45 for the re-election of A.S.S.U.
and class offices which were not filled
in the election last Tuesday. The two
candidates receiving the highest num
ber of votes in the first election have
been placed on the new ballot.
The last-minute rush of nominations
doubled the number of candidates in
the last day of nominating. This made
as many as five people running for
the same office, and though several
of the candidates nearly got a ma
jority, the votes were too split up to
allow a decision. In two cases a candi
date lost out by less than thirty votes.
The polls will be open from 8:45 to
2 o'clock. Men will vote near the Law
steps, and the women at the polls
opposite the main entrance of the
Library,
The following are the candidates
and the offices not filled at the first
election:
