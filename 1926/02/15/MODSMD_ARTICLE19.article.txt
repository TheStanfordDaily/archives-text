# "Apple-Polishing"
## 
### 
It was with surprise that we read certain paragraphs of the letter
written to the Editor by "F. M. S." on the subject of "apple-polishing"
last week. The author, while placing himself in favor of informal dis
cussion between professor and student, claimed that a war on "apple
polishing," which he l>elieved to have been recently inaugurated, was dis
couraging not only "apple-polishers" but students earnestly desiring per
sonal interviews.
Such a crusade we had never heard of and our convictions on the
subject were strengthened Friday by the positive assertions of four Uni
versity professors that no such campaign was under way.
It cannot be gainsaid that "apple-polishing" is discerned by all wise
pedagogues no more than the canny buyer is unsusceptible to the wiles of
the experienced salesman; but to say that their dislike of it has led them
to ban all private discussion is to mislead. What unfortunate results
"F. M. S." has encountered in an attempt at informal interviews we do
not know; but it is possible that his timidity at some time has been
stronger than his actual desire for sympathy.
It is only natural that professors should frown upon "apple-polishing."
It is the hybrid of cheating and an attempt at discussion. As such it is
usually discernible, but the student who honestly attempts sympathy will
usually get it; providing of course, the professor is in favor of personal
contact. We have never failed to gain a sympathetic audience with a
Stanford professor, excluding the one or two occasions that we displayed
symptoms of "apple-polishing."
With "F. M. 5.," we have "professors whom we would feel honored
and happy to claim as friends, and we too "feel that a spirit of comrade
ship between the teacher and student is not foreign to a great university."
Perhaps in the past, professors have unintentionally made it difficult
for some to gain audience. Perhaps in the future, professors and students
l)oth will see their way clearer toward such discussion, devoid of "apple
polishing" traces.
OBSERVING THAT THE APPEALS directed at the roughs who
attend campus shows have had little force, the Daily suggests that in the
future the Dramatic Council distributes handbills and programs only to
the first floor patrons and complimentary tickets holders. Better yet,
literature might be circulated describing the fully equipped aeronautical
laboratory which is maintained by the engineering department.
The Daily Palo Alto staff will meet in the Daily office at 1 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.
