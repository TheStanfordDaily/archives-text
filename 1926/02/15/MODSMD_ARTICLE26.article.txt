Welcome to the Ambassadors from the courts of France,
Jean Borotra, Rene Lacoste, and Jacques Brugnon! It is
always good news when such splendid sportsmen come to
visit us, and when they are to engage in such thrilling
matches as those that commence this week, the visit is
doubly alluring.
The inimitable Jean Borotra, far more colorful than his
two companions, is as usual the center of attraction. The
fact that he is over here to defend the indoor title that he
won in 1925, the fact that lie recently defeated Lacoste in
the French covered court tournament, and the fact that he
is Borotra, the Bounding Basque, will bring many more
fans to the Seventh Regiment armory than Lacoste and
Brugnon together will attract.
The growth of the game of tennis in France since the
war has been astounding. Suzanne has been invincible in

that part of the world since tlve armistice, while an All-French final at the
Wimbledon tournament has been the bitter pill that the English were forced
to swallow in 1924 and 1925. And, to make matters complete last year, the
French also won the doubles and mixed doubles! Ah well, it should be so.
r l he game of court tennis started in France centuries ago, and when it pro
duces players like Jean Borotra we can forgive that lovely country for its
coffee, and for sending us Mascart and their Vinez.
France's arrival in the Davis Cup challenge round last year was a great
thing for the game, and as both Borotra and Lacoste carried Tilden to five
hard sets, the chance of seeing them complete again indoors is something to
jump at.
