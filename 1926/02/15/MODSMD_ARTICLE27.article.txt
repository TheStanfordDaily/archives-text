Bill Bowline was a sailor lad
As brave as you could wish,
He sailed out on the Jolly-0
Whose purpose was to fish.
Now out upon the codfish banks
The wind blew fierce and strong,
It filled the sails and blew the ship
Right mefrily along.
But Bill was hanging in the shrouds,
And when the wind began,
It blew the ship, but left old Bill
A-settling to the sand.
As he sunk down, the mermaids came
And swam around him there,
They caught him in their snow-white
arms
And bound him with their hair.
Bill was surprised, we must admit,
He ftelt it coming on him.
That he should catch the nimble fish
That swam about upon him.
But half were fish and half were girls,
And Bill was not so certain,
That if he started catching fish,
They'd think that he was flirtin'.
While he did thus deliberate,
And while his thought, was browned,
He found his troubles at an end,
Old Bill, he up and drowned.
