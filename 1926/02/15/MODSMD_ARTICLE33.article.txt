# PROSPECTS BRIGHT FOR TWO WINS OVER U.C. WATER POLOISTS
## Varsity, Babe Squads Begin Final Preparations for Games Friday 
### H. K 
With the Stanford-California water
polo games scheduled in the Encina
pool Friday afternoon, Ernst Brand
sten's varsity and freshman aquatic
squads are entering their last traunng
period with the prospects good for a
double victory.
Both varsity and first-year squads
have had daily, workouts since the
early part of the quarter, and though
not yet perfect in teamwork they
should be able to acquire polish dur
ing the next few days. Brandsten will
coach them in a few special plays and
put them through practice games ap
proaching the genuine article in length
and speed this week.
Cards Have Edge
The Cardinal teams will have an
advantage in training over the Blue
and Gold sevens who have been prac
ticing only since the first of the
month. The original plan was to hold
the water polo games last Friday, but
Brandsten agreed upon the new date
in deference to the wishes of the U.C.
coach, who felt that his men would not
be in sufficiently good condition to
furnish any competition at that time.
The odds in both games will be heav
ily on the side of the Stanford teams
â€¢who should add another pair to the
long unbroken string of victories
which Brandsten has piled up in both
water polo and swimming.
California will place her hopes on a
varsity team built around Captain
Paul Keene, Cliff Wayne, Dusty
Rhoades, and Sid Glasson. Jack Rob
ertson of the Olympic Club has been
acting as volunteer coach, and work
outs have been held in the new pool
of the Athens Club of Oakland.
Three Varsity Veterans
Arden Allen, captain, Bob Williams,
and Art Stewart are lettermen from
the previous varsity at Stanford.
Kryne Van den Akker is a member of
last year's freshman team. Phil
Brooks, Johnny Mack, Ken Graham,
Wardle Poulsen, and Bill Hinckle have
all had experience in water polo dur
ing their freshman years and in work
ing out with previous varsity teams.
Brandsten intends to use the follow
ing starting lineup: forwards, Van
den Akker, Stewart, Brooks; guards,
Allen (captain), Williams, Graham;
goal guard, Poulson. Mack will be sub
stitute goal guard, and Hinckle will be
alternate goal guard.
The loss of Skin Collett, last year's
goal guard who was of Olympic cali
bre, will be felt, but Poulson and
Hinckle have developed judgment
during the last month and both should
be able to outguess whatever shots
California makes.
Backfield Formidable
The Cardinal backfield lineup is
formidable, with two sprinters, Allen
and Williams, who have more speed
at dribbling the ball than anyone of
the squad. Both have improved the
accuracy of their shots greatly in the
past week and will probably score
almost as many goals as the forwards.
Brandsten has taken advantage of
the possibilities of his backfield and
has developed a style of play in which
the guards, whenever possible, swim
the ball the length of the tank for a
shot at the opposite goal while the
forwards pull away with their men.
