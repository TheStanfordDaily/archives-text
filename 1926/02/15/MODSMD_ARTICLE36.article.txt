# JONES REPORTS ON CHARITY WORK OF Y.M.C.A. IN CHINA
## 
### 
"Russia or the United States? Soviet;
theories and methods or American j
friendship and financial support? This |
is the great question before troubled j
China," says Tracy Jones, Y.M.C.A.
secretary in Canton, China, in a recent j
report letter to the Stanford Y.M.C.A.
Jones is the association worker among
students in Canton toward whose work
go the funds given by Stanford stu
dents in the "Stanford in China" drive.
"Keep faith in China," goes on
Jones. "She is passing through trou- j
bled days. But she has a great people, j
She must and will be brought into the
Christian family of nations."
Anti-Foreign Movement
Answering an inquiry relative to the
effect of the anti-Christian movement
in China, which is actually an anti
foreign movement, more than anti
religious, Mr. George Lerrigo, associ
ated with Mr. Jones in the work in
Canton, says: "The Y.M.C.A. is in a
particularly fortunate position at the
present time in China. From the be
ginning it has been our policy to put
the responsibility for management and
direction squarely on the shoulders of;
the Chinese. In Canton, for instance,
our three Chinese secretaries are able j
to carry on and our work goes ahead
just as though nothing had happened.
There are no adjustments of relation
ships to make. For years Jones and
myself have been only 'advisory' sec
retaries. Leung has been general sec
retary. And now as the wave of anti
foreign sentiment comes along, we
just step aside until it abates."
Program of Work
The program of work undertaken
by the Canton association includes an
extensive bible study qpmpaign, co
operation in the Canton Welfare
Movement, anti-opium propaganda, as
well as the general physical, education
al, and social program of the city
Y.M.C.A. with its big, well-equipped
building. Jones' work is especially
with the students of Canton, many
thousands in number, and cannot but
be of strategic importance during
these days of turmoil in China's life.
