# LAGUNITA NOW OPEN FOR NAVIGATION TO EXPERT SWIMMERS
## 
### 
Lagunita is now "open for navi
gation." Those who plan to canoe
on the lake this year will be re
quired to demonstrate certain
ability in swimming before being
allowed this privilege. Instead of
the swimming with an upset
canoe, as was formerly asked,
the test which will be given this
year will require the applicant to
swim for a distance of 200 yards
on the surface, 40 feet under the
water, and complete a dive for
a weight.
Those who have cards from last
year will not be required to take
the new examination, but will
have to present their cards for
resigning. Students wishing to
make arrangements for taking
this test are asked to get in touch
with Ernst Brandsten at Encina
Gym.
