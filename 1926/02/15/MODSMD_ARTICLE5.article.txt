# 1929 BASKET TEAM DEFEATS LIVERMORE BY 29 TO 9 SCORE
## Freshmen Show Improvement In All Departments Of Game 
### Joe Carroll 
In a game featured by the marked
improvement of their passing and
shooting, the Stanford freshmen de
feated the Livermore high school
quintet by a 28 to 9 score Saturday
night. The two teams clashed in the
pavilion as a preliminary to the Stan
ford-Nevada varsity contest.
Offensively the Cardinal babes
looked better than they have in most
of their games this year. The boys
handled the ball in a more workman
like manner than they have shown
heretofore this season, and several
members of the squad got their eyes
on the basket nicely. Several different
combinations were sent in, and all
seemed to be nearly on a par. The
reserve strength of the freshmen
augurs well for a Redshirt victory
when the Stanford yearlings meet the
Bruin cubs Friday night.
The Livermore players were held
to three field goals, and they converted
but three free throws. This low score
was due largely to the efficient guard
ing of Robb and the good defensive
work of the' rest of the Stanford bas
keteers. The Livermore outfit also ran
into some hard luck when it came to
hitting the hoop.
McCandless High Man
McCandless was again the high man
for the game, counting eight points
on field goals. Renzel followed him
closely with three baskets. Sexson
sank two nice shots from the field.
Robb, playing guard, went down the
floor to push in a short shot in addi
tion to looping a pretty goal from
about half way down the court.
Renzel and Osmonson, who started '
at forward, worked well together, as
did Sexson and Crary when they got I
in the game. Sexson had his pivot â– 
going nicely. Sibbett and Wilton did |
not get much of a chance to show j
their wares. Davis replaced McCand-1
less at center near the end of the game
and showed up fairly well. Lewis and
Robb were the class of the guards, al
though Kopp, Marks, and Worden
played a good game while they were
in.
Sherman Livermore Star
Sherman led the Livermore team j
in scoring with five points, and also
in working the ball down the floor.
McGlinchuy played with glasses in a
guard-frame but went well in spite of
this handicap. The Livermore team
has been more or less disrupted in its
last few games due to troubles with
the C.1.F., so that part of its poor
showing was due to this reason.
The lineup was as follows:
Stanford (28) Livermors (9)
Renzel (6) F McGlinchuy (2)
Osmonson F Vukota
McCandless (8) C Sherman (5)
Lewis (5) G Williams j
Robb (4) G Reboli (1)J
