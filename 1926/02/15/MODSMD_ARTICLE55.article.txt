# CHANGES PLANNED IN U.C. AWARDS SYSTEM
## 
### 
A slight revision of the basis for
making athletic awards is contem
plated by the Athletic Council of the
Associated Students of the University
of California, which has directed that
a committee be appointed' to investi
gate the present requirements for win
ning letters.
It is not expected that many changes
will be made, although the committee,
which is to be appointed by Charles
N. Mell, chairman of the Council, will
recommend a permanent system for
awards in freshman contests, and in
sports in which the Stanford games
are the major event of the season, and
in sports in which California does not
ordinarily meet Stanford. At present
freshmen are obliged to play ten min
utes of football in the Stanford games
to win their numerals. The boxing
team has no method for awarding
letters, as it does not meet Stanford.
