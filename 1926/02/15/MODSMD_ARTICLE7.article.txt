# NINETY-FIVE PIECE SYMPHONY PLAYS HERE TOMORROW
## SECOND CAMPUS CONCERT San Francisco Orchestra Led By Musical Director of National Fame 
### Herb Klein 
The San Francisco Symphony led
by Dr. Alfred Hertz will give a second
campus concert in the Assembly hall
tomorrow night at 8:15 o'clock. The
full orchestra of ninety-five pieces,
which is one of the great musical or
ganizations of the West, will be
brought to Stanford.
Under the leadership of Alfred
Hertz for the past ten years it has
constantly improved until it now occu
pies a foremost position. It has a rec
ord of maintaining its personnel rela
tively intact, many of its musicians
having been members for long periods
of time. It suffered less disorganiza
tion during the war than almost any
other orchestra as a result of the
large proportion of native-born musi
cians.
Violinist Scores
Miscliel Piastro, the new first vio
linist, scored a brilliant success in his
first campus appearance at the last
concert when he played as soloist in
Tchaikovsky's "Violin Concerto." Mi
chel Penha, the first cellist, is also
new this season.
Alfred Hertz, the conductor, has a
nation-wide reputation. Before the
war he directed all the German operas
for the Metropolitan Opera Company
of New York, and is acknowledged
as the foremost Wagnerian conductor
in the country. Under his direction
the orchestra has made several rec
ords of their numbers, chiefly of Wag
ner's works. Notable recognition was
recently given Hertz when he was
appointed to membership on a com
mittee of five foremost American con
ductors which will select the most
notable symphonic work produced in
this country. Hertz was picked along
with the conductors of the Boston,
Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago
symphony orchestras.
Notable Program
A notable program has been ar
ranged for tomorrow's concert. Tchai
kovsky's Fourth Symphony, which was
regarded by its composer as his finest
piece, will be the largest work on the
program. This symphony is notable
for its contrasting moods and fiery
finale movement.
The other selections are more near
ly "popular classics." "Danse Macabre"
by Saint Saens is a distinctive work,
both for the supernatural legend
which it depicts and the attractive
rhythms of the weird dance. "The Sor
cerer's Apprentice" is an example of
the possibilities of the modern orches
tra in expressing humorous situation
and in suggesting the sounds of na
ture.
The Overture to "Euryanthe," one
of Weber's great operas, will complete
the program. It is melodious and gives
a miniature synopsis of the opera in
music.

Notable Program
A notable program has been ar
ranged for tomorrow's concert. Tchai
kovsky's Fourth Symphony, which was
regarded by its composer as his finest
piece, will be the largest work on the
program. This symphony is notable
for its contrasting moods and fiery
finale movement.
The other selections are more near
ly "popular classics." "Danse Macabre"
by Saint Saens is a distinctive work,
both for the supernatural legend
which it depicts and the attractive
rhythms of the weird dance. "The Sor
cerer's Apprentice" is an example of
the possibilities of the modern orches
tra in expressing humorous situation
and in suggesting the sounds of na
ture.
The Overture to "Euryanthe," one
of Weber's great operas, will complete
the program. It is melodious and gives
a miniature synopsis of the opera in
music.
The San Francisco Symphony led
by Dr. Alfred Hertz will give a second
campus concert in the Assembly hall
tomorrow night at 8:15 o'clock. The
full orchestra of ninety-five pieces,
which is one of the great musical or
ganizations of the West, will be
brought to Stanford.
Under the leadership of Alfred
Hertz for the past ten years it has
constantly improved until it now occu
pies a foremost position. It has a rec
ord of maintaining its personnel rela
tively intact, many of its musicians
having been members for long periods
of time. It suffered less disorganiza
tion during the war than almost any
other orchestra as a result of the
large proportion of native-born musi
cians.
Violinist Scores
Miscliel Piastro, the new first vio
linist, scored a brilliant success in his
first campus appearance at the last
concert when he played as soloist in
Tchaikovsky's "Violin Concerto." Mi
chel Penha, the first cellist, is also
new this season.
Alfred Hertz, the conductor, has a
nation-wide reputation. Before the
war he directed all the German operas
for the Metropolitan Opera Company
of New York, and is acknowledged
as the foremost Wagnerian conductor
in the country. Under his direction
the orchestra has made several rec
ords of their numbers, chiefly of Wag
ner's works. Notable recognition was
recently given Hertz when he was
appointed to membership on a com
mittee of five foremost American con
ductors which will select the most
notable symphonic work produced in
this country. Hertz was picked along
with the conductors of the Boston,
Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago
symphony orchestras.
