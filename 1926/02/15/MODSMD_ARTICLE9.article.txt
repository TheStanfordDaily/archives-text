# ROVER SHOW FILLED WITH GOOD BURLESQUE HOKUM
## 
### Dudley Ross 
We liked the Rovers; we think the
campus liked the Rovers; we think
that nobody but puristic highbrows
would not like the Rovers. Perhaps
those who clamor "art for art's sake"
regret that Ram's Head decided to
matriculate at dear old (Inaertnameof)
but it is more than certain that the
campus appreciates good old* burlesque
more than synthetic "Rooshian dram
mer."
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys" was hokum,
damned good hokum. But we don't
care about that. What is vastly more
important is that it was a good show
and that (Insertnameof) was saved
and the mort-gage removed. And the
final touch was the substitution in the
cradle long ago of Jack Dalton —vill-
yan—for the three Rover Boys.
Few Faults Found
The prodigal son of those perennial
humorists, Mike Ely and Dave Lam

son, was clever and brilliant. Unde
nably there were faults in the produc
tion —but what of it? In such a show
a tremendous plot is superfluous; it
only befogs the issue and restricts
too closely both the players and the
action. It is too bad that many of the
wise-cracks were lost in the midst of
the audience.
Probably not for a long time again
will the campus see a production of
this sort so well cast. Dave Mannoccir
did his work superbly; and he put on
a smooth-running show, in which in
terest lagged in perhaps only one or
two spots. Les Kiler's sets fitted in
well with the production.
Choruses Good
Those choruses were good. The
boys were all transformed into beauti
ful girls, and they were coached in
their steps by Chrysella Kiler so that
there were few miscues and that the
stage did not collapse under the bat
tering of some two dozen ponies, beau
ties, and gentlemen.
The songs were also mostly good.
"I'm the Villyan," and Jean Wake
field's two songs, "My Golden Dream"
and "Red Hot Vamp" were probably
the best. Jack Wiggin did good work
in arranging the music, but the pre
sentation Friday night seemed too
labored.
Now this guy Cass is some come
dian, while Len Schwartz and the ir
repressible Parks were excellent in
the roles of the other two Rovers.-As
Tom, the fun-loving Rover, A1 Cass
had a part difficult to make consist
ently funny, but he carried the house
with him throughout the show. As
(Insertnameof's) yell leader he was
perfect; as a lover he was "swell";
and everybody was asking "where's
the third one" when as Windrush he
was throwing a monkey wrench into
the diabolical works of Jack Dalton.
Parks and Schwartz
The eldest Rover, Charlie Parks,
was inclined to overdo his part, to
bur.lesque the burlesque. Len Schwartz,
the athletic Rover, did not have much
of an opportunity to show his capa
bilities, but what lines he had he put
over well.
A1 Robertson did marvelously as
the "villyanous" Dalton. His work
will take its places as one of the best
bits of burlesque seen on the campus
stage. His command of the situation
was at all times most excellent.
The production was fortunate in
having two such female impersonators
as Pat Kelley and M«lzar Lindsay.
(Insertnameof) was happy to have
such a campus beauty as was Kelley.
Lindsay was a good scheming Dru
silla. As president of ( )
Del Daves did not have much to do,
but he made a splendid characteriza
tion of the college head.
Black-Face Stuff
It is a pity that the black-face stuff
didn't get over as well as it might
have. Lee Flood and George Eardley
labored under parts which appeared
to have been rather weakly put to
gether. Sid Lewis and (Insertnameof's)
football squad put in but a brief ap
pearance but were a mighty effective
athletic "aggregation." Sam Rover
must have had great support from ice
man No. 77.
The Hal Boone-Van King dance was
well executed and pleasing. The three
numbers from former campus shows
got over uniformly well, with Charlie
Simons' repetition of his former hit
again getting a good hand.
Ram's Head's programs must not be
forgotten; we are greatly indebted to
the society for more comprehensive
views of dear old (Insertnameof) uni
versity's campus and celebrities. It is
very regrettable that the D.P.A. critic
was tone-deaf to the roll of drums, so
that it was impossible to be on the
watch for the JOKE.
