We liked the Rovers; we think the
campus liked the Rovers; we think
that nobody but puristic highbrows
would not like the Rovers. Perhaps
those who clamor "art for art's sake"

a tremendous plot is superfluous; it
only befogs the issue and restricts
too closely both the players and the
action. It is too bad that many of the
wise-cracks were lost in the midst of
the audience.
Probably not for a long time again

a smooth-running show, in which in
terest lagged in perhaps only one or
two spots. Les Kiler's sets fitted in
well with the production.
Choruses Good
Those choruses were good. The
boys were all transformed into beauti
ful girls, and they were coached in
their steps by Chrysella Kiler so that
there were few miscues and that the
