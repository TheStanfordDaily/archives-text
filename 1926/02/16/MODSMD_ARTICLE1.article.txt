# VARSITY TO MEET SANTA CLARA NINE IN SEASON OPENER
## "IF WEATHER PERMITS" Broncos Playing on Home Lot Handicapped by Little Practice 
### Herb Klein 
Harry Wolter's baseball varsity
â€¢players will at last have a game wheii
they make a trip to Santa Clara to
morrow afternoon to meet the Bronc
nine on their own diamond, provided
the weather conditions are such that
a game is at all possible. The two
games so far scheduled with the
Olympic Club and the one game with
the San Francisco police have been
cancelled because of poor weather
conditions and the players are anxious
to see some real action.
Sam Agnew, who recently signed a
contract with the San Francisco ball
club, is the Santa Clara coach. He has
great confidence in his team this year
and claims that several of the players
show big league possibilities. Be that
as it may, Stanford should have
plenty of competition tomorrow. Ag
new is an old-timer in baseball and
knows the ins and outs of the game
thoroughly. He has spared no effort
to turn out a capable team from his
material at Santa Clara.
Both Nines Lack Practice
Both squads will be equally handi
capped by lack of practice. The Stan
ford tossers have not have had a real
workout in more than a week. Con
siderable class has been shown when
ever they have played and the men
should have sufficient fire to put up
a stiff game.
Wolter will start the same lineup
in the game as was planned for the
Olympic Club's reception last Satur
day. He plans to substitute players
-constantly so that he will have a line
on the playing ability in actual compe
tition of eighteen or twenty men.
Rivalry is so keen for every place in
the Cardinal lineup that there is no
berth cinched.
Tod Oviatt will start on the mound
with Sypher at the receiving end. The
pair make an excellent battery. Oviatt
has exhibited the best stuff of any of
the varsity twirlers and Sypher is one
of the best catchers seen at Stanford
in some time. He has plenty of pep
and is a hitter from away back.
Chuck Johnston will take care of
the first sack. He played this position
last year and showed lots of speed
and precision at the job. Garibaldi
starts at second and Captain Cudde
back at third. Cuddeback is second
to none at this position when he is
going well. His ability with the stick
should be a big help in the pinches.
Buscli, from last year's babe nine,
will take the shortstop position. In the
field Weaver and Nissen of the 1928
yearling outfit, and Jerry Stewart will
start.
