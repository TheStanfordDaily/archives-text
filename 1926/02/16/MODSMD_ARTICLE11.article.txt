# Freshmen Waiters Limited By Row Conference Rule
## 
### 
Freshmen will be debarred from ob
taining employment as waiters in fra
ternity houses later than the second
week of the winter quarter each year,
but those who obtain positions previ
ous to this date will not be forced to
give up their places. This rule was
passed at a meeting of the Interfra
ternity Conference laßt night.
This ruling will not be retroactive;
first-year men who have received
waiters' positions this quarter after
the second week will be allowed to
keep their jobs. Proposals to com
pletely bar freshmen from this em
ployment were rejected after it was
pointed out that such a regulation
would prevent men forced to earn
their own way from attending the Uni
versity.
It was decided to strictly enforce
rushing rules and though definite ac
tion was postponed until the next
meeting the sentiment of the confer
ence was toward more severe penal
ties for violations. Suggestions were
made for the rushing rules for the
coming season. It is expected that
only a few changes will be made in
the system followed last year. The
rushing season will be earlier this
season, starting in April. Its length,
which was three weeks last year, may
be shortened.
