# GYMNASIUM TEAM CANDIDATES PLAN ELIMINATION MEET
## 
### 
Tryoutees for the gym team will
! engage in a meet in Encina gym
1 Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock. All
| men may register up to that time.
' Freshmen and graduates are eligible
for this meet, although they are not
; allowed to compete in the contest with
i California.
Coach C. W. Davis states that in
the East gym work is considered as
1 a leading minor sport. He says that it
I is an accepted fact that no sport is so
j beneficial as gymnastics, for it gives
I a more all-around development to the
: body than any other kind of athletic
I exercise. An attempt is being made to
develop a team here in order to com
pete with Southern California colleges,
; where gym has been increasing in im-
I portance for some time.
Until last year a man was allowed
1 to compete on a varsity gym team for
four years. This included his freshman
year. But under a recent ruling this
sport must conform to Conference eli
| gibility rules the same as major
J sports. However, Davis is anxious to
have the freshmen try out at this meet
so he can get a line on their capabili
' ties for next year and give them the
training they require.
Six regular events which are used
in competition with California will be
run off Thursday: parallel bar, high
; horizontal bar, side horse, long horse,
1 tumbling, and the rings.
Wayne Smith, captain, has been per
-1 forming skilfully on the rings and
| horizontal bars, and Guy King is doing
well on the mats. Ray Taylor and
Sterling Beckwit.li, both third-year
men, will be among the men trying
out. Several good freshmen have been
working out regularly. Philip Stitt has
1 shown good form on the high bar and
j the parallel bar, while Robert Gooden
|is handy with his legs on the side
horse. Ellis Abbe will not be able to
! enter the meet because of a turned
I ankle suffered in practice.
