The Redshirt middleweights looked
like a fair team in the with the
Palo Alto high school alumni last
week, but one of the forward positions
needed changing, according to Davis.
King will replace Blazier at forward.
The former has been getting his eye
nicely on the basket in the past week
or so, while Mazier has been in a
slump. Cook went well at center last
week and he will start tonight in San
der's place. The lineup will be King
and George, forwards; Cook, center;
