# Debating

### 
Interest in delating at Stanford received a decided impetus last year
when the Oxford team visited the campus for an encounter with the Uni
vrsity team. Practically every seat in the Assembly hall was taken and,
strange to relate, a goodly representation of students attended.
It was undoubtedly the continental air and halo of travel about the vis
itors' heads that caused the increased attendance. Like a Japanese admiral
or a dethroned prince, the English debaters—scions of distinguished fam
ilies and members of an ancient college—proved good drawing cards. Like
the cat that gloried in looking at the king, the audience felt itself privileged
in merely attending the debate.
The visitors proved to be more than a sideshow attraction, however, by
exhibiting a type of argumentation foreign to most American audiences.
In fact, that part of the University which attended were unexpectedly de
lighted at the evening of entertainment they received.
The Oxford type of informal discussion seeming the most appropriate
for Stanford debates, it was soon after adopted and used by both men and
[women. Tomorrow night, according to reports, much the same style will
be used when the University of Southern California debates Stanford on
the question. "Resolved : That the younger generation's freedom of thought
and action is detrimental to society." The Stanford debaters last year
met the humorous attack of the Oxfordians in a capable and interesting
manner; with an attack.and defense that compared favorably with the
English type.
Those who enjoyed the Oxford debate last year are certain to indulge
in a similar evening tomorrow. Instead of lengthy orations based on dry
statistics, the audience tomorrow, we l>elieve, will hear a series of informal
and hunlorous discussions more than worth the time of a university student.
