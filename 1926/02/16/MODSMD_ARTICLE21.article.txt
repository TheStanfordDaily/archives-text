No sporting event of the past few months has aroused as much interest
as the tennis match today in which Suzanne Lenglen, French tennis star,
retained her title of woman champion of the world by defeating the youth
ful Helen Wills of California in two hard fought sets.
The sporting world had long been anticipating the match, because of
the condemnation which had been directed at the French player for her
indifference. Yet when the arrangements were actually completed, Miss
Wills' aspirations must have been considerably dampened by the quotations
on the betting odds.
But neither the fact that she was rated as the underdog, nor that she
was playing to a foreign crowd in a strange place, seem to have affected
her game. According, the press reports, she was the cooler of the two;
and the scores of the sets, 6-3, 8-6, indicate that she did not die easily.
