# Election Returns
## 
### 
In the past it has been customary to delay publication of the Daily on
clays of elections in order to give complete returns. The plan has not
■worked out satisfactorily. It requires practically two hours to count the
votes, and another two hours to print the papers.
Today the Daily goes to press at the usual time without the election
returns. Results may be had by consulting bulletins which will be placed
on the boards at the Engineering and English corners, and at the Postoffice ;
or by phoning Palo Alto 1074.
Picturesque descriptions of reality from the Cornell Daily Sun :
"Steel dragons, belching smoke and cinders, come careening along steel pathways
down the slopes into Ithaca. They pull up at the station, painting, and disgorge
brightly-colored, poisonous-looking bits of femininity upon the platform who are rap
idly gobbled up by the simpering, foolish, overdressed collcgc boys. This is Junior
Week at Cornell."
Progress of witty editorial writing as promoted by the Southern Cali
fornia Daily Trojan:
"Both the Stanford and the U.S.C. teams were continually callcd for foul play
by the referee, who appeared to be having quite a playful evening with the whistle.
They should take the toy away from the lad before he blows his had off."
