## Crossing the Bar 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
To jump over a stick almost six feet, nine inches from
the ground requires certain things not possessed by the
average human being, most assuredly, whether or not the
feat in itself has great bearing on the human race in gen
eral. The fact remains that Harold Osborn, a young school
teacher of the Middle West, can jump higher than any one
else at present, and how he does it I will attempt to tell
you.
In the first place, Osborn was blessed by nature with a
fine physique and an unnatural amount of spring in his
legs. In the second place, he liked track athletics, and
received the splendid coaching while at the University of
Illinois of Harry Gill, one of the ablest track and field
mentors in the country. Then, too, Osborn kept fine care
of himself, and was always in training. But most import
ant of all he had brains —lots of ambition, and the de-

termination and perseverance to succeed.
There's the background. Here's his actual jumping form. He runs toward
the crossbar from a distance of about twenty-five feet, at an angle of forty
five degrees. He jumps off his left foot at a previously designated take-off
mark on the ground or floor. As his body leans back, the right foot and left
arm swing up. bringing the body up parallel to the bar on his left side. His
right leg and left arm cross the bar first.
If his head crosses the bar first, it is a dive and a foul jump. His left leg
b-ends at the knee beneath his right leg, which is out straight, and the whole
body, at first facing away from the direction of his approach, rolls over so
that it is facing downward. He land on the same leg he took off from,
sometimes assisted by his arms to make it easier, sometimes on both feet.
