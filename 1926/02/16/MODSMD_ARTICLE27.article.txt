Episode IV

A Female Bull Session
(Continued from Friday)
The following portion of the conver
sation that took place after my room-!
! mate, Maurathea Providence, returned
about 1:30 a.m. from a fraternity
dance gives a transient glimpse of the
state of mind into which the average J
co-ed is brought by living two weeks
at college, fit also contains mention of
a subject that later played a leading
role in my life.)
"And when the seventh dance came." 1
Maurathea continued. "I was hardly
able to stand up but we went and got
some more punch and did Ihe Charles-!
ton again."
"Why didn't you ask him to stop,"
inquired Jane, who lived next door.
"But I didn't want to stop, and he j
told me he was president of the Ham's !
Head, and played substitute back on !
the football team, and besides that he
said that he played in the house inzz
band, and he has the keenest roadster.
It was a Buick "
"That's nothing," Frances inter- j
rupted, "the fellow I went out with
the other night had a Packard straight
eight, and besides T wouldn't even con-1
sider going out with anything less i
than a Cadillac."
"Yes, hut this hoy," Maurathea con
tinued, "doesn't have a very big allow
ance; of course that doesn't make any
difference to me, and his uncle is rich,
so that's all right. But the other fellow
I danced with well, he simply out-'
classed them all. He was simply swell.
"Was ho a nice boy?" I ventured, j
Maurathea looked at me with a
mixed expression of sympathy and j
contempt. "You evidently haven't
learned much yet,"
She paused for a moment and then !
lending forward she almost whispered.
"Have you ever heard of the Red Peril
of Palo Alto?"
"No, what is it," we all asked at
j once.
"I don't know, neither does anyone
' else, hut all the men talk about it and

! it seems to have something to do with
| everything."
| For some reason, Ido not know why,
! the image of the man who had fol
lowed me to my morning class two
days before, flashed into my mind.
