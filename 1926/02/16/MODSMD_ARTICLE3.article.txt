## 
### 
Valentines that caused more
and bigger heart flutters than any
other kind received by bashful
swain or coy maid were the little
blue ones sent out yesterday by
the scholarship committee. The
number of students favored by
them were fewer this mid-quar
ter than last, only 281 warnings
for unsatisfactory work in one
subject and nineteen for unsatis
factory work in two subjects be
ing given out, as compared with
306 single and 51 double "smoke
ups" last quarter, according to
Mrs. C. A. Huston, secretary to
the scholarship committee.
