# CERAMICS DIVISION FORMED IN STANFORD MINING DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
A division of ceramics engineering
under the direction of Professor W.
F. Dietrich has recently been estab
lished by the Department of Mining
and Metallurgy. It is anticipated that
the installment of courses in this new
branch of engineering at Stanford
will fill a long-felt need on the Pacific
Coast for graduate engineers who pos
sess a knowledge of the testing and
manufacture of clay and porcelain
ware, refractory bricks and furnace
linings, terra cotta pipes, building
materials, and other ceramic products.
With the exception of the Univer
sity of Washington, none of the uni
versities in the West at present offer
special courses in this line of work.
During the spring quarter of the pres
ent year courses in ceramic testing,
clay analysis, the ceramic industry,
and ceramic plant design will be of
fered by the Department of Mining
and Metallurgy, and outlines of the
subjects of these courses will be in
cluded in the University Announce
ment of Courses for 1926-1927.
Apparatus Installed
Laboratories in the Mining building
are at present being equipped with
apparatus for making accurate physi
cal measurements of ceramic raw ma
terials and finished products, and for
the shaping and burning of materials
for small scale tests. Provisions will
also be made for the carrying on of
commercial tests with the co-opera
tion of the ceramics plants in Cali
fornia. Emphasis in the University
courses will be laid more upon train
ing in the use of instruments of pre
cision and upon scientific methods of
attack, than upon the details of com
mercial manufacturing processes.
The undergraduate curriculum will
be the same as that now in effect
for students electing the mining engi
neering option of the pre-mining cur
riculum, or for those taking the gen
eral curriculum of the School of En
gineering. The courses in ceramics
will be included in the two years of
post-graduate work leading to the en
gineer's degree.
In discussing the growing import
ance of the ceramics industry and the
value of the new courses to engineers
Professor Dietrich said:
Growth of Ceramics Rapid
"The history of ceramic education
dates back 30 years with the estab
lishment of a department of ceramics
headed by Dr. Edward Orton, Jr., at
the Ohio State University. Since that
time the scientific advance of the
ceramic industries has made tremen
dous strides and the more progressive
leaders have long since abandoned the
rule of thumb methods that for cen
turies have throttled progress in the
technical control of clay working and
burning.
"At present there are ten schools
in the United States granting ceramic
degrees, with a total enrollment of
over 500 students. These schools have
had nearly 500 graduates, who are now
distributed among the enamel, glass,
heavy clay, refractories, terra cotta,
and white ware industries, with a
small percentage in research and
teaching. Only 14 per cent of the
ceramics graduates are not in cera
mics work. This is a much smaller pro
portion than in most other lines of
engineering.
"The demand for ceramic graduates
is such that six students who recently
graduated from an eastern school had
their choice of over sixty positions.
The ceramic industries in California
are already firmly established and sub
stantial growth is predicted for the
future. It is believed that the oppor
tunities in ceramics throughout the
western United States are greater 'han
in any other single field of mining
engineering."

courses will be laid more upon train
ing in the use of instruments of pre
cision and upon scientific methods of
attack, than upon the details of com
mercial manufacturing processes.
The undergraduate curriculum will
be the same as that now in effect
for students electing the mining engi
neering option of the pre-mining cur
riculum, or for those taking the gen
eral curriculum of the School of En
gineering. The courses in ceramics
will be included in the two years of
post-graduate work leading to the en
gineer's degree.
In discussing the growing import
ance of the ceramics industry and the
value of the new courses to engineers
Professor Dietrich said:
Growth of Ceramics Rapid
"The history of ceramic education
dates back 30 years with the estab
lishment of a department of ceramics
headed by Dr. Edward Orton, Jr., at
the Ohio State University. Since that
time the scientific advance of the
ceramic industries has made tremen
dous strides and the more progressive
leaders have long since abandoned the
rule of thumb methods that for cen
turies have throttled progress in the
technical control of clay working and
burning.
"At present there are ten schools
in the United States granting ceramic
degrees, with a total enrollment of
over 500 students. These schools have
had nearly 500 graduates, who are now
distributed among the enamel, glass,
heavy clay, refractories, terra cotta,
and white ware industries, with a
small percentage in research and
teaching. Only 14 per cent of the
ceramics graduates are not in cera
mics work. This is a much smaller pro
portion than in most other lines of
engineering.
"The demand for ceramic graduates
is such that six students who recently
graduated from an eastern school had
their choice of over sixty positions.
The ceramic industries in California
are already firmly established and sub
stantial growth is predicted for the
future. It is believed that the oppor
tunities in ceramics throughout the
western United States are greater 'han
in any other single field of mining
engineering."
A division of ceramics engineering
under the direction of Professor W.
F. Dietrich has recently been estab
lished by the Department of Mining
and Metallurgy. It is anticipated that
the installment of courses in this new
branch of engineering at Stanford
will fill a long-felt need on the Pacific
Coast for graduate engineers who pos
sess a knowledge of the testing and
manufacture of clay and porcelain
ware, refractory bricks and furnace
linings, terra cotta pipes, building
materials, and other ceramic products.
With the exception of the Univer
sity of Washington, none of the uni
versities in the West at present offer
special courses in this line of work.
During the spring quarter of the pres
ent year courses in ceramic testing,
clay analysis, the ceramic industry,
and ceramic plant design will be of
fered by the Department of Mining
and Metallurgy, and outlines of the
subjects of these courses will be in
cluded in the University Announce
ment of Courses for 1926-1927.
Apparatus Installed
Laboratories in the Mining building
are at present being equipped with
apparatus for making accurate physi
cal measurements of ceramic raw ma
terials and finished products, and for
the shaping and burning of materials
for small scale tests. Provisions will
also be made for the carrying on of
commercial tests with the co-opera
tion of the ceramics plants in Cali
fornia. Emphasis in the University
courses will be laid more upon train
ing in the use of instruments of pre
cision and upon scientific methods of
attack, than upon the details of com
mercial manufacturing processes.
