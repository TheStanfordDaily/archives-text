# Botany Head Completes Work on Plant Book
## 
### 
Professor Douglas H. Campbell of
the Botany department has completed
the manuscript for his book entitled
"The Outline of Plant Geography."
The volume, now on the press, will be
published by the MacMillan Company.
The book is planned to fill a
need: though it is written to interest
the general reader in the subject of
plant distribution, it is also planned
that it may also serve as a reference
book for botanists.
Professor Campbell has incorporated
in this book the notes, specimens,
sketches, photographs, and findings
that he has accumulated for thirty
years during his journeys to many
parts of the world.
