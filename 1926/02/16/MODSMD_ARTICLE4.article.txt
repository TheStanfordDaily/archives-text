# STARS TO FACE CARD TEAM IN COAST GOLF PLAY
## Eight Stanford Men Entered In Coming Tournament At Pebble Beach 
### 
Members of the Stanford varsity
and freshman golf teams will meet
formidable representatives of Califor
nia, Washington, U. S. C., and the
Southern Branch in the third annual
tournament of the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Golf Association, to be held
this week-end on the Pebble Beach
links of the Del Monte Country Club.
Captain Dick Lang, president of the
association, will lead the Stanford
delegation, with Eddie Meyberg, Neal
Miller, Ashton Stanley, and Bob Ver
milya completing the list of varsity
performers. The freshmen who will
make the trip are Ward Edmonds,
Robert Syer, and Herbert Fleisliacker.
Play in the eighteen-liole qualifying
round will open Saturday morning,
when all but sixteen players will be
eliminated. Saturday afternoon the
first round will start, the tournament
being run off in the form of match
play. Monday the final play-off of
thirty-six holes will take place, the
perpetual trophy going to the cham
pion. Finalists and semi-finalists will
receive gold medals.
California, whose representatives
won the championship in 1924 and
1925, will send Jack Nounan, captain,
John Tait, and Lloyd Thomas. Lauren
Upson, brilliant Berkeley golfer and
present holder of the perpetual trophy,
will not play in this tournament, which
considerably weakens the Blue and
Gold, but Thomas, his teammate, run
ner-up to him last year, is counted on
to go far in the coming contest.
Harold Thompson, semi-finalist in
the California state amateur cham
pionship last summer, will represent
5.8. U.C., and Charles Hunter and Jack
Westland are coming from Washing
ton to play. Hunter reached the semi
final round in the last state amateur
tourney, while Westland is former na
tional intercollegiate titleholder. From
the University of Southern California
two entries are expected.
