# RARE HANDIWORK OF EAST SHOWN IN STANFORD MUSEUM
## Ikeda Collection Contains Expensive Ming Vase, Peach-Blow Art 
### Barbara Dewlaney 
Invaluable specimens of Japanese
and Chinese handicrafts, paintings,
clothes, and other rare old articles of
the Orient are contained in the Ori
ental collection in the Stanford Mu
seum. This collection is one of the
best in the Museum.
Much of the Oriental work is con
tained in the Ikeda collection which
represents the best pieces from the
private collection of one of Japan's
greatest art connoisseurs, S. Ikeda.
He was an enthusiastic collector of
porcelains and similar ware. After his
death, which ended a life devoted to
the welfare of his country, his widow
and son desiring to raise a memorial
to him, planned to send this collection
to the British Museum. The entire
proceeds were then to be given in
memory of the father and husband
to the Emperor to aid the war fund.
While the son was taking the col
lection to England, he visited Mrs.
Stanford in her San Francisco home.
Becoming interested in the story of
the memorial, she decided to purchase
the entire collection for the Stanford
Museum.
Rare Vase Included
Of special note in the Oriental col
lection is the cloissonne ware which
includes various shaped bowls, in
cense burners, and vases. One incense
burner which was owned by the em
perors of China and which was made
in the Kanghsi period, 1662 to 1722
A.D., is in the shape of Kylin, a dragon
horse. The collection of cloissonne
ware contains an old vase
made during the Ming period four
hundred years ago. It is one of the
rare pieces of the world, and it is
doubtful if there is a similar specimen
in America.
This vase of the Ming period is part
of the loot from the Imperial Palace
at Peking when it was sacked by the
Allied Armies. The vase was secured
by Captain Pedersen who later gave
it to Dr. J. D. B. Stillman. The vase
is the first gift, as far as known, made
to the Museum after Leland Stanford
Junior's death.
Has "Peach-Blow" Specimen
Among the many priceless vases
and bowls in the Oriental collection
is a beautiful genuine peach-blow
china vase of the Kanghsi period. The
vase has rare coloring and is an ex
ample of the old peach-blow which
has never been successfully repro
duced since the death of the discov
erer of the peculiar glaze and color
ing. The discoverer never disclosed
his secret. On the vase there is an
etching, a scroll-work design, evident
ly traced on the white glaze and tilled
in with rare color. Not long ago a
vase of this ware, eight inches high,
sold in New York for $15,000.
An exhibit of jade, both green and
white, contains two unusual white
jade bowls which are about seven
inches in diameter. The bowls are un
usual because they are carved out of
single pieces of jade. It is difficult to
find pieces of jade large enough to
make bowls of this size. A green jade
cup with cover and stand is another
exquisite specimen of the jade collec
tion.
Japanese Paint Silk
The examples of Japanese painting
on silk are worthy of note. Since the
Japanese paint directly on silk, era
sures can not be made, and the paint
er must make perfect strokes as he
paints. A striking picture for its color
is the "Peacock and Peahen" by Nam
mei, a pupil of the famous Buneho.
One of the most artistic paintings is
"Dogs" by Hokusai, a famous artist
who lived about a century ago and
founded his own school.
Another interesting exhibit in the
Oriental collection is that of ancient
and modern Chinese coins presented
to the Museum in 1892 by Charles Sey
mour. Money dating back to more than
two thousand years before Christ is
shown. There are examples of the
sword cash, fork cash, knife cash, and
the later cash with holes, as well as
specimens of the money coined begin
ning in 1893 which is similar to Ameri
can coins.

A Chinese fraternity has been in
stalled on the Tulane campus.
