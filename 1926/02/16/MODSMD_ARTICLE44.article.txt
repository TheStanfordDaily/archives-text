# WISCONSIN JUNIOR PROM PLANS CALL FOR HEAVY EXPENSE
## 
### 
Total expenditures at the Junior
Prom at the University of Wisconsin
this year have been estimated as
$90,000. In spite of this expense it is
planned to make the dance the most
conservative and most unostentatious
prom for years.
The mathematician of a Wisconsin
paper has gathered these statistics:
about one hundred and fifty men will
purchase new tuxedos at an average
cost of $50; another hundred and fifty
will rent them at $5 each; four hun
dred girls will supply themselves with
formal dresses at an average cost of
$64 each.
Accessories, including shoes, vest,
shirt, socks, studs, ties, and scarf,
and head dress, fans, and footwear, in
cluding slippers and hosiery, and flow
ers for the women, are estimated to
amount to $22,700. This will mean an
expenditure of about $10,700 for the
men, and $12,000 for the women.
Dinner will be a less expensive mat
ter, since it is estimated for the crowd
at about $600. The taxis here will
mount up to $15,000.
All stags and spectators will be ex
cluded from the prom. In previous
years there has been difficulty in fix
ing the responsibility for disorder on
the floor of the dance, so the commit
tee has taken this means. The stu
dents will be wholly responsible for
the evening.
A queen of the prom has been cho
sen who maintains a rather unique
policy. She has not bobbed her hair,
and admits that marriage is her goal
in life.
