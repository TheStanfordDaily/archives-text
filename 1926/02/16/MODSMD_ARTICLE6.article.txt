Roughs' seats will be sold at the box
office before the concert tonight for
50 cents. Regular tickets are priced
at $1.25, $1.75, and $2.25.
The program arranged by Dr. Hertz
for tonight's concert is made of selec
tions calculated to be especially en
joyable to a university audience.
There is variety and contrast in the
four compositions, and all are melo
dious and excellently orchestrated.
Their appeal is as strong to the indi
vidual untrained in music as to the
experienced artist.
Opens With Weber
The opening number will be the
overture which precedes Weber's
opera "Euryantlie." The opera, with
its improbable plot, is seldom per
formed, but the overture, because of
its splendid spirit and charming melo
dies, is a favorite concert number and
is prominent in the repertoire of every
orchestra.
"Danse Macabre'' by Saint Saens
has a unique appeal. It is a piece of
music with a decided "program"; that
is, it represents a certain definite story
or series of events. There is an old
legend that once a year at midnight
Death comes into the graveyard and,
seating himself on a tombstone, fid
dles a dance to which the skeletons
dance until dawn comes.
Saint Saens, the foremost French
composer until his death a few years
ago, took the weird tale as his theme
and wrote around it a remarkable
work. Twelve strokes are heard an
nouncing the midnight hour. Then
comes the discordant sound of Death's
battered fiddle tuning up. A wild rat
tling dance begins which gets more
and more furious until a cock's crow,
imitated in a remarkably life-like man
ner by a wind instrument, ends the
grim revel.
Paul Dukas, a contemporary French
composer of great ability, especially
in the line of organ music, wrote "The
Sorcerer's Apprentice," which will be
played next. Like the previous com
position it is based upon a myth.
It abounds in musical humor and
grotesque suggestions. The story is
that of the apprentice who wished to
make magic spells like his master, the
sorcerer. He succeeds in charming
an ordinary broomstick into drawing
water, but is panic stricken to find
that he does not know how to break
the spell when the water begins to
rise. The sorcerer himself finally
comes back and breaks the incanta
tion and drives the apprentice away
for his foolishness. A theme on the
bassoon suggests the awkward and
jerky movements of the broomstick.
The program's major work is Tchai
kovsky's Fourth Symphony. This com
position, in four movements, runs the
gamut of musical effects, sometimes
brilliant and overpowering, other
times lyrical and charming. It was
regarded by Tchaikovsky himself as
his best work and exhibits the great
Russian's genius for splendid effect.
The finale movement is a great burst
of dramatic vigor and force.
