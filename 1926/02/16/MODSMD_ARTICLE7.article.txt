# CALIFORNIA SPRINT MEN DOPED TO BE BACKBONE OF TEAM
## 
### 
University of California, Feb. 16. —
This year the University of California
track roster will present a formidable
array of talent that should garner a
large number of points during the
coming season.
Led by Captain Barber, the Bruin
sprinters are figured to carry away a
majority of the points. Schwab, win
ner of the sprints in his freshman
year, and Roehrig are two other likely
j prospects. In the field California will
be well represented in the discus and
shot put, with Carey, Francis Gerkin,
Marcus, and Phillips.
With Dodson, Sterling, and Ban
j croft to throw the javelin, the Bears
are likely to finish in the front of
j this division. However, the real cause
of worry lies in the lack of material
in the jumps. Bondshu is the only
reliable broad-jumper on the team and
the Cardinals loom as a big favorite
in this event. Hampton is the only
man that has done six feet or better
in the high jump on the Bruin squad
and with only these two men showing
anything worthwhile in their respec
tive events Coach Christie will be
forced to develop new material.
February 23 has been set as the
opening date for the interclass. There
will be several events during the first
day and the rest of the events w'll be
run off on February 25. This will be
the only chance the varsity squad
[will have for competition before its
j first meet with the Olympics March 6.
