### Gordon French 
After four hard-fought games, two
fraternities, Kappa Sigma and Delta
Tau Delta, and two club teams, Break
ers and El Tigre, remain in the run
ning for the intramural basketball
championships after the first play-offs
yesterday. All of the games were well
played, with the Breakers squad show
ing the best form both on offense and
defense.
After Crener, El Toro forward, had
tossed in a nifty bucket, Delta Tau
Delta started off as if it intended to
completely swamp its opponents. Mor
rison, Delta Tau forward, knotted the
count at two all, and a moment later
James, the fraternity's running guard,
sank a difficult shot. A short basket
by King of the Row squad made it 6
to 2, Morrison making a point on a
free throw and Myers tossing in a long
basket, Delta Tau led 9-2. Just before
half-time Ludeke, club guard, made
good a free throw.
El Toro Rallies
Myers added to the Delts' lead at
the start of the second half by shoot
ing a field goal, but at this point El
Toro staged a rally that threatened
to sweep its opponents' nine-point lead
away. However, the gun went off with
the club team two points behind. Clif
ford started the rally by sinking a
shot without touching the rim; he soon
followed this shot with a free throw
and a second basket. At this point an
over-anxious El Toro player fouled
Morrison, who tossed in the free throw,
but Clifford made it 12-10 with a diffi
cult goal. Before the club team could
; organize its offensive, the game was
over.
Clifford was the outstanding offen
! sive player for the losers with seven
I points, but at times his individual
playing hindered his squad's team
work. Spud Harder played an aggres-
I sive game at running guard for El
; Toro and was chiefly responsible for
keeping the offensive in his quintet's
hands during the second half. Myers
and Morrison were high scorers for !
: the winners with four points each,
i James played a stellar game at guard
i for Delta Tau Delta.
Tigre-Beta Game Close
Up to the last few minutes, the El
Tigre-Beta Theta Pi tilt was nip and
; tuck with neither team able to obtain
a decisive lead. El Tigre started off
in front and never relinquished the
lead, although several times it was in
danger. Woodliead sank a foul shot |
and a short basket to give El Tigre j
a 3-0 advantage. Sanborne, diminutive I
club forward, increased the lead to
5-0, but then the tide turned and the |
Row five came up to within one point j
of the lead by half time. This was ac
complished by successive goals by
Bushnell and Mannoccir.
El Tigre started off the second half
with a bang, with Brown, forward,
contributing two points. With the
score 8-4 against it, Montgomery, Beta
guard, tossed in the ball from the cen
ter of the court to cut the club quin
tet's lead in half, but Woodhead re
taliated with another basket. Not to
be outdone, Mannoccir sank a shot;
from near the foul line to make it
10-8, El Tigre's favor. Stockbridge
made it 12-8 for El Tigre with a nifty |
shot, and Brown ended the scoring
with another goal from field.
Kappa Sigs Win
As in the El Toro-Delta Tau Delta '
tilt, the Kappa Sigma team gained a
commanding lead in the first half and
a rally by its opponents fell two points 1
short of victory. The Phi Delta five
outscored its rivals 10 to 4 in the j
second half but the 11 to 3 lead of
the Kappa Sigs was too much for j
them to overcome.
Middleton played a good all-around |
game for the Kappa Sigs at center
and was their high scorer. Garibaldi,
Phi Delt forward, who scored six of
his seven points in the second half
and was the leader in the rally, was
the high-point mail for the game. New- j
kirk played an aggressive game at :
I
running guard for the winners besides ;
tallying three points.
Theta Xi Swamped
The Breakers completely swamped
the Theta Xi team in impressive
fashion by an eighteen-point margin, j
though several times the Theta Xi
squad attempted rallies. The club
team's forwards, Carlsmith and Cook. j
though lighter and shorter than their
six-foot adversaries, completely out

played them without difficulty. Their
aim was excellent and they followed
in on their shots and often succeeded
in taking the ball away from the
Theta Xis.
The Breakers gathered in thirteen
points before allowing their opponents
to score. Carlsmith and Bush, with
two baskets each, were responsible for
eight points, while Sypher and Cook
each tallied twice. Foul shots by Free
man and Anderson, Theta Xi, and a
field goal by Freeman brought the
score up to 13-4 at half-time.
Rally Continues
Cook made a free throw good for
the Breakers to start the second half,
but Theta Xi continued its rally. Two
baskets by Anderson in rapid succes
sion made the spectators grow inter
ested, but the club team regained its
stride at this point and scored almost
at will for the rest of the game. Carl
smith and Cook led the scoring for the
remainder of the contest with six
points apiece.
High-point honors for the game were
divided between Cook and Carlsmith,
who made ten points each, while
Bush, running guard, contributed six
points. Bush and Compton did some
effective guarding during the tilt. The
Theta Xi team appeared to be off its
game last night.
Tomorrow afternoon the semi-finals
of the intramural play-offs will be
played. At 4:15 Delta Tau Delta meets
Kappa Sigma; at 5 El Tigre will bat
tle the Breakers.
