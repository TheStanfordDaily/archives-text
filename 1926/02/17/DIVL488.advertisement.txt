CHARLIE CHAPLIN U»
"THE GOLD RUSH"
A dramatic comedy written and
directed by Charlie Chaplin
Man's Greed —For gold turned
into comedy that will rock you
with laughter. Hardships—Of the
Klondike Btampede made to
seem uproariously funny. Hunger
Pangs—The basis of antics so
clever that they make you forget
pain. Lovesickness — Becomes
the foundation for Chaplin tricks
that rouse hilarity. Blizaards —
Switched into boisterous gales
and blustery shouts of glee.
Freezing Cold — Brings the
warmth of laughter that never
creases, always increases.
