# VARSITY CONCEDED SMALL CHANCE 10 BEAT CALIFORNIA
## Hopes of Victory Founded on Possible Stalness of California Five 
### Jim Adams 
Chance√ü of the Cards to put the
skids under California next Saturday
night and end the unbroken string of
fourteen basketball victories held by
the Bears, were considerably lessened
by the dismal showing of the Red
ahirts in their two games against
Nevada last week. The Blue and Gold
squad, on the other hand, put in a
successful week-end by trimming the
U.S.C. and Southern Branch fives by
impressive scores.
U.C. May Slump
There is one possibility which might
favor the Stanford five in the second
encounter of the two teams. The Cali
fornia quintet is drawing towards the
end of a long schedule of games with
out having shown staleness in one of
them to any degree. If basketball
teams do go stale, and it is a fact that
they ordinarily do, the time is about
ripe for California to experience a
slump. They returned to Berkeley
Monday, after having played two suc
cessive games in the South and by
rights should have seen plenty of bas
ketball. However, Coach Nibs Price is
probably anticipating the same thing
and will be carefully guarding his men
against staleness.
Granting that the Bears may be a
little basketball worn, the Stanford
team may make things rough going
provided they have climbed out of their
own pitfall. A Stanford victory will
mean a tie in conference standing. A
third tilt will be staged at Oakland re
gardless of the outcome of next Sat
urday's match. In the thi-rd game the
ltedshirts can present their greatest
strength to the Berkeley five.
Anderson Reports
Anderson reported for practice yes
terday but is still limping and will
probably be of little service in the first
game. His ankle fooled the x-ray and
appears to be free of broken bones.
He may be able to play in the third
game of the series. The failure of the
Cards to function properly in the
Nevada games cannot be attributed
to weakness at standing guard, how
ever. The Redshirts were slow on get
ting back to their defensive positions
when they lost the ball and left the
back guard in a bad situation many
times.
Kerr has been holding practice in
the Enclna Gym this week to get the
players accustomed to wooden back
boards such as are used in the Oak
land Auditorium.
