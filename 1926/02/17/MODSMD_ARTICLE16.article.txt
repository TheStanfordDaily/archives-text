# FRESHMAN NINE TO MEET ALAMEDA ON SATURDAY MORNING
## Rain Has Held Up Practice; Strength of 1929 Team Is Not Known 
### 
The Stanford freshman baseball
team will meet the Alameda high
school nine Saturday morning at 10
o'clock in its first game of the seaschi.
Because of rainy weather the fresh
men have been able to practice very
little during the past month. Conse
quently their strength is unknown.
Whatever line Coach Wolter has so
far been able to get on the babes in
dicates that they will develop into a
strong aggregation. At present the in
field is quite well organized but the
outfield has not yet been fully de
veloped. Because of the wet weather
the varsity diadond has been the only
field available, so the freshman team
has had the equivalent, of about two
weeks' practice.
It is expected that Alameda will
send a strong team against the fresh
men. Last year the preps were one
of the strongest nines that the babes
met during the season.
The lineup which will start against
Alameda on Saturday is: Winter, first;
Hartley, second; Roger, shortstop; Har
der, third; Miller and Muller, catchers;
and Lewis and Kearn, pitchers. The
outfield has not yet been definitely
decided upon, but it is probable that
a number of men will be tried in the
positions.
