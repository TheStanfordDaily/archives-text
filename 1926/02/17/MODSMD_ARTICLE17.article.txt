# CALIFORNIA TEAM IS RESTING FOR GAME WITH CARD CAGERS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 17.â€”Alter defeating the Trojans in
Los Angeles last week, the California
varsity is resting up for the final games
with Stanford. The Bruins had four
days of strenuous work, and most of the
men are a bit tired.
In the Trojan contest Captain Benny
Holmes was high point man. Benny s
improved shooting has strengthened the
team, which should make a big difference
when it comes to playing Stanford on
Saturday. Big Bill liiggans, the star
center of the Bruins, was not up to form
on Friday, but came hack strong Satur
day, when he garnered 14 points. In the
Trojan contest Vern Carver was second
only to Captain Holmes in points scored.
His foot, which did not bother him in
either contest, will be in fine shape for
the Stanford game.
Coach Nibs Price, in calling off prac
tice, is guarding against the possibility
of the men going stale. He will be satis
fied with keeping them in their present
form and acquainting them with the Oak
land floor.
