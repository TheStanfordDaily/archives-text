# DEBATERS CLASH TONIGHT ON MENACE OF YOUTH'S FREEDOM
## U.S.C. to Uphold Younger Generation, Opposing Stanford Views 
### 
"Resolved, That the younger gener
ation's freedom of thought and action
is detrimental to society" will be the
subject for discussion in the annual
dual debate between Stanford and the
University of Southern California. The
Stanford affirmative team, Theodore
F. Baer and George N. Crocker, will
meet Sam E. Gates and Arthur Syvert
son of the opposing team at 8 o'clock
this evening in the Assembly hall,
while Stanley Weigel and Fred Com
bellack, the Cardinal negative team,
debate Manuel Ruiz and Stanley Hop
per at Los Angeles tomorrow night.

Question Much Discussed

The question chosen for the debate
this evening is one that is attracting
considerable attention throughout the
United States. A great many social
problems such as the apparently lax
morals among young people, the dis
appearance of family ties and disci
pline, and the growth of divorce and
crime, are being attributed to the free
thought of the younger generation.
Youth and the bootlegger are particu
larly associated.
The exact responsibility of the
younger generation for the evils that
prevail in the social world will be dis
cussed, the Stanford pair, Crocker and
Baer, maintaining that youth's free
dom is a social menace. The U.S.C.
debaters will hold the opposite view,
endeavoring to show that youth's free
dom is beneficial rather than injurious.
An informal discussion of the ques
tion, treating both sides of the ques
tion for debate, is the aim of the op
ponents this evening, rather than an
argument over technicalities or the
presentation of statistics. For this
reason the debate both here and at
Los Angeles will be no-decision affairs,
in an endeavor to eliminate the dis
satisfaction that has been voiced over
decision debates.
Baer fs Informal
Baer, who will open the debate, is
an informal speaker, using a conver
sational style, while Crocker has a
more polished and formal delivery.
The latter will close the debate for
