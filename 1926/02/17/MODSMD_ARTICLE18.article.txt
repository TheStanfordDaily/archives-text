# DEBATERS CLASH TONIGHT ON MENACE OF YOUTH'S FREEDOM
## U.S.C. to Uphold Younger Generation, Opposing Stanford Views 
### 
"Resolved, That the younger gener
ation's freedom of thought and action
is detrimental to society" will be the
subject for discussion in the annual
dual debate between Stanford and the
University of Southern California. The
Stanford affirmative team, Theodore
F. Baer and George N. Crocker, will
meet Sam E. Gates and Arthur Syvert
son of the opposing team at 8 o'clock
this evening in the Assembly hall,
while Stanley Weigel and Fred Com
bellack, the Cardinal negative team,
debate Manuel Ruiz and Stanley Hop
per at Los Angeles tomorrow night.

Question Much Discussed

The question chosen for the debate
this evening is one that is attracting
considerable attention throughout the
United States. A great many social
problems such as the apparently lax
morals among young people, the dis
appearance of family ties and disci
pline, and the growth of divorce and
crime, are being attributed to the free
thought of the younger generation.
Youth and the bootlegger are particu
larly associated.
The exact responsibility of the
younger generation for the evils that
prevail in the social world will be dis
cussed, the Stanford pair, Crocker and
Baer, maintaining that youth's free
dom is a social menace. The U.S.C.
debaters will hold the opposite view,
endeavoring to show that youth's free
dom is beneficial rather than injurious.
An informal discussion of the ques
tion, treating both sides of the ques
tion for debate, is the aim of the op
ponents this evening, rather than an
argument over technicalities or the
presentation of statistics. For this
reason the debate both here and at
Los Angeles will be no-decision affairs,
in an endeavor to eliminate the dis
satisfaction that has been voiced over
decision debates.
Baer fs Informal
Baer, who will open the debate, is
an informal speaker, using a conver
sational style, while Crocker has a
more polished and formal delivery.
The latter will close the debate for
Stanford with the final rebuttal of
three minutes. Opening speeches will
be fifteen minutes, with each side of
the question having sixteen minutes
for rebuttal.

The Stanford chapter of Delta Sig
ma Rho, national debating society,
will entertain the U.S.C. debaters and
Coach Allan Nichols during their stay
on the campus. A luncheon was held
this noon in the Union at which Stan
ley B. Houck, national president of
Delta Sigma Rho, was the guest of
honor. A reception will be held fol
lowing the contest this evening for
the debaters.
Graham H. Stuart of the Political
Science department will be the chair
man for the debate this evening, ac
cording to an announcement by Baer,
debating manager. A.S.S.U. cards must
be presented.

per at Los Angeles tomorrow night.

Question Much Discussed

The question chosen for the debate
this evening is one that is attracting
considerable attention throughout the
United States. A great many social
problems such as the apparently lax
morals among young people, the dis
appearance of family ties and disci
pline, and the growth of divorce and
crime, are being attributed to the free
thought of the younger generation.
Youth and the bootlegger are particu
larly associated.
The exact responsibility of the
younger generation for the evils that
prevail in the social world will be dis
cussed, the Stanford pair, Crocker and
Baer, maintaining that youth's free
dom is a social menace. The U.S.C.
debaters will hold the opposite view,
endeavoring to show that youth's free
dom is beneficial rather than injurious.
An informal discussion of the ques
tion, treating both sides of the ques
tion for debate, is the aim of the op
ponents this evening, rather than an
argument over technicalities or the
presentation of statistics. For this
reason the debate both here and at
Los Angeles will be no-decision affairs,
in an endeavor to eliminate the dis
satisfaction that has been voiced over
decision debates.
Baer fs Informal
Baer, who will open the debate, is
an informal speaker, using a conver
sational style, while Crocker has a
more polished and formal delivery.
The latter will close the debate for
Stanford with the final rebuttal of
three minutes. Opening speeches will
be fifteen minutes, with each side of
the question having sixteen minutes
for rebuttal.

The Stanford chapter of Delta Sig
ma Rho, national debating society,
will entertain the U.S.C. debaters and
Coach Allan Nichols during their stay
on the campus. A luncheon was held
this noon in the Union at which Stan
ley B. Houck, national president of
Delta Sigma Rho, was the guest of
honor. A reception will be held fol
lowing the contest this evening for
the debaters.
Graham H. Stuart of the Political
Science department will be the chair
man for the debate this evening, ac
cording to an announcement by Baer,
debating manager. A.S.S.U. cards must
be presented.

Completion of details for the na
tionalization of Kappa Tau Pi, inter
denominational religious fraternity,
were made at Oklahoma A. & M.
"Resolved, That the younger gener
ation's freedom of thought and action
is detrimental to society" will be the
subject for discussion in the annual
dual debate between Stanford and the
University of Southern California. The
Stanford affirmative team, Theodore
F. Baer and George N. Crocker, will
