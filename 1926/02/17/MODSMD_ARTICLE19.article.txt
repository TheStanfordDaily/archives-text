# JUNIOR WOMEN WIN CLOSE BASKETBALL GAME FROM SENIORS
## 
### 
The junior women's basketball squad
defeated the seniors 11 to 10 yester
day afternoon despite a fourth-quarter
rally of the 1926 women. The seniors

scored first in the game, but the jun
iors followed at once with a field goal,
and built up a lead of seven points by
the end of the third quarter. The sen
iors began to score in the fourth quar
ter, and the ball was in junior terri
tory when the final whistle blew.

According to the custom for prac
tice games, all players of both squads
played in the game. There were many
shifts in the junior lineup especially,
which in several instances consider
ably weakened the 1927 team. Few
changes could be made in the senior
team, as only eight players were avail
able.
