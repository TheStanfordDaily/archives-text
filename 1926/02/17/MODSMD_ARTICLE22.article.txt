The editor of the Oregon Daily Emerald has neatly summed up the
plight of college columnists. The editorial which appear in a recent issue
of the northern paper follows:
"A few remarks bordering on the personal for a moment or two;
being an attempt at vivid introspection.
"College editors are not interested in whta is rightâ€”they want
to know what is wrong. That is, what is wrong is right, and what
is right isn't interesting. And if they haven't something to cry
about they aren't happy.
"For instance: The editor of the Obcrlin Review is crying Ire
cause the Oberlin curriculum is obsolete; the U. of Washington
Daily editor is crying for a student union; the University Daily
Kansan editor is crying because of suspicioned dirty politics among
the women ; the Montana Kaimin editor is crying because of the re
cent degradation of the word 'collegiate'; the Daily Trojan editor of
U.S.C. is crying because of the severe basketball referees.
"And now the Oregon Daily Emerald editor is crying because
there aren't enough things around here to cry about."
