# ROWBOATS INCREASE SIZE OF LAKE FLEET
## 
### 
The Lagunita fleet has been aug
mented by three rowboats from Lake
Searsville, brought from the resort by
Manager Brandsten for rental to stu
dent oarsmen. Brandsten plans to have
a "University" fleet consisting of eight
canoes and six rowboats in operation
soon for the benefit of the lake
patrons.
The swimming tests are being given
daily at the Encina pool for men swim
mers by the coaching staff. The only
change over last year's requirements
is the distance swim which has been
lengthened from 100 feet last year to
200 yards this season. However, those
that have passed the requirements
last year are qualified to lake privi
leges in the "permit" book. It is esti
mated that between 750 and 800 have
qualified in the last two years for lake
privileges.
