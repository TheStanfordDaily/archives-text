# SPORTS OF 1926
## A 						Tough Tar 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
When Paul Berlenbach told Bold Michael McTigue to go j
and get a reputation, if he wanted to fight him again, and j
suggested that he beat Delaney or Huffman, he paid the
last-named fighter quite a compliment. And there are even j
some ring worms who doubt if Paul could trim the tough
Huffman himself. This ex-sailor is a fine prospect, without j
any doubt, and he arrived with a large explosion in 1925. j
Eddie did something that many highly-touted coast fight- j
ers couldn't do when he came to New York and made
good. He showed his stuff in his first battle, when he
decisively whipped Jack DeMave, and then, when he and
Ad Stone put up their million-dollar fight that so few were
lucky enough to witness, he had all the experts predicting
a rosy future for him.
Before Huffman came East, he beat Bob Roper, Tony !
Fuente, and Bert Colima, among others, so it can be seen'

that his record isn't studded with set-ups. He was also light-lveavyweight.
champion of the United States Navy, and you know how those gobs can fight.'
Charley Cook, known as the Prince of West End Avenue, Huffman's mana- j
ger, is an extremely wily handler of boxers, and has sense enough not to |
rush his protege along too fast. A fight between Eddie and Carpentier would ;
go well with Charley, it is said, or between Huffman and McTigue. But 'tis
also said that many a fighter with a reputation wants no part of Eddie's game. |

He is a smaller edition of Tom Sharkey, Huffman is, boxes well, is young j
and strong, and has unlimited stamina. Ambition is his middle name, so watch 1
him go—a world's title is his goal!
