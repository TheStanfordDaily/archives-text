Kat U house. Verdi Green (the million

proaching in the distance.
Sister Susie —Now, Dear, I hope you '
won't mind but the house is really in
a terrible condition. You know seven
of our maids departed just before
rushing began and now we have only
four left and we just can't keep the
place in order with that little help.
Verdi —My, what a darling door mat j
j you have.
(Sister Whoopee and Sister Shriek

| cast distrustful looks at each other
and then reorganize Verdi and lead
her solemnly into the house.)

lobby of the Ritz Hotel and the display
window of a flower store combined.

j house mother, the faculty member, the
, alumnus, and everyone else including
| the cook. Enter Sisters Falseface,
Heavyline, and Sicklysweet from the j
frenzied upper regions.)
Sister Heavyline (wildly embracing
Verdi) —Georgy, darling, how are you?
! (Then, in a loud whisper) Gee it seems
like a hell of a long time since we
went on that wild tear together up to
the Purple Bat.
Sister Susie —I beg your pardon,
Ophelia, but I don't believe I Intro-1
duced you to Verdi Green.
Sister Heavyline—Verdi which?
(She looks more carefully at Verdi)
Oh, I beg your pardon. I
Exit Sister Heavyline.
Sister Sicklysweet—lsn't it wonder-1
ful to think that the lake is full.
Verdi —What, lake?
Sister Falseface —Won't you come j
over and sit by the fire?
Verdi —Oh, is that a fire over there.
(Sister Whoope gives her a dirty
look from behind.)
Sister Shriek —My, what a lovely
design that is on your dress.
Sister Susie (Aside to Shriek) —You
idiot, that's where she wallowed in the
fresh paint on the front porch.
(The cook throws' out the dishwater
from the kitchen window thus an
nouncing (hat dinner is ready.)
Scene lll—The dining room table
looking as it never did before.
(Near the end of the table sit five
rushees trying to figure out which
forks to use for their fruit cocktail.)
Sister Goldigger—Have you seen the
arboretum yet?
Verdi —Oh, you mean that beautiful
statue that they say changes with the
seasons of the year.
Sister Goldigger—Yes No I
mean Won't you have a nut?
(Sister Whoopee gives the beloved
Sister Goldigger a dirty look.)

(Silence while the soup is being
served.)
Sister Shriek —Won't you have some
more nuts?
Sister Nubnora (from across the
table) —Yes, this is rushing week, you
know.
(Sister Whoopee chokes on a spoon
ful of soup. Time out for Sisters
Whoopee, Goldiger, and Shriek.)
