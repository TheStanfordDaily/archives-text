# CONCERT OF HERTZ, ORCHESTRA PROVES BRILLIANT, COLORFUL
## Conductor Stresses Dramatic Quality in Series of Notable Works 
### 
Alfred Hertz and the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra gave a concert
in the Assembly hall last night which
might serve as a model in the selec
tion and rendition of numbers which
aim to combine popular appeal with
musical worth. The three works per
formed were melodious and easy of
comprehension but full of surprises
for the listener. Last night's concert
was the last which the orchestra will
give under the auspices of the Stan
ford Symphony Committee. They will
be heard again on the evening of
Founders' Day in the Memorial
Church.
Overture Typical
The overture to "Euryanthe" by
Weber was typical of its composer's
style with its sweep and lyrical pass
ages. Weber's music seems surpris
ingly modern in spirit and arrange
ment considering the time of its com
position, and Hertz played it with the
emotional contrast and dramatic feel
ing which modern music demands.
The next two numbers, "Danse Mac
abre" by Saint Saens, and "Sorcerer's
Apprentice" by Dukas, added a flavor
to the program by their unconvention
ality and unique interest. Both had a
special appeal outside of their purely
musical worth, yet the playing of the
orchestra was so co-ordinated and bal
anced that the oddity was always sub
ordinated to the real melodic and
orchestral effects.
Violin Concerto Good
In the "Danse" Mischel Piastro, the
orchestra's new first violinist, added
new laurels to the ones he gained in
the last concert here when he played
a violin concerto. Piastro piayed the
rough, discordant tones which repre
sent the tuning of Death's battered
old fiddle, with spirit and his usual
fire.
"The Sorcerer's Apprentice" demon
strated the marvelous effects which a
clever, composer, aided by an under
standing conductor, can get from the
modern orchestra. The effect of the
gurgling, rushing sound of flowing
water! was unmistakable. Daring
chords and chaotic passages pro
claimed the work to be modern in
j
harmonization and orchestration. The
sustaining interest never flagged, how
ever, and the audience was decidedly
appreciative of the piece.
Tchaikovsky's Work Brilliant
Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony
was brilliant and dramatic â€”almost
melodramatic in parts. In its four
movements almost every orchestral
effect known to compel the attention
of the listener and thrill his senses
was used. The third movement was
delicate and charming. The string in
struments were all plucked pizzicato
fashion throughout the entire move
ment with remarkable effect.
