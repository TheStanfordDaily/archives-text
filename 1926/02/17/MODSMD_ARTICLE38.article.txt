# OLD BOY MOANS AT DEARTH OF HUMOR IN CLASS OF 1929
## 
### 
The Class of 1929 has little,
if any, sense of humor, accord
ing to statistics compiled by lite
Old Boy, patron saint of Chap
arral. This assertion, although
vehemently denied by the ad
mirers of Encina Hall jokes and
pranks, has been made on the
basis of the number of contribu
tions turned in, or rather, not
turned in, for the publication in
the comic by the first-year stu
dents.
"Last year at this time," says
the editor, "several very good
freshman humorists were num
bered among the regular con
tributors to Chappie. The year
before last, freshman writers
managed to hold their own in
competition with such well-known
funny men as Mike Ely, Dave
Lamson, Carl Shoup, Henry
Mack, and so on. But this year
the frosh seem as devoid of
ideas as Lagunita is of polly
wogs. May the Spring bring a lit
tle of each to both!"
