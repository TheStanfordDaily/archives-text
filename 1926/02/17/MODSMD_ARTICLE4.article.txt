## Visitors Chalk Up Thirteen Points in Second Half To Win, 19 to 18 
### 
By breaking through the defense of!
the Stanford 145-pound basketball!
team in the second half to ring up
thirteen points, the squad from the.
University of California Dental Col- j
lege nosed out the Cardinal middle- j
weights in the last few minutes of the
game and won by a 19 to 18 score.
The contest was played in the Pavilion ;
last night as a preliminary to the
Stanford Freshmen-Oakland Technical (
High School clash. It was the last |
practice meet that the Redshirted j
warriors will have before the second'
game of the California series, which j
will be played in Oakland next Satur-1
day night.
With Cook getting his eye on the
basket to drop three field goals in for
points in the first half, the Stanford
team led 11 to 6 at half time. Cook
was the outstanding for the Cardinal
offense and did some nice work on
the floor. The rest of the team were;
passing poorly, and guarding in a rag
ged manner. King, who replaced!
Blazier because of the shooting that
he has been showing in practice, failed
to deliver as he was expected to.
Ankele was doing some nioe work at
guard, and Captain Newcomb worked
the floor pretty well ,so that the half
showed Stanford in the lead.
Dentists Rally
Coming back with an added amount;
of pep at the start of the second half,'
however, the Dentists proceeded to
pierce the Stanford defense at will,!
and to make some difficult shots count'
for points. The lead seesawed back
and forth several times, with first one j
team assuming the front position and ;
then the other. It was anybody's game
up to the time that the gun went off. i
Farrar, of the Dental College, was
the high scorer of the game with a
total of seven points. Cook followed
him closely with six markers, and
George with five counters. Farrar es
tablished something of a record by
converting all of his three free throws. |
