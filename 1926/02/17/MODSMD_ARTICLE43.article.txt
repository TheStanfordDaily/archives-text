# RATS THRIVE ON ALCOHOL
## 
### 
Experiments to determine whether
alcohol affects the growth are being
carried out on rats at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore. It has been
discovered in the tests made to date
that the rats given an alcoholic diet
grow to as large a size as those who
are given a normal diet, but eat from
17 to 36 per cent less.
