## 
### 
Cecilia Hansen, noted young Rus
sian violinist, will play in the Assem
bly hall tomorrow night as one of the
artists presented on the annual seHes

of the Peninsula Music Association.
Miss Hansen has had a rapid and
brilliant rise to fame during the last
few years. In 1921 she made a dra
matic escape from Russia, afterwards
making her debut in Europe, and later
in America. She has maintained a
tradition in achieving notable recogni
tion for her teacher was the great
Professor Leopold Auer of the Petro
grad Conservatory, who has probably
trained more famous violin virtuosos
than any other man of the time.
Among Miss Hansen's classmates in
her grade In the conservatory were
Toscha Seidel and Jascha Heifetz,
both of whom are now at the top of
the ladder among men players.
Born in Russia
Miss Hansen was born in a Cossack
settlement in Russia. Her grandfather
was a Dane, which accounts for her
Norse name and Scandinavian type
of beauty.

Carnegie Hall and was an event of
the season. Her tours through the
country have brought her favorable
comment from critics in all sections.
Illustrative of Miss Hansen's effect
on a college audience is the follow
ing from "The Daily Princetonian"
following her concert at Princeton as
soloist with the New York Philhar
monic orchestra. The critic of the uni
versity paper wrote: "I do not imagine
that those who heard Cecilia Hansen
play Tchaikowsky's concerto last night
will forget her. She has everything
that Auer's pupils always have: full
ness of tone, perfect technique, and
that remarkable power which was all
the more remarkable coming from a
woman."
Program in Groups
The program tomorrow night con
tains four groups. "Ciaconna" by Vi
tali will head the list. Following a
series by various composers arranged
by Fritz Kreisler and then Tchai
kowsky's concerto in D major. The
