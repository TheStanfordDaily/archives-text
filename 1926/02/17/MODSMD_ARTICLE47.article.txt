# SCRIMMAGES START IN WINTER FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Winter football started yesterday
in earnest when over twenty-five men
reported for the first real workout, i
Regular practice began on February 1.
Because of heavy rains, very little I
actual advantage has been derived so
far from the session.
Instructions in the rudiments of the
game were supplemented yesterday |
b yscrimmage, which will be continued
during the rest of the practice period,
ending near the last of February. Pop
Warner is grooming his charges in
the departments of th egame that can
be mastered before the regular au- j
tumn workouts are begun in Septem- J
ber.
