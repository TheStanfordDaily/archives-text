# DEAN CULVER TALKS ON CAMPUS PROBLEMS TO FRESHMAN GROUP
## 
### 
"Freshman Problems" was the
theme of a talk by Dean Culver last
night before the freshman council at
the Y.M.C.A. in the regular weekly
meeting.
"One of the main troubles," the
Dean said, "is that the freshmen are
talked 'at' instead of 'with.' Much can
be accomplished by talking 'with' the
freshmen and getting in closer con
tact with them."
Dean Culver told several interesting
incidents relating to his work and the
"many problems that he is confronted
with. "Eighty-five per cent of the men
that enter my office," he said, "open
their conversation with the word
'why.' This is more a habit than any
thing else and can be corrected by
learning to be direct in speech and
manner.
"Another great difficulty the fresh
man encounters is the contrasting of
his life with others he considers more
fertunate. It is very discouraging to
see someone get good grades without
apparent effort, while he studies and
barely makes a showing. And again,
it is discouraging for a man working
his way through school to contrast his
life with those of the more financially
fortunate.
"The history of Stanford in ath
letics as well as other activities has
been that the best men develop. A
freshman should not worry because he
is not in activities. He has four years
in which to develop the best that is
i in him."

The question of choosing a fratern
ity, and a profession, were discussed
in the course of the talk.
