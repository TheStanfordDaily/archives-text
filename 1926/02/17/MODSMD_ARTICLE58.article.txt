# DR. BAILEY WILLIS CLAIMS MOUNTAINS ARE REALLY YOUNG

"Mountains are really young, and not
as old as the earth," Dr. Bailey Willis,
professor emeritus of geology, declared
in a lecture given last night under the
auspices of the Seismological Society of
America at the auditorium of the Pacific
Gas and Electric Company in San Fran
cisco.
The fact that the great mountain
ranges of the world are young and that
they are growing vigorously, was the
most striking point in Dr. Willis' lecture.
He illustrated this by pictures from the
Andes in South America, from the moun
tains of Europe, and from the greatest
of all mountain ranges, the Himalayas in
India. In connection with the last he
showed views of Mount Everest and de
scribed the superb effort of the British
mountain climbers, with a tribute to Mal
lory and Irvine, who probably reached
the summit at 29,000 feet, but who never
came back to tell of it.
Forces at Work
"The young mountains extend through
the East Indies, up through the-Philip
pines, and to the Japanese Islands, to
Alaska, and so around through the Cali
fornia ranges, girding the earth and en
circling the Pacific. Only across the At
lantic is there a gap. There the forces
that are uplifting the mountains seem to
be working so quietly, or at such a great
depth beneath the surface that the high
lands form broad domes in which the
valleys are carved by the streams. This
is in contrast to the conditions in Cali
fornia, for instance, where each moun
tain range is an independent unit moving
against the others, but somewhat inde
pendently.
Earthquakes Caused
"It is in these movements that the
blocks slide on each other, giving rise to

vibrations that we call earthquakes. For |
instance, at Santa Barbara the block that
forms the mesa southwest of the city
slipped upward toward the northeast be
cause of a pressure from under the Pa
cific ocean. It had been straining to
move for many years, and was like a
steel spring pressed forward, but not
released. When it slipped, starting at
the Santa Barbara channel, it slipped like
a spring let loose, and Santa Barbara
fell."
In closing. Dr. Willis said, "We ought
to be grateful to the earthquakes, or at
any rate to the earthquake force, for
without it there would be no California.
It is a constructive force and if we choose
we can work with it to build up our
communities in the valleys and mountains
that it has produced, instead of so build
ing that it will destroy us."
