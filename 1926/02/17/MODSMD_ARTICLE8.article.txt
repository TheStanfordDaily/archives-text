# Stanford Library Acquires Volumes At Unusual Rate
## 
### C. B. Norman 
One volume every forty-five ftin
utes, day and night, winter and sum
mer, is the rate at which new books
are added to the Stanford library.
What is the mechanism or the or
ganization by which this vast number
of books is selected from the many
times larger number that are pub
lished every hour? Who nominates
the books? How are they elected to
membership? These questions were
answered by George T. Clark, Univer
sity librarian, who explained that aside
from books, such as references, which
are needed by the workers in many
departments, and certain complete
sets which are ordered by the library
itself, the selection of books is in the
hands of the various departments.
Each department is allotted a certain
sum of money and it is practically free
to spend that money as it sees fit. Of
course, the department does not hold
any proprietary rights to the books
that it has ordered. Once acquired, the
books are for general use.
The amounts of money which the
different departments are allotted are
not the same. The expenditure of
about $15,000 a year is divided be
tween twenty-eight departments and
the library itself. The $15,000 is di
vided into about 160 units of a little
less than $100 each. The library re
tains thirty units. The number of units
assigned to a department depends
upon the number of students and the
sort of work that the department is
doing. For example, science depart
ments, which teach more by labora
tories and less by books, are given
fewer units than such a department
as history, whose work is almost
wholly in books and documents.
Task fs Difficult
Clark explained how the original
distribution between the departments
was made. It was not an easy task
for each department needed more than !
could be given to it. "There was no j
very scientific way to go about it. It
was simply a case for fairness and ■
good judgment," said Clark. "When,
the scientific libraries of San Fran-1
cisco, upon which the Stanford com- j
munity depended, were destroyed in
the fire, a complete reorganization and ;
enlargement of the Stanford library
I became necessary. It was at this time,
under the direction of Dr. Stillman,
professor of chemistry, and vice-presi
i dent of the University, who was also
| chairman of the library committee,
j that the original apportionment was
made. His judgment and fairminded- j
i ness were greatly respected."
! The Law library, and the Lane!
Medical library in San Francisco, are j
independent and have their own sepa-j
rate funds.
Faculty Selects Books
The selection of the books is really
| the work of the entire faculty, par
i ticularly the department heads. The
| members of each department know
| of the new books in their fields, so
| practically all the books are selected
j by expert judgment. r
"The departmental nominations of \
! books are always confirmed," said
Clark, "provided they do not exceed
their allotments. When the order for
a book is received we examine the j
catalogue to be sure that we do not |
! have it already and our orders to see
• that it has not been ordered. Then
j we look up the price. We have the
I catalogues of all the leading American j
and European publishers. Also we j
have records of the price of books:
j sold at. auction from which we can ;
| judge the prices of books that are out j
j of print. It occasionally happens that
a new book is first got out in a de
luxe edition and the department or
dering is unaware of the fact. We al-,
| ways report such cases back to the
department with the suggestion that,
if possible, they wait for the regular
trade edition."

Most of the Stanford library books
I are brought through a New York
agent. More than half of them come
j from abroad. Except in the cases of
j special haste, the books from New
York come by way of the Panama
! canal and cost about $1.50 a hundred
pounds freight as compared with $5
, by rail. A new shipment arrives about
I every two weeks.

"The departmental nominations of \

Clark, "provided they do not exceed
their allotments. When the order for
a book is received we examine the j
catalogue to be sure that we do not |
! have it already and our orders to see

j we look up the price. We have the
I catalogues of all the leading American j
and European publishers. Also we j
have records of the price of books:

j of print. It occasionally happens that

Most of the Stanford library books
I are brought through a New York
agent. More than half of them come
j from abroad. Except in the cases of
j special haste, the books from New
York come by way of the Panama
! canal and cost about $1.50 a hundred
pounds freight as compared with $5
, by rail. A new shipment arrives about
I every two weeks.
One volume every forty-five ftin
utes, day and night, winter and sum
mer, is the rate at which new books
are added to the Stanford library.
What is the mechanism or the or
ganization by which this vast number
of books is selected from the many
times larger number that are pub
lished every hour? Who nominates
the books? How are they elected to
membership? These questions were
answered by George T. Clark, Univer
sity librarian, who explained that aside
from books, such as references, which
are needed by the workers in many
departments, and certain complete
sets which are ordered by the library
itself, the selection of books is in the
hands of the various departments.
Each department is allotted a certain
sum of money and it is practically free
to spend that money as it sees fit. Of
course, the department does not hold
any proprietary rights to the books
that it has ordered. Once acquired, the
books are for general use.
The amounts of money which the
different departments are allotted are
not the same. The expenditure of
about $15,000 a year is divided be
tween twenty-eight departments and
the library itself. The $15,000 is di
vided into about 160 units of a little
less than $100 each. The library re
tains thirty units. The number of units
assigned to a department depends
upon the number of students and the
sort of work that the department is
doing. For example, science depart
ments, which teach more by labora
tories and less by books, are given
fewer units than such a department
as history, whose work is almost
wholly in books and documents.
Task fs Difficult
Clark explained how the original
distribution between the departments
was made. It was not an easy task
for each department needed more than !
could be given to it. "There was no j
very scientific way to go about it. It
was simply a case for fairness and ■
good judgment," said Clark. "When,
the scientific libraries of San Fran-1
cisco, upon which the Stanford com- j
munity depended, were destroyed in
the fire, a complete reorganization and ;
enlargement of the Stanford library
I became necessary. It was at this time,
under the direction of Dr. Stillman,
professor of chemistry, and vice-presi
i dent of the University, who was also
| chairman of the library committee,
j that the original apportionment was
made. His judgment and fairminded- j
i ness were greatly respected."
