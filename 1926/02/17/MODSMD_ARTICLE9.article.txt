# AMERICA LEADS IN AIRCRAFT FORCES, DURAND ASSERTS
## Professor Opposes Idea of Separate Department Of Aviation 
### 
America leads the world in aircraft
design and equipment, stated Profes
sor W. F. Durand of the department
of mechanical engineering, in a talk
given to the Palo Alto Rotary Club
recently. Professor Durand, who was
a member of the president's aircraft
board during the recent investigations,
outlined in his lecture what America
has in the way of forces in the air,
and what she ought to have, as de
cided by the board.
Air Force Auxiliary
Professor Durand was opposed to
the policy of the United States having
a separate air force. .In case of war,
he said, it would be necessary for the
enemy to ship their planes to some
suitable base of operations which
would have to be established within
striking distance of the country. The
most that an air force could do would
be to strike the first blow, and then
retire to the service as supplementary
units to the main departments of war
and the navy.
Equipment Good
In showing that the United States
was not under-supplied in aircraft, as
is the common belief, he stated that
the air equipment of the United States
contained about 2400 machines, of
which number approximately 1400
were under army control, and the re
mainder under navy heads. Ships num
bering 439 were at present under con
struction for the army, he stated fur
ther. Of these planes, 90 are bombers,
249 observation planes, 26 pursuit
planes, and 31 primary training planes.
In addition, there are seven recondi
tioned wartime bombers, 133 pursuit
planes, and 340 observation planes,
making a grand total of 1396 ma
chines. Actual fighting planes in the
army on June 30, 1925, numbered 1025,
while those in the navy totaled 394.
Ships Carry Planes
He stated that the fleet was well
equipped as regards the number of
ships carrying planes.' The catapault,
a strictly American invention, gives
each battleship the ability to carry
three planes and to launch them safe
ly. In comparing the United States
with other countries, the following
figures were given for the number of
fighting planes possessed by the coun
tries: United States, 1423; Great
Britain, 1053 (one-half of these new);
France, 4000 (2500 serviceable); Italy,
1000; Japan, 800-900.
