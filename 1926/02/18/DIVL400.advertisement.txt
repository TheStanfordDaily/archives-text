The OLD "PEP"
That radiant, glowing feeling of Spring. That
feeling of being decidedly interested in Life and
just "rarin' to go."
There's nothing in the world like it and nothing
that can help a fellow "grow" that feeling like
Zestful, Two-Fisted, Broad-Toed Oxfords. Styled
to the limit, yet not freakish and packed to the
limit with Genuine Value.
We illustrate as an example our No. 81689. It's
decidedly Thompson and priced at $12.
