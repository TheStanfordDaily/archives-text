YESTERDAY'S RESULTS
Kappa Sigma 14, Delta Tau Delta 13.
El Tigre 10, Breakers 8.
Kappa Sigma won the right to com
pete for the University intramural
basketball championship by defeating
Delta Tau Delta in a fast semi-final
contest yesterday afternoon in Encina
gymnasium. El Tigre took the other
semi-final in a last half rally by defeat
ing the highly touted Breakers quin
tet, 10 to 8.
Morrison, Delta Tau forward, start
ed the scoring by making a set-up
shot under the goal after both teams
had taken numerous chances without
success. The Kappa Sigs worked the
ball down the court by means of
clever passwork, but seemed unable
to find the basket in the first part of
the game. Middleton finally connected
for Kappa Sigma by tossing in a field
goal from the sidelines. Hoxie followed
with a pretty shot from the middle of
the floor.
Delts Have Difficulty
The Delta Tau team had difficulty
getting near their goal, and for the
rest of the first half was unable to
make another point. Stevens added
two more points to the Kappa Sig
score by making a one-armed shot
from the sidelines as the period ended.
The score at half-time favored the
winners 6 to 2.
Delta Tau Delta came back in the
second half with a decidedly improved
offensive, and started in by ringing up
two points on a long shot by Meyers.
Stevens counted for Kappa Sigma with
a free throw, and was followed by a
field goal by Southworth under the
basket.
Middleton gave the Kappa Sigs an
11 to 4 lead when he made a shot
under the basket following fast of
fensive play. He added another point
a minute later on a free throw. At this
point Delta Tau's team started a final
offensive drive that nearly won the
game in the last minutes of play.
Wise followed in a long shot and
made good his second try by shooting
a pretty basket from the foul line.
Morrison sank another long shot from
center, which was soon followed by
a similar basket by Meyer. King
raised Delta Tau's score to 11 with a
free throw. Southworth dribbled the
ball under the basket and made a
clever one-armed shot, giving the
Kappa Sigmas a 14 to 11 lead. With
only a minute left to play. King got
loose around the Kappa Sig defense,
and made a short basket under the
goal. The game ended with Delta Tau
Delta again in an offensive drive that
almost resulted in victory.
King, Delta Tau center, played a
fast game for the losers. His work
was the main cog in the Delts' offense,
and his defensive playing was out
standing. Middleton played his usual
good game for the winners, as did
Southworth and Stevens. Hoxie was
the most brilliant performer for the
Kappa Sigma team, and his playing
was mainly responsible for the ma
jority of the winner's points.
Meyers displayed a, dead-eye for the
basket from the center of the floor,
and only hard luck prevented him
from sinking a number of long tries.
Morrison, Meyers, and Southworth
tied for high-point honors with four
points each.
Tigre Gets Early Lead
El Tigre and Breakers staged a
hard-fought exhibition that was in
doubt until the gun ended the game.
Both teams relied mainly on their of
fensive power and fell back on the old
saying that a good offense is the best
defense. The game was fast, and was
marked by clever dribbling and pass
ing.
Brown gave El Tigre an early lead
when he connected for a long shot
from the sidelines. Henderson made it
3 to 0 with a free throw. Compton
scored the Breakers' first point with a
free throw, and the game went along
at 3 to 1 for over five minutes. Finally
Cook found the range and scored a
fairly long shot from the middle.
Cook's shot was followed closely by a
basket by Busch. The half ended with
the Breakers on the long end of a 5
to 3 score.
Sandborn Gets Winning Goal
Carlsmith opened the second period
by converting a free throw for Break
ers. Woodhead dribbled around the
Breakers' standing guard and made
an easy shot under the basket. He was
fouled in the act of shooting, and
made good oive of the two shots given
him. With the score tied at 6-all,
Brown sank a long shot from the side
lines, giving El Tigre an 8 to 6 advan
tage. Cook made a long shot from
center, tying the score with two min
utes left to play.
Both teams fought furiously for the
ball as the end of the game drew near.
Sandborn pivoted around a Breaker
player and took a difficult shot on the
run. The ball hovered on the rim for
an instant and then rolled in, giving
El Tigre a two-point lead. Neither
team was able to get within scoring
distance in the last minute of play,
and the game ended with the ball in
! the middle of the floor.
Woodhead and Brown were the out
standing players for the El Tigre
team, and their clever offensive work
was the feature of the game. Cook
played a fast game for the Breakers,
and he and Carlsmith were the whole
show for the losers. Henderson and
Stockbridge did some effective de
fensive work for the winners.
