# STANFORD CAGERS END PRACTICE FOR GAME WITH DEARS
## California Has Big Edge on Basis of Consistently Good Playing 
### Jim Adams 
Rest is being prescribed by Coach
Andy Kerr to his basketball players
as the best treatment to get them in
first class condition for their second
game with California Saturday night
in the Oakland Auditorium. The var
sity stayed away from the courts to
day and will not go on them again
until the game. Staleness is causing
worry to both Coach Kerr and Nibs
Price, who has given his men a vaca
tion this week.
Condition will be a big factor in
the result of the contest. When the
Cards met the Blue and Gold five in
the first tilt, they were in good shape
and gave the latter team the closest
game they have had this season.
Three or four times this season the
Redshirts have risen to great heights
and have shown some first-class bas
ketball although their game has shift
ed to the other extreme on different
occasions.
Compared to the erratic playing of
the Stanford team is the steady stand
ard of good basketball that the Cali
fornia quintet has maintained. If
Kerr's men can display the same
brand they did against U.S.C. and
Southern Branch, and against the
Bears in the first game, the latter
team may get some unexpected oppo
sition Saturday night. The Cards have
it in them, but it is always a question
when they will show their best form.
There is always one thing that
brings out the best in either a Cali
fornia or Stanford team and that is
when the two come together in com
bat. In the first match the Redshirts
showed unexpected strength and lost
the game only through fate. If Kerr
can get his men working together
there are lots of things that might
happen, even the most unexpected, a
Stanford victory. There is always that
element of chance in it, even if Cali
fornia is given a big edge on basis of
past consistent performance.
