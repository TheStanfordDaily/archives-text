# 1928 WOMEN DEFEAT FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM
## 
### 
Leading throughout tlve game, the
sophomore women defeated the fresh
men 33 to 18 in the last basketball
game of the practice series yesterday
afternoon. Poor guarding by the fresh
men gave the sophomores many op
portunities to score.
Contrary to practice game custom,
changes in the lineup did not give all
members of either squad a chance to
play. The sophomores used first-string
material most of the time, sending in
reserves for only a few minutes in the
fourth quarter. During those minutes
the freshmen began to score rapidly,
and Miss Burk, sophomore coach, sent
her first-team players back in to finish
the gnme. Changes in the freshman
lineup were more frequent.
