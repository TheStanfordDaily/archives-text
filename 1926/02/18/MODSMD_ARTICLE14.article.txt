# EDUCATION LIABILITY IN INDUSTRIAL WORK DECLARES HAPGOOD
## 
### 
"Education —a college education —is
a liability rather than an asset as far
as the industrial world is concerned;
; it remains a liability until the college.
| student learns to use it in helping
solve the problem of readjusting in
dustry in the interest of human val
ues" said W. P. Hapgood, president of
the Columbia Conserve Company of
I Indianapolis, who spoke at a dinner
i forum given last night jointly by the
| Y.RI.C.A. and Y.W.C.A.
Hapgood outlined the working or
ganization of his own co-operatively
j owned cannery, and told of its sue
] cess since its start in 1917. He finished
; his talk with a plea to college students
interested in such things to get into
the field of active work in co-operative
industry.
j In speaking of his own co-operative
| canning company, of which he was
i the originator, he said: "We have
| eight planks in our platform: full-time
I employment takes precedent over
j profits; protective insurance is pro-,
| vided against sickness, accident, and
j old age; a minimum wage of $18
! (which was set by the workers them
| selves); a maximum wage of $100
! (which was set by the workers); a
i profit-sharing plan in which a dividend
! of ten per cent is paid on salaries as
on capital stock; the abolition of ab
i sentee control; control by the workers,
who meet as a council to determine
all the policies, managerial and flnan
i cial, of the company; and finally, ulti
mate workers' ownership. This is pro
! vided for in a trust fund which is
i taken out of the profits."
