# YEARLINGS TO FACE STRONG BEAR CUBS IN SECOND GAME
## Freshmen Will Have Even Chance with Powerful Berkeley Squad 
### Cliff McDowell 
Tomorrow night the Stanford fresh
man basketball team will travel to
Berkeley to meet the California babes
in the second game of the annual bas
ketball series. The first game, played
three weeks ago in the pavilion, was
won by California 26 to 14. Hard prac
tice and a complete rebuilding of the
team since then have boosted the
stock of the Cardinal frosh to a point
where they are given an almost even
chance to win.
Defensively, the Stanford squad was
outclassed in the first game. The Cali
fornia forwards were given plenty of
close shots that should have been
blocked. Hunt has a new man at stand
ing guard, Robb, who is one of the
best defensive players on the team.
Robb has been in every game of the
last practice series and has been re
sponsible for the strong defense put
up by the frosh in these last few
games. He is light, however, and may
not be able to stand the pace when
he meets the Dougery, Corbin, Eisan
combination, all fast heavy men. Lewis
has been playing the running guard
position with Robb and will probably
start against the Blue and Gold cubs.
McCandless, who has starred at cen
ter all through the season, will be
counted on to do most of the scoring
for Stanford. He has usually taken
high-point honors in the practice
games and is the best shot on the
squad. The forward positions have
given Hunt plenty of trouble; no one
seems to play consistent basketball.
Almost every man on the squad has
been given a chance at forward, but
Sexson and Renzel have shown the
best form and will probably start the
game.
Coach Clint Evans of the California
frosh has been using the same five
in practice games that he used against
Stanford three weeks ago, and will
probably start the same combination
tomorrow night.
