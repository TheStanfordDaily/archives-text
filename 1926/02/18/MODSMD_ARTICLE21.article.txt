# CARDINAL VARSITY NINE WINS FROM BRONCS IN FIRST GAME
## Sobieski Fans Two Men to Stop Missionite Rally In Ninth Inning 
### Herb Klein 
Despite a ninth-inning rally by the
Drones and wild pitching on the part
of Card pitchers, Harry Wolter's var
sity baseball team won its first game
of the season by defeating Sam Ag
new's Santa Clara nine 8 to 6 at Santa
Clara yesterday. With the bases load
ed and only one man out in the ninth,
Count Sobieski, the last of a series
of pitchers, fanned two men in suc
cession and saved the day.
Sobieski Checks Rally
Santa Clara came to bat in the last
inning on the small end of an 8 to 4
score. Collins, who had been pitching
since the sixth inning, struck out
Morey, the first Bronc player at bat,
and then blew up. He walked the next
man and allowed Scherf a clean
single. Randall, of the Broncs, landed
squarely on the ball for a two-bagger,
bringing in a run. Collins was unable
to get the ball over the plate and
walked the next batter. He was re
placed by Philippi, who fared no bet
ter, for he handed a walk to Lennen.
After Philippi tossed a few more balls
to Smith, Sobieski stepped in. Sobieski
allowed Smith a single, which gave
Santa Clara its sixth score, and then
tightened up to pitch real ball.
The team played good ball in the
main, considering the small amount
of practice they have been able to
snatch in the dry spells. The weakness
lay chiefly in erratic pitching, but
practice should remedy this.
Cards Score in Third
Batteries were Oviatt and Sypher
for the Cards, Compesi and Martinelli
for Santa Clara. Oviatt seemed unable
to hit his stride except at intervals.
For several innings he tried to use
an underhand curve which generally
failed in the pinches. The Bronc
pitcher was fairly easy to hit and
did not have much change of pace.
He finally was taken out in the mid
dle of the ninth after the Cards had
slammed him for three runs. Gott
walls, who pitched the rest of the
inning, hardly had a chance to show
his worth.
The game started slowly, Santa
Clara's lone run in the first inning
being the only score until the Cards
cut loose in the third. After starting
with poor control, Oviatt improved his
mound work in the second inning and
struck out two men. In the third Stan
ford made three tallies. Oviatt, who
made four hits in four times up, start
ed the rally with a two-base hit, but
missed first on the way and had to
come back to it. The Broncs crossed
the plate twice in the last of the
inning.
Scoring was at a standstill till the
last of the game when Stanford piled
up the rest of their eight points and
apparently had the game sewed up.
The Card pitchers thereupon suddenly
seemed unable to get anything over
the plate until Sobieski saved the day
and stopped the Broncs with two spec
tacular strike-outs.
The line-up was as follows: John
son, first; Garibaldi, second; Cudde
back, third; Busch, short; Stewart,
Weaver, and Nissen, outfield. Substi
tutions for Stanford: Collins for
Oviatt, Thilippi for Collins, Sobieski
for Philippi.

missed first on the way and had to
come back to it. The Broncs crossed
the plate twice in the last of the
inning.
Scoring was at a standstill till the
last of the game when Stanford piled
up the rest of their eight points and
apparently had the game sewed up.
The Card pitchers thereupon suddenly
seemed unable to get anything over
the plate until Sobieski saved the day
and stopped the Broncs with two spec
tacular strike-outs.
The line-up was as follows: John
son, first; Garibaldi, second; Cudde
back, third; Busch, short; Stewart,
Weaver, and Nissen, outfield. Substi
tutions for Stanford: Collins for
Oviatt, Thilippi for Collins, Sobieski
for Philippi.
Despite a ninth-inning rally by the
Drones and wild pitching on the part
of Card pitchers, Harry Wolter's var
sity baseball team won its first game
of the season by defeating Sam Ag
new's Santa Clara nine 8 to 6 at Santa
Clara yesterday. With the bases load
ed and only one man out in the ninth,
Count Sobieski, the last of a series
of pitchers, fanned two men in suc
cession and saved the day.
Sobieski Checks Rally
Santa Clara came to bat in the last
inning on the small end of an 8 to 4
score. Collins, who had been pitching
since the sixth inning, struck out
Morey, the first Bronc player at bat,
and then blew up. He walked the next
man and allowed Scherf a clean
single. Randall, of the Broncs, landed
squarely on the ball for a two-bagger,
bringing in a run. Collins was unable
to get the ball over the plate and
walked the next batter. He was re
placed by Philippi, who fared no bet
ter, for he handed a walk to Lennen.
After Philippi tossed a few more balls
to Smith, Sobieski stepped in. Sobieski
allowed Smith a single, which gave
Santa Clara its sixth score, and then
tightened up to pitch real ball.
The team played good ball in the
main, considering the small amount
of practice they have been able to
snatch in the dry spells. The weakness
lay chiefly in erratic pitching, but
practice should remedy this.
Cards Score in Third
Batteries were Oviatt and Sypher
for the Cards, Compesi and Martinelli
for Santa Clara. Oviatt seemed unable
to hit his stride except at intervals.
For several innings he tried to use
an underhand curve which generally
failed in the pinches. The Bronc
pitcher was fairly easy to hit and
did not have much change of pace.
He finally was taken out in the mid
dle of the ninth after the Cards had
slammed him for three runs. Gott
walls, who pitched the rest of the
inning, hardly had a chance to show
his worth.
The game started slowly, Santa
Clara's lone run in the first inning
being the only score until the Cards
cut loose in the third. After starting
with poor control, Oviatt improved his
mound work in the second inning and
struck out two men. In the third Stan
ford made three tallies. Oviatt, who
made four hits in four times up, start
ed the rally with a two-base hit, but
missed first on the way and had to
come back to it. The Broncs crossed
the plate twice in the last of the
inning.
