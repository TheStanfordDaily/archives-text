In the past few months several Stanford professors have been laid open
to ridicule because of the practically irresistible impulse of newspaper men
to convert scientific observations into good yarns. In some instances the
Daily Palo Alto has been the offender; in others the campus correspond
ents have been at fault; and in still others the facts have been distoited
after they have been sent off the campus.
An unpleasant incident which occurred last quarter put both the Daily
and the correspondents on the guard. At this time I)r. Bailey \V illis made
certain statements regarding the earthquake situation, and in the writing
of the story the facts were misconstrued. The erroneous story spread over
the nation, and caused Dr. Willis no little embarrassment. Here the fault
rested entirely on the local journalists.
Recently a psychologist disclosed some investigations which he has been
making for the past twelve years. A true-to-fact story which was sent off
the campus was edited poorly, and in a few hours the work which had re
quired years of Professor Coover's time to complete was reduced to a bit
ot sensationalism.
The Daily realizes that it cannot receive the backing of the faculty or
the permission to use their experiments in news stories if the reporters
handle the facts carelessly; therefore, it has introduced a double check
system on stories of this type. It would be wise for the correspondents to
adopt a similar policy, for then whatever blunders occur would be no fault
of the campus scribes.
Defeat of mother nature and triumph of W.C.T.U. noted in the Daily
Illini:
"It is probably against public law as well as the dictates of good morals and
common decency to display the feminine figure with too much accuracy in advertise
ments of moving picture shows."
Revival of antipathy between the North and the South, as discovered in
editorial in Oklahoma Daily:
"Several hundred champion Charleston dancers met in Chicago the other night.
The mayor of Charleston, S.C., was on hand to award a cup for first prize. What
was the disappointment of Mayor Stoney, however, and probably the entire south,
when Miss Louise Sullivan, 20, of Grand Rapids, Mich., and her brother won the
tournament?"
The march of the wooden soldiers as seen by the Normal Advance of
Terre Haute:
"You are for uniforms for tlx; band, are you not? We are. We think the boys
would look fine marching down Wabash Avenue in uniforms with banners flying and
with a big, handsome drum major stepping out in front."
