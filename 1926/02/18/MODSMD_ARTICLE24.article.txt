# CAMPUS OPINION
## CLAIMS AMERICAN EDUCATION ENCOURAGES CRYSTAL GAZING; EXAMINATIONS ARE DEPLORED 
### 
.
The Editor, Sir:
Someone, or no one, has said that ;
there are two fundamental urges in
life —love, and the hunt-and-peck sys
tem. After resisting these successfully
during four years at Stanford I can't
refrain from yielding slightly to the
second.
Campus Opinion is not supposed to
be a "Cry on Geraldine's Shoulder":
column, hut I hope you will pardon
me if I let loose some saltine driplets; j
lor I have a terrible trouble to tell
you. In brief, it is this: I don't know:
anything! They used to prophecy!
great mental achievements for me 1
when I was a child. At the age of two
I could pronounce the word "soup"
quite distinctly, at three I could spell
"cat," and at five I could call thei
neighbor's boy a "liar." But. since I
came to Stanford my mind hasn't de-j
veloped, and I challenge any of my!
fellow students to prove that they are !
any better off than T am. We are all
mentally defunct and intellectually in
solvent. as green as grass, and as full
of fromage as a brindle pup.
I think I know where the root of;
our trouble lies. Friends and Romans,
our mortal jinx is the examination
system! In such countries as England
and Germany, students go to the uni-|
versity to be educated. But in America
they go to be examined! Blue books
are a mighty poor substitute after all
for the azure blue of the heavens
above towards which the European j

student's eyes are directed. There!
Haven't I proven my point conclu
sively?
Whether we learn anything or not,
our main ambition is to get by the
prescribed examinations and convince
the little girl at home who sends the
perfumed envelopes, and the man to
whom we apply for a job, that we
didn't get kicked out in four years at
college. To accomplish this we study
for our examinations, and not for our
own mental well-being. We say, "I'd
better read up on 'stock dividends';
—I'll have to know that when I get
into business."
We engage ourselves in mind read
ing, instead of mind training. We are
all crystal gazers, and trying to figure
out the examination questions in ad
vance. Rather than trying to learn, we
are all trying to get by! Is there any
one among my vast throng of readers
who disputes me? Answer —nobody!
The psychological effect of the ex
amination system produced on the stu
rtrnt is that he quickly forgets every
thing after the ex. That is only natur
al, and he can't help it. Thus the stu
dent, systematically, and in an insidi
ous manner, is trained to forget to the
same degree that he learns, with the
result that in the end he knows noth
ing, or even less.
Higher education should mean edu
cation, and not bigger and better blue
books!
Sincerely yours, P.H.W.,'26.

above towards which the European j

student's eyes are directed. There!
Haven't I proven my point conclu
sively?
Whether we learn anything or not,
our main ambition is to get by the
prescribed examinations and convince
the little girl at home who sends the
perfumed envelopes, and the man to
whom we apply for a job, that we
didn't get kicked out in four years at
college. To accomplish this we study
for our examinations, and not for our
own mental well-being. We say, "I'd
better read up on 'stock dividends';
—I'll have to know that when I get
into business."
We engage ourselves in mind read
ing, instead of mind training. We are
all crystal gazers, and trying to figure
out the examination questions in ad
vance. Rather than trying to learn, we
are all trying to get by! Is there any
one among my vast throng of readers
who disputes me? Answer —nobody!
The psychological effect of the ex
amination system produced on the stu
rtrnt is that he quickly forgets every
thing after the ex. That is only natur
al, and he can't help it. Thus the stu
dent, systematically, and in an insidi
ous manner, is trained to forget to the
same degree that he learns, with the
result that in the end he knows noth
ing, or even less.
Higher education should mean edu
cation, and not bigger and better blue
books!
Sincerely yours, P.H.W.,'26.

The Editor, Sir:
Someone, or no one, has said that ;
there are two fundamental urges in
life —love, and the hunt-and-peck sys
tem. After resisting these successfully
during four years at Stanford I can't
refrain from yielding slightly to the
second.
Campus Opinion is not supposed to
be a "Cry on Geraldine's Shoulder":
column, hut I hope you will pardon
me if I let loose some saltine driplets; j
lor I have a terrible trouble to tell
you. In brief, it is this: I don't know:
anything! They used to prophecy!
great mental achievements for me 1
when I was a child. At the age of two
I could pronounce the word "soup"
quite distinctly, at three I could spell
"cat," and at five I could call thei
neighbor's boy a "liar." But. since I
came to Stanford my mind hasn't de-j
veloped, and I challenge any of my!
fellow students to prove that they are !
any better off than T am. We are all
mentally defunct and intellectually in
solvent. as green as grass, and as full
of fromage as a brindle pup.
I think I know where the root of;
our trouble lies. Friends and Romans,
our mortal jinx is the examination
system! In such countries as England
and Germany, students go to the uni-|
versity to be educated. But in America
they go to be examined! Blue books
are a mighty poor substitute after all
for the azure blue of the heavens
above towards which the European j

student's eyes are directed. There!
