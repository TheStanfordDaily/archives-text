# SPORTS OF 1926
## Big League Managers 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
I The Boss of the Cincinnati Reds is up for discussion
today. Jack Hendricks, "Lucky Jack," the man who was
a failure as a player, went to college and graduated in law,
and then went back into baseball and has long since grown
gray in the service.
John C. Hendricks has had a career of ups and downs.
His record as a major league player shows two years of
service, but a total of only forty-one games played in.
Strangely, he played one season in the National League,
and the other in the rival circuit. He was with the Cubs
and the Giants the first year, but I doubt if either team
knew it, as he played in only nine games. Then he played
for Washington in 1903, batting his weight, or less, in
thirty-two games.
As a minor league manager, he was as great a success
as he was a failure as a major league player. But he

essayed to manage the Cardinals in 1918 and the team finished nowhere, and
Jaok went back to the minors. Now came his biggest "up," right after his
disappointment. In Indianapolis where Hendricks was Boss, his teams
were consistently near the top. and when Garry Hermann looked around for
a liassistant to Manager Pat Moran, he chose the successful John C.
Hendricks. Then the beloved Pat died soon afterwards, so Hendricks fell
heir to the Reds.
Taking stock of his team, he found quite a galaxy of stars, including a
whole army of pitchers. But injuries played havoc with Cincinnati in 1924,
and they finished fourth. Last year the Reds' boss, who knows as much
baseball as any man in the game, handled his three star pitchers so skillfully
that the Reds finished right behind the Giants. Many think that 192G will
see the National League gonfalon flying at Garry Hermann's ball park in the
land of the pretzel and the sauerkraut.
