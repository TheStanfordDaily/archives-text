RAH! RAH! RAH! CLASS AVERAGE
I'll sing a little ditty to
The man who drags the average down;
The blessed, splendid, real good egg—
The man who drags the average down.
Let he who will be filled with brains,
The sombre Phi Bete is a clown —
Here's heartfelt thanks —they're due
to one;
The man who drags the average down.
He's carefree, pleasant, never works,
And never wears a dismal frown,
His name is legion, he's the one
Who drags the class's average down.
A marble shaft we'll raiae to him,
He'll have the keys of every town
Oh, glory will be waiting there
For him who drags the average down.
Another one may bone all night
And stay up late in study brown;
He drags the average up, but cheer
For him who drags the average down.

Why are you so easily persuaded to
ride with me?
She—Oh, I have a grudge against

tions of any kind the following genu
ine inquiry clipped from the etiquette
columns of a San Francisco news
paper:
I am a jeune fille of sixteen years,
come very recently from France to
live with my aunts. Being "old maids"
they cannot answer for me the ques
tions I shall ask you, for they are
antagonistic to all men.
Is it here the custom for boys to
kiss girls upon the lips? I do not like
this, but if I allow it not the boys
become, as you say, "peeved." I do not
understand this custom which appears
so unrefined and disrespectful. The
other question is about my wearing of
a boy's pin of his club or his ring or
his wearing my ring. Has this any
: meaning besides the fact that we have
I each other's friendship? Tommy asked
j me to wear his pin one week. After
! two weeks he still had it and he did
not say anything. I gave it back and
since that day he has been angry with
me. Was my act a breach of etiquette?
Thanking you a thousand times. —A.F.
Dear A.F. —You are right. It is un
refined and disrespectful for boys to
kiss girls as so many do, and it is not
considered correct. Aside from eti
quette, mere human nature teaches
that the girl who gives kisses too
lightly is taken lightly. Yet I cannot
deny that kissing is a playtime sport
with the modern flapper. But you find
this customary only among very young
or less admirable men. Whether you
| allow this privilege or not depends
upon the type of girl you wish to be
i considered and the type of man you
j wish to consider.
| About the pin, there is no real

meaning aside from that which indi
viduals attribute to the wearing of
pins or rings in their individual cases.
It is quite all rieht to accept a pin or
ring for friendship's sake and the
clever girl will always take that mean
ing unless the man actually declares
himself and his intentions otherwise
in spoken words.

RAH! RAH! RAH! CLASS AVERAGE
I'll sing a little ditty to
The man who drags the average down;
The blessed, splendid, real good egg—
The man who drags the average down.
Let he who will be filled with brains,
The sombre Phi Bete is a clown —
Here's heartfelt thanks —they're due
to one;
The man who drags the average down.
He's carefree, pleasant, never works,
And never wears a dismal frown,
His name is legion, he's the one
Who drags the class's average down.
A marble shaft we'll raiae to him,
He'll have the keys of every town
Oh, glory will be waiting there
For him who drags the average down.
Another one may bone all night
And stay up late in study brown;
He drags the average up, but cheer
For him who drags the average down.

ine inquiry clipped from the etiquette
columns of a San Francisco news
paper:
I am a jeune fille of sixteen years,
come very recently from France to
live with my aunts. Being "old maids"
they cannot answer for me the ques
tions I shall ask you, for they are
antagonistic to all men.
Is it here the custom for boys to
kiss girls upon the lips? I do not like
this, but if I allow it not the boys
become, as you say, "peeved." I do not
understand this custom which appears
so unrefined and disrespectful. The
other question is about my wearing of
a boy's pin of his club or his ring or
his wearing my ring. Has this any
: meaning besides the fact that we have
I each other's friendship? Tommy asked
j me to wear his pin one week. After
! two weeks he still had it and he did
not say anything. I gave it back and
since that day he has been angry with
me. Was my act a breach of etiquette?
Thanking you a thousand times. —A.F.
