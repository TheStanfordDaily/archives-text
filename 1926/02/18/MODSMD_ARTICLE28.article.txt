# Moving Pictures Made of Texas Daily Staff at Work
## 
### 
Meml>ers of the Texas staff, the daily
paper of the University of Texas, became
future motion picture stars when moving
pictures of them were taken recently.
The showing of the pictures will be a
feature of the Texan banquet to be at the
last of the present term.
Shots were taken of the editorial staff,
the business staff, and the mechanical
staff. Pictures were made of the editor
in-chief and the managing editor. Scenes
will show the entire process of getting
out an edition of the papers from, the
time the reporter gets his assignment
until the big presses turn out the paper.
