### 
The petroleum research department |
of Stanford University under Profes-
I sor F. G. Tickell's supervision, has in
-1 stituted an investigation of the proper
ties of perforated pipe, which is used
in oil wells. Very little is known as
1 to the efficiency of the various kinds
of so-called screen pipe. The investi
gation is expected to discover more
complete data on the subject.
