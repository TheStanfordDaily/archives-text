# FRESHMEN, VARSITY WATER POLO TEAMS WILL MEET BEARS
## Squads Undergoing Intensive Workouts for Contests Saturday 
### 
Stanford varsity and freshman water
polo teams will clash with the Cali
fornia sevens in Encina pool Saturday
afternoon at 1 o'clock. Both squads
have been undergoing intensive daily
workouts during the past week and
tonight will be their final practice
game.
Prospects for the double victory
over the Bears, which has become al
most traditional under Brandsten's
coaching, appear excellent. The regu
lars are in many respects superior to
last year's team, and the first-year
men have developed into an outfit
which promises to furnish good ma
terial for future years.
In its workouts the varsity has been
playing half-hour and longer periods
against ineligibles and second-string
men. The latter have battled the regu
lars to close scores and on one occa
sion defeated them.
Allen at Center
Arden Allen will head the team as
captain. He plays in the center back
position. Allen and Bob Williams, an
other guard, make one of the fastest
backfields that has ever played for
Stanford. Both are among the speed
iest sprinters on the squad. Brandsten
has developed a style of play in which
the backs, on getting the ball, splash
all the way down the tank for a shot
at the opposing net.
Ken Graham, tfce third back, is not
quite so speedy, bi\t is dependable at
getting the ball up to the Card for
wards. The backfieid is superior to
that of last year's team in experience
and power.
Stewart Good Shot
Art Stewart, a veteran of the last
year team, is playing in one forward
position. Kryne Van den Akker will
be in action at sprint. Phil Brooks
and Johnny Mack will alternate at
the third forward berth.
Stewart has some good shots but is
a little slow in getting them off and
in getting around the tank. He is a
hard man to guard, however, and
ought to score several times. Van
den Akker is active in the water and
always on the jump so that he can
swim an ordinary guard almost ragged
in the course of a game. Brooks is fast
at. dribbling the ball but has an an
noying habit of taking it under water,
■which is a foul. He and Johnny Mack
are about on a par, though Mack ap
pears to fit in with the rest of the
team a little better.
Wardle Poulsen has a real job in
filling the place of Skin Collett, last
year's goal guard. Poulsen has devel
oped in the past few weeks and seems
to have almost as much ability to
anticipate the shot and even more
steadiness than Collett. Hinkle may
get in the goal frame at the second
half, if the Cards have piled up a lead
by that time.

backfields that has ever played for
Stanford. Both are among the speed
iest sprinters on the squad. Brandsten
has developed a style of play in which
the backs, on getting the ball, splash
all the way down the tank for a shot
at the opposing net.
Ken Graham, tfce third back, is not
quite so speedy, bi\t is dependable at
getting the ball up to the Card for
wards. The backfieid is superior to
that of last year's team in experience
and power.
Stewart Good Shot
Art Stewart, a veteran of the last
year team, is playing in one forward
position. Kryne Van den Akker will
be in action at sprint. Phil Brooks
and Johnny Mack will alternate at
the third forward berth.
Stewart has some good shots but is
a little slow in getting them off and
in getting around the tank. He is a
hard man to guard, however, and
ought to score several times. Van
den Akker is active in the water and
always on the jump so that he can
swim an ordinary guard almost ragged
in the course of a game. Brooks is fast
at. dribbling the ball but has an an
noying habit of taking it under water,
■which is a foul. He and Johnny Mack
are about on a par, though Mack ap
pears to fit in with the rest of the
team a little better.
Wardle Poulsen has a real job in
filling the place of Skin Collett, last
year's goal guard. Poulsen has devel
oped in the past few weeks and seems
to have almost as much ability to
anticipate the shot and even more
steadiness than Collett. Hinkle may
get in the goal frame at the second
half, if the Cards have piled up a lead
by that time.

Stanford varsity and freshman water
polo teams will clash with the Cali
fornia sevens in Encina pool Saturday
afternoon at 1 o'clock. Both squads
have been undergoing intensive daily
workouts during the past week and
tonight will be their final practice
game.
Prospects for the double victory
over the Bears, which has become al
most traditional under Brandsten's
coaching, appear excellent. The regu
lars are in many respects superior to
last year's team, and the first-year
men have developed into an outfit
which promises to furnish good ma
terial for future years.
In its workouts the varsity has been
playing half-hour and longer periods
against ineligibles and second-string
men. The latter have battled the regu
lars to close scores and on one occa
sion defeated them.
Allen at Center
Arden Allen will head the team as
captain. He plays in the center back
position. Allen and Bob Williams, an
other guard, make one of the fastest
backfields that has ever played for
Stanford. Both are among the speed
iest sprinters on the squad. Brandsten
has developed a style of play in which
the backs, on getting the ball, splash
