# Women's Clubhouse Will Give One O'Clock Dance
## 
### 
An eleventh anniversary dance
by the Women's Clubhouse
board will be given in the clubhouse
tomorrow night from 9 to 1 o'clock to
raise money for its fund.
The Women's Clubhouse, which cost
over $40,000, was opened in February,
1915. No charges w are asked for the
use of the clubhouse and since the
â– cost and maintenance of the clubhouse
rests entirely on the board, it is neces
sary for a number of dances to be
given to pay off the outstanding debt.
, Tyroler's orchestra will furnish the
music. The price of admission is $I.lo'
a couple.
