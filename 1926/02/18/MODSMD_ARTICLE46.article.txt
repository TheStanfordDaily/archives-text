# SCREAMING GIRLS PURSUED, BEATEN BY BANDIT MURDER PROVES PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENT HOAX FAKE KILLING CAUSES UPROAR IN O. A. C. CLASS
## 
### 
With terrible screams and cries for
help, two girls rushed into a class
room last week at O.A.C. pursued by
two men. The entire class was thrown
into an uproar. One of the girls car
ried a money bag. A pursuing man was
beating her in an effort to get the
money, while the second man was
shouting and flourish a gun. Just as
the first man secured the money, the
second fired, and the bandit fell at
the feet of the girl.
The events happened so rapidly that
several of the women in the class be
came hysterical, while members of the
department rushed in to learn the
cause of the uproar, and to find out
who was shot.
After the commotion had died, Dr.

r Meltzer, instructor in the department
. of psychology, asked the students to
, write down what they had just wit
nessed. He stated that the incident
1 was part of a psychology experiment
* being formed to illustrate the defec
s tive observation of human beings and
3 to show the causes of memory dis
-3 tortions.
a It was shown that there was no
a correlation between the feeling of ac
t curacy expressed by the students in
their reports, and the actual happen
t ings. Several thought that there were
i- seven in the incident, while others
e were not able to chronicle the events
b correctly. All of these facts go to
t show that the fidelity of report by wit
nesses is not altogether accurate, ac
cording to Meltzer.
