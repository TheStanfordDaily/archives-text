Miss Hansen is one of the most re
cent Russian artists to achieve recog
nition from press and public alike. Her
appearance before European audiences
dates from 1921, in which year she fled
from Russia. Her American debut in
Carnegie Hall established her as a
performer of the first rank.
Miss Hansen's program for tonight
will contain four groups. The opening
selection is "Ciaconna" by Vitali.
Group two is composed entirely of ar
rangements by Fritz Kreisler, the
noted Viennese violinist. "Rondino,"
by Beethoven, "Melodie," by Gluck,
and "Praeludium and Allegro," by
Pugnani, are all included in the ar
rangements.
Tchaikovsky Number
The brilliant "Concerto in D Major,
opus 35" by Tchaikovsky, will occupy
the third section. Several modern num
bers are found in the last group which
contains "Lotus Land" by Cyril Scott,
with arrangement by Kreisler;
"Danse" by Cyril Scott; "Alt Wein"
by Leopold Godowsky, arrangement by
Presser, and "Spinning Song" by Pop
per, arrangement by Auer, Miss Han
sen's famous violin teacher. Accom
paniment on the piano will be by
Boris Kakharoff.
Miss Hansen was born in a Cossack
settlement in Russia. As a child she
manifested a great interest in music,
which she first heard from Cossack
military bands. At an early age she
took up the violin at the Rostov con
servatory. In 1909 she became the
pupil of Professor Leopold Auer, whose
name is connected with the instruction
of many successful violinists.
Receives Medal
After five years of study under
Auer, Miss Hansen graduated with
the honor of being the youngest wo
man to receive the gold medal, being
only sixteen at the time. In her class
were Toscha Seidel and Jascha Heifitz,
both internationally known artists at
the present time.
The war made impossible a conti
nental tour which had been arranged
for her and she remained in Russia for
several years, becoming a popular idol
there by her playing. To escape revo
lutionary conditions she finally made
her escape in a flimsy rowboat through
the fog and rain of the Black Sea.
Tickets are being handled at the
Stanford Bookstore and at Crandall's
in Palo Alto. A few are still obtain
able for the concert.

Miss Hansen was born in a Cossack
settlement in Russia. As a child she
manifested a great interest in music,
which she first heard from Cossack
military bands. At an early age she
took up the violin at the Rostov con
servatory. In 1909 she became the
pupil of Professor Leopold Auer, whose
name is connected with the instruction
of many successful violinists.
Receives Medal
After five years of study under
Auer, Miss Hansen graduated with
the honor of being the youngest wo
man to receive the gold medal, being
only sixteen at the time. In her class
were Toscha Seidel and Jascha Heifitz,
both internationally known artists at
the present time.
The war made impossible a conti
nental tour which had been arranged
for her and she remained in Russia for
several years, becoming a popular idol
there by her playing. To escape revo
lutionary conditions she finally made
her escape in a flimsy rowboat through
the fog and rain of the Black Sea.
Tickets are being handled at the
Stanford Bookstore and at Crandall's
in Palo Alto. A few are still obtain
able for the concert.
Cecilia Hansen, Russian violinist,
will make lier first appearance on the
Stanford campus tonight when she
plays in the Assembly hall at 8:15
o'clock as the third artist on the

Miss Hansen is one of the most re
cent Russian artists to achieve recog
nition from press and public alike. Her
appearance before European audiences
dates from 1921, in which year she fled
from Russia. Her American debut in
Carnegie Hall established her as a
performer of the first rank.
Miss Hansen's program for tonight
will contain four groups. The opening
selection is "Ciaconna" by Vitali.
