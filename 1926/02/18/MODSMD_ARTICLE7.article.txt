# DECAY OF CHURCH HELD AS CAUSE OF CRIME GROWTH
## Weigel, Combellack Squad Meets Trojan Debaters In South Tonight 
### 
"The decay of church and home as
restraining influences on youth has
resulted in new freedom causing dis
regard for law and increase in crime,"
declared Theodore F. Baer, Stanford
speaker, in stating the affirmative
side of the question in the annual
U.S.C.-Stanford no-decision debate last
evening in the Assembly hall. Baer,
paired with George N. Crocker, up
held the question, "Resolved, That the
younger generation's freedom of
thought and action is detrimental to
society." Sam E. Gates and Arthur
Syvertson of the Los Angeles team
spoke for the negative.
Debate Tonight
Stanley A. Weigel and Fred Com
bellack, the Stanford negative team,
will meet Manuel Ruiz and Stanley
Hopper of U.S.C. in debate on the
same topic tonight at Los Angeles.
The Stanford pair left on the Lark
last night.
In opening, Baer showed how youth
had been blamed and condemned for
their actions in every known civiliza
tion, but that these criticisms had
been unfounded. In the present day,
however, the church and the home
were condemned as being responsible
for a new freedom of youth, the church
for not keeping pace with new
thought and discoveries, and the home
; for succumbing to disintegrating in
fluences such as moving pictures and
decadent literature.
Statistics showing that the average
age of penitentiary inmates today is
25 years of age in contrast to 35 years
in 1900 were quoted as evidences of
an increase of juvenile crime.
Youth Always Criticized
Gates, the first speaker for the nega
tive, showed how the younger genera
tion has always been condemned by
the older, and quoted authorities who
had declared that the younger genera
tion is as sound as had been their
parents. Youth was pictured as funda
mentally sound and wholesome, en
acting openly today what was done in
private and secrecy yesterday. Youth
was shown to occupy more important
positions in the business world than
at any other time in history.
Intellect Desirable
Crocker, Stanford affirmative speak
er, held that while intellectual free
dom was highly desirable, the present
day freedom with petting parties,
pocket flasks, and the like was de
cidedly not conducive to thought. On
the contrary, this freedom was likened
to an emptiness with no semblance
of order. The great mind was declared
to be the orderly mind, while the mod
ern conditions of disorder aided in
making the younger generation the
most criminal in the history of man
kind. Crocker closed with a plea to
better the conditions in the home and
church, the guiding influences of
youth.
Lindsay Quoted
Syvertson, the second negative
debater, stated the views of Judge Ben
Lindsay, famous juvenile jurist, who
condemns socie l conditions rather than
modern freedom Reports that the
middle-aged instead of youth were re
sponsible for not enforcing the 18th
Amendment were given. The youth
movement in the church, a "spiritual
renaissance," was given as an exam
ple that the influence of the church
was not decadent, while the home was
shown as based on certain permanent
laws of nature. The U.S.C. speaker
declared that a code of practical mor
ality would emerge from the tangle
of new social and economic conditions
of today.
Rebuttal speeches, which totaled
sixteen minutes for each side of the
question, followed the main argu
ments. Graham H. Stuart, professor
of Political Science, presided at the
contest.

however, the church and the home
were condemned as being responsible
for a new freedom of youth, the church
for not keeping pace with new
thought and discoveries, and the home
; for succumbing to disintegrating in
fluences such as moving pictures and
decadent literature.
Statistics showing that the average
age of penitentiary inmates today is
25 years of age in contrast to 35 years
in 1900 were quoted as evidences of
an increase of juvenile crime.
Youth Always Criticized
Gates, the first speaker for the nega
tive, showed how the younger genera
tion has always been condemned by
the older, and quoted authorities who
had declared that the younger genera
tion is as sound as had been their
parents. Youth was pictured as funda
mentally sound and wholesome, en
acting openly today what was done in
private and secrecy yesterday. Youth
was shown to occupy more important
positions in the business world than
at any other time in history.
Intellect Desirable
Crocker, Stanford affirmative speak
er, held that while intellectual free
dom was highly desirable, the present
day freedom with petting parties,
pocket flasks, and the like was de
cidedly not conducive to thought. On
the contrary, this freedom was likened
to an emptiness with no semblance
of order. The great mind was declared
to be the orderly mind, while the mod
ern conditions of disorder aided in
making the younger generation the
most criminal in the history of man
kind. Crocker closed with a plea to
better the conditions in the home and
church, the guiding influences of
youth.
Lindsay Quoted
Syvertson, the second negative
debater, stated the views of Judge Ben
Lindsay, famous juvenile jurist, who
condemns socie l conditions rather than
modern freedom Reports that the
middle-aged instead of youth were re
sponsible for not enforcing the 18th
Amendment were given. The youth
movement in the church, a "spiritual
renaissance," was given as an exam
ple that the influence of the church
was not decadent, while the home was
shown as based on certain permanent
laws of nature. The U.S.C. speaker
declared that a code of practical mor
ality would emerge from the tangle
of new social and economic conditions
of today.
Rebuttal speeches, which totaled
sixteen minutes for each side of the
question, followed the main argu
ments. Graham H. Stuart, professor
of Political Science, presided at the
contest.
"The decay of church and home as
restraining influences on youth has
resulted in new freedom causing dis
regard for law and increase in crime,"
declared Theodore F. Baer, Stanford
speaker, in stating the affirmative
side of the question in the annual
U.S.C.-Stanford no-decision debate last
evening in the Assembly hall. Baer,
paired with George N. Crocker, up
held the question, "Resolved, That the
younger generation's freedom of
thought and action is detrimental to
society." Sam E. Gates and Arthur
Syvertson of the Los Angeles team
spoke for the negative.
Debate Tonight
Stanley A. Weigel and Fred Com
bellack, the Stanford negative team,
will meet Manuel Ruiz and Stanley
Hopper of U.S.C. in debate on the
same topic tonight at Los Angeles.
The Stanford pair left on the Lark
last night.
In opening, Baer showed how youth
had been blamed and condemned for
their actions in every known civiliza
tion, but that these criticisms had
been unfounded. In the present day,
however, the church and the home
were condemned as being responsible
for a new freedom of youth, the church
for not keeping pace with new
thought and discoveries, and the home
; for succumbing to disintegrating in
