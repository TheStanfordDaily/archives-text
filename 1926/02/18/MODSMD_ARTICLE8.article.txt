# ZOOLOGY MUSEUM GETS SPECIMENS OF RARE TROUT SPECIES
## 
### 
Twenty specimens of a rare species
of trout s-ecured from the peninsula of
Lower California by the Museum of
Vertebrate Zoology of the University
of California have been presented to
the Zoology Museum at Stanford by
Dr. J. W. Grinnell, Stanford *01. Dr.
Grinnell is a member of the Zoology
department at the University of Cali
fornia.
This species of trout is the furthest
south on the continent and is restrict
ed in distribution to about twelve
miles of a stream in the San Pedro
Martir mountains of Lower California.
The stream is far south of the waters
where trout are generally found. As
far as is known the Santo Domingo
river is the only river in Lower Cali
fornia to be inhabited by trout.
The water of the stream may be
diverted for power purposes at a point
above the falls, according to plans now
being made. Unless the trout can be
transplanted in such case, tlvey will
become extinct. It is believed that no
other stream in the region affords the
permanently flowing water necessary.
Examination of the collection showed
that this species of trout is a' geo
graphically isolated form of the rain
bow trout common to many streams
of the coastal regions of Oregon and
California. It reached its present habi
tat when the range of trout, along with
many other northern species, extended
further south because of more favor
able temperature conditions.
