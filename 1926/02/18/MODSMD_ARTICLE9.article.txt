# HOLMES' SHOOTING IMPROVES WORK OF CALIFORNIA'S FIVE
## 
### 
University of California, February 18.â€”
There should be a busy time in the pa
vilion at Stanford this week end if the
Cardinal basketball team expects to gain
a hold on the Conference series Saturday
night. Should the Rcdshirts drop this
game to the Bears, championship honors
would come back to Berkeley for another
year. Cancellation of a third game will
probably be made if California wins, and
Stanford would lose her cliance to meet
the Bears a week from next Wednesday.
Captain Benny Holmes lias found him
self, and much is expected of his im
proved shooting on Saturday. As a re
sult, the Iliggins, Watson, Holmes com
bination will be more effective than ever.
Higgins is at top form, and is strengthen
ing the team with bis steady work around
the basket. Dixon and Carver arc tight
ening tip in guarding and promise to make
it warm for the Cardinal forwards when
the two teams meet.
