# CALIFORNIA SQUADS MEET CARDINAL IN WATER POLO TILTS
## VARSITY, FRESHMEN PLAY Stanford Teams Doped to Gain Double Win Over Bear Sevens 
### Herb Klein 
Tomorrow will be "Big Game" day
in aquatic sports. The California-
Stanford varsity and freshman water
polo teams will meet in Encina pool
beginning at 1:30 o'clock in the after
noon. Ernst Brandsten, water polo
and swimming coach, gave his men
their final workout yesterday and ex
pressed his belief that they are ready
to uphold what has become a Stan
ford tradition: a double victory over
California. The freshman game will be
first on the program.
Daily practice has been held at En
cina pool since the first of the quarter
and the players are in good condition.
During the last week varsity and first
year men have played for half an hour
at a time against sevens of nearly
equal strength and thus should be able
to go through the two seven-minute
halves which make up a regular game
at top speed.
California Weak
California will be at a disadvantage
as far as length of practice goes. The
Berkeley team only started working
out the first of this month and were
obliged to ask for a postponement of
the original date set a week ago. They
have trained in the pool of the Athens
Club of Oakland under the coaching
of Jack Robertson, Olympic Club swim
mer, and according to the "Daily Cal,"
figure that they have one of their
best chances to beat Stanford this
year in the varsity game,, at least.
Their team will be built around Cap
tain Paul Iveene, Art Hargraves, Cliff
Mayne, Dusty Ilhoades, and Sid Glas
son.
The Stanford team lineup is as fol
lows: forwards: Art Stewart, Kryne
Van den Akker, Phil Brooks; guards:
Arden Allen (captain), Bob Williams,
Kenny Graham; goal guard, Wardle
Poulsen. Johnny Mack will alternate
with Brooks as a forward. The team is
well balanced and has no weak spots.
The backfield is fast and will probably
be responsible for as many goals as
the forward lineup. Brandsten has
coached a passing game with men al
ways on the move, looking for a
chance to shoot. Dribbles the length
of the 90-foot playing field by the back
field men should furnish some of the
thrills of the game.
Fouling Penalized
A man once called out of a water
polo game for fouling cannot be sub
stituted for until a goal has been
scored, so that any fouling such as
moving after the whistle has blown,
ducking a man who hasn't the ball
in his hands, taking the ball under
water, and so forth, will be strictly
guarded against by the Card players
if they heed Brandsten's instructions.
The freshman lineup will be as fol
lows : forwards, Bob Burns, Cal Strong,
Lewis Hunter; backfield, Louie Thon,
Tom Thurlow, Truman Parker; goal
guard, Bill Burke. The first-year men
have a seven with snap and good
teamwork. Strong and Burns in the
forward lineup and Thurlow in the
backfield are the mainstays and can
give any team trouble with their speed
and shooting ability.

chance to shoot. Dribbles the length
of the 90-foot playing field by the back
field men should furnish some of the
thrills of the game.
Fouling Penalized
A man once called out of a water
polo game for fouling cannot be sub
stituted for until a goal has been
scored, so that any fouling such as
moving after the whistle has blown,
ducking a man who hasn't the ball
in his hands, taking the ball under
water, and so forth, will be strictly
guarded against by the Card players
if they heed Brandsten's instructions.
The freshman lineup will be as fol
lows : forwards, Bob Burns, Cal Strong,
Lewis Hunter; backfield, Louie Thon,
Tom Thurlow, Truman Parker; goal
guard, Bill Burke. The first-year men
have a seven with snap and good
teamwork. Strong and Burns in the
forward lineup and Thurlow in the
backfield are the mainstays and can
give any team trouble with their speed
and shooting ability.
Tomorrow will be "Big Game" day
in aquatic sports. The California-
Stanford varsity and freshman water
polo teams will meet in Encina pool
beginning at 1:30 o'clock in the after
noon. Ernst Brandsten, water polo
and swimming coach, gave his men
their final workout yesterday and ex
pressed his belief that they are ready
to uphold what has become a Stan
ford tradition: a double victory over
California. The freshman game will be
first on the program.
Daily practice has been held at En
cina pool since the first of the quarter
and the players are in good condition.
During the last week varsity and first
year men have played for half an hour
at a time against sevens of nearly
equal strength and thus should be able
to go through the two seven-minute
halves which make up a regular game
at top speed.
California Weak
California will be at a disadvantage
as far as length of practice goes. The
Berkeley team only started working
out the first of this month and were
obliged to ask for a postponement of
the original date set a week ago. They
have trained in the pool of the Athens
Club of Oakland under the coaching
of Jack Robertson, Olympic Club swim
mer, and according to the "Daily Cal,"
figure that they have one of their
best chances to beat Stanford this
year in the varsity game,, at least.
Their team will be built around Cap
tain Paul Iveene, Art Hargraves, Cliff
Mayne, Dusty Ilhoades, and Sid Glas
son.
The Stanford team lineup is as fol
lows: forwards: Art Stewart, Kryne
Van den Akker, Phil Brooks; guards:
Arden Allen (captain), Bob Williams,
Kenny Graham; goal guard, Wardle
Poulsen. Johnny Mack will alternate
with Brooks as a forward. The team is
well balanced and has no weak spots.
The backfield is fast and will probably
be responsible for as many goals as
the forward lineup. Brandsten has
coached a passing game with men al
ways on the move, looking for a
chance to shoot. Dribbles the length
of the 90-foot playing field by the back
field men should furnish some of the
thrills of the game.
