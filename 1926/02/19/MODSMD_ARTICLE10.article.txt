Smith is dead. After having
served faithfully during 35 years
of army duty, including the Span
ish-American War, Smith, horse
No. 21, of the Military depart
ment, quietly went into the great
beyond on Saturday at 8 o'clock
after a sickness of five hours. He
was attended at his death-stall by
Sergeant Michael Sullivan. True
to his colors, Smith died with his
shoes on.
And he is not unmourned. A
certain person, who has been<rid
ing him for years in the faculty
riding class, arrived last Satur
day to take out the steed, and on
hearing the sad news, turned
away, pocketing two lumps of
sugar.
Smith was buried with all
honors in the horse cemetery
near the old stock farm; since
that time, someone has been put
ting a bouquet of wild flowers on
his grave every morning.
