milya, varsity, and Bob Syer, Herbert
Fleishliacker, Ward Edmonds, fresh
men.
Lang Title Prospect
Lang, Meyberg, and Stanley are
considered among Stanford's best pos
sibilities for the title. Lang has had
two years of varsity experience and
has won in the California tournament
on both occasions. Meyberg is playing
his first year on the varsity, but has
a creditable record in frosh and off
campus play. Stanley is expected to
make a good showing this year as he
is familiar with the difficult Pebble
Beach course. Neil Miller is a recent
transfer from the University of South
ern California where he starred with
the golf team last year. Vermilya,
while new to the varsity, has had con
siderable experience.
Play in the eighteen-hole qualifying
round will open Saturday morning
when all but sixteen players will be
eliminated. The first round will start
on Saturday .afternoon, the tournament
being run off in the form of match
play. The final play-off will -be held
on Monday, and the perpetual trophy
will be awarded to the champion.
Finalists and semi-finalists will be
awarded gold medals.
U.C. Out of Running
California, whose representatives
have won for the past two years, is
not counted as a strong contender
this year due to the absence of its
star, Lauren Upson. Lloyd Thomas,
Jack Nounan, and Johnny Tait will
play for the Bears. Washington has a
strong entry with Jack Westland, for
mer national intercollegiate champion,
and Charles Hunter, California ama
teur semi-finalist of last year. The
Branch is entering Harold Thompson,
also state amateur semi-finalist. The
strength of the U.S.C. entry is not
known.
The Pebble Beach course is one of
the best and most tricky in the state,
and was the site of the last state ama
teur tourney. The links are expected
to be in good condition for the meet.
