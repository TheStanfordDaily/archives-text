# VARSITY BASEBALL MEN PLAY POLICE TEAM TOMORROW
## OPPOSE BRONCS MONDAY Near Defeat by Santa Clara Bars Overconfidence; Workout Today 
### Herbert Klein 
The varsity baseball nine will play
its second game of the quarter when
they meet the Redwood City Police
team tomorrow afternoon at 3:30
o'clock on the varsity diamond and
will oppose Santa Clara in a return
game here Monday.
The 8-6 victory over Santa Clara last
Wednesday came too near being a de
feat for any overconfidence to get a
start and the men should be on their
toes to play their best ball. An in
tensive workout was held today under
the supervision of Coach Harry Wol
ter. The infield was put through its
paces and the pitching staff got a
workout which Wednesday's game
showed it sorely needed.
Wolter feels confident that he has
picked a good lineup for both infield
and outfield, and that practice and
lots of it is what is needed most. Rain
had kept the players off the diamond
for nearly two weeks before the
Bronco game and rapid improvement
should result now that the skies are
smiling again.
Sypher Off Game Wednesday
Sypher, the first-string catcher, like
the rest of the team, was off his game
Wednesday, but, considering the wild
throws he had to hang on to, he gave
the pitchers good support. Johnston,
on the first sack, Garibaldi at second,
Captain Cuddeback at third, and
Busch &t shortstop, is the infield which
will start the game tomorrow. These
players all gave signs of improvement
in the workout yesterday.
Stewart, Weaver, and Nissen have
been covering the outfield creditably
and are showing up well with the bat.
Pitchers Big Problem
Wolter's big problem now is with
his pitching staff. Oviatt had little
control in the Santa Clara game, and
Collins, who followed him, went well
for a couple of innings and then start
ed handing walks to half the Bronc
team. Philippi was in just long enough
to show that he was following in Col
lins' foosteps. Sobieski, who fanned
the last two Missionites in the ninth,
was the only one who demonstrated
any control. Wolter has Mike Rey
nolds as a prospective moundsman.
Judge Griffin of Redwood City has
organized his "Police" team annually
for many years, and a game with this
nine has been a fixture on the Stan
ford schedule. The game last year was
called off on account of rain. Several
ex-pro stars are playing for the judge
this year and may be expected to give
the varsity a hard fight.
