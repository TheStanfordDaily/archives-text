# CARDINAL FIVE DOPED TO LOSE SECOND GAME TO CALIFORNIA
## Unbeaten Bears Would Gain Southern Division Title By Victory 
### Jim Adams 
Entering the fray with the odds
against it because of its questionable
capabilities, the Stanford team will
meet the California five tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock in the Oakland Audi
torium in the second game of the
annual series. A victory by the Bears
would give them the championship of
the southern division of the Pacific
Coast Conference and put them in line
to meet â€žthe winners of the northern
division for Coast honors. Should the
Redshirts win, the two teams would be
tied and the dispute would be settled
by a third game to be played one week
later.
By virtue of a series of fourteen
victories, which includes one over the
Cards, the Berkeley five is favored to
take the laurels. Stanford has met de
feat on three occasions. It dropped an
early-season game to the Grizzlies, al
though later beating them; it bowed
to the Olympic Club three weeks later,
and the Bears took the first game of
the series by the close score of 18
to 17 three weeks ago.
Many Combinations Used
Kerr has shifted his men all year
because of illness, injuries, and other
reasons. The lineup has not been an
nounced, and it is not definitely known
which two *of the three forwards,
Price, Clark, and David, will start.
Clark has been the most consistent of
the three and has come through in
tight situations several times. Captain
Price plays a steady floor game but
has been off in his shooting all year.
Handicapped by illness, David has not
had opportunity to show much recent
ly, although he is perhaps the best
shot of the three.
Jayred is likely to start at center
and Vincenti at guard. Who will start
at standing guard is a question. Either
Biaggini or Newhouse will probably
answer the opening whistle, although
Anderson's ankle has improved so
much that Kerr will use him as much
as possible. In godd condition, Ander
son would be of immense value in
protecting the goal from the efficient
Higgins and Holmes.
Higgins, Holmes U.C. Stars
The two latter named California
players are the stars of the Blue and
Gold team. Higgins has been high
point. man in the majority of games,
but Captain Benny Holmes has come
up recently and is finding the basket
with deadly frequency. Carver is back
in harness after a forced lay-off due to
an injured ankle. He and Dixon are
slated to fill the guard positions with
Watson at the other forward berth.
The Oakland Auditorium has been
the scene of some close and hard
fought contests between the basket
ball teams of the two institutions.
There are plenty of seats and a large
crowd is expected to turn out to see
the game.
The Stanford team leaves the cam
pus at 11 o'clock Saturday morning
and will spend the afternoon resting
at a Berkeley hotel.
