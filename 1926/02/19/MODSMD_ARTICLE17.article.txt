# TWO WEIGHT TEAMS TO MEET BERKELEY DURING WEEK-END
## Stanford Quintets Conceded Only Fighting Chance For Victories 
### 
Stanford's two weight teams will
clash with the Bears tonight and to
morrow night as preliminary games
to the freshman and varsity contests.
Both squads lost to California in the
first meeting of the annual series, but
they have improved since that time
and should give the Blue and Gold
a hard battle. The 130's will play to
night in the Harmon gymnasium in
Berkeley at 7 o'clock, while the mid
dleweiglits will appear on the floor of
the Oakland auditorium tomorrow
night at the same time.
. The Stanford 130's will probably
start the following lineup: Captain
Thomas and Whitney, forwards; Ray,
center; Spradling at running guard,
and Larsen at standing guard. Thom
as should show well in the clash as
he works the floor well and can shoot.
Whitney was in a slump in the last
game or two, but he passes the ball
fairly well. Lindholm may get in at
forward some time during the eve
ning. Ray will start at center, but
Macy will probably also get a chance
to show his worth, because of the
showing he has made in the last few
games. The California defense will
find Spradling a hard man to stop.
Larsen will handle the back guard
duties, and ought to handle that posi
tion well, although he is still a trifle
inexperienced. Sano, Brockway, and
Fritts will substitute at guard posi
tions.
On the 145-pound team George will
start at one forward, with either King
or Blazier at the other. Moore has a
good chance of working in at forward.
Cook cinched the right to start at
center by his showing against the U.C.
Dental College, but Sanders may re
lieve him for awhile. Captain New
comb and Ankele will hold down the
guard positions.
