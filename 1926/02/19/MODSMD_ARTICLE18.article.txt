# Y.W.C.A. TO RAISE BUDGET OF $1600 IN FINANCE DRIVE
## 
### 
With a budget of $1600 to be raised,
I the campus Y.W.C.A. will conduct its
| annual finance drive for three days,
i from Wednesday to Friday. The bud
j get includes items for local expenses,
; national dues, a fund for convention
i delegates, and half of Stanford's quota
of $SOO for the Student Friendship
Fund.
"A strong delegation to the national
Y.M.C.A. convention to be held in
Milwaukee, April 21-26 would ade
quately represent Stanford for the
first time, and would vitalize the work
of (he local Association," stated Isabel
! Capps, local secretary. This conven
; tion is the bi-ennial meeting of repre
j sentatives of the entire Y.W.C.A. of
this country, with divisional meetings
of student delegations, Girl Reserve
delegations, and all other phases of
I the organization.
The Student Assembly, of which
1 Miss Capps was president in 1923, is
j a gathering of the student associations
of all American colleges, and convenes
;at this time.
"It is a liberal education to those
j who go to sit in meetings with girls
' from the whole United States, and it
]is the making of the future for the
| Association if we are wise in picking
' our representatives. Every girl in the
i University should be eager to contri
j bute to such a fund, regardless of
I whether or not she has any interest
;in the Y.W.C.A. herself, because we
want Stanford to take its place among
! student, activities, and at the present
time it is not doing so," Miss Capps
said in speaking of the convention
fund.
Each college association contributes
to the support of the National Student
Council, which represents them as a
unit. It links the student section with
the other sections of the Y.W.C.A.,
not only in America, but in twenty
countries where the Association is lo
cated, and with the twenty-sevon
countries which the World Student
I Christian Federation reaches.
