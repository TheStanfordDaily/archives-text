# INTRAMURAL TENNIS PASSES FIRST ROUND
## 
### 
Despite poor weather conditions, all of
the first round matches of the intramural
tennis tournament have been played. All
matches from No. 1 to No. 14, and from
No. 18 to No. 23 inclusive that have not
been played by Friday will be defaulted.
Over the weekend, and on Monday, games
Nos. 22 to 31 must be finished. Since the
rains have spoiled the original schedule,
tennis managers of the competing living
groups should call up their opponents and
arrange for the play.
Of the original forty-two teams entered
in the tournament only fifteen remain in
the running. The teams remaining are:
El Tigre, Junipero Serra, Alpha Tau
Omega, Branner II, Breakers, Branner I,
Sigma Nu, Los Arcos, Phi Gamma Delta,
Phi Sigma Kappa, Alpha Kappa Lambda,
Delta Chi, Phi Kappa Psi, Zeta Psi, and
Beta Theta Pi.
