# "One Down"
## 
### 
There is no use talking; Stanford was outplayed when it lost to
Nevada last week. But the score of the first California game doesn't show
that Cardinal was very much the underdog. Tomorrow night the basket
ball squad will have the opportunity to make up for that heartbreaking
loss.
The situation now is different from what it was when our defeats were
attributed to the time honored "Stanford Jonah," and the rooters were
urged to eradicate from their minds the sentiment that California could
win merely because it had won so consistently in the past. The football,
baseball, and track teams have shown that this idea of the psychological
supremacy of the Golden Bear is just so much rot.
Stanford has a good basketball team. Not so long ago it threw a
monkey wrench into the mechanism of the University of Southern Cali
fornia machine; and divided a series with the Southern Branch. Then
Nevada —but we are not concerned with this.
The California series is our goal. Stanford is now "one down"; but,
if all goes well tomorrow night and the team displays the kind of basket
ball that it is capable of playing, the reckoning should be "even-up and
one to go."
