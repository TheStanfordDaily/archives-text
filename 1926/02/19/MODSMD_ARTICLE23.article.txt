# Brandsten's Tradition
## 
### 
In years gone by a tradition of victory has been bnilt up by Stanford's
swimming and water polo teams. Whether California or Stanford has
the best sevens this year is to be determined when both varsity and fresh
man representatives of the two institutions meet in the Encina pool to
morrow.
Knowing Coast Ernst Brandsten and his ability to turn out teams of
the highest standing, we have little fear that the Cardinal will not triumph.
However, dispatches coming from the other party concerned indicate that
California will be represented by strong teams; but Stanford is still the
heavy favorite.
Tearful state of affairs noted by the Oklahoma Daily:
"Due to the unavoidable absence of the most important neophyte ,the Zeta Sigma
initiation scheduled to be held at 12 o'clock Saturday night, has been postponed, ac
cording to the executive committee.
The ceremony will be held Tuesday night at the Varsity Shop regardless of
whether the most important neophyte is present or not, the executive committee fur
ther stated."
Nigger in the wood-pile of the University of North Dakota as noted in
the Dakota Student:
"John M. Hancock, New York City, gave the University memorial drive its first
financial thrill Friday in true two-gun style, with a conditional donation of $25,000.
. . . Last year Mr. Hancock was chosen one of the University's ten greatest grad
uates by a popular vote contest."
