Episode V
A BLIND DATE
I will now tell you of one of the
greatest delusions that a girl encoun
ters at college. One who has never
been to college little realizes the va
riety of means that are used to play
upon an innocent girl's feelings and
lead her into mistaken paths.
One of the cleverest deceptions for
this purpose that I encountered in my
college career was the making of un
known dates. (A direct result of this
hallucinative institution led to my
finally leaving college.) If I had only
realized before it was too late, how
many girls I might have saved from
discomfort and ennui on that night of
the Hall dance.
The day hefore the dance my room
mate, Maurathea Providence, told me
that she had gotten me a blind date
(so called). She said that the boy had
asked her but that she didn't want to
go with him (I thought because he was
blind) so she had given the date to
me. Of course I would never have
considered accepting had I not been
impelled by pity for the poor blind
boy, and by indignation at my room
mate's heartlessness. (I thought, what
a pleasure for him to have someone
like mo to lead him around the dance

j floor, and how unfortunate it would be
j that he could never see me.)
Later, when I found that several
other girls in the hall also had (so
called) blind dates, my suspicions were
aroused; but Maurathea had never de
; ceived me like that before. When the
night of the dance came, and when
Maurathea brought me down to intro
duce me to my supposedly blind part
ner, 1 saw at once that he was neither
blind nor a stranger. I had danced with
him before and he certainly was not
1 blind then.

Drain the cup for Louis Smelz,
Fastidious, if nothing else.
Tip has his cords cleaned once n week,
A whisker never mars his cheek.
| His hair is parted on a line
That never varies, timo on time.
1 To look at him, you'd think his face
! J Had just been taken from its case.
