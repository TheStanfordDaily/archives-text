### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Mac Smith will come into his own this year, or thousands
of golfers will miss their guesses. After his sensational
playing in the Far Western tournaments, it is hard to see
how an unkind fate can any longer bar Mac's road to a
British or a United States op-en championship. A brief
resume of Smith's history will tell you why he is so deserv
ing of these, golf's greatest awards. "Mac" arrived in
America from Carnoustie when he was eighteen years old.
He was the youngest of five brothers, all of whom were
fine golfers.
Young Smith speedily proceeded to tie for first place in
the U. S. open championship in 1910 with his brother Alex
and J. J. McDermott. Brother Alex won, and that was the
nearest that Mac ever came to the title. Two years later
he won the Western open, and in 1914, the Metropolitan
open championship. Then he suffered a nervous breakdown,

retired to California, and was lost in obscurity, as far as golf went, for nearly
ten years.
In 1923 a new Macdonald Smith appeared, entirely recovered from his break
down, married, and playing better golf than ever. He placed third in the
British open that year, and the following year also. And when he won the
California open in 1924, it was his first tournament victory since 1914.
Last year, it will be remembered, Smith won the North and South open, the
Western open, and the Long Island open, all with the same score of 281, and
was also first again in the California open. He was medalist in the National
open qualifying rounds at Lido, but failed at Worcester. He led the field in
the British open, but fell into evil ways and took an 83 on the final round,
finishing fourth..
Smith's splendid playing last month in winning the Texas and the Dallas
open titles give great promise that before the year 1926 reaches the home
green, he wiil at last have the long coveted national title in his possession.
