# RAY TAYLOR STARS IN PRACTICE GYM SQUAD COMPETITION
## 
### 
Ray Taylor, Sterling Beckwith, and
Ellis Abbe were high men in the prac
tice gym meet which was held in
Encina gym yesterday. Taylor was
star of the meet with twenty-two
points. Beckwith took second place
with eleven taliies, und Abbe was
third with eight. Captain Wayne
Smith did not compete.
More men turned out yesterday
than for any other practice gym meet
ever held. A marked improvement in
technique was shown in the meet over
that displayed at the beginning of the
season. The remainder of the training
period will be devoted to developing
form.
Manager Abbe is confident that by
the time of the California meet Stan
ford should have an even break with
the Bears. Ray Taylor, Chris Freeman,
Sterling Beckwith, Ellis Abbe, Leon
Brown, and Guy King will form the
backbone of the quad which will be
picked by Coach Charles W. Davis as
a result of yesterday's meet.
Bob Gooden and Philip Stitt, fresh
men, showed up remarkably well, and
will strengthen next year's team, al
though they cannot compete this year.
