"Some of our college lectures should
not be given," declared Dr. Jordan in
discussing the past and pres-ent his
tory of universities at the conference
held in his home last evening, "but
once in awhile we do get some real
value from a lecturer. There are two
kinds of good lectures: one which is
inspiring, and the other which is care
ful and thoughtful. Between these two
there are all grades of lectures and
lecturers."
Dr. Jordan found one of the dangers
to real education in what he termed
as the present tendency toward "gigan
ticism" in our American cblleges and
universities. He believes that colleges
have become very fashionable since
the war. People are more and more
realizing that college .can fit people
for all kinds of professions. The great
trouble with a large group, according
to Jordan, is that it keeps the students
away from their instructors and it is
desirable for every every student to
know at least one professor well.
"Real seriousness of intent in col
lege belongs to the West where there
is less of the country club attitude on
the part of the students," said Dr.
Jordan. "The more students colleges
take to the edge of the campus and
drop off, the more serious the attitude
toward education becomes. The value
of college depends entirely on the
ability of the individual to absorb it."
