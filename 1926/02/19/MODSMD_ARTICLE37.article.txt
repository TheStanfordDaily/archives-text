# TESTS OF INEBRIATES PLANNED FOR POLICE

A set of "Standardized Tests for In
ebriation" were made public last week by
a committee of the British Medical Asso
ciation. The tests are planned for use by
the London police.
The "enunciatory tests" consist of the
suspect repeating the following phrases:
"The Leith police dismisseth us"; "The
sea ccascth and it sufficeth us"; "truly
rural"British constitution and Metho
dist Episcopal."
The "equilibristic tests" include various
interesting exercises; standing motionless
with hands clasped behind head, with feet
together; standing on one leg with eyes
closed; touching the tip of the nose with
one finger with eyes shut; bending down
and touching the right toe with the left
forefinger; standing with heels together
and eyes closed, without wabbling; walk
ing a chalk line.
Women's basketball games at Ober
