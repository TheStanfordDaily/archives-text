# RUSSIAN VIOLINIST PLEASES AUDIENCE IN CAMPUS RECITAL
## 
### Music Critic 
Youth and charm gave Cecilia Han
sen, Russian violinist, a pleasing plat
form presence in her recital last night.
Her technical ability and sincerity of
playing won the audience completely,
j and several encores were given.
I "Ciaconna," by Vitali, which opened
j the program, seemed to demonstrate
Miss Hansen's ability to overcome play
superbly, but as the concert pro
gressed her interpretations became
more full of feeling. She was never,
at any time, what could be called a
sentimental artist, but played from the
Intellect rather than the emotions.
Boris Kakharoff at the piano was
capable and painstaking in his accom
paniment, but never inspired.
Tchaikowsky's "Concerto in I)
Major" was the main work on the
program in point of length and de
mands on technical ability. It had
melodic beauty, but unfortunately, in
accord with the custom at its time of
composition, contained a long cadenza,
during which the listener loses the
mood of the music while the performer
goes through a series of scale exer
cises and other displays of purely
technical skill.
More modern numbers were con
tained in the last of the four groups
on the program. Cyril Scott's "Lotus
Land" was properly langorous and be
witching with an exotic quality that
set it apart from the rest. "Danse" by
the same composer was a contract
with vigor and life. "Alt-Wien," by
Godowsky, was so pleasing with its
truly Viennese mixture of sentiment,
charm, and whimsicality that the audi
ence insisted on having it repeated.
Kreisler's "Liebesfreud," an encore,
also won approval.
The concert was the third of the
annual series of the Peninsula Musical
Association, given in the Stanford
Assembly hall. The next recital will
be on Thursday, April 15, when Ed
ward Johnson, tenor, and Joan Ruth,
soprano, appear in joint recital.
