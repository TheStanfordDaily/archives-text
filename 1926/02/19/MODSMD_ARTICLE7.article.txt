# YEARLINGS CLASH WITH CALIFORNIA FRESHMAN TEAM
## GAME IN HARMON GYM Coach Husky Hunt Rebuilds Team, Cubs Have Edge Over Babes 
### 
By Cliff McDowell
i Stanford's freshman basketball team
will meet the California freshman
' quintet at 8 o'clock tonight in Harmon
Gymnasium, Berkeley, in the second
game of the annual frosh series. If
Stanford wins tonight, a third game
will be played, as California won the
first game three weeks ago, 26 to 14.
On paper, the California frosh ap
pear to have a decided edge on the
; contest, but Coach Husky Hunt has
J completely rebuilt his team since the
first game with the Bear Cubs, and
has a much stronger five than he had
at that time.
Defense Strengthened
The defensive department, in which
the Stanford team showed glaring
weakness in the first game, has been
considerably strengthened with ;the
addition of Robb at standing guard.
Robb is a clever player, fast on his
, feet, and will give the Blue and Gold
forwards plenty of trouble. He is a
little light for the position, however,
1 and will have his hands full against
the heavier Bears.
McCandless, center for the Cardinal
babes, is expected to do most of the
scoring for the yearlings. He has been
high-point man in almost every game
this season, and is one of the most
promising players on the squad.
Spud Lewis has been playing the
running guard position throughout the
I season, and is a fast, aggressive
player. In the forward positions Hunt
I will start Sexson and Renzel. Sexson
: is a clever man, fast at passing, and
knows plenty of tricks at dribbling
| and pivoting. Renzel is a fairly con
j sistent forward, good at both passing
| and shooting, but lacks experience.
U.C. Team Unchanged
Coach Clint Evans of the California
\ frosh will start the same team he has
used all season. Captain Dougery, for
ward, is the backbone of the Bear
squad and a heavy, aggressive player.
Wyatt, who plays the other forward
position, lacks the weight of his team
mate, but is exceptionally fast and has
taken the scoring honors in most of
the games this year. Corbin is a tall,
rangy center and works well with the
two forwards. Gregory and Clymer
complete the first team with the guard
positions. Gregory is a good offensive
player, and Clymer, who plays in the
hole most of the time, is one of the
best defensive men on the Cubs' squad.
The starting lineups:
Stanford — California —
Sexson F Dougery
Renzel F Wyatt
McCandless C Corbin
Lewis G Gregory
Robb G Clymer
To promote friendly relations with in
dividual students, the Dean of Women at
the University of Texas has sent a letter
of congratulation to each woman regis
tered.

ward, is the backbone of the Bear
squad and a heavy, aggressive player.
Wyatt, who plays the other forward
position, lacks the weight of his team
mate, but is exceptionally fast and has
taken the scoring honors in most of
the games this year. Corbin is a tall,
rangy center and works well with the
two forwards. Gregory and Clymer
complete the first team with the guard
positions. Gregory is a good offensive
player, and Clymer, who plays in the
hole most of the time, is one of the
best defensive men on the Cubs' squad.
The starting lineups:
Stanford — California —
Sexson F Dougery
Renzel F Wyatt
McCandless C Corbin
Lewis G Gregory
Robb G Clymer
To promote friendly relations with in
dividual students, the Dean of Women at
the University of Texas has sent a letter

i Stanford's freshman basketball team
will meet the California freshman
' quintet at 8 o'clock tonight in Harmon
Gymnasium, Berkeley, in the second
game of the annual frosh series. If
Stanford wins tonight, a third game
will be played, as California won the
first game three weeks ago, 26 to 14.
On paper, the California frosh ap
pear to have a decided edge on the
; contest, but Coach Husky Hunt has
J completely rebuilt his team since the
first game with the Bear Cubs, and
has a much stronger five than he had
at that time.
Defense Strengthened
The defensive department, in which
the Stanford team showed glaring
weakness in the first game, has been
considerably strengthened with ;the
addition of Robb at standing guard.
Robb is a clever player, fast on his
, feet, and will give the Blue and Gold
forwards plenty of trouble. He is a
little light for the position, however,
1 and will have his hands full against
the heavier Bears.
McCandless, center for the Cardinal
babes, is expected to do most of the
scoring for the yearlings. He has been
high-point man in almost every game
this season, and is one of the most
promising players on the squad.
Spud Lewis has been playing the
running guard position throughout the
I season, and is a fast, aggressive
player. In the forward positions Hunt
I will start Sexson and Renzel. Sexson
: is a clever man, fast at passing, and
knows plenty of tricks at dribbling
| and pivoting. Renzel is a fairly con
j sistent forward, good at both passing
| and shooting, but lacks experience.
U.C. Team Unchanged
Coach Clint Evans of the California
\ frosh will start the same team he has
used all season. Captain Dougery, for
ward, is the backbone of the Bear
squad and a heavy, aggressive player.
Wyatt, who plays the other forward
position, lacks the weight of his team
mate, but is exceptionally fast and has
taken the scoring honors in most of
the games this year. Corbin is a tall,
