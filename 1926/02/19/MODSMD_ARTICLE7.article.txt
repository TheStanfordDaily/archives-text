## GAME IN HARMON GYM Coach Husky Hunt Rebuilds Team, Cubs Have Edge Over Babes 
### 
By Cliff McDowell
i Stanford's freshman basketball team
will meet the California freshman
' quintet at 8 o'clock tonight in Harmon
Gymnasium, Berkeley, in the second
game of the annual frosh series. If
Stanford wins tonight, a third game
will be played, as California won the
first game three weeks ago, 26 to 14.
On paper, the California frosh ap
pear to have a decided edge on the
; contest, but Coach Husky Hunt has
J completely rebuilt his team since the
first game with the Bear Cubs, and
has a much stronger five than he had
at that time.
Defense Strengthened
The defensive department, in which
the Stanford team showed glaring
weakness in the first game, has been
considerably strengthened with ;the
addition of Robb at standing guard.
Robb is a clever player, fast on his
, feet, and will give the Blue and Gold
forwards plenty of trouble. He is a
little light for the position, however,
1 and will have his hands full against
the heavier Bears.
McCandless, center for the Cardinal
babes, is expected to do most of the
scoring for the yearlings. He has been
high-point man in almost every game
this season, and is one of the most
promising players on the squad.
Spud Lewis has been playing the
running guard position throughout the
I season, and is a fast, aggressive
player. In the forward positions Hunt
I will start Sexson and Renzel. Sexson
: is a clever man, fast at passing, and
knows plenty of tricks at dribbling
