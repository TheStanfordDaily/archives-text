# STANFORD DEBATERS UPHOLD NEGATIVE IN SECOND U.S.C. MEET
## 
### 
In a no-decision debate with the
University of Southern California held
in Los Angeles last night, Stanley A.
Weigel and Fred Combellack, repre
senting Stanford, upheld the negative
of the question, "Resolved, That the
younger generation's freedom of
thought and action is detrimental to
society." Manuel Ruix and Stanley
Hopper of U.S.C. supported the af
firmative in the forensic contest.
Combellack, Cardinal negative
speaker, declared that the crime wave
is due to lax enforcement of law in
the courts in his argument. He said
that the evils of the younger genera
tion are greatly exaggerated because
the press plays them up and makes
them appear more serious than those
of past generations.
Weigle, second Stanford speaker,
held that the young people of today
are less dependent upon their elders
in an economic way, that their "pet
ting parties" and loose speech is
merely superficial, and that intellec
tual freedom is greater now than ever
before. He said that the younger gen
eration is really interested in religion
but not in creeds. According to Wei
gle, a more sincere religion is the re
sult of their indifference to denomina
tional lines.
Each team was allowed sixteen min
utes for rebuttal speeches after their
arguments. The subject for the debate
was chosen because of the recent ten
dency toward debating upon popular
questions. Weigle and Combellack will
return to the campus on Monday.
