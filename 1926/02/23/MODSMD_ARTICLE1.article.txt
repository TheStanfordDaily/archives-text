# CARDINALS LOSE TO REDWOOD NINE, WIN FROM SANTA CLARA
## SOBIESKI TWIRLS WELL Saturday Game Proves to Be Ragged Affair; Wolter's Men Improve Later 
### Herb Klein 
After dropping a loosely played
game to the unimpressive Redwood
City Police team on Saturday, the
Stanford varsity nine came out of its
early-season slump and trimmed Santa
Clara 5 to 1 yesterday, the improve
ment being largely through better
mound work.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
the team will play the Klawans and
McMullins team of San Francisco on
the varsity diamond. Reports from the
city indicate that the sporting goods
organization has a capable nine this
Beason.
Pitching practically airtight ball,
Count Sobieski held Santa Clara to
three hits and one run in the game
yesterday afternoon in which Harry
VVolter's men defeated Sam Agnew's
nine 5 to 1 and began to look like a
veal team. Sobieski struck out ten men
in his nine innings on the mound,
gave only three walks, and until the
ninth when he let down a little, al
lowed the Broncs but one hit.
Gottwals, on the mound for the Mis
sionites showed better work than he
had during his short period in the first
game with Santa Clara, played there!
last Wednesday. The Cards managed
to get seven hits and five runs from
him. None of the Stanford players
got more than one hit so the scoring
was distributed over the whole team.
Cards Score
VVolter's men got one hit in the
first inning but it was not until the
third that any runs came in. Then
Weaver advanced to first on a walk
and was brought in by Johnston. The
sixth and seventh innings each saw a
Card player cross the plate and two
runs in the eighth made Stanford's
victory one of superior slugging as
well as clever pitching.
In the sixth, Nissen came home on a
wild throw. Sobieski crossed the
plate in the seventh. Sypher, Busch,
and Cuddeback got hits. Sypher came
home on an error by the Bronc first
baseman who fumbled a drive by Gari
baldi. Cuddeback's hit brought Gari
j baldi in.
Sypher, behind the plate, did a good
day's catchnig. Busch showed ability
at shortstop. The entire team was bet
ter than it has been in either of the
two other games.
Broncs Confident
The Santa Clara men, who had come
close to winning the first game, were
confident that they would trim the
Cardinals this time. They played a
better brand of ball than they did on
their home diamond but were decisive
ly outclassed and, above all, out
pitched.
Playing a ragged game of ball, the
Cardinal varsity nine lost to the Red
wood City police by a 14 to 9 score ;
last Saturday afternoon. Harry Wol
ter's men jumped into the lead when
they brought in 6 runs in the second
inning, only to have the cops rally in
the fifth an dhit at the best Oviatt
could offer so successfully that they !
had tied at the end of the sixth with
8 all.
Oviatt became increasingly wild dur
ing the fifth and sixth. Philippi suc
ceeded him in the last part of the
seventh after five Redwood City play
ers had already crossed the plate.
Philippi held the policemen scoreless
in the eighth inning. Lovelace went
in as pinch hitter in the eighth in an
effort to stage a rally, but he was
struck out, as were Weaver and Dra
per, who followed.
Johnson Bats Well
Sobieski replaced Philippi in the 1
ninth. Stanford came to bat at the
small end of a 14 to 9 score. Johnston j
maintained his excellent batting aver- I
age and got a hit which took him to
first. Nissen put a fly right into the
mit of the left fielder. Sypher knocked
the ball into the selfsame fnit. Busch
drove a low one along third, was put
out by a speedy peg from the third
baseman to first and the game was
over.
Mediocre pitching and ineffective
hitting coupled with several costly
errors were responsible for the Card's
defeat by a team they should have j
beaten with little trouble. Johnston
led the batting again with three hits. !
Weaver and Busch were credited with
two apiece. Six errors were chalked
up against Stanford players. A few
wild throws served to aid the cops in
making several runs.

first inning but it was not until the
third that any runs came in. Then
Weaver advanced to first on a walk
and was brought in by Johnston. The
sixth and seventh innings each saw a
Card player cross the plate and two
runs in the eighth made Stanford's
victory one of superior slugging as
well as clever pitching.
In the sixth, Nissen came home on a
wild throw. Sobieski crossed the
plate in the seventh. Sypher, Busch,
and Cuddeback got hits. Sypher came
home on an error by the Bronc first
baseman who fumbled a drive by Gari
baldi. Cuddeback's hit brought Gari
j baldi in.
Sypher, behind the plate, did a good
day's catchnig. Busch showed ability
at shortstop. The entire team was bet
ter than it has been in either of the
two other games.
Broncs Confident
The Santa Clara men, who had come
close to winning the first game, were
confident that they would trim the
Cardinals this time. They played a
better brand of ball than they did on
their home diamond but were decisive
ly outclassed and, above all, out
pitched.
Playing a ragged game of ball, the
Cardinal varsity nine lost to the Red
wood City police by a 14 to 9 score ;
last Saturday afternoon. Harry Wol
ter's men jumped into the lead when
they brought in 6 runs in the second
inning, only to have the cops rally in
the fifth an dhit at the best Oviatt
could offer so successfully that they !
had tied at the end of the sixth with
8 all.
Oviatt became increasingly wild dur
ing the fifth and sixth. Philippi suc
ceeded him in the last part of the
seventh after five Redwood City play
ers had already crossed the plate.
Philippi held the policemen scoreless
in the eighth inning. Lovelace went
in as pinch hitter in the eighth in an
effort to stage a rally, but he was
struck out, as were Weaver and Dra
per, who followed.
Johnson Bats Well
Sobieski replaced Philippi in the 1
ninth. Stanford came to bat at the
small end of a 14 to 9 score. Johnston j
maintained his excellent batting aver- I
age and got a hit which took him to
first. Nissen put a fly right into the
mit of the left fielder. Sypher knocked
the ball into the selfsame fnit. Busch
drove a low one along third, was put
out by a speedy peg from the third
baseman to first and the game was
over.
Mediocre pitching and ineffective
hitting coupled with several costly
errors were responsible for the Card's
defeat by a team they should have j
beaten with little trouble. Johnston
led the batting again with three hits. !
Weaver and Busch were credited with
two apiece. Six errors were chalked
up against Stanford players. A few
wild throws served to aid the cops in
making several runs.

After dropping a loosely played
game to the unimpressive Redwood
City Police team on Saturday, the
Stanford varsity nine came out of its
early-season slump and trimmed Santa
Clara 5 to 1 yesterday, the improve
ment being largely through better
mound work.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
the team will play the Klawans and
McMullins team of San Francisco on
the varsity diamond. Reports from the
city indicate that the sporting goods
organization has a capable nine this
Beason.
Pitching practically airtight ball,
Count Sobieski held Santa Clara to
three hits and one run in the game
yesterday afternoon in which Harry
VVolter's men defeated Sam Agnew's
nine 5 to 1 and began to look like a
veal team. Sobieski struck out ten men
in his nine innings on the mound,
gave only three walks, and until the
ninth when he let down a little, al
lowed the Broncs but one hit.
Gottwals, on the mound for the Mis
sionites showed better work than he
had during his short period in the first
game with Santa Clara, played there!
last Wednesday. The Cards managed
to get seven hits and five runs from
him. None of the Stanford players
got more than one hit so the scoring
was distributed over the whole team.
