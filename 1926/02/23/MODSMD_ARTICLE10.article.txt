# EL TIGRE CAGE FIVE LOSES TO FAST KAPPA SIGS
## SCORE READS 17 TO 7 Intramural Title Goes to Row Quintet in Final Cage Play Friday 
### Clif Moore 
Kappa Sigma won the University
intramural basketball championship
by defeating El Tigre in the title con
test played Friday afternoon in the
pavilion. The winners displayed a de
cidedly superior style of basketball
and had little trouble annexing the
honors with a 17 to 7 score.
The first half was marked by effec
tive defensive play on the part of both
teams. Close guarding compelled the
players to attempt many quick shots
that usually fell wide of the basket.
Neither team exhibited any great
amount of teamwork in this period,
but relied mainly on long and follow
in shots.
Stevens made the first point for
Kappa Sigma by tossing in a free
throw after both teams had battled for
nearly five minutes without scoring.
Woodhead put El Tigre in the lead
with the first field goal of the game
when he made a pretty shot from the
sidelines. Soutbworth tied the count
at 2-all with a free throw.
Stevens Breaks Tie
The score remained unbroken for
several minutes with play centering
about the middle of the court. The
Kappa Sigs started an offensive rush
just before the period ended, and after
several unsuccessful tries at the goal,
the ball was tipped out to Stevens
