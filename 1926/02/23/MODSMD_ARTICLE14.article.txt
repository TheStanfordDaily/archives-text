# "GREEN GODDESS" PLAY CAST WORK PROGRESSING
## 
### Frank Baker 
Rehearsals for the English Club
play, "The Green Goddess," being pre
sented March 5 under the direction
of Gordon Davis, progressed rapidly
all last week, but Davis announces
that the major cast has gone as far
as it can without the remainder of the
characters. These include a great
many important roles, most of which
are speaking parts.
With the exception of one aviator,
the smaller parts are all spoken in
the native Hindustani dialect. A high
priest, minor priests, musicians, vil
lagers, soldiers, and black native run
ners make up the types yet to be
chosen. Tryouts will be tonight at 9
o'clock in the Assembly hall.
Davis is particularly anxious to get
competent men for these parts be
cause a great deal of the dramatic ef

feet of the play will depend on the
ease with which these parts are
played. The mob scenes promise to be
some of the most thrilling and spec
tacular ever witnessed by a campus
audience. Les Kiler is working on sets
and lighting effects that will enhance
the scenes and give them the needed
polish.
The minors, however, will not be
limited to mob work. Most of them
have individual parts and are inte
grated closely with the plot of the
play, which centers around a party of
aviators who are forced to land in the
heart of India. They are captured by
the sleek, cunning Rajah, who has
brought his European college culture
into the desolate interior country of
the Himalayas. Herein lies the strug
gle.
The "Green Goddess" herself is a
six-armed goddess worshipped by the
particular sect to which the Rajah be
longs, and the extent to which she is
mixed up in the plot may only be
compared to the importance various
other green-eyed vampires and sor
ceresses have had in mixing into man's
affairs. Although dominating his
blacks in ordinary affairs of sta-te the
Rajah bows to the supremacy of the
Green Goddess when it comes to the
question of the disposal of the Eng
lish party.
The leads in the cast are Helen
Lewis, Lloyd Nolan,. Jack Wiggin,
Garth Winslow, and Sam Hayes, all
of whom, with the exception of Sam
Hayes, have been seen before on the
campus stage. Hayes is making his
initial appearance.
In making up the following list of
men whom he wishes to try for the
Hindoo parts, Davis has selected those
of the original tryoutees that are best
suited to the native makeup. He de
sires to have these men out particu
larly, but others may also try if they
wish. Following is the list of men
