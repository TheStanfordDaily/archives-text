# RESERVE STRENGTH OF BRUINS CAUSES FRESHMAN DEFEAT
## Card Rally in Second Half Is Not Sufficient to Get Scoring Lead 
### Clif McDowell 
Superior reserve strength on the
part of the Blue and Gold freshmen
proved the undoing of the Cardinal
frosh in the second game of the Stan
ford-California freshman basketball
series, won by California, 35 to 22, in
Harmon Gymnasium, Berkeley, last
Friday night.
The Stanford frosh held their own
in the first part of the game, then
with the score 7 to 5 in favor of the
California cubs, Coach Clint Evans
sent in an entire new team. At the
end of the half the Bears were leading
16 to 9.
The second half of the game was
one of the most bitterly fought con
tests seen this season. Stanford put
on a wonderful rally in the final
period, but was fighting against a
fresh team that was again put in.
Paul Sexson, forward for the Stan
ford babes, played his best game of
the season. He was high-point man for
Stanford and was outstanding in his
passing, pivoting, and defensive play
ing. McCandless had hard luck on his
baskets, missing several easy shots
by inches. Lewis was playing above
form at running guard. He succeeded
in dropping two field goals and made
two foul throws during the game. He
played a fast defensive game. Robb
gave the cub forwards plenty of trou
ble on their close shots, keeping them
away from the basket and forcing
them to try long throws. Renzel played
a good passing game but was weak on
shooting.
Osmonson was put in during the
second half and shot two field goals in
as many minutes. Crary, who was put
in at the same time as Osmonson, had
to leave the court after five minutes
of play with a deep cut over his eye.
Gregory, running guard for the Cali
fornia frosh, took high-point honors
of the game, with a total of ten.
Wyatt, the diminutive forward, played
a great game, making six points and
worrying the Stanford defense con
siderably. Eisan was the star of the
second California team, leading this
substitute five both in scoring and
floor play.
Coach Husky Hunt substituted fre
quently in the second half, but did not
have the reserve strength to combat
the heavier California team.

in at the same time as Osmonson, had
to leave the court after five minutes
of play with a deep cut over his eye.
Gregory, running guard for the Cali
fornia frosh, took high-point honors
of the game, with a total of ten.
Wyatt, the diminutive forward, played

worrying the Stanford defense con
siderably. Eisan was the star of the
second California team, leading this
substitute five both in scoring and
floor play.
Coach Husky Hunt substituted fre
quently in the second half, but did not
have the reserve strength to combat
the heavier California team.
The lineups:
Stanford — California —
Renzel F Dougery (4)
Sexson (7) F Wyatt (6)
McCandless (6) C Corbin (3)
Lewis (4) G Gregory (10)
Robb (1) G Clymer
Substitutes: Stanford —Sibbett, Os
monson (4), Davis, Marks, Worden,

Superior reserve strength on the
part of the Blue and Gold freshmen
proved the undoing of the Cardinal
frosh in the second game of the Stan
ford-California freshman basketball
series, won by California, 35 to 22, in
Harmon Gymnasium, Berkeley, last
Friday night.
The Stanford frosh held their own
in the first part of the game, then
with the score 7 to 5 in favor of the
California cubs, Coach Clint Evans
sent in an entire new team. At the
end of the half the Bears were leading
16 to 9.
The second half of the game was
one of the most bitterly fought con
tests seen this season. Stanford put
on a wonderful rally in the final
period, but was fighting against a
fresh team that was again put in.
Paul Sexson, forward for the Stan
ford babes, played his best game of
the season. He was high-point man for
Stanford and was outstanding in his
passing, pivoting, and defensive play
ing. McCandless had hard luck on his
baskets, missing several easy shots
by inches. Lewis was playing above
form at running guard. He succeeded
in dropping two field goals and made
two foul throws during the game. He
played a fast defensive game. Robb
gave the cub forwards plenty of trou
ble on their close shots, keeping them
away from the basket and forcing
them to try long throws. Renzel played
a good passing game but was weak on
shooting.
Osmonson was put in during the
second half and shot two field goals in
as many minutes. Crary, who was put
in at the same time as Osmonson, had
to leave the court after five minutes
of play with a deep cut over his eye.
Gregory, running guard for the Cali
fornia frosh, took high-point honors
of the game, with a total of ten.

siderably. Eisan was the star of the
