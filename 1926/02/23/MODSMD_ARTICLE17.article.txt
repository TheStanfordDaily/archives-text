# CARD WATER POLO TEAMS DEFEAT U. C. IN DECISIVE STYLE
## Ernst Brandsten Gets New Laurels by Repeating Double Victory 
### 
The Cardinals scored a double tri
umph over the Blue and Gold in
Encina Pool last Saturday afternoon
when both freshman and varsity water
polo teams won their games from Cali
fornia by decisive scores. The varsity,
winning 7 to 1, proved greatly super
ior to its opponents, while the babes
easily piled up 13 points without al
lowing any score against them.
Ernst Brandsten's capable coaching
and the superior condition of the Stan
ford players were responsible for the
double victory. At no time was the
result of either game in doubt. In the
last half of the varsity game the
Berkeley men held the score to one
all, but Brandsten's men had already
piled up a lead of 6 to 0 in the first
half so were not obliged* to extend
themselves.
Allen Aces
Arden Allen, captain, playing his
last game against California, was the
outstanding star of the varsity squad.
He was in top condition and twice
dribbled the ball the length of the
tank through the entire Blue and Gold
team, and scored with powerful
straight-arm shots.
Johnny Mack was high-point man
among the forwards with three tallies
in the first half. Art Stewart, another
forward, got in two shots in the first
period, one a difficult backhand. Ac
tual scoring was confined to these
three: Mack, Stewart, and Allen. Van
den Akker, the third forward, was
active and on the go, but was unable
to make his shots register, although
he had several openings.
