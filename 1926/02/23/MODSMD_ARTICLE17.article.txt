# CARD WATER POLO TEAMS DEFEAT U. C. IN DECISIVE STYLE
## Ernst Brandsten Gets New Laurels by Repeating Double Victory 
### 
The Cardinals scored a double tri
umph over the Blue and Gold in
Encina Pool last Saturday afternoon
when both freshman and varsity water
polo teams won their games from Cali
fornia by decisive scores. The varsity,
winning 7 to 1, proved greatly super
ior to its opponents, while the babes
easily piled up 13 points without al
lowing any score against them.
Ernst Brandsten's capable coaching
and the superior condition of the Stan
ford players were responsible for the
double victory. At no time was the
result of either game in doubt. In the
last half of the varsity game the
Berkeley men held the score to one
all, but Brandsten's men had already
piled up a lead of 6 to 0 in the first
half so were not obliged* to extend
themselves.
Allen Aces
Arden Allen, captain, playing his
last game against California, was the
outstanding star of the varsity squad.
He was in top condition and twice
dribbled the ball the length of the
tank through the entire Blue and Gold
team, and scored with powerful
straight-arm shots.
Johnny Mack was high-point man
among the forwards with three tallies
in the first half. Art Stewart, another
forward, got in two shots in the first
period, one a difficult backhand. Ac
tual scoring was confined to these
three: Mack, Stewart, and Allen. Van
den Akker, the third forward, was
active and on the go, but was unable
to make his shots register, although
he had several openings.
U. C. Wins Sprint
During the first half the speedy
California sprint man had the wall
to shove off against so van den Akker
was unable to get to the ball first.
On the first play Stanford backs got
the ball and worked it up to the for
wards. Mack tried a shot but it went
over the goal, putting the ball in
LJ.C.'s possession. The Berkeley for
wards missed a shot and an attempted
bat-in, after which Van den Akker re
ceived the ball and started to dribble
down. He fumbled the ball once but
retrieved it, but his shot at the goal
landed squarely in the goal guard's
hands. A few seconds later Stewart
scored on a pass from Van den Akker.
The second goal came after Califor
nia had tried a four-man through play
which Stanford backs broke up. Four
Cardinal players in succession failed
in attempts to put the ball through
the frame. On the fifth try Mack was
successful with a tricky backhand
shot.
Gilson, a clever California forward,
threatened on a later play, but his
shot went over. Art Stewart received
the ball on a pass and put in a back
hand from an angle. A speedy toss
from Allen to Mack and into the goal
made the sixth and last point of the
first half.
Substitutes Held
In the second half Brandsten put
in Brooks, Maltby, and Hinkle. The
new combination was held by the
Berkeley players who tightened up
their game perceptibly. Brooks, swim
ming as sprint, got the ball for Stan
ford, but Van den Akker missed his
try and California got the ball up to
Casteozzo, a forward, who scored a
difficult shot.
From then on neither side was able
to make a point for some time, al
though van den Akker, Brooks, and
though Van den Akker, Brooks, and
scored.
1929 Wins Easily
The first-year men were able to
score almost at will and were pre
vented from rolling up a bigger figure
only by the lack of time. Five out of
the six players put the ball through
the Cal net from one to to five times
apiece. Cal Strong, forward, made five
tallies, Captain Tom Thurlow three.
Bob Burns and Truman Parker two,
and Lewis Hunter one.
Interest in aquatics now shifts to
the California swimming meet which
will be held on Saturday, March 5, in
the pool of the Athens Club of Oak
land.
