# POWERFUL OFFENSE GIVES BRUINS WIN OVER KERR'S TEAM
## U. C. WILL MEET OREGON Shipkey Ties With Higgins For Scoring Honors in Last Cal Game 
### Clif McDowell 
A powerful attack that was able to
penetrate the Stanford defense, com
bined with brilliant defensive playing
that kept the Cardinals away from the
Blue and Gold basket, enabled the
California varsity to win the second
game of the basketball series 24 to 1G
in the Oakland Auditorium last Satur
day night. This victory clinched the
series for the Bears, and gives them
the right to play the University of
Oregon for the championship of the
Pacific Coast Conference.
Notwithstanding the score, the game
was close throughout, and the Cardi
nal varsity was in the running until
the final minutes of the game. Ted
Shipkey proved to be the star of the
Cardinal quintet, sinking four foul
shots in the early part of the game,
that gave Stanford a four-point lead
that California was unable to break
until the first half was almost over.
Later Shipkey sank two more foul
shots and a field goal, tying with Bill
Higgins of the Bruin varsity for scor
ing honors.

Coach Andy Kerr kept Price, Clark,
and Vincenti on the bench until Cali
fornia had tied the score at four-all,
when he sent these men into the
game. Stanford was able to hold the
Bears even in the greater part of the
first half, Butts sinking a field goal
just before the gun to give California
a two-point lead at half time. In the
second half California steadily in
creased its lead, playing a wonderful
passing game that got past the Cardi
nal defense for close-in shots. Stan
ford was unable to get past the Cali
fornia defensive line in the second
half, and long shots, two by Nelson
David and one by Moco Newhouse,
kept the Cardinals in the running. The
field goal by Newhouse in this half
was the prettiest shot of the game,
starting from a point in the center of
the court and dropping cleanly through
the basket.
Milton Butts, substituting for Cap
tain Benny Holmes of the California
varsity, who was put on the sick list
several days ago and was unable to
be in uniform, ran with Higgins in
leading the Blue and Gold attack.
Butts was the hero of the last Stan
ford-California game, sinking the win
ning shot, and proved to be an able
substitute for Captain Holmes, fitting
in well with the California team and
scoring seven of the Bears' points.
Neither Captain Fred Price nor Bill
Clark were able to hit the basket
when they got into the game, and
both were forced to go scoreless
throughout the contest. Both men
missed several close shots by hard
luck. Steele also went scoreless, miss
ing several field goals and failing to
sink any of his three foul shots.
