# POWERFUL OFFENSE GIVES BRUINS WIN OVER KERR'S TEAM

### Clif McDowell 
A powerful attack that was able to
penetrate the Stanford defense, com

that kept the Cardinals away from the
Blue and Gold basket, enabled the
California varsity to win the second
game of the basketball series 24 to 1G
in the Oakland Auditorium last Satur
day night. This victory clinched the
series for the Bears, and gives them
the right to play the University of
Oregon for the championship of the
Pacific Coast Conference.
Notwithstanding the score, the game
was close throughout, and the Cardi

the final minutes of the game. Ted
Shipkey proved to be the star of the
Cardinal quintet, sinking four foul
shots in the early part of the game,

that California was unable to break
until the first half was almost over.
Later Shipkey sank two more foul
shots and a field goal, tying with Bill
Higgins of the Bruin varsity for scor
ing honors.
