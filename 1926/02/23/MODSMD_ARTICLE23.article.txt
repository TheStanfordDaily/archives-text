A knockout blow was delivered to the practice of beating rides on
the local electric tram when last week the motormen were deputized, and
instructed to take into custody, any person receiving free transportation.

misdoers, besides robbing the railway out of hundreds of fares, have
been engaging in a dangerous pastime. Despite the general supposition
that the car does not attain a sufficiently high speed to be perilous, in the
past few weeks two youths have been injured when they have slipped
from the moving vehicles.
