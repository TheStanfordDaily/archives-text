C. C. Puller, who
missionary work in So i
the past twenty-three ye.
returned to Canada, and iÂ«
view at McGill University g. sev
eral interesting facts regarding edu
cational facilities there, particularly,
in Southern Rhodesia.
There are two distinct classes of
schools in Southern Rhodesia. First
are the schools for white children.
There are only 36,000 whites alto
gether, about 7,000 of whom are chil
dren. The high school students are
cared for in four high schools, situ
ated at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umta'l,
and Plumtree. In the rural districts,
the government grants money to
schools even when there are but three
pupils. These small schools are called
"Governess" schools.
The other class of schools is that
for natives. When Fuller went to
Southern Rhodesia in 1902 there were
three of these schools with an enroll
ment of 400 and an annual grant of
$800 from the government. Today
there are 75,000 pupils attending more
than 1200 native schools which re
ceive a yearly grant of $125,000 from
the department of education. These
schools are under the direct supervi
sion of native teachers who are
trained in the normal training schools
of Natal and ('ape Province. Natives
who desire a college education may
attend the South African Native Col
lege at Fort Hare in Cape Province,
This institution is supported by the
government and by contributions from
the native chiefs. There is also a fine
medical school there, but it is open

only to college graduates.
White students attend college most
ly at Cope University at Cape Town,
though there are large colleges in
other of the more important centers,
including one at Johannesburg. How
ever. these are all affiliated with Capo
University.
