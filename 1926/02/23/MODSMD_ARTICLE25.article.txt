# COLLEGE HEAD RAPS PRESENT SYSTEM OF TEACHING SCIENCES
## 
### 
Under the qr stioning sub-head,
"Must Science Go the Way of the
Classics?" President Butler of Colum
a University questions the value, to
the people as a whole, or scientific
study as it now exists. In his annual
report he concludes that shortsighted
teaching methods seem likely to cause
the sciences to follow the classics
down from the heights of undergradu
{te popularity.
He thinks that the instructors of
he sciences tend to teach the subjects
only for those whose ambition it is to
become physicians, chemists, or biolo
gists and who are willing "to devote
their time and energy to that end."
For such students "the methods now
in vogue in the colleges and universi
ties are excellent.
"If, however, one wishes to know,"
Dr. Butler argues, "what physics,
chemistry, and biology are about, how
they came into existence, what has
been their history, who have contri
buted in most important fashion to
their advance, how they are related to
each other and to other branches of
knowledge, and what is the signifi
cance of their present conclusions and
applications, then he will find it very
difficult to get guidance or help from
any teacher of physics, of chemistry,
or of biology.
