# SPORTS OF 1926

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Bill Tilden would a-wooing go, whether his tennis
would let him or no." This time the versatile Bill essayed
to woo the drama, with the result that his show, "Don Q,
Jr., "rested" after a run of a week and a half on Broadway.
The critics did not look kindly on Bill's attempts as a
Thespian, and advised him to stick to foot-faults rather
than footlights. I quote a few of the criticisms from
various New York daily papers:
"William T. Tilden, 2nd, is pretty bad. He is cast in
a minor role and subjected for publicity purposes to undue
attention Mr. Tilden goes in quite a bit for shy
eccentricity on the stage and so rolls his eyes and writhes
his lower jaw as to suggest that shortly before the birth
of his dramatic ambitions he was badly frightened by-
Alfred Lunt in 'Clarence.' .... They (the net stars in the
audience) found it agreeable to see Mr. Tilden do anything

imperfectly."—Alexander Woolcott in the "World."
"Tilden keeps amateur standing in 'Don Q. Jr." —R. W. Jr. in "Herald
Tribune."
"The Big Bill Tilden of laAvn tennis is the Willie Tilden of the stage."—
George Daley. "World."
—"He (Tilden) was easy to beat last night. He had no change of pace,
his strategy was that of his inferiors, and he took no advantage ot! his open
ings. 'Don Q. Jr.,' is, though, a plav at which Vincent Richards will have a
good time." —Arthur Pollock, Brooklyn "Eagle."
"He (Tilden) did very well for an amateur .... but he brought nothing
to the performance—except his tenuis reputation—to justify his name in
the lights."—K. A. L., "Graphic."
"Big Bill," unless the footlights have hurt his eyes too much, will play
on the American team which meets LaCoete and Borotra in the international
team matches beginning Thursday. To paraphrase Shakespeare, "Is this a
racket that I see before me, its handle towards my hand?"
(Yes, please clutch it, and leave the stage alone! Wherefore art thou
an Actor, Billio?)
