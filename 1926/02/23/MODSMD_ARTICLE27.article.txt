AFTER THE BATTLE
Now that rushing is over perhaps
the freshman women can enjoy them
selves for at least a short time.

How would it be for some enter
prising young man to start a second
hand flower stand on the Row after
the next women's rushing week?

We trust that the fraternities un
fortunate enough to live next to soror

THE RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO
By Letitia Lemon
Episode VI
The Face at the Window
As Maurathea and I walked across
the floor to meet my escort, I recog- 1
nized at once that it was John Smith.
"Letitia," said my roommate, "I
want you to meet . . . . "
I interrupted her (foolishly enough; I
for I might have learned his real name I
had T allowed Maurathea to introduce i
us properly).
"I know Mr. Smith," I said, giving!
him my hand.
Maurathea looked at me surprised 1
for a moment and John Smith's face '
assumed an inexplicably blank expres- i
sion. Then they both smiled at me (I
did not notice that they scowled at |
each other) and Maurathea quickly
excused herself to meet her escort.
(Although he did not appear until ten
minutes later). e
Presently the music began and once
more I circled around the floor in the
arms of the man whose name I did
not know. My first concern was to ask
him if he had been hurt in "that hor
rid mud fight." He did not reply to
my question. In fact he seemed rather
angry for a few minutes, at my ques
tion.
Presently T saw something that
chilled the very blood in my veins.
It was at one of the windows opposite
the kitchen. I saw an apparition,
a ghost, a barbarous visage barely dis
tinguishable by the dull reflected light
from the ballroom floor. The new
moon played on two tnwny gray
shoulders. As we came closer to it,
the apparition moved from side to
side and placed its lurid face near the
window pane. A tenseness came over
me. I suppressed a scream, shuddered,
and fell to the floor unconscious.

philosopher, says—
Many are the lovely roses that bloom I

unseen in the retreats of Roble, un
able to venture abroad because they
lack the protection of the proverbial
thorn.

The students who wail that they
never had a chance are chiefly those
who didn't recognize a chance when
they saw one.

It's easy to distinguish a senior from
a junior. The seniors have worn their
cords a year longer uncleaned.
