## 
### 
Inability to shoot cost the Stanford
145-pound team its second game 19 to
1!} and lost the scries to California
in the preliminary to the varsity game
at the Oakland Auditorium last Satur
day night.
Stanford was given innumerable
chances to score, but was unable to
sink the ball for goals. Neither team
was strong defensively and shots were
frequent.
Werner, captain of the California
team, and Lerer, center for the Bears,
divided what honors there were for
high-point scoring, with five points
each. Levin, running guard for the
winners, was the star of the Blue
and Cold team. However, it was his
passing and running the ball down the
court that enables the California for
wards to get their close shots.
California led 10 to 3 at half time,
all three of Stanford's points coming
from foul shots, two by Newcomb and
one by Ankele. Sanders, substitute
center, made the highest individual
score for the Cards with four points,
one fiojd goal and two foul shots. He
missed several other shots that rolled
around the hoop and fell outside.
California used their entire squad
of eleven men during the game. Tofa
nelli and Werner led the second team
in scoring in the second half with
four and five points respectively.
Leith, substitute for the Bear light
weights, played well at centcr until
he was forced from the game with a
turned ankle.
