# PEDRO LEMOS, ART DIRECTOR OF QUAD, FINISHES PICTURES
## 
### 
Pedro Lemos, art director of the
Quad, has completed his work one
month ahead of time, having handed
in three sets of Stanford views in
each of which there are six pictures.
The most important set is a group of
oil paintings. Lemos has succeeded in
finding interesting new angles in all
of his views.
Art critics of the peninsula and San
Francisco consider these to be among
the finest of recent paintings of the
Stanford campus. One of the paintings
in this set is a detailed reproduction
of the front of the Memorial Church
as seen through the Memorial arch.
Lemos was aided in this by the origi
nals of the mosaic work, made in
Italy, and which are in his care in
the museum. This group will be repro
duced in the Quad through the use of
four-color process engraving.
The second series is a collection of
woodblocks of the Inner Quad, which
will be reproduced in three colors.
This set will form part of the intro
ductory section. The third set is a
group of photographs, all original and
quite artistic.
The borders of the Quad will go to
press early in March. All the senior
pictures and records have been turned
in, and the text of the volume will be
sent to the printers in the latter part
of March. The plates for the Lemos
pictures will cost a thousand dollars.
The aggregate cost of the book last
year was $27,890 i It is expected to
run several hundred dollars over that
this year. This sum is largely ex
pended in printing, engraving, art
work, and salaries of the staff.
