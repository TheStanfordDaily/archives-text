# BIOLOGY RESEARCH MADE BY SLONAKER DURING RECENT TRIP
## 
### 
An investigation of biological research
as carried on in the universities of the
east, was made by Dr. James R. Slonaker,
Associate Professor of Physiology, during
a recent tour of that section of the coun
try. Dr. Slonaker was especially inter
ested in the medical line.
He also studied the various depart
mental library systems, the methods em
ployed in handling supplies, and the means
used in the care and disposition of micro
scopes. He visited over twenty large uni
versities and medical colleges, gave five
lectures, and attended the annual meeting
of the American Physiological Society.
He found research being carried on very
actively in practically all universities,
this being done particularly by the
younger men. He met with only two uni
versities laving a definite means of car
ing for microscopes. In some places he
found that supplies for the three biological
departments, botany, physiology, and zo
ology, are taken care of by one central
storeroom. A very few had the central
ized library system by which the refer
ence books for all three departments are
kept in one place and facilitate the work
of students who find these studies over
lapping each other.
