### 
Applications for information con
cerning the summer session show a
considerable increase this year over
the number of inquiries received at
this time last year, according to Direc
tor John A. Sellards. The applicants
this year are widely distributed over
the country, and are composed largely
of undergraduates in other colleges
and universities.
The faculty of the summer session
will include members of the regular
teaching staff and visiting professors
and instructors from various American
and European universities.
In addition to the regular bulletin
of information and announcement of
courses, Director Sellard has prepared
a folder with pictures and descriptions
of scenes on the campus and nearby
points of interest. Students desiring
these folders may obtain them at the
summer quarter office in Room 73 of
the Administration building.
