# BODY OF PALO ALTO AUTO MECHANICIAN FOUND ON CAMPUS
## Death Result of Drowning in Gully Near Frenchman's Dam, Believed 
### 
The body of Edward Berg, Palo Alto
automobile mechanic, was found Sun
day in a water-filled gully near French
man's Dam by two residents of May
field, Marion Freedman and Robert
Nelson. Death evidently resulted from
drowning as there was no evidence
of foul play.
Berg had apparently been dead
since Thursday. Early .on Thursday
afternoon he left his home at 155 Palo
Alto avenue, telling his wife that he
was on his way to San Francisco to
look for employment there. His wife
heard nothing further of him until
George W. Tinney, local undertaker,
notified her of the discovery of the
body.
The dead man, who was 43 years old,
was a former employe of the Ford
automobile agency in Palo Alto. Com
ing to California from Michigan six
years ago, he lived in San Jose for a
time. He is survived by his widow,
Mrs. Gertrude Berg; one son, Alan,
who is employed at the Ford garage
in Mayfield; and two brothers, Paul
and Charles Berg.
An inquest was held today and fun
eral services will be conducted to
morrow.
