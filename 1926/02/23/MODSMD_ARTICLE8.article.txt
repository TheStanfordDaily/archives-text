# REDSHIRT 130'S DROP NIP AND TUCK GAME ON BERKELEY COURT
## 
### 
After leading 8 to 6 at the half, the
Stanford 130-pound basketball team
lost to the California 130's 13 to 12, in
the preliminary to the freshman game
at Harmon Gymnasium last Friday
night. The Cardinal light-weight team
was given plenty of chances at the
basket in the last few minutes of the
game, but was unable to overcome the
one-point lead of the California team.
Thomas, Stanford forward, was the
outstanding star of the game, tying
with Weidenbaum of California for
high-point honor, and leading the
Stanford offense throughout the game.
Both teams were weak on defense and
erratic in shooting. Either team could
have won the game easily with con
sistent shooting, as both teams made
numerous shots at the basket.
Bipp, substitute forward for Cali
fornia, raced from one end of the court
to the other with little difficulty, but
was unable to hit the hoop. His floor
work was remarkable throughout the
entire game, surpassing that of any
of the California regulars.
The lineups:
Stanford — California —
Thomas (6) F Blum
Casad F Weidenbaum (6)
Ray (4) C Rasmusen (5)
