# BAD CONDITIONS IN EUROPE DROUGHT By TARIFF, CLARK
## LECTURE IS ILLUSTRATED Central European Countries Worse Off Economically Than Before War 
### 
"From an economic standpoint coun
tries of Central Europe are much
worse off than they were before the
war," declared Dr. Charles Upson
Clark in his illustrated lecture given
last night in the Assembly hall. Dr.
Clark, who is principal of the Massa
wippi Summer School at North Hately,
Quebec, has recently returned from a
European trip.
Dr. Clark explained that economic
distress in the Central European coun
tries may be attributed in part to the
â€¢existing high protective tariffs of each
country. Before the war free trade
existed between Germany and Austria-
Hungary. With the closing of the war
and the establishment of new boun
daries, each country such as the pres
ent Germany, Hungary, Austria, Po
land, and the new states such as
Czecho-Slovakia and new Roumania,
protective tariffs have been adopted
by each, making commodities more ex
pensive, forcing prices higher, and
causing a general slackening of trade
relationships.
The war also brought about in
creased embitterment among the vari
ous countries, slowing up trade rela
tions as well as diplomatic relations.
"Intolerance is at the bottom of
most difficulties in Central Europe.
Not only are the people of various na
tions not in sympathy with each other
but intolerance exists within each
country. Religious and race privileges
cause much of the difficulty," said Dr.
Clark.
In speaking of business conditions
in individual countries, Dr. Clark
pointed out that Germany has about
a million men out of work at the pres
ent time, money is tight, and prices
are high. Austria is in a bad financial
situation because her manufacturing
industries and rural industries were
separated following the war when the
part of that country possessing the
manufacturing industries was left to
Czecho-Slovakia.
Hungary is in good shape from a
business point of view because her
rural population is capable of produc
ing enough raw products to sustain
the manufacturing industries. Although
Poland is somewhat depressed condi
tions are better there now than a few
months ago.
Business is comparatively profitable
in Czecho-Slovakia which now has a
stabilized currency. Czecho-Slovakia is
one of the most progressive nations
and is endeavoring to bring about
treaties for free trade among the vari
ous central states of Europe.
Jugo-Slavia will become one of the
most important business states of Eu
rope, if it weathers the present politi
cal difficulties successfully. It has
enormous natural resources. Rouma
nia is in a fairly good condition, and
Albania is in a peaceful situation for
the present, but Bulgaria is in a poor
condition.
Dr. Clark illustrated his lecture with
slides showing pictures of various old
castles and buildings in several cities
in Central Europe. Pictures of the
natives and scenery in several coun
tries were also thrown on the screen.
