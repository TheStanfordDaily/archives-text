# CARDINAL MERMEN COMPETE AT ELKS CLUB POOL TONIGHT
## 
### 
Cardinal swimmers will compete in
the aquatic meet being held tonight
at the Elks Club pool in San Fran
cisco, and hope to take first honors
in two Pacific Association junior
championship swimming events. Stan
ford will be represented in the 200-
yard junior relay by a four-man team
picked from Art Stewart, Congo Carl
smith, Bill Danford, Phil Brooks, and
Dutch Fletcher. Men who have previ
ously won either junior or senior free
style swimming championships are not
eligible to compete in the relay race
so Ernst Brandsten has not been able
to pick for his team some of the fast
est men on the swimming squad who
have already taken P.A.A. titles.
The Olympic Club is entering a re
lay team, as is the Elks Club. The
Elks are conceded the best chance to
win the event, but they will have to
turn in some good times to defeat the
Cardinal four.
Stanford in P.A.
Stanford is represented in the jun
ior P.A. 220-yard freestyle champion
ship by Ted Smith, Bill Danford, and
Phil Brooks. Joe Aleck, the Elks Club
hope, is reported as having made 2:35
for the freestyle furlong but will have
plenty of competition. Danford, swim
ming the 220 in his first trials under
time has made 2:39 with every pros
pect of taking four or five seconds off
this figure when he gets the pace. Ted
Smith has made around 2:40 and
should do much better under competi
tion. Brooks has gone under 2:40 so
the race should be a sprint from start
to finish.
Fortunately, the schedule of events
places the relay race before the 220.
If Danford or Brooks should win the
220 they would automatically become
ineligible for the relay which follows,
having become P.A. champions.
Cal-Stanford Meet
The date of the California-Stanford
swimming meet has been set for Fri
day, March 5. The meet will be held
in the new pool of the Athens Club
of Oakland at 8 o'clock in the evening.
The Athens Club pool will be familiar
territory for the Berkeley swimmers
since they do all their training there.
Members of the swimming team are
working out daily in Encina pool un
der Ernst Brandsten's coaching, and
are getting into excellent shape. Sev
eral California-Stanford records seem
doomed to fall this time. The relay
team has several times gone under
the previous mark in practice and
backstroke and 220-yard freestyle are
likely to be made in new low times.

lay team, as is the Elks Club. The
Elks are conceded the best chance to
win the event, but they will have to
turn in some good times to defeat the
Cardinal four.
Stanford in P.A.
Stanford is represented in the jun
ior P.A. 220-yard freestyle champion
ship by Ted Smith, Bill Danford, and
Phil Brooks. Joe Aleck, the Elks Club
hope, is reported as having made 2:35
for the freestyle furlong but will have
plenty of competition. Danford, swim
ming the 220 in his first trials under
time has made 2:39 with every pros
pect of taking four or five seconds off
this figure when he gets the pace. Ted
Smith has made around 2:40 and
should do much better under competi
tion. Brooks has gone under 2:40 so
the race should be a sprint from start
to finish.
Fortunately, the schedule of events
places the relay race before the 220.
If Danford or Brooks should win the
220 they would automatically become
ineligible for the relay which follows,
having become P.A. champions.
Cal-Stanford Meet
The date of the California-Stanford
swimming meet has been set for Fri
day, March 5. The meet will be held
in the new pool of the Athens Club
of Oakland at 8 o'clock in the evening.
The Athens Club pool will be familiar
territory for the Berkeley swimmers
since they do all their training there.
Members of the swimming team are
working out daily in Encina pool un
der Ernst Brandsten's coaching, and
are getting into excellent shape. Sev
eral California-Stanford records seem
doomed to fall this time. The relay
team has several times gone under
the previous mark in practice and
backstroke and 220-yard freestyle are
likely to be made in new low times.
Cardinal swimmers will compete in
the aquatic meet being held tonight
at the Elks Club pool in San Fran
cisco, and hope to take first honors
in two Pacific Association junior
championship swimming events. Stan
ford will be represented in the 200-
yard junior relay by a four-man team
picked from Art Stewart, Congo Carl
smith, Bill Danford, Phil Brooks, and
Dutch Fletcher. Men who have previ
ously won either junior or senior free
style swimming championships are not
eligible to compete in the relay race
so Ernst Brandsten has not been able
to pick for his team some of the fast
est men on the swimming squad who
have already taken P.A.A. titles.
The Olympic Club is entering a re
lay team, as is the Elks Club. The
Elks are conceded the best chance to
win the event, but they will have to
turn in some good times to defeat the
Cardinal four.
