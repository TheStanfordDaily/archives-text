As a concession to the many
contributors to Chaparral, the
deathline has been thrown out
so that it extends over till to
morrow at high noon, after which
time the laughing sun will burst
into loud guffaws at any copy re
ceived.
The Old Boy is beeswaxing
humorous over our foreign folk
in the next number, thinking that
as the old saying goes about the
unfamiliar being most laughed at,
he can get out h lot easier by
making punß at something the
rest of the college cut-ups don't
know anything about, either.
If any freshman, or other prank
ish classman, gets a bright idea
during the night, he can write it
up and slip it on the desk in the
morning. No questions will be
asked, and no explanation's re
quired.
