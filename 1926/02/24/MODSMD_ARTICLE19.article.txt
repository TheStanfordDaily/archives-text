# WOMEN'S CONFERENCE PASSES POINT SYSTEM FOR ADOPTION
## Regulation of Activities of Women Will Be Given Three Years' Trial 
### 
The point system for the regulation
of women's activities, after having
j been slightly revised, has received the
] approval of Women's Conference with
J the recommendation that, if adopted,
the system be given three years' trial.
During that time the system may be
adjusted to meet changing needs.
It is felt by the committee that at
the end of three years the weaknesses
as well as the good features will be
apparent, and the system may be
either abolished or made a permanent
institution.
The plan is not to be considered as
a hard and fast ruling at any time.
A leniency clause provides for special
! cases. New activities will be evaluated
I when the need arises.
Vote Tuesday
Polls for voting on the point system
'will be open next Tuesday from 8:45
j to 2 o'clock, in front of the Women's
! Clubhouse. Before voting the women
are urged to study the plan carefully,
' noting its changes and taking into ac
| count the fact that the system will be
only on trial during the first three
years.
The revised grouping raises the of
fice of the president of Roble Club
from Group 111 to Group 11, the posi
tion of Daily Palo Alto staff members
I from Group IV to Group 111, and the
| office of president of Panhellenic from
