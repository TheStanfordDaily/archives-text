# The 						Point System
## 
### 
The women's point system committee is now presenting its final re
drafted plan. An election for the plan's acceptance or rejection will be
held Tuesday, and if the expectations of the women who devised the
scheme are fulfilled it will go into effect for a three-year trial. When the
period of probation is ended a definite decision will be made as to its worth.
The committee has armed the system with a few weapons designed to
carry it over its three-year trial. Provisions have been incorporated for
the judging of new activities and old activities may be re judged.
From the beginning the DAILY has urged the women to study the sub
stance of the plan carefully. It now asks them to consider the plan with
the idea in mind that the tendency at Stanford is to give the individual a
free-hand. There is the possibility that personal limitations will defeat
this ideal.
It is sufficient to say that arguments con probably weigh heavier than
arguments pro; but with the provided checks the plan may work out with
.out being too great a hardship. Point systems elsewhere have been known
to function efficiently, and they have been known to fail. Their success
is dependent largely upon the conditions with which they are compelled
to work.
