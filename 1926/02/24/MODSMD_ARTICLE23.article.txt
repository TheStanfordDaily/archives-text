Two organizations started today on finance campaigns in an effort to
enlist campus support for the coming year. The Y.W.C.A. and the
Y.M.C.A., each with a personnel representative of every group in the Uni
versity, began their annual drives with a combined sum of $3600 as their
goal.
It has never been the purpose of either organization to "dun" its mem
bers or other students by placing upon them an obligation to subscribe in
its annual drive. Rather, the two have hoped that the student-body would
follow a self-imposed obligation and cheerfully contribute to a cause it
thought worthy.
This year stress is to be laid on the work of the two groups in the ex
pectation that contributions will come with a better understanding of pur
poses. During the war, inestimable aid was given the government and its
army and navy; but with the advent of peace, a majority of the resources
and energies of the two have been thrown into student work over the
country. Chief among the aims stands the desire to co-operate with for
eign students and for this purpose the Student Friendship Fund has been
established. Over a fourth of the amount set for the Stanford goal will
be used in this direction.
Local work of conferences, dinners, talks, and vocational guidance oc
cupies a great part of the time of the campus divisions.
TODAY THE DRAMATIC COUNCIL turned over to the Univer
sity a check for $5OO as the second payment on a $2OOO loan which was
taken out at the beginning of the college year. The first payment, cover
ing one-half of the debt was made at the end of the autumn quarter.
The prompt handling of this loan speaks well for the work of the
Council and its manager, Paul Bissinger. Plays have been staged at more
frequent intervals than in the past; and yet the increased patronage testi
fies that the quantity has not affected the quality.
