Rhythm in Sports

Many words have been written about the value of
rhythm in sports. And the two leading exponents of
smooth, flawless action are Bobby Jones, the amateur golf
champion, and Walter Johnson, one of the greatest pitchers
who ever threw a baseball.
It is taken for granted nowadays that you cannot be
a great golfer until you acquire a good rhythmic swing.
Bobby Jones has that and more —his backswing, down
stroke, and follow through are one continuous, flowing
motion, as smooth as the poetry of Keats or Shelley. It
is so well "grooved" that after seven or eight years of
tournament play Jones' swing is held up as an example for
all golfers to follow —he is the stylist par excellence of the
pastime.
Glenna Collett is another golfer with a marvelously

smooth swing. Comparing the duffer's stroke with that of
Bobby or Glenna is like comparing a cubist painting with Botticelli's "Spring,"
or a Mansard house with the Parthenon.
Ihe reason that Walter Johnson has been able to pitch for nineteen
consecutive years is that he works, with more rhythm than any other pitcher.
"Big Barney" wastes no effort at all, and his smooth action not only helps
save his arm, but actually adds speed to his pitches.
Among the numerous stars whose work in the field of athletics is
especially marked with that "poetry of motion" and grace that is so to be
desired are Johnny Weismuller and Sybil Bauer in swimming, Nurmi, Ray,
and Scholz in running; Tilden and Lenglen in tennis; Sisler and Hornsby in
baseball (but even they can't compare with Chase and Lajoie), Grange in
football, and Delaney and Slattery in boxing.
