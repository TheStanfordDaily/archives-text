A SEASCAPE
A wintry blast was blasting across
the usual calm surface of fair Lagunita
and stirring the waters contained
therein to great wrath and emotion.
Wavelets were dashing hither and
thither, on the shore in particular;
but it availed them naught to dash
against the stern and mud-bound
shores because the shores were im
perturbable and promptly flung them
back from whence they came.
The night was fitfully dark, of
course, as the full moon was hidden
by the black wintry storm and conse
quently failed to cut much ice in the
scene. The hour was just one minute
past 3:47 a.m. Because of the winter,
the blast, and the hour, the scene
was quite deserted and devoid of life,
as it should be on a campus good and
proper. But hold! What was that heard
above the angry roar of the wintry
blast and pounding of wavelets on
the shore?
Ha! It was a voice that was heard
above the blasting blast. Someone in
distress, no doubt. But why should
anyone be in distress at one minute
past 3:48 o'clock in the morning?
Here, indeed, was a dark mystery. Yes,
a deep and damp mystery. But, let us
listen to the voices and see what they
were saying:
"Are you ready now?" said one
voice.
"I think so," said another voice.
"Are you?"
"Do you think we can make it this
time?" said voice number one.
"Well, we made 599.3 feet last time;
so we should be able to come pretty
close to it, I reckon. Don't forget you
are not allowed to walk on the bottom
for the forty feet under the water."
How far did you say Erny wants us
to go down? I hope it is not too far
because the pressure hurts my ears
after the first 9 feet. Ten feet, did you
say? Then I never can go canoeing."

YO—HEAVE—HO
Spanish Main was once the place
Where sailors bold and bad
Roamed o'er the seas and scuttled
ships
And captured all they had.
And then they'd land in hidden bays
And drink and sleep and fight,
And raise the devil all around
A-way into the night.
Those were the days when men were
men —
Except when they were dead —
Yo, ho, ho, with the rum below,
And a south wind dead ahead!
The Clannish Den is now the place
Where failers bold and glad—
Sop up the drinks and guttle schnaps
And pass out —full as bad!

And then they land in prison cells
And spend their days in fights
With fleas that raise them from their
beds
A-way into the nights.
These are the days when men are
men —
Except when they are dead —
Yo heave! ——ho} and the rum's
no go
With the jackass down instead.

The Clannish Den is now the place
Where failers bold and glad—
Sop up the drinks and guttle schnaps
And pass out —full as bad!

And then they land in prison cells
And spend their days in fights
With fleas that raise them from their
beds
A-way into the nights.
These are the days when men are
men —
Except when they are dead —
Yo heave! ——ho} and the rum's
no go
With the jackass down instead.
—L.A.B.
A SEASCAPE
A wintry blast was blasting across
the usual calm surface of fair Lagunita
and stirring the waters contained
therein to great wrath and emotion.
Wavelets were dashing hither and
thither, on the shore in particular;
but it availed them naught to dash
against the stern and mud-bound
shores because the shores were im
perturbable and promptly flung them
back from whence they came.
The night was fitfully dark, of
course, as the full moon was hidden
by the black wintry storm and conse
quently failed to cut much ice in the
scene. The hour was just one minute
past 3:47 a.m. Because of the winter,
the blast, and the hour, the scene
was quite deserted and devoid of life,
as it should be on a campus good and
proper. But hold! What was that heard
above the angry roar of the wintry
blast and pounding of wavelets on
the shore?
Ha! It was a voice that was heard
above the blasting blast. Someone in
distress, no doubt. But why should
anyone be in distress at one minute
past 3:48 o'clock in the morning?
Here, indeed, was a dark mystery. Yes,
a deep and damp mystery. But, let us
listen to the voices and see what they
were saying:
"Are you ready now?" said one
voice.
"I think so," said another voice.
"Are you?"
"Do you think we can make it this
time?" said voice number one.
"Well, we made 599.3 feet last time;
so we should be able to come pretty
close to it, I reckon. Don't forget you
are not allowed to walk on the bottom
for the forty feet under the water."
How far did you say Erny wants us
to go down? I hope it is not too far
because the pressure hurts my ears
after the first 9 feet. Ten feet, did you
say? Then I never can go canoeing."

YO—HEAVE—HO
Spanish Main was once the place
Where sailors bold and bad
Roamed o'er the seas and scuttled
ships
And captured all they had.
And then they'd land in hidden bays
And drink and sleep and fight,
And raise the devil all around
A-way into the night.
Those were the days when men were
men —
Except when they were dead —
Yo, ho, ho, with the rum below,
And a south wind dead ahead!
The Clannish Den is now the place
