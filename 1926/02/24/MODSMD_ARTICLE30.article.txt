# MENTAL ALERTNESS DULLED BY LACK OF SLEEP, TEST SHOWS
## 
### 
"It was easy enough to study the
first night," said Ellis R. Abbe, one
of the five students who took the
seventy-two-hour test to determine
the exact effects of the lack of sleep
which was given under the direction
of H. R. Laslett, "but when it came to
the second night it was all but im
possible, and on the third night it was
entirely out of the question."
These sleep tests were directed by
Laslett, graduate student in the Psy
chology department, as a part of the
requirements for a thesis for a doc
tor's degree. They were similar in
character to a number of experiments
which have recently attracted wide
spread interest in the East. While the
results have not been fully tabulated,
Laslett expressed himself as being
very much gratified at the way the
experiment was carried through.
"We had to keep watching each
other constantly toward the last," fur
ther declared Abbe, "to keep from go
ing to sleep. The only way we could
keep awake was to keep moving about
constantly. We amused ourselves by
talking, playing cards, listening to the
phonograph, and drawing pictures on
the blackboard."
Two of the Thorndyke mental tests
were given, the first at the end of the
fifty-fifth hour and the second at the
end of the experiment. The results
of the first showed a marked slowing
down of mental functioning; on the
second, the students could not con
centrate their gaze on the page with
out going to sleep. Those who took
the experiment are: Ellis Abbe, Ed
ward Carlson, Oliver Clark, William
Cooper, and William Page. Byron Har
vey and L. P. Harrington acted as
control subjects.
