# POLO PLAYER BADLY INJURED IN TUMBLE
## 
### 
Captain Don M. Scott, of the 30th
Infantry polo team, received severe
internal injuries when his horse fell
while he was playing at Del Monte
last Monday. Captain Scott was riding
at the time for the 76th Freebooters
in the high-goal tournament being
played at the resort.
He was rushed to the Monterey Hos
pital where physicians stated that, al
though his injuries were not fatal,
concussion of the brain, four fractured
ribs, and a pierced lung would prevent
his playing polo for some time. Cap
tain Scott was instrumental in the de
feat of the Stanford four in a game
played last November with the In
fantry team. He is well known on
the campus.
