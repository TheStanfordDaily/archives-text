# SENIORS WILL SEE DRAMATIZATION OF PREVIOUS MEETINGS
## 
### 
Undergoing a decided change in the
manner of holding class meeting, the
senior class will see a dramatization
of the ordinary class meetings when
they gather for business and pleasure
from 7 to 8 o'clock tonight in the
Women's Clubhouse. Guest artists
have ben obtained by the new presi
dent to start the new season. Peggy
Randall will sing sweet songs; Lew
Foote, Doc Moreno, and Felix Fay will
play stringed Hawaiian ballads; Neal
Miller will play on his guitar and sing
the songs he made popular in the Glee
Club Novelties; and Van King and Hal
Boone will dance to the haunting
jubilance of Gordon Hall's piano.
The graduating class and those of
the class who are going to wait awhile
will decide what gift their class shall
leave in their memory; new officers
will be introduced; the committee
chairmen and class day officials will
be appointed and announced; and de
tails of the requirements of Senior
Week will be explained. Interspersed
between the importance of the class
affairs will be the delicious noncha
lance of the entertainers. It is worthy
of note that no dues will be collected
at the meeting, and that an evening
of good clean fun will be had by all.
