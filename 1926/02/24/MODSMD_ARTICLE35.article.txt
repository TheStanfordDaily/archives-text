# MEN LIVE EMOTIONS WHILE WOMEN THINK THEIRS, TESTS SHOW
## Colgate University Research Reveals Fact of Male Superiority 
### 
Men live their emotions while wo- !
men think theirs, is the discovery at
Colgate University after some 600 men
and 400 women were given psycho
logical tests for emotional stability.
While reliable means of intelligence
testing have put to flight old-fashioned
ideas of male superiority, these tests
have revealed that men still have the
edge as far as stability of emotions
is concerned.
Twenty per cent more women pre
tend spurious mental fatigue than j
men; ten per cent more women are
introvert; more women were neuras
thenic. But hysteria was found to be
common to one sex as with the other.
Although the women made by far
the greater showing of emotion in
these college tests, in the country at
large the occurrence of extreme emo
tional instability as shown in insanity
js greater with men. This, however, is
considered by some not to be a true
test of emotional equipment because
men are as a class more exposed to i
hazards that result in insanity than â– 
are women.
The experimenters are not satisfied
that the variations between men and ;
women are due entirely to sex, but
believe it may be due to a difference ,
in social conditions. One of them said: I
"From earliest childhood the re
straints and training of the sexes dif- j
fer and the difference we find in mid-:
die adolescence may be a reverbera-1
tion of this early environment. Our
data cannot be interpreted as showing
that there are innate differences; they
may be acquired. The trend of opinion
is that the emotional outlets such as |
we are testing are acquired."
