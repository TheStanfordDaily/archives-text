businhss.men and women with whom
she is constantly associated. She gave
as fundamental reasons for the exist
ence of the associations, first, that
they satisfied the repressed desires of
students for ideals and idealism, which
is crowded out by so much of daily
living routine; and second, that they
give a practical framework for inter
nationalism, both in the non-exclusive
membership of the local units, and in
the linking together of students of the
world in the national and international
student movements.
Mr. .Roth stated his confidence in
the two associations and in those stu
dents who were working in them,
pointing out that they stood for funda
mental and worthwhile ideals and
practical working out of those ideals
in a college situation which spent so
much time and effort on superficial,
popular, and non-worthwhile things.
He encouraged the solicitors to go
with confidence and pride to the stu
dents at Stanford to ask their help in
this finance campaign.
