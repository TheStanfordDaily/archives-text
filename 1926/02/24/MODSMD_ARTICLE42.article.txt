# AERO-DYNAMICS LABORATORY HAS WIND TUNNEL
## MODEL PROPELLERS TESTED FOR PULLING FORCE ALL SENSATIONS OF REAL FLIGHT ARE POSSIBLE 
### C.B. Norman 
The nearest one can come to flying
at Stanford is in the aero-dynamics
laboratory. Even there it is the air
that flies, and not the person, but all
the sensations of a real flight may be
experienced by standing between the
inner ends of the two giant wind tun
nels and feeling the air rush past at a
tremendous rate.
The purpose of the great wind whose
miles per hour can be so exactly con
trolled is to give the illusion of flying,
not to thrill-seekers, but to model air
plaine propellers. Models are sent
from all over the country to be tested
in this laboratory.
Power Saved
The smaller ends of two giant fun
nels enter a small room from opposite
sides. Their inner ends are about ten
feet apart. In the outer end of one of
these funnels is a big fan about fifteen
feet in diameter. This draws the air
into the larger end of the opposite
funnel, through the room, and out by
the funnel in which the fan itself is
located. The small room and the two
funnels constitute the wind tunnel. By
making the tunnel large at the two
ends and small in the middle the
velocity of the air at the mid-point
can be made relatively large with a
relatively low speed of the fan. This
permits a large saving in power.
Pulling Force Tested
The propeller to be tested is placed
across the air current where it is
turned by an electric motor on the
other end of the propeller shaft. This
is necessitated by the fact that a
plane in flight is not only moving on
its shaft, but, along with the rest of
the machine, it is rushing forward
against the air. In order to measure
the pulling force of the model pro
pellers, the air is blown back against

the propellers at a definite speed from
35 to 80 miles per hour, which is
equivalent to making a dart through
the air at such a speed.
Since the pulling force of any pro
peller depends on the backward shove
that it gives the air or water that it
is turning in, this backward thrust is
less effective when the propeller itself
is moving forward away from the air
that it is to kick back against, as is
the case in flight. An exactly similar
condition is produced when the pro
peller makes no forward progress, but
the air against which it presses back
ward is itself given a backward velo
city by the wind-tunnel.
Speeds Recorded
When the propeller is rotated it
draws its shaft out of its original
position about half an inch; as the
speed increases, the shaft tendß to
move forward. It is brought back to
its original position by weights on a
beam balance. These weights indicate
the force that the propeller could exert
in pulling a plane through the sky.
The pulls for various propeller speeds
are recorded.
There are several wind tunnels in
the country similar to the one here.
Two are at Washington, one belong
ing to the Navy and the other to the
Bureau of Standards. Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the Uni
versity of Michigan each have one.
The Institute of Technology at Pasa
dena also has a small one. Two others
are in the process of construction, one
for McCook Field at Dayton, and one
for the Guggenheim Aeronautics In
stitute in New York.
The Stanford wind-tunnel is unique,
however, in its equipment for the test
ing of propellers. Others can test
wings and various parts of a plane,
but they cannot test the propellers.

making the tunnel large at the two
ends and small in the middle the
velocity of the air at the mid-point
can be made relatively large with a
relatively low speed of the fan. This
permits a large saving in power.
Pulling Force Tested
The propeller to be tested is placed
across the air current where it is
turned by an electric motor on the
other end of the propeller shaft. This
is necessitated by the fact that a
plane in flight is not only moving on
its shaft, but, along with the rest of
the machine, it is rushing forward
against the air. In order to measure
the pulling force of the model pro
pellers, the air is blown back against

the propellers at a definite speed from
35 to 80 miles per hour, which is
equivalent to making a dart through
the air at such a speed.
Since the pulling force of any pro
peller depends on the backward shove
that it gives the air or water that it
is turning in, this backward thrust is
less effective when the propeller itself
is moving forward away from the air
that it is to kick back against, as is
the case in flight. An exactly similar
condition is produced when the pro
peller makes no forward progress, but
the air against which it presses back
ward is itself given a backward velo
city by the wind-tunnel.
Speeds Recorded
When the propeller is rotated it
draws its shaft out of its original
position about half an inch; as the
speed increases, the shaft tendß to
move forward. It is brought back to
its original position by weights on a
beam balance. These weights indicate
the force that the propeller could exert
in pulling a plane through the sky.
The pulls for various propeller speeds
are recorded.
There are several wind tunnels in
the country similar to the one here.
Two are at Washington, one belong
ing to the Navy and the other to the
Bureau of Standards. Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the Uni
versity of Michigan each have one.
The Institute of Technology at Pasa
dena also has a small one. Two others
are in the process of construction, one
for McCook Field at Dayton, and one
for the Guggenheim Aeronautics In
stitute in New York.
The Stanford wind-tunnel is unique,
however, in its equipment for the test
ing of propellers. Others can test
wings and various parts of a plane,
but they cannot test the propellers.
The nearest one can come to flying
at Stanford is in the aero-dynamics
laboratory. Even there it is the air
that flies, and not the person, but all
the sensations of a real flight may be
experienced by standing between the
inner ends of the two giant wind tun
nels and feeling the air rush past at a
tremendous rate.
The purpose of the great wind whose
miles per hour can be so exactly con
trolled is to give the illusion of flying,
not to thrill-seekers, but to model air
plaine propellers. Models are sent
from all over the country to be tested
in this laboratory.
Power Saved
The smaller ends of two giant fun
nels enter a small room from opposite
sides. Their inner ends are about ten
feet apart. In the outer end of one of
these funnels is a big fan about fifteen
feet in diameter. This draws the air
into the larger end of the opposite
funnel, through the room, and out by
the funnel in which the fan itself is
located. The small room and the two
funnels constitute the wind tunnel. By
making the tunnel large at the two
ends and small in the middle the
velocity of the air at the mid-point
can be made relatively large with a
relatively low speed of the fan. This
permits a large saving in power.
