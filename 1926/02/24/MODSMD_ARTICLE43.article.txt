# CRANSTON HOLMAN, STRATFORD INVITED ON JAPANESE TOUR
## 
### 
Cranston Holman, premier Stanford
tennis star, and Gerald Stratford, for
mer California player, together with
Gervais Hillis, holder of the intercol
legiate doubles championship, have
been invited by Mr. Asabuki, San Fran
cisco representative of the Japan Ten
nis Association, to tour Japan this
spring, playing exhibition matches in
the various cities. Tliey probably will
leave the first week of March and
return in June.
Holman won his international repu-!
tation by his fine play in the tourna
ments back East last summer. He
figured prominently in every meet he
entered, he won the national junior
crown without the loss of a set, and
he was the only player to defeat Wil
liam T. Tilden, national champion, in
an exhibition match.
On the Cardinal varsity Holman has
been a great strength. Last year he
was the only Stanford man to win his
match in the California series, and
this year he is considered the one
hope against Edward Chandler, Blue
and Gold captain. His absence will be '
keenly felt.
