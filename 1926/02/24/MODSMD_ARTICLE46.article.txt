# "CERTAIN STUDENTS" FIND THEIR LABORS IN CLEARING TREES
## 
### 
Those "certain students" who
are sentenced to duties at the
Convalescent Home by the Men's
Council are assured of no lack
of exercise in the execution of
their penalties by the recent fell
ing of a number of trees on the
grounds of the Home.
Several of the older trees in
the immediate vicinity of build
ings have had to be removed be
cause of the danger in bad weath
er. This was found necessary
after the storms in the last week
blew down a number of heavy
branches.
Behind the McLaughlin unit
two old eucalyptus which have
been standing since the days
when Senator Stanford and his
family lived there, were also cut.
