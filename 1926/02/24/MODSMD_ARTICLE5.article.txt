# NEW COMPOSITION INCLUDED IN ORGAN RECITAL PROGRAM
## 
### 
A new composition, as yet unpub
lished, will be played by Warren D.
Allen, University organist, in his re
cital in the Memorial Church at 4:15
o'clock tomorrow. The work is "Sonata
in C Major" by Ernest Douglas, at
present organist of St. Mathias Church
in Los Angeles. The first two move
ments of the sonata will be playing
from the manuscript rendered by Al
len are "Prologue" and "Phantasy."
The famou√ü "Pilgrim's Chorus" from
the opera "Tannhauser" by Richard
Wagner will also be included in the
program. The chorus is a favorite
number in orchestral repertoires and
is often sung by choral societies. It
has a serious and elevated theme,
expressive of high faith.
"Shining Shore" is a selection from
E. S. Flames' "Seven Sketches" and is
based on an old hymn tune by Root.
"Scherzino in P Sharp Minor" by
Louis Vierne will also be played.
Vierne has been organist since 1900
in the cathedral of Notre Dame in
Paris. His concert tours through Eu
rope have made him famous as one
of the greatest living organ virtuosi.
He is also a composer.
