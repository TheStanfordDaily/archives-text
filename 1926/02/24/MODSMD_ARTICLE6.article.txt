# DAVIS COMPLETES CASTING OF PARTS FOR ENGLISH PLAY
## HARVEY TO GIVE DANCE Experienced Players Will Carry Leading Roles In Production 
### 
Gordon Davis completed last night
the selection of the cast for "The
Green Goddess," a melodrama in four
acts being presented March 5 under
| the auspices of the English Club. In
! eluding both principal and minor parts
I the cast totals forty characters, most
I of which have individual parts.
Byron Harvey, as Congo, a black,
j will give a sword dance, which, if
I anything like his previous perform
; ances, is certain to be a success.
Few Leads
The leading parts in the play are
I very few, but are carried by experi
| enced people, who show promise of
i putting out a pol-

ished production.
Garth Winslow, as
Major Crespin, has
been in only one
play on the cam
pus, "In the Next
Room," but his
portrayal of the
crafty crook, Felix
Armand, was suc
cessfully handled.
Davis should be
able to make a
terse, testy British
major of him with

comparative ease.

In the role of the
Rajah Ruks, played by George Arliss
in the play's first run, is Lloyd Nolan,
well known to campus theatergoers.
He was in "Captain Applejack" some
time ago, then left the campus to
tour in vaudeville for several months.
Last fall he took the role of the cap
tain in "What Price Phi Bete?" of the
Football Gaieties, and was also in a
blackface skit in the same show.
Helen Lewis is the only woman
principal in the cast. There are, in
fact, only three other women, who
have parts as villagers. Miss Lewis
made a triumphant debut in "R.U.R."
last year. Her quiet and assured air
on the stage, added to a quality and


Garth Winslow
depth of emotion all her own, places
her among the most accomplished
actresses on the campus.
Freshman Has Role
Sam Hayes, as Dr. Traherne, is
making his first appearance at Stan
ford. He is a freshman, but does not
seem to have many of the verdant
earmarks of his worthy class. Jack
Wiggin completes the leading roles,
in that of W'atkins, valet to the Rajah.
With his knowledge of India and wide
range of Cockney dialects he will add
a new flavor to this often-hackneyed
English type.
Powell Carpenter has been changed
from the part of Flight Leftenant Car
dew to that of Major Domo, with Rob
ert Keerl replacing him in the Leften
ant role. Keerl was chosen for the
sophomore play, "In the Next Room,"
last fall, but was unable to keep the
part because of a short absence from
the campus. He should play this lead
ing part with facility.

Helen Lewis is the only woman
principal in the cast. There are, in
fact, only three other women, who
have parts as villagers. Miss Lewis
made a triumphant debut in "R.U.R."
last year. Her quiet and assured air
on the stage, added to a quality and


Garth Winslow
depth of emotion all her own, places
her among the most accomplished
actresses on the campus.
Freshman Has Role
Sam Hayes, as Dr. Traherne, is
making his first appearance at Stan
ford. He is a freshman, but does not
seem to have many of the verdant
earmarks of his worthy class. Jack
Wiggin completes the leading roles,
in that of W'atkins, valet to the Rajah.
With his knowledge of India and wide
range of Cockney dialects he will add
a new flavor to this often-hackneyed
English type.
Powell Carpenter has been changed
from the part of Flight Leftenant Car
dew to that of Major Domo, with Rob
ert Keerl replacing him in the Leften
ant role. Keerl was chosen for the
sophomore play, "In the Next Room,"
last fall, but was unable to keep the
part because of a short absence from
the campus. He should play this lead
ing part with facility.
