# Dramatic Council Meets Payment On $2000 Deficit
## 
### 
The sum of $500 was today turned
over to the University by the Dramatic
Council to pay off part of a deficit of
$2000 which stood on the Council's
books at the beginning of the school
year.
Under the supervision of Paul Bis
singer, Dramatic Manager for this
year, a total of $1500 has been paid
on this deficit. Harry Noland states
that the whole amount could be paid
at this time, but that the Council is
waiting to be sure there is enough
money on hand to meet current ex
penses.
The Dramatic Council has under
taken in the past few years to furnish
the Assembly hall with the very latest
of stage equipment, and this has ne
cessitated a large outlay of money.
The deficit does not actually mean
anything in the long run, as will be
seen by the fact that this year it has
not been necessary to buy much new
equipment and the consequent cutting
of the deficit has been possible.
