A HUNDRED years before Napoleon was
born, before his wars scourged Europe, be*
fore the French Revolution raged, this Cast Iron
Pipe was laid, in the reign of Louis XIV, to
supply water to the fountains of Versailles.
A report from the Director of the Water Serv
ice says: "From their actual state of preserva
tion, which is excellent, excepting the assembly
iron bolts, these conduits seem to be able to fur
nish service for a very considerable time longer."
The high resistance of this Cast Iron Pipe to
corrosion may be judged from the clearness of
the fine "parting line" produced by the old
horizontal method of casting.
