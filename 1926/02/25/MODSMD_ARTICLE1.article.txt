# CLASS COMPETITION WILL REVEAL TRACK SEASON PROSPECTS
## Varsity Runners Can Enter Any Races in Saturday's Competition 
### Fred Swan 
At the annual interclass track meet
Saturday Coach Dink Templeton will
have his first real opportunity to line
up the prospects for the coming sea
son. Varsity men may enter any of
the events, but some of them will
forsake their regular races and enter
at other distances. In this meet fol
lowers of track will have a chance to
see just how far the track men have
advanced in their work to date. The
meet starts at 2 o'clock on the old
oval.
Exceptionally good weather has
favored the track work the last few
days and this fact should aid the men
in their performances next Saturday.
Few of the varsity men have competed
in the informal Friday track meets, so
that tho Interclass meet will be the
first real competition this year.
Stanford seems to be well fortified
in all departments except the sprints
this year, so fans will bo interested in
the 100- and 220-yard dashes. There
should be a keen race in the 2Â°o with
Gaspar and Coverly as the principals.
Last Friday Coverly defeated Gaspar
and finished in easy style.
The varsity weight men will have
hard going with some of the ambitious
freshman aspirants. Goodcell looks
especially good in the javelin and
should come in a winner. Forster, a
1929 man, will run close to Hoffman
in the shot. The latter's showing Sat
urday will give track followers a
chance to compare his work with that
of Houser of U.S.C. and Gerkin of
California. He meets these men later
in the season.
All the events hold a great deal of
interest for the dopesters, and fans
who attend the meet will see plenty
of action.
