# INTERCLASS TITLE SWIMMING CONTEST PLANNED SATURDAY
## 
### 
The interclass swimming champion
ship will be decided Saturday after
noon at 1 o'clock in Encina pool. The
regular list of events will be held, in
cluding sprint and distance races,
breaststroke, and backstroke Competi
tion.
The senior combination is favored
to win the title by a good margin. The
fourth-year men will have among their
representatives, Wally O'Connor in
the sprint races, Arden Allen in the
backstroke and breaststroke, and Dave
Fall, captain of the swimming team
and champion diver of the Univer
sity. As holdovers are allowed to swim
under the senior banner, Andy Chris
tensen, a transfer from Utah, will
compete, and should be able to add
points by placing in the 220-yard race.
Carl Stevenson, varsity distance
man, will be one of the mainstays of
the junior team. He should take first
in the 220-yard free style. Bob Wil
liams and Phil Brooks will compete
for the juniors in sprint races.
Sophomore chances are not very
good when compared with those of the
upperclassmen. Walter Mills in diving,
Wagner in the breaststroke, and Dan
ford in sprints appear to be the only
chances for worthwhile places which
the second-year men have.
