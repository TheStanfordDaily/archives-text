# STANFORD BOXERS MEET DAVIS FARM IN RETURN BOUTS
## Coach Jake Irwin Will Use Practically Same Men As in First Fight 
### 
Tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in the
pavilion the Cardinal boxing team will
meet Davis Farm in return matches,
after upsetting all precedent in de
feating their opponents in the Aggie
lair in their first meeting. With the
possible exception of th-e lightweight
entry, Coach Jake Irwin will enter the
same men that he used before to win
four of the seven bouts.
Myron Schall, Stanford captain, will
again fight in the middleweight class,
with Norm Fain as light-heavy. Fain
turned in a victory for the Stanford
boxers in his bout with Stew Grubbs
of Davis, scoring a technical knockout
in the fourth round. Grubbs was later
found to have received a fractured rib
which will keep him'from fighting for
the Aggies the remainder of this year.
Jim Arthur is the entry for heavy
weight. He will again battle Art Scho
ber, over whom he was victorious in
the bout at the Farm. Harry Steven
son, winner of the welterweight title
in the recent novice tournament, will
represent the Cardinal in this weight.
Collins, veteran bantamweight, and
Carlos Miron, featherweight, again
meet the Aggie fighters. No announce
ment has been made of the lightweight
entry.
