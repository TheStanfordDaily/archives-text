# FIRST TRIALS CLOSE TONIGHT FOR PARTS IN WOMEN'S FIESTA
## 
### 
First trials for both dancing and
dramatic parts in the Fiesta will be
held for the last time tonight at 7
o'clock in Roble gymnasium. Indivi
dual tryouts will take only a few min
utes, according to Margaret Cosgrave,
Fiesta manager.
Few women have as yet turned out
for the Fiesta, and as the production
calls for a large number of characters,
including dancers, dramatic leads, and
pantomine roles, the committee asks
that all women try out. Those who do
not pass the dancing tryouts may find
other parts in the pageant which they
can take. No more trials will be held
this quarter.

passed the first tryouts: Helen Adams,
