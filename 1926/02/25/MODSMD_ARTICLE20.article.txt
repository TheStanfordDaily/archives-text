Riding in a taxi with no meter to watch will be a reality Friday noon
when the women of the campus stage their annual taxi-drive. All funds
received through this venture will be used toward filling the $1600
quota set for the Y.W.C.A. drive this year.
When the Friday eleven o'clock's are over the five-hundred's choicest
motorists will be waiting at the Engineers' corner and the Chemistry
building ready to escort the men home. After the ride is over all you have
to do is chip-in anything from a bum dime to a Canadian two-bit piece.
All fares will be receipted with murmured thanks and perhaps a sweet
smile.
Each and every taxi-driver will be a woman for all men have been
ruled out of the competition. In fact, men will be minor figures in the
whole affair. All you have to do is fill up your car with gasoline, lend it
to some sweet young thing, when the time comes buy a ride home in your
own car, and then say, "Thanks for the buggy ride."

COACH "HUSKY" HUNT HAS heard that several freshmen who
are planning to report for baseball have been told that practice does not
start until next quarter. The first year diamond men are working out
daily, and any aspirants should report to Hunt immediately.

Purity and virtue triumphant at U.S.C., according to the Daily Trojan :
"Many students along University Avenue remarked about the lack of cartoons
displaying the feminine sex in yesterday's issue of the Wampus, trom the results of
some of the humor, it looks as though the entire staff is composed of the stronger
sex."

More evidence for high moral level of France, from the Minnesota
Daily:
"An amusing thing about the French universities," said Paul Morand recently
returned from Europe, "is that the young men students do not take out co-eds for
the co-cds of France are less attractive than here."
