# W.A.A. TO DISCUSS PLANS OF PLAY DAY AT OPEN MEETING
## 
### 
Women's Athletic Association will
hold its open meeting next Wednesday
evening at 7:30 o'clock, according to
an announcement made last night by
Jean Ward, president of the organiza
tion. Awards for last quarter will be
made at this time.
Miss Ward has received the sched
ules for tennis and swimming competi
tion on the Triangular Conference play
day, to be held April 6, and will report
on the play day at the meeting. The
meet, in which Mills College and Cali
fornia and Stanford participate, will
be held on the California campus.
The swimming schedule, made out
by Mills, provides for a maximum of
twenty-five participants from one uni
versity. As the plan allows each wo
man to enter two events, it is not
necessary for a university to send the
maximum number to be represented
in all events. The teams will be mixed
and will not represent the colleges.
Individual competition will all be for
form, and not for speed.
All the tennis matches will be dou
bles. In each match the players will
be paired so that no two women from
the same college will be playing to
gether. Each university will send five
players, an umpire who will preferably
be its tennis coach, and five linesmen.
