# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Next Tuesday Stanford women will
vote on the Point System which will
regulate women's activities if it is
adopted.
Many criticisms have been raised,
but if the advantages and disadvan
tages are weighed impartially, the ad
vantages will be predominant.
The Point System will not check
initiative. On the contrary, it will tend
to develop initiative by allowing the
proper amount of time for each office.
By equalizing the distribution of ac
tivities a woman will have time to
think up new ideas and an opportun
ity to develop them. By concentrating
her efforts in one field she becomes
complete master of the work and can
show her own initiative in office.
The organizations will prosper un
der the Point System because the wo
men will be able to give more time
and more thought, thus better service
to the University.
In past years the prominent women
on the camnus have always been
elected to the highest offices. This
small group carried all the responsi
bilities. The work has been done well,
but a larger group obviously could
perform the same tasks more efficient
ly. The Point System will so distribute
the offices as to give a greater num
ber of women a chance to become
active in campus affairs.
The Committee has figured out, bas
ing the Point System on actual facts,
how much a woman can do efficiently
and still maintain her health and
scholarship. It is unreasonable for
anyone to attempt more than she can
do well. It is not fair to the school, to;
her fellow students, or herself. The j
Point System will eliminate all possi
bility of such overburdening.
It is for each woman to decide
whether she thinks campus affairs
warrant a Point System, or whether
school activities should not be regu
lated. It is a case for individual think-1
iug. —'26. !
