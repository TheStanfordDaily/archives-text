# SPORTS OF 1926
## Big League Managers 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Starting his first training trip as playing manager of;
the St. Louis Cardinals finds the great "Rajah" with added
responsibilities, but also added optimism and enthusiasm.
Hornsby should know, from his success as the leader of
the Cards last year, when he took over the team in mid
season and piloted it to a berth in the first division, that
things are looking brighter for a pennant in the Mound
City than they have since 1921, when St. Louis finished
third.
The Cardinals' young manager (Hornsby will be 30' in
April) is not only the greatest batsman in baseball history, ;
but he is also one of the most popular players in the game
today. Handsome, graceful, clean-cut, he typifies both on
and off the field all that those who are deeply interested
in baseball's future would have it stand for. If more boys
took Hornsby as their model, the better it would be for |

this country and baseball.
When the Cardinals' second baseman batted .424 in 1924, he beat the
.420 record held by Cobb and Sisler and set a new high mark for modern
baseball. He has led his league in batting six years in succession (two years
more than Wagner did), and he has averaged over .400 for the last FIVE
years. And all of this in spite of being a right-handed hitter!
Hornsby's other titles include that of "Most Valuable National League
Player in 1925," and "National League Home Run King, 1922 and 1925."
Physically, the Rajah stands close to six feet in height, and weighs a little
over 170 pounds. Like Bob Fitzsimmons, he has rather bird-like legs, and,
like Fitz, he too hits with tremendous power. Hornsby, you know, comes
from Texas and was bought by the Cardinals in 1915 for $500. Now you
couldn't buy him at $500 an ounce, even though he does make a few more
errors than some of the other second basemen.
