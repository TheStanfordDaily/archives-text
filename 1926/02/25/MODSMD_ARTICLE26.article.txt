## MEMOIRS OF A CANOE ON LAGUNITA 
### Monroe Eaton 
I was a darned good canoe
Until I got out
On this lake and now I'm
IiUINED, ABSOLUTELY A
Moral wreck. I just can't follow
The straight and narrow
PATH ANY LONGER. FULL MOONS
Are the bane of my existence.
Every time I get dragged out at
Night I can always make
SURE THERE IS TROUBLE AHEAD.
It's so depressing to carry
Stout people too. The other night
I ALMOST CAPSIZED
When a woman threatened to get out
And walk when I was
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
Lake. Last year I did turn
Over once when the man who was
Paddling me couldn't
FIND NERVE ENOUGH TO
Propose. But they only got a
Little bit muddy because it was
NEAR THE SHORE. HE
Wouldn't trust me any more, though,
So the next night he got
ONE OF THOSE DUMB ROWBOATS.
But they aren't as well
Suited for proposals as I am
Because they aren't
NEARLY AS TREACHEROUS.
Whenever anyone starts to brag
About how well he can paddle a
CANOE, I TURN 'ROUND
And 'round. I also have a trick
All my own of springing
A LEAK WHEN I DON'T LIKE THE
Conversation. Anyway, it's
A great life if you never get
SUNK.
