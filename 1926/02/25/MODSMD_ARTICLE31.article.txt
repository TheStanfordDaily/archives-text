# ZOOLOGY STUDENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR BIRD BANDING WORK
## Flocking Habits of Quail Are Studied; Many Banded On Campus 
### Elsa Krotozyner 
A program of bird banding is being
carried on by the Zoology department
under the direction of Dr. John O.
Snyder. This was started years ago at
the University, and three or four stu
dents have been continuing the woik
since that time.
The campus is divided into lots with
students assigned to stations to oper
ate traps on each. The traps are three
feet in length, a foot high, and eight
een inches in width. They are on the
ground, and with grain and bread as
bait, the birds are caught.
After the birds have been captured,
a small metal band is snapped around
the leg of each one, and it is then set
free. Each band has a special number
which is registered at the bureau of
the United States Biological Survey
at Washington.
The object of banding birds is to
study their migration and local habits,
their mating relationship, and their
relative length of life. There are vari
ous bird-banding stations throughout
the United States.
At Stanford the students are at
work on different problems. The flock
ing habit of the quail is being studied
at present, and as many as twenty
live or thirty quail have parked them
selves into a trap at one time. It is
this habit that causes the quail to
remain in the same group for a season.
Over one hundred quail have been
banded. Some birds return year after
year to the same traps. During a sea
son some of them come back every
day fon weeks at a time to the same
traps, where they are assured of pleni
ful food.
In the spring the nestlings of the
blackbirds and finches that make their
nests in the palms along Palm Drive
are banded before they are able to fly.
In this way the students are able to
determine whether these young birds
return to the same spot the following
year.
The cliff swallows which make their
nests about the campus do not escape
banding. These birds are banded at
night in their nests, and it can then
be observed whether the birds return
to the same nests each year, and
whether or not they continue with the
same mate.
Those working on the bird banding
at present are Philip Baxter, John
Price, and Seymour Smith.
