# SOPHOMORE WOMEN DOWN SENIORS 15-5 IN BASKETBALL TILT
## 
### 
Outpassing and outshooting tbeir
opponents, the sophomore women
downed the basketball team 15
to 5 yesterday afternoon. The game
was rough throughout, center players
particularly taking a large number of
tumbles.
Evelyn Brown, sophomore forward,
was high scorer for her team. The
able guarding of her teammates,
Helen Lease and Anne Hartwell, and
the excellent passing of the 1928 cen
ters, Frances Clancy, Lucia Champlin,
and later Dorothy Cone, brought the
ball several times from their own bas
ket for tallies.
Hampered by the absence of tbeir
strong center, Mabel Macfe.rron, the
seniors fought a losing battle from
the first. Their guards, Millison Hardy
and Cecile Feusier, were quick, and
many tinies prevented the sophomores
from making what were almost cer
tain scores. The passing in the senior
center was good, but the 1926 for
wards could not find the basket quick
ly enough. Margaret Earle scored both
of their field goals.
