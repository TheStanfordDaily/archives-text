/YVER five hundred players, representing the forty-eight teams entered from
" the various living groups, were taken into consideration in this year's
selection of the all-star intramural basketball teams. John A. Menzies, head
referee and student manager of the series, with the assistance of a group of
critics, is responsible for the selection of the 1926 mythical quintets.
Menzies has witnessed every team in action during the seven weeks of
intftamural competition, and the players of the three teams were selected
because of their individual ability and not because of the success of the teams
on which they competed. The large number of good players and the general

>good style of basketball displayed in
the majority of the games made the
selection of the teams difficult.
Stan Cook, flashy Breakers Club
forward, was far superior to any other
forward in the series. His clever floor
work, accurate passing, and timely
scoring ability made him one of the
most valuable players on the intra
mural courts. Cook exhibited an un
canny ability to dribble around the
opposing defense. He broke fast on
the offense, covered quickly on the
defense, and in general, was the out
standing forward seen in action during
the entire season.
Harry Southworth, Kappa Sigma,
was hard pressed by Clink Fraser, Phi
Kappa Psi, for the second forward
position. Both players made an im
pressive showing, but Southworth is
generally conceded the edge in most
departments of the game. He is a fast,
clever dribbler, a sure passer, and
would work to great advantage with
Cook. Chick Stevens, Kappa Sigma, is
placed at forward on the second five
with little opposition from other con
tenders.
Bob King, Delta Tau Delta center,
was the obvious choice for the pivot
position. King has had a great amount
of basketball experience, and his play
ing throughout the season showed that
he was thoroughly acquainted with
the finer points of the game. He was
especially effective under the basket,
and his jumping ability at center
would be an asset to any team. Gib
bons and Middleton displayed good
form during the series, and their work
merits their respective places on the
second and third quintets.
Gil McDermont, Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon, was the logical player for the
running guard position. He has played
at forward in the majority of this
year's games, but his general style of
play marks him as an ideal running
guard. He is very efficient in defen
sive playing, and breaks well from
offensive to defensive. McDermont
plays a clever floor game and can be
relied upon to come through with field
goals when they are needed. Richards,
Encina lE, rates the second team po
sition with little question. Holman,
Alpha Delta Phi, is another forward
given a place at running guard be
cause of an obviously natural aptitude
for that position.
Selecting a player for standing
guard was difficult. No outstanding
back guards were noticeable this sea
son, and it was necessary to pick the
players from a mediocre bunch of
prospects. Art Mann, Kappa Sigma,
and Mike Reynolds, Phi Delta Theta,
vied evenly for the first team posi
tion, and the honor was finally giwrn
to the former because of a more con
sistent showing. Mann played excep
tionally well in the latter part of the
season, and his defensive work and
quick covering was very effective. Clif
Montgomery, Beta Theta Pi, is given
the third team berth as he was de
cidedly better than the other con
tenders for the position.
