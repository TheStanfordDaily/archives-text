# ENGLISH CLUB HAS MEN EXPERIENCED IN WAYS OF INDIA
## Gordon Davis, Jack Wiggin Have Valuable Ideas For Production 
### Frank Baker 
The English Club, presenting "The
Green Goddess" on March 5, in the
Assembly hall, is able to boast of two
men in this play who have had actual
contact with India, both living and
traveling there. They are Gordon
Davis, director, and John Wiggin, who
is taking the part of Watkins, the
cockney valet.
Davis, while he was out with the
Daniel Frawley Company as dramatic
director, made several long tours, one
of which was through India. He was
in several of the more important cities,

and stayed for a
considerable time,
making trips into
the interior. Thus
he became fairly
familiar with the
customs and ideas
of the people of
India.
John Wiggin has
spent a large por
tion of his life in
Bombay, where his
family lives. He is
able to give invalu
able service in se-

lecting the right dress for each type
of character, a problem which is al-
Arays one of great dimensions in a
play of a foreign character.
Many directors attempt to put on
their costume shows with any sort of
makeshift dress. The fine points are
not noticeable by the majority of peo
ple until the right and wrong things
are put side by side. Gordon Davis is
attempting to make "The Green God
dess" as nearly perfect in the cos
tumes and atmosphere of India as is
possible.
Wiggin, in the part of Watkins, has
a part for which he is peculiarly fitted.
He states that there are at least eleven
different Cockney English dialects
spoken in London, besides some other
odd twists that are acquired in the
environment of India, through quirks
that have been added by the mottled
garble of the natives. Wiggin is fa
miliar with several of these dialects,
and will portray the Cockney Britisher
at his cockiest.
