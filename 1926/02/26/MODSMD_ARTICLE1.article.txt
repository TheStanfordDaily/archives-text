# STANFORD BOXERS CLASH WITH DAVIS MEN IN PAVILION
## AGGIES SEEK REVENGE Fain, Clark to Clash in Decisive Semi-Final Match Tonight 
### Gordon French 
California Aggie boxers come to
Stanford tonight confident they can
avenge their defeat in the series of
fights held two weeks ago at the Davis
institution. The bouts will be held in
the pavilion at 8 o'clock.
Stanford trimmed the Aggies in
four matches out of seven at their
first meeting, but at the return match
several of the matches may go differ
ently than before. One of the features
of the previous fights was the fact
that five bouts ended in knockouts,
three Stanford men downing their op
ponents by the kayo route.
Last week the Farmers' stock went
up considerably when they outfought
the California boxers in a go in the
Aggie arena. They won four of the
seven matches played.
Card Victory Expected
Coach Jake Irwin expects his Cardi
nal boxers to repeat their victory of
two weeks ago by substituting Ross,
if he is able to make the weights, for
Goldwater who was defeated by Al
Gomez, Aggie lightweight, by a tech
nical knockout.
The Aggies also have a new battler
in Lion Gomez who surprised follow
ers of the fights by trimming Seaburg,
California. He will meet Collins, Stan
ford bantamweight, who whipped Jack
lirem in the first go. Don Gomez,
though he outpointed Carlos Miron of
the Cards by a small margin at their
other meeting, is expected to get a
hard fight at featherweight if Miron
has overcome liis nervousness.
Harry Stevenson, Card welterweight,
is to have a return match with Marv
Miller, California Aggie fighter, who
was victorious by a technical knock
out in the second round last time
after Stevenson had won the first
round. Captain Schall of Stanford, who
has yet to be defeated in an intercol
legiate ring meeting, will meet Don
Eveleth, Davis middleweight, and is
expected to win without any difficulty.
He won last time by a technical
knockout in the second round.
Fain, Clark to Meet
Fain, Stanford light-heavyweight,
will attempt to repeat his technical
knockout when he enters the ring
against Matt Clark. The fighters
fought to a draw for the regulation
three rounds and an extra round was
necessary to decide the winner; at
this point Fain surprised the onlookers
by quickly finishing his opponent. The
battle was so close that either may
win tonight and as a single upset is
likely to cause victory or defeat this
match may be the crucial one.
In the last bout of the evening, the
heavyweights will clash with Jim Ar
thur of Stanford track fame favored
to repeat his victory. He won over his
Davis Farm opponent by a technical
knockout in their first clash. His vic
tory last time gave Coach Jake Irwin's
men the contest.
