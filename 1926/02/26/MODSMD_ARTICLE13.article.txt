## 
### Frank Baker 
A wide variety of characters, in
volved In "deep-dyed plots of mys
tery," and emotional crises seldom
seen on the campus stage, will form
the nucleus for "The Green Goddess,"
being presented by the English Club
under the direction of Gordon Davis,
March 5.
The role of the Raja, created by
George Arliss, portrays a sleek, sly,
and brilliant Hindoo, who is actually
the devil incarnate, but who has a
smooth suavity, polish, and culture he
acquired while living in Europe and
attending college. Into his kingdom,
Rukh, he has brought all the latest
inventions and comforts of the mod
ern world. His ancient castle, though
built perhaps centuries ago, is equip
ped with all that great wealth can
buy. He actually has a separate world
all to himself in the middle of the
mountains and wastes of India.
He has imported an English valet,
who is as much of a rogue as he is

himself. He describes Watkins to the
people thus: "He is my prime minis
ter and all my cabinet, but in par
ticular he is by Lord Chamberlain.
No one can touch him at making a
salad or mixing a cocktail. My entire
household trembles at his nod. Even
my chef quails before him. Nothing
comes amiss to him, and he is, like
myself, a man without prejudices."
The wonders of his palace are hint
ed by Lucilla, wife of Major Crespin.
"My guide led me along corridor after
corridor until we came to a heavy
bronze door where two villainous
looking blacks were on guard. They
drew their swords and flourished a
sort of salute. Then the Ayah (a na
tive servant) clapped her hands twice,
someone peered through a grating in
the massive door. A few hasty words
were spoken in the native tongue,
then the door was swung slowly open
by a hideous, crooked woman. We
passed on through more corridors with
guarded doorways where I had a feel
ing that eyes were watching me. I'm
sure I heard whispering and titter
ings." Later she sees that glimpse of

"tjae~palace, nofln awe, but in horror.
Lucilla and her husband, Major
Crespin, have been estranged for some
time. She is in love with I)r. Traherne,
a physician who is with them. Cres
pin, in a half-drunken state, shows
his weakness. "Oh, you good women!
You patter after the parson 'Forgive
us our sins,' but you don't know what
forgiveness means. You have made,
my life a thing that won't bear looking!
at except through a haze of drink. I'm
in your way; you love this other man.
This model of all the virtues! He's a '
paragon, a wonder. And you are curs-1
ing the mistake you made in marrying i
a poor devil of a soldier man instead |
of a first class scientific genius."
When all is nearly over, and only:

a few moments of life remain for the
English party, Lucilla and Dr. Tra
herne are at last alone together. Real
izing that their lives are almost fin
ished they give vent to their inmost
feelings and love for <>aeh other. Tra
herne says:
"I meant to have left it all unspoken,
but now we have only one more mo
ment on this side of eternity. I)o you
know what it has meant to me to see
you another man's wife, bound to him
by ties I couldn't ask you to break?"
"Yes, I know. 1 have known â€”from
the beginning."
