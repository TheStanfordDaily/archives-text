# SOPHOMORES UNABLE TO DEFEAT FRESHMAN NINE IN CLOSE GAME
## Red Moore, Chuck Hanna Have Pitching Duel, Contest Ends in Tie 
### 
The sophomore and freshman base
ball teams battled yesterday to a 1 to
1 tie in the first interclass diamond
game of the series on the freshman
field. The game turned out to be a
pitchers' duel and until the last in
ning neither team could score. The
junior-senior clash was again post
poned.
The feature of the game was the
hurling duel between Ited Moore of
the sophomores and Chuck Hanna of
the 1929 squad. Red Moore was very
effective and mixed his deliveries to
great advantage. He let down the
freshmen without a single hit for the
first five innings, but in the last in
ning Wilton hit a Texas Leaguer that
was good for two bases to spoil bis
no-hit game. Moore struck out seven
of his opponents, several times with
ease, but allowed three walks.
Hanna Pitches
While Hanna did not turn back the
sophomores so easily, he tightened
every time they became dangerous.
This is evidenced by the fact that in
five of the six innings the '28 team
had one or more men on base and only
succeeded in scoring once. He allowed
four hits, struck out five men, and only
allowed two walks.
Both teams fielded well considering
the small amount of time available for
practice. The freshmen made two
errors, both of which were excusable,
while the sophomores committed only
one blunder. The hitting on both sides
was weak and both teams could stand
some batting practice. The '29 team
seemed utterly unable to get onto
Moore's tricky pitching.
The sophomores threatened to start
off the game scoring when with two
i out Harlow and Rupe located range
I and each made a hit. With men on
j second and third the best Prisinzano
! could do was a grounder to third, and
| lie was tossed out at first. The fresh
-1 men went out, one, two, three in their
I half of the inning. Two infield taps
and a strikeout were the beßt they
could do.
The sixth and last inning opened
with both teams scoreless Prisinzano
smashed a fast grounder at Rogers,
freshman shortstop, who fumbled the
ball long enough to allow Rogers to
reach first safely. Biaggini sent him to
third with a one-bagger. A cleverly
executed bunt scored the run when
Hanna threw wild to first and Win
ters kicked the ball around until it
was too late to catch the runner. At
this point. Hanna settled down and
struck out the next two batters and
forced the third to ground out, second
to first.
Biaggini Stars
Wilton, after fouling the first two
pitches, hit a fly near the side-lines
and out of reach of both the right
fielder and the first baseman for two
bases. Harder smashed a grounder to
Rupe, third baseman, who tossed the
ball wide to Snyde at first, who failed
to touch him as he ran past. Winters
made a bunt which placed the run
ners on second and third. A long sacri

fice fly by Martin scored Wilton. A
moment before Hartley struck out, Har
der hesitated too long when he had a
good chance to steal home.
Biaggini was the batting star with
two hits out of three times at bat. It
is significant that the teams together
did not hit the ball out of the infield
more than five times.
The junior and freshman teams will
play this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock,
while the sophomores and seniors
meet Monday at the same time.

freshmen without a single hit for the
first five innings, but in the last in
ning Wilton hit a Texas Leaguer that
was good for two bases to spoil bis
no-hit game. Moore struck out seven
of his opponents, several times with
ease, but allowed three walks.
Hanna Pitches
While Hanna did not turn back the
sophomores so easily, he tightened
every time they became dangerous.
This is evidenced by the fact that in
five of the six innings the '28 team
had one or more men on base and only
succeeded in scoring once. He allowed
four hits, struck out five men, and only
allowed two walks.
Both teams fielded well considering
the small amount of time available for
practice. The freshmen made two
errors, both of which were excusable,
while the sophomores committed only
one blunder. The hitting on both sides
was weak and both teams could stand
some batting practice. The '29 team
seemed utterly unable to get onto
Moore's tricky pitching.
The sophomores threatened to start
off the game scoring when with two
i out Harlow and Rupe located range
I and each made a hit. With men on
j second and third the best Prisinzano
! could do was a grounder to third, and
| lie was tossed out at first. The fresh
-1 men went out, one, two, three in their
I half of the inning. Two infield taps
and a strikeout were the beßt they
could do.
The sixth and last inning opened
with both teams scoreless Prisinzano
smashed a fast grounder at Rogers,
freshman shortstop, who fumbled the
ball long enough to allow Rogers to
reach first safely. Biaggini sent him to
third with a one-bagger. A cleverly
executed bunt scored the run when
Hanna threw wild to first and Win
ters kicked the ball around until it
was too late to catch the runner. At
this point. Hanna settled down and
struck out the next two batters and
forced the third to ground out, second
to first.
Biaggini Stars
Wilton, after fouling the first two
pitches, hit a fly near the side-lines
and out of reach of both the right
fielder and the first baseman for two
bases. Harder smashed a grounder to
Rupe, third baseman, who tossed the
ball wide to Snyde at first, who failed
to touch him as he ran past. Winters
made a bunt which placed the run
ners on second and third. A long sacri

fice fly by Martin scored Wilton. A
moment before Hartley struck out, Har
der hesitated too long when he had a
good chance to steal home.
Biaggini was the batting star with
two hits out of three times at bat. It
is significant that the teams together
did not hit the ball out of the infield
more than five times.
The junior and freshman teams will
play this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock,
while the sophomores and seniors
meet Monday at the same time.
The sophomore and freshman base
ball teams battled yesterday to a 1 to
1 tie in the first interclass diamond
game of the series on the freshman
field. The game turned out to be a
pitchers' duel and until the last in
ning neither team could score. The
junior-senior clash was again post
poned.
The feature of the game was the
hurling duel between Ited Moore of
the sophomores and Chuck Hanna of
the 1929 squad. Red Moore was very
effective and mixed his deliveries to
great advantage. He let down the
freshmen without a single hit for the
first five innings, but in the last in
ning Wilton hit a Texas Leaguer that
was good for two bases to spoil bis
no-hit game. Moore struck out seven
