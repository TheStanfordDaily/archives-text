# STANFORD MUSEUM PAINTING PRAISED IN MEEHAN'S BOOR
## 
### 
A aeries of stories which describe
displays of various valuable exhibits
that are kept at the Stanford Museum
has been written by William J. Mee
han, a Stanford student. The special
displays are shown in the "Feature
Case" arranged by Pedro J. Lemos,
director of the Museum and Art Gal
lery, in the lobby of the Museum.
The second of the series deals with
the "Christian Martyr," by Henner.
According to Meehan, "The picture is
a masterpiece for the same reason
that any painting coming from the
hands of Henner is a masterpiece. All
his paintings are masterpieces, and
more remarkable still is the fact that
he used only the simple colors of
black, brown, blue, white, and red. He
never used or experimented with col
ors as did Sir Joshua Reynolds, or
many of the old Masters of Venice.
Many of Henner's paintings are to
be seen only in the galleries of the
Petit Palais des Beaux Arts, Paris.
The secret of Henner's success lay
in a conscientious application of tech
nique in drawing before painting his
model; conscientiousness and genius
spelled Henner's fame. The portrait at
Stanford Museum is owned and loaned
by Mrs. Timothy Hopkins.
