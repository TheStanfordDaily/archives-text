Track fans are looking forward to
; many good battles when the four class
\ teams compete in the annual inter-
I class meet in the old oval at 1:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon. According
jto the dope, every event from the
100-yard dash to the javelin throw
i will be bitterly contested. Besides the
I varsity athletes who will compete,
j there are men who will be facing
! strong competition for the first time
I and have yet to prove their worth.
J The captains of the various inter-
I class teams have been announced as
! follows: McKlnnon, '29; Ranney, '28;
j Babcock, '27; and Miller, '26. If the

j be a wow from start to finish.
Storie Enters 220
In the furlong the competition will
be keen with Gaspar, Coverly, and
Storie. Storie, whose regular event i«
the 440, has plenty of speed that will
keep him up with the leaders in tho
i 220.
Gaspar, Zombro, and Babcock should
put up a good race in the century. All
| are ten-second men and are in lino
shape for early season. Captain Bill
Richardson will run in the quarter,
but should have little trouble winning
from Doerr and Dales, who have been
going fair this season.
Miller to Run Half
I Ted Miller will forsake his regular
440 event and run in the half mile
with McKinnon and McGuire opposing
him. Spencer, after a long lay-off from
1 track, will make a return appearance
in the low hurdles. He should win,
' even though Nichols and West have
; done good work already this season.
! Taking all the events together it
| should be well worth an afternoon's
time to see the meet tomorrow as
1 this is the first stiff competition of
1 the year. Track followers will bo
given an opportunity to compare Stan
ford's with teams it will meet later
in the year.
