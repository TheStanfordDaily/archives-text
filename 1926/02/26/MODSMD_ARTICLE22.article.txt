# An Interesting Week-End
## 
### 
Coach Jake Irwin's boxers take on the Davis Farm team in the pavilion
tonight in the curtain raiser of what promises to be an unusually interest
ing week-end for Cardinal sport followers. At 1:30 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon the annual interclass meet will officially usher in the 1926 track
season, and at 2:30 the varsity nine will take the field against the strong
Kenealy Seals, rated one of the best semi-pro teams in San Francisco.
The fights will probably draw a capacity crowd, because two weeks ago
the boxers did what no other Cardinal team had been able to do before,
win a tournament from the Aggies in their home ring. Showing that
they are no second-rate outfit, the Ags came back last week and took a
majority of Ixuits from the California varsity. If Irwin's men come out
on top tonight, as they are confident of doing, they could with good
reason be hailed as the champions of Northern California. Boxing has
recently made big gains in popularity at Stanford, and deserves all the
support it can get.
Though supremacy over an outside team is not at stake, the inter
class meet rates the spotlight liecause it will furnish the first real indica
tion of what can be expected from the varsity and freshman track squads
this season. Fans who have already doped the Big Meet are due to make
a few revisions in their charts. The interclass is traditionally full of
upsets.
Lack of support may have a lot to do with the inevitable slumps
which varsity ball clubs fall into shortly after the opening of each season.
Merely because Wolter's aggregation has dropped a couple of games is no
sign that it is in for a poor year. His varsities of the last two seasons
have looked pretty shaky in February and March games but have come
back to take the California series in April. Maybe when preliminary
games on the home diamond attract larger and more enthusiastic crowds
the men in uniforms will forget that there are such things as slumps.
