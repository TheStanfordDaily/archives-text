## THE 						RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO The 						Cactus Garden 
### Monroe Eaton – Letitia Lemon EPISODE VII 
I will not repeat all that happened
after I had been so frightened by the
face at the window. (I saw later that
there were, in fact, faces at all of the
windows. It seems that men who are
too honest to obtain a date by repre
senting themselves as blind, take
pleasure in looking on at dances from
the outside.)
John Smith did not ask me for an
other date although I might have con
sidered accepting one then. I was not
glad when the dance was over for I
had really almost enjoyed it. But of
that I will say no more.
In order that my readers may not
gain an altogether bad impression of
this university (the name of which is
too often mentioned not to be known)
I shall momentarily substitute a pleas
ant for a disagreeable subject and tell
you of the cactus gardens, the thought
of which always brings to me the hap
piest memories of my college days. (It
was here that I first came to know the
Rod Peril.)
I will not try to describe the place
in detail. (In fact I am not wholly ac
quainted with all of its intimacies.)
Whenever I went there (which 1 did
very often) I seemed to become a dif
ferent person. The cactus gardens are j
most beautiful by moonlight. (But of
that, more later).
