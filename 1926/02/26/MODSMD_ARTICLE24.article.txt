# HOW TO PASS THE SWIMMING TEST WITH WATER WINGS
## 
### 
Those who take the swimming test |

lifting it to the surface.
To accomplish this, purchase or ab
duct a pair of large water wings, a
cork (any kind), and a long piece of
rubber tubing, also a piece of string.
Refore taking the test tie the cork
to one end of the tubing so that it
will float on the surface of the water
and hide the deflated water wings,
tubing, and cork in your bathing suit.
Exhale and dive into the water.
Inhale and you will sink to the bot
tom. Find the weight and hold onto it.

end to rise to the surface and exhale j
the water in your lungs.
While still under the water draw
air through the tube and inflate the
wings by blowing air into them. (Be

sure that you are breathing air and
not water.)
Place the inflated wings about the
feet and rise to (he surface, taking the
weight with you. Be careful not to
show the instructor the inflated wings; i
