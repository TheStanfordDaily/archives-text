# SPORTS OF 1926
## Then and Now 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Track and field records have undergone such a change
in the last twenty-five years, that if an athlete of 1900
should suddenly return to civilization after a quarter of a
century at the north pole, he would recognize only one
mark! Maxey Long's world's record of 47 seconds for the
quarter mile, set at Guttenberg, N. J., on October 4, 1900,
is the only record that has been able to withstand a
twenty-five years' assault by the best athletes of the world.
Ted Meredith and Binga Desmond both ran a quarter of
a mile around one turn in 47 2-stlis seconds, which is cer
tainly as remarkable as Long's 47 flat on a straightaway
track, but nevertheless sprinters have often tried to better
it under like conditions, and Meredith could only equal it,
with a strong wind at his back, in 1915.
The records for the two sprint races, it will be ob
served, have been lowered by only three-fifths of a second.

That is quite natural, and yet we may expect some future Charley Paddock
to run the 100 in 'J 2-sths and the 220 in 20 2-sths before 1950. Nurmi's
records for the mile and, especially, the two-mile, are big steps ahead of
the 1900 records of Tommy Conneff and W. G. George. That famous timber
topper, Alvin Kraenzlein, held the former records for both the high and
low hurdles, and he was way ahead of his time as far as form went. Earl
Thompson's physique, plus an even superior hurdling form, enabled him to
go almost a full second faster than A1 in the 120-yard barrier event, while
Brookins' remarkable speed enabled him to break Kraenzlein's low hurdle
mark after it stood for twenty-five years.
It is in the field events that an even further progress is noticeable.
Look at the pole-vault, for instance. Even school boys think nothing of
clearing 11 feet, 10% inches, and there are nearly a dozen broad-jumpers
who have excelled Prinstein's record of 24 feet, 7inches. There was no
javelin throw record until 1908, and it must be remembered that since 1912
the discus throwers have had the advantage or an 8 foot, 2y 2 inch circle.
Whither are we drifting? Will the same rate of improvement be recorded
in the next quarter of a century? Will the champions of 1950 run the
two-mile in 8:39 2-sths and the high hurdles in 13 3-sths? Will they vault
15 feet, 8 inches in twenty-five years? Probably so.
