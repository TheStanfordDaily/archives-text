# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The point system as a means of
controlling and regulating women's
activities is about to come up before
the women of this University for ac
ceptance or rejection. Unless I am
laboring under a serious delusion, not
more than half of the women know
now which way they are going to vote.
I regret my belief that only a very
small number of the votes that are
cast will show any individual study of
the proposed system.
The plan was given considerable
publicity early this month and criti
cism invited. The women failed to re
spond, regardless of the fact that the
system, if installed, will vitally affect
their activities. Considerable interest
was shown last fall when such a sys
tem was first proposed. In fact, an
election proved a large majority of
the women to be willing to have a
system drawn up. The present indif
ference must be somewhat discourag
ing to those who are working for the
women's welfare, but then, I suppose,
it was ever thus. It is truly "the sort
of situation we deplore."
A few live opponents say that such
a system is against the ideals of the
University, but is it? The Stanfords
established this University with the
avowed purpose of preparing men and
women for useful public service and
individual happiness and success. It
seems to me that the point system is
in direct accord with such an ideal
rather than in opposition to it. The
point system proposes to concentrate
the efforts of each woman in a few
activities, preferably along one or two
lineß, thus making for complete suc
cess in those fields, rather than to
allow interests to become scattered at
the cost of efficiency.
The fundamental purpose of all ac
tivities is not to produce a winning
team or a perfect play or publication,
but to produce men and women who
will go out of the University better
trained for their work. As Dr. Jordan
recently remarked, "Students who
take up courses and activities hera
and there, quite indiscriminately, will
never amount to anything. Everything
that a student engages in should con
tribute to the advancement of his
chosen profession or personal happi
ness." May I second this plea for con
centration of interests!
It is proposed that the plan go into
effect for a three-year trial. It's the
old, old method of trial and error to
be sure, but in this case it is based
on weeks of careful study and investiga
tion by a capable committee. To me
it seems that the fair thing to do is to
try it out even as we "try out" every
thing and everybody else on the cam
pus.
Anyway, let's think this out for our
selves and vote according to our own
honest convictions.
I thank you! —A.8.C., '27.
The Editor, Sir:
A short time ago the switchboard
was taken out of the Union and the
phone service connected with the ex
change in Toyon. The purpose of this
change was to reduce expense and at
the same time to give better service
to the Union. Both purposes have been
accomplished in part, but the entire
service is cut off at 9:30 o'clock in
stead of 10:30 o'clock, as it had been
in the Union. That last hour was a i
busy one. It enabled those returning j
from the show to find out what was !
tomorrow's assignment. You could call
up and see whether that guy got your
best girl in without a lockout. It af-!
forded the best time to make thatj
date you get when you "Call me up,
some other time," and it was just the i
time to arrange that party to the city. \
Help! —*24.'

The Editor, Sir:
A short time ago the switchboard
was taken out of the Union and the
phone service connected with the ex
change in Toyon. The purpose of this
change was to reduce expense and at
the same time to give better service
to the Union. Both purposes have been
accomplished in part, but the entire
service is cut off at 9:30 o'clock in
stead of 10:30 o'clock, as it had been
in the Union. That last hour was a i
busy one. It enabled those returning j
from the show to find out what was !
tomorrow's assignment. You could call
up and see whether that guy got your
best girl in without a lockout. It af-!
forded the best time to make thatj
date you get when you "Call me up,
some other time," and it was just the i
time to arrange that party to the city. \
Help! —*24.'
The Editor, Sir:
The point system as a means of
controlling and regulating women's
activities is about to come up before
the women of this University for ac
ceptance or rejection. Unless I am
laboring under a serious delusion, not
more than half of the women know
now which way they are going to vote.
I regret my belief that only a very
small number of the votes that are
cast will show any individual study of
the proposed system.
The plan was given considerable
publicity early this month and criti
cism invited. The women failed to re
spond, regardless of the fact that the
system, if installed, will vitally affect
their activities. Considerable interest
was shown last fall when such a sys
tem was first proposed. In fact, an
election proved a large majority of
the women to be willing to have a
system drawn up. The present indif
ference must be somewhat discourag
ing to those who are working for the
women's welfare, but then, I suppose,
it was ever thus. It is truly "the sort
of situation we deplore."
A few live opponents say that such
a system is against the ideals of the
University, but is it? The Stanfords
established this University with the
avowed purpose of preparing men and
women for useful public service and
individual happiness and success. It
seems to me that the point system is
in direct accord with such an ideal
rather than in opposition to it. The
point system proposes to concentrate
the efforts of each woman in a few
activities, preferably along one or two
lineß, thus making for complete suc
cess in those fields, rather than to
allow interests to become scattered at
the cost of efficiency.
The fundamental purpose of all ac
tivities is not to produce a winning
team or a perfect play or publication,
but to produce men and women who
will go out of the University better
trained for their work. As Dr. Jordan
recently remarked, "Students who
take up courses and activities hera
and there, quite indiscriminately, will
never amount to anything. Everything
that a student engages in should con
tribute to the advancement of his
chosen profession or personal happi
ness." May I second this plea for con
centration of interests!
It is proposed that the plan go into
effect for a three-year trial. It's the
old, old method of trial and error to
be sure, but in this case it is based
on weeks of careful study and investiga
tion by a capable committee. To me
it seems that the fair thing to do is to
try it out even as we "try out" every
thing and everybody else on the cam
pus.
