"AIDA"—San Carlo Opera Company,
Civic Auditorium
A very creditable performance of
Verdi's famous opera was put on by
the San Carlo Opera Company. The
vastness of the Civic Auditorium
would tax the voice of any singer, and
the principals made themselves heard
effectively.
Blanca Saroya, soprano, as Aida,
and Manuel Salazar, tenor, as Ra
dames, were in good voice and man
aged to infuse a little dramatic feel
ing into the customary gestures. Rhea
Toniolo as the Princess Amneris dis
play some convincing emotion in the
closing scenes.
The "ballet" could have been omit
ted without much loss. The dancers
tried hard, but served only to detract
the listener's attention from the beau
ty of the music.
Several scenes were spectacular
from the sheer numbers on the stage
in costume. This was true of the sec
ond scene in Act 11, in which masses
of color and glittering armour were
displayed.
An effect bordering on the ridicu
lous resulted from the wholly illogical
make-up worn by Mario Valle as
Amonasro, King of the Ethiopians.
This gentleman, as father of the beau
teous Aida, was expected to be at least
presentable in appearance. Instead, he
was a sort of man-monkey, black in
color,- dressed in a tiger skin, and
wore a shark's tooth necklace. In gen
eral, Valle resembled a bushman rath
er than royalty, even if of darkest
Africa. The king, however, had a very
rich and satisfying baritone voice.
The orchestra, led by Carlo Peroni,
aided the singers in presenting some
of the famous arias of the opera in
memorable fashion. —H.A.K.
