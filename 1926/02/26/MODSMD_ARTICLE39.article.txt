# Lake Fleet Grows Slowly
## Red Canoes Predominate Swimmers Shun Icy Water 
### 
Lagunita's fleet in growing slowly
this year as compared to last. A year
ago there were more than forty sun
dry craft launched upon the muddy
water, but today there is but half
that number. Many of the various
living groups have not yet put their
canoes in commission until they have
renovated and decorated them with
a new color scheme.
The swimmers, too, are more In
different to the charms of the icy
water this year than they were last.
A few stragglers are seen daily in the
water, but they have not yet appeared
in noticeable numbers to seek relief
from the heat.
The lake, however, is showing
itself superior to the lake of a year
ago. The water is higher by approxi
mately three feet than it was last
year at this time. Swimmers report
that it is but little, if any, cleaner,
and very much colder.
Nearly one hundred men have suc
cessfully passed the stiff swimming
test that is required this year but
many are profiting by the ruling
which validates last year's test for
this season.
