# CARDINALS EXPECT HARD GAME WITH KENEALY'S OUTFIT
## Coach Wolter Aims to Raise Squad From Temporary Batting Slump 
### Herb Klein 
Stanford's varsity nine will meet the
Kenealy Seals on the varsity diamond
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
Harry Wolter's men will have a suffi
ciently big order to handle for the
Seals are among the two or three best
teams in the winter baseball league,
and according to reports, rate far
above any nine the Cardinals have yet
met.
The Seals are organized each year
by Neil Kenealy, master of the arts
of semi-pro baseball, and have played
Stanford for several seasons past. The
present team is one of the best that
has been turned out under the Kenealy
standard for some time.
After the mediocre showing made
against the Klawans and McMullins
team Wednesday, the varsity is far
from feeling any early-season overcon
fidence. The heavy hitting which was
one of the strong features of the
squad's work during the early practice
dwindled against the pitching of
Hutchinson, the lanky K & M twirler,
to one hit in nine innings. Batting will
be the thing, more than any other,
which Harry Wolter hopes to develop.
A temporary slump at this stage of
the game is not unusual in the game
of baseball as played on the Stanford
Farm.
Reynolds and Philippi are two
pitchers on Wolter's string who have
not yet had thorough workouts in
games. Philippi went in in the first
two games just long enough to throw
a few in the general direction of the
plate and then was succeeded by
Sobieski, who has shown the most
dependable form so far. Reynolds has
not been in any games.
