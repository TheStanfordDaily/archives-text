## 
### 
Husky Hunt's freshman baseball team
will meet the California Dental College
nine tomororvv morning at 10 o'clock,
on the fresman diamond. There is a pos
sibility that the sunken diamond will be
finished, and if such is the case, the game
will be played there.
The frosh beat Lowell High School
in San Francisco 2 to 0 in a rather ragged
game last week. Hunt says he has a good
team at fielding, but tliat they are rather
weak when it comes to hitting. Doug
Lewis will be the opening pitcher to
morrow. Lewis, together with Wilton and
Marks, was on last fall's football team.
Wilton plays second base.
The freshmen boast of a unique player
by the name of Davis. He can pitch
with either arm. All he has to do is
wind up with one hand, then let loose
with the other one. The man strikes,
and goes out, one-two-three. It is not
often that so accomplished a man is found
on a baseball team. It is usually hard
enough to find a man who can use one
arm well in a freshman squad.
