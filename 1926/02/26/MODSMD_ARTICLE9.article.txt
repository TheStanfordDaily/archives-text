# DISADVANTAGES OF TARIFF DISCOSSED BY DR. JORDAN
## Lack of Restrictions Between States Receives Praise Of Chancellor 
### 
"The great prosperity of America,"
declared Dr. Jordan in discussing com
merce last night, "has resulted from
the lack of tariff restrictions between
the states."
Drawing a parallel between condi
tions in this country and in Europe,
Dr. Jordan pointed out the conditions
of "cutthroat" tariff which has kept
the many European countries virtually
at swords' points. A favorite method
of killing off nations which have had
no access to the seas has been to get
a tariff combine of the surrounding
countries. The idea of extracting the
most money possible at the border
custom stations is thoroughly in
grained on the Continent, and the pres
sure engendered has often led to war.
"The main idea of tariff is to make
things scarce," said Dr. Jordan. "Origi
nally, the idea was to rob foreigners,
but more often it is the home people
who are robbed. A second purpose was
for promoting infant industries; but
now the infants are no longer young,
but exceedingly wealthy and powerful,
while half of the farmers of the nation
are on the verge of bankruptcy be
cause the tariff plays almost entirely
into the hands of big business."
"Thus," Dr. Jordan concluded, "the
whole tariff system has been built up
on fallacy. While the effects of re
stricting trade has been least harmful
in the United States of all countries,
the problem is one, nevertheless, that
has led to many difficulties, and is a
question that should be removed from
control of the political parties as soon
as possible."
