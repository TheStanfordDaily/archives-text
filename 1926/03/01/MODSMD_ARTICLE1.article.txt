# SENIORS NOSE OUT JUNIORS IN CLOSE INTERCLASS MEET
## EVANS BEATS HOFFMAN Coverley Wins Both Sprints In Fast Time; Proves Find of Day 
### Fred Swan 
Under the leadership of Bill Rich
ardson and Ted Miller the seniors
cleaned up the interclass track meet
Saturday. When the final result was
announced the seniors had 52 1-3
points, the juniors 49 2-3, the fresh
men 34, and the sophomores trailed
with 26 points.
Probably the most exciting race of
the day was the century. Eric Coverley
proved to the satisfaction of everyone
present that his victory over Louis
Caspar last week was no fluke. The
race was a hard one to judge, the men
finishing neck and neck. Coverley also
led Caspar to the tape in the furlong.
His time in the hundred was ten flat
.and in the 220, 22 1-5.
Richardson Wins
Captain Bill Richardson easily led
the 440 men to the tape in the fast
time of 49 2-5 seconds. Richardson
was not pressed or he might have
made even better time.
That Stanford will have plenty of
power in the high jump is evident
from the fact that West, Work, and
Muhs tied for first place at the height
of 6 feet 1 5-8 inches. Besides tteing in
the high jump, West won the low
hurdles and took second in the highs.
Discus Is Surprise
In the javelin throw Harlow reached
181 feet and took an easy first. Ted
Shipkey did not compete. One upset
in the weight events was Evan's vic
tory in the discus throw over Hoffman.
Biff's work in the shot and discus on
Saturday was far from his best, but
made it evident nevertheless that he
can be depended on for good work this
season as soon as he settles down.
Meeks won the broad jump with a
leap of 22 feet 11 1-4 inches. Dick Mac-
Rae, one of the mainstays on last '
year's team, was away off form and 1
did not place. The freshmen, by tak- 1
ing third, showed that they have a *
well-balanced team which has strong 1
possibilities of completing a success- 1
ful season. They were especially 1
strong in the running events.
The next event on the track program c
is the Irish Marathon which will be
held next Saturday.

During the recent carnival season
at New Orleans students at Tulane
University acted as ballyhoo men for
various sight-seeing companies.
Under the leadership of Bill Rich
ardson and Ted Miller the seniors
cleaned up the interclass track meet
Saturday. When the final result was
announced the seniors had 52 1-3
points, the juniors 49 2-3, the fresh
men 34, and the sophomores trailed
with 26 points.
Probably the most exciting race of
the day was the century. Eric Coverley
proved to the satisfaction of everyone
present that his victory over Louis
Caspar last week was no fluke. The
race was a hard one to judge, the men
finishing neck and neck. Coverley also
led Caspar to the tape in the furlong.
His time in the hundred was ten flat
.and in the 220, 22 1-5.
Richardson Wins
Captain Bill Richardson easily led
the 440 men to the tape in the fast
time of 49 2-5 seconds. Richardson
was not pressed or he might have
made even better time.
That Stanford will have plenty of
power in the high jump is evident
from the fact that West, Work, and
Muhs tied for first place at the height
of 6 feet 1 5-8 inches. Besides tteing in
the high jump, West won the low
hurdles and took second in the highs.
Discus Is Surprise
In the javelin throw Harlow reached
181 feet and took an easy first. Ted
Shipkey did not compete. One upset
in the weight events was Evan's vic
tory in the discus throw over Hoffman.
Biff's work in the shot and discus on
Saturday was far from his best, but
made it evident nevertheless that he
can be depended on for good work this
season as soon as he settles down.
Meeks won the broad jump with a
leap of 22 feet 11 1-4 inches. Dick Mac-
Rae, one of the mainstays on last '
year's team, was away off form and 1
did not place. The freshmen, by tak- 1
ing third, showed that they have a *
well-balanced team which has strong 1
possibilities of completing a success- 1
ful season. They were especially 1
strong in the running events.
The next event on the track program c
is the Irish Marathon which will be
held next Saturday.

During the recent carnival season
at New Orleans students at Tulane
University acted as ballyhoo men for
various sight-seeing companies.
Under the leadership of Bill Rich
ardson and Ted Miller the seniors
cleaned up the interclass track meet
Saturday. When the final result was
announced the seniors had 52 1-3
points, the juniors 49 2-3, the fresh
men 34, and the sophomores trailed
with 26 points.
Probably the most exciting race of
the day was the century. Eric Coverley
proved to the satisfaction of everyone
present that his victory over Louis
Caspar last week was no fluke. The
race was a hard one to judge, the men
finishing neck and neck. Coverley also
led Caspar to the tape in the furlong.
His time in the hundred was ten flat
.and in the 220, 22 1-5.
Richardson Wins
Captain Bill Richardson easily led
the 440 men to the tape in the fast
time of 49 2-5 seconds. Richardson
was not pressed or he might have
made even better time.
That Stanford will have plenty of
power in the high jump is evident
from the fact that West, Work, and
Muhs tied for first place at the height
of 6 feet 1 5-8 inches. Besides tteing in
the high jump, West won the low
hurdles and took second in the highs.
Discus Is Surprise
In the javelin throw Harlow reached
181 feet and took an easy first. Ted
Shipkey did not compete. One upset
in the weight events was Evan's vic
tory in the discus throw over Hoffman.
Biff's work in the shot and discus on
Saturday was far from his best, but
made it evident nevertheless that he
can be depended on for good work this
season as soon as he settles down.
Meeks won the broad jump with a
leap of 22 feet 11 1-4 inches. Dick Mac-
Rae, one of the mainstays on last '
year's team, was away off form and 1
did not place. The freshmen, by tak- 1
ing third, showed that they have a *
well-balanced team which has strong 1
possibilities of completing a success- 1
ful season. They were especially 1
strong in the running events.
The next event on the track program c
is the Irish Marathon which will be
held next Saturday.
