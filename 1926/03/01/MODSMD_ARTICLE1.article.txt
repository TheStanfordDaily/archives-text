# SENIORS NOSE OUT JUNIORS IN CLOSE INTERCLASS MEET
## EVANS BEATS HOFFMAN Coverley Wins Both Sprints In Fast Time; Proves Find of Day 
### Fred Swan 
Under the leadership of Bill Rich
ardson and Ted Miller the seniors
cleaned up the interclass track meet
Saturday. When the final result was
announced the seniors had 52 1-3
points, the juniors 49 2-3, the fresh

Muhs tied for first place at the height

Saturday was far from his best, but
made it evident nevertheless that he

season as soon as he settles down.
Meeks won the broad jump with a
