# Stanford Fighters Beat Davis Farm In Second Bouts
## 
### 
Coach Jake Irwin's varsity boxers
for the second time took the Califor
nia Agricultural College men into
camp last Friday evening in the pa
vilion, this time winning five of the
seven scheduled bouts. The Cardinal
men had previously upset all prece
dent in whipping the Davis Farm
boxers, four bouts to three, in the
match held in their opponents' ring.
Harry Stevenson proved the sur
prise of the evening, fully avenging
his former kayo defeat at the hands
of Captain Marv Miller, the Card wel
terweight winning the judges' decision
after three rounds of close fighting.
The pair fought cautiously, clinching
often, but Stevenson won the bout by
virtue of several clean blows near the
end of the second round.
Collins Wins Again
Marion Collins, diminutive Stanford
veteran of 1925, easily decisioned his
opponent, Lion Gomez, in the first bout
of the evening. The two fought slowly
for the bantamweight class, with the
Stanford boxer taking every advan
tage of his opponent's openings, ad
vancing relentlessly to land many
hard blows.
Captain Myron Schall won a tech
nical knockout over Don Eveleth in
the feature bout of the program. The
Davis middleweight was unimpressed
by the Stanford captain's formidable
record, rushing Schall and doing his
utmost to whip his rangy opponent.
Schall was awarded a technical knock
out in the second round when the
Aggie man showed the effects of his
opponent's heavy hammering to the
face and body.
Gomez Brothers Win
The famous Gomez twins of Davis
gave their team its only wins, A1
Gomez, intercollegiate featherweight
champ, again getting the decision from
Carlos Miron, and Don winning over
Ross of Stanford for the lightweight
victory. Miron fought a cautious,
clever battle, always being the aggres
sor, and the judges were unable to
agree upon the winner. The champion
was favored by the referee.
Don Gomez clearly outpointed Ross,
a newcomer on the Stanford varsity,
and deserved the decision. His clever
blocking of his opponent's blows made
the Stanford man's attempts to con
nect appear futile.
Norman Fain, sophomore light
heavyweight, again showed that he is
one of the cleverest of the Stanford
squad, and clearly out-fought Farr, his
Davis opponent. The heavyweight
match was forfeited to Stanford, giv
ing the Card boxers a five to seven
victory.
The double win over the California
Aggies boosts the Stanford varsity to
a pinnacle which they have seldom
before reached. Davis has always pro
duced one of the strongest teams of
the coast, this year being the only oc
casion when Stanford has defeated
them twice. California fell a victim to
the Davis men last week, leaving the
Card seven a decided favorite over
the Bears.
The next match scheduled will be
with the Olympic Club next Friday in
the pavilion.

opponent, Lion Gomez, in the first bout
of the evening. The two fought slowly
for the bantamweight class, with the
Stanford boxer taking every advan
tage of his opponent's openings, ad
vancing relentlessly to land many
hard blows.
Captain Myron Schall won a tech
nical knockout over Don Eveleth in
the feature bout of the program. The
Davis middleweight was unimpressed
by the Stanford captain's formidable
record, rushing Schall and doing his
utmost to whip his rangy opponent.
Schall was awarded a technical knock
out in the second round when the
Aggie man showed the effects of his
opponent's heavy hammering to the
face and body.
Gomez Brothers Win
The famous Gomez twins of Davis
gave their team its only wins, A1
Gomez, intercollegiate featherweight
champ, again getting the decision from
Carlos Miron, and Don winning over
Ross of Stanford for the lightweight
victory. Miron fought a cautious,
clever battle, always being the aggres
sor, and the judges were unable to
agree upon the winner. The champion
was favored by the referee.
Don Gomez clearly outpointed Ross,
a newcomer on the Stanford varsity,
and deserved the decision. His clever
blocking of his opponent's blows made
the Stanford man's attempts to con
nect appear futile.
Norman Fain, sophomore light
heavyweight, again showed that he is
one of the cleverest of the Stanford
squad, and clearly out-fought Farr, his
Davis opponent. The heavyweight
match was forfeited to Stanford, giv
ing the Card boxers a five to seven
victory.
The double win over the California
Aggies boosts the Stanford varsity to
a pinnacle which they have seldom
before reached. Davis has always pro
duced one of the strongest teams of
the coast, this year being the only oc
casion when Stanford has defeated
them twice. California fell a victim to
the Davis men last week, leaving the
Card seven a decided favorite over
the Bears.
The next match scheduled will be
with the Olympic Club next Friday in
the pavilion.
Coach Jake Irwin's varsity boxers
for the second time took the Califor
nia Agricultural College men into
camp last Friday evening in the pa
vilion, this time winning five of the
seven scheduled bouts. The Cardinal
men had previously upset all prece
dent in whipping the Davis Farm
boxers, four bouts to three, in the
match held in their opponents' ring.
Harry Stevenson proved the sur
prise of the evening, fully avenging
his former kayo defeat at the hands
of Captain Marv Miller, the Card wel
terweight winning the judges' decision
after three rounds of close fighting.
The pair fought cautiously, clinching
often, but Stevenson won the bout by
virtue of several clean blows near the
end of the second round.
Collins Wins Again
Marion Collins, diminutive Stanford
veteran of 1925, easily decisioned his
opponent, Lion Gomez, in the first bout
of the evening. The two fought slowly
for the bantamweight class, with the
Stanford boxer taking every advan
tage of his opponent's openings, ad
vancing relentlessly to land many
hard blows.
