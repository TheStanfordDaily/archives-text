# Stanford Fighters Beat Davis Farm In Second Bouts
## 
### 
Coach Jake Irwin's varsity boxers
for the second time took the Califor
nia Agricultural College men into
camp last Friday evening in the pa
vilion, this time winning five of the
seven scheduled bouts. The Cardinal
men had previously upset all prece
dent in whipping the Davis Farm
boxers, four bouts to three, in the
match held in their opponents' ring.
Harry Stevenson proved the sur
prise of the evening, fully avenging
his former kayo defeat at the hands
of Captain Marv Miller, the Card wel

Davis middleweight was unimpressed

Aggie man showed the effects of his
opponent's heavy hammering to the
face and body.
Gomez Brothers Win
The famous Gomez twins of Davis
gave their team its only wins, A1
Gomez, intercollegiate featherweight
champ, again getting the decision from
Carlos Miron, and Don winning over
Ross of Stanford for the lightweight
victory. Miron fought a cautious,
clever battle, always being the aggres

agree upon the winner. The champion
was favored by the referee.
Don Gomez clearly outpointed Ross,
a newcomer on the Stanford varsity,
and deserved the decision. His clever
blocking of his opponent's blows made
the Stanford man's attempts to con
nect appear futile.
Norman Fain, sophomore light
heavyweight, again showed that he is
