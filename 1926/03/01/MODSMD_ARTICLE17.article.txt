# WOMEN'S POINT SYSTEM WILL BE DEEDED UPON TOMORROW
## Polls Open From 8:45 Until 2 O'clock at Women's Clubhouse 
### 
Polls for the Women's Point System
will be open from 8:45 tomorrow
morning until 2 o'clock in the after
noon in front of the Women's Club
house. If the proposed system is
passed the plan will be adopted for a
trial period of three years.
The Point System is an attempt to
control women's activities so as to
benefit the school, the organizations,
and the individual herself. The fin
ished products of months of investiga
tion on the part of the Point System
Committee will efficiently regulate
women's activities so as to prevent
over-burdening a small group of wo
men with too many offices.
By actually interviewing the women
in the various school offices the com
mittee was able to discover just how
much a woman could handle and do
well. The groupings were made after
this careful survey of activities as to
the time and amount of work each
position takes in relation to others. It
is based on a comparative scale drawn
up by people who studied each posi
tion thoroughly.
The fate of the Point System will
be determined tomorrow. If adopted,
it will go into effect next fall for the
trial period of three years. The women
are all urged to vote on the Point Sys
tem after they have first studied the
plan in detail.
