# Tomorrow's Election
## 
### 
Tomorrow the women of the University will decide whether or not
they wish to have their participation in activities governed by a point sys
tem. The proposed plan, as it will appear on the ballots, has been given
considerable publicity; and sufficient time has been allotted for the forma
tion of a thoughtful conclusion.
The editor rather imagined that the preliminary campaign would be
heated ; but such has not been the case. If this means that the women have
formed their opinions individually, their political system is to be admired.
If the plan is being taken lightly, it is unfortunate, for the issue is import
ant, and is one that should be neither condemned nor supported before the
facts are carefully weighed.
To pass, the system must receive a two-thirds majority of the votes
cast. It will be regrettable if only a few straggling ballots are marked and
the plan is rejected or accepted without sufficient representation. The re
sult should be indicative of the opinion of the entire women's student body.
