# Stanford's Backing

Reprinted below is a news item from the Daily Californian which,
although it is prefaced rather distastefully, ends up with a real Cardinal
punch:
SING OF WASHINGTON? NO! SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
STANFORDITE IS SILENT
Californians now know the secret of Stanford's occasional
victories over the Blue and Gold in athletic contests. It is not
strategy, nor is it stealth. It is loyalty, but not of any ordinary
kind.
Rix Maurer Jr., son of Mr. and Mrs. Rix Maurer of Ala
meda, is only seven years old but already plans to attend Stan
ford and is working hard in school to get through the educa
tional preliminaries as soon as possible.
Rix Maurer, age seven, is working very hard in grammar
school so that he may attend Stanford as soon as possible. His
father stroked Stanford crews and played football when he was
"down on the farm." Young Rix knows and is proud of Stan
ford's athletic record. He knows who won the 1925 Big Game
and he sorrowed over the Cardinal's defeat at the hands of the
Washington Huskies last year.
Last Friday Rix had something out of the ordinary run of
school affairs to report to his parents.
"We put our books away early and they sang something al>out
Washington," he said at the dinner table. "But I did'nt sing
a word."
"That wasn't very patriotic," said his mother. "Why didn't
you sing too?"
"But mother," he asked in a puzzled tone, "ain't I supposed
to be for Stanford all the time?"
THE DAILY PALO ALTO EDITORIAL STAFF will meet in the
Daily office at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Utter triumph of democracy at the University of Nebraska as noted in
the Nebraska Daily:
"More than a hundred girls, members of four sororities, have comc to the aid of
their boy friends and announced that they will refuse to go on dates with any men
who rent cars."
Progress of freedom and morality at the University of Indiana:
"The dance at the Student Building was stopped abruptly by Walter Perterson,
campus policeman, at the end of the second dance last night when several couples were
chargcd with having been performing the Cliarleston contrary to the ruling of the
University trustees."
