DIRTY FIBRE
"I say," cried the rough-woven herring
bone coat,
"It looks like I'm nothing at all hut
the goat.
I'm a good-looking guy,
Which no one can deny—
Yet I'm down in the mouth —it's a hell
of a note!
"I'm telling you now I deserve some
attention,
It isn't quite fair for one coat I could
mention,
To get all the pleasure—
Division of treasure
Would satisfy me as regards this con
vention!

Why is it that ladies who feel they
must cry
Retain their salt tear-drops until they
espy
Two arms and chest
Where they hasten to rest
Their faces on rough tweed —'tis this
I decry!
'Tisn't fair for old Tweed to get all
of the fun;
He isn't the only cont under the sun!
They adore him—he's rough!
Well, I'm quite rough enough,
And these cave-mannish tactics don't
please everyone!
Rut the ladies are foolish, and think
what they need
Is the advertised value of roughness—
indeed!
If they'd only try me,

They would very soon see
That I'm equal in value to any old
Tweed! —L.A.B.

In accordance witn a policy of al
ways being intensely interested in all
intellectual affairs of the campus, Cab
bages feels a moral obligation to cry
out to the world the semi-inebriated
spelling of the members of the Fresh
man Class.
The following words were spelled
in the following queer ways by the
Charlestoning cheribims of our much
ly-touted Freshman Class:
For "discretion" we find "discis
sion." for "courtesy," "curtisy," while
citizens frequently went to the "poles"
to vote.
.mu extra syllable or two seems to
mean nothing to our ambitions fresh
men. For instance, "initiative" was
spelled "iniative," and "initiative,"
and "nitive" and "inititive."
Some other bright boners were
"liinderance," "privilegdes," "suffer
age," "controll," "polocies," "well
fare," "concidered," "cantidate," and
"critisize.'
But the worlds champion speller is I

I the bright little girl in the front row
who insists on writing glibly about
the wonderful work of our immortal
"Supream Court."
Publication of the literary supple
ment to the Daily Illini was ordered
suspended because the editors used
"immature judgment in publishing li
belous material."
