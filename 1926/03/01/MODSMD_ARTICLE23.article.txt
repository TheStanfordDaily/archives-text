# SPORTS OF 1926
## A 						Son of Sparta 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
A son of Theseus will be seen in action tonight, when
Phil McGraw, of Greece, meets Stanislaus Loyaza, of Chile,
in a New York City benefit show. Theseus, according to
Greek mythology, was the father of boxing. That was
away back in the days when the fights were held on Mt.
Olympus instead of in Madison Square Garden. Zeus was
the Tex Rickard of the time, and Homer the first boxing
writer. And the men of Greece were athletes all, instead
of bootblacks, fruit stand operators, restaurant keepers,
and florists.
Now comes Phil McGraw, a young florist of Detroit,
who is doing a lot to revive the athletic glory that was
Greece's. McGraw's real name is Kamanos, or Karmonas,
or Karamanoz, whichever you prefer. But no matter how
you spell or pronounce it, here at last is a Greek fighter,
and one quite good enough to bring back memories of

Pollux, son of Zeus, the first boxer, and of Theagenes of Thasos, the greatest
fighter of antiquity, who won 1,400 contests.
Phil MeGraw, however, will not fight with the caestus, the boxing glove
worn by his ancestors. The caestus Avas made of leather and iron, and was
worn in the days of the first Olympic Games, around 500 8.C., when boxers
fought to the death. Phil MeGraw may feel like calling on Theseus tonight
to turn his gloves into caesti, if his opponent from Chile should make the
going too tough for him, but from the showing that he has made in his previ
ous encounters, Mr. Klamanos is well able to take care of himself.
Phil Mc.Graw was ranked seventh in Tex Rickard's list of the leading
lightweights of the world. But he has beaten Luis Vincentini, whom Tex
placed in sixth position, and fought a draw with Sammy Mandell, who heads
the great promoter's list.
March will certainly come in like a lion tonight, when Greece meets Chile
in fistic combat.
