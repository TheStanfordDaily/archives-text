# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
The women's point system that is
to be voted upon tomorrow is not in
keeping with the tendencies of the
University. The University has felt
that the students should have as much
freedom as possible, and have re
moved the rule preventing students
on probation from entering activities.
Why should the women turn around
and restrict in their activities even
those women who are meeting satis
factorily the scholastic requirement?? j
No set of rules can decide how j
much work an individual woman can |
do well. The point system will be lim-1
iting the very women whom the l.Jni-i
versity is encouraging to woric and ■
get the most out of the University.
The activities would not gain from !
the point system either.
Organizations would rather have an i
efficient person who can handle two i
jobs rather than a less efficient per
son for each job. Why should a woman
who has shown through competitive
tryouts in two activities that, while
working for both she does the best |
work in each field, be kept from hav- 1
ing both positions? The activities
won't thank the point system for tak
ing away from them those they think
test capable to carry the position.
We are college women, not kinder.-
garten pupils. When we are finished
college we will have no one to take
care of us and tell us how much we
are capable of doing. College should |
be training for the world, not a se-1
eluded spot where one is looked after i
and helped to exist. —X.Y.Z.
