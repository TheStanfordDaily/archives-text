# BABES WIN FROM JUNIORS IN CLASS BASEBALL CONTEST
## Yearlings Score Eight Runs in Early Innings to Win Ball Game 
### 
Scoring eight runs in the first two
innings, the freshman baseball team
defeated the juniors 8 to 3 in an inter
class tilt played Friday on the fresh
man field. Wildness on the part of
the juniors' pitcher, coupled with some
opportune hitting on the part of the
freshmen, was responsible for the
early scoring.
Spud Harder pitched a steady game
for the freshmen and was never in
danger of losing control of the situa
tion. His first inning was without a
daw; he struck out Harold, Compton,
and Morrill in succession. All told, he
fanned seven of his adversaries, dur
ing the six-inning game, which is an
average of over one an inning. He also
limited the class of 1927 to three
scattered hits and a single walk.
Hunter Goes Well
For some unknown reason the jun
iors elected not to start their regular
pitcher, and by the time Hunter
started the score was 8 to 0. Hunter
managed to hold the freshmen score
less for the last four innings, striking
out one, walking one, and allowing
three hits, but the damage had been
done. Morrill, who started, is not a
pitcher, but an infielder. He was quite
wild, allowing six walks in two in
nings, besides two hits.
Brown, freshman catcher, proved to
be the hitting star of the game, lacing
out three solid blows out of four times
at bat, one of which was a home run.
Hartly, diminutive 1929 team second
baseman, played a bang-up game on
the defense, besides being robbed of
a clean outfield single by the lazy
base-running of Marks, who was put
out at second, thus turning the hit
into a fielders' choice.
1929 Starts Early
Two passes started the frosh off in
the first inning toward a score, which,
followed by two sacrifices by McKee
and Harder, scored Hartley with the
first run. A single by Brown brought
in Rogers, and an error by the short
stop gave Wright first base. After
they had advanced to second and
third, Southworth, junior catcher,
missed the third strike and in the
melee that followed Wilton reached
first and both Brown and Wright
scored. McCandless ended the inning
with a grounder to Harold, second
baseman, who tossed him out at first.
Marks popped out to Sheets to open
the second stanza for the freshmen.
After Hartley had flied out to the
centerfielder, the pitcher grew wild
and filled the bags with a trio of
passes to Rogers, McKee, and Harder.
Brown then emptied the sacks with a
homer over the centerfielder's head to
bring the class of 1929's total to eight
runs. This ended the freshmen's scor
ing for the day.

out at second, thus turning the hit
into a fielders' choice.
1929 Starts Early
Two passes started the frosh off in
the first inning toward a score, which,
followed by two sacrifices by McKee
and Harder, scored Hartley with the
first run. A single by Brown brought
in Rogers, and an error by the short
stop gave Wright first base. After
they had advanced to second and
third, Southworth, junior catcher,
missed the third strike and in the
melee that followed Wilton reached
first and both Brown and Wright
scored. McCandless ended the inning
with a grounder to Harold, second
baseman, who tossed him out at first.
Marks popped out to Sheets to open
the second stanza for the freshmen.
After Hartley had flied out to the
centerfielder, the pitcher grew wild
and filled the bags with a trio of
passes to Rogers, McKee, and Harder.
Brown then emptied the sacks with a
homer over the centerfielder's head to
bring the class of 1929's total to eight
runs. This ended the freshmen's scor
ing for the day.
Scoring eight runs in the first two
innings, the freshman baseball team
defeated the juniors 8 to 3 in an inter
class tilt played Friday on the fresh
man field. Wildness on the part of
the juniors' pitcher, coupled with some
opportune hitting on the part of the
freshmen, was responsible for the
early scoring.
Spud Harder pitched a steady game
for the freshmen and was never in
danger of losing control of the situa
tion. His first inning was without a
daw; he struck out Harold, Compton,
and Morrill in succession. All told, he
fanned seven of his adversaries, dur
ing the six-inning game, which is an
average of over one an inning. He also
limited the class of 1927 to three
scattered hits and a single walk.
Hunter Goes Well
For some unknown reason the jun
iors elected not to start their regular
pitcher, and by the time Hunter
started the score was 8 to 0. Hunter
managed to hold the freshmen score
less for the last four innings, striking
out one, walking one, and allowing
three hits, but the damage had been
done. Morrill, who started, is not a
pitcher, but an infielder. He was quite
wild, allowing six walks in two in
nings, besides two hits.
Brown, freshman catcher, proved to
be the hitting star of the game, lacing
out three solid blows out of four times
at bat, one of which was a home run.
Hartly, diminutive 1929 team second
baseman, played a bang-up game on
the defense, besides being robbed of
a clean outfield single by the lazy
base-running of Marks, who was put
out at second, thus turning the hit
into a fielders' choice.
