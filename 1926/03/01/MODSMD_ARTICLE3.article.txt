# "GREEN GODDESS" SEATS OFFERED TO PLAYGOERS
## 
### Frank Baker 
Seat sale for "The Green Goddess"
opens at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
in the lobby of the Old Union. In spite
of the huge expenditure involved in
making sets and procuring costumes
for this play the prices of tickets will
remain at the usual sums of 75 cents
and $1.
In respect to staging and costuming
"The Green Goddess" will surpass
anything attempted this year, and bids
fair to outrank the

work on "Macbeth"
last year. Several
of the sets for
"Macbeth" were
given full-page cuts
in the most promi
nent theater maga
zines of the coun
try, and have been
considered as ex
ceptionally con
structive work. An

entirely new at-
Gordon Davis mosphere is given
in this year's play,
as its setting is in India and allows

for rich and unique sets.
"The Green Goddess" will be Gor
don Davis' last show until the Sum
mer quarter, as he is leaving immedi
ately after the performance for New
York City. Davis makes an annual trip
to New York to get the latest word in
drama and to keep up in all its fields.
He lines up plays for the coming year,
and by being on the spot he can get
much better and later productions. On
several occasions he has been able
to produce shows here before they
have been played in the West by pro
fessionals.
Since the addition of the minor
members of the cast, work on the
play has gotten into full swing. The
integration of many individual charac
ters speeds up the action considerably
and will hold interest in the plot. In
one scene the whole stage is fiilled
with natives speaking in their own
tongue. It should be particularly in
spiring, with the weird and dimly
lighted stage, and the mystery of an
unknown tongue. The pantomine is
unusually effective.
