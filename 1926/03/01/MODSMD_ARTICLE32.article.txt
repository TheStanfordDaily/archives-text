# PALO ALTO SOCIETY GETS YOUNG PIANIST AS RECITAL SOLOIST
## 
### 
Gitta Gradova, young pianist, who
has been acclaimed a genius by critics,
will be soloist with the Palo Alto
Morris Club in a combined choral and
instrumental concert to be given to
morrow evening in the First Method
ist Church in Palo Alto. Miss Gradova
is American trained and has won
highest praise from musicians in the
East.
Deems Taylor, of the New York
World, one of the most discriminating
of critics, wrote, "Gradova has talent
and personality enough to raise her
above the rank and file. She has an
exceptionally powerful and sensitively
colored tone."
The Morris Club gives three con
certs each year of which this is the
second. Warren D. Allen, University
organist, is conductor of the organiza
tion which is made up of Palo Alto
men.
Admission to the concert will be by
membership ticket only, but arrange
ments for associate memberships good
for two or four tickets can be made
at the door on the evening of the
concert.
