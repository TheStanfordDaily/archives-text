## 
### 
The.freshman tennis team defeated
the Palo Alto High School on the
Stanford courts last Saturday morning
with the loss of but one set.
John Wheatley, playing No. 1 on the
babe team, had considerable difficulty
with Harry Plymier, who forced the
first set to deuce games, 7-5, and the
second set to 6-3. Wheatley carried his
attack to the net, where his erratic
volleying prolonged the issue. Plymier
produced good forehand drives and
several craftly lobs in the pinches, and
with his opponent's errors was able to
make the match close.
David Robb also encountered compe
tition in Frank Erlin. Erlin took an
early lead, winning the first three
games, but Robb dropped a few of his
nhots inside and ran out the set 6-3.
In the second set Erlin again assumed
a three-game lead only to see it melt
away again as Robb extended himself
to win 6-3.
Ernest Renzel made quick work of
Victor Ricketts. The first set went at
6-2 and the second at 6-0. Ricketts tried
hard for everything, but he was un
able to cope with the steady play of
his opponent, who nicked the corners
in steady style.
In the first doubles match Wheatley
and Robb easily conquered Erlin and
Clay Miller 6-1, 6-0. Plymier and Rick
etts, as second doubles team for the
visitors, put up a stiff resistance. They
won the first set 6-3 from Renzel and
Kenneth Howard, who by their own
poor play contributed largely to their
loss. In the second and third sets, the
Stanford team brought out enough
good shots to win the match 3-6, 6-4,
6-2.
