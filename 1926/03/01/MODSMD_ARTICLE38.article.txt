# STANFORD Y. M. C. A. GIVEN WIDE NOTICE FOR RESEARCH WORK
## 
### 
State-wide recognition has been
given the Staiit'ord Young Men's Asso
ciation lately as a result of a research
program being put on by the Associa
tion's Boys' Work Committee, under
the direction of Neal Sooy, chairman,
and Ben Culver, associate secretary.
The committee has formed seven
groups in Palo Alto, and is conducting
experiments in the psychological re
actions of boys between the ages of
nine and fifteen.
The research plan has been tried
out in several other universities,
among them California, but Occidental
and Stanford are the only ones so far
who have carried it out in a successful
manner. W. H. Conklin, state chair
man of the Boys' Work Committee, is
the author of the plan, and he has
given much attention to the way the
Stanford "Y" is following it out.
One of the high lights of the pro
gram of the local organization was
the recent "Stunt Night" given for all
boys between the ages of nine and
fifteen, at which over a hundred were
entertained. Several more such gath
rings are being considered. A weekly
paper, devoted to local boys' clubs
affairs, is to be issued by the commit
tee. George Atkinson is editing it and
the first number is booked for March
4. The local association has also sent
delegates to recent Hi-Y conferences,
Neal Sooy and Ben Culver having at
tended the Northern California Older
Boys' Conference at Sacramento, Feb
ruary 13-14, and the county conference
at San Jose last week-end.
Results gleaned from the experi
ments will be consolidated and for
warded to the State Boys' Work Com
mittee in June, for their use in making
out leaders' manuals. Earlier conclu
sions will be presented by Ben Culver
at a Creative Conference to be held
in Santa Barbara, March 14-16, for
boys' york secretaries. An award is
to be given for the most constructive
piece of material submitted to the
State Y.M.C.A. According to Conklin,
the Stanford men have a fine chance
to win the prize.
Members of the committee are: Neal
Sooy (chairman), John Way, George
Atkinson, Phill Wells, Wayne Galliher,
Robert Lundy, and Ben Culver, ad
visor.
