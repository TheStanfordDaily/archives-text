# FRESHMEN CONQUER U.C. DENTAL NINE IN FAST CONTEST
## Babes Make Only One Error; Hartley Goes Well in Field Work 
### Gordon French 
In a well-played nip-and-tuck contest,
the freshman team nosed out the Uni
versity of California Dental College
nine 6 to 5. The game was replete
with rallies and it was a two-run rally
in the sixth inning that decided the
tilt.
The Stanford freshmen made only
one error in the nine innings. Many
difficult chances were taken care of
in good style. Perhaps the oustanding
fielder was Hartley, who handled the
ball with skill and preccision. The
Dental College nine helped bring de
feat on itself by growing erratic in
decisive moments, making five errors
in all.
Pitchers Work Well
The pitching on both sides was good.
Zappetini, who worked the whole
game for the losers, allowed only
eight hits and was responsible for
four of the winners' six scores, the
other tallies coming on account of
errors. Kern for Stanford held the
opposition well in hand until the fifth
stanza. Then Lewis took his place
and held the dentists to no runs and
one hit in the last four innings, be
sides fanning four of his opponents.
Slugger Injured
Brown, who has been the hardest
and most consistent batter on the 1929
team, after lacing out two hits and
driving in a pair of runs in his first
two times at bat, sprained his finger
and will be out for at least a week.
The U.C. dentists started off strong
in the first inning and scored a pair
of tallies on a trio of passes and a
single. The freshmen tied the score
in the third inning when Brown hit a
single to center field, scoring Rogers
and Harder, who had gotten on by
errors.
Stanford Rallies
The final tallies came in the sixth
inning when the freshmen won the
game. Davis opened with a triple to
right, Kern walked, and Hartley sacri
ficed, scoring Davis. Rogers hit a
grounder to the pitcher, who hesitated
and threw wild to third to let Kern
score.
