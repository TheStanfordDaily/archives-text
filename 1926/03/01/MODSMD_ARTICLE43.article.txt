# Northwestern University Stops Student Marriages
## 
### 
"A contract of impermanent love"
has been adopted by students at North
western University in response to a
faculty ruling that expulsion will fol
low any student marriages.
The "contract" provides for the
party of the first part to avow his "im
permanent" love and affection for the
party of the second part in return for
her corresponding love and affection.
The party of the second part agrees
to provide a satisfactory number of
evenings at home with a minimum
amount of illumination. The masculine
party agrees to assume full duties as
escort on all occasions. "Friendship
ceases with the termination of the
agreement" is also an interesting
clause.
Thus have the students of North
western "legalized" petting parties.
