# VASSAR SETS ASIDE ROOMS FOR SMOKING
## 
### 
One more woman's college has fol
lowed the lead of Bryn Mawr in per
mitting student smoking on the cam
pus. By a large majority the self-gov
erning student association at Vassar
voted to allow smokers the use of two
rooms in the student building. The
resolution added that "it is still the
desire of the student body that you
do not exercise this liberty."
The action was taken in considera
tion of the growing number of girls
whosp parents find no objection to
their use of tobacco.
Students at lowa State College ob
ject to their noon hour being cut from
80 to 60 minutes.
