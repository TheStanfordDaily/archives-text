### 
Tickets for the Founders' Day con-1
cert will be distributed Wenesday in !
the lobby of the Administration build- j
ing. Classes will be held as usual on i
Founders' Day, March 9, but a sacred i
concert will be given in the Memorial!
Church, as was done last year.
The limited number of seats in the '
church has necessitated that tickets
be restricted to students, officers of
the University, and alumni. Ticket
distribution will go on from 8 o'clock
in the morning until 5 o'clock in the ;
afternoon on Wednesday. All holders
of student body cards will be entitled
to one ticket. Faculty members will
receive two seats.
Hertz Is Leader
The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, under the leadership of Al-;
fred Hertz, played here for Founders' j
Day three years ago and again last j
year. The Memorial Church makes a i
particularly impressive setting for the j
music and the acoustics are perfect. |
The full orchestra of ninety-five men
will be here and an extension platform :
will be installed to make room for the
musicians.
The program has been selected espe
cially for the setting and occasion of
the concert. The great Fifth Symphony
of Beethoven is the chief work and
will occupy the last half of the con
cert. This composition, "the immortal
Fifth," occupies a place on the summit
of musical literature. In strength of
conception and simplicity of treatment'
it is almost unequaled.
"Suite Number Six"
The opening number will be "Suite
Number Six" by John Sebastian Bach,
arranged for the modern symphony
orchestra by Sir Henry Wood of Lon
don. The suite consists of several in-;
dependent and contrasting dances and
pieces grouped together.
Michel Penha, the new first cellist
of the orchestra, will be soloist in
Faure's "Elegie." This will be the first
solo appearance of Penha at Stanford.
He is regarded as one of the most ac- j
complished cellists on the Coast.
"Prize Song" from Wagner's opera, j
"Die Meistersinger," will be played j
in its orchestral version. The melody |
is that which, in the opera wins a
medieval contest of song, and is one j
of the most lyrical and expressive
arias in opera.
"Good Friday Spell" Different
Another Wagner number in a de- j
cidedly different vein is the "Good |
Friday Spell" from Parsifal, the last
work of the great composer of Ger
man opera. The opera deals with the,
story of the Holy Grail in a mystically |
religious spirit, and the "Spell" em- j
bodies the strange, other-worldly at
mosphere. It is the day of Good Friday
and a blessing seems to float down
from heaven to earth. This is the one
picture drawn by the strange harmo-1
nies of the piece.

Day three years ago and again last j
year. The Memorial Church makes a i
particularly impressive setting for the j
music and the acoustics are perfect. |
The full orchestra of ninety-five men
will be here and an extension platform :
will be installed to make room for the
musicians.
The program has been selected espe
cially for the setting and occasion of
the concert. The great Fifth Symphony
of Beethoven is the chief work and
will occupy the last half of the con
cert. This composition, "the immortal
Fifth," occupies a place on the summit
of musical literature. In strength of
conception and simplicity of treatment'
it is almost unequaled.
"Suite Number Six"
The opening number will be "Suite
Number Six" by John Sebastian Bach,
arranged for the modern symphony
orchestra by Sir Henry Wood of Lon
don. The suite consists of several in-;
dependent and contrasting dances and
pieces grouped together.
Michel Penha, the new first cellist
of the orchestra, will be soloist in
Faure's "Elegie." This will be the first
solo appearance of Penha at Stanford.
He is regarded as one of the most ac- j
complished cellists on the Coast.
"Prize Song" from Wagner's opera, j
"Die Meistersinger," will be played j
in its orchestral version. The melody |
is that which, in the opera wins a
medieval contest of song, and is one j
of the most lyrical and expressive
arias in opera.
"Good Friday Spell" Different
Another Wagner number in a de- j
cidedly different vein is the "Good |
Friday Spell" from Parsifal, the last
work of the great composer of Ger
man opera. The opera deals with the,
story of the Holy Grail in a mystically |
religious spirit, and the "Spell" em- j
bodies the strange, other-worldly at
mosphere. It is the day of Good Friday
and a blessing seems to float down
from heaven to earth. This is the one
picture drawn by the strange harmo-1
nies of the piece.
Tickets for the Founders' Day con-1
cert will be distributed Wenesday in !
the lobby of the Administration build- j
ing. Classes will be held as usual on i
Founders' Day, March 9, but a sacred i
concert will be given in the Memorial!

church has necessitated that tickets

the University, and alumni. Ticket

afternoon on Wednesday. All holders
of student body cards will be entitled
