# KENEALY SEALS DEFEAT CARDINAL BY 9 TO 1 SCORE
## Philippi and Sobieski Allow San Francisco Club Eight Hits 
### Herb Klein 
The capable Kenealy Seals admin
istered a 9 to 1 defeat to the Stanford
varsity ballplayers in a game last Sat
urday afternoon marked by heavy hit
; ting and creditable pitching on the
| part of the visiting nine. The Seals
were, with the exception of three play
yers, the same team which, as the
Klawans and McMullins, defeated the
Stanford players 2 to 0.
Roebky, who pitched the first six
innings for the city players, gave only
three hits; Barr, who finished the
game, did not allow one. Philippi, who
was on the mound for the Cards dur
ing the first four and a half innings,
| showed lack of experience against the
| stiff competition that the Seals fur
j nished. His curves were not going too
| well, and three times he gave men a
; trip to first, after getting two strikes
on them, by hitting them with a
pitched ball.
Sobieski Goes In
"Count" Sobieski came into the box
in the fifth with two men on bases on
hits off Philippi. One more hit, a two
j bagger, scored additional runs for the
i Seals before Sobieski put his second
batter out with a fly. Five more hits
were chalked up against the Count
! before the end of the game, but most
of them were due to muffing of the
ball by infielders. The Seals were ex
i ceptionally heavy hitters, and it was
their day as far as bat work went.
They had the happy faculty of knock
ing the ball where it was hardest to
get. Fast ones along the third and
i first base lines were +heir favorites.
Three Hits
I Stanford's hits came in the first,
! third, and fifth innings. Weaver
J slammed out the first two, and Gari
l baldi accounted for the third. From
then on the Cards repeatedly clouted
i the ball in a way that would have
! counted up a goodly number of hits
\ against a less clever team, but Neil
1 Kenealy's prides always managed to
foil the attempt, so Stanford finished
I with three solitary marks in the rec
' ord. The Cards got their run in the
I fifth.
Montagne, who played third sack
for the Seals, showed lots of class and
kept many promising hits by the var
sity from materializing. He was for
| merly with the St. Louis club and
looked it on Saturday. Hutchinson,
who pitched for the Klawans and Mc-
Mullins last week, was in the outfield.
The infield played airtight ball. Not
a single error was marked against any
i of the Seals.
Two errors were made by Stanford
players. Misplays of one sort or an
other resulted in giving the Seals sev
' eral hits. Of the six hits made on
Sobieski's pitching only two were
1 earned. Saturday's game was the
; fourth of the five so far played which
' the "Count" has finished in the box.
I He and Collins have shown the most
! dependable form, and give Harry Wol
ter moundsmen on whom he can
I count. The score by innings:
Seals 0 1 0 2 4 0 0 2 o—9
i Stanford 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 o—l0 —1
Errors —Stanford 2; Seals 0.
