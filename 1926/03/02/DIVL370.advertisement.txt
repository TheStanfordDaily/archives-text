For the First Spring Days
NEW PUMPS OF PARCHMENT OR SAUTERNE KID
Not because you need them, of course, but just because
it's Springtime and these new shades are so dainty and
pretty, so in keeping with the season and also because they
will complement so many of the new garment modes.
We picture a model made of Sauterne kid —with a medium
high spike heel. It's charming enough to complete most
any costume—and there's no extra charge for the buckle.
$12
Appropriate hosiery $1.75 to $2.95.
