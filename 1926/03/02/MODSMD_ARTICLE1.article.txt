# STRICT ADHERENCE TO RUSHING RULES ORDERED FOR ROW
## Tentative Programs Discussed At Fraternity Board Meet Last Night 
### 
That freshmen violating a major
rule of the rushing system be pro
hibited, at the discretion of the Inter
fraternity Board, from ever pi-edging
the house with whom they committed
the violation, and that the Board use
its power to the fullest extent in pun
ishing both major and minor infrac
tions of the rules, was the substance
of a resolution passed last night by
the Interfraternity Council. Punish
ment will fall on freshman violators
as heavily as on fraternity violators
this year.
Rushing begins on April 11 and ends
May 6, according to the plan submit
ted by the Interfraternity Board to
the Council last night. The plan will
be voted on by the Council next Mon
day evening. The whole rushing period
is divided into three parts. Three days
will separate the first period from the
second, and one day will separate the
second from the third. There will be
no rushing the day of the track meet,
April 17. The last week of rushing is
also Junior Week, pledging coming on
Friday, May 7, the date of the Junior
Opera. The card system will be used
