# AMERICAN POETRY WILL BE TOPIC OF UNTERMEYER TALK
## Noted Poet Seeks "Campus Slang" for Private Word Collection 
### Barbara Dewlaney 
"Although I tell the professors that
I'm going about college campuses lec
turing in order that I may study edu
cation, I'm really collecting campus
slang," says Louis Untermeyer, who
will speak on "The New Era in Ameri
can Poetry" in the Assembly hall at
7:30 o'clock tonight.
"At the University of Arizona I
added to my collection the slang
phrase, 'Thanks for the buggy ride,'
a reply used by young women when
some slighting remark is made about
them. I shall add this phrase to the
slang dictionary which I'm compiling."
"How large is your dictionary?" the
poet was asked.
"There are about 150 pages, each
containing five or six words with defi
nitions," replied Untermeyer.
"Five or six times 150 is about 300,"
he stated triumphantly.
In answering a very serious ques
tion concerning his outlook on life,
Untermeyer replied,' "I approve of
Leland Stanford University, the cli
mate, and the universe. But I believe
there should be more of all three."
Without warning Untermeyer as
sumed a deep graveness and confiden
tially remarked, "I always attend my
own lectures, but if the doors and win
dows are not locked I, like my audi
ence, am likely to leave early."
Untermeyer may seem trifling and
frivolous, but in reality there, is no
end to his brilliance which flashes
with every remark he makes. No
sooner has he finished a playful re
view of one topic before his words
come tumbling out with wit on some
other subject.
When it is considered that Unter
meyer is a leading creative artist, a
distinguished critic, and that he is
doing an important work in bringing
to public attention the work of other
contemporary poets, it will be realized
that such diversion as that in which he
brilliantly engaged his interviewer is
only one side of his mental activity.
When asked how to write poetry,
Untermeyer replied with conviction
that it is "very simple, very simple."
"The first thing to do is to buy a
typewriter, one that you can carry
around, for no one knows when the
inspiration will come.
Has Business Head
"I recommend the 'Y' typewriter,
since every time the name of this
company gets into print because I
mentioned it, the company pays me
fifty cents. However, I'm going to ask
"x" company to give me a dollar for
every mention made of its typewriter.
Then you must buy no other than 'x'
typewriters.
"To proceed with the business of
writing poetry. You sit down (let us
say you will write this poem in an
hour), take out your typewriter, ad
just the ribbon, and clean the type.
This process requires at least half an
hour. The next important step, which
requires fifteen minutes, is the adjust
ment of the spacers, a most important
part of the poem because it will be
built entirely upon the architecture
provided by this adjustment.
Free Verse Easy
"Of course, if you're writing free
verse, adjustment of the spacers is un
necessary, since in that case you
merely write until you come to the
end of the typewriter line and then
turn the carriage and start another
line.
"Then in the first of your last fifteen
minutes you take out your rhyming
pocket dictionary, which you always
carry with you. Selecting your rhyme
scheme such as 'line, fine, "wine, dine,'
you place these words at the extreme
right of your page and in the last ten
minutes of your hour, your creative
mind is at work filling in the lines.
Here associative thinking comes into
play, all tie rhymes suggest words.
You fill in the lines, and presto, the
poem is a finished product."
Untermeyer's only message to be
ginning writers is, "Go and sin no
more."
