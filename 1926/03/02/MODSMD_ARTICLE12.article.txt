# English Dramatic Critic Writes "Green Goddess" As Challenge
## 
### 
"The Green Goddess," which will be i
| presented Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall under the direction of Gor
don Davis, was written by an English
| dramatic critic, William Archer. Arch- i
j er wrote the whole play in one day as
j a challenge to modern drama, which
he has criticized openly and forcibly
in the past few years. As a result he
j has a play different from the present
i day run of plays.
! His melodrama has caused great
I comment because, instead of being
pedantic and stilted, as most dramas
written by critics are, it is produce- j
able and thoroughly suspense-sustain- j
ing. Archer opens his plot right at the
beginning of the first act and is able
to hold the doubt, and interest down
to the last scene in the fourth act,
where the plot is untangled in an ex- j
.tremely clever manner. This is his!
first attempt at writing plays, but he i
shows a finished ability at continuity, j
j and a deep understanding of his char-!

acters and situations.
With the presentation of "The Green i
Goddess," the new Stanford orchestra, j
under Helen Engel Atkinson's person- j
al direction, will make its debut as a :
regular Stanford organization. This j
will be the first regular orchestra for j
several years large enough to take j
care of productions in the Assembly
hall. Charles Midgeley was the direc- 1
tor of the last Stanford group. The j
new orchestra is composed of twenty-1
four campus musicians.
In order to keep in complete har-1
mony with the play, the orchestra has |
arranged a group of selections of an \
oriental nature, including music by j
well-known composers. The list of or- j
chestrations is as follows:
"Oci'ental"—By Victor Herbert.
"Oriental Scene" —By R. L. Jensky- j
Roberts.
"Oriental Dancing Girls" —Goldmark-
Roberts.
"Chanson-Sans-Parloes" —Cbavosky.
"Carnation March" —Kritscliner.
