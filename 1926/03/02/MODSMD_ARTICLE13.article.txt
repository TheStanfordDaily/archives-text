The senior interclass baseball team
blanked the sophomore aggregation 3
to 0 t in a close game played yesterday
afternoon on the Military Field. The
seniors triumphed, though outhit by
the '28 team four to three.
Brock, pitcher for the seniors, kept
his opponents well in hand throughout
the game and they were only danger
ous in the first inning. He kept the
hits well scattered and the only time
after the first inning that a sophomore
rearhed third was when two were out.
Seniors Lead in Series
This was the Beniors' first game and
the victory gives them the lead in the
interclass series. The only other un
defeated team is the 1929 squad who,
however, was tied 1 to 1 by the 1928
team. The seniors meet the freshmen
Thursday in a decisive contest, while
the juniors tangle today with the
sophomores.
The tilt was well played, with nei
ther team making any glaring errors.
Bigelow, of the seniors, smashed out
the longest hit, a triple. McDermont,
'26, made a double which scored the
winning run. The battery for the
losers, while not as effective as that
of the seniors, did some good work. It
was composed of Moore, the pitcher
who held the freshmen to one hit in
his first start, and Glade, catcher.
The initial score came in the first
inning when, with one out, Ditzler, '26,
singled. Stockbridge advanced him to
second, and McDermont clouted out a
double to score Ditzler. The sopho
mores advanced a man to third in the
third stanza but he was put out there.
Things went along smoothly until
the last of the fourth when the seniors
rang the bell twice fo make it 3-0.
Green opened the rally by walking
and Bigelow drove out his triple to
score the runner. Bigelow reached
home a moment later on Ditzler's
sacrifice. The last two innings were
colorless with neither team scoring.
Brock fanned five 1928 men and
walked one, while Moore struck out
two and passed three. The score:
