# HERRINGTON HOLDS SECOND RANKING BY WIN OVER FAIRCHILD
## 
### 
In the first competition for place on
the varsity tennis squad this week,
Alan Herrington, No. 2 man, success
fully defended his position against
Paul Fairchild in sequence sets 6-4,
7-5. In the playoff for sixth place,
Gomer Thomas conquered Frank Dunn
6-3, 7-5, who in turn trounced Alan
McCray 6-3, 6-3. *
Herrington played consistent tennis
to beat Fairchild. He played safe
shots off his backhand and waited for
an opening to allow him to put the
point away with a hard forehand drive
or a crisp volley at the net. Fairchild
displayed his usual ability to make
sensational "gets." Many shots usually
good for points were safely returned
after rushes to corners of the court.
The deciding factor in the play was
Herrington's fine forehand drive. In
the pinches it was this deplorable, ag
gressive shot that determined the out
come.
Frank Dunn, who a few days before
had bowed to Gomer Thomas in
straight sets, successfully maintained
his seventh ranking position against
Alan McCray. In their first engage
ment, Dunn triumphed only after a
hard three-set affair, but yesterday
he won easily. McCray played in his
customary hard smashing style, but
could not overcome Dunn's advantage
of height.
The varsity competition has been
increased to two matches a week be
cause the rainy spell seriously handi
capped practice and additional play
is needed to prepare the varsity for
the California meet on April 10.
