## 
### 
Zeta Psi gained one leg on a victory
over Phi Kappa Psi in the intramural
tennis tournament yesterday afternoon
when Henry Robert, first man for the
Zetes, defeated Jack Beard in straight
sets 6-2, 6-3. The second singles match
between Homer Oatman of the Zetes
and William Price was called on ac-
count of darkness after the initial set,
which Price won 12-10.
Robert led Beard throughout the
match. His steady driving and hard
serving immediately put the Phi Psi
representative on the defensive. Beard
performed excellently at times, but
under the constant hammering grew
erratic and unsteady.
Price and Oatman played the long
est set in the intramural competition
thus far. The games alternated evenly
and neither man seemed able to break
the deadlock. In the twenty-first game,
Price finally rallied to break through
Oatman's delivery and to complete the
set on his own service. This match
will be finished this afternoon.
The three teams now in the semi-
final round of the competition, which
42 teams entered, are Branner I, Sig-
ma Nu, and Alpha Kappa Lambda.
Branner I is bracketed with Sigma Nu,
and Alpha Kappa Lambda will play
the winner of the Zete - Phi Psi match.
