# MARQUETTE DEBATE TEAM TO INVADE CAMPUS NEXT WEEK
## Wisconsin Team in Extensive Journey Plans Debates In Seven States 
### 
Stanford debaters meet the forensic
team of Marquette University on
March 8, when Herbert Steffes and
William P. Leonard will invade the
Pacific Coast on a three weeks' tour.
The Marquette team is undertaking an
extensive campaign with a squad of
four students. They will debate with
the prominent colleges of the Coast
during the period of three weeks, ac
cording to word received yesterday by
Theodore F. Baer, debate manager.
Stanford will uphold the negative of
the question, "Resolved, That this
house pities its grandchildren."
Previous to this trip, Marquette has
competed in and won three intercolle
giate debates, including one interna
tional affair, this season. The Wiscon
sing students won an audience deci
sion over the famous Cambridge Uni
versity team and judges' decisions
over the Chicago Kent College of Law
at St. Louis University.
Leonard, who will be the first speak
er at Stanford, is a native of Dublin,
Ireland, and an athlete as well as a
debater, having been a high jumper
on the varsity track team for the last
three years. In addition to his inter
collegiate debating work, he was also
prominently identified with college
publications, intramural athletics, and
law school activities.
Because of a recent operation which
made it impossible for Peter F. Coo
gan, star Marquette d-ebater and man
ager of the team, to make the tour,
Steffes will take his place in the Stan
â–  ford debate.
The second speaker for Marquette
! on March 8 will lie Steffes, a product
j of the Milwaukee South Division high
school. He was for two years a mem
ber of the championship intramural
debating team at Marquette, is secre
tary of the Marquette Literary Society,
and president of the Uniyersity Pro
gressive Society.
In the course of its trip the Mar
; quette team will debate in the states
I of Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Wy
oming, California, Arizona, and Texas,
and return to Milwaukee March 21.
