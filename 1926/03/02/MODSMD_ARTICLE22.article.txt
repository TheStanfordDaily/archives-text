Under the headline "College Wasters and Extravagant Fathers,"
George Wheeler Hinman, financial expert of the Hearst newspaper syn
dicate, recently discussed his views on the extravagance of the American
college personnel. The article went further than showing waste within
the college, however, for it attempted to paint the results of such waste
upon the years following graduation.
It may have been Mr. Hinman's intention to place the blame on the
father's of the nation for the waste of their sons, but he did not accom
plish this result. Instead, one is left with the impression that it is the col
lege itself which causes the waste, that conditions within it tend naturally
to make wasters of students. Perhaps Mr. Hinman unconsciously felt
this tendency did exist.
Ordinarily we would have passed such arguments by, classing them as
"the other side of the question," feeling that enough space has been given
in the past few years to the value of colleges to the nation. But the answer
that Dr. David Starr Jordan gave the other day to the question propounded
him, "Does college do a boy any good ?" inspired a desire to apply it to Mr.
Hinman's argument. Dr. Jordan replied to his questioner in live words
of wisdom, "That depends upon the boy."
Mr. Hinman himself says that he has no intention of representing the
majority of college students as extravagant; but to lay the blame upon
the institution for the waste of the minority is to lose sight of the cause.
It lies in the boy, as Dr. Jordan has suggested. It has never been claimed
for the college that character, including thrift, can be made with the aid
of the text-book. Association and a natural intuition develop it and if
waste and extravagance are shown while in college, it is rather the fault
of indulgent fathers and inherited characteristics than any destructive
habits fastened upon the boy by the college itself. The father in Mr.
Hinman's article who allowed his three sons $3,500 each per year upon
his $20,000 income was himself to blame for his inability to breathe, as
the author put it. One feels safe in saying that less than one-half that
amount is the average spent in western universities.
Given an amount for one year equal to double the living-wage of
thousands of workers, is it strange that the three sons made breathing
hard for the father. For one plentifully equipped with money and minus
the average amount of "horse-sense," college is certainly the wrong place
—but what spot on the earth would not be for such a person? To argue
that the thousand and one other advantages of college association and
education must be thrown aside or discounted because of the indulgence
of parents is to be guilty of false ideas that might lead to the denial of an
education to some boy whose entire life would suffer thereby.
