# "Heads Up"
## 
### 
A few times in past years track fans have been exposed to a dreadful
sensation when a javelin or discus has gone astray and narrowly missed
striking a bystander. Yesterday that which seemed almost inevitable oc
curred; and as a result a freshman is now suffering from a wound acci
dentally inflicted by one of his teammates in the javelin event.
It is hoped that the incident will be sufficient warning to cause a re
arrangement of the discus and javelin pits. During the course of a meet
the present plan is safe enough; but at practices, where men are non
chalantly strolling around the field, the present arrangement is beset with
dangers. A man endeavoring to return a thrown missile is open to fire
from two directions; and again it is possible that a javelin swerving in
flight could strike a man running on the track.
The Stanford campus is composed of more than 8000 acres. With all
this property it seems as if a safe spot could be found for practicing the
discus and javelin throws. It would seem that an ounce of prevention
would be well worth its pound of cure.

THE SUGGESTION has been made at Dubuque University that
students be given the right of walking out during particularly obnoxious
speeches. As to who determines the obnoxiousness of the speech, there
is no suggestion; but perhaps it would Ik; a case of "shooting first and ar
guing afterwards."

Feminine fall from glory per editorial in the Green and White of Ohio
University:
"In the age of chivalry, woman was respected by men for her gentleness, her
sweetness, her purity. Now she works side by side with them, smokes cigarettes of
the same brand, swears with equal vehemence, drinks illicit liquor with the same
zest, and gambles even more recklessly."

'1 hundering triumph of vocal ability as described in glowing words of
an editorial in the University of Washington Daily.
"A mighty chorus at the gymnasium tonight. Washington songs far-flung by
the massed power of hundreds of voices. Washington songs resounding over the
district."
