# SPORTS OF 1926
## Bambino's Rival? 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Will Tony Lazerri make good with the Yankees, or will
he suffer the same fate as Paul Strand, who was bought by
Connie Mack at the end of the 1923 season and failed
dismally to hit big-league pitching?
Both Strand and Lazerri were products of the Salt
Lake Club of the Pacific Coast League, and both attracted
nation-wide attention because of their prodigious batting.
Paul Strand hit .395 in 1923, and knocked out 325 safe hits,
yet was a flop as a member of the Athletics in 1924.
Lazerri last year broke Ruth's world's record for home
runs by hitting his sixtieth just as the season closed. He
also batted .355 and led the league in driving in runs. But
it must be remembered that he had the advantage of play
ing in 197 games, of hitting in the rarified atmosphere and
in the band-box ball park at Salt Lake most of the time,
and, what is more important, of facing minor league pitching.

"When the Yankees bought Tony Lazerri (it is also spelled LaZerre,
Lizzieia, and LiZerri), it seemed to some like "bringing coals to Newcastle,"
as in Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, and Lou Gehrig, they already had home run
talent in abundance. But Manager Huggins did not have a good shortstop,
and that is just what the Salt Lake Italian is reported to be. Anyway, he is
supposed to have cost the Yankees $50,000 or more in hard cash, and that
sounds like a real ballplayer even in these days.
Tony may be used at second base, with Koenig or Ward at short (Aaron
played shortstop ten years ago for Charleston, S.C.), or he may fill the gap at
short with Spencer Adams on second. If this is the arrangement, the Yankees
will be gambling with two inexperienced players in two vitally important
positions.
