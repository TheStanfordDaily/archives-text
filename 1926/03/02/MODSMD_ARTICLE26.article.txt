I Meet a Stranger
How ran T find words to decry those
I awful blocks of stone where fiends
I clad in loose, filthy corduroys sit in
wait to deprive an innocent freshman
woman of her dignity? How was I to
know what would happen when I
started guilelessly to walk down a
certain flight of steps (the name of
which I shall not mention) through
the crowd of men who always go there '
to smoke?
I had no sooner descended two steps i
when I was brutally besieged by a
tirade of clapping and violent shouts I
that caused me to fly down the remain
ing steps in terror. Rut my humiliation
did not seem complete enough to suit 1
those horrid people. As I reached the j
bottom step the outcries above me
broke into pandemonium. The impact
of someone thrown violently against
me caused me to fall.
A moment later I was conscious of
being raised to my feet and, looking
up, 1 saw a head of dishevelled red
hair capped by a dink.
"Run!" cried a shrill voice. I in
stinctively obeyed.
A minute later by rescuer anil I
were beyond hearing of the noise on
the steps. But when I turned to thank
my classmate I was tempted to turn |
and run again. It was the same person
who had followed me to my morning
class over a week before. (This time
he had followed well but not wisely).
"Are you hurt?" he inquired. Some
thing in his voice dispelled my fear.
"No," I replied, and we continued
toward my hall together.
An hour before I would have shrunk
from the thought of walking with this
man. but he was friendly, and after
my fright I was glad to have anyone
to converse with.
Presently I asked him his name.
"John Smith," he replied, "and
yours is Letitia Lemon, is it not?"
"How did you know?" My astonish
ment was without bounds.

I He seemed confused for a moment.
| Jhen he replied, "I know your room-
I mate." (I later learned that Maurathea
knew nobody by the name of John
Smith.)
Finally we reached the dormitory.
Taking leave of my new acquaintance
(who obviously had been forced upon
me) I went to my room to puzzle over
j my latest experience.
I That evening I was called to the
J telephone.
"This is John Smith," said a voice
that I did not recognize.
Of course I did not know which
John Smith it was but I instinctively
conversed on irrelevant subjects. But
the outcome of this telephone call (my
first from a man since I had come to
the university) is the most remarkable
incident of my experiences.
I know now why this mysterious
John Smith asked me to go to the next
I campus play with him, but why I ac
i cepted, I shall never know.

know what would happen when I
started guilelessly to walk down a
certain flight of steps (the name of
which I shall not mention) through
the crowd of men who always go there '
to smoke?
I had no sooner descended two steps i
when I was brutally besieged by a
tirade of clapping and violent shouts I
that caused me to fly down the remain
ing steps in terror. Rut my humiliation
did not seem complete enough to suit 1
those horrid people. As I reached the j
bottom step the outcries above me
broke into pandemonium. The impact
of someone thrown violently against
me caused me to fall.
A moment later I was conscious of
being raised to my feet and, looking
up, 1 saw a head of dishevelled red
hair capped by a dink.
"Run!" cried a shrill voice. I in
stinctively obeyed.
A minute later by rescuer anil I
were beyond hearing of the noise on
the steps. But when I turned to thank
my classmate I was tempted to turn |
and run again. It was the same person
who had followed me to my morning
class over a week before. (This time
he had followed well but not wisely).
"Are you hurt?" he inquired. Some
thing in his voice dispelled my fear.
"No," I replied, and we continued
toward my hall together.
An hour before I would have shrunk
from the thought of walking with this
man. but he was friendly, and after
my fright I was glad to have anyone
to converse with.
Presently I asked him his name.
"John Smith," he replied, "and
yours is Letitia Lemon, is it not?"
"How did you know?" My astonish
ment was without bounds.

I He seemed confused for a moment.
| Jhen he replied, "I know your room-
I mate." (I later learned that Maurathea
knew nobody by the name of John
Smith.)
Finally we reached the dormitory.
Taking leave of my new acquaintance
(who obviously had been forced upon
me) I went to my room to puzzle over
j my latest experience.
I That evening I was called to the
J telephone.
"This is John Smith," said a voice
that I did not recognize.
Of course I did not know which
John Smith it was but I instinctively
conversed on irrelevant subjects. But
the outcome of this telephone call (my
first from a man since I had come to
the university) is the most remarkable
incident of my experiences.
I know now why this mysterious
John Smith asked me to go to the next
I campus play with him, but why I ac
i cepted, I shall never know.
