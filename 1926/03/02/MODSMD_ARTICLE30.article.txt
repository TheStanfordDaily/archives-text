# ROMEO AND JULIET WERE PAIR OF DUBSLANGDON MITCHELL

Does the average American college
student think that Romeo and Juliet
were a pair of dubs? Lungdon Mitchell,
writing in the American Mercury,
says "Yes," very emphatically. "Noth
ing could be more natural than for an
American to think Romeo and Juliet
a pair of dubs."
Mitchell goes on to explain, "Let us
take it in this way: many of us have
suffered the sad experience of co-edu
cation. Sad, for this herding together
of the young bulls and heifers is a
great cooler-off. The edge of strange
ness is dulled. The blue of the dis
tance, it may be recalled, disappears
when we approach the mountain. The
mountain is then no more than a pile
of rocks —and all mountains are alike.
"Thus, when our young man is
thrown into the closest non-connubial
intercourse with a lot of young wo
men, seeing them hourly, and often
when he'd prefer not, and necessarily
losing his male of the pursuer, he
presently finds himself indifferent. And
after a year or so, his emotions be
come generalized, he becomes contin
ently promiscuous: I speak of a spir
itual promiscuity.
"Romance, naturally, there can be
none, for there is no surprise, no nov
elty, no fear, but only a highly accu
rate, and close-at-hand, inch-by-inch
perception that women are not deep
or mysterious things, differing by an
entire inner world from men, but just
people, in a pool, or on a team, and
often in the way.
"It may be that Shakespeare, when
he wrote "Romeo and Juliet," wished
to justify co-education as a means of
abolishing romance. For, clearly, "Ro
meo and Juliet" treats of the first love
of those who have not been co-edu
cated; of that sort of romantic first
passion which is in itself an excess;
and, as such, easily creates a catas
trophe.
"For Romeo didn't like Juliet. He
didn't know her well enough to like
or dislike her. He adored her —nothing
more intelligent. The American re
gards the romance of it as silly; and
the less said about the passion of it
the better.
"Thus co-education and our new and
deliciously naked and photographed
bi-sexual athleticism produce a Spar
tan state of affairs. The Spartans were
no more romantic than they were hon
est. And so, the American spirit, pos
sibly not without wisdom, regards that
famous two as a pair of dubs. A Spar
tan would have regarded them in the
same way."
