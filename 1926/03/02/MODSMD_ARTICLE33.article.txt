# CHARLESTON MARATHON
## 
### 
Three men lasted to the end of a
twenty-two-and-one-half-liour marathon
Charleston contest at the University
of Kansas. They had worn out three
orchestras, one thousand phonograph
needles, and two pairs of shoes apiece.
The last of the women contestants
dropped out after seven hours and
forty minutes.
