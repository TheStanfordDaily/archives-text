# FOUNDERS' CONCERT TICKETS WILL BE GIVEN TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tickets for the Founders' Day con
cert will be distributed to all holders
of student body cards tomorrow from
8 in the morning to 5 o'clock in the
afternoon in the lobby of the Adminis
tration building. Each student will be
entitled to one seat to the recital
which is to be given this year as last
in the Memorial Church by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under
the leadership of Alfred Hertz.
Founders' Day falls on Tuesday,
March 9, this year, and the observ
ance decided upon is the sacred con
cert which met with approval last
year. The limited number of seats in
the church necessitates restricting
tickets to students, faculty, university
officers, and a few alumni. Faculty
members may obtain two tickets to
morrow in the Administration build
ing.
The concert is made possible by
the Committee on Public Exercises
headed by Professor E. E. Robinson,
and the Stanford Symphony Commit
tee, Professor G. J. Peirce, chairman.
The Symphony Committee has been
able to obtain the orchestra for the
Founders' Day concert along with the
two regular recitals given in the As
sembly hall.
Expense is borne by the Committee
on Public Exercises, the Symphony
Committee, the Memorial Church, and
the President's Fund. The full orches
tra of 95 pieces will make the trip for
the recital. Extension of the platform
is necessary to seat all the musicians.
