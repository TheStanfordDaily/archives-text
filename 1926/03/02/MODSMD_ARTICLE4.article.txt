# WILLIAM SPARLING, 1929 TRACK ATHLETE, INJURED BY JAVELIN
## Spear Strikes Man in Right Arm During Practice; Wound Not Serious 
### 
William A. Sparling, member of the
freshman track squad, was injured
yesterday afternoon at track practice
in the old oval when a javelin struck
his right arm near the shoulder. Spar
ling was taken immediately to the
office of Dr. Russell Lee, who said
that the injury was not serious. It is
expected that Sparling will be able to
resume training within a couple of
weeks.
Sparling was bending over to pick
up a javelin to return it to the pit
when he was struck. Several by
standers cried to him to look out for
the spear, but he did not hear the
warning soon enough to dodge. Spar
ling has been working out regularly
with the freshman squad and has been
throwing the javelin close to the 175-
foot mark.
