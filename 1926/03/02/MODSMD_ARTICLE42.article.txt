# Women First Admitted to Illinois University in '70
## 
### 
The admittance of women to the
University of Illinois was once the
subject of a very close debate, accord
ing to a story recently published in
the Daily Illini. The question was dis
cussed for a couple of years before, in
1870, it was finally brought to a vote
before the trustees. The result of the
votes cast was five to four in favor
of admitting the fairer sex. Today the
women outnumber the men in some
of the colleges of the university.
