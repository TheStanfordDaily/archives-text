# Women's Cage Title Hangs On Soph-Junior Contest
## 
### 
The women's basketball title will
practically be decided tomorrow after
noon when the sophomores and the
juniors meet at 4:15 o'clock on Roble
field, although this game is only the
fourth of six to be played. The juniors
and sophomores have shown them
selves to be the strongest of the four
teams, with the 1928 women slightly
favored.
The sophomores have their last
year's championship team back this
quarter almost intact, while the jun
iors have lost several valuable players.

The director of the health depart
ment at Ohio State University says
that fraternity houses are the best
places to contract colds.
