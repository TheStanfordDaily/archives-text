# BREEZE, BOUTELL CHOSEN TO WRITE 1927 OPERA PLOT
## Parks, Wiggin, and Chrysella Kiler Will Take Charge Of Production 
### 
The 1927 Junior Opera script for
this spring is now being written by
Tommy Breeze, '27, and Harry Boutell,
'28, since their plot and sketches were
accepted yesterday by the Junior
Opera committee. Charles Parks will
direct the show, with Jack Wiggin
directing the music and Chrysella
Kiler coaching the dances. The action
by the committee is subject to the
approval of the Dramatic Council.
The opera this year will not be of
the modern drawing-room variety as
it has been for the past three years.
An attempt was made to find some
thing different, and in so doing, a
period play, dating around 1812, was
chosen.
Jack Wiggin intends to use the same
orchestra he has had for these two
productions for Junior Opera. He is
having the orchestration written by a
new man who, Wiggins claims, is far
superior to the one who has done the
orchestrating heretofore. He will be
assisted by Gordon Hall.
Tryouts for the cast and chorus will
not start until the first of next quar
ter, when all the libretto and music
will be practically completed.
