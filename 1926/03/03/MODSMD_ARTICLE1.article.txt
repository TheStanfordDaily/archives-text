# "GREEN GODDESS" SCENES PORTRAY ORIENTAL MOODS
## SETTINGS HAVE MYSTERY Stage Manager of Original Production Sends Own Designs for Play 
### 
That alumni of the University are
becoming interested in Stanford's
drama season is shown by the fact
that Mrs. Maude Howell, ex-'22, stage
manager for the original production
of "The Green Goddess," has sent her
own designs and construction plans
for use in Friday's presentation of
George Arliss' play.
Mrs. Howell is one of the few suc
cessful women sAage managers in the j
country. She handled the stage work j
both in New York and London, and j
personally directed the road company |
in England. Mrs. Howell was Maude
Miller when she was at Stanford. Les
lie Kiler is using these plans as a
basis for his sets, but is also design
ing a large part of the detail himself.
Gordon Davis has also been assisted
in some of the problems of directing
by postal and telegraphic communica
tion with Mrs. Howell.
Sets Oriental
The sets will maintain an oriental
atmosphere throughout the four acts
of the play. Attempting modern meth
ods of treatment, Kiler is making sim- >
plicity the keynote to his work. The
first act opens in a rocky spot in the
Himalayas where the shrine of "The
Green Goddess" is located. The god
dess is set amid heavy columns hewn
out of the solid rock of the mountain,
and looks silently out upon the air
plane wreck upon which the curtain
rises. Massive boulders, with clever
lighting, bring out the weird effects
and makes the atmosphere ominous.
Oriental arches with mosaics and ara
besques in true oriental designs and
colors, added to rich furnishings, give
a luxurious yet mysterious air to both
the second and third acts set in the
Rajah's palace. The second act is of
a dining logia with a balcony facing
the rear of the stage. Several receding
rows of arches lend depth and color
to the balcony. In the third act the
"snuggery" of the Rajah is portrayed.
The motif of oriental mosaic arches
is continued in this act..
Temple of Goddess
The final act is the crowning work
of the play, showing the interior of
the temple of the Green Goddess. The
central figure of a six-armed dancing
goddess set upon a dais in the middle
of the stage and having at its feet a
â– sacrifice table dominates the scene. A
mystical atmosphere is conveyed by
deep shadows. It serves admirably as
a setting for the mysterious and occult
rites of the natives.
