# SOPHOMORES TAKE CLOSE GAME FROM JUNIOR CLASS NINE
## Freshmen Will Meet Seniors Tomorrow in Deciding Engagement 
### 
The sophomores downed the juniors
by a score of 4 to 3 in the interclass
baseball game played yesterday after
noon on the Military Field. A hit by
Prisinzano and a sacrifice allowed the
'28 team to break a 3 to 3 tie in the
fifth inning and win the tilt.
The 1928 squad managed to triumph
despite the fact that only seven play
ers showed up for the game. The team
played with only one outfielder, but
Red Moore, its pitcher, kept the oppo
sition either striking out or poking
infield grounders most of the time.
However, the absence of two outfield
ers enabled the juniors to do all their
scoring when the ball was driven to
right field with two men on bases.
Red Moore was the chief tactor in
the sophomore victory because of his
steady pitching. He allowed five hits
but these were largely do to the scarc
ity of outfielders. He also struck out
six of the '27 men. Hunter twirled a
nifty game but the sophomores com
bined their hits and the juniors' errors
in such a manner that they made the
most out of their four hits.
After the sophomores had the score
to 3 to 0 in the third inning, the 1927
nine knotted the count with a trio of
scores. Bailard started the fracas by
getting a pass, and Morrill continued
the rally with a one-bagger. At this
opportune moment Clark smashed the
ball into right field for a homer.
The seniors and the freshmen meet
tomorrow in a game on the freshman
field to settle the interclass baseball
championship. The seniors are favored
over the yearlings because they
blanked the sophomores 3 to 0 while
the freshmen only tied them 1 to 1.
The senior-junior game, which was
postponed from last Wednesday, is
! still to be played off, but inasmuch as
both the sophomores and the fresh
men trimmed the juniors the 1927
team is expected to lose decisively.
