# CARDINAL NINE TO MEET TROJANS IN TWO GAME SERIES
## U.S.C. OUTFIT POWERFUL Games Played on Friday and Saturday Will Be First In Two Years 
### Herb Klein 
Stanford varsity baseball players
will meet U.S.C. in a two-game series j
; next Friday and Saturday. This will
ibe the first time in two years that
; Cardinal and Trojan nines have
played. Two years ago, U.S.C., after
1 dropping the first game of a three
game series to Stanford, won the
j other two.
A twenty-man squad will make the '
; trip from Los Angeles under the lead- i
| ership of Hobbs Adams, varsity cap-'
tain, and Sam Crawford, baseball
; coach.
Many Sophomores
I Crawford is in very much the same
position as Harry Wolter, coach of the !
Cardinal nine. Both are highly thank- j
j ful for their last year's freshman j
1 teams which are furnishing some of
the best varsity material. Three of the
U.S.C. pitchers, both first-base candi
! dates, second sacker, the star third
baseman, the regular shortstop, and
one of the outfield regulars, are all
secondyear men.
] It is not known who will start in
the box for U.S.C. Pitchers are plenti
ful on tlve squad, there being at least
six moundsmen from whom Coach
| Crawford can choose. Leo Guicliard
was a regular twirler last year and
ended the season in great style. He
is one of the best on the present squad
and can play outfield as well. Slim
Gormsen is another veteran.
Laraneta Has Ability
Manuel Laraneta, now a junior, was
not out for baseball last season, but
was one of the best pitchers in his
freshman year. He has the record of
having won every game in which he
pitched. Laraneta is also a right fielder
iof .ability.
Several sophomores add greatly to
the strength of the pitching staff. Jack
Bruner was going well for the babes
last year and has improved this sea
! son. He is also a basketball player.
Ted Sahlberg and Harold Lukin are
secondyear men who are out for base
ball for the first time. Lukin is another
of the versatile moundsmen who play
field.
Gibson Regular Catcher
Webb Gigson, the regular catcher
of the Trojan nine has been sick for
several weeks, but is now back on
the squad. He captain the freshman
'team last year. Walter Scott, a senior,
has played regular catcher for two
j years past. Curtis Barnes, of the last
babe team, and Ted Coffman, who
played last year, are other catchers
on the varsity string.
Vic Orsatti, third sacker who was
tliet star of the Trojan frosh last year,
is going in rare style this season, and
jis probably the best player on the
i team. He is a consistent batter and
; death on all flies that come in his
| neighborhood. He may prevent the
1 Stanford batters from making good
several hits. As Montague, the third
' baseman of the Kenealy Seals, man
aged to keep the total of Card hits
to five with his uncanny ability at
' snagging the ball out of the air, the
1 presence of Orsatti on bag number
1 three may give the Card sluggers
I trouble.

Stanford varsity baseball players
will meet U.S.C. in a two-game series j
; next Friday and Saturday. This will
ibe the first time in two years that
; Cardinal and Trojan nines have
played. Two years ago, U.S.C., after
1 dropping the first game of a three
game series to Stanford, won the
j other two.
A twenty-man squad will make the '
; trip from Los Angeles under the lead- i
| ership of Hobbs Adams, varsity cap-'
tain, and Sam Crawford, baseball
; coach.
Many Sophomores
I Crawford is in very much the same
position as Harry Wolter, coach of the !
Cardinal nine. Both are highly thank- j
j ful for their last year's freshman j
1 teams which are furnishing some of
the best varsity material. Three of the
U.S.C. pitchers, both first-base candi
! dates, second sacker, the star third
baseman, the regular shortstop, and
one of the outfield regulars, are all
secondyear men.
] It is not known who will start in
the box for U.S.C. Pitchers are plenti
ful on tlve squad, there being at least
six moundsmen from whom Coach
| Crawford can choose. Leo Guicliard
was a regular twirler last year and
ended the season in great style. He
is one of the best on the present squad
and can play outfield as well. Slim
Gormsen is another veteran.
Laraneta Has Ability
Manuel Laraneta, now a junior, was
not out for baseball last season, but
was one of the best pitchers in his
freshman year. He has the record of
having won every game in which he
pitched. Laraneta is also a right fielder
iof .ability.
Several sophomores add greatly to
the strength of the pitching staff. Jack
Bruner was going well for the babes
last year and has improved this sea
! son. He is also a basketball player.
Ted Sahlberg and Harold Lukin are
secondyear men who are out for base
ball for the first time. Lukin is another
of the versatile moundsmen who play
field.
Gibson Regular Catcher
Webb Gigson, the regular catcher
of the Trojan nine has been sick for
several weeks, but is now back on
the squad. He captain the freshman
'team last year. Walter Scott, a senior,
has played regular catcher for two
j years past. Curtis Barnes, of the last
babe team, and Ted Coffman, who
played last year, are other catchers
on the varsity string.
Vic Orsatti, third sacker who was
tliet star of the Trojan frosh last year,
is going in rare style this season, and
jis probably the best player on the
i team. He is a consistent batter and
; death on all flies that come in his
| neighborhood. He may prevent the
1 Stanford batters from making good
several hits. As Montague, the third
' baseman of the Kenealy Seals, man
aged to keep the total of Card hits
to five with his uncanny ability at
' snagging the ball out of the air, the
1 presence of Orsatti on bag number
1 three may give the Card sluggers
