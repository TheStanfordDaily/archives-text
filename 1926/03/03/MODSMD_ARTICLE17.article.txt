# NICHOLS OUT FOR SEASON AS RESULT OF FRACTURED ARM
## 
### 
Stanford's hopes in the hurdles
went down several points yester
day when Ross Nichols, star hur
dler, broke his arm. Nichols was
topping the hurdles in practice
when he tripped; in the effort to
break his fall he threw the full
wieght of his body on his arm.
Examination by a physician
showed that Nichols had frac
tured both bones in the right
forearm.
This accident will keep him out
for the remainder of the season.
In Nichols, Templeton is losing a
star hurdler. He had counted on
him to be a potential factor in the
success of this year's team. Nich
ols is a sophomore and was the
captain of last year's freshman
team.
Last Saturday in the interclass
meet he made 15 3-5 In the high
hurdles and was counted on to
take firsts or seconds in both the
California and U.S.C. meets.
