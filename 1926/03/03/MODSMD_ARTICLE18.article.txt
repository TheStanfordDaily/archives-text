# DEVELOPMENT OF POETRY SEEN BY LOUIS UNTERMEYER
## Poet Predicts Formation of American Language in Near Future 
### 
"America has spread poetically as |
well as geographically," declared Louis
| Untermeyer in his lecture last night
on "The New Era in Modern Poetry."
' "Previous poetry has been limited to
commuting distance from Boston, but
now each state has its poet laureate
; and each little town has its poet."
At present there are about eight
hundred different poets in America
who have printed volumes of poetry
I and about ten times that many have
i published poems in local newspapers
and magazines, according to Unter
| meyer.
Modern Background
The national quality of modern
American poetry is evidenced by its
American background, theme, lan
guage, feeling, and range.
"Modern American poetry is char
acterized by its simplicity of language
and subject. Modern poets are using
words of their own day with its vivid
! slang and tendency toward raciness. I
believe we are seeing today the forma
tion of a definitely American language
which in one hundred years will be
as different from what is considered
; good English now as High German is
different from Low Dutch or as Chau
cerian English differs from English j
of today.
"In fact I seriously look forward to
the day when a professor, if he wishes
a steak in Palo Alto, must take his |
wife with him to act as an interpre-1
ter."
A romantic realism is characteristic
of modern poetry which is written by
men who choose to write about the
commonplace. Modern poets do not
write of places they have never seen,
experiences they have never had, and
motions they have never felt; they
choose simple subjects without super
ficiality.
Realism Characteristic
Devoting the last half of his lecture
to reading examples of modern poetry,
Untermeyer's first selections were
poems of Carl Sandburg, whose poetry
he defines as typically American in
idiom, feeling, and speech. Sandburg's
"Losers" and his "Jazz Fantasia"
were read by Untermeyer.
Speaking of Robert Frost as the in
tellectual aristocrat whose poetry is
distinctive for a sort of grimness,
beautiful with its raillery, the speaker
illustrated by reading Frost's "The
Runaway," a "whimsical picture" in
the words of Untermeyer.
Untermeyer selected "Miniver
Cheevy" as an illustration of poetry
written by Edwin Arlington Robinson,
who is interested in the type of per
son called a failure.
Selections Read
"I always think of Lindsay as
preaching the gospel of beauty through
a saxaphone," said Untermeyer. "Lind
say's poems are marked for their
quality of new sounds of America, a
sort of syncopated music of rhyme,
ragtime, and religion."
Amy Lowell was called by Unter
meyer a "poet's poet." Practically all
the lyrical poetry is being written by
women, three of the outstanding lyric
ists being Sara Tearsdale, Edna St.
Vincent Millay, and Elinor Wylie.
Defining the closing poems he read
as those of the "only poet of whose
work I have read every single line,"
Untermeyer read his own "Swimmers,"
"Prayer," "To a Weeping Willow," and
"Caliban in the Coal Mines."

Modern Background
The national quality of modern
American poetry is evidenced by its
American background, theme, lan
guage, feeling, and range.
"Modern American poetry is char
acterized by its simplicity of language
and subject. Modern poets are using
words of their own day with its vivid
! slang and tendency toward raciness. I
believe we are seeing today the forma
tion of a definitely American language
which in one hundred years will be
as different from what is considered
; good English now as High German is
different from Low Dutch or as Chau
cerian English differs from English j
of today.
"In fact I seriously look forward to
the day when a professor, if he wishes
a steak in Palo Alto, must take his |
wife with him to act as an interpre-1
ter."
A romantic realism is characteristic
of modern poetry which is written by
men who choose to write about the
commonplace. Modern poets do not
write of places they have never seen,
experiences they have never had, and
motions they have never felt; they
choose simple subjects without super
ficiality.
Realism Characteristic
Devoting the last half of his lecture
to reading examples of modern poetry,
Untermeyer's first selections were
poems of Carl Sandburg, whose poetry
he defines as typically American in
idiom, feeling, and speech. Sandburg's
"Losers" and his "Jazz Fantasia"
were read by Untermeyer.
Speaking of Robert Frost as the in
tellectual aristocrat whose poetry is
distinctive for a sort of grimness,
beautiful with its raillery, the speaker
illustrated by reading Frost's "The
Runaway," a "whimsical picture" in
the words of Untermeyer.
Untermeyer selected "Miniver
Cheevy" as an illustration of poetry
written by Edwin Arlington Robinson,
who is interested in the type of per
son called a failure.
Selections Read
"I always think of Lindsay as
preaching the gospel of beauty through
a saxaphone," said Untermeyer. "Lind
say's poems are marked for their
quality of new sounds of America, a
sort of syncopated music of rhyme,
ragtime, and religion."
Amy Lowell was called by Unter
meyer a "poet's poet." Practically all
the lyrical poetry is being written by
women, three of the outstanding lyric
ists being Sara Tearsdale, Edna St.
Vincent Millay, and Elinor Wylie.
Defining the closing poems he read
as those of the "only poet of whose
work I have read every single line,"
Untermeyer read his own "Swimmers,"
"Prayer," "To a Weeping Willow," and
"Caliban in the Coal Mines."
"America has spread poetically as |
well as geographically," declared Louis
| Untermeyer in his lecture last night
on "The New Era in Modern Poetry."
' "Previous poetry has been limited to
commuting distance from Boston, but
now each state has its poet laureate
; and each little town has its poet."
At present there are about eight
hundred different poets in America
who have printed volumes of poetry
I and about ten times that many have
i published poems in local newspapers
and magazines, according to Unter
| meyer.
