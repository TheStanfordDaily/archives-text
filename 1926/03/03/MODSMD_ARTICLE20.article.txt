# Stanford Band Will Give Sunday Concert at Lake
## 
### 
The Stanford band, under the direc
tion of Professor E. Whitney Martin,
will give an hour's program to the
visitors at the Lagunita bandstand
next Sunday afternoon at 2:30.
Plans were made at the Tuesday
rehearsals following the successful
concert given last Sunday at the Vet
eran's hospital in Palo Alto which
created the demand for a similar pro
gram for the campus.
