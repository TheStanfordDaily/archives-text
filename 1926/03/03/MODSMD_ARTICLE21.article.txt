## PROTECTS PUBLICATIONS Approval Given Last Night Is Withdrawn by Executive Board This Noon 
### 
At a special meeting of the Execu
tive Committee at 1 o'clock today the
motion, passed by the body last night,
to admit the Colldex Advertising Com
pany's index cards for use in looseleaf
folders was repealed. The managers
Jof the various Stanford publications
explained to the committee that this
advertising would materially cut into
the profits of the publications, and in
some cases seriously endanger their
finances.
At previous times there has been
trouble with advertising schemes of
this nature, and the sale of space in
I these projects made it necessary for
the business men of Palo Alto to re
quest the University to stop all. ad
vertising solicitation of this kind if
possible. The Colldex Company ex
pressed its intention to live up to the
rules and regulations imposed on any
advertising agency on the campus, and
the plan was passed in last night's
meeting. Since the publication man
agers have explained the situation,
however, the committee repealed its
previous action.
