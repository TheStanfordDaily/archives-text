# Safety First at Lagunita
## 
### 
In our midst is a beauty spot that has furnished pleasure to thousands
in past years â€”Lake Lagunita. Its creation each spring is an event toward
which every student looks forward. But while these thousands may use
it for swimming and boating in uninterrupted safety for a long period,
past experience has shown that tragedy is destined to spring up. A young
man or woman, suddenly attacked by cramps or heart disease, drowns
with little or no warning to others near the scene.
Perhaps in the past the accidents have been of such a nature that they
could not be averted, but there is always the possibility that with due pre
caution a life may be saved.
At present, the prevention facilities appear as follows: an attendant
on week-days whose duties are primarily the checking of equipment and
secondarily, the safe-guarding of lives; an extra attendant on Sunday to
aid the checking but not necessarily to augment the life-guard facilities;
a scow used as a life boat; a set of grappling hooks; a pulmotor available
for use but owned by and kept at the Palo Alto Tire Station; and a diver
available in two hours from San Francisco.
To remedy the situation it is apparent that a great deal of expense
would be placed on someone's shoulders and it is a fact that the boat
house franchise is not a proposition that pays great sums to its possessor.
For further argument, it can also be said that the attendant might hear all
calls for help; that there wight be others within aiding distance; that the
present boat might be swift enough to carry a guard to the scene of the
accident; and that the pulmotor in Palo Alto might be available in time
to save.
It seems to the editor, however, that a human life is worth far more
than monetary consideration, material preparation, or the risk of gambling
011 the present equipment. Those in charge have undoubtedly done what
they deemed sufficient, but the factors of prevention efficiency are cer
tainly not up to a par. Added care should be taken and the expense pro
portioned in some fair manner.
Canoe tests were provided last year that were satisfactory in them
selves, but little check was kept upon those using canoes and boats and
none upon swimmers. This year no check at all is being used as far as
can be observed.
While pulmotors are reliable for asphyxiation, modern tests have
shown them practically useless in case of drowning, due to the force used
upon the lungs with resulting damage to the tissue. A "lung-motor,' the
latest invention and substitute for the pulmotor, obviates the above diffi
culties and should be purchased and kept by the campus fire department
for immediate use.
Attendants may be trained swimmers and have rudimentary knowledge
of life-saving and artificial respiration, but unless they are detailed as
special life-guards and not mere attendants their presence may go for
naught. One or two men, trained to act in emergencies, to handle crowds
and direct rescue work, arid well-schooled in the science of artificial
respiration, should be on duty most of the day as life-guards only and not
as clerks.
