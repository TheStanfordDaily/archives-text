# Teaching Collegiate Etiquette
## 
### 
From the pen of one Nellie Ballou comes a future best seller entitled,
"College Etiquette," and labeled on its cover, "The Blue Book of Good
Form at School and College." The correct procedure in entertaining a
member of the faculty, a distinguished visitor, an alumnus, the best method
for choosing a Queen of the May, for introducing people, and the proper |
time for girls to take the initiative in case the l>oy fails, all these delicate |
points are discussed in this valuable addition to the college man's library.
Undoubtedly the book will find a few innocent buyers. But when the
writer propounds the theory that an alumnus back for a reunion should
not be disturl>ed from the revery into which he is apt to fall because in all
probability the crowning memories of his youth make him unable to speak,
we find no difficulty in relegating this book to the ovcr-crowded shelves of
impractical discourses on various forms of etiquette.
If a cleverly conceived book on college etiquette is ever written it will
be unnecessary for many of the country's younger generation to go to col
lege. We look forward to such a time when college will not l>e considered
by some a mere training school for affected manners.â€”Cornell Daily Sun. i
