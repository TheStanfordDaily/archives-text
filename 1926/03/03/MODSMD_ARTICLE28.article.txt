# SPORTS OF 1926
## Famous Coopers 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The Coopers have never monopolized glory in the
world of sports to any great extent, but right now there
are three of that name who are more than doing their share
to keep the family in the limelight. Two are veterans, and
the third is more or less of a newcomer in the public eye.
The best known of the Cooper athletes is probably
Arlie Wilbur, left-handed pitcher of the Chicago Cubs.
Arlie pitched for the Pittsburgh Pirates for thirteen con
secutive seasons, winning 202 games and losing 159, for
which he was rewarded by being traded to the Cubs, who
promptly finished last while the Pirates won the world's
championship. But Cooper, who from 1917 to 1922 ave
raged over twenty wins a season, did not have a very good
year in Chicago last season, and, with a new manager, should
do much better in 1926. He has always been known as a
tine hitting pitcher, and batted .349 for Pittsburgh in 1924.

Earl Cooper has for years endeared himself to the hearts of the speed
racing fans by his crafty and daring driving. Cooper is one of the foxiest
veterans of both speedway and road-race driving and has numerous champion
ships to his credit. Among the many races that he has won are the Los
Angeles Thanksgiving Day race (twice) and the annual 250-mile Confederate
Memorial Day classic at Charlotte, N.C., in which he averaged 121.C miles an
hour. Cooper was leading in last year's Thanksgiving Day race at Culver
City, with only seven minutes to go, and had already established three new
world's records, when engine trouble developed and he was forced into fifth
place.
Harry, the young Texas golf professional, is the newcomer into the sport
ing fraternity of Coopers. Harry Cooper first jumped into fame last July
when be shot eighteen holes in sixty strokes, setting a new American record.
Then he stepped out and won the Los Angeles $10,000 open golf tournament
last January, leading one of the greatest fields ever assembled.
