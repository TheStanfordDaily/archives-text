CHILE: A LAND OF ROMANCE
Clouds were clouding across the
i cloudy Florida sky. A storm seemed
near; but that doesn't make a bit of
difference in this story as our scene
I is laid in the saltpeter beds off the
| arid coast of Chile. In fact, not a cloud
was in sight in the clear pre-Andean
ether. The reason for this cloudless
sky is fully explained in every geo
graphy book that has ever been writ
ten; so we need not bother with ex
planations here.
Our hero is discovered wearily
sleeping on a nitrate bed. His thin
and faithful mule can be discerned
,grazing in a nearby pasture. (The pas
ture is merely a desert mirage, but
the reflexts of the thin and faithful
mule have been so conditioned by mir
age pastures that he readily goes
through all the motions of enjoying
a meal. For further information of
mules and reflexes see the psychology
department.)
On closer examination of the hero
who is sleeping on the hard nitrate
bed, we find that he is worn and un
shaven. His eyes are entirely sur
rounded by deep rings, indicating, of
course, a lack of sleep; his nose is
red, probably from excessive sunburn; i
his forehead is steeped and high, indi
cating, of course, that he passed the;
intelligence test; and his clothes,
faultlessly unkempt, reveal him to be !
a college man.
The lean and faithful mule, finish
ing his repast, strayed over to eye his
master critically.
"I think he has slept long enough," |
thought the mule to himself. (For fur
ther information on what mules think
see the head of the R.0.T.C.)
Suiting action to words, the lean
and faithful mule withdrew a few
paltry paces and let fly at the reclin-j
ing figure of our hero with all of the
legs that were attached to the aft I
part of his body. The reclining figure,
who is none other than our hero, j
turned over, of course; in fact, he'
turned over several times. Fully
awake, he jumped to his feet, rubbing
the last, remnants of sleep out of his
eyes with one sweep of his hand.
"You . . . he cried, shaking with
"You .... you." he cried, shaking
with fury, "vou . . He stopped
abruptly, realizing that he was south
of the Mason and Dixon line where it
was highly dangerous to make ques
tionable remarks about people's an
cestry.
High above the dramatic scene be
low, an owl circled in the clear, blue,
cloudless sky. Now this owl must not
be thought to be liko every other owl,
for if he were like every other owl
he would have been asleep in a tree-!
top and not soaring around in the
clear, blue, cloudless sky.
"That's funny," thought the owl.
(For further information on what
owls think, see Aesop's fables.)
Night had fallen while the owl was
thinking; night lias a way of falling
at times. The tired and worn hero and
J

his lean and faithful mule were now
enshrouded in darkness.
A beautiful yellow moon climbed up
over the Andes, and presently the
whole countryside was light as day;
the mule and the man could now see
each other. But that does not make
: a bit of difference to our story, as we
| are concerned with finding out why
: our hero —obviously a college man—
was in such an out-of-way place at
such an hour and with such a mule.
Let us inquire of the owl. But where
is the owl? Still thinking up in the
deep blue sky, of course. Perhaps he
is straining himself thinking; perhaps
it isn't any strain; anyhow, it doesn't
matter.
"What is the bronzed man doing
who is sleeping on the nitrate bed?"
repeated the owl in his best Chilean.
"Well, I overheard the mule talking
jin his sleep the other night, and he
i said something about searching for
the end of a theory of relativity. Ein
stein, did you say? No, I believe the
mule said something different than
I that. Oh, yes, I have it exactly now.
I The chap is searching for evidence on j
the relativity of the famous collegiate 1
remark, Yeah, and they kicked him
I so far off the campus that he is still 1
J going'."
