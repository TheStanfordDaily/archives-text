# TELEPHONE STILL SUPREME OVER TELEPATHY PROFESSOR J. E. COOVER CONDUCTS EXPERIMENTS TESTS FAIL TO PROVE THOUGHT TRANSMISSION
## 
### 
Imagine how unnecessary the tele
phone, telegraph, and wireless would
be if mental telepathy was ever usable
as a means of flashing a message to
the mind of a friend. People are con
tinually having experiences which
they identify as mental telepathy or
telepathic thought transference, and
throughout the world can be found
mediums who claim that they possess
the power to receive thoughts from
the minds of others. But after conduct
ing more than 10,000 experiments in
this field, Professor John Edgar
Coover, of the Psychology department,
has failed to find any trace of thought
transferrence in spite of the fact that
the character of the subjects tested
was especially favorable. Most of
these experiments were made upon
select students, and approximately one
thousand of them were carried on
with mediums.
Uses Students
In order to get the best material
for his experiments with students, Pro
fessor Coover selected those most fa
vored in the large classes in psy
chology. Those who were to attempt
to transmit their thoughts to the minds
of others by the process of mental
telepathy, had faith in their ability to
make someone turn around by willing
it. Those who were to receive the
thoughts had previously experienced
telepathy or believed in the efficacy
of the "feeling of being stared at."
Coover set about his work by experi
menting with this "feeling," a most
common phenomenon. He placed a
"thought-sender" and a "thought-re
ceiver" alone in a room and started
the test.
These two sat at opposite ends of
the room with backs towards each
other. A rap on the table by the
"thought-sender" indicated the begin
ning of the experiment, and a second
rap signified the end. Sometimes the
"sender" would stare, and at other
times he would not. Every time a
single experiment was completed the
person on the receiving end of the
test would record whether he thought j
he was being stared at. He would rate j
his impression as to whether his "feel
ing of being stared at" was strong or
weak. After his set of one hundred
experiments had been completed, the
receiver told how many times he ex
pected his guesses to be right beyond
the fifty per cent allowance for chance.
This allowance was made because if
there were only two ways to guess,
practically fifty per cent of the guesses
would be correct in a hundred at
tempts.
Theories Unrelated
In almost every case the receiver
was positive that the number of coinci
dences would far exceed the figure set
as correct by chance. If the coinci
dences or correct guesses had ex
ceeded this fifty per cent by any
fair measure, telepathy would have
been proven reliable. But, the
final results showed that the number
of coincidences had exceeded this
fifty per cent by any fair measure,
telepathy would have been proven re
liable. But, the final results showed
that the number of coincidences
reached almost exactly fifty per cent.
Thus, it was shown that there is no
relation between the "feeling of being
stared at" and the fact of staring, and
it was proved that the "feeling" was
wholly unreliable.
Professor Coover then conducted ex
periments with playing cards which
conclusively proved that thoughts
were not transferred by mental tele
pathy, although the experiences of
those carrying out the experiment led
them to expect accuracy and a proof
of telepathy in their results. The per
sons trying to transmit the name,
color, or suit of a particular card
drawn from a stripped deck exerted
every effort to bring about kinesthetic,
visual, or auditory impressions in the
mind of the subject, but to no avail.
Experiments with Mediums
The results of the one thousand ex
periments with mediums proved that
thought transference was no more
successful with this type than with

| the normal persons. The latter group
' was found to have the same experi
ences as mediums, as far as thought
transmission was concerned.
"Many mediums are fakes, but oth
ers are sincere," says Professor
Coover. "At their seances they easily
pass into a secondary personality or
trance, during which they themselves
are often found to produce phenomena
about which in their waking state they
know nothing except what they are
told by their sitters. Their sitters are
rendered all but helpless as observers
because of the necessary darkness,
and the distraction of singing, which
puts the senses of sight and hearing
out of commission."
Uses Playing Cards
During this period of research with
these "sensitives," Professor Coover
visited one internationally known
semi-professional medium once a week
for nine months in an attempt to de
termine whether it was possible for
her spirit control to receive telepathic
or even supernormal knowledge.
Coover's theory was that if he would
select a playing card from his own
pack and hold it about an inch from
the table face down on the bottom of
the pack, the medium would neces
sarily posses either telepathic or
supernormal knowledge if she is able
to tell what the card it. He even went
so far as to aid her telepathic possi
bilities trying to transmit his thought
of the card's identity to the spirit con
trol.
Sometimes Coover knew what the
card was and at other times he did
not. This was determined by shaking
a dice in a die-box â€”if the number on
the card properly he would be able
the die came odd he looked at the
card he had placed on the bottom of
the pack, but if it came even he did
not look at the card. This was a pre
caution so that if the spirit did call
to tell whether it had used telepathic
or another supernormal power. For if
Coover knew what the card was and
the medium named it correctly it
would show that the medium had re
ceived telepathic knowledge from him.
However, if he had no idea what the
card was and then the medium named
it, the result would show that the
medium possessed clairvoyant or other
supernormal knowledge.
Plead "Poor Condition"
During all this nine months of work
Coover was only able two receive two
guesses from the spirit control, and
these two guesses were wrong. His
subject always pleaded "poor condi
tions" or stated that it had never
learned to do anything like that, and
refused to guess the card.
