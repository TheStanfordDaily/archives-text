# ORDNANCE DIVISION RECEIVES SAMPLES OF WAR EXPLOSIVES
## Specimens Will Be Used by Military Faculty in Powder Courses 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Sixteen samples of powder and ex
plosives used in the guns during the
: Great War have been received by the
Ordnance department, which is under
the command of Captain Frank At
wood. This board of samples is part
of the regular authorized equipment
of an ordnance unit furnished accord
i ing fto government regulations. It
! comes from the Picatinny arsenal, the
largest manufactory of army powder
supplies in the United States.
The specimens will be used in
courses on military powder and explo
sives, given by Captain Atwood and
Professor G. B. Frankforter, of the
Chemistry department. Professor
Frankforter is a reserve major in ord
nance, and served during the war in
the Powder department at Washington.
Powders Classified
The powders are arranged according
to use in the different explosive in
struments. T. N. T. (tri-nitro-toluene),
amatol, and explosive "D" are used
for shells. Amatol, which is similar to
T. N. T., is made in two classes, 80-20
for shells of from 4.7 inches to 9.2
inches in size, and 50-50 for shells
from 75 millimeters to 4.7 inches. Ex
plosive "D" is the most impervious
to shock of the four, and is used in
armour-piercing shells, although its
explosive power is much inferior to
T. N. T.
Bomb explosives include a different
grade of T. N. T. and lyoncite, similar
in substance. These powders vary in
grain size from fine salt to coarse
sawdust, and in color from yellow to
1 orange.
Interesting to note is the fact that
; the mercury fulminate explosive, used
jin primers and detonaters, is simu
! lated in the bottle, because it is so
i sensible to shock that even small vi
i brations are apt to set it off.
Black Powder Not Used
Specimens of black powder were
I shown, although they are not in use
' except for blasting purposes and sa
' luting guns. Grenade powders were
I mostly T. N. T., although some trojan
powder was shown; this is now obso
lete. .
The propellant powders, for use in
| shells varying from 30-caliber rifle
l shells to 12-inch guns, are of varied
forms. These powders are made in
| cylindrical grains, slightly warped
from the drying process, and perfor
ated with one or seven holes through
-1 out the length of the section. These
! holes allow the flame to be distributed
j evenly over the entire area of the
I powder and they insure perfect com
! bustion in minimum time. The grains
i varv in size from those used in 30 1 -
i

caliber rifles, about three-quarters of
a millimeter in diameter and two milli
meters in length, to those used in 12-
inch guns, about one-half inch in
diameter and an inch in length. These
larger sections resemble seaweed in
color. That the powders are not dan
gerous except when confined was
shown by Captain Atwood when he
burned the 12-inch gun powder, while
holding the grain in his hand during
combustion, and blowing it out at will.
In making these powders, the basic
raw product is cotton. When the cot
ton has been washed, it is treated with
nitric and sulphuric acids, forming a
pyrocotton, which is then mixed with
ether and alcohol to make a colloid.
This is pressed into dies of the proper
size, dried, and is then ready for use.
Since the powder must be completely
burned before the projectile leaves the
muzzle of the gun with imUbense velo
city, the grains must be thoroughly
dried and made to burn in less than
one-hundredth of a second. The size
| of the grains depends on the type of
â–  gun, the weight of the charge, the
| weight of the projectile, and the dis
i tance which it is to be thrown.
