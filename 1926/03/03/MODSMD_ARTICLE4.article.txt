# SEARSVILLE WATER IS MADE ODORLESS BY SURFACE DRAIN
## 
### 
A study of water of Searsville
Lake lately made by Dr. Law
rence B. Becking of the Biology
department and his students, re
vealed that the water was drawn
off by a pipe at the bottom of
the lake where the odor of
hydrogen sulphide was the worst.
As the water is used for irriga
tion purposes there were several
complaints of the disagreeable
odor. *
Dr. Becking found that water
drawn from the top of the lake
had the least odor. His plan to
accomplish this surface drain has
been carried out and there have
been no further complaints.
Further investigations will be
carried on regarding the deposit
of iron in the water, which causes
the red color. The water will
probably be treated so that it will
also be free from this character
istic.
