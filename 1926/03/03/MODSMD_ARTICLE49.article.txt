# QUAD TO FEATURE BIG GAME VICTORY, DRAMATIC SUCCESS
## 
### 
Particular emphasis will be given
in this year's Quad to the Big Game
victory over California ai}d to the suc
cessful campus dramatic season. In
the latter pages of the book individual
pictures of the stars of each produc
tion will appear.
Thirty-nine of the forty-eight pages
devoted to seniors will be used for the
546 senior pictures, fifty-one more than
appeared in the 1925 Quad. A section
given over entirely to the activities
of Stanford women will contain not
only a record of the activities in which
the women have participated, but also
individual pictures of those seniors
and juniors who have been leaders in
dramatics, athletics, publications, gov
ernment, and scholarship.
The Weber-McCreary Company of
Los Angeles has blind-stamped the
covers and is waiting for the approval
of the Quad artists before putting on
the colors. The cover design was made
by Mr. Herbert Langton of the Sierra
Company.
This year three colors instead of
one will bo used on the end sheets
which serve to connect the cover and
the first part of the book. It is de
signed by A. J. Kramel of San Fran
cisco, the artist who executed the col
ored section dividers of the 1925 Quad.
Despite the array of prizes offered
by the Quad for poetry, very little
has been submitted. The deadline for
poetry has been advanced to April 15.
The editor,hopes that more poetry will
be turned in by that date.
