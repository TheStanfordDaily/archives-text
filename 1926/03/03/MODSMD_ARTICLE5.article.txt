## Stanford Mermen Strong in Every Event—Figured To Win Easily 
### H. K 
Next Friday night at the new pool
of the Athena Club of Oakland Stan
ford and California swimming teams
will clash in the aquatic "Big Meet."
Last year Encina pool was the scene
of the contest and California had the
choice of pools this year. The Athens
Club pool is the training place of the
Berkeley swimmers.
Ernst Brandsten aims this year to |
nab, not only all first places, but all j
second positions as well. Material is
plentiful for most of the events, espe
cially the free-style swims.
Carlsmith Fast
Congo Carlsmith has turned in the
fastest time for a single lap of any
of the relay prospects this season and
will probably swim anchor man. Oth
j ers who will swim on the relay are
I Bob Harris and Dutch Fletcher.
! Ernest Wagner, who has already
made 1:17 in the breaststroke race,
will be the varsity hope in this event.
Johnny Mack and Herb Klein will also
| try out in the sailor style swim.
According to reports from Berkeley
i what talent California has is in the
i free-style swims and in the backstroke.
The plunge for distance, diving, and
' breaststroke events are weak. Cliff
I Mayne, captain of the Blue and Gold
! swimming team, will be the Cal hope
in the 50-yard dash. Art Hargraves is
I figured to swim in 100, 200, and back
stroke, or any two of them. Hargraves
swims a fast 220. Captain Mayne has
| also shown possibilities in the back-
I stroke as has Dusty Rhoades.
Allen Backstroke
Arden Allen may set a new Cal
j Stanford record in the backstroke. If
! going well he may touch 1:08. He has
repeatedly gone under the present rec
■ ord time in practice trials. Ted Smith,
a convert from diving, will also swim
lin the backstroke. In the interclass
meet Smith made 1:15 and should get
several seconds under this in the meet.
Carl Stevenson is figured to come
in an easy winner in the 220. If he is
i out to make tinre he should go around
,2:25. Kryne Van den Akker will prob
i ably swim the second Card entry in
! the furlong.
The team is captained by Dave Fall,
who is doped to have a first place in
diving nicely cut out for him. Fall, in
good form, won the interclass contest
last Saturday. Myron Bean and Wal
ter Mills are two other varsity divers
who are showing a world of class.
Sprint swimmers are Bob Williams,
who has good chances of firsts in
both 50 and 100, Phil Brooks, and Bill
Danford in the 50.

Carl Stevenson is figured to come
in an easy winner in the 220. If he is
i out to make tinre he should go around
,2:25. Kryne Van den Akker will prob
i ably swim the second Card entry in
! the furlong.
The team is captained by Dave Fall,
who is doped to have a first place in
diving nicely cut out for him. Fall, in
good form, won the interclass contest
last Saturday. Myron Bean and Wal
ter Mills are two other varsity divers
who are showing a world of class.
Sprint swimmers are Bob Williams,
who has good chances of firsts in
both 50 and 100, Phil Brooks, and Bill
Danford in the 50.
Next Friday night at the new pool
of the Athena Club of Oakland Stan
ford and California swimming teams
will clash in the aquatic "Big Meet."
Last year Encina pool was the scene
of the contest and California had the
choice of pools this year. The Athens
Club pool is the training place of the
Berkeley swimmers.
Ernst Brandsten aims this year to |
nab, not only all first places, but all j
second positions as well. Material is
plentiful for most of the events, espe
cially the free-style swims.
Carlsmith Fast
Congo Carlsmith has turned in the
fastest time for a single lap of any
of the relay prospects this season and
will probably swim anchor man. Oth
j ers who will swim on the relay are
I Bob Harris and Dutch Fletcher.
! Ernest Wagner, who has already
made 1:17 in the breaststroke race,
will be the varsity hope in this event.
Johnny Mack and Herb Klein will also
| try out in the sailor style swim.
According to reports from Berkeley
i what talent California has is in the
i free-style swims and in the backstroke.
The plunge for distance, diving, and
' breaststroke events are weak. Cliff
I Mayne, captain of the Blue and Gold
! swimming team, will be the Cal hope
in the 50-yard dash. Art Hargraves is
I figured to swim in 100, 200, and back
stroke, or any two of them. Hargraves
swims a fast 220. Captain Mayne has
| also shown possibilities in the back-
I stroke as has Dusty Rhoades.
Allen Backstroke
Arden Allen may set a new Cal
j Stanford record in the backstroke. If
! going well he may touch 1:08. He has
repeatedly gone under the present rec
■ ord time in practice trials. Ted Smith,
a convert from diving, will also swim
lin the backstroke. In the interclass
meet Smith made 1:15 and should get
several seconds under this in the meet.
