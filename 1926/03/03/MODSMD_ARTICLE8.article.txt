# HULME SPEAKS ON BUSINESS CAREERS AT ENCINA SMOKER
## 
### 
I "A well-disciplined mind and a rich
personalty are the foundations of a
successful business career," declared
Professor Edward M. Hulme last night
at an Encina Club smoker. Accuracy
iof mind and personal culture are the
attributes desired in non-professional
men by the heads of business organi
| zations, with many of whom he has
discussed the souglit-for qualifications.
Hulme began his talk with a num
ber of reminiscences of his under
graduate days at Stanford thirty years
ago. Then, speaking to those who look
forward to non-professional occupa
i tions, he declared that the mental
; powers, such as analysis, judgment,
l and the quality of human sympathy,
necessary in business men, are only
developed through study of the arts.
Efficiency of method is valueless un
less guided by fine personal ideals,
which come from familiarity with his
tory, literature, and philosophy,
i "But the best philosophy is that
I which you learn yourself," he con
' eluded. "The sciences fail to bring out
these qualities of mind."
Lawrence I). Lewis, chairman of
the smoker committee, presided at the
meeting. Frederick N. Tyroler's orches
tra entertained with popular songs,
and Frank R. Sauliere read Kipling's
"Ladies." Theodore Criley and Rich
i ard H. Hall gave a short exhibition of
I fencing, following Hulme's address.
