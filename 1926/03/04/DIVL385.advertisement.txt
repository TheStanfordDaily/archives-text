When Springtime
Comes!
Watch Your Step—Young Man
In wintertime the World takes only a snap
shot of your shoes—but when Springtime
comes it's different—it takes a time ex
posure.
Because Ambertone and Silvertone prom

in leather made to complement such shades.
The oxford illustrated is made of this leather.
