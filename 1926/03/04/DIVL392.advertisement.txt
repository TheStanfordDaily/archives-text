'The Clash of the Wolves*
With June Marlowe, Charles
Farrell, Heinie Conklin, and
RIN TIN TIN
The burning 1 forest fires on the
high Sierras; the shimmering
vistas of the painted desert; a
vivid drama of raids in the cattle
country. The story of Lobo, the
wolf, who spread terror through
the Southwest, and of the lovers
who befriended him; a dramatic
romance with everything in it
to entertain you.
