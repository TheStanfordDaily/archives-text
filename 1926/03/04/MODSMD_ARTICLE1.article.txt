# EXPERIENCED CAST IN PRODUCTION OF "GREEN GODDESS"
## Mob Scenes Require Careful Acting to Bring Out Effectiveness 
### Frank Baker 
Crash! The curtain rises. An air
plane wreck is exposed. A group of
excited natives crowd around mutter
ing. Thus opens the first scene in
~"The Green Goddess," playing tomor
row night in the Assembly hall under
the direction of Gordon Davis, and
under the auspices of the English
Club. No roughs' seats will be sold be
cause of the demand for seats and the
expense of production.
This is the last play Davis will di

a trip to New York.
Not only has "The Green Goddess"

sounds and excitement can be fol
lowed the whole off-stage action,
which is a sacrifice, whose gruesome
ness is enhanced by leaving its details
to the imagination of the audience.
