# EXPERIENCED CAST IN PRODUCTION OF "GREEN GODDESS"
## Mob Scenes Require Careful Acting to Bring Out Effectiveness 
### Frank Baker 
Crash! The curtain rises. An air
plane wreck is exposed. A group of
excited natives crowd around mutter
ing. Thus opens the first scene in
~"The Green Goddess," playing tomor
row night in the Assembly hall under
the direction of Gordon Davis, and
under the auspices of the English
Club. No roughs' seats will be sold be
cause of the demand for seats and the
expense of production.
This is the last play Davis will di
rect this year until the summer quar
ter, when he will have returned from
a trip to New York.
Not only has "The Green Goddess"
an experienced cast of principals, but
also a large oast of minor characters
who are important to the play, and
who have been worked into a spon
taneous and well-disciplined troupe.
A truly weird and uncanny atmos
phere is worked up in the last act out
side the temple when the mob is mut
tering native gibberish. By their
sounds and excitement can be fol
lowed the whole off-stage action,
which is a sacrifice, whose gruesome
ness is enhanced by leaving its details
to the imagination of the audience.
Nolan Has Lead
Lloyd Nolan, who has the leading
part as the Raja, first appeared on
the campus stage in the Senior Farce
of 1923, "The Hottentot." In 1924 he
took the leading role in "Captain
Applejack," and a part in the Junior i
Opera. After the spring of 1924 he j
went on the professional stage with j
Arnold Bailey, the "Radio Troubador," :
touring Keith's circuit in the East for
about a year. His first work on re
turning to the campus last fall was
in the Football Gaieties, where he was
the captain in "What Price Phi Bete?"
and also collaborated with Irving An
schutz in a blackface skit.
Helen Lewis, taking the leading and
only important feminine part in the
play, made her debut as leading lady
in "Androcles and the Lion," in the
fall quarter of 1923-24. Last year she
was the lead in "R.U.R.," Karl Kapek's
gruesome satire on the modern ten
dency toward machinery and systema
tization. Miss Lewis is Lucilla, the
wife of Major Crespin.
Garth Winslow is Major Crespin.
He had minor parts in "Macbeth," last
year's English Club play, and in the
Greek play "Agamemnon." This year
he had his first important role as Felix
Armand in the sophomore play, "In
the Next Room."
Wiggin Portrays Cockney
Jack Wiggin, the cocky cockney
valet to the Raja, is well acquainted
with English dialects, having lived in
Bombay, India, for a large part of his
life, and seen a great deal of various
types of Englishmen. Wiggin played
a small part in "The Boomerang," the
Senior Farce of 1924, as his first ap
pearance at Stanford. He has since
been seen in the sophomore play of
3924, "Dulcy," last year's Junior Opera,
"Ace High," the Greek play, "Oedipus
Rex," and the Ram's Head show of
last year, "The Devil's Daughter." Be
sides his dramatic successes, Wiggin
has directed the music for several
musical shows in the last two years.
Sam Hayes is the only member of
the cast who has not been seen before
on the campus stage. He is a fresh
man and is making his initial perform
ance tomorrow night.
The part of the high priest is being
handled by Harold Taylor, who has
played this same Irole before. He was
in "The Green Goddess" in Pasadena
last summer, and so has scarcely
needed any directing in his part. Tay
lor has the physique and training for
the part, and dominates the villagers
and minor priests successfully. He also
has appeared in "What Price Phi
Bete?"
The Stanford Orchestra, under the
direction of Helen Engel Atkinson,
will render the music between acts
and during the show. Several native
songs will be sung by Paul Tenney.

Sam Hayes is the only member of
the cast who has not been seen before
on the campus stage. He is a fresh
man and is making his initial perform
ance tomorrow night.
The part of the high priest is being
handled by Harold Taylor, who has
played this same Irole before. He was
in "The Green Goddess" in Pasadena
last summer, and so has scarcely
needed any directing in his part. Tay
lor has the physique and training for
the part, and dominates the villagers
and minor priests successfully. He also
has appeared in "What Price Phi
Bete?"
The Stanford Orchestra, under the
direction of Helen Engel Atkinson,
will render the music between acts
and during the show. Several native
songs will be sung by Paul Tenney.
Crash! The curtain rises. An air
plane wreck is exposed. A group of
excited natives crowd around mutter
ing. Thus opens the first scene in
~"The Green Goddess," playing tomor
row night in the Assembly hall under
the direction of Gordon Davis, and
under the auspices of the English
Club. No roughs' seats will be sold be
cause of the demand for seats and the
expense of production.
This is the last play Davis will di
rect this year until the summer quar
ter, when he will have returned from
a trip to New York.
Not only has "The Green Goddess"
an experienced cast of principals, but
also a large oast of minor characters
who are important to the play, and
who have been worked into a spon
taneous and well-disciplined troupe.
A truly weird and uncanny atmos
phere is worked up in the last act out
side the temple when the mob is mut
tering native gibberish. By their
sounds and excitement can be fol
lowed the whole off-stage action,
which is a sacrifice, whose gruesome
ness is enhanced by leaving its details
to the imagination of the audience.
