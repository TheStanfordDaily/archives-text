# Runners Vie For Places On Irish Marathon Teams
## 
### Fred Swan 
J Tryouts are going on daily for
j places on the four teams that will
] participate in the Irish marathon next
'Saturday at 1:30 o'clock. Twenty-four
i men will compose each squad. These
| men will be picked from those making
! the fastest times in the quarter-mile
i
I in the trials.
A new event has been added to the
program—a hop-skip-and-jump contest,
j Some difficulty is being encountered
i in arranging a sufficiently hard course
| for the obstacle race.
Three men stand out at the present
! time as prospects to take the varsity
'medals for the best time made on
Saturday—Richardson, Miller, and
; Storie. Richardson has made the best
time this year so far, 0:49 2-5 seconds
in the interclass meet, and should win
the medal. The non-varsity medal is
i an uncertain proposition in which all
hands have an equal chance.
The best time in the tryouts yes
terday was 0-:54, made by Ed Conner,
' a freshman.
