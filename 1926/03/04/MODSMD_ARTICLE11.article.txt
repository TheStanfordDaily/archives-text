"The student in China will replace
the soldier in the administration of
that country, although it may be some
time before the change takes place,"
declared Julean Arnold, United States
commercial in China, who
spoke in the Little Theatre yesterday
afternoon.
"China is in a state of transition
similar to that from the Middle Ages
to the Modern Age, and the outlook
for China is by no means hopeless, but
it may be several years before mili
tary disturbances cease. There is no
caste in China, except that of intel
lect, for the Chinese have always had
a sincere reverence for learning. Pre
vious to the present disturbances, the
scholars were always rulers of the
country," said Arnold. The military
type of leader is illustrated by General
Chang Tso-Lin of the Kiangsu forces,
while General Wu and General Chun
represent the progressive, intellectual
type of leader favored by the students
and cultured people.
"It will be some time before mod
ern education will raise new Chinese
scholars to the ranks of leadership to
overcome those who rose by the gun.
The war is a continually disturbing
element, although it is by no means
bloody. I doubt if there were more
men killed in battle in China last year
than there were by automobile acci
dents in the United States over the
same period of time," continued Ar
nold.
The present form of education in
China is along group ideas rather than
individualistic as in the past, when
the tutor system prevailed. The de
veloping system of universities which
conduct intercollegiate debates and
take an active part in the political
affairs of the country is an important
factor in spreading nationalism.
Arnold declares that the "anti-for
eign element" is an expression of the
new spirit of nationalism and not a
concerted attack upon foreigners.

Along with nationalistic progress
China is developing large business and
industrial units, with many American
business methods being introduced.
