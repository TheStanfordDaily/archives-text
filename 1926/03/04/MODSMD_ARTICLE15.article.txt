# BRUINS WILL MEET STANFORD MERMEN AT OAKLAND POOL
## Cardinals Favored to Win; Yearlings, Varsity Marks Should Fall 
### H. K 
The chain of victories over Califor
nia, unbroken since 1920, will prob
ably be lengthened when the Cardinal
swimmers meet the Blue and Gold to
morrow night at 8 o'clock in the
Athens Club pool in Oakland. Coach
Brandsten thisf year has a number of
swimmers that would put up a good
fight against any college team in the
country. The Stanford swimmers will
be somewhat handicapped because
they are not accustomed to the Athens
Club pool, while the California mer
men have practiced daily in the pool.
A high starting take-off is used at
the Athens pool, but this should add
to the speed of the sprint races if
the men master the start.
Bob Williams in the 50 and 100,
Carl Stevenson in the 220, Arden Al
len in the backstroke, Charles
Wagner in the breaststroke, and Cap
tain Dave Fall or Walter Mills in the
diving, are men that Brandsten counts
upon for his first places. Rosenbaum
and Hotchkiss will be the plungers.
The relay team is made up of Arden
Allen, Dutch Fletcher, Bob Harris, and
Congo Carlsmith. If these men go
their best the present California-Stan
ford 400-foot relay record of 1:06 4-5
will go by the boards. Other records
that are likely to fall are the 100-yard
backstroke and the 220-yard free style,
which Allen and Stevenson, respec
tively, should set.
Although the freshman team is not
equally strong all around, a victory is
expected. In two events, the breast
stroke and the plunge, the babes' rep
resentatives could trim the varsity's
best men, but they are not so strong
in the free-style sprints and the 220.
Cece West, the yearling breast
stroke surprise, can turn in a 1:15 for
the 100 on any occasion and this week
made 3:07 in the 220. Ingraham, the
star freshman plunger, made 70 feet
in the interclass meet, which is within
two feet of the varsity record.
