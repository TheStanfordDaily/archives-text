# SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO MEET STANFORD NINE IN TWO GAMES
## U.S.C. Strength Unknown; Sobieski, Collins Will Take Mound 
### Herb Klein 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock
Stanford and U.S.C. varsity nines will
| meet in the first intercollegiate game
I to be played by either team this sea
-1 son. On Saturday afternoon the final
; game of the series will be held.
J- Tod Oviatt, star twirler of the Stan
| ford nine, has been declared ineligible
! lor further competition. Oviatt passed
| in only nine units of work last fall
| quarter, and has played in two games
; this season. The rules state that when
,an ineligible man represents his uni
versity in any form of athletic compe
j tition, he loses one year of play.
This was to have been Oviatt's last
J season, so he will be unable to pitch
| again for Stanford.
Have Even Chance
Coach Harry Wolter figures that
| his men have at least an even chance
to defeat the Trojans, whose strength
as a team is still an unknown quantity.
! The only games played by the South
erners so far this season have been
against minor teams, so that compar
| ative scores tell little. Sam Crawford,
| U.S.C. coach, has several men of out
j standing ability on his squad, but suf
fers from a lack of dependable
i pitchers.
Harry Wolter will count on the two
' moundsmen who have so far shown
| class and consistency. Steve Collins
i will start in the box tomorrow and
I Count Sobieski on Saturday. Collins
| a week ago pitched a live-hit, two-run
game against the strong Klawans and
McMullin outfit, which was made up
mostly of league material of real hit
j ting ability. He has improved some in
; steadiness since that time, and should
be able to hold the less effective col
lege hitters to a low earned-hit score.
Sobieski has finished on the mound
in all but one of the games that the
| Cards have played this season. He re
placed Philippi in the middle of the
! Kenealy Seals game last Wednesday
; and tossed good ball. His speed is a
■ valuable asset and will probably be
, more effective against the Trojans
| than it has been against the semi-pro
veterans
Practice Batting
Batting practice has occupied a
large part of the workout periods of
the varsity squad. Considerable im
provement has shown itself in the
slugging of the past few days. Wolter
feels that his men are in good condi
tion and are on edge.
Coney Galindo shares with Vic Or
j satti the reputation of being the star
of the Trojan outfit. Galindo was a
freshman fielder last year but may
have to be used this year in the in
field. Orsatti, stellar third-sacker, is
rated at U.S.C. as the most valuable
man on the team.
Hobbs Adams, football captain, also
leads the Trojan nine this year and
plays regularly in center field. During
his sophomore year he was the sec
ond best batter on the team, but his
J stick work suffered a slump last sea
son.
Bert Pullens, a sophomore, is a
leading candidate for the outfield. Mor
ris Badgro, regularly a first baseman,
; broke his arm in football and will
j have to start in the field. •
