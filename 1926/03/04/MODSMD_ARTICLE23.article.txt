# Unpleasant Necessities
## 
### 
When the quarter is drawing to a close and athletic and political prob
lems are being eclipsed by impending examinations, it is customary for the
editor of the Daily to produce startling information on the subject of
examinations. Sixty-eight editors have tried their hand. The results
have l>een varied.
One editor has criticized the students who receive "A" grades, pointing
out that often the "A" college man is the "B" man after graduation; and
that many of the "B" men develop into "A" men when they release their
hold on the apron-strings of their alma mater and face the cruel and
brutal world. He shows that often the "A" man is merely the retainer of
the knowledge of someone else, while often the "B" man reacts to thoughts
of.others and makes them his own.
Another editor skips daintily over the consideration of finals. He
looks on them as the unpleasant means to a delightful end—a few days of
vacation when one can forget the ordeal that one has undergone.
In the first place, the editor who confines his discussion to "A" and "B"
students must have been an idealist or at least an optomist. He does not
even give passing mention to the great number who are hovering on the
brink of class average—those whom examinations hit the hardest, not those
who hit the examinations hardest.
The editor who considered vacations as a period of complete relaxa
tion also miscued, for he has failed to take into account those students
who for ten days after they have taken their last final shiver whenever a
shrill whistle proclaims the arrival of the mail carrier. He gives no promi
nence to that moment when the self-addressed envelope is opened with
trembling hands.
Verily, the battle for grades is a great institution. But as long as there
is the competitive element, examinations are necessary; and as our civili
zation itself is based on competition, we can see no substitute for tests.
Let's make the best of them.
