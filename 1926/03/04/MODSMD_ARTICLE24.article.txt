Gordon Davis closes a brilliant season tomorrow night with a fitting
climax, "The Green Goddess." There has been no year, perhaps, that has
brought so much credit to the University as the present dramatic year,
and to Gordon Davis goes the lion's share of the praise and glory. It has
been his aim to foster only the excellent and the unusual in drama and
comedy and the closing year bears witness to a goal attained.
Few directors have the complex audiences, the ancient equipment, and
the amateur talent that act to pile troubles upon the shoulders of Davis.
Yet the Assembly" hall is filled to overflowing at each performance and an
enjoyable evening is spent by one and all —faculty, townspeople, roughs,
and ordinary students —through the wise selections of the director.
Students trained in stage-management wondered if Davis had not
made a mistake in choosing "The Green Goddess" with which to ring down
the curtain 011 the year's work. It has been produced in London and New
York but only after expensive set construction which seemed impossible
to reproduce 011 the University stage. Davis seems to have overcome all
difficulties, however, and rehearsals indicate that the audience tomorrow
night will view a production worthy to be the season's finale.
