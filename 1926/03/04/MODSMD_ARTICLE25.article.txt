# Y.M.C.A. REPORTED MAKING PROGRESS WITH FUND DRIVE
## 
### 
Progress is being made in the
Y.M.C.A. drive, although more contri
butions are expected before the close
of the campaign. John Duniway,
finance chairman of the 'Y," is direct
ing the work, and has a well-organized
force under him. The popular appeal
of the "Stanford in China" movement,
and the Student Friendship Fund, be
sides the support of the local associa
tion, has been clearly shown in the
response by the students.
Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Com
merce and graduate of Stanford, in a
recent address to the Forty-second
International Convention of the Young
Men's Christian Associations of the
United States and Canada, said that
the Y.M.C.A. has a position of advan
tage in a normal approch to youth.
"As such, you have a valid claim on
the moral and financial support of
all," he concluded.
