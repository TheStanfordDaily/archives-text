# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is a real Champion, a four-footed beast with a
man's name, who has set a record that it seems will defy
the best attempts of the equine race for years to come.
For a time trotting and pacing records were broken at
every meeting, for rapid improvements were made in the
sulkies that eliminated unnecessary weight and air resist
ance. But. for years and years no one connected with the
game believed that a horse would ever trot a mile in two
minutes or better.
So take a good look at Peter Manning, the world's
champion, who, at Lexington, Kentucky, on October 4, 1922,
trotted a mile against time in one minute, fifty-six and
three-quarters seconds! This remarkable bay gelding, which
is now in his tenth year, also holds the world's record for
two miles, having done the double circuit of the track in
4:10 1-4, last August, at North Randall, Ohio.

Harness racing celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 1924, and in that
time ihe record for the mile had been reduced almost a full minute. In 1524
Topgallant trotted three miles in 8:42, or at the rate of 2:54 for the mile, at
Jamaica, Long Island, and two years later the first trotting club opened its
track at Centreville, N.Y.
The great trotters of the twentieth century have been Lou Dillon, the first
horse to trot a mile in less than two minutes, and who did 1:58% in 1903;
Uhlan, 1:58*4 (1910) and 1:58 (1912); and Peter Manning, 1:57% (1921), and
1:57 and 1:56% (1922). Lou Dillon, C. K. G. Billings' chestnut mare, died a
year ago in Santa Barbara, California, at the age of 27, leaving her stablemate
Uhlan to mourn her. Uhlan trotted a mile in 1:54% in 1913 with a running
mate. But Peter Manning is still going strong.
