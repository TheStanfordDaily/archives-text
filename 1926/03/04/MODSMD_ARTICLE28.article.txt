POME OF DISGUST
Bali! I feel so doggone bum,
Rot! The weather's too darn fine.
Bunk! Spring fever's going some,
Bull! It's just her oily line.
Gee! I wish I had some dough.
Shoot! litre's finals coming up.
Darn! I know I'm awfully slow.
Gosh! I knew he was a pup.
Hell! The world is rotten, too.
Damn! I guess I'll flunk this course.
Aw! I never felt so blue.
Hah! My kingdom for a horse.
Piffle! Now the car is wrecked.
Golly! Where's my woman at?
Curses! Course she's often necked.
Hey! My roomie's got my hat.
Blah! There ain't no justice now.
Beans! They ought to tan his hide.
Rats! Why keep a bally cow?
Thanks! I liked the buggy ride.

CURRENT TOPICS
Spring has came!
Lagunita is full —so is the moon.
And belligerent bullfrogs croak little
love-ditties to the fair females of their
hearts' desire —so do Stanford stu
dents.
We refer—
To the Rowing Romeos in their
roaming red canoes.
Who spend these lazy evenings pre
paring for their finals
By studying the constellations and
listening to lectures by the Man in the
Moon with the aid of the All Embrac
ing knowledge of some wise and win
some maiden.
—0—
We must admit —

romantic Cabbages, and a mysterious
Inner Urge compels us to quote for
the 9,990,780 th time that justly fam
ous line given to the world by the
immortal lips of Napoleon at the Bat
tle of Waterloo:
"In the spring a young man's fancy
turns to — necking."

Cabbages wants to know why spring,
final exams, and the full moon all
come at the same time. They agree

Rarebit before going to bed.

"You're all wet." he said to her

had tipped over yesterday.
"So's your Old Man," she replied
gaily as she clambered ashore and
teasingly pushed his father off the
landing into the cool wet water.

Rot! The weather's too darn fine.
Bunk! Spring fever's going some,
Bull! It's just her oily line.
Gee! I wish I had some dough.
Shoot! litre's finals coming up.
Darn! I know I'm awfully slow.
Gosh! I knew he was a pup.
Hell! The world is rotten, too.
Damn! I guess I'll flunk this course.
Aw! I never felt so blue.
Hah! My kingdom for a horse.
Piffle! Now the car is wrecked.
Golly! Where's my woman at?
Curses! Course she's often necked.
Hey! My roomie's got my hat.
Blah! There ain't no justice now.
Beans! They ought to tan his hide.
Rats! Why keep a bally cow?
Thanks! I liked the buggy ride.
