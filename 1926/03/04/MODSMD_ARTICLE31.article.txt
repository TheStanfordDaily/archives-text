# SCOTCH STUDENTS RIDE TO CLASS ON HUGE MOTORCYCLES
## 
### 
Students in Scotland don't walk to
their classes. Instead they ride huge,
seven-horsepower motorcycles, accord- j
ing to Paul Morand of the University
of Minnesota., who spent several years
teaching in European universities. Ac
cidents ofen occur, resulting in a
broken leg or two, when these intrepid
motorists take a fall.
In comparing foreign with American
universities, Morand said that students
here seem to care more for a good
time than do the students abroad.
French students go to college to study
rather than find a life of social enter-!
tainment. There are no clubs, fraterni
ties, or sororities abroad. Students do
not chum together, and men. very in
frequently take out French college
women, for they are not as attractive
as American girls. Morand found that
pretty girls In American universities
are not usually bothered by studies.
He stated that sports are popular in
France, and losing popularity in north
ern England, while Scotland has a race
of hardy athletes.
