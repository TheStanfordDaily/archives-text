# SCHEDULE OF WORK CHANGES DAILY AT REGISTRAR'S OFFICE
## 
### 
I Perhaps in 110 other executive de
' partment of the University is there
greater variation in the daily routine
than in the Registrar's office. Here
the work changes as the quarter pro
gresses. Regardless of what else is at
hand, however, Registrar J. Pearce
Mitchell can always count 011 a heavy
correspondence for him and his as
sistants to handle. This is one of the
chief duties of his office, as requests
for pamphlets and catalogues alone
run into many thousands yearly.
The most important correspondence
is that dealing with publications for
admission. This class of mail is par
ticularly heavy since many more apply
for admission than can be admitted.
Membership in numerous adminis
trative and academic committees also
calls for a good deal of Professor
Mitchell's time. These include the
Men's Athletic, Scholarship, Voca
tional Guidance, Executive, Gradua
tion, Schedule and Examinations, Ad
mission and Advanced Standing, Regis
tration and Lower Division commit
tees. Of the latter three he is chair
man. Then, too, on Tuesday and Thurs
day mornings Professor Mitchell lec
tures before his class in Chemistry 9.
In slack times, the registrar's office
is engaged in research work, deter
mining the effectiveness of the intelli
gence test, and in making out grade
point averages. Petitions of all sorts
continually pour into the office. All
applications for admission are re
ceived there, too, and the credentials
inspected and the applicants are noti
fied by the registrar of their success
or failure.
Most of the pamphlets and bulletins
issued by the University are arranged
and edited by this office, and it is !
here that the Lower Division records j
are kept and checked.
"Yes, we have quite a variety of!
occupations around here," concluded j
Professor Mitchell, "and by the way,
don't fail to mention the information
desk, to which students come asking
anything from what the tuition in the
medical school is to where one can
get a drink of water."
