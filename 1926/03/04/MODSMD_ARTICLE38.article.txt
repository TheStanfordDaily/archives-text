Most of the popular games that are
played today originated in the Middle
Ages, according to Professor W. T.
Waugh, of McGill University.
Tennis was originally played with
balls composed of dogs' hairs, and the
batting was done with the bare hands.
The game was so popular in France
that in 1292, there were thirteen mak
ers of tennis balls in Paris to only
eight booksellers.
The game as it is known now was
only introduced about sixty years ago.
The man who drew up the rules at
that time, according to Professor
Waugh, based them largely on the his
torical facts at his disposal.
