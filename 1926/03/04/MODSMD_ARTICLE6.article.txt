# SOPHOMORES DEFEAT JUNIORS IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL SERIES
## 
### 
Stronger and better organized than
their opponents, the sophomores de
feated the juniors 2G to 16 in what
'was virtually the deciding game of the
women's championship basketball
series yesterday afternoon. The jun
iors suffered badly in this game by
] the absence of two of their best play
j ers, Charlotte Lovekin, guard, and
, Ethelind Thompson, forward.
The juniors made their best show
ing in the second quarter, when Nel
lie Shepherd, forward, made several
! goals in quick succession, bringing
j the score from 5 to 1, in favor of the
| sophomores, at the end of the first
| period, to 9 to 6 at the half. Marie
Manchee, who was shifted forward
in place of Astrid Arnoldson in the
fourth quarter, scored several times in
the last-minute effort of the juniors to
i overcome the sophomore lead.
The sophomores have yet to meet
the freshmen, but the latter have lost
jto both the seniors and the juniors,
and are not expected to provide an
j upset to the 1928 squad's hopes. The
juniors meet the seniors next week,
: and are also favored to win in their
j last game.
