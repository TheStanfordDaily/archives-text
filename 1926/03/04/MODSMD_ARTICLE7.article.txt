I3y breaking loose in the fifth in
i ning of a seven-inning game to score
i four runs on a hit and an error, the
j Stanford freshmen defeated the San
Mateo Union High School nine yes
! terday by a 5 to 0 score. The game
| was played on the new sunken dia
! inond east of the varsity field.
San Mateo opened the fifth inning
by going out in rapid-fire order. Then
the yearlings began their racing
| around the bases. Wilton was safe at
i first, and Davis beat out a bunt. Mar
! shall, San Mateo pitcher, threw away
his game by heaving the ball over the
■ first baseman's head, Wilton going to
i third and Davis continuing to second
'on the play. McCandless flied out to
j Marshall; Muller hit to Cook, who j
| threw home, but Wilton scored as
j Tassi dropped the ball. Davis was safe
I at third while Muller traveled on to
I
i second. Lewis, yearling hurler, step
j ped to the plate and hit a three-bagger
| to right center, Davis and Muller scor
ing. Hartley hit to shortstop, who j
j threw home, but Lewis ran in, scoring j
' as Tassi again dropped the ball.
The freshmen finished the scoring
! for the game in the last half of the
1 sixth, when McKey hit safely. Harder
pounded out a nice two-bagger, McKey;
coming in for the last tally.
D. Lewis, the Cardinal twirler,
pitched excellent ball, striking out
nine men and walking only two. Coach
Husky Hunt says that he is as good j
now as last year's freshman pitchers ;
were at this time of the season.
Marshall, who pitched for San Ma-'
teo, had a freak delivery. He struck i
out but one man, but no Stanford ;
player reached first by the free-pass
route. His teammates gave him good
support, pulling one double play.
The freshman lineup is as follows: j
Hartley, 2b; Rogers, ss; McKey, If;
Harder, 3b; Wilton, cf; Davis, rf;
jMarks, rf; McCandless, lb; Muller, c; ,
