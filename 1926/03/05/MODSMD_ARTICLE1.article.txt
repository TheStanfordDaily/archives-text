oeem to have much show.

season, and should win in easy style.
Carl Stevenson and Kryne van den
Akker will swim the furlong. Steven
son, on the basis of times this season,
has things all his own way, and Van
den Akker will have an opportunity
to avenge his defeat by Gilson in the
freshrman meet last year. Rosenbaum
and Hotclikiss will plunge, handicap
ped by a strange pool with higher
take-off, but have lots of floating
ability.
The freshman line-up is as follows:
50-yard free style. Hunter, Tliurlow;
100-yard free style, Sexson, Hunter;
220-yard free style, Burns, Strongel;
100-yard backstroke, Cole, West;
plunge, Ingraliam, Weigle; relay, Val
entine, Thurlow, Thon, Foster.
Stanford's varsity and freshman
swimming teams will meet their Cali
fornia opponents in the pool of the
Athens Club of Oakland tonight at 8
o'clock. Ernst Brandsten and both
squads leave for the city this after
noon and expect to return with a dou
ble victory.
The varsity is doped to win hands
down, but the freshman meet is more
of an unknown quantity. The first
year men are strong in some events
but below par in the free style sprints.
Captain Dave Fall and Walter Mills
represent the Cards in diving. Both
have been going well lately, Mills
especially having improved to such
an extent that he defeated Fall in
one of the tryouts. Cox and Couper
are the Bear entrants.
Williams Sprints Ace
Bob Williams will compete in both
50- and 100-yard free style sprints.
Bill Danford is the second man in
the 50 and Phil Brooks in the 100.
Castelazo is the California hope in
the 50. He won the half century race
when a freshman last year and has
lots of speed, which he demonstrated
by his sprinting in the California-
Stanford water polo game. Cliff Mayne,
captain of the Berkeley mermen, is
also entered in the 50. Don Gilson,
who took the freshman 220 last year,
is entered in this race and the 100
this year. He has improved greatly,
according to notices from California.
Arden Allen should break the Cali
fornia-Stanford record in the back
stroke with Ted Smith not very far
behind. Seaborn and Legge, the two
Blue and Gold backstrokers, do not
oeem to have much show.
Wagner in Breaststroke
Charles Wagner and Herb Klein are
the Card breaststrokers. They will
•compete with Merril and Murman of
California. Wagner has hit 1:17 this
season, and should win in easy style.
