# SENIORS WIN CLASS BASEBALL TITLE BY DOWNING BABES 2-0
## 
### 
! Air-tight pitching by Brock enabled
I the senior team to down the freshman
j squad, 2 to o', and win the interclass
| championship in a game played yes
! terday on the freshman field. The 1929
| team was helpless against Brock and
j failed to advance a man to third base.
Though the seniors have one more
! interclass tilt to play before they
close their campaign, the victory
; cinches the title regardless of the
outcome of their game Monday against
! the juniors. As a result of their de
feat, the freshmen tied for second
place with the sophomore aggregation,
j The juniors cannot elevate their stand
j ing even by trimming the undefeated
; senior team.
i Kerns pitched a good game for the
, losers, but the breaks went against
| him. Two of the four senior hits were
j bunched together, and the only error
j made by the freshmen came with a
| man on third. Kerns struck out eight
j men in the five innings, which is an
| unusual record, and he did not walk
a man.
The 192G team scored in the second
inning when, with one out, Stockbridge
j singled, stole second, and scored on
Brown's hit. Kern ended the hitting
| at this point by fanning the next two
| batters. The seniors tallied again in
the fourth when Wright, 1929 short
| stop, fumbled the ball and allowed
| Bigelow, who had reached third on a
; one-bagger, a steal, and an out, to
; reach home unmolested. The babes
j tried desperately to rally in the last
| inning but they seemed fated to lose
|as three drives to the outfield went
j straight to a fielder who snagged them.
The seniors meet the junior team
;at 4:15 o'clock Monday afternoon on
'the Military Field. The battery for the
1 seniors will be Brock and Bigelow,
• while the juniors will start Hunter
i and Scherer.
