# BABE NET, BASEBALL MEN PLAY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coach Husky Hunt's fast-climbing
freshman nine opposes Polytechnic
high school of San Francisco at 10
o'clock tomorrow morning on the var
sity diamond. The preps won the San
Francisco city championship last year
and have developed another strong
outfit this season, but the Cardinal
yearlings are doped to take them into
camp.
The first-year tennis team meets
Berkeley high school on the varsity
courts, also at 10 o'clock. In view of
their one-sided victory over Palo Alto
high last week the freshmen should
win without much trouble.
