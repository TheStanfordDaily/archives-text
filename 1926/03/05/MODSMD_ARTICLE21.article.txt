# Support for Minor Sports

Tomorrow is the big night of the year for Cardinal fencers and gym
nasts. They meet their rivals, from California in the Encina gym at 7 :45
o'clock in what should prove very interesting competitions. Second-class
minor sports have received scarcely any recognition in the past, chiefly
because they are not as well known as the other sports.
Fencers have brought just as much glory in their field to Stanford as
have athletes in other lines in spite of the fact that the great majority of
students have never seen a fencing match. The same is true of gymnasts.
Coach Charles W. Davis has turned out a pair of first-class teams which
should give a good account of themselves tomorrow. Stanfordites who
forego the movies for one night and go down to the gym will be well re
paid in enjoyment, and the men on the teams will feel that their year s
practice has not been in vain.
