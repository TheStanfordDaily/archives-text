# Stanford Glee Club Will Present Program at U. C.
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club, under the |
leadership of Warren D. Allen will
present its repertoire of solo and en- j
semble songs at the University of Cali- j
fornia Wheeler Auditorium tonight at 1
8:30 o'clock. Several exclusive Glee,
Club novelty numbers will alternate'
with the vocal groups. The concert
was to have been one side of an ex- j
change with the Berkeley Glee Club
but the recent resignation of the Cali
fornia singers from campus activity
makes it impossible for them to sing
here.
