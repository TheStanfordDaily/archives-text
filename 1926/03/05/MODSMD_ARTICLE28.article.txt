CABBAGES—MUST j
THE RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO
By Letitia Lemon
Episode IX
A LOCKOUT
I had not the slightest idea which
John Smith was to take me to the
play. The voice I had heard over the
telephone seemed more like that of
the man I had met at a jolly-up and 1
accepted the invitation in the hope,
that it was. Had 1 been certain that
it was the peculiar-appearing red-j
headed freshman who had followed
me. I would not have accepted.
From the time I received the invita
tion to the night of the play, my room
mate, Maurathea Providence, and her
friend, Rosamond Thorn, talked con
stantly of a mysterious person whom
they referred to as the "Red Peril." j
From their descriptions he seemed to j
he a fiend in human form. 1 little;
guessed that the subject of their con
versation had any connection with my
self (b"t I soon was to fid that, it i
did). On the night of the play I
answered my bell call in expectancy
and went to the lobby hoping to see
my favorite "John Smith" there. But
the man whom I met was the red
headed John Smith. 1 could not refuse
to go to the play with him after hav
ing unconsciously accepted his invita
tion, so I greeted him graciously but
with dignity.
My roommate and Rosamond Thorn
were standing near the door talking
to two men. As my escort opened the
door for me they saw us and as I
stepped outside I heard them both
almost scream:
"The Red Peril"
I wanted to turn back and fly to my
room, but it was too late. The door
had slammed behind us. I was out with
the "Red Peril" (so I thought). I must
accept my plight and say nothing.
I did not, however, find anything in
the disposition of my escort to cause
me the least misgiving. He had a
pleasant manner of speaking (despite
his horn-rimmed glasses), and acted
altogether like a gentleman. I enjoyed
the evening immensely. In fact I
seemed to have entirely foreotten thpt
this man was almost a stranger to
me. The "Red Peril" held no terror
for me (as yet).
On the way home my escort said:
"Wouldn't you like to see the cactus
garden by moonlight?"
"Yes," I answered eagerly, my fond
ness for the place overcoming my
better judgment.
I will not trouble my readers with
the details of what followed. Suffice
it to say that my escort attempted to
kiss me. Why 1 was not seized with
indignation at his presumption I do
not know, but I resisted him without
difficulty. (I was not entirely con
scious that another automobile stopped
L\iiiind us, but I was to learn on the
next day what its purpose was there.)
John Smith (of the red hair) pleaded
with me in vain. He seemed almost
desperate. For some reason I was

fascinated with his entreaties. 1 did
not realize that the time was passing
so rapidly.
Presently I looked at my watch. It!
was 1:40. My worst apprehension was
realized. 1 was locked out. So com
plete was my despair that I broke i
into tears. To think that such a thing
should happen to me, Letitia Lemon.
John Smith attempted to comfort
me. I was so disconsolate that I al
lowed him momentarily to put his
arm about me. Then my remorse sud-,
denly gave way to indignation.
"Take me home at once," I de- j
manded.
"Please let me kiss you," he pleaded
(he seemed almost in tears himself).
"No," I replied, "only the man to
whom I become engaged shall kiss
me."
He looked at me for a moment. Then
his face took on an expression of
boundless determination.
"Could we?" he asked.
Why was I not surprised? Why did
my remorse and anger leave me?
Something cool and refreshing seemed
to sweep over me. I lookd out to
where the full moon shown on a great
century plant. There seemed some
thing eternal in that picture.
"Could we be engaged?" he repeated.
I wondered if I was losing my rea
son. 1 seemed to be dreaming.
"Yes," I answered. (I do not know
whether I intended to say "No" or
not.)
"Now may I kiss you?" He seemed
almost triumphant.
I hesitated. Then, "Yes."
Five minutes later I was being
scolded severely by the matron of the
hall but it seemed that nothing could
make me regret the lockout.
