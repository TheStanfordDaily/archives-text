# Youth Freer Now Than Before War Declares Jordan
## 
### 
"The war broke the crust of society
all over the world, and as a result wo
have had more freedom of our youth
and more freedom of our criminals,"
said Dr. Jordan last night when dis
cussing present tendencies of the
morals of modern youth.
"The attitude of the younger gener
ation of today is much different from
the attitude held in my day. Boys used
to be more docile; they were just as
bad, but they kept it more under
cover. Nor are short dresses and
bobbed hair- the cause of what is bad
in the world. Speaking of dresses, the
women in the days when I was young
used to be known as transit hay
stacks."
Dr. Jordan does not believe that the
indulgences of the day are to be taken
as questions of right and wrong.
Young people want to see if things
are fundamental rather than just con
ventional. They desire to look criti
cally at all of the institutions, not
excepting marriage, and adopt or re
ject on a basis of reason —rather than
tradition.
"The only difficulty with this in
vestigating," he said, "lies in the fact
that our youth are not old enough to
fully investigate before they are forced
to decide. The range of everything is
far bigger now than it was a few days
ago, making necessary more decisions
on a great variety of things; the prob
lems of life are getting harder, and
getting harder earlier."
"I do not know if the boys of today
are drinking more than the boys in
the days before prohibition. But I do
believe that it is true that the boy or
girl on the fence gets pushed over
more easily now than before."
