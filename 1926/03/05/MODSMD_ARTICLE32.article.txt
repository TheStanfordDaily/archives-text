# PACIFIC OIL MEN DONATE CORE FROM DEEPEST OIL WELL
## Los Angeles Basin Borings Given to University For Research 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
The core of Baldwin well No. 35,
the deepest well ever completely
cored, along with the core of the
Baldwin prospect well No. 3, has re
cently been donated to Stanford
through the courtesy of Joseph Jen
son, geologist of the Pacific Oil Com
pany, and Paul Shoup, trustee of the
University, former president of the
Pacific Oil Company and now vice
president of the Southern Pacific Rail
ways.
The cores, which are from wells
5000 i and 2000 feet deep, respectively,
were removed from the wells in small
sections and shipped in boxes to the
University. The larger core is a com
plete sample of the oil-bearing forma
tions of the Los Angeles Basin oil
country. The gift will be used by the
geology and paleontology departments
in their work.
The material will be used by the
department in study of the foramini-i
fera, microscopic organisms used to
determine the age of the various
strata, and also for the study of the
diatomaceous shales, which are prob
ably the source of the oil.
The core is composed of fifty-five
inch sections of three and four inches
in diameter; the total weighs between
ihirty-flve and forty tons. In ordinary
boring, the core is not kept intact,
but invention of a core-barrel has en
abled drillers to draw out the complete
core intact.
The perfection of this special appa
ratus is the work of John E. Elliot,
'12, who was associate professor of
petroleum technoiolgy at Stanford
from 1921 until recently.
At present, the main difficulty en
countered has been the location of a
proper place, of storage. The cores,,
which have a total length of around j
7000 feet, are extremely bulky and I
heavy and must be stored in special i
rooms.
Cuts will be taken by the depart-1
ment from the cores for study in the |
geology and paleontology classes, so |
that there will remain material fori
future study. Arrangements have been j
conducted by C. F. Tolman, professor j
of economic geology.
