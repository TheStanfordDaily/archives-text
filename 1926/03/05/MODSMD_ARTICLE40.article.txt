# PHOTOGRAPHS OF 52 MOUNTAIN PICTURES IN GALLERY DISPLAY
## New Numbers Add Variety to Presentation Scheduled For Friday 
### 
A collection of fifty-two pictures of
famous mountains of the world is now
on display at the Art Gallery. The
exhibit is part of the Frederick H.
Morley collection belonging to the
Sierra Club. The pictures were made
by a celebrated photographer of moun
tains, Vittoria Sella, while he was with
the Duke of Abrussi on his trip
through Switzerland.
Besides many views of mountains in
the Alps, there are pictures of the
Himalayas, the Sierras, and mountains
in Alaska. The famous view of Jung
frau, from Interlaken, is shown. The
lighting effects are excellent, and the
shadows are portrayed in several sun
set scenes. Beautiful views of cloud
tipped beaks form a part of the col
lection. Of this group, the picture of
Mt. Blanc is perhaps the most noted.
The photographer climbed to great
heights for some of his pictures, ob
taining beautiful results for his efforts.
One scene looks down into a deep
crevasse of ice, while another over
looks the peaks of several mountains.
Pictures of lakes jilso have their place
in the collection.
