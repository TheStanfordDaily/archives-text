## 
### 
Gordon A. Davis, director of dra
matics, will leave tomorrow for the
East where he plans to visit a num
ber of the larger universities and
watch their amateur dramatic produc
tions. In Chicago he will be the guest
of Professor Alexander Dean, Direc
tor of Northwestern University. In
addition to going over the dramatic
situation there, he will have an oppor
tunity to see the work of the North
Shore Theatre Guild, one of the most
prominent in American dramatic
guilds.
Davis plans a short visit in Mon
treal, McGill, and New York. He will
witness plays, with an eye for scripts
that will be suitable for production on
the Stanford stage, and methods of
dramatic production and stage direc
tion. In past years Davis has been
successful in securing plays to pro
duce for the first time on this coast,
such as "Hell Bent Fer Heaven," "Ice
Bound," and "In the Next Room."
On his return he will stop at Har
vard for the spring production of the
Harvard Dramatic Club. At Yale he
will be the guest of Professor George
Baker. He will study the new school

by the Harkness endowment recently.
He will return by way of Los An
geles, where he will study the Pasa
dena Community House. He will take
East with him scrapbooks and pic
tures of recent Stanford dramatic pro

created in dramatic circles by the new
organization of dramatics here on the
campus.
The corps of assistant directors is
in particular a unique feature. Davis
plans to return the middle of the
spring quarter so as to direct the
Senior Farce.
