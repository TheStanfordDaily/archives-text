# Olympic Club To Face Varsity Men In Bouts Tonight
## 
### Calvin Behle 
Led by Captain Myron Schall, the
Stanford seven will meet the Olympic
Club boxers at 8 o'clock tonight in the
pavilion. Coach Jake Irwin has an
nounced that the same Cardinal men
who last Friday trimmed the Davis
Farm boxers, winning five of the
seven scheduled bouts, will fight this
evening.
Schall, who will meet Jack Downey
of the Winged "O" men in the middle
weight bout of the program, has twice
knocked out his opponent in previous
bouts this season. Although little is
known of the Olympic Club men,
Downey will have to show much more
ability than is evinced by the average
college middleweight in order to give
the tall Stanford captain more than
a light workout.
Harry Stevenson, who surprised the
some six hundred fans last Friday by
decisioning Miller, the Davis captain
who had knocked out the Stanford
welterweight, will be closely watched
tonight. Stevenson, who was a find of
the novice tournament, has shown
steady improvement and promises to
fill the hole left by the graduation of
Vincent Martin.
Another Stanford boxer who will bear
watching is Ross, Irwin's new light
weight. Although defeated by Gomez
of the Aggies, Ross put up a heady
fight and seems the logical Cardinal
representative for this division. George
Coates will be the Olympic Club entry
for lightweight honors.
Norm Fain will meet Charles Casey
of the Clubmen in the light-heavy
weight class, with Collins, bantam
weight, meeting Stanley Walkerdine
of the Winged "O" boxers.
Jim Arthur, Stanford, and Reg Mil
ler will fight in the heavyweight class,
and Carlos Miron, Cardinal feather
weight, will meet Tom Huddleson of
the Clubmen.
