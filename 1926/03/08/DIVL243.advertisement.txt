Do Men "Tog Up"
for Easter?
Of course they do, although many men do not admit it,
they consider it feminine, and yet Eastertime is really
Springtime, and it s a sign of outhfulness to blossom
out in New Attire.
Isn't it consistent, then, to suggest New Easter Foot
wear —New Shoes that will add the Final louch of
Artistry to your Spring Outfit?
Such makers as Hanan, Thompson, Heywood, Slater,
Conrad, and others known for their Excellent Quality
and Superior Craftsmanship, are represented in our
Easter Display.
It's worth your time to look them over.
Above is a line illustration of an oxford made by John
Winter of Carnoustie, Scotland. Made of Golden Scotch
Grain and a "Canny" value at $10.
