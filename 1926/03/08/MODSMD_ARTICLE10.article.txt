# CARD BOXERS SLAP 'EM HARD TO WIN BLOODY BATTLES
## Stanford Defeats Olympic Club by Hard Hits in Busting Bouts 
### 
.
Taking four of the sewn bouts after
subduing tierce opposition, the Stan
ford boxers trimmed the Olympic Club
fighters in the pavilion competition
! held Friday evening. All the bouts
i were fast and chiefly notable for the
jaggressive fighting displayed by the
boxers who traded punches with seem
ing delight.
The bouts started off in impressive
style, when Collins and Stanley Walk
; erdine, bantamwieghts, battled three
rounds to a draw. The pair went at
j it fast and furious in the extra round,
1 but the repeated blows to Walkerdine's
jhead gave Collins a well-earned deci
sion. In the second padded glove en
counter, Coach Jake Irwin's men con
tinued their good work when the ag
gressive hitting of Carlos Miron gave
Stanford the fight. Miron, who fought
Gomez, Aggie intercollegiate feather
weight champion, to practically a draw
! last Friday, won as lie pleased. Hud
dleson offered some effective resist
ance in the first round but the inces
sant pounding of Miron proved too
much for him and he wont down for a
I count,of three in the second round,
j Huddleson arose groggy and after a
few moments Miron was given the
j bout on a technical knockout.
Rons, Stanford lightweight, and
Coates of the Clubmrn started into
their encounter without attempting to
feel each other out. The going proved
fairly even in the first round but in
the second one Coates got going and
forced Ross to the ropes, and from
! then on Coates maintained his advan
' lage. Anderson, Olympic Club welter
weight, won decisively over Steven
son in the fourth ring bout of the
evening. He took the lead early in the
initial round and never relinquished
it, winning all three rounds.
Captain Schall, Card middleweight,
increased his string of technical
knockouts to three in the fifth battle
at the expense of Downey. The short
j and st»>cky Downey stood off Schall's
attacks well ih the first round and
earned a draw for that session, but
in the second round it was a different
! story. Schall quickly took command of
( tlie situation and drove Downey around
i the ring. He finally staggered him and
quickly scored a knock-down for the
I count of nine, and the referee ended
S the fight a moment later by raising
Schall's hand.
! After two draw rounds the superior
aggressiveness of Fain, Cardinal light
| heavyweight, gave him a close deci
sion over Casey of the Clubmen. Casey
seemed willing for Fain to take the
offensive and to lay his chances on
: counter blows but these were not tell
ing enough to gain the decision. The 1
prize bout of the evening came in the
final one, the heavyweight struggle, j
Jim Arthur of Stanford was? matched
against Miller of the Olympic Club.
In the first round neither could gain I
a decisive edge as neither could main
tain a spurt for long, but in the sec
ond round Arthur tired under the
pounding and Miller forced him to
the ropes where he shot blow after
blow at Arthur's face to gain a sub
stantial lead. The third session was
the exact reverse of the second and
Arthur proceeded to even the count
wiyi some aggressiveness of his own.
The fourth round, made necessary by
a draw decision, was an offensive bat- j
tie with the principals swapping
punches. The referee gave Miller an
unpopular decision as many thought
Arthur deserved at least a draw.
a finished manner and many profes
sionals would be proud to ■equal. The
settings for each act represented a
climax in campus productions and a
mark for all future shows to strive to
attain to.
