# MULTITUDE GASPS AS U.C. ACROBATS DOWN CARDS
## 
### 
California's aggregation of acrobatic
artists, second to none other than that
of the renowned Harnum, took three
out of five of the death-defying trapeze
stunts in a very speedy gym tourna
ment last Friday night. Cheer after
cheer rang out from the thronging
multitude, gathered to view the
breath-taking contest, as each man
took his position, posed, and executed
his difficult feat. At the end of the
battle California had amassed Home
thirty-eight and a half points as
against Stanford's nineteen and a half,
and the thirty spectators filed quietly
out the door.
Samniego of California and Captain
Ted Smith of Stanford were high
point men of the meet. Smith took
two firsts and seconds.
