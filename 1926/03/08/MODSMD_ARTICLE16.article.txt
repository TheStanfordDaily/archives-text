# JUNIORS GRAB SECOND PLACE SOPHOMORES EAT 1929'S DEIST
## Holdovers Stage "Eggsfried"; Miller, West Negotiate Oval in Fast Time 
### 
After being permitted to pay twenty
five cents for the privilege of advertis
ing the Quadrangle Club by writing
about the Irish Marathon and "Eggs
fried," the Holdover Show, the gates
of the arena were opened and the
Freshman Reporter strolled into Mr.
Robert Lyman Templeton's Track at
exactly 1:21 and one-half, post meri
dian, Stanford time, last Saturday
afternoon, March the sixth, in the
year P.A. 1471.
Before we forget about it, we must
remember to state that the Seniors
won the Marathon in 21 minutes, 58
"find 2-5 seconds, with the Juniors sec
ond, the Greatest Class on Earth third,
and the Sophomores eating dust. The
Seniors should have been disqualified
because Bill Richardson ran twice.
This is quite a record. Next year Rich
ardson and Mike Ely are to enter
themselves as the Holdover team. Ely
will run the first lap and Richardson
will have the other twenty-three left
in which to overcome the handicap
thus imposed upon him.
Preceding the Marathon came the
Holdover Show, "Eggsfried." Ted C'ri
ley and Bill Hunkins are charged
with the perpetration of this dramati
cal, grammatical crime. Following is
the cast-of characatures: A1 Cass as
p]ggsfried, Dave Mannoccir as Bun
Hilda, Jake Irwin as Hagen Stymie,
Sum W'-ij'.ol as Walter Chryst.als, Bob
Lewis as Skriemhilde, Ted Shipkey as
Sunva Gunther, A1 Roberts as R.S.V.P.,
John C. Duniway as Messenger, Fred
Swan as javelin carrier, and a Horse,
impersonated by No. 6G, R.O.T.C.
A1 Cass was proclaimed as "the man
who passed the Intelligence Test,"
which is ample proof that psychology
is all wrong and Barnum was right.
The relay resolved itself into a
struggle for last place, an honor which
the Sophomores refused to permit the
Freshmen to hold. The pluck and grit
of the Greatest Class on Earth was
!score was in favor of the Stanford
water boys 43 to 25.

men, were fed by the Stanford Alumni.

After being permitted to pay twenty
five cents for the privilege of advertis
ing the Quadrangle Club by writing
about the Irish Marathon and "Eggs
fried," the Holdover Show, the gates
of the arena were opened and the
Freshman Reporter strolled into Mr.
Robert Lyman Templeton's Track at
exactly 1:21 and one-half, post meri
dian, Stanford time, last Saturday
afternoon, March the sixth, in the
year P.A. 1471.
Before we forget about it, we must
remember to state that the Seniors
won the Marathon in 21 minutes, 58
"find 2-5 seconds, with the Juniors sec
ond, the Greatest Class on Earth third,
and the Sophomores eating dust. The
Seniors should have been disqualified
because Bill Richardson ran twice.
This is quite a record. Next year Rich
ardson and Mike Ely are to enter
themselves as the Holdover team. Ely
will run the first lap and Richardson
will have the other twenty-three left
in which to overcome the handicap
thus imposed upon him.
Preceding the Marathon came the
Holdover Show, "Eggsfried." Ted C'ri
ley and Bill Hunkins are charged
with the perpetration of this dramati
cal, grammatical crime. Following is
the cast-of characatures: A1 Cass as
p]ggsfried, Dave Mannoccir as Bun
Hilda, Jake Irwin as Hagen Stymie,
Sum W'-ij'.ol as Walter Chryst.als, Bob
Lewis as Skriemhilde, Ted Shipkey as
Sunva Gunther, A1 Roberts as R.S.V.P.,
John C. Duniway as Messenger, Fred
Swan as javelin carrier, and a Horse,
impersonated by No. 6G, R.O.T.C.
A1 Cass was proclaimed as "the man
who passed the Intelligence Test,"
which is ample proof that psychology
is all wrong and Barnum was right.
The relay resolved itself into a
struggle for last place, an honor which
the Sophomores refused to permit the
Freshmen to hold. The pluck and grit
of the Greatest Class on Earth was

thus imposed upon him.
Preceding the Marathon came the
Holdover Show, "Eggsfried." Ted C'ri
ley and Bill Hunkins are charged
with the perpetration of this dramati
cal, grammatical crime. Following is
the cast-of characatures: A1 Cass as
p]ggsfried, Dave Mannoccir as Bun
Hilda, Jake Irwin as Hagen Stymie,
Sum W'-ij'.ol as Walter Chryst.als, Bob
Lewis as Skriemhilde, Ted Shipkey as
Sunva Gunther, A1 Roberts as R.S.V.P.,
John C. Duniway as Messenger, Fred
Swan as javelin carrier, and a Horse,
impersonated by No. 6G, R.O.T.C.
A1 Cass was proclaimed as "the man
who passed the Intelligence Test,"
which is ample proof that psychology
is all wrong and Barnum was right.
The relay resolved itself into a
struggle for last place, an honor which
the Sophomores refused to permit the
Freshmen to hold. The pluck and grit
of the Greatest Class on Earth was
!score was in favor of the Stanford
water boys 43 to 25.
After the meet had terminated the
| two teams, the varsity and the fresh
men, were fed by the Stanford Alumni.
