# Super Journalism
## 
### 
No, sweet reader, not Soupy Journalism, but just what the headline |
says. That, and that alone, adequately characterizes what you see before!
vour sleepy eye.
We absolutely guarantee this FRESHMAN EDITION of the Daily ',
Palo Alto to be the loudest, horn-tootingest concoction of publicity ever
smeared at the worthy feet of any class, club, creed, or caste in the history j
of this institution.
But, after all, doesn't it require Super Journalism to amply cry out!
from the rooftops in bellicose bellows even a few of the virtues of the
Class of 1929?
Tradition-smashing is right! What Freshman Class in the long and
glorious history of this University has dared to meet openly and publicly
and denounce the wearing of the Dink?
And Queening on the Quad! Long has it been a tradition sacred to
the upperclassmen. But nevermore will they alone enjoy this spicy
privilege, for the young but experienced members of the (. lass of" 1929
voted unanimouslv to Queen everywhere but in the classrooms. \\ hat s
more, they have carried but their threat, and freshmen may l>e seen on'
any sunny day strolling leisurely across the Quad with some fair lass,!
or chatting intimately beneath the palms of the inner circle.
And as a smashing climax to this list of achievements, the C lass ot '2 ( >,
boasts of the highest scholarship average and the best I.Q. of any |
entering class in Stanford annals.
So, mid the blown blare of tin trumpets, we arq, unveiling to the eyes j
of the impatient and breathless public our pea-green publication.
May it live up to the blatant precedent already established by the |
Class of 1929 !
TOMC )RROW AFTERNOON at 1 o'clock the regular staff members
of the Daily I'alo Alto will hold an autopsy to survey the ruins and gather j
up the remains of this their prized brain-child. Any of the Freshmen who j
aided or abetted or assisted in any way-in the perpetrating of the journal-j
istic atrocity of this beautiful edition printed in tw<> colors --count 'em.
green and white —who have the courage to return and face their betters( ?) ;
will be royally welcomed with one- and two-handed warming machines..!
