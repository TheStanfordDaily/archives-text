# P. A. 1471 HAS HOTTEST HOP ON RECORD
## 
### 
Under the auspices of the Freshman
Women, P.A. 1471 held the hottest
hop of the season last Saturday night.
Although the floor might have been
better the hundred odd couples there
overlooked this minor detail, and ad
mitted one and all that the dance was
! a wow.
The success of the affair was attri
buted to the fact that the floor wasn't
too crowded. With plenty of breath
. ing space and lots of floor room, every
body danced to his (and her) heart's
content.
The decorations were very, very
beautiful. They suggested the orient
in their riot of color. Reds, brilliant
hues, soft greens, suggested all the
lure of the Far East.
The Freshmen have created a new
precedent on the campus. Contrary to
all previous Stanford tradition both
the men and the women received pro
grams. They were by far the most
original and prettiest that Roble has
ever had. Wine-red in color they re-
I minded one somehow of spring.
Hal Todd's syncopators kept every
one writhing. It was impossible to re
sist his lure
