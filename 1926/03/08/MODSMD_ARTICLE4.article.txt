# FRESHMAN FARMERS TRAMPLE POLY HIGH 6-0 IN MESSY TILT
## Douglas Lewis, 1929 Pitcher, Donates Opponents Only Two Lone Bingles 
### 
The yearling baseball team easily
defeated the San Francisco Polytech;
nic High outfit 6 to 0 Saturday morn
ing on the freshman field, but dis
played one fault: they- should easily
have had an even dozen runs.
The, captive in the box —Doug Lewis
—pitched a whale of a game, allowing
only two lucky bingles and. striking
out eight men. Yes, Lewis is going
pretty fair these days. In the last
thirty-one innings and we don't know
how many more, Lewis has allowed
exactly no runs, and in one of those
games Lewis relieved a pitcher who
had just been soundly rapped for
three runs and gave his opponents in
the last four innings but one lone hit.
The babes opened the game with
one run when Hartley walked, Davis
hit a single, Hartley went to first.
Harder popped out, and Wilton scored
the runner with a hit.
Again in the third, the yearlings
scored. McKey, first man up, started
the trouble when he walked, and Har
der reached first on an error. Wilton
slashed out an outfield single. Wright
repeated the dose with another bingle
which scored Harder. McKey having
been erased from the picture at third.
McCandless crashed the ball to the
outfield, scoring both Wilton and
Wright. The scoring eruled here.
