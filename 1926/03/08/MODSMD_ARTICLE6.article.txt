# STANFORD SPLITS SUITE OF GAMES WITH U. SO. CALIF.
## Our Baseball Boys Show Up Their Rivals by Making More Runs 
### 
Stanford University split a two
game baseball series with the Univer
sity of Southern California when they
won the Saturday matinee to the tune
of 11 to 2 after dropping the Friday
encounter 3 to 1. The total number
of runs tallied favors the Red-Shirted
warriors, however, as they scored
more than twice as many counters as
their opponents were able to ring up.
Collins pitched a nice nine innings for
the first engagement of the week-end,
but lost. Count Sobieski turned in a
two-hit, two-run twirling special to
leave the Trojans high and dry and
ready for home.

Cold! Cold! He shivered, for he was
out out in the great open spaces
where men are monkeys and the wind
blows air. It was cold air, too, im
ported direct by way of the famed
Empyrean Overhead Express from the
frigid atmosphere of Menlo. The win
try blast blew between bis limbs as
he turned and walked slowly to the
dugout.
Yes, he was out.. The wind had
turned the watery blood' of the umpire
to ice and that crystalline substance
bad solidified around his heart, mak
ing him more cold-hearted than usual.
The croo-el nni pi re had called him
out. (See appended illustration). He
was a mere Red runner in the Stan
ford-Southern California pill-tossing

contest that was played in the chill
atmosphere of last Friday afternoon.
He had failed to score as other Cardi
nals had also failed. The Trojans had
thundered the old battle-plug over the
home platter three times for runs,
while Stanford was unable to produce
more than one tally in the same time.

with U.S.C. for four scoreless innings,
and countered Southern Cal's run In
the first of the fifth with a marker in
their half of the same stanza, and
went on through another pointless
period. From then on the necking

stopped, as the Trojans got warm and
rang up a counter in the lucky seventh,
concluding the contest by tallying
their last one in the ninth. Hut the
contest was interesting, excepting for
the cold, and the outs, and U.S.C. win
ning, and the fact that no Freshmen
were eligible to compete. Better luck
next year!

the first game, played Friday after-:

Count Sobieski turned in a nice bit
of pitching, and was helped out great

Stewart pounded out three blows l'or
heavy hitting honors, and Nissen

did Sobieski, who was not content to

Stanford University split a two

more than twice as many counters as
their opponents were able to ring up.
Collins pitched a nice nine innings for

two-hit, two-run twirling special to
leave the Trojans high and dry and
ready for home.

out out in the great open spaces
where men are monkeys and the wind
blows air. It was cold air, too, im
ported direct by way of the famed

frigid atmosphere of Menlo. The win
try blast blew between bis limbs as
he turned and walked slowly to the
dugout.
Yes, he was out.. The wind had
turned the watery blood' of the umpire
to ice and that crystalline substance
bad solidified around his heart, mak
ing him more cold-hearted than usual.
The croo-el nni pi re had called him
out. (See appended illustration). He
was a mere Red runner in the Stan
ford-Southern California pill-tossing

contest that was played in the chill
atmosphere of last Friday afternoon.
He had failed to score as other Cardi
nals had also failed. The Trojans had
thundered the old battle-plug over the
home platter three times for runs,
while Stanford was unable to produce
more than one tally in the same time.

was directly traced to the presence of
mushrooms on the'm-enu.
Stanford University split a two
game baseball series with the Univer
sity of Southern California when they
won the Saturday matinee to the tune
of 11 to 2 after dropping the Friday
encounter 3 to 1. The total number
of runs tallied favors the Red-Shirted
warriors, however, as they scored
more than twice as many counters as
their opponents were able to ring up.
Collins pitched a nice nine innings for
the first engagement of the week-end,
but lost. Count Sobieski turned in a
two-hit, two-run twirling special to
leave the Trojans high and dry and
ready for home.
Freshmen Freeze
Cold! Cold! He shivered, for he was
out out in the great open spaces
where men are monkeys and the wind
blows air. It was cold air, too, im
ported direct by way of the famed
Empyrean Overhead Express from the
frigid atmosphere of Menlo. The win
try blast blew between bis limbs as
he turned and walked slowly to the
dugout.
Yes, he was out.. The wind had
turned the watery blood' of the umpire
to ice and that crystalline substance
bad solidified around his heart, mak
ing him more cold-hearted than usual.
The croo-el nni pi re had called him
out. (See appended illustration). He
was a mere Red runner in the Stan
ford-Southern California pill-tossing

contest that was played in the chill
atmosphere of last Friday afternoon.
He had failed to score as other Cardi
nals had also failed. The Trojans had
thundered the old battle-plug over the
home platter three times for runs,
while Stanford was unable to produce
more than one tally in the same time.

U.S.C. 3, Stanford 1.
The game itself was interesting. It
was viewed by nearly five hundred
roughs. Stanford played neck-and-neck
ter. Stanford played neck-and-neck
with U.S.C. for four scoreless innings,
and countered Southern Cal's run In
the first of the fifth with a marker in
their half of the same stanza, and
went on through another pointless
period. From then on the necking

stopped, as the Trojans got warm and
rang up a counter in the lucky seventh,
concluding the contest by tallying
their last one in the ninth. Hut the
contest was interesting, excepting for
the cold, and the outs, and U.S.C. win
ning, and the fact that no Freshmen
were eligible to compete. Better luck
next year!
The Stanford line-up was: Weaver,

the University of Southern Cal was dug ;
out of the debris caused by the crash '
of Stanford bats against the slants of
Salilberg, the Trojan twirler, and sent
home-ward last Saturday night to a
fair and warmer climate on the short I
end of an 11 to 2 scoi*e. This evened
the series, as the Cardinals had lost
the first game, played Friday after-:
noon, 3 to 1.
Count Sobieski turned in a nice bit
of pitching, and was helped out great
ly by his teammates' timely hitting.
Stewart pounded out three blows l'or
heavy hitting honors, and Nissen
stepped to the platter with three men j
on and socked the pill for a three- j
bagger. Johnson hit safely twice, as
did Sobieski, who was not content to
merely hurl.
The line-up was the same as Friday, {
excepting that Sobieski and Salilberg :
pitched. Coleman batted for Sahlberg!
in the ninth.
