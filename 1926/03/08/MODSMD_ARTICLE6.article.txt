# STANFORD SPLITS SUITE OF GAMES WITH U. SO. CALIF.
## Our Baseball Boys Show Up Their Rivals by Making More Runs 
### 
Stanford University split a two
game baseball series with the Univer
sity of Southern California when they
won the Saturday matinee to the tune
of 11 to 2 after dropping the Friday
encounter 3 to 1. The total number
of runs tallied favors the Red-Shirted
warriors, however, as they scored
more than twice as many counters as
their opponents were able to ring up.
Collins pitched a nice nine innings for
the first engagement of the week-end,
but lost. Count Sobieski turned in a
two-hit, two-run twirling special to
leave the Trojans high and dry and
ready for home.

Cold! Cold! He shivered, for he was
out out in the great open spaces
where men are monkeys and the wind
blows air. It was cold air, too, im
ported direct by way of the famed
Empyrean Overhead Express from the
frigid atmosphere of Menlo. The win
try blast blew between bis limbs as
he turned and walked slowly to the
dugout.
Yes, he was out.. The wind had
turned the watery blood' of the umpire
to ice and that crystalline substance
bad solidified around his heart, mak
ing him more cold-hearted than usual.
The croo-el nni pi re had called him
out. (See appended illustration). He
was a mere Red runner in the Stan
ford-Southern California pill-tossing

contest that was played in the chill
atmosphere of last Friday afternoon.
He had failed to score as other Cardi
nals had also failed. The Trojans had
thundered the old battle-plug over the
home platter three times for runs,
while Stanford was unable to produce
more than one tally in the same time.
