# FRESHMEN ACCLAIM GREEN GODDESS HOTTEST STUFF YET
## Best Production of Season Is Presented with Aid of Freshman Talent 
### 
-! Today's issue is printed on green
; type in honor of the Freshman Class
f | and "The Green Goddess." It is no
i | more than fitting that the date of pub
f i lication of the paper in honor of the
r Greatest Class on Earth should coin
i cide so well with the time for the
1 praising of the Best Show of the Sea
i i son. For the production by Gordon
. Davis of William Archer's play in the
r jOpery House last Friday night brought
, to a stupendous climax the most suc
i cessful dramatic season ever seen at
) this (InsertnameofStanford) Univer
i sity. It was wonderful, exciting, in
tense, thrilling, and a great deal of
the success is due to the presence on
f this campus of the Greatest Class on
3; Earth. Hut much credit must he given
1 to Gordon Davis and Leslie Kiler,
-1 while Lloyd Nolan may step forward
1 and trim the laurel tree for sufficient
; leaves to fully show how great was
- the performance that he turned in.

The other members
of the cast, all of
whom also did splen
did work, will be
praised later, but we
must stop here to
say that Nolan "tykes
the cyke." He is the
possessor! «+f a won
derful stage pres
ence, of excellent
diction, and had a
complete mastery
of every situation
in which he was
among those present.

In addition to this he was "very much
married" and had fifteen sons while
no one ever had time to count his
daughters.
Before we continue this exposition
of dramatic criticism, we must hesi
tate long enough to state that, con
trary to the usual policy of condemna
tion and fault-finding so strictly ad
hered to by the older and wiser (?)
heads of the D.P.A. staff, we fully
intend to praise this production to
the best of our abilities and the limit
of our adjectives. Those who did not


'•The Picture"
attend the play will find a composite
picture of themselves in the near vi
cinity of this story, as conceived and
drawn by our highly paid and recently
rejuvenated Art(?) Department.
Helen Lewis Does Well
Helen Lewis, as Mrs.
shared honors and applause with Lloyd
Nolan.- Her action was splendid, her
love for her children, her fear of the
Raja, her final admission of a mutual
feeling of more than admiration for
Dr. Traherne, were all done so well
that nothing further was required
from her or even thought of.
Jack Wiggin's performance as Wat
kins. the perfect butler, was very con
vincingly done and more than inter
esting. He acted the part in a very
natural manner and, while at times
one could not admire the action that
he was called upon to present, never
theless one had to admire the way in
which Wiggin put over this difficult
character.
Garth Winslow, who took the part
of Major Crespin, was slightly mis
cast. He did his drinking with almost
enough gusto to cinvince the audience
that it was the real stuff. His actions
were a trifle awkward at times, but
his performance was fair when one
considers that he labored under diffi
culties.
Sam Hays was a trifle weak for the
part that he had to portray, but this
merely showed that he is still a Fresh
man, and he did well for his
first performance before a Stanford
audience. He is like all of us Fresh
enough gusto to convince the audience
ful possibilities.
Taylor High Priest
Harold Taylor gave a very finished
performance as the High Priest of the
kingdom of Rukh who desired to
sacrifice the white intruders to the
Green Goddess. His make-up and cos
tuming was very effective. He is a
Freshman, which is also to his credit.
To the creators of atmosphere in
the shape of the soldiers, blacks, vil
lagers, and priests who appeared on
the stage, the make-up men, the elec
tricians, the costume designers, and
scenery constructors, most of whose
work was back-stage, goes the warm
commendation of an audience who
saw something new and beautiful in
the line of stage settings and who felt
and lived in an atmosphere of mysti
cism and religious fanaticism. The
costumes and make-up were done in
