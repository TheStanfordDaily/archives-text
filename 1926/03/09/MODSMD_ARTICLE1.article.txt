# STANFORD DEBATERS DEFEAT MARQUETTE BY AUDIENCE VOTE
## EASTERNERS LOSE 46-25 'We Envy Our Grandchildren' Aver Charles Scott and Philip Cavalero 
### 
Declaring that they envied, their
grandchildren, the Stanford debaters
defeated Marquette University last
night in an audience decision contest
by a count of 46 to 25 Philip Cavalero
and Charles C. Scott, representing
Stanford, upheld the negative of the
question, "Resolved, That this house
pities its grandchildren."
Herbert Steffes, first speaker of the
evening, pointed out that there is
nothing more fundamental than man's
attitude toward life and laid down two
standards, or norms, by which the
question could be decided. He de
plored the modern disregard of law
and license, terming it subjectivity,
the supremacy of individual philo
sophy.
Grandchildren Ffcobbed
"We are taking from our grandchil
dren the heritage which they should
receive from our forefathers," de
clared Steffes. The Marquette speaker
showed that our modern cheap maga
zines, authors, scientists, and leaders
are developing this individualism.
Cavalero, first Stanford debater, said
that the far greater knowledge avail
able in the future will prevent our
grandchildren from making the mis
takes of our generation. "The whole
sale emancipation of women has
brought to civilization new ethical and
moral problems which can be solved
within a short span of years," Cava
lero declared.
"The new international spirit that
is strong in the youth of today will be
even stronger in our grandchildren
and ultimately result in the outlawing
of war entirely. Although we have
made great headway in the invention
of labor saving devices, our grandchil
dren will raise the standard of living
for the lower classes."
Man Is Slave
William P. Leonard, of Marquette,
in his arguments said: "The predomi
nance of bad tendencies today which
we are going to leave to our grand
children, will be a legacy of sorrow.
Man is making himself a slave of
science and, while setting it up as a
god, is becoming utterly dependent
upon scientific applications.
"The next generation will have a
moral, mental, and physical stomach
ache from indulging in the standards
of today.
"We are ignoring the ancient teach
ers of thought and the basic principles
behind life and are working for our
own individual development without
self-sacrifice. The home life of today
exists only for self-satisfaction and
.self-development."
