# OGDEN RETAINS NO. 4 POSITION BY VICTORY OVER GOMER THOMAS
## 
### 
Lionel Ogden, varsity tennis cap
tain, maintained his No. 4 ranking
position with a three-set victory over
Gomer Thomas, challenger, last Fri
day afternoon. The score was 3-6, 6-4,
6-2.
Thomas started the play with a
steady, accurate driving attack that
forced Ogden, who was having trouble
with his shots, into many errors. In
the second set Ogden settled down to
a steady pace, nosing Thomas out of
several closely contested games to
square the match. The last set was
more decisive. Ogden ran his oppon
ent to and fro with hard, well-placed
shots that completely nullified Thom
as' exceptional court-covering ability.
The revised ranking at the present
date follows: Alan Herrington, 1; Paul
Fairchild, 2; Ralph McElvenny, 3;
Lionel Ogden (captain), 4; Gomer
Thomas, 5; Frank Dunn, 6; Alan Mc-
Cray, 7
