## San Francisco Organization Will Give Founders' Day Program 
### 
The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra will play in the Memorial
Church at 8:15 o'clock tonight in ob
servance of Founders' Day Ninety
five men will play under the direction
of Alfred Hertz, famous conductor.' A
notable program has been arranged,
the music having been chosen espe
cially for the setting of the church.
Tickets have been distributed to the
[faculty and the students who have
applied for them. The symphony or
i chestra played for the Founders' Day
concert a year ago and also three
years ago.
The program will be as follows:
"Suite No. 6," by John Sebastian Bach,
arranged by Sir Henry Wood of Lon
don, and the suite, the "Good Friday
Spell," from "Parsifal," Wagner's last
and most mystical opera. "Parsifal" is
religious in subject and mood, being
the story of the guarding of the Holy
Grail. In the "Good Friday Spell" is
painted the tone picture of the peace
and heavenly blessing which seems to
descend upon the land from above on
the Good Friday. It has strange, rich
harmonies, giving an effect altogether
other-worldly.
Hertz Noted Conductor
Hertz is probably the most noted
Wagnerian conductor in America. He
conducted all German operas for the
Metropolitan Opera Company of New
York for many years. The "Good Fri
day Spell" has been made into a rec
ord by the San Francisco Orchestra
under his direction.
The greatest work on the program
and one of the greatest in all music !
literature is the Fifth Symphony by
Bethoven, which will make up the j
second part of the program. This work j
is one of the simplest in material and
yet one of the most powerful and sin
cere in a group of separate and con
trasting selections gathered together
in one.
Mischel Penha, the San Francisco
Orchestra's new cello soloist, will be
heard in solo work for the first time
at Stanford when he plays "Elegie,"
by Faure, with an orchestral accom
paniment. Penha is ranked as one of
the finest cellists on the coast.
The famous melody, "Prize Song,"
from Wagner's opera, "The Master
singers," will follow This is one of
the most noted airs in all the Wag
merian music dramas. It is the song
which in the opera the knight, Wal-1
tlier, wins the contest of song held by ;
the famous mastersingers guild of
Nuremberg and with it the hand of
his lady love.
The Memorial Church doors will
be open at 7 o'clock tonight, although |

The program will be as follows:
"Suite No. 6," by John Sebastian Bach,
arranged by Sir Henry Wood of Lon
don, and the suite, the "Good Friday
Spell," from "Parsifal," Wagner's last
and most mystical opera. "Parsifal" is
religious in subject and mood, being
the story of the guarding of the Holy
Grail. In the "Good Friday Spell" is
painted the tone picture of the peace
and heavenly blessing which seems to
descend upon the land from above on
the Good Friday. It has strange, rich
harmonies, giving an effect altogether
other-worldly.
