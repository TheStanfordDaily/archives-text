# AUTHORS COMPLETE WORK ON BOOK FOR 1927 JUNIOR OPERA
## 
### Frank Baker 
This year's Junior Opera will have
a more finished script than ever be
fore, according to the Opera Commit
tee, for Gordon Davis, dramatic coach,
and Lester Seib, a former student
here and now on the professional
stage, will take the completed book,
and, with this and the designs before
them, work out all the stage direc
tions in advance.
The book, written by Tommy Breeze,
'27, and Harry Boutell, '28, has been
completed, and will be sent to Davis
in New York. It will be back by the
opening of next quarter, so that work
can be started immediately after the
quarter begins.
This new plan of working out all the
plot actions and direction beforehand
has been extended to the music script.
John L. Wiggin, musical director of
the Junior Opera, announced today
that copies of the musical plot will be
mailed to all students desiring to com
pose music, for the junior class pro
duction. Wiggin can be reached at the
Alpha Tau Omega house. The direc
tors have provided a musical theme
which will carry through the whole
show and give it more of a contiuity
and unity than former operas have
had.
Charles Parks, director, and Leon
ard Schwartz, assistant, will not have
the detail of the direction to work out,
and will be able to work on the final
polishing of the characters and the
fine points of stage work. Thus, they
hope to put the show on in a much
more finished manner, and with better
