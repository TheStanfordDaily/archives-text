# Founders' Day
## 
### 
Today Stanford students and alumni are paying tribute to the founders
of the Universityâ€”the Stanfords who have made possible the education of
thousands. In attempting to mirror the feeling of appreciation and grati
tude that'is held for the founders by all who are connected with this insti
tution, the editor finds that his words are inadequate. Therefore, he has
asked, and been granted, permission to quote from Dr. Jordan's book,
"The Days of a Man."
Writing about Senator Stanford, Dr. Jordan has said, "Ilis concep
tion of the goodness of God, the measure of divine bounty, he put into
the form of an epigram, which, with his approval, we placed on the title
page of the University Registrar, 'The benevolence of the Creator toward
man on earth, the possibilities of humanity, are one and the same.'
Afterward, a sentence in one of my early addresses, 'A general education
is the birthright of every man and woman in America,' caught his atten
tion, and he asked to have that appear with the other. . . . As a natural
outcome of this attitude he provided in the endowment grant that the
University was to be free from all ecclesiastical ties, while at the same
time it should teach the basic principles of religion and morality.
"In the document he also provided that it should be kept free from
political as well as sectarian entanglements."
Of Mrs. Stanford, Dr. Jordan has written: "Following the death of
her husband, Mrs. Stanford remained in close seclusion for two weeks.
She had very important decisions to make. At the end of the fortnight
she called me to her home to say that the die was cast. She was going
ahead with Stanford University."
Mrs. Stanford's singleness of purpose, as a result of which this Uni
versity has grown and all of us have benefitted, was well expressed in a
letter that she wrote to Dr. Jordan in 1898:
"Every dollar that I can rightfully call mine is sacredly laid 011 the
altar of my love for the University, and this it ever shall be."
