International recognition has been bestowed upon another Stanford
athlete. Cranston Holman, ranking varsity tennis star, national junior
champion, and the eighth best senior player in the country, leaves soon for
a tour of the Orient at the invitation of the United States Lawn Tennis
Association.
It is indeed a signal honor to l)e placed upon the shoulders of Holman,
and indirectly his exploits across the Pacific will bring honor to Stanford.
Many will remember the Australian trip of the University tennis team
two summers ago and the resulting praise it brought to Stanford. While
Holman's absence will be keenly felt in the California meet, his presence
in Japan in the dual role of United States and Stanford representative
will be infinitely beneficial to the University.
