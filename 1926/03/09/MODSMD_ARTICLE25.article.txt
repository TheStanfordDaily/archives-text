# PEACE PLAN IS TOPIC OF COSMOPOLITAN CLUB
## 
### 
Although open discussion oÂ£ "World
Peace Plans" held by the Cosmopolitan
Club last night brought forward opin
ions that war is inevitable because it
is human nature to fight, the theory
was advanced that economic speciali
zation and interdependence, together
with the increased facilities for com
munication and transportation, will
make war impossible.
One of the discussion leaders, Wil
liam L. Gosslin, outlined the work of
the League of Nations and the World
Court as official means of bringing
about peace. In contrast to official
peace plans, Kazuo Kawai, another
discussion leader, suggested that non
official conferences of members of all
countries be held to create a better
understanding among peoples. The In
stitute of Pacific Relations is an exam
ple of the unofficial type of peace
proposal.
Tsong-Hsun Tsui discussed the dif
ficulties of all peace plans, speaking
especially of the need for emancipa
tion of oppressed nations.
Professor Yamato Ichihashi of (he
history department presided at the
meeting.
