THE RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO
By Letitia Lemon
Episode X
A CONFESSION
My ecstasy at receiving a proposal
from the man whom I supposed to be
the notorious Red Peril was destined
to be short-lived. 1 was indeed greatly
puzzled at two things. First, if this
man was the Red Peril why did he
not give me any reason to believe that
he was what his name implied? Fur
thermore, I marvelled as much at his
proposal as I did at my own accept
ance of it.
When I arose the following morning
I found Maurathea waiting for me.
"Did you have a good time last
night?" she questioned, looking at me
as if to read my thoughts.
"Why, yes," I said. I had hesitated
to tell anyone of the proposal because
I feared there might be a catch some
where (which I was indeed to find the
case).
"Weren't you frightened?" she
asked.
"Why, no," I replied. "I think the
Red Peril is wonderful."
Maurathea sank into a chair with
disgust and discouragement plainly
written on her face. "You're hopeless,"
she wailed, "after all our careful plan
ning."
"But I don't understand," I said, in
bewilderment
My roommate looked at me discon
solately. "I guess you're just too inno
cent to be afraid of anything. Well, I'll
tell you all about it. Rosamond and I
got the roommate of this boy we called
the Red Peril to persuade him to take
you out. How he ever did it, I don't
know. Anyway we thought it would
be a good joke to have you go out
with this simple-looking red-headed
freshman, and then make you believe
that he was the Red Peril, but I guess
he was too simple-looking."
I did not know whether to pull Mau
rathea's hair or to laugh at her; but
my curiosity was aroused, so I did
neither.
"Then who is this Red Peril?" I
asked.
"I don't know," said Maurathea.
"The boys always seem to get a big
kick out of any questions, no matter
how sensible, that we may ask about
him, or her, or it. I don't think it
really exists."
I have no idea what kind fate re
strained me from telling Maurathea
of my engagement.
After lunch I was called downstairs.
In the lobby I found my fiance (or the
man I supposed to be my fiance) wait
ing for me. I saw at once by his ex
•>reesion that something was amiss.
He seemed scarcely able to return my
greeting.
"John," I asked in alarm, "what's
the matter?"
"I I must talk to you alone," he
stammered, staring at the floor
"Why of course you can." I replied.
We went into the parlor and sat down
on a launge. "Now what is it?" I asked.

He seemed unable to speak.
"My real name isn't John Smith,"
he finally managed to get out. "It's
Frank Bollsley."
I was rather astonished. "Why didn't
you tell me your real name before?"
1 asked.
He sat in silence for another min
ute. Then he seemed to pull himself
together suddenly.
"I'll tell you everything," he began.
"My roommate is very fond of your
friend Maurathea Providence. He told
me this morning that it was she who
asked him to persuade me to take you
out. I don't understand yet just why.
At any rate my roommate is the other
person whom you knew as John Smith.
He took you to a dance over here
once, and his real name is Thomas
Wellmor."
"Yes, I know all about that now," I
said "Maurathea told me this morn
ing. But what difference does that
make, after all?"
"Then she didn't tell you about "
He stopped.
"About what?"
"About the bet. She must not have
known."
"What bet?"
Frank Bollsley grew pale.
"Do you know why I followed you
and tried to make your acquaintance?
Do you know why I took you to the
cactus gardens? Do you know why I
finally proposed to you?" His face be
came flushed with sudden fury. "To
win a bet," he cried in a frenzy, "a
miserable damned bet. Tom Wellmor
bet me five hundred dollars that I
could nofkiss you the first time I took
you out." He byried his face in his
hands. "And I was a fool enough to
take him up."
"And that's the reason " I began.
But my humiliation was beyond en
durance. I burst into tears.
He rose to his feet slowly, deliber
ately. "Letitia," he said, "I'm sorry.
Please try to forgive me sometime"
Before I realized it he was gone—for
ever.
I do not know how long it was after
ward that I suddenly became con
scious of someone beside me.
"Well! Well!" said a male voice,
"this is a fine time to be crying."
Looking up I recognized through
my veil of tears a face that I had
known since childhood, a face that
carried me back to dear old Squaw
Lookout —Nevada.
