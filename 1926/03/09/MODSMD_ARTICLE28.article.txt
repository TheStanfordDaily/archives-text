# TOLSTOY WORK COPIES SECURED FOR LIBRARY
## 
### 
Exact copies of Tolstoy's original
manuscripts have been presented to
the Hoover War Library by one of
the executors of tlie writer's belong
ings, says a communication received
yesterday from a European agent of
the library. The papers have not yet
reached the library.
The manuscripts which are on
their way to this country were copied
from the original writings of Tolstoy,
as they were before the family and
the censor had gone through them.
They also include several works that
have never been published.
The dispatch says that this is the
richest Tolstoy collection outside of
Russia.
The papers will be put in order and
bound, and then will be made avail
able to American scholars.

"Euthenics," meaning "right living," j
is the term applied to a new depart-1
ment at Vassal* college. It corresponds '
closely to a home economics depart- |
ment.
