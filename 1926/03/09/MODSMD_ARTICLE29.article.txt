# INTERVIEWS, CLASS WORK KEEP YOST BUSY THROUGH DAY
## 
### 
Interviews, appointments, classes
and committees meetings are the chief
activities which help to round out the
daily routine of Mary Yost, Dean of
Women. Dean Yost arrives at her
office at 8:30 o'clock and spends half
an hour reading and answering her
mail. She teaches a class in English
composition at nine and after the
hour, is again at her desk, usually
beseiged by women who come in to
confer on student affairs, to petition
for leaves of absence, or sometimes
even to relate a good joke.
"Hardly a day goes by," Miss Yost
said, "but. some parent calls who
wants to ask about the admission of
her daughter, who is incidentally de
scribed as a true, unblemished jewel.
1 sometimes tell these mothers that
Stanford is not the place for angels,"
she added with a laugh.
Men, too, often seek Miss Yost's
office to inquire about admission of
their sisters or perhaps to get sug
gestions for ehaperones for social
affairs.
The Dean is almost as busy in the
â– evenings as during the day. Parties,
meetings and study consume all the
nights of the week but one, which
she saves for herself. Miss Yost de
scribes her work as "tremendously
interesting," and adds:
"One becomes physically tired, but
not emotionally fatigued, on account
of the variety of the task."
Membership in a number of ad
ministrative committees, among them
the Lower Division, Admission, and
Scholarship committees, requires a
great deal of Dean Yost's attention.
At registration time she has charge
of the arrangement of every lower
division woman's schedule, and all
women's applications for admission
are investigated by her. She is also
usually engaged in some survey for
President Wilbur of activities among
the women. Two have been completed
this quarter, with several more in
progress.
"You can see from this," Miss Yost
concluded, "that a dean is seldom idle.
1 consider a dean as a middleman be
tween the president, faculty and stu
dents, between the students them
selves, and between the students and
the outside world. Our whole function
is to eliminate as far as possible edu-j
cational waste, of whatever kind."
