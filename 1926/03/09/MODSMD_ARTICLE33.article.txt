# UNIQUE EXHIBITION OF WEAVING ARTS SHOWN IN GALLERY
## 
### 
A revival of the weaving arts of
Colonial Days is being shown at the
Art Gallery, in an exhibition of home
spun, home-dved, and home-woven tex
tiles made by women of the Cumber
land Mountains of Kentucky. The
work has been done under the direc
tion of Berea College, through its
Department of Fireside Industries.
Berea College has for some time
carried on the work of encouraging
native American Arts; at the same
time it has helped many women to
earn a livelihood. Among the art
pieces exhibited are counterpanes,
coverlets, rugs, table covers, pillow
covers, shawls, and mufflers.
The collection shows an interesting
survival of an old Saxon handicraft,
and it contains some patterns which
appear in the heirlooms of distin
guished families. The prevailing colors
are Colonial indigo blue and white,
though madder red and shades of
green and walnut brown are found.
Prices have been put on the .articles,
the sale of which pays for the educa
tion of many mountaineer girls of the
Kentucky section.

As a reward for beating the Har
vard football team Princeton fresh
men may attend movies on week
nights for the remainder of the school
year.
