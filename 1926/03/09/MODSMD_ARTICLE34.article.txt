# JOURNALISM WILL BE TAUGHT DURING SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
Summer quarter classes in journal
ism will be given for the first time
this year, according to R. E. Sellards,
director of the summer quarter work.
The courses will center around the
summer quarter publication of the
Daily Palo Alto, which will be turned
over by the Associated Student Body
to the division of journalism. The
paper will be put out by members of
the classes as a newspaper for the
campus community. The members of
the class in elementary practice will
meet daily as a class for instruction
in the principles of news writing and
newspaper making, and will be the
staff reporters to gather and write
the news. The members of the class
in advanced practice will constitute
the editorial staff of the paper. A
third course will be given for those
who intend to teach journalism in
high school.
Mr. Waldo Abbot has been appointed
to assist Professor Everett W. Smith
in the summer quarter work. Mr.
Abbot, who is one of the editors of
the Christian Science Monitor, is a
graduate of the department of jour
nalism at the University of Michigan,
and is a member of the faculty there
now.
