# COMPTROLLER ROTH GOES LION-HUNTING IN MILPITAS WOODS
## 
### 
The lion quivered in his lair
last week-end when "Dutch"
Roth, comptroller, went lion
hunting. The intrepid administra
tion head, accompanied by J.
Bruce, state lion-hunter, invaded
the wilds back of Milpitas in the
Mt. Hamilton range in quest of
the carnivorous feline. The hunt
was unsuccessful, for the fox
hounds failed to pick up the
scent.
Roth states, however, that the
country traversed was the wild
est imaginable, six eagles, four
coyotes, twenty deer, and innu
merable smaller game being ob
served. He declared his intention
of going after the wily cat again
in may, and says he will bring
back the pelt of his own lion next
time.
