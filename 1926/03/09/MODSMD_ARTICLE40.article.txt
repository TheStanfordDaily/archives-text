# GUERARD ENTHUSIASTIC FOR USE OF ESPERANTO RULES FOR UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE NUMBER SIXTEEN COMBINATIONS OF PREFIXES, SUFFIXES, ROOTS
## 
### Barbara Dewlaney 
"With only sixteen rules of gram- j i
mar to study compared wit* the pages j i
of such rules which the students of 1
other languages must master, the stu
dent of Esperanto may learn to read
that language in the same number of
hours as it takes months to master
any other language," declared Profes
sor Albert L. Guerard of the English
department.
Professor Guerard is an enthusiast
in the movement for the adoption of
Esperanto as a universal language and
taught a class in that language here
in the fall of 1911.
Esperanto, which has been in exist-'
ence for about thirty years, is a dis
tinct language with two fundamental
principles. The first principle is the
reduction of grammar to the minimum.
The rules of grammar are so few, six
teen in number, that they might easily
be printed on a postcard. Esperanto is
based on words that are international,
such as the word oculist, which is al
ready common to most languages.
Familiar Words Used
Large families of words can be
formed in Esperanto through the com
bination of prefixes and suffixes with
the roots of international origin. By
learning the prefixes, suffixes, and
roots one can composed his own words,
which is a pleasure in itself, according
to Professor Guerard.
Many roots are taken from Romance
languages because such roots have
been found common to a large num-
I ber of languages. Esperanto looks and
sounds like Italian and Spanish.
At present about one hundred month
ly papers and some books are printed
j in this international language. It has
been used in various international
gatherings for nearly twenty years.
There are millions who have glanced
at Esperanto, and at least a million
people are able to read it.
A reading knowledge of Esperanto
can be gained in a few hours although
writing and speaking mastery of the
language requires months of study.
Esperanto is easily mastered on ac
count of its perfect regularity. There
are no spelling or pronunciation diffi
culties, no accentuation irregularities,
no complicated tenses, or irregular j
verbs. Spelling is phonetic. The chief
requirement of the language is mas- j
tery of the fundamental words of the
vocabulary.
Interpreters Eliminated
"Increasing internationalism of civi
-1 lization makes an international lang
uage such as Esperanto advanta
geous," says Professor Guerard. "With
the use of Esperanto in international
meetings the cumbrous and risky
methods of translators is eliminated.
Translators can not be expected to
know everything and to be able to
translate rapidly without errors.
"There is a decided objection to the
adoption of one single language such
as English or French for international
purposes because this would reduce
the languages of other nations to an
inferior position and thus create an
unfriendly feeling. One characteristic
national language can not be forced
upon all the other nations without
breeding ill-will.
"To be in harmony with the spirit j
of internationalism which recognizes I
the equality of all, it is essential that
the selection of a universal language
be impartial. The adoption of Esper
anto exclusively for international pur
poses of commerce, administration,
and science would meet this diffi
culty."
Begun by Russian
The Esperanto movement was be- j
gun by a Russian Pole, Dr. L. Zamen- |
liof, who noticed that general mis- j
understanding existed in a little town ;
where there were many peoples speak- j
ing different dialects. Attributing
their dislike for each other to the lack
of understanding, Zamenliof wrote a
pamphlet urging the adoption of a ;
language common to all f them. He |
| signed his pamphlet La Doktoro Es-
I peranto, meaning "the Hopeful Doc
tor," and the name Esperanto has
been attached to the language since
that time.
Two set-backs in the progress of the
Esperanto movement have occurred ;
within the last twenty years, the first
one coming as a schism in 1907. Some
of the followers of the movement
wislied to introduce reforms, and the i
opposing faction wanted to keep the |
language without reform until it be- j
came more firmly established. The \
second interruption came during the ;
war when international life was j
broken up and people could not sup- i
port the movement.
"Although many other language
leaders are preparing for other forms
of international language, the present
tendency is toward harmony between
! other international language support
ers and the enthusiasts of Esperanto.
The League of Nations has reported
favorably on Esperanto, and some of

the world's greatest philologists such
as Otto Jespersen are actively inter
ested in Esperanto as an international
language," says Professor Guerard.

formed early last November, meets at
7:30 o'clock every Wednesday evening
in Room 307 of the Library. B. E.

a student of Esperanto for ten or fif
teen years and was one of the moving
spirits during the convention of the
Universal Esperanto Association held
in San Francisco in 1915.
The class, which numbers about
ten, has made satisfactory progress
and the members are able to converse
a little and read rather freely. If
others are interested in forming a
second class, a beginning class may
be formed. Anyone interested in join

class or communicate with one of the

Begun by Russian
The Esperanto movement was be- j
gun by a Russian Pole, Dr. L. Zamen- |
liof, who noticed that general mis- j
understanding existed in a little town ;
where there were many peoples speak- j
ing different dialects. Attributing
their dislike for each other to the lack
of understanding, Zamenliof wrote a
pamphlet urging the adoption of a ;
language common to all f them. He |
| signed his pamphlet La Doktoro Es-
I peranto, meaning "the Hopeful Doc
tor," and the name Esperanto has
been attached to the language since
that time.
Two set-backs in the progress of the
Esperanto movement have occurred ;
within the last twenty years, the first
one coming as a schism in 1907. Some
of the followers of the movement
wislied to introduce reforms, and the i
opposing faction wanted to keep the |
language without reform until it be- j
came more firmly established. The \
second interruption came during the ;
war when international life was j
broken up and people could not sup- i
port the movement.
"Although many other language
leaders are preparing for other forms
of international language, the present
tendency is toward harmony between
! other international language support
ers and the enthusiasts of Esperanto.
The League of Nations has reported
favorably on Esperanto, and some of

the world's greatest philologists such
as Otto Jespersen are actively inter
ested in Esperanto as an international
language," says Professor Guerard.

spirits during the convention of the

ten, has made satisfactory progress

"With only sixteen rules of gram- j i
mar to study compared wit* the pages j i
of such rules which the students of 1
other languages must master, the stu
dent of Esperanto may learn to read
that language in the same number of
hours as it takes months to master
any other language," declared Profes
sor Albert L. Guerard of the English
department.
Professor Guerard is an enthusiast
in the movement for the adoption of
Esperanto as a universal language and
taught a class in that language here
in the fall of 1911.
Esperanto, which has been in exist-'
ence for about thirty years, is a dis
tinct language with two fundamental
principles. The first principle is the
reduction of grammar to the minimum.
The rules of grammar are so few, six
teen in number, that they might easily
be printed on a postcard. Esperanto is
based on words that are international,
such as the word oculist, which is al
ready common to most languages.
Familiar Words Used
Large families of words can be
formed in Esperanto through the com
bination of prefixes and suffixes with
the roots of international origin. By
learning the prefixes, suffixes, and
roots one can composed his own words,
which is a pleasure in itself, according
to Professor Guerard.
Many roots are taken from Romance
languages because such roots have
been found common to a large num-
I ber of languages. Esperanto looks and
sounds like Italian and Spanish.
At present about one hundred month
ly papers and some books are printed
j in this international language. It has
been used in various international
gatherings for nearly twenty years.
There are millions who have glanced
at Esperanto, and at least a million
people are able to read it.
A reading knowledge of Esperanto
can be gained in a few hours although
writing and speaking mastery of the
language requires months of study.
Esperanto is easily mastered on ac
count of its perfect regularity. There
are no spelling or pronunciation diffi
culties, no accentuation irregularities,
no complicated tenses, or irregular j
verbs. Spelling is phonetic. The chief
requirement of the language is mas- j
tery of the fundamental words of the
vocabulary.

"Increasing internationalism of civi

methods of translators is eliminated.
Translators can not be expected to
know everything and to be able to
translate rapidly without errors.
"There is a decided objection to the
adoption of one single language such

the languages of other nations to an
inferior position and thus create an
unfriendly feeling. One characteristic

"With only sixteen rules of gram- j i
mar to study compared wit* the pages j i
of such rules which the students of 1
other languages must master, the stu
dent of Esperanto may learn to read
that language in the same number of
hours as it takes months to master
any other language," declared Profes
sor Albert L. Guerard of the English
department.
Professor Guerard is an enthusiast
in the movement for the adoption of
Esperanto as a universal language and
taught a class in that language here
in the fall of 1911.
Esperanto, which has been in exist-'
ence for about thirty years, is a dis
tinct language with two fundamental
principles. The first principle is the
reduction of grammar to the minimum.
The rules of grammar are so few, six
teen in number, that they might easily
be printed on a postcard. Esperanto is
based on words that are international,
such as the word oculist, which is al
ready common to most languages.
Familiar Words Used
Large families of words can be
formed in Esperanto through the com
bination of prefixes and suffixes with
the roots of international origin. By
learning the prefixes, suffixes, and
roots one can composed his own words,
which is a pleasure in itself, according
to Professor Guerard.
Many roots are taken from Romance
languages because such roots have
been found common to a large num-
I ber of languages. Esperanto looks and
sounds like Italian and Spanish.
At present about one hundred month
ly papers and some books are printed
j in this international language. It has
been used in various international
gatherings for nearly twenty years.
There are millions who have glanced
at Esperanto, and at least a million
people are able to read it.
A reading knowledge of Esperanto
can be gained in a few hours although
writing and speaking mastery of the
language requires months of study.
Esperanto is easily mastered on ac
count of its perfect regularity. There
are no spelling or pronunciation diffi
culties, no accentuation irregularities,
no complicated tenses, or irregular j
verbs. Spelling is phonetic. The chief
requirement of the language is mas- j
tery of the fundamental words of the
vocabulary.
Interpreters Eliminated
"Increasing internationalism of civi
-1 lization makes an international lang
uage such as Esperanto advanta
geous," says Professor Guerard. "With
the use of Esperanto in international
meetings the cumbrous and risky
methods of translators is eliminated.
Translators can not be expected to
know everything and to be able to
translate rapidly without errors.
"There is a decided objection to the
adoption of one single language such
as English or French for international
purposes because this would reduce
the languages of other nations to an
inferior position and thus create an
unfriendly feeling. One characteristic
national language can not be forced
upon all the other nations without
breeding ill-will.
"To be in harmony with the spirit j
of internationalism which recognizes I
the equality of all, it is essential that
the selection of a universal language
be impartial. The adoption of Esper
anto exclusively for international pur
poses of commerce, administration,
and science would meet this diffi
culty."
Begun by Russian
The Esperanto movement was be- j
gun by a Russian Pole, Dr. L. Zamen- |
liof, who noticed that general mis- j
understanding existed in a little town ;
where there were many peoples speak- j
ing different dialects. Attributing
their dislike for each other to the lack
of understanding, Zamenliof wrote a
pamphlet urging the adoption of a ;
language common to all f them. He |
| signed his pamphlet La Doktoro Es-
I peranto, meaning "the Hopeful Doc
tor," and the name Esperanto has
been attached to the language since
that time.
Two set-backs in the progress of the
Esperanto movement have occurred ;
within the last twenty years, the first
one coming as a schism in 1907. Some
of the followers of the movement
wislied to introduce reforms, and the i
opposing faction wanted to keep the |
language without reform until it be- j
came more firmly established. The \
second interruption came during the ;
war when international life was j
broken up and people could not sup- i
port the movement.
"Although many other language
leaders are preparing for other forms
of international language, the present
tendency is toward harmony between
! other international language support
ers and the enthusiasts of Esperanto.
The League of Nations has reported
favorably on Esperanto, and some of

the world's greatest philologists such
as Otto Jespersen are actively inter
ested in Esperanto as an international
language," says Professor Guerard.

This discussion is also included in his
recent book "Beyond Hatred," pub

A class in Esperanto, which was
formed early last November, meets at
7:30 o'clock every Wednesday evening
in Room 307 of the Library. B. E.
Myers of the Sequoia Union High
School of Redwood City is a volunteer
teacher of the class. Myers has been
a student of Esperanto for ten or fif
teen years and was one of the moving
spirits during the convention of the
Universal Esperanto Association held
in San Francisco in 1915.
The class, which numbers about
ten, has made satisfactory progress
and the members are able to converse
a little and read rather freely. If
others are interested in forming a
second class, a beginning class may
be formed. Anyone interested in join
ing an Erperanto class may visit the
class or communicate with one of the
