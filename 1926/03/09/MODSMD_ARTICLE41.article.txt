## 
### 
The freshman baseball nine will
meet the Palo Alto high school team
on the varsity diamond tomorrow aft
ernoon at 3:30 o'clock. According to
reports the babes should have a fairly
easy time of it, as the high school
batsmen have had little experience
thus far this season. A number of the
Palo Alto players are still on the
basketball squad, and until they are
out and until more games have been
played the team will hardly be able
to find its strength.
