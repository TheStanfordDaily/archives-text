scenery, partly a wealth of Indian legend and a
background of amazing history.
See the Pacific Northwest — land of beauty,
romance and the spirit of youth. See its mountains
"thrilling to the stars," its glowing canyons, misty
waterfalls, ranches, big orchards and the famous
Columbia River Highway.
