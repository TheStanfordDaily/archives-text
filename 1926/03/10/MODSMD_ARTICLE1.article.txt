# VARSITY NINE WILL PLAY OLYMPIC CLUB TOSSERS SATURDAY
## WINGED 'O' TEAM STRONG Gird Baseball Players Open Vacation Tour March 20 In Bakersfield 
### Herb Klein 
Harry Wolter's varsity baseballers
"will meet the strong Olympic Club
team next Saturday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock. A week from Saturday the
men will meet the Kern River Stand
ards in Bakersfield in the first contest
of their four-game vacation tour in
Southern California.
The Olympic Club has already de
feated California and Santa Clara on
the diamond. The Blue and Gold was
beaten 8 to 3 and the Broncs 6 to 4.
The Winged "O" team lost to St.
Mary's last week 4 to 1. The first
Stanford game with the Olympic Club
was called off because of rain, so this
will bo the first meeting of the Cards
and the clubmen.
Heckendorf With O.C.
Burt Larkins, manager of the club
team, has gotten together a classy
bunch of players. Lefty Heckendorf,
who won letters for baseball three
limes while at Stanford, plays third
base.
The probable batteries for the club
men are Wright and Harwood. Wright
is rated a clever pitcher with lots of
stuff on the ball. The lineup will be
as follows: Donovan, lb; Barry, 2b;
Heckendorf, 3b; R. Barry, ss; Teidel,
If; Bertram, cf; Samis, rf.
Wolter will start his regular lineup
which has proved itself in games so
far. He may start Collins on the
mound Saturday, or give Philippi an
other chance to show steadiness in
the box.
Open Tour at Bakersfield
Beginning with the Kern River
Standards game at Bakersfield, March
20, the squad will go on to Los Angeles
where it will meet Occidental on the
23d, University of California Southern
Branch on the 25th, and U.S.C. the
27th.
On the trip last year the Cards
played the same teams with the excep
tion of U.S.C. The Standards defeated
Stanford 7 to 6. The Branch lost the
first game 5 to 10 and the second 2
to 1. Occidental took both games of
its series, the first 6 to 5, the second
4 to 3.

With batting improving as it has
during the past two weeks and with
at least two consistent pitchers in
Count Sobieski and Steve Collins, the
team appears to have at least an even
break for victory in all their games.
Sobieski will probably pitch in the
third U.S.C. game. He managed to get
the number of all the Trojan sluggers
in the two-hit game he pitched Sat
urday.
