# Winged-O Meets Cardinal Track Team Saturday
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast Conference
meet will be held at Stanford on
May 15, instead of on the original
date of May 22, and the Cardinals
will meet the Los Angeles Athletic
Club track team here on Saturday,
March 27, according to an an
announcement made by Garduate
Manager Alfred Masters at 1:30
o'clock today. Charles Paddock,
world's champion sprinter, will
run for the club squad.

The change in the P.C.C. meet
was made in order that the Uni
versity of California might enter
its first team. The Bruins had
scheduled a meet in the East with
Princeton that would conflict with
the original date of the coast
meet.
Stanford's track team will open its
regular 1926 season against the Olym
pic Club at the old oval next Saturday
afternoon.
When the Olympic Club met Cali
fornia last Saturday they did not have ;
Johnny Myrra, javelin heaver; Dick
Macintosh, half-miler; and Bill Mc- j
Gurn, shotputter. Myrra holds the
world's record in the javelin throw.
These men that did not' oppose Cali
fornia will be on hand Saturday to
meet the Stanford men.
It seems a well-established fact that
the Cardinal track men will not score
as many points against the Olympic
Club as California did. With Macin
tosh running for'- the club in the t>SO ■
it is quite unlikely that Stanford will
make a clean sweep of this event as
California did. He should finish a close
second to Captain Bill Richardson. |
Johnny Myrra should take the jave- :
lin next Saturday. He did not even
compete against California, and this J
fact alone gave them opportunity to i
take fiers in this part of tlje program.
Bill McGurn in the shot will provide!
plenty of competition for Hoffman. He
did not meet California. Tiny Hart-:
ranft, Stanford's former captain, will
be 011 hand to show the youngsters a
few tricks. When the club met Cali
fornia Tiny had only had three days' j
workout and really didn't do himself j
justice. He should win easily Saturday
if he is in shape.
Stanford has never been strong in
the two-mile and the Winged "O" men
will undoubtedly score heavily in,
this event. Eames and Holganz of the i
club should give Collins and Nelson a
drubbing next Saturday. However, in
the high jump the clubmen seem
doomed for a shut-out. Three men on
the Stanford squad, Work, Muhs, and
West, have already done over six feet j
this year.
Ted Miller should lead the quarter
milers to the tape on Saturday. Al
though the Olympics succeeded in
shutting out California in the broad
jump they will have a hard time re
peating on Saturday. Meeks should
take a first with Mcßae, Dyer, and |
Laßue battling the club men for sec- j
ond and third.
