# AWARDS GRANTED SIX SPORT TEAMS BY EX COMMITTEE
## TROYER CAGE MANAGER Cardinal Chess Club Denied Funds for Tournament With California 
### 
Men in six sports, both minor and
i major, were granted awards by the
j Executive Committee last night in
i regular weekly session. Gifford L.
| Troyer was appointed basketball man
! ager for the season of 1926-27, and
â€¢five regular junior managers, with two
| alternates, were chosen to assist him.
Varsity swimming and water polo
had the greatest number of awards,
totalling twenty-two. Seventeen fresh
men received awards for swimming
and water polo, while thirteen fresh
man basketball players received Block
29 numerals. Block Circle "S" awards
go to six boxers, and German "S"
awards to six members of the gym
! team and six fencers.
A request made by the Cardinal
Chess Club for funds with which to
pay expenses incurred in matches
with California chess players was re
fused on the basis that it would form
a dangerous precedent to give raoney
to an institution of this kind. The com
mittee desired to commend the work
of the club this year, and was sorry
it could not see fit to grant the money,
but felt that it would lead to endless
requests by less worthy organizations.
