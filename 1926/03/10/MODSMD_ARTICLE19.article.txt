## TO ENTER A.A.U. MEET Cardinal Swimmers Conceded To Be Among Best in The Country 
### 
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic
! sports, and five Stanford swimmers
will leave a week from tomorrow
for a trip East where the team will
compete in the National Collegiate
j events to be held at Annapolis, and
on the return trip in the National
A.A.U. events which will be held by
i the Illinois and Chicago Athletic Clubs
in Chicago. They will return April 12.
The swimmers who will make up
jthe five-man team are: Dave Fall, cap
tain of this year's victorious swim
ming team and first varsity diver;
Arden Allen, all-around swimmer who
will compete in the backstroke and
i breaststroke events; Bob Williams,
j sprinter who won both 50- and 100-
jyard dashes in the California meet
last Friday; Wallace O'Connor, for all
j free-style events from the 440 down,
and Carl Stevenson, varsity distance
star.
j The five men will make a team
capable of competing on equal terms
with any college in the country. Allen,
Williams, O'Connor, and Stevenson
form one of the speediest relay teams
| seen around here in some time. All
can tear off a hundred-foot lap in
under 16 seconds.
Allen will be good for points in both
backstroke and breaststroke events.
He has been making around 1:56 for
the 150-yard backstroke and by the
time he reaches the East should be
in shape to win that distance from
Yale and Navy paddlers at the Na
tional Intercollegiates. O'Connor and
Williams will swim in the 50- and 100-
yard free-style sprints, and should take
first two places between them against
almost any college or club. Stevenson
should be going around 2:25 in the
i 220 by time for the trip.
Fall and O'Connor are both veterans
of the last Olympic games. Fall won
a second place in diving, losing only
to A1 White, and O'Connor swam a
fast 220 on the American 880-yard
relay squad besides playing on the
U.S. water polo team.
Stevenson, Allen, and Williams all
broke the California-Stanford records
in their events in the meet last Fri
day and could have done better with
' close competition.
The itinerary for the trip is as fol
lows: Los Angeles, where four meets
will be held including U.S.C., Southern
Branch. Hollywood Athletic Club,;
'Salt Lake; Laramee, Wyoming; Chi
jcago; Indianapolis; Pittsburgh; Phila
delphia; Brooklyn; Annapolis; and
Chicago again on the way home.
The swimmers will compete against
the very cream of American swimming
i talent at Chicago, Indianapolis Ath
! letic Club, Brooklyn Y.M.C.A., and
! Annapolis.

will be held including U.S.C., Southern
Branch. Hollywood Athletic Club,;
'Salt Lake; Laramee, Wyoming; Chi
jcago; Indianapolis; Pittsburgh; Phila
delphia; Brooklyn; Annapolis; and
Chicago again on the way home.
The swimmers will compete against
the very cream of American swimming
i talent at Chicago, Indianapolis Ath
! letic Club, Brooklyn Y.M.C.A., and
! Annapolis.
Brandsten expects to return with
! the national collegiate title and an
; almost clean record of victories in
I dual meets.
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic
! sports, and five Stanford swimmers
will leave a week from tomorrow
for a trip East where the team will
compete in the National Collegiate
j events to be held at Annapolis, and
on the return trip in the National
A.A.U. events which will be held by
i the Illinois and Chicago Athletic Clubs
in Chicago. They will return April 12.
The swimmers who will make up
jthe five-man team are: Dave Fall, cap
tain of this year's victorious swim
ming team and first varsity diver;
Arden Allen, all-around swimmer who
will compete in the backstroke and
i breaststroke events; Bob Williams,
j sprinter who won both 50- and 100-
jyard dashes in the California meet
last Friday; Wallace O'Connor, for all
j free-style events from the 440 down,
and Carl Stevenson, varsity distance
star.
j The five men will make a team
capable of competing on equal terms
with any college in the country. Allen,
Williams, O'Connor, and Stevenson
form one of the speediest relay teams
| seen around here in some time. All
can tear off a hundred-foot lap in
under 16 seconds.
Allen will be good for points in both
backstroke and breaststroke events.
He has been making around 1:56 for
the 150-yard backstroke and by the
time he reaches the East should be
in shape to win that distance from
Yale and Navy paddlers at the Na
tional Intercollegiates. O'Connor and
Williams will swim in the 50- and 100-
yard free-style sprints, and should take
first two places between them against
almost any college or club. Stevenson
should be going around 2:25 in the
i 220 by time for the trip.
Fall and O'Connor are both veterans
of the last Olympic games. Fall won
a second place in diving, losing only
to A1 White, and O'Connor swam a
fast 220 on the American 880-yard
relay squad besides playing on the
U.S. water polo team.
Stevenson, Allen, and Williams all
broke the California-Stanford records
in their events in the meet last Fri
day and could have done better with
' close competition.
The itinerary for the trip is as fol
lows: Los Angeles, where four meets
will be held including U.S.C., Southern
Branch. Hollywood Athletic Club,;
'Salt Lake; Laramee, Wyoming; Chi
jcago; Indianapolis; Pittsburgh; Phila
