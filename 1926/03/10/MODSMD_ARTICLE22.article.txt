# Support for Minor Sports
## 
### 
The Executive Committee, as representatives of the student body, last
night expressed its sentiment in the following resolution ravoring in
creased support for minor sports of the University:
"That because it is felt that in the past minor sports have not received
the financial support they need or merit, this committee recommends to
the Board of Athletic Control that, in the future budgets, sufficient money
be appropriated to carry out adequately the minor sport activities."
For years it has been apparent not only to participants, but to the en
tire campus, that many minor sports have suffered through insufficient ap
propriations, either for equipment or travel. Cardinal teams in these sports
have been forced to use inferior or old equipment,"and to forego trips to
compete with other opponents —either forcing them to come to Stanford
or going through the season without suitable competition.
The budget for major sports has not been sufficient to divert money to
the minor sports, in fact in some cases major sport teams have suffered
slightly. However, it is the less recognized activities that have shouldered
the burden.
The editor feels that undergraduate opinion is well mirrored by the
above resolution. To give increased aid to minor sports is to give them
the recognition they undoubtedly deserve.
