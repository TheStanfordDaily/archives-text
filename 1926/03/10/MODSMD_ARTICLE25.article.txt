## THE 						RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO 
### Monroe Eaton Letitia Lemon Episode XI JOHN SMITH 
The unexnected had indeed hap
pened; for this man was the real John
Smith, not the John Smith of my col
lege acquaintance, but the John Smith
of my happier days back in dear old
Squaw Lookout high school. We had
been sweethearts up to the very time
I came to college. He had sworn never
to forget me. Now he stood before me,
looking (despite his checkered suit
and derby hat) the John Smith of
old.
Yet this John Smith was not the
same poor farmer boy 1 had known.
He was rich now. I soon learned how
his millionaire uncle had died, leaving
him his entire fortune, and how John's
first thought upon hearing of his good
luck had been to come to see me. I
forgot the grief and humiliation of five
minutes before in an instant. I seemed
transported by the presence of this
John Smith to another world. The
other John Smiths were gone and for
gotten.
That evening after 1 had success
fully frustrated the lockout rule (for
the first and last time) by leaving the
hall through the back door, John took
me to the moving pictures in his new
Packard roadster. I wonder yet how
the events of two successive evenings
could be so similar and yet have such
totally opposite outcomes as those of
the two memorable nights of Friday
and Saturday.
After the movies John announced
that he had something important to
say to me. Why I should choose the
cactus gardens of all other places, I do
not know; but 1 do know that at 1
o'clock a parson responded, after
seeming ages, to a prolonged and con
tinuous rapping on his door; that at
1:15 John Smith and I were married;
and that at 1:30 a Packard roadster
was speeding down the highway with
two of the happiest souls on earth.
Epilogue
The one thing remaining to make
this narrative complete, and the one
which I fear I have "carelessly neglect
ed, is the elucidation of the remaining
problematical character of these epi
sodes, the Red Peril of Palo Alto. I
would much rather leave this subject
unmentioned forever, but the realiza
tion that the curiosity of my readers
may be unduly aroused prompts me to
devote these last lines to the clearing
up of this mystery.
Several months after John Smith
and I were married I learned from
Frank Bollsley (whom I had now for
given) that in proposing to me he had
unintentionally conferred a great
honor upon me.
If seems that there is (or at least,
was) a tradition on the campus of the
university 1 attended (the name of
which is too well known to bear men
tion) that any co-ed who receives two
proposals in one day must inevitably
have red hair, and, by virtue of this
characteristic, shall be called the Red
Peril.

I do not believe that I have ever
mentioned the fact before that my
hair has a slight tendency toward the
auburn. But as this is undisputably
the case, I have won that mysterious,
title by a shade and finally brought '
to an end the last tradition of this'
university (the name of which is too
well known to mention).

lege acquaintance, but the John Smith
of my happier days back in dear old
Squaw Lookout high school. We had
been sweethearts up to the very time
I came to college. He had sworn never
to forget me. Now he stood before me,
looking (despite his checkered suit
and derby hat) the John Smith of
old.
Yet this John Smith was not the
same poor farmer boy 1 had known.
He was rich now. I soon learned how
his millionaire uncle had died, leaving
him his entire fortune, and how John's
first thought upon hearing of his good
luck had been to come to see me. I
forgot the grief and humiliation of five
minutes before in an instant. I seemed
transported by the presence of this
John Smith to another world. The
other John Smiths were gone and for
gotten.
That evening after 1 had success
fully frustrated the lockout rule (for
the first and last time) by leaving the
hall through the back door, John took
me to the moving pictures in his new
Packard roadster. I wonder yet how
the events of two successive evenings
could be so similar and yet have such
totally opposite outcomes as those of
the two memorable nights of Friday
and Saturday.
After the movies John announced
that he had something important to
say to me. Why I should choose the
cactus gardens of all other places, I do
not know; but 1 do know that at 1
o'clock a parson responded, after
seeming ages, to a prolonged and con
tinuous rapping on his door; that at
1:15 John Smith and I were married;
and that at 1:30 a Packard roadster
was speeding down the highway with
two of the happiest souls on earth.
Epilogue
The one thing remaining to make
this narrative complete, and the one
which I fear I have "carelessly neglect
ed, is the elucidation of the remaining
problematical character of these epi
sodes, the Red Peril of Palo Alto. I
would much rather leave this subject
unmentioned forever, but the realiza
tion that the curiosity of my readers
may be unduly aroused prompts me to
devote these last lines to the clearing
up of this mystery.
Several months after John Smith
and I were married I learned from
Frank Bollsley (whom I had now for
given) that in proposing to me he had
unintentionally conferred a great
honor upon me.
If seems that there is (or at least,
was) a tradition on the campus of the
university 1 attended (the name of
which is too well known to bear men
tion) that any co-ed who receives two
proposals in one day must inevitably
have red hair, and, by virtue of this
characteristic, shall be called the Red
Peril.

I do not believe that I have ever
mentioned the fact before that my
hair has a slight tendency toward the
auburn. But as this is undisputably
the case, I have won that mysterious,
title by a shade and finally brought '
to an end the last tradition of this'
university (the name of which is too
well known to mention).
THE END
The unexnected had indeed hap
pened; for this man was the real John
Smith, not the John Smith of my col
lege acquaintance, but the John Smith
of my happier days back in dear old
Squaw Lookout high school. We had
