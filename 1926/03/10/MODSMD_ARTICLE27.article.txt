The Editor, Sir:
The Goddess of Luck surely beamed
on the fortunate writer in an incident
which occurred last night on Palo
Alto's main thoroughfare, and also
prevented what might have been a
very serious entanglement with mem
bers of the Palo Alto police depart-j
ment.
About 10:30 last evening as wej
were driving along University Avenue
1 we approached the intersection of this
thoroughfare and Middlefield Road. As
jwe approached this intersection we
wished to make a right-hand turn onto
Middlefield in order to eventually s
reach our destination. At this time
another car approached University
Avenue on our right, and in order to
give the approaching car plenty of j
room we made quite a short turn at j
the curb. When the turn was about I
half completed we noticed that within
a few inches of our car there stood
another car parked on our right, with
in a very few feet from the intersec-
I tion, facing University avenue, with
!no lights burning—and in it sat a|
policeman while his brother officer
| was at the police telephone located
j at that corner. What would have been j
I the consequences had a collision oc-j
i cured in this situation? Or, if we had |
been parked on the wrong side of the,
street, without lights, dangerously,
near the intersection, and the police!
car had come upon us in that fashion?
We wonder if the police would have
arrested us had we rammed into them.
And if so, what alibi they would put
I up had they done so.
—SAFETY FIRST. i
