# M'ELVENNY, THOMAS MAINTAIN POSITIONS IN VARSITY TENNIS
## 
### 
Ralph McElvenny and Gomer Thom
as yesterday maintained their posi
tions of No. 3 and No. 5 on the varsity
tennis squad with straight set vic
tories over Lionel Ogden and Frank
Dunn respectively. The score in the
first match was 6-4, 6-3, and in the
second, 6-3, 9-7.
Ogden played inconsistently and,
under McElvenny's steady stroking,
soon fell behind in both sets. The first
three games went to McElvenny, the
next two to Ogden, and the remaining
five alternated on the service. In the
second set, McElvenny gained a 5-1
lead, having Ogden match point in the
seventh game. At this point Ogden
rallied, won two games in decisive
manner, but slumped again to lose
the match.

Thomas played his usual consistent
game against Dunn. Thomas gained a
tlrree-game lead at first, Dunn evened
the count at 3 all, and then Thomas
again spurted to take the set in
straight games. Tlie second set was
like the first. At 5-3, however, Dunn
braced and managed to capture two
games, Thomas eventually winning
the set. v
During the inter-quarter vacation
the varsity will journey to Los An
geles, where matches will be played
with University of Southern Califor
nia, University of California Southern
Branch, and several athletic clubs.
The following players will make the
trip: Alan Herrington, Paul Fairchild,
Ralph McElvenny, Lionel Ogden, and
Gomer Thomas.
