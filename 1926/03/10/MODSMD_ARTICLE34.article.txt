# CHAPARRAL FOREIGN NUMBER COMES OUT ON FRIDAY MORNING
## 
### 
The Foreign number of Chaparral,
which will be distributed Friday morn
ing, will contain many distinctive art
features, including a full-page cartoon
by Bickerton depicting the vicissitudes
of European travel upon the American
youth. Tommy Breeze, who has been
doing cartoons and sketches for the
Chappie for some time, has designed
the cover, this being his first attempt
at cover work.
A unique innovation in this issue is l
that every cartoon will have at least
one of its pei'sonages a foreigner. Dis
tinctly foreign. Nothing within the
twelve-mile limit has been allowed in
the forthcoming publication, so the
subscribers can expect, according to
the editors, a number of salty, deep
blue stories. In fact they are all at sea.
Other art contributors are Van
King, .Aft Editor; Robert L. Philippi,
Daniel M. Mendelowitz, and Jack G.
Allen.
