# Hertz Musicians Play Brilliantly Founders' Day
## 
### Music Critic 
Alfred Hertz and the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra gave a brilliant
and vigorous interpretation of Beetho
ven's Fifth Symphony in the Founders'
Day concert held in the Memorial
Church last night. The setting of the
church was impressive and lent per
fect acoustic qualities to the music.

A Bach suite arranged for the or
chestra by Sir Henry Wood was ren
dered with freshness and vigor. The
Wood arrangement seems to have re
tained the beauty and restraint of the
classical music, at the same time add
ing the advantages and varied tonal
effects of the present orchestra.
Mischel Penha, the new first cellist
of the orchestra, was soloist in "Ele
gie," by Faure. Penha made of his
cello an instrument of fervent feeling,
instantly responsive to the moods of
the piece.
"Prize Song" Melodious
"Prize Song" from the "Mastersing
ers" by Wagner was played in its ar
rangement for orchestra, and had
more actual lyric melody and "tune"
than anything else on the program.
Hertz's rendering was expressive,
varying both in tempo and volume to
bring out all the yearning beauty and
lyric sweep of the song.
The brass sections of the orchestra

were used a trifle to excess in parts â€¢
of the symphony, but this obtained
overpowering brilliance even at the
expense of instrumental balance. Sud
den and sharp contrasts from full or- i
cliestra playing fortissimo at one in-1
stant to the soft whisper of a flute or |
clarinet at the next, abound in thej
virile Fifth Symphony, and Hertz
brought these contrasts out to the
fullest.
