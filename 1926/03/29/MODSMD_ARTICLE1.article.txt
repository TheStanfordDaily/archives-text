# BASEBALL VARSITY LOSES ALL GAMES IN VACATION TOUR
## Weak Hitting, Poor Fielding Responsible for Bad Showing in South 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
played ragged ball last Saturday and
lost to U. S. C. 5 to 0, thereby keep
ing unbroken a run of defeats that
lasted throughout its entire trip South.
The Cards lost the first game to
Bakersfield, 8 to 0 and then bowed
to Occidental 8 to 7 and Southern
Branch 6 to 4. The team unable to
come out of its slump at any time
during the trip and at no time did
it display even as much class as it
had in earlier games. Feeble hitting
and errors were responsible for the
poor showing rather than the pitching,
which was in every case good enough
to have won.
U. S. C's victory gave it the series,
the double header played here early
in March having been split. Lee
Guischard, who pitched for the Tro
jans in their victory here, was on the
mound Saturday. His tossing was
backed up by snappy fielding and
three spectacular double plays. Col
lins pitched for the Cards until the
middle of the fifth inning, when he
allowed several hits, and was replaced
by Sobieski, who held the southern
ers to one hit the remainder of the
game. Stanford made 7 hits against
8 for the Trojans but was unable to
come through in the pinches. The
bases were loaded three times.
Weak defensive play was responsible
for the majority of runs scored against
the team in all of its games. Errors
were made by every man on the squad
with disastrous results. The expected
heavy hitting was noticeable by its
absence, especially when it was most
needed. Pitching was in all cases equal
to that of the opposition. In the Occi
dental game Sobieski gained more
strikeouts and allowed fewer walks
than Teachout, the Tiger twirler, who
is one of the best mouudsmeu in the
South.
With the first California game com
ing Saturday Coach Harry Wolter will
have a job on his hands to bring the
men out of their slump.
