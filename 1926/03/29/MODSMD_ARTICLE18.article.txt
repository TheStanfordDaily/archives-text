# ANNUAL INTRAMURAL BASEBALL CONTESTS COMMENCE MONDAY
## Forty-Two Nines Will Enter; Charles W. Davis Issues Rules for Series 
### 
Intramural baseball will start next j
Monday and continue until May 7. j
Forty-two teams have entered the com- !
petition. They have been grouped in!
seven leagues, with the league win- j
ners to clash a playoff series for the
University championship.
In last year's campaign El Campo
emerged the winner by taking the de
ciding game from El Tigre. The other
league winners were Sigma Nu, Kappa I
Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Alpha !
Epsilon, and El Capitan.
It has been deemed advisable to j
divide the Encina teams by floors only
instead of re-dividing them by east
and west wings, as was done in bas
ketball. All the games will begin at
4:15 o'clock and will be seven innings j
in length. The intramural diamonds J
are numbered and are located be-1
tween the old polo field and the Mili- j
tary Headquarters. There is also a'
diamond at Sequoia. The games may !
be played before, but not after, the ;
scheduled date of the game. Games j
may be postponed only if the field is !
not available or in case of rain on the j
day when the game is scheduled. This ;
postponement in every case must be
sanctioned by Charles W. Davis, di- j
rector of intramural athletics.
According to Davis, men must re
port to their instructors in advance if |
they wish to be excused from physical
training classe sto play baseball Men
dropped from varsity or freshman
squads are eligible to compete in in- j
tramural games. After each cut the j
varsity and freshman coach will pub- j
lish a list of the men ineligible for |
competition in intramural tilts. The!
men whose names appear on the final j
list cannot play intramural baseball !
even if the varsity or freshman sea-!
son should close before the intramural
series is completed. Men must con- !
tinue the entire season 011 the team I
on which they started.
The league standings will be decided |
on a percentage basis, and any team
failing to appear forfeits. If, however, j
both squads fail to make an appear-;
ance, each is declared loser. Also, the
teams must appear at the scheduled j
time. Nine men shall constitute a
team, but seven men shall be the
minimum for a legally played contest.
Each aggregation is required to fur-j
nisli a new standard ball for every:
game. Only students registered in the i
University are eligible to compete, j
Any man having made a varsity letter ,
in baseball is ineligible.
To be eligible for competition in the
final championship series, a player
must have been in the lineup for at |
least two games. A team winning by
forfeit shall be allowed to count every
eligible man as having played in that
game.
