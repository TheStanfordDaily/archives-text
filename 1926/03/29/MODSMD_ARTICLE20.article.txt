# VARSITY DROPS MEET TO L.A.A.C. SQUAD BY NARROW MARGIN
## Charlie Paddock Does 100 in 9.6 Seconds; Richardson Runs Fast Half 
### 
Six of the best performances of the
season were hung up Saturday by
track stars when the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club aggregation nosed out the
Stanford varsity runners, 67 to 64. The
outstanding event proved to be the
century, with Charlie Paddock step
ping that distance off in the remark
able time of 9.6 seconds. It has been
five years since the "world's
fastest human" first covered the hun
dred in this time, and he has tied it
six times during that period. The meet
was held Saturday afternoon in the
stadium.
Paddock also won the century, but
he couldn't catch Ted Miller in the
last lap of the relay, the Stanford team
winning in the very good time of
1:28:2. This event was a real race, as
the first lap ended in a dead heat,
Captain Richardson gaining six yards
in the second lap, and Storie maintain
ing that lead through the third whirl.
Then Miller stepped out and kept Pad
dock to the rear.
Miller turned in a 48.8 second quar
ter, Storie and McGuire finishing in
the order named to give the Cardinals
a clean sweep on this event. Stanford
also shut out the clubmen in the high
jump, Work winning at 6 ft. 2 3-8
inches, and King and Muhs tieing for
second. But the Mercury men retali
ated by taking all three places in both
the two-mile and the pole-vault.
Captain Richardson won the 880 in
1:55:7, running one of the best races
of the day. Carter of the Mercurites
I captured the mile in the good time of
4 minutes, 22.6 seconds, beating out
I Kerr who, however, turned the four
laps in 4:26.8 in his first try at the
! event this season. To complete the day
I Eaton of the club won the javelin
| with a heave of 198 feet, 11 inches.

Six of the best performances of the
season were hung up Saturday by
track stars when the Los Angeles Ath

Stanford varsity runners, 67 to 64. The
outstanding event proved to be the
century, with Charlie Paddock step
ping that distance off in the remark
able time of 9.6 seconds. It has been
five years since the "world's
fastest human" first covered the hun
dred in this time, and he has tied it
six times during that period. The meet

in the second lap, and Storie maintain

Then Miller stepped out and kept Pad
dock to the rear.
Miller turned in a 48.8 second quar

the order named to give the Cardinals
a clean sweep on this event. Stanford
also shut out the clubmen in the high
jump, Work winning at 6 ft. 2 3-8
inches, and King and Muhs tieing for
second. But the Mercury men retali
ated by taking all three places in both
the two-mile and the pole-vault.
Captain Richardson won the 880 in
1:55:7, running one of the best races
of the day. Carter of the Mercurites

Six of the best performances of the
season were hung up Saturday by
track stars when the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club aggregation nosed out the
Stanford varsity runners, 67 to 64. The
outstanding event proved to be the
century, with Charlie Paddock step
ping that distance off in the remark
able time of 9.6 seconds. It has been
five years since the "world's
fastest human" first covered the hun
dred in this time, and he has tied it
six times during that period. The meet
was held Saturday afternoon in the
stadium.
Paddock also won the century, but
he couldn't catch Ted Miller in the
last lap of the relay, the Stanford team
winning in the very good time of
1:28:2. This event was a real race, as
the first lap ended in a dead heat,
Captain Richardson gaining six yards
in the second lap, and Storie maintain
ing that lead through the third whirl.
Then Miller stepped out and kept Pad
dock to the rear.
Miller turned in a 48.8 second quar
ter, Storie and McGuire finishing in
the order named to give the Cardinals
a clean sweep on this event. Stanford
also shut out the clubmen in the high
jump, Work winning at 6 ft. 2 3-8
inches, and King and Muhs tieing for
second. But the Mercury men retali
ated by taking all three places in both
the two-mile and the pole-vault.
Captain Richardson won the 880 in
1:55:7, running one of the best races
of the day. Carter of the Mercurites
I captured the mile in the good time of
4 minutes, 22.6 seconds, beating out
I Kerr who, however, turned the four
laps in 4:26.8 in his first try at the
! event this season. To complete the day
I Eaton of the club won the javelin
| with a heave of 198 feet, 11 inches.
