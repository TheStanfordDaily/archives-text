Loyalty to team and school is an attribute expected of every Stanford
athlete and but seldom does one fail to live up to this requirement. From
the first hard training days in September on the gridiron to the closing
days of spring on the track, hundreds of Cardinal athletes train faithfully,
abstain religiously, and work unceasinglyâ€”and most of them really under
no strict supervision.
This loyalty to the spirit of the game is really a code of honor and if
seriously violated should be rigorously punished. Two weeks ago all track
men, both varsity and freshman, were ordered to remain on the campus
during vacation in order to participate in two meets. Without this con
tinued training, Coach Templeton felt that the two squads would be in
poor condition for the meets in store early next month. It was no personal
desire that prompted such an order on Tcmpleton's part but rather his
solicitude for the physical condition of the men soon to represent Stan
ford against U.S.C. and California.
In defiance of orders and certainly contrary to the best interests of the
University, several freshman track athletes left for home on Friday of
examination week and refused to compete in either of the two meets ar
ranged for the team. Immediately they were suspended by the coach and
refused a chance to participate further as members of the 1929 squad.
It was a hard task for Templeton to carry out, this suspension of sev
eral of his star trackmen. Personally, they may have been friends of his;
and as a coach he is bound to feel the loss of certain point-getters. How
ever, the Daily feels, with alumni who have commended Templeton's
action, that his stand is upheld by the entire University and that the fresh
men in question deserve all the discipline and censure that has followed
their acts.
