Year by year honors fall upon the shoulders of Stanford athletes in
every sport. "By their prowess shall ye know them" describes well the
position of many Cardinals, and through their work the University itself
benefits in favorable publicity. It is only just that those who so add to the
prestige of Stanford should be rewarded in some manner. Major sport
teams frequently are sent on trips for competition and often the minor
sport squads receive the same recognition.
Ernst Brandsten has long made Stanford a respected competitor in
swimming. From the Olympic Games to Pacific Coast meets, Brandsten's
efforts have been seen in the efficient showing made by his teams and indi
vidual entries until at present he undoubtedly has one of the strongest
swimming squads in the country. It was thought fitting, therefore, that
the University should be represented at the Intercollegiates at Annapolis
this year and for the past two weeks the Stanford colors have been flown
in six cities throughout the country as the Cardinal squacl has progressed
eastward to the Atlantic and the Naval Academy.
Regardless of results at the intercollegiates, it is certain that some
of creditable showing will be made. Brandsten has with him a bril
liant squad. Wallace O'Conner and Dave Fall were members of the
American Olympic team in 1924, both winning points for the United
States, while Arden Allen, Robert Williams, and Carl Stevenson have all
placed in Pacific Coast title meets so often that they are weighty with i
medals.

THE EDITORIAL STAFF of the Daily Palo Alto will meet in
the office at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. All members are urged to be
present.
