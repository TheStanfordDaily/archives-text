# LICK OBSERVATORY TOUR PLANNED IN SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
A trip to Lick Observatory is in- j
eluded in the entertainment plans for
summer quarter. Although the observa-1
tory is open to visitors every Satur
day night, this annual expedition is i
the only one sponsored by the Uni-;
versity.
Lick, which is located at Mt. Hamil
ton, about fifty miles from here, ranks
with the Mt. Wilson Solar Observa-!
Tory, near Pasadena, and Yerkes Ob
servatory, which is connected with the!
University of Chicago, as one of the
three leading American observatories.
The situation is particularly favor
able for observational work, since the I
altitude of 4200 feet is sufficient to
raise it above the low fogs. The |
weather is such that the sky is un- j
clouded about sevefe months of the ■
year. The atmosphere is remarkably
steady.
Lick was built in 1876, and financed
by James Lick, a wealthy San Fran-1
ciscan. He intended the building to ■
serve as a perpetual memorial, and in j
accordance with his request, he was 1
buried under the base of the big tele-!
scope.
The equipment at the observatory is i
particularly fine. The big telescope, a i
thirty-six-inch refractor, is the second
largest in the world, and at the time
of its construction, was the first. Al-!
though the Mt. Wilson observatory is
located at a higher altitude, the work
there is devoted almost entirely to
spectroscopic work, while at Lick the
activities are chiefly concerned with
the movements of the stars.
Such men as Dr. W. W Campbell, j
John Burnham, and Dr. Helden have j
been associated with Lick Oobserva- j
tory. One of the first observations
made here was that the Polar star
was really a triple sun. The catalogs
of John Burnham, a recognized au
thority on double stars, were compiled
here.
One quality of the location of Lick !
that is particularly attractive to the j
men who are making observations!
tliere is the warm climate. One of the j
chief hardships of working in Eastern !
observatories is in the difficulty of'
hunting th»- dome of the telescopes. I
The hot air condenses on the surface j
of the lens of the telescope, producing
false illusions of thick atmosphere, i
Astronomers there are forced to work 1
in zero weather.
