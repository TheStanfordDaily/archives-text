### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON—
(P.I.P.) —Washington's varsity crew
will row at Poughkeepsie on June 26
regardless of the outcome of the Cali
fornia race, Darwin Meisnest, gradu
ate manager, has announced.
Complaints from eastern colleges
that Washington is afraid to send her
crew to the Hudson if it has been de
feated prompted the action,'Meisnest
stated. One, and possibly two, crews
will be sent to the intercollegiate re
gatta, even if defeated by the Golden
Bear next month.

Two short blasts on the university
power house whistle will call the stu
dents of the University of Oklahoma
to chapel at eight o'clock each morn
ing.
