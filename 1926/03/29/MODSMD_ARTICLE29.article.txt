# CULVER'S WORK VARIES GREATLY FROM DAY TO DAY
## 
### 
The duties of George 13. Culver,
Dean of Men, are such that he spends
no two days in the same manner. His
day may begin with a trip to the in
firmary to visit a sick student, or with
an appeal from some creditor who
holds a bad debt against one of the
fraternities.
It is Cuiver s official duty to inves
tigate all petitions for leaves of ab
sence, either temporary or permanent,
and to recommend cash loans. His
office also has charge of placing men
in the four dormitories. The Dean be
longs to the Scholarship, Registration,)
Vocational Guidance, and Public
Health committees. He is secretary of
the latter, and of the executive com
mittee of the Stanford Union and a
member of the executive committee,
of the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol.
Writing letters to parents occupies!

a good deal of the Dean's attention.
During the summer, inquiries come in
from worried mothers of students
about to enter the University as to
what kind of clothes their sons should
wear, how many bedclothes they need,
and how much money they ought to
spend.
Culver's office is a veritable dump
ing ground for questionnaires of all
sorts and from all sources. These are
all conscientiously answered and re
turned.
"Stanford bond salesmen also seem
invariably to use my name, in supply
ing references," he said.
"And then, too, hundreds of students
come in for advice or, rather, to talk
things over, for I do not often give
advice," concluded the Dean. "It is
tremendously inspiring work to come
into contact with the fellows, espe
cially those who are working their
way through."

Of the 546 students who flunked out of
Syracuse University at the end of the
first half of the college year, 128 were
freshmen.

Persuasion rather than the paddle
for pledges was urged by 11 national
campus fraternity presidents, whose
chapters had abolished paddling, at a
recent interfraternity meeting at the
University of Illinois.

Johns Hopkins is importing 20 per
sons from the Himalaya mountains to
be used in the study of evolution.

Princeton will soon have the second
largest college chapel in the world.
