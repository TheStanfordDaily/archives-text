# GERMAN WAR FUND PLACQUES HANG ON STACK-ROOM WALLS
## 
### 
On the walls of the stack-room of
the Hoover War Library are three nail-:
studded placques which are reminders
of the German Empire's devices for
raising funds during the Great War.
Silver and gold nails were sold to the
school children of Germany at a cer
tain price per nail, and were later
driven into placques in various de
signs.
The three placques in the Hoover j
library were procured some years ago.
The purpose of one of them was to
raise money for the support of the j
orphans in Essen. This one has the
design of a sheathed broadsword, with
a snake coiled about it. Underneath
is the date 1917. It is not known what I
the purpose of the other two placques I
was.
A reproduction of the Iron Cross of!
the German Empire is the theme of
one of these which has no date. The
other represents a helmet of the type
worn by the Huns at the time when
the barbarians invaded Europe. Below
the helmet is a leafy twig, not, how
ever, an olive branch. The date 011j
this one reads 1914-17.
