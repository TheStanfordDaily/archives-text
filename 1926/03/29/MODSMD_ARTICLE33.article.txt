College students of today still labor
to a too great degree under the lock
step system which makes substantially
the same demand on the brilliant man
as upon his less able companion, ac
cording to President Angell of Yale.
"Institutions of high learning," says
President Angell, "can better serve the
country by keeping the student body
within reasonable size by choosing the I
strongest student group they can se- I
cure and then giving these men the j
very best education that can be de- j
vised."
Life at college, he further com- !
mented, is geared up to a restless and !
incessant round of occupations, some j
worth while, others not.
