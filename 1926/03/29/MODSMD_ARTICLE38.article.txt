SEENIL SYKOLOGEE
Vocabularies —funny things!
Just think of color-blindness!
How does the guy whose reds are greens
Express his plural-mindness?
If he is blue, he sees but grays,
If he sees red, it's drab.
His feelings he has trouble with;
He lacks one gift of gab.
His sweetie goes out riding in
The other fellow's truck.
See green? Feel blue? See red? He can't!
In fact, he's out of luck!
The only things that he can be
Are black with awful rage,
Or white with fear, or pain, or such
He's backed clear off the stage.
[ No golden glow of health is his,
Nor any crimson blushes,
No outdoor tan, nor indoor pink,
No silver-lining gushes.
No purple passions, no, not he!
His make-up has no yellow
These are the only better things
Remaining to the fellow. —L A.B.

SEENIL SYKOLOGEE
Vocabularies —funny things!
Just think of color-blindness!
How does the guy whose reds are greens
Express his plural-mindness?
If he is blue, he sees but grays,
If he sees red, it's drab.
His feelings he has trouble with;
He lacks one gift of gab.
His sweetie goes out riding in
The other fellow's truck.
See green? Feel blue? See red? He can't!
In fact, he's out of luck!
The only things that he can be
Are black with awful rage,
Or white with fear, or pain, or such
He's backed clear off the stage.
[ No golden glow of health is his,
Nor any crimson blushes,
No outdoor tan, nor indoor pink,
No silver-lining gushes.
No purple passions, no, not he!
His make-up has no yellow
These are the only better things
Remaining to the fellow. —L A.B.
