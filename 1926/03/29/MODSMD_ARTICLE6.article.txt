# TRYOUTS FOR 1927 JUNIOR OPERA TO BEGIN TOMORROW
## Cast Includes Large Variety Of Roles; All Parts Are Important to Plot 
### 
â–  Tryouts for the 1927 Junior Opera
! open tomorrow night at 7 o'clock in
! the Assembly Hall.
The name and plot of the opera have
not been announced, but the directors,
Charles Parks and Leonard Schwartz,
state that there is a great variety in
parts for the cast, and that a large
| number of students will be required
i for the choruses.
The cast has thirteen parts, all of
i which are closely integrated with the
j story and each of which is individually
! important to the plot. The parts are
] unusually well distributed. Besides
| several smaller parts there are three
! leading women roles. Two clever char
i acters have been worked out for old
| men parts, and added to a dual male
j lead, make the cast a well-rounded
j one.
Due to the fact that the cast is
| more extensive and that there are
only two shows this quarter, the Junior
Opera and the Senior Faroe, the stage
and cast direction will be as complete
as possible. In order to work properly
. the directors are anxious to get the
i trials off as soon as they can, and
| desire that all students who wish to
try out come to the Assembly Hall
! tomorrow night. Both the chorus and
J cast will be heard
Gordon Davis, dramatic coach, and
Lester Seib, a former student now on
i the professional stage, are working
with the script that has been prepared
I
; by Tommy Breeze, '27, and Harry Bou
| tell, '28. This is the first time the stage
| work for a Junior Opera has been
j worked out beforehand. It is expected
: that this will allow the directors to do
more work on the individuals and pre
| elude the necessity of their working
out the small details of staging.
