'Like Krights of Old
This Bank Protects You!
T) EMEMBER your history with the Knight of yoreâ€”gallant,
powerful, and considerate. He was symbolic of everything
that meant protection and civility.
And today this Bank occupies a similar part in the history of this
community. Ever courteous, ever mindful of your interest, you
will find this Bank a friendly one, backed by a healthy surplus and
ready at all times to offer you financial protection to which you are
entitled.
