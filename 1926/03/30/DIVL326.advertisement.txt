Opportunity to Make
Your College Training Pay
lARGE, modern investment institutions require a high
j average of ability in their personnel. Customers expect
from them the most complete, well-informed service in
every detail.
Organizations equipped to give this kind of service af
ford broad opportunity for the exercise of ability that
should naturally develop from college training—especially
if it has been undertaken with a business career in view.
The primary requirement is a well trained, straight
thinking mind. Without that, a man could not depend
upon his personality or his friends, to sell bonds. Nor
without it could he go far in the more technical branches
of the bond business.
Each year, Halsey, Stuart & Co. selects a limited number
of men for its various offices, from among college-trained
applicants. Before being assigned to actual work, these
men are given several months' training, with pay, in the
fundamentals of the bond business—to give them added
foundation for development beyond the work they may
immediately undertake in the organization.
We shall be glad to send you further information
