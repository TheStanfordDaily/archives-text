# DAILY PALO ALIO STAFF TRYOUTS BEGIN THURSDAY
## CONTINUE FOR A WEEK Tryoutees to Meet in Press Building at 12: 50 for Instructions 
### 
Tryouts for places on the editorial
staff of the Daily Palo Alto will be
held for one week beginning Thurs*
day. Tryoutees will meet on the sec
ond floor of the Press building at
12:50 Thursday for instructions re
garding their work during the tryout
period. Several positions are open, the
exact number depending on the qual
ity of the work done by those trying
out.
The tryoutees will write a news
.story, each covering some field of ac
tivity. In addition special assignments
will be made for feature stories. No
limitations will be placed upon the
fields which the tryoutees may cover,
and extra credit will be given any try
outee getting a scoop over a regular
reporter.
Freshmen and sophomores are de
sired as candidates. This quarter com
petition will not be so keen as it has
been the past two quarters. Conse
quently an excellent opportunity is of
fered for making the staff. Tryoutees
who have previously tried out may try
again.
Work on the Daily staff gives the
individual the opportunity to keep in
touch with campus affairs and offers
a training of general value. For this
reason not only prospective journalism
majors but any others interested in
campus activities should try out.
The meetings will not be long
enough to interfere with one o'clock
classes.
