# OPENING TRYOUTS FOR JUNIOR OPERA PLANNED TONIGHT
## One Men's and Two Women's Choruses Will Be Used In Production 
### Frank Baker 
Those intending to try out for the
1927 Junior Opera are requested by
Charles Parks, director, to be in the
Assembly hall at 7 o'clock sharp, to
night.
Parks is one of the most experienced
actors on the campus, having made his
first appearance in 1922 in "If I Were
King." He was one of the leads in
"Milestones," the Masquers' play of
1923, played in Kapek's "R.U.R.," pro
duced in the fall of 1924, and was also
in "You and I," "Polly With a Past,"
"Dear Brutus," and "Ray, Ray, Rover
Boys." Besides these he has been in
several skits in football and track
shows.
Schwartz Experienced
Leonard Schwartz, who is assisting
Parks, has also had considerable ex
perience in campus productions. . In
the Sophomore Play of 1927, "Dulcy,"
he took the lead, and made his debut.
Since that time he has been in one
play a quarter. "You and I," "Polly
With a Past," "The Goose Hangs
High," and "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys,"
completes his list of appearances at
Stanford.
Both Parks and Schwartz, because
of their experience under Gordon Davis
and others, will make competent di
rectors, and will pick the cast and
choruses themselves. There are two
women's choruses and one men's
chorus. These choruses will have more
time than usual to work and it is
hoped that some new material will be
found, as the directors desire to get
not merely dancers, but dancers with
some dramatic ability. Chrysella Dun
ker, who has charge of the dances, will
arrange the appropriate steps for the
pantaloons and hoop skirt period.
