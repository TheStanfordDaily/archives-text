# COAST TITLE AT STAKE IN TRACK MEET WITH U.S.C.
## Stanford Favored to Take 440, 880; Jumpers Will Meet Opposition 
### 
| University of Southern California's
track and field men will have the
Pacific Coast championship at stake
when they meet the strong Stanford
team Saturday afternoon on the sta
j dium oval. The Trojans scored a de
j cisive victory over California and by
i virtue of their good showing are ex
| pected to make a high bid for the
coast title.
Where California was weakest Stan
ford seems to be the strongest. In the
440 and the 880 the Cards appear to be
almost unbeatable. Stanford is favored
to win both these events.
Sprinters Strong
In the sprints, where Southern Cali
fornia took 17 out of a possible 18
points from California, Stanford has
better men to be reckoned with. Cov
erly and Gaspar will give the Trojan
sprint aces, House and Smith, plenty
of trouble in the century, while the
fast Southern California "Triple
Threat," House, Smith, and Parsons, in
the furlong will probably be broken
by the Stanford sprinters.
Houser Certain
Captain Bud Houser, the Southern
weight star, should prove supreme in
the shot and discus. Houser tossed the
shot 50 feet 1 5-8 inches, and threw
the discus 149 feet in the meet against
i the Bears. Biff Hoffman will give the
j CJ.S.C. captain a good fight in the
' weight events, and Evans is likely to
i figure in the discus.
Tom Work is the outstanding per
former in the high jump. He will be
1 hard pressed by a trio of Trojan jump
ers, Coggeshal, Ofstad, and Ross, who
| have all done G feet 2 inches fairly
i consistently. This should prove to be
one of the most interesting events in
! the meet, and should produce a num-
I ber of good jumps. Barnes is conceded
a first place in the pole vault for the
Southern team. His consistent show
ing around the 13-foot mark cannot be
; touched by the Stanford vaulters.
Broad Jump Close
Meeks and McCrae will encounter
j plenty of opposition in the broad jump.
J Reynolds and Kaer, U.S.C. jumpers,
: took first and third against California,
j and will force the Stanford men well
j over the 23-foot mark for victory.
J Cook, Trojan javelin thrower, beat out
! the Bruin spear tossers, but Harlow
I is expected to better Cook's best toss.
Shipkey is figured for a third place in
' this event.
j Stanford's relay team, considered
j the fastest on the coast, should give
! the Cards the final points of the meet.
The combination of Babcock, Richard
' son, Storie, and Miller should cover
the four-lap relay in nearly record
| time.
