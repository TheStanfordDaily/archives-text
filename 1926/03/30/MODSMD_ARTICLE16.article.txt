# REGISTRATION FOR SPRING NOW SHOWS RECORD INCREASE
## 
### 
Registration figures attained a
new level for spring quarttr en
rollment when 2758 students com
pleted their registration yester
day, with fifty-one more to com
plete registering today. This num
ber exceeds last year's enrollment
for spring by more than 200.
If the gain in numbers for the
end quarter total registration is
approximately the same this
spring as last spring, the enroll
ment will nearly equal last quar
ter's, which is unprecedented in
the history of the University.
Each quarter, for the past three
or four years, has shown an ap
proximate increase of 200 over
the corresponding quarter the
year before. This increase has
been entirely confined to the
upper division and graduate stu
dents, as the number of new
lower division students allowed
each quarter is limited. The num
ber of upper division and gradu
ate students is not limited, ex
cept in the case of the women,
who are limited to 500'.
