# CARDINAL MERMEN VICTORIOUS OVER PITTSBURG TEAMS
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers continued their
victorious way East by defeating the
Pittsburg Athletic Club and Carnegie
Tech in a three-cornered meet at Pitts
burg yesterday. The five Card mermen
accumulated 35 points against 31 * for
the Athletic Club team and 2 for the
engineers. Wally O'Connor, Bob Wil
liams, Carl Stevenson, Arden Allen,
and Captain Dave Fall make up the
squad which has been trimming full
sized college and cli/b squads along
the way.
The national collegiate titles in the
■competition at the United States Naval
Academy, Annapolis, are the Eastern
goal of the squad, led by Coach Ernst
Brandsten. They will also meet the
strong Brooklyn Y.M.C.A. team while
in New York.
Arden Allen will swim in the 150-
yard backstroke event at Annapolis.
His times in competition on the way
East have been fast. Even against the
best Eastern compeition he should
have a good chance to win. Carl Ste
venson is the Card hope in the 440-
yard free style. He is even better at
this race than in the 220 which he
easily won in the California meet.
Dave Fall has won every diving com
petition along the way and seems
clearly superior to all collegiate divers
in the country.
