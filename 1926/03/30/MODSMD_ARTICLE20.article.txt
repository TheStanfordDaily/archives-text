cuts or abridgements when Dvorak's
great work, "Stabat Mater," is given
in the Memorial Church next Friday
evening at 8 o'clock. A mixed chorus
of 100 voices and a 40-piece orchestra
made up of members of the San Fran
cisco Symphony will take part. Under
the leadership of Mr. Warren D. Allen,
Universilty organist, the choir, aug
mented by members of the Stanford
Glee Club, the Schubert Club, the Palo

rehearsing for the past quarter.
Solo Parts
Solo parts will be taken by Mrs.
Flora Howells Bruneer, soprano; Mrs.

bass. Wallace Rolls will play the
Memorial Church organ in the part

of orchestral instruments which will
give richness and body to the tone. A
forty-piece orchestra makes it possible

Composed in 1875
"Stabat Mater" was composed in
1875 by Anton Dvorak, then an obscure
musician. Its production by the Lon

fame to the composer, for it was recog
nized as a work of beauty and power.
According to critics it is the greatest
work dedicated to the glory of the
Catholic Church since Verdi's "Re
quiem."
The old Latin hymn, "Stabat Mater,"
is divided into ten sections made up
of choral and solo passages of great
beauty. Quartette, duet, and solo num
bers are contained in the oratorio. The
orchestration is characteristic of
Dvorak in dramatic effect and use of
instrumental color.
No admission will be charged for
the performance. At 7:30 the front
doors will be opened for students, fac
ulty, and University officers. Residents
of Palo Alto and surrounding com
munities will be admitted at 7:45 at

Rehearsal of the women's chorus
will take place tonight at 7:30 in Room
84, according to Mr. Allen. The entire
chorus of 100 will rehearse tomorrow
night at 7:30 in the Memorial Church.
For the first time in the musical
history of Stauford, an oratorio will
be produced complete without any
cuts or abridgements when Dvorak's
great work, "Stabat Mater," is given
in the Memorial Church next Friday
evening at 8 o'clock. A mixed chorus
of 100 voices and a 40-piece orchestra
made up of members of the San Fran
cisco Symphony will take part. Under
the leadership of Mr. Warren D. Allen,
Universilty organist, the choir, aug
mented by members of the Stanford
Glee Club, the Schubert Club, the Palo
Alto Morris Club, and others, has been
rehearsing for the past quarter.
Solo Parts
Solo parts will be taken by Mrs.
Flora Howells Bruneer, soprano; Mrs.
Anna K. Boltcky, contralto. Mr.
Gwynfi Jones, tenor; Mr. Victor Vogel,
bass. Wallace Rolls will play the
Memorial Church organ in the part
scored for that instrument.
The oratorio will be produced full
length as written with a complement
of orchestral instruments which will
give richness and body to the tone. A
forty-piece orchestra makes it possible
to realize the full possibilities of the
impressive and melodious music.
Composed in 1875
"Stabat Mater" was composed in
1875 by Anton Dvorak, then an obscure
musician. Its production by the Lon
don Musical Society in 1883 brought
fame to the composer, for it was recog
nized as a work of beauty and power.
According to critics it is the greatest
work dedicated to the glory of the
Catholic Church since Verdi's "Re
quiem."
The old Latin hymn, "Stabat Mater,"
is divided into ten sections made up
of choral and solo passages of great
beauty. Quartette, duet, and solo num
bers are contained in the oratorio. The
orchestration is characteristic of
Dvorak in dramatic effect and use of
instrumental color.
No admission will be charged for
the performance. At 7:30 the front
doors will be opened for students, fac
ulty, and University officers. Residents
of Palo Alto and surrounding com
munities will be admitted at 7:45 at
the side doors of the church.
