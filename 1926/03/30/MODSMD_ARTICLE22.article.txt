The Daily Palo Alto is a member of the Pacific Intercollegiate Press Association and
receives its full news report. The P. I. N. S. is entitled to the use of all news published in
these columns.
Entered as second-class matter November 6, 1919, at the postoffice at Stanford University,

Desk Editor Today—Monroe Eaton
SHORTLY BEFORE THE CLOSE of the past quarter the entire
Stanford community sorrowed. Eric Jordan, '24, the youngest son of
Dr. and Mrs. David Starr Jordan, was "the victim of an auto accident, and
was taken from earthly existence as he was well started on a career of
promise as a scientist.
On behalf of the entire student body, the Daily Palo Alto extends
its sincerest sympathy to Dr. and Mrs. Jordan and to their son's bride of
a month, Elizabeth Roper Jordan, '25.
As a student Eric was well known and highly respected by all who
were in contact with him. As a scientist those of us who were acquainted
with him are sure that he would have been a worthy son of a famed father.

SHORTLY BEFORE THE CLOSE of the past quarter the entire
Stanford community sorrowed. Eric Jordan, '24, the youngest son of
Dr. and Mrs. David Starr Jordan, was "the victim of an auto accident, and
was taken from earthly existence as he was well started on a career of
promise as a scientist.
On behalf of the entire student body, the Daily Palo Alto extends
its sincerest sympathy to Dr. and Mrs. Jordan and to their son's bride of
a month, Elizabeth Roper Jordan, '25.
As a student Eric was well known and highly respected by all who
were in contact with him. As a scientist those of us who were acquainted
with him are sure that he would have been a worthy son of a famed father.
