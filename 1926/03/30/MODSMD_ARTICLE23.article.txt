# The 						Students as a Critic
## 
### 
For many years university students have been forced to rely for in
formation regarding courses and professors either upon official bulletins,
or upon the oral statement of a friend. The first method, we will be
brazen enough to declare, is not altogether indicative. The facts are too
cut and dried. And all of us have learned that in a matter of such import
we cannot trust even the opinion of our l>est friend.
Several eastern colleges have innovated a supplementary system and
their plan has been taken up for the first time on the Pacific Coast by the
University of Washington Daily. This paper conducts a department each
day captioned "Curricula Critic-orials." In each issue a few of the courses
offered by the university are critically discussed by the staff of the pub
lication.
Interviews which have appeared in the columns of the sheet indicate
that the criticism is being well received on the campus. The following
commendation was advanced by a professor in the psychology department:
"Any instructor should welcome such an impartial estimate of the work
lie is doing. I am in hearty accord with what was said about the Psy
chology 1 course. The members of the faculty whose opinion I have heard
believe these criticisms will have good results."
In the same article it is stated that one faculty member condemned the
idea because he did not believe that students were competent to criticize the
work of their instructors. A fellow professor was the first to refute this
objection. He said, "These comments are interesting and true. Whether
the students are competent to judge the courses in the university should
not matter. They are the ones who take them and their opinions are worth
a whole lot to the faculty."
The disclosures of the "Critic-orials" are on first sight rather startling,
but after a few are perused the fundamental soundness of the scheme be
comes apparent. The opinions which are advanced are those of a repre
sentative university group and should serve not only as a guide to the
students, but also as a means by which the professor may appraise his
own worth and the worth of his courses.
The praise given by instructors shows that the scheme is not unappre
ciated. Perhaps a few courses will be re-outlined and a few professors
will endeavor to make the work in their courses more interesting. "Pipes"
may be revamped into tough courses, much to the disgust of many
"scholars"; but all in all the student body will benefit. The idea appears
to be an excellent one.
