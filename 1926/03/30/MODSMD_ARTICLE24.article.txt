One hundred Southern California alumni feted the Stanford baseball
nine during vacation on its tour of the southern colleges. Recently, too,
the Transbay alumni held forth in the banquet hall for the Cardinal swim
mers now touring the east. On both occasions ti was observed by an un
dergraduate member of the student body that the hosts had "more lire"
than any student rally could hope to muster.
This display of good-will on the part of Stanford alumni has come to
the surface on many such occasions during the past decade and is duly ap
preciated by the undergraduates. When men grown old in the ruts of
business can take two hours off to pay homage to a score of young hopefuls
bearing the colors of their own Alma Mater it shows that that elusive
will-o-the-wisp, "school spirit" means something more than bonfires and
skyrockets.
Outburst of immorality at McGill University as seen in the columns of
the McGill Daily:
"Hot! Red-hot! White-hot! These are the adjectives that flit across "the
inner eye of consciousness' as the outer eye, or both of them, drinks in the spectacle
of Miss Gilda Gray's superb form, illuminated by the ghastly-white spotlights as she
tosses her beautiful blond hair and rolls 'them wicked orbs, like cess-pools of
iniquity.'"
Big opportunities go glimmering at Oregon Agricultural College as re
ported in the O.A.C. Daily liaromctcr:
"Those desiring arc urged to attend the dance by Bert Fchren, chairman of the
junior prom committee, even if they do not have tuxedos."
