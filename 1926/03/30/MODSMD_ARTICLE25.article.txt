advice to their professors on the number of grade points they ought, to have.
2. If it is permissable to cut class on registration day.
3. What has become of the freslnnan who registered for twenty units of
math.
4. Why they don't give prizes for the best achievement in obtaining
"additional" honor points on the day after registration.
5. Just how old a student has to be before he can belong to the "Old"
Upper or Lower Division.
6. If there is anybody who hasn't found out why lie got aC — when he
should have gotten an A.
7. What a person would do with his registration book stubs if he didn't
drop them on the lioor of the Administration Building.
8. What the University means* by the phrase "If in the same locality"
in the following registration blank:

Address of father or guardian :
Address of mother (if in the same locality)
9. If this is not sufficient grounds for every student to sue the University
for libel to the extent of $96.
10. Why they don't save students trouble by marking pipe courses in the
