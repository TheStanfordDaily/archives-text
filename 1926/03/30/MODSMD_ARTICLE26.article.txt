# FA BLE OF JA DED GE-RALD
## 
### 
Ge-rald Gug-gle-bill was a Big Gun. He was Not raised on a Farm. Hea
vens, I mean Hell, No —his Life has been Spent in a Su-burb of the Big Ci-ty.
The Clo-sest he had Come to a Cow was Bull Dur-ham, and a Chick-en was a
Bad Egg to Him. He had Grown Fa-mous a-mong his Friends by the Vi-tu
pe-ra-tive Man-ner with which he Mouth-ed his Cur-ses
He was Case-har-den-ed, and Kept that Way for the Sake of his Re-pu-ta
tion. Ge-rald Work-ed in a Pool Room where they had Lead-lin-ed Splt-oons
for Chem-i-cal Pur-pos-es. It was Noth-ing for Ge-rald to Drink a Thim-ble of
Pois-on-ous Ap-ple-jack with a Da-ring Smile and a Loud Guf-faw. But his
Fate ap-proach-ed with Speed.
Lu-ring Lu-lu, the Hot Tot-sy Vamp-ire from the Mar-ket Street Dol-lies,
Came to Town. She saw Ge-rald, and Fell for Him, Ker-plunk. He didn't
know How to Dodge Her he didn't Want to, Any-how. Soon she was
Da-ting him Up—Real Fast Par-ties, Too —and Then, One Fa-tal Night She
Took him Out Ri-ding, and she Said Something. 000000. Gerald got Out,
Evi-dent-ly to Walk Home
Now we Have a Mo-ral: But Ja-ded Ge-rald. —L.A.B.
