# THANKS FOR THE BUGGY RIDE
## 
### 
Each year there comes a warmer flush when days are turning mellow;
The sun is cozy and the slush has ceased to plague a fellow.
The robins come in droves and flocks with chirps and songs and hollers,
And students wear ungartered socks and sport unbuttoned collars.
The lake fills up with floating bugs of many a friendly tribe,
And, mingling with the unshaved pugs here, basks Ye Cabbage Scribe.
The sun burns shoulders, arms, and legs —why, just to live is keen!
Then evening comes along and begs—a spin in Her machine!
You ride —you queen—of course you do! You park—and things are swell —
Then skeeters —only one or two —but they raise merry Hell.
They bite —oh, yes—but that's not all —they make you swat your face
And lose your temper so you call your curses on the place.
And furthermore the blasted bites have ruined your complexions;
Your girl and you will sure be sights—besides, your spoiled affections!!
Your necking's ruined —and your girl is probably quite mad —
Your language made her blonde hair curl —Blank! blank! you are a cad!!!
And so with pain I greet the Spring, the lovers' happy season —
Mosquitoes, bugs, and everything—l hate it —and with reason!!!!
