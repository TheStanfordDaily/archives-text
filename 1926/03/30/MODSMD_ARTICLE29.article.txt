# DR. GARDNER BEGINS DAY WITH MORNING CHAPEL SERVICES
## 
### 
A deacon of a Scotch kirk once said
of his minister: "He is inyisible six |
days of the week and incomprehensi- !
ble on the seventh."
That is not true of the Stanford i
chaplain. Dr. D Charles Gardner, chap-i
lain of the University, is the first man
on the Quad in the morning. Ho meets
a group of devout souls in morning
chapel, at ten minutes to eight.
"Tell your readers to think that over
when they wake up tomorrow morn
ing," Dr. Gardner said.
The chaplain keeps office hours
from 9 to 12 o'clock every morning, |
during which time he talks to stu- i
dents and answers questions ranging
from perplexities of the Trinity to j
whether or not to become engaged.!
His afternoons he devotes to reading i
and study, occasionally visiting the \
hospital and the Convalescent Home, j
Dr. Gardner offers courses in Eng-1
lish and Biblical Literature, and he j
is continually being called upon to
give lectures outside the University i
as well.
"In my spare time," he added, "I
like to play a game of golf."
It is a great life, according to this J
chaplain, who says he would not!
change his job for any other. He finds J
that all it needs is good sense, pa
tience, and a sense of humor.
Only one violator of trie honor sys- j
tem was found during final examina- j
tions at Cincinnati University. He
was punished by expulsion.
