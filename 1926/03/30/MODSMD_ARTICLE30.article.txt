# STANFORD LIBRARY BOASTS CHAOTIC HISTORY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE ONCE HELD BOOK STACKS EARTHQUAKE RAZED "JEWEL FUND" BUILDING

### Hallie Keating 
The nucleus of the Stanford Library j
has been through a more chaotic evo-;
lution than any other department in j
the University, and consisting mostly :
of textbooks donated by students, and
loan books from professors, occupied
the building on the inner quad which i
is now filled by the Law library. It j
grew as rapidly as the new college, j
and the necessity soon arose for a new j
building.
Students Move Books
The Thomas Welton Library was j
completed on the outerquadrangle. It!
was the same building which is now
used for the administration offices.
Soon after the completion the entire
student body turned out one after
noon and moved the library books to
the new building.
The lower room of the building was :
the main reading room, where the
desks, with capacity of fours, were
located. The loan desk occupied the
space where the registrar's offices
now are. Rooms now used for the of
fices of Dr. Wilbur, Mr. Roth, and Mr.
Culver, were the Periodical Room,
Reference Room, and Document Room.
The upstairs was used for seminars.
The stacks were in the rear of the
building, consisting of a two-level
stack on the first floor extending into ■
the basement.
The number of books was increas- j
ing rapidly, and the necessity for a j
new building was imperative. Mrs. ]

! Stanford realized thi.s, and in 1900
j created a fund to be known as "Jewel
| Fund" which was to be used for a new
library. Construction was begun 011 a
building opposite the museum. It was
completed about 1906, and Mrs. Stan
; ford was able to see the University as
' she had planned it complete.
111 1906 the earthquake destroyed
I practically all the new library. The
i dome remained 011 the steel frame-1
j work as a curious landmark for sev- j
j eral years. Steps were not taken to |
I reconstruct it till 1913, when the!
architects, Uakewell and Brown, be
gan plans for the new building.
Present Library
The University was faced by the i
problem of finding a location site that 1
I would be convenient to the History, !
j Economics, and Language depart
ments, since these make the most use
of the library. The location must per
mit future enlargement, and be suf
ficiently isolated as a precaution ]
against fire Regard had to be paid j
to the size and symetry of the pro-1
posed building in relation to the quad-!
rangles.
The position now occupied by the,
library was finally chosen, and it was j
planned to make the building the cen-1
; tral feature of a new quadrangle that
| will be constructed eventually to the j
j east of the present ones. The workj
j was begun in July, 1917, and completed I
j in July, 1919.

The nucleus of the Stanford Library j

the University, and consisting mostly :
of textbooks donated by students, and
loan books from professors, occupied
the building on the inner quad which i
is now filled by the Law library. It j
grew as rapidly as the new college, j
and the necessity soon arose for a new j
building.
Students Move Books
The Thomas Welton Library was j
completed on the outerquadrangle. It!
was the same building which is now
used for the administration offices.
Soon after the completion the entire
student body turned out one after
noon and moved the library books to
the new building.
The lower room of the building was :
the main reading room, where the
desks, with capacity of fours, were
located. The loan desk occupied the
space where the registrar's offices
now are. Rooms now used for the of
fices of Dr. Wilbur, Mr. Roth, and Mr.
Culver, were the Periodical Room,
Reference Room, and Document Room.
The upstairs was used for seminars.
The stacks were in the rear of the
building, consisting of a two-level
stack on the first floor extending into ■
the basement.
The number of books was increas- j
ing rapidly, and the necessity for a j
new building was imperative. Mrs. ]

! Stanford realized thi.s, and in 1900
j created a fund to be known as "Jewel
| Fund" which was to be used for a new
library. Construction was begun 011 a
building opposite the museum. It was
completed about 1906, and Mrs. Stan
; ford was able to see the University as
' she had planned it complete.
111 1906 the earthquake destroyed
I practically all the new library. The
i dome remained 011 the steel frame-1

j eral years. Steps were not taken to |
I reconstruct it till 1913, when the!
architects, Uakewell and Brown, be
gan plans for the new building.

The University was faced by the i
problem of finding a location site that 1
