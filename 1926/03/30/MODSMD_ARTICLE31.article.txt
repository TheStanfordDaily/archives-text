# PEIRCE'S "PHYSIOLOGY OF PLANTS" PUBLISHED
## 
### 
"The Physiology of Plants," a new
book by Dr. George James Peirce, pro
fessor of botany and plant physiology,
has been published by Henry Holt and
Company. This volume will be used as
a textbook at Stanford and other uni
versities throughout the United States.
In his preface Professor Peirce
states that the differences in this book
and his last represent the differences
due to time, changes in interest, and
changes in perspective. Some of his
departures from the usual are by way
of suggestion for the future of the
science, some for the convenience of
the reader.
Dr. Peirce in this book has stated
his own opinion as hypothesis rather
than Dogma, hoping in this way to
stimulate rather than satisfy his
reader. He has used bibliography as
recent as possible.
