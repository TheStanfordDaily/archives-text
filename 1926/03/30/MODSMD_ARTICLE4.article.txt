# VARSITY TOSSERS MEET CALIFORNIA NEXT SATURDAY
## Need of Practice Shown by Team in Games Played On Trip South 
### 
With the first California game sche
duled for next Saturday, Coach Harry 1
Wolter and the varsity baseball squad <
have four days of intensive work j i
ahead. Much to be done and no excuse 5
for over-confidence is the state of the i
Stanford nine. In its trip South the
varsity lost four games to teams that s
were no better than the Card ball- 1
players had they been in their best i
condition. Stanford threw more runs ' i
away by errors, wild-throwing, and j (
generally ragged playing than their 1
rivals actually earned on clean-cut t
hits. 3
Chuck Johnston, the mainstay at 1
first base, is lost to the team this
quarter because of scholastic defi- (
ciencies, which adds still further to '<
Wolter's problem. Johnston played at j i
sack number one all through the sea- 1
son and was an essential cog in the 1
infield machine. To replace him Wolter I
will probably use Paddy Draper who <
had some experience at first in his i
freshman year. He is a clever ball- -
player and should be able to work into 1
the position in a short time.
At the beginning of the season
things looked as if the Cards were 1
going to have an airtight defense, and j ]
a bunch of hard-and-often hitters, with '
a weakness in pitching. Now things
have switched and pitching is the only j
department in which the Stanford
nine compared favorably with the I
teams it met on its trip. The defense
was as full of holes as the proverbial
Swiss and the slugging anticipated
was conspicuous by its absence in the
pinches. There is great potential bat
ting ability on Wolter's squad, its past;
performance has shown that, and it j
requires bringing out, rather than de-!
velopment.
