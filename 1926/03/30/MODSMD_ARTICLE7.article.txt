# TEMPLETON WORKS FRESHMAN SQUAD FOR BRUIN MEET
## Yearlings Show Strength in Sprints, Weight Events, Pole Vault 
### 
Dink Templeton is rounding out a
well-balanced 1929 track squad for the
California babe meet a week from Sat
urday. The freshmen are particularly
strong on the track and in the weight I
and pole vault events.
The high jump is one of the weakest
spots on the team. Paine, although he |
has been very erratic, has the best
record with a jump of 5 feet 9%
inches. With a broad-jumper capable
of 21 feet 6 inches, the California
babes are favored in this event. Pres
ton and Lauritzen of the Stanford
yearlings have been getting over 20 j,
feet consistently.
Syer and Berry are capable of han
dling the sprints in satisfactory style
against the Bruin cubs. Dales, quarter- j
miler, is the outstanding performer in
his event with 51.8 as his best mark ,
with DeAlessio and Moss both able to j
get down close to 52 flat. McKinnon is :
the leading lialf-miler with French his
running mate. Gooden, Conner, and
Jost have shown up best in the four- i
lap grind, with Gooden turning in the j
best time of 4:44.8 last Saturday.
Nelson and Preston are two hurdlers
capable of winning the majority of |
points against the Bears. They can do 1
under 16.4 in the highs and under 2G i
in the 220 lows. With five fast men in !
Dales, McKinnon, Moss, DeAlessio, !
and Syer, the relay should be a victory !
for the Cardinal.
The pole vault is one of the babes' j
strongest events with Hulsman able I
to do 12 feet 6 inches and Edmonds j
clearing 12 feet. The shot put is well j
taken care of by Fleishacker and ;
Tandy who should place against the
Cubs. They both can put the shot out
42 feet. These men are also the lead-;
ing discus heavers with Tandy capable j
of 135 feet. Sparling is the only spear
tosser of note and can do 165 feet con
sistently.
