FOR MOTHERS' DAY, MAY 9th
Dear Friends,
It's getting so that a "special day"
doesn't mean as much as it used to. We have a
"day" for this, that and the other thing and with
all our days filled 'most to the brim, we are apt
to overlook and forget the most important day of all.
The Second Sunday in May has been set
aside as the one day in the whole year when we
should do something special, something different
or something extra for MOTHER.
It doesn't need be anything that costs
a lot of money, rather not just so it conveys
the loving thought that we want it to.
Nothing is more suitable for this
occasion than a box of Artstyle Chocolates, which
are put up in a beautiful colored metal box, with
an appropriate top in the form of a beautiful,
illustrated sentiment, handsomely framed, which
will make a permanent souvenir of the occasion.
A one-pound box $1.50.
We have convenience for packing and
mailing and will be glad to book your reservation
now and take care of delivering it at exactly the
right time.
Very truly yours,
WEINGARTNER & CO.
THE REXALL STORE, Palo Alto, California
