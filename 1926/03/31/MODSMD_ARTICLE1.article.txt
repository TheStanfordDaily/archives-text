# JOHNSTON ELIGIBLE FOR VARSITY ROLES SCHOLARSHIP BOARD
## CLERICAL ERROR RIGHTED Improvement Shown by Nine In Practice Yesterday; Wolter Confident 
### 
Chuck Johnston will be eligible for
baseball, according to the latest deci
sion of the scholarship committee.
Through a clerical error the Cards'
star first baseman was declared barred
from participation in the California
series but the mistake has been recti
fied.
The news is welcome to Coach
Harry Wolter for Johnston has been
part of the regular infield lineup since
the beginning of the season and is the
outstanding first sac.ker on the squad.
All Players Eligible
The varsity nine will be intact. All
■other varsity players are eligible for
competition.
The squad displayed a better brand
of baseball in practice yesterday than
it has for some time past. Wolter has
confidence in the ability of his men
to be in good shape by next Saturday
afternoon when the first ball of the
three-game California series will be
tossed at Berkeley. The men yesterday
had a tighter defense and made fewer
errors in play than in the playing on
the trip South.
Sobieski to Oppose U.C.
The battery for Saturday's game
will be Sobieski and Sypher, accord
ing to Wolter's present plans. Both are
members of last year's freshman nine.
Sobieski and Steve Collins are the two
dependable twirlers on the squad. The
former appears to have the edge from
his past showing. He has a consistent
record in all games played with few
hits allowed and a goodly proportion
of strikeouts. It was only his clever
tossing in the Occidental game that
kept the Tigers from beating Stanford
by a bigger score than they did.
In this game he faced Teachout. one
of the most highly touted pitchers in
Southern California, and according to
the statistics of the game, threw a
better brand of ball, for he allowed
fewer walks and made more strikeouts
than the Southerner. Both allowed
practically the same number of hits.
Outfield Shift Looms
Collins also was in good form on
the trip although he was hit frequent
ly in the U.S.C. game.
Sypher works well with both pitch
ers and with the rest of the team. His
playing is steady and experienced.
A shift in the outfield lineup is ex
pected within a day or two. Wolter
will probably work Bill Clark into the
lineup, and possibly Bob Sims.
Batting practice will occupy a large
part of the team's attention in the
short time remaining.

tossing in the Occidental game that
kept the Tigers from beating Stanford
by a bigger score than they did.
In this game he faced Teachout. one
of the most highly touted pitchers in
Southern California, and according to
the statistics of the game, threw a
better brand of ball, for he allowed
fewer walks and made more strikeouts
than the Southerner. Both allowed
practically the same number of hits.
Outfield Shift Looms
Collins also was in good form on
the trip although he was hit frequent
ly in the U.S.C. game.
Sypher works well with both pitch
ers and with the rest of the team. His
playing is steady and experienced.
A shift in the outfield lineup is ex
pected within a day or two. Wolter
will probably work Bill Clark into the
lineup, and possibly Bob Sims.
Batting practice will occupy a large
part of the team's attention in the
short time remaining.
