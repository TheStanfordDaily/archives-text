## 
### 
Byzantine art is fully described in
a heavy tome, once the property of a
favorite of the Russian Czar Alexander
111, now lies in one of the show cases
outside the Hoover War library. The
book is No. 182 in an edition of 200
copies that was privately printed in
1892 for the Czar, and which that mon
arch presented to his most favored
subjects and to members of the im
perial family. The book in the posses
sion of the Hoover library was given
to Ivan Goremykin, reactionary prime
minister of Alexander.
The book is about three inches
thick, eight wide, and fourteen high.
It is bound in tough white leather,
heavily embossed and elaborately
carved in gilt, with black figuring. The
cover is about a quarter of an inch
thick.

Beside the book, which is uuopened
as yet so that the decorative cover
may be seen, lies the bookmark, a
heavy piece of brocaded silk, with a
monogram at the top, a motto in Rus
sian, and the date, 1892. It is attached
to the book by a golden cord.
The book came to the library
wrapped in another piece of brocade
of many colors, but with a predomi
nance of a brownish-red hue. This
bears near one edge a monogram-like
set of characters that are recognizable
as Russian letters. None of the letter
ing on any of these things has been
deciphered or translated by the li
brary.
The librarian of the Hoover collec
tion says that this book is probably
the only copy of this edition in the
United States.
