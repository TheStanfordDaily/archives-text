# CHAPARRAL PREPARES FOR BIG MEET ISSUE; DESIRES MATERIAL
## Editors Select Freshman Contributions for April Number 
### 
With the beginning of the new quar
ter the Chaparral is out searching for
better and funnier material. The Big
Meet and the Big Game issues are the
two largest and most widely-read of
the Chappie publications of the year.
The Big Meet issue is the next which
will appear, and will be distributed
the Friday before the meet with Cali
fornia.
Since there are but three members
left this year Chappie hopes to receive
a deluge of literary and art contribu
tions for them. "Spring has came"
jokes and all the rest of the spring
hokum offers a large field for joke
jotters. Wise cracks for the track issue
should run something about the two
miler's breath coming in short pants
or some other such trite tripe.
Chaparral and Pelican, California's
comic publication, have arranged to
make an exchange whereby the Big
Meet issue of Chappie will be scld on
the Berkeley campus. This, together
with the fact that the issue will be
sold in Palo Alto and on the campus
the day of the meet will insure a wide
ly-sold and hence a widely-read num
ber.
Freshman contributors are wanted
particularly by the magazine for very
lew of the '29 students have been
turning in copy. The editors want to
know how the members of the class
are ever going to put in an editor if
they don't send in ,copy.
Like the Big Game issue, this one
will not run to any particular type of
jokes, except that track jokes will be
the favorites. So anything in the way
of art or comically literary or literally
comic material will be given a fair
chance to adorn the pages of the Big
Meet Chaparral.
The issue will be considerably larger
than usual, and the editors hope, much
better. Ambitious artists or writers,
who desire to see their names in the
book should get in touch with the
Chappie office.
