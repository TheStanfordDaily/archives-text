### 
An anonymous donation of useful
textbooks has just been received by
the Appointment Office. Nearly fifty
books which had been abandoned by
students leaving Branner hall last
quarter arrived at the office the first
part of this week. These books will be
added to the collection of free text
books furnished for the use of self
supporting students.
