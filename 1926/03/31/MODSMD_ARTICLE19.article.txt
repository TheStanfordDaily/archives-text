# SEVENTY TURN OUT FOR INITIAL SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## MORE MATERIAL DESIRED Warner Seeks Backs to Fill Shoes of Ernie Nevers, Raffetto, Mitchell 
### 
More than seventy men reported to
Coach Pop Warner for spring football
practice yesterday afternoon on the
freshman field, and about the same
number put in an appearance at the
initial workout Monday. Warner, as
sisted by Andy Kerr and Tiny Thorn
hill, gave the squad a plentiful dose
of charging, blocking, tackling, clip
ping, and signal drill, after he had put
them through setting-up exercises. As
the practice sessions will last only five
weeks, he intends to waste no time in
getting down to business.
Members of the 1925 varsity squad
who were out. in suits yesterday in
clude: Captain Swan, Bogue, Walker,
Patc.hett, Natcher, Murphy, Moore,
McCreery, Trombetta, Eli Post, and
Everett.
Backfield Is Problem
Six teams were selected to run off
plays. Warner is doing a good deal of
shifting In order to find men to plug
up the gaps left by Nevers at full,
Mitchell and Solomon at quarter, and
Raffetto at tackle. The latter was dis
qualified from registration this quar
ter by the scholarship committee, and
cannot return until next spring.
Linesmen have been transferred to
the backfield in an effort to find a
satisfactory combination. Both Walker
and Moore, ends, are prospective
backs; the change leaves a hole at
| right end. Eli Post is working out at
quarter, and looks good, but will have
! to step to beat out Moore and Walker.
' Bogue, Patchett, Young, Smalling,
Moore, and Walker, are all being tried
jat full. Although they were not out
! yesterday, Robesky and Seraphim Post
| will be chief contenders for Raffetto's
| tackle berth.
Every man who wishes to make a
good showing in the fall and who is
not in training for either baseball or
track, should be out for spring prac
tice, Warner states. Other coast uni
i versities are drilling grid squads now,
and most of them have a longer
j period of time to devote to workouts
, than has Stanford.
