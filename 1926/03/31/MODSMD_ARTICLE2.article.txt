# FRESHMAN DIAMOND TEAM ROUNDS INTO SHAPE FOR CAL GAME
## 
### 
Handicapped by lack of practice
during vacation, Husky Hunt's fresh
man charges will encounter the Bruin
Cubs next Saturday following the Stan
ford-U.S.C. track meet, in the first
game of the annual baseball series.
The game will be played 011 the var
sity field.
As no vacation trip was scheduled
this year for the 1929 ballplayers, the
squad has not practiced since the Sat
urday before finals, and is just get
ting back into shape. Hunt, however,
is optimistic over the Card's chances
to repeat their victories of last year,'
when the babes won the first game by
a 10-4 score.
In preliminary games, San Francisco
Polytechnical High and the U.C. Den
tal College, both strong teams, are!
among the squads defeated by the j
freshmen. Alameda and Berkeley high
schools are the only teams which have
turned in wins over the babes.
Hartley is the foremost candidate
for second, and is Hunt's lead-off man.
He is a good hitter and plays a fast
game in the field. McCandless on first,
Rogers at short, and Price at third
complete the infield, with Brown, a
good hitter, as catcher. Three sluggers
form the present freshman outfield,
McKey, Wilton, and Davis. Kern and
Lewis are both good pitchers and will
probably alternate in the California
aeries.
