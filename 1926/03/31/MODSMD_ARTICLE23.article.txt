# Daily Palo Alto Tryouts
## 
### 
Spring tryouts for the editorial staff of the Daily Palo Alto begin
tomorrow afternoon at 12 :50 o'clock in the Press Building. A numlxjr of
positions are unfilled and will be given to the freshmen or sophomores who
do the best work during the trial period of one week.
Work on the Daily staff has proven for years to l>e one of the most
enjoyable and profitable activities in the University. With a little spare
time and ordinary creative ability, the average underclassman may soon
rise to the position of Desk Editor or a more responsible office. Op
portunities are unlimited for making acquaintances among the student and
faculty personnel and no activity gives a better chance to learn the inner
workings of the administration and University.
For two years the reporter comes into daily contact with prominent
men in every other activity on the campus, with faculty members, and with
visiting notables. He keeps in constant touch with local affairs and un
consciously becomes a storehouse of University information which will
be invaluable to him. At the same time he is engaged in an avocation
which has all the possibilities of turning into "laboratory work" for a vo
cation in later life. '
