# At Work Again

With the coming of spring and hot weather, Coach "Pop" Warner ap
pears for the fourth time in charge of spring football practice. A quartet
of years ago. Pop brought joy to the hearts of Stanford alumni, long in
the clutches of the Depression of Continued Defeat, by consenting to
head the Cardinal football coaching staff. Several months ago he was
largely responsible for what was termed the "New Stanford Era" by de
feating California—and the Old Grads smiled again.
Now, half a year later, he begins again and in earnest to point a Cardi
nal squad for another Blue and Gold downfall. Five years ago the opto
mist who dared predict in the spring a Stanford victory for the coming
fall was given a piece of crepe and directed to the nearest hospital. Today,
after looking over the spring-practice material and Warner's record one
can safely lay his hopes on Stanford without receiving the wondering
stares of the multitude about him.
Such confidence in Warner is not felt alone by the layman, however.
When most of the inexperienced applicants working under Warner for
five solid weeks believe in him explicitly and are almost certain he will
make All-Americans of them before the year is over, one feels Stanford
is indeed fortunate in its possession of such a man.
