The life-time earnings of the average college graduate are $150,000;
the high school graduate earns $78,000; and the average unskilled laborer
$33,000, according to th estimates recently made by Dean Lord of the
Business School of Boston University. The statistician also declared that
the unskilled workman reaches his greatest efficiency at 30 years, of age
while the college graduate receives his maximum wage between 50 and 60
years old. These figures are interesting, to say the least. We wish they
might be more binding on the individual, but they would seem to furnish
conclusive evidence to a certain class of people that a college education was
valuable after all.—Cornell Daily Sun.
