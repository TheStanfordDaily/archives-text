AND WHY?
Now that the sap is flowing and it's more or less stopped snowing,
A great supernal urge is come to unto me.
The sight of lambkins gamboling sets my unused thoughts to rambling,
My great unholy passion will undo me.
My heart is up and yearning and my gizzard in me burning
When the call of spring is yodelled from afar —
I scheme with machinations and am sick with perturbations;
But how the heck am I to get a car?

Prof. Bowie Leathers, the eminent authority on early Swedish pogroms
and folk-songs, has finished writing an epoch-making book. Entitled
"A Guide for Harassed Professors" it is a compilation of standard prelim
questions, and will undoubtedly prove a great boon to distracted dispensers
of learning who are forced to emanate learned prelim questions at
irregular intervals, with consequent racking of brains and scratching of
heads. The book is nicely divided into colleges, with the prelims for each
college prettily printed in a diffeernt color ink. Here are a few xamples,
illustrating the ability of the questions to irritate students as much as
anything in times past:
For the Engineering School: An I-beam, 96 feet long, has a weight
on it of 7,583 h.p. lb. at one end, and an isometric water-meter with a red
intake manifold and poop-deck at the other. How old is your grandmother?
Draw a picture of the water-meter. What the devil is the thing you think
you're drawing?
For the Biol. School: How many cows did you kill yesterday? If you
had a hen which laid round eggs, how would you fix it to lay obtuse eggs?
How many cows did you kill day before yesterday?
For the Arts School: Show why the renaissance renaissed. Give a
concise account of the history of the Aaland Islands, and tell in detail
if Penelope ever eloped with Agammemon. She did, did she? She did
not. What makes you so awfully smooth?
For the Law School: Suppose you are a great lawyer, in flagrante
delcito, and a widow lady placed a great sum of money in your hands.
Would you skip out for South America? Well, why not? What color
is a tort in the daytime?
For the Arch. School: Draw a mausoleum, with a kitty-corner catacomb
in it. When does the Beaux-Arts Ball come off?

AND WHY?
Now that the sap is flowing and it's more or less stopped snowing,
A great supernal urge is come to unto me.
The sight of lambkins gamboling sets my unused thoughts to rambling,
My great unholy passion will undo me.
My heart is up and yearning and my gizzard in me burning
When the call of spring is yodelled from afar —
I scheme with machinations and am sick with perturbations;
But how the heck am I to get a car?

Prof. Bowie Leathers, the eminent authority on early Swedish pogroms
and folk-songs, has finished writing an epoch-making book. Entitled
"A Guide for Harassed Professors" it is a compilation of standard prelim
questions, and will undoubtedly prove a great boon to distracted dispensers
of learning who are forced to emanate learned prelim questions at
irregular intervals, with consequent racking of brains and scratching of
heads. The book is nicely divided into colleges, with the prelims for each
college prettily printed in a diffeernt color ink. Here are a few xamples,
illustrating the ability of the questions to irritate students as much as
anything in times past:
For the Engineering School: An I-beam, 96 feet long, has a weight
on it of 7,583 h.p. lb. at one end, and an isometric water-meter with a red
intake manifold and poop-deck at the other. How old is your grandmother?
Draw a picture of the water-meter. What the devil is the thing you think
you're drawing?
For the Biol. School: How many cows did you kill yesterday? If you
had a hen which laid round eggs, how would you fix it to lay obtuse eggs?
How many cows did you kill day before yesterday?
For the Arts School: Show why the renaissance renaissed. Give a
concise account of the history of the Aaland Islands, and tell in detail
if Penelope ever eloped with Agammemon. She did, did she? She did
not. What makes you so awfully smooth?
For the Law School: Suppose you are a great lawyer, in flagrante
delcito, and a widow lady placed a great sum of money in your hands.
Would you skip out for South America? Well, why not? What color
is a tort in the daytime?
For the Arch. School: Draw a mausoleum, with a kitty-corner catacomb
in it. When does the Beaux-Arts Ball come off?
