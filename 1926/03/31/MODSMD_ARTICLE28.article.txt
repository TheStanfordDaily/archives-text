"The Sea Beast," with John Barry
more—lt would be easy to point out
that there were many unconvincing
things in this picture: that the big fish
was too obviously imitation, that the
ship was still more apparently a model
and wallowed about in the model sea
at impossible angles, and that at any I
rate is is physiologically impossible J
for a whale to bite a man's leg oft' as j
these huge amphibians have a mastica-'
tory apparatus which only allows them j
to filter the water they drink in search
of fish and such small fry and not to j
indulge in the practices of man-eating i
sharks and Florida barracudas. (See !
Encyclopedia Brit, under "whales.") !
This would be missing the whole \
point of the production, however. In I
the emotional reactions of the charac-1
ters to what happened rather than in ;
the adventures themselves lies the in- '
terest of the story. From this stand
point it is a great picture, full of all
sorts of heart throbs, human interest, j
and "lots of love story." Barrymore as
usual makes the tribe of slick-haired i
male screen favorites seem as though i
they were suffering from facial para-1
lysis. He can act and can use makeup
to good effect, and he does both here, j
Regarding the makeup, however, it 1
seems a little too much strain 011 the j
credulity to suppose that, after being !
such an absolute loss as far as looks j
go while 011 his crazed pursuit of the j
I great white whale, he could afterwards
recover his original beauty to the ex
tent that he did.
It is worthy of note that the "Sea ,
Beast" has attempted, and in our opin
ion achieved, something new in '
movies. To-wit: it is intensely realis
tic, almost horribly so (one can almost
get the stench of burning flesh in
those two terrible scenes) and yet it
is also romantic and even lyrical in
the feeling of its love story. American
pictures have fore the most part run j
to one extreme or the other. Either !
they were almost purely romantic a la ;
Douglas Fairbanks, as purely spectacu
lar a la De Mille and others —but,, out- ;
side of this one there isn't any out-1
standing example of a realistic Ameri-!
can movie. Besides these there are the
great majority which are purely
hokum.
The method of "The Sea Beast" will
probably not be widely imitated, how- j
ever; the public doesn't like its real-j
ism straight. —H.A.K. j
