# FAIRIES EXIST IN IRELAND CLAIMS WOMAN LECTURER
## 
### 
Fairyland and fairies were explained
in detail by Miss Ella Young, Irish
poetess, who lectured last night in the
Little Theatre on "Gaelic Ireland and
the Story-Tellers."
Ireland is still in the Golden Age
and numerous inhabitants of the island
say that they have seen fairies. Living
close to nature the Gaelic-speaking
people believe they are in touch with
the magic ethereal world of fairies and
spirits.
Miss Young describes fairies as be
ing made of some intangible sub
stance. There are many different types
of fairies including the little ones
which are about three inches in height
and seem to be made of light. They
have wings like butterflies. In addi
tion to these small fairies which are
found in flowers, there are others
called "sidhe" which are as large as
humans. These larger ethereal beings
radiate light similar in shape to an
Indian chief's headdress. Great spirits
are also seen in lakes.
Some of the "sidhe" are said to ride
on horses which go over the sea as
well as on land. Many of the inhabit
ants of Ireland tell about magic horses
which live in lakes and are seen fre
quently.
In speaking of fairy music, Miss
Young declared that it is present in
any country that is enchanted. It may

be found in deserts and in sand dunes,
according to her. Fairies can be heard
playing on every kind of musical in
strument, talking in silvery tones and
singing.
"I think that many people hear it,"
said the poetess. "In order to hear the
fairy music, it is necessary that people
be in beautiful places, in harmony, and
in touch with nature."
Miss Young described a fairy known
as the "pooka" which is capable of
transforming itself into different
shapes. It takes the forms of a horse,
a stag, a little goat, and a man, and is
extremely playful, always playing
tricks on humans.
The Atlantic ocean appears as a
magical sea to the Irish, and many
persons relate stories of enchanted
islands which come up from its depths.
On these islands are trees and palaces,
and the islands are always green. The
people believe that if a bit of fire or
even ashes is put on the islands, they
will not sink.
Story-telling is a profession in Ire
land. Among the ancients the leading
poet ranked next to the chief king and
was expected to know a great number
of stories.
Many of the story-tellers in Ireland
today can recite long poems and tales
in Old Irish. This folk-lore has been
handed down to them in the old
language for many generations.
