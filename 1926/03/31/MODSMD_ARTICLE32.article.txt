being shown at the Art Gallery, The
wool and cotton used is raised, home-1
dyed, home-spun, and hand-woven by
the Indians.
"Huipels" or "wepils," some of j
which are shown, are gay rectangles of ;
tapestry which are the waist garments
worn by all of the Guatemala Indians. I
The different designs often indicate i
the different tribes. The native dyes
are indigo blue, cochineal red, rye \
wood, or chincona yellow, although
Chinese dyes have been in vogue for
centuries.
"Huipels" Are Garments
The "huipels" are complete bits of
weaving, each rectangular piece hav- !
ing a finished edge. They are limited (
by the size of the loom, and most of j
the garments are woven in two pieces. |
They are then sewed up the middle of
the front, and again under the arms, j
thereby allowing spaces through which I
the arms and head may pass.
The Guatemala Indians are small,
and quite Asiatic in build. The women
share in every way the worlt of the
men. The costume worn is generally !
white, the only note of color being the J
bright sashes and blankets which form
a contrast with the otherwise colorless |
garments.
Besides the "huipels" or waists, the j
collection contains blankets, bags, i
belts, hair decorations, and basket
covers. Woven cloth is even used in-1
stead of paper, for wrapping packages.
