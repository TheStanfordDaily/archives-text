# TEMPERAMENT, NOT DOPE, TO COUNT IN U.S.C. TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Los Angeles, March 30.â€”Temperament
and not dope will win the annual Stan
ford-Southern California track meet in
Palo Alto this Saturday, according to
Coach Dean Cromwell. His opinion is
seconded by every member of the Trojan
squad and the entire southland.
The dope bucket may be chuck full of
reasons why Stanford should win hut tliat
unstable material does not take into con
sideration the team spirit and fight which
accompanies each meet. The University
of Southern California lias gone into
plenty of affairs in the past doped to win
and temperament lias won a victory for
the Southerners.
Dean Cromwell has one of the most
temperamental outfits in the country. In
practice meets and against set-ups the
men fail to come through but after a fight
talk and before such an opponent as the
Cardinals of Stanford the Trojans will
produce as experts have never doped them
to do. This is what Cromwell says. It
was just such a spirit that carried U.S.C.
to an I.C. 4A cliampionship last year when
the Trojans had not been conceded an
outside chance before the affair.
"Dink" Templeton says his cohorts will
win 75 to 56. On paper they should do so
but romwell says he doubts if they will.
Coverly and Gaspar are rated one, two
in the 100 by scribes. Yet the Trojan
fans believe Ed House and Herschel
Smith will come in first and second in
both that race and the 220. In the latter
event the Cards will have to do some
mighty running to beat out Johnny Par
sons, the most fiery-tempered runner on
the Coast.
There is little more than a hope for the
Trojans in the 440. When Miller and
Storie did 48.8 against the L.A.A.C. last
week they cinched that event in the Tro
jan meet. Bruce Smith and Charles
Sauers will fight for a third. Richardson
will undoubtedly take the 880 for Stan
ford but Miller will never beat Niersbach
to second, U.S.C. men feel.
Bill Kerr ranks next to Schwobeda of
California in the mile but he can't win
both the mile and two-mile, so the South
land believes. He may even have a hard
time winning either with Shawhan in the
mile and Heilman in the longer race. Dye
and Grumbles will win the high and low
hurdles respectively, barring accidents.
U.S.C. may not get any other points here. |
The pole vault will go to Barnes. The j
high jump is still a toss-up. The broad |
jump is Stanford's, but a surprise may be I
staged. The Cards will take the javelin'
easily, but Captain Bud Houser is un-j
beatable in the weights. The relay will j
go to Stanford.
