# SPORTS OF 1926
## Germans in Sports 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Following only a fortnight on the heels of the French
tennis victory in the United States national indoor tourna
ment, and coming, as it did, right at the time that the
League of Nations was all up in the air over Germany's
proposed membership in its Council, the sport triumphs of
the two Germans, Hagenlacher and Rademacher, were most
interesting. The two Teutonic Erics, the billiard player
and the back-stroke swimmer, are both real champions,
and each one is well able to represent the Fatherland in
competition in foreign climes on the green baize and in
the tank or pool
There has naturally been a paucity of athletes from the
country of the Rhine in the last ten years, but at last
sportsmanship has broken down the barriers raised by the
Great War and the best talent of the new republic may be
expected to show in America from time to time.

I remember the highly exciting time during the Davis Cup matches in 1914 j
when the air was charged with friction between the Anzacs and the Rhineland \
players just before the declaration of hostilities. Those hot July days saw
the semi-final round contested by Brookes and Wilding, of Australasia, and j
Kreuzer and Froitzheim, of Germany. Australasia won every match, and soon |
the quartet went to play a far sterner game, and Tony Wilding, at least, was j
killed in action.
Hans Steinkc, the huge wrestler, was probably the first athlete from the j
Fatherland to invade America after the Armistice. He is one of the "ponder-;
ous pachyderms" who belongs to the Jack Curley troupe, and has exhibited I
his strength and knowledge of the game on mats throughout the country.
The brief invasion by Huber Houben, the sprinter, was most successful â€” i
from an American point of view. As Loren Murchison said, it looks as though
"the Dutchman can win only when he has his own starter."
Other athletes of German parentage that come to mind are Heinie Groli
and Heinie Zimmerman, of baseball fame; George von Elm and Karl Behr, in
golf and tennis; and "Brick" Muller, in football. Paul Berlenbach, light
heavyweight champion, is of French-German stock. And there are and have
been many other fine men in sports from the land of steins, dadschunds, and >
pretzels.
