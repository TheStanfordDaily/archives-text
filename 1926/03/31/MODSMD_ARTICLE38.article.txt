# FROSTED WINDOWS IN TOYON TURNED INTO "ART" PANELS
## 
### 
A new chapter in collegiate
decoration has been discovered
by the students living in Toyon
hall. The square frosted windows
of the doors have been converted
into various things. One is a
stained gothic window of many
colors bearing the coat of arms
and patron saints of the room
mates, another becomes a jail cell
by the application of some India
ink in the hands of an amateur
artist who has added to the real
ism by placing a prisoner behind
the bars.
The shower room is definitely
designated by a swimmer amid
numerous waves all depicted with
artistic touches on the snowy
white glass. On down the hall
one finds a rural scene with trees
pictured, and still farther a win
dow becomes the impressive of
fice door with the firm name in
bold letters. Beneath the letters
one is greeted by the interesting
advice "private," which is imme
diately contradicted by a second
sign, "walk in." The visitor iti left
to choose for himself. The mem
bers of the firm from president to
cashier are listed inauspiciously
in the corner.
