# DR. BAILEY WILLIS WRITES OF SANTA BARBARA DISASTER
## First-Hand Observations Are Related by Stanford Professor Emeritus 
### 
The complete story of the disastrous
Santa Barbara earthquake which occurred
on June 29, 1925, is graphically given in
the December number of the Bulletin of
the Seismological Society of America, to
which Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emeri
tus of geology of Stanford, and president
of the Seismological Society of America,
has contributed two articles. Dr. Willis
was at Santa Barbara during the first
shocks and immediately made observa
tions as to their nature.
Articles in this issue include a descrip
tion of the damage done to the historic
Santa Barbara mission, written by the
Reverend Hobrecht; a study of the earth
quake by Bailey Willis; and several ar
ticles on the building situation in the town
itself before and after the shock. This
publictaion is of extreme interest as his
torical matter, since all the articles in this
issue are by men trained in accurate ob
servation and in reporting natural phe
nomena. Most of these men were in
Santa Barbara at the time of the quake,
and thus have been able to write their
findings from actual observation on the
ground during the shocks.
The article by Dr. Willis gives the set
ting of the disaster, the previous shocks
recorded in that region, the actual event,
a theory offered in explanation of the
shock, and a short discussion of the pos
sibility of future quakes. Dr. Willis de
scribes the event as follows:
Sounds Like Train
"The writer was at the Hotel Miramar,
four and one-half miles east of Santa
Barbara. Lying awake, he heard, as it
seemed, a train approaching along the
Southern Pacific tracks from the east, ex
perienced such rapid vibrations as are pro
duced by a train close at liand, and then
felt the sharp jolt of the advancing wave
of an earthquake. It came from the west.
He was thrown sidewise in that direction.
Recognizing the meaning of the shock, he
noted the approximate time (6:44 a.m.)
and began to count seconds. He liad!
reached fifteen when the movement'
stopped. In the meantime the bed was:
rotating in an anti-clockwise direction \
with sufficient energy to cause him to put I
out his hand to steady himself." During j
nineteen minutes, Dr. Willis noted six:
further shocks. The effect on the frame!
building was not noticeable except that
the nails pulled in and out as it swayed!
after the first shock. All the chimneys!
were thrown down.
Several further observations follow,
with which information Dr. Willis was I

able to determine the direction of the
shock to be first from the southwest, and
then from the north, both shocks occur
ring in a short period of time.
'J he theory which is presented is in
brief that pressures exerted upon blocks
many miles across caused them to slip 011
one another and tliat this sudden slip
page was the cause of the shocks. In the
section he entitles "Looking Ahead," Dr.
Willis takes up several methods of pre
vention of damage by earthquakes. It
also includes a short survey of the possi
bility of future temblors. In concluding,
Dr. Willis states:
Forecasts Only Vague
"It is sometimes assumed that seis
mologists can predict earthquakes, but the
fact is that they have not sufficient infor
mation to justify anything more than a
very vague forecast. Again it is said that
it is better to remain ignorant of the im
pending danger rather than to be fright
ened to death while living in uncertainty
pf its imminence. Certainly if anyone
could predict an earthquake it would be
unwise to publish the forecast in a man
ner to create general anxiety, but knowl
edge is power. If it had been known defi
nitely that Santa Barbara was in danger it

would have been possible to take reason
able precautions. The city authorities, if
persuaded of the situation would sooner
have adopted a building code that would
have prevented the erection of those struc
tures in which there was not only great
loss of property but also of life. We need
preparation against these dangers, and a
better knowledge of their remoteness or
their imminence is essential to our wel
fare."
He concludes with a suggestion for the
installation of seismometric stations for
the purpose of keeping track of the varia
tions in strain and elastic state of the
earth, a series of stations which will be
as universal as the weather bureau sta
tions.
