the various sources of documentation
and meet the influencial men actively
engaged in solving those problems.
Furthermore, the Conference in order
to make the instructors' teachings and
writings more authoritative will en
deavor to help them keep in touch
with the international co-operative
movements.
Among the various international or
ganizations which the members will
be required to visit are the European
headquarters of the Carnegie Endow
ment for International Peace at Paris,
the Permanent Court of International
Justice and of Arbitration at The
Hague, and the League of Nations at
Geneva. The trip will last from July
28 to September 20.
About two years ago Professor Stu
i art was sent under the auspices of the
Carnegie Institute of Washington to
Peru where he made an extensive
study of the political conditions of
that country. His book, "The Govern
mental System of Peru," contains the
data collected while on the trip.
Prior to making the trip Professor
Stuart will teach at the University of
