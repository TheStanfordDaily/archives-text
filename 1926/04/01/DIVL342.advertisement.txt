THE SPRING IDEA IN IDE SHIRTS
Here's the dope: Patterns are lively; fancy stripes and plain being
featured. Plain white is right for Easter—or what have you? Blue
and white combinations mighty popular. I have the largest stock of
Ide shirts in Palo Alto. Prices range from $1.70 to $4.05.
Drope in when you haven't anything else to do.
