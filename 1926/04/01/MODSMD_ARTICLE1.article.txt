# CARD RUNNERS DUE TO TAKE HONORS IN MEET WITH U. S. C.
## Coach Templeton Optimistic Of Stanford Win Over Strong Southerners 
### Joe Carroll 
According to Coach Dink Temple
ton, Stanford's varsity squad is due
to run away wilth the honors Satur
day afternoon when it meets the ath
letes from the University of Southern
California in track and field events at
the stadium. Coach Templeton says,
â– "I think we'll win," and then proceeds
to give the reasons why.
Coverley should place second in
both the century and the furlong, with
Caspar having a slight chance to slip
in for a point or two in either one of
the sprints. Both of these races are
going to be pretty ones to watch.
Miller and Storie will finish one, two
in the quarter, and McGuire may sneak
into third to shut the Southerners out
entirely.
Richardson Best in Half
Captain Richardson is scheduled to
win the half-mile. If Niersbach of
U.S.C. lives up to advance notices, he
may push Richardson to a record. The
fight for third is going to be a real
struggle. Babcock may come through
to take this place.
Bill Kerr is Coach Templeton's
choice to win both the mile and the
two-mile. He is sure to bring five
points home in the mile, but he may
be so tired after the race that he will
have to content himself with second
honors in the longer journey. Ranney
and Nelson in the mile, and Criley,
Swayne, and otherfc in the eight-lap
event, may also break into the point
column, and every tally will count
heavily, with the possibility in pros
pect of having the relay decide the
meet. If this comes to pass, the Cardi
nals will win, as the quartet of run
ners who will make up the team are
all capable of doing less than 50 flat
in the quarter-mile.
Hurdles Close
The hurdles are going to be close,
with West of Stanford expected to
place second to Dye in the highs and
in the same position after Grumbles
in the low sticks. Both of these men
from the South are finished hurdlers
and will probably win their races, but
West should take second, and Spencer
may also be counted on for a third in
both of these contests.
Captain Bud Houser will win the \
shot and the discus, but Biff Hoffman |
is counted on to supply three points j
in both of these events. One of the j
Southerners will probably snatch the
third place in the shot, but Evans, it
is believed, will come through with a
heave that will give Stanford the
points for third in the discus.
Work of Stanford should win the
high jump, but second and third places
will probably be divided among the
following men: Muhs and King of
Stanford, and Coggeshall and Ross of
U. S. C.
Meeks, Reynolds Duel
Meeks has leaped far enough in com
petition to win the broad jump, with
Reynolds of U.S.C. second and Mac- j
Rae of Stanford third. To offset these j
points Lee Barnes of the American j
Olympic team will pole vault his way j
to a win in this event. Stanford will;
have to be satisfied with a third here,
as the Southern vaulters have been
consistently beating the Redshirts'
best heights.
Harlow and Shipkey of Stanford will i
fight for first place in the javelin, with
the former having an edge in the hurl !
ing of the spear. U.S.C., however, will
rope in the extra point.
