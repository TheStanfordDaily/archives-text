# CHRONOGRAPH ADDED TO EQUIPMENT USED BY ORDNANCE UNIT
## Instrument Measures Muzzle Velocity of Bullets; Made by Belgian 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Among the interesting pieces of
; equipment utilized by the Ordnance
department in its work at Stanford is
j the apparatus for the measurement of
: muzzle velocity of projectiles. The
I instrument, the Bouleng6 chronograph
which has been perfected by a captain
; of the Belgian artillery, consists in a
mechanism through which an accurate
measurement of the time of passage
of the projectile through two screens
can be determined. It has been in use
i several years by the army ordnance
: unit.
| During the fall quarter of next year
this instrument will be set up and put
1 in practical use for the measurement
| of the velocity of rifle bullets. In order
to utilize this apparatus, the depart
ment has ordered a steel plate, which
j is to stop the bullets fired.
The chronograph is basically an in
strument which consists of two electro
! magnets which support two metal
| rods, called the chronometer and the
j recorder. The chronometer, which is
| the longer, is mad 0 of steel, and is
| put in a sheath of copper tubing. The
| recorder is shorter, and is released in
! such a fashion that the time of falling
| is marked on the chronometer by a
\ knife which strikes the copper tube,
j The electromagnets are connected
ieach to a screen. The screens are set
a known distance apart and form part
of an electrical circuit with the mag
j nets. When the first screen is broken
by the pasage of the projectile, the
' circuit is broken, and the magnet re
j leases the chronometer bar, which
; falls. The second screen is in circuit
! with the recorder, and releases this
| bar when the circuit is broken. At the
; end of the fall of the second bar, a
j knife is tripped which marks a point
; on the falling chronometer. By a ver
nier scale which is attachable to the
chronometer, after the necessary
marks have been made, the distance
fallen is measured. Knowing the time
taken for the fall, and the distance
between the two screens, by computa
tion, the velocity of the projectile can
be measured accurately.
Actual use of this interesting instru
ment will be taken up under the ord
nance department work next quarter.
The unit is open to chemistry and en
gineering students, and qualifies grad
uates in it for a position as second
lieutenant of ordnance in the Ordnance
Reserve. The unit of Stanford is com
paratively new, having been instituted
I last fall by Captain Frank Atwood,
! who is in charge of the work.

Actual use of this interesting instru
ment will be taken up under the ord
nance department work next quarter.
The unit is open to chemistry and en
gineering students, and qualifies grad
uates in it for a position as second
lieutenant of ordnance in the Ordnance
Reserve. The unit of Stanford is com
paratively new, having been instituted
I last fall by Captain Frank Atwood,
! who is in charge of the work.
Among the interesting pieces of
; equipment utilized by the Ordnance
department in its work at Stanford is
j the apparatus for the measurement of
: muzzle velocity of projectiles. The
I instrument, the Bouleng6 chronograph
which has been perfected by a captain
; of the Belgian artillery, consists in a
mechanism through which an accurate
measurement of the time of passage
of the projectile through two screens
can be determined. It has been in use
i several years by the army ordnance
: unit.
| During the fall quarter of next year
this instrument will be set up and put
1 in practical use for the measurement
| of the velocity of rifle bullets. In order
to utilize this apparatus, the depart
ment has ordered a steel plate, which
j is to stop the bullets fired.
The chronograph is basically an in
strument which consists of two electro
! magnets which support two metal
| rods, called the chronometer and the
j recorder. The chronometer, which is
| the longer, is mad 0 of steel, and is
| put in a sheath of copper tubing. The
| recorder is shorter, and is released in
! such a fashion that the time of falling
| is marked on the chronometer by a
\ knife which strikes the copper tube,
j The electromagnets are connected
ieach to a screen. The screens are set
a known distance apart and form part
of an electrical circuit with the mag
j nets. When the first screen is broken
by the pasage of the projectile, the
' circuit is broken, and the magnet re
j leases the chronometer bar, which
; falls. The second screen is in circuit
! with the recorder, and releases this
| bar when the circuit is broken. At the
; end of the fall of the second bar, a
j knife is tripped which marks a point
; on the falling chronometer. By a ver
nier scale which is attachable to the
chronometer, after the necessary
marks have been made, the distance
fallen is measured. Knowing the time
taken for the fall, and the distance
between the two screens, by computa
tion, the velocity of the projectile can
be measured accurately.

ment will be taken up under the ord
nance department work next quarter.
