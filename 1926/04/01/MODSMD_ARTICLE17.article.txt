About tlnrty prospective journalists
met in the Press building this
afternoon to receive their first assign
ments on tryout work for the Daily
Palo Alto editorial staff. Students who
overlooked the first day's meeting will
still be given a chance to try out to
morrow. Meetings will be held at the
same time every noon hour.
Starting with today's assignment,
the new workers will continue with
the Daily for one week, writing both
news and features. A large field is
open on the campus for the feature
department of newspaper work, and
gives the writer who desires to write
features an excellent opportunity to
obtain good material and also to gain
experience on the Daily that will be
of great value to him.
It is more desirable, both to the try
outee and to the Daily, that any addi
tions to the staff be underclassmen,
preferably freshmen, because the in
dividual will have more of a chance to
climb on the staff, and the paper will
get more value from having the mem
ber for several years instead of for
several months only. Students who
have tried out for the staff before and
failed may try out at this time.
Any of those who desire to try out
may see the editor at the office, as
well as attend the meeting tomorrow
noon.
