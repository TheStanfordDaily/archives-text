# LARGE CAST WILL GIVE ORATORIO IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## Notable Singers Secured for Solos in "Stabat Mater" Tomorrow Night 
### 
About 150 people will participate in
the presentation of the oratorio,
"Stahat Mater," In the Memorialj
Church tomorrow night at 8 o'clock. A
chorus of one hundred male and fe
male voices has been training under
Director Warren D. Allen since the j
beginning ol' last quarter.
Forty musicians, members of the!
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,;
have been engaged to play the instru- {
mental accompaniment, which is con-;
sidered as one of the most beautiful!
features. Every instrument called for i
in the score will play so that no "filling;
in" by the organ will be necessary.
A notable group of singers will ren- j
der the solos upon which much of the !
grandeur of the work depends. The |
soloists are Mrs. Flora Howell Bru- j
neer, soprano; Mrs. Anna K. Blotcky, i
contralto; Gwynfi Jones, tenor; Victor:
Vogel, bass. Wallace Rolls will be at;
the organ.
Other oratorios have been written
around the "Stabat Mater," which is ;
one of the five great medieval hymns j
of the Catholic Church, but this one,!
the version of Anton Dvorak, the noted
Bohemian composer, is considered best j
for sincerity, depth, and inspiration.
An English critic wrote, soon after |
its first performance, "The work is
not only admirable as regards melody,
harmony, and orchestration, but is a j
revelation of creative genius. Of the j
many musical settings of "Stabat
Mater," there is none which so admir-;
ably combines musical enjoyment with
devotional sentiment."
The ten sections into which the
work is divided correspond to the ten
verses of the Latin hymn. An orches- j
tral introduction at the beginning in- j
troduces the main melodies to be
heard later in the work. The quartet
and chorus then open the hymn de
scribing the anguish of Mary at the
foot of the cross.
