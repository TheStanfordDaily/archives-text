# VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM MEETS BEARS IN. FIRST CONTEST
## Sophomores Form Majority Of Team; Six Out of Nine Are '28 Men 
### Herb Klein 
Baseball prospects took another drop
yesterday afternoon. Following a meet
ing of the scholarship committee it
was learned that Chuck Johnston, first
baseman, will be ineligible for the rest
of the season, contrary to reports
made early yesterday.
The class of 1928 will be much in
evidence Saturday afternoon when
Harry Wolter's varsity baseball play
ers meet California at West Field in
Berkeley immediately after the track
meet between California and Missouri.
At least six out of the nine Stanford
players will be members of last year's
freshman squad, a unique situation in
the history of Stanford. Captain Cud
deback on third and Paddy Draper on
first may be the only upperclassmen
on the nine. This does not mean that
Wolter has in any way a green or in
experienced lineup. The freshman
team last year was exceptional in both
individual playing and teamwork. The
men have had to earn their places
against stiff competition this Beason.
Sobieski, Sypher Battery
Bill Clark and Tex Weaver will
start in the outfield. The third fielder
has not yet been finally selected.
Sobieski and Sypher, the varsity's best
battery combination, will endeavor to
shut out the Blue and Gold swatters.
News from Berkeley indicates that
Coach Carl Zamloch is experiencing
as much trouble getting his men into
shape as Wolter has been having,
though Zamloch appears to be a great
deal more upset by the condition of
his team than Wolter. After three de
feats by Saint Mary's the Bruin men
tor decided something was not right.
He has made several changes in the
lineup, including the substitution of
Watson and Craviotto in the infield.
Nounnan Highly Touted
Nomecheck and Nounnan are the
two California twirlers of whom most
is expected. The latter started in every
game of the Stanford-California series
last year. He is regarded by some of
the Berkeleyites as the greatest col
lege pitcher seen in the West for many
seasons. Porke is the third Bruin
moundsman. He twirled in the last
game against Saint Mary's and held
the Saint sluggers to seven hits well
scattered through the nine innings. Ho
is figured as likely to start in at least
one of the three games.
The Cards have shown consistent
improvement since returning from
their trip South. The individual ability
to make a winning team is clearly
there, and if the men can hit their
stride in time the chances for a Stan
ford victory are good.
Comparative scores, uncertain indi
cators though they are, appear to give
Wolter's men a slight edge.

Coach Carl Zamloch is experiencing
as much trouble getting his men into
shape as Wolter has been having,
though Zamloch appears to be a great
deal more upset by the condition of
his team than Wolter. After three de
feats by Saint Mary's the Bruin men
tor decided something was not right.
He has made several changes in the
lineup, including the substitution of
Watson and Craviotto in the infield.
Nounnan Highly Touted
Nomecheck and Nounnan are the
two California twirlers of whom most
is expected. The latter started in every
game of the Stanford-California series
last year. He is regarded by some of
the Berkeleyites as the greatest col
lege pitcher seen in the West for many
seasons. Porke is the third Bruin
moundsman. He twirled in the last
game against Saint Mary's and held
the Saint sluggers to seven hits well
scattered through the nine innings. Ho
is figured as likely to start in at least
one of the three games.
The Cards have shown consistent
improvement since returning from
their trip South. The individual ability
to make a winning team is clearly
there, and if the men can hit their
stride in time the chances for a Stan
ford victory are good.
Comparative scores, uncertain indi
cators though they are, appear to give
Wolter's men a slight edge.
Baseball prospects took another drop
yesterday afternoon. Following a meet
ing of the scholarship committee it
was learned that Chuck Johnston, first
baseman, will be ineligible for the rest
of the season, contrary to reports
made early yesterday.
The class of 1928 will be much in
evidence Saturday afternoon when
Harry Wolter's varsity baseball play
ers meet California at West Field in
Berkeley immediately after the track
meet between California and Missouri.
At least six out of the nine Stanford
players will be members of last year's
freshman squad, a unique situation in
the history of Stanford. Captain Cud
deback on third and Paddy Draper on
first may be the only upperclassmen
on the nine. This does not mean that
Wolter has in any way a green or in
experienced lineup. The freshman
team last year was exceptional in both
individual playing and teamwork. The
men have had to earn their places
against stiff competition this Beason.
Sobieski, Sypher Battery
Bill Clark and Tex Weaver will
start in the outfield. The third fielder
has not yet been finally selected.
Sobieski and Sypher, the varsity's best
battery combination, will endeavor to
shut out the Blue and Gold swatters.
