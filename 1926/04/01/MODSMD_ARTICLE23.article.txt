In an attempt to get first hand knowledge of conditions in shops and
factories where women are employed fifty Radcliffe, Wellesley, and Sim
mons students are to seek employment during the summer, and report in
full upon their experiences when they return to college in the fall. The
women are to go incognito and spend their leisure time, as well as their
working hours, exactly as the working girls do.
The fifty missionaries will no doubt have a pleasant summer. Variety
and novelty will put no end of thrill in their enterprise; but their survey
will be of doubtful value. It is well and good to undergo the same condi
tions as some one less fortunate than yourself; but it takes the person who
must of necessity conform to the poorer environment to appreciate its
actual sordidness or its minimum of lienefits. Will it be possible for the
college women with a comfortable home to return to at the conclusion of
the escapade and an educated appreciation of the brighter side of life, to see
the situation from the workers point of view?
If a report of conditions is desired it would be more effective if it were
obtained directly from the working girls. All of us have at some time
done some piece of labor under the strain of poor surroundings. At first
the bad conditions have been obstacles to overcome, barriers to incite our
industry; but in time they become doubly noticeable and shortly will prove
to be antagonizing in a way which will check the desire to work rather
than stimulate it. Probably the women will not stay with the game long
enough to feel the latter emotion.
