# Freshman Debating
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon twenty-one freshmen competed for a place on the
debating squads which will represent Stanford in competition with the
University of California speakers. Such a large turnout is gratifying from
two standpoints. It shows that the first year men are interested in Uni
versity activities; and it also proves that debating is receiving the support
that it has long merited. With so many to choose from the coaches should
have little difficulty in selecting teams that will show well in intercollegiate
matches. . .. * ju !Â«.
An indirect boost ( ?) for our own. fair Hollywood from the Daily
A r cbraskan:
"The wild life of college students is exceeded only in gayety by that of Holly
wood movie stars, in the opinion of many sincere but mistaken citizens. ...
Dangerous words from the Daily I rojan of U.S.C.:
"The athletes are all compensated for representing the University by some re
ward. This applies even to the Freshmen athletes."
