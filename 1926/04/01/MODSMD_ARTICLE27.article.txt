THE FEET THAT LEFT HIM FLAT
One morning at the breaK or day the sun rose up in pink,
While in Sequoia from his bed there rose a certain Gink.
This fellow was as funny a sort as you could hope to greet,
He had a theory that your ways were measured by your feet!
His method was to find a face —'twould probably be keen —
The next he'd notice was her clothes —quite fond he was of green.
Now having checked these items well he'd travel to her feet
And there he'd make his final check. He said, "It can't be beat!
"Just notice if her feet are large, she is a loving creature,
But she is probably too dumb, an undesired feature!"
If she has feet with arches high and walks with dainty step,
She'll probably spend all your cash, for she'll be full of pep.
So, you can tell most any girl—my system never falters —
I'll pick my maid from one whose feet will not hold me in halters!
So saying, Gink went out this day to garner him a maiden,
And, e'er he'd ridden far he saw a lovely one, parading.
Her face —oh, words have power to speak but not describe her face, see?
Her looks alone were quite enough to make a man go crazy.
Her clothes! They knocked his eyes clear out. Oh, golly, what a queen—
Her skirt was chick, and short enough—his favorite color, green!
«
Now, having thus his checks compiled he dropped his eyes still further;
Suffice to say, he met the girl and married her, but, murder!!
She spent his cash, and then—divorce. The poor man has to beg;
How come his foot-scheme didn't work? He only saw her .
Well, anyway, he didn't know she had a foot! —L.A.B,

DR. PIP'S PANACEA
I. Sunburn
(Editor's Note—This is the first of a series of remedies for the common
distempers of academic life by Dr. Previous Pip, the noted fingernail surgeon
and mosquito-bite specialist.)
Symptoms of Sunburn:
1. A marked aversion to backslapping and other forms of hearty greeting.
2. A decided tendency to discard the shirt as in certain forms of insanity.
3. A fondness for stools and other forms of backless chairs or a certain
partiality to the vertical position.
4. inability to sleep while lying on the back.
5. A state of nervous tension and irritability resulting in a suppressed
desire to go swimming with an iceberg.
Causes of Sunburn:
Engaging in an engaging conversation with a certain co-ed on the banks
of Lagunita while dressed in a bathing suit.
2. Excess vanity marked by a desire to exhibit the extremities to the
spectators.
3. A tendency to over-sleep.
4. By donning a bathing suit when you are afraid of the tadpoles in the
lake.
Remedies for Sunburn:
1. Remove the skin from the irritated parts by vigorous rubbing with
sandpaper.
2. Wear a raincoat when you go swimming.
3. Use Dr. Pip's seasickness remedy.
4 Go swimming.
5. Don't go swimming.
* * *
By the use of tactful language in the "Curricula-Critic Oralis" column,
students could soon develop an efficient pipe bureau through voice of the press.

Since this is April Fool's Day, Cabbages ought to have some jokes but we
! fear that the long-suffering readers will have to wait another year to be fooled.

This fellow was as funny a sort as you could hope to greet,
He had a theory that your ways were measured by your feet!
His method was to find a face —'twould probably be keen —
The next he'd notice was her clothes —quite fond he was of green.
Now having checked these items well he'd travel to her feet
And there he'd make his final check. He said, "It can't be beat!
"Just notice if her feet are large, she is a loving creature,
But she is probably too dumb, an undesired feature!"
If she has feet with arches high and walks with dainty step,
She'll probably spend all your cash, for she'll be full of pep.
So, you can tell most any girl—my system never falters —
I'll pick my maid from one whose feet will not hold me in halters!
So saying, Gink went out this day to garner him a maiden,
And, e'er he'd ridden far he saw a lovely one, parading.
Her face —oh, words have power to speak but not describe her face, see?
Her looks alone were quite enough to make a man go crazy.
Her clothes! They knocked his eyes clear out. Oh, golly, what a queen—
Her skirt was chick, and short enough—his favorite color, green!
«
Now, having thus his checks compiled he dropped his eyes still further;
Suffice to say, he met the girl and married her, but, murder!!
She spent his cash, and then—divorce. The poor man has to beg;
How come his foot-scheme didn't work? He only saw her .
Well, anyway, he didn't know she had a foot! —L.A.B,

DR. PIP'S PANACEA
I. Sunburn
(Editor's Note—This is the first of a series of remedies for the common
distempers of academic life by Dr. Previous Pip, the noted fingernail surgeon
and mosquito-bite specialist.)
Symptoms of Sunburn:
1. A marked aversion to backslapping and other forms of hearty greeting.
2. A decided tendency to discard the shirt as in certain forms of insanity.
3. A fondness for stools and other forms of backless chairs or a certain
partiality to the vertical position.
4. inability to sleep while lying on the back.
5. A state of nervous tension and irritability resulting in a suppressed
desire to go swimming with an iceberg.
Causes of Sunburn:
Engaging in an engaging conversation with a certain co-ed on the banks
of Lagunita while dressed in a bathing suit.
2. Excess vanity marked by a desire to exhibit the extremities to the
spectators.
3. A tendency to over-sleep.
4. By donning a bathing suit when you are afraid of the tadpoles in the
lake.
Remedies for Sunburn:
1. Remove the skin from the irritated parts by vigorous rubbing with
sandpaper.
2. Wear a raincoat when you go swimming.
3. Use Dr. Pip's seasickness remedy.
4 Go swimming.
5. Don't go swimming.

THE FEET THAT LEFT HIM FLAT
One morning at the breaK or day the sun rose up in pink,
While in Sequoia from his bed there rose a certain Gink.
