## April Fool!

Ringside: The new six billion dollar aluminum stadium |
built by Tex Rickard especially for the Dempsey-Gorilla
bout at Dayton, Tenn., was crowded long before noon. It
is estimated that 250.000 are already in the enclosure. |
William Muldoon, of the New York State boxing commis- [
sion, appeared shortly after one o'clock smoking a cigar â€¢
and two cigarettes.
At 1:30 a group of Gorilla's friends at the ringside got j
noisy and had to be suppressed by the zoo keepers. At 1:35 j
Dempsey climbed into the ring. He was followed closely j
by Gorilla, but escaped to his corner safely. Five minutes !
later a near casualty occurred when an enterprising camera-!
man tried to take a close-up of the challenger. It took i
ten strong men to hold the angry anthropoid in his corner, I
and Dempsey paled visibly.
At the sound of the gong Gorilla leaped up snarling and

advanced towards Dempsey, who declined to shake hands, uus seemed to
infuriate his opponent, as he at once made a wide grasping motion with both
hands. Dempsey shouted "Unfair!" Gorilla stopped a moment, puzzled, and
the champion landed a steaming right to the jaw that loosened two eye-teeth.
From then until the end of the round it was a fast exhibition, with Dempsey
leading by about a foot and a half all the way.
Two minutes after the second round opened, Gorilla took five pounds off
Dempsey's left shoulder with a vicious side-swipe, but as the champion had
been complaining of being over-weight, his supporters were not disturbed.
In the third, Jack broke his right hand on the challenger's jaw-bone. In
the fourth, he gave Gorilla two cauliflower ears, which didn't increase his
good looks any. In the fifth, the champion broke his left wrist on his oppo- :
nent's ribs, and from then on was practically helpless. Two minutes later j
Gorilla caught up with him, and, with a rabbit blow on the neck with his right j
paw and a slap on the cheek with his left, annexed the heavyweight crown
of the world.
After the fight Gorilla said, "Well, I'm kinda glad I won, you know, for the
little woman's sake, but it sure was a tough fight."
