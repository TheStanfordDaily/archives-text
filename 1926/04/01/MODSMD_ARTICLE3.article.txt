# PRACTICAL JOKERS INTRODUCE FLEAS TO BRANNER ROOM
## 
### 
The death-like silence which
pervades the environs of Bran
ner hall in the "wee sma' hours"
was interrupted at 1 o'clock this
morning by loud shouts and gales
of laughter.
After waiting around for near
ly two hours for the wayward
hall man, who was the victim, to
arrive home, the conspirators
finally were successful. A large
shepherd hound was found in the
bed of the aggrieved victim and
didn't care about moving out.
Inmates of the invaded room
are today commencing a "catch
the flee" campaign in order to
eliminate the household pest at
home.
