# FRESHMAN TENNIS SQUAD READY FOR MATCH WITH BEARS
## 
### 
With the recent decisive defeat of
the strong Sail Diego High School
team to its credit, the freshman tennis
team successfully completed final pre
parations for the match with Califor
nia Saturday at 10 o'clock on the
Berkeley courts.
John Wheatley, prominent San Fran
cisco player and No. (» ranking junior
in Northern California, will lead the
team. In the competition with the vari
ous high school teams Wheatley has
won every singles match. Following
his powerful service to the net, he
angles off (he returns to the corners
of the court. On the defensive he re
lies upon steady forehand and back
hand drives to gain an advantage
which he is usually able to maintain
with his own delivery.
Ernest Renzel, basketball star and
well-known San Jose raqueter, will
play second singles. Renzel's game
suffered during the late court season,
but he has again rounded into form.
His game is not severe or very spec
tacular. He carefully prepares his
openings by a series of accurate, crafty
shots, and then finishes the rally with
a decisive stroke.
Third singles position is held by

David Robb, another basketball player.
Kobb possesses a large variety of
shots and is especially effective
against opponents who rush the net. i
His general play is bulwarked with
crisp volleys and a fast, high-bounding
service.
The first doubles will be composed :
of Wheatley and Robb, and the second
of Lyndon Farwell and Lawrence j
Hall, San Jose junior champions, and
tournament experience. They should {
make a reliable, smooth-working com-1
bination. Farwell and Hall, though less j
skillful individually than opponents ]
conquered in the ranking matches,
play beautifully together. Their ex- j
ceptional teamwork is expected to be ,
an important factor in their match
Saturday. 1
