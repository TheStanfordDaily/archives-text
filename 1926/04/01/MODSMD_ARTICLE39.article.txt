"Dink Templeton will find the sled
ding pretty hard when he matches his
skill with that of 'Stoneface' Crom
well in what is doped to be the hard
est-fought and most evenly-matched
meet of the season." Thus says Jimmy
Smith, the champion dopester of
Southern California, who won the dope
contest in the dual meet between U.C.
and U.S.C., in writing a story on the
Stanford-U.S.C. meet.
Smith gives the Southern track men
nine first places out of the possible J
fifteen, and gives U.S.C. the meet by
four and one-third points.
