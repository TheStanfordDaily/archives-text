# TEMPLETON PLANS OFFICIAL WORKOUT FOR BABE TRACKMEN
## Freshmen Will Run Through Events in Preparation For Final Meet 
### Paul Sexson 
! Coach Templeton's freshman track
j men will be given a final chance to
! show their stuff before the California
j babe meet when they run through
| their events tomorrow afternoon. The
i whole squad will participate in an
j "official workout" and the results will
j show the real strength of the squad.
The freshman aggregation promises
; to turn in a well-balanced victory as it
!is especially strong in the sprints,
weight events, and pole vault. The
i California yearlings boast of a broad
jumper capable of 21 feet 6 inches and
also of a strong high jumper. The lat
ter event is perhaps the weakest spot
on the whole Card team, the highest
1 mark set so far being 5 feet 9% inches.
! Stanford's hopes in the broad jump
will be divided between Preston and
Lauritzen, who have done over 20
feet consistently.
| Captain McKinnon is conceded to
j take the two-lap event, but he will be
j closely followed by Clum, who has
; been out with an injured leg for the
I first part of the season. Clum has done
j the distance under 2 minutes and is
] an old rival of McKinnon. Three years
i ago he placed fourth in the nationals
j at Chicago.
The sprints will be ably taken care
! of by Syer and Berry, who promise to
| turn in fast times in the century and
! furlong. The quarter mile is practi
j cally cinched by Dales who lias turned
|in 51.8 and who consistently shades
j 52.
Gooden, Jost, and Conner are the
best bets for the mile. Gooden's best
time has been 4:44.8. The two hurdle
races also promise to garner points
around 16.4 in the highs and under 26
in the lows. Little difficulty should be
encountered in the relay with such
fast men as Syer, McKinnon, Dales,
and Moss.
A first place in the pole vault is
practically assured with Hulsman do
j ing 12 feet 6 inches, while Edmonds
will put up a strong argument for sec
ond place with 12 feet. Fleishacker
and Tandy heave the shot around 42
feet; they also lead in throwing the
discus. Sparling makes the strongest
j bid for the javelin with 165 feet.
