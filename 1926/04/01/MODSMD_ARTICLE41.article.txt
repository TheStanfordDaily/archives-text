# CARDINAL SWIMMERS LOSE TO BROOKLYN Y. M. C. A. 20 TO 39
## 
### 
Cardinal swimmers put up a very
creditable showing last night when
they lost to the strong team of the
Brooklyn Y.M.C.A. by a score of 39
to 20. The five Stanford men were up
against one of the greatest collections
of aquatic stars in the country. Wal
ter Spence, national champion in the
breaststroke and medley and probably
the greatest all-around swimmer, took
two firsts for the Brooklynites, win
ning both the 150-yard free style and
the 200-yard breaststroke events.
A communication received today
from a member of the Stanford swim
ming squad tells the following of the
meet at Kansas City last week:
A new intercollegiate record was set
in the 220-yard free style by Wallace
O'Connor at the Kansas City Athletic
Club. O'Connor traveled the furlong
in 2:21 1-5, going 3-5 second under the
former time of 2:21 4-5 held by James
Bronson of Yale. The time was made
in an exhibition event.
O'Connor has been making the best
times of his swimming career on the
way East with the five-man Cardinal
swimming squad, which will compete
in the national intercollegiate cham
pionships at Annapolis. He was a mem
ber of the four-man 880-yard relay
team which represented America in
the last Olympic Games.
Arden Allen won an open 150-yard
backstroke race in 1:54. In Eastern
collegiate competition he will be fac
ing backstrokers who make around
1:47. Allen will be competing in the
shorter pools and should cut down his
| time by his ability on the turns. He

figures as a possible winner largely
on his competitive ability and fight.
Carl Stevenson, Stanford distance
star, went an exhibition 440 free style
in 5:32. Bob Williams swam an exhi
bition century in the fairly speedy
time of :57 3-5.
A new tank record of 1:43 2-5 for
200 yards was set by the relay team
composed of Allen, Stevenson, Wil
liams, and O'Connor. The former mark
was 1:49 2-5. This is an average of a
shade under 26 seconds per man.
