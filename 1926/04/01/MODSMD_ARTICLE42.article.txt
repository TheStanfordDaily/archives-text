### 
The official delegation to represent
Stanford at the National Y.W.C.A. con
vention which will be held in Mil
waukee, April 21-26, has been selected
by a committee of old and new offi
cers. Ethelind Thompson, new presi
dent, Eleanor Davidson, past under
graduate representative, and Elizabeth
Bakewell, new representative, were
chosen. Isabel Capps, secretary, is ac
companying the delegation.
At an open meeting at 7:15 tonight,
for all Y.W.C.A. members, Stanford's
part in the convention will be dis
cussed. Issues likely to arise there will
be considered, and any instructions to
the delegation will be given. This is
the first time that Stanford has been
adequately represented at the biennial
conventions, and the delegates ask
that members be present tonight to
confer with them.
The delegates leave April 17, and
plan to return April 30. Their absence
has been sanctioned by President Wil
bur and Dean Yost. All branches of
the Y.W.C.A. attend the national gath-

erings, and each division holds meet
ings in addition to the open meetings.
Miss Capps is a past president of the
Student Assembly, the council of the
student organizations, and is familiar
with the work which will be done at
the convention. The representation
this year was made possible when the
complete budget of $lt}oo was raised
in the recent finance drive.
Election of the new officers was held
at the close of winter quarter, before
the selection of the delegation. The
results were: Ethelind Thompson,
president; Kathreen Clock, vice-presi
dent; Dorothy Brown, secretary;
Helen Huneke, treasurer; and Eliza
beth Bakewell, undergraduate repre
sentative.
