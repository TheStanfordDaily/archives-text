"The drama that grapples with new
forms and that does something new is
j that which most interests us," de
j clared I)r. Henry I). Gray in his talk
ion "Present Tendencies of Modern
i Drama" at the open meeting of the
i Euphronia Debating Society last night
in the Women's Clubhouse.
| Dr. Gray emphasized the fact that
people do not usually appreciate con
temporary drama, but are apt to look
backwards and venerate the plays of
the past. He pointed out that although
modern dramas are utterly different
from each other, they are all alike in
dealing with fundamentals.
According to Dr. Gray, the best
drama produced in the world today is
presented in Germany, while Russia
has deteriorated greatly in the field of
dramatic literature since the Revolu
tion. The three tendencies of modern
drama, says Dr. Gray, are: realism,
which discards the conventional happy
lending; symbolism, which hints or
suggests subjects; impassionate stage
settings, that are similar to the sets
of Shakespeare's time.
