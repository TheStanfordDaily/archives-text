# TRACK DOPESTERS PREDICT STANFORD WIN OVER TROJANS
## Champion Prophet of U.S.C. Gives Southern Squad Victory 67 2-3 -63 1-3 
### 
Campus dopesters entering the Daily
Palo Alto dope contest have, with only
one exception, predicted a victory over
the U.S.C. track team Saturday. Four
of the dope sheets received by the
Contest Editor have given Stanford
the meet with 66 points to the Tro
jans' 65, but they varied on place
points.
All of the predictions give the Cardi
nal relay team five points for the
event, and none of the prophets grants
the University of Southern California
athletes a clean sweep in any event
on the program.
On the other hand, a score com
piled by Jimmy Smith, the champion
dopester at Southern California, gives
U.S.C. the meet with a score of 67 2-3
points to 63 1-3 for Stanford.
According to the rules of the con
test, each dope sheet must give the
final score of the track meet and also
the points scored by both universities
in all of the fifteen events. All guesses
must be in the hands of the Contest
Editor of the Daily Palo Alto by Fri
day noon, and if mailed must be post
marked before that time.
No member of the Daily Palo Alto
editorial or business staff can enter
the contest, and each contestant is
limited to only one prediction. The
winner of the contest will receive a
five dollar merchandise prize which
has been donated by Morey's Smoke
Shop.
Announcement of the individual win
ning the award will be made in Mon
day's issue of the Daily Palo Alto. Of
the many dope sheets received the
following is one of the most interest-
