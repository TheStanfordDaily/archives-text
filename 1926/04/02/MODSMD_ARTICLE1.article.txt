# CARDINAL BASEBALL NINE WILL MEET CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY
## Coach Wolter Is Confident of Victory Despite Poor Practice Season 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter slammed out
his final hot drive to the infield in the
varsity workout yesterday afternoon
and ended baseball practice until after
the first game to be held at West field,
Berkeley, tomorrow afternoon immedi
ately after the Missouri-California
track meet. As far as relative strength
of the two nines are concerned the
teams appear even, and any predic
tions would have to be the rankest
sort of guesswork.
Wolter, who is the best informed as
well as the most interested party in
the situation, expressed no anxiety. He
is satisfied with the improvement the
team has shown in both batting and
defensive work since their return to
the campus, and feels that the Cards
have at least an even break with
California.
This is not the first year that Stan
ford has made a mediocre showing in
"early-season games but Wolter seems
to have the faculty of being able to
produce a team that can come through
with a victory against California if no
one else.
The team, as it takes the field to
morrow, will be seven-ninths sopho
more. Captain Cuddeback on third and
Paddy Draper at first, both in their
last season of varsity competition, are
the only men who are not members
of the strong freshman team of last
year.
Sobieski will start the game in the
box. He has thoroughly proved him
self the Cards' best pitching bet. Since
the first game against Santa Clara,
when he checked a threatened last-
Tninute rally by the Missionites in the
ninth inning, he has a consistent rec
ord of few hits allowed and relatively
high strikeout record. On the trip
South he came through in every con
test he pitched and would have won
for the Cards if his support had been
adequate. His hatting record has been
unusually good for a twirler.
Sypher will be behind the plate. He
was captain of the freshman team last
year and is a leader on the diamond
as well as a very capable catcher.
The rest of the lineup will be as
follows: Garibaldi, who has improved
almost a hundred per cent since the
start of the season, at second; Busch,
a player with lots of snap and ginger,
at short. Fielders will be Weaver, Nis
sen, and Clark. Weaver and Nissen
were in the lineup in the first games
of the season, and Clark has proved
his right to the position both by his
great slugging power as well as his
clever fielding. His batting will be a
big factor in the offense.

almost a hundred per cent since the
start of the season, at second; Busch,
a player with lots of snap and ginger,
at short. Fielders will be Weaver, Nis
sen, and Clark. Weaver and Nissen
were in the lineup in the first games
of the season, and Clark has proved
his right to the position both by his
great slugging power as well as his
clever fielding. His batting will be a
big factor in the offense.
Coach Harry Wolter slammed out
his final hot drive to the infield in the
varsity workout yesterday afternoon
and ended baseball practice until after
the first game to be held at West field,
Berkeley, tomorrow afternoon immedi
ately after the Missouri-California
track meet. As far as relative strength
of the two nines are concerned the
teams appear even, and any predic
tions would have to be the rankest
sort of guesswork.
Wolter, who is the best informed as
well as the most interested party in
the situation, expressed no anxiety. He
is satisfied with the improvement the
team has shown in both batting and
defensive work since their return to
the campus, and feels that the Cards
have at least an even break with
California.
This is not the first year that Stan
ford has made a mediocre showing in
"early-season games but Wolter seems
to have the faculty of being able to
produce a team that can come through
with a victory against California if no
one else.
The team, as it takes the field to
morrow, will be seven-ninths sopho
more. Captain Cuddeback on third and
Paddy Draper at first, both in their
last season of varsity competition, are
the only men who are not members
of the strong freshman team of last
year.
Sobieski will start the game in the
box. He has thoroughly proved him
self the Cards' best pitching bet. Since
the first game against Santa Clara,
when he checked a threatened last-
Tninute rally by the Missionites in the
ninth inning, he has a consistent rec
ord of few hits allowed and relatively
high strikeout record. On the trip
South he came through in every con
test he pitched and would have won
for the Cards if his support had been
adequate. His hatting record has been
unusually good for a twirler.
Sypher will be behind the plate. He
was captain of the freshman team last
year and is a leader on the diamond
as well as a very capable catcher.
The rest of the lineup will be as
follows: Garibaldi, who has improved
almost a hundred per cent since the
start of the season, at second; Busch,
a player with lots of snap and ginger,
at short. Fielders will be Weaver, Nis
sen, and Clark. Weaver and Nissen
were in the lineup in the first games
of the season, and Clark has proved
his right to the position both by his
great slugging power as well as his
clever fielding. His batting will be a
big factor in the offense.
