# STANFORD TRACK MEN EXPECT STIFF OPPOSITION FROM U.S.C.
## Dink Templeton's Proteges Favored In Distance Events; Southerners Doped To Take Sprints 
### Clif Moore 
£»ONTRARY to the optimistic opinions held by many campus dopesters, Coach
Dink Templeton's admittedly strong aggregation of track and field athletes
will encounter a great deal of trouble when it meets the powerful University
of Southern California squad in the stadium oval tomorrow afternoon. The
meet promises to be one of the closest seen on the coast this season, and the
margin of victory for either team will be determined by a few points.
The Trojans are conceded a first place in both sprint events. Coverly is
expected to take both second places for Stanford, and Caspar of Stanford
and Smith of the Trojans have an even chance for the third place points.

" The Cardinals may score a clean
sweep in the quarter-mile. Miller and
Storie are sure to place one-two, and
McGuire has a good chance to annex
the final point. Smith is the only south
ern runner that will make a bid for a
place in the one-lap event.
Interest in 880
Captain Richardson may set a new
record in the half-mile. Niersbach is
rated highly in the Southland and he
may make the Stanford leader extend
himself to win his event. Carlsmith of
Stanford is counted on to come
through with a third place in the two
lap race.
The mile race also promises to be
close, but Kerr of Stanford is given a
decided edge over Shawhan of U.S.C.
Kerr is also a favorite in the two-mile,
but Heilman may come through with
a victory for the southern team.
U.S.C. Have Hurdlers
The Trojans are favored to annex
first places in both hurdles. Dye will
undoubtedly take the honors In the
highs, with West of Stanford a close
second. Spencer is conceded the third
place point in this event. Grumbles
looks to be supreme in the low sticks,
with Dye and West finishing second
and third, respectively.
Captain Rul Houser is sure to win
ten points for his team in the weights.
Hoffman is favored to take seconds in
both events for Stanford. Alieski will
probably take third in the shot, but
Evans of Stanford will retaliate with
the extra point in the discus.
Meeks Best Jumper
Meeks seems to be the best per
former in the broad jump, and his
consistent jumping over the 23-foot
mark should give him first place in
this event. Reynolds and McCrae seem
to be about evenly matched, and
should stage a good fight for second
honors. Work is counted on to add
five points to the Cardinal total with
a first place in the high jump. Second
and third places are doubtful with
Muhs and King of Stanford, and Cog
geshal and Ross of the Trojans, vieing
for the honors.
Stanford is not conceded much of a
chance in the pole vault, with Barnes
of the Southern team sure to take
first place. Harlow should give the
Cardinals five points in the javelin,
i with Shipkey of Stanford, and Cook
j of U.S.C. about even for second.
Stanford Has Relay
Stanford's relay team is recognized
I as the fastest on the coast, and Tem
pleton's combination of one-lap artists,
Babcock, Richardson, Storie, and Mil
ler, should defeat any quartet placed
on the track by the Trojan coach. If
the outcome of the meet depends upon
the relay, Stanford can be assured a
victory.
