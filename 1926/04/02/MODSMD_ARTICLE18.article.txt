# PATHE CAMERAMAN TAKES PICTURES AT FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Spring football was given extra pub
licity yesterday afternoon when a
Pathe cameraman arrived to film tlie
grid men at their daily dozen. Setting
up exercises, work on the tackling j
dummy, and on the charging machine |
received attention from the visiting
photographer.
Coach Warner is trying out several
new combinations in the backfield this
spring, in an effort to find a workable
quartet for next fall's competition.
Due to the loss of Nevers, Mitchell,
and Solomon, Warner will have to fill
the places of fullback and quarterback
with new men.
Fast Combinations
Among the combinations which
looked good yesterday were Post,
Bogue, Murphy, and Wolfe; Bronson,
Frost, Young, and Reed; and Walker,
Moore, Hill, and Snider. These men
ran off some fast plays, and seemed
to work together well. Other backfield
men who are not out at present are
Simms, captain of the freshman squad,
who is out for baseball, and Hoffman,
who is out for track.
The linesmen are out in profusion.
Captain Swan, Poulson, Natcher, Ver
millya, Everett, Robeski, and others
of varsity caliber, were working out,
and showing to best advantage. Tandy
and Artman, both out for freshman
track, are a pair of fine tackles who
will be in the swim after the season
is over.
Punters Develop
Some good punting showed up in
the work of Graves and Pabst, who
were doing close to forty yards yes
terday. On the receiving end, some
spectacular catches were made by
Trombetta, halfback. Young, fullback
prospect, also tried several punts, and
did creditable work.
