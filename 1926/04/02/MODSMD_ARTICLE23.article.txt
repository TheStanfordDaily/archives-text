If one were to ask the Innocent Bystander today for his judgment as
to the most popular track meet to be seen on the Stanford oval this year,
the 1.8. might well reply, "The one with U.S.C. tomorrow." And perhaps
he wouldn't he so far off at that.
Tomorrow the University of Southern California will appear on the
stadium track with the title of 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. champions and with one
of the strongest teams in the country. It is a team justly to he feared and
respected for its possibilities and Stanford is glad to welcome such an op
ponent.
Dean Cromwell, the Trojan mentor, is undoubtedly a great factor in
the development of track and field teams at U.S.C. Under his expert
tutelage, the southern institution has been favored with the reflected glory
of track stars of national and world reputations. In their Hall of Fame,
if such were to be established, would go the names of Paddock, llouser,
Drew, Kelly, and countless others of ever-honored memory.
Opposed to the veteran Cromwell will be Coach "Dink" Templeton,
the comparatively young and certainly popular track coach of the Cardinal
squad. Templeton talks slower than any coach in the United States, it is
believed, but he ranks with the best in fast development of track stars.
Already in his fifth year of coaching he has a national title to his credit
and the pride of bringing into the limelight such stars as I lartranft, Leist
ner, Richardson, and others.
Tomorrow the veteran and beginner match wits and strength. The
contest may be decided on "breaks" or upon individual, sure-fire perform
ances but regardless of the result it is certain that skillful coaching will
play a great role.
