"The fruits of victory are sweet"; hut they taste far more delightful
when obstacles are showed aside to obtain them. Tomorrow a Stanford
baseball team which has done little to distinguish itself in its preliminary
season will meet California in the first game of the annual Cardinal-Bruin
series.
For the past two years the Cards have been doped to lose to California;
and for the same number of years certain defeat on the diamond has been
turned into glorious victory. Coach Harry Wolter and the nine men who
have represented Stanford have eradicated from their minds all thoughts
concerning the tragedies that have befallen them in the earlier part of the
year; and have concentrated their abilities on the Golden Rear. The re
sult has been gratifying.
Last year California won the first game of the baseball series by such
a fabulously large score that it seemed incredible for Stanford even to tie
the series and make it necessary to plav a third and deciding game. At this
stage of the performance the California yearlxiok, the Blue and Gold, was
sent to press. Its editors, as well as the majority of the sport fans on the
Pacific Coast, assumed that California was a "cinch." Their work re
flected this opinion. When the book had been bound it was discovered
that Stanford had won the second game, the third game, and the series.
It was too late to make a correction.
For the benefit of this year's editors of the Blue and Gold we hope that
tomorrow the Cards will administer a defeat to the Bear which will pre
vent the making of a similar error.
ELSEWHERE IN THE DAILY will be found a coupon with in
structions attached. The editor hopes that all living groups will ask
their alumni who are returning tomorrow to witness the U.S.C. meet to
supply the information and mail the coupon to the Alumni Secretary's
office promptly. The success of University Day on May 15 depends upon
this information.
Intensity of education as noted in the Crccn and White of Ohio Uni
versity :
"Coeds all over the country will watch with breathless interest the outcome of
the forthcoming convention in New York when 2,0<)0 members of the hairdressers'
association meet at the Hotel Commodore to decide the fate of bobbed hair."
Perfect truth as expounded by the Oklahoma Daily:
"The visiting high school students should not judge the university entirely by
what they see at fraternity bouses, and the thought of the university by the topics
they hear discussed by the fraternity men."
Chinese-puzzle journalism as seen in the Daily Ncbraskaii:
"The performance of the 'Co-ed Follies' will start early enough in the evening j
so it will not interfere with any other function which may not occur that night."
Rise of public opinion in McGill University:
"How much longer must we allow in our Daily such cheap and obnoxiou> I
language as your reporter uses ?" !
