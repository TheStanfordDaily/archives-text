## CYRUS BUZLOW THROWS THE BULL 
### Monroe Eaton 
Dere Jaik:
I have bin patin frum (lie mentle peace laitly all on a count of a little
bull seshun which I engaged in last Saturday. Their is a gui with lives in
this hall wat is always getting A in his curses and 1 herd a cupla fellas
talkin the uther daie abowt how they wisht they cud throe the bull like he cud.
Well 1 thinks to miself how nise it wud be to be able to throe the bull if
by doin it 1 cud get A's seein as now 1 dont ever getum hardly. Not of coarse
that 1 saw any conecktshun between bulls and citizenship furinstanc. So 1
goz to the brite boy and asks him if he wudnt teche me to throe the bull soz
I cud get A's like he dun, also.
He getz a meen Ink in his eie and tells me to cum around on Saturday
and he will shoe me how to throe the bull for shure. Well 1 goz round to his
room on Saturdaie mornin and he talks me owt kwick to a psteur over my
maifeeld in the middle of which is a big he-bull a eatin away at the gras.
Then he hands me a red coat and tells me to go owt in the field. Get
behind the bull. And start a twistin his tale at the same time putting the
red coat on. He argues with me as how in that way I cud finale get by a
little practice soz I cud throe the bull all over the field. I askt him to show
me Ist but he objekts saying that he is goin home that afternoon and consee
kwently isent dressed in the rite close too throe the bull.
Well Jaik I kinda suspishund their wuz sumthin fishie abowt the hole
buziness being as how acoardin to my expeeriens with bulls this 1 mite not
take it so well. Rut then again I thote this mite be a speshul kind of trained
bull that they uze around collej to get A's with.
So 1 climes over the fense and walks across the feeld to the bull. First
he luks up at me gentle and nise and then goz on a eatin the gras. Bein
encuraiged I goz around behind him ant puts on the red cote at the same
time grabbin his tale as I wuz told to do.
Then the bull luks around irritaited like and sees me with the red cote.
Well Jaik before I new anuther thing his head wuz around where his tale wuz
preeviusly and the bull and me wuz tarein across the feeld with me leedin
him by 1 ft. When we got to the fense I hev to slow downe a bit in order to
get my jumpin stride and lie makes up the foot handykap in no time thereby
assistin me over the 8 ft. of fense withowt the leest effort on his or mie part.
Jaik mie conshense never hurt me so much before as it did then. And
Jaik remember this. Never trie to throe the bull unless yew are just natruly
cut owt to b a cowboy or a tore-he-a-door.
