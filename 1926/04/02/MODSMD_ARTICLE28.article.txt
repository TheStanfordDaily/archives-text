# SPORTS OF 1926
## Bib Belts â€™Em 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is one sweet ball player who, unless better men
than myself are mistaken, will be one of the best outfielders
in the game before many more years roll by. Bib Falk is
out for revenge this year. "Revenge for what?" you ask.
Why, to show his younger brother Chester where to get
off at, to head in, and likewise to stay put. For didn't
young Chester, who pitches left-handed slants for the St.
Louis Browns, have the nerve to bat .625 last year, more
than twice as high as Older Brother Bib did? (Not Big
Brother Bib for Chester is the larger of the two.)
Of course, the pitcher's phenomenal average was com
piled in only seventeen games, while Bib hit .301 in 154
contests, but just the same, the White Sox left fielder is
sore about something else too, and that is that 1925 was the
first year in which he failed to improve upon his average of
the preceding year. So Bib is out to surpass the mark of

.1152 he set in 1924, as well as to show that his left-handed kid brother can't hit
any percentage twice as good as his own, anyway.
But Bib doesn't make fun of his kid brother for being a southpaw. No, sir.
Bib is left-handed too, and pitched for the University of Texas for three years
before Joining the White Sox. He and Manager "Jawn" Evers had quite a
row about it in 1924. for Evers wanted Bib to be a pitcher, but Mr. Falk had
other plans. Evers lost the argument.
iiib August (though born in January) Falk is 27 years old, and six feet
tall. He makes many a spectacular catch in the outfield for Manager Collins,
and when he gets his 175 pounds behind a ball during a game, why that ball,
and sometimes the ball game, is utterly ruined.
He is making Chicago South Side fang forget all about Joe Jackson.
