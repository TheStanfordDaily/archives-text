# WOMEN'S COUNCIL CONSIDERS BREAKS OF LAGUNITA RULE
## 
### 
Canoe tests for women will com
mence again under the direction
of Mrs. Brandsten. The tests will be
given to all those women desiring to
go on the lake on Tuesday and Thurs
day at 3:10 o'clock.
After successfully passing the test
a woman gets a qualification card
from the Gymnasium department, with
a number to present to the life guard
at the lake. Lagunita is closed to any
students not possessing a qualification
number.
The matter of going on the lake
without passing the test is regulated
by the Honor System. The precaution
that is being taken in not permitting
students who cannot pass the require
ments for the canoe test is a direct
result of the tragedies that have oc
curred on the lake in the past. The
canoe test was installed to prevent
any similar tragedies in the future,
and is a safeguard to the students
themselves.
Canoe tests for women consist of
the following:
1. 200-yard swim with no limitation
on style or time involved.
2. 40-foot swim under water ( this
is the width of the women's pool).
3. Recover a weight from a 9-foot
depth of water.
Tests are given Tuesday and Thurs
day, 3:10 to 3:20, beginning next week.
Open swimming hours for women
for practice are:
Monday and Wednesday, 5 to 5:45.
Friday, 4:10 to 5:30.
Saturday, 10 to 11.
