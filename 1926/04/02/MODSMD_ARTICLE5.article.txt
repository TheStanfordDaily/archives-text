# TRYOUTS FOR DAILY STAFF TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER WEEK
## 
### 
Assignments were handed out to
thirty Daily Palo Alto tryoutees yes
terday, and today five were added
to the list of hopeful aspirants. This
makes a total of thirty-five tryoutees,
and with only a few positions open on
the staff, means that the competition
for those few places is exceedingly
strong.
Due to the increased interest in the
Daily in the past few years, as a stu
dent body activity, the staff is ever
growing larger, and the tryoutees more
numerous. The large number of try
outees makes it possible for the editor
to choose the best of them, and to
increase the quality of the work turned
out.
The prospective journalists are each
given stories on different subjects
every day. The men and women are
given different topics, all men work
ing on the same one, and the women
all working on the one given them.
Besides this, special feature assign
ments are given out in order to find
people who can write features, even
though they may not be particularly
proficient in writing straight news.
The tryoutees now working will con
tinue for one week, having daily meet
ings at 12:50 o'clock in the Press
building, and writing their assign
ments. The best few of them will be
picked to join the Daily staff.
