# BASEBALL COACHES STAGE GOLF BATTLE ON BERKELEY LINKS
## 
### 
An advance, or sham battle, will be
fought today between Harry Wolter
| and Carl Zamloch, coaches respective
-1 ly of the Stanford and California var
sity baseball teams which begin their
I annual series tomorrow. It too will be
' a ball game, but the instruments are
;to be golf clubs and the scene the
| Berkeley links.
Wolter is an ardent golfer and has
j turned in some low scores during the
! past season. He finds that swinging a
; bat to knock them out for the boys
and swinging a club are one and the
j same action.
Zamloch, too, is an ardent golf en
thusiast, but not in a class with Harry
according to the latter's own admis
sion. Wolter says he can trim Zamloch
at any form of the links game even to
using bats. He hopes to break the
spirit of the Hruin mentor with his
high-power golf and so have an edge
- on him tomorrow.
