# 1929 BALLPLAYERS TANGLE WITH CUBS ON VARSITY FIELD
## Coach Husky Hunt Believes Freshman Victory Is Assured 
### Calvin Behle 
Making their last campus appear
ance of the 1926 baseball season,
Coach Husky Hunt's babes will play
the California Cubs in the first game
i of the annual series tomorrow at 3:30
j o'clock on the varsity diamond. The
! game will be the only Stanford ball
| contest held this week on the campus,
jas the varsity meets California at
Berkeley.
Hunt is well pleased with his
| charges and is expecting another i
j Cardinal victory tomorrow in spite of j
I the fact that the 1929 ballplayers have
i just returned from a 16-day layoff. In
j practice yesterday, the infield proved
: itself to be a smooth-working outfit as '
j Harry Wolter, varsity coach, assisted |
; in directing the babe team. A short i
i hitting practice this afternoon ended ;
j training for the season. j
McKey, Wilton, and Davis, the most
| dependable freshman outfield, will'
start in the first game, according to
Hunt. All three are reliable fielders,
and Wilton especially has shown hit
, ting ability during the last few days.
Two changes have been made in the
I infield, with Wright now playing first
and Spud Harder at third. McCandless,
| although running Wright a close race,
has been handicapped by the late bas
i ketball season and has not been hit-
I
I ting as consistently as his rival. Rog-
I ers at short, Hartley at second, and
! Brown behind the plate, with either
Lewis or Kern pitching, will also start
i for the babes.
I Burt King, coach of the Bruin Cubs,
j has been handicapped by injuries to
j two of his leading pitchers, Green
j fielder and Jacobsen. The burden of
; the mound work will fall on Johnson
| and Schafer. Although the start of the
j season saw the Blue and Gold players
I rather weak in fielding, notable im
provement has marked the babes' work
in this department of the game. The
I big threat of the California players
J lies in their hitting ability, with the
j outfielders in particular producing the
j offensive drive.
The probable lineups are as follows:
I California —Norton, second base; Betz,
j right field; Cavalero, center field; Ste
i venson, first base; Sorocco, left field;
I Swenson, shortstop; Cook, third base;
ißoberts, catcher; Johnson and Schafer,
j pitchers. Stanford —Hartley, second
j base; Wright, first base; Roger, short
j stop; Harder, third base; Kern and
i Lewis, pitchers; McKey, left field;
Wilton, center field; Davis, right field;
Brown, catcher.
