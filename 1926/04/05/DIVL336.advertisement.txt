Ernest Lubitsch, Master Direc
tor, triumphs again in his latest
production
#
Lady Windermere's Fan
From the play by Oscar Wilde,
with Irene Rich, Ronald Cole
man, May McAvoy, Bert Lytell.
A screen classic if ever there
was one! Adapted from a world
famous play that has thrilled
countless thousands for three de
cades. The whole nation is ac
claiming this great picture of
fervid romance and gay comedy,
and we can add, without fear of
contradiction, that you have
never really seen these great
stars at their best until you have
seen them work under Lubitsch,
the screen's directorial genius.
