Friendship Week for Encina Club
members and other freshmen began
today when officers of the club passed
out "Hello" cards and launched a con
certed drive to get everybody ac
quainted. A short business meeting is
to be held tonight, at which further
plans will be announced and a new
Encina Club constitution will be voted
on.
This is the last opportunity that
members of the Class of 1929 will have
to get acquainted with each other, as
rushing will begin next week. Cards
have been printed upon which the
bearer's name and home town will be
writteu, so that everyone will be able
to know who everyone else is. Accord
ing to L. Frderick Thon, Encina Club
president, the committee has spent
quite a bit of time planning the events
of the week, and hopes to put the pro
gram over with the aid of all the
freshmen.
