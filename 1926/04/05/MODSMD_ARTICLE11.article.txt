# PRESENTATION OF "STABAT MATER" PROVES INSPIRING
## 
### 
An impressive and inspiring pre
sentation of Anton Dvorak's oratorio
"Stabat Mater" was given last Friday
night by the University Choir assisted
by off-campus artists and forty mem
bers of the San Francisco Symphony
all under the direction of Warren D.
Allen. Dvorak's great setting of the
old Latin hymn proved continually
melodious throughout its entire length
of over an hour, and though it, in com
mon with other oratorios, contained
continual repetition and reiteration,
there was not an instant when the
musical interest was allowed to flag.
The orchestra added immensely to
the impressiveness and dignity of the
presentation. The brass instruments
supported and blended with the voices
gave an effect of grandeur and bril
liance. The climaxes filled the church
with a tremendous body of sound.
The four soloists performed very
effectively in their various solos and
duets. Mr.Victor Vogel, the bass, sang
the fourth number in an unusually
rich and pleasing voice.
The work was arranged in ten
groups with different vocal combina
tions in each. In magnitude and appeal
each seemed to be the peer of all the
others. It gave the impression of being
a symphony with the added beauty
and tonal possibilities of the human
voice.
The appropriateness of the compo
sition seemed to be its most outstand
ing merit. It contrived to be deep, even
tragic in spots, without losing its won
derful beauty of melody and splendid
instrumentation.
