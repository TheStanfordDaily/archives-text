# VICTOR COMPANY ASKS GLEE CLUB TO MAKE RECORD
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club has re
ceived marked recognition by an
invitation from the Victor Talk
ing Machine Company requesting
the Cardinal singers to make a
record of Stanford songs for
them. The offer is in the hands of
Linn Winterbotham, manager of
the club, and prompt action will
be taken upon it. The recording
staff of the company will be on
the coast during the latter part
of this month. The record would
probably consist of a medley of
distinctive Stanford airs, such as
"Come Join the Band," "Sons of
the Stanford Red," "The Cardi
nal Is Waving," "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," and others, and would be
on sale at music stores all over
the country.
The Glee Club will give its
home concert in the Assembly
hall the evening of April 16, with
Max Dolin and his California trio,
and Harry Robertson, tenor, a
former Stanford man, as soloists.
