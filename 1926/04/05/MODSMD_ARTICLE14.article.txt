# YEARLING TRACKMEN FAVORED TO WIN CALIFORNIA MEET
## Bear Cubs Sure of Firsts Only In Jumps in Contest On Saturday 
### 
Although no fast times or great dis
tances were achieved when Dink Tem
pleton's yearling trackmen partici
pated in their final "official" workout
before the California contest, every
one performed satisfactorily enough to
show just what the Gold and Blue
would be up against.
Dopesters are unanimous in their
opinion that the Stanford aggregation
will turn in a victory by the safe mar
gin of at least twelve or fifteen points,
and although not much is known of
the strength of the California squad,
comparative times and scores of (he
two teams indicate the superior
strength of the Cards.
Gooden loped through a slow 5:05
mile in the race Friday, with Jost not
far behind. With Gooden capable of
4:44, a first in this event seems prac
tically assured, while Joat and Conner
will probably take a second and a
third between them.
Syer and Berry, Stanford sprinters,
are two good men of equal ability.
Berry nosed Syer out by inches Friday
in the century in the good time of
10:2. Syer won the furlong by an
equally close margin. It is a toss-up as
to which of the two will break the tape
next Saturday.
Middle Distance Strong
Captain McKinnon took the half
mile with little difficulty in 2:03 with
Clum close on his heels. With more
time to train Clum might push McKin
non Saturday, but he has been trou
bled with shin-splints. It seems pos
sible that the Cards will finish one-two
three in this event with French trail
ing not far behind McKinnon and,
Club.
Dales broke the tape in the 440. turn
ing in 52.3. Moss ran him a pretty race
but did not have the strong finish of
the winner.
Nelson and Edmends who run the
hurdles, should garner points in the
Cal meet. Carlev and Marks seem to
be the best bets in the 8-lap grind.
Marks showed up exceptionally well
Friday when he finished close to Car
ley, who broke the tape at 10:52.
The California freshmen have not
done over 11 feet in the pole vault so
far this season. Eight points and pos
sibly 9 are probable for Stanford in
this event with Edmonds doing 12 feet.

The weights are one of Stanford's
strongest events with Fleishacker and
Tandy both heaving the shot around
42 feet and throwing the discus for
good distance. Sparling has little or
no competition in the javelin, consist
ently throwing it around 165 feet.
California's outstanding event is the
broad jump. With a jumper capable
of 21 feet 6 inches, they easily out
shine the Card junipers. This event
and the high jump are the only first
places conceded to the California first
year men.
