# An Unpleasant Situation
## 
### 
A wise step was taken by President Wilbur this morning when he re
fused to accept the proposal of the U.S.C. administration relative to the un
pleasantness which occurred at the track meet with the southern institu
tion Saturday. As the communication between the two college presidents
indicates, Stanford had no legal grounds on which to prevent the compe
tition of Ralph Shawhan, star Trojan miler. All protests must be sub
mitted at least seven days following the exchange of eligibility lists ac
cording to the Conference rulings.
The concensus of opinion is that U.S.C. before Saturday morning was
as ignorant of the miler's ineligibility as were the Stanford officials. How
ever, the editor is rather inclined to believe that although U.S.C. was
legally justified in allowing Shawhan to compete, the matter could have
been settled more satisfactorily.
if Shawhan is actually ineligible, as every indication leads one to be
lieve, he will not be able to participate in any more meets this season; and
U.S.C. will benefit little by its victory Saturday. In a doubtful situation
it seems that the wiser thing to do is to play the benevolent rival.
Nothing can harm intercollegiate athletics more than these occasional
unpleasant happenings. Thousands of spectators left the Stadium Satur
day with a decidedly unpleasant taste. It would have been far better if
Stanford had made no public announcement of Shawhan's ineligibility;
and had disclosed the facts only to the Trojans.
