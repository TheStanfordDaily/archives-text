# Student Criticism.
## 
### 
On looking over certain phases of modern college administration one
is tempted to remark that the student himself is being given, or is taking,
more of a grip on the helm than in decades gone by. Perhaps suitable
perspective is lacking from this editor's chair but it is hard to conceive of
any university in 1906 asking its undergraduates to recommend changes
in the curriculum and then accepting certain of the recommendations
finally made as was recently done at Dartmouth.

Experience and maturity are naturally the prime requisites for leader
ship. Professors have long asked for individual opinions on moot ques
tions in their subjects, however, and it is only inevitable that now con
certed moves have been made over the country for the incorporation of
student ideas in university administration. While master is 95 per cent
qualified to point out to pupil the correct road in study and thought, there
is always the possibility of five per cent error which might be corrected by
help from the pupil.
Dartmouth became one of the leaders in the movement by its adoption
of the New Study plan suggested after an examination of other university
systems by a score of Dartmouth undergraduates and two-hundred page
report by them. This was followed by the attempt at criticism of cur
ricula in the editorial columns of college newspapers over the United
States. An example of this discussion was reviewed in the Daily last
week in the survey of the "Critic-orials" of the University of Washington.
Now come other developments in the desire of students to help govern.
At Rutgers the editor of The Targum has made the suggestion that " — a
young instructor sit on faculty committees, monopolized at present by the
old men." The former is to gain his position, it seems, only if he has re
cently been an undergraduate and has not lost the student's viewpoint. At
Yale an investigation is under way, sponsored by the Yale News, to dis
cover why men choose that university for their Alma Mater. The results
of the investigation are to be used in an attempt to make the education and
economic background of the student-body more interesting and profitable.
Regardless of the mode or method, student participation should be in
some degree helpful. Mistakes will be made due to over-eagerness and in
experince but from the mass of ideas should come a few worthy of con
sideration,
