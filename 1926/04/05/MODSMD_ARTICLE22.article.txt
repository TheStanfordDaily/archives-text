OUR AGED ORACLE SPEAKS
There is an old man, gray of head, whose lace is filled with wrinkles,
He dwells alone, all by himself; his pale eye seldom twinkles.
They call him Age. the Oracle, because his ways are wise,
And many come to bear Jjim speak, and listen to his cries.
One day, a fellow came to him, advice he wanted badly,
He seemed so hungry and forlorn —and thus he spake, and madly:
"Oh, father, Stanford is my home and I am sad and dreary,
Because I've got to get my meals on campus—l am weary ....
"There's beans, and beef that's a la mode; there's pork and applesauce,
Vienna loaf, filet of sole —more like a slice of hoss.
"You never get what you would like, and so you leave the Caf,
And try the eating halls —but, gee, they're not so good by half!
"So, father, I have come to you and raise this mournful beller.
Since I have found no worth extant, where shall I try—the Cellar?"
In horror cried the aged seer, "My son, don't be so foolish!
I have a tale to tell to you—a tale that's foul and ghoulish!
"I once was young and gay like you and troubled with the grub;
Like you, I thought I'd try a change, Oh, God, I was a dub!
"Just seventy years ago I went and ordered in the Cellar,
And when I left the darksome place, I was this aged feller.
"My son, be patient with your food, but if you want my fate,
Just try the service, 'Down Below'; now you perambulate."
The youngster didn't think it true, and ordered, and then set
And waited —and for all I know, the sap is waiting yet! ! —L.A.B.

We see that spring vacation has cancelled at the University of Idaho
because it is feared students returning from home OR ELSEWHERE will
bring spinal meningitis to the campus.
Cyrus Buzlow also says:
This new spinal meningitis step must be a lot worse than the Charleston or
the St. Louis if they take such measures as that to keep it from getting into
style on the campus.
