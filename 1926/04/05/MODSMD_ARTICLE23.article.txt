Men are better looking than women.
This opinion was stated by Profes
j sor Frank L. Kleeberger, chairman of
■ the department of physical education
for men of the University of California,
| who hastily qualified his statement
! with an explanation of what he means
1 by "better looking."
"Beauty is more or less indefinable;
'but the basis I accept is general vigor
and appearance," he says. "This qual
ity the men have, but many women
l lack. Our girls are handicapped in the
matter of getting the exercise and
J training which comes almost auto-
I matically to the boy which would de
| velop these essential qualities.

"Men have another advantage over
women in the matter of appearance,
and that is their lack of use of cos
; metics," Professor Kleeberger avers.
"Many women make themselves ridicu
lous or grotesque by overdoing their
use of make-up. They may be perfectly
nice persons otherwise, but smeared
and made so thoroughly artificial they
are impossible."
Cosmetics used in small amounts
|and with good taste he regards as an
asset to appearance. He deplores the
tendency of young girls to follow style
so closely that they even adopt dif
ferent types of walks that are slouchy
j find unattractive.
