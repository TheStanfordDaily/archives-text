Dr. William Dinsmore Briggs, head
of the English department, has recent
ly returned from a vacation spent trav
eling in southern Europe. He visited
Vienna and Florence, later going to
Sicily and Africa.
His trip was planned with the defi
nite object of being a vacation, but |
according to Dr. Briggs, "Traveling for
pleasure is really very hard work. 1
met one woman in Italy who said to i
me with a good deal of vehemence that ,
she wished she were home. 'I've been
traveling here for pleasure for over a
year now, and I am dead tired, and I j
want to go home'."
While Dr. Briggs was in Italy, he
witnessed the funeral of the late !
queen-mother. Dr. Briggs says, "The j
Italian people witnessed a deep sorrow j
for her death. They felt a very warm !
affection for her. Her death marks a -
historical changeâ€”she was a connect
ing link between the old regime and 1
the new."
