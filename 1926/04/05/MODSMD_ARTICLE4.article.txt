# BABE NINE LOSES OPENING GAME OF U.C. SERIES 7 TO 3
## California Freshmen Garner Three Runs in Sixth To Win Game 
### 
As a result of failing to deliver
when needed the freshmen lost to the
California Cubs last Saturday by* a
score of 7 to 3 in the first game of
the annual series between the two
teams. Stanford started off with a rush
to knock the Cub pitcher's delivery
for two runs in the first inning, while
they shut out the Bruin babes during
their turn at the bat.
The California freshmen proceeded
to even things up in their half of the
second and both teams rang up a tally
in the third. Two scoreless innings
followed; the Stanford players failed
to take advantage of their opportuni
ties and scored no runs.
Sixth Is Lucky
The sixth inning took the place of
the lucky seventh as far as the Bear
Cubs were concerned, for they hit
Doug Lewis' offerings safely and, with
the aid of an error or two, tallied three
runs to put the game on ice. They
rang up their last marker in the ninth.
Lewis, the Cardinal twirler, pitched
a fair game of ball but his teammates
did not give him the support that his
band of hurling deserved. He struck
out seven men and walked only one,
which is a nice record to turn in.
Shaffer, the Cub pitcher, struck out
ten batters, but he also walked five
men. His teammates only committed
three miscues in the field however, as
compared with Stanford's six. In addi
tion to this, the Bruin freshmen got
nine hits.
This was the first game of the an
nual series. The next contest will be
played Saturday at Berkeley.
