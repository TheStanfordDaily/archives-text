# NEW DAILY STAFF MEMBERS WILL BE CHOSEN ON FRIDAY
## 
### 
Friday's Daily Palo Alto will an
nounce several new additions to the j
editorial staff of the paper, which will
be chosen after the tryoutees have
completed a week of news and feature
writing. Thirty-five candidates are
meeting on the second floor of the
Press building every day at 12:50 to
receive assignments and turn in work
already completed.
Quality of work and amount of time j
spent in the office are the two things I
upon which the tryoutees will be i
judged. With the present size of the'
Daily staff, no students are overbur- J
dened with heavy beats and the work
can be so distributed that all have
time to do their writing in a more;
satisfactory manner. Thus it is more |
important for the tryoutees to turn in |
well-written news stories than a large
quantity of poorly-written material
that has to be read and re-read by the
copy-reader.
Thirty-eight students are now try
ing out for positions on the editorial j
staff. Most of these are freshmen. j
