# CALIFORNIA WINS FIRST TILT FROM STANFORD NINE
## Consistency of Bear Pitcher Is Deciding Factor in Close Game 
### Herb Klein 
California varsity ballplayers won a
3 to 1 victory in the first game of the
Stanford series held Saturday after
noon on the Berkeley diamond, mainly
through the consistent pitching of
Park and errors by the Cards, which
accounted for two of the Bears' runs.
The game was much closer than the
score would indicate, both teams play
ing a high grade of ball except for a
few slip-ups. The difference lay chiefly
that Stanford's mistakes let runs score.

Sobieski was on the mound for all
j nine innings and allowed only five hits,
! though his record was not as clean
as that of the Bruin pitcher, who held
Stanford to five safeties. Singles were
the best that California could get off
! the Count's pitching. A clean three
! bagger by Busch in the second inning
' was the best hit in the game and gave
the Cards their only run when Gari
baldi, the next man up, singled.
Bears Even Score
This was the first score of the game,
| but the advantage did not long stay
with Stanford. In the last half of the
same inning both Lloynd and Doughit
of California got singles and Captain
Cuddeback, in a play intended to catch
! Lloynd off third, missed Svpher's
I throw. Both Bear runners profited by
S the error to cross the plate.
I Stanford batters were able to get
i only two hits during the rest of the
| game and didn't get past second base.
Cards Fail in Ninth
I In the ninth inning Bill Clark went
! out on a fly to right field. Draper, who
J followed him, fanned. Sypher got to
| first on a fumble by Tait, the Bruin
| third baseman. Nissen next got a clean
| single. Busch took a mighty swing at
the ball, but hit it right into the hands
of Dixon, California left fielder, and
j the game was over.
In the seventh inning California had
i the bases loaded with no men out, and
: once again with one man out, but
' were able to cross the plate only once.
Airtight playing by Wolter's men pre
i vented further scoring.
U.C. Slugger Goes Hitless
Dixon, California's highly touted
slugger, was unable to get any hits
and had to try bunting. Park made a
good record in batting as well as in
i pitching by getting two hits out of
three times up. Lloynd, Bruin catcher,
also hit twice, so that four of the six
California hits came from their bat
| tery.
