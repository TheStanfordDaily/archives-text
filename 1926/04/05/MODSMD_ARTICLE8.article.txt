# Ineligibility Of U.S.C. Miler Will Not Be Pressed
## 
### 
The question of the eligibility of
Ralph Shawhan, University of South
ern California mile runner, will not
be allowed to change the results of
Saturday's track meet, which Southern
California won 67% to 63%, as far
as Stanford athletic authorities are
concerned.

Replying to a telegram from Presi
dent R. B. von KleinSmid asking that
Shawan's entry be disqualified and the
points be adjusted, following discovery
of irregularities in his eligibility a few
hours prior to the meet, President Wil
bur wired the Southern institution to
day asking that the incident be
dropped.

The question of Shawan's ineligibil
ity was brought up shortly before the
meet Saturday, and Professor W. B.
Owens, Stanford conference repre
sentative, agreed to allow the Southern
athlete to compete, inasmuch as no
protest had been entered ten days
prior to the contest, which is required
under conference rules. Disqualifica
tion of Shawan would have resulted in
a G6% to 64y 2 victory for Stanford.
Following is Dr. von KleinSmid's
telegram:
"Our director of intercollegiate
athletics and general manager of
the Student have reported in
the case of Ralph Shawhan. In the
absence of a Southern California
faculty representative the case was
submitted to your Mr. Owens. He
ruled that Shawhan was entitled to
compete in the meet on the ground
that the time for protest had passed
under the conference rules. He felt
that Shawhan should bo excluded from
future competition. Both institutions
were unaware of the facts of the case
previous to the morning of the meet.
While we highly esteem the courtesy
of Stanford, our managers feel, and I
concur to their opinion that the com
petitio nof Shawhan be disregarded
and the matter of awarding second
and third places in the mile event be
referred to the referee of the meet
April 3. Sorry I could not accept your
invitation to attend the meet.
"Sincerely yours,
"R. B. VON KLEINS Mil}."

points be adjusted, following discovery
of irregularities in his eligibility a few
hours prior to the meet, President Wil
bur wired the Southern institution to
day asking that the incident be
dropped.

The question of Shawan's ineligibil
ity was brought up shortly before the
meet Saturday, and Professor W. B.
Owens, Stanford conference repre
sentative, agreed to allow the Southern
athlete to compete, inasmuch as no
protest had been entered ten days
prior to the contest, which is required
under conference rules. Disqualifica
tion of Shawan would have resulted in
a G6% to 64y 2 victory for Stanford.
Following is Dr. von KleinSmid's
telegram:
"Our director of intercollegiate
athletics and general manager of
the Student have reported in
the case of Ralph Shawhan. In the
absence of a Southern California
faculty representative the case was
submitted to your Mr. Owens. He
ruled that Shawhan was entitled to
compete in the meet on the ground
that the time for protest had passed
under the conference rules. He felt
that Shawhan should bo excluded from
future competition. Both institutions
were unaware of the facts of the case
previous to the morning of the meet.
While we highly esteem the courtesy
of Stanford, our managers feel, and I
concur to their opinion that the com
petitio nof Shawhan be disregarded
and the matter of awarding second
and third places in the mile event be
referred to the referee of the meet
April 3. Sorry I could not accept your
invitation to attend the meet.
"Sincerely yours,
"R. B. VON KLEINS Mil}."

President Wilbur's telegram follows:
"Thank you for your most Consider
ate telegram. We feel that there 'was
good faith on both sides and that the
lists of participants accepted a few
days before the meet should be con
sidered final. Questions of eligibility
arising at the last minute on indivi
duals are not conducive to the best re
sults. We should prefer to have the
incident dropped."
