# FRESHMAN TENNIS PLAYERS TAKE TWO SINGLES MATCHES
## 
### 
With two victories and one defeat
in the three singles matches completed
Saturday against the freshman tennis
team of the University of California
before rain halted the play, the Stan
ford yearlings are heavy favorites to
win the meet when two doubles games
are played on the Berkeley courts
Wednesday afternoon.

John Wheatley, premier Cardinal I
racquet-wielder, scored one victory in
a long encounter with Richard Hoogs, i
Blue and Gold star, 6-3, 9-7. Through- j
out the match service was the deciding >
factor. The games alternated regu- j
larly in the initial set until a score of
3-all had been reached. At this point
Wheatley captured his own delivery,
; followed it with I-loog's, and repeated
J with his own to take the set. The sec-1
| ond set was more hotly contested, j
j Hoogs increased the speed of his
i serves until they were most difficult i
jto handle, and several times threat- ;
j ened to break through Wheatley's ser- j
j'vice. After 14 games of fierce battling
i he weakened, dropping two successive |
I games and the match.
Captain Shirly Ward, of the Bruina, j
J proved too strong for Ernest Renzel, ]
winning 8-6, 7-5. Renzel played his:
| usual heady game, but steady playing
|by his opponent effected his defeat.
: The games were very close, many of
them going to deuce again and again.
David Robb gained the second Stan- 1
ford victory in a long struggle witn
i John Chasseur, G-4, 1-6, 10-8. The third
j set was completed on a court slippery
! and puddled from a steady drizzle. The
ball deled all known laws, skidding
land sliding about in a most perplexing]
manner. Robb played undaunted,
I through it all, and by remarkable 1
I steadiness eventually won the water-;
j soaked match, giving Stanford a two
! to-one lead.
Wednesday afternoon Wheatley and
j Robb will oppose Hoogs and Ward in
| the first doubles contest, while Lyndon
Farwell and Lawrence Hall will up
i hold the Cardinal in the second dou-
I bles match.
