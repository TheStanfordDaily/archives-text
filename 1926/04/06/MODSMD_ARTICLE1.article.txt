# CHANGE IN METHOD OF TEAM CAPTAINCY ELECTION POSSIBLE
## MOTION WILL BE MADE Ex Committee Will Discuss Suggestion at Meeting In Union Tonight 
### 
In the future the captains of athletic
teams may not be elected in advance;
but at the end of the season's competi
tion an honorary leader will be chosen
for the season just passed, if a motion
to be introduced at the Executive Com
mittee meeting at 8 o'clock this eve
ning in the A.S.S.U. office receives
the sanction of this body.
According to Robert W. Lewis, presi
dent of the Associated Students, the
committee is desirous of receiving stu
dent opinion 011 the matter before ac
tion is taken; and. therefore, students
who have ideas to express on the in
novation are urged to take advantage
of the provision in the constitution of
the A.S.S.U. which declares that the
meetings of the committee are open
10 any members of the student body
who desire to attend.
At the present time the captain for
lhe 1926 season is elected at the close
of the 1925 season. The new plan
would have the captain for the 1926
season elected at the close of the 1926
season. The position would be chiefly
honorary for before each contest dur
ing the course of competition the
coach of the squad would designate
?ome player to act as the field leader.
