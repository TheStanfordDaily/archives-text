# STUDENT ATTITUDE HERE GOOD, SAYS VISITING PROFESSOR
## 
### 
That he had "noticed nowhere a
| better student attitude" was one of
j the significant observations about
i Stanford made by James Fred Rippy,
j acting associate professor of history,
j here for the spring quarter, when he
told in an interview some of his im-
I pressions of the University received
j since his arrival from the University
of Chicago. Rippy is taking the classes
j of Professor Percy A. Martin, now on
a leave of absence.
Professor Rippy's remarks were
! brief, but gave a favorable comparison
j between Stanford and the University
of Chicago, one of the world's fore
most educational institutions.
"I know of no campus," he said,
"which can equal your buildings, not
even Chicago. Your library is better
arranged than that of Chicago, but
I contains only about half as many vol-
I umes, I believe." Professor Rippy will
j carry on researches in the library on
foreign relations of the Latin-Ameri
i can countries.
While the student body at Chicago
numbers 6000, the classes there are
|on an average smaller than Stanford
j classes, Professor Rippy said.
Courses in the history of Mexico
and the history of South America are
being conducted by Professor Rippy.
He has held a chair in history at
Chicago since 1920, when he received
the degree of doctor of philosophy
from the University of California.
