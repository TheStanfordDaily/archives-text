# Final Selection Made For Junior Opera By Parks
## 
### 
Last selection of the cast for the
1927 Junior Opera to be presented in
the Assembly hall May 8 was made
last night by Charles Parks, director.
The leads are distributed between four
people, Velma Randall, as Connie;
Aileene Burks, as Joan; William
Pabst, as Will; and Alonzo Cass, Jr.,
as Larry. The cast will meet in the
Little Theatre at 7 o'clock tonight for
first rehearsal.
All members of the cast have had
considerable experience on the Stan
ford stage and are familiar to campus
theatregoers. Lucie Bentley has been
seen on the stage earlier this year,
and will play the other feminine role,
as Diana. The eccentric old English
peer. Sir Roderick, will be portrayed
by Cecil Doll, who has played two
character parts this year, in the
sophomore play, "In the Next Room,"
and in "Fashion."
Other character parts are being
played by John Truman, the Patriarch,
George Bogue as Bullington, the boast
ful barrister, and George Mauser, who
takes the part of an excitable inn
keeper, Weems. Felton Kauffmann will
be one of the two Jewish solicitors.
The other solicitor has not yet been
chosen, and with Parks, the butler, and
Peter Dawson, constitutes the three
parts that have not yet been cast.
With a month in which to rehearse
the cast and chorus, the directors hope
to have the opera in a polished con
dition by May S. Clirysella Dunker will
work with the choruses on dancing
and will arrange the costuming. Jack
Wiggin, musical director, will handle
the solo and chorus singing, and Leon
ard Schwartz will assist Charles
Parks in the direction and details of
staging.
Tommy Breeze and Harry Boutell,
the authors of the script, have re
ceived constructive criticisms from
Gordon Davis, dramatic coach, and
Lester Seib, a former student now on
the professional stage in New York,
and have now finished touching up
the rough edges of the original work
into a well-written and admirably
staged continuity.
The final selection of the choruses
has been made. A new form of double
choruses, one male chorus for each
of the female ones, with eight mem
bers each, has been arranged by
Clirysella Kiler, who believes that,
with (he number of experienced peo
ple she has to work with, the dancing
and singing will be above the average
for Junior Operas.
