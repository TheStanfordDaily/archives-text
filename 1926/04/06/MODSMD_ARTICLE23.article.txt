# Should Captain Elections Be Postponed?
## 
### 
Robert W. Lewis, speaking on behalf of the Executive Committee, has
urged that all students exercise the prerogative granted them under the
constitution of the A.S.S.U. and attend the meeting of the committee to
night when it will discuss the proposal to alter the method of electing cap
tains. In the past and at present the captain for the season has been elected
in advance, the election being held at the close of the previous season of
competition.
The committee has already considered the new proposition, that is, that
no captain be elected in advance; but at the end of the season a man be
chosen who, in an honorary capacity, shall be known as the leader of the
retiring team. However, it is essential that before action is taken more
student opinion be heard.
The argument, as it will probably develop tonight, will be a fight of
practicability versus tradition. Both sides have strong cases.
On the practical side the opinion will be held that it is futile to endeavor
to choose in advance the outstanding performer for a season a year away;
and .that it is disagreeable to have a captain "benched." Ihe acting cap
tain who is selected by the coach before each contest will l>e the field leader;
and at the end of the season the most valuable man will be fittingly re
warded.
