# Fiesta Tryouts
## 
### 
Final tryouts for dancing groups in La Tiesta Lagunita will be held to
night at 7 o'clock in Roble gymnasium. All women desiring to take part
in the Fiesta, regardless of whether or not they have passed the first try
outs, must be present tonight.
The manuscript in its perfected form affords opportunity for a variety
of dances, ranging from the opening Minuet to the final lableau ot Mem
ories. All women are urged to try out for more than one group so that
the directors may choose those best fitted for the particular dances.
Cast tryouts will be held Thursday and Friday of this week. Every
one who is interested is urged to come out.
The Fiesta is essentially a project of Stanford women and this year
plans are being made to make it more elaborate than ever before. To make
the pageant a complete success, a finished production in every respect, the
co-operation of every Stanford woman is needed. There is opportuuitv
for every woman to take part.
