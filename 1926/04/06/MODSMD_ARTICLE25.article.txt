# A 						Leak in the Dike
## 
### 
In danger of losing its nightly frog chorus, the campus is in need of a
Dutch Boy Volunteer to stop the leak in Lagunita. Some few years ago,
according to the legend of the Netherlands, a little Hollander saved the
lands of his country from ruin by the simple expedient of making a plug
of his wee forearm. Stanford has no dike; but leakage from the campus
pond threatens to make a second lake on the outside of Lagunita's banks as
large and muddy as that inside the original banks.
Certain musically-inclined of the University have already complained
in the weakening of the bull-frog serenade. Moonlight sonatas 'neath
sorority and Roble windows do not compare in harmony, they declare, to
the Tadpole chorus of Lagunita.
Then, too, launching canoes and Ixxats from the boathouse is no longer
the simple matter of shoving them into the water from the pier's edge.
One needs must make a flying dive, it is reported, into the boat yards below
on the surface of the lake whose level has so recently fallen. The chances
are two to one that ladders will soon be provided for those wishing to
descend for a canoe ride.
