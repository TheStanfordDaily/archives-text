# The 						Kiss in the Dark

In so far as sorority rushing is all over but the hysterics, it is now safe,
even if not particularly discreet, to make an editorial comment or two on
the matter.
There is no doubt but what rushing, on the Stanford campus, has im
proved in the past few years, until it has nearly reached the stage where it
is a credit to the university. Last year saw secret pledging, and this year
brought an even rrtbre notable improvement, at least so far as the women
were concerned.
We refer to the absence of the front lawn oscular demonstration, once
the outstanding sight of the Spring quarter. It is, indeed, a marked im
provement to seethe nugget walk all the way to the door without being
showered by the caresses of the affectionate—the too affectionate—sisters.
It is to Ik.' hoped that this happy state of affairs is not marred by the
introduction of the practice of reaching out on the porch with boat hooks
to nab the prospect before she changes her mind.
Past infringements upon the rushing rules almost warrant this pessi
mistic prediction.
