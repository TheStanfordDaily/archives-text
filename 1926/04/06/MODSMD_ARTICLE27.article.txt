Stanford may win meet, as U.S.C. throws out points scored by ineligible
man.
"All together, boys! Loudly enough to be audible, but not enough to be
boisterous:

HISTORY OF THE McCUBBIN CLAN
VOL. II
(Editorial Note: The author hopes that his many kind readers will pardon
him for the slight interruption which has marred the narration of this history.
He wishes to explain that he simply took a short vacation, during which he
"gathered atmosphere," or, in simpler English, "got the air." Armed with new
material, gathered from intimate association with a number of well-known
McCubbins, he expects to start soon on the engrossing second volume of the
history of this remarkable family.)
Petunia McCubbin
Petunia, you remember, is the girl who left the McCubbin hearth to answer
the siren call of Hollywood's flickering fillums. Hers is the typical story of
the trials of an extra girl—a tale of ups and downs in Hollywood.
We first see Petunia reclining in her luxurious Hollywood Bungalow
(advertisement). She looks extremely comfortable, so comfortable, in fact,
that we will leave her there until Thursday.

POME OF PASHUN
Mary was as sweet a thing as you could ever hope to find,
And, where she walked, you'd see a score of broken hearts she'd left behind.
She ruled the roost and ran her crowd to suit her little self.
No man who came to gaze on her departed thence with all his pelf.
Young Oscar was the handsome boy whose record showed no blighting scar —
Perfection! When he started in, the ladies flocked from near and far!
He'd conquered many a maiden bold who thought to hard her poor heart.
To all his wiles —but, softening, they melted fast at Oscar's start.
As fate would have it, down the bay a lady had a brilliant thought—
House-party! With a youthful crowd, no further pleasure need be sought.
Of course, to make her list complete, she asked dear Oscar to attend —
And for his partner, Mary came —quite thoughtful of their mutual friend!
They both prepared to walk away and bear the palm of victory off;
Each one laid plants, and although warned, the warnings only got a scoff.
They met, and each begn to try his wiles to break the other's stand;
Each fished with bait that had not failed and each worked hard his fish to land.
Between them all the other folks were sick of them and filled with pain
To see these two show off their wares; the one —fat headed; 'tother —vain.
And so the two accomplished nought for neither one succumbed at all;
But both began to hate the one who simply wouldn't take a fall!
And so they wrecked the fun for each who came to have a hotsy time —
Such pests as these I'd like to shoot, or saddle with a heavy fine! —L.A.B.

HISTORY OF THE McCUBBIN CLAN
VOL. II
(Editorial Note: The author hopes that his many kind readers will pardon
him for the slight interruption which has marred the narration of this history.
He wishes to explain that he simply took a short vacation, during which he
"gathered atmosphere," or, in simpler English, "got the air." Armed with new
material, gathered from intimate association with a number of well-known
McCubbins, he expects to start soon on the engrossing second volume of the
history of this remarkable family.)
Petunia McCubbin
Petunia, you remember, is the girl who left the McCubbin hearth to answer
the siren call of Hollywood's flickering fillums. Hers is the typical story of
the trials of an extra girl—a tale of ups and downs in Hollywood.
We first see Petunia reclining in her luxurious Hollywood Bungalow
(advertisement). She looks extremely comfortable, so comfortable, in fact,
that we will leave her there until Thursday.
