# WOMEN MORE HEALTHY AFTER COLLEGE WORK, CLAIMS U.C. DOCTOR

What happens to the health of a
women who goes to college for four
years?
"She gains in general health and in
weight," answers Dr. Ruby L. Cunning
ham, head physician for women of the
University of California Infirmary. Dr.
Cunningham flouts the idea, now some
what current, that the college woman
experiences nervous breakdowns or
other ills as a result of her strenuous
pursuit of a degree.
Basing her opinion on an examina
tion made of fifth-year women students
who are candidates for teachers' cer
tificates, the physician indicated that
by far the largest number reported no
serious illnesses during their four
years of study, and further claimed to
feel better physically than at the time
of their entrance to college. In the
examination this spring, 218 prospec
tive teachers filled out questionnaires
and were given the examination.
The greatest factor in this improve
ment in health, Dr. Cunningham be
lieves, is the regularity of living. The
students eat meals at regular hours,
get sufficient sleep, and maintain a
fair balance of work and play that is
conducive to better physical health,
she says.
"By examining these students dur
ing the time they are engaged in their
practice teaching, we are aiding the
school children and communities by
assuring them of healthy teachers. Of
course, all teachers granted the certifi
cate at the end of five years are ex
amined," says Dr. Cunningham in
speaking of the purpose of the exami
nation. "Another good feature of the
plan is the advice on corrective meas
ures given to candidates who need it.
This will result in their better health
at the time they undertake the posi
tions."
