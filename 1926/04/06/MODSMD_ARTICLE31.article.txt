# "WHAT STANFORD DID TO ME" CHRONICLED BY WALLACE IRWIN
## 
### 
An interesting article appears in the |
April issue of College Huuior written
by Wallace Irwin, former Stanford
student. The article deals with Irwin's j
undergraduate days on the campus
under the title, "What College Did to
Me." It is an interesting article filled
full of early Stanford life as it was in
the time of the two years that Irwin
attended the University.
Varying from the conventional topic j
—what > college did for him —Irwin dis-j
cusses what college did to him —in an '
amusing and interesting fashion. He
credits Stanford with several things
but among them he does not give the i
University credit for his success as a
writer.
"College men's ways are not per- i
feet," says Irwin. "They have the
faults of the healthy male the world j
over. The undergraduate is not so ■
weirdly grotesque as the comic strips \
would have us believe, but he has all '
the absurdities of youth. And since
youth, like old age, is incurable, there's j
nothing that the Rockefeller Institute I
can do about it."
Irwin credits college with contri- i
buting many things that have stood ;
him in good stead in later life. First !
among these he mentions his ability j
to sleep with his eyes open—a trick !
learned in the lecture room. Exercise i
in will power is another great lesson j
that Irwin credits to his training in j
the classroom where he was forced to
be constantly alert although, he as
serts, the course was boring. Re
sourcefulness gained under the early
clay discipline of Encina hall is con- i
tributed by Irwin as being a third les- j
son learned at Stanford.
Quick judgment of men is another I
thing that college men learn rapidly j
but not accurately, cites Irwin in his
article. He gives the following advice j
to boys leaving for college as the ad-1
vice which he will impart to his own
sons when they leave for college:
"Try it if you have to. But if you do
the things that I did you're no sons j
of mine, that's all."
