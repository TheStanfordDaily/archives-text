### 
The National University of Mexico,
Mexico City, has announced its sched
ule for the next session of the Summer
School which will begin July 5, and
Â»-nd August 21. The courses offered
are broad in scope and are under the
direction of an excellent staff of pro
fessors. The work of the Summer
School is so planned as to correspond
with courses of a similar nature of
fered in leading American universi
ties, and the standard of instruction is
such that full credit is received at
American universities for work done
there.
The courses offered this year in
clude elementary, intermediate, and
advanced Spanish grammar, conversa
tion and composition; Hispano-Ameri
can literature; phonetics, general sur
vey courses on Mexico and Latin
America; Mexican history, archae
ology, art, customs and political prob
lems; commercial Spanish, and meth
ods of teaching Spanish. In a limited
number of these courses instruction
is given in the English language for
the benefit of Americans not having a
knowledge of Spanish. In addition,
professors from the College of William
and Mary, Virginia, will offer courses
in History of Spanish America, Diplo
matic Relations between the United
States and Spanish America, and Gov
ernments of Spanish America, as well
as several courses in college English.
Approximately four hundred Ameri
can students, representing almost
every state in the Union, attended the
last session of the Summer School. Ex
cursions under University supervision
were conducted to many places such
as the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon,
and the Caverns of Caca'humailpa.
Fiestas of various kinds were organ
ized for the visiting students, and
much was done to make their summer
in Mexico enjoyable and profitable.
The tuition fee will be $30, with a
substantial reduction to students tak
ing only one or two courses. There are
no library or matriculation fees.
Summer excursion tickets to Mexico
City and return will be on sale at
nearly all points in the United States
at greatly reduced rates. The hotels
of Mexico City offer to students a dis
count of from ten to twenty per cent.
