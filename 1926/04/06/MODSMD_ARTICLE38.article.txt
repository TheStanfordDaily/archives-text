# SPORTS OF 1926
## Grab It, Charley! 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
A letter recently received from Charley Paddock con
tains some interesting dope on the Sprint King's hopes of
establishing a new world's mark for 100 yards. He s.iys, in
part, "I feel like really running this year for the first time
since 1921. After the meets against Stanford and the
Olympic Club I expect to run against California, U.S.C.,
and in several match races, building up for the national
championships. Have it in mind to come East for the
intercollegiates and practice from then on till the last
week in June."
This, the third or fourth "come-back" of the colorful
Charley, may be looked upon by some as merely a publicity
getter for his later assaults upon the political records
(Charley is actually contemplating running for the Cali
fornia state legislature), but if Paddock can help to gain a
seat in that august body by running 100 yards in 9 2-sths

! seconds, why, sports at least should not complain.
Ever since Arthur Duffy ran his much-disputed 9 3-sths at the old Berkeley
! oval in May, 1902, sprinters the world over have been trying to "do" 9 2-sths.
| and no one has done it yet, in spite of Mr. Minoru Fujii's race in Tokio that
; same year. Which record, says the Tom Andrews book, was "sworn to by
j officials of Tokio University"—"and," adds Charley Paddock, "maybe he wore
I his rubbers, too!"
But anyway, it's quite interesting that this stormy petrel of the cinder-path ,
is running in earnest once more, and if you'll recollect that Charley ran 9 3-sths .
for the 100 and 20 4-sths for the 220 in 1924, which was "one of the years when r
1 he didn't really feel like running"—you'll agree that we may look for more j
j broken records from Paddock before he lays aside his spikes for good.
1 wonder how many youths of today will have the same chances that j
Paddock has had to travel and develop himself. Just think —since 1919, when I
he went to the Inter-Allied games in Paris and where he was actually knighted 1
I by the King of Montenegro, Charley has been back to Europe three times, j
\ twice to the Olympics and once when he ran in a Paris University meet in ;
; 1923 in spite of the Amateur Athletic Union's ban; he has taken numerous :
j trips up and down the Pacific Coast, gone to the Drake Relays, run in Hawaii,
j and last year, with Loren Murchison as a companion, completely circled the |
| globe. And add to this his numerous lecture trips throughout the length and i
j breadth of the land, and you'll agree with me that Sir Charles must have bor- !
| rowed this slogan from the United States Navy—"Be a sprinter, and see the i
! world!"
