# ENCINA HALL SIGN BRINGS BIG LAUGH BACK ON JOKESTERS
## 
### 
A sign bearing the words "Mu
seumâ€”FREE" has recently been
on display in one of the third
story windows on the front of
Kncina Hall. It attracted con
siderable attention among fresh
men, and shortly after it was put
up, a gentleman, bent on seeing
all the points of interest 011 the
campus, strolled into the lobby
and inquired his way to the ex
hibition rooms. He was taken
aback to learn that he had been
the object of a joke, but had a
quick comeback, replying that
had he had not been told, he
would have gone away satisfied
that the hall itself was the an
tique.
