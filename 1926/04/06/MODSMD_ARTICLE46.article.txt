# CHILDREN AT HOME SURPRISED TO SEE SUNRISE EACH DAY
## 
### 
Children at the Convalescent Home,
with the return of good weather, are
again able to take daily sun baths,
and to remain outdoors most of the
time. According to Miss E. L. Spandy,
superintendent of the Home, some of
the children from the city have never
seen the sunrise before. "We have dif
ficulty in convincing them it happens
every morning," she said.
The Home is now filled to capacity,
with about forty children chosen from
around the bay region and San Fran
cisco. They are selected from hospitals
and clinics, on the basis of age and
severity of illness. Attempts are made
to find children whose original illness
has begun to mend and who are
chiefly in need of rest, fresh air, sun
shine, and abundant diet, but who
still require careful medical and nurs
ing supervision and bed rest.
The need of convalescent care by
the community is most clearly shown
by the figures of occupancy. Although
there are always a few delays, due to
the intervals between the dismissal
of one patient, and the admission of
another, and the extra delay here
where the children are brought some
thirty-five miles, the fact that the oc
cupancy is about 98 per cent is a
striking proof of the value of the
Home.
The Home is organized into two
units —the McLaughlin unit, where the
bed patients are kept, and the Stan
ford unit, which is occupied by walk
ing patients. Here they receive some
schooling, and physical activities form
an important part of their convale
scence. A large part of the day is
spent 011 the playground, which is
equipped with swings, see-saws, and
playhouses.
The problems that the Convalescent
Home meets in its patients are many
and varied —not all simply questions
of the physical welfare of their
charges, or the routine care of bed
patients. A no less important part of
the work has been the training of
children, in hygiene, cleanliness, care
of the teeth, hair, and nails, and cor
rect food habits. Most of the children
come from poor homes and have never
been accustomed to eating green vege
tables, or drinking milk.
While at the Home everything is
provided except shoes and a tooth
brush. Wardrobes consist of coveralls
for the week, and Sunday clothes.
Lately rubber boots and raincoats
have been purchased for the children
to be worn in rainy weather.
