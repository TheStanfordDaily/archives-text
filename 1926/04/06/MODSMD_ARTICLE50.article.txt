# Oregon University Building New Basketball Pavilion
## 
### 
Construction will be started about
May 1 on the University of Oregon's
new $175,000 basketball pavilion which
will seat 7338 and with the possible
addition of a balcony will seat 9040.
The building will be completed by the
last of October, fully a month before
it will be needed for practice.
The building will be of concrete con
struction. A spring floor similar to
the Stanford gymnasium will be in
stalled and an indirect lighting system
is to be used. The floor will be 104
feet by 158 feet, sufficient for three
courts of regulation size. There will
be twelve exits in addition to the two
main entrances.
The seats will be arranged in the
shape of an arena and very few will
be behind the backboard. There will
be standing room for 3000, thus mak
ing the capacity about 12,000 when
the balcony is added.
