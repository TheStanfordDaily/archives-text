## 
### 
For a period of six weeks, all men
at the University of Nebraska are al
lowed to let their beards grow un
shorn. During this trying period for
the University women, the campus re
sembles a meeting ground of old forty
niners and ex-hofse thieves.
For the last two weeks no woman
student dares leave her house after
dark unguarded; no man goes without
his weapons. At the end of the six
weeks, the man with the longest and
best-spread bushy growth receives a
silver cup. Last year the contest was
won by a sophomore, but the commit
tee in charge believes that competi
tion will be much keener this year
than last.
After the close of the contest tradi
tion allows only seniors to appear on
the campus with a mustache.
The faculty committee on conduct at
Linfield have requested that fraterni
ties and sororities do away with all
the "rough stuff" and the public part
of the initiations.
Randolph-Macon is the only college
in the South that allows the codch to
