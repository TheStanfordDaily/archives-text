# HAROLD GLEASON IS SOLOIST IN ORGAN PROGRAM TONIGHT
## 
### 
Harold Gleason, head of the Organ
Department of the new Eastman
School of Music in Rochester, New
York, will give a recital in the Me
morial Church tonight at 7:30 o'clock,
The concert will be under the auspices
of the Committee on Public Exercises.
Gleason has a wide reputation as mas
ter of organ playing.
His program will be varied and com
plete, ranging from compositions by
Frescobaldi, a sixteenth century musi
cian, to the works of Edward Shippen
Barnes, Charlies Marie Widor, and
other contemporary musicians.
Some of the more notable works on
his program will be "Choral in A
Minor" by Cesar Franck, "Canon in B
Minor" by Robert Schumann, and
"Variations in E Minor" by Joseph
Bonnet.
Gleason is one of the foremost of
the younger school of American organ
ists which includes such artists as
Pietro Yon, Charles Courbin, and
Lynnwood Farnam. The latter was
heard here last October.
The program will be remarkable for
the fact that Gleason plays entirely
from memory. No score will be used
for any of the thirteen varied numbers
on tonight's program.
