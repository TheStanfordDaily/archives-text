# VARSITY NINE HAS SECOND BERKELEY CONTEST SATURDAY
## McGUIRE ON FIRST BASE Weather Prevents Cardinal Team from Getting Needed Practice 
### Herb Klein 
A soggy diamond and rainy weather
has prevented Harry Wolter and the
varsity baseball squad from getting a
workout this week in preparation for
the second California contest which
will be held at West field, Berkeley,
next Saturday afternoon. The practice
during the last couple of days could
have been used to good advantage by
the entire team because last Satur
day's game showed many rough spots
in individual playing that needed
working on.
The return of McGuire to the game
will strengthen the nine at first base.
McGuire has been out because of an
infection but should be in great shape
by next Saturday.
California's 3 to 1 victory last week
was in no way indicative of a decidedly
superior Bruin team. In fact it con
firmed Harry Wolter's prediction that
while California would have a first
class team, Stanford's would be at
least as good. Individual errors on the
part of the Cards presented the Blue
and Gold players with two of their
three runs. If Wolter's men can get
their batting to the point where it ful
fills early-season promises, at the same
lime eliminating infield errors, there
is no reason why the second game
should not go to Stanford.
Last year the Cards lost the first
game of the series by a score of 27 to
5, and then with the rest of the games
apparently mere formalities, came
back and won the last two in impres
sive fashion. It is nothing new for
Harry Wolter to be coming through
Avith a win when it seems to be im
possible. With the even showing made
in the first game this year there is
plenty of reason to hope that the
series will yet go to Stanford.
