# Form Cards for Rushing Are Available Tonight
## 
### 
The first set of form cards for dates
with freshmen will be given to fra
ternities tonight from 8 to 9 o'clock
at the Old Union. Dates for giving out
the second and third sets will be an
nounced at Interfraternity Council

Rushing rules as published in last
night's issue of (he Daily Palo Alto
were misleading, and implied that
freshmen were to receive the cards
tonight.
