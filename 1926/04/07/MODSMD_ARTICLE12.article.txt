# BABE TRACKSTERS DOPED TO DEFEAT CALIFORNIA RIVALS
## Van Gelden, Cooney Lost to Bear Yearlings Through Ineligibility Route 
### 
Reports from Berkeley indicate that j
Stanford's yearling track team is heav-1
ily favored to win the California habe
contest at Berkeley next Saturday.
Comparative times and distances of
the two teams give the Card aggrega
tion a comfortable lead of from 15 to
25 points.
New complications, however, have'
arisen in the sprints. In a meet with i
Oakland Tech last Monday, Ewing, of j
California, turned in a pretty perform-;
ance in the century by running the!
distance in 10 flat. Jones and Wilson, i
also of the freshman team, tied for I
second closely behind their winning
teammate. This would seem to indi
cate a bitter struggle for second place
on the part of the Cards as both Syer
and Berry have not turned in anything i
under 10.1 this season.
In the same meet the California
babes took all but one first place.
George Watkins, all-round prep ath
lete, ran away from a crowded field
in the 120 high hurdles and broke the |
tape in 16.8. Stanford's best hurdler, I
Nelson, has turned in 16.3 in this,
event. In the two-mile run, Funk of the
babes, was the only man to finish the
race, making the distance in 10 min
utes and 52 seconds.
The California team lost two good
men through the ineligibility route,
VanGelder in the sprints, and Cooney
in the 440. Coach Christie has devel
oped some fairly consistent perform
ers in the broad jump and high jump,
but is weak in the shot-put and discus.
Stanford is sure of two firsts in these
last two events.
Both teams will be in good condition
next Saturday with the exception of;
Hulsman, star Babe pole-vaulter. He j
"lias been troubled all season with a!
bad leg which may put him definitely 1
out of the U.C. meet. There is a pos-}
sibility, however, that he may get in,,
but his loss will not materially affect j
the points in this event as Edmonds I
has consistently cleared 12 feet all
season while the Bruin vaulters have
not gone over 11 feet at any time
during competition.
Last year Stanford won handily, 75 :
to 56, making clean sweeps in the j
broad jump and the javelin throw.
King, of this year's varsity, took the j
high jump at 6 feet 1 inch. This is the
event in which the '29 squad is woe-,
fully weal, and expects nothing more
than a third place.

New complications, however, have'
arisen in the sprints. In a meet with i
Oakland Tech last Monday, Ewing, of j
California, turned in a pretty perform-;
ance in the century by running the!
distance in 10 flat. Jones and Wilson, i
also of the freshman team, tied for I
second closely behind their winning
teammate. This would seem to indi
cate a bitter struggle for second place
on the part of the Cards as both Syer
and Berry have not turned in anything i
under 10.1 this season.
In the same meet the California
babes took all but one first place.
George Watkins, all-round prep ath
lete, ran away from a crowded field
in the 120 high hurdles and broke the |
tape in 16.8. Stanford's best hurdler, I
Nelson, has turned in 16.3 in this,
event. In the two-mile run, Funk of the
babes, was the only man to finish the
race, making the distance in 10 min
utes and 52 seconds.
The California team lost two good
men through the ineligibility route,
VanGelder in the sprints, and Cooney
in the 440. Coach Christie has devel
oped some fairly consistent perform
ers in the broad jump and high jump,
but is weak in the shot-put and discus.
Stanford is sure of two firsts in these
last two events.
Both teams will be in good condition
next Saturday with the exception of;
Hulsman, star Babe pole-vaulter. He j
"lias been troubled all season with a!
bad leg which may put him definitely 1
out of the U.C. meet. There is a pos-}
sibility, however, that he may get in,,
but his loss will not materially affect j
the points in this event as Edmonds I
has consistently cleared 12 feet all
season while the Bruin vaulters have
not gone over 11 feet at any time
during competition.
Last year Stanford won handily, 75 :
to 56, making clean sweeps in the j
broad jump and the javelin throw.
King, of this year's varsity, took the j
high jump at 6 feet 1 inch. This is the
event in which the '29 squad is woe-,
fully weal, and expects nothing more
than a third place.
Reports from Berkeley indicate that j
Stanford's yearling track team is heav-1
ily favored to win the California habe
contest at Berkeley next Saturday.
Comparative times and distances of
the two teams give the Card aggrega
tion a comfortable lead of from 15 to
25 points.
