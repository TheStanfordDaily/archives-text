of the movement, which will be to
maintain a church influence in the
lives of the students, keep them in
touch with the church, and provide a
center for religious and social activi
ties. A worker will be employed, and
plans are now ready for a building
which will be erected adjacent to the
Methodist Church in Palo Alto as soon
as funds are secured, and which will
serve as a center of activities.
The campaign is under the direction

Wesley Burns as chairman. Rev. C. W.
Wise, pastor of the Palo Alto Metho
dist Church, is in charge of student
organization, and will be glad to re
