# ACTIVE ATHLETIC CAPTAINCIES ABOLISHED BY EX COMMITTEE
## Coaching Staff Favors New Ruling; Prevents Forcing Leaders in Games 
### Frank Baker 
No captains of athletic teams will
henceforth be elected uiftil after the
season of any particular sport, follow
ing the action of the Executive Com
mittee last night. This matter has
been discussed by that body for two
weeks.
Under the ruling made by the Com
mittee last night the following motion
will go into effect immediately, but
will not be retroactive: "That Cap
tains be not elected until the end of
the season: that the position be en
tirely honorary, allowing the coach to
appoint a field captain for each con
test. This is to apply to both major
and minor sports."
This motion was made after com
munication had been received from
the coaching staff that such a move
would be very desirable to them, in
asmuch as it would give the various
coaches more freedom in the selec
tion of men to play in particular
games.
Arguments Heard
A few students took advantage of
the provision in the A.S.S.U. constitu
tion, and the special invitation ex
tended by the Executive Committee
yesterday, to attend the meeting.
None of them, after hearing the case
pro and con, seemed to be against the
motion. The arguments against the
change were based mainly on the prin
ciple that it has been a tradition to
elect at the start of the season, and
that the captain is usually a leader
who inspires his teammates and leads
them to victories.
Several athletes were present and
stated that it didn't make any differ
ence whether a man was captain or
not, he would still be an inspiration
and a leader. They also felt that it
would be more real honor, and mean
more to the individual, to be elected
after the season by the men with
whom he played, and who were elect
ing him because of his superior lead
ership and playing.
As presented in the discussion, the
main argument in favor of the plan,
and the one which has recommended
it to several other colleges in various
sections of the country is that if there
is no regular captain a coach needs
have no hesitation in taking a man
out of the game just because he is the
elected leader of the team.
Another idea put forth was that the
men who elect a captain for the follow
ing season at the end of one season
are mostly men who are graduating
and will not be playing with him the
next year, and do not know if he will
be the same type of player in the fol
lowing season that he has been in the
past.

No captains of athletic teams will
henceforth be elected uiftil after the
season of any particular sport, follow
ing the action of the Executive Com
mittee last night. This matter has
been discussed by that body for two
weeks.
Under the ruling made by the Com
mittee last night the following motion
will go into effect immediately, but
will not be retroactive: "That Cap
tains be not elected until the end of
the season: that the position be en
tirely honorary, allowing the coach to
appoint a field captain for each con
test. This is to apply to both major
and minor sports."
This motion was made after com
munication had been received from
the coaching staff that such a move
would be very desirable to them, in
asmuch as it would give the various
coaches more freedom in the selec
tion of men to play in particular
games.
Arguments Heard
A few students took advantage of
the provision in the A.S.S.U. constitu
tion, and the special invitation ex
tended by the Executive Committee
yesterday, to attend the meeting.
None of them, after hearing the case
pro and con, seemed to be against the
motion. The arguments against the
change were based mainly on the prin
ciple that it has been a tradition to
elect at the start of the season, and
that the captain is usually a leader
who inspires his teammates and leads
them to victories.
Several athletes were present and
stated that it didn't make any differ
ence whether a man was captain or
not, he would still be an inspiration
and a leader. They also felt that it
would be more real honor, and mean
more to the individual, to be elected
after the season by the men with
whom he played, and who were elect
ing him because of his superior lead
ership and playing.
As presented in the discussion, the
main argument in favor of the plan,
and the one which has recommended
it to several other colleges in various
sections of the country is that if there
is no regular captain a coach needs
have no hesitation in taking a man
out of the game just because he is the
elected leader of the team.
Another idea put forth was that the
men who elect a captain for the follow
ing season at the end of one season
are mostly men who are graduating
and will not be playing with him the
next year, and do not know if he will
be the same type of player in the fol
lowing season that he has been in the
past.
