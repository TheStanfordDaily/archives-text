# Election of Captains
## 
### 
In the future no captain of an athletic team will be elected until the j
conclusion of the season's competition, according to a by-law passed last j
night by the Executive Committee of the Associated Students, ihe choice j
of a field leader for each contest will be left entirely to the discretion of
the coach; but at the end of the season tfie team will designate as the hon
orary captain the man who it regards as having been the chief contributor
to its welfare.
The Daily believes that the new system is sound, and will work to the
advantage of Stanford athletics. The old plan was justified by tradition,
and by the fact that it honored a member of the squad and set him up as
inspiration to the student body and the competing athletes. Under the new
scheme a man will have to undergo a grilling test before he is selected, and
this fact should serve to enhance the honor of possessing the captain's title.
During competition it is incredible that the team, coafh, and the student
body will not recognize the leading men. The non-possession of a title
will not discourage a real leader, nor will it be sufficient grounds to pre
vent him from being an inspiration to the men with whom lie is playing or
for whom he is competing.
The method of choosing captains in advance has not worked out to the
satisfaction of all. After a player is selected he may go into a slump. As
a result, the team benefits little by his leadership, and in some cases actually
suffers, due to the justifiable hesitation on the part of a coach to "bench"
the captain of his squad.
The action taken by the committee last night is entirely justified by
Article 2, Section 13, of the A.S.S.U. constitution which reads as follows:
"The Executive Committee shall pass rules and regulations for the general
welfare of the A.S.S.U. and the University, bring all questions before the
students when it shall be deemed advisable and co-operate with the Board
of Athletic Control for the general welfare of athletics." This section is
printed here because there was some doubt evidenced on the campus yes
terday as to whether the committee was constitutionally able to enact the
by-law.
Although interested students were requested to attend last night's
meeting so that there might be some expression of campus opinion on
which to base any action, anly a few chose to attend. Their comment was
favorable.
While student opinion thus far may be divided upon the merits of the
new plan, Stanford's coaching staff are heartily in favor of it. "Husky"
Hunt, freshman coach, an exponent of the change from its inception, is
quoted as saying, "I have always favored the idea and took the liberty of
naming an acting captain for the freshman basketball team this year. The
men were perfectly satisfied with the arrangement."
Coach Warner is almost noncommittal on the subject but states that
he is not opposed to the new rulingâ€”implying probably that he awaits de
velopments. 11. M. Davis, weight basketball and tennis coach, from ex
perience believes the new system will be workable; while C. \\ . Davis, di
rector of Intramural sports, declares, "I think that it will work out
From the coaches' standpoint, the new arrangement is very satisfactory."
