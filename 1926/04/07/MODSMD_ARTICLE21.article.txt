# A 						Wise Move

### 
A wise move was made by the Executive Committee last night when it
read into the A.S.S.U. by-laws a consolidated list of all campus election
laws. The result will be found elsewhere in the Daily.
In past years a dark fog has surrounded the electoral procedure of the
University due to the scattering of rules on the subject; rules formulated
over a decade in which no attempt was made to keep one complete record.
While no serious argument has arisen which could not have been settled
after several days search through numerous files, the old arrangement was
nevertheless inexpedient and unsafe.
Future chairmen of the election board will no longer fear disputes in
capable of settlement, since the incorporation last night was a move to
ward the elimination of such possible troubles. The chairman of the l>oard
and any student may now easily turn to the printed by-laws and remove
all doubt on any electoral question.

The Dakota Daily Student rises to the defense of the noble art of de
bating :
"There was a debate last night; there is one tonight. Were you there? Prob
ably not. It is to he regretted that for the average student debating and kindred con
tests do not hold the same appeal that athlctic contests seem to contain. The thrills,
the spectacular are perhaps missing in these contests, but they arc admittedly of
course, of real value."

Progress of the freedom of the press as noted in the Weekly Pleiades
cf Fullerton Union High School:
"The subject of petting has seemed to be of such vital interest to the members of J
our student body that we have permitted the students to air their views on the subject."
