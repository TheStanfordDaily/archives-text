"As competition between countries j
increases it is highly desirable that j
we recognize the velue of peoples, and
the nationtl life of a country is deter
mined by the education of all its 1
people, according to Dr. Leonard ,
Lundgren, who is director of adult j
and vocational education in the San 1
Francisco schools. He was an instruc- j
tor at Stanford in 1914, teaching ap- j
plied mathematics.
"We don't use our leisure time to 'â– 
secure contentment for ourselves any
more than we use our working time
efficiently. The waste of labor power
is shown by the army of unemployed, ;
the group of imperfectly employed |
people who have not been well trained '
| in their work, and the large number !
| who are improperly employed because
I they have not been able to enter the
field to which they are best adapted.
Because the boys and girls of the
part-time high school are working,
their center of ideas lies in the eco
nomic conditions of the community.
The school must reach these students
through the interests of the work that
they are doing, and for this reason one
of the most important problems of the
part-time school is its attempt to ad
| vance the vocational training of its
students.
The part-time school includes in its
j purposes the strengthening and deep
ening of the ideas of punctuality and
I regularity. Helping the student to un
! derstand his relation between state
and society is another motive of the
part-time school which must also com
plete the education courses similar to
those given in high school.
In referring to the San Francisco
part-time high school, Lundgren point
ed out that last year more than six
hundred students of this school were
returned to the regular high school
I after they had been remotivated.
