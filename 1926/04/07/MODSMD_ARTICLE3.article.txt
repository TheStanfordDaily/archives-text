# DAYS OF BEER ARE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY OLD LAMP-POSTS
## 
### 
"The days of cheer, the days of
beer," were brought to mind re
cently by the addition of four
pre-Volstead lamp-posts to the
lighting plan of Toyon hall. Elec
trically wired, they are intended
to light the way for the home
coming wayfarer. Although mod
ern in use, they still retain the
ancient appearance, looking like
the old gas lamp-posts much in
evidence B.P. (before prohibition).
The returning night owls who
have been used to picking their
way toward the hall by the sound
of scuffing their new tan brogans
on sharp rocks will now be able
to see the path clearly, and pick
out the rocks they prefer.
Branner hall members are
anxiously awaiting the happy
time when such improvements
are installed for them.
