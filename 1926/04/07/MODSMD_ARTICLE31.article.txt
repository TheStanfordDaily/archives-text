## 
### 
Speaking before ah Eneina Club smoker
last night, A. E. Roth, Comptroller of
! the University, outlined the considerations
I which should be kept in mind by ftesh
j men in choosing a fraternity. He urged
| the men to pay particular attention to
J the character of the organization and to
attempt to join where the company, es
pecially that of fellow-freshmen, is
thoroughly congenial.
"Intimate associations," he declared.
! "are, after all, the best things to be ob
j tained from fraternity life. You will
| hear much of the help in a business way
[ which your brothers will extend, but that
is not so important an argument here, for
Stanford men have the reputation ot
helping other deserving Stanford men,
regardless of fraternity membership."
Roth spoke stongly in favor of the
abolition of the "fraternity line," which
| he asserts is drawn between the halls and
j the Row. He spoke of the more demo
cratic days when many campus leaders
| who were fraternity members used to
live in Encina, and expressed the wish
that freshmen who go to fraternities
should make efforts to get rid of the
feeling between the halls and the Row.
