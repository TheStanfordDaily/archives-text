# LIKABILITY RANKED AS MORE DESIRABLE THAN KNOWLEDGE
## Women Rating Questionnaire Not Eager for Wealth, Fame, Popularity 
### Barbara Dewlaney 
Likubility is more to be desired than
wealth or wisdom, according to a re
cent questionnaire circulated in Roble
hall. The questionnaire containing
eight things which people commonly
like or wisti for was distributed to de
termine the ideals of college women.
Used as an experiment by a student
in the education department, the ques
tionnaire included the following items:
fame or eminence, service, wealth, wis
dom, appreciation of beauty, likability,
physical fitness, and popularity. Each
woman receiving a blank rated the
items in order of her preference.
Popularity Low
Popularity has the lowest in con
trast to the highest average placement
accorded to likability. Appreciation of
beauty is next highest, while physical
fitness ranks third in the choice of
ideals. The high ranking of jtems of
self-interest, such as likability, appre
ciation of beauty, and physical fitness,
over service, which is fourth choice,
suggests that women tend to be more
selfish than altruistic.
Since wisdom and wealth are graded
fifth and sixth, it is apparent that
women believe aesthetic appreciation
and the human quality of likability of
more value than either of the material
istic qualities of wisdom or wealth.
Women seemingly consider fame and
popularity not worthy and enduring,
for fame is ranked seventh and is fol
lowed by popularity.
Decisions Difficult
Erasures and recheckings on various
blanks indicated that those answering
the questionnaires encountered diffi
culty in making choices. In most cases,
however, there was little hesitation
about putting likability in the upper
half of the choices and popularity in
the last two places. Each of the ideals
was checked at least once in each of
the eight places.
The following suggestions or defini
tions accompanied each item: Fame
or eminence: To be famous, to render
devotion to a cause or to a country
as did George Washington, Abraham
Lincoln, Frances Wlllard. Service: To
promote interest and happiness of so
ciety: to be unselfish, energetic, and
useful in a humanitarian way as Clara
Barton, Florence Nightingale, and
Herbert Hoover. Wealth: To acquire
possessions as money, factories, bonds,
and land as John U. Rockefeller and
Henry Ford.
Qualities Defined
"Wisdom: To have the ability to
judge soundly and to have knowledge,
with the capacity to make due use of
it; to be a scholar, to spend your time
in study, and to write books as John
Dewey, G. Stanley Hall, and David
Starr Jordan. Appreciation of beauty:
To cultivate a love of beauty, to be
filled with the joy of living, to like
poetry, painting, natural scenery.
"Physical fitness: To have good
health, to be able to live your life to
its fullest; to participate in games of
strength and skill as boxing, football,
tennis, swimming. Popularity: To be
celebrated, to be well known and have
your name in the newspapers as Mary
Garden, Douglas Fairbanks, Babe
Ruth. Likability: To be pleasing, suit
able, agreeable, such as to attract lik
ing, to be well liked by your fellows."
Two years ago a student of the Uni
versity circulated in Roble hall a blank
similar to that distributed this year
except that it contained only seven
ideals, lacking the item of likability.
With only two exceptions, the average
choices of each ideal differed from
those made in the recent question
naire. Appreciation of beauty received
second average place in both instances,
and popularity is rated as least wished
for in each experiment.
Wisdom Fourth
Comparison of the rating of service
in both experiments indicates that
women are losing their zeal for ser
vice, which received first choice in
the first questionnaire and only fourth
in the later blank. That women are
becoming less desirous of appearing
in the world of fame is illustrated by
the fact that fame, which ranked third,
dropped to seventh place in the later
questionnaire.
Practically no divergence is shown
in the choice of wisdom, which ranks
fourth in the earlier and fifth in the
later chart. That wealth may be con
sidered of more importance by women
at the present time is suggested by
the fact that wealth is ranked relative
ly higher than two years ago.
Women are now placing more em
phasis on physical fitness, for they
rank that item in the later chart as
third in the list, whereas physical fit
ness was accorded only fifth choice in
the blanks filled out in 1f)24.

beauty is next highest, while physical
fitness ranks third in the choice of
ideals. The high ranking of jtems of
self-interest, such as likability, appre
ciation of beauty, and physical fitness,
over service, which is fourth choice,
suggests that women tend to be more
selfish than altruistic.
Since wisdom and wealth are graded
fifth and sixth, it is apparent that
women believe aesthetic appreciation
and the human quality of likability of
more value than either of the material
istic qualities of wisdom or wealth.
Women seemingly consider fame and
popularity not worthy and enduring,
for fame is ranked seventh and is fol
lowed by popularity.
Decisions Difficult
Erasures and recheckings on various
blanks indicated that those answering
the questionnaires encountered diffi
culty in making choices. In most cases,
however, there was little hesitation
about putting likability in the upper
half of the choices and popularity in
the last two places. Each of the ideals
was checked at least once in each of
the eight places.
The following suggestions or defini
tions accompanied each item: Fame
or eminence: To be famous, to render
devotion to a cause or to a country
as did George Washington, Abraham
Lincoln, Frances Wlllard. Service: To
promote interest and happiness of so
ciety: to be unselfish, energetic, and
useful in a humanitarian way as Clara
Barton, Florence Nightingale, and
Herbert Hoover. Wealth: To acquire
possessions as money, factories, bonds,
and land as John U. Rockefeller and
Henry Ford.
Qualities Defined
"Wisdom: To have the ability to
judge soundly and to have knowledge,
with the capacity to make due use of
it; to be a scholar, to spend your time
in study, and to write books as John
Dewey, G. Stanley Hall, and David
Starr Jordan. Appreciation of beauty:
To cultivate a love of beauty, to be
filled with the joy of living, to like
poetry, painting, natural scenery.
"Physical fitness: To have good
health, to be able to live your life to
its fullest; to participate in games of
strength and skill as boxing, football,
tennis, swimming. Popularity: To be
celebrated, to be well known and have
your name in the newspapers as Mary
Garden, Douglas Fairbanks, Babe
Ruth. Likability: To be pleasing, suit
able, agreeable, such as to attract lik
ing, to be well liked by your fellows."
Two years ago a student of the Uni
versity circulated in Roble hall a blank
similar to that distributed this year
except that it contained only seven
ideals, lacking the item of likability.
With only two exceptions, the average
choices of each ideal differed from
those made in the recent question
naire. Appreciation of beauty received
second average place in both instances,
and popularity is rated as least wished
for in each experiment.
Wisdom Fourth
Comparison of the rating of service
in both experiments indicates that
women are losing their zeal for ser
vice, which received first choice in
the first questionnaire and only fourth
in the later blank. That women are
becoming less desirous of appearing
in the world of fame is illustrated by
the fact that fame, which ranked third,
dropped to seventh place in the later
questionnaire.
Practically no divergence is shown
in the choice of wisdom, which ranks
fourth in the earlier and fifth in the
later chart. That wealth may be con
sidered of more importance by women
at the present time is suggested by
the fact that wealth is ranked relative
ly higher than two years ago.
Women are now placing more em
phasis on physical fitness, for they
rank that item in the later chart as
third in the list, whereas physical fit
ness was accorded only fifth choice in
the blanks filled out in 1f)24.
