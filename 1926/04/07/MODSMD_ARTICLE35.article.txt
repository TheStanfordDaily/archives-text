### Music Critic 
By Music Critic

A long and varied program was
given last night by Harold Gleason.
; organist, of the Eastman School of ]
' Music in Rochester. Mr. Gleason
! showed himself a master of the tech-j
nical effects of the organ. He made I
dynamic use of the volume to be had
in the instrument and his phrasing of
: melodies was clear and pleasing.
! The most impressive numbers, in
| regard to their musical magnitude,
were Cesar Franck's "Choral in A
Minor" and "Variations in E Minor"
by Joseph Bonnet which closed the
program. The fact that Mr. Gleason
performed entirely from memory
seems the more remarkable when the
length and difficulty of these compo
sitions are considered. The "Choral"
was of truly symphonic proportions
containing contrasting moods of ex- j
i ultation and lyric song. The close was
characteristic of Franck in inspiring |
harmony and dignity. The "Variations"
was bold and startling, beginning with
the full power of the instrument, and ;
plunging headlong through a series of j
vigorous variations on the original j
theme.
Lighter numbers were "Gavotte" by ;
! Martini, "Canon in B Minor" by Schu- !
i
I mann, and "Ariel" by Bonnet. "Black
! Butterflies" by Jepson gave an impres
-1 sion of vagueness and indefiniteness
; that had a certain element of charm.
I "May Night" was another composition
j that attracted because of a certain
! mystery, although it was far different
in conception.
