# INITIAL INTRAMURAL BASBALL CONTESTS SCHEDULED TODAY
## 
### 
Intramural baseball games scheduled
for Monday and today were called
off because of the unsuitable condi
tion of the playing fields. The fields
were still too soggy for good ball. These
postponed games are to be dropped for
the present, the regular games being
played as scheduled. During the week
following May 7. nominally the end of
the intramural baseball season, all post
poned games whose postponement was
sanctioned by the intramural sports de
partment will be played off. But this
provision does not apply to forfeited
games, even though both contestants were
obliged to forfeit through inability to
play.
Permanent umpires for the intramural
series have been recruited by C. W. Davis,
director of the sports program. They
are: F. A. Compton, Diamond No. 1;
Rodney George, Diamond No. 2; Frank
Harod, Diamond No. 3; and William
Negus, Diamond No. 4. (). Woodward
will officiate at Sequoia.
