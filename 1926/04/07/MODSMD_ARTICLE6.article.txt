# ELECTION BOARD CODIFIES BY-LAWS FOR ALL VOTING
## New Arrangement Brings Rulings into Compact Set of Regulations 
### 
Codification of the by-laws of the
Constitution of the A.S.S.U. with refer
ence to student body elections was
made by the Election Board, under
John A. Sutro, chairman, and handed
to the Executive Committee last night,
who passed the rules sent in. No real
innovation was made, merely a codifi
cation of the present by-laws into a
compact set of rules.
In the past election regulations have
been scattered in various parts of the
constitution, but with the present codi
fication, a unified collection has been
made that will, the Election Board
hopes, eliminate misunderstandings in
the future.
Following are the new by-laws
going into effect immediately:

delegated in Article XI, Section VI,
of the A.S.S.U. Constitution.)
