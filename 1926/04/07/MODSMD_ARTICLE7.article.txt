# SONGS FOR JUNIOR OPERA DESIRED FROM CAMPUS COMPOSERS
## 
### 
Music for the Junior Opera i 3 being
handled by Jack Wiggin, who has di
j rected both the "Football Gaieties"
! and "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," the
Ram's Head Show, this year. Wiggin
has developed a theme song for the
complete opera, but desires the cam
pus composers to hand in more songs
I to fill out the libretto.
The music is a compromise between
j the type of "Rose Marie," "The Stu
} dent Prince," and the Gilbert and
Sullivan work. The period is in the
early lflth century, and the scene is
, laid in England. The directors do not
want all jass or serious songs, but a
well-balanced group of selections that
frill appeal to all members of an
i audience.
Several of the eccentric and odd
: characters in the cast have songs of a
distinct type to sing, so that unique
melodies will be very desirable. Be
| sides these solos there will be a large
number of choruses that will offer a
1 chance for wide variation and original
ity in composition.
The idea of having a central theme
' for the songs is a new one 011 the
campus. In previous operas and musi
cal shows the libretto has usaully been
| put together by the director as best
he could in a short time, but this year
j an attempt is being made to bring the
opera up as near to the professional
light opera as possible, trying to get
away from the mere musical comedy
idea.
Wiggin may be reached any noon at
the Alpha Tau Omega house, and will
be glad to give any people who desire
to write music an idea of the songs
! and choruses needed.
