# Spring Practice Brings Out Many Last Year Stars
## 
### 
Spring practice is continuing with large
turnouts every day. So far during the
week, emphasis has been placed on
grounding the men in fundamentals, and
putting them through strenuous setting-up
exercises. Scimmage will start today and
plays will be executed as they have been
planned for actual competition.
Since the squad will be without Nevers'
punting this season, Pop Warner is try
ing out several possibilities for the kick
ing berth. There is plenty of time before
a kicker is necessary, and Warner is
spending some time with several pro
spective punters in an effort to find a
good man. So far. Graves, Murphy, Clark,
Wolf, Moore, and Seraphim Post are the
best bets. Post, who was a guard last
year, lias been shifted to the baekfiekl,
and Warner is expecting ihm to shape
into the fullback position well. His kick
ing shows great promise, since he has a
powerful leg-drive and with practice, he
may develop into a satisfactory punter.
Yesterday, dummy scrimmage was gone
through to develop several new plays.
The blackboard was in use, and Warner
explained to the men the how and why
of each new play. Yesterday, practice in
passing, punting, and scrimmage with the
wet ball was undertaken. The oppor
tunity was welcomed as a good chance
to get into trim for possible muddy con
tests.
Among the men on the field are the
following: Captain Swan, Bogue, Doyle,
Frost, Graham, Graves, Spud Lewis,'
Dinty Moore, Mike Murphy, Ed Walker,
Wolf, Young, Crary, Patchett, Freeman,
S. Post, E. Post, Natcher, Pabst, Ro
besky, Trombetta, Vermilya, Cook, Vin
centi, McCreery, and Everett.
