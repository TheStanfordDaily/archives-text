# BOOKSTORE WILL BE HEADQUARTERS FOR DANCE PROGRAMS
## Military Dance Decorations to Change Pavilion Into Scene of Battle 
### 
Programs for the Military Ball may
'be obtained Thursday afternoon at the
Bookstore. Everyone must present a
ticket in order to receive a program.
The programs are hand painted and the
work on them was done by Ed Farmer,
of the Stanford Art department.
Decorations for the Ball have been
planned to lend a distinctly military at
mosphere to the Pavilion. The ceiling
will be made of from 200 to 300 code
signal flags of different origins. This
colorful covering will be added to by the
wall decorations, which are greens from
eucalyptus trees.
In the four corners of the pavilion will
be located four French 75's, the famous
small-bore field artillery piece used so
extensively in the war. These will be
partially hidden in a semblance of
camouflage.
The entrance to the floor is banked
with sandbags, in the fashion of a com
munication trench. Peering over these
walls other field artillery pieces will be
lolcated. .
The decorations for the affair are be
ing rushed through by Alfred Virag,
chairman; work on these decorations is
being done every day in the pavilion. All
military department students who have
time will be welcomed by the committee
any morning, afternoon, or evening from
now until Friday. The dance will take
place Friday night, April 9.
Tickets for the affair may be secured
from the members of Scabbard and Blade,
and other military department members..
