# STANFORD RUNNERS FAVORED TO CRUSH OREGON'S TRACKMEN
## Northerners' Strength Lies in Sprints, Broad Jump, Hurdles, Pole Vault 
### Clif Moore 
By Clif Moore

Stanford's powerful aggregation of
track and field athletes are heavy fa
vorites to win the honors when they
meet the University of Oregon track
men in the stadium oval Saturday
afternoon. The Oregon tussle is the
last one Coach Dink Templeton's
charges will engage in before the meet
with California next week.
Stanford defeated the Webfooters
by a 92 to 38 score in the meet last
year, and the Cardinal athletes are
expected to take the engagement Sat
urday with nearly as large a margin
of points. Oregon is fairly strong in
the sprints, hurdles, broad jump, and
pole vault, but appears to be especially
weak in the 880, weights, and high
jump.
Oregon's outstanding performer is
Flanagan, an athlete capable of doing
nearly 24 feet in the broad jump. He
has consistently bettered 23 feet 6
inches all this season, and is expected
to make a great showing against the
Stanford jumpers. Meeks, a great com
petitive jumper, and Mcßae, will give
Flanagan a good battle, but the Ore
gonian is nearly certain to eclipse
their best efforts.
Hurdlers Well Matched
The hurdle races promise to be in
teresting events, with Kelsey of Ore
gon having an even chance to place
first in both events. Last year Kelsey
defeated Leistner in the lows, and tied
him for first honors in the highs, so it
can be seen that the northern timber
hopper is a hurdler of great ability.
Rosenburg is almost sure to place
first in the pole vault, as his perform
ances around the 12-foot 4-inch mark
are far better than any turned in by
the Cardinal vaulters. In the sprints,
Oregon is given an even chance to
take both'first places, with Hyland or
Coverly of Stanford and Extra of Ore
gon fighting for the honors. Extra is
likely to lead the field in the 220-yard
event, but he will have a hard time
beating out the Stanford sprinters in
the century.
Oregon Two-Milers Strong
Mauney and Holder are the out
standing runners for Oregon in the
mile, but Bill Kerr will probably win
the event for Stanford. Mauney has
made good times this season, and is
regarded as a good rival for the Cardi
nal ace. The northerners boast a two
miler capable of 9.50, and if this run
ner lives up to advance notices he
should take this event from the Stan
ford distance men.

Oregon's team is rated as good com
petition for the Cardinals because of
its great number of athletes that are
liable to do the unexpected in nearly
every event. It is not probable that
any astonishing performances will
take place Saturday, but the meet with
the northerners will give Stanford fol
lowers their last chance to watch the
Cardinals before the Big Meet.

urday with nearly as large a margin
of points. Oregon is fairly strong in
the sprints, hurdles, broad jump, and
pole vault, but appears to be especially
weak in the 880, weights, and high
jump.
Oregon's outstanding performer is
Flanagan, an athlete capable of doing
nearly 24 feet in the broad jump. He
has consistently bettered 23 feet 6
inches all this season, and is expected
to make a great showing against the
Stanford jumpers. Meeks, a great com
petitive jumper, and Mcßae, will give
Flanagan a good battle, but the Ore
gonian is nearly certain to eclipse
their best efforts.
Hurdlers Well Matched
The hurdle races promise to be in
teresting events, with Kelsey of Ore
gon having an even chance to place
first in both events. Last year Kelsey
defeated Leistner in the lows, and tied
him for first honors in the highs, so it
can be seen that the northern timber
hopper is a hurdler of great ability.
Rosenburg is almost sure to place
first in the pole vault, as his perform
ances around the 12-foot 4-inch mark
are far better than any turned in by
the Cardinal vaulters. In the sprints,
Oregon is given an even chance to
take both'first places, with Hyland or
Coverly of Stanford and Extra of Ore
gon fighting for the honors. Extra is
likely to lead the field in the 220-yard
event, but he will have a hard time
beating out the Stanford sprinters in
the century.
Oregon Two-Milers Strong
Mauney and Holder are the out
standing runners for Oregon in the
mile, but Bill Kerr will probably win
the event for Stanford. Mauney has
made good times this season, and is
regarded as a good rival for the Cardi
nal ace. The northerners boast a two
miler capable of 9.50, and if this run
ner lives up to advance notices he
should take this event from the Stan
ford distance men.

Oregon's team is rated as good com
petition for the Cardinals because of
its great number of athletes that are
liable to do the unexpected in nearly
every event. It is not probable that
any astonishing performances will
take place Saturday, but the meet with
the northerners will give Stanford fol
lowers their last chance to watch the
Cardinals before the Big Meet.

Stanford's powerful aggregation of
track and field athletes are heavy fa
vorites to win the honors when they
meet the University of Oregon track
men in the stadium oval Saturday
afternoon. The Oregon tussle is the
last one Coach Dink Templeton's
charges will engage in before the meet
with California next week.
Stanford defeated the Webfooters
by a 92 to 38 score in the meet last
year, and the Cardinal athletes are
expected to take the engagement Sat
urday with nearly as large a margin
of points. Oregon is fairly strong in
the sprints, hurdles, broad jump, and
