# STRONG BRUIN NET SQUAD TO OPPOSE STANFORD SATURDAY
## 
### 
The University of California, with
the expert coaching of Howard Kin
sey, has again developed a powerful
tennis varsity to oppose Stanford in
the annual collegiate meet Saturday
morning at 9 o'clock on the courts of
the Berkeley Tennis Club. Last sum
mer the Bruin team gained nation-wide
recognition by winning both the sin
gles and doubles championship in the
national intercollegiate tennis tourna
ment.
Edward Chandler, predicted by Kin
sey to be a future national champion,
holds No. 1 position on the team.
Chandler captured the 1925 collegiate
title and has been playing even better
of late. In the inter-club matches he
has gained victories over William
Johnson, famous national star, and
Raymond Casey, runner-up at Wimble
don last year. California supporters
expect him to conquer Cranston Hol
man, who defeated him in the match
a year ago.
Bradshaw Harrison, a sophomore,
ranks second. Harrison holds No. 5
position in the state rating, and was
the star member of the 1928 Bruin
freshman team. On the court he is
known for his marvelous agility, fre
quently making returns that seem
hopeless.
Third place is held by John Risso,
remarkable one-armed player. Risso,
a second-year man, ranked immediate
ly below Harrison on the freshman
team, was ineligible to compete in the
Stanford series. He is noted for his
consistent driving and skillful net play.

Tom Stow, No. 4, holds the same
position he occupied last year. Stow
is an extremely flashy player, hut is
lacking in stamina and steadiness. He
has a line service and a dependable
overhead, which enhance his doubles
game.
The first doubles is composed of
Chandler and Stow, and the second of
Harrison and Risso. Chandler and
Stow played together on the team tour
of the East last summer, while Harri
son and Risso are a new combination.
