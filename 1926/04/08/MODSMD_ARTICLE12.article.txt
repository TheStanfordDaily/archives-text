# ARMY OFFICERS ARRIVE HERE ON INSPECTION TOUR
## U. S. A. Officials to Review Stanford Unit in All Phases of Work 
### 
Inspection of the Stanford Reserve
Officers Training Corps will be held
tomorrow. Because of a mistake in the
telegram received by Major Geary, the
inspecting officers were not expected
to reach the campus until tomorrow.
However, they arrived today prepared
to inspect the Stanford unit as previ
ously planned. Despite this the post
ponement will stand.
Classes which were to be excused
today will be excused the same tomor
row in order that the full quota of
military men may be on hand. Since
the inspection is to determine whether
or not Stanford receives the degree of
distinguished college, the men are re
qusted to report in full uniform.
The ranking of distinguished college
was received once by Stanford during
the war, when the height of R.O.T.C.
popularity was attained. The Univer
sity of California has received this
ranking for the last two years, and is
expecting to get it again. According
to Major Geary, head of the Stanford
unit, Stanford has a better chance this
year to receive the ranking than at
any time since the war.
The inspection will be carried on by
Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Brown and
Major Martin Wise, from the War De
partment General Inspection Corps at
Washington. Both officers were invited
