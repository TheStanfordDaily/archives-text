# Euphronia Holds College Help To Average Student
## 
### 
Members of the Euphronia Debating
Society by a two to one vote last night
expressed their belief that an ordinary
student in an ordinary university re
ceives an education that is not a
curse.
In opposing the question, "Resolved,
That this house believes education is
a curse," Leslie Gosslin declared, "I
not only believe a college education is
a curse, but claim that it is a series
of curses. At the end of four years of
college the average graduate has re
ceived only a superficial education."
Gosslin declared that college courses
and subjects are useless in solving
the problems of life. "All a student
ever gets from his undergraduate
training is a cheap encyclopedia kind
of knowledge. People flock to our uni
versities in order to take 'pipe'
courses."
According to George N. Crocker,
who opposed the motion, the average
college graduate has the ability to be
a spectator of life, develops a wider
outlook, and takes the proper philo
sophical attitude toward life. These
results of an education give the col
lege graduate greater happiness in
later life.
Both Crocker and Gosslin have been
past presidents of the society and are
members of Phi Beta Kappa. An
nouncement was also made of the
Euphronia-Mills College debate which
will be held on April 29. Tryouts for
the team will be held Monday night.
