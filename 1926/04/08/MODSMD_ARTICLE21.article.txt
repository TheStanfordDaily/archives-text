Epit. Note :—There may be a better way to lose favor on this campus than by
writing an editorial on rushing. However, as yet it has not been discovered.

The rushing season in this advanced year of 1926 reflects the significant
changes that have occurred at Stanford in the past few years, changes that
have cast a different light upon everything in Stanford life.
Chief among the innovations is what we shall term, that we may sound
literary, the "new freshman." Examine him minutely, and observe that
he is a new specimen. In his freshman year he attains a high peak. He is
more or less isolated, tenderly guarded, and then to cap the climax comes
the rushing season.
Despite the fact that each house, and for that matter, each eating club
and living group deliberately tries to cultivate the attitude of total indif
ference, there remains the underlying and extremely obvious premise that
no group can carry on without new blood, and that the relative stand
ing of the different living groups on the campus depends directly upon
their success in the rushing season.
Add to this, the fact that the success of a fraternity's rushing season
depends altogether upon the whim of the freshmen; and what have you?
Just this—the freshman becomes the most important cog in the Stan
ford social machine. He always was, for that matter, but previously he
was rushed, pledged, and initiated before he ever had a chance to find it
out. After that, any superfluous ego was subdued with the good old board.
Well, we have put ourselves in for it by rules we were forced to make
to keep ourselves from fighting like stray dogs over the prizes in the fresh
man classes.
There is nothing to do but make the best of it, now that the rushing
season is upon us. The great name of Tappa Tappa Nu Keg must carry
on forever!
But it seems a bounding shame that the older men in a great university
should have to bow the knee to recent high school seniors to make it
possible.
