A collection of pictures and clippings dealing with women's athletics
on the campus known as the Women's Athletic Association "S" book has
disappeared from its usual resting place in the Roble gymnasium office.
Being assured by Miss Jean Ward, president of W.A.A. that this book is
of immense value to that organization but of none whatsoever to anyone
else, it is l>elieved that the strayed will soon return to the fold. But to
speed up the procedure the Daily sends forth an urgent plea that who
soever may know of its whereabouts, please have it returned at once to the
Roble gymnasium.

Hopeless decay of a noble sport as noted in the Argoiwut of the Uni
versity of Idaho:
"The tennis courts 011 Blake avenue arc the worst eye-sores on the campus, fences
swaying like cattle pens of a long abandoned farm, and shreds of playing lines scat
tered over a soft dirt surface."

Annoying interference in the business of the day at Golden Colorado:
"Twenty-seven students of the Colorado School of Mines recently were arrested
on a charge of stealing a wheel-barrow valued at $10 to use in an initiation ceremony."

Would that it were true! The Chronicle of Pomona High School:
"Girls who pass the Stanford Supplementary Intelligence Examination may enter
either Stanford or Mills."
