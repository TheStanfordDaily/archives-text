Inspired by Mussolini's misfortune, a contributor, who signs himself S.P..
makes the following sanguinary suggestion:
"May 1 suggest that any woman who, in the future, insists upon taking a
shot at a ruler, first join the R.O.T.C.
"Then, as the Y.M.C.A. says, 'shoot straight and you will win'."

THE SAD ACCOUNT OF JACK AND JANE
Jack was the handsome fellow
Who loved our little Jane.
The things he used to say to her
Produced a stinging pain.
He often came a-calling,
And she, with coy regard,
Escorted him inside the door —
(They fought with no holds barred.)
They, neither, liked electric lights,
In fact, they turned them low,
And in the dim gleam said their say
With measured beat and slow.
This night he came, as usual,
And, met by Jane, was told
That visitors had stormed the place
And they were in the cold.
They went out in her Cadillac,
And parked beneath the trees.
No sooner done, but came a cop—
They had to take the breeze!
They then went out into the park,
And found a darkened stream,
And sat down there —but later left —
(The street-light's awful gleam!)
In sadness back they went, and then —
They found a movie play.
But, as they settled in their seats,
The lights went up to stay.
They left in pain. They sought the car,
And drove away in sorrow.
By this time midnight was at hand.
In fact, it was tomorrow.
I
And so they, wildly, looked around,
Their faces in dishevel,
And, having no place else to go,
They both went to the devil! —L.A.B.
