# OLD OAK TREES IN STANFORD VICINITY RAPIDLY DECLINING
## 
### 
The Santa Clara Valley, particularly
that part of it which surrounds the
Stanford campus, has long been noted
for its abundance of oak trees, and
despite the increase of homes and
highways, with their demand for more
I space, residents of Palo Alto and the
University authorities have constantly
fought to keep every possible tree.
But this, in many cases, is as far as
their efforts go, declares James I. W.
: McMurpliy, professor of botany, while
in spite of all care, nothing can pre
vent many of the old familiar giants
from dying within the next ten or
fifteen years. The solution, he says,
lies in the hands of property owners,
| who should interest themselves in re-,
j placing the dying oaks.
Oak trees, even healthy specimens,
| do not live to the extreme age which
! has commonly been ascribed to them,
Professor McMurphy has found in re-!
cent investigations conducted in this j
vicinity.
"Few live-oaks in Palo Alto are more
than one hundred years old," said Mc-
Murphy. "There may be a few a cen- 1
tury and a half old, but probably none j
older."
Replanting Needed
From these facts, McMurphy points
out that it is obvious that systematic
replanting is the chief relief for the
prevention of a denuded valley.
"Evidently," he says, "if we are
going to have oaks, we must either
plant them artificially or protect the
natural saplings. Live-oaks are among
the most beautiful trees of the valley
and are well worth cultivating. Even
if planted near a sidewalk, an oak,
provided it is well cared for, will
thrive. Moreover, even when young,
the tree is very pretty. There will be
no reason for the Santa Clara Valley
being denuded of these monarchs if
people will take the care to replace
them."
In describing diseases common to
local oaks, Professor McMurphy char-

acterized fungus growths as the most |
dangerous. Fungi usually attack dead
limbs and thus effect an entrance into
the heart of the tree, causing it to rot
away. Fireburns and cracks in the
bark likewise invite fungi; while the

species known as oak-root fungus en-1
ters through the live bark. The pre-!
cautions to be taken against these
parasites are chiefly pruning of dead
limbs and plastering over wounds, as
has been done extensively on the trees
in front of the library. As a result,
McMurphy feels assured that these !
particular specimens will live a good i
many years yet.

Roots Smothered
The automobile, too, is an enemy of |
the oak. Macadam pavements laid over
the roots of trees tend to smother
them in time. Many Palo Alto trees ;
are doomed on this account. Leaking
gas mains have suffocated local oaks
in some instances. Drowning is a pe-

culiar form of death for a tree to meet,
but nevertheless a healthy giant stand
ing near Roble gymnasium a few
years ago was inundated by an over
flow from the swimming tank and suc
cumbed. Caterpillars sometimes blight
the trees in this vicinity, and drought,
is particularly severe on the saplings.

Stanford campus, has long been noted
for its abundance of oak trees, and
despite the increase of homes and
highways, with their demand for more
I space, residents of Palo Alto and the
University authorities have constantly
fought to keep every possible tree.
But this, in many cases, is as far as
their efforts go, declares James I. W.
: McMurpliy, professor of botany, while
in spite of all care, nothing can pre
vent many of the old familiar giants
from dying within the next ten or
fifteen years. The solution, he says,
lies in the hands of property owners,
| who should interest themselves in re-,
j placing the dying oaks.
Oak trees, even healthy specimens,
| do not live to the extreme age which
! has commonly been ascribed to them,
Professor McMurphy has found in re-!
cent investigations conducted in this j
vicinity.
"Few live-oaks in Palo Alto are more
than one hundred years old," said Mc-
Murphy. "There may be a few a cen- 1
tury and a half old, but probably none j
older."
Replanting Needed
From these facts, McMurphy points
out that it is obvious that systematic
replanting is the chief relief for the
prevention of a denuded valley.
"Evidently," he says, "if we are
going to have oaks, we must either
plant them artificially or protect the
natural saplings. Live-oaks are among
the most beautiful trees of the valley
and are well worth cultivating. Even
if planted near a sidewalk, an oak,
provided it is well cared for, will
thrive. Moreover, even when young,
the tree is very pretty. There will be
no reason for the Santa Clara Valley
being denuded of these monarchs if
people will take the care to replace
them."
In describing diseases common to
local oaks, Professor McMurphy char-

acterized fungus growths as the most |
dangerous. Fungi usually attack dead
limbs and thus effect an entrance into
the heart of the tree, causing it to rot
away. Fireburns and cracks in the
bark likewise invite fungi; while the

species known as oak-root fungus en-1
ters through the live bark. The pre-!
cautions to be taken against these
parasites are chiefly pruning of dead
limbs and plastering over wounds, as
has been done extensively on the trees
in front of the library. As a result,
McMurphy feels assured that these !
particular specimens will live a good i
many years yet.

Roots Smothered
The automobile, too, is an enemy of |
the oak. Macadam pavements laid over
the roots of trees tend to smother
them in time. Many Palo Alto trees ;
are doomed on this account. Leaking
gas mains have suffocated local oaks
in some instances. Drowning is a pe-

culiar form of death for a tree to meet,
but nevertheless a healthy giant stand
ing near Roble gymnasium a few
years ago was inundated by an over
flow from the swimming tank and suc
cumbed. Caterpillars sometimes blight
the trees in this vicinity, and drought,
is particularly severe on the saplings.
