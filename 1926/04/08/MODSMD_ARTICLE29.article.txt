# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor-, Sir:
One of the traditions in which Stan
ford seems to take particular pride is
her honor system. This honor system
is not merely a system of rules which
are printed on the covers of blue
; books, and are to be forgotten except
'during examination periods. It is
I rather an ideal which should permeate
the innermost corner of every Stan
ford man, and should stamp him as a
person in whom all men can put their
: trust.
i During my first year and a half in
this University 1 felt that the honor
• system was being followed by all per
| sons on the campus. Last quarter I
had an unfortunate experience which
is tending to make me believe that
j there are some in Stanford who are
I willing that the other fellow obey the
: honor system, but are not willing to
j obey it themselves.
I At the end of my work in English 2a
II turned in my collection of themes to
i be corrected. When I returned to get
j them back, the instructor found that
I they had disappeared along with an
[ other collection which he had marked
' with an A. Those themes were taken
! either by a person with a very poor
I sense of humor, by one with no sense
at all, or by a person with deliberate
; dishonest intent. He intends to use
j them, I suppose, whenever he finds
j that he is hard up for material in his
| work in English.
While I am flattered by the honor
! which he has conferred upon me by
considering that my feeble efforts are
worthy of this great service, I feel
that there is an honor which is bought
at too great a price. I have a certain
j affection for these creations of mine,
j however worthless they may be. Twen
j ty years hence I may desire to read
i them over, if for no other reason than
I to realize what silly things they really
j are. I have a very sincere desire to
j have those themes returned to me.
It would please me greatly if the per
j son who took them would bring peace
| to his conscience by getting them back
■ to me in some way. As I have no more
| desire to see him than he probably

has to see me, I might mention that
1 am never at home (311 Sequoia) on
Saturday or Sunday or in the after
noon from one to four.
I do not consider that I have an
unusually vindicative nature, but if the
one who took my themes fails to re
turn them, 1 assure him that it is my
earnest desire and wish that his in
structor flunk him in English, and
that the gods who are forever have
no mercy on his thieving little soul
(if any).
Yours truly,

I do not consider that I have an

that the gods who are forever have
no mercy on his thieving little soul

One of the traditions in which Stan
