£obert A. Gardner, of Chicago and Yale, is a man of I
dual athletic accomplishments. Besides being one of Amer- J
ica's foremost amateur golfers, and at present the. leader !
of the Walker Cup team that sails to invade England in a j
few weeks, the versatile Bob is the holder of the inter
collegiate pole-vault record.
No golfer since Bob's first victory at Wheaton, 111. (yes, !
that's where Red Grange lives) in 1909 lias won the ama-j
teur title more than twice —and Bob repeated his victory
in 1915, besides being runner-up in 1916 and 1921. And no
pole-vaulter at the annual track meets of the Intercollegiate
Association of Amateur Athletics of America (the IC4A)
has equaled Bob's record of 13 feet, 1 inch, made at Phila
delphia in 1912. So that's that!
Gardner's vault beat the accepted world's mark of 12 1
feet. 10 7-Sths inches, held bv Leland Stanford Scott, of !

Leland Stanford University. Bob's world's record was short-lived, however,
as Mark S. Wright, of Dartmouth, whom Bob had beaten in the Intercollegiates,
vaulted 13 feet, 2 1-4 inches just a week later. Gardner competed for Yale back
in the days when the Blue specialized in vaulters, for in those days the names i
of Dray, Gilbert, Campbell, and Nelson were all synonomous with a first place
in the "pole-jump."
While Bob's athletic ability has won him much glory in track and field
sports, the "Charley Hoff of 1912" has acquired most of his fame on the golf
links, and as an executive of the United States Golf Association. Gardner is
not only a vice-president of the U.S.G.A., but has been president of the Chicago
District Golf Association. He was a member of the Walker Cup teams of
1922, 1923, and 1924, and this makes his third year as Captain. As a com
petitive golfer he is well known in England, for in 1920 he was only beaten at
the thirty-seventh hole in the final round of the British amateur championship,
and in 1923 it. was his defeat of Capt. Harris of the British team that helped
bring the Walker Cap back to America.

few weeks, the versatile Bob is the holder of the inter
collegiate pole-vault record.
No golfer since Bob's first victory at Wheaton, 111. (yes, !
that's where Red Grange lives) in 1909 lias won the ama-j
teur title more than twice —and Bob repeated his victory
in 1915, besides being runner-up in 1916 and 1921. And no
pole-vaulter at the annual track meets of the Intercollegiate
Association of Amateur Athletics of America (the IC4A)
has equaled Bob's record of 13 feet, 1 inch, made at Phila
delphia in 1912. So that's that!
Gardner's vault beat the accepted world's mark of 12 1
feet. 10 7-Sths inches, held bv Leland Stanford Scott, of !

Leland Stanford University. Bob's world's record was short-lived, however,
as Mark S. Wright, of Dartmouth, whom Bob had beaten in the Intercollegiates,
vaulted 13 feet, 2 1-4 inches just a week later. Gardner competed for Yale back
in the days when the Blue specialized in vaulters, for in those days the names i
of Dray, Gilbert, Campbell, and Nelson were all synonomous with a first place
in the "pole-jump."
While Bob's athletic ability has won him much glory in track and field
sports, the "Charley Hoff of 1912" has acquired most of his fame on the golf
links, and as an executive of the United States Golf Association. Gardner is
not only a vice-president of the U.S.G.A., but has been president of the Chicago
District Golf Association. He was a member of the Walker Cup teams of
1922, 1923, and 1924, and this makes his third year as Captain. As a com
petitive golfer he is well known in England, for in 1920 he was only beaten at
the thirty-seventh hole in the final round of the British amateur championship,
and in 1923 it. was his defeat of Capt. Harris of the British team that helped
bring the Walker Cap back to America.
