# CALIFORNIA GRADS FLOCK TO ENROLL FOR STANFORD WORK
## 
### 
Despite all of the disparaging com
ment which comes from the other side
of the bay, more graduate and under
graduate students entered Stanford
from the University of California last
year than from any other university
or college in the United States. Such
is the information obtained from sta
tistics contained in the president's
report of 1924-25 which was issued re
cently.

California graduates in Stanford last
year numbered 28 and were 81 per
cent satisfactory in the year's work.
Columbia and the College of the Pa
cific were next with 9 each who were
80 and 89 per cent satisfactory, re
spectively.

At least 24 undergraduates decided
to forsake the Golden Bear for the
Cardinal during this period, and their
work proved to be 91 per cent satis
factory. Southern Branch contributed
a total of 14 in this classification who
made the high score of 93 per cent.
The second largest number of trans
fers was, however, from the University
of Southern California. This group was
79 per cent satisfactory.

According to these statistics Los
Angeles High School was far ahead of
any otlier preparatory school in con
tributing Stanford students with a to
tal of 47. Lowell High in San Francisco
and Palo Alto High tied for second
place with 24 each. San Jose, San
Mateo, Los Angeles Polytechnic, Holly
wood, Long Beach, and Pasadena came
next in order.
The figures show a heavy increase
in the number of students enrolled
from California, but accompanying this
situation there is a rather marked de
crease in the number of students from
other states and countries. In one year
the percentage of outside students
dropped from approximately 26 to 16
per cent of the total registration.
