an announcement made by Charles W.
Davis, these two sports are the only
ones that will be run off for several
weeks. Golf cannot be started yet as
the greens are now being improved on
the course that the Stanford players
will use. They will not be ready for
another month.
The freshmen meet the sophomores
in the first tennis matches on Wednes

be concluded on April 27 after each
team has met every other squad in
competition.
The following are the rules for ten

four doubles matches will be played
against each class. The president of
each class should appoint a tennis
manager. He should post the list of
the men who have been chosen to
represent the class on the gymnasium
bulletin board as soon as possible. Any
player in the class may challenge any
of these men for their place on the
team. Players who are challenged must
defend their position on the team. For
this reason, these lists should be
posted at once, so that every man
may get a fair chance to try out for
the team.
All men registered in the University
are eligible for tennis excepting var
sity and freshman men who compete
in the California matches this year.
Games will be decided on the following
point basis: games won count five
points; games lost count nothing; and
games won by default count seven
points. Class numerals will be awarded
the winning team.

day, with the freshmen meeting the
sophomores in the first game. The
season will be completed April 21.
Soccer is open to any registered stu
dent now in the University. Holdovers
