# SCOFIELD STUDYING STRIPED BASS FOR STATE COMMISSION
## 
### 
An investigation regarding the hab
its of striped bass on the Pacific Coast
is being conducted by Eugene C. Sco
field under the commercial department
of the State Fish and Game Comrnis-

sion of California. Scofield is a student
in the zoology department here and
has been carrying on his work for the
past six or seven months.

The purpose of this investigation is
to study the life history of striped
bass, the rate of growth, and length
of life. From these studies observa
tions can be made which will lead to
other discoveries.

By means of his work Scofield is
attempting to determine whether or
not striped bass are being overfished
on the coast. His study is mainly for
legislative purposes.

Striped bass were introduced into
the waters of the Pacific Coast in 1879.
At that time about 500 small fish were
brought out from the East. The annual
commercial catch today amounts to
nearly one million pounds.

These fish are most plentiful in the
waters of the San Francisco Bay re
gion but they are scarce along the
coast. Scofield's investigations on
striped bass are the first which have
been carried on the Pacific Coast. Lit
tle investigating has been done even
in the East.
