# FUNDS FOR BUILDING DENIED WASHINGTON BY STATE GOVERNOR
## 
### 
University of Washington, Seattle,
April 6—(P.l.P.) —Executive orders were
received by the Board of Regents from
Governor Roland G. Hartley Friday for
bidding the expenditure of the $547,850
building appropriation fund for the Uni
versity of Washington. Washington State
College and the three state normal schools
will also suffer if the governor's orders
are observed.
At the last session of the legislature
Governor Hartley was openly arrayed
against all measures granting the state's
educational institutions increased appro
priations. The building fund was finally
passed over the governor's veto, and it is
thought that his order is a preliminary
step to court action in regard to work
of the legislature.
The appropriation provided for the
completion of the new library, the con
struction of a new mines building, an
electric generator, and operating expenses.

Faculty members at the University
of Oregon are opposed to having com
mencement before the close of the
school year. *
