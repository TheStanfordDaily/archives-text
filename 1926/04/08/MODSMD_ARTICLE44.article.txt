# Intramural Baseball Games Are Indefinitely Postponed
## 
### 
No intramural baseball games were
played today because of the continued
rains this week. According to an an
nouncement from the Intramural
Sports department, it is also probable
that there will be no contests tomor
row as the diamonds are soggy, and it
will be almost impossible to perform
on the wet grounds.
