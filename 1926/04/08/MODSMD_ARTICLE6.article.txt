### Herbert Klein 
San Francisco musicians will take
a large part in the annual Home Con
cert of the Stanford Glee Club to be
given in the Assembly hall the night
before the Big Meet. Max Dolin and
his popular California Theatre Trio,
composed of piano, 'cello, and violin,

cal and semi-popular numbers. Harry
Robertson, a Stanford graduate, and
now one of the leading tenors in San
Francisco, will also be on the pro
gram.
Under the direction of Warren D.
Allen, an entirely new repertoire has
been undertaken that is more ambi
tious than anything previously at
tempted by the Cardinal singers. The
first group of choral numbers will con
tain compositions of Palestrina and
Bach, great figures in the early de
velopment of music. "Salterelle," by
Saint-Saens, also in the first group, is
one of the most spirited numbers ever
sung by the club.
The Home Concert will be distin
guished by the first Western presenta
tion of the remarkable work, "A Dirge
for Two Veterans." The dirge is a late
composition by Gustav Hoist, one of
the noted modern English composers.
Hoist wrote it after the Great War.
choosing as his text the Walt Whitman
verse after which the song has been
named. The musical setting is ex
tremely realistic and suggests the hor
rors of war with gruesome and blood

ties of the dirge, an accompaniment
of brass instruments has been ar
ranged, and will be used to enhance
the impressions of war.
Ticket sales for the concert will
begin next Tuesday, April 13. Seats
will be priced at $1 and 75 cents.
