# FRESHMEN POINTED TO STAGE COMEBACK IN SATURDAY GAME
## 
### 
Determined to stage a comeback
when they meet the California Cubs
in the second game of the annual
series, the Stanford yearlings will
travel to Berkeley Saturday.

Six errors and poor hitting were the
factors in last Saturday's game which
gave the University of California
freshmen a victory. Spud Lewis and
A1 Kern are capable of pitching a
good brand of baseball and with fair
support should be able to win the
second game.
The lay-off this week due to wet
grounds will put the freshmen on edge
for their important game. If the babes
win Saturday's game, the deciding con
test will be played a week later.

Following is the probable lineup for
the game: Hartley, second base;
Wright, first base; Roger, shortstop;
Harder, third base; Kern or Lewis,
pitcher; McKey, left field; Wilton,
center field; Davis, right field; Brown,
catcher.
