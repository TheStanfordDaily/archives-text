# COLLINS TO TAKE MOUND IN SECOND GAME WITH BEARS
## Cardinals Meet California on Berkeley Diamond; Draper on First 
### 
With the exception that Steve Col
lins will occupy the box instead of
"Count" Sobieski, the same lineup as
played last week will represent Stan
ford when the varsity ball team meets
California Saturday afternoon at West
Field, Berkeley, according to the deci
sion of Coach Harry Wolter last night.
Draper will continue on first sack.
Maguire, who Wolter expected to use
in the second contest, will probably
be too badly out of shape as the result
of a recent infection to work into the
lineup at this late date.
The outfield will continue as before
with Nissen, Weaver, and Clark. All
three fielders played a defensive game
that was almost airtight last Saturday.
The infield lineup will be as before:
Draper, first; Garibaldi, second; Cap
tain Cuddeback, third; Busch, short
stop, with Sypher behind the plate.
Weather conditions again made it
impossible for the varsity to hold any
practice yesterday, but Wolter will put
his men through at least a light work
out this afternoon. The Blue and Gold
team will be suffering under the same
handicaps as the Cards, so that there
will be no advantage either way.
The chief ways in which the Cards
should improve their performance if
they are to win Saturday are fewer
errors and more consistent slugging.
The 3 to 1 victory by Berkeley last
week showed mainly that the Cards
have it in them to win the last two
games of the series if they improve
along these lines.
