# TENNIS SQUAD PLAYS BRUINS AT BERKELEY
## Holman Meets Chandler in Feature Match of Day; National Interest REPUTATIONS AT STAKE California Games Follow Successful Early Season Playing 
### 
After a succession of victories in
preliminary meets, the varsity tennis
team will vie with worthy opponents
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock when
it meets the University of California
team on the courts of 'the Berkeley
Tenuis Club. Three singles and two
doubles matches will be played.
Cranston Holman, Stanford's bid for
national tennis honors, will open the
play against Edward Chandler, Bruin
captain. Both players have powerful
services, good drives, excellent back
hands, and accurate net games. Chan
dler is remarkable for his flawless
technique and finesse, while Holman
is known for his fine stamina and fight
ing spirit. Experts are divided on the
championship potentialities of the two.
William T. Tilden, national tennis
king, gives the palm to the Stanford
representative, while Grantland Rice
and Howard Kinsey, noted tennis
critics, favor the Blue and Gold leader.
Each man reigns supreme in his re
spective sphere. With their personal
reputations as well as the honor of
their colleges at stake, a grand battle
should result.
The remainder of the team will be
composed of Alan Herringtou, Lionel
Ogden, Paul Fairchild, Ralph McEl
venny, and Gorner Thomas.
Herrington Has Drive
Herrington is the present singles
champion of Southern California and
a former nationally ranked junior star.
His game is banked upon an accurate
forehand drive with which he maneu
vers his opponent from long range. He
suffers from occasional spells of un
steadiness, but of late has been play
ing in excellent form and should add
to his prestige tomorrow.
Lionel Ogden, captain, is a varsity
veteran. Last year he barely lost to
Gervais Hillis in a spectacular match
featured by reckless slugging on both
sides. Earlier in the present season,
Ogden injured his ankle, but is in

toured the East in company with Hol
man. The pair reached the semi-final
round of the national intercollegiate
! doubles tournament, eliminating Chan
dler and Stow of California, and losing
only to Stratford and Hillis, the even
! tual winners. Ogden, like Herriugton,
is a former junior champion of Soutli
-1 ern California. His dependable, well
; rounded game and long tournament ex
i perience will be of great aid to the
j team.
Fairchild Graduates
Another former varsity man is Paul
Fairchild, who lost to Gerald Stratford
j last year. Fairchild is renowned for
ill is hard backhand drive and liis un

ments. This is Fairchild's last match

physical trim again. Last summer he
toured the East in company with Hol
man. The pair reached the semi-final
round of the national intercollegiate
! doubles tournament, eliminating Chan
dler and Stow of California, and losing
only to Stratford and Hillis, the even
! tual winners. Ogden, like Herriugton,
is a former junior champion of Soutli
-1 ern California. His dependable, well
; rounded game and long tournament ex
i perience will be of great aid to the
j team.
Fairchild Graduates
Another former varsity man is Paul
Fairchild, who lost to Gerald Stratford
j last year. Fairchild is renowned for
ill is hard backhand drive and liis un
usual ability to reach difficult place
ments. This is Fairchild's last match
for Stanford and it should be his best.
Ralph McElvenny and Gomer Thom
as are members of the '28 freshman
team. In that competition with Cali
; fornia, McElvenny defeated Dustin
Rhoades and Thomas won over Jack
Heilbron. Thomas Holds the 1925 fall
quarter tennis championship of Stan
ford, while McElvenny is the present
state champion of Colorado.

Students neglect studies for activi
lies is the opinion of a University of
Minnesota professor.
After a succession of victories in
preliminary meets, the varsity tennis
team will vie with worthy opponents
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock when
it meets the University of California
team on the courts of 'the Berkeley
Tenuis Club. Three singles and two
doubles matches will be played.
Cranston Holman, Stanford's bid for
national tennis honors, will open the
play against Edward Chandler, Bruin
captain. Both players have powerful
services, good drives, excellent back
hands, and accurate net games. Chan
dler is remarkable for his flawless
technique and finesse, while Holman
is known for his fine stamina and fight
ing spirit. Experts are divided on the
championship potentialities of the two.
William T. Tilden, national tennis
king, gives the palm to the Stanford
representative, while Grantland Rice
and Howard Kinsey, noted tennis
critics, favor the Blue and Gold leader.
Each man reigns supreme in his re
spective sphere. With their personal
reputations as well as the honor of
their colleges at stake, a grand battle
should result.
The remainder of the team will be
composed of Alan Herringtou, Lionel
Ogden, Paul Fairchild, Ralph McEl
venny, and Gorner Thomas.
Herrington Has Drive
Herrington is the present singles
champion of Southern California and
a former nationally ranked junior star.
His game is banked upon an accurate
forehand drive with which he maneu
vers his opponent from long range. He
suffers from occasional spells of un
steadiness, but of late has been play
ing in excellent form and should add
to his prestige tomorrow.
Lionel Ogden, captain, is a varsity
veteran. Last year he barely lost to
Gervais Hillis in a spectacular match
featured by reckless slugging on both
sides. Earlier in the present season,
Ogden injured his ankle, but is in
physical trim again. Last summer he
toured the East in company with Hol
man. The pair reached the semi-final
round of the national intercollegiate
! doubles tournament, eliminating Chan
dler and Stow of California, and losing
