# DEMAND VOTE ON EX BOARD'S CAPTAIN RULE
## Students Circulate Petition Asking for Special Campus Election MANY AFFIX SIGNATURE Change in Ruling Possible If New Movement Is Successful 
### 
( Opposing the recent action of the
I Executive Committee which provides
a new method of selecting team cap
tains, a petition was circulated about
the campus this morning requesting
a special student body election to con
sider the question. The petition is as
follows:
We, the undersigned students,
feeling that the action of the
Executive Committee in changing
the time of election of captains
for the various sports was without
proper consideration and discus
sion, hereby request that the
measure be put to a vote of the
student body.
Attached to the petition was an arti
cle clipped from last night's San Fran
cisco Call, written by Pat Frayne,
sporting editor. The article was an
attack against the action taken by
the Stanford Executive Committee.
Article twelve, section one, of the
j A.S.S.U. constitution provides that the
act of any officer, committee, or or
ganization may be repealed or amend
led by a two-thirds vote cast at a spe
| cial election held for this purpose.
This is the grounds on which dissatis
-1 lied students ask for the special elec
| tion. The provision requires that a
i petition containing fifty signatures of
registered voters be presented to the
'executive committee," who shall call
;the election.
Consequently, there is a possibility
jof the special election provided the
petition is presented. As yet that body
has had no official notification of the
petition. Ardent backers of the new
j movement claim that the proper pre
j sentation will be made.
