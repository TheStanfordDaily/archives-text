# MOTION CALLING FOR SOPHOMORE CONTROL DEFEATED BY 1928
## 
### 
A motion that the sophomore repre
| sentative on the Executive Committee
|be instructed to advocate Sophomore
: Control of the freshmen was defeated
i at a meeting of the class of 1928 yes
i terday afternoon. The sophomores also
| turned down proposals that the class
[adopt some insignia to distinguish
j them from the freshmen, as the ab
i sence of both sophomore hats and
; freshman dinks had removed any dis
tinction.
Three jolly-ups will be given this
quarter if possible, the class decided.
| Dates for the jolly-ups will be set so
!as not to interfere with rushing, or
j any campus dramatic or social func
tion. The present sophomore class in
stituted the evening jolly-ups and
1 strongly expressed its opinion that
j the custom be continued.
John Canfield reported that the bill
j for the damage done to Encina ball in
the raid last October had been paid,
! with a balance of $290 remaining in
the class treasury. This amount will
be retained until the time of the Junior
; Prom given by the class of 1928 next
year. The bill for the Encina damage
totaled $197.04.
