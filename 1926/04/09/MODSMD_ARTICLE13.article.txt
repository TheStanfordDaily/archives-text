# VARSITY BASEBALL GAME WITH BEARS SET FOR TUESDAY
## Heavy Rains Cause Change In Date for Second Game of Series 
### Herb Klein 
Heavy downpour made it impossible
i for Coach Harry Wolter and the Cardi
nal baseball nine to take a workout
last night, and the second game of the
California series, scheduled for tomor
row at Berkeley, has been called off.
West field, the California diamond, is
built on the lines of a sunken garden
jand easily comes to resemble a lake.
The game called off for tomorrow will
I be played next Tuesday afternoon at
! 3: 30 o'clock.
The lineup remains the same as that
previously announced with Steve Col
lins to twirl for the Cards. Collins has
i pitched fairly consistently in most of
his games this season and should be
able to hold the Bruin nine. California
was able to collect six bingles from
Sobieski's pitching last Saturday, but
with the additional dope on individual
I batting idiosyncracies that Sypher
! gained in his position of catcher, this
i number should be cut down. It is not
j airtight pitching that the Cards need
j for victory so much as airtight de
j fensive playing by the infield and espe
j cially a wave of heavy slugging that
| will connect with the trickiest offer
ingsof the Bear moundsmen.
Paddy Draper will continue on first,
| according to Wolter's plans; Garibaldi,
who played a first-class game last Sat
urday, at second; Captain Cuddeback
at third; while Busch will snag the
hot grounders in shortstop position.
Fielding will be done by Weaver,
; Nissen, and Clark, who not only make
j all sorts of improbable catches but
i have a fairly high batting average
; among them.
