"Since religion ends In character, it
lean be taught by showing students
j how righteousness looks when it is
| lived," said Dr. Jordan, who spoke on
j "How to Teach Religion in the
I Schools" at his home last night.
Believing that no one who has
; studied and observed the order of
[things in the can doubt that
i there is some controlling power, Dr.
Jordan pointed out that it is easy to
teach college students religion, be-
I cause they have had a framework to
build upon.
"Character is taught by contagion,
and religion can not be developed by
lectures but by showing children fair
: play and other qualities of good char
' acter," said Dr. Jordan.
In speaking of the movement advo
cating reading the bible in the schools,
Dr. Jordan mentioned the problem in
deciding what should be read. If the
bible is read without comment the cliil-
I dren may not understand it, whereas
if it is commented upon antagonism is
'stirred up.
Dr. Jordan defined religion as the
; backbone of character, recognition of
j order in the universe, and knowledge
of good and evil. He declared it im
possible to take another man's reli
gion, for it is an individual thing.
! "Our duty to do what is right is
determined through a scientific life,
and the disposition to do what is right
is higher development of religion. No
act can be narrow if it follows what
is believed to be right."
Dr. Jordan expressed his disapproval
of college chapel as perfunctory, say
ing that religion is a development of
personality and can not be obtained by
compulsion. "In fact. I don't believe
in compulsory education for adults in
anything," declared Dr. Jordan.
