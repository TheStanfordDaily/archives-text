# Freshman Track, Baseball Events Called Off: Rain
## 
### 
The Stanford-California freshman
track meet scheduled for tomorrow is
postponed until Tuesday, according to
an announcement made yesterday by
R. W. Cortelyou, graduate manager of
athletics at Berkeley. The rains for
the past five days have left the track
in such condition that it will be im
possible for competition.
The second game of the Card-Bruin
varsity baseball series and also the
second freshman baseball game have
been postponed. West field, on which
the baseball games were to have been
played, is in an almost impossible
condition. The freshman game will be
played Wednesday at 3 o'clock, while
the varsity contest is scheduled for
Tuesday at 2 o'clock.
The Stanford-California tennis
matches, however, will not be affected
by the weather. The courts can be put
in shape on very little notice and only
a rain on the day of competition could
affect them.
