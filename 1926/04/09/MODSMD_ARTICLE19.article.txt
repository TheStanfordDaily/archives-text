# OREGON TRACK MEN ARRIVE TO MEET VARSITY
## Northern Team Has Power In Hurdles, Sprints, Broad Jump CARDS WELL BALANCED Stanford Favored to Take Last Preliminary to Big Meet 
### 
Coach Dink Templeton's Stanford
varsity track and field team will meet
the University of Oregon in the sta
dium oval tomorrow afternoon. This
I will be the last public appearance of
j the Cardinal athletes before the Big
j Meet with California, and the perform-
J ance of Templeton's charges against
! the Oregonians will give Stanford fol
i lowers their final opportunity to size
| up the team.
Twenty Oregon athletes under the
! tutelage of Bill Haywards, the Web
j footers' coach, will oppose the Stan
ford athletes tomorrow. The northern
-1 ers present a team particularly strong
I in some events, and woefully weak in
others. Against this aggregation Tem
pleton will send his usual well-bal
anced team, and the certainty of
places in every event should give
| Stanford the meet by a fairly com
| l'ortable margin of points.
j The visitors are especially strong
in the hurdles, pole vault, broad jump,
.sprints, and two-mile events. To coun
i terbalance this, Stanford is supreme
| in the 440, 880, high jump, mile, relay,
' and weights, with a good chance to
break in for points in Oregon's strong
est events.
The best all-around performer on
i the Oregon team is Walt Kelsey, who
! is figured to place in both hurdle races,
j pole vault, high jump, and possibly in
I the broad jump. Kelsey defeated the
i Stanford star hurdler, Leistner, in the
lows last year on a muddy track. Kel
( sey is the captain of the Oregon team
and is one of the highest point-scorers
in the North.
