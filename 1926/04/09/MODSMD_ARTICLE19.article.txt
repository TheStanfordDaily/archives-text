# OREGON TRACK MEN ARRIVE TO MEET VARSITY
## Northern Team Has Power In Hurdles, Sprints, Broad Jump CARDS WELL BALANCED Stanford Favored to Take Last Preliminary to Big Meet 
### 
Coach Dink Templeton's Stanford
varsity track and field team will meet
the University of Oregon in the sta
dium oval tomorrow afternoon. This
I will be the last public appearance of
j the Cardinal athletes before the Big
j Meet with California, and the perform-
J ance of Templeton's charges against
! the Oregonians will give Stanford fol
i lowers their final opportunity to size
| up the team.
Twenty Oregon athletes under the
! tutelage of Bill Haywards, the Web
j footers' coach, will oppose the Stan
ford athletes tomorrow. The northern
-1 ers present a team particularly strong
I in some events, and woefully weak in
others. Against this aggregation Tem
pleton will send his usual well-bal
anced team, and the certainty of
places in every event should give
| Stanford the meet by a fairly com
| l'ortable margin of points.
j The visitors are especially strong
in the hurdles, pole vault, broad jump,
.sprints, and two-mile events. To coun
i terbalance this, Stanford is supreme
| in the 440, 880, high jump, mile, relay,
' and weights, with a good chance to
break in for points in Oregon's strong
est events.
The best all-around performer on
i the Oregon team is Walt Kelsey, who
! is figured to place in both hurdle races,
j pole vault, high jump, and possibly in
I the broad jump. Kelsey defeated the
i Stanford star hurdler, Leistner, in the
lows last year on a muddy track. Kel
( sey is the captain of the Oregon team
and is one of the highest point-scorers
in the North.
Proc Flanagan, winner of the Pacific
Coast intercollegiate broad jump title
last year, is conceded first place over
the Stanford jumpers, Meeks and Mc-
Rae. Flanagan's consistent jumping
over 23 feet (5 inches marks him as
the best broad-jumper on the coast,
and the Stanford pair are in for a
great battle with the Northerner.
Javelin Appears tven
Stanford's superiority in the javelin
will be seriously questioned by Vic
Wetzel, who is reported to have tossed
the spear steadily over the ISS-foot
mark. Stanford made a clean sweep
against TJ.S.C. in this event, with Har
low, Joaquin, and Shipkey all better
ing the 180-foot line.
Holt and Extra form a hard pair to
beat in the sprints. Holt's specialty is
the 100-yard dash, while Extra is ex
pected to run oft' with the honors in
the furlong. The two Oregon sprint
aces will run both events.
Miller in Quarter
The Cardinals will run up a com
manding total in the middle distance
races, with Miller, Storie, and Babcock
capable of scoring a clean sweep in the
440, and Captain Richardson and
Carlsmith favored in the half-mile.
Kerr is the outstanding runner in the
mile and he should win his customary
first place. Ross and Kelly will enter
the four-lap event for Oregon, and will
probably give Ranney of Stanford a
battle for second.
Holder of Oregon is said to have
made the two-mile in 9:50 on several
occasions ,and if he turns in this time
tomorrow he is practically sure of a
first place.
Stanford should make a good show
ing in the shot-put and discus, with
Hoffman and Evans favored for one
two in both events. Wetzel and Stock
well are Oregon's entries in the
weights.
Crowley and Kelsey should take
first and second in the pole vault, as
both have vaulted consistently over 12
feet all season. The Cardinals will re
taliate with a sure first and second in
the high jump, with Work and King
both capable of (J feet 4 inches. Muhs
and Ebey are expected to battle for
third, with the Stanford jumper hav
ing a slight advantage.
Stanford is assured of five points in
the final event, as Templeton's relay
team is recognized as the fastest on
the coast. Babcock, Storie, Richardson,
and Miller are the speediest one-lap
runners on the Stanford squad, and
their performance in the relay is al
ways certain of a final victory.
