# Justification of Existence
## 
### 
The subject of honor societies has always been a temptation to col
legiate editors who are in search of material for their writings. In a re
cent issue of the Cornell Daily Sun the entire editorial column is devoted to
a startling expose of the worth of the organizations existing on the Cornell
campus. The discussion is far from flattering.
Basing his observations on-the premise that an honor society must do
more to justify its existence than be a patron of jewelry manufacturers,
the editor proceeds to survey, critically, no less than twenty-eight organi
zations. To his way of thinking, only one or two of these have any real
worth. Some are found to be overlapping in their functions.
Last year an attempt was made at Stanford to weed out the dead-letter
societies. A committee was appointed to investigate the situation; and
after several months it made a report. But the committeemen evidenced
far more fear that they might tread on someone's toes than did the editor
of the Sun. Their investigation of the societies was rather obscured by
other considerations.
The Cornell paper has perhaps taken too pessimistic an outlook on the
subject. It fails to take account of the inward desire of practically every
college student —to receive recognition for service. The idea of honor
societies should receive some analysis. For instance, it is hard to con
ceive that a group of men could be so egotistic as to get together, exchange
praise, indulge in back-slapping, and then found a society for good fellows,
making themselves charter members.
Probably every so-called honor society began life with a purpose. From
this beginning many have evolved into honor societies purely, only a few
keeping their original identity.
The Stanford campus is probably not overburdened with organizations.
In fact it would be fairly safe to say that we have proportionately no more
than any wesetrn university. But there is no doubt that many are
performing no function other than electing members and supplying pin
merchants with orders.
It would be well for every society to assume some task in addition to
the promotion of good fellowship. The Stanford community would reap
the product of their efforts.
