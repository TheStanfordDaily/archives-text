# UNUSUAL LIGHTING EFFECTS PROMISED FOR MILITARY BALL
## 
### 
Something new in the way of light
ing effects is promised by Harold
Todd, who has been retained by the
Military Ball committee to handle the
lighting of the pavilion for the enter
tainment. Todd has been in charge of
the lighting for campus dramatic pro
ductions this year. The final result of
his efforts will be clever and effective
illumination.
In connection with his plans, Todd
has ordered several small spotlights
and some larger ones; these, along
with a vari-colored central fixture, will
furnish the central theme of the elec
trical effects.
It was discovered that the big guns
which were to be used at the pavilion
could not be gotten inside without
disassembling them. Consequently, the
enlisted men of the department will
take the guns down and reassemble
them inside the building so that the
decorative effect may be sustained.
Negotiations with the authorities as
to whether there will be a Charleston
contest are going on at present. If
things go through, the contest will be
held, with appropriate prizes to the
lucky winners.
A limited number of tickets will be
placed on sale at the box office to
night for those who have been unable
to secure them. A few tickets remain
at the Bookstore. The price is $3.50.
Programs for the affair may be ob
tained up until 5 o'clock at the Book
store. After that time they will be
obtainable at. the door of the pavilion
between 8:30 and 9 o'clock.
