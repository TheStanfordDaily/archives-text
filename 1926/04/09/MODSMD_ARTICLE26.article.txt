"THE PLOT THAT FAILED"
Once upon a time there was a movie who wanted to be different so he
thought and thought until finally he conceived of a scenario which would be
entirely new, something which hitherto had never been thought of —a new plot.
Months and months he worked, night and day, day and night, until at last
the great work of art was completed, and the m.d. was ready to spring his
jealously guarded surprised upon a totally unsuspecting world. He would be
famous, pointed out to all as the man who had achieved the impossible—a man
of the world.
Soon the picture was released, and all of the m.d.'s predictions were
realized. He became known as the saviour of the movie world; he received
thousands of letters daily from all parts of the country, which praised al great
length his genius. Oh yes, we almost forgot to give the plot: well here goes:
Ara Bella, daughter of Umbra Bella, multi-millionaire and Saurekraut king,
falls in love with a poor, but simple ditchdigger who works in one of her
father's factories. It is a case of love at first sight; they decide to ask papa's
blessing. They did, and he did, but not in the way they wanted. Our hero was
bounced and told to keep bouncing.
For papa had his own ideas on a husband for Ara Bella. The man of his
choice was his manager Hap Hazard (who was secretly plotting the ruin of
his boss by holding up the billion dollar neer beer contract.) The marriage
is to take place immediately, even while Hap's gang is preparing to destroy
all the beer bottles. But Ara backs out and Hap abducts her to the gang's
hangout; the situation is tense for Hap is a bad boy. But in the meantime,
Nosoap, our hero, discovers the plot and rushes to the factory where he
knocks out six men and saves the bottles. Then commanding a plane he
locates the hangout and drops through the roof just in time to save Ara Bella
from washing the dishes. A fierce struggle ensues. Fifteen times Nosoap
is laid out cold, but each time he manages to beat the count, and clinch.
Finally our hero winds the grandfather's clock around Ilap's neck to put him
down and out. Fadeout: years later MR. and MRS. Nosoap playing with their
five children on the front lawn.
This, boys and girls of cabbage land, was the NEW plot. And now for
the moral: "There ain't no such animal."

Nosoap, our hero, discovers the plot and rushes to the factory where he
knocks out six men and saves the bottles. Then commanding a plane he
locates the hangout and drops through the roof just in time to save Ara Bella
from washing the dishes. A fierce struggle ensues. Fifteen times Nosoap
is laid out cold, but each time he manages to beat the count, and clinch.
Finally our hero winds the grandfather's clock around Ilap's neck to put him
down and out. Fadeout: years later MR. and MRS. Nosoap playing with their
five children on the front lawn.
This, boys and girls of cabbage land, was the NEW plot. And now for
the moral: "There ain't no such animal."
