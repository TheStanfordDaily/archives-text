# PROFESSOR MEARS, TOBRINER PUBLISH BOOK ON MARKETING
## Work Stresses Development Of Co-operative Trend In California 
### 
Eliot G. Mears, professor of the
Graduate School of Business, and M.
O. Tobriner, '23, are authors of a book
entitled "The Principles and Practices
of Co-operating Marketing" whose
first publication appeared last week
and which is the outgrowth of Mear's
teaching at Stanford for several years.
Tobriner wrote his master's thesis
under the professor's direction.
The book is the first textbook on the
subject which has appeared for sev
eral years and is said to be the only
one which includes in addition to the
general practices the significant social
aspects, the history of the movement
in the United States and other foreign
countries individually, as well as em
phasizing other international phases.
Stress on California
Especial stress, however, is given to
the growth and development of the
movement in California, since the ex
periences in this state are more valu
able than any other place in this coun
try and rank along with those of Den
mark and Ireland.
The method adopted by the authors
as stated in the preface of the book is
of three phases. "First, to place agri
cultural co-operation in its natural set
ting; therefore the social aspects, the
historical narrative, and the interna
tional phases not only have been in
cluded but also have been stressed
throughout the book. Second, the ac
tual practices of foreign and domestic
co-operatives have been investigated
and analyzed, both to afford informa
tion for individuals and to provide a
suitable basis for deductions. Third,
the statement of the principles—com
monly referred to as fundamentals or
essentials constitutes the present
knowledge relative to the joint sale of
the agricultural products."
Much Data Used
Several hundred co-operative asso
ciations have supplied material for the
book. Much data was gotten from the

United States Bureau of Agricultural
Economics. In the Appendices of the
book were the tabulations of two ques
tionnaires sent to the leading Ameri
| can and Canadian associations which
handle the greater part of the co-oper
ative farm business, and to those lead
, ing organizations in the state of Cali
: fornia.
Professor Mears is a member of the
National Association of the State Mar

key." This quarter Mears is giving two
lecture courses on co-operative market
ing, one dealing with the principles,
j the other with the problems.

University in 1923, took his M.A. here
the next year, and at present is a
student in the Harvard Law School.
He is interested in co-operative mar
keting from the legal standpoint. He

Eliot G. Mears, professor of the
Graduate School of Business, and M.
O. Tobriner, '23, are authors of a book
entitled "The Principles and Practices
of Co-operating Marketing" whose
first publication appeared last week
and which is the outgrowth of Mear's
teaching at Stanford for several years.
Tobriner wrote his master's thesis
under the professor's direction.
The book is the first textbook on the
subject which has appeared for sev
eral years and is said to be the only
one which includes in addition to the
general practices the significant social
aspects, the history of the movement
in the United States and other foreign
countries individually, as well as em
phasizing other international phases.
Stress on California
Especial stress, however, is given to
the growth and development of the
movement in California, since the ex
periences in this state are more valu
able than any other place in this coun
try and rank along with those of Den
mark and Ireland.
The method adopted by the authors
as stated in the preface of the book is
of three phases. "First, to place agri
cultural co-operation in its natural set
ting; therefore the social aspects, the
historical narrative, and the interna
tional phases not only have been in
cluded but also have been stressed
throughout the book. Second, the ac
tual practices of foreign and domestic
co-operatives have been investigated
and analyzed, both to afford informa
tion for individuals and to provide a
suitable basis for deductions. Third,
the statement of the principles—com
monly referred to as fundamentals or
essentials constitutes the present
knowledge relative to the joint sale of
the agricultural products."
Much Data Used
Several hundred co-operative asso
ciations have supplied material for the
book. Much data was gotten from the

United States Bureau of Agricultural
Economics. In the Appendices of the
book were the tabulations of two ques
tionnaires sent to the leading Ameri
| can and Canadian associations which
handle the greater part of the co-oper
ative farm business, and to those lead
, ing organizations in the state of Cali
: fornia.
Professor Mears is a member of the
National Association of the State Mar
i keting Officials. Before coming to
Stanford he was Chief, Trade Com
missions Division of the United States
Department of Commerce. He is the
author of a book entitled "Modern Tur
key." This quarter Mears is giving two
lecture courses on co-operative market
ing, one dealing with the principles,
j the other with the problems.
Tobriner, who graduated from this
University in 1923, took his M.A. here
the next year, and at present is a
student in the Harvard Law School.
He is interested in co-operative mar
keting from the legal standpoint. He
had an article, "The Legal Aspect of
Co-operative Marketing Contracts" in
i the January issue of the American Bar
i Association Journal.
