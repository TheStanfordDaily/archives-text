# EARTHQUAKE WRECKS STANFORD BUILDINGS TWENTY YEARS AGO
## 
### Oliver Northcote 
April 18 will be a memorial day for
Stanford. It is the twentieth anniver
sary of the California earthquake,
which was the greatest setback ever
experienced by the University. The
shocks killed one student, completely
destroyed several buildings, and caused
a loss of nearly $3,000,000.
Dr. Jordan stated at the time that
the quake was due to an old geologic
fault, which is marked by the Portola
Valley extending for forty miles along
the base of the Sierra Santa Cruz
Mountains. The shocks were due to a
readjustment of this fault. It was re
opened and the mountains on its west
side slipped to the northward for a dis
tance of from three to six feet without
any change of level.
As Portola Valley is only five miles
west of the campus, the shocks from
the grinding movement along the
fault, succeeding each other, were tre
mendous and had terrible effects on
the stone and brick buildings of the
University. First estimates of the loss
ran as high as five million dollars, but
on later investigation the damage was
found to be less serious than it first
appeared.
Church Damaged
One of the most serious losses was
in the Memorial Church. Here the
heavily tiled spire plunged through
the nave, and the resulting concussion
forced off the church front, destroying
the mosaic, "The Sermon on the
Mount." At the same time the flying
buttress crashed through the apses.
This damage to the church was not
completely repaired until nearly five
years later.
This slowness in reconstructing the
University was due to certain condi
tions attached by the founders to the
endowment of the University which
stipulated that no part of the principal
should ever be taken for any purpose,
and that the institution should never
run into debt. Furthermore, there was
no tuition fee at this time, so that all
reconstruction funds necessarily came
out of the current income and gifts
of friends and alumni.
Probably the greatest single damage
was the complete destruction of the
unfinished library which was on the
site now used for the annual football
bonfire. Parts of the debris still re
main to the curiosity of incoming
freshmen. Only the great library dome
and its steel supporters were un
harmed, but it was the swaying of the
latter that aided in demolishing the
rest of the building of stone and brick.
No attempt was made to rebuild this
library, and it was not until Dr. Jor
dan became chancellor and Dr. Bran
ner president, in 1913, that the con
struction of a new library and new
men's gymnasium was announced. The
old gymnasium had also been com
pletely destroyed.
Inner Quad Unharmed
The Quadrangle itself suffered only
slight damage. The four large build
ings of the outer quad, then containing
the laboratories of zoology, botany,
and physiology, the temporary library,
and the assembly hall, all made of
heavy masonry reinforced with steel
wire, were almost intact. Corner build
ings were somewhat damaged, the his
tory the least and the mining the most.
The inner Quad, made up of all one
story buildings, was unharmed.
In Gncina a falling chimney struck
and killed one of the students. Ex
cepting for two corners, which were
badly cracked, Encina itself was un
harmed. Itoble, now Sequoia hall, ex
cept for the fall of two artificial chim
neys, was also free of any damage due
to its reinforced steel wiring.
The tall stone chimney standing a
short distance from the power house
was snapped off like the lash of a whip
and crashed through the power house,
causing considerable damage.
Further Damage Done
Much of the Art Museum was
wrecked, and many of the statues,
vases, pottery, etc., were crushed. The
building itself was soon repaired, but
some of the exterior ornaments and
paintings still show the results of the
shocks.
The picturesque Memorial Arch at
the gateway of University Avenue was
almost completely ruined when its
upper part snapped and split almost
to the base. Only the pillars on either
side of the drive were repaired and
still remain.

paintings still show the results of the
shocks.
The picturesque Memorial Arch at
the gateway of University Avenue was
almost completely ruined when its
upper part snapped and split almost
to the base. Only the pillars on either
side of the drive were repaired and
still remain.
April 18 will be a memorial day for
Stanford. It is the twentieth anniver
sary of the California earthquake,
which was the greatest setback ever
experienced by the University. The
shocks killed one student, completely
destroyed several buildings, and caused
a loss of nearly $3,000,000.
Dr. Jordan stated at the time that
the quake was due to an old geologic
fault, which is marked by the Portola
Valley extending for forty miles along
the base of the Sierra Santa Cruz
Mountains. The shocks were due to a
readjustment of this fault. It was re
opened and the mountains on its west
side slipped to the northward for a dis
tance of from three to six feet without
any change of level.
As Portola Valley is only five miles
west of the campus, the shocks from
the grinding movement along the
fault, succeeding each other, were tre
mendous and had terrible effects on
the stone and brick buildings of the
University. First estimates of the loss
ran as high as five million dollars, but
on later investigation the damage was
found to be less serious than it first
appeared.
Church Damaged
One of the most serious losses was
in the Memorial Church. Here the
heavily tiled spire plunged through
the nave, and the resulting concussion
forced off the church front, destroying
the mosaic, "The Sermon on the
Mount." At the same time the flying
buttress crashed through the apses.
This damage to the church was not
completely repaired until nearly five
years later.
This slowness in reconstructing the
University was due to certain condi
tions attached by the founders to the
endowment of the University which
stipulated that no part of the principal
should ever be taken for any purpose,
and that the institution should never
run into debt. Furthermore, there was
no tuition fee at this time, so that all
reconstruction funds necessarily came
out of the current income and gifts
of friends and alumni.
Probably the greatest single damage
was the complete destruction of the
unfinished library which was on the
site now used for the annual football
bonfire. Parts of the debris still re
main to the curiosity of incoming
freshmen. Only the great library dome
and its steel supporters were un
harmed, but it was the swaying of the
latter that aided in demolishing the
rest of the building of stone and brick.
No attempt was made to rebuild this
library, and it was not until Dr. Jor
dan became chancellor and Dr. Bran
ner president, in 1913, that the con
struction of a new library and new
men's gymnasium was announced. The
old gymnasium had also been com
pletely destroyed.
Inner Quad Unharmed
The Quadrangle itself suffered only
slight damage. The four large build
ings of the outer quad, then containing
the laboratories of zoology, botany,
and physiology, the temporary library,
and the assembly hall, all made of
heavy masonry reinforced with steel
wire, were almost intact. Corner build
ings were somewhat damaged, the his
tory the least and the mining the most.
The inner Quad, made up of all one
story buildings, was unharmed.
In Gncina a falling chimney struck
and killed one of the students. Ex
cepting for two corners, which were
badly cracked, Encina itself was un
harmed. Itoble, now Sequoia hall, ex
cept for the fall of two artificial chim
neys, was also free of any damage due
to its reinforced steel wiring.
The tall stone chimney standing a
short distance from the power house
was snapped off like the lash of a whip
and crashed through the power house,
causing considerable damage.
Further Damage Done
Much of the Art Museum was
wrecked, and many of the statues,
vases, pottery, etc., were crushed. The
building itself was soon repaired, but
some of the exterior ornaments and
paintings still show the results of the
shocks.
The picturesque Memorial Arch at
the gateway of University Avenue was
almost completely ruined when its
