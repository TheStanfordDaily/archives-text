# SPORTS OF 1926
## Now in the Swim 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The men's national indoor swimming championships
now in progress in Chicago are, in a way, the best ever
held; for, whether King Weissmuller competes or not, the
men are there who have recently broken some of his rec
ords and the ruler's throne is insecure for the lirst time
in years. "Young upstarts" like Walter Laufer, Walter
Spence, and Harry Glancy have come into the picture
within the last twelve months, and with the added presence
of Eric Rademacher, of Germany, the world's champion
breast-stroke swimmer, the Illinois Athletic Club team is
likely to lose its laurels for the first time in many years.
But never has there been a swimmer like the marvelous
Johnny. Memories of Daniels. Raithel, McGillivray, Cann,
Langer, Ross, even the colorful Duke Kahanamoku, fade in
the presence of the one and only Weissmuller, who seems
to be able to break a world's record whenever he really

wants to. The happy-go-lucky Johnny is 21 now, and has been competing for
(he I.A.C. since 1921. He has defended his title as the world's swimming
champion many times more than Dempsey has his title of heavyweight boxing
champion, for Johnny has met all comers for five years at distances from fifty
yards to half a mile, and erased practically every record on the books in win
ning his numerous victories.
Johnny is even more rhythmic and graceful in the water than Duke was.
His six-beat crawl stroke varies from that of other great swimmers only in
that he "planes" the water more, reaches further forward and swims a little
higher. John breathes on every stroke, too, which is not always the custom.
In contrasts to this, Arne Borg, that great Swedish water-dog now wearing the
colors of the 1.A.C., never swims two lengths of the tank exactly the same. He
lacks form, hut he gets there just the same, as his numerous records and his
two seconds and a fourth in the Olympic games prove.
