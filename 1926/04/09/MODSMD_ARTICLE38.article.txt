# CALIFORNIA OFFERS COURSE INCLUDING TRAVEL IN SUMMER
## 
### 
The University of California lias
originated a novel educational plan
which combines a summer schedule
of six weeks' study at the university
with 8000 miles of travel "around and
across America." The purpose is to
give students personal contact with
places and scenes closely associated
with (he early history of the West at
the time of its discovery and develop
ment.
The places visited will include many
scenic wonders of the United States.
Lawyers, doctors, and clergymen will
be allowed to study and travel by this
plan, as well as students and teachers.
Groups will proceed westward by
sea, on a 5000-mile voyage from New
York to San Francisco, via Havana
and the Panama Canal. Some time will
be spent visiting the picturesque city
of Panama. Those who do not do this
may go to the coast by rail and return
by sea.
