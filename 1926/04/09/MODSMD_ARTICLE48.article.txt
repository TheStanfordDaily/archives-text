# NEW HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSFORMER WILL ARRIVE BY APRIL 30
## 
### 
The new high-voltage transformer
which is being sent to the Ryan High
Voltage Laboratory by the General
Electric Company, has already been
shipped from Schenectady and will ar
rive by April 30. Wben installed this
apparatus will produce the highest
electrical voltage ever achieved.
According to Professor Harris J.
Ryan, the equipment, which is occupy
ing five freight cars, will be ready for
use by July 1. The six transformer
units, capable of 350,000 volts each,
can develop a total voltage of 2,100,000.
Within the latter limit, every range of
voltage required can be produced by
the machinery, which weighs over
twenty-two tons.
When completed, the laboratory,
which has been provided by the lead
ing electrical corporations of the
United States, will occupy a floor space
80 by 120 feet, besides the twenty-foot
