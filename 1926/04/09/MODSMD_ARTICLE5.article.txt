# APPARATUS ARRIVES FROM GOVERNMENT FOR ORDNANCE USE
## Micrometallograph Records Magnify Images Up to 10,000 Diameters 
### Lynn Eramkamp 
The mining and metallurgy depart
ment of Stanford University received
recently a new micro- and macro
metallograph machine, on issue from
the United States Government. The
apparatus will be used in the metallo
graphy of iron and steel class of the
Ordnance department, to be given
under Welton J. Crook, associate pro
fessor of metallurgy.
This machine, the latest type of
American-built apparatus, is so equip
ped that photographs of the materials
may be taken from diameters of five
times to diameters of ten thousand
times. The micrometallograph is used
for the larger magnifications, and the
macro- attachment furnishes magnifi
cations varying from five to fifteen
diameters.
The outfit is made by the Bausch
and Lomb Optical Company, and is the
most up-to-date metallograph to be
found, of American make. Several
types of German metallograplis can
be obtained; the department has two,
one over five years old, and the other
new. The cost of these machines
ranges around $2000'.
The light for the machine is de
veloped from an electric arc running
on 110 volts, direct current. This light
is sent through a series of condensers,
and passes upward through the micro
scope. It reflects onto the material to
be studied, and the light from this
is taken through a series of lenses and
prisms over right-angle bends, and
finally comes out at an eyepiece, where
the material can be observed by the
student.
In order to take a photograph, the
eyepiece is removed, and the camera,
which is mounted on the same stand
ard, is placed before the opening of
the microscope. This camera is so
built that it takes plate pictures eight
by ten inches in size. The photographs
are developed in dark rooms provided
for the purpose at the department.
Smaller pictures may be taken if so
wished.
When the macro attachment is to be
used, the microscope is removed, and
a special light condenser is fastened
to the source of light. The light is
directed either obliquely or vertically
on the material, which reflects the
image into the camera for photo
graphy. There is no eyepiece attach
ment for this low-power microscope.
It is possible to view the object
through the camera plate.
The camera for macro-photographs
is equipped with a special right-angle
lens, called the microtessar lens. This
is a camera lens with the proper
prisms to direct the light in a right
angled path to the camera. These ma
chines are similar in design to Ger
man-made Leitz machines. The Ger
man machines are mounted on special
shock absorbers, to take up all vibra
tions from the passing street cars,
which go by outside the window of the
laboratory.
