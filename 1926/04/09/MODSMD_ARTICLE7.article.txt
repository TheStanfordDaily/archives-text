# NEW YORK GRAND OPERA SINGERS TO PRESENT CONCERT
## Metropolitan Company Stars To Appear in Costume Thursday Night 
### 
Grand opera, in costume and with
scenery, will be the novel way in
which Edward Johnson, tenor, and
Joan Ruth, prima donna soprano, will
stage their joint recital in the Assem
bly Hall next Thursday night as the
last of the Peninsula Music Associa
tion's series of concerts.
The two singers, both prominent
stars of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany of New York, will furnish music
lovers of the campus and surrounding
communities an opportunity to see and
hear some of the choicest arias and
duets from popular Italian operas.
Acts From Operas
Acts from three of the most popular
operas will be presented. These will
include the Garden Scene from Romeo
and Juliet. Miss Ruth will sing the
parts of "Gilda" in Rigoletto, "Juliet"
in Romeo and Juliet, and "Mimi" in
La Boheme. Special scenery costumes
and lighting have been arranged for
each presentation.
Edward Johnson has long been
known as one of the leading perform
ers 011 the American operatic stage. He
is credited with an unusual amount of
musical intelligence and histrionic
ability as well as a rarely rich and
satisfying tenor voice. His most recent
triumphs have included the creation of
the role of "Pelelas" in Pelelas and
Melisande.
Johnson was born of Canadian par
ents, who wished him to prepare for
law. He was only able to take up his
vocal career after overcoming their
objections. He succeeded rapidly and
went on several concert tours in the
United States, later going to Italy to
study under Lombardo of Florence,
the same vocal teacher that taught
Caruso. After two years of training
Johnson made his famous debut in
Padona, Italy.
Studies in Italy
He translated his name into the
Italian for his seven years of operatic
work in Italy so that it was as Edouar
do di Giovanni that he made his suc
cesses there. On his return to America
in 1920 he resumed his Anglo-Saxon
name. He soon was added to the roster
of the Metropolitan Opera Company
and is now one of their leading tenors.
Miss Ruth is a comparative new
comer to the operatic world and is one
of the youngest of the stars. She has
been declared "the new star in the
operatic firmament."
