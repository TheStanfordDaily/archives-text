was three matches to two, the Cardi

superb exhibition of racquet skill, 7-5,
6-4. Holman started powerfully in the
initial set, gaining a commanding ad

a remarkable rally. The decisive eighth
game went to deuce 11 times, finally

set. Chandler continued his furious
pace in the following set and ran into
a 5-2 game lead. Holman, by virtue of
