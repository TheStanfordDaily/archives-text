# CARDINALS WIN BUD CHANDLER BEATS HOLMAN
## Tennis Team Is Victorious Over California for First Time Since 1912 SUPERB RACQUET SKILL Stanford Cops One Singles, Two Doubles Matches In Close Battle 
### R. T. McElvenny 
For the first time since 1912, the
varsity tennis team, under the cap
taincy of Lionel E. Ogden, defeated
the University of California Saturday
in the annual tennis meet. The score
was three matches to two, the Cardi
nals winning third singles and first
and second doubles.

Cranston Holrnan, ranking Stanford
satellite, lost the first singles to Ed
ward Chandler, Bruin leader and na
tional intercollegiate champion, in a
superb exhibition of racquet skill, 7-5,
6-4. Holman started powerfully in the
initial set, gaining a commanding ad
vantage at 5-2. Here Chandler started
a remarkable rally. The decisive eighth
game went to deuce 11 times, finally
falling to the Blue and Gold repre
sentative, who then in quick order
added the next four games to win the
set. Chandler continued his furious
pace in the following set and ran into
a 5-2 game lead. Holman, by virtue of
Home fine backhand drives and vol
leys, brought the score to 5-4, but lost
the next game, and with it, the match.

Second Encounter Long
The second singles encounter was a
prolonged struggle between Paul Fair
child of Stanford and Bradshaw Har
rison, Bruin player and fifth ranking
man in the state. For two hours the
pair battled, with the advantage even
tually settling at Berkeley, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Each player refused to take a chance,
and the rallies were accordingly very
lengthy. Fairchild played exceptionally
well. Time and again he sent over
shots that on most players would have
been good for points outright. Harri
i son, however, exercised all of his
famed court-covering ability, which
eventually proved the deciding factor.
Alan Herrington, third Stanford
singles player, was in excellent form
and trimmed John Risso, famous Cali
fornia one-armed player, in straight
sets, 6-4, 6-2. Standing in the center of
the backcourt, Herrington relentlessly
ran Risso all over the place. In the
first set the two matched drives, with
Herrington for the most part on the
! offensive. As the match progressed
Risso gradually tired, and in the last
games Herrington's forehand drives
were clipping the corners at the rate
of a point a shot.
Holman, Ogden Win Doubles
Holman and Ogden, first Cardinal
doubles combination, took the court
against Chandler and Stowe in an at
tempt to score a win to even the team
match. Both men played in grand
style. Following in their crunching
serves, they set up a devastating net
attack that baffled their opponents. Hol
man drove and volleyed for clean
placements, while Ogden gave worthy
support with fine smashes and pick
ups. In the first set they quickly broke
through service and captured the set
in sequence games 6-3. The last set
was much closer. Chandler and Stow
succeeded in holding their deliveries
Mntil the eleventh game, when they
weakened, dropped the game, and on
the following serve, the match.
The score was now tied and only
second doubles remained to be played.
Herrington and Ralph McElvenny sup
ported the Cardinal against Harrison
and Risso of the Bears. The Stanford
players started out well and soon
captured the first set at 6-3. The Cali
fornia duo then became aroused and
by improved team play evened the
advantage with a score of G-2. The last
set was a long one.
The Bruins gained an early lead by

capturing McElvenny's initial service,
but soon lost it when ltisso dropped
his own delivery. Service now held
steadily, Stanford leading with the odd
game. Herrington supplied strength
to the Stanford combination by liis fine
driving, while McElvenny added to the
general effectiveness by making some
fortunate wood shots on crucial points.
On the sixteenth game, Harrison, who
was suffering from leg cramps, lost
his service and with it the set, match,
and team meet.
