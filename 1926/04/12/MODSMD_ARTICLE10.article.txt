# Freshman Track Team Will Meet Bears Tomorrow
## 
### Paul Sexson 
Dink Templelon's freshman track
squad will leave for Berkeley tomor
row morning where they will meet the
Bruin Cubs in their annual track and
field contest at 2:30 o'clock in the
afternoon. The Stanford team will take
the field heavily favored to win and by
a fairly large margin.
The Card aggregation will be minus
the services of Conner in the mile run,
and probably Hulsman in the pole
vault. Conner has developed some trou
ble in his lungs and is definitely out.
Hulsman, however, may get in for one
or two vaults to assure points in this
event, but his knee, that has kept him
on the sick list for most of the season,
will keep him from competing actively.
U. C. Has Sprinters
With a California sprinter capable
of 10 seconds flat and two other men
of equal ability running him a close
second, prospects for points in the
sprints seem dark for Stanford. Syer
and Berry have performed consistently
around 10.1 all season in the century
and usually shade 23 seconds in the
furlong.
The broad jump and high jump are
the strongest events for California and
third places is the best that the Red
shirts can hope for.
Cards' Strong Events
On the other hand where the
Cards are strong their rivals are cor
respondingly weak. Coach Christie's
squad is woefully weak in the shot put
and tlie discus, while Coach Temple
ton is blessed with men like Fleish
acker and Tandy who consistently
heave the shot around 42 feet and
throw the discus well out. There is a
possibility of a clean-up in the shot put
with Steve Way as the third man.
Sparling has little or no competition
in the javelin, heaving it around 165
feet.

Nelson and Edmonds are counted
upon to garner points in the hurdles.
The Cubs have only one man in the
highs who can turn in anything under
17, and, so far, have showed nothing
in the low sticks.
Mile Is Close
The mile is taken care of by Gooden,
who has run the distance in 4:44. In
the absence of Conner Jost will have
to fight it out for second place. Carley
and Marks are the best bets in the
two-mile run. Comparative times be
tween Carley and Funk, of California,
give the former the edge. As neither
has been pushed to the limit it is hard
to predict which one will break the
tape.
Stanford's hopes in the quarter-mile
lie with Dales and Moss. The former
runs the distance around 52 seconds
and, as the Cubs have lost their 440
'man through ineligibility, they will put
up no serious threat in this event.
Five points in the relay are practi
cally assured with such fast men as
Syer, Berry, McKinnon, and Dales.
