# INTERCLASS SOCCER BEGINS AS FRESHMEN TACKLE SOPHOMORES
## 
### 
Soccer teams representing the fresh
man and sophomore classes clashed
this afternoon in the first interclass
competition in this sport. Tomorrow
the seniors meet the juniors, and the
schedule is continued until each team
has met every other one. The last
game will be played on Aprli 21, unless
rain or wet grounds delay the comple
tion of the schedule.
Since none of the teams have been
able to practice enough during the past
week to work up any real co-ordina
tion, not much can be foretold as to
how the different squads will show up
under the strain of competition. The
schedule is as follows:
April 12 —Freshmen vs. Sophomores.
April 13 —Seniors vs. Juniors.
April 15 —Freshmen vs. Juniors.
April IG—Seniors vs. Sophomores.
April 20'—Freshmen vs. Seniors.
April 21 —Sophomores vs. Juniors.
