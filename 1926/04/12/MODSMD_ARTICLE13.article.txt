# VARSITY NINE HAS EVEN BREAK WITH BEARS TOMORROW
## Teams Meet in Second Game Of Baseball Series on California Diamond 
### Herb Klein 
The Stanford baseball team will
meet California tomorrow afternoon at
! 3:30 o'clock in the second game of
j the series on the West Field diamond
lat Berkeley. All indications point to a
close contest, closer probably than the
first contest over a week ago which
the Bears won 3 to 1, largely through
Stanford errors.
Rain kept the teams from practicing
all last week. Heavy hitting was one
lof the things that the Cards lacked
!in the first game and a week of daily
'batting practice might have helped a
lot.
Collins Starts in Box
Steve Collins has been picked by
'Wolter to start in the pitcher's box.
I His twirling, judging by his last per
formances, should be good enough, if
given satisfactory infield support, to
ihold California to a low number of
j Hits and let Stanford win on batting,
i provided they are in batting condition.
The rest of the lineup will be the
!same as for the first contest, with
Sypher catching, Draper at first, Gari
baldi on second. Cuddeback covering
I third, Busch scooping them up at
| shortstop, and Weaver, Nissen, and
| Clark in the outfield.
Wolter Confident
i Wolter feels confident that the
Cards have the stuff to defeat a team
even better than California's if they
are going right. The initial game
showed that both nines were playing
a far better game than is usually pro
duced by college teams. California had
a smooth-working infield and a couple
'of heavy hitters who, with a couple of
swats apiece, made up for those who
I were unable to connect with the ball.
1 Zanilock has three twirlers from
(which to choose. Noonan, Notfieclieck,
|and Clark, who was on the mound in
the first game. Clark was going in
great form and his peculiar low curve
and accurate form made him more
dangerous to the Cards than either of
the other two.
