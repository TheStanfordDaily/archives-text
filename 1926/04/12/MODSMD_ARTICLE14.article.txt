# EL TIGRE, ENCINA IV START INTRAMURAL BALL SEASON TODAY
## 
### 
After a week's delay and continued i
postponement, made necessary by the j
recent rainstorm, the intramural base- ;
! ball series, opens this afternoon on the '
1 physical education department and Se- '■
quoia diamonds. The games are being j
j played according to schedule, the post-1
j poned contests of last week having
I been carried over until the end of the (
season.
Leagues 111 and IV are to have their j
1 inning this afternoon, and what has
turned out to be the season opener
will also probably attract the most
attention —the game between Encina
IV and El Tigre, runners up in last
year's series. The Tigers are said to:
be a strong outfit and bent on better- j
ing their record of last season.
Breakers will also be closely watched
in their encounter with Encina V at
Sequoia. The clubmen are at present
leading in the annual intramural
| trophy race and may be counted on for ,
| a fight.
Five fraternity aggregations will
drop rushing activities for the moment
and begin battle. The day's schedule,;
which is called for 4:15 o'clock, is as
follows:
El Tigre vs. Encina IV, Diamond I.
Delta Kappa Epsilon vs. Theta Delta
