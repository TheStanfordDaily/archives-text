# IRREPAIRABLE LEAK CAUSES LEVEL OF LAGUNITA TO FALL
## 
### 
Despite the bounteous addi
tions provided by the storm of
last week, the water level in
Lagunita will continue to sink
because of the impossibility of
repairing the leak which has de
veloped in the north bank, accord
ing to Fred W. Frehe, foreman of
outside properties.
Although the lake came up ap
proximately four feet during last
week, without continued storms
the level will fall bacw to where
it was at the beginning of this
quarter. From this point the de
crease will be more gradual as
the level of the leak will have
been passed.
With ordinary weather canoe
ing will probably last no longer
than a month. The leak can not
be repaired until the lake is dry.
