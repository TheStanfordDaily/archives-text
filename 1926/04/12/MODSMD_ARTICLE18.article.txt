# FRATERNITY RUSHING COMMENCES UNDER NEW ORGANIZATION
## 
### 
Men's rusing under the new group
system started yesterday at 12:30
I when freshmen attended their first
luncheon dates at houses in the first
group who entertained at noon and
levelling meals. Today the second
group of fraternities do the rushing.
The group system allows each fra
jternity six luncheons and six dinners
"to entertain during the first period;
so each house has a chance to look
lover approximately 120 freshmen dur
ing that time. The first period will
iend Wednesday night, April 21, and
I the second period will begin Sunday
I noon, April 25. There will be no rush
ing between these periods, and no
rushing will be allowed on April 17,
the day of the Big Meet.
Much attention is being attracted by
Stanford's new rushing publications
recently, commenting favorably on it.
; Since the old method of pledging fresh
men as soon as they arrive at college
was abolished, a new system has been
jtried each year. The one adopted this
(year seems to have met with more
approval among the fraternities than
any yet tried, according to members
of the Interfraternity Council.
