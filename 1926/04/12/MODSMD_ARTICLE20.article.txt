# STANFORD MEN SWAMP OREGON IN TRACK MEET
## Northerners Fall Short of Adance Reports as to Team's Strength FINAL SCORE 121 TO 10 Coach Templeton's Athletes Take All First Places In Contest 
### Cliff Moore 
Stanford's varsity track team de
jfeated the University of Oregon track
jraen by the overwhelming score of 121
!to 10, in a dual meet staged Saturday
.afternoon on the old Stanford oval.
Coach Dink Templeton's athletes took
j every first place, and allowed the
northerners a second place in only one
! event.
Reports coming from the North pre
vious to the meet stated that Oregon
| was fairly strong in several of the
events, and that the Oregonians ex
ipected to give the Cardinals some stiff
competition. The Northerners showed
Inone of their reputed strength, how
ever, and Templeton's men had things
all their own way in every event.
Five Clean Sweeps
i Stanford made clean sweeps in five
events: the 100-yard dash, discus, shot
put, 440, and high jump. In addition to
this, the Cardinal athletes took all the
second places but one, three points in
the two-mile going to Niedenneir of
Oregon.
The meet was shifted from the sta
dium to the old field because of the
wet condition of the track. The old
track was also in fairly bad condition
and, because of this, the times made
in the track events were far from im
pressive. Some very good performances
jwere turned in in the field events,
however.
Hoffman and West Tie
j Hoffman and West tied for higli
| point honors with ten markers apiece.
Hoffman scored first places in the
shot put and discus, and West led the
field in both hurdle races.
Louis Gaspar upset the dope bucket
