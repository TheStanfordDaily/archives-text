# STANFORD MEN SWAMP OREGON IN TRACK MEET
## Northerners Fall Short of Adance Reports as to Team's Strength FINAL SCORE 121 TO 10 Coach Templeton's Athletes Take All First Places In Contest 
### Cliff Moore 
Stanford's varsity track team de
jfeated the University of Oregon track
jraen by the overwhelming score of 121
!to 10, in a dual meet staged Saturday
.afternoon on the old Stanford oval.
Coach Dink Templeton's athletes took
j every first place, and allowed the
northerners a second place in only one
! event.
Reports coming from the North pre
vious to the meet stated that Oregon
| was fairly strong in several of the
events, and that the Oregonians ex
ipected to give the Cardinals some stiff
competition. The Northerners showed
Inone of their reputed strength, how
ever, and Templeton's men had things
all their own way in every event.
Five Clean Sweeps
i Stanford made clean sweeps in five
events: the 100-yard dash, discus, shot
put, 440, and high jump. In addition to
this, the Cardinal athletes took all the
second places but one, three points in
the two-mile going to Niedenneir of
Oregon.
The meet was shifted from the sta
dium to the old field because of the
wet condition of the track. The old
track was also in fairly bad condition
and, because of this, the times made
in the track events were far from im
pressive. Some very good performances
jwere turned in in the field events,
however.
Hoffman and West Tie
j Hoffman and West tied for higli
| point honors with ten markers apiece.
Hoffman scored first places in the
shot put and discus, and West led the
field in both hurdle races.
Louis Gaspar upset the dope bucket
| when he defeated Dick Hyland in the
j century, Retting away to a fine start
and holding his advantage over the
| other sprinters for the entire distance.
After almost losing a third place in
:the short sprint, Coverly came through
i with a victory in the 220 by beating
l Caspar at the finish. Oregon scored a
ihalf-point in the furlong when Holt
tied Adams of Stanford for third place.
! Ted Miller held the lead all the way
•in the quarter-mile race and finished
|in his usual strong style. Captain Rich
jardson took an easy victory in the
| half-mile, in the good time of 1.57 4-10.
ICarlsmith finished a good second when
Ihe sprinted away from Overstreet of
Oregon.
Kerr Runs Good Race
Bill Kerr ran a nice race in the
mile and led his teammate, Ranney,
to the tape by over fifty yards. His
time, 4.29, was very good considering
the poor condition of the track. Swain
took the two-mile in a cautious man
ner, beating Niedermeir of Oregon by
;five yards. Nelson copped the last
i point for Stanford.
Hoffman led the Cardinal field men
iwith noteworthy distances in the
! weight events. He tossed the Greek
j platter 144 feet, 3V 2 inches, and
heaved the shot 47 feet % inch.
j Bob King continued his sensational
jumping by taking the high jump with
the good height of 6 feet 3 inches.
Tom Work, considered the best of
the Cardinal ozone climbers, seemed
i to be in his old slump, for he lost sec
jond to his teammate, Muhs. Macßae
[and Dyer placed one-two for Stanford
in the broad jump. Meeks, regarded
las the best of the Cardinal broad
I jumpers, did not enter the competition
'because of illness.
Joaquin Wins Javelin
i Tom Joaquin kept up his impressive
Iwork in the javelin by winning the
[event with a toss of 183 feet 7 inches.
[Harlow places second, and Shipkey's
j absence gave Wetzel of Oregon the
I third-place point.
