						Challenge to Coast Basketball

There are viewpoints and then again there are viewpoints. Likewise,
there are two sides to every question; meaning, that despite our pride in
Pacific Coast athletics, perhaps there is a grain of truth—however debat
able—in the following letter reprinted from the "Big Ten Weekly," the
unofficial sports publication of the Big Ten Conference. At least it is an
interesting opinion.
"Los Angeles, Cal.— Last year I attended Indiana University, there
fore 1 am bound to know something about the great game of the middle
west —basketball. Out here the sport writers are wont to call it "casaba."
California is a wonderful place to spend the winter and their football is
not to be criticised but when you are forced to sit and watch forty minutes
of the attempts they make at basketball it makes you long for the cold and
snow of the Conference schools, where they really do play basketball.
"1 have seen Southern California, Stanford, and California quintets
in action here and I really believe that I could pick four of my eastern
friends here and play all three of them to a standstill in the same evening.
And I must hasten to add that my name never blazed the sport pages in
Indiana either. But I attended Indiana and my friends are from Illinois,
DePauw, Wabash, and Chicago, and how can we hell) knowing a little
about the game.
"More power to Conference basketball teams.
"James Healey."
