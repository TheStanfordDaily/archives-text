On conclusion of a week's trial sixteen aspiring journalists have
been added to the editorial staff of the Daily. The original intention was
to accept only ten of the tryoutees, but the competition was so keen that it
was impossible to stay within this limit and yet do justice to all. As it was,
we were unable to give recognition to a few whose work was worthy of
note.
During the past week the aspirants were given an assignment each day;
and urged to spend their spare time assisting the regular staff members.
They were graded on their ability to write, promptness, and willingness to
work. The industry shown by the sixteen was gratifying. Providing
they do not let up, the Daily should benefit materially through their efforts.
The names of the successful candidates follows: women, Leslie Hill,
Sallie Kinsman, Janet Post, Ruth Tinsley, and Rosalie Walter; men, H.
Lawrence Beemer, Henry H. Clock, John H. Kelly, Walter B. Levin,
Frank T. Mittauer, Oliver S. Northcote, Richard J. O'Brien, William A.
Page, John M. Reily, Edward If. Sibbett, and Walter P. Walsh.
