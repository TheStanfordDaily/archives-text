# The 						Turning Point
## 
### 
After fourteen years of being the under dog, another Stanford major
sport team has turned on the Golden Bear and made him scurry to cover
with his tail ljetween his legs. Following the example of Pop Warner's
eleven, the varsity tennis team trounced California Saturday when many
thought it could not be done. The victory is the result of hard and con
sistent training, and is well deserved. What more conclusive proof could
be asked that tennis, in recent years come to be the most popular sport for
the majority of students, has reached its rightful place in intercollegiate
compteition ?
THERE WILL BE A MEETING of the Daily editorial staff in the
office at 1:00 o'clock tomorrow. Both old and new members are re
quested to attend. •
Modern tendencies come under ban in Canada, according fo the Mc-
Gill Daily:
"The skirts of the girl students at tlic Provincial Normal School must fall below
tlic knee to a point one-quarter of the distance from the knee cap to the ankle. It
was unofficially stated that many of the faculty were unable to continue their courses
for the rest of the year as they were suffering from eye-strain."
Downfall of the rough at Los Angeles High School:
"Students, hereafter, who attend school parties uninvited will receive demerits,
according to Miss Wolverton. The number to he given will vary, depending upon
the student's courtesy and politeness when told to leave the party."
Pleasing statement, which might bear a little scrutiny, from the Okla
homa Daily:
"Intelligent women arc not feasomc, awful creatures. They possess all of the
desires, wiles and ambitions of the dumbest woman. Intelligence makes them none
the less human."
