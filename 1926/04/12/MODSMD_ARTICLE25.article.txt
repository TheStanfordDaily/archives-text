FRESHMEN—IN SEASON AND OUT

(Editor's Note—There is no more certain way to get Cabbages thrown
! back than to throw them at rushing. Anyway the column is in need of con
tributions.)
After a conference with the venerable elder Cabbages that have long
I since become sauerkraut and the younger Brussels Sprouts of years to come,
i Cabbages has succeeded in compiling these interviews with three generations
of campus notables (the Slipperlines and the Razornecks), the subject being
the lowly frosh.
Autumn of 1896
(Rushing Season)
BROTHER SLIPPERLINE, SR. & President of B.T.P. (Bluff Those Pro
fessors) Stanford's first letter society (Greek or otherwise) —This year's fresh
| man class is ... one of the .... finest .... groups of
men that I have seen on this .... campus since I and Dr.
Jordan founded this university in ... . 1891.
BUD RAZORNECK, SR. (President of Stanford's first society for success
ful mastication) —The freshmen are indispensible to the university. They are
the juniors and seniors of the future. I sincerely hope that this class will get
onto itself and stay away from the Row. Such fine men should take every
precaution to avoid losing their individuality in a fraternity.
