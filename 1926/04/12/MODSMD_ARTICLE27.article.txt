# Husky-Princeton Crew Race Seems Assured
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OP WASHINGTON,
Seattle —(P. I. P.) —A Princeton-Wash
ington crew race on Lake Carnegie
some ten days before the Poughkeep
sie regatta seems assured. Information
received from <he Eastern school stat
ed that rowing authorities had prac
tically decided to invite the Washing
ton oarsmen to New Jersey for a pre-
Poughkeepsie race.
This race has been looming since j
the opening of the rowing season, and |
is especially desirable for Washing-!
ton's oarsmen to keep them in top i
form for the all-American classic on j
the Hudson. Princeton, Harvard, and 1
Yale have never entered shells in the I
Poughkeepsie regatta.
Charles Logg, Princeton crew men
tor, was a former Washington oars
man, and a student of the Conibear j
system, which has been made famous |
by Husky crews.
