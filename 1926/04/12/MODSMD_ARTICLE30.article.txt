# Triangular Conference Sports Day Cancelled
## 
### 
The Triangular Conference sports

women had planned at Berkeley Sat

last week made the California athletic
fields too soggy to be used. No sports
day will be held this year.
About 75 women from each institu
tion were to have attended the sports
( day as participants in basketball, ten
<nis, or swimming competition, or as
; officials.
