# U.C.S.B., MONTANA FIGHT OVER NICKNAME
## 
### 
I
The question of preventing other '
schools from using the name "Griz
zlies" for their athletic teams is the
problem before the central board of
i the University of Montana.
| Two years ago the University of
| California, Southern Branch, adopted j
the name "Grizzlies" for its teams, 1
though Montana athletes had been
known by that since 1897. When
this became known the board endea-
Ivored to have the U.C.S.B. students!
I change the name before it became too j
widely known, but it was unsuccessful.
There is a possibility that legal ac- i
tion may be taken. However, this will '
not be done unless all other methods j
fail. Legal action was suggested by
| the recent University of California
students' threat to resort to the courts j
to prevent the Mission ball club of
I San Francisco from using the name
I "Bears."
