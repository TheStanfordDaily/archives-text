UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
Seuttle —(P.l.P.) —The P. W. Keen,
latest addition to Washington's fleet
of racing shells, and named in honor
its donor, was christened and
launched at the crew house on the
shore of Lake Washington, Saturday,
April 3.
The new boat was built by George
Pocock, Washington's veteran shell
builder, in his shop behind the crew
quarters, and is the last word in shell
construction. It will be used by the
first varsity in the coming regatta with
the Golden Bear.
The faculty at the University of
Washington advocates that grades are
necessary evils.
