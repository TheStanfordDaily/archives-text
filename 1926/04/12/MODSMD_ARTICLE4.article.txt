# GLEE CLUB TO PRESENT HOME CONCERT FRIDAY
## 
### 
Tickets for the Glee Club's Annual
Home Concert next Friday night will
go on sale at one o'clock tomorrow
afternoon in the lobby of the Old
Union. Every seat in the Assembly
hall will be obtainable at $1.00 or 75
cents. As the concert comes the night
before the Big Meet a large alumni
attendance is expected.
The Glee Club will give the first
performance in the West of a remark
able new composition. The work is
"Dirge for Two Veterans," by Gustav
Hoist, a leading modern English com
poser. Warren D. Allen, director of the
club, recognizing the realism and
power of the composition, chose it for
the home concert, the biggest event
of the club's season.
Sing "Dirge for Two Veterans"
"Dirge for Two Veterans" is a set
ting of a poem in free verse by Walt
Whitman which depicts the burial of
two soldiers slain in battle. The music
was composed by Hoist soon after the
Great War and contains passages de
scriptive of the frightfulness of car
nage. The realism and brutal fearless
ness, characteristic of modern music,
are nowhere more strikingly expressed
than in this number.
A special accompaniment of brass
instruments will be given. They are
said to add the last touch of reality to
the war feeling.
Two prominent San Francisco musi
cians have been secured as guest

artists by the club. The yare Harry
Robertson, tenor, and Max Dolin, the
well-known violinist of the California
Theater, who will bring his instru
mental trio with him. Robertson and
Dolin will each have a group of solos
and the California Trio, composed of
violin, cello, and piano, will play sev
eral selections.
Dolin Will Play
Dolin will be heard in music of the
type he can do to perfection, such
favorites as the "Serenade," from
"The Student Prince," and "Indian
Love Call," from "Rose Marie." A
violin and cello duet, "Extaze," by
Ganne, will be another feature of
Dolin's group. He has notable tech
nique and has played in concert on
the European continent. A signed pho
tograph and a personal letter from the
late PresidentHar ding testify to the
pleasure the former chief executive
got from a concert given by Dolin at
the White House.
Leading his trio, Dolin will play a
Spanish tango dance and Liszt's Hun
garian Rhapsody.
The club will offer an entirely new
repertoire containing several notable
compositions besides the "Dirge." The
brilliant Finale number from the well
loved Gilbert and Sullivan comic
opera, "The Gondoliers," will close the
concert. Immediately following there
will be a one o'clock dance in the
Women's Clubhouse with music by
Hal Todd and his orchestra.

Dolin Will Play
Dolin will be heard in music of the
type he can do to perfection, such
favorites as the "Serenade," from
"The Student Prince," and "Indian
Love Call," from "Rose Marie." A
violin and cello duet, "Extaze," by
Ganne, will be another feature of
Dolin's group. He has notable tech
nique and has played in concert on
the European continent. A signed pho
tograph and a personal letter from the
late PresidentHar ding testify to the
pleasure the former chief executive
got from a concert given by Dolin at
the White House.
Leading his trio, Dolin will play a
Spanish tango dance and Liszt's Hun
garian Rhapsody.
The club will offer an entirely new
repertoire containing several notable
compositions besides the "Dirge." The
brilliant Finale number from the well
loved Gilbert and Sullivan comic
opera, "The Gondoliers," will close the
concert. Immediately following there
will be a one o'clock dance in the
Women's Clubhouse with music by
Hal Todd and his orchestra.
Tickets for the Glee Club's Annual
Home Concert next Friday night will
go on sale at one o'clock tomorrow
afternoon in the lobby of the Old
Union. Every seat in the Assembly
hall will be obtainable at $1.00 or 75
cents. As the concert comes the night
before the Big Meet a large alumni
attendance is expected.
The Glee Club will give the first
performance in the West of a remark
able new composition. The work is
"Dirge for Two Veterans," by Gustav
Hoist, a leading modern English com
poser. Warren D. Allen, director of the
club, recognizing the realism and
power of the composition, chose it for
the home concert, the biggest event
of the club's season.
Sing "Dirge for Two Veterans"
"Dirge for Two Veterans" is a set
ting of a poem in free verse by Walt
Whitman which depicts the burial of
two soldiers slain in battle. The music
was composed by Hoist soon after the
Great War and contains passages de
scriptive of the frightfulness of car
nage. The realism and brutal fearless
ness, characteristic of modern music,
are nowhere more strikingly expressed
than in this number.
A special accompaniment of brass
instruments will be given. They are
said to add the last touch of reality to
the war feeling.
Two prominent San Francisco musi
cians have been secured as guest

artists by the club. The yare Harry
Robertson, tenor, and Max Dolin, the
well-known violinist of the California
Theater, who will bring his instru
mental trio with him. Robertson and
Dolin will each have a group of solos
and the California Trio, composed of
violin, cello, and piano, will play sev
eral selections.
