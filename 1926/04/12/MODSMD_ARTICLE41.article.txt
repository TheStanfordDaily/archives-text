# BUSINESS SCHOOL HAS NEW BULLETIN READY
## 
### 
The 192G-27 Bulletin of the Graduate
School of Business which is now ready
tor distribution states that throughout
: its program of study the Graduate
| School will emphasize the essential
! unity of management.
! According to the bulletin, "Business
I management as a unifying and co-ordi
jnating force has hitherto received com
paratively little attention because
: business schools came into the system
of higher education at a time when
| specialization in professional study
was at its height.
"It was natural therefore for the
scientific study of business to be di
rected largely toward the functional
divisions of business —accounting, pro
duction, finance, marketing, advertis
ing—rather than management as a
whole. Without neglecting the prob
lems that arise in the several divi
sions of business, effort will be made
to develop such habits of mind that
students instinctively will think of a
business as a unit, and work out the
solution of problems with the require
ments of the whole business in mind."
Copies of the 1926-27 Bulletin of the
Gaduate School of Business may be
obtained upon request at the office of
the School or at the Registrar's office.
