## 
### 
! Inspection of the Stanford unit of
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps
was made Friday by Lieutenant-Col
onel Lewis Brown and Major Marin
Wise, from Washington, despite the
bad condition of the inspection field,
due to the rains last week.
Regular classes were gone over in
the morning, and during the afternoon,
because of inability to go through with
the planned drills, the sections were
called on to perform special functions.
Major William Geary, head of the
Stanford unit, expressed satisfaction
with the showing made by the stu
dents. Even under the bad weather
conditions a very creditable showing
was made, and he feels assured that
Stanford has a good chance to make
the degree of "distinguished college."
He stated further that the inspection
showed up much better than last year.
The freshman classes were called
on for gun drill, the sophomore classes
for harnessing artillery teams, the jun
iors for figuring firing data with instru
ments, and the senior classes for equi
tation and firing conduct.
The inspection officers would make
no comment on the rating made by
the college. Since all colleges inspected
desire to know their standing in com
parison with other colleges, the in
spectors say nothing whatever about
opniions derived from inspection. The
grades are taken, but not totalled until
the officers return to Washington.
Before coming to Stanford, the in
spectors visited the University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch, and today
are inspecting the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley. From there they
will go North and then East to Wash
ington, inspecting colleges all along
the route.
