# STANFORD AND U.C. FRESHMAN DEBATERS CLASH ON DRY LAW
## Question for Wednesday's Debate Is Legalization Of Wines, Beers 
### 
j Prohibition and its present status in
| the thoughts of the general public will
be discussed pro and con next Wednes
day night when the Stanford freshman
debating team upholds the affirmative
against the University of California's
trio of speechmakers on the question,
("Resolved, That the manufacture and
j sale of light wines and beers be legal
ized." The Cardinal representatives
will take the negative side of the argu
ment when the two yearling squads
meet again at Berkeley on Thursday.
Wednesday's forensic contest will be
[held in the Little Theatre at 8 o'clock.
Charles Prael, Leonard Kirkpatrick,
and George F. Mott, Jr., will represent
Stanford on Wednesday. The names
of the California debaters who will
oppose them have not yet been an
nounced. Each man will have a main
speech of ten minutes, and each team
will have two three-minute rebuttals
| and one five-minute rebuttal.
Leon Carley, Beverly McAnear, and
Robert Hume compose the team that
will face the Californians at Berkeley.
The work of both the negative and
affirmative teams will be watched with
a great deal of interest by those who
iare deeply concerned with the success
iof Stanford oratorical work, as these
|men show exceptional promise along
â€¢this line, according to Stanley A. Wei
| gel. varsity debater who is coaching
jthe members of the squad. They have
i spent a great deal of time in prepara
tion for this debate and should pre
sent a well-rounded argument cover
ing all of the phases of the question.
By emphasizing the recent develop
ments concerning prohibition and the
sale of light wines and beers, the de
baters hope to be able to present an
argument that will prove of interest
to the general public. The nation-wide
poll conducted by the different news
papers, the propositions that have
been advanced in the last few months
in favor of an amelioration of the
present system, and statistics that
I have been compiled to prove that pro
hibition was both a success and a fail
ure, will be handled with the idea of
j relating them to the real demands of
the public as they have been expressed
through various mediums of public
j opinion. /
