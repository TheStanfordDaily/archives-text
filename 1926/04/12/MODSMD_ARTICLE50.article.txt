Through a misinterpretation of in-!
formation given in connection with the !
election of Dean Willard E. Hotchkiss i
to the chairmanship of the recently!
created California Economic Research j
Council, the Daily Palo Alto made it :
appear that Dean Hotchkiss had been j
chairman of the Research Committee '
of the California Development Associa-1
tion. Henry M. Robinson, who was j
largely influential in the creation of ;
the new body, held this position.
