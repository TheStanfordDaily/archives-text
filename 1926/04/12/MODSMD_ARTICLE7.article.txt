# BABE TENNIS TEAM DEFEATS CALIFORNIA YEARLINGS EASILY
## Bear Cubs Lose Doubles Matches When Players Finish Tournament 
### 
By taking both of the doubles
matches remaining over from last
week, the Stanford freshman tennis
team Saturday won the annual meet
I with California, four matches to one.
John Wheatley and David Robb, in
dividual Cardinal singles winners, com
bined in first doubles to defeat Shir
ley Ward and Richard Hoogs of the
Bears, in straight sets, 6-0, 6-3. Lyn
don Farwell and Lawrence Hall, sec
ond Stanford team, were more closely
pressed.
Wheatley and Robb outplayed their
opponents from the start. Despite
Hoogs' powerful service and Ward's
good forehand drive, the Stanford pair
invariably put the ball into play.
Wheatley steadily made points out
right on fine volleys and Robb added
deception to the play by mixing high
lobs with heavily topped drives exe
cuted with apparently the same stroke.
