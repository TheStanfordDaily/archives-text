# 1-1 TIE MARKS OPENING MURAL BASEBALL PLAY
## Phi Psis, Phi Delts Deadlock As Snyde and Speer Score Homer Each DEKES 11, THETA DELTS 3 Four Games Scheduled for Todayâ€”Diamonds Will Be in Condition 
### 
Turning in one home run apiece as
a total score, the Phi Delts and Phi
Psis yesterday copped the honors for
the hottest game of the opening intra
mural round.
Fred Snyder did a "Casey at the
Bat" for the Phi Delts in the first in
ning, while Jack Speer clubbed the
single Phi Psi tally in the second.
Both teams lost opportunities for
further scoring in the remaining five
innings by narrow margins. The field
was in poor shape and the play was
rather ragged and characterized by
poor batting. McHose and David, and
Speer and Pabst, batteries for the Phi
Delt and Phi Psi teams respectively,
did creditable work.
Strong batting in the fourth and
sixth innings gave the Dekes a deci
sive victory in their game with the
Theta Delts, the final score ending at
11-3. Price, Sims, and Ackley figured
strongly in running up the Deke's high
total. Sims knocked out the best hit
of the game when he got a three-base
bingle in the fourth inning.
Strike-outs appeared prominently in
the scorebook records of each team.
Ackley and Nolan was the battery for
the Deke nine and Christ and Graves
i'or the Theta Delt squad.
Encina, failing to show up with the
keen competition it offered in basket
ball, was responsible for the two for
feits of yesterday's play. El Tigre won
by forfeit from Encina IV and Break
ers in the same manner from Encina V.
Phi Kappa Sigma did not have their
scheduled game with Branner II due
to the withdrawal of the latter from
the league.
All of the diamonds were in poor
condition because of the long grass
brought up by last week's rain. Sam
McDonald, superintendent of the ath
letic fields, is arranging to have the
grounds conditioned at once, so that
everything is expected to be in first
class order by tomorrow afternoon.
