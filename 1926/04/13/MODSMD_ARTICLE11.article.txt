# DEVELOPMENT OF MOTION PICTURES IS LECTURE TOPIC
## Edward Langley, Fairbanks' Director, to Speak in Little Theatre 
### 
Choosing as his topic "The Evolu
tion of the Motion Picture," Edward
Langley, technical director of the
Fairbanks-Pickford studio, will lecture
at 7:30 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre. "The first enemy of the mo
tion picture," said Langley recently in
an interview, "was the saloon. The
innovation of the motion picture as
an amusement gave many a new di
version and drew them away from the
saloons."
Langley, who has been with the
Fairbanks production company for
more than seven years, confesses that
his hobby is neither golf nor tennis,
but sketching and painting. Painting
the California desert and studying its
moods is his chief delight. He is a
painter of renown, having won many
honors with his canvasses.
Not only a technical director, but a
painter, a musician, a lecturer, and a
writer, Langley may be considered as
an important figure in the world of
art. He sings and plays the cello, is
writing a book on motion picture work,
and lectures frequently aside from his
work as technical director.
At present the artist has 250 sketch
es, drawings, engravings, and water
colorings on exhibition at the Cham
ber of Commerce in Los Angeles. He
is a member of the Painters and
Sculptors Club of California and a
member of the Board of Governors of
Artland, an artists' club of Los An
geles.
