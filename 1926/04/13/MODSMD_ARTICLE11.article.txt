# DEVELOPMENT OF MOTION PICTURES IS LECTURE TOPIC
## Edward Langley, Fairbanks' Director, to Speak in Little Theatre 
### 
Choosing as his topic "The Evolu
tion of the Motion Picture," Edward
Langley, technical director of the
Fairbanks-Pickford studio, will lecture
at 7:30 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre. "The first enemy of the mo
tion picture," said Langley recently in
an interview, "was the saloon. The
innovation of the motion picture as
an amusement gave many a new di
version and drew them away from the
saloons."
Langley, who has been with the
Fairbanks production company for
more than seven years, confesses that
his hobby is neither golf nor tennis,
but sketching and painting. Painting
the California desert and studying its
moods is his chief delight. He is a
painter of renown, having won many
honors with his canvasses.
Not only a technical director, but a
painter, a musician, a lecturer, and a
writer, Langley may be considered as
an important figure in the world of
art. He sings and plays the cello, is
writing a book on motion picture work,
and lectures frequently aside from his
work as technical director.
At present the artist has 250 sketch
es, drawings, engravings, and water
colorings on exhibition at the Cham
ber of Commerce in Los Angeles. He
is a member of the Painters and
Sculptors Club of California and a
member of the Board of Governors of
Artland, an artists' club of Los An
geles.
Research Attractive
"One of the beauties of a technical
director's work is the vast amount of
research necessary to gather informa
tion as a background for the produc
tion of any picture. Before we began
filming 'The Three Musketters' I read
thirteen histories of France in order
to understand the character of the
people, their mannerisms, how they
ate and drank, the size of the build
ings during that era, and other simi
lar things about the period.
"I think I have read all the pirate
stories ever written," declared Lang
ley in speaking of the preliminary
work on 'The Black Pirate,' which is
now playing in San Francisco and is
the first complete picture produced in
technicolor photography.
Langley, who is a pioneer in the
motion picture industry, started in the
field of photography before the intro
duction of the motion picture which
was first begun in 1901. For about six
years previous to that time, the di
rector was concerned with the produc
tion of slides and pictures.
Slides Once Used
In outlining the history of the slides,
Langley remarked: "When we wanted
to put on in a small town, an entertain
ment with slides, we secured a store,
whitewashed its back wall, arranged
some chairs in the room, and hung
out a big sign in front of the store.
There was no attempt made to have
the slides tell a continuous story ex
cept as one slide would represent a
man being chased up a tree by a dog
with the succeeding slide showing him
falling out of the tree.
"The large sum of five cents was
charged each person who came to the
entertainment. The whole show lasted
only about thirty minutes."
Begins With "The Spoilers"
Fifteen or sixteen years ago, Ed
ward Langley came to the Pacific
Coast as technical director of "The
Spoilers," the first big picture ever
produced on the Pacific Coast. He was
a member of the art staff producing
the Jack London series and was con
cerned with several other ventures in
the motion picture industry before be
coming an art director for Douglas
Fairbanks.
"We call them Doug and Mary," said
Langley, when asked about Mr. and
Mrs. Fairbanks. "Mary is one of the
sweetest girls I have ever known. She
is full of joy and happiness, and Doug
is full of pep, always playing a prank
on us or showing us a new trick.
"1 believe the success of the Fair
banks studio results from the co-oper
ation of the film stars and their staff
of workers." -
All the high schools in San Fran
cisco are to hear Edward Langley lec
ture on the motion picture. This morn
ing he spoke before the San Francisco
Polytechnic school and will address
the other student bodies during the
next two weeks.
