# VICTORIOUS CARDINAL SWIMMERS BACK ON CAMPUS FROM EAST
## 
### 
With prospects for a similar excur
sion next year, Ernst Brandsten, coach
of Stanford aquatic sports, and the
five-man swimming team which won
second place in the national intercol
legiate meet, arrived on the campus
yesterday after their Eastern trip
which lasted three weeks. Wallace
O'Connor returns with the lion's share
of the laurels, being undisputed inter
collegiate champion in the 220- and
440-yard free style events, and having
taken a good third to the famous Arne
j Borg and Harry Glancy in the national
I A.A.U. 500-yard title swim in Chicago.
| Dave Fall won second in the national
diving, being narrowly defeated by A1
i White, a former Stanford star and a
i
Brandsten product.
The other members of the team put
up a good showing all along the way.
Bob Williams stepped right along in
fast company to win a fourth place in
the 100-yard intercollegiate free style.
Williams performed better under com
petition that he had ever done previ
; ously.
Arden Allen placed fourth in the
1150-yard intercollegiate backstroke,
which was won in the fast time of
1:43. The speed that the college back
| strokers made is evident by compari
son with the national A.A.U. mark of
1:42 4-5 made by Walter Laufer of
! Cincinnati in Chicago a few days later.
| Allen was clocked at 1:47, which is a
full six seconds off his best time pre-
Ivious to the race. Carl Stevenson made
l his best times in the 440 1 in early
! meets in Southern California at the
! start of the trip, and did not seem to
] be able to hit his usual, speedy pace
in the East. A fourth in the 440 was
the best he could get.
The swimmers were received royally
! all along the way, they say. Every
town in which the team competed ex
' pressed the wish to meet the men
| again next year.
