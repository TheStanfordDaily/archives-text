# BURBANK FARM MAY BE TAKEN OVER BY STANFORD SAVANTS
## 
### 
Luther Burbank's experimental
farm at Sebastopol, from which
the famous horticulturist has
turned out many new plants,
trees, and shrubs that have been
of help to the world, is under
consideration by the University
with a view to combining the
farm with the botanical and hor
ticultural gardens now in pos
session of Stanford.
Friends of Burbank recently
proposed that the farm be oper
ated by Stanford. The University
has shown a willingness to take
over the plant if a sufficient en
dowment can be obtained to con
tinue the project in the same pro
portions that it has been run
under the leadership of Burbank.
According to President Wilbur
no funds have so far been pro
vided, so the matter is hanging
fire until such time as a definite
monetary arrangement can be
made.
