With a new repertoire, prominent musicians from San Francisco, and
a successful season behind them, the Stanford Glee Club appears in its
Annual Home Concert Friday night. In a way, the appearance of the club
will be a welcome to alumni returning for the Big Meet as well as a
farewell concert to the campus.
Warren D. Allen, the club's director, has brought his organization to a
degree of efficiency and perfection. As an illustration one may point to
the favorable publicity ~ the club during their week's engage
ment at at the Pantages >an Francisco. The offer of the man

tages patrons are in ther ute to Mr. Allen's work.
It is certain that the he club Friday will be all that is de
sired by music-lovers, 'i the organization all season, in fact,
has been reflected in its of varied and difficult pro
grams. Numbers ranging v issic to the old negro spirituals have
been included and have b» n by the campus in its willing sup
port of the club.
We are glad to have tl y of once more hearing Mr. Allen
and his organization.
