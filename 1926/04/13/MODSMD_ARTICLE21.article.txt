### 
Ernie Brandsten and his traveling swimmers are home again. With
out the flare of trumpets and admiring glances of the depot-thousands that
they deserved, they arrived at the University yesterday after a three-weeks
tour of the East.
Stanford may see much in Brandsten and his team to be proud of.
Handicapped by wearisome travel, by meets every few days from which
they were rushed immediately to trains, the swimmers, nevertheless, won
a majority of the competitions and ended with a second place in the inter
collegiates.
Because Brandsten so frequently turns out winning teams and
winning individuals, we are apt to expect him always to "deliver the
goods," and we receive swimming victories with little or no appreciation
in return.
Truly, however, the University feels that it has in its midst a great
asset in the unassuming water-sports coach.'' To send him on a mission
is to know in advance that the Stanford name will be somewhere at the top
and by this confidence we quietly show our appreciation of his efforts.
