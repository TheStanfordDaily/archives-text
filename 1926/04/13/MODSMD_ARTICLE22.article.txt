A few months ago a typewriter mysteriously disappeared from the
office of the Quad. Now the manager of the yearbook reports that a
second machine is missing. Both of teh typewriters were rent-machines;
and if they arc not located the Quad will face a considerable financial
output.
There was a time in the history of the University when property was
secure. It is hoped that the persons who borrowed, lost, or stole the ma
chines will restore them immediately, and not prolong this period of in
security.
New style of aquatic sports in Pasadena High as reported in the Pasa
dena Chroniclc:
"While diving through one of the glass doors in the Manual Arts building last
week, Don Clark severely cut his left hand.
"Fortunately the door contained plate glass, which docs not splinter like cheaper
brands. A friend pushed Don, causing him to fall through the door backwards. The
bill for the glass will cost them $27."
Great truth which comes close to home at times. The University Daily
Kansan:
"A clock that does not run is not of much use in the reserve room of a univer
sity library. It becomes a bore. The hundreds of students who look at it many
times during the day have a right to protest. A clock is not a clock unless it runs."
