# THE
						TERRIBLE TALE OF TOOT
## 
### 
Bo Hunk Us was a merry knight who had a fine estate,
All filled with serfs and other guys who lived within his gate.
The times were such that old Bo Hunk had grub and wine galore,
But, like most other selfish knights, he always wanted more.
He drove his serfs to growing grapes and raising pigs and wheat,
And when the villeins had 'em grown, he'd glomm 'em—very neat!
But soon his villagers began to peter out on land,
And grub and wine got kind of scarce and not at his command.
So Bo Hunk sent his warriors to raid on neighbor Toot—
They caught the old gent unawares and bashed him on his snoot.
They gathered all his wine and grub, and just because he fought,
They beat him up quite scandalous, because he hadn't ought!
To injury, insult was made—poor Toot was hailed to court,
To show why he had scrapped that day—why, he'd performed a tort!
The trial came up—'twas by ordeal—cold water was the means;
They took old Toot into the church and robbed him of his jeans;
Their method was to throw him in, and let him swim or sink.
The guilty man was he who swam; so sinking'd save a gink!
i
Of course, poor Toot was innocent; as in he fell, he sank;
But this was not sufficient proof for those around the tank.
They argued and decided then his proof was good and sound —
But innocence was not worth much—for poor old Toot had drowned!
