George White's Scandals—Columbia
j Theater—Reputation is an excellent
thing, especially when it extends from
coast to coast. With this power, merit
can gradually slip into the back
ground; and it takes some time before
S the camouflage may be penetrated,
i This seems to be the reason that is
j carrying George White's Scandals
I through its present run at the Colum
i bia Theater in San Francisco.
True enough, the chorus contains
beautiful girls, girls, and more girls.
Each is as beautiful as the other. And
the costumes are wonderful, as,far as
they go; a few butterflies here and
I'there, a basket of fruit, and a few
j bolts of almost transparent material,
j But this feature alone does not make
a really interesting and attractive
show.
Tne lack of good comedians dis
tressing. Joke after joke fell flat. Any
good bull session for the past year has
included all of them; in fact, George
White and his assistants might get a
few good ideas if they would listen in
at a gathering.
However, one thing must be given
great credit. White has an excellent
taste for the spectacular. Each scene
in itself was a spectacle with amazing
scenery and the best in stage direc
tion.
There are some spots in the show,
to be sure, that are comparatively
bright. They are perhaps quite as shin
ing as the bright spots of the other
caravaning shows that wend their way
westward over mountains and desert.
Some of the people like Sonia de-
Calve, who has a rare operatic name,
for the singing, Jeannette Brown in
dances, songs, and knee rouge, Johnnie
Getz in various brands of whiskers,
Fred Lighter, the dancers, Jennie
Lind and deNaros, all work hard and
enjoy applause for their efforts.
