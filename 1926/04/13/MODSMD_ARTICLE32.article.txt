The axerage of all Princeton alumni
is but 34.38 years, according to an
enterprising statistician. The informa

graduates of Old Nassau indulged in
golf quite upsets the generally accept

It was found that 68.4* per cent of
ihe graduates are married men whose
average number of children is 1.48.
Princeton alumni own one and one
third motor cars apiece.
