Evansville College, Indiana, will
have a new athletic field for the 1926
football season. This field was made
financially possible largely by the suc
cess of the basketball season. A large
part of the work will be carried on by
the students, so that they may have
the opportunity both of earning money
and of helping in the expansion of the
college.
