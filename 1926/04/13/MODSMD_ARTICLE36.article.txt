"Recent tendencies to drink lemon
ade and coffee in preference to heavier
drinks is one of the surprising changes
in attitude of the students in Ger
many," declared Professor Charles
David Marx, emeritus of the civil en
gineering department, who spoke on
"Impressions of Germany" before the
Cosmopolitan Club which met last
night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Professor Marx visited Germany
last fall in order to attend the cen
tenary celebration of the Polytechnic
of Karlsruhe, where he graduated in
1881.
"I was impressed by the remarkable
progress made in the educational situ
ation in Germany since the War. One
of the changes occurring since I at
tended the Polytechnic is the opening
of the doors to women who are hold
ing their own in scholarship.
"The students are earnest and are
not ashamed of honest labor, an atti
tude not held a few years ago when
it was considered beneath the dignity
of a student to work. Conservative as
a whole, the student body, neverthe
less, has a nationalistic tendency."
Sports Favored
Interest in sports of all sorts includ
ing tennis, football, and boating, has
increased within the last few years.
That Germans are abreast of the times
in dancing is shown by the fact that
the Charleston is as popular there as
it is in America, according to Profes
sor Marx.
"High practice tariffs existing in
all parts of Europe make it difficult
for Germany to find an outlet for her
products. Her factories were in good
condition when I was there, but there
was little evidence of activity because
products could not be sold. Business
failures have been numerous, and un
employment has been widespread, but
conditions now are somewhat more en
couraging in the business field.
Tn speaking of progress in the elec
trical industry, Marx pointed out that
hearty co-operation exists between the
American and German electrical work
ers, a favorable situation aiding the
establishment of a better feeling be- j
tween Germany and other countries.
Electrical development in the South
German states has been rapid and is j
flourishing.
