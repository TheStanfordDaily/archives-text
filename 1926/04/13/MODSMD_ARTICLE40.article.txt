# SPORTS OF 1926
## Is Babe Superstitious? 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Will Babe Ruth succeed in his widely-advertised comeback in spite of the
ominous thirteen that hovers over his head? Can he bat out hits and bring
in runs as he did of yore? Will his work in the season starting today bring
him another fat contract when winter comes? In the words of the inimitable
Milt Gross, "Dunt esk!" for only time and Ruth can answer.
But. if he's at all susceptible to signs and omens (and what super-star isn't
superstitious?) the Home Run King must feel at least slightly concerned over
the recurrence of the unlucky number in his record as he takes the field for
the opening game in Boston today.
In the first place, it's the thirteenth, a bad day to start anything, espe
cially your thirteenth season in the major leagues. Ihen this all happens
in the "year 1926, and '26 is twice 13. Babe's first hit, which will probably
come today, will be his 1354 th, and each and every one of his next 46 hits
will be his thirteen-huiulred-and-something-or-other. Disciples of numerology
will soon discover that 1 and 3 and 4 and 4 add up to 13. And that isn't all.
George Herman's (thirteen letters there!) lifetime batting average is .346.
Add up those digits, boy. My Gawd â€”another 13! What's left? Oh, yes, his
home runs. He's made 309 to date, therefore his next, and his first one in his
thirteenth season, will be his 310 th. And 3 and 10 are 13. That makes eight
thirteens so far. Five more will make it unanimous, so here they are: In 1916
he was at bat 136 times; in 1919 he player 130 games, and also made 139 hits.
And he made a total of 13 home runs in the years 1917 and 1918, and stole a
total of 13 bases in the years 1918 and 1919.
Go to it, Big Boy; sock that jinx-number a mile over the right-field
bleachers.
