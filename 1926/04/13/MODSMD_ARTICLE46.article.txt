## 
### 
The last lap of intramural and inter
class athletic competition began
with the opening of intramural
baseball and interclass soccer yester
day afternoon. The other sports left
are golf, handball, tennis, track, relay,
and water polo.
Tomorrow sees the start of inter
class tennis. All classes except the
juniors have arranged for matches,
according to C. W. Davis, intramural
director. The tennis squads are com
posed of eight men each, four playing
singles and four playing doubles. The
men now listed to play for each class
are open to challenges by any other
member of the class and if beaten will
be eliminated and the victor put on
the list.
Water polo will solve a number of
undecided places in the swimming
schedule. While the Seniors have first
place cinched, the other classes are
scrambling for the second, third, and
fourth places. The distribution of the
10-4-2 points may give the places to
any of the three classes left.
Next week the quarterly handball
tournament will start. This tourna
ment is mainly to give competition to
men desirous of keeping in form and
practice. No points for the intramural

The Emerald Lake Country Club, at
Redwood City, has offered the Univer
sity the use of its links to play off the
golf tourney which will start the first
week in May. The Burlingame Country
Club, where the matches were played
last year, was considered too far from
the campus for the great number of
matches to be played. The Club at
Redwood City is only a nine-hole
course, but has just put in new greens
and is in excellent shape.
No varsity or freshman team mem
bers will be allowed to compete in the
golC tournament this year. Already, ac
cording to C. W. Davis, thirty-eight
teams have signed up to play, and sev
eral more are expected. Due to this
large number, it will take several days
for the matches to be finished.
Track and relay meet days have not
been arranged yet, but promise much
interest, as several relay teams have
been entered and men are listed in
eve*y event of track and field events.
The relay teams consist of eight men,
each of whom will run 220' yards.
These events will cap the heaviest
intramural season that the campus has
seen. Director C. W. Davis has at
tempted to get as many men interested
in athletics in this way as he could,
and from the turnout that he has had,
he feels that the men have responded
very favorably.

bers will be allowed to compete in the
golC tournament this year. Already, ac
cording to C. W. Davis, thirty-eight
teams have signed up to play, and sev
eral more are expected. Due to this
large number, it will take several days
for the matches to be finished.
Track and relay meet days have not
been arranged yet, but promise much
interest, as several relay teams have
been entered and men are listed in
eve*y event of track and field events.
The relay teams consist of eight men,
each of whom will run 220' yards.
These events will cap the heaviest
intramural season that the campus has
seen. Director C. W. Davis has at
tempted to get as many men interested
in athletics in this way as he could,
and from the turnout that he has had,
he feels that the men have responded
very favorably.
The last lap of intramural and inter
class athletic competition began
with the opening of intramural
baseball and interclass soccer yester
day afternoon. The other sports left
are golf, handball, tennis, track, relay,
and water polo.
Tomorrow sees the start of inter
class tennis. All classes except the
juniors have arranged for matches,
according to C. W. Davis, intramural
director. The tennis squads are com
posed of eight men each, four playing
singles and four playing doubles. The
men now listed to play for each class
are open to challenges by any other
member of the class and if beaten will
be eliminated and the victor put on
the list.
Water polo will solve a number of
undecided places in the swimming
schedule. While the Seniors have first
place cinched, the other classes are
scrambling for the second, third, and
fourth places. The distribution of the
10-4-2 points may give the places to
any of the three classes left.
Next week the quarterly handball
tournament will start. This tourna
ment is mainly to give competition to
men desirous of keeping in form and
practice. No points for the intramural
schedule are given.
The Emerald Lake Country Club, at
Redwood City, has offered the Univer
sity the use of its links to play off the
golf tourney which will start the first
week in May. The Burlingame Country
Club, where the matches were played
last year, was considered too far from
the campus for the great number of
matches to be played. The Club at
Redwood City is only a nine-hole
course, but has just put in new greens
and is in excellent shape.
