# INTENSIVE MINING BEGUN BY CARDS FOR CALIFORNIANS
## Outstanding Event Will Be Richardson vs. Boyden Race in Half-Mile 
### Clif Moore 
After indulging in a light workout
Saturday afternoon at the expense of
the University of Oregon's track and
field team, Coach Dink Templeton's
athletes will spend the rest of this
i week in intensive preparation for the
Big Meet with the University of Cali
fornia which will be held next Satur
day on the Stanford stadium oval.
The meet promises to be close
throughout, and every event will un
doubtedly produce a great struggle for
the honors. Stanford is given a slight
edge over the Bruins as a result of the
respective scores made against the
| University of Southern California, but
i dope predictions are a very unsafe
matter when Stanford and California
i teams meet in any sport, so upsets
! may be expected as a regular occur
rence in the Big Meet.
Several events vie for the limelight
1 in the meet. The annual half-mile race
between Captain Bill Richardson of
i Stanford and Eddie Boyden of Cali
! fornia takes on its usual great import
j ance. Boyden defeated the Cardinal
I leader in the freshman race three
1 years ago in one of the most spectacu
i lar struggles in first-year track history.
Alternate Wins
! The following year, with Richardson
running one of his first races for the
varsity, he defeated Boyden, then com
peting for the Olympic Club. Last year
Boyden turned the tables on Richard
i son, but was forced to establish a new
coast record in order to beat the Stan
ford runner. Both men have covered
the two-lap event consistently around
! 1.56 all season, and it may be that
their race Saturday will see a new
I record go by the boards.
California supporters are claiming
that Wilbern Talbot is one of the most
i promising quarter-mile men that have
I ever come under the direction of the
| Bear coach, Walter Christie. Talbot
ran a fast race in the freshman meet
last year, and this season has been a
| consistent winner in the 440 event.
Opposed to him will be Ted Miller, who
is considered the greatest quarter
j miler on the coast.
Miller After Record
Miller has rarely gone over the 49
j seconds mark this year, and if he is
j forced to his best by the Bear 440
man he is very liable to break the rec
ord he set in the Big Meet last year.
Miller and Talbot should produce one
of the most thrilling fights on the
schedule, with the Stanford ace having
the advantage.
The weight events promise to be
great struggles between Biff Hoffman
of Stanford and the Bruin weight
tosser, Gerkin. Hoffman has made
some creditable distances this season
and has steadily improved his marks
in each meet. Gerkin has not shown
too much class in the California meets
so far, but his ability as a competitive
athlete is well known; so the Cardinal
star can be assured of stiff competi
j tion. Evans of Stanford is another
j comer in the weights, and his perform
ances in the Big Meet will be watched
closely by Cardinal followers.
Tom Work seems to hold an effec
tive Indian sign over Hampton of Cali
fornia in the high jump. Hampton has
met defeat at the hands of the Cardi
nal jumper for two years, and both
times has failed to even approach ad
vance notices concerning his ability.
Bob King, who won the Stanford-
U.S.C. high jump with a leap of 6 feet
4 inches, must be considered as a
strong contender for first place in the
Big Meet, and he may outjump both
his teammate and opponent for the
honors.
Barber Is Favorite
Captain Jim Barber is conceded a
decided advantage in both sprint
events. He has been clocked at 9.9 in
the century and 22.1 in the 220>-yard
event, and his consistent victories all
season give him the place of favorite
against the Cardinal sprinters. Hyland
has come before the public in the last
week and his running has been good
enough to make track enthusiasts be
lieve that i>e will force the Bear cap
tain in the century. Coverly is picked
to form the main opposition for Bar
ber in the furlong.
The mile rac-e bringing together Bill
Kerr of Stanford and Les Schwobeda
of California also should result in a
close finish. Kerr is capable of doing
under 4.25 in the four-lap event, and
Schwobeda has been clocked close to
this mark several times.
Meeks and Macßae of Stanford, and
Bondshu of California, will probably
battle for first place in the broad jump.
Meeks has jumped well over the 23-
foot mark on several occasions, and
with his victory in the U.S.C. meet as
strong evidence of his ability, is con
ceded the edge over Macßae and
Bondshu.
The above-mentioned events appear
as the highlights of the Big Meet, and
as can be readily seen, the unlooked
for may be the case in any of them.
It is now a parable that any Stanford-
California meet is productive of a
number of thrills and close finishes,
and this year's Big Meet should be no
exception to the rule.
