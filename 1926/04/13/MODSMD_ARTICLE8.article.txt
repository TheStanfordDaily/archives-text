# '29 Plots Revenge For Loss of Cub Baseball Opener
## 
### 
Facing California in an attempt to
keep on even terms in the annual
freshman baseball series, the 1929
team will meet the Blue and Gold
Cubs in their second game tomorrow
afternoon on the Berkeley diamond.
Coach Husky Hunt's men will close
the 1926 in case they do not avenge
the 7-3 defeat handed them two weeks
ago. A deciding game will be arranged
if the Cards come through with a vic
tory.
With the exception of second base
and pitcher, Hunt will start practically
the same line-up he used in the last
game. Hartley, regular inflelder and
lead-off man, has been out with an
infected knee. The babe inflelder
played the entire first game with a
temperature of more than one hun
dred degrees, and although he reported
yesterday afternoon, will probably be
unable to play. Wilton will probably
take his place at second, while Marx
is slated for the former's berth at cen
ter field.
Kern will open the game for the
babes on the mound. Kern and Lewis
have alternated in the box for the
freshmen. The latter pitched a fine
game last week, striking out seven
California batters and giving only one
walk. The sixth inning, however,
brought grief to the Cards, the Berke
ley men connecting with the Stanford
hurler's offerings easily, and being
aided by misplays of the yearling's
fielders.
Stanford's big handicap, according
to Hunt, is the listlessness with which
his charges are playing. If this is
remedied, the game tomorrow will re
sult in a different story, according to
the optimistic Cardinal coach. Hitting
practice held during the past week
seems to indicate that the freshmen
have recovered from their slump. The
babes were able to garner only five
hits from Schafer, the Bruin pitcher,
while six errors aided in giving Cali
fornia the victory.
Choice at catch will again fall upon
Brown, whose work has marked him
as one of the best of the 1929 players.
Wright will start at first, Harder at
third, and Roger at short. McKey and
Davis, together with Marx, will start
in the field.
California's probable lineup is as
follows: Norton, serond base; Betz,
right field; Cavalero, center field;
Stevenson, first base; Sorocco, left
field; Swenson, shortstop; Cook, third
base; Roberts, catcher; Johnson or
Schafer, pitcher.

Cubs in their second game tomorrow
afternoon on the Berkeley diamond.
Coach Husky Hunt's men will close
the 1926 in case they do not avenge
the 7-3 defeat handed them two weeks
ago. A deciding game will be arranged
if the Cards come through with a vic
tory.
With the exception of second base
and pitcher, Hunt will start practically
the same line-up he used in the last
game. Hartley, regular inflelder and
lead-off man, has been out with an
infected knee. The babe inflelder
played the entire first game with a
temperature of more than one hun
dred degrees, and although he reported
yesterday afternoon, will probably be
unable to play. Wilton will probably
take his place at second, while Marx
is slated for the former's berth at cen
ter field.
Kern will open the game for the
babes on the mound. Kern and Lewis
have alternated in the box for the
freshmen. The latter pitched a fine
game last week, striking out seven
California batters and giving only one
walk. The sixth inning, however,
brought grief to the Cards, the Berke
ley men connecting with the Stanford
hurler's offerings easily, and being
aided by misplays of the yearling's
fielders.
Stanford's big handicap, according
to Hunt, is the listlessness with which
his charges are playing. If this is
remedied, the game tomorrow will re
sult in a different story, according to
the optimistic Cardinal coach. Hitting
practice held during the past week
seems to indicate that the freshmen
have recovered from their slump. The
babes were able to garner only five
hits from Schafer, the Bruin pitcher,
while six errors aided in giving Cali
fornia the victory.
Choice at catch will again fall upon
Brown, whose work has marked him
as one of the best of the 1929 players.
Wright will start at first, Harder at
third, and Roger at short. McKey and
Davis, together with Marx, will start
in the field.
California's probable lineup is as
follows: Norton, serond base; Betz,
right field; Cavalero, center field;
Stevenson, first base; Sorocco, left
field; Swenson, shortstop; Cook, third
base; Roberts, catcher; Johnson or
Schafer, pitcher.
