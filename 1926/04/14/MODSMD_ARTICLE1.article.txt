# SPECIAL VOTE GRANTED FOR CAPTAIN RULE
## Petition Requesting Election Accepted, Though Not Correct in Form BALLOTING SET TUESDAY Many Fictitious Signatures Found on List Given To Ex Committee 
### Frank Baker 
A special election will be held next
'Tuesday, April 20, on the action taken
by the Executive Committee at its
last meeting to change the date of
electing athletic team captains from
the end of the preceding season to the
last of the current season of competi
tion. This action was taken last night
by the Committee after receipt of the
following petition from a body of stu
dents :
We, the undersigned students, feel
ing that the action of the Executive
Committee in changing the time of
election of captains for the various
sports was without proper considera
tion and discussion, hereby request
that the measure be put to a vote of
the student body.
According to Article 14 of the con
stitution the action of the Executive
Committee is nullified uutil approved
by a majority vote of the student body
in a special election.
Petition Accepted
Robert E. Lewis, President of the
A.S.S.U., states that although the pe
tition was not in the correct form, and
several fictitious names were affixed
to the list, the Committee accepted the
petition, feeling that there were suf
ficient right names on it to represent
the required twenty-five signatures.
The Executive Committee is anxious
that students think seriously over the
problem in question, and while desir
ing that its action be approved, wants
above all to get an honest opinion
from the student body as a whole. It
passed the motion to change the date
of captaincy elections after several
weeks of discussion, and after opin
ions had been received from the coach
ing staff of the University. The new
idea originated not in the Executive
Committee, but on the coaching staff.
Coaches Favor Plan
As presented in the discussion the
main argument in favor of the plan
and the one which has recommended
it to several other colleges in various
.sections of the country, is that if there
is no regular captain a coach need
have no hesitation in taking a man
out of the game just because he is !
the elected leader of the team.
Another idea set forth was that the j
men who elect a captain for the fol-1
lowing season at the end of the pre- !
ceding one are mostly men who are j
graduating and will not he playing ;
with him the next year, and do not
know if he will be the same type of
player in the following season that he ;
has been in the past.
Opposing Arguments
The opponents to the action have j
put forth mainly the arguments that I
it is the tradition of the University to
elect captains at the end of the pre- j
ceding season, and that the captain |
inspires the men to put more into the J
game. The Committee, however, felt
that a thing that was injurious to the
prospects of an athletic team, whether
a tradition or not, should be abolished.
In answer to the other opposing argu-1
ment, the Committee heard several
athletes who were at the meeting, and
who stated that the natural leader
inspired the men whether he was a
captain or not.
The vote Tuesday will be an appro
val or disapproval by the student body
of the action of the Committee. A ma
jority in favor of the motion will
pass it.

Committee in changing the time of
election of captains for the various
sports was without proper considera
tion and discussion, hereby request
that the measure be put to a vote of
the student body.
According to Article 14 of the con
stitution the action of the Executive
Committee is nullified uutil approved
by a majority vote of the student body
in a special election.
Petition Accepted
Robert E. Lewis, President of the
A.S.S.U., states that although the pe
tition was not in the correct form, and
several fictitious names were affixed
to the list, the Committee accepted the
petition, feeling that there were suf
ficient right names on it to represent
the required twenty-five signatures.
The Executive Committee is anxious
that students think seriously over the
problem in question, and while desir
ing that its action be approved, wants
above all to get an honest opinion
from the student body as a whole. It
passed the motion to change the date
of captaincy elections after several
weeks of discussion, and after opin
ions had been received from the coach
ing staff of the University. The new
idea originated not in the Executive
Committee, but on the coaching staff.
Coaches Favor Plan
As presented in the discussion the
main argument in favor of the plan
and the one which has recommended
it to several other colleges in various
.sections of the country, is that if there
is no regular captain a coach need
have no hesitation in taking a man
out of the game just because he is !
the elected leader of the team.
Another idea set forth was that the j
men who elect a captain for the fol-1
lowing season at the end of the pre- !
ceding one are mostly men who are j
graduating and will not he playing ;
with him the next year, and do not
know if he will be the same type of
player in the following season that he ;
has been in the past.
Opposing Arguments
The opponents to the action have j
put forth mainly the arguments that I
it is the tradition of the University to
elect captains at the end of the pre- j
ceding season, and that the captain |
inspires the men to put more into the J
game. The Committee, however, felt
that a thing that was injurious to the
prospects of an athletic team, whether
a tradition or not, should be abolished.
In answer to the other opposing argu-1
ment, the Committee heard several
athletes who were at the meeting, and
who stated that the natural leader
inspired the men whether he was a
captain or not.
The vote Tuesday will be an appro
val or disapproval by the student body
of the action of the Committee. A ma
jority in favor of the motion will
pass it.
A special election will be held next
'Tuesday, April 20, on the action taken
by the Executive Committee at its
last meeting to change the date of
electing athletic team captains from
the end of the preceding season to the
last of the current season of competi
tion. This action was taken last night
by the Committee after receipt of the
following petition from a body of stu
dents :
