# DELTA CHI SWAMPS SIGMA NU SQUAD IN INTRAMURAL GAME
## 
### 
I Piling up the big score of 19 runs,
Delta Chi completely swamped Sigma
j Nu in the second day of intramural
j baseball play yesterday afternoon. Tak-i
j ing advantage of the weakness of *
their opponent's battery the Delta Clii "
; squad was able to get away for some
strong batting, at the same time hold- !
| ing the Sigma Nus down to 7 runs.
Sigma Nu made a strong threat in
| the third inning when they combined
j some good batting with a whole series i:
of Delta Chi fumbles and brought in
four runs. The lead amounted to noth
ing, however, for the Delta Chis start- i
ed a regular merry-go-round immedi- j
ately afterward which netted them 7 j
hits and 10 runs in a single inning.
Sequoia I Wins
In its game with Alpha Kappa
Lambda, Sequoia I played aggressive
ball to win, 9-1. The hall men gath-1
j ered hits in each inning except the!
j seventh, while only in the third and
j fifth did A.K.L. threaten.
Dawson, centerfielder for the fra-
I ternity team, came into the limelight
!by hitting a three-bagger and later
1 making an impossible catch in a re- j
mote part of the outfield which passes j
as the Sequoia diamond. So weed-in- j
i fested is this lot, that at a critical ;
juncture in the last inning, the game
j had to be halted in order to remove a I
' gopher snake, hidden in the vegeta-!
! tion, which threatened to obstruct the ,
| play.
Alpha Sigs Default
The only other notable hit of the
afternoon was garnered by Dave;
Brown, Sequoia pitcher, who tried to
I force a good double into a triple, but
i was snagged. His hit brought in a 1
| run, however. Brown, along with Lewis !
McCuen, catcher, was quite successful
in shutting out the A.K.L. batters.
Burt Busch put the screws on the
! Enclna basement team, allowing only
| two hits, and thus opened the way for
lan El Toro victory by a score of 4
' to 1. The El Toro pitcher has a de-1
ceptive delivery which all but blanked
| the freshmen. Aside from this twirling,
the game was uninteresting.
Alpha Sigma Phi took a vacation
! yesterday, and as a consequence El ■
Campo won by default what was ex
l pectod to be a well-contested game, in-'
! asmuch as El Campo holds the Uni-|

four runs. The lead amounted to noth
ing, however, for the Delta Chis start- i
ed a regular merry-go-round immedi- j
ately afterward which netted them 7 j
hits and 10 runs in a single inning.
Sequoia I Wins
In its game with Alpha Kappa
Lambda, Sequoia I played aggressive
ball to win, 9-1. The hall men gath-1
j ered hits in each inning except the!
j seventh, while only in the third and
j fifth did A.K.L. threaten.
Dawson, centerfielder for the fra-
I ternity team, came into the limelight
!by hitting a three-bagger and later
1 making an impossible catch in a re- j
mote part of the outfield which passes j
as the Sequoia diamond. So weed-in- j
i fested is this lot, that at a critical ;
juncture in the last inning, the game
j had to be halted in order to remove a I
' gopher snake, hidden in the vegeta-!
! tion, which threatened to obstruct the ,
| play.
Alpha Sigs Default
The only other notable hit of the
afternoon was garnered by Dave;
Brown, Sequoia pitcher, who tried to
I force a good double into a triple, but
i was snagged. His hit brought in a 1
| run, however. Brown, along with Lewis !
McCuen, catcher, was quite successful
in shutting out the A.K.L. batters.
Burt Busch put the screws on the
! Enclna basement team, allowing only
| two hits, and thus opened the way for
lan El Toro victory by a score of 4
' to 1. The El Toro pitcher has a de-1
ceptive delivery which all but blanked
| the freshmen. Aside from this twirling,
the game was uninteresting.
