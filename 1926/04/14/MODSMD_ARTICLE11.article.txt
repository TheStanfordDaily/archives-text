# Motion Picture Impossible-Says Edward Langley
## 
### 
Tracing the history of the motion
picture which had its origin little more
than twenty-five years ago, Edward
Langley, who spoke in the Little Thea
tre last night, explained that the "mo
tion picture is an impossibility." It
neve rhas moved and never will, but
is in reality a still picture put on the
screen at sixteen pictures per second
which gives the idea of motion.
Langley is technical director of the
Fairbanks studio and a pioneer in the
motion picture industry.
In the early attempts in motion pic
tures a film was usually about thirty
feet in length compared with the
30,000-foot film of today. Before printed
titles accompanied the picture the ac
tion of the picture was the important
feature.
One of the first picture shows ever
put on was given in Chicago where
William Selig and Edward Langley
had their first studio about twenty-one
years ago.
Developing from a rather inadequate
type of motion picture show came the
production of such pictures as "The
Spoilers," which was put on about
fifteen years ago. The production cost
?14,000, a sum which is now paid to an
actor for a week's work or for a set
used in the picture.
The perfection of miniatures used
in the production of pictures is an im
portant development in the motion
picture industry. In illustrating the
use of miniatures, Langley related the
story of a protest which was made a
few years ago regarding a picture in
which a village of approximately three
thousand inhabitants was destroyed by
a flood.
In answer to the protest that it was
a waste of lumber to destroy this vil
lage, Langley explained that the lum
ber used in the houses of the village
was not enough to make a dog house.
The realistic effect of miniatures had
been well demonstrated.
The latest development in the mov
ing picture industry is the technicolor
process. The first complete picture
produced in color photography is "The
Black Pirate."
