# A. S. S. U. ENTERS NATIONAL STUDENT FEDERATION GROUP
## EX-COMMITTEE DECIDES Measure Approved by Lewis, Worswick; Follows Up Princeton Meeting 
### 
A motion to join the National Stu
dent Federation of America was car
ried last night at the wfeekly meeting
of the Executive Committee. This mo
tion included acceptance of the consti
tution outlined by the Federation's
Executive Committee, and is in pursu

Court Conference at Princeton on De
cember 11, 1925, at which the Federa

E. Lewis, A.S.S.U. president, and Mil

student problems in all the colleges of

An understood aspect of the Federa

colleges and universities in order to
promote a common bond of interest

and the world on certain problems

Federation was to promote the World
j Court, but a great deal of agitation has
| been started to take up the great cur

thought that a more lasting interest

America.
Section 2. The officers of the Fed
