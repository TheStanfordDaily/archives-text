A motion to join the National Stu
dent Federation of America was car

of the Executive Committee. This mo
tion included acceptance of the consti
tution outlined by the Federation's
Executive Committee, and is in pursu
ance of the recent ntercollegiate World
Court Conference at Princeton on De
cember 11, 1925, at which the Federa
tion was outlined, and to which Robert
E. Lewis, A.S.S.U. president, and Mil
dred Worswiek, A.W.S. president, gave
their personal approval.
At a recent meeting of the Execu
tive Committee on the Federation two
definite projects were outlined: (1)
The endorsement of European student
tours under the American auspices of
our Federation; (2) The initiation of

A motion to join the National Stu
dent Federation of America was car
ried last night at the wfeekly meeting
of the Executive Committee. This mo
tion included acceptance of the consti
tution outlined by the Federation's
Executive Committee, and is in pursu
ance of the recent ntercollegiate World
Court Conference at Princeton on De
cember 11, 1925, at which the Federa
tion was outlined, and to which Robert
E. Lewis, A.S.S.U. president, and Mil
dred Worswiek, A.W.S. president, gave
their personal approval.
At a recent meeting of the Execu
tive Committee on the Federation two
definite projects were outlined: (1)
The endorsement of European student
tours under the American auspices of
our Federation; (2) The initiation of
an educational survey covering the
undergraduate opinion regarding the
student problems in all the colleges of
the country.
An understood aspect of the Federa
tion is the co-operation with foreign
colleges and universities in order to
promote a common bond of interest
j across the sea.
Newspaper Proposed
An official organ, in the form of
| some kind of newspaper or magazine
| will be one of the first things the

various colleges of the United States
and the world on certain problems
can br; gotten before the rest of the
college world.
At the outset the intention of the
Federation was to promote the World
j Court, but a great deal of agitation has
| been started to take up the great cur

thought that a more lasting interest
j and more actual usefulness will be
I gained in this way.

Central, Southwestern, Mountain, and
Pacific, to be elected at this meeting '
after a report by the nominating com-;
inittee.
Section 3. The executive commit-1
tee shall designate an official deposi
tory of funds, and the accounts of the j
treasurer shall be audited by a certi-1
tied public accountant and reported at
proper intervals. The terms of all sub- j
scriptions to the funds of this Federa: |
tion shall then be made public.
Section 4. The general parliamen- |
tary practice shall conform to the j
rules set forth in Roberts' Rules of j
Order which shall govern the meetings |
