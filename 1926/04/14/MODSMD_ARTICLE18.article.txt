# SCRIMMAGE BEGINS WEEK'S WORKOUTS IN FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## Post, Graves, Young Loom As Punters; Linesmen Are Put in Backfield 
### 
Scrimmage opened the work at spring {
football practice this week. Several
teams were organized and went through j
plays, facing elevens who tackled low and .
hard on every occasion. Pop Warner
ran his charges over the field on trial i
plays of every description. Passes, line {
bucks, criss-crosses, and other plays were I
executed in rapid succession.
Other workouts consisted in the regular j
punting and signal practice. Several |
punters are shaping up to good form
under Warner's instruction. Graves, j
Wolf, Young, and Seraphim Post seem
to be the best bets at present, all of them j
are kicking creditable distances. Post, a j
southpaw punter, has a powerful leg-j
drive, and with parctice may shape up '
into real varsity timber.
Post's playing in the backfield war
rants hopes for future ability. He was
at guard last season, and is one of Pop
Warner's finds, discovered by the coach's
plan of trying linesmen in the backfield.
The fullback berth will be contested for
by Bogue, Young, Post, Patchett, and
others.
Another shift of linesmen made lately j
is the change of Captain Fred Swan from:
guard to quarterback. Swan shows re- ]
maskable football sagacity and looks good j
for the position left vacant by Solomon j
and Mitchell. .Eli Post, who is out with
an injury to his knee, is another prospect ■
who is shaping up with great form. |
Warner thinks these two men the best
bets at present.
The center of the line, in the past the!
stumbling stone of the varsity in early |
season games, seems to be well supplied j
with good men, with Vermillya, Mc-:
Creery, Nathcher, Graham, and Cook to;
choose from.
