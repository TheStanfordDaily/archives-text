### Joe Carroll 
Every able-bodied Cardinal rooter is
expected to journey to the pavilion
tonight to join in the annual Spring
Sports rally and yell himself hoarse
over the prospect of victories over
the Golden Bear in track and baseball
Saturday. At 8 o'clock an automobile
parade will start down the Row, and
at 8:15 the rally proper will get under
way.
A rooter's hat will be worn by the
well-dressed man, according to the
Rally Committee, and all noise-produc
ing instruments except revolvers will
be in style. The starting time has
been set late in order not to interfere
with men's rushing. The track and
baseball squads will be present in a
body as guests of honor.
The committee in charge of all ar
rangements, composed of Raitt Boren,
Ted Criley, and Harry Bennett, assist
ed by Bob Fraser, Jimmie Farr, and
Cal Conron, announced last night that
an evening of entertainment has been
provided that will be sure to satisfy
the most spring-feverish men on the
campus. Track stars will address the
assembled multitude, baseball men will
mumble speeches instead of fumbling
balls, and there will be special skits,
and music.

Every able-bodied Cardinal rooter is
expected to journey to the pavilion
tonight to join in the annual Spring
Sports rally and yell himself hoarse
over the prospect of victories over
the Golden Bear in track and baseball
Saturday. At 8 o'clock an automobile
parade will start down the Row, and
at 8:15 the rally proper will get under
way.
A rooter's hat will be worn by the
well-dressed man, according to the
Rally Committee, and all noise-produc
ing instruments except revolvers will
be in style. The starting time has
been set late in order not to interfere
with men's rushing. The track and
baseball squads will be present in a
body as guests of honor.
The committee in charge of all ar
rangements, composed of Raitt Boren,
Ted Criley, and Harry Bennett, assist
ed by Bob Fraser, Jimmie Farr, and
Cal Conron, announced last night that
an evening of entertainment has been
provided that will be sure to satisfy
the most spring-feverish men on the
campus. Track stars will address the
assembled multitude, baseball men will
mumble speeches instead of fumbling
balls, and there will be special skits,
and music.
