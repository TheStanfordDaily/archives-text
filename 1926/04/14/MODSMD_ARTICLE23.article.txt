The opposition is in evidence, and has formally presented to the Execu
tive Committee a petition to have the recent action of this body which
altered the method of electing athletic team captains removed from the
A.S.S.U. by-laws. A special election will be held Tuesday.
The interest shown in the matter is gratifying. If Tuesday's poll is
comprehensive, we will be perfectly satisfied.
Before rendering a final decision on the by-law which it passed last
week the Executive Committee made the request that students be on hand
to give their opinions. The fact that only one or two turned out was con
strued by the governing body to mean that the scheme had only slight op
position. Hut this does not seem to be the case. The petition submitted
last night was signed by some sixty individuals.
The poll at campus elections is extremely small. Rarely does more than
one-third of the registered members of the student body take the trouble
of voting. So when a petition gathers sixty signatures in a short time, it
is safe to say that the opposition is formidable.
But the plan has equally as many proponents. Now for the show
down; and a goodly evidence of hands.
