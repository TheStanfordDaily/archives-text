# Rally, Rally, Rally!

### 
There is to he found nowhere in the dictionary a satisfactory and ade
quate definition of the word rally. The noun rally, we find, is defined as
a political or mass meeting. The verb form of the word means to arouse
to action; to concentrate the energy of. Neither definition tells the whole
story. c
In a sense college athletic rallies are political, for they are designed to
unite the team and the student body for conquest of a common enemy.
And anyone who has been caught in the jam at the pavilion door will agree
that they are mass gatherings. Some rallies arouse to action and concen
trate energy ; others fall fiat.
Tonight every Stanford student will have the opportunity of attending
the annual spring meeting of the Cardinal forces; and when the gathering
disbands wc hope to have a brand new and entirely inclusive definition of
the word rally to submit to industrious compilers of abridged and un
abridged dictionaries.
The Rally Committee has arranged an attractive program; but there is
more than this to influence attendance. The freshman track team has just
added one niche to the handle of the axe; and at present it appears that
the varsity will also do a little whittling after Saturday's meet.
While the freshman runners were putting the Cubs to route, Harry
Wolter and his baseball team were upsetting the dope and were defeating
the California nine. By doing so they evened the annual series; and pro
vided another important contest for Saturday. 1 f both the track team and
the baseball squad win, Stanford will have had its most successful athletic
season in yearsâ€”four major sport victories and only one defeat.
It will be an important send-off!
