# SPORTS OF 1926
## Yale's Track Coaches 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Big Chief" George Connors, head track coach at Yale University, and
"Little Chief" Earl Thomson afford a fine study in contrasts, for here you find
age and youth, as well as a giant and a mite, working together with fine
results. "Big Chief" Connors is the little one, and he must be all of 60 years
of age, while his trusty right-hand man, "Little Chief" Thomson, is the big
one, and he is half as old, as well as twice as big, as his boss.
George Connors came to America from London in 1888 to run against
Littlewood and Alberts in six-day go-as-you-please races in New York. George
is full of interesting stories about the iron men of the '80's, for he competed
with them, and had the distinction of covering 568 miles himself in a six-day
race. William Gale, according to George, was the greatest of the time, for he
accomplished the seemingly impossible feat of walking 4,000 quarter-miles in
4,000 consecutive ten minutes.
Connors' career as a track and field manager began in 1893, when he
coached the Chicago Athletic Association team at the time of the World's
Fair. He was at Cornell four years, at Carlisle one year, and then started a
long and illustrious reign at Exeter Academy, where he was in charge for over
two decades. In that time he produced many famous champions, among them
John Paul Jones and Bill Bingham. Going to Yale in 1924, his team aston
ished the critics by winning the "Intercollegiates" and breaking the winning
streak of the University of California. Last year Yale finished in third place.
Earl Thomson, Olympic high hurdle champion in 1920, and holder of the
world's record of 14 2-5 seconds, is ably assisting Connors, developing the
timber-toppers, broad-jumpers, and weight-throwers. After graduating from
Dartmouth in 1921, Earl coached with success at his Alma Mater and then at
West Virginia. "Tommy," born in Canada, first learned to hurdle at Long
Beach high school in California, and later had a year's training and competi
tion with the famous Fred Kelly at the University of Southern California.
Besides being one of the fastest of the big athletes (he weigher 195 or 200
in his record-breaking days), he is also one of the best-looking champions in
any sport.
Also assisting George Connors at Yale, and giving special attention to the
high-jumpers, pole-vaulters, and discus-throwers is A1 McGall. What George
and Earl and A1 don't know about coachnig track and field sports isn't worth
knowing.
