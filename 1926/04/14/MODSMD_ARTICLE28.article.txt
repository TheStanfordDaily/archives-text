The Euphronia debaters recently wrangled on the question: "Resolved,
That college education is a curse." Although the debate was decided in the
negative, Cabbages agrees with the speaker who said that college education
is not only a curse but a series of curses. To substantiate this we submit
the following DAILY CURSE SCHEDULE for the approval or disapproval of
our readers:
Arise at 7:55. Accuse your alarm clock of unworthy intentions.
Get dressed and find that one of your shoes is missing. Cast aspersions
on your roommate's parentage.
Stub your toe on a chair leg and indulge in a detailed description of the
chair, using strong adjectives, at the same time slightly exaggerating.
Go to class and listen to a lecture on the yellow curse, the red curse, the
blue curse, and several other curses, to say nothing of the heathen curse.
Receive a corrected examination paper in history and go into a detailed
and highly exclamatory discussion of the methods used by correctors in
marking examination papers. Accuse all the kings of England of existing
under false pretenses.
Have an examination sprung on you. Hand in your paper at the end of
ten minutes calling economics by every name except the science of finance.
On the way to lunch get caught in an April shower. Accuse the U. S.
Weather Bureau of malevolent intent.
Find that there is nothing for lunch but corned beef and cabbage. Wish
the cook the opposite of a Merry Christmas.
Spend a fine spring afternoon in the chemistry laboratory mentally con
cocting a potion to send your professors to a violent end.
In the evening spend three hours trying to dress for a formal dance.,
Call the wrath of Heaven down on each and every member of the Arrow
Collar family and the perpetrator of Hastings' dress chart.
Spend another hour starting your Ford. Wish sincerely that the Ford
were in a warm climate.
After four dances and three glasses of punch with accessories you ought
| to be able to express your opinion of the music and things in general.
Get to bed at 3 o'clock wondering why janitors and housekeepers waste
their time by existing.

SMILES
A smile is such a little thing—it blossoms on the face,
In funny times at funny things, and then 'most any place.
The prof who springs an ex on you when you are not prepared
Includes with it a kind of smile, quite chilling—when you're scared!
The lady who hands out the hash—tjie one that's in the Caf,
Will smile as she gives you your grub—full charge for only half!
The L. D. office has a smile —a little filled with salt —
When telling you you haven't made requirements —not their fault!
The lady in the library who sits across the table —
Her smile don't mean a blasted thing—a "do not handle" label.
I The sweet young thing who gets her dope from looking 'cross your shoulder,
j Will smile a bit. but not so much when you try getting bolder.
' The dearie you can gather up while riding in your car —
I She smiles and smiles —hut they are not the smiles that travel far.
The smile you smile when you receive an A is just a grin.
| And added is a pleasant glow of warmth beneath the skin.
| That sickly smile you plaster on your features when you talk,
In trying out for drama work, tastes just like chewing chalk.
But smiles like this and smiles like that don't equal one I know;
The little glimpse of heaven's light that in that smile can glow!
,So take your smiles of profs and maids, of waiters and of A's,
I I'd rather dream about Her smile and sit here in a —L.A.B.

| That sickly smile you plaster on your features when you talk,
In trying out for drama work, tastes just like chewing chalk.
But smiles like this and smiles like that don't equal one I know;
The little glimpse of heaven's light that in that smile can glow!

The Euphronia debaters recently wrangled on the question: "Resolved,
That college education is a curse." Although the debate was decided in the
negative, Cabbages agrees with the speaker who said that college education
is not only a curse but a series of curses. To substantiate this we submit
the following DAILY CURSE SCHEDULE for the approval or disapproval of
our readers:
Arise at 7:55. Accuse your alarm clock of unworthy intentions.
Get dressed and find that one of your shoes is missing. Cast aspersions
on your roommate's parentage.
Stub your toe on a chair leg and indulge in a detailed description of the
chair, using strong adjectives, at the same time slightly exaggerating.
Go to class and listen to a lecture on the yellow curse, the red curse, the
blue curse, and several other curses, to say nothing of the heathen curse.
Receive a corrected examination paper in history and go into a detailed
and highly exclamatory discussion of the methods used by correctors in
marking examination papers. Accuse all the kings of England of existing
under false pretenses.
Have an examination sprung on you. Hand in your paper at the end of
ten minutes calling economics by every name except the science of finance.
On the way to lunch get caught in an April shower. Accuse the U. S.
Weather Bureau of malevolent intent.
Find that there is nothing for lunch but corned beef and cabbage. Wish
the cook the opposite of a Merry Christmas.
Spend a fine spring afternoon in the chemistry laboratory mentally con
cocting a potion to send your professors to a violent end.
In the evening spend three hours trying to dress for a formal dance.,
Call the wrath of Heaven down on each and every member of the Arrow
Collar family and the perpetrator of Hastings' dress chart.
Spend another hour starting your Ford. Wish sincerely that the Ford
were in a warm climate.
After four dances and three glasses of punch with accessories you ought
| to be able to express your opinion of the music and things in general.
Get to bed at 3 o'clock wondering why janitors and housekeepers waste
their time by existing.

SMILES
A smile is such a little thing—it blossoms on the face,
In funny times at funny things, and then 'most any place.
The prof who springs an ex on you when you are not prepared
Includes with it a kind of smile, quite chilling—when you're scared!
The lady who hands out the hash—tjie one that's in the Caf,
Will smile as she gives you your grub—full charge for only half!
The L. D. office has a smile —a little filled with salt —
When telling you you haven't made requirements —not their fault!
The lady in the library who sits across the table —
Her smile don't mean a blasted thing—a "do not handle" label.
I The sweet young thing who gets her dope from looking 'cross your shoulder,
j Will smile a bit. but not so much when you try getting bolder.
' The dearie you can gather up while riding in your car —
I She smiles and smiles —hut they are not the smiles that travel far.
The smile you smile when you receive an A is just a grin.
| And added is a pleasant glow of warmth beneath the skin.
| That sickly smile you plaster on your features when you talk,
In trying out for drama work, tastes just like chewing chalk.
But smiles like this and smiles like that don't equal one I know;
The little glimpse of heaven's light that in that smile can glow!
