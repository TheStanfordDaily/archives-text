# METROPOLITAN OPERA SINGERS WILL HOLD CAMPUS RECITAL
## 
### 
Edward Johnson and Joan Ruth, both
of the Metropolitan Opera Company of
New York, will'offer their unique joint
recital consisting of picked scenes from
the most popular operas done in costume
and with, s,cenic t efleets; at K:l5 o'clock
tomorrow night in the Assembly Hall.
The two noted singers are appearing
in the last concert ...of the annual series
offered by the Peninsula Music Associa
tion which has sponsored the appearance
of such artists as Robert Schmitz and
Cecilia Hansen earlier in the season.
A special student rate has been made
by the' Peninsula Association so that the
regular $1.65 seats downstairs may be
obtained for $1. There "will also be a
number of rough scats for 50 cents.
Tickets are on sale at the Stanford book
store and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
Excerpts will be given from three of
the most popular on the repertoires of the
Metropolitan and other great opera com
panies. They are "La Bohenie" by
Puccini, "Romeo and Juliet" by Gounod,
and "Rigoletto" by Verdi. The selections
chosen are those most melodious and ap
pealing so that the recital contairis in a
condensed form the best of the operas.
Four selections from each opera will
be sung. The beautiful aria of Rudolfo
in "La Boheme" "Che gelida manina"
and the duet "() Soave fanciulla" with
Johnson as Rudolfo and Miss Ruth as I
Mimi will also be heard. The universally
popular waltz song from "Romeo and
Juliet" will be sung by Miss Ruth whose
clear, lyric soprano is said to be especially
suited to bring out the utmost beauty of
this aria.
According to the critic of the Wash
ington Times, Joan Ruth, in the balcony
scene of Shakespeare's romance-tragedy
was a lovely picture. But a greater charm
was the soft cadence of her voice, its
ebb and How, its color and withal the
poise of her well modulated phrases in
tone and diction. The duet "O night
divine" closes the Romeo and Juliet scene.
In Verdi's famous tragedy, "Rigoletto,"
Johnson will sing the role of the Duke
of Mantua with the famous'and difficult
aria "Woman is fickle." Miss Ruth as
the unfortunate Gilda has the equally
noted "Dear Name."
Both Edward Johnson and Joan Ruth
will have ample opportunity to display
all their vocal abilities for their songs
will be among the most difficult tech
nically as well as the most appealing in
the entire field of opera. All the scenes
| are full of dramatic interest and call lor
considerable ability in acting and pan
tomime.
Miss Ruth is one of the youngest
prima donnas in grand opera. She is also
one of the most beautiful and delicate.
She is able to actually be the delicate
Juliet and Mimi and Gilda in appearance.
: Her debut was made with the Wagnerian
j Opera Company three years ago. She
j was soon engaged by the Metropolitan.
Johnson was born in Canada of Scot
tish ancestry. He narrowly escaped a
legal career. His vocal ability was recog

nized in the United States, and he went
on several concert tours through the I
country, lie suddenly disappeared, how-1
ever, from the musical world. He had
gone to Italy for a period of study under]
Lombard the-coach of Caruso. , In Italy j
Mr. Johnson made his operatic debut un
der the name of Eduardo Giovanni, an I
Italianized version of his English title, j
Eor seven years he triumphed in Italian |
opera roles. In 1920 he returned to i
America and made his second bow to the
public under his former name.
