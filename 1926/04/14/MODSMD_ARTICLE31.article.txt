### Astrid Arnoldson 
Life and, literary achievement of a
hundred years ago form the basis for
the display of books now being shown
in the cases at the head of the library
stairs. The works of Sir Walter Scott
predominate among the novels of 1826,
although books by Lytton-Bulwer, Dis
raeli, James Fenitnore Cooper, and
Mary Russell Mitford form part of the
collection.
Among the works of Scott shown in
this display are "The Lady of the
Lake" and "The Lay of the Last Min
strel" in a pocket edition published in
LSI 2. "Woodstock," which appeared in
1826, "Tales of Wonder," printed in
1824, and the author's Journal are
shown. This last is open at the page
on which he made an entry on Febru-!
ary 12, 1826, to the effect that he had
just completed the second volume of;
"Woodstock." There are also several
works on Scott and books on English !
literature in which he figures promi
nently. One of these is a German work, j
Cooper Knew Scott j
Scott and Goethe knew each other's 1
work, and each said he greatly ad- j
mired the other. Goethe, who was 77 1
years old when "Woodstock" was pub
lished, was working on "Faust" at the '
time.
Cooper also knew Scott. When he
was in London he met the poet and (
was feted with him by the society of I
the English capital. Only "The Last '
of the Mohicans" from among the
American's work appears in this col- j
lection. There are, however, several j
books about him, and a copy of the j
account from which lie derived some,
of his knowledge of the Indians. This i
is a book entitled "A Narrative of the J
Mission of the United Brethren among J
the Delaware and Mohegan Indians,"
by John Heckewelder, which was pub- !
lished in IS2O.

king of England, are shown. There is j
also one account of Charles X of j

of the boom in canal-building and of j
the building of the first railroad.
"The New York Mirror and Ladies' |
Literary Gazette" was popular in 1826, \
and a copy of it containing comments j
on Scott, Cooper, and others is in the

raeli, James Fenitnore Cooper, and

Lake" and "The Lay of the Last Min
strel" in a pocket edition published in
LSI 2. "Woodstock," which appeared in
1826, "Tales of Wonder," printed in

Cooper Knew Scott j
Scott and Goethe knew each other's 1
work, and each said he greatly ad- j
mired the other. Goethe, who was 77 1
years old when "Woodstock" was pub
lished, was working on "Faust" at the '
time.
Cooper also knew Scott. When he
was in London he met the poet and (
was feted with him by the society of I
the English capital. Only "The Last '
of the Mohicans" from among the
American's work appears in this col- j
lection. There are, however, several j
books about him, and a copy of the j
account from which lie derived some,
of his knowledge of the Indians. This i
is a book entitled "A Narrative of the J
Mission of the United Brethren among J
the Delaware and Mohegan Indians,"
by John Heckewelder, which was pub- !
lished in IS2O.
