# HARVARD CAMPAIGNS FOR ENDOWMENT OF LAW RESEARCH CHAIRS
## 
### 
Harvard University has opened a
campaign for $5,000,000 for the de
velopment of the Law School to in
clude the establishment of five re
search professorships for the conduc
tion of a thorough inquiry into the
whole field of American law. This is
in response to the feeling of dissatis
faction with the existing lawlessness
throughout the nation.
An endowment of $1,000,000 is asked
for the founding of these chairs. The
remaining $4,000,000 will be divided
between the improvement of existing
buildings and bibliography and the
further endowment of existing profes
sorships and new fellowships.
The budget calls for the construc
tion of an administration building, and
a building to contain an auditorium
and rooms for moot arguments. Pre
senting the record of its past, the Law
School goes before the country with
the proposal that the work of the past
shall be continued and made even
more valuable in the future.
