# STANFORD RECEIVES LARGE COLLECTION OF MOUNTED BIRDS
## Littlejohn Specimens Given To University Natural History Museum 
### 
1 The Littlejohn bird collection, which
consists of 1825 birds and is the most
complete collection of San Mateo coun
ty birds in existence, has been pre
sented to the Stanford University mu
seum by Chase Littlejohn. r
Littlejohn was born in Redwood I
City and started his bird collection
there in 1867. He was a hunter and *
trapper, having hunted the sea otter
for ten or twelve years. He is one of
the few living men who have hunted
for these animals.
For six years Littlejohn lived in
Alaska, where he procured two excel
lent specimens of the Alaskan bajd
eagle. In 1907 he was a member of the
Alexander expedition* sent out by the
; University of California to collect j
birds. He has also collected birds .in |
i Mexico and possesses some rare speci
ments from the Sierra Nevada moun
tains.
Out of the 310 known species of
j birds in San Mateo county, Littlejohn
! has 284 specimens in his collection,
i Among his rarer specimens are a
'series of thirty-eight specimens of the
| sharp shinned hawk, a series of fifteen }
' specimens of the duck hawk, a series I
|of eight specimens of the white-tailed
kite, and individual specimens of feru
jginous ruff leg, the golden eagle, and
the northern pigeon hawk.
In San Mateo county there are
itwenty-two species of birds that have;
practically diseappeared. Of this num

lAis collection. Among these there are
, the pectoral sand piper, the avocet, I
j the white-fronted goose, the wood I
! duck, the yellow-billed magpie, the'
evening grosbeak, the lazuli bunting,
Jand others.
The bird collection is in the Natural \
! History museum which is in the west
end of the Stanford museum. Little-j
jjohn is now cataloguing it and arrang
jing it with the Stanford bird collection.
Through the efforts of Dudley De-
Groot, '23, Professor John O. Snyder
!of the Zoology department and head
of the Natural History museum, Dean
George 13. Culver, and W. O. Horabin
of Palo Alto, Stanford has been able
Ito acquire this collection. Littlejohn
j wished to have a permanent place to
keep his birds.
Enough money was raised by these
men to purchase the collection. Those
I contributing from Palo Alto were W.
jo. Horabin, E. C. Thoits, W. B. Allen,
|N. B. Smith, P. M. Lansdale, Fred
