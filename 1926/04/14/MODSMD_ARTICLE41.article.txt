# JUNIORS VANQUISHED BY 1926 INTERCLASS SOCCER AGGREGATION
## 
### 
In a hard-fouglit game yesterday, the
senior soccer team vanquished the jun
iors 5 to 1 and showed enough team
work to practically concede them the
interclass championship.

The third-year men started out with
■a ruah and had the seniors playing
within the shadow of their goal for
the first five minutes. Lefty Coleman,
inside left, scored the first goal of the
game for the 1927 men when he kicked
the ball into one corner of the net.

Although the juniors showed spurts
of power, the able blocking and return
ing of Jack Franklin and Randy Karr
kept the senior goalkeeper from work
ing overtime. At the end of the first
half the seniors had a 3 to 1 lead.

Quigley, senior inside left, and Espy,
inside right, each scored two goals for
ifoe seniors, while Miron added one in
the second period. Bailard, Paige, and
Jiipfeldt were the outstanding players
on the junior squad, while Miron,
Franklin, and Forrest starred for the
fourth-year team.
