# STATISTICS CONCEDE STANFORD VICTORY OVER BRUIN SQUAD
## Great Struggle Looms When Cards Clash With Bears Next Saturday 
### Clif Moore 
The Stanford stadium will be the
scene of one of the greatest struggles
in Stanford-California track history
when Coach Dink Templeton's Cardi
nal athletes meet Walter Christie's
Bears on the track and field next Sat
urday afternoon. Statistics give Stan
ford a little the better chance for vic
tory; but no dopester, no matter how
optimistic, can give the Cardinals the
meet by a decisive margin.

Every event on the program holds
promise of being a thriller. The Big
Meet is a great come-through oppor
tunity for track and field athletes, and
totally unlooked-for results may occur
due to unexpected performances of
men considered hitherto as mediocre
material.
A number of stars on both teams are
figured to take first places without
question. Captain Jim Barber of Cali
fornia is one of theme. He has taken
ten points in the sprints in every meet
he has entered this season, and his
consistently fast times make him a
decided favorite.
Barber Is Favorite
Barber's time of 9.9 in the century
has been equalled but once this season
by a collegiate track star, Ed House
of U.S.C. The Bruin leader is also
credited with several 22.1 races in the
220-yard event, which is fast enough
to defeat any of Templeton's sprinters.

| Dick Hyland is counted upon to give
Barber the most opposition in the cen
tury. Hyland rose to fame by his un
expected showing in the U.S.C. meet
when he nearly beat out the Trojan
ace, House. Hyland may pull one of
the surprises of the meet and if he
lives up to the notices concerning his
competitive ability, he will at least
force the Bear sprinter to his utmost.
Coverly in Furlong
Since Coverly's disappointing failure
to figure in recent Stanford meets, he
is not considered as being likely to
place in the 100. He has shown more
class in the furlong, however, and is
the only Cardinal runner liable to
make Barber extend himself. Louis
Gaspar will probably stage a great
battle with Roehrig of California in
both events.
Work is undoubtedly the greatest
high jumper on the Pacific Coast and
in Stanford meets for the past three
years has been a steady winner. Dur
ing the end of the current season, how
ever, he has suffered a bad slump, and
his showing against Oregon last Sat
urday is conclusive evidence that he'
has not yet regained his usual ability.
Work has defeated Hampton, the
Bears' best high jumper, every time
they have met, but each time has been
forced to an impressive height.
Bob King, winner of the U.S.C. meet
with a leap of 6 feet 4 inches, is un
questionably one of the finest jumpers
Templeton has ever coached. King is
sure to place in the Big Meet, and will
be right in the running with Work and
Hampton for first place honors. The
high jump looms as one o fthe most
bitterly contested events on the card,
and the winning leap will come 1 very
close to the coast record.
Broacf Jump Uncertain
The broad jump- haw always offered
a great dealf of stiff comp«fition, and
this year the event will be closer than
ever. Bondsftu of California; is rated
as one of the best on the- and
his distances all season have placed
him in the first-place column consist
ently. Opposed to Mm wiTT be Meeks
and Macßae, Stanford's best jumpers.
It is not definitely known at the
present time whether Meefcs will be
able to compete in the Big Meet- He
was forced out of the Oregon meet
last wek because of illness, and his
condition so far this week has not
allowed htm to show up for practice.
His absence from the pits on Saturday
will greatly lessen Stanford's chances
for a first place in this event as he is
a great competitive athlete.
With the Riehardson-Boyden race
j on tap in the half-mile, and a great
| struggle expected in the weight events
| and hurdle races, the crowd at Satur
j day's meet can look forward to an ex
citing afternoon.
