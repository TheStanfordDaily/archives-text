"Social activities seem to be a char
acteristic of the American and Eng
lish universities, but find no place in
connection with the Russian universi
ties," stated Professor Lanz of the
Slavic Languages department in an
interview yesterday. Professor Lanz
has recently returned from a two
months' visit to Russia, and he bases
this statement on his observations
made in the universities there.

Professor Lanz spent most of his
time while in Russia at the University
of Moscow in Moscow. He states that
there are many institutes of research
which are separate from the universi
ties. Here extensive research in the
fields of sciences, literature, and art
are carried on. Instructors for the uni
versities are also trained at the insti
tutes.
University Life Normal
"In spite of the recent revolution in
Russia university life continues quite
normally," Professor Lang stated.
"However the social status has
changed. The class of students now
attending the universities is quite dif
ferent from the class that attended
during the old regime. Preference is
given to the lower working classes and
the peasants."

There does not seem to be either an
increase or decrease in the number of
students now attending the univerai-'
ties, when figures are compared with
those of a few years ago. However,
both the entrance and the graduating
requirements have been lowered. In
fact the scholastic standards are great
ly below what they were in pre-revo
lutionary days.
In conjunction with the universities
there are workers' departments. These
departments are maintained for the
people of the working and peasant
class. With three or four years of
study under these departments, the
students are then ready to enter the
universities. Preference is usually
given to these students over others
entering the universities. '
Dancing Forbidden
Dancing is excluded in Russian uni
versities. "In fact," Mr. Lanz said, "it
is absolutely forbidden for any student
of the University of Moscow to dance
in public."
Students in Russian universities are
expected to take part in the university
administration. Most of their other out
side activities are devoted to social
organization and work as well aÂ» ath
letics. Interest in physical education
and athletics is growing continually.
