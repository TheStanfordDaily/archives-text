# CARDINALS STAGE COMEBACK; BEAT CALIFORNIA 3 TO 2
## TIE IN EIGHTH INNING Stanford Players Show Much Improvement Over First Game of Series 
### 
A thrilling comeback was staged by
the varsity nine when it defeated Cali
fornia 3 to 2 in the second game of
the series held at West field, Berkeley,
yesterday afternoon. The games are
now tied with the final and deciding
contest coming next Saturday on the
Stanford diamond following the Big
Meet.
The superiority of the Cards was
more evident in the game than the
score shows. They hit their stride in
slugging and outbatted the Bears.
Thirteen hits were made by the var
sity batters and that only three runs
were made Is due mostly to the lack
of hits during the four times that the
bases were full. The team looked like
a different outfit from the ones which
dropped an unimpressive game to the
Bears by a score of 3 to 1 a little over
a week ago. Harry Wolter put real
fighting spirit in his men yesterday
and they outclassed the California
players completely.
Steve Collins, Card twirler, pitched
a good game of ball throughout the
nine innings. He allowed only four
hits. Park, who pitched last week,
started for the Bears. He was in good
form till the eighth inning when he
was struck out of the box and replaced
by Nomecheck who was also unable
to keep the Cards from victory.
The game was full of thrills, the
score being tied in the eighth inning
and the deciding point coining in the
ninth. By a curious coincidence the
history of last year's series has been
repeated. The first game was lost to
California, then the second was tied
by Stanford in the eighth and won in
the ninth.
With the score tied in the ninth,
Stanford had Maguire on first and
.Clark on third. With the first sack
occupied, the pitcher could not take
his usual windup and had to let the
ball go in a greater hurry. The Cards
made use of this by leaving first occu
pied. Nomecheck let fly a hasty one
which Sypher hit for a long sacrifice
fly, bringing Clark across the plate for
the winning point.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford-
Hits 11 1 3 0 0 1 2 2—ll
Huns 0 0 0 1 0 0 01 1— 3

A thrilling comeback was staged by
the varsity nine when it defeated Cali
fornia 3 to 2 in the second game of
the series held at West field, Berkeley,
yesterday afternoon. The games are
now tied with the final and deciding
contest coming next Saturday on the
Stanford diamond following the Big
Meet.
The superiority of the Cards was
more evident in the game than the
score shows. They hit their stride in
slugging and outbatted the Bears.
Thirteen hits were made by the var
sity batters and that only three runs
were made Is due mostly to the lack
of hits during the four times that the
bases were full. The team looked like
a different outfit from the ones which
dropped an unimpressive game to the
Bears by a score of 3 to 1 a little over
a week ago. Harry Wolter put real
fighting spirit in his men yesterday
and they outclassed the California
players completely.
Steve Collins, Card twirler, pitched
a good game of ball throughout the
nine innings. He allowed only four
hits. Park, who pitched last week,
started for the Bears. He was in good
form till the eighth inning when he
was struck out of the box and replaced
by Nomecheck who was also unable
to keep the Cards from victory.
The game was full of thrills, the
score being tied in the eighth inning
and the deciding point coining in the
ninth. By a curious coincidence the
history of last year's series has been
repeated. The first game was lost to
California, then the second was tied
by Stanford in the eighth and won in
the ninth.
With the score tied in the ninth,
Stanford had Maguire on first and
.Clark on third. With the first sack
occupied, the pitcher could not take
his usual windup and had to let the
ball go in a greater hurry. The Cards
made use of this by leaving first occu
pied. Nomecheck let fly a hasty one
which Sypher hit for a long sacrifice
fly, bringing Clark across the plate for
the winning point.
