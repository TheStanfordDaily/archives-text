# DELTS DEFEAT FIJI NINE IN FAST CONTEST
## El Capitan Nine Too Good For Short-Handed Chi Psi Squad; Score 19-1 A.T.O. LOSES TO BETAS Phi Gamma Delta Errors in Fifth Give Game to Opponents 
### Jack Springer 
One really stiff tangle, two out-and
out walkaways, and one default make
up the final results of intramural base
ball yesterday afternoon. A lucky fifth
gave the Delta Taus a winning lead
over the Fijis, which led to a 7-5 vic
tory despite desperate efforts on the
part of the latter to score in the re
maining two innings. Beta ran rough
shod over the A.T.O. lineup to the
tune of 14-3. The Alpha Delta Phi-
Encina I tilt was a complete fiasco
as neither team showed up.
The Phi Gamma Delta diamond art
ists, playing fairly consistent ball,
were able to hold the lead over the
Delts until the fourth inning, when
Wise, Tognazzini, and Meyer were
able to sneak in for three runs to tie
the score. The Fijis came back in the
next inning and, led by Chase and
Elliott, again took the lead. The ad
vantage was immediately blown to
bits when the Delta Tau four horse
men, Wise, Tognazzini, Meyer, and
Downey, galloped around the bases
amid an apparently endless stream of
(heir opponents' errors. Meyer and
,l;imes constituted the battery for the
winning Delta Taus, and Elliott and
Broenkow for the Phi Gamma Deltas.
The excellent mound work of Kis
singer completely kept Alpha Tau
Omega out of the scoring end of its
clash with the Betas. Thomas, Watt,
Kissinger, Montgomery, and Herring
ton were particularly responsible for
the high Beta total, while Deal and
Newcomb accounted for the lone three
points of the A.T.O.'a.
El Capitan, winner of its league in
last year's play, started out to repeat
Ihe performance by engulfing the Chi
Psi team under a 19-1 score. The
strong batting work ot' Foster, Marsh,
Noble, Silvius, and Read was mainly
responsible for the heavy lead over
the Chi Psis, and the pitching and
latching of Canfield and Noble held
down the opposition to almost a no-hit
game. Pierce brought in the lone run
for the Chi Psis. Chi Psi was short one
man throughout the entire game.
All of the diamonds except the Se
quoia have been treated to a mowing
and are in much better shape than
they were at the first of the week.
I'nless it can be arranged to condition
â– the Sequoia grounds, the games sched
uled for there will probably be shifted
to the other field.
