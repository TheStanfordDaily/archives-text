### Joe Carroll 
"Wash your face and put on a clean
shirt next Saturday noon, come down
to the stadium, and yell from the
rooters' section while the Stanford
track team runs away from the Cali
fornia squad to make three victories
in a row for Dink Templeton and the
Red-shirted athletes," said Cal Conron,
chairman of the rally committee at
the Spring Sports rally last night.
"Then climb the fence to see the
Cardinal hitters batter down the
Berkeley baseball team in the decisive
game of the series."
Morris Kirksey, the fastest man that
ever ran for Stanford, was the main
speaker at the pavilion. He said that
the only thing needed by the men on
the team now was the right mental
attitude, and added that everyone
should co-operate to give them the
real Stanford spirit. Captain Bill Rich
ardson voiced his opinion that the
team would win the Big Meet.
Templeton Praises Babes
Coach Dink Templeton stated that
the present team is the best-balanced
squad that he has ever doached, and

Stanford freshmen, who ran up a large
majority of points to defeat the Bruin

of more years of coaching from Tem
pleton.

Fraser and Jimmie Farr started the
evening's entertainment by leading
several yells. Bill Hunkins and Shel
don Fay next entered the scene with
a rendition of Pee-oria.
Delmer Daves' secret practice was
amply explained by his appearance
before the audience as a pre-war pre
proliibition professor who has turned
bootlegger under the stress of the
times. He recalled old stories and
scenes, as he explained that the first
instructors had been called "tramp pro
fessors" because they had to tramp

to be Duke Morrison, Alonzo B. Cass,
and Sid Lewis,
