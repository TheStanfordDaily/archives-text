# SOPHOMORES ASSUME DECISIVE LEAD OVER 1929 TENNIS SQUAD
## Paul Mockett Surprises by Beating Gomer Thomas In First Singles 
### Ralph McElvenny 
With three victories and two de feats
to its credit, the sophomore interclass
tennis team yesterday assumed a de
cisive lead over the freshman repre
senatives in the opening round of the
University class championship tourna
ment. The two remaining doubles
matches will be completed today.
Paul Mockett, first ranking player
of the '29 team, furnished the upset of
the day by defeating Gomer Thomas,
sophomore star and sixth ranking var
sity man, in three tortuous sets, 1-6,
8-6, 9-7.
Thomas romped through the first set
in quick order, but then changed his
game to a soft, poking style of play
that eventually effected his defeat.
Mockett managed to float the easy
shots back in a discouragingly regular
manner, and soon had Thomas closely
pressed. The final set was a marathon,
with continued lobbing.
Frank Dunn, second sophomore
singles man, won handily in sequence
sets from Kenneth Howard, freshman,
6-2, 6-1. Dunn was in excellent form
and at all times commanded the play.
Howard relied upon an accurate fore
hand drive, with which he frequently
scored, but Dunn's superior speed
terminated most of the exchanges.
The yearlings captured their second
singles match when John Williams
conquered James Mansfield in straight
sets, 8-6, 6-2. Mansfield's tricky left
hand service, followed by a determined
net attack, puzzled Williams, who Jiad
difficulty putting the ball into play.
As Mansfield gradually tired under
his strenuous efforts, he grew un
steady, and Williams gained the last
set more easily.
In the doubles, the class of '28
proved especially effective. Harold
Way, paired with Mansfield, quickly
dispatched John Keith and Stuart
Rawlings, 6-0, 6-1. With the team score
now tied, Kenneth Dow and Stanley
Cook gave the older class the advan
tage by beating Paul Murphy and
James Aiker, 7-5, 6-3. The two remain
ing doubles matches will be played
today: Thomas and Dunn vs. Howard
and Williams; Lawrence Weymouth
and Jack Beard vs. Mockett and
Charles West.
