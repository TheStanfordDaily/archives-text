# CARDINALS READY FOR CLASH WITH CALIFORNIA SATURDAY
## Hopes in Two-Mile Boosted When Ted Criley Is Timed at 10:2 BEST TIME THIS SEASON Ted Miller, Star 440 Man, Scheduled to Enter in Half-Mile Race 
### Clif Moore 
Ted Miller, Pacific Coast intercolle
giate quarter-mile champion, is sched
uled to enter the 880-yard run in addi
tion to his favorite event, the 440, in
next Saturday's 32nd annual Big Meet.
Miller, together with Captain Bill
Richardson, will be pitted against El
mer Boyden, holder of the coast rec
ord. In the event that competition in
these two races makes it impossiblo
for Miller to run 011 the relay team, he
will be replaced by McGuire.
Stanford hopes in the two-mile were
given a boost when Ted Criley ran
the tryouts yesterday in 10:2, the fast
est time shown by any Cardinal run
ner this season.
Weights Uncertain
The weight events are always un
certain affairs in the Big Meet, due
to the great competitive ability of the
rival entrants. Gerkin of California is
unquestionably one of the best come
through athletes on Coach Walter
Christie's squad, and his performances
in meets for the last two years have
marked him as a great weight-tosser
in competition.
Gerkin defeated Tiny Hartranft, cap
tain of last year's Stanford team, in
a totally unlooked-for upset in the
shot. This performance places him on
a high standing among coast weiglit
tossers, and is conclusive evidence of
his ability. Biff Hoffman, Cardinal
! star, will have a great battle with
Gerkin Saturday. He enters the meet
with the edge in his favor, but no one
knows exactly what the outcome will
be wnen the rivals begin their work
with the 16-pound pellet.
Hoffman Impressive
Hoffman made an impressive show
ing against Bud Houser in the U.S.C.
meet, losing first place in the shot-put
by a scant half inch. In the Oregon
meet last Saturday the Stanford star
tossed the shot 47 feet 1-2 inch for a
first place, lie lias steadily improved
his marks all season, and the Cali
fornia meet should see the height of
liis ability.
Hoffman seems to have a better
chance to cop the honors in the dis
cus. He has consistently thrown the
platter over the 140-foot mark in prac
tice, and his efforts so far have bet
tered the best distances made by the
California men, Gerkin and Phillips.
Hoffman won the national collegiate
discus title last spring after he had
gone through a mediocre season with
the varsity, and his marks made at the
end of this season should be better
than ever.
Battle for Third
The battle for third place in both
weight events will probably be as hard
fought as the struggle for first. Evans
of Stanford has steadily improved all
season and the California meet should
find him at his best. Phillips of Cali
fornia is a good discus thrower, and
he will give the Cardinal man a good
battle.
The hurdle races also promise to be
events in which a last-minute effort
will give victory to either of the rival
teams. West of Stanford and Ragan
of California are figured to produce
a great race in the 120-yard high hur
dles. Ragan has been a steady winner
for the Bears all season, and his races
in the high barriers mark him as a
serious contender for first place in the
Big Meet. West is a heady runner and
is possessed of a great finishing abil
ity. Spencer of Stanford is conceded
a fine chance for the third-place point.
Johnson Favored
Johnson of California is favored to
take the 220-yard low hurdles over
West. The Bear hurdler is a fine com
petitive runner, and he is expected to
beat out the Cardinal ace if the race
is close at the finish. Ragan will also
come into consideration in this event,
and lie and Spencer will probably
stage another great finish.
The low hurdles will have a great
effect upon the outcome of the meet
as they are usually run just before
the finishing events. If the point score
is very close at this time, the results
of the lows may swing the advantage
to a considerable extent. At all events,
both hurdles will be bitterly contested
races, and will be one of the highlights
of the Big Meet.
Ted Miller, Pacific Coast intercolle

Battle for Third
The battle for third place in both
weight events will probably be as hard
fought as the struggle for first. Evans
of Stanford has steadily improved all
season and the California meet should
find him at his best. Phillips of Cali
fornia is a good discus thrower, and
he will give the Cardinal man a good
battle.
The hurdle races also promise to be
events in which a last-minute effort
will give victory to either of the rival
teams. West of Stanford and Ragan
of California are figured to produce
a great race in the 120-yard high hur
dles. Ragan has been a steady winner
for the Bears all season, and his races
in the high barriers mark him as a
serious contender for first place in the
Big Meet. West is a heady runner and
is possessed of a great finishing abil
ity. Spencer of Stanford is conceded
a fine chance for the third-place point.
Johnson Favored
Johnson of California is favored to
take the 220-yard low hurdles over
West. The Bear hurdler is a fine com
petitive runner, and he is expected to
beat out the Cardinal ace if the race
is close at the finish. Ragan will also
come into consideration in this event,
and lie and Spencer will probably
stage another great finish.
The low hurdles will have a great
effect upon the outcome of the meet
as they are usually run just before
the finishing events. If the point score
is very close at this time, the results
of the lows may swing the advantage
to a considerable extent. At all events,
both hurdles will be bitterly contested
races, and will be one of the highlights
of the Big Meet.
Ted Miller, Pacific Coast intercolle
giate quarter-mile champion, is sched
uled to enter the 880-yard run in addi
tion to his favorite event, the 440, in
next Saturday's 32nd annual Big Meet.
Miller, together with Captain Bill
Richardson, will be pitted against El
mer Boyden, holder of the coast rec
ord. In the event that competition in
these two races makes it impossiblo
for Miller to run 011 the relay team, he
will be replaced by McGuire.
Stanford hopes in the two-mile were
given a boost when Ted Criley ran
the tryouts yesterday in 10:2, the fast
est time shown by any Cardinal run
ner this season.
Weights Uncertain
The weight events are always un
certain affairs in the Big Meet, due
to the great competitive ability of the
rival entrants. Gerkin of California is
unquestionably one of the best come
through athletes on Coach Walter
Christie's squad, and his performances
in meets for the last two years have
marked him as a great weight-tosser
in competition.
Gerkin defeated Tiny Hartranft, cap
tain of last year's Stanford team, in
a totally unlooked-for upset in the
shot. This performance places him on
a high standing among coast weiglit
tossers, and is conclusive evidence of
his ability. Biff Hoffman, Cardinal
! star, will have a great battle with
Gerkin Saturday. He enters the meet
with the edge in his favor, but no one
knows exactly what the outcome will
be wnen the rivals begin their work
with the 16-pound pellet.
Hoffman Impressive
Hoffman made an impressive show
ing against Bud Houser in the U.S.C.
meet, losing first place in the shot-put
by a scant half inch. In the Oregon
meet last Saturday the Stanford star
tossed the shot 47 feet 1-2 inch for a
first place, lie lias steadily improved
his marks all season, and the Cali
fornia meet should see the height of
liis ability.
Hoffman seems to have a better
chance to cop the honors in the dis
cus. He has consistently thrown the
platter over the 140-foot mark in prac
tice, and his efforts so far have bet
tered the best distances made by the
California men, Gerkin and Phillips.
Hoffman won the national collegiate
discus title last spring after he had
gone through a mediocre season with
the varsity, and his marks made at the
end of this season should be better
than ever.

The battle for third place in both
weight events will probably be as hard
