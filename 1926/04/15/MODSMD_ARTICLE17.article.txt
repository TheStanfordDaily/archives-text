# CARDINALS READY FOR CLASH WITH CALIFORNIA SATURDAY
## Hopes in Two-Mile Boosted When Ted Criley Is Timed at 10:2 BEST TIME THIS SEASON Ted Miller, Star 440 Man, Scheduled to Enter in Half-Mile Race 
### Clif Moore 
Ted Miller, Pacific Coast intercolle
giate quarter-mile champion, is sched
uled to enter the 880-yard run in addi
tion to his favorite event, the 440, in
next Saturday's 32nd annual Big Meet.
Miller, together with Captain Bill
Richardson, will be pitted against El
mer Boyden, holder of the coast rec
ord. In the event that competition in
these two races makes it impossiblo
for Miller to run 011 the relay team, he
will be replaced by McGuire.
Stanford hopes in the two-mile were
given a boost when Ted Criley ran
the tryouts yesterday in 10:2, the fast
est time shown by any Cardinal run
ner this season.
Weights Uncertain
The weight events are always un
certain affairs in the Big Meet, due
to the great competitive ability of the
rival entrants. Gerkin of California is
unquestionably one of the best come

Christie's squad, and his performances
in meets for the last two years have
marked him as a great weight-tosser
in competition.
Gerkin defeated Tiny Hartranft, cap

a totally unlooked-for upset in the
shot. This performance places him on
a high standing among coast weiglit
tossers, and is conclusive evidence of
his ability. Biff Hoffman, Cardinal
