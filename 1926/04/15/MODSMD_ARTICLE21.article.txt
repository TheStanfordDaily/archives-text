# A 						Garage!

Despite the efforts of popular song writers to reintroduce horsedrawn
vehicles, automobiles are here to stay —at least until air transportation is
made safer and cheaper. Stanford has its share of the horseless carriages.
Although 110 exact figures are available, a recent estimate made by one of
our reporters sets the number of cars in use at approximately one to every
six students.
Most of the autos are inauspicious hybrids; but among the wrecks
there is an appreciable quantity of more valuable motors which, due to a
shortage of storing places on the campus, deteriorate far more rapidly
than they should. The elements are unkind; and even the saving of the
surface does not save all.
According to Comptroller A. E. Roth, the feasibility of installing gar
ages has been considered by the University; but obstacles were confronted
which have caused indecision. In the first place, there was some doubt as
to whether the students would patronize a centrally located garage, if one
were erected. It was thought that, rather than walk a short distance, auto
owners would continue to leave their cars parked helter-skelter in front of
their abodes.
In the second place, it did not seem possible to build a garage adjacent
to each living group. Future building plans for some vicinities definitely
block this step.
So the proposition is limited and the most practical scheme would be
to have a central garage at some place as accessible as the corporation
yards. This would probably lie the most sightly, for the structure could
be made to conform with the rest of the University architecture.
But it would be an expensive project; and before it could be definitely
considered, its financial success would have to be assured. The standard
rate for garage storage is $7.50 a month. If more than 100 students would
agree to rent space in the building at this figure, there would be some basis
on which to consider the scheme.
Some of the University women were consulted by officials who were
discussing the possibility of erecting a garage near Roble. But the men
have not l>een given a chance for expression.

WE WONDER IF SHOWERS in Encina gymnasium could not be
made to do their duty—to give forth even a little water to Stanford's be
grimed athletes just in from the athletic fields after an afternoon's work?
It seems that one must pick about three of the hundred-odd showers and
use them early in the afternoon to receive adequate service—and water.
The University has done well in its provision of many shower pipes and
facilities but showers without water are a joke indeed.

Theoretical policy from the words of Fred J. Kelly, dean of men, at
the University of Minnesota:
"No restriction of the right of free speech is being attempted by the University."

The great national sport suffers at Long Beach. The Long Beach
High Life:
"Some students do not seeni to know that Poly High has a baseball team. Base
ball is the national game, and it wouldn't hurt some of the students to spend fifteen
cents and attend the game."
