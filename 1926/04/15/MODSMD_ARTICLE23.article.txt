# CABBAGES and THINGS

### Steve O'Donnell 
Several enterprising freshmen are said to have borrowed the Palo Alto
trolley the other night and to have driven it out to Encina, without the pre
liminary precaution of letting the motorman in on the secret.

Rumor has it that the authorities are planning some sort of punishment
for the offenders.

Editorially, Cabbages believes that the guilty men should be prosecuted.
Always in the front rank of the honest and conscientious citizenry, Chat's us.

However, there is a limit to all things. Let us merely prosecute the
wrongdoer, not persecute him.
These men have suffered enough. They have amply repaid for whatever
offense they committed. Let it not be said that, at Stanford University, a
man's punishment is out of all proportion to his misdemeanor. There is no
need of imposing any further sentence on the men who took that street car.
Did they not have to ride on the Palo Alto trolley?
