# THE 						WAIL OF THE WOGGLY-WOOS
## 
### 
The lake has sprung an awful leak and gradually seeps dry,
While from the waves all through the week, comes, mournfully, a cry.
'Tis sorrowful to hear the woe resound in every note,
For while the lake is sinking so, there's terror in each throat.
The water-shrimp, the polly-wog, all madly dash around,
For soon there'll be a muddy bog—what isn't stone-dry ground!
Each woggly-woo who sees his fate in lake with water fled,
Anticipates an early date when he will be quite dead.
They congregate in shoals and schools to talk afld cry and moan,
And each one calls his fellows fools and speaks with bated tone.
They wonder if, when comes the hour for each to take his leave,
They'll meet the Mighty Unknown Power whose edict makes them grieve.
They speculate about the drouth when all the fish were saved
By getting in the fisher's mouth —and each a rescuer craved.
And while they tremble with their fear, and dash from here to there,
There comes a footstep, waxing near —it is a damsel fair,
Accompanied by seven sheiks —each in his suit looks trim —
They merrily, with yells and shreiks, jump in to take a swim.
"Hurrah! We're saved! Come to this side!" cride out the woggly-woos,
And from the noise, both far and near, goes out the happy news.
The wogglys slip beneath the caps adorning every head,
And in the hair, without mishaps, each makes a comfy bed.
When, bathing done, the gang departs, they take away, rejoicing,
The rescued wogglys—with each heart its thankful blessing voicing.
So ends the tale of woggly-woos—and so, they dodged their death.
Hey, listen, I ain't had no booze —you needn't smell my breath! —L.A.B.
