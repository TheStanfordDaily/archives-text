Apologies to Stanford's own atrocity
ELSIE'S CHRISTMAS BURGLAR
By Herbie Twiddle, Age 19
Third Grade, Miss Fidget's Room
(First Prize—A Good Big Kiss)
the snow was falling softly ....
Little Elsie sat by the roaring fire with her pink toesies curled up under
her, smoking a big cigar, and waiting Would Santa Claus never come?
Or perhaps, as the schismatists had it, it might well be that there was no
Santa Claus
A skeleton key grated silently in the door, and a dark, burly man entered
in three steps and a derby. Highjack Jerry (for it was, simple-minded reader,
none other) started as he saw the wistful little figure by the fire.
"You're three minutes late this year, Mr. Santy Claus," lisped the little tot.
"Sorry, little gel." was the genial reply, "but there were so many good
little boys and girls this year that poor old Santa was kept busy filling their
stockings with nice cocktail-mixers and loaded dice and other wonderful,
wonderful toys."
"Well, your lunch is all laid out for you on that sideboard, and you will
find the silver in that flowerpot in the corner. We're keeping it there this
year, you know."
Without more ado, Highjack Jerry helped himself to the delectable colla
tion upon the sideboard, consisting of a cheese sandwich and a glass of milk.
Refreshed, he turned to the work of the evening.
"Tell me a story," the little lass begged, with appealing eyebrows.
"Oh, 110, Elsie, I must do my work and go back to the frozen northland
and my dear, loving reindeer. Where at did you say that silver was?"
"in the safe-deposit vault at the bank," oiled the guileless child. "And,
oh, yes! That big man behind that screen is my good, kind daddy, and he
remembers you from last year. And those sandwiches were poisoned, too."
The big man lifted a substantial-looking meat-ax and swiftly moved across
the room to the discomfited Santa Claus
Down three flights of stairs and out into the gathering storm, Highjack
Jerry traveled, mostly on the back of his neck. He felt completely disjointed
from end to end. Hijack Jerry's Christmas stocking had someone else's foot
in it.
Outside the snow was still falling as softly as possible .... it always
does in these damned Christmas stories.

Down three flights of stairs and out into the gathering storm, Highjack
Jerry traveled, mostly on the back of his neck. He felt completely disjointed
from end to end. Hijack Jerry's Christmas stocking had someone else's foot
in it.
Outside the snow was still falling as softly as possible .... it always
does in these damned Christmas stories.
