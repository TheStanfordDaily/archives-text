Now the truth of the whole matter is that we cognoscenti of the Stanford
Lit do not believe in anything. We do not believe in Gor, or in purity, or the
Sponsor System, or love, or springtime, or correctors.
Everything is 110 good, except free-verse and free-speech and free-lunch.
But of course it's pretty easy to write editorials. All we have to do is
to steal some stuff from our distinguished contemporaries, H. L. Mencken
and George Jean Nathan, add a few fancy words lige "opus" and "flapdoodle"
and "hinterland," and we're all done for the month.
