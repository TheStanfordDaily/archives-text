# Junior Crew Award for Washington Is Changed
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON—
(P.I.P.) —The request of the junior
varsity crew for a more attractive
award for their services was granted
by the Board of Control at its last
meeting. The new award will be a
four-inch block "W" with an oar cross
ing it diagonally, and will be mounted
without a background on a blue
sweater.
This is the standard award which is
given to jayvee oarsmen in most of
the schools with whom Washington
crews compete. It displays a "W" with
a "J" and "V" on either side, mounted
on a purple background with gold
trimming.

Manual labor is being emphasized
at Brown College, Ark., instead of the
usual "white-collar" jobs. Four hours
of productive labor, four hours of
classwork and bible study are re
quired. Fraternities and intercollegiate
athletics are barred.
