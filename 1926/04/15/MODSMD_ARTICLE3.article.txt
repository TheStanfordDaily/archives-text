# INTREPID STUDENTS STEAL TOONERVILLE FOR MIDNIGHT RIDE
## 
### 
A group of intrepid, though
certainly not fastidious students,
borrowed the Palo Alto trolley
early yesterday morning, accord
ing to an announcement made by
the car company officials.
It appears that the car was
missed, according to the com
pany, iu those dim and uncertain
hours between midnight and
dawn.
When the loss was discovered,
a frantic search was immediately
begun. There was only about two
or three miles of possible hiding
place for the trolley, and soon it
was located near Encina hall.
It appears that the thoughtful
students, rather than disturb the
motorman's sleep, applied the
cafeteria principle to the trans
portation problem.
