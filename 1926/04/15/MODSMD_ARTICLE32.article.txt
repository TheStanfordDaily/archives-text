# MANY ALUMNI PLAN TO ATTEND ANNUAL GLEE CLUB CONCERT
## Stanford Singers Will Give Repertoire of Popular, Classical Music 
### Herbert Klein 
Alumni are expected to fill a large
number of the seats in the Assembly
hall when the Glee Club presents its
annual Home Concert tomorrow night.
Coming the night before the Pig Meet
and featuring as soloist Harry Robert
son, a Stanford man, the recital has
already attracted a large number of
returning graduates.
The one o'clock dance in the Wo
men's Clubhouse is also intended for
the enjoyment of the alumni as well
as students. It has been arranged to
start at 10:30 o'clock, so that it may
be attended as a regular campus dance
by those who are unable to go to the
concert. Hal Todd's orchestra will fur
nish the music.
Under the direction of Warren D.
Allen, the singers have prepared one
of the most ambitious repertoires they
have ever offered. Musical worth, not
difficulty, has been the criterion by
which their songs were selected. As a
result, they will offer four groups of
choral numbers that represent the best
in classical as well as modern music.
Several light and humorous works will
also be sung.
The highlights of the Glee Club's
program will probably be "Adoramus
Te" and "Improperia," two numbers
by Palestrina, one of the greatest com
posers of church music. "Dirge for Two
Veterans," by Gustav Hoist, will be
sung for the first time in the West
tomorrow night, and so adds a note of
musical importance to the concert. The
finale from Gilbert and Sullivan's
comic opera, "The Gondoliers," will
close the program. Other notable
works are "Salterelle" by Saint-Saens,
with all its variations and contrasting
effects; "Morning Hymn," by Krug,
and "Hymn to Soma," another compo
sition by Hoist.
Max Dolin and his California Trio
are expected to prove immensely popu
lar. They are one of the big attractions
of the California Theater in San Fran
cisco. Dolin and his violin are a com
bination that can hardly be matched
at such compositions as the Serenade
from "The Student Prince," and "In
dian Love Call" from "Rose Marie,"
which he will play tomorrow night.
A few tickets are still left on sale
in the lobby of the Old Union at $1
and 50 cents each.
