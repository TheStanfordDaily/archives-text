# COWDERY COMPLETES INTELLIGENCE TEST GRADING, TABULATION

### 
The Supplementary Intelligence
Tests given in California, Oregon,
Washington, and Utah under the super
vision of Karl M. Cowdery, Director
of Personal Research, have been com
pleted and carefully graded. This year
the average grouping of the applicants
was based on the average scores of
the present student body of the Uni
versity.
Robert G. Bernreuter, Research As
sistant in the Registrar's Office, has
compiled the following interesting and
significant statistics in reference to
the applicants for October, 1926:
Av.Test
Applicants Number Score
Men —Freshmen 603 73.2
Men —Advanced 113 73.7
Men—Total 716 73.3
Women —Freshmen 415 71.3
Women —Advanced 100 73.0
Women —Total 515 71.6
Men and Women —Total 1231 72.6
Of these, but 450 Lower Division
men can be accepted, 105 undergradu
ate women, and 306 graduate women.
Hence the number of men admitted
of those applying as indicated by those
who took the test will be about one
out of every two, while only one out
of four of the women applying will be
allowed to enter. As so many must be
eliminated, the test score will be
given its due weight with the other
credentials of the applicant in order
to help the University to discriminate.
The Thorndike Test scores have
been found to be just as valuable and
reliable a prediction of University
work, as was the four years of high
school work. Neither is infallible, but
if both are good success is very nearly
assured. Admission is not based on
any one factor, but on the accumula
tion of factors.
Whereas the total average score of
men and women for this year is lower
than last year—72.6 versus 76.1—it
does not necessarily Imply that the
group now applying is less fit. It may
be that the test was more difficult;
such things are practically impossible
to judge.
It is most interesting to note that
the average of the advanced men
applying is but .4 higher than that of
the freshmen. Last year and all pre
vious years there has always been a
noticeable difference between the two
groups.

eliminated, the test score will be
given its due weight with the other
credentials of the applicant in order
to help the University to discriminate.
The Thorndike Test scores have
been found to be just as valuable and
reliable a prediction of University
work, as was the four years of high
school work. Neither is infallible, but
if both are good success is very nearly
assured. Admission is not based on
any one factor, but on the accumula
tion of factors.
Whereas the total average score of
men and women for this year is lower
than last year—72.6 versus 76.1—it
does not necessarily Imply that the
group now applying is less fit. It may
be that the test was more difficult;
such things are practically impossible
to judge.
It is most interesting to note that
the average of the advanced men
applying is but .4 higher than that of
the freshmen. Last year and all pre
vious years there has always been a
noticeable difference between the two
groups.
