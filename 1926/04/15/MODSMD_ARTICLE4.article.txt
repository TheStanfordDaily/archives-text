# BABES DROP SERIES TO CALIFORNIA NINE IN SECOND CONTEST
## Bears Make Six Tallies in Second Inning to Win By 7 to 3 Score 
### 
Duplicating their 7 to 3 victory over
the Stanford freshmen in their first
game last week, the California year
lings won the second contest and with
it the annual series yesterday after
noon at Berkeley.
With the exception of the second
inning, the Stanford men held their
opponents to a single tally, while they
were garnering three runs and six
hits. In that disastrous frame, how
ever, fqur California hits, three out
field errors, and two walks completely
routed the Cardinal team, six runs
being scored before the side had been
retired. Although the freshmen tight
ened and outplayed the Bruins for the
remaining seven innings, the six-run
handicap proved too much.
Stanford opened the game by scor
ing a run in the first, Hartley, lead-off
man, coming home on an infield error.
Jacobsen, the California liurler, then
retired his opponents in order for the
next three innings. California, blanked
in the first, came back in the second
to pile up six runs, but Kern, the Stan
ford pitcher, retired the Bears in order
for the next three innings.
Wilton, second baseman, scored the
second Stanford tally in the fourth
on California errors, a single by Har
der, and Roger's walk. Wilton's two
bagger in the next frame scored the
babes' final run, his hit scoring Brown.
Two hits in the seventh by Davis and
Wright were the only other Stanford
threats.
The Stanford line-up is as follows:
pitcher, Kern; catcher, Brown; first
base, Wright; second base, Hartley;
third base, Harder; shortstop, Roger;
left field, McKey; center field, Wilton;
right field, Davis. Score by innings:
Stanford ...1 0 0 11 0 0 0 o—3
California 0' 0 6 0 0 0 0 1 o—70 —7
