# STUDENT COUNCIL AT HARVARD ADVOCATES CAMBRIDGE SYSTEM
## 
### 
Harvard may be divided into smaller
colleges along the lines of Oxford and
Cambridge if the recommendations of
its Student Council Committee on Edu
cation are carried through by the uni
versity authorities.
Tke committee also recommends
that a new course in a general study
of science be established to meet the
needs of those students fulfilling the
science requirement and not expect
ing to go on in scientific studies. It is
further suggested that the require
ment in philosophy be made compul
sory, and that the general examina
tions for candidates for distinction
should be changed from the senior to
the end of the junior year.
In the report submitted by the com
mittee it was stated that the freshman
dormitory system had proven a suc
cess, but that the following improve
ments were recommended: "First, to
abandon the present system of senior
advisors as inadequate and inoperative;
second, to Increase the number of
proctors in the freshman halls and
enlarge their functions; third, to re
quire all freshmen to live in dormi
tories as soon as facilities permit."
One of the big problems in Harvard
education was declared to be that the
university is too big for a single unit
and needs to be subdivided into ef
fective parts. To do this it was sug
gested that upperclassmen be divided
into permanent residence groups, each
group or college consisting of from 250
to 000 students, with its own dean,
common room, and dining hall.
This plan would not interfere with
the club system, it is stated, men of
kindred interests would draw together
from the different colleges in the same
way as they now do from the dormi
tories. Moreover, it would not inter
fere with the academic department,
for it is but a new residential system
for improving the social side of educa
tion and promoting better understand
ing between diverse groups of stu
dents.
It was recommended that students
be not allowed to substitute mathe
matics for their philosophy require
ment, particularly "at the present
time when organized religion has
ceased to command the allegiance of
large numbers of students." This
course would include the philosophies
of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Kant,
and one of the moderns.
The report urges that seniors be
given more freedom, so that their last
year may be made less of a "night
mare" for them. With the tutorial sys
tem starting in the sophomore year,
less burden would be put on the senior.

cess, but that the following improve
ments were recommended: "First, to
abandon the present system of senior
advisors as inadequate and inoperative;
second, to Increase the number of
proctors in the freshman halls and
enlarge their functions; third, to re
quire all freshmen to live in dormi
tories as soon as facilities permit."
One of the big problems in Harvard
education was declared to be that the
university is too big for a single unit
and needs to be subdivided into ef
fective parts. To do this it was sug
gested that upperclassmen be divided
into permanent residence groups, each
group or college consisting of from 250
to 000 students, with its own dean,
common room, and dining hall.
This plan would not interfere with
the club system, it is stated, men of
kindred interests would draw together
from the different colleges in the same
way as they now do from the dormi
tories. Moreover, it would not inter
fere with the academic department,
for it is but a new residential system
for improving the social side of educa
tion and promoting better understand
ing between diverse groups of stu
dents.
It was recommended that students
be not allowed to substitute mathe
matics for their philosophy require
ment, particularly "at the present
time when organized religion has
ceased to command the allegiance of
large numbers of students." This
course would include the philosophies
of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Kant,
and one of the moderns.
The report urges that seniors be
given more freedom, so that their last
year may be made less of a "night
mare" for them. With the tutorial sys
tem starting in the sophomore year,
less burden would be put on the senior.
