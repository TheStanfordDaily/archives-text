# CARD FENCERS ENTER THREE-CORNERED MEET
## 
### 
Stanford will enter three-cornered
competition with the University of
California and Southern Branch in a
fencing meet to be held at Berkeley
tomorrow. Gaetan Zucco, Carl Stroven,
Ted Criley, and Coach Bugge will
make the trip, along with a three-man
second team.
Last year the Southern Branch first
team defeated Stanford five matches to
four, but lost to the seconds by the
same score. Two veterans of last year's
team, John Tatum and Gerald Dow, are
competing for the Branch squad this
year.
