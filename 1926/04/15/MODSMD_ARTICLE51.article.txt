# SPORTS OF 1926
## Connie Mack 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is good old Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, who
has seen twice as many summers as at least two of the kid bosses of other
clubs in the American League who are trying their best to keep him from
coming back once more to the championship heights which he ruled so suc
cessfully a dozen and more years ago.
But Age will be served, and if, by some miracle, the Athletics find a way
of keeping their first base position from cracking, Connie has a fine chance of
winning another pennant this year, and then the long, lean, hard years spent
in trying out more than 500 ballplayers will not have been spent in vain, and
the popular pilot of Philadelphia's fighting young ball club will reap the
reward of patience and perseverance.
For how can Fate deny Connie a pennant now, after he has slowly worked
his way up to second place after seven straight years in the cellar? Fate is
unkind, but it can't be that cruel. Connie scrapped his championship team in
1910, '11, '13, and '14 because the public got tired of coming out to see perfect
baseball, and now, after seeing more bad baseball in ten years than any other
manager, he is on the very threshold of victory.
Like his contemporary in birth, and fellow manager, Wilbert Robinson,
Cornelius McGillicuddy used to be a catcher; only Connie's growth was more
to the vertical while Uncle Robbie grew extremÂ«lv horizontal. Connie boasts
of eleven years of experience, from 1886 until 1896, with Washington of the
National League, Buffalo of the Players,' and then Pittsburgh. Now how he'd
love to take the world's championship away from the Pirates of 1926!
