# VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM GIVEN EDGE OVER BRUIN SQUAD
## BATTING SLUMP STOPPED Situation Similar to Previous Two Years; First Game Lost, Second Won 
### Herb Klein 
It seems possible that a new tradi
tion will be added to Stanford's list to
replace defunct customs, namely, that
the Stanford varsity baseball team will
each year lose the first game of the
California series after an unimpressive
showing in the early season. It will
then win the second game by a fairly
close margin and walk away with the
I final and deciding contest.
This has been the program for the
! two years previous to this, and every
thing indicates that the team will run
true to this schedule Saturday to take
the series once again.
Tuesday's Win Impressive
The varsity's victory Tuesday was
impressive, for it showed that the
team has definitely come out of the
batting slump it had been undergoing
since before the beginning of its vaca
tion trip. With the Cards on their toes
and slugging, the Bears are definitely
I outclassed. Unless Wolter's men have
a sudden relapse, the dope favors Stan
ford to win.
Another encouraging feature of the
last game was the comparative ab
j sence of errors made by the Cardinal
players. Against the multitude of costly
| bungles in the first game, Stanford
had only two errors Tuesday, while
I California had four. One of the two
i Berkeley runs came in on an error by
S Clark, who missed an apparently easy
i fly in the outfield; the other was at
i tribute dto Collins, who pitched.
Line-up Unchanged
With the exception of the pitcher,
j Wolter will probably start the same
lineup Saturday. Sypher, catcher,
: proved himself a batter in a pinch on
Tuesday, when he made a clean sacri
fice in the ninth to bring Clark over
the plate for the winning tally.
Maguire at first played errorless ball
and started the batting off by getting
, the first hit of the game in the first
inning. Garibaldi will be at second and
j Captain Cuddeback at third, as pre
viously. Busch will be at shorstop
i again. The outfield lineup of Weaver,
Nissen, and Clark is expected to con
tinue to fatten the team's slugging
average.
