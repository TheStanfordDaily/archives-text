# Johnson, Ruth To Sing Duets From Popular Operas
## 
### 
Tonight in the Assembly hall the
! Peninsula Music Association will pre-
I sent the final and most distinctive
I concert of its season, with Edward
: Johnson, tenor, and Joan Ruth, so
| prano, of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, in a series of excerpts from
; famous grand operas.
The recital will resemble the real
; opera productions far more than the
I ordinary joint concert, for it will be
I done with appropriate scenery.
Johnson and Miss Ruth have re
! ceived high praise in their ••tour both
for the novelty of their idea and for
! the effective and artistic way in which
| they have worked it out.
The Peninsula Music Association
| has made a special price of $1 on
downstairs seats for students. A num
ber of 50-Cent seats in the balcony
j are also on sale at the Stanford Book
: store and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
; By choosing the most appealing and
' beautiful vocal numbers of three well
i known operas, the two singers have
| enabled their audiences to hear the
popular duets and arias which are the
| chief attraction of the compositions
from which they are taken.
"La Boheme* by Puccini, "Romeo
and Juliet" by Gounod, and "Rigoletto"
