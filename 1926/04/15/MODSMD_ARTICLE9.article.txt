# Johnson, Ruth To Sing Duets From Popular Operas
## 
### 
Tonight in the Assembly hall the
! Peninsula Music Association will pre-
I sent the final and most distinctive
I concert of its season, with Edward
: Johnson, tenor, and Joan Ruth, so
| prano, of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, in a series of excerpts from
; famous grand operas.
The recital will resemble the real
; opera productions far more than the
I ordinary joint concert, for it will be
I done with appropriate scenery.
Johnson and Miss Ruth have re
! ceived high praise in their ••tour both
for the novelty of their idea and for
! the effective and artistic way in which
| they have worked it out.
The Peninsula Music Association
| has made a special price of $1 on
downstairs seats for students. A num
ber of 50-Cent seats in the balcony
j are also on sale at the Stanford Book
: store and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
; By choosing the most appealing and
' beautiful vocal numbers of three well
i known operas, the two singers have
| enabled their audiences to hear the
popular duets and arias which are the
| chief attraction of the compositions
from which they are taken.
"La Boheme* by Puccini, "Romeo
and Juliet" by Gounod, and "Rigoletto"
by Verdi are the three which will be
represented by their choicest parts.
The program will be as follows: from
"La Boheme" the scene of Mimi's en
trance, followed by the duet with Ro
dolfo; Rodolfo's aria, "Che gelida
Manina" (your tiny hands are cold);
Mimi's aria, Mi cliiainano Mimi"; scene
and duet, "O soave fanciulla." In the
scenes Johnson and Miss Ruth will do
the acting that adds to the dramatic
interest of the songs which follow.
The "Romeo and Juliet" selections
will be among the most beautiful on
the program, including Juliet's famous
"Waltz Song" and the Balcony Scene.
The closing number will be the great
scene and duet, "O Nuit, divine!"
From Verdi's tragic "Rigoletto" the
selections are: the Duke of Mantua's
aria, "La donna e mobile" (Woman is '
fickle); Gilda's famous aria, "Caro
Nome" (Dear name); the duet, "Signor
ne principe io lo vorrei," and the
Finale, "Addio, addio speranze ad
animo."
Miss Ruth, who is noted as one of
the most beautiful singers of grand
opera, is cast in three roles which call
for delicacy and grace. Johnson is,
rated by competent critics as one of
the finest operatic tenors in America.
Not only is his voice rich and satisfy
ing, but his acting and stage bearing 1
are held up as models of artistry.

Salaries of the editor and manager
of the Blue and Gold, University of
California annual, have been lowered
on the charge that they have been ex
horbitantly high in proportion to the
funds of the book.

Miss Ruth, who is noted as one of
the most beautiful singers of grand
opera, is cast in three roles which call
for delicacy and grace. Johnson is,
rated by competent critics as one of
the finest operatic tenors in America.
Not only is his voice rich and satisfy
ing, but his acting and stage bearing 1
are held up as models of artistry.

Salaries of the editor and manager
of the Blue and Gold, University of
California annual, have been lowered
on the charge that they have been ex
horbitantly high in proportion to the
funds of the book.
Tonight in the Assembly hall the
! Peninsula Music Association will pre-
I sent the final and most distinctive
I concert of its season, with Edward
: Johnson, tenor, and Joan Ruth, so
| prano, of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, in a series of excerpts from
; famous grand operas.
The recital will resemble the real
; opera productions far more than the
I ordinary joint concert, for it will be
I done with appropriate scenery.
Johnson and Miss Ruth have re
! ceived high praise in their ••tour both
for the novelty of their idea and for
! the effective and artistic way in which
| they have worked it out.
The Peninsula Music Association
| has made a special price of $1 on
downstairs seats for students. A num
ber of 50-Cent seats in the balcony
j are also on sale at the Stanford Book
: store and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
; By choosing the most appealing and
' beautiful vocal numbers of three well
i known operas, the two singers have
| enabled their audiences to hear the
popular duets and arias which are the
| chief attraction of the compositions
from which they are taken.
"La Boheme* by Puccini, "Romeo
and Juliet" by Gounod, and "Rigoletto"
by Verdi are the three which will be
represented by their choicest parts.
The program will be as follows: from
"La Boheme" the scene of Mimi's en
trance, followed by the duet with Ro
dolfo; Rodolfo's aria, "Che gelida
Manina" (your tiny hands are cold);
Mimi's aria, Mi cliiainano Mimi"; scene
and duet, "O soave fanciulla." In the
scenes Johnson and Miss Ruth will do
the acting that adds to the dramatic
interest of the songs which follow.
The "Romeo and Juliet" selections
will be among the most beautiful on
the program, including Juliet's famous
"Waltz Song" and the Balcony Scene.
The closing number will be the great
scene and duet, "O Nuit, divine!"
From Verdi's tragic "Rigoletto" the
selections are: the Duke of Mantua's
aria, "La donna e mobile" (Woman is '
fickle); Gilda's famous aria, "Caro
Nome" (Dear name); the duet, "Signor
ne principe io lo vorrei," and the
Finale, "Addio, addio speranze ad
animo."
