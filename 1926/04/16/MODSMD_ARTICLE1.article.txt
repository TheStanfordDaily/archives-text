# CARDS FAVORED
## California Baseball Squad Arrives For Big Clash VARSITY BALL TEAM OPPOSES BRUINS IN DECIDING GAME OF SERIES ON STANFORD DIAMOND Cardinal Is Much Improved Over First Showing of Present Season BILL MAGUIRE ON FIRST Collins or Sobieski to Hurl For Stanford in Final Tilt Tomorrow 
### Herb Klein 
Two evenly matched teams, each with
one game to their crcdit and fighting hard
to win the last, will meet tomorrow after
noon on the Stanford diamond when
Coach Harry Wolter's Cardinal nine set
tles the Big Series with Carl Zamloch's
California Bruins tomorrow afternoon
following the Big Meet.
For the third successive year the Ber
keley players have been the victors in the
first contest, and have lost the second.
Whether the third and deciding meeting
will follow the example of those during
the past two years and go to Stanford is
the burning question of the hour.
Two weeks ago in the first game played
at Berkeley, the Cards came out at the
short end of a 3-to-l score. Their failure
to hit when hits were most needed and
several costly errors made in defensive
play lost them the contest. "Count" So
bieski twirled a good game, allowing only
seven hits.
Cards Improve
Last Tuesday the Cards looked like a
different team when they took the Bears
down the line decisively. The score of
.3 to 2 does not indicate how far ahead
the Stanford playing was. The entire
nine was on its toes in defensive play and
made only two errors, as against more
than three times that number in the first
game. Steve Collins was in the box for
the entire game atul allowed only four
hits, striking out six Cal batters.
Pre-season predictions to the effect
that the Stanford nine would be an ex
ceptionally hard-hitting bunch this year
were not fulfilled until this second game.
Nomecheck, who took the box for Cali
fornia in the last inning, fared no better,
allowing two hits, one of which, by Sy
pher, brought Clark across the plate for
the run which replaced the tied score
by one reading 3 to 2 for Stanford. The
bases were 21oaded four times by the
Cards in the nine innings.
It is true that there was a low ratio
of runs to hits for the Cards—with eleven
bingles they only crossed the plate three
li mcs —but the fact remains that there
was hitting, and plenty of it. 'Ibis tact
