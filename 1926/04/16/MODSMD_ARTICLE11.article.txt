# DONALD H. ALDEN IS ELECTED TO HEAD STANFORD Y. M. C. A.
## 
### 
Election returns from Thursday's
balloting confirm the selections made
by the Y.M.C.A. nominating committee
when all candidates were elected to
their respective offices. Officers for the
coming year are Donald H. Aldcn,
president; Thomas E. Drake, vice
president; Yale C. Maxon, secretary;
and John C. Duniway, board of direct
ors. Positions in the board of directors
for two-year terms were filled by A. M.
Cathcart, Dr. D. C. Gardner, A. E.
Roth, and Dr. Karl M. Cowdery for a
one-year term.
Nominations were made by a com
mittee composed of William L. Gosslin,
William A. Hyde, Sheldon S. Milliken,
Richard W. Taylor, Professor William
M. Proctor, and Rex Bell.
A new policy will be adopted by the
incoming officers in order to facilitate
the better functioning of committees.
Instead of the division into eighteen
different phases of work with a com
mittee chairman sitting in the cabinet,
the department will be cut down to four
main sections wtih committee members
covering all minor phases.
Alden was chairman of the handbook
committee and due to his work thirteen
hundred "Freshmen Bibles" were dis
tributed last fall. Drake recently di
rected the committee on Chapel and
Church, while Maxon held the position
of cabinet secretary. Duniway was
chairman of the Finance Committee of
the Y.M.C.A. Cathcart and Dr. Gard
ner are old members of the board as is
