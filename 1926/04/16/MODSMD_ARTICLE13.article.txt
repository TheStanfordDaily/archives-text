# STANFORD GIVEN SLIGHT EDGE OVER CALIFORNIA VARSITY IN THIRTY SECOND ANNUAL MEET
## Richardson, Boyden Half-Mile Run To Be Feature Event of Day BEARS HAVE POLE VAULT Miller Will Try to Break Own Record in 440; Entered in Half 
### Clif Moore 
With Captain Bill Richardson and
Elmer Boyden staging their annual
half-mile race as the outstanding fea
ture of the thirty-second Stanford-
California intercollegiate track meet,
the crowd assembled at tomorrow's
meeting of Coach Dink Templeton's
Cardinal athletes and Walter Christie's
Bruin trackmen in the Stanford sta
dium will witness one of the greatest
struggles in track history of the two
institutions. The Big Meet will begiu
promptly at 1:45 o'clock when the rival
milers enter the first event on the
program.
The concensus of opinion gives the
meet to Stanford by a fairly large
margin of points, but dopesters sup
posedly on the inside are more con
servative in their estimates. Careful
consideration of the various elements
entering into the results of the meet
seem to indicate that a close score can
be expected. Templeton's athletes
should hold the advantage all during
the meet, and even if California shows
enough strength to even the score
near the end, Stanford's relay team
can be counted on to win the final
five points and victory.
Stanford Balanced
Results of the meets with the Uni
versity of Southern California gives
Stanford the edge because of the bet
ter showing made by the Cardinal
trackmen. Comparisons of the two
teams show Templeton's squad to be
more evenly balanced than Christie's
Bears. As is the general rule in the
California-Stanford contests, it is
rather unsafe to predict a positive
score.
In a meet bound to be full of great
struggles and thrilling performances,
the fourth annual race between Cap
tain Bill Richardson of Stanford and
Elmer Boyden of California, promises
to be the finest event on the program.
Boyden defeated the Cardinal leader
when the two BSO stars competed on
the rival freshman teams, and the
next year Richardson turned the tables
on Boyden, when the California ace
was running for the Olympic Club.
Last year the two rivals again met,
this time in the Bear-Card varsity
meet. Boyden defeated his Stanford
opponent in the greatest half-mile race
seen on the coast, and in doing so
established a new Stanford-California
record for the distance. This season
botli men have negotiated the half-mile
in 1.55 7-10, and their final meeting on
the rival varsities should be the great
est battle in their equally brilliant
careers.
Another important feature is added
to the 880 event by the news that Ted
Miller, star Stanford quarter-miler, and
holder of the Pacific Coast intercolle
giate title for that event, will also
compete in the Richardson-Boyden
classic. Miller may spring a big sur
prise in this race by beating out either
his teammate or opponent.
Barber Best Sprinter
The sprints appear to be a pair of
highly interesting races. Captain Phil
Barber, a consistent double winner in
California meets this season, is fa
vored to take both the century and
220 for the Bears. Little is known
about the real ability of the Stanford
speed stars, as Coverly started out like
a flash and gradually slowed to a dis
appointing finish in most of this year's
meets, and Hyland has suddenly come
up in a surprising manner to a high
regard in the opinion of track en
thusiasts.
Hyland should furnish the main op
position for Barber in the 100-yard
dash, with Gaspar or Coverly taking
third, and Coverly should press the
Bruin captain in the furlong, again
with Gaspar third. Hyland has been
laid up for a few days with a sprained
muscle in his leg, but it is almost cer
tain that he will be in good condition
by Saturday.
Miller, Storie, and Babcock may
score a clean sweep in the quarter
mile, with a chance that Talbot of
California might break in for a third.
Bill Kerr and Les Sehwobeda will have
a real battle in the mile with chances
about even for first honors. Ranney of
Stanford or Ross of California will
place third.
California Has Two-Milers
Criley's good time in the tryouts for
the two-mile mark him as the Stanford
runner having the best chance to
break into the strong California one
two combination, Stevens and Fox.
Swain of Stanford is also figured in
this event, so the eight-lap race should
produce another close finish.
West is favored to cop the honors in
the high hurdles from Ragan of Cali
fornia, while Johnson of California is
doped to take first place from West in
the low sticks. Spencer of Stanford is
conceded the best chance to take
thirds in both races.

fornia, while Johnson of California is
doped to take first place from West in
the low sticks. Spencer of Stanford is
conceded the best chance to take
thirds in both races.
With Captain Bill Richardson and
Elmer Boyden staging their annual
half-mile race as the outstanding fea
ture of the thirty-second Stanford-
California intercollegiate track meet,
the crowd assembled at tomorrow's
meeting of Coach Dink Templeton's
Cardinal athletes and Walter Christie's
Bruin trackmen in the Stanford sta
dium will witness one of the greatest
struggles in track history of the two
institutions. The Big Meet will begiu
promptly at 1:45 o'clock when the rival
milers enter the first event on the
program.
The concensus of opinion gives the
meet to Stanford by a fairly large
margin of points, but dopesters sup
posedly on the inside are more con
servative in their estimates. Careful
consideration of the various elements
entering into the results of the meet
seem to indicate that a close score can
be expected. Templeton's athletes
should hold the advantage all during
the meet, and even if California shows
enough strength to even the score
near the end, Stanford's relay team
can be counted on to win the final
five points and victory.
Stanford Balanced
Results of the meets with the Uni
versity of Southern California gives
Stanford the edge because of the bet
ter showing made by the Cardinal
trackmen. Comparisons of the two
teams show Templeton's squad to be
more evenly balanced than Christie's
Bears. As is the general rule in the
California-Stanford contests, it is
rather unsafe to predict a positive
score.
In a meet bound to be full of great
struggles and thrilling performances,
the fourth annual race between Cap
tain Bill Richardson of Stanford and
Elmer Boyden of California, promises
to be the finest event on the program.
Boyden defeated the Cardinal leader
when the two BSO stars competed on
the rival freshman teams, and the
next year Richardson turned the tables
on Boyden, when the California ace
was running for the Olympic Club.
Last year the two rivals again met,
this time in the Bear-Card varsity
meet. Boyden defeated his Stanford
opponent in the greatest half-mile race
seen on the coast, and in doing so
established a new Stanford-California
record for the distance. This season
botli men have negotiated the half-mile
in 1.55 7-10, and their final meeting on
the rival varsities should be the great
est battle in their equally brilliant
careers.
Another important feature is added
to the 880 event by the news that Ted
Miller, star Stanford quarter-miler, and
holder of the Pacific Coast intercolle
giate title for that event, will also
compete in the Richardson-Boyden
classic. Miller may spring a big sur
prise in this race by beating out either
his teammate or opponent.
Barber Best Sprinter
The sprints appear to be a pair of
highly interesting races. Captain Phil
Barber, a consistent double winner in
California meets this season, is fa
vored to take both the century and
220 for the Bears. Little is known
about the real ability of the Stanford
speed stars, as Coverly started out like
a flash and gradually slowed to a dis
appointing finish in most of this year's
meets, and Hyland has suddenly come
up in a surprising manner to a high
regard in the opinion of track en
thusiasts.
Hyland should furnish the main op
position for Barber in the 100-yard
dash, with Gaspar or Coverly taking
third, and Coverly should press the
Bruin captain in the furlong, again
with Gaspar third. Hyland has been
laid up for a few days with a sprained
muscle in his leg, but it is almost cer
tain that he will be in good condition
by Saturday.
Miller, Storie, and Babcock may
score a clean sweep in the quarter
mile, with a chance that Talbot of
California might break in for a third.
Bill Kerr and Les Sehwobeda will have
a real battle in the mile with chances
about even for first honors. Ranney of
Stanford or Ross of California will
place third.
California Has Two-Milers
Criley's good time in the tryouts for
the two-mile mark him as the Stanford
runner having the best chance to
break into the strong California one
two combination, Stevens and Fox.
Swain of Stanford is also figured in
this event, so the eight-lap race should
produce another close finish.
West is favored to cop the honors in
the high hurdles from Ragan of Cali
fornia, while Johnson of California is
doped to take first place from West in
the low sticks. Spencer of Stanford is
