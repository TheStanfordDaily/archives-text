With Captain Bill Richardson and
Elmer Boyden staging their annual
half-mile race as the outstanding fea
ture of the thirty-second Stanford-
California intercollegiate track meet,
the crowd assembled at tomorrow's
meeting of Coach Dink Templeton's
Cardinal athletes and Walter Christie's
Bruin trackmen in the Stanford sta
dium will witness one of the greatest
struggles in track history of the two
institutions. The Big Meet will begiu
promptly at 1:45 o'clock when the rival
milers enter the first event on the
program.
The concensus of opinion gives the
meet to Stanford by a fairly large
margin of points, but dopesters sup
posedly on the inside are more con
servative in their estimates. Careful
consideration of the various elements
entering into the results of the meet
seem to indicate that a close score can
be expected. Templeton's athletes
should hold the advantage all during
the meet, and even if California shows
enough strength to even the score
near the end, Stanford's relay team
can be counted on to win the final
five points and victory.
Stanford Balanced
Results of the meets with the Uni
versity of Southern California gives
Stanford the edge because of the bet
ter showing made by the Cardinal
trackmen. Comparisons of the two
teams show Templeton's squad to be
more evenly balanced than Christie's
Bears. As is the general rule in the
California-Stanford contests, it is
rather unsafe to predict a positive
score.
In a meet bound to be full of great
struggles and thrilling performances,
the fourth annual race between Cap
tain Bill Richardson of Stanford and
Elmer Boyden of California, promises
to be the finest event on the program.
Boyden defeated the Cardinal leader
when the two BSO stars competed on
the rival freshman teams, and the
next year Richardson turned the tables
