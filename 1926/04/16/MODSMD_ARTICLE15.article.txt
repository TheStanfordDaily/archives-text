the same time it was decided that an
other committee of four should be ap
pointed in the near future to investi
gate offers of other companies. If
more favorable terms are found the
policy will be withdrawn and trans
ferred to such a company.
Anderson, representing the Aetna
Company, said that all the offers were
equal in their security and service
given, but the Aetna offer carried a
sixty-eight cents lower rate of pay
ment. However, members of the com
mittee pointed out that as their divi
dends are also lower the actual rates
practically balance.
At the end of twenty-five years the
whole sum of $250 from each member
of the Senior Class, minus those who
