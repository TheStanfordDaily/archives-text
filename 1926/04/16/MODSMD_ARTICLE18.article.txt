# "Dink" and Harry
## 
### 
Two important sports events will be crowded into one afternoon!
tomorrow for the enjoyment of Stanford and Northern California sports
enthusiasts.
Coach "Dink" Templeton, the young and popular track coach of Stan
ford, is responsible for the first of the two events —the annual battle with i
California to decide the yearly supremacy on track and field. Templeton '
once upon a time attended the Olympic Games as the representative of the
United States in the high jump. It is very possible that it was there that,
he learned the value of high-class sport attractions, for ever since his
installation here in 1921 as track coach he has never failed to provide
quite an interesting time of it at the annual meeting with California —|
interesting to his older coaching rival at Berkeley as well as to all fans
in attendance. Somehow, in the last three years we have never come
away from a Big Meet disappointed for lack of thrills. Tomorrow should
prove no exception.
This vear of 1926 marks the sixth meeting of Walter Christie and
Robert L. Templeton as track coaches. Honors went to the former in
1921 and 1923, to the latter in 1924 and 1925, and the meet in 1922 ended
with the heart-breaking tie of 65 1-2 to 65 1-2. Victories being chalked
up at two apiece, tomorrow should break the tie in favor of one of the
two mentors. It is quite posible that we shall pull for Templeton.
The University is also beginning to look to another coach annually to j
give it something to think about in the line of surprises. Harry \\ olter j
and his Cardinal nine lost the smile of Miss Lady Luck last year in their
opening game of the California series and were snowed under by an j
avalanche of Blue and Gold runs. Her favor was regained, however,'
when they came back the under-dogs to win the second game, and followed
it with a victory in the third and deciding contest. Now comes Wolter
and his 1926 team to lose their first game (as thought it were a matter of
predestination), to win their second, and tomorrow we are told they are
favorites in the deciding game. - ,- r
If sports victories did not possess such changeable temperaments and
were possible to accurately forecast, we would lie tempted to accuse
Wolter of being a master sports-prmooter —he has so well kept us in (
suspense in the last two California series.
