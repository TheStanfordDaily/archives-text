A week-end of important sport events has rather silenced the oppo
nents and supporters of the recent ruling of the Executive Committee to
postpone the election of athletic team captains. The governing board's
action was nullified by a petition which was submitted at a meeting this
week. If, when the student body ballots Tuesday, the proposition receives
a majorit yof the votes cast, it will once more be placed with the by-laws
of the A.S.S.U.
The editor l>elieves that the new plan is a step forward, and that it
will work for the betterment of Stanford athletics. At the end of each
season of competition the team will select a captain who, it is safe to say,
will be the man who has contributed the most to the welfare of the squad.
To be elected captain under the new system will indeed be an honor.
Politics at this stage of the game will cause no dissension.
In practically every sport it is essential to have a field captain to confer
with the officials and the captain of the opposing team . If the coach is
allowed to choose this man, it gives leeway in forming the lineup and
makes a greater number of combinations possible.
The coaches, with the exception of Warner who remains neutral, have
agreed that the new plan will be the most satisfactory.
But all of these arguments, and more besides, have been previously
presented. The important thing is that everyone vote. I hose who ballot
in favor of the proposition should have no cause for regret.
A FEW ELEMENTARY STUNTS have been mapped out by the
Rally Committee for the track meet tomorrow. In order to make these
a success, it will be necessary for all students to don rooters caps and
white shirts, be present early, and co-operate to their utmost with the
yell leaders and ushers.
Alumni and othei*followers of the Cardinal atheltic teams have long
been impressed by Stanford's ability to stage bleacher stunts. Lets not
disappoint them!
