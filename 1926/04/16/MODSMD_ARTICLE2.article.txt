# ZETA PSI BEATEN BY JUNIPERO SERRA 5-4 IN CLOSE CONTEST
## Encina II Baseball Squad Swamped by Theta Chi In Hectic Game 
### 
Zeta Psi was edged out in yester
day's intramural play by Junipero
Serra Club in a tightly played game
which ended 5-4. Theta Chi completely
and absolutely swamped Encina II by
leaving them stranded at the little
end of a 20-1 score. Phi Sigma Kappa
likewise ran away with the D.U.'s,
gaining a headstart of eight runs in
the first inning and finishing strong to
the tune of 14-3. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
played Theta Xi to a no-run and al
most no-hit game which ended in favor
of the S.A.E. squad, 4-0.
The reputed prowess of Brock, Zete
pitcher, was not sufficient for keeping
Brady and Harold of the opposition
from scoring in the seventh and cop
ping the game. Cass completed the
battery for the defeated nine and
Harold and Scherer functioned in the
same capacity for the winning club
men. The play was quite close through
out, though constantly marred by
strikeouts on both sides.
Theta Chi-Encina
The Theta Chi-Encina II tilt was
just a succession of runs for Theta
Chi men and a bewildering series of
fan-outs for the hastily gathered fresh
man squad. The lone score for the
second-floor men was brought in by
Shapovalov in the second inning. Dice,
Adams, Hogle, and Sawyer figured
prominently in the scoring done by
the Theta Chi lineup.
Delta Upsilon made the sad mistake
of letting Phi Sigma Kappa get away
with eight runs in the very first in
ning, and so was unable to catch up
in the remaining six innings. The Phi
Sig squad seemed to be out for a
general round-robin of batting practice
as the eight runs were brought in by
as many different players. Two more
men crossed the home base in the
third, and four more in the seventh
completed the winning total of 14.
Crookshank, Abramson, and Manches
ter brought in the three tallies ac
credited to the D.U. score. Hawkins
and Bruce served as the Phi Sig bat
tery and Hill and Harvey as the Delta
Upsilon battery.
S.A.E.'s Win Game
Neither the S.A.E. nor the Theta Xi
was able to make a hit, let alone a
run, until the fourth inning of their
game. At that point the S.A.E.'s con
cluded it was high time to get going
and delegated the honor of bringing
in two runs to Laßue and Gibbons.
Bledsoe and Keye followed suit in
the fifth and sixth and brought the
final score up to four runs.
Teams meeting this afternoon are:

the Theta Chi lineup.
Delta Upsilon made the sad mistake
of letting Phi Sigma Kappa get away
with eight runs in the very first in
ning, and so was unable to catch up
in the remaining six innings. The Phi
Sig squad seemed to be out for a
general round-robin of batting practice
as the eight runs were brought in by
as many different players. Two more
men crossed the home base in the
third, and four more in the seventh
completed the winning total of 14.
Crookshank, Abramson, and Manches
ter brought in the three tallies ac
credited to the D.U. score. Hawkins
and Bruce served as the Phi Sig bat
tery and Hill and Harvey as the Delta
Upsilon battery.
S.A.E.'s Win Game
Neither the S.A.E. nor the Theta Xi
was able to make a hit, let alone a
run, until the fourth inning of their
game. At that point the S.A.E.'s con
cluded it was high time to get going
and delegated the honor of bringing
in two runs to Laßue and Gibbons.
Bledsoe and Keye followed suit in
the fifth and sixth and brought the
final score up to four runs.
Teams meeting this afternoon are:
Branner I-El Cuadro, Sigma Chi-Encina
111, Los Arcos-Sequoia 11, Kappa Alpha-
Kappa Sigma.
Zeta Psi was edged out in yester
day's intramural play by Junipero
Serra Club in a tightly played game
which ended 5-4. Theta Chi completely
and absolutely swamped Encina II by
leaving them stranded at the little
end of a 20-1 score. Phi Sigma Kappa
likewise ran away with the D.U.'s,
gaining a headstart of eight runs in
the first inning and finishing strong to
the tune of 14-3. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
played Theta Xi to a no-run and al
most no-hit game which ended in favor
of the S.A.E. squad, 4-0.
The reputed prowess of Brock, Zete
pitcher, was not sufficient for keeping
Brady and Harold of the opposition
from scoring in the seventh and cop
ping the game. Cass completed the
battery for the defeated nine and
Harold and Scherer functioned in the
same capacity for the winning club
men. The play was quite close through
out, though constantly marred by
strikeouts on both sides.
Theta Chi-Encina
The Theta Chi-Encina II tilt was
just a succession of runs for Theta
Chi men and a bewildering series of
fan-outs for the hastily gathered fresh
man squad. The lone score for the
second-floor men was brought in by
Shapovalov in the second inning. Dice,
Adams, Hogle, and Sawyer figured
prominently in the scoring done by
the Theta Chi lineup.
