# CABBAGES and THINGS
## LOOK WHAT WE GOT! 
### Steve O'Donnell 
This, ladies and gentlemen, is Drusilla Deadeye, the latest thing in
pledges. (We have omitted the pledge pin for fear that it might spoil the
picture.) When Drusilla was yet very young, she tried to improve the looks

of her eyelashes with a permanent wave machine.
The othei eye is covered with a wig because of
baldness.
Drusilla's figure may not be so hot, but she's an
awfully nice girl, and as you can observe, she is built
for both speed and powder.
When the sisters first saw Drusilla they thought
perhaps that they ought not to rush her because they
didn't want all the same type of girl in the house; but
after they had observed her from all angles they
realized that she was so picturesque that they just
couldn't resist her. (In fact, nobody can resist her.)
Drusilla's bawl-out record isn't so high because
she started college under a handicap, but she is a
marvelous dancer. You ought to see her do the St.
Louis. (But don't ever try to dance with her.) Dru
silla doesn't wear the eye-shade because she has to,
but only because it helps out her face by giving it a
sophisticated appearance. The sisters all just love her
to death.
Here you see her just as she looked on that
memorable evening, standing on the front porch, as
the sisters opened the door to welcome her into the
house.
(Editor's Note—We have purposely left out the
name of the sorority to which Exhibit A was pledged
because we want EVERYBODY to get laughed at.)

"Albert Webster received two wounds in the struggle. One was fatal, hut
his friends will be glad to hear that the second is not serious." (From a paper.)

Someone has suggested that music is more enjoyable if you listen to it
with your eyes shut. May we add that it is still more enjoyable if the people
sitting near you listen to it with their mouths shut?
