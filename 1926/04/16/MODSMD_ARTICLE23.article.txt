# SUNDAY WILL MARK ANNIVERSARY OF BIG QUAKE CATASTROPHE
## 
### 
Sunday will be the twentieth anni
j versary of the earthquake that dam
aged the University in 1906.
These shocks, the result of a move
ment along a geological fault in the
: Portola Valley, caused the death of a
student and damage to buildings of the
University estimated at $5,000,000. A
new library, which stood a short di«
tance from the location of the annual
j bonfires, still incomplete was entirely
ruined. The Memorial Church suffered
: the loss of its heavily tiled spire and
the destruction of the Mosaic "The Ser
mon on the Mount." The Art Museum
; suffered much damage, and the Memo
rial Arch at the of University
I Avenue destroyed beyond repair.
This great destruction of buildings
| was due to the fact that many of them
were built of stone and brick; those
which contained steel girders or were
' reinforced with steel wiring were prac
tically undamaged. It is this latter
j type of buildings which have since been
j constructed by the administration.
Sinclair Lewis visited the University
of Kansas recently and donated $100
to The Dove, an independent student
| publication. He said that the oppor
tunity for original expression was a
distinct need in the students' educa
i tion.
