Will Bill Kerr (right) be able to beat out Schwobeda in the mile, and will Erk Coverly (left)
be able to crash through with a place in the sprint events? These are the questions that are
puzzling the Stanford fans. Kerr has been successful in the early season meets, and his best
time this season is 4:26. Coverly has been improving all season and stands an excellent
chance tomorrow to prove his worth in the dashes.
