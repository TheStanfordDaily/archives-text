# Track Win Ends Successful Freshman Athletic Season
## 
### 
By Lynn Bramkamp
The defeat of the freshman nine at
the hands of the Blue and Gobi babes
completed the major and minor sports
year for the class of 1929. Out of the
five major sports, California won three,
namely, football, basketball, and base
ball. Tennis and track, the two re
maining, were the only sports in which
the Cardinal stars showed themselves
to be superior.
In the realm of minor sports, the
babes were more successful. They suf
fered their setbacks in soccer and golf,
winning in water polo and swimming.
All in all, the freshman Stanfordites
cleaning up in four out of nine sports.
Football was the first defeat in sev
eral years. The score was 14 to 0, and
the game was filled with a brand of
football far from excellent. Fumbles
and poor playing were much in evidence
during the contest. The California
squad was especially strong this year.
Lose Basketball
In basketball, the superiority of the
Blue and Gold men was undisputable,
since both contests went to California
by lopsided scores. The first game
ended with the taly 26 to 16. The sec
ond resulted In an even worse set-back
of 35 to 22. Next season, a new coach

I will succeed Hunt, whose absence will;
be keenly felt. It was due to his ability
as a coach that the freshmen did as well
as they did.
Baseball proved to be the poorest
showing of the sports. Few turned out 1
in the first place, and those that did
show up seemed to lack team fire and
spirit. Despite these obstacles, Coach i
Hunt developed a team which showed
i the California squad some little opposi
[ tion. The scores of the series games
J were not close.
Track a Success
Track was the crowning achievement
|of the 1929 class. Besides cleaning up
J in the majority of events, several poten
' tial varsity stars were uncovered. Rec-i
j ords of long standing were shattered
, by performances in the pole vault, dis
j cus, and shot. Since these positions are
j soon to be left vacant on the varsity, the
; freshmen stars will be valuable next
season. Future prospects for track
I squads advanced considerably because
; of this 1929 victory.
Of equal interest in future potentiali
ties was the clean cut win in tennis. Out
of all the matches, only one was lost.
Several good consistent players consti
tute the freshman team, and all will be
I needed additions to the next year's var-

' sity squad. California's showing in this
sport, as in track, is an almost-guaran
tee of future wins in both sports.
Minor Sports Close
In the minor sports, soccer developed

into a closc contest. In a game finish
ing with a 1 to 0 score, the California
squad carried off the honors. Golf was
a defeat for Stanford; water polo and
swimming were victories.
