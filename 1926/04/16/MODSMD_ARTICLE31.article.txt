# COACH WARNER NOT PESSIMISTIC ABOUT SHOWING OF TEAM
## 
### 
When a.sked how spring football
practice was going and what prospects
were for a good team next fall, Coach
Warner expressed satisfaction at the
interest the candidates are showing
and the goodly number who have been
taking the work, Practically all the
prominent football men who are not
training for track or baseball are re
porting regularly, and both the coaches
and the candidates are learning a
great amount of helpful material.
The players are getting experience
and learning the game, and the
coaches are getting wise to the most
likely looking players and are spend
ing a good deal of time in experiment
ing with new plays, a number of which
have proven worthwhile. Efforts are
being made to fill the shoes of Nevers,
and several likely prospects have
been lined up. Two or three men are
needed for the position, and this
spring's training will enable the
coaches to determine who's who so
that the others trying for the place
may be shifted back to their original
places.
Patchett at Full
"Patchett was Never's understudy
last fall, and is a good man, but it will
take more than one fullback to carry
the burden next fall, and the coaches
are trying to find the right man for
the place," said Warner in respect to
the prospects. Another position to plug
up is quarterback. Prominent among
the changes to fill this vacancy are
shifts of linesmen to the backfield
position, including the shift of Cap
tain Swan.
"There are a number of dark horses
who are showing considerable ability.
Some of the last year's freshmen
whom Coach Hunt thinks will make
the varsity men hustle for their places
are being watched, too," added Pop.
The prospects for a good team are
better this year than for several years
back, because of the very few who
were lost by graduation. The excellent
caliber of the material on hand to fill
the existing vacancies and the inter
est being shown by most of the candi
dates augers well for the fall season.
California Disappointment
"However," Coach Warner pointed
out, "things looked especially bright
at California last year, and the team
turned out to be a big disappointment;
therefore, it will not be wise for Stan
ford to bank too much upon what ap
pears like bright prospects."
"Only by hard work by both players
and coaches will the team be landed on
top because of the keen competition.
All the Conference teams seem to
liave bright prospects on their sides
for next fall," concluded the coach.
