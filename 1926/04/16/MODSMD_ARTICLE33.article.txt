Ted Miller, who holds the Stanford-Cali
fornia record of 49 1-10 in the quarter-mile
race, and who will defend his title in this
event tomorrow afternoon. Miller's running
this season would indicate that he will break
his own record when he meets California for
the last time this week end.
Miller won the Pacific Coast Conference j
440 last season, and has run the distance under
49 seconds several times. So far this season !
no runner has come within yards of him ex J
cept his own team mate, Storie.
In his freshman year Miller was a sprinter,
and not a very good one at that. He placed
in the Little Big Meet but that was all. Tem
pleton saw possibilities in him after the Irish j
Marathon in his sophomore year. He was
turned into a quarter-miler and he won this
event in the Big Meet that year.
