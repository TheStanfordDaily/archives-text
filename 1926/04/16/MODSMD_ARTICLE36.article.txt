# TRACK, BASEBALL VICTORY WILL GIVE CARDS FOUR OF FIVE MAJOR SPORT WINS
## 
### 
Victories in baseball anil track tomorrow will give Stanford a
record of four out of five of the major sports this year. Since dope
has it that the track squad has a good chance, and the baseball nine
an even break, with a good chance to come through, the possibilities
for a four out of five season loom extremely bright.
Records for the past season of both major and minor sports show
a rather varied result. Final results for major sports cannot be
compiled at present, because both track and baseball have yet to
finish their season.
Of those sports past, football and tennis have registered more or
less successful seasons, culminted by the desired endâ€”victories over
California. Basketball season was unsuccessful, since not only were
several early games lost, but the California series ended disastrously
for the team, with two straight defeats.
Among the minor sports, soccer, swimming, water polo, boxing,
and fencing chalked up "O.K. against their names for the past
season. Gym was the only sport losing to California in minor sports
competition.
Win in Football
Football was the biggest success in years because of the long
coveted victory ovet California. Entering the game slightly the
under dogs, Stanford started with a bang, and piled up a score of
20-0 in the first half. Although the Bears came back with two
touchdowns, no serious troubles were found and the final score read
27-14 for the Cardinal. This defeat was the first over the famous
wonder-teams, developed by the late Andy Smith, since 1905.
Washington proved the stumbling stone in the race for the P.C.C.
title. The Huskies opened up with some powerful football, and finally
crushed the fighting Cardinal 13-0, after Captain Severs had taken
the worst beating of his caceer. The only other defeat was sustained
in the pre-season game with the Olympic Club. U.S.C. was defeated
in a surprise game by the close score of 13-9. Stanford placed second
in the P.C.C. ratings.
The next major sport in order was basketball. The season was
poor throughout, Stanford losing many contests, notably against
Southern Branch, Nevada, and California. In the Bear series, the
first game was closely contested, a goal in the last minute giving the
California squad the call over their opponents to the tune of 18 to 17.
The second game was not so satisfactroy ,isnce the score was lopsided.
This contest was lost 24-16.
Andy Kerr Leaves
Since the close of the season. Coach Kerr has accepted a position
as coach in the east. Coach Husky Hunt, of the freshman teams,
will take his place. Hunt's system is known to the players, and his
ability is recognized. Much is expected of him next season.
Tennis followed with a four out of five match victory for the
Cardinal, the only defeat being that of Cranston Holman by Bud
Chandler of California. These players, both famed in national tennis,
have been opponents during several seasons of competition, and the
result was a thing of conjecture until the match was finished.
Since baseball and track are still hanging in the balance, the result
of the major sport season is not available. With prospects cheerful
for a victory in track, and with an even break in baseball, it would
seem that the Stanford major sports have acquitted themselves with
glory this season. The record is two out of three, with a possible
four out of five.
Minor Sport Season
In the minor sports, soccer looms as one of the important vic
tories. The soccer squad, due to the feat of winning one and tying
one game, came into permanent possession of the Pellas trophy; this
trophy has been won by six victories, two ties, and only two defeats
out of five years of competition.
Of equal importance were the results of the swimming season.
