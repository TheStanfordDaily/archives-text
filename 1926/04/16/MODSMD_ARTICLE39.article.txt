# CAMPUS STATION WILL BE BUILT FOR SEISMOLOGY

"When it is realized that the East
Ay cities alone expended $59,000,000 in
lilding in 1925, and that probably 90
(•r cent of those buildings were put up
(Without any consideration of earthquake
risk to which they must inevitably be
subjected, we can understand why it is
important to learn all we can regarding
earthquakes and to educate the public in
self-protection," said IJr. Bailey Willis
iu an interview on the seismology station
soon to be erected at Stanford University.
This station, which will be in process
of construction during the summer, will
be one of four, to be situated at Stanford,
the University of California, Gblden
(iate Park, and Lick Observatory at
Mount Hamilton. Money for the upkeep
of the stations will be subscribed by
Stanford, the University of California,
and the California Academy of Sciencies.

When the idea was suggested by scien
tists of the region led by Dr. Bailey
Willis, noted seismologist from Stan
ford, the necessary funds, totaling several
thousands of dollars, were solicited from
business men of the Bay region. At the
present time, $22,000 is on deposit in San
Francisco, the amount being subscribed
mainly by insurance companies, bankers,
public utility companies and others whose
capital is going into enormous expansion
of the metropolitan district around San
Francisco Bay.
The selection and installation of the
stations has been placed in the hands of
a committee of the Seismological Society
of which Dr. Willis is chairman, and the
personnel of which includes Professor
Perry Byerly, seismologist of the Uni
versity of California; J. K. Moffitt, bank
er of San Francisco, and treasurer of
the fund; Henry Dewell, structural engi
neer; and Dr. H. O. Wood, of the Car
negie Institute in New York, who is one
of the inventors of the seismograph, the
instrument which records the micro-tre
mors.
Sites Chosen Soon
An order for instruments will shortly
be placed, and sites are to be selected for
the appropriate buildings at Stanford, the
University of California, and (joldcn
(iate Park. It is hoped that construction
and installation may be accomplished dur
ing the early summer so that by next
autumn there shall be in operation around
San Francisco Bay a complete system of
stations which will record every micro
scopic tremor within range, which may
occur in the metropolitan region.
One of the citizens when approached
declared that lie was in favor of it, and
subscribed a sum of $5500, enough to out
tit one complete station. He is the head
of a large business firm in Oakland.
Stations of this kind are in process of
construction at Pasadena, Riverside, La
Jolla, and Catalina Island in the South.
Several tremors have been recorded, and
the apparatus has been proved satisfac
tory.

When the idea was suggested by scien
tists of the region led by Dr. Bailey
Willis, noted seismologist from Stan
ford, the necessary funds, totaling several
thousands of dollars, were solicited from
business men of the Bay region. At the
present time, $22,000 is on deposit in San
Francisco, the amount being subscribed
mainly by insurance companies, bankers,
public utility companies and others whose
capital is going into enormous expansion
of the metropolitan district around San
Francisco Bay.
The selection and installation of the
stations has been placed in the hands of
a committee of the Seismological Society
of which Dr. Willis is chairman, and the
personnel of which includes Professor
Perry Byerly, seismologist of the Uni
versity of California; J. K. Moffitt, bank
er of San Francisco, and treasurer of
the fund; Henry Dewell, structural engi
neer; and Dr. H. O. Wood, of the Car
negie Institute in New York, who is one
of the inventors of the seismograph, the
instrument which records the micro-tre
mors.
Sites Chosen Soon
An order for instruments will shortly
be placed, and sites are to be selected for
the appropriate buildings at Stanford, the
University of California, and (joldcn
(iate Park. It is hoped that construction
and installation may be accomplished dur
ing the early summer so that by next
autumn there shall be in operation around
San Francisco Bay a complete system of
stations which will record every micro
scopic tremor within range, which may
occur in the metropolitan region.
One of the citizens when approached
declared that lie was in favor of it, and
subscribed a sum of $5500, enough to out
tit one complete station. He is the head
of a large business firm in Oakland.
Stations of this kind are in process of
construction at Pasadena, Riverside, La
Jolla, and Catalina Island in the South.
Several tremors have been recorded, and
the apparatus has been proved satisfac
tory.
"When it is realized that the East
Ay cities alone expended $59,000,000 in
lilding in 1925, and that probably 90
(•r cent of those buildings were put up
(Without any consideration of earthquake
risk to which they must inevitably be
subjected, we can understand why it is
important to learn all we can regarding
earthquakes and to educate the public in
self-protection," said IJr. Bailey Willis
iu an interview on the seismology station
soon to be erected at Stanford University.
This station, which will be in process
of construction during the summer, will
be one of four, to be situated at Stanford,
the University of California, Gblden
(iate Park, and Lick Observatory at
Mount Hamilton. Money for the upkeep
of the stations will be subscribed by
