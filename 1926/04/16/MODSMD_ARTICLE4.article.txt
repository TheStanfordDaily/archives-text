# HYLAND, MEEKS TO COMPETE IN MEET DESPITE INJURIES
## 
### 
Rumors circulating around the
Stanford campus concerning the
probable absence of Dick Hyland
and Sid Meeks from competition
in the Big Meet have caused no
little amount of worry on the
part of Stanford track enthusi
asts. It was definitely reported
this morning following a doctor's
examination, that both men would
be able to enter the Big Meet.
Hyland pulled a muscle in his
leg last Wednesday while prac
ticing starts. It was feared for a
time that the muscle would be
too sore to allow him to run, but
the bruised member has come
around in good shape so that it
will give the Cardinal sprint star
little trouble tomorrow.
Meeks was forced out of the
Oregon meet last Saturday be
cause of illness. Three days in
the hospital and a big rest this
week have restored the stellar
Stanford broad-jumper to his for
mer good condition.
