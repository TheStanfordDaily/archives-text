						"Biff" May Mean Much in the Final Score of the Meet
## 
### 
Biff Hoffman, the Cardinal shot-put and
discus star, will oppose Gerkin of Cali
fornia tomorrow in what promises to be
a closely contested duel. Gerkin has a
reputation for crashing-through when in
competition, while Hoffman is known to
throw the discus consistently around 145
feet and the shot around 48 feet. Last
year at the National Collegiate Asso
ciation track meet at Stagg Field, Chi
cago, Hoffman surprised the fans by
beating the field in the discus throw. In
winning the event Hoffman nosed out
his team mate Hartranft, who at that
time held the world's record
in the discus.
