## 
### 
"For the Stanford Y.M.C.A. the year
1925-26 has hecn a season of transition
and of experiment and study of the his
tory of it," says William Leslie Gosslin,
president of the local chapter, in his an
nual report to the board of directors.
"This year marked the inauguration of
a new general secretary, Rex Bell, and j
especially of a new type of work and |
a new type of viewpoint toward the !
Y.M.C.A. on the Stanford campus," he I
continues. "It was understood hy all J
that in coming to the campus Bell was |
to work as an adviser of the students in I
Y.M.C.A. in their attempt to put over a
program which they themselves had origi- !
nated and were about to launch."
Gosslin tells of the aims of the "Y" at j
the beginning of the year, and of the j
work that has been done toward the i
fulfillment ol these aims. He describes j
the work of the boys' work committee, j
which has met with such signal success, i
of the distribution of freshman hand
books, the holding of a poll on the World j
Court, and the continuance of a survey j
by a special committee of the cabinet to j
discover the place of the Y.M.C.A. and i
the work it should do.
In conclusion, he states, "The past year
has been a year of adjustment to campus j
problems and to a new situation. It has j
also been a year of experiment and of !
plans for the future. In this period the
"Y" has made strenuous efforts to find
its place on the Stanford campus, a place
which is based on a real need, and upon
the understanding of the problems which
are facing Stanford students. We feel
that the outlook is very hopeful under the
able leadership which has been secured
for the coming year, and we trust that i
the influence of the Y.M.C.A. on the j
campus will continue to be one of slow,
steady, and carefully prepared growth." j
