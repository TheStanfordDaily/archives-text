# WALTER CHRISTIE HAS COACHED TRACK FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
## 
### 
Walter Christie, coach of the Univer
sity of California track team, which
meets the Stanford squad in the lattcr's
stadium tomorrow will bring his
twenty-fifth year of service to a close.
"The Father of California's Coaches,"
as he is called in the Northern institu
tion, did not commence his athlctic
career in college. As was common for
exceptional athletes a generation ago,
lie ran professionally at various meets,
picnics, and carnivals. During this
time Christie held a record in every
track and field event on the list except
in the pole vault.
As coach at Cornel! and Annapolis,
where he was located before coming to
Berkeley, Walt not only increased his
reputation as an expert track and field
coach, but was especially conspicuous
for his popularity among the students.
While the Cardinals have continued
to win a slight majority of the meets
since he came to California in 1901, the
margin of victory has always been
small. Christie has large numbers of
friends both at Berkeley and among
athletes all along the Coast. This is
due to his practice of visiting the var
ious high schools of the state and in
structing the athletes in the finer points
of athletics regardless of the fact that
many of the boys do not plan to enter
California.
No higher honor could have been
paid Christie than his appointment to
the position of head field coach for the
United States Olympic team which won
the 1924 championships at Paris.
