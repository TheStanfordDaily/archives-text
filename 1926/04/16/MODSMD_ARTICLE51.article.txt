# SPORTS OF 1926
## Among the Southpaws 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Is 1926 going to be a southpaw year? Already a left-handed boxer has
become the world's middleweight champion, but Eduoard Horemans, of Bel
gium, the port-sided billiard champion, lost his world's 18.2 title in January to
Jake Scliaefer, who has since lost it to Eric Hagenlaeher. Will the disciples
of Leonardo da Vinci, Marshal Foch, and Charley Chaplin (to mention three
famous left-handers) rule their more orthodox brethren during the great out
door sports season which is just getting under way, or will the majority rule?
The latest fistic sensation is a southpaw. "Shuffle" Callahan, a Chicago
furniture #iover, who would like to move that expensive piece of bric-a-brac
known as the world's welterweight crown from Mickey Walker's dome.
"Shuffle" recently dealt a quick K.O. to Bobby Barrett, and before that con
quered tough Morrie Schlaeffer and Johnny Mendelsohn.
Besides Tiger Flowers, there have been two other middleweight champions
who were left-handed fighters, A1 McCoy and Johnny Wilson, both of the
cheese variety. Lew Tendler, Dode Bercot, Larry Estridge, and Jerry Jerome
are some others who come to mind.
Polo has its Watson Webb; football had Sam Felton, the greatest left
footed kicker; but the best southpaw among both golfers and tennis players
is Norman Brookes, the 48-year-old Austrian wizard. Few left-handed links
stars have ever amounted to much, although Fritz Martin was once champion
of Canada. Tennis, however, boasts of many great portsiders besides Brookes,
among them being Robert Wrenn, four times U.S. national singles champion;
Beals Wright, champion in 1905; my brother, R. Lindley Murray, champion in
1917 and '18; Dwiglit Davis, Howard Voehell, Walter Westbrook, Carl FischeT,
Wallace Scott, and Ray Casey; and Washer, of Belgium; Kumagae, of Japan;
and Hawkes, of Australia.
In baseball, the southpaw pitcher is much desired in spite of the eccentrici
ties that are supposed to accompany such a "state of mind." Elongated Eppa
Rixey of the "Reds" is looked upon as the leading left-hander in the majors
today, and no other portsider can equal his record of averaging twenty wins a
year for the last five years. Three famous southpaws, Dutch Leonard, Rube
Marquard, and Dave Danforth, have passed from the majors, but there remain
fifty or sixty to carry on, among Ihem being Bill Sherdel, of the Cardinals; who
led all the National League pitchers in percentage of games won and lost.
