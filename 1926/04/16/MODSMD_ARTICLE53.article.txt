# TEMPLETON, CHRISTIE VIE FOR SIXTH TIME
## 
### 
When "Diuk" Templeton's Cardinals
meet Walter Christie's University of
California track team in the Stadium
tomorrow, it will be the sixth clash |
between these old rivals and will set
tle the dispute as to the winner of j

] the majority of the contests.
California and Stanford both claim
two victories since Diuk took over
i the Redshirts in 1921. In his first
year of service the Bears swamped
I the Cardinals 85% to 45%. 1923 was
a bad year for Templeton as his squad
j had been unwisely given a slight edge
i over their opponents, but, when they
j were only able to garner 3% points

in the field events they fell before an
82% to 48% surprise.
Dink came back strong the following
year upsetting California by a slightly
greater score. Last year was the great
est meet of all when Richardson
running next to last man on the relay
team overtook Boyden winning the lap
and with it the meet. The score was
66% to 64%. In 1922 Templeton's

squad sprung a surprise ly holding
Christie's outfit to a tie.
Dink was responsible for tb> victory
in the summer of 1920 of the Anerican
Olympic Rugby team over theitFrench
opponents when his 45-yard dhp-kick
won the championship. He als qual
ified for the broad jump on the ")lym
pic team. Here he was under Vulter
Christie, who coached the field evnts.
