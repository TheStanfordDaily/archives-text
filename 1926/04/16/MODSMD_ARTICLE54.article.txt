# WOMEN TRACKSTERS BEGIN SEASON WITH LARGE REGISTRATION
## Sophomores, Seniors Will Enter Veteran Teams; 1929 Promising 
### 
. With forty-seven reporting for prac
tice, Stanford's women's track season
opened this quarter with the largest
registration since the sport was in
troduced here.
Practices are being held twice a
week in preparation for the class
meets to be held later in the season
and the culminating event of the sea
son, the interclass meet on Field Day,
May 29.
Many freshmen give promise of star
ling on Field Day, and though they
may make many points for their class
they will have strong competition from
the veterans of last season. Of the
classes who have competed before, the
juniors have the strongest team, hav
ing won the interclass championship
for the last two years.
Seniors Weak
The sophomores will make a bid for
honors but the seniors have little
chance to be in the real competition
as many of their former stars have not
reported this year. Lois Hopper, who
has returned to college this quarter,
will bolster up the senior team, with
her almost certain first in the shot put,
and her hurdling.
Mate Gonsulus is the most promising
of the 1929 track candidates. In prac
tice she has shown herself to be among
the best of the sprinters. Marion
Klocksen, Ruth Lansburgh, and Matie
McLaren are other freshmen sprint
ers doing well.
Grace Adams, a newcomer, should
strengthen the sophomores chances in
the 50 and 75 yard dashes. Helen
Lease, Dorothy Cone, and Dorothy
Fordyce, last year's 1928 sprinters
should come through again this year.
Junior vs. Frosh
The juniors look to be the best
bets again for the championship unless
the freshmen unearth a lot of remark
able performers. With the return of
some good material the juniors
have unusual strength. The loss of
some of their best athletes though
makes the coming meet less of-a sure
thing than it was last year.
Three of last year's 1927 track ath
letes have not reported this season.
Bernice Chase, captain and winner of
the 50-yard dash last year, Marie Man
chee, high jpnip and basketball throw
ing champion and hurdler, and Frances
Gooden, winner of the low hurdles are
lost to the junior team. Mancliee made
thirteen points for her class.
Nellie Shepherd, the juniors' main
stay in the 75-yard dash which she won
last year, should have support in the
sprints from Barbara Dewlaney, who
is out for the first time this year.
Shepherd also broad jumps. Lucille
Burlingame should also be a point win
ner in the 75-vard dash, hurdles, and
baseball throw.
High Jumpers
In the high jump Matie McLaren '29,
and Elizabeth Bakewell '28, are the
only outstanding candidates.
Clara Weatherwax '29, Helen Lease
'2S, Katherine Applegate '27, and Al
berta Williamson '27, should compete
for places in the shot-put though Lois
Hopper should win this event, as she
heaves the.shot far beyond the marks
of the others.
Neither the baseball or basketball
throw for distance has been started
yet this year and so the freshmen
possibilities in these events is not
known. Of the other classes Helen
Lease '28, Lucille Burlingame '27,
Astrid Arnoldson '27 and Lois Hop
per '20 will be among the foremost
competitors.

her almost certain first in the shot put,
and her hurdling.
Mate Gonsulus is the most promising
of the 1929 track candidates. In prac
tice she has shown herself to be among
the best of the sprinters. Marion
Klocksen, Ruth Lansburgh, and Matie
McLaren are other freshmen sprint
ers doing well.
Grace Adams, a newcomer, should
strengthen the sophomores chances in
the 50 and 75 yard dashes. Helen
Lease, Dorothy Cone, and Dorothy
Fordyce, last year's 1928 sprinters
should come through again this year.
Junior vs. Frosh
The juniors look to be the best
bets again for the championship unless
the freshmen unearth a lot of remark
able performers. With the return of
some good material the juniors
have unusual strength. The loss of
some of their best athletes though
makes the coming meet less of-a sure
thing than it was last year.
Three of last year's 1927 track ath
letes have not reported this season.
Bernice Chase, captain and winner of
the 50-yard dash last year, Marie Man
chee, high jpnip and basketball throw
ing champion and hurdler, and Frances
Gooden, winner of the low hurdles are
lost to the junior team. Mancliee made
thirteen points for her class.
Nellie Shepherd, the juniors' main
stay in the 75-yard dash which she won
last year, should have support in the
sprints from Barbara Dewlaney, who
is out for the first time this year.
Shepherd also broad jumps. Lucille
Burlingame should also be a point win
ner in the 75-vard dash, hurdles, and
baseball throw.
High Jumpers
In the high jump Matie McLaren '29,
and Elizabeth Bakewell '28, are the
only outstanding candidates.
Clara Weatherwax '29, Helen Lease
'2S, Katherine Applegate '27, and Al
berta Williamson '27, should compete
for places in the shot-put though Lois
Hopper should win this event, as she
heaves the.shot far beyond the marks
of the others.
Neither the baseball or basketball
throw for distance has been started
yet this year and so the freshmen
possibilities in these events is not
known. Of the other classes Helen
Lease '28, Lucille Burlingame '27,
Astrid Arnoldson '27 and Lois Hop
per '20 will be among the foremost
competitors.
. With forty-seven reporting for prac
tice, Stanford's women's track season
opened this quarter with the largest
registration since the sport was in
troduced here.
Practices are being held twice a
week in preparation for the class
meets to be held later in the season
and the culminating event of the sea
son, the interclass meet on Field Day,
May 29.
Many freshmen give promise of star
ling on Field Day, and though they
may make many points for their class
they will have strong competition from
the veterans of last season. Of the
classes who have competed before, the
juniors have the strongest team, hav
ing won the interclass championship
for the last two years.
Seniors Weak
The sophomores will make a bid for
honors but the seniors have little
chance to be in the real competition
as many of their former stars have not
reported this year. Lois Hopper, who
has returned to college this quarter,
will bolster up the senior team, with
her almost certain first in the shot put,
and her hurdling.
