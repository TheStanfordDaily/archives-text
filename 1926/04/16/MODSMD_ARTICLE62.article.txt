# SUNKEN DIAMOND TO BECOME BEST COAST COLLEGE BALL FIELD
## 
### 
Stanford's sunken baseball diamond
will be turned into one of the best fields
"on the Pacific Coast when sufficient
funds become available to place grand
stands in the bowl.
The new diamond is located between
the present varsity field and the high
way polo field near the end of the stad
ium. This excavation is the result of
enlarging the stadium year when it
was necessary to take the earth from
there to build up the sides.
Measuring 430 feet square at the sur
face and with an averag depth of nine
feet the excavation will have sufficient
room for a baseball diamond. Plans
are available for grandstands, pits, and
other improvements necessary to a
good varsity diamond. As yet sufficient
funds have not been obtained and un
til then operations will be held up.
The field is now being used for fresh
man practice, and other teams that need
a good field with no improvements.
