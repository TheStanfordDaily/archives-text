# WOMEN'S SWIMMING SEASON OPENS WITH TITLE CHANCES EVEN
## Juniors Favored to Repeat Victory of Last Two Interclass Meets 
### 
With the freshmen looming up as
strong contenders for the interclass
title, the women's swimming season
i has gotten away to a good start under
! Coach Greta J. Brandsten. Early sea
i son practice points to a close inter
class meet with the probability of the
seniors and sophomores being in the
running for high-point honors.
No class has a distinct advantage,
though, and the meet will depend
largely on the way some of the swim
mers develop. The juniors have indi
vidual stars who may collect enough
I points for their class to win, though
they haven't the place-winners of the
other classes. The sophomores stand
a good chance of repeating their win
of last year, even though they are
without some of their stars.
Madeline Prick, '28, individual swim
i ming champion of last year, and Ade-
I laide Kelly, '26, the same for the year
j before should battle for honors. Clarita
Hunsberger, '27, should also gather a
good many points for her class, being
conceded a first in diving and a place
in the sprints.
Free Style Is Close
The 25-yard free style should be
quite close with Adelaide Kelly, '26,
Clarita Hunsberger, '27, Jean Wake
field, '28, Lida Rittler, '28, Rosalife
Walters, '29, and Martha Blackwelder,
'29, fighting for a win.
In the 50- and 75-yard free style the
freshmen are particularly strong with
Barbara Frick, Mary Barstow, Jean
Armes, and Lorraine Reeder swim
ming in these events. Madeline Frick.
last year's winner of the 75, and Lucia
Champlin will be the sophomores' best
entries. Lucille Burlingame, '27, and
i Cecile Feusier, '26, are also swimming
j in these events.
1928 Lost Strength
The sophomores have lost their
strength in the backstroke with the
failure of Margery Blackwelder to re-
I port this quarter. Parney Storey will

try to take her place for the sopho
mores. The juniors' best entry is Dor
othy Webster, while the seniors have
two good backstrokers in Cecile Feu
sier and Florence Stanley. The fresh
men are still unknown quantities in
this event.
There are more than the usual num
ber of aspirants for breaststroke posi
tions this year. Lois Hopper, '26, Milli
son Hardy, '26, and Jean Wakefield,
'28, are among the most likely to make
points in the class meets.
Sophomores will be strong in the
plunge with Madeline Frick, who won
the event last year, Cecily Morse, who
placed, and Frances Clancy out to
place. Sally Miller, '29, and Lucille
Burlingame, *27, will also be entered
in the plunge.
Many Divers
Mrs. Brandsten has many diving as
pirants, led by Clarita Hunsberger, '27,
who won the event last year and is
considered the best woman diver in
this part of the country. Doris Swayze
.and Alida Israel will dive for the
seniors, the sophomores entering Ce
cily Morse and Lida Rittler. The
freshmen have three good divers in
Helen van Loben Sels, Chesterlyn
Thomas, and Rosalie Walters.
With Ruth Vredenburgh, '26, and
Betty Williams, '27, not out for the
team this season, the seniors and jun
iors lose two of their consistent point
winners. Ruth Vrendenburgh swam the
50-yard freestyle while Betty Williams
placed last year in the 50, backstroke,
and diving.
