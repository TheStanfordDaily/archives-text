# CAMPUS ORIGINALLY WAS PRIVATE FARM OF STANFORD FAMILY
## 
### 
The Stanford "farm" ha# been glori-1
ficd in undergraduate verse, and sports
writers, but it still remains a vague
term to most people. It seems contrary
that the Stanford ranch which was fa
mous for its fine horses should now be
constantly referred to as the "faim."'
The Stanford lands themselves were
not the remains of an old Spanish grant 1
but a consolidation of a number of I
small farms, and the land now con- i
sisting the campus proper was devoted
to the cultivation of alfalfa. The ranch j
itself was organized in four depart-1
ments: the Trotting Horse Department, I
the Running Horse Department, the i
Farming Department, and the House
and Grounds.
The Stanford home was the building
now occupied by the Stanford unit of
the Convalescent Home. There were
gardens and green yards about this. A
road lined with walnut and eucalyptus
trees led from the house through the
heart of the ranch to the trotting farm.
This road is now used under the name
of Governor's avenue, and is remark
able chiefly as a walk for queeners.
Carrot fields were laid out on cither
side of this road, the product of which
was used for the stock. Cornfields,
vineyards, and alfalfa were grown on
the easy drainage slope from Lagunita,
which was used as a reservoir for irri
gation purposes.
The grounds near the Stanford home
were planted with trees of many varie

ties. It was Senator Stanford's ambi
toon to have represented there ex
amples of every species that could be
grown in this climate. The evidence of
this cultivation is now the arboretum.
In the endowment grant the land oc
cupied by campus was referred to as the
"Palo AJto Farm." The place where
the buildings Were to be laid out was
designated thus: "The Trustees shall
select and lay off on the Palo Alto farm
a site and adopt a general plan for
buildings that will be plain and substan
tial in character and extensive enough
to provide accommodations for the
University."
