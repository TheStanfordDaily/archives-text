# GLEE CLUB STAGES HOME CONCERT IN HALL THIS EVENING
## Max Dolin, Harry Robertson Will Entertain Campus Music Lovers 
### 
Tonight in the Assembly hall the
musical "Big Meet" of the year will
be presented by the Stanford Glee
Club in its annual Home Concert in
which the fruit of a successful season
of singing will be offered to the cam
pus and to returning alumni.
Prominent musicians will take part
as the guest artists of the club. They
are Max Dolin, popular San Francisco
violinist and one of the chief attrac
tions of the California Theater's pro
grams, and Harry Robertson, well
known tenor, a former Stanford man.
Allen Will Tour
Warren D. Allen, director of the
Glee Club, will be making his last ap
pearance as leader for several montlis
for he is taking a tour of this country
and Europe during the coming sum
mer on which he will give many organ
recitals both in the United States a* 1,
on the Kuropean continent. One of the
most important objects of his trip will
be making engagements for a Euro
pean tour of the Slee Club next year.
The singers under Allen's supervi
sion have prepared one of the most
attractive programs they have ever
offered. The four vocal groups are no
tably well balanced, containing the
pick of classical, romantic, modern,
and humorous music.
The most notable selection to be
sung by the club will be "Dirge for
Two Veterans" by Gustav Hoist, a
work absolutely new to the West and
being given its premier performance
tonight. It is a setting of the great
poem by Walt Whitman and contains
choral effects that are radically daring
and gripping. A special accompaniment
|of brass instruments has been ar- >
: ranged by Mr. Allen in order to bring |
out the full realism and intense pathos |
of the passages descriptive of the
gruesome horrors of war.
Is Foremost Musician
Gustav Hoist is one of the foremost
of England's newer musicians. In this 1
work, written soon after the close of j
the war, he has put all the genuine
misery and hopelessness of the terrible i
struggle, in contrast with the usual
type of war song with its artificial
and romantic ferver. According to
those who have heard it in prepara
-1 tion, "Dirge for Two Veterans" is one
of the most profoundly moving choral
numbers ever written. Its rendition by |
j the club will be a musical event of
i importance.
j Opening the program is the rollick- j
ingly vigorous "Salterelle" by Saint
i Saens, a very ambitious work because !
of the many amazing vocal effects, j
The Stanford Glee Club has been noted 1
| for its interpretations of Palestrina's !
i great hymns, "Adoramus Te" and "Im- j
properia," being the most exalted i
1 works bv this great writer of religious 1
I music. The Finale from "The Gondo
liers," by Gilbert and Sullivan's popu- J
lar comic opera, will be the real finale ]
of the program.
With Max Dolin will come his fam- j
ous California Trio, composed of
cello, violin, and piano. They will plav
; Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody" and a
Spanish Tango Dance. Dolin himself j
will give his distinctive interpretations |
of some of the most popular light num- ,
I bors including selections from "The j
i Student Prince" and "Indian Love 1
1
| Call" from "Rose Marie," in response
I to requests. Dolin's tone is rich and 1
j vibrant; his interpretations are grace-!
! ful and charming.

Warren D. Allen, director of the
Glee Club, will be making his last ap
pearance as leader for several montlis
for he is taking a tour of this country
and Europe during the coming sum
mer on which he will give many organ
recitals both in the United States a* 1,
on the Kuropean continent. One of the
most important objects of his trip will
be making engagements for a Euro
pean tour of the Slee Club next year.
The singers under Allen's supervi
sion have prepared one of the most
attractive programs they have ever
offered. The four vocal groups are no
tably well balanced, containing the
pick of classical, romantic, modern,
and humorous music.
The most notable selection to be
sung by the club will be "Dirge for
Two Veterans" by Gustav Hoist, a
work absolutely new to the West and
being given its premier performance
tonight. It is a setting of the great
poem by Walt Whitman and contains
choral effects that are radically daring
and gripping. A special accompaniment
|of brass instruments has been ar- >
: ranged by Mr. Allen in order to bring |
out the full realism and intense pathos |
of the passages descriptive of the
gruesome horrors of war.
Is Foremost Musician
Gustav Hoist is one of the foremost
of England's newer musicians. In this 1
work, written soon after the close of j
the war, he has put all the genuine
misery and hopelessness of the terrible i
struggle, in contrast with the usual
type of war song with its artificial
and romantic ferver. According to
those who have heard it in prepara
-1 tion, "Dirge for Two Veterans" is one
of the most profoundly moving choral
numbers ever written. Its rendition by |
j the club will be a musical event of
i importance.
j Opening the program is the rollick- j
ingly vigorous "Salterelle" by Saint
i Saens, a very ambitious work because !
of the many amazing vocal effects, j
The Stanford Glee Club has been noted 1
| for its interpretations of Palestrina's !
i great hymns, "Adoramus Te" and "Im- j
properia," being the most exalted i
1 works bv this great writer of religious 1
I music. The Finale from "The Gondo
liers," by Gilbert and Sullivan's popu- J
lar comic opera, will be the real finale ]
of the program.
With Max Dolin will come his fam- j
ous California Trio, composed of
cello, violin, and piano. They will plav
; Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody" and a
Spanish Tango Dance. Dolin himself j
will give his distinctive interpretations |
of some of the most popular light num- ,
I bors including selections from "The j
i Student Prince" and "Indian Love 1
1
| Call" from "Rose Marie," in response
I to requests. Dolin's tone is rich and 1
j vibrant; his interpretations are grace-!
! ful and charming.
Tonight in the Assembly hall the
musical "Big Meet" of the year will
be presented by the Stanford Glee
Club in its annual Home Concert in
which the fruit of a successful season
of singing will be offered to the cam
pus and to returning alumni.
Prominent musicians will take part
as the guest artists of the club. They
are Max Dolin, popular San Francisco
violinist and one of the chief attrac
tions of the California Theater's pro
grams, and Harry Robertson, well
known tenor, a former Stanford man.
