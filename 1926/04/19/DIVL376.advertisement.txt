The Indispensable Walking Shoe
is shown at Thoits in several
smart versions
Whether you wish the severely tail
ored oxford or a strap or step-in
pump—or yet a still more feminine
style—the D'Orsay pump, you'll find
variety here. Since so many sum
mer hours are spent outside, such
shoes as these are truly indispens
ible.
The model illustrated is in white kid
without trim, and is priced at $8.50.
