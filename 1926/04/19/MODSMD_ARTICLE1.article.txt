# BEARS DEFEAT VARSITY NINE IN FINAL GAME
## California Sluggers Prove Too Much for Cardinal Pitching Staff NOUNAN SHOWS CLASS Single Tally Brought in by Busch as Bruin Third Baseman Misses 
### Herb Klein 
Inability of the Stanford varsity ball
players to make connections with the
brand of twirling delivered by Nounan,
California's pitching ace, gave the
Bears the third game, and with it the
annual series by a score of 5 to 1 last
Saturday on the varsity diamond. The
Bruin tosser, in his last intercollegiate
game, proved himself the best of Carl
Zamloch's pitching staff by allowing
the Cards only two hits, neither of
which contributed towards a run.
While Harry Wolter's men were
vainly trying to get hits, the California
sluggers were knocking out long, low
drives that the Stanford infield had a
hard time stopping. Seven hits were
credited to the Bears, five off Steve
Collins, who was in the box until the
end of the fifth inning, and two from
"Count" Sobieski who finished the last
four innings. The Bears made runs in
every inning in which hits were ob
tained.
U.C. Scores First
Berkeley drew first blood with a
run in inning number one. Their third
baseman, Tait, made a single, stole
second base, and was sent across the
plate by a long sacrifice fly made by
Jimmy Dixon. Stanford's lone tally
came in the next inning. Lloynd, the
Bear pitcher, kicked a bunt by Busch,
who reached first, was sent around the
bases on a wild throw, and came home
on an error by Tait on third.
From then on California started pil
ing up runs, one in the fourth, two in
the fifth, and the last in the seventh.
Maurice, right fielder, and Tait each
got two hits during the game. Jimmy
Dixon made his first hit of the Califor
nia-Stanford series in the fourth when
he drove out a pretty three-bagger and
scored on a throw-in.
Three Hits in Fifth
In the fifth the Bears got three
nicely spaced hits, all singles. Tait and
