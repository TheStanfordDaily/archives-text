# POLLS OPEN FOR BALLOTING ON CAPTAINCY ELECTION RULE
## Post-Season Election System Brought to Vote By Petition 
### Frank Baker 
Tomorrow morning at 8:45 o'clock
the polls for thfe special election on
the action of the Executive Commit
tee in changing the date of electing
sports captains will open at the Law
Steps. The polls will close at 2 o'clock.
Under the ruling made by the Execu
tive Committee in regular session
Tuesday, April 6, the following motion
was passed, not to be retroactive:
"That captains be not elected until
the end of the season; that the posi
tion be entirely honorary, allowing
the coach to appoint a field captain
for each contest. This is to apply to
both major and minor sports."
Opponents Petition
The day after the meeting a peti
tion was circulated expressing dis
favor of the action by several students.
The petition read: "We, the under
signed students, feeling that the ac
tion of the Executive Committee in
changing the time of election of cap
tains for the various sports was with
out proper consideration and discus
sion, hereby request that the measure
be put to a vote of the student body."
At the last meeting of the Executive
Committee the petition was tendered
by the petitioners and accepted by the
Committee.
In answer to the statement made
by the dissatisfied students, the Execu
tive Committee contends that the ac
tion was taken only after several
weeks of discussion with athletes and
coaches. They also felt, since there
was no representation from the oppos
ing faction at the meeting when the
motion was passed, even after a direct
invitation, that there was no serious
opposition to the change. All the ath
letes conferred with, and the coaches,
were in favor of the new policy.
Hunt Favors Rule
Coach Husky Hunt, when inter
viewed on the plan, declared: "I have
always favored the idea, and took the
liberty of naming an acting captain
for the freshman basketball team this
year. The men were perfectly satisfied
with the arrangement. I am glad to
hear that the new ruling has passed."
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
sports, heartily favored the plan, stat
ing: "I think that it will work out. If
a man is a real leader he will rise to
the occasion at the critical time. From
the coaches' standpoint, the new ar
rangement is very satisfactory."
As presented in the discussion, the
main argument in favor of the plan,
and the one which has recommended
it to several other colleges in various
sections of the country is that if there
is no regular captain a coach need
have no hesitation in taking a man
out of the game merely because he is
the elected leader of the team.
Another idea put forth was that the
men who elect a captain for the fol
lowing season are mostly men who
are graduating and will not be play
ing with him the next year, and do
not know if he will be the same type
of player in the following season that
he has been in the past one.
The members of the Executive Com
mittee state that they aj;e anxious
that students think over, seriously,
the problem in question, that they may
express the honest opinion of the stu
dent body as a whole.
