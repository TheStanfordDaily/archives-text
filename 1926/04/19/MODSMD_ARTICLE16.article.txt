# STANDARDIZATION OF COLLEGE DESTROYS CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS
## 
### 
! That college should be a conflict is
I the opinion of Louis Untermeyer, poet,
; anthologist, who spoke on the campus
I recently. He believes that suppression
|of college (bought is conducive to
! standardization of the group. College,
; according to Untermeyer, is the inter
mediary between standardization and
radicalism. Suppression of ideas would
i lead to the triumph of one or the
j other.
After having lived in Europe for
some time, Untermeyer finds a marked
contrast between European and Ameri
can attitudes. In Europe, he says,
j there is control rather than suppres-
I sion. Europeans evidence a willingness
to consider, but in America, particu
\ larly in the West, there is a decided
| tendency toward standardization which
j does not encourage constructive
thought.
To Untermeyer, the main function
of college for the individual is to help
during those in-between years from
17 to 22, when people are trying to
"find themselves." Any literary
achievement he does not attribute to
college education. In his experience
th greater number of people who write
! at college do not write later.
On the other hand, things Unter
! meyer, a real artist is never deflected
; long from his course. In the artist's
life, then, "college is just another one
iof those activities into which be en
ters. It is like athletics or any other j
hobby which helps him to develop
j himself."
