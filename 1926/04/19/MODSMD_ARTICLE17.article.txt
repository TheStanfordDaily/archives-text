Frederick Kellogg, Alpha Kappa
Lambda, won first prize in the Daily
Palo Alto dope contest on the Cali
fornia track meet. Kellogg was award
ed first honors over an unknown con
testant by naming the score correctly
and giving the highest number of
place-winners. G. Garner Green, El
Cuadro, was third prize-winner, giving
the score as to 61 in favor of
the Cardinals.
The winner of the second prize pre
dicted a Stanford victory by the G9 to
62 score but neglected to print his
name on the dope sheet. Kellogg
guessed twenty individual winners,
while the second-prize prophet named
eighteen correctly.
Fraser and Company will present
Kellogg with either a hat box or hand
bag. The dopester who neglected to
sign his name will receive a choice
of any $5 brassie or driver, any iron
club, or goods of equal value from
Smith on the Circle. Green is awarded
the $2.50 hosiery order offered by
Thoits Brothers.
If the winner of the second award
will appear in the Daily Palo Alto
office and give a summary of the note
written at the bottom of the dope
sheet he will be awarded the prize.
