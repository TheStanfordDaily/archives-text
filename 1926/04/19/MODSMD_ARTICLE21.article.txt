Stanford 69, California 62.
So read the scoreboard at the end of
the thirty-second annual Stanford-
California track and field meet, held
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium. But the score tells in no way
the tenseness and thrills of the great
est track meet in" the history of the
two rival institutions. It does not tell
of the six Stanford-California records
that went by the boards, or the amaz
ing upsets that occurred frequently
during the meet.
For the second consecutive year
Dick Macßae, Cardinal broad-jumper,
proved to be the hero for Stanford.
The outcome of the meet depended
upon the result of the broad jump, a
Stanford victory would be assured
with a first and third, while a Cali
fornia victory rested upon winning a
first place in the event.
Macßae Cinches Meet
Macßae took an early lead with a
leap of 23 feet 1 7-8 inches, and was
closely followed by Meeks with a jump
of 23 feet 1-4 inches. Bondshu's best
jump, 22 feet 5 inches, was also estab
lished at the start of the event.
There was no doubt as to the out
come of the relay. Babcock of Stan
ford took a nine-yard lead over Diggs
of California. Storie increased the ad
vantage to forty yards, Richardson
added ten more, and Ted Miller
sprinted to the tape sixty yards ahead
of the last Californian. The time, 3.19,
betters by 2.6 seconds the old mark
of 3.21.6 which had stood for twelve
years.
Captain Bill Richardson avenged his
defeat last year by winning from El
mer Boyden of California in the fea
ture race of the meet, the half-mile.
The Cardinal leader broke the tape
ten yards ahead of his old rival in the
fastest 880-yard race ever witnessed
on the coast. Richardson added more
glory to his accomplishment by break
ing the records of 1:54.3, made last
year by Boyden, in the excellent time
of 1:53.8.
A great deal of speculation was cur
rent concerning the entrance of Ted
Miller in the half-mile. When the run
ners came out of the straight-away
it was evident that the star Cardinal
quarter-miler was in the race solely
for the purpose of drawing Boyden out,
and when Boyden hung back in fourth
position, Miller dropped out at the
220-yard mark.
Chase of California held the lead
until less than a hundred yards from
the finish. At this point Richardson
sprinted past Boyden, who was then
effectively boxed by his own team
mate, Chase, and tore down the home
stretch in a great spurt that carried
him to the tape ten yards ahead of
the vainly sprinting Boyden. It was a
great exhibition of headwork on the
part of the Stanford captain when he
passed the California runners at the
only opportune time.
Gerkin Is Weight Star
Elmer Gerkin, California weight
star, proved conclusively that he is
one of the greatest competitive ath
letes on the Pacific Coast when he
turned in a double victory over Biff
Hoffman in the weight events. Gerkin
was conceded the edge in the shot-put,
and he lived up to advance notices by
tossing the iron ball 48 feet, 2 5-8
inches. His performance in the discus
was totally unexpected, however, and
his record-breaking throw of 146 feet
9 inches, was one of the greatest up
sets of the day.
Hoffman placed second for Stanford
in both events, and Richards of Stan
ford surprised dopesters by breaking
in for an unexpected third place. Phil
lips of California took third in the dis
cus, an event in which all places were
gained by throws of over 140 feet.
Barber Wins Sprints
Captain Phil Barber lived up to ex
pectations by winning both sprints.
He set a new Stanford-California rec
ord in the century when he negotiated
the distance in the exceedingly fast
time of 9 8-10 seconds. Bondshu,
Bear broad-jumper, was the dark horse
of this race, and took second place
less than a yard behind Barber. Louis
Gaspar scored Stanford's only point
with a third place. Barber scored an
easy win in the 220, beating out Cov
erly and Gaspar, who placed second
and third, respectively, by more than
seven yards.
West of Stanford made a great
showing in the high hurdles. Regan of
California was doped to take the event
but West took a yard lead at the last
barrier after the runners had battled
evenly all the way. and broke the tape
a stride ahead of his opponent. As
was expected, Spencer of Stanford
took third easily. Johnson of Califor
nia led his teammate, Enos, by four
yards in the low hurdles, while West
stumbled at the finish and placed
third.
Criley a Surprise
California's distance men proved too
strong for their Stanford opponents,
and consequently took firsts in both
the mile and two-mile. Schwobeda led
Bill Kerr by twenty yards in the mile,
winning in the noteworthy time of
4:23.8. Ranney of Stanford placed
third by beating out his teammate,
Cypher. Stevens came through with
his expected win in the two-mile, but
the real feature of the race was the
splendid showing of Ted Criley of
Stanford. Criley hung close behind
Stevens during the entire gruelling
eight laps, and finished a bare two
yards behind the Bruin star. Fox of
California, favored for a second place,
finished a rather poor third.
Ted Miller broke his own record in
the quarter-mile when he won from
his teammate, S&rie, by four yards in
the fast time of 48 9-10 seconds. Bab
cock beat out Talbot of California to
give Stanford a clean sweep in the one-

I lap event. Templeton's trio of quarter
milers added another shut-out to their
' previous wins over U.S.C. and Oregon
i this year.
Whitewash in Javelin
Stanford showed great strength in
the javelin by whitewashing the Bear
spear-tossers. Harlow, Joaquin, and
Shipkey placed in the order named,
with throws of 191 feet 2 7-8 inches,
187 feet 1 1-4 inches, and 184 feet
2 1-2 inches, respectively. Harlow's
toss is the best recorded in Bear-
Card meets for several years.
Work and King of Stanford, and
Hampton of California, produced the
| great battle expected in the high jump,
! but were unable to settle their argu
j ment as all three tied at 6 feet 3
( inches. Hill, stellar Bruin pole vaulter,
J came through with a wonderful p«r
-| formance in his event by breaking the
| old Stanford-California record with a
great, leap of 12 feet 11 3-4 inches.
I Sterling of California took second, and
| Chet Ross of Stanford surprised by
taking third with an unexpected jump
of 12 feet 7 inches. This mark is by
far the best that any Stanford vaulter
| has made for several years.
Cards Outscored on Track
A summary of the results show that
Stanford scored 31 points to 23 for
California in the field events, but that
the Bruins outscored Stanford 39 to 38
on the track. California took the most
first places, eight to the Cardinals'
five, but Stanford won the meet with
a greater number of seconds and
thirds. Only one event produced a tie,
the high jump, in which three men
tied for first.

Captain Bill Richardson avenged his
defeat last year by winning from El
mer Boyden of California in the fea
ture race of the meet, the half-mile.
The Cardinal leader broke the tape
ten yards ahead of his old rival in the
fastest 880-yard race ever witnessed
on the coast. Richardson added more
glory to his accomplishment by break
ing the records of 1:54.3, made last
year by Boyden, in the excellent time
of 1:53.8.
A great deal of speculation was cur
rent concerning the entrance of Ted
Miller in the half-mile. When the run
ners came out of the straight-away
it was evident that the star Cardinal
quarter-miler was in the race solely
for the purpose of drawing Boyden out,
and when Boyden hung back in fourth
position, Miller dropped out at the
220-yard mark.
Chase of California held the lead
until less than a hundred yards from
the finish. At this point Richardson
sprinted past Boyden, who was then
effectively boxed by his own team
mate, Chase, and tore down the home
stretch in a great spurt that carried
him to the tape ten yards ahead of
the vainly sprinting Boyden. It was a
great exhibition of headwork on the
part of the Stanford captain when he
passed the California runners at the
only opportune time.
Gerkin Is Weight Star
Elmer Gerkin, California weight
star, proved conclusively that he is
one of the greatest competitive ath
letes on the Pacific Coast when he
turned in a double victory over Biff
Hoffman in the weight events. Gerkin
was conceded the edge in the shot-put,
and he lived up to advance notices by
tossing the iron ball 48 feet, 2 5-8
inches. His performance in the discus
was totally unexpected, however, and
his record-breaking throw of 146 feet
9 inches, was one of the greatest up
sets of the day.
Hoffman placed second for Stanford
in both events, and Richards of Stan
ford surprised dopesters by breaking
in for an unexpected third place. Phil
lips of California took third in the dis
cus, an event in which all places were
gained by throws of over 140 feet.
Barber Wins Sprints
Captain Phil Barber lived up to ex
pectations by winning both sprints.
He set a new Stanford-California rec
ord in the century when he negotiated
the distance in the exceedingly fast
time of 9 8-10 seconds. Bondshu,
Bear broad-jumper, was the dark horse
of this race, and took second place
less than a yard behind Barber. Louis
Gaspar scored Stanford's only point
with a third place. Barber scored an
easy win in the 220, beating out Cov
erly and Gaspar, who placed second
and third, respectively, by more than
seven yards.
West of Stanford made a great
showing in the high hurdles. Regan of
California was doped to take the event
but West took a yard lead at the last
barrier after the runners had battled
evenly all the way. and broke the tape
a stride ahead of his opponent. As
was expected, Spencer of Stanford
took third easily. Johnson of Califor
nia led his teammate, Enos, by four
yards in the low hurdles, while West
stumbled at the finish and placed
third.
Criley a Surprise
California's distance men proved too
strong for their Stanford opponents,
and consequently took firsts in both
the mile and two-mile. Schwobeda led
Bill Kerr by twenty yards in the mile,
winning in the noteworthy time of
4:23.8. Ranney of Stanford placed
third by beating out his teammate,
Cypher. Stevens came through with
his expected win in the two-mile, but
the real feature of the race was the
splendid showing of Ted Criley of
Stanford. Criley hung close behind
Stevens during the entire gruelling
eight laps, and finished a bare two
yards behind the Bruin star. Fox of
California, favored for a second place,
finished a rather poor third.
Ted Miller broke his own record in
the quarter-mile when he won from
his teammate, S&rie, by four yards in
the fast time of 48 9-10 seconds. Bab
cock beat out Talbot of California to
give Stanford a clean sweep in the one-

I lap event. Templeton's trio of quarter
milers added another shut-out to their
' previous wins over U.S.C. and Oregon
i this year.
Whitewash in Javelin
Stanford showed great strength in
the javelin by whitewashing the Bear
spear-tossers. Harlow, Joaquin, and
Shipkey placed in the order named,
with throws of 191 feet 2 7-8 inches,
187 feet 1 1-4 inches, and 184 feet
2 1-2 inches, respectively. Harlow's
toss is the best recorded in Bear-
Card meets for several years.
Work and King of Stanford, and
Hampton of California, produced the
| great battle expected in the high jump,
! but were unable to settle their argu
j ment as all three tied at 6 feet 3
( inches. Hill, stellar Bruin pole vaulter,
J came through with a wonderful p«r
-| formance in his event by breaking the
| old Stanford-California record with a
great, leap of 12 feet 11 3-4 inches.
I Sterling of California took second, and
| Chet Ross of Stanford surprised by
taking third with an unexpected jump
of 12 feet 7 inches. This mark is by
far the best that any Stanford vaulter
| has made for several years.
Cards Outscored on Track
A summary of the results show that
Stanford scored 31 points to 23 for
California in the field events, but that
the Bruins outscored Stanford 39 to 38
on the track. California took the most
first places, eight to the Cardinals'
five, but Stanford won the meet with
a greater number of seconds and
thirds. Only one event produced a tie,
the high jump, in which three men
tied for first.

Stanford 69, California 62.
So read the scoreboard at the end of
the thirty-second annual Stanford-
California track and field meet, held
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium. But the score tells in no way
the tenseness and thrills of the great
est track meet in" the history of the
two rival institutions. It does not tell
of the six Stanford-California records
that went by the boards, or the amaz
ing upsets that occurred frequently
during the meet.
For the second consecutive year
Dick Macßae, Cardinal broad-jumper,
proved to be the hero for Stanford.
The outcome of the meet depended
upon the result of the broad jump, a
Stanford victory would be assured
with a first and third, while a Cali
fornia victory rested upon winning a
first place in the event.
Macßae Cinches Meet
Macßae took an early lead with a
leap of 23 feet 1 7-8 inches, and was
closely followed by Meeks with a jump
of 23 feet 1-4 inches. Bondshu's best
jump, 22 feet 5 inches, was also estab
lished at the start of the event.
There was no doubt as to the out
come of the relay. Babcock of Stan
ford took a nine-yard lead over Diggs
of California. Storie increased the ad
vantage to forty yards, Richardson
added ten more, and Ted Miller
sprinted to the tape sixty yards ahead
of the last Californian. The time, 3.19,
betters by 2.6 seconds the old mark
of 3.21.6 which had stood for twelve

his record-breaking throw of 146 feet
9 inches, was one of the greatest up
sets of the day.
Hoffman placed second for Stanford
in both events, and Richards of Stan
ford surprised dopesters by breaking
in for an unexpected third place. Phil
lips of California took third in the dis
cus, an event in which all places were
gained by throws of over 140 feet.
Barber Wins Sprints
Captain Phil Barber lived up to ex
pectations by winning both sprints.
He set a new Stanford-California rec
ord in the century when he negotiated
the distance in the exceedingly fast
time of 9 8-10 seconds. Bondshu,
Bear broad-jumper, was the dark horse
of this race, and took second place
less than a yard behind Barber. Louis
Gaspar scored Stanford's only point
with a third place. Barber scored an
easy win in the 220, beating out Cov
erly and Gaspar, who placed second
and third, respectively, by more than
seven yards.
West of Stanford made a great
showing in the high hurdles. Regan of
California was doped to take the event
but West took a yard lead at the last
barrier after the runners had battled
evenly all the way. and broke the tape
a stride ahead of his opponent. As
was expected, Spencer of Stanford
took third easily. Johnson of Califor
nia led his teammate, Enos, by four
yards in the low hurdles, while West
stumbled at the finish and placed
third.
Criley a Surprise
California's distance men proved too
strong for their Stanford opponents,
and consequently took firsts in both
the mile and two-mile. Schwobeda led
Bill Kerr by twenty yards in the mile,
winning in the noteworthy time of
4:23.8. Ranney of Stanford placed
third by beating out his teammate,
Cypher. Stevens came through with
his expected win in the two-mile, but
the real feature of the race was the
splendid showing of Ted Criley of
Stanford. Criley hung close behind
Stevens during the entire gruelling
eight laps, and finished a bare two
yards behind the Bruin star. Fox of
California, favored for a second place,
finished a rather poor third.
Ted Miller broke his own record in
the quarter-mile when he won from
his teammate, S&rie, by four yards in
the fast time of 48 9-10 seconds. Bab
cock beat out Talbot of California to
give Stanford a clean sweep in the one-

I lap event. Templeton's trio of quarter
milers added another shut-out to their
' previous wins over U.S.C. and Oregon
i this year.
Whitewash in Javelin
Stanford showed great strength in
the javelin by whitewashing the Bear
spear-tossers. Harlow, Joaquin, and
Shipkey placed in the order named,
with throws of 191 feet 2 7-8 inches,
187 feet 1 1-4 inches, and 184 feet
2 1-2 inches, respectively. Harlow's
toss is the best recorded in Bear-
Card meets for several years.
Work and King of Stanford, and
Hampton of California, produced the
| great battle expected in the high jump,
! but were unable to settle their argu
j ment as all three tied at 6 feet 3
( inches. Hill, stellar Bruin pole vaulter,
J came through with a wonderful p«r
-| formance in his event by breaking the
| old Stanford-California record with a
great, leap of 12 feet 11 3-4 inches.
I Sterling of California took second, and
| Chet Ross of Stanford surprised by
taking third with an unexpected jump
of 12 feet 7 inches. This mark is by
far the best that any Stanford vaulter
| has made for several years.
Cards Outscored on Track
A summary of the results show that
Stanford scored 31 points to 23 for
California in the field events, but that
the Bruins outscored Stanford 39 to 38
on the track. California took the most
first places, eight to the Cardinals'
five, but Stanford won the meet with
a greater number of seconds and
thirds. Only one event produced a tie,
the high jump, in which three men

Stanford 69, California 62.
So read the scoreboard at the end of
the thirty-second annual Stanford-
California track and field meet, held
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium. But the score tells in no way
the tenseness and thrills of the great
est track meet in" the history of the
two rival institutions. It does not tell
of the six Stanford-California records
that went by the boards, or the amaz
ing upsets that occurred frequently
during the meet.
For the second consecutive year
Dick Macßae, Cardinal broad-jumper,
proved to be the hero for Stanford.
The outcome of the meet depended
upon the result of the broad jump, a
Stanford victory would be assured
with a first and third, while a Cali
fornia victory rested upon winning a
first place in the event.
Macßae Cinches Meet
Macßae took an early lead with a
leap of 23 feet 1 7-8 inches, and was
closely followed by Meeks with a jump
of 23 feet 1-4 inches. Bondshu's best
jump, 22 feet 5 inches, was also estab
lished at the start of the event.
There was no doubt as to the out
come of the relay. Babcock of Stan
ford took a nine-yard lead over Diggs
of California. Storie increased the ad
vantage to forty yards, Richardson
added ten more, and Ted Miller
sprinted to the tape sixty yards ahead
of the last Californian. The time, 3.19,
betters by 2.6 seconds the old mark
of 3.21.6 which had stood for twelve
years.
Captain Bill Richardson avenged his
defeat last year by winning from El
mer Boyden of California in the fea
ture race of the meet, the half-mile.
The Cardinal leader broke the tape
ten yards ahead of his old rival in the
fastest 880-yard race ever witnessed
on the coast. Richardson added more
glory to his accomplishment by break
ing the records of 1:54.3, made last
year by Boyden, in the excellent time
of 1:53.8.
A great deal of speculation was cur
rent concerning the entrance of Ted
Miller in the half-mile. When the run
ners came out of the straight-away
it was evident that the star Cardinal
quarter-miler was in the race solely
for the purpose of drawing Boyden out,
and when Boyden hung back in fourth
position, Miller dropped out at the
220-yard mark.
Chase of California held the lead
until less than a hundred yards from
the finish. At this point Richardson
sprinted past Boyden, who was then
effectively boxed by his own team
mate, Chase, and tore down the home
stretch in a great spurt that carried
him to the tape ten yards ahead of
the vainly sprinting Boyden. It was a
great exhibition of headwork on the
part of the Stanford captain when he
passed the California runners at the
only opportune time.
Gerkin Is Weight Star
Elmer Gerkin, California weight
star, proved conclusively that he is
one of the greatest competitive ath
letes on the Pacific Coast when he
turned in a double victory over Biff
Hoffman in the weight events. Gerkin
was conceded the edge in the shot-put,
and he lived up to advance notices by
tossing the iron ball 48 feet, 2 5-8
inches. His performance in the discus
was totally unexpected, however, and
his record-breaking throw of 146 feet
9 inches, was one of the greatest up
sets of the day.
Hoffman placed second for Stanford
in both events, and Richards of Stan

in for an unexpected third place. Phil
lips of California took third in the dis

gained by throws of over 140 feet.

Cypher. Stevens came through with
his expected win in the two-mile, but
the real feature of the race was the
splendid showing of Ted Criley of
Stanford. Criley hung close behind
Stevens during the entire gruelling
eight laps, and finished a bare two
yards behind the Bruin star. Fox of
California, favored for a second place,
finished a rather poor third.
Ted Miller broke his own record in
the quarter-mile when he won from
his teammate, S&rie, by four yards in
the fast time of 48 9-10 seconds. Bab
cock beat out Talbot of California to
give Stanford a clean sweep in the one-

I lap event. Templeton's trio of quarter
milers added another shut-out to their
' previous wins over U.S.C. and Oregon
i this year.
Whitewash in Javelin
Stanford showed great strength in
the javelin by whitewashing the Bear
spear-tossers. Harlow, Joaquin, and
Shipkey placed in the order named,
with throws of 191 feet 2 7-8 inches,
187 feet 1 1-4 inches, and 184 feet
2 1-2 inches, respectively. Harlow's
toss is the best recorded in Bear-
Card meets for several years.
Work and King of Stanford, and
Hampton of California, produced the
| great battle expected in the high jump,
! but were unable to settle their argu
j ment as all three tied at 6 feet 3
( inches. Hill, stellar Bruin pole vaulter,
J came through with a wonderful p«r
-| formance in his event by breaking the
| old Stanford-California record with a
great, leap of 12 feet 11 3-4 inches.
I Sterling of California took second, and
| Chet Ross of Stanford surprised by
taking third with an unexpected jump
of 12 feet 7 inches. This mark is by
far the best that any Stanford vaulter
| has made for several years.
Cards Outscored on Track
A summary of the results show that
Stanford scored 31 points to 23 for
California in the field events, but that
the Bruins outscored Stanford 39 to 38
on the track. California took the most
first places, eight to the Cardinals'
five, but Stanford won the meet with
a greater number of seconds and

Stanford 69, California 62.
So read the scoreboard at the end of
the thirty-second annual Stanford-
California track and field meet, held
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium. But the score tells in no way
the tenseness and thrills of the great
est track meet in" the history of the
two rival institutions. It does not tell
of the six Stanford-California records
that went by the boards, or the amaz
ing upsets that occurred frequently
during the meet.
For the second consecutive year
Dick Macßae, Cardinal broad-jumper,
proved to be the hero for Stanford.
The outcome of the meet depended
upon the result of the broad jump, a
Stanford victory would be assured
with a first and third, while a Cali
fornia victory rested upon winning a
first place in the event.
Macßae Cinches Meet
Macßae took an early lead with a
leap of 23 feet 1 7-8 inches, and was
closely followed by Meeks with a jump
of 23 feet 1-4 inches. Bondshu's best
jump, 22 feet 5 inches, was also estab
lished at the start of the event.
There was no doubt as to the out
come of the relay. Babcock of Stan
ford took a nine-yard lead over Diggs
of California. Storie increased the ad
vantage to forty yards, Richardson
added ten more, and Ted Miller
sprinted to the tape sixty yards ahead
of the last Californian. The time, 3.19,
betters by 2.6 seconds the old mark
of 3.21.6 which had stood for twelve
years.
Captain Bill Richardson avenged his
defeat last year by winning from El
mer Boyden of California in the fea
ture race of the meet, the half-mile.
The Cardinal leader broke the tape
ten yards ahead of his old rival in the
fastest 880-yard race ever witnessed
on the coast. Richardson added more
glory to his accomplishment by break
ing the records of 1:54.3, made last
year by Boyden, in the excellent time
of 1:53.8.
A great deal of speculation was cur
rent concerning the entrance of Ted
Miller in the half-mile. When the run
ners came out of the straight-away
it was evident that the star Cardinal
quarter-miler was in the race solely
for the purpose of drawing Boyden out,
and when Boyden hung back in fourth
position, Miller dropped out at the
220-yard mark.
Chase of California held the lead
until less than a hundred yards from
the finish. At this point Richardson
sprinted past Boyden, who was then
effectively boxed by his own team
mate, Chase, and tore down the home
stretch in a great spurt that carried
him to the tape ten yards ahead of
the vainly sprinting Boyden. It was a
great exhibition of headwork on the
part of the Stanford captain when he
passed the California runners at the
only opportune time.
Gerkin Is Weight Star
Elmer Gerkin, California weight
star, proved conclusively that he is
one of the greatest competitive ath
letes on the Pacific Coast when he
turned in a double victory over Biff
Hoffman in the weight events. Gerkin
was conceded the edge in the shot-put,
and he lived up to advance notices by
tossing the iron ball 48 feet, 2 5-8
inches. His performance in the discus
was totally unexpected, however, and
his record-breaking throw of 146 feet
9 inches, was one of the greatest up
sets of the day.
Hoffman placed second for Stanford
in both events, and Richards of Stan
ford surprised dopesters by breaking
in for an unexpected third place. Phil
lips of California took third in the dis
cus, an event in which all places were
gained by throws of over 140 feet.
Barber Wins Sprints
Captain Phil Barber lived up to ex
pectations by winning both sprints.
He set a new Stanford-California rec
ord in the century when he negotiated
the distance in the exceedingly fast
time of 9 8-10 seconds. Bondshu,
Bear broad-jumper, was the dark horse
of this race, and took second place
less than a yard behind Barber. Louis
Gaspar scored Stanford's only point
with a third place. Barber scored an
easy win in the 220, beating out Cov
erly and Gaspar, who placed second
and third, respectively, by more than
seven yards.
West of Stanford made a great
showing in the high hurdles. Regan of
California was doped to take the event
but West took a yard lead at the last
barrier after the runners had battled
evenly all the way. and broke the tape
a stride ahead of his opponent. As
was expected, Spencer of Stanford
took third easily. Johnson of Califor
nia led his teammate, Enos, by four
yards in the low hurdles, while West
stumbled at the finish and placed
third.
Criley a Surprise
California's distance men proved too
strong for their Stanford opponents,
and consequently took firsts in both
the mile and two-mile. Schwobeda led
Bill Kerr by twenty yards in the mile,
winning in the noteworthy time of
4:23.8. Ranney of Stanford placed
third by beating out his teammate,
Cypher. Stevens came through with
his expected win in the two-mile, but
the real feature of the race was the
splendid showing of Ted Criley of
Stanford. Criley hung close behind
Stevens during the entire gruelling

So read the scoreboard at the end of
the thirty-second annual Stanford-
California track and field meet, held
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium. But the score tells in no way
the tenseness and thrills of the great
est track meet in" the history of the
two rival institutions. It does not tell
of the six Stanford-California records
that went by the boards, or the amaz
ing upsets that occurred frequently
during the meet.
For the second consecutive year
Dick Macßae, Cardinal broad-jumper,
proved to be the hero for Stanford.
The outcome of the meet depended
upon the result of the broad jump, a
Stanford victory would be assured
with a first and third, while a Cali
fornia victory rested upon winning a
first place in the event.
Macßae Cinches Meet
Macßae took an early lead with a
leap of 23 feet 1 7-8 inches, and was
closely followed by Meeks with a jump
of 23 feet 1-4 inches. Bondshu's best
jump, 22 feet 5 inches, was also estab
lished at the start of the event.
There was no doubt as to the out
come of the relay. Babcock of Stan
ford took a nine-yard lead over Diggs
of California. Storie increased the ad
vantage to forty yards, Richardson
added ten more, and Ted Miller
sprinted to the tape sixty yards ahead
of the last Californian. The time, 3.19,
betters by 2.6 seconds the old mark
of 3.21.6 which had stood for twelve
years.
Captain Bill Richardson avenged his
defeat last year by winning from El
mer Boyden of California in the fea
ture race of the meet, the half-mile.
The Cardinal leader broke the tape
ten yards ahead of his old rival in the
fastest 880-yard race ever witnessed
on the coast. Richardson added more
glory to his accomplishment by break
ing the records of 1:54.3, made last
year by Boyden, in the excellent time
of 1:53.8.
A great deal of speculation was cur
rent concerning the entrance of Ted
Miller in the half-mile. When the run
ners came out of the straight-away
it was evident that the star Cardinal
quarter-miler was in the race solely
for the purpose of drawing Boyden out,
and when Boyden hung back in fourth
position, Miller dropped out at the
220-yard mark.
Chase of California held the lead
until less than a hundred yards from
the finish. At this point Richardson
sprinted past Boyden, who was then
effectively boxed by his own team
mate, Chase, and tore down the home
stretch in a great spurt that carried
him to the tape ten yards ahead of
the vainly sprinting Boyden. It was a
great exhibition of headwork on the
part of the Stanford captain when he
passed the California runners at the
only opportune time.
Gerkin Is Weight Star
Elmer Gerkin, California weight
star, proved conclusively that he is
one of the greatest competitive ath
letes on the Pacific Coast when he
turned in a double victory over Biff
Hoffman in the weight events. Gerkin
was conceded the edge in the shot-put,
and he lived up to advance notices by
tossing the iron ball 48 feet, 2 5-8
inches. His performance in the discus
was totally unexpected, however, and
his record-breaking throw of 146 feet
9 inches, was one of the greatest up
sets of the day.
Hoffman placed second for Stanford
in both events, and Richards of Stan
ford surprised dopesters by breaking
in for an unexpected third place. Phil
lips of California took third in the dis
cus, an event in which all places were
gained by throws of over 140 feet.
Barber Wins Sprints
Captain Phil Barber lived up to ex
pectations by winning both sprints.
He set a new Stanford-California rec
ord in the century when he negotiated
the distance in the exceedingly fast
time of 9 8-10 seconds. Bondshu,
Bear broad-jumper, was the dark horse
of this race, and took second place
less than a yard behind Barber. Louis
Gaspar scored Stanford's only point
with a third place. Barber scored an
easy win in the 220, beating out Cov
erly and Gaspar, who placed second
and third, respectively, by more than
seven yards.
West of Stanford made a great
showing in the high hurdles. Regan of
California was doped to take the event
but West took a yard lead at the last
barrier after the runners had battled
evenly all the way. and broke the tape
a stride ahead of his opponent. As
was expected, Spencer of Stanford
took third easily. Johnson of Califor
nia led his teammate, Enos, by four
yards in the low hurdles, while West
stumbled at the finish and placed
third.
Criley a Surprise
California's distance men proved too
strong for their Stanford opponents,
and consequently took firsts in both
the mile and two-mile. Schwobeda led
Bill Kerr by twenty yards in the mile,
winning in the noteworthy time of
4:23.8. Ranney of Stanford placed
third by beating out his teammate,
Cypher. Stevens came through with
his expected win in the two-mile, but
the real feature of the race was the
splendid showing of Ted Criley of
Stanford. Criley hung close behind
Stevens during the entire gruelling
eight laps, and finished a bare two
yards behind the Bruin star. Fox of
California, favored for a second place,
finished a rather poor third.
Ted Miller broke his own record in
the quarter-mile when he won from
his teammate, S&rie, by four yards in
the fast time of 48 9-10 seconds. Bab
cock beat out Talbot of California to
give Stanford a clean sweep in the one-

I lap event. Templeton's trio of quarter
milers added another shut-out to their
' previous wins over U.S.C. and Oregon
i this year.
Whitewash in Javelin
Stanford showed great strength in
the javelin by whitewashing the Bear
spear-tossers. Harlow, Joaquin, and
Shipkey placed in the order named,
with throws of 191 feet 2 7-8 inches,
187 feet 1 1-4 inches, and 184 feet
2 1-2 inches, respectively. Harlow's
toss is the best recorded in Bear-
Card meets for several years.
Work and King of Stanford, and
Hampton of California, produced the
| great battle expected in the high jump,
! but were unable to settle their argu
j ment as all three tied at 6 feet 3
( inches. Hill, stellar Bruin pole vaulter,
J came through with a wonderful p«r
-| formance in his event by breaking the
| old Stanford-California record with a
great, leap of 12 feet 11 3-4 inches.
I Sterling of California took second, and
| Chet Ross of Stanford surprised by
taking third with an unexpected jump
of 12 feet 7 inches. This mark is by
far the best that any Stanford vaulter
| has made for several years.
