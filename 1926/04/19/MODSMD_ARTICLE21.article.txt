Stanford 69, California 62.
So read the scoreboard at the end of
the thirty-second annual Stanford-
California track and field meet, held
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium. But the score tells in no way
the tenseness and thrills of the great
est track meet in" the history of the
two rival institutions. It does not tell
of the six Stanford-California records
that went by the boards, or the amaz
ing upsets that occurred frequently
during the meet.
For the second consecutive year
Dick Macßae, Cardinal broad-jumper,
proved to be the hero for Stanford.
The outcome of the meet depended
upon the result of the broad jump, a
Stanford victory would be assured
with a first and third, while a Cali
fornia victory rested upon winning a
first place in the event.
Macßae Cinches Meet
Macßae took an early lead with a
leap of 23 feet 1 7-8 inches, and was
closely followed by Meeks with a jump
of 23 feet 1-4 inches. Bondshu's best
jump, 22 feet 5 inches, was also estab
lished at the start of the event.
There was no doubt as to the out
come of the relay. Babcock of Stan
ford took a nine-yard lead over Diggs
of California. Storie increased the ad
vantage to forty yards, Richardson
added ten more, and Ted Miller
sprinted to the tape sixty yards ahead
of the last Californian. The time, 3.19,
betters by 2.6 seconds the old mark
