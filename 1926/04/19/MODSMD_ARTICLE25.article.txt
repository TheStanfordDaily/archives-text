# A 						Year of Victories
## 
### 
As Ted Miller crossed the finish line of the mile-relay Saturday and
telegraph instruments flashed the news, "Stanford Wins!" there was re
corded not only another Cardinal victory but the ending of a triumphant
sports year for the University.
We support five major sports athletic teams. For the first time in a
decade, a majority of them—three—finished their respective seasons by
defeating Blue and Gold teams, and, as one might facetiously remark,
"While not entirely Red, the year has really been quite pink." For ten
years Stanford has labored for this ending to its year, and now that it has
been accomplished due credit should be given to those responsible. So
gradual has been the accension that there may be some who will not ap
preciate the peak which the University has attained in this phase of its
general activity.
Coach Warner began the upward march with his powerful football
eleven. It took years for the Cardinal colors to serpentine, but when they
were finally permitted that privilege it was made doubly sweet in the de
ciseveness of the victory. A new "Stanford Era" had begun and with it a
renewed confidence by alumni and students in "Pop" Warner and football
teams in general.
Then came tennis and now track. Coaches Davis and Templeton
worked unceasingly for six months and presented two victories to the
University for self-satisfaction. Both they and their teams are to be con
gratulated.
All cannot be winners and a few must fall by the wayside. Basket
ball fought a valient but losing battle and its efforts are appreciated. Base
ball tried desperately to make a come-back after losing its first game and
succeeded partially.
All in all, we are proud to point to the 1925-26 athletic, season, espec
ially in view of the wonderment expressed by many that such a small
school as Stanford can so successfully compete with one the size and
greatness of the University of California. Such expressions add flavor
to any victories we may gain.
