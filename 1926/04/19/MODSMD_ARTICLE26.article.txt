# Tomorrow's Election
## 
### 
Tomorrow the student body, or rather that portion of it which takes
the trouble, will ballot on an important issue which has already been rather
thoroughly considered and discussed. The old method of electing captains
in advance of the season's competition was thought by some to be unsatis
factory. As a result, a proposition was drafted and passed by the Execu
tive Committee. It provides for the election of an honorary captain when
the team's schedule has been completed, and gives the coach the power of
appointing a field captain in sports where it is necessary to have a man to
confer with the officials or the captain of the opposing team. Because
of a protesting petition, the matter has been brought to a vote of the
A.S.S.U.
The arguments pro which have been advanced are as follows:
1. Politics will be eliminated from athletics.
2. It will be a greater honor to be named captain after the season is over.
The man who is elected will undoubtedly be the man who has done the
most for the team's welfare.
3. The coach will no longer have to plan his lineup to include a man be
cause he is the captain when another player would have worked with
the combination to better advantage.
Those who attack the new system argue as follows:
1. That too much power would be given the coaches.
2. That it is too radical a step and is counter to tradition.
3. That there would be as much politics connected with the selection of
the honorary and field captains as there is with some of the elections
under the present system.
The first contention of the opposition does not hold a great deal of
water. Even under the present plan the coach is undoubtedly the boss.
His word is law. If he wishes to bench a captain he can; but the psycho
logical effect is bad, and, therefore, he rarely does so.
Such politics as may appear when it comes time to elect the honorary
captain will not interfere with the working of the team. The season will
be over. There is rarely any wire-pulling when annually a medal is do
nated to the man on the track team whom the squad considers the most
valuable athlete. The cases will be parallel.
If we refuse to sanction a thing because it is a departure from custom,
how can we progress ?
THE EDITORIAL STAFF of the Daily Palo Alto will meet in
the office at 1 o'clock tomorrow.
