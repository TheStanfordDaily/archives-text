Nebraska men compete in beard cultivation contest. —News Item.
But Cabbages has a better one:
University of Alaska, June 1, 1950.—A silver loving cup was presented to
Oliver Dogwood, senior student in the university, as the prize for winning the
Finger and Toenail Contest, which closed last Saturday noon. Dogwood is
said to have had fingernails 6.5628 inches long and toenails 5.1127 inches, as
an average.
It is doubtful if this contest will be allowed next year, due to its possible
bad effects. One of the contestants, who does not wish his name published,
has just undergone a painful operation on his feet. It was found that seven
of his toenails were ingrowing.
