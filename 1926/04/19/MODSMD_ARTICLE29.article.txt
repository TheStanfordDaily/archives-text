# THE
						ETERNAL STRUGGLE
## 
### 
An inspiring melodrama depicting the heroic struggle of a
snake with a Hand-Painted Bath Towel
CHARACTERS
ONE SNAKE (In other words an ambitious young gentleman at a dance).
ONE HAND-PAINTED BATH TOWEL (111 other words a Spanish shawl).
ONE FAIR DAMSEL (In other words belonging to the aforesaid Spanish
shawl).
Scene One
A crowded campus dance floor. Time: The first dance.
(Our hero is seen dancing with the Fair Damsel plus the Hand-Painted
Bath Towel. The music stops and starts again. Our hero and heroine attempt
to clinch once more but our hero gets nothing but an armful of Hand-Painted
Towel. Three times he searches for the waist of our heroine under the
Hand-Painted Bath Towel. On the fourth attempt he is successful, but the
dance ends here.)
Scene Two
Same as scene one. Time: The second dance.
(As the music stops our hero tries to desist from his partner but, alas,
he finds his right arm hopelessly entangled in the treacherous fringe of the
Hand-Painted Bath Towel. The Fair Damsel tries to release him, but to no
avail. They both walk off the floor under the Hand-Painted Bath Towel.)
Scene Three
The fifth dance.
(All attempts to release the right arm of our hero from the clutches of
the Hand-Painted Bath Towel have proved fruitless, yet he dances valiantly
on, little realizing the terrible fate that awaits him. As tlie music stops, our
hero attempts to disentangle himself partially but he finds that his left arm
has become tied in a hard knot with the Hand-Painted Bath Towel.)
Scene Four
The eighth dance.
A moment later.
(Fair Damsel minus the Hand-Painted Bath Towel is seen wringing her
hands over a shapeless heap of rags on the floor. At times the remains of
Hand-Painted Bath Towel are seen to move perceptibly and groans inter
spersed with ever fainter cries of "Help" issue from it.)
Moral: Always be prepared (Use Keen Kutter). —Adv.
