## 
### 
Three Stanford debaters, Stanley A.
Wt<: ,11, George N. Crocker, and Fred
Combellack, will meet the California
team in the annual Medaille Joffre
debate tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in
WMfeeler auditorium on the Berkeley
campus.
The University of California will be
represented in the contest by Alvin
E. Weinberger, Ituth Clouse, and
Philip S. Broughton. By the rules of
the debate the general topic, "France
and the Locarno treaties," has been
announced, but contestants will not
know the specific question for the
debate until 6 o'clock tomorrow eve
ning.
Professor L. E. Bassett, head of the
Division of Public Speaking, originally
suggested the general topic, which has
been accepted by Professor E. Z.
Rowell, of the University of Cali
fornia. The medal is to be awarded to
the speaker presenting his argument
with the greatest debating merit. Each
debater will be competing individually
for his university instead of debating
with a team.
In order to encourage the study and
discussion of French history and poli
tics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, fol
lowing a visit to California in 1894,
has annually offered a gold medal,
cast in France, to the winner of the
debate between California and Stan
ford. It was originally called the Car
not Medal, in honor of the martyred
French president, but in 1917 was
changed to Medaille Joffre.
The specific question for the final
Stanford tryouts was: "In view of the
Locarno treaties, is France justified
in reducing armaments?" C. Craven
Scott is the Stanford alternate for the
debate, and Aileen McCandless is the
California alternate.
Henry A. Shinn, of the Public Speak
ing division, is coaching the Cardinal
squad and predicts that one of the
Stanford speakers will win the award.
