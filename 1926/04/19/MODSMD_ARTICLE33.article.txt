# DIARY OF OLD PADRE TELLS OF PALO ALTO AS EARLY CAMPSITE
## Ancient Tree Believed to Be Sapling When America Was Discovered 
### 
The Palo Alto, giant redwood tree
on the banks of San Francisquito
creek, from which this region took the
name, is no longer important as a
conspicuous landmark, as in the nine-
ties, but it is valuable as a living
survivor of historic days. It was the
scene of Indian ceremonies, it was a
prominent camping site in days of
Spanish explorations, and it is tied
with the traditions and memories of
Ihe early days of Stanford University.
Undoubtedly it is the oldest of the
trees around here. The Indians oF this
region in earlier days than explorers,
regarded it with such veneration that
not a part of it was harmed, and it
was chosen as a meeting place to set
tle strife by arbitration.
Through the diaries and documents
of the Spanish padres, there is evi-
dence that three famous expeditions
camped beneath it in their search for
sites for missions. The first of these ;
expeditions was lead by Don Gaspar j
de Portola, with the primary object
of taking possession of the port of
Monterey and fortifying it. They
missed this bay, however, and came
as far north as Point Reys before they ,
discovered their mistake. In their
diaries we find references to the giant
redwood in this region.
Like a Tower
In 1774 another group headed by
Rivers, passed through the country.
On their way to the San Francisco
bay, the explorers halted on the banks
of the San Francisquito creek. One of
the fathers, Father Palou, recounts
this in his diary—"Below the ford
stood a great redwood which could be
seen for more than a league, and
which from a distance looked like a
great tower."
Measurement of the tree at this time
showed a circumference of five yards
and a half. In 1914 Prof. R. L. Green,
of the Mathematics department, again
measured the tree and found an in-
crease of two feet in the girth. It was
estimated with this as a unit of cal-
culation that the tree was a sapling ;
when America was first discovered.
The tree was conspicuous as a land
mark above the low oak trees before
the introduction of eucalyptus and
served as a point for travelers through-
out the whole Santa Clara Valley. The
Spanish named it "Palo Alto" or "high '
tree" for this characteristic, and this
name was afterwards used by Senator
Stanford to the famous stock farm that
became the site of Stanford University.
Several years ago the tree, which
stands near the railroad track, was
in danger of sinking into the creek,
but it was reinforced with concrete.
In spite of these precautions, however,
the years of its preservation are be
coming rapidly fewer.

prominent camping site in days of
Spanish explorations, and it is tied
with the traditions and memories of
Ihe early days of Stanford University.
Undoubtedly it is the oldest of the
trees around here. The Indians oF this
region in earlier days than explorers,
regarded it with such veneration that
not a part of it was harmed, and it
was chosen as a meeting place to set
tle strife by arbitration.
Through the diaries and documents
of the Spanish padres, there is evi-
dence that three famous expeditions
camped beneath it in their search for
sites for missions. The first of these ;
expeditions was lead by Don Gaspar j
de Portola, with the primary object
of taking possession of the port of
Monterey and fortifying it. They
missed this bay, however, and came
as far north as Point Reys before they ,
discovered their mistake. In their
diaries we find references to the giant
redwood in this region.
Like a Tower
In 1774 another group headed by
Rivers, passed through the country.
On their way to the San Francisco
bay, the explorers halted on the banks
of the San Francisquito creek. One of
the fathers, Father Palou, recounts
this in his diary—"Below the ford
stood a great redwood which could be
seen for more than a league, and
which from a distance looked like a
great tower."
Measurement of the tree at this time
showed a circumference of five yards
and a half. In 1914 Prof. R. L. Green,
of the Mathematics department, again
measured the tree and found an in-
crease of two feet in the girth. It was
estimated with this as a unit of cal-
culation that the tree was a sapling ;
when America was first discovered.
The tree was conspicuous as a land
mark above the low oak trees before
the introduction of eucalyptus and
served as a point for travelers through-
out the whole Santa Clara Valley. The
Spanish named it "Palo Alto" or "high '
tree" for this characteristic, and this
name was afterwards used by Senator
Stanford to the famous stock farm that
became the site of Stanford University.
Several years ago the tree, which
stands near the railroad track, was
in danger of sinking into the creek,
but it was reinforced with concrete.
In spite of these precautions, however,
the years of its preservation are be
coming rapidly fewer.
The Palo Alto, giant redwood tree
on the banks of San Francisquito
creek, from which this region took the
name, is no longer important as a
conspicuous landmark, as in the nine-
ties, but it is valuable as a living
survivor of historic days. It was the
scene of Indian ceremonies, it was a
prominent camping site in days of
Spanish explorations, and it is tied
with the traditions and memories of
Ihe early days of Stanford University.
