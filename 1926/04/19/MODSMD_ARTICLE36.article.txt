# GLEE CLUB CONCERT PROVES INTERESTING AND WELL BALANCED
## "Dirge for Two Veterans" Is Most Effective Number On Program 
### Music Critic 
The Home Concert of the Stanford
Glee Club last Friday night more than
lived up to the expectations in almost
every particular; the soloists were
pleasing, and the Club itself sang with
spirit and finish. The repertoire offered
was interesting and well-balanced be
tween solo and choral numbers.
Harry Robertson, San Francisco
tenor, displayed a voice remarkable
for its flexibility and surprising vol
ume in a group of Italian songs. Mr.
Robertson had range and richness as
well as energy, but unfortunately
lacked a natural and easy stage pres
ence.
Dirge for Two Veterans
The most impressive feature of the
concert from the standpoint of its
tremendous effectiveness as well as
its novelty was the Club's rendition of
"Dirge for Two Veterans," a new num
ber by the noted English composer,
Gustav Holt. It was the first Western
performance of the work, so that it
was absolutely new to the entire audi
ence. From the moment when the first
blood-curdling harmonies swelled out
in accompaniment to the "the ghastly
phantom moon," until the last drum
beat and discordant bugle note died
away and the song closed with a note
of peace, it kept the audience on edge.
The words of the "Dirge" are from
the free verse poem by Walt Whitman.
The musical setting followed the de
scriptive variations of the poem faith
fully and with intensely effective real
ism. The constant beat of the bass
drum in the accompaniment gave a
powerful emotional appeal similar to
the tom-tom beat which is heard all
through O'Neill's play, "The Emperor
Jones."
Compelling Harmonies
"A Dirge for Two Veterans" seems
to be a great work because it accom
plishes its purpose of bringing home
to the hearer the gruesome and strik
ing effect of a double burial typifying
the horrible results of war. Other
choral numbers which followed on the
program seemed almost flat and tame
in comparison with the Dirge's radi
cally new but attention-compelling har
monies.
"Salterelle" was sung with vigor and
feeling for the many contrasting vari
ations from abandon to stately liymn
like solemnity and back again, as the
opening number.
"Improperia," by Palestrina, in the
second group, had some inspiring and
mystical harmonies.
"Hymn to Soma," the other Gustav
Hoist composition, was rather mysti
fying and fits into none of the usual
compartments in which choral music
is usually classified. It seemed to have
an odd element of humor of some sort
in its minor strains.
"Comin' Home"
"Comin' Home," on the final group
of club songs, was pretty in a conven
tional way. The finale from "The Gon
doliers" by Gilbert and Sullivan was
given with the snap and sparkle that
it demands.
Max Dolin played two light pieces,
"Indian Love Call" from "Rose Marie,"
and "Serenade" from "The Student
Prince" in a truly classical manner.
His graceful handling gave them a
dignity and depth of which these usual
popular numbers had never seemed
possessed.
Later in the program Mr. Dolin and
his cellist played "Ecstase" by Ganne
in a very satisfactory manner. "Hun
garian Rhapsodie" and "Spanish
Tango" as violin solos gave Dolin an
opportunity to show his easy technique
and smooth playing.
Of. the effort by Dolin's cellist to
render Kreisler's "Liebesfreud" the
less said the better. It could have been
omitted without the slightest loss.
