# COLLEGE STUDENTS VERY CONSERVATIVE DECLARES DR. JORDAN

### 
"College students are among the
most conservative people in the
world,'" declared Dr. Jordan at a re
cent meeting of Phi Beta Kappa at the
University of California. "They are
absolute worshipers of tradition, much
of which could well be forgotten. The
practice of freshmen wearing "dinks"
may be included in this class."
"The Trend of American Universi
ties" was the subject of Dr. Jordan's
talk in which he traced the history of
higher education in this country from
the early days when students had no
choice of subjects to the present time
when they have almost complete free
dom of election. Dr. Jordan character
ized this change as "for the better in
every way."
In commenting on present education
al systems, Dr. Jordan upheld the lec
ture system as opposed to the recita
tion method. He emphasized the fact,
however, that the lecture should not
be offered as a substitute for the text
book, but should give material that
cannot be found in books. "There is
a tendency among lecturers of the
present day to make lectures entertain
ing and thus to lose sight of the real
thought," he said.
This meeting of Phi Beta Kappa was
the first of a series in which the mem
bers will be addressed by educators
from other colleges and universities.
