# OREGON SEEKS NAME FOR ATHLETIC TEAMS
## 
### 
The University of Oregon is having
trouble in finding a name for its ath
letic teams. The Northerners object
to the name "Ducks," which has been
used extensively of late by California
sports writers because like the older
"Webfeet," it is derogatory, suggesting
an unhappy climate. What is more,
the duck as a species has never been
noted for the fighting courage and
never-say-die spirit that Orgeon teams
are expected to have.
The Oregonians want a label that
is sonorous, popular, capable of fitting
into harmony and cheers, and short
enough to aid head-writers. Finally, it
must have a quality that will spur the
university teams on to victory.
Some of the numerous ideas that
have been suggested to the Oregon
school by well-meaning supporters are
Red Men, Lumberjacks, Rangers,
Hawks, Bullwhackers, Wildcats, Sav
ages, Apaches, Malemutes, and
Wolves. The university, however, is
not satisfied with these names and is
still looking for suggestions.
Many students at the University of
lowa live at boarding houses where
only Spanish is spoken, in order to in
crease their knowledge of the lan
guage.
