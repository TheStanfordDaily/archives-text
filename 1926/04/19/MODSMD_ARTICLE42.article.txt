# SCHEDULE FOR R.O.T.C. SUMMER CAMP OUTLINED ORDNANCE STUDENTS TO HAVE SIX WEEKS' STUDY PLAN TO WORK AT CAMP LEWIS AND FORT CASEY
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
The schedule to be carried through
at the summer camp for Ordnance stu
dents has been outlined by Captain
Frank J. Atwood of the Ordnance de
partment. The camp will be held at
Camp Lewis, located on American
Lake, near Tacoma, Washington. From
there, where four weeks of the work
will be carried on, the students will go
to Fort Casey on Puget Sound for two
weeks of varied work.
This camp, which will open June 18
and close August 1, is instituted for
the summer instruction of Ordnance
department students of the University
of California and of Stanford since
these are the only two such units in
California. The summer camp work
will be under Captain Atwood, who
has been designated as director of
Ordnance training.
The first few days of training will
be spent in the Camp Lewis shops do
ing practical work on the maintenance
and repair of tractors. Later each stu
dent will be given an opportunity to
operate tractors and six-ton tanks.
The rifle marksmanship to be given
following these courses require a cer
tain number of rounds to be fired at
varying targets and in various posi
tions. Maintenance in the field will be
studied later.
Repairs Studied
The maneuvers will last two days
and students will be given practice in
operation of the mobile repair shop.
Equipment requiring repairs will be
taken along and mended in the field.
The next phase of the work will in
clude the firing of machine guns and
automatic rifles for the demonstration
ojf their method of operation. All firing
work will be done by the individual
student.
From here, the. instruction will be
transferred to Fort Casey, where fire

] control instruments will be studied.
Such instruments include range-find
ers, battery commander's telescopes,
plotting boards, range correction
boards, and others.
Muzzle Velocity Measured
The guns will be fired to determine
the muzzle velocity of the projectiles,
for which the chronograph will be
used. The maximum powder pressure
in the bore of the gun will also be
calculated, along with the rate of re
coil and counter-recoil. Problems con
cerning the effect on the range of guns
by successive percentage decreases in
the powder charges will be solved and
plotted. A night program of pyrotech
nics will be gone through, including
the firing of such illumination shells
as star shells, rockets, flares, and
tracer ammunition
The conclusion of the work at Fort
Casey will cover problems on hand
grenades, rifle grenades, and bombs.
After this, the classes will return to
Camp Lewis, where they will make an
inspection of all lthe storehouses and
shops and tests on the functioning of
75 millimeter gun materiel.
Detonation of Shells
Later work includes the detonation
of seventy-five mm., 155 mm., and
eight-inch Howitzer shells. These
shells will be placed in the open, and
fired by the setting off of high ex
plosives on the outside of them. Differ
ing amounts of explosives will be
i used, in order to determine how much
shock is required to detonate the dif
ferent shells. After the shells have
been exploded, the fragments will be
studied in order to see how the shells
burst on exploding.
. Included in the trip are several
pleasure excursions conducted by the
government, at government expense,
j among which is a trip to Mount
j Ranier, near Tacoma, Washington.
