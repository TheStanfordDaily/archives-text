# Northwestern Adopts Independent Study Plan
## 
### 
Seeking to give special considera
tion to superior students who desire
to major in a special subject with a
definite aim in view, Northwestern
University has adopted the independ
ent study plan for its upperclassmen.
Students who qualify will he exempt
from compulsory class attendance and
semester examinations in their major
subjects, but at graduation they will
be required to pass a comprehensive
examination in the major subject.
Under this plan a student must carry
at least half of his course in subjects
outside of his major field.
Northwestern has tried the plan in
a limited way this year, and its suc
cess has warranted the extending of
the plan to all upperclassmen who can
qualify.
Women at the University of Indiana
have been requested by the dean to
attend only one dance in an evening.
This action was taken to break up the
practice of attending dances to which
they had not been invited.
