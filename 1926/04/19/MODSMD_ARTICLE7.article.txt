# BRANNER I DEFEATS EL CUADRO TEAM IN HARD-FOUGHT GAME
## Work of Sigma Chi Battery Enables Row Team to Down Encina III 
### 
Intramural baseball suffered a slight
relapse Friday afternoon when three
of the scheduled eight teams neglected
to show up at the appointed hour. The
two games which were played, how
ever, made up fully in errors and
strikeouts for those that might have
been played. Branner triumphed over
El Cuadro by the narrow margin of a
6-4 score. The excitement waxed so
high in this contest that the game,
originally called at the end of the
fifth, was continued through the sev
enth by consent of the players.
El Cuadro practically sewed the
game up in (he second inning when
Smith, Fraser, and Nittler brought in
three runs. Branner retaliated in the
next inning by bringing in two men
and thus leaving their rivals with but
one point to spare in a 4-3 total. The
game dragged on into the sixth inning
with neither team succeeding in cross
ing the home plate.
At this point, Benepe, with the help
of a fair hit and three El Cuadro
errors, reached third base. Between
the time when the ball left the bat
and he reached third, Fry and Peter
son were able to get home and thus
gain the winning lead for Branner. All
El Cuadro's efforts failed, and another
Branner run left the final score 6-4.
The Sigma Chi-Encina 111 tilt was a
five-inning g;une devoid of thrills. De
spite evidences of spirited play, the
teams were only able to score one hit
apiece. Larsen and Brady of the Sigma
Chi squad came in for the lone two
runs of the game. Good work was
done by the Sigma Chi battery, com
posed of Dryden and Coleman. The
freshman pitching and catching was
in the hands of Smalling and Dunham.
Los Arcos won by default from Se
quoia 11. Kappa Sigs and Kappa Al
phas failed to appear.

originally called at the end of the
fifth, was continued through the sev
enth by consent of the players.
El Cuadro practically sewed the
game up in (he second inning when
Smith, Fraser, and Nittler brought in
three runs. Branner retaliated in the
next inning by bringing in two men
and thus leaving their rivals with but
one point to spare in a 4-3 total. The
game dragged on into the sixth inning
with neither team succeeding in cross
ing the home plate.
At this point, Benepe, with the help
of a fair hit and three El Cuadro
errors, reached third base. Between
the time when the ball left the bat
and he reached third, Fry and Peter
son were able to get home and thus
gain the winning lead for Branner. All
El Cuadro's efforts failed, and another
Branner run left the final score 6-4.
The Sigma Chi-Encina 111 tilt was a
five-inning g;une devoid of thrills. De
spite evidences of spirited play, the
teams were only able to score one hit
apiece. Larsen and Brady of the Sigma
Chi squad came in for the lone two
runs of the game. Good work was
done by the Sigma Chi battery, com
posed of Dryden and Coleman. The
freshman pitching and catching was
in the hands of Smalling and Dunham.
