# CAMPO DOWNS TORO NINE IN FAST CONTEST
## DELTA CHI TRIMS ENCINA Alpha Delts Outclass Delts By 14-4 Score in Five Innings of Play 
### 
The second week of intramural base
ball play opened yesterday, with El
Campo featuring, by virtue of a vic
tory over El Toro Club, 3-2. Clyde
Britten pitched steady ball for the
winners, allowing few hits, most of
which were well scattered. In addi
tion, he was responsible for two runs
in the third, when he tripled, scoring
McCullough, and later crossing the
plate himself.

Sherrill, El Toro shortstop, brought
in the first run of the game in the
opening inning, after having been hit
by a pitched ball and advanced to
third. He scored again in the third
frame, owing to favorable errors, and
the contest was deadlocked at 2-all
until the first of the seventh. At this
crucial point, Jones, El Campo third
sacker, hit safely and finally brought
in the winning run. Although Crever
broke loose with a two-base hit in the
last of the seventh, the rest of the El
Toro batters failed to rally, and
-Crever died on base.
Delts Battered

It required five innings of play for
the Alpha Delta Phi nine to gather
fourteen runs, which so completely
outweighed the four tallies that Delta
Tau Delta had collected in six times
at bat that when Umpire Negus halted
the game at 6 o'clock the teams de
cided to call it an afternoon.

Meyer, Delta Tau pitcher, was sadly
pounded by the Alpha Delt. batsmen.
Dennis, Alpha Delt twirler opposing
Meyer, walked off with the slugging
honors, with four hits in as many
times at bat. Wally Jayred did his
share of the clouting, making three
hits and walking once. Holman, Os-
borne, Fairchild, Duckett, Meeks, and
Miller all helped to complete the total
with good work at the bat.

The Delta Taus, although they were
favored by numerous errors, lacked
the punch to score consistently. Dow
ney brought in runs in the second and
fourth, Avhile Meyer hit safely and
stole his way around in the third, and
O'Neal scored in the fifth on a walk
and a succession of errors.
Delta Chi Wine

The hard-hitting Delta Chi nine
trampled on the weak Encina base
ment team, 15-2. Salsman, pitching
for the fraternity outfit, allowed but
one hit, while the two runs made by
the freshmen resulted from errors.
Sandys completed the Delta Chi bat
tery. McKeown and West pitched for
the losers.

Delta Chi made fourteen hits in six
innings. Slater did the heavy scoring,
making three runs. Hay's triple in the
second was a feature.

Alpha Sigma Phi failed to appear
for the second time this season, so
Sigma Nu was credited by the score
keepers with a 9-0 win through default.
Encina I likewise did not put in an
appearance at Sequoia for a game
scheduled with Alpha Tau Omega.

ment team, 15-2. Salsman, pitching
for the fraternity outfit, allowed but
one hit, while the two runs made by
the freshmen resulted from errors.
Sandys completed the Delta Chi bat
tery. McKeown and West pitched for
the losers.

Delta Chi made fourteen hits in six
innings. Slater did the heavy scoring,
making three runs. Hay's triple in the
second was a feature.

Alpha Sigma Phi failed to appear
for the second time this season, so
Sigma Nu was credited by the score
keepers with a 9-0 win through default.
Encina I likewise did not put in an
appearance at Sequoia for a game
scheduled with Alpha Tau Omega.

The second week of intramural base
ball play opened yesterday, with El
Campo featuring, by virtue of a vic
tory over El Toro Club, 3-2. Clyde
Britten pitched steady ball for the
winners, allowing few hits, most of
which were well scattered. In addi
tion, he was responsible for two runs
in the third, when he tripled, scoring
McCullough, and later crossing the
plate himself.

Sherrill, El Toro shortstop, brought
in the first run of the game in the
opening inning, after having been hit
by a pitched ball and advanced to
third. He scored again in the third
frame, owing to favorable errors, and
the contest was deadlocked at 2-all
until the first of the seventh. At this
crucial point, Jones, El Campo third
sacker, hit safely and finally brought
in the winning run. Although Crever
broke loose with a two-base hit in the
last of the seventh, the rest of the El
Toro batters failed to rally, and
-Crever died on base.
Delts Battered

It required five innings of play for
the Alpha Delta Phi nine to gather
fourteen runs, which so completely
outweighed the four tallies that Delta
Tau Delta had collected in six times
at bat that when Umpire Negus halted
the game at 6 o'clock the teams de
cided to call it an afternoon.

Meyer, Delta Tau pitcher, was sadly
pounded by the Alpha Delt. batsmen.
Dennis, Alpha Delt twirler opposing
Meyer, walked off with the slugging
honors, with four hits in as many
times at bat. Wally Jayred did his
share of the clouting, making three
hits and walking once. Holman, Os-
borne, Fairchild, Duckett, Meeks, and
Miller all helped to complete the total
with good work at the bat.

The Delta Taus, although they were
favored by numerous errors, lacked
the punch to score consistently. Dow
ney brought in runs in the second and
fourth, Avhile Meyer hit safely and
stole his way around in the third, and
O'Neal scored in the fifth on a walk
and a succession of errors.
Delta Chi Wine

The hard-hitting Delta Chi nine
