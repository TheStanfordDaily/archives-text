The second week of intramural base
ball play opened yesterday, with El
Campo featuring, by virtue of a vic
tory over El Toro Club, 3-2. Clyde
Britten pitched steady ball for the
winners, allowing few hits, most of
which were well scattered. In addi

in the third, when he tripled, scoring
McCullough, and later crossing the
plate himself.

Sherrill, El Toro shortstop, brought
in the first run of the game in the
opening inning, after having been hit

in the winning run. Although Crever
broke loose with a two-base hit in the
last of the seventh, the rest of the El
Toro batters failed to rally, and
-Crever died on base.
