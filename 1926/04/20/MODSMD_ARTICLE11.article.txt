# SEVEN TRACK STARS LOST TO 1927 TEAM THROUGH GRADUATION
## Seven California Letter Men Will Be Missing From Next Big Meet 
### Clif Moore 
Fourteen of the track and field stars
that contributed a great deal toward !
making last Saturday's meet the great
est contest in Stanford-California track
history, will not be among those en
tered when the two rival universities
clash in the Big Meet next year. Of
this number, seven will be lost to Cali
fornia through graduation, and seven
to Stanford by the same route.
Stanford will lose the most outstand
ing stars, however, when the sheep
skins are awarded at the end of this
year. Ted Miller and Bill Storie, Cardi
nal quarter-milers, will be absent when
next year's training starts. Miller and
Storie have finished ahead of practi
cally every 440 man 011 the coast for
the past two years. Miller set a new
Stanford-California record for his fa
vorite event last year in the Big Meet,
and this year came through with the
fastest race of his career to smash his
own record.
Richardson Graduates
Captain Bill Richardson, holder of
j the Stanford-California record for the
| half-mile, established when he defeat*
I ed his old rival, Elmer Boyden, in the
! Big Meet Saturday, will also be lost
to Templeton's squad. Richardson has
made an impressive record while com
peting for Stanford, and in addition to
setting a new 880' mark Saturday, also
hung up a record in the American in
tercollegiate half-mile race when he
was in the East two years ago.
Stanford loses two men in * the
sprints, Erskine Coverly aiul Louis
Caspar. Coverly, running for the first
time in a Big Meet, came through with
a second place in the 220. Caspar
proved that he can be counted upon
to take points by placing third in both
the furlong and century last Saturday.
Macßae Through

Dick Macßae, for two an out
standing performer in the broad jump,
has competed for the last time against
California. The Cardinal jumper
cinched Saturday's meet for Stanford
when he beat out his teammate, Meeks,
and his opponent, Bondshu of Califor
nia, in the deciding event of the day.
Macßae was given the same oppor
tunity last year and he came through
with a leap that won first place and a
victory for Stanford.
Chuck Harlow, stellar Stanford
javelin thrower, is another first-place
man who will be gone next year. Har
low tossed the spear 191 feet 2 inches
Saturday, the best mark that has been
recorded by a Stanford javelin thrower
for some time.

Bill Kerr Goes
Bill Kerr, one of the best mile run
ners on the coast, is the last of the
stars that will be lost this year. Kerr
has been a regular first-place winner
all season, losing only to the Califor
nia ace, Schwobeda, last Saturday.
Captain Phil Barber heads the list
of the graduating Californians. Bar
ber won both the 100 and 220 from
Stanford, and is credited with setting
a new record in the century.
California's superiority in the pole
vault will suffer greatly, due to the
loss of Hill and Garner, regular place
winners for three years. Hill made
one of the finest exhibitions of Satur
day when he leaped 12 feet 11 3-4
inches to set a new Bear-Card record
for his event.

Alva Ragan, star hurdler, will also
graduate this year. Elmer Bondshu,
California's best broad-jumper, and
Verne Dodson, javelin-thrower, have
likewise competed.in the Big Meet for
the last time. Dana Carey, veteran
football star and discus-thrower, com
pletes the list of graduating track ath
letes.

The loss of these prominent track
men will be made up for by a number
of stellar performers coming to the
rival varsities from this year's fresh
man teams. The freshman athletes are
not of the same high caliber as the
graduating stars, however, and the
records established last Saturday are
liable to stand for several years.
