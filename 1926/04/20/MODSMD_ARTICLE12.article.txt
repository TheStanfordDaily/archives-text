# CARDINAL SWIMMERS TRAIN FOR PACIFIC CHAMPIONSHIP RACES
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers will compete in
the Pacific Coast championships to be
held at Fleishacker Pool, San Fran
cisco, in the near future to be decided
soon. Only two of the five paddlers
who won second place for the Cardinal
in the Intercollegiate championships
are registered this quarter. They are
Dave Fall, diver and captain of the
swimming team, who won second place
in the A.A.U. diving competition in
Chicago early this month, and Carl
Stevenson, varsity distance man.

Wallace O'Connor, who copped both
the 440- and 220-yard free style inter
collegiate titles at Annapolis, Arden
Allen, backstroke and breaststroke
star, and Bob Williams, 50- and 100-
yard man, have all taken out leaves
for this quarter so will be ineligible
to compete for Stanford.

In three events, however, the Cards
stand a good chance for first place.
These are the 500-yard f.-ee style,
which Stevenson should true if he is
in his best form, the diving which
ought to go to Fall, and the breast
stroke event in which Cecil West, the

phenomenal freshman sailor-style
swimmer, is expected to figure. West
has been making some remarkable
times especially in the longer dis
tances. He can cut 1:15 for the 100-
yard swim and 3:10 for the 220, which
should enable him to place in the best
Pacific Coast competition.
