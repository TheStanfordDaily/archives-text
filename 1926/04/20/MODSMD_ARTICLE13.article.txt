fornia, and Stanford, and various Cali
fornia and Stanford national clubs,
and Y.W.C.A.'s and Y.M.C.A.'s who

Official steps taken then follow an
unofficial endorsement of the plan by
representatives from Mills, California,
and Stanford, who met at Berkeley

meeting of April 6 met with the ap
proval of the various clubs, the repre

tional department of the University
of California Y.M.C.A., is secretary of
the council.

With the formation of a sponsoring
council, definite plans for a Northern
California Student Institute on Pacific
Relations were drawn up by repre
sentatives of the Cosmopolitan Clubs
of Mills, College of the Pacific, Cali
fornia, and Stanford, and various Cali
fornia and Stanford national clubs,
and Y.W.C.A.'s and Y.M.C.A.'s who
met Sunday at the University of Cali
fornia.
Official steps taken then follow an
unofficial endorsement of the plan by
representatives from Mills, California,
and Stanford, who met at Berkeley
April 6. After the action taken at the
meeting of April 6 met with the ap
proval of the various clubs, the repre
sentatives were able to make official
arrangements for the Institute which
will be held sometime next fall, ac
cording to present plans.
Council Chosen
The representatives who met Sun
day resolved themselves into a spon
soring council which will have general
supervision of the conference. Kazuo
Kawai, representative Of the Stanford
Japanese Club, was chosen chairman
of the sponsoring council, and William
P. Stallings, secretary of the interna
tional department of the University
of California Y.M.C.A., is secretary of
the council.

A general arrangements committee
of eleven members was appointed.
This committee consists of two sub
committees of five members each, a

program committee and a group to
take care of the business of the con
ference. The chairman of the council
is an ex-officio member of both com
mittees.

The general purpose of the confer
ence, which is similar in character and
object to the Institute on Pacific Rela
tions held in Honolulu last July, is to
present facts relative to the present
conditions in the countries bordering
the Pacific in order to discuss from a
real fact background the difficulties
between nations and races with a view
to stimulating and crystallizing stu
dent thought on these issues.
Meet May 9
Membership in the conference is
open to those student organizations
on any college campus which are in
terested in problems of the Pacific and
specifically those which by official ac
tion have agreed to support the pro
posed student institute. Both San Jose
State Teachers College and St. Mary's
have evidenced interest in the confer
ence, although no official action has
been taken by either college.
