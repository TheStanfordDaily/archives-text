# Breeze, Boutell Choose Title For '25 Junior Opera
## 
### 
"Ride a Cock-Horse" was announced
last evening by Tommy Breeze and
Harry Boutell as the title for the 1925
Junior Opera which will be presented
in the Stanford Assembly hall Satur
day evening, May 8.

Breeze and Boutell, the co-authors
of the opera script, were faced with
many difficulties in selecting a title
which would harmonize with the spirit
of the play. After careful considera
tion, the two finally selected "Ride a
Cock-Horse," also the appellation of
a nursery rhyme and English marshall
song, as the title for the annual Jun
ior Class production.

The action of "Ride a Cock-Horse"
takes place early in the Nineteenth
Century, the period in which the old
social and economic life of England
was changing into the complexities of
the present day. England at that time
was politically divided into a great
many rural districts with no strong
centralized government, thus permit
ting the existance of numerous marau
ding bands who terrorized the shires
within their spheres of activity. These
bands of Night-riders, comparable in
many ways to the Ku Klux Klans of
the United States at the post-Civil
War period, form the nucleus for the
plot of "Ride a Cock-Horse."

Particularly comparable to present
times were the criticisms of the young
er generation by the older parents,
condemnations similar in character to
the condemnations of the youth of to
day. During the Nineteenth Century
period of transition in Great Britain,
the people of the disappearing rural
communities were notably officious in
disparaging the long pants, short hair,
and novel actions of the youth of that
time, their actions and mode of liv
ing being a striking contrast to the
wigs, hoop-skirts, and stilted manners
of the elder residents.
