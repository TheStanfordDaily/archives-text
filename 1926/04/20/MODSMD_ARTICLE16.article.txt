Bids are now out and final plans
have been announced for the Encina
Club sport dinner dance that will be
held Friday night. According to Pow
ell Carpenter, chairman of the dance
committee, a five-course dinner will
be served from 7 to 9 o'clock. Dancing
to the music of Chubby Tyroler's
seven-piece orchestra will occupy the
time between 9 and 1.

A special menu has been arranged
for the dinner by Miss Evelyn A.
Chase, who has charge of Encina Com
mons. Tables will be laid in dining
halls two, three, and eight. Red and
yellow candles will furnish the illumi
nation for the dinner, and will also
carry out the color scheme that is to
be used in the dining halls.

Brown and yellow form the motif
that will be used in the lobby where
the dance is to be held. A crystal ball
will be centered and will be played
upon by four spot lights. Red canoes
are to be hung from the ceiling, and
indirect lighting will be used to create
the effect desired. The programs fur

Flannels, knickers, and light spring
suits will be the garb to wear for the
evening.

bur are among those who have con
sented to act as patrons and patron
