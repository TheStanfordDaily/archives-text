# Music and the Curriculum
## 
### 
Queries concerning the possibility of a Department of Music at Stan
ford are constantly arising in the University. Many feel that sufficient
progress has been made in other departments to warrant a cessation of
activity in that direction and a movement toward the incorporation of
Music into the present curriculum.
If it were possible, the triumvirate of Architecture, Music, and
Art would indeed be a welcome addition to the field of intellectual en
deavor now presented for the four-year consideration of the students of
the University. In such a community as ours, and surrounded by well
developed schools of Law, Engineering, and the Sciences, the student with
a more aesthetic turn of intellect finds himself cheated and disappointed to
a certain degree. Even those absorbed in their profession would appre
ciate the chance for extra study in Harmony, or greater latitude of choice
in Art and Architecture.
It is no fault of the Administration, however, that there can be no
satisfaction for those so inclined. President Wilbur and the Board of
Trustees feel deeply this gap in their curriculum and their inability to im
prove along this line the cultural existence of the youth of Stanford. Their
thoughts, perhaps, are reflected in the writings of Dr. Eugene A. Noble,
secretary of the Juilliard Musical Foundation, in which he has said that
the purpose of a "liberal college" is "to relate a student to one of the great
interests of life, to help him into more spacious appreciation, to make his
Alma Mater more benign in liberating his spirit, something of this sort
the college should try to do."
The desires of the Administration cannot be crystallized into immedi
ate action, however. As to all other great projects, financial aid is import
ant and at present none is in sight. Other ambitious building programs
have been "on the table" for years with little prospect of their being
brought to a head until outside help can lie secured. Until the winds of
good fortune blow financial relief there can be little realization of many of
the plans for improvements in curriculum or building.
This is the sad but true answer to all our queries.
