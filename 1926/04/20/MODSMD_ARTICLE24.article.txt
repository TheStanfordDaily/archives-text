# A 						Success

Three years ago the.Stanford Spectator, the last semblance of a campus
literary magazine, passed from existence, financially embarrassed and a
self-confessed failure. Shortly following its demise plans were advanced
for the formation of another literary magazine; but naturally enough the
project met with disfavor. The Spectator had left a poor impression both
on the commissioners of the exchequer and those who appreciated literary
work.
The beginning of this year found two groups presenting plans to the
Executive Committee for the foundation of a magazine—a fortunate situ
ation, for the rivalry partially obliterated the unpleasantness of past lit
erary ventures. The Executive Committee effected a compromise be
tween the groups; and, after the financial feasibility of the scheme had
been assured, gave it sanction.
Today the fifth issue appeared on the campus. At the outset it was
optimistically predicted that the circulation of the periodical would be 600
copies; but by now the presses are running 1,000 copies monthly, and the
book is materially larger.
The Lit has made a place for itself on the campus, and every issue
brings with it improvements. The editor and manager are to be con
gratulated,
FROM A TAMPA, FLORIDA, NEWS RELEASE we learn that a
Utopian colony for artists and scientists is being projected, and that Dr.
Jordan has agreed to join the colony. From Dr. Jordan we learn that he
has no such intentions, and that Stanford is sufficiently ideal.
It's bad enough to have Florida capitalizing on names of localities which
California has made famous. To be robbed of one or its few renowned
men would be the last straw.
Heavenward march of the American universities, as noted in the
Oberlin Review.
"There arc $10.00 worth of cigarets smoked on the campus every year," said Dr.
Allen W. Porter, prominent educator, "but in my time the students did worse —they
chewed. The most miserable time I ever spent while -in college was trying to get
away from those who were drunk."
Quite true, Editor, quite true. The editorial column of the great
Michigan Daily:
"Opening of the Union swimming pool ot the use of women students during cer
tain hours, should, by increasing interest, have a stimulating effect upon swimming
and aquatic sports generally."
