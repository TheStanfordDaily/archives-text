## HISTORY OF THE McCUBBIN CLAN FLASH

TEHERAN, Persia, April 10. —The Man has bitten the Dog!
Prof. John MeCubbin, leader of the Smithsonian Institute's expedition
into the Arabian desert in search of the lost Something New Under the Sun,
this morning leaped from his breakfast table in the Hotel Metropole here,
hurled a water decanter through a cut-glass chandelier with a scream of

i v- ui biuoo v.,uauuciici n uu c* v.«iu wi
elation and, dropping his pith helmet, put
a cup of hot coffee on his head as he ran
into the main street.
Here he seized the first dog his eye
fell upon, a St. Bernard belonging to
Albert Trauss, attache at the Patagonian
legation. With a fiendish glint in his eye,
Prof. McCubbin gripped the animal by
the left hind foot and flourished it in the
air with an ecstatic shout, according to
witnesses, and then bit a medium-sized
piece out of the dog's ankle.
At a late hour today it was doubtful
whether or not Julius, the dog, would
live.
Prof. McCubbin is in jail on a charge
of attempting to evade the restaurant
tax, awaiting a filing of charges by Mr.
Trauss. Authoritative diplomatic sources
give forth the information that severance
of relations between the United States
and Patagonia is imminent as a result of
the incident.
When interviewed in his cell, Prof.
McCubbin sobbed, "I did it because I
am a failure —a disgrace to my family.
"I never have done anything notable,
whereas other members of my family,
blessed with more colorful personalities,

send me newspaper clippings of articles about themselves which appear
almost every day."
The professor admitted that he was led to commit the outrage at the
recollection, in a particularly despondent moment, of the definition of "news"
once given a cub reporter by a famous journalist.
"I could not bear to be considered an inferior MeCubbin!"
The interview was here closed by the shout of "Nyrts" (Persian term
meaning "So's your old man") from the jailer, who up to this time had taken
no part in the conversation. —H.B.R.
