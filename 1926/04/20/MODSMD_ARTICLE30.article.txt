# WEATHER PREDICTING IS NOW A SCIENCE SAYS FATHER RICARD
## Famous Santa Clara Padre Bases System on Sun Spot Occurence 
### 
"Weather is being forecast for sev
eral months ahead at Santa Clara Uni
versity, and it is being done on a scien
tific basis," declared Father Rlcard,
"the padre of the rains," in a talk on
"Weather and Weather Forecasting"
given last night under the auspices of
the Civil Engineering Society.

The basis used by Father Ricard and
his associates in preparing their pre
dictions is amazing to those who are
unaccustomed to the conventional
forecasts made by the United States
Weather Bureau which cover at most
eight or ten hours in advance. Father
Rieard's method is based upon the ob
servation of sun spots. Not only is rain
predicted from the sunspots but a
method has been developed whereby
the sfcots themselves are predicted.

Study Is Thorough

"My study has been long and tho
rough," said Father Rioard. "Every
fact has been checked again and again,
and when contradictions to our theo
ries have been found, the theories have
been discarded. I am now positive that
we have revealed fundamental natural
laws in our work."

The first significant fact discovered
was that there is a definite correla
tion between rainfall and sun spots.
The annual rainfall curves plotted
against the curves showing the number
of spots on the surface of the sun
each year were found to run almost
exactly parallel.

Father Ricard found that the ap
pearance of a spot on the central me
ridian of the sun was almost certain
to be followed by a storm, or, as a
storm is more properly called, an "area
of low pressure." Although the fact
is not generally known, the sun re
volves on its axis. A complete turn
takes about twenty-seven days, as
time is measured from the earth. By
watching the edges of the sun's disk
spots will be seen to appear about six
and one-half days before they cross
the central meridian of the "orb of
day." Predictions of almost a week in
advance could be made by this method.

Heat Predicted

Father Ricard, always testing and
criticizing his results, soon found some
discrepancies which led to another
startling discovery. Often the passage
of a spot across the central meridian
would be accompanied by the reverse
of a storm, an area of high pressure
which in summer means a spell of hot
weather, and in winter a cold snap.
The astronomer discovered that only
spots passing across the northern or
"upper" hemisphere of the sun pro
duced the storms; those which were
in the southern or "lower" half gave
rise to the "counter-storms" or high
pressure areas. To substantiate these
results Father Ricard made an ex
haustive study of hundreds of weather
maps and sun spot charts for periods
of many years.

Forecasts Months Ahead
"Still we were not satisfied," said
Father Ricard. "With this method we
could predict accurately storms for
six days ahead, but this was not
enough. To help the ranchers and
farmers as they should be helped we
had to be able to go further into the
future than that. It was found that
sun spots originate in a very definite
way: when two or more planets of the
solar system are in line on the same
side of the sun, or are in line on oppo
site sides, spots will be originated at
those points where a line drawn
through the planets and the center of
the sun intersects the sun's surface.

Astronomical tables which predict
the position of the planets for years
ahead were used and special formulas
developed under Father Ricard's
supervision, told the experimenters
both when and where on the sun spots
were due to develop.

This forecasting of yet unexistent
sun spots is the secret of the new
weather forecasting which does not
hesitate to predict a storm one month
or two or even three ahead. Knowing
whore the spots are going to appear
in any given month the calculators
then proceed to find just when they
will he directly opposite the earth and
whether they will he in the sun's
northern or southern hemisphere.
Since large spots often persist for sev

eral rotations of the suns these are
figured in.
Old School Scoffs
The moon, which has such a marked
tidal effect on the ocean, also pro
duces tides in the atmosphere which
have an influence on the high and low
pressure areas. Occasionally a storm,
which normally should cross the Pa
cific Coast and continue eastward, will
become unruly and curve back toward
its starting point, thus throwing a
new element into the predictions.

Father Ricard stated that many of
the old school of weather prophets
scoff at his methods and results but
he claims he has built his theory upon
a scientific foundation and can bring
evidence to his support.

a scientific foundation and can bring
evidence to his support.
"Weather is being forecast for sev
eral months ahead at Santa Clara Uni
versity, and it is being done on a scien
tific basis," declared Father Rlcard,
"the padre of the rains," in a talk on
"Weather and Weather Forecasting"
given last night under the auspices of
the Civil Engineering Society.

The basis used by Father Ricard and
his associates in preparing their pre
dictions is amazing to those who are
unaccustomed to the conventional
forecasts made by the United States
Weather Bureau which cover at most
eight or ten hours in advance. Father
Rieard's method is based upon the ob
servation of sun spots. Not only is rain
predicted from the sunspots but a
method has been developed whereby
the sfcots themselves are predicted.

Study Is Thorough

"My study has been long and tho
rough," said Father Rioard. "Every
fact has been checked again and again,
and when contradictions to our theo
ries have been found, the theories have
been discarded. I am now positive that
we have revealed fundamental natural
laws in our work."

The first significant fact discovered
was that there is a definite correla
tion between rainfall and sun spots.
The annual rainfall curves plotted
against the curves showing the number
of spots on the surface of the sun
each year were found to run almost
exactly parallel.

Father Ricard found that the ap
pearance of a spot on the central me
ridian of the sun was almost certain
to be followed by a storm, or, as a
storm is more properly called, an "area
of low pressure." Although the fact
is not generally known, the sun re
volves on its axis. A complete turn
takes about twenty-seven days, as
time is measured from the earth. By
watching the edges of the sun's disk
spots will be seen to appear about six
and one-half days before they cross
the central meridian of the "orb of
day." Predictions of almost a week in
advance could be made by this method.

Heat Predicted

Father Ricard, always testing and
criticizing his results, soon found some
discrepancies which led to another
startling discovery. Often the passage
of a spot across the central meridian
would be accompanied by the reverse
of a storm, an area of high pressure
which in summer means a spell of hot
weather, and in winter a cold snap.
The astronomer discovered that only
spots passing across the northern or
"upper" hemisphere of the sun pro
duced the storms; those which were
in the southern or "lower" half gave
rise to the "counter-storms" or high
pressure areas. To substantiate these
results Father Ricard made an ex
haustive study of hundreds of weather
maps and sun spot charts for periods
of many years.

Forecasts Months Ahead
"Still we were not satisfied," said
Father Ricard. "With this method we
could predict accurately storms for
six days ahead, but this was not
enough. To help the ranchers and
farmers as they should be helped we
had to be able to go further into the
future than that. It was found that
sun spots originate in a very definite
way: when two or more planets of the
solar system are in line on the same
side of the sun, or are in line on oppo
site sides, spots will be originated at
those points where a line drawn
through the planets and the center of
the sun intersects the sun's surface.

Astronomical tables which predict
the position of the planets for years
ahead were used and special formulas
developed under Father Ricard's
supervision, told the experimenters
both when and where on the sun spots
were due to develop.

This forecasting of yet unexistent
sun spots is the secret of the new
weather forecasting which does not
hesitate to predict a storm one month
or two or even three ahead. Knowing
whore the spots are going to appear
in any given month the calculators
then proceed to find just when they
will he directly opposite the earth and
whether they will he in the sun's
northern or southern hemisphere.
Since large spots often persist for sev

eral rotations of the suns these are
figured in.
Old School Scoffs
The moon, which has such a marked
tidal effect on the ocean, also pro
duces tides in the atmosphere which
have an influence on the high and low
pressure areas. Occasionally a storm,
which normally should cross the Pa
cific Coast and continue eastward, will
become unruly and curve back toward
its starting point, thus throwing a
new element into the predictions.

Father Ricard stated that many of
the old school of weather prophets
scoff at his methods and results but
he claims he has built his theory upon
a scientific foundation and can bring
evidence to his support.
