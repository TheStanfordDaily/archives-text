# DESK EDITOR SYSTEM INTRODUCED BY QUAD
## 
### 
In a reorganization of the Quad edi
torial staff, the literary and assistant
editorships have been supplanted by a
system of desk editors, similar to that
used by the Daily Palo Alto. Two new
editors take the desk each week, cov
ering a period of six weeks. The desk
editors appointed are members of the
sophomore staff of the Quad.

For the first week the desk editors
were Robert S. Frazee and Margaret
L. Wood, and for the second week
Jack W. Shoup and Jean C. Stewart.
This week Martin J. Weil and Mar
garet Olsen will be at the desk. The
desk editors for the following two
weeks will be Gustave A. Mueller and
Judith E. Johnson, Herbert Reynolds
and Lucia B. Champlin, and for the
last week, Lynn A. White.

The class, fraternity, and adminis
tration sections of the Quad have gone
to press. Emphasis will be laid in this
edition of the year book on the two
big victories this year over California
in football and track. It was originally
planned to have 480 pages, but an addi
tion of eight or sixteen pages is ex
pected to be made. The Quad is being
printed at the H. S. Crocker Company
plant in San Francisco.
