# Europe, America To Be Compared By Frank Golder
## 
### 
"Europe and America" is the topic
of a lecture to be given by Professor
Frank A. Golder of the History de
partment in the Little Theatre at 7:30Â«
o'clock tonight. Golder recently re
turned from a trip in Europe, where
he has been studying political, social,
and economic conditions.

"Many people in Europe are begin
ning to question whether or not there
is too much education there," said
Golder in an interview yesterday.
"Those who hold this belief base their
conclusions on the fact that there are
not enough positions open for edu
cated people."
Aristocratic Students Fewer
University education in Europe is
not as aristocratic as it was before
the war when it was in a large part
made up of student bodies coming
from the well-to-do families and the
nobility. The war has impoverished
the upper classes, improved the con
dition of the lower classes, and as a
result more children of the working
people are in the universities today
than ever before.

"Although these economical changes
have made it possible for education
to reach more people, the quality of
education has not improved since the
war," declared Golder.

"European students are more seri
ous than are American students be
cause in part the struggle for exist
ence is more keen and they are more
interested in political and economic
conditions than are we. Students in

Europe are preparing for positions
calling for highly educated attain
ments, and the competition for these
places is so sharp that only the best
have a chance.

Practical Work Emphasized
"Owing to the poverty of Europe
and the demand for specialists, there
is a tendency in European universi
ties, especially on the continent, to
neglect cultural studies and concen
trate more and more on practical sub
jects. In America, on the other hand,
because of greater wealth and leisure,
the drift is in the opposite direction,
and American universities are empha
sizing the need of a good general edu
cation before graduate work is taken
up," said Golder.

Since the war more university doors
have been opened to women in Eu
rope. There are now more Americans
there studying cultural subjects than
there were before the war, while the
Europeans who come to America are
pursuing technical studies.

As compared with American univer
sities the European schools are not so
well equipped either in library or
laboratory facilities.
