# WAGEEARNERS ARE IN NEED OF TRAINING, CLAIMED BY SPEAKER
## 
### 
"Worker's Education" was the topic
of Sydney Herbert, who spoke be
fore the Education Club at 8 o'clock
last night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Herbert, a lecturer to the Wilson
Chair of International Politics at the
University of Wales, told of the means
of educating the poorer classes
throughout England and Wales.

Stating that "so far as the mass of
wage earners are concerned they
never advanced further than the pri
mary schools until five years ago
when attendance began to be en
forced." Herbert explained that "this
means that the working classes as a
whole are imperfectly educated at a
time when the strain on them is great
er than ever before.

"When democracy really comes into
its own, it will mean that the people
are assuming the nation's problems,
thinking about them, and working
them out."

Desire to encourage this attitude,
and to interest the people during their
spare time led to formation of the
Workingmen's Educational Association
by means of which men and women
may have presented to them for study
and discussion any subject in which
they are interested. Herbert went on
to enlarge upon this plan of educa
tion, stressing the democratic aspect
of the conduct of each class.

The next and last meeting of the
Education Club for this year will be
on May 3 in the Clubhouse, when the
speaker will be the Superintendent of
Schools of San Francisco, Joseph Marr
Gwiun.
