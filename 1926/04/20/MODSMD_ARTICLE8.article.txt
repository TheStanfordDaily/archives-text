# DR. ANDERSON WRITES TEXTBOOK ON EARLY FRENCH LITERATURE
## 
### 
"Illustrations of Early French Liter
ature" is the title of a new textbook
prepared by Dr. Frederick Anderson,
assistant professor of French. The
book is to be used in the outline course
in French literature taught by Dr.
Anderson.

Selections representing French lit
erature between the years 1100 and
1600 have been chosen for the book.
The text is divided into two parts: the
literature of the Middle Ages, and that
of the sixteenth century. The selec
tions in the first part are grouped as
narrative poems, lyric poetry, prose,
and drama. A comprehensive survey
of the medieval literature of France
is thus provided.

The textbook was prepared by Dr.
Anderson in response to the need for
such an anthology for the use of stu
dents who are entering introductory
courses in French literature after two
years of French. The spelling has been
changed from Old French to the mod
ern forms in order to simplify transla
tion. The rhythm, word order, and
syntax found in the original medieval
texts have been preserved.

The new textbook is being published
by Ginn and Company, and will be
used in the Stanford French depart
ment next year.
