ond, brought the Fijis their four tal
lies. Chase and Adams with two and

The Betas made their hits count in
winning from the Fijis. Eight hits
brought eight runs for the winners,
while Herrington allowed only five
hits and four runs to the Fijis. The
game was anybody's until the end of
the fifth, when the Betas established a
definite lead and clung to it.
Watt, Beta catcher, played an out
standing game behind the bat, and in
addition scored two runs. Montgomery,
third baseman, hit three times, once
for two bases, and made his swats
count for runs. Palette, Mannoccir,
and Tibbe each contributed to the
score.
Boynton and Elliott in the first in
ning, and Blazier and Long in the sec
ond, brought the Fijis their four tal
lies. Chase and Adams with two and
Pliilippi with one accounted for their
team's five hits.
Theta Xi Defeated
Theta Xi started strong but finished
weak in its game with Chi Psi. At the
conclusion of the first inning, the
teams were even with three runs
apiece, and the Theta Xi's had outhit
their opponents four to two. But the
Chi Psi's kept improving, scoring one
run in the second, two in the third,
four in the fourth, and one in the sixth.
They gathered twelve hits, one of
which, by Reeves, was a double. Theta
Xi, although they found Van King for
seven hits, could not seem to stretch
them into runs. Ankele, Reeves,
Pierce, and Walker for Chi Psi, and
Anderson and Freeman for Theta Xi
did good batting.
Phi Sigma Kappa and S.A.E. teams
forfeited their games.

vs. Kappa Sigma, II; El Tigre vs.

El Capitan defeated the D.U.'s, 6-2,
the Betas rallied in the fifth to beat
Phi Gamma Delta, 8-4, and the Chi
Psi's crushed Theta Xi, 11-3, in yes
terday's intramural baseball contests.
The day's play was marked by a
noticeable improvement in the brand
of ball displayed. Canfield, El Capitan
moundsman, deserves credit for skill
ful work in turning in a victory over
the D.U.'s. The latter fought hard to
rally after El Capitan had partaken
in a batting orgy in the third inning
and led 6-1, but Canfield held them
down to one run in the seventh, scored
by Harry Maltby.
Dick Hyland pitched for the fra
ternity team, but he weakened in the
third, and Canfield, Fain, Fagg, Read,
and Noble crossed the plate in quick
succession. Robertson scored the first
D.U. run in the third, coming in on
an error.
