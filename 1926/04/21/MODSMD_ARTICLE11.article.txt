nine points and tied for second place.

was, "Resolved, That the Locarno

best protection for her security obtain
able under the circumstances." Fred
Combellack, Stanford, upheld the nega

Crocker took the affirmative.
Miss Clouse, who argued for the
affirmative, was the first speaker of
the evening and won the award when
two of the three judges gave her first
place. The clear and interesting de
livery of her fifteen-minute argument
and rebuttal made her the first woman

years. She is president-elect of the
California women's debating society.
Combellack was awarded fourth
place by the judges and is the only
one of the three Stanford debaters
who will be eligible next year. The
judges for the contest were W. A.
Beasley, San Francisco attorney; Pro
fessor Muirhead, visiting professor at
the University of California; and
Judge J. P. Ralston, former member
of The Hague Tribunal. Dean Monroe
E. Deutsch, of the University of Cali
fornia, was chairman of the debate.
The specific topic for the speakers
was formulated by Professor Potter
of the University of Wisconsin and
was sent to President Wilbur. It was
announced from the steps of Boalt hall
on the Berkeley campus two hours
before last night's debate.
