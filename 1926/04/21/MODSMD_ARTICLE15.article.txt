# CARDINAL PADDLERS SCHEDULE DUAL MEET WITH SAN JOSE TEAM
## 
### Herb Klein 
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic
sports, has accepted an invitation
from the San Jose alumni swimming
team for a meet with the Stanford
swimmers, on April 30, in their pool.
The ranks of the Card paddlers who
will make the trip will be sadly de
pleted compared with the team that
could have been mustered at the end
of last quarter. A Stanford victory
seems probable in spite of the absence
of three of the University's most valu
able swimmers.
Carl Stevenson, who is training for
the Pacific Coast 500-yard title to be
held at the Fleishhacker pool in the
near future, will be in form to win
the 220 free style in the San Jose meet.
Ted Smith, who placed second in the
100-yard free style in the California-
Stanford meet, has not lost any speed
since that time and should take the
dorsal style event.
Brandsten has several first-class
sprinters from which to choose his
entries in the 50 and 100 free style and
the relay team. Tbil Brooks, Bob Har
ris, Kryne Van den Akker, and Bill
Danford can all do a 50 in about 26
seconds or better. They should make
a relay team which can average
around 16 seconds per lap for each
man.
San Jose has a real comer in Willis,
who is a first class breast-stroker, and
has also made some good times in
back-stroke lately. Wagner, who won
the breast-stroke in the California-
Stanford meet, will probably be
Brandsten's entry. It is not known
whether freshman swimmers will be
eligible in this meet. If they are, Cecil
West, the babe breast-stroke marvel,
will be a great help to the Cards. The
sailor-style event will probably be one
of the most hotly contested on the
program, for Willis is a hard man to
leave behind.
Dave Fall, captain of the swimming
team, will have a clear field in the
diving event.
Wally O'Connor. Arden Allen, and
Bob Williams will be missed for their
abilities in the various events at
which they excel.
