## 
### 
Gold and black will be the standard ;
colors for fiesta advertising displays !
and posters, the publicity committee
decided at its meeting last night. A
hundred large posters will be printed
this week-end for the pageant. They
will be used in shop windows, and on !
bulletin boards throughout the Bay
region. Windshield stickers for motor
cars will be made in the same colors.
Slides advertising the pageant will j
be shown in Peninsula theatres next I
week. Radio broadcasting stations,
have also consented to send out ma-'
terial on the Fiesta. They will begin
broadcasting the story of the pageant
a week before the production.
Tickets for the Fiesta were printed
early this week, and will be sent to:
Ray Region schools and to San Fran
cisco at once. Elizabeth Crebs, ticket
committee chairman, has also ap
pointed a woman in each sorority to 1
canvass sorority alumnae through
their local organizations.
Blueprints of the grounds for the
Fiesta show provision for 2200 seats,
including 28 boxes. The ground has
been terraced so that the tiers of,
seats go back and up, and do not;
stretch far to the sides. All seats will
be reserved.
