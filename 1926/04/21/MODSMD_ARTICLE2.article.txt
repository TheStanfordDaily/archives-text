# NEVERS CONSIDERED PITCHING PROSPECT FOR MAJOR LEAGUE
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's football
celebrity, is an excellent major league
baseball prospect, accDrding to George
Sisler, manager of the St. Louis
Browns. Nor does Sisler think that
Nevers will be forced to point to his
gridiron ability to make a name on the
ball fielfl. When Nevers reported to
the Browns at their camp at Tarpon
Springs, Florida, he was immediately
recognized as a great football player.
A week later they were looking at him
as a pitcher.
Sisler asserts that it will not be
necessary to farm out Nevers like
other recruits for development in the
minors. The former Cardinal ace is
taking baseball seriously. He seeks
the same fame in the national pastime
as was his in college football.
