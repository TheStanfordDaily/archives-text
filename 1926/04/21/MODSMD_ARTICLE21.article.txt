That very interesting sports publication of the Middle West, the Big
Ten Weekly, has lately propounded a riddle that has undoubtedly hovered
about the minds of Coast track fans for years. Why, asks the Weekly's
editors, is the coast so weak in the mile and two-mile year after year when
it continually puts forth star sprinters, hurdlers, et cetera?
And yet, when Schwobeda and Kerr can cover the mile in 4:25 and
Heilman and Stevens the two-mile in 9:40, perhaps there are improve
ments in sight for our distance events. Then too, Oregon Agricultural
College'claims to have seven men who bettered 4:30 in the mile recently.
The editorial follows:
"There is one outstanding freak of intercollegiate track athletics in the
Pacific Coast that defies explanation. The three great coast teams —Cali-
fornia, Stanford, and Southern California —year after year have star
sprinters, hurdlers, and middle distance men, 48 foot shot putters, 140
foot discus men, great pole valuters and flocks of high jumpers who go
well over 6 feet.
"But in one event the coast is weak and in a second is downright feeble.
Few, very few Pacific Conference milers show real class, according to the
standards of the middle west and east, and almost never does the coast
develop a two miler of anything approaching first class performances.
Running two miles under 10:00 is not common in California. Occasionally
a 9:40 man will be developed, but runners capable of doing 9:30 or even
into the "twenties" are unknown in the far west.
"It is difficult to believe that such successful coaches as Christie, Tem
pleton and Cromwell, all masters at teaching track form and development
doesn't know how to turn out distance runners. It may be that the con
tinuously warm California climate is a restriction that retards two milers,
but such seems hard to believe.
"The mystery goes on unsolved year after year."
