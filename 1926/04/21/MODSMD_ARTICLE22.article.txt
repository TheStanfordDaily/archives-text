Elsewhere in these columns (as Arthur Brisbane would laughingly re
mark) is printed the information that the enlightened male students of the
University of Indiana, in answering a recent questionnaire, have modestly
contributed to the sum total of human knowledge a definition of the ideal
woman.
Her attributes, needless to say, are as numerous as they are contra
dictory.
She must have a musical laugh, and must neither smoke, drink, swear,
nor paint her lips. Just what she should have to laugh about is not made
clear.
The perfect woman, furthermore, must be pleasingly plump, declare
the Indiana Collegians. . . . How many pieces make a bathing suit ? . . .
The perfect woman must also be talkative. For good measure, it is
also desirable that she have intelligence. This latter quality, however,
must be sternly controlled, lest it interfere with the former. Doomed is
the Indiana co-ed who has intelligence enough to keep her unpainted
mouth shut.
At any rate, the boys have defined the ideal woman. A pocket copy of
the definition will come in handy if you happen to find her.
We repeat, IF you happen to find her.
