American education reached new heights the other day when the I lobo
College of Chicago conferred degrees upon one hundred and fifty sons ot
the road. Amid.impressive ceremonies featured by a baccalaureate ad
dress and a class song rendered in the quaint idiom of the freight car. the
graduates filed solemnly up to the rostrum to receive the mimeographed
diplomas, admitting them to the fellowship of educated men.
Although a vocational school for hoboes would seem to be ideal, this
new institution shuns the practical tendencies of liberal education. Public
speaking, visits to art galleries, musicales, all these and other cultural
effects find their place in the curriculum. In sum, they represent an en
richment of each vagrant's life. After a winter spent in Chicago and en
livened by intellectual restlessness, the happy tramp heeds the call of the
broad highway—his acquaintance with the humanities having given him
that detached, impassive view of life so indispensable to well-poised mem
bers of his profession.

Spring and finals evidently arrive simultaneously at ()klahoma. ac
cording to the Oklahoma, Daily:
"Just now everyone is not so terribly enthusiastic over the pleasure of attending
college."
