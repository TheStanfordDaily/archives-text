beginning to the end of the quarter, will assure you a job in the Phi Bete
house. The big thing is to spend your 15 minutes a day as directed. See
that coupon? Just clip it NOW and send it In with the accompanying check
to cover the cost of postage. If you are not satisfied at the end of thirty
days, just try and get your money back:
What 15 minutes a day will show you:
How to eat peas with your knife.
How to polish apples.
How to get profs to raise your marks.
How to be the most popular man in college.
How to make a hit with the women.
How to work wonders with words, if any.
There is no magic, no trick in this amazing book which you cannot
master —others have tried and failed, why not you? You too can develop
bashfulness, timidity, stage-fright, and conquer popularity, social standing, etc.
Even though you are the most talkative man on the street, you can change
overnight if not sooner.
Remember that four out of five see this too late. Don't let carelessness
or a false feeling of security ruin your whole future. THROW your voice—
lots of fun fooling the teacher.
If you want a job or a hobby that pays well, where you are your own
goss, and keep your own hours, multiplying your earnings, etc., then here's
the secret. Your brain is not dead in most cases, but merely dormant —tem-
porarily asleep. The little book tells about the amazing new treatment, shows
what has already been done for countless others, and in addiiton contains
much valuable information. Remember, this book is yours free, to keep. You
can take advantage of this without risking a penny. So mail the coupon

"SPEAK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES"
Say "Yes" to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine;
Either a half-wink or a nod.
And I will lead you to sign.
v No one is near; the coast is clear,
And who will ever know?
Now don't you tell a soul of this,
Or our house will have to go.

HOW TO CATCH A BUS
The art of waiting for a bus: Arrive at bus terminal just in time to miss
the five-forty-three. Go up to ticket office and buy ticket, inquiring at the
same time when the next bus leaves for the city. "6:10." Thank the man
and go away for he is perhaps busy and doesn't care to discuss the weather,
etc., and ditto. Buy copy of Judge, sit down and read it; laugh heartily at
the jokes, whether they are good or not, for being jovial helps pass the time
away. Go back to the ticket office. Ask the man if the bus will be on time;
discuss the weather, etc. Return to seat and resume your reading; it is
essential to appear studious, for the benefit of whatever professors might be
about. Open a package of cigaraettes, go back to the ticket office and ask
the man for a match; ask him if he is sure the bus will not be late as you
have a heavy date; tell him all about her, etc.
Resume your seat and begin reading. Strike up an acquaintance with
the girl next to you, as this also helps pass the time away. Go over and get
a shine. When you return the bus has come and gone. Go up to ticket office
and inquire when next bus leaves. Moral: It might be worse.

There is no magic, no trick in this amazing book which you cannot
master —others have tried and failed, why not you? You too can develop
bashfulness, timidity, stage-fright, and conquer popularity, social standing, etc.
Even though you are the most talkative man on the street, you can change
overnight if not sooner.
Remember that four out of five see this too late. Don't let carelessness
or a false feeling of security ruin your whole future. THROW your voice—
lots of fun fooling the teacher.
If you want a job or a hobby that pays well, where you are your own
goss, and keep your own hours, multiplying your earnings, etc., then here's
the secret. Your brain is not dead in most cases, but merely dormant —tem-
porarily asleep. The little book tells about the amazing new treatment, shows
what has already been done for countless others, and in addiiton contains
much valuable information. Remember, this book is yours free, to keep. You
can take advantage of this without risking a penny. So mail the coupon
now and get the surprise of your life. —J.K.

"SPEAK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES"
Say "Yes" to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine;
Either a half-wink or a nod.
And I will lead you to sign.
v No one is near; the coast is clear,
And who will ever know?
Now don't you tell a soul of this,
Or our house will have to go.

HOW TO CATCH A BUS
The art of waiting for a bus: Arrive at bus terminal just in time to miss
the five-forty-three. Go up to ticket office and buy ticket, inquiring at the
same time when the next bus leaves for the city. "6:10." Thank the man
and go away for he is perhaps busy and doesn't care to discuss the weather,
etc., and ditto. Buy copy of Judge, sit down and read it; laugh heartily at
the jokes, whether they are good or not, for being jovial helps pass the time
away. Go back to the ticket office. Ask the man if the bus will be on time;
discuss the weather, etc. Return to seat and resume your reading; it is
essential to appear studious, for the benefit of whatever professors might be
about. Open a package of cigaraettes, go back to the ticket office and ask
the man for a match; ask him if he is sure the bus will not be late as you
have a heavy date; tell him all about her, etc.
Resume your seat and begin reading. Strike up an acquaintance with
the girl next to you, as this also helps pass the time away. Go over and get
a shine. When you return the bus has come and gone. Go up to ticket office
and inquire when next bus leaves. Moral: It might be worse.
