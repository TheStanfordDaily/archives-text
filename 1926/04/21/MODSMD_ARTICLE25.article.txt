# SWEET, INNOCENT TYPE PREFERRED AT INDIANA "PLEASINGLY PLUMP" HELD A REQUISITE BY MEN WOMEN WHO SATISFY MUST "HAND A GOOD LINE"

The men of the University of In
diana defined the ideal college woman
in a recent election. Questionnaires
have revealed the fact that masculine
approval rests upon the woman who
is a sweet, innocent, pleasingly plump,
intelligent, fairly good looking, pow
dered and rouged brunette of medium
height, with blue eyes, an aquiline
nose, and bobbed hair.
Free and easy in manner, a good
dancer, a lively conversationalist with
a musical laugh and a woman who
neither smokes, drinks, swears, nor
paints her lips is the choice of a ma
jority of men. Furthermore, she should
possess athletic inclinations and be

prominent in campus activities. Long
and slender hands and small feet are
desirable attributes, and a knowledge
of cooking is highly favored.
A close race between women who
talked and were wielders of a good
"line" and the women who are quiet
and let the men entertain resulted in
victory for the talkative by eight
votes. Gone is the day of shiny noses
and bright faces. The men prefer
women who use powder and rouge,
although for several unexplained rea
sons they do not care for lipstick. The
thin or slightly thin women lost the
day to the pleasingly plump, an en- (
eouragement to dieters.
