# STANFORD MUSEUM EMBODIES PLAN OF LELAND STANFORD. JR.
## 
### 
The Stanford Museum embodies a
plan by Leland Stanford, Junior, car
ried into execution by liis mother and
represents years of research on the
part of both Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford.
In 1880, Leland Stanford. Junior,
who was then 11 years old, accom
panied his parents to Europe. During
their travels through Great Britain
and Central and Southern Europe, he
conceived the idea of bringing away
from each place some object of local
or general interest. At first this idea
was only to perpetuate in his memory
the pleasures of the trip, but gradually
the scope of his plans broadened, and
lie decided to furnish a playroom at
home with his treasures. He carefully
catalogued and arranged his pur
chases and when, in 1883, the family
made a second trip abroad, his par
ents assisted him in his collecting. In
1884, Leland died in Florence; Italy,
from Roman fever, and his mother
took up the work which he had begun.

The present museum was started in
1801 but was not completed until 1906.
The structure is of the Grecian type
of architecture, and was the first re
inforced concrete building in the West.
The museum withstood the earth
quake of 1906, since the two wings
of ordinary brick were the only parts
destroyed by it. During the earthquake
a valuable collection was in Mrs. Stan
ford's home in San Francisco. It was
moved out when the fire started but
when all danger seemed past it was
returned to the building. According to
stories of the big fire, the wind
changed and the flames, sweeping
back, burned the Stanford home, and
at the same time destroyed the valu
able collection.
The Stanford Museum boasts one of
the finest Egyptology collections west
of the Metropolitan Museum. The
Cyprian collection excavated on the
Isle of Cyprus contains valuable speci
mens particularly. Several oriental col
lections, such as the Ikeda collection,

and the one which was given to Stan
ford by Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Hopkins,
constitute a valuable part of the mu
seum's contents.
A series of excellent paintings repre-;
j senting masterpieces by famous art
ists line the upper walls of the gallery
i in the entrance to the building. Three
new collections, the American or early
j Colonial, the California, and the Tex
j tile collection, are now being com-'
j pleted.

The combined earnings of over 200 j
women students at the University of j
Indiana are more than $50,000 a year t
while carrying on their regular school ,
work.

In 1880, Leland Stanford. Junior,
who was then 11 years old, accom
panied his parents to Europe. During
their travels through Great Britain
and Central and Southern Europe, he
conceived the idea of bringing away
from each place some object of local
or general interest. At first this idea
was only to perpetuate in his memory
the pleasures of the trip, but gradually
the scope of his plans broadened, and
lie decided to furnish a playroom at
home with his treasures. He carefully
catalogued and arranged his pur
chases and when, in 1883, the family
made a second trip abroad, his par
ents assisted him in his collecting. In
1884, Leland died in Florence; Italy,
from Roman fever, and his mother
took up the work which he had begun.

The present museum was started in
1801 but was not completed until 1906.
The structure is of the Grecian type
of architecture, and was the first re
inforced concrete building in the West.
The museum withstood the earth
quake of 1906, since the two wings
of ordinary brick were the only parts
destroyed by it. During the earthquake
a valuable collection was in Mrs. Stan
ford's home in San Francisco. It was
moved out when the fire started but
when all danger seemed past it was
returned to the building. According to
stories of the big fire, the wind
changed and the flames, sweeping
back, burned the Stanford home, and
at the same time destroyed the valu
able collection.
The Stanford Museum boasts one of
the finest Egyptology collections west
of the Metropolitan Museum. The
Cyprian collection excavated on the
Isle of Cyprus contains valuable speci
mens particularly. Several oriental col
lections, such as the Ikeda collection,

and the one which was given to Stan
ford by Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Hopkins,
constitute a valuable part of the mu
seum's contents.
A series of excellent paintings repre-;
j senting masterpieces by famous art
ists line the upper walls of the gallery
i in the entrance to the building. Three
new collections, the American or early
j Colonial, the California, and the Tex
j tile collection, are now being com-'
j pleted.

The combined earnings of over 200 j
women students at the University of j
Indiana are more than $50,000 a year t
while carrying on their regular school ,
work.
