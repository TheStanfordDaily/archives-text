# DOMINATION OF AMERICA RESENTED BY EUROPEANS
## 
### 
"Europe for Europeans" is the cry
abroad of those who talk of uniting
Europe to resist America's political
and economic domination of the Conti
nent, according to Professor Frank A.
Golder of the History department, who
spoke in the Little Theatre last night.
America, having achieved economic
supremacy over the rest of the world
following the war, "holds a mortgage
on Europe in the form of war debts,
and is meeting with disfavor as a re
sult," Professor Golder said.
"Not only are Europeans dissatis
fied with the economic conditions re
sulting from American dominance, but
they believe that American interfer
ence in political affairs is unwise.
European nations contend that Amer
ica does not understand their problems
nor their points of view.
"In Europe a pessimistic air and a
weight of fear oppresses people's
minds, for the continent is divided
into three hostile, distrustful camps:
the conquerer, the conquered, and
Russia. Each suspects the other of
sinister motives and points to past
records as proof.
Population Declining
"France, with her declining popula
tion, fears Germany with her growing
population, and in Germany the hate
toward the supporters of the Treaty
of Versailles is just as strong but is
kept under better control.
"Bad as are European foreign rela
tions, internal conditions are perhaps
worse. The war which was fought to
make the world safe for democracy

has brought on dictatorship. The har
mony that prevailed between capital
and labor during the conflict has been
followed by strikes, ; unemploymeut,
class consciousness, and talk of social
revolution," declared Golder.
That there are plenty of reasons for
being hopeful and even optimistic for
the future of Europe, however, is the
belief of Professor Golder. In support
of his contention Golder says, "If you
should study the political, social, and
economic weaknesses of the present,
you would find that there is nothing
unusual about them, that they are the
natural after effects of a serious ill
ness."
League Discussed
"Referring to entrance of the United
States into the League we would lose
patience with the tactics of the Euro
pean statesmen, with their policies of
compromise and half measure. We
would insist that disarmament means
disarmament, suppression of opium
means suppression, and the Europeans
would not agree with us because, they
would say they had to deal with a
condition, not a theory."
Closing his lecture with a plea for
confidence in the manner in which the
Government is handling its foreign
affairs, Golder said, "Do not become
impatient because we do not embrace
the League as warmly as you thing
we should. The people who run our
Government are every bit as honest
and as able and as ready to H o the
right thing as are those of European
states, and if they have doubts, they
have good reasons for them."
