# TEMPERAMENT CHIEF CAUSE OF HOUSER'S SUCCESS, SAYS COACH
## Trojan Weight Star Greatest Competitive Athlete in World—Cromwell 
### U.S.C. Publicity Director 
Los Angeles, April 20. —Nature did
not give Clarence "Bud" Houser,
world's champion discus thrower, a
huge bulk of powerful muscles, but the
kind proverbial lady did bestow upon
the University of Southern California's
captain a generous helping of tempera
ment. The latter, according to Coach
Dean Cromwell, is a weight man's
most important asset, and Houser has
used his temperament to bring him
self to the top of the ladder among dis
cus throwers. Now the "Little Giant,"
as he is called because of his 185
pounds, is entering the Drake Relays,
hoping to become the shot-put king of
the nation, and he will rely upon his
ability to do the unexpected under the
stress of competition.
More than sixteen years ago Ralph
Rose, who weighed around 300 pounds,
set the world's shot record at 51 feet.
It would be a curious thing if this
year a man weighing little more than
half Rose's weight would break the
record, but Houser is set to do it.
"Bud" holds four discus records, the
greatest being the world's mark at 158
feet 1 3-4 inches, and in establishing
every mark, Houser has surprised the
fans who wonder how he does it.
Is Competitive
"Houser is the greatest competitive
athlete in the world," says Dean Crom
well, the man who has had four other
world champions under his tutelage
and who has trained Houser through
out his career. "You can talk with
Houser for an entire afternoon and
never know he is an athlete. He is just
that modest. But when he gets out on
the field against a classy field he
fairly bubbles over with pep.
"I remember when Houser went out
at Philadelphia last year and broke
the intercollegiate record by throwing
150 feet 2 1-4 inches. That is his lowest
record, but when you remember that
it was raining at the time you will
see how remarkable even this throw
was. After Houser and Norm Ander
son had qualified in the discus, the
two athletes came into the training
quarters. We gave them a rub down and
they then stood in the doorway until
their turn. Houser went racing across
the field all pepped up for his two
final throws. He wiped off his disc
and on his first throw sent it for a
new record. Anderson himself threw
farther than ever before in his life
and took third.
"Just before the National A.A.U.

' championships at San Francisco last
fourth of July, I found that Houser
had so perfected his discus form that
it was only necessary to get him con
fident and he would make his greatest
' mark on one of his first throws. I
! therefore made him promise not to
throw the discus once at the meet
[until his name was called. His team
mates talked him up to beat Glenn
: Hartranft who had just broken Bud's
| former world's record of 15(5 feet 3 1-2
| inches by throwing 157 feet I 5-8
inches. Houser was on edge and
warmed up by tossing the weight back
j and forth on the grass. When his name
i was called, he stepped to the circle
' and started his beautiful rhythmic
spin. I knew when the platter scaled
off his hand he set a record. It was for
15(5 feet (! inches, a new A.A.U. mark,
i Houser sat at the side the remainder
jof the afternoon in sweat clothes
watching the athletes try for his mark.
Is Also Cool, Careful
"Again Houser showed his competi
tive strength or rather his tempera
ment when he broke the world's rec
ord. He knew he was going to Palo
Alto to be watched by Hartranft, his
greatest opponent, who was graduated
last year. Houser told his teammates
! he would break the world's record up
' there. When the event started Hart
ranft was one of the measuring judges.
| Houser began to get pepped up and
! immediately after qualifying he un
loosed the heave which sailed out
over Hartranft's head to better 'Tiny's'
own mark. As Hartranft raced to the
mark where the platter fell, he said,
'There goes my record.' The disc went
50 feet after it struck the ground. It
was a tremendous heave and Houser
says the weight slipped in his hand or
it would have gone further."
And now let Charles Paddock, world
i champion sprint star and former Uni
versity of Southern California cap
tain, tell how Houser performed at the
Olympic games of 1924:
"The time had come for Houser's
| last throw," says Paddock. "It was his
last chance and America's final oppor
| tunity to win the discus. A Finnish
| flag stood in first place, and other
i American flags besides that of Hou
■ ser's was in second and third posi
| tions. All other Americans had com
j pleted their throws. Houser knew that
Niitymaa, the leader, was a great
thrower. The heave Niitymaa had
made was a new Olympic record and
was better than almost any figure
Houser had ever registered in crompe
j tition.
"Cooly, carefully, Houser took his
place in the ring. He could not help
but feel that those thousands in the
i stands were all hoping he would lose.
There was just a little group of Ameri
cans pulling for him and out of the
yells that came to Bud across the
j field, he could plainly hear the Finnish
! yell, urging their man to victory. But

Houser was not daunted. He put every j
bit of fighting spirit and of will, not j
only to do his best, but better than
his best, and the discus sailed out i
past his American teammates, and !
past the Finnish champion to bring!
home the Olympic championship and j
a new record to the United States and j
to Houser."

record, but when you remember that
it was raining at the time you will
see how remarkable even this throw
was. After Houser and Norm Ander
son had qualified in the discus, the
two athletes came into the training
quarters. We gave them a rub down and
they then stood in the doorway until
their turn. Houser went racing across
the field all pepped up for his two
final throws. He wiped off his disc
and on his first throw sent it for a
new record. Anderson himself threw
farther than ever before in his life
and took third.
"Just before the National A.A.U.

' championships at San Francisco last

had so perfected his discus form that
it was only necessary to get him con

'There goes my record.' The disc went
50 feet after it struck the ground. It
was a tremendous heave and Houser
says the weight slipped in his hand or
it would have gone further."
And now let Charles Paddock, world
i champion sprint star and former Uni
versity of Southern California cap
tain, tell how Houser performed at the
Olympic games of 1924:
"The time had come for Houser's
| last throw," says Paddock. "It was his
last chance and America's final oppor

| flag stood in first place, and other
i American flags besides that of Hou

Niitymaa, the leader, was a great
thrower. The heave Niitymaa had
made was a new Olympic record and
was better than almost any figure
Houser had ever registered in crompe

"Cooly, carefully, Houser took his

Los Angeles, April 20. —Nature did
not give Clarence "Bud" Houser,
world's champion discus thrower, a
huge bulk of powerful muscles, but the
kind proverbial lady did bestow upon
the University of Southern California's
captain a generous helping of tempera
ment. The latter, according to Coach
Dean Cromwell, is a weight man's
most important asset, and Houser has
used his temperament to bring him
self to the top of the ladder among dis
cus throwers. Now the "Little Giant,"
as he is called because of his 185
pounds, is entering the Drake Relays,
hoping to become the shot-put king of
the nation, and he will rely upon his
ability to do the unexpected under the
stress of competition.
More than sixteen years ago Ralph
Rose, who weighed around 300 pounds,
set the world's shot record at 51 feet.
It would be a curious thing if this
year a man weighing little more than
half Rose's weight would break the
record, but Houser is set to do it.

' there. When the event started Hart
ranft was one of the measuring judges.
| Houser began to get pepped up and
! immediately after qualifying he un
loosed the heave which sailed out
over Hartranft's head to better 'Tiny's'
own mark. As Hartranft raced to the
mark where the platter fell, he said,
'There goes my record.' The disc went
50 feet after it struck the ground. It
was a tremendous heave and Houser
says the weight slipped in his hand or
it would have gone further."
And now let Charles Paddock, world
i champion sprint star and former Uni
versity of Southern California cap
tain, tell how Houser performed at the
Olympic games of 1924:
"The time had come for Houser's
| last throw," says Paddock. "It was his
last chance and America's final oppor
| tunity to win the discus. A Finnish
| flag stood in first place, and other
i American flags besides that of Hou
■ ser's was in second and third posi
| tions. All other Americans had com
j pleted their throws. Houser knew that
Niitymaa, the leader, was a great
thrower. The heave Niitymaa had
made was a new Olympic record and
was better than almost any figure
Houser had ever registered in crompe
j tition.
"Cooly, carefully, Houser took his
place in the ring. He could not help
but feel that those thousands in the
i stands were all hoping he would lose.
There was just a little group of Ameri
cans pulling for him and out of the
yells that came to Bud across the
j field, he could plainly hear the Finnish
! yell, urging their man to victory. But

Houser was not daunted. He put every j
bit of fighting spirit and of will, not j
only to do his best, but better than
his best, and the discus sailed out i
past his American teammates, and !
past the Finnish champion to bring!
home the Olympic championship and j
a new record to the United States and j
to Houser."
Los Angeles, April 20. —Nature did
not give Clarence "Bud" Houser,
world's champion discus thrower, a
huge bulk of powerful muscles, but the
kind proverbial lady did bestow upon
the University of Southern California's
captain a generous helping of tempera
ment. The latter, according to Coach
Dean Cromwell, is a weight man's
most important asset, and Houser has
used his temperament to bring him
self to the top of the ladder among dis
cus throwers. Now the "Little Giant,"
as he is called because of his 185
pounds, is entering the Drake Relays,
hoping to become the shot-put king of
the nation, and he will rely upon his
ability to do the unexpected under the
stress of competition.
More than sixteen years ago Ralph
Rose, who weighed around 300 pounds,
set the world's shot record at 51 feet.
It would be a curious thing if this
year a man weighing little more than
half Rose's weight would break the
record, but Houser is set to do it.
"Bud" holds four discus records, the
greatest being the world's mark at 158
feet 1 3-4 inches, and in establishing
every mark, Houser has surprised the
fans who wonder how he does it.
Is Competitive
"Houser is the greatest competitive
athlete in the world," says Dean Crom
well, the man who has had four other
world champions under his tutelage
and who has trained Houser through
out his career. "You can talk with
Houser for an entire afternoon and
never know he is an athlete. He is just
that modest. But when he gets out on
the field against a classy field he
fairly bubbles over with pep.
"I remember when Houser went out
at Philadelphia last year and broke
the intercollegiate record by throwing
150 feet 2 1-4 inches. That is his lowest
record, but when you remember that
it was raining at the time you will
see how remarkable even this throw
was. After Houser and Norm Ander
son had qualified in the discus, the
two athletes came into the training
quarters. We gave them a rub down and
they then stood in the doorway until
their turn. Houser went racing across
the field all pepped up for his two
final throws. He wiped off his disc
and on his first throw sent it for a
new record. Anderson himself threw
farther than ever before in his life
and took third.
"Just before the National A.A.U.

' championships at San Francisco last
fourth of July, I found that Houser
had so perfected his discus form that
it was only necessary to get him con
fident and he would make his greatest
' mark on one of his first throws. I
! therefore made him promise not to
throw the discus once at the meet
[until his name was called. His team
mates talked him up to beat Glenn
: Hartranft who had just broken Bud's
| former world's record of 15(5 feet 3 1-2
| inches by throwing 157 feet I 5-8
inches. Houser was on edge and
warmed up by tossing the weight back
j and forth on the grass. When his name
i was called, he stepped to the circle
' and started his beautiful rhythmic
spin. I knew when the platter scaled
off his hand he set a record. It was for
15(5 feet (! inches, a new A.A.U. mark,
i Houser sat at the side the remainder
jof the afternoon in sweat clothes
watching the athletes try for his mark.
Is Also Cool, Careful
"Again Houser showed his competi
tive strength or rather his tempera
ment when he broke the world's rec
ord. He knew he was going to Palo
Alto to be watched by Hartranft, his
greatest opponent, who was graduated
last year. Houser told his teammates
