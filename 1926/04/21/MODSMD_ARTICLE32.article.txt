# CAPELLA CHOIR WILL INCLUDE WORK FROM BACH IN REPERTOIRE
## 
### 
John Smallman's a capella choir, a
distinctive musical organization, will
sing in the Stanford Assembly Hall
the evening of Monday, May 17, under
the auspices of the Stanford Glee Club.
Members of the choir sing all their
songs unaccompanied, a method which
produces more truly vocal effects.
They sing entirely from memory, using
no scores even for the most difficult
numbers on their varied repertoire.
This group is the only costumed
choir in the West, all the members
wearing gaily-colored Gypsy attire in
their program. Every voice in the
choir has been carefully and profes
sionally trained in the difficult and
highly specialized art of a capella (un
accompanied) singing.
The medieval cathedrals all boasted
of their capella choirs whose pride it
was to sing unaccompanied without
the slightest deviation of pitch. John
Smallman of Los Angeles followed
these traditions when he organized
the choir which he still directs.
Compositions by John Sebastian
Bach, Orlando di Lasso, "the Belgian
Orpheus," Enrico Bossi, and many
other prominent composers of choral
music are on the choir's repertoire.
Of their singing, David Bruno
Usslier, critic of the Los Angeles Ex
press, wrote: "Tone quality, purity,
rhythmic and contrapuntal detail were
treated with an ease and fineness
which should eventually win this
chorus wide esteem, especially as inter
pretative detail is not neglected."
A capella singing has beauties that
are not found in the ordinary accom
panied form. The precision and sharp
ness of attack with which these highly
trained organizations render their se
lections bring out all the rhythmical
possibilities, while their ability to stay
exactly on pitch without any support
of accompaAying instruments, makes
possible the most delicate shadings of
harmony of which the human voice is
capable.
