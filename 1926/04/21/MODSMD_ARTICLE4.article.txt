# NORTHERN COLLEGES DISPLAY STRENGTH IN DISTANCE RACES
## 
### 
Strong competition in the distance
races in the Pacific Coast Conference
meet at Stanford on May 15 has been
assured by reports issuing from north
ern schools.
The half-mile should prove a classic
with Charteris of Washington, Rich
ardson of Stanford, Boyden of Cali
fornia, and Niersbach of Southern
California hooking up in what should
prove to be the fastest 880 race in
the coast track history. Last year
Charteris won the national half-mile
championship at Chicago with Rich
ardson second and Boyden fourth.
Since Richardson's sensational victory
over Boyden in the remarkable time
of 1:53.8, dope places him on equal
footing with the northern star.
Reports from the north indicate that
that section will be well represented
in the mile run. Seven men at the
Oregon Agricultural College in a re
cent mile tryout bettered 4:30' with
Sisson, a sophomore, winning by five
yards from Clayton in the fast time of
4:24. Butts, in third, did 4:25, Martin
ran under 4:27, and Peterson, Bell,
and Knifton got under 4:30. Schwo
beda of the California Bears, has done
4:23 dnd Bill Kerr, Stanford miler,
has run under 4:25, so that the winner
is greatly in doubt.
Devine, of Washington State, who
last year while a sophomore broke the
Pacific Coast Conference record in the
two-mile with a mark of 9:32, is back
this year and has been performing in
great form. He won the national cham
pionship at Chicago last season. Sev
eral of the Oregon Aggie milers are
said to be capable of under 9:45, so
the California distance men will have
their fill of opposition.
The best mark in California to date
was made by Heilman of U.S.C. with
9:49. Stevens of California did 9:50.5
to win the first place Saturday, but his
best mark last year was 9:43. Criley,
who has made such remarkable prog
ress in the two mile for Stanford and
who did under 9:51 against Stevens
without being completely exhausted,
may surprise the dopesters again and
edge into the points, as he has four
weeks in which to improve his time.
