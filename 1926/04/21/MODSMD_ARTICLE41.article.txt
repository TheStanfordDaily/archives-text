# GRADUATE STUDENT MAKES COLLECTION OF STANFORD SLANG
## 
### 
More than 300 slang words and ex
pressions have been collected at Stan
ford during the past eighteen months
by William Russell Morse, a graduate
student doing research work in lin
guistics.
Although the collection is called
"Stanfordisms," it contains not only
slang phrases of Stanford origin but
other such expressions which have
been brought here by students from
the various localities in which they
live.
The collection of "Stanfordisms"
was recently sent to "American
Speech," a new monthly magazine
dealing with problems and interesting
facts about the American language.
Each word of the list is defined in
good English.
In order to obtain the list of slang,
the collector talked with the students
and professors, noting the slang terms
used. He took all the college litera
ture possible, including the Daily Palo
Alto and the Chaparral, both of which
the collector termed as "the best
sources available."
When asked the. motive for collect
ing "Stanfordisms" Morse replied, "I
have always been interested in lan
guages. One of the first things im
pressing me when I came to Stanford
was the picturesque character of the
slang."
Among the "Stanfordisms" which
are so well known on the campus are
such slang phrases as the following:
"dryball," a student who does nothing
but study; "to hop a rattler," to board
a trolley; "imports," women who come
to social affairs and who do not live
on the campus; "to get off the dime,"
to start; "rough," a student not neatly
clad but good-hearted who looks in at
a dance but partakes only of eatables;
"on the gravy train" to get credit for
no work; "bawl-out," student direc
tory; "apple-polishing," to flatter for
sake of personal advancement.
