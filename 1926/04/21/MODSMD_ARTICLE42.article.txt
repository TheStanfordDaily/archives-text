convention at Los Angeles last week
with the Western Division of Associ
ated Women Students.
The business meetings of the Con
ference were held at the University of

dinner the first evening of the Confer
ence session, and they were enter
tained later by the Women's Faculty
Club, and the Associated Women Stu
dents, who gave a banquet at the Bilt

regents of the University of California,
Southern Branch, was hostess to the
Deans at a luncheon.

had changed from early fall rushing to
deferred rushing. None of the plans
discussed were felt to be working en
tirely satisfactorily. Dean Cooper gave
a survey of sorority living groups at
the University of Arizona.
