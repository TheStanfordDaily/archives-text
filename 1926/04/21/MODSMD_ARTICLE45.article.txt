# W. A. A. LEADERS RETURN TO CAMPUS FROM COAST MEET
## 
### 
Marie Manchee and Clarita Huns
berger, delegates to the western divi
sion meeting of the Athletic Confer
ence of American College Women, re
turned yesterday from the meeting
which was held at Pullman, Washing
ton the latter part of last week.
The conference consisted of round
table discussions, talks on topics that
concerned the national organization
and the local W.A.A. groups, and a
comparison of the work of the W.A.A.
in each western college.
Miss Manchee, president-elect of
W.A.A., read a paper and lead a dis
cussion at the Friday afternoon ses
sion on "Harmony in Policy and Ideals
of W.A.A., N.A.A.F., and other organi
zations interested in women's ath
letics." As a result of this talk, the
convention endorsed the present plat
form of the National Amateur Athletic
Federation, women's division, which
believes in women's sports in charge
of women and planned particularly for

women, and not just imitation of men's
sports. This organization sponsors
sports for all women, both in college
and out.
In this same line, the conference
passed a resolution to he forwarded
to the national convention to be held
in November at Cornell that they dis
approved of sports for women being
sponsored by men's organizations be
cause it tends to commercialize wo
men's sports, over-emphasize competi
tion and development of star players,
and ignores the proper medical and
physical precautions.
