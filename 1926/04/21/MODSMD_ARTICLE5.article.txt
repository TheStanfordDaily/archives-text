# Yale Faculty Abolishes Compulsory Chapel Rule
## 
### 
Abolition of compulsory daily and
1 Sunday chapel has been recommended
i by the General Faculty of Yale Uni-
I versity and also by the Freshman
Faculty. This action comes as a com
plete surprise since it amounts to a
virtual acceptance of the undergradu
ate petition made last fall asking for
freedom from chapel attendance. It is
also contrary to the decision of the
committee investigating the question.
| The faculty recommendation will be
I considered by the Yale Corporation at
I its next meeting.
