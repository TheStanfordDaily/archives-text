The Western Association was formed
a year ago in Los Angeles to promote
the business and editorial interests
of the comic magazines west of the
Rocky Mounains,. with special atten
tion upon the reprint and national ad
vertising problems. The Association
as a whole is a member of the National
Association of College Comics, which
is headed by the Yale Record.
Page Rate Charged
After the first convention of the As
sociation the "College Humour" and
"College Comics" magazines were
obliged to pay a page rate for all
material taken from the magazines of
the members. This plan was in accord
ance with previous action taken by
Eastern comic magazines. The com
missions charged by national advertis
ing agencies was reduced from 30.2
per cent to 28.2 per cent, and it
is the aim of the members of the
National Association to eventually
have a special advertising representa
tive appointed to cater only to the
special field of college comics.
Plans were also formulated to stand
ardize the material make-up of the
publications. The circulation and edi
torial problems were discussed and
numerous resolutions passed that were
advantageous to the best interests of
these divisions of the various publica
tions.
