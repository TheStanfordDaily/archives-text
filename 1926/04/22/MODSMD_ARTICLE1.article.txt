## CLUB INFIELD ERRORLESS Encina II Walks Away With 11 to 4 Victory Over Branner Nine 
### 
Gaining an early lead and adding to
it as the game progressed, the Juni
pero Serra Club nine scored a deci
sive 8-5 victory over Theta Chi in an
intramural baseball game yesterday.
Frank Harold, Serra Club pitcher, was
chiefly responsible for the win, but he
received air-tight support, and as a
result of this and last week's game,
his team looms as a probable con
tender for championship honors.
The club infield deserves Credit for
playing fast, practically errorless ball,
an unusual spectacle on the intramural
diamonds. Harold and Scherer, Serra
Club battery, kept the hitting at a
minimum, and the game looked as it
it would be a shutout, 8-0, until the last
of the seventh. Although it was late
in the game, Theta Chi desperately
tried a rally. Hausch led off with a
hit. Dye flied out, scoring Hausch.
Sawyer hit and was brought in by
Helmke's line drive. Phil Greene sac
rificed, scoring Helmke, after which
Dice and True both hit and scored.
Bert Green ended the affair with an
out.
Encina II Wins
Junipero Serra men hit consistent
ly, gathering nine bingles in all, and
the rest of the time went to first on
the numerous walks allowed by Bert
Green, Theta Chi twirler. Cullinan and
Harold shared batting honors for the
winners.
Encina II handed Branner I a deci
sive defeat yesterday when the year
lings walked away with the big end
of an 11-4 score. The game started
with Branner leading off strong in the
first inning, Frye and Newmark scor
ing a run apiece. This lead quickly
laded after a series of ten Encina runs
in the succeeding innings, brought in
mainly by Edmonds, Nelson, and
Strauss.
The freshman squad displayed sev
eral spurts of good fielding, appearing
particularly strong on the base throws.
Good batting was in evidence through
out the game.

ule. They will meet El Cuadro today j

Frank Harold, Serra Club pitcher, was
chiefly responsible for the win, but he
received air-tight support, and as a
result of this and last week's game,
his team looms as a probable con
tender for championship honors.
The club infield deserves Credit for
playing fast, practically errorless ball,
an unusual spectacle on the intramural
diamonds. Harold and Scherer, Serra
Club battery, kept the hitting at a
minimum, and the game looked as it
it would be a shutout, 8-0, until the last
of the seventh. Although it was late
in the game, Theta Chi desperately
tried a rally. Hausch led off with a
hit. Dye flied out, scoring Hausch.
Sawyer hit and was brought in by
Helmke's line drive. Phil Greene sac
rificed, scoring Helmke, after which
Dice and True both hit and scored.
Bert Green ended the affair with an
out.
Encina II Wins
Junipero Serra men hit consistent
ly, gathering nine bingles in all, and
the rest of the time went to first on
the numerous walks allowed by Bert
Green, Theta Chi twirler. Cullinan and
Harold shared batting honors for the
winners.
Encina II handed Branner I a deci
sive defeat yesterday when the year
lings walked away with the big end
of an 11-4 score. The game started
with Branner leading off strong in the
first inning, Frye and Newmark scor
ing a run apiece. This lead quickly
laded after a series of ten Encina runs
in the succeeding innings, brought in
mainly by Edmonds, Nelson, and
Strauss.
The freshman squad displayed sev
eral spurts of good fielding, appearing
particularly strong on the base throws.
Good batting was in evidence through
out the game.
Zete Game Postponed
Zeta Psi, rated as one of the strong
est teams in League I, caused general
surprise by failing to appear for its
game with El Cuadro. Upon inquiry it
was found that the Zetes were not
prepared to play, owing to confusion
resulting from an error in the sched
ule. They will meet El Cuadro today j
or tomorrow to play the game.
Tomorrow's games: Encina IV vs.
Phi Delta Theta, Diamond I; Encina j
Y vs. Alpha Kappa Lambda, III; Phi
Kappa Sigma vs. Sequoia I, Sequoia, j
Breakers, scheduled to play Branner j
11, win by forfeit, owing to the dis- j
banding of the latter team.
Today's games: Los Arcos vs. Kappa.
Alpha; Encina 111 vs. Kappa Sigma; j
El Tigre vs. Theta Delta Chi; Delta J
