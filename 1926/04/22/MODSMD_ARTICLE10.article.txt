# SOLVE MYSTERY IN DOPE CONTEST; TAFT WINS SECOND PRIZE
## 
### 
Despite the fact that three men
have claimed second prize in the
Daily Palo Alto dope contest on
the results of the California track
meet, Stanley B. Taft was today
awarded the 'merchandise order.
For three days the Contest
Editor has been searching for the
unknown dopester who bashfully
left off his correct dope sheet.
Taft received a gift of any $5
brassie or driver, any iron club,
or goods of equal value from
Smith on the Circle.
The winners of the first and
third prizes were Frederick Kel
logg and G. Garner Green, re
spectively, who were not afraid
of the glare of publicity.
