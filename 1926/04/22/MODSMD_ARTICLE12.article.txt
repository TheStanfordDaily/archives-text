# HARVARD PROFESSOR VISITS STANFORD ON TREE STUDYING TRIP
## 
### 
Dr. I. W. Bailey, professor of for
estry at Harvard University, visited
the departments of biological sciences
here yesterday in connection with a
trip he is marking for the purpose of
studying forests and forestry in all
parts of the world.
Professor Bailey and H. A. Spoehr,
member of the department of plant
physiology at the Carnegie Institute
of Washington, form a commission
financed by the National Research
Council and the Carnegie Institute to
study forests and forests throughout
the world. The study will be made
with the view of improving the con
ditions of the forests as a supply of
fuel and timber in this country. This
is needed because of the increasing
population, consumption of fuel, and
decreasing area of timber land.
The two men will start in opposite
directions on their world tour. Spoehr
will start east through the Panama
Canal to Europe, while Bailey will go
from Seattle westward to Hawaii and
the Orient. They will probably meet
some place in southern Europe.
Both men will return to California
about the first of next year, as Profes
sor Bailey expects to be here for a few
months, making use of the University
libraries and the botanical laboratories
to write up his report.
Br. Bailey was here yesterday to
meet the professors of the biological
sciences departments. His visit was a
part of his comprehensive study of
the California institutes.
In California Professor Bailey has
already visited the redwood belt in
Humboldt, county and was taken yes
terday to visit, the forested region
about La Honda. He is now on his
way to Portland.
