## 
### 
Demanding the repeal of the present
law barring foreign "reds" from enter
ing the United States because it waf
unethical and un-American, three mem
bers of the Euphronia Debating So
i ciety won the audience decision lasl
! night over representatives of the Uni
versity of California Senate.
Leon B. Brown, of Euphronia, openec
j the debate and outlined the argumeni
! for the affirmative. He declared thai
; it was against the principles on which
{ this nation was founded to keep radi
j cal reformers out of the United States
I In defending the governmental re
I striction against incoming reformers
I Robert Teidemann, of the California
organization, said that a great spread
Of radicalism in the United States is
possible. The bar against such radi
cals, he argued, is not a perversion of
justice because such persons are
! i against our institutions.
> Herbert L. Sominer, second Euphro
j nia debater, stated that the govern
- ment policy on this matter is a menace
i to free speech and is a most efficient
| means of spreading radical beliefs,
j After showing that the United States
j offers the working man better living
i conditions, Allan L. Dwyre, second
Senate speaker, pointed out that new
; radical ideas of social reform were not
needed in this country today.
Charles F. Prael, last Euphronia

representative, argued that by allow
ing foreign intellectuals to enter our
gates a greater stimulus toward prog
ress is received. In closing the debate,
Robert D. Tobey declared that the en- j
trance of foreign agitators would prove !
harmful.
A former president of the Euphronia 1
Society, George N. Crocker, was chair- I
man of the debate.
The Stanford debaters showed that!
the new law controlling the admission
of immigrants permits the Secretary j
of State alone to bar any alien from |
admission to this country. From this I
arbitrary decision there is no appeal. !
They condemned the actions of Secre
taries of State Hughes and Kellogg'
in imposing silence on Count Karolyi, j
former president of the Hungarian;
republic, as a condition to his entrance !
into this country, and for refusing ad-;
mission to Sakalatvala, a member of
the English parliament, who came to
America to attend the International j
Parliamentary Union. It was held that
the regulations are stricter than those
in force in European countries and
were so stringent that vises could be
cancelled on the passports of persons
no more radical in spirit than the Pil-1
grim Fathers.
California had as one of their argu
ments the extreme susceptibility of
the average American worker to radi- ■
cal suggestion.

organization, said that a great spread

needed in this country today.
Charles F. Prael, last Euphronia

representative, argued that by allow
ing foreign intellectuals to enter our
gates a greater stimulus toward prog

man of the debate.
The Stanford debaters showed that!
the new law controlling the admission
of immigrants permits the Secretary j
of State alone to bar any alien from |
admission to this country. From this I
arbitrary decision there is no appeal. !
They condemned the actions of Secre
taries of State Hughes and Kellogg'
in imposing silence on Count Karolyi, j
former president of the Hungarian;
republic, as a condition to his entrance !
into this country, and for refusing ad-;
mission to Sakalatvala, a member of
the English parliament, who came to
America to attend the International j
Parliamentary Union. It was held that
the regulations are stricter than those
in force in European countries and
were so stringent that vises could be
cancelled on the passports of persons
no more radical in spirit than the Pil-1
grim Fathers.
California had as one of their argu
ments the extreme susceptibility of
the average American worker to radi- ■
cal suggestion.
