# LIBRARY COMPLETES FULL COLLECTION OF MANDATE DOCUMENTS
## 
### 
i
i A collection of all reports made by
! governments concerning their man-1
; dates has recently been completed by
! the Hoover War Library. The collec-,
| tion is complete from the beginning
of each mandatory, with the exception
j of the first report of the French minis- i
ter of foreign affairs 011 Syria and
Lebanon; this document exists only
in Paris and can not be obtained.
Many of the documents are out of
print and are unobtainable only in the i
war library. The section of the collec
j tion devoted to reports of the South 1
i Sea Islands is especially noteworthy,,
j according to Miss Almond, Hoover j
I War librarian. The originals of the
; first two reports are in Tokyo, having
; been sent here, copied, and returned.
Up to last year most of these reports j
: were inaccessible, being published
only by the various governments. Last
year, however, a special fund was
raised by the League of Nations to
publish them.
So far, the League has not included !
1 in its files all the reports previously !
| put out by the individual governments,'
and may not be able to get all, as
| some are out of print. The Hoover I
War Library, however, has the full
and complete collection with the ex-|
ception of the report on Syria and j
| Lebanon mandate.
