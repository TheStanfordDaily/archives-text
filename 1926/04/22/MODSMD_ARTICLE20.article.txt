# OPERA CAST MAY STRIKE AS FIGHT LOOMS OVER DATE
## MAKE WALKOUT THREAT Row Starts as Ex Committee Grants Conflicting Dates For Prom and Opera 
### 
Efforts of the Dramatic Council to
plan an extra performance of the Jun
ior Opera on Friday evening, May 7,
may be shattered as a result of pro
tests and complaints registered by
members of the cast.
The cast has asked the Prom com
mittee to admit its members to tho
annual Junior formal after the Friday
night performance at reduced rates.
If this is not done, the show will
positively not be held Friday night,
according to a statement made this
morning by Charles Parks, director.
Members of the cast will not bÂ£
admitted to the Prom either on com
plimentary tickets or at reduced rates,
according to an announcement made
by the Junior Prom committee this
noon.
When ticket sales for the Prom
closed last night, only twenty-three re
mained for the senior sale which is
being held this afternoon. The chair
man of the ticket committee declared
this morning that a sell-out was as
sured, and further objected to admit
ting more than the prescribed three
hundred couples.
The Executive Committee granted
permission for the performance Friday
night subject to the approval of the
cast. The same night had already been
granted to the Junior Prom as a
closed date. If the Opera is not pre
sented on Friday evening, there will
be only one performance this year.
In past years presentations have
been held by the junior dramatists on
Thursday and Saturday evenings, leav
ing Friday open for the Prom. This
year a ruling has been passed that
there will be no junior activities what
soever on Thursday evening.
This legislation does away with the
annual Junior lake sports that has
played such a large part in the regular
Junior Week. Likewise the traditional
Cord Ball will not he held on Thurs
day afternoon, and it is impossible to
find any other time that is suitable.
