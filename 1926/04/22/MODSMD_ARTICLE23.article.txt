# The 						Herrin Incident
## 
### 
There is only mourning now in Herrin where a week ago guns spat fire
and six men were left dead upon the streets of that little mining town.
If one will turn back in his memory to the fall of 1922, he will remem
ber a like incident in Herrin, Illinois, in which twenty-one "scabs" were
shot down without mercy because they dared to buck the power of the
unions. The "Herrin Massacre" it has been termed, and no Indian up
rising in the days of the frontier battles was more ferocious.
The smoke of actual battle blew away following the 1922 massacre but
it left still the bitterness of factional grievances. There was yet a volcano
which needed little to set it off. Then came the Ku Klux Klan. Just the
mention of it now is sufficient to picture the probable results of its teach
ings in a mining community but Herrin welcomed it with open arms as the
panacea for its troubles.
But it seems not the destiny of the Klan to bring peace —despite its
protestations of earnest endeavor in that direction. The union and family
clans of Herrin could not, and would not, unite, and with the red-flag
spirit of the Klan to incite them, the factions of Herrin in 1924 again be
came embroiled.
Six were buried following that argument —three Klansmen and three
opposed to the organization.
Last week the voters of Herrin went to the polls seemingly bent upon
peaceful purposes. In some manner, however, a few shots were fired
which were the immediate signal for a miniature battle revolving about
the garage of one John Smith, as have the other two battles in this the
"bloodiest spot in bloody Williamson county."
Six men again lay dead upon the streets.
The weaknesses of the Klan have been prominent enough since its re
incarnation a number of years ago to give no need for descriptions in this
column. Any organization which seeks to substitute brute force and
prejudiced justice for the institution of Law administered with Mercy
and Reason cannot hope for support of the educated. The Klan's efforts
at clean-up have resulted in notiiing but class hatred and mistaken judg
ments. Misguided communities that have allowed the Klan to "purify"
them have never failed to slip back to their former conditions —probably
more hopeless than before the surgery of the Klan. Witness Herrin. it
will take years of patient work of some kind to restore sanity to Herrin;
work on the part ot the state and other solicitous communities.
But it is not alone the particular community itself which suffers in the
visitations of the K.K.K. The garage of John Smith of Herrin is typical
of the manner in which the innocent outsiders of other communities and
the country are unwillingly intangled in the petty fights of the Klan. It is
unfair enough when our ideas of Law and Order are challenged by a band
of white-robed horsemen who work by night, but when we are rudely
slapped in the face (so to speak) during the tights of the organization and
are drawn into its quarrels, we protest. The students of Stanford were
wise two years ago when they mocked the attempts of Klansmen to or
ganize on the campus and discouraged any further steps. As over the rest
of the United States, the Klan could have done nothing here but stir up
class hatred and be stepping continually upon the toes of the law-abiding
citizen.
IT HAS NEVER BEEN NECESSARY AT STANFORD, as it has
at so many other universities, for the college paper to bemoan loudly and
often the fact that the campus would be considerably more comely if waste
paper and rubbish were consigned to the proper receptacles. The students
have always shown proper respect.
But one practice lias grown which neither enhances the beauty of the
campus nor accomplishes its purpose. Organizations desiring publicity for
a meeting or function have delegated printers to chalk notices on walks,
roads, and stairways. These notices are not erased when they arc past
date; and are, therefore, many times merely confusing.
Safeguarding public morals in the wide open spaces of the state of
Kansas. The University Daily Kansan:
"The Kansas board of review was at the University Friday passing on the films
which are used by the extension division.
"Heretofore, the board lias always permitted the showing of educational films
without inspcctin gthem, but because of the objections raised by a few of the theaters
in the state, the hoard found it necessary to pass on educational films as well as
regular movie films."
The intriguing art of flattery as practiced by Fred H. Hunter, Mayor
of Des Moines. The Daily Trojan:
"With 2500 of the nation's star university and college and high school athletes
competing in the 17th Annual Drake Kelay meet here April 23 and 24, all that is
needed to make the event 100 per cent successful is to have the University of South
cm California represented by a strong team here."
