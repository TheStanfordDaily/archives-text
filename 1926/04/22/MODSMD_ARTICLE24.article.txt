Paris, April 19. —A new narcotic plant, the juice of which, when taken by
human beings, is said to produce visions and clairvoyant powers, has been the
subject of a series of experiments undertaken by a French. scientist. Dr.
Roubier. It is called "peyote" and is a rare species of cactus found in Mexico.
Paris, 111., April 22 —(C.N.S.) —Convicted on his seif-indictment, Prof.
Diedre Schmaltz has been forced to resign from the faculty of Rover College
where he was formerly head of the biology department. The unwitting be
trayer in the case is Olaf McCubbin, now in his fourth freshman year.
Prof. Schmaltz was instructing a class in freshman biology, of which
McCubbin was a member, and conducting experiments in the clairvoyant
phenomena generated by the juice of "peyote," a Mexican plant which was
recently discovered by Dr. Roubier. Dr. Roubier is a native of the French
city, the name of which is so often confused with that of Paris, 111., gem of
the corn belt.
In an attempt to obtain first-hand information as to the action of this
plant in endowing imbibers with the ability to read minds, Prof. Schmaltz
proposed an experiment to his freshman class immediately before springing
an examination.
After briefly explaining the properties of the narcotic juice for fifteen
minutes, Prof. Schmaltz asked, "Now who would like a drink?"
There was a clatter of books falling in the back of the room as McCubbin
woke up.
"Yo! You bet. What cha got?" McCubbin shouted. "Set 'em up all around."
At this point Prof. Schmaltz announced an examination to quiet the
tittering. McCubbin was called to the front of the room where the savant
gave him a set of examination questions and a foaming stein of peyote juice.
Without stopping to determine the contents of the tumbler, McCubbin tossed
it off in a gulp and immediately became rigid.
The professor read the first question aloud and with his eyes glassily
concentrated in Schmaltz, McCubbin wrote.
As the examination ended, the effects of the drink wore off and McCubbin
resumed his normal attitude of somnolence while the professor read his paper.
A hush fell over the class, each member of which knew that their fellow
student had read the answers in the mind of the professor. They were eager
to compare their answers with the perfect result.
To their amazement, a frown beclouded Prof. Schmaltz's countenance.
"Mr. McCubbin," he declared, "you have been in my class for many years
and your work has ever been characterized by its extreme qualities. I find
the improvement in this paper, written under the influence of peyote, to be
enormous. You have improved four times. I have no hesitation in using an
expression which is high praise for your efforts.
"This paper is lousy—wrong from beginning to end."
The class broke up in confusion, but at the door the instructor, one Julius
Velasquez, stopped McCubbin to offer him another drink after his superior
had left the room. This final test of the potency of the clairvoyant concoction
was made before about half the members of the class, who had not. yet left.
As usual, McCubbin drank. He stared at the instructor.
"Of what am I thinking?" Velasquez demanded.
"You are thinking that Prof. Schmaltz doesn't know sie'em from scat."
"Correct," was the reply.
Following an investigation by the university authorities, Schmaltz's
resignation was demanded.
He was given the best of recommendations upon his departure in search
of other academic employment and the further use of peyote juice in experi
mentation was forbidden by the authorities.
"You never can tell," is all President Oscar Spivis would say when inter
viewed on this phase of the case.

N. E. Briate was just the man to live a carefree life;
He didn't care what happened for, of course, he had a wife.
She was like funny paper wives who wait up late at night,
Attended by their rolling pins—she dearly loved a fight.
N. E. was quite a jolly bum who knew his onions, too!
And when at night he'd sopped a lot, he'd figured what to do.
He used to stop along the way and find a comfy spot,
Where he would sleep a portion off. if he was fully shot.
As evening came, N. E. went out with fellows he could trust,
And found the stuff —oh, they knew where —and then went on a bust.
Before the moon had made a glow, or many stars were bright,
Briate and all his crowd of handy friends were good and tight.
They drank it all, and then broke up and N. E. started home.
And dropped in on the City Zoo for sleep to clear his dome.
The cell he picked to lay him down and get his needed rest,
Was with an ostrich, who rose up and kicked him in the vest.
Again he kicked him —this was one that hit him in the strife;
And then he found the critter's neck, and hung on for dear life.
He thought the kicks were loving blows delivered by his frau;
The neck to him the door post was, which he hung onto now.
And finally the loving grip he had the ostrich by
Was too much —with a final kick, the bird lay down to die.
N. E. Briate, his muddled brain announcing that he'd made
His wife stop hitting him, was proud to stop her fierce tirade,
And, lying down to what he thought was home and lovely bed.
He slept—where, when the morning came, he saw the ostrich dead.
And then the keeper came, an dpaid Briate a hundred bones; —
They'd planned to shoot it anyhow; he'd saved them all the groans.

A hush fell over the class, each member of which knew that their fellow

To their amazement, a frown beclouded Prof. Schmaltz's countenance.

Velasquez, stopped McCubbin to offer him another drink after his superior

Following an investigation by the university authorities, Schmaltz's

He was given the best of recommendations upon his departure in search
of other academic employment and the further use of peyote juice in experi

Paris, April 19. —A new narcotic plant, the juice of which, when taken by
human beings, is said to produce visions and clairvoyant powers, has been the
subject of a series of experiments undertaken by a French. scientist. Dr.
Roubier. It is called "peyote" and is a rare species of cactus found in Mexico.
Paris, 111., April 22 —(C.N.S.) —Convicted on his seif-indictment, Prof.
Diedre Schmaltz has been forced to resign from the faculty of Rover College
where he was formerly head of the biology department. The unwitting be
trayer in the case is Olaf McCubbin, now in his fourth freshman year.
Prof. Schmaltz was instructing a class in freshman biology, of which
McCubbin was a member, and conducting experiments in the clairvoyant
phenomena generated by the juice of "peyote," a Mexican plant which was
recently discovered by Dr. Roubier. Dr. Roubier is a native of the French
city, the name of which is so often confused with that of Paris, 111., gem of
the corn belt.
In an attempt to obtain first-hand information as to the action of this
plant in endowing imbibers with the ability to read minds, Prof. Schmaltz
proposed an experiment to his freshman class immediately before springing
an examination.
After briefly explaining the properties of the narcotic juice for fifteen
minutes, Prof. Schmaltz asked, "Now who would like a drink?"
There was a clatter of books falling in the back of the room as McCubbin
woke up.
"Yo! You bet. What cha got?" McCubbin shouted. "Set 'em up all around."
At this point Prof. Schmaltz announced an examination to quiet the
tittering. McCubbin was called to the front of the room where the savant
gave him a set of examination questions and a foaming stein of peyote juice.
Without stopping to determine the contents of the tumbler, McCubbin tossed
it off in a gulp and immediately became rigid.
The professor read the first question aloud and with his eyes glassily
concentrated in Schmaltz, McCubbin wrote.
As the examination ended, the effects of the drink wore off and McCubbin
resumed his normal attitude of somnolence while the professor read his paper.
A hush fell over the class, each member of which knew that their fellow

NEWS ITEM
Paris, April 19. —A new narcotic plant, the juice of which, when taken by
human beings, is said to produce visions and clairvoyant powers, has been the
subject of a series of experiments undertaken by a French. scientist. Dr.
Roubier. It is called "peyote" and is a rare species of cactus found in Mexico.
Paris, 111., April 22 —(C.N.S.) —Convicted on his seif-indictment, Prof.
Diedre Schmaltz has been forced to resign from the faculty of Rover College
where he was formerly head of the biology department. The unwitting be
trayer in the case is Olaf McCubbin, now in his fourth freshman year.
Prof. Schmaltz was instructing a class in freshman biology, of which
McCubbin was a member, and conducting experiments in the clairvoyant
phenomena generated by the juice of "peyote," a Mexican plant which was
recently discovered by Dr. Roubier. Dr. Roubier is a native of the French
city, the name of which is so often confused with that of Paris, 111., gem of
the corn belt.
In an attempt to obtain first-hand information as to the action of this
plant in endowing imbibers with the ability to read minds, Prof. Schmaltz
proposed an experiment to his freshman class immediately before springing
an examination.
After briefly explaining the properties of the narcotic juice for fifteen
minutes, Prof. Schmaltz asked, "Now who would like a drink?"
There was a clatter of books falling in the back of the room as McCubbin
woke up.
"Yo! You bet. What cha got?" McCubbin shouted. "Set 'em up all around."
At this point Prof. Schmaltz announced an examination to quiet the
tittering. McCubbin was called to the front of the room where the savant
gave him a set of examination questions and a foaming stein of peyote juice.
Without stopping to determine the contents of the tumbler, McCubbin tossed
it off in a gulp and immediately became rigid.
The professor read the first question aloud and with his eyes glassily
concentrated in Schmaltz, McCubbin wrote.
As the examination ended, the effects of the drink wore off and McCubbin
resumed his normal attitude of somnolence while the professor read his paper.
A hush fell over the class, each member of which knew that their fellow
student had read the answers in the mind of the professor. They were eager
to compare their answers with the perfect result.
To their amazement, a frown beclouded Prof. Schmaltz's countenance.
"Mr. McCubbin," he declared, "you have been in my class for many years
and your work has ever been characterized by its extreme qualities. I find
the improvement in this paper, written under the influence of peyote, to be
enormous. You have improved four times. I have no hesitation in using an
expression which is high praise for your efforts.
"This paper is lousy—wrong from beginning to end."
The class broke up in confusion, but at the door the instructor, one Julius
Velasquez, stopped McCubbin to offer him another drink after his superior
had left the room. This final test of the potency of the clairvoyant concoction
was made before about half the members of the class, who had not. yet left.
As usual, McCubbin drank. He stared at the instructor.
"Of what am I thinking?" Velasquez demanded.
"You are thinking that Prof. Schmaltz doesn't know sie'em from scat."
"Correct," was the reply.
Following an investigation by the university authorities, Schmaltz's
resignation was demanded.
He was given the best of recommendations upon his departure in search
of other academic employment and the further use of peyote juice in experi
mentation was forbidden by the authorities.
"You never can tell," is all President Oscar Spivis would say when inter
viewed on this phase of the case.
