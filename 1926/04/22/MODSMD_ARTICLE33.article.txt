A 37 millimeter infantry field gun,
burst by the premature explosion of
the shell in the barrel, has been re
ceived from the government by the
metallurgy department. It will be used

Only the burst bore of the gun is
in the department, as it tore itself
from the breach on bursting. The im
pression of the shell is in the coring,
showing that it was a premature ex
plosion.
Work on the barrel will include
metallographic, physical, and chemical
tests of the steel of the gun. The steel
