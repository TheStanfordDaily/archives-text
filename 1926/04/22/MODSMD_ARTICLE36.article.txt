With an increasing population, the
highest educational opportunities can
not bo granted to all, nor is it desir
able to do so, says President Wilbur j
in a special symposium on "Remaking'
the College," published as a supple-1
ment to The New Republic of April 14. J
The variability in human qualities
is great, and high intellectual capacity \
is not common enough to expect that
many will profit by advanced univer- '
sity work, according to President Wil-1
bur. The development of the junior
college, permitting a stopping point
for students at the end of the sopho
more year of college work, will take
care of the largest burden of students.

University of Oregon underclassmen
successfully put out an edition of the !
Ashland Tidings in spring vacation.
