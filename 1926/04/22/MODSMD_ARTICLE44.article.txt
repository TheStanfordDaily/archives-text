### 
Preliminary rounds of the women's
interclass tennis tournament will start
the second week in May, according to
an announcement made yesterday by
Frances Clancy, tennis manager.
Class competition will begin at this
time, the class champions meeting
later fo rthe interclass title. Finals in
the interclass series are decided on
Field Day, May 29.
Jean -Ward and Mabel Macferran
should be the chief contenders for the
senior class title. The former has rep
resented 1926 in the interclass compe
tition in previous years and is favored
to win again.
Charlotte Lovekin seems to be the
best bet for the juniors. With the loss
of Betty Williams and Laura Gardiner
the juniors' chances have been ma
terially weakened. The latter was
runner-up in the interclass series last
year.
There are many sophomore contend
ers for the class team with Lida Rit
tler, class winner last year, and Julia
North as the outstanding players.
In Helen Bell, the freshmen have a
tennis player who should stand a
strong chance of getting through to
the finals. Sue Curtis is another fresh
man prospect who has been doing well
in practice.
All women expecting to enter the
tournament should be in training by
now. As soon as all entrants have
signed up. the schedule of play will be
announced.
