# UNIVERSITY RECEIVES SIXTY-FIVE POLICIES FROM SERVICE MEN
## 
### 
Bonus policies turned over to the
University now number 65, according
to John A. Sellards, endowment secre
tary and director of the summer quar
ter.
A campaign was started a year ago
last fall to have the Stanford ex-ser
vice men turn over the bonus policies
issued them by the government. Since
then over $50,000 has been obtained
for the University in this manner.
The policies mature at the end of
twenty years. If before that time the
possessor of the policies dies, the total
face value of it goes to the beneficiary
named by him. The policies are also
good as security on certain amounts
of money depending on their value.
This varies in accordance with the age
of the person, and whether or not he
served over seas or here, and the
length of his service.
A University of Wisconsin woman
recently admitted that she had not
been to a movie since the days when
Charlie Chaplin made his debut.
