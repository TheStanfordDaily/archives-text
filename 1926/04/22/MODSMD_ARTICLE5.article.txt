# BOARD OF DIRECTORS CHANGES RULES FOR W.A.A. POINT SYSTEM
## Award Increase for Women Who Report Regularly And Keep Training 
### 
Revision of the W.A.A. point system
was carried through last night at the
! meeting of the organization's directing
board. Changes in team and squad
points will go into effect immediately,
whereas the new scholarship point
plan will not be used until next fall
quarter.
Under the new system, squad points
have been increased to 25 for all
women who report for a sport and
keep training. Women who keep train
ing but are not out for any sport will
be given 10 points. Team points will
be as usual: first team, 100 points;
substitute, 75; second team, 50.
A special point system was adopted
for tennis because of the present
elimination by tournament play. The
winner of each class tournament will
receive 100 points, and the runner-up
will have 75. In addition, the coach
may select not more than two other
women in each class who will also re
%
ceive 75 points.
The number of points to be awarded
for scholastic achievement by women
in athletics was reduced from 50 per
cent additional for an "A" average and
10 per cent for a "B". total. The old
system will be used for the rest of this
year.
The custom of having women sign
training slips each week was rein
stated last night. The board gave as
its reason for the resumption of this
system that under the four-hour sports
practice plan, teams do not practice
together at the beginning of the sea
son, and the captains have difficulty
in reaching the players to get their
training reports. The new ruling will
go into effect at once. It will also as
sist the managers materially, the
board says, in keeping the training
records of women who are not en
rolled in sports.
The board voted to buy a new start
er's gun to be used in track and swim
ming meets. The old gun, characterized
by the board as "an antique," has been
in serious disrepair for some time.
The board also considered an appro
priation for another gun so that one
would not have to serve for two sports
whose hours might conflict, but action j
was suspending pending a hearing of
the treasurer's report.
Marie Manchee made a report on
the convention of the Western Divi-j
sion of the Athletic Confederation of
American College Women, which was j
held at Pullman, Washington, last
week. The conference went on record
as favoring the building of lodges by !
women's athletic associations and as
desiring that college women's outing
clubs separate from the W.A.A. or-1
ganizations be discouraged. The con
vention also passed a resolution to
recommend that Eastern as well as
Western women's athletic organiza
tions follow the policy of having no
intercollegiate competition of any
sort.
The next convention of the Western
Division of A.C.A.C.W. will be held at
Tucson, Arizona, in the spring of 1928.
