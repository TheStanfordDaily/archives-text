# DEKES TRIUMPH OVER PHI PSIS IN HARD GAME
## Ackley's Pitching Too Much For Losing Batters; Final Score 5-2 EXTRA INNING PLAYED Los Arcos Loses to Kappa Alpha Nine as Morrill Wins Own Game 
### 
Led by the strong mound work o!
Ackley, the Delta Kappa Epsilon nine
triumphed over the Phi Kappa Psi
squad yesterday afternoon by a 5-2
score. The game was hard fought
throughout, and easily represented one
of the beÃŸt games played so far this
season.
The Dekes took the lead in the first
inning with a single marker brought
in by Stanley. Three strikeouts and
three putouts were handed the Phi
Psis in the first and second, who in
turn retaliated in the second and third
innings and kept the Dekes shut out
with four strikeouts and two putouts.
Mack Ties Score
Mack of the Phi Psi's managed to tie
the score in the third when he hit,
stole third, and then home. A three
base hit by Ackley in the following
inning brought the Dekes in position
to again take the lead. The game was
definitely settled in the sixth when
Sims, Ackley, and Murphy of the
Dekes trotted around for scores, as
sisted by the errors of Price and
Troyer of the opposing team.
The pitching was strong on both
sides and resulted in a continual
string of strikeouts. Ackley and Nolan
made up the Deke battery, and Pabst
and Speer that of the Phi Psi's.
Extra Inning Played
Kappa Alpha won from Los Arcos,
f>-4. The game was nip and tuck
throughout, an extra inning being
necessary to decide the outcome. Vic
tory was doubly sweet for the fra
ternity men, as their pitcher, Garth
waite, was spiked deep into the shin
bone as he was sliding home in the
last of the fourth, and when he left
the game, the outlook was not en
couraging.
But Clif Morrill stepped into the box
and executed eight strikeouts in the
four remaining innings and otherwise
effectively blanked the club team. To
cap the climax, Morrill walked to the
plate in the last of the eighth, with
the score tied at 4-all and two men on,
hammered out a double, and won his
own game.
Los Arcos Scores
Los Arcos started the scoring in the
third when Shannon hit with three
men on base, scoring Hunkins. Garth
waite walked Cooper, which carried
Beckwith across the plate. Ted Criley
reached second on an error, allowing
Dobbins and Shannon to score. With
men on second and third, Gallery
struck out, retiring his side.
The Kappa Alpha team came to bat
in the last of the third, trailing 0-4.
Garthwaite Morrill singled,
advancing him to second, Lake hit,
and the bases were full. McManigal
singled, scoring Garthwaite, and then
Wright hit, bringing in Morrill and
Lake. This ended the scoring for the
third.
Garthwaite delivered three strike
outs for Kappa Alpha in the first of
the fourth, and in the last of that
inning was spiked by Williams, Los
Arcos catcher, and left the game.
Tied in Fifth
Kappa Alpha evened the score, 4-all,
in the fifth inning, when Hartwell
doubled and scored on McManigal's
hit. The game then resolved itself into
a pitchers' duel, Morrill mowing down
the batters for the K. A.'s, and Wilt
for Los Arcos. No one hit until Yoak
um came to bat for Kappa Alpha in
the last of the eighth. Yoakum hit,
and was advanced by Smith's single.
Then Morrill doubled to left field,
scoring the winning run.
