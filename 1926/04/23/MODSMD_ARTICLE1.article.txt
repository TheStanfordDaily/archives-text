triumphed over the Phi Kappa Psi
squad yesterday afternoon by a 5-2
score. The game was hard fought

turn retaliated in the second and third
innings and kept the Dekes shut out
with four strikeouts and two putouts.
Mack Ties Score
Mack of the Phi Psi's managed to tie

The pitching was strong on both
sides and resulted in a continual
