# FIGHTERS MEET FOR HONORS IN 1926 TOURNEY
## University Championships Decided Tonight in Six Divisions SCHALL DEFENDS TITLE Ross, Goldwater to Settle Feud for Lightweight Class Laurels 
### 
University boxing champions for
1926 will be decided this evening be
i ginning at 8 o'clock in the Encina
I gymnasium when the final bouts in
! six weights will be held. The finalists
S have reached the last round through
! victories in elimination matches held
! during the present week. No admis
! sion will be charged this evening to
i those presenting A.S.S.U. cards,
i Myron Schall, captain of the Stan
i ford varsity boxing team, will meet
Andrews in the bout for middleweight
; honors. Andrews surprised by defeat
ing Farwell, 1926 novice champion, in
I a four-round bout yesterday, winning
I his decision by virtue of several well
placed blows, and by superior endur
i ance which enabled him to last the
I extra and deciding round. Schall, one
I of the best boxers the Cards have ever
I had, is a heavy favorite, and his bout
| with Andrews should be hardly more
j than a workout.
To Settle Old Feud
I Ross and Goldwater, who have both
represented the varsity in matches
i this year, will settle an old feud. Gold
i water won the novice championship
' in the lightweight class last year, and
j earned a varsity berth when last
I year's representative did not return
;to school. Ross, however, developed
i fast, supplanted Goldwater in the last
Stanford matches, and so shared with
i his rival the lightweight honors. Gold
water yesterday defeated Brockway in
a very close bout, the latter coming
j back in the final round and nearly
1 reversing the decision on his oppon
ent.
|
Hahn forfeited to Raaf, and the lat
-1 ter will meet Lloyd in the finals to
night. As Harry Stevenson, varsity
welterweight, has not registered in
school, Raaf and Lloyd will make bids
for the Card squad next year. Miron,
Stanford featherweight, will meet Mc-
Call, novice champion, in the second
! bout of the evening.
The closest bout of the evening
1 should be between Norm Fain, Card
light-heavy this year, and Dorman.
| Dorman showed promise in his fresh
[ man year, but dropped out of school
I and has only recently re-registered.
! The two are fast and hard hitters,
evenly matched physically, and should
furnish three rounds of clever fighting.
Referee for the bouts which will be
called at 8 o'clock sharp, will be Dan
Flint, formerly of the Stanford boxing
team, and also an ex-Pacific Coast
lightweight champion. Mort Black
j burn and Jack Feeley, both close fol
lowers of Stanford athletic activities,
will be the judges.

will be the judges.
University boxing champions for
1926 will be decided this evening be
i ginning at 8 o'clock in the Encina
I gymnasium when the final bouts in
! six weights will be held. The finalists
S have reached the last round through
! victories in elimination matches held
! during the present week. No admis
! sion will be charged this evening to
i those presenting A.S.S.U. cards,
i Myron Schall, captain of the Stan
i ford varsity boxing team, will meet
Andrews in the bout for middleweight
; honors. Andrews surprised by defeat
ing Farwell, 1926 novice champion, in
I a four-round bout yesterday, winning
I his decision by virtue of several well
placed blows, and by superior endur
i ance which enabled him to last the
I extra and deciding round. Schall, one
I of the best boxers the Cards have ever
I had, is a heavy favorite, and his bout
| with Andrews should be hardly more
j than a workout.
To Settle Old Feud
I Ross and Goldwater, who have both
represented the varsity in matches
i this year, will settle an old feud. Gold
i water won the novice championship
' in the lightweight class last year, and
j earned a varsity berth when last
I year's representative did not return
;to school. Ross, however, developed
i fast, supplanted Goldwater in the last
Stanford matches, and so shared with
i his rival the lightweight honors. Gold
water yesterday defeated Brockway in
a very close bout, the latter coming
j back in the final round and nearly
1 reversing the decision on his oppon
ent.
|
Hahn forfeited to Raaf, and the lat
-1 ter will meet Lloyd in the finals to
night. As Harry Stevenson, varsity
welterweight, has not registered in
school, Raaf and Lloyd will make bids
for the Card squad next year. Miron,
Stanford featherweight, will meet Mc-
Call, novice champion, in the second
! bout of the evening.
The closest bout of the evening
1 should be between Norm Fain, Card
light-heavy this year, and Dorman.
| Dorman showed promise in his fresh
[ man year, but dropped out of school
I and has only recently re-registered.
! The two are fast and hard hitters,
evenly matched physically, and should
furnish three rounds of clever fighting.
Referee for the bouts which will be
called at 8 o'clock sharp, will be Dan
Flint, formerly of the Stanford boxing
team, and also an ex-Pacific Coast
lightweight champion. Mort Black
j burn and Jack Feeley, both close fol
lowers of Stanford athletic activities,
will be the judges.
