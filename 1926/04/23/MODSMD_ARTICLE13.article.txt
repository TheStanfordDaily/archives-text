# Six Concerts May Be Presented At Stanford In 1927
## 
### 
Several or America's most distin
guished singers will be heard at Stan
ford next year tinder the auspices of
the student body if the plan spon
sored by the Executive Committee re
ceives the necessary number of sub
scription pledges. Provided that 1500
students signify their intention of tak
ing the $3 season tickets for the six
concerts, the plan will go into effect
and the campus will be assured of its
most distinguished musical season.

The list of artists who will be se
cured reads like a page from the musi
cians' Hall of Fame. Mischa Elman,
world-famous violin virtuoso, and his
string quartette, who are declared to
be almost without equal in their field,
are scheduled.
Graveure Will Sing
Many campus men and women will
find an old acquaintance in Louis Gra
veure, the distinguished Belgian bari
tone, who sang the solo role in the
oratorio, "Elijah," presented in the
Stanford stadium two years ago. Gra
veure is rated by competent critics as
the premier baritone on the concert
stage. Each year has added to his
fame in this country.

Two of the greatest singers of the
Metropolitan Opera Company "will fin
ish the season next March. They are
Rosa Ponselle, soprano, whose lyric
voice and attractive personality have
made her a concert favorite as well as
the idol of Eastern opera-goers, and
Tito Schipa, tenor, who now ranks as
one of America's favorite singers. He
has been touring the country or two
consecutive seasons with brilliant suc
cess in all recitals.

The concert series will include an
appearance of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra under the leadership
of Dr. Alfred Hertz. Because of finan
i cial difficulties it is probable that the
Stanford Symphony Committee will be
; unable to bring the orchestra to the
campus next season as it has done
during the past ten years, so that the
new plan will be the means of pre
serving the orchestra to the campus
for at least one appearance.
Pavilion to Be Used
The basketball pavilion will be used
for all the concerts because of its
seating capacity and excellent acous
tics. It is expected that audiences to
taling four or five thousand will hear
the concerts, for besides the student
attendance there will be a large num
ber of Peninsula music lovers to seize
the opportunity of hearing such re
nowned musicians. The special season
rate of $3 for all features is low when
compared with even the minimum
charges made for individual concerts
of these same artists. Seats corres
ponding in worth to those in the
pavilion bring $3 and $4 per concert
in San Francisco. It is possible to offer
a low rate because of the large seat
ing capacity of the Pavilion and the
guarantees which must be obtained
before any of the contracts are signed.
Next Tuesday members of all living
groups will be given the opportunity
to signify how many season tickets
they will take. The opportunity is
j greater than anything before offered
j at Stanford. It has been years since
j it has been possible to hear any art
ists of the caliber of those on the pro
| gram any place nearer than San Fran
cisco and then always at prohibitive
prices.
Six Concerts Planned
The six concerts will be distributed
[ over the three quarters of next year.
Graveure and Elman will come during
the autumn quarter and Schipa and
Ponsella in the winter. The exact date
for the Symphony, and for the sixth
concert, yet to be announced, are not
fixed.
