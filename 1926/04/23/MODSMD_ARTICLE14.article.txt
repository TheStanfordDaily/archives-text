# SENIORS AT OREGON GIVEN QUESTIONS ON CAMPUS PROBLEMS
## 
### 
Questionnaires were recently dis
tributed among the seniors at the Uni
versity of Oregon to ascertain their
opinion on campus problems. The an
swers to 1300 questionnaires showed
that intercollegiate athletics are more
favored among fraternity men and
women than among non-fraternity,
the latter showing a desire for more
inrtmural competition.

Class discussion, or at least a com
bination of discussion and lectures, is
the type of instruction preferred. Com
pulsory class attendance was downed
by a two to one vote. The seniors
found that not more than fifty per
cent of the professors are "stimulat
ing" and that a freshman course on
"How to Study" would be valuable.
The vote on various methods of grad
ing or abolition of all grades gave no
clear expression of opinion.
The value of activities was con
firmed by a large portion of the voters,
most of whom declared that they
would spend as much or more time on
extra-curriculum pursuits if they could
re-live their college career. Academic
work was held to be of more worth
to the student than activities.

Two-thirds of the seniors admitted
dissatisfaction with their scholastic
records. For this they blamed lack of
stimulus by professors, too many so
cial interests, lack of high school pre
paration, and outside work, in the
order named.
Sorority women were the only group
favoring compulsory military training,
a majority of the seniors being in
favor of making such training optional.
Fraternity women were also found to
be in the habit of holding individual
conferences with professors, while
most students did not wish them, or
were fearful of "bootlicking."

The Oregon seniors further ex
pressed their disapproval of several
departments and their methods.
