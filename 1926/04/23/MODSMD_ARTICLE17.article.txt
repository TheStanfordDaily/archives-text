# SPRING FOOTBALL TO END FRIDAY AFTER FIVE-WEEK WORKOUT
## Several Men of Last Year's Freshman Team Show Up Well in Practice 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Spring football practice will close
next Friday, after a period of work
outs covering five weeks. Coach War
ner, with the aid of Kerr, Hunt, Thorn
hill, and Davis, has been putting his
men through strenuous periods.

A practice game will be included in
this afternoon's workout in which
everybody out for the team* will play.
Another practice game will be played
next Friday, probably in the stadium.
This will conclude the spring session,
work being resumed next fall on the
fifteenth of September.

Since the completion of freshman
track and baseball, several of Hunt's
last year's freshman team are out for
practice and are showing up well.
Among those attracting particular at
tention are Lewis, freshman quarter
back; Harder and Worden, ends; and
Artman, tackle. These men, bulwarks
011 Hunt's squad last year, are con
sistently turning out good work.

Several members of last year's
Grays are developing rapidly under
Warner's instruction, including Casey,
a guard; Morley, a tackle; and David
son, an end. Smalling, freshman full
back, and Fleishhacker, freshman
linesman, have both been working out
at fullback. Although none have
done too well this spring, more is ex
pected of them with added experience.
There are men from last year's fresh
man and goof teams whose perform
ances so far give promise of keen
competition with varsity men Â»for
their positions.

Doyle, giant freshman guard from
last year, will be of great aid in build
ing a heavy line, as will Simons, a
transfer from lowa State, who was in
eligible last year. Simons bids well to
fill the hole left by the transfer of
Captain Fred Swan to quarterback.

Quarterback and fullback are the
positions causing Warner the most
worry, since Solomon-'and Mitchell, in
the former place, and Nevers in the
latter completed their last year of var-

sity competition last year. The spring
practice, however, has put a new light
on the subject, with the development,
of Eli Post, Captain Swan, and Spud
Lewis at quarterback, and Walker,
Smalling, and Patchett at full. It is
certain that competent backfield men
can be made from these candidates, j
Other candidates trying out for full
are S. Post, Bogue, Fleishhacker,]
Young, and Jacobs.

At work with the varsity players are I
several freshmen for the 1930 team,'
who will form the basis of Coach
Hunt's next year's squad. Archie
Rauta, weight over 200 pounds, at
tackle, Julius Mai at half, A. E. For
ster, T. A. Driscoll, R. J. Hulen. and
W. H. Burke in the line, and R. R.
Dowling in the backfleld are men of
great promise, who have taken this
opportunity to get in some ground
work in the sport under Hunt.
