# SOPHOMORE, JUNIOR TENNIS SQUADS TIED IN INTERCLASS RACE
## Ned Wheldon Beats Frank Dunn in Big Upset Of Tournament 
### 
With three matches each, the inter
class tennis match between the un
defeated sophomore and junior teams
ended yesterday in a tie, with the re
maining first doubles match to be
played today.

Ned Wheldon, former Branch varsity
man and second singles player for the
juniors, scored the upset of the day by
eliminating Frank Dunn, sophomore
star, in three long sets. Dunn captured
the first advantage at 8-6, but dropped
the following two sets 7-5 and 6-3
under the steady driving of his op
ponent.
Gomer Thomas, of the varsity squad
and ranking player of the glass of *28,
defeated Henry Roberts in sequence

sets 6-3, 6-3. In the first set, Roberts
played cautiously but opened up in the
latter set to make the play closer and
more interesting. Thomas' accurate
forehand drives and general steadi
ness dominated most of the play.
Harry Todd annexed the second
singles win for the juniors by con
quering James Mansfield in straight
order, 6-4, 6-1. Todd was in excellent
form, and with hard serves and drives,
forehand and backhand, he swept his
tenacious opponent into the discard.
Mansfield gained some retribution
in the doubles matches. Paired with
Harold Way, he subdued Harry Israel
and Joe Thomas 7-5, 7-5. Both times
the sophomores established leads at
5-2, but barely nosed out the match
with deuced sets.
The juniors went into the lead again
when Wheldon and Roberts captured
a long struggle from Joseph Cook and
Kenneth Dow 6-0. 3-6, 6-3. The vie-

torious pair started strongly, but their
efforts proved a stimulus to their op
ponents, who fought for every point.
Jack Beard and Lawrence Wey
mouth evened the score for the second
year men in two decisive sets from
Jaek Leiter and David Evans. Well
placed shots forceij the upperclass
representatives to make weak returns
which were summarily dealt with.
The final doubles match is as fol
lows: Gomer Thomas and Frank Dunn
vs. Henry Roberts and Alan McCray.
