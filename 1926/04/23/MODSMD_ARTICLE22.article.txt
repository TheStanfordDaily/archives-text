The University of Nebraska graduate who complained that college
wasted four years of his life should be referred to an article in the current
Liberty. After careful study of the official records of the Massachusetts
Department of Labor and of the careers of all graduates of Boston Uni
versity, Dr. Everett W. Lord, Dean of the College of Business Adminis
tration at that institution, concludes that a college graduate earns in his
lifetime $150,000. This is $105,000 more than the man who did not go
beyond the primary grades. A high school graduate, according to Dean
Lord, earns $72,000 less than his college brother, but $.33,000 more than
the untrained worker.
Dean Lord finds that the untrained man, starting as a boy of fourteen,
reaches maximum income at thirty. Since his income is largely depend
ent on manual dexterity it falls off at fifty or earlier to a point below self
support. The high school graduate, starting at eighteen, passes the un
trained worker and rises steadily to his own maximum of about $2,200 at
forty. The permanent earnings of the college graduate do not begin until
twenty-two, but since his income depends on mental ability it increases
instead of diminishes with the years. By the time he is thirty he is getting
$2,800; at forty he reaches the $4,000 mark. Ten years later he has passed
$5,000 and at three score his average salary is $6,000.
Dr. Lord considers his conclusions thoroughly representative. "Mas
sachusetts," he says, "may be used confidently as a cross-section of the
entire country, because the ratio of college men and untrained workers is
substantially the same in other states and because Massachusetts has as
great a variety of occupations as any other state." He does noto guaran
tee a life income of $150,000 to every person who passes four years in an
institution of higher learning. Just as there are moguls of big business
who never had even the primary grade training, but whose yearly earnings
equal the lifetime income of the average college graduate, so "there are
College men who do not earn anything. Education cannot be grafted on
a min dthat wil not receive it."—Columbia Spectator.
