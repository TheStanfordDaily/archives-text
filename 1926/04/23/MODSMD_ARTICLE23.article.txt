In twenty-five years the class of 1926 will turn over to the University
$100,000 in cash, providing that 400 of its members take advantage of the
plan which has been considered and sanctioned by the Senior Endowment
Committee. The scheme requires that the individual seniors each take out
a $250 endowment insurance policy, making the University the beneficiary.
With over 500 seniors enrolled, it is probably not overly optimistic to ex
pect 400 to take out policies, the yearly premium ( for which will be only
$6.50.
Similar schemes have been tried at Stanford l>efore; but have failed,
partially because the seniors have been indifferent and partially because
the campaigns were started too late in the year. This year sufficient time
has been allotted—the insurance agents will begin their canvass immedi
ately. The success or failure of the plan depends upon the support of the
class members. The amount of the yearly premium should not prove a
great burden.
This method of giving a graduation gift is an admirable one. If every
class follows suit, the University will benefit greatly—sloo,ooo annually
is a substantial income.
