Last week the Daily expressed what it believed to I>e the sentiment of j
the student body—that there was need for a storage garage 011 the campus. I
A questionnaire coupon was inserted in the paper four times, in order to j
determine the approximate number of students who would be willing to
patronize the garage if it were erected. To date only twelve replies have
been received.
We are at a loss to explain the situation. Either the auto owners are 1
indifferent or the coupon has escaped unnoticed. However, the question
naire is submitted today for the last time.

High indignation at Reed College. One Lester Halpin plays the j
martyr as he resigns from the Qifcst:
"To the Editor: I fed that lam justified in taking exception to your proclaim- j
ing to the world that I am a puppet in your hands—that you pull a string and I dance. [
When your trenchant pen wrote 'we had Halpin say,' you unwittingly made my ac
quisition of any prestige as a writer impossible, and put me in somdwhat the intel- I
lectual class of a dog who plays dead at bis master's bidding or the parrot who says -
'damn.'"
