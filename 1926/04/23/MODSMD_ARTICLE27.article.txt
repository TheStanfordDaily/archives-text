# MOSAICS ON CHAPEL ARE MOST EXTENSIVE OF TYPE IN AMERICA

### Hallie Keating 
Mosaic work on the Memorial |
Church represents the most extensive ;
use of this method of decoration in '
America. This type was selected by !
Mrs. Stanford, who had noted its ef- i
fectiveness in Italy. The mosaics them- j
selves came from the studio of Dr.
Salviatti in Venice.
The method by which these mosaics j
were placed was much simpler than !
the old one of creating the figures as |
they were made. After the subject I
was designed cuts of various sec-j
tions were distributed to experienced j
artisans who proceeded separately j
with their work. On being completed j
the sections were packed in cases and i
Lorenzo Zampato superintended the!
placing of them here.
Rebuilt After Quake
Zampato also worked in the repro-:
ducing and restoring of the Church i
after the earthquake of 1906. At this
time the bell tower fell, the stone
walls were cracked, and part of the
interior was injured. In reconstruc
tion. care was taken to assure perma
nence. Each stone of the original
structure was relaid as before, but was
in addition set in cement, securely'
j boiled t n 'he next stone, making the
i whole building practically one hollow
lock over the steel foundation skele
ton.
The church was built as a memorial
to Senator Stanford and to fulfill one
object of the endowment grant, which
provided that non-sectarian religious
instruction should be part of the work |
undertaken.
Windows Remarkable
A rather extraordinary feature of!
the church is the harmony of design i
of the windows. This is due to the
fact that they were designed by one
man, Frederick Lamb of New York,
and are not the gifts of different
donors. Each window is located with
special reference to its immediate
surroundings.
The method by which the plans for
the windows were drawn is rather in
teresting. After a full-size drawing
had been made it was pasted to a pane
of plate glass, and the black lines of
the picture cut away, leaving the pic
ture formed of many small pieces of
paper, outlined by clear spaces of
light. The shades of colored glass were
then chosen by comparison with their
power to transmit light. The pieces
of glass were cut to the size of the
paper pattern, and then assembled and
bound together by thin strips of lead.

donors. Each window is located with
special reference to its immediate
surroundings.
The method by which the plans for
the windows were drawn is rather in
teresting. After a full-size drawing
had been made it was pasted to a pane
of plate glass, and the black lines of
the picture cut away, leaving the pic
ture formed of many small pieces of
paper, outlined by clear spaces of
light. The shades of colored glass were
then chosen by comparison with their
power to transmit light. The pieces
of glass were cut to the size of the
paper pattern, and then assembled and
bound together by thin strips of lead.
