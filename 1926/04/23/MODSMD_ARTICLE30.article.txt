# DR. ALSBERG WRITES ON FLOUR SHORTAGE IN JOURNAL ARTICLE
##

"To the average person wheat is |
just wheat and flour is just flour," de-j
clarea Dr. Carl L. Alsberg of the
Stanford University Food Research In- j
stitute in his article on "Our Future I
Flour Supply," which has just been!
reprinted from the Journal of Home
Economics of February, 1926.
"Home economists, however, are>
well aware that this is far from the
truth, that there are hundreds of cul-!
tural varieties of the wheat plant dif- 'â– 
fering from one another as greatly as j
do white, red, and yellow roses, and j
that the same variety of the wheat
plant will produce grain differing very'
considerably in character according to i
the climatic and other cultural condi
tions under which it is grown. For!
practical purposes wheats may be di
vided into two great groups, hard
wheats and soft wheats."
Alsberg states that we are facing a j
serious shortage of hard wheat which
is universally demanded by bakers,
and housewives, while is prac-!
tically no demand for soft wheat, the!
production of which is plentiful. The;
high price of wheat and the raising of
the general cost of living is the result!
of this preference.
"If the consumers could be educated
to keep on hand both types of flour
to be used each for the purposes for
which it is best suited," said Alsberg,
"the demand for the stronger flours i
would be lowered materially and the
price of flour would ultimately be re
stored to a more reasonable level."
The Food Research Institute has re
cently printed another booklet by Als
berg entitled "Combination in the
American Bread-Baking Industry." I
