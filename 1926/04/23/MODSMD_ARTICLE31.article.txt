# Seniors Aid Freshmen To Pick Harvard Courses
## 
### 
Harvard freshmen are being aided
in their choice of a field of concentra
j tion by a series of articles written by
; upperclassmen and published in the
| Harvard Crimson. The articles are
[ written by undergraduates of high
j scholastic standing to outline for the
first-year students the possibilities af-i
forded by some of the larger depart- i
! ments.
The writer discusses his chosen field
in all its various aspects, giving his
personal opinion whether it be favor-!
, able, or not. Departments having the
largest enrollment in previous years
! are those covered by the articles.
