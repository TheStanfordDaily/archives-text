History of Herculano
The Portuguese author's full name
was Alexandre Herculano de Carvallo
e Araujo. He was born in Lisbon on
March 28, 1810, of common people,
learned Latin, English, French, and
German, and studied diplomacy and
paleography in the Torre do Tombo.
During the political troubles of IS3I
he went to France to study, and the
next year he went to the Azores is
lands, where he enlisted in the service
of the Queen of Portugal, from which
he was honorably discharged in 1833.
For three years Herculano acted as
librarian of the Public Library of the
city of Porto. He resigned in 1836, and
the next year became editor of the
Panorama, a literary publication. In
1839 he was appointed the King's
Librarian. In 1840 he was elected
deputy from the city of Porto. Four
years later he was made a member of>
the Royal Academy of Sciences. From
then until 1867 he spent most of his
time in collecting documents on Portu
guese history and using them in vari
ous writings. In that year he retired
to a small farm, where he died Sep
tember 13, 1877.
Published Books
Herculano published several works,
including, besides the present volume, i
a "History of Portugal," which covers j
only the years to 1270, a book of
poems, four volumes of romances, two
collections of short stories, one tome
on civil marriage, and eight volumes
of miscellaneous papers on public, eco
nomic, and educational questions.
In his translation, President Bran
ner was assisted by Professor Edward
M. Hulme of the History department,
who also prepared the work for pub
lication.
Alexandre Ilerculano's "History of
the Origin and Establishment of the
Tpquisition in Portugal," translated
from the Portuguese by John C. Bran
ner, one-time president of the Univer
sity, came off the press Tuesday at
the University Press. The entire edi
tion of 600 copies was sent to the
library at once. Part of the books will
be sent out on exchange to other uni
versities, and part will be kept by the
library. The book has never been pub
lished before.
The original of the book was writ
ten in three volumes in 1852, and each
volume was divided into "Libros" or
"Books." President Branner re-ar
ranged the work into one volume, di
vided into chapters. The numbering
of his footnotes also is different from
that of the original. Whereas Hercu
lano numbered his notes as to pages,
Branner numbered his as to chapters.
The notes are, however, a direct trans
lation from the original.
