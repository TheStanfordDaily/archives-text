# MAJORITY OF STUDENTS DO NOT DRINK—--JORDAN
## 
### 
"The majority of college
do not drink and those that do are
negligible," said Dr. David Starr Jor
dan in his lecture on "The Volstead
Act" last night at his home. He added
that he has been in college since 1868
and consequently knows quite a little
about college.
Dr. Jordan cited the liquor case of
1908, when 132 Stanford students were
sent home in a liquor war. Most of
them came back afte rthey had talked
with their families, having learned
that the University had the right to
dictate the conduct of the student,
even off campus.
Stanford alumni passed a bill
through the state legislature, prohibit
ing saloons near colleges in the state.
This drove the saloon out of Menlo
Park, and it had already been cleaned
out of Mayfield. Palo Alto never of
fered much of a problem, Dr. Jordan
said, as Timothy Hopkins owned near
ly all of the townsite, and each bill
of sale or lease contained a forfeiture
clause.
In regards to the main problem of
prohibition, Dr. Jordan said, "We can
not turn back. We cannot return to
the old system—our autos forbid it.
We cannot do away with saloons —and
yet sell light wines and beer. We
should not permit criminals to drive
us into refuting our word. We must
continue to enforce prohibition.
"Young men should not violate the
Prohibition law they should not vio
late any law of this country. If they
break the laws of nature they will
suffer for it.

"Alcohol is not a stimulant —it is a
poison. The human brain is the finest
mechanism known, and everything
that affects the nerves affects them
in a harmful manner. The justifica
tion of the Eighteenth Amendment
lies in the fact that a person may do
as he wishes as long as he consumes
his own smoke. Liquor was not doing
this, so It had to be changed for the
benefit of all."
There are more deaths from alcohol
in France than in any other country.
Russia comes second. Steady satura
tion is the cause of deaths from liquor.
An habitual drunkard is apt to become
tubercular, or he will contract some
other disease.
The people who voted in the recent
newspaper plebiscite live mostly in
the cities. Those who were interested
in defeating the measure were able to
vote as many times as they desired.
There may be reasons for changing
the Volstead Act, but we cannot tam
per with it much without doing dam
age. The government cannot run the
saloons —there is already too much
corruption rampant.
The only safe way is to get away
from liquor. The only safe way for any
nation is prohibition. "We should at
tack sources of detriment to prohibi
tion, especially those who are responsi
ble for the manufacture and sale of
liquor. The employment of criminal
men and women to buy and sell liquor
should be stopped. It is our duty to
obey the law —but we should be able
to examine into it. If we do this pro
perly we realize that prohibition is
the only solution to the problem."
