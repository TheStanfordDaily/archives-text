Women's class track captains were
elected yesterday at the meeting of
the squads. Ruth Lansburgh was cho
sen to lead the freshmen, Dorothy
Cone the sophomores, while neither
junior nor senior captains have been
determined yet.
Barbare Dewlaney and Lucile Bur
lingame, junior candidates, received
an equal number of votes and will
have to be voted upon next week. The
senior nominee having withdrawn
from the track squad, nominations for
1926 captain will have to be held
again.
Ruth Lansburgh and Dorothy Cone
are both sprinters and should com

freshman captain is also one of the
best broad-jumpers out this season.
