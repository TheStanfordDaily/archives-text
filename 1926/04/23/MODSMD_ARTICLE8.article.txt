# SPECIAL ENDOWMENT COMMITTEE DECIDES ON AETNA CONTRACT
## Members of 1926 Class to Pay $6.50 Annually For 25 Years 
### 
Bids of the Aetna Insurance Com
pany were definitely accepted last
night by the special senior endowment
committee under Hartley Devlin,
chairman.
According to the contracts, each
member of the senior class will pay
$6.50 per year for a policy. In twenty
five years the premiums will mature
and the lump sum will be presented
to the University as a gift from the
Class of 1926. Policies will be collected
directly by the insurance company in
order to avert burdening the class
officials or University comptroller
with excess work.
The committee consisting of Fran
ces Dearborn, John A. Sutro, Lawrence
P. Canfield, Richard T. Harville, and
Hartley W. Devlin investigated many
national insurance companies before
awarding the bid to the Aetna Com
pany.
A class meeting is planned for next
week so that the details of the con
tract can be explained and the mem
bers urged to take out policies as
soon as possible.
