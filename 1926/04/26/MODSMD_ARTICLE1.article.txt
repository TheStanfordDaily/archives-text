## Slugging Characterizes All Events of Fast Boxing Tournament GOLDWATER HEADLINER Miron, Fain, Lloyd, Schall Win Contests by Clean, Consistent Hitting 
### Herb Klein 
Hard and fast slugging character
ized a program of consistently inter
esting fights for the University cham
pionships in Encina Gymnasium last
Friday night. Varsity boxers won
every event in which they participated,
but were given tough scraps in most
cases.
The feature bout of the evening in
point of closeness was the lightweight
contest in which Goldwater took a
hair's breadth decision over Ross in
the extra round which had been called
for by the judges. Both fighters were
going all the time and it was mainly
Goldwater's superior condition, cou
pled with the fact that he kept mov
ing forward all the time, that gave
him the edge. The first round went to
Ross by a fair margin. In the second
the two fighters were on approximate
ly even terms and trading punches
freely. The third round went to Gold
water, the stocky lightweight's airtight
defense and clever feinting enabling
him to get through some telling
punches. The extra round found both
men weary but Ross sufficiently more
so to lose him the fight.
Miron Trims McCall
Miron, clever varsity featherweight,
defeated McCall in three gruelling
rounds. Both fighters started out fast,
but were decidedly weary by the end
of the third. McCall took a count of
five from choice in order to recuperate
slightly in the third round. Miron was
out of condition, which prevented him
from going in his usual flashy manner.
The light-heavyweight bout in which
Fain, varsity man, defeated Dorman
was a hard-hitting battle from start to
finish. Dorman tore in from start to
finish, but Fain was always able to get
his punches across first. Both battlers
exchanged heavy punches but Fain's
landed far more frequently.
Lloyd Wins Bloody Scrap
Lloyd defeated Raaf in a bloody
three-round welterweight fight. Lloyd
was able to get through the other
boxer's defense repeatedly for heavy
blows on the head, which jarred but
did not stop Raaf. After the first round
it was Lloyd's scrap all the way, al
though Raaf kept things interesting,
refusing to be discouraged by the
pounding he was getting.
Schall, captain of the Stanford bat
tlers, had no trouble outboxing An
drews in the middleweight bout. The
big varsity man played around with
his opponent and never even extended
himself.
Dan Flint, former Stanford boxer
and an ex-Pacific Coast lightweight
champion, acted as referee. Harry Ma
loney was on hand and explained the
donation of medals which will be
given winners in each of the fights.
The awards were donated by alumni
who were champions in their respec
tive divisions while in college.

Friday night. Varsity boxers won
every event in which they participated,
but were given tough scraps in most
cases.
The feature bout of the evening in
point of closeness was the lightweight
contest in which Goldwater took a
hair's breadth decision over Ross in
the extra round which had been called
for by the judges. Both fighters were
going all the time and it was mainly
Goldwater's superior condition, cou
pled with the fact that he kept mov
ing forward all the time, that gave
him the edge. The first round went to
Ross by a fair margin. In the second
the two fighters were on approximate
ly even terms and trading punches
freely. The third round went to Gold
water, the stocky lightweight's airtight
defense and clever feinting enabling
him to get through some telling
punches. The extra round found both
men weary but Ross sufficiently more
so to lose him the fight.
Miron Trims McCall
Miron, clever varsity featherweight,
defeated McCall in three gruelling
rounds. Both fighters started out fast,
but were decidedly weary by the end
of the third. McCall took a count of
five from choice in order to recuperate
slightly in the third round. Miron was
out of condition, which prevented him
from going in his usual flashy manner.
The light-heavyweight bout in which
Fain, varsity man, defeated Dorman
was a hard-hitting battle from start to
finish. Dorman tore in from start to
finish, but Fain was always able to get
his punches across first. Both battlers
exchanged heavy punches but Fain's
landed far more frequently.
Lloyd Wins Bloody Scrap
Lloyd defeated Raaf in a bloody
three-round welterweight fight. Lloyd
was able to get through the other
boxer's defense repeatedly for heavy
blows on the head, which jarred but
did not stop Raaf. After the first round
it was Lloyd's scrap all the way, al
though Raaf kept things interesting,
refusing to be discouraged by the
pounding he was getting.
Schall, captain of the Stanford bat
tlers, had no trouble outboxing An
drews in the middleweight bout. The
big varsity man played around with
his opponent and never even extended
himself.
Dan Flint, former Stanford boxer
and an ex-Pacific Coast lightweight
champion, acted as referee. Harry Ma
loney was on hand and explained the
donation of medals which will be
given winners in each of the fights.
The awards were donated by alumni
who were champions in their respec
tive divisions while in college.
