## 
### 
Under the auspices of the Stanford
Glee Club, the Smallman A Capella
I choir will give a recital in the Stan
j ford Assembly hall the evening of
! Monday, May 17. The choir is unique
i in the West as being the only or
ganization of its kind that sings in
; costume. The traditions of A Capella,
: or unaccompanied singing, have been
! preserved intact by John Smallman of
; Los Angeles, the founder and director
i of the group of forty mixed voices.
Ever since the Middle Ages, when
| every cathedral boasted its choir
which sang the most difficult chants
true to pitch without accompaniment,
; A Capella singing has been considered
I the highest form of ensemble art. The
Smallman choir not only sings with-
I out instrumental aids, but also entirely
from memory.
Their repertoire contains classical
i choral compositions by John Sebastian
| Bach, whose works are outstanding,
judged by the standards of any age;
Orlando di Lasso, Belgium's greatest
i contribution to early music; and many
j others. The full possibilities of their
j music can only be appreciated when
i it is produced by a trained and experi
! enced group like the Smallman choir,
' according to critics of singing. Among
j the moderns Enrico Bossi, famous
Italian organist and composer, is rep
; resented prominently on the reper
j toire.
