# ENCINA EMPLOYE SLEEPS THREE DAYS
## 
### 
D. L. Lowe, an employe at the En
cina dining halls, was taken in an
ambulance to a San Jose hospital Sat
urday in a state of unconsciousness
as a result of an overdose of sedative
medicine.
Lowe came from San Francisco re
cently to work at (he dining hall and
was suffering from insomnia. He ob
tained some medicine from a local doc
tor with the direction that he was to
lake one teaspoonful every four hours.
But his desire for sleep apparently
overcame his better judgment when
ihe failed to heed the doctor's direc
tions and took half the bottle instead
i of one teaspoonful of the medicine at
once.
