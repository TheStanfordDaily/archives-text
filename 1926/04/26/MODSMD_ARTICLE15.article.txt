# DISTANCE RUNS NOT BAD FOR TRACKMEN DECLARES BARROW
## Athletic Director Advises Care in Examining Participants 
### 
Discontinuance of the two-mile run
from the program of events of college
track and field meets is not advocated
by Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of the
Stanford physical education depart
ment, who, however, stipulates that ex
treme care should be taken in examin
ing participants as to their physical ca
pacity and condition.
Dr. Barrow, in voicing his opinion
on the advisability of continuing to run
the two-mile event which has recently
been objected to on the grounds that
the event is dangerous to the partici
pants, has given his opinion following
a personal investigation and considera
tion of the subject. Conclusions
reached by the Stanford director are as
follows :
No Evidence Available
No medical evidence is available to
prove that participation in athletics of
any sort has caused any permanent
physical injury to men who were in
good physical condition when they were
competing. Crew work, calling for the
severest sustained effort, does not
cause heart trouble either immeditaely
after or several years after participa
tion.
Coaches and athletic directors in var
ious parts of the country who have been
in contact with distance runners over
a long period of years report they do
not know of any case of breakdown
which could be 'attributed to track par
ticipation.
The event is usually not a very inter
esting one to the spectators but in spite
of that fact Eastern officials are consid
ering a five-mile event in order to
stimulate interest in distance running.
Mateurity Essential
These facts, according to Dr. Barrow,
give no logical basis whereby the two
mile event may be dropped. However,
in spite of the lack of scientific evi
dence that distance running is harmful,
the Stanford director does not believe
the event a suitable one for men who
have not reached maturity or who are
! not in fit physical condition, although
; it is almost impossible to tell by ordi-
I nary physical examination whether a
j man is fit.
Stanford's opinion regarding the ad
ivisability of including the two-mile run
i on the track meet programs is limited,
[according to Dr. W. H. Barrow, di-
I rector of the physical education depart
! ment, to taking extreme care in the ex
! animation of men or boys who arc en
! tered in such events.
