## Phi Delta Theta, Breakers Take Scheduled Games By Default S.A.E. DEFEATS PHI SIGS Wild Pitching in Phi Kappa Sigma-Sequoia I Tilt Causes Walks 
### 
Alpha Kappa Lambda gained ail
early lead over Encina V in a well
played intramural baseball game Fri
day afternoon and won the contest
3-1. Miller and Verplank accounted for
two A.K.L. runs in the first inning,
after hitting safely and scoring on Mc-
Dougall's line drive.
After the first, the game settled
into a pitchers' duel between Barnett,
Alpha Kappa Lambda, and Rlainwar
ing, Encina. Both twirlers retired the
opposition in one-two-three order until
Encina came to bat in the last of the
fourth. Gibson and Mainwaring both
hit, but there was no one to bat them
in and they died on base.
Cornell brought in a run for the
A.K.L. nine in the sixth, hitting and
scoring on an infield error. Barnett was
then relieved by Cornell, who nearly
got into trouble in the first of the sev
enth. Encina went to bat with a 3-0
lead against it. Davis flied out, Cohen
walked, advancing to third on errors.
Rees hit weakly but reached first, and
Cohen went home on another A.K.L.
bungle. Holt walked, and with two
men on, Holmes hit a long fly, but
Miller, right field, made a pretty catch,
ending the rally and the game.
Phi Kaps Win
. The Phi Kappa Sigma-Sequoia I tilt
proved to be the humor spot of the
day when a series of wild pitches by
the Sequoia players kept the opposi
tion on the qui vive to avoid bruises.
A large number of walks resulted from
this, which led to an 8-3 victory for
the Phi Kaps.
Evan and Wright held down the
mound for the winning squad while
Meakin finished out the battery at
catch. Batting was poor on both sides.
S.A.E., playing a postponed game
with Phi Sigma Kappa, walked away
to a 14-3 victory in the space of five
innings. The game started off with
practically shutout pitching by Laßue
of the S.A.E. squad. This streak con
tinued into the third and was broken
by Laßue blowing up. Despite this ad
vantage, the Phi Sigs were only able
to get away with one good hit during
the entire game. Laßue and Shumaker
appeared strong in the batting which
brought in the big score.
