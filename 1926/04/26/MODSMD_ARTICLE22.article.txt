# Clothes-Racks

Recently the Merchant Tailors and Designers' Association of America
met in Chicago, and in convention assembled determined that: "Fashion
decrees the athletic looking man for the spring and summer of 1926. The
coat worn by the correctly dressed man will be shaped to his back, the
shoulders will be broader, the waist more trim, and his trousers will fit
more snugly. Oxford bags are taboo. The outdoor man will wear a
coat with a belt instead of the plain sack formerly worn with knickers."
The obvious question is"Is Zat So?" If it is, some of us who are not
millionaires, or sons of tailors, may be distinct objects of curiosity in col
legiate circles within several months.
The unfortunate aspect of the problem is, that it is quite likely to be
the case. There are in our community, and in every college community,
certain pace-setters, who, it seems, have never heard the old saying, "It is
not the coat that makes the man." These morons spend four hours of their
working day in keeping up with the tailor's line of chatter about the neces
sary accoutrements of a gentleman.
This is not intended as a panning of the local haberdashers. In fact
we believe that the local merchants are with us, and want to give us a
chance to wear out our two-months-old habiliments before these "athletic
models" make their debut. â€”Cornell Daily Sun.
