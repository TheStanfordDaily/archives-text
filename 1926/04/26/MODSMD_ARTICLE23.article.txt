# TRACK SPORTS DATE TO EARLY GRECIAN, EGYPTIAN HISTORY
## Olympic Games, Beginning In 776 8.C., Develop Into Six-Day Contests 
### Gordon French 
Track and field athletics in various
forms and combinations probably con
stitutes the most ancient of sports. In
one form or another traces of it can
be found past the time of organized
history into the realm of legend.
The Greeks are universally recog
nized as the first great athletic nation
though it is thought that their ath
letics can be traced back to the Egyp
tians and other Asiatic nations. How
ever, there is little doubt that they
were the first to systematize athletics
and to produce highly developed ath
letes.
First Olympics
The first record of the organized
Olympic games comes in 776 B.C. and
after that time the contests were held
annually in the autumn season of the
year. They gradually developed from
one-day affairs into elaborate six-day
contests. At first the higher and lei
sured classes furnished the contest
ants and they fought only for glory,
but around the year 500 B.C. a class
of professional athletes grew up which
gradually lowered the quality of the
competitors until the foremost think
ers of the day began to look on the
games dubiously. In Rome this develop
ment caused similar professional con
* tests to be substituted far the gladi
ator fights. All the athletes who com
peted in Rome were professional
Greek athletes because the Romans
looked down upon these competitors.
They were finally abolished in the
fourth century as a hindrance to Chris
tianity.
Athletes Diet
The original events for the Olympic
games were javelin and discus throw
ing, short and long races, boxing, and
wrestling. At one time the diet for
the athletes was fresh cheese, dried
figs, and wheaton bread, with meat,
either beef or pork, once a day. Ex
cept in wine the quantity was un
limited. The competitors in the early
games wore loin clothes but later they
appeared naked with their bodies
oiled.
Traces of similar athletics are found

|in old Celtic, Scottish, and English
records. For instance Henry Vlll'is
reputed to have excelled in throwing
i the hammer and "casting the barre."
iln the 16th century the great annual
! football match was replaced by a
; series of foot races.
The modern development in Eng
! land started early in the 19th century
| when many British academies began
! having track and field days. The Ox
i ford-Cambridge series started in 1864
| and still continues. In 1880 the Ama
teur Athletic Assocfation was organ
ized and at the present time it con
! trols the British track and field ath
letics.
Interest Revives
A great revival of interest in track
and field sports occurred in America
in 1870. The first intercollegiate meet
ing was held at Saratoga in 1873 and
only three colleges entered, but in the
; following year eight entered, and in
1875 thirteen teams competed. The
; Intercollegiate Association of Amateur
! Athletics of America was formed in
1 1876, while the Amateur Athletic
j Union was started in 1880 and now
is the controlling body.
The first California-Stanford track |
! and field day came in 1892 when Cali-1
fornia was easily victorious. One event]
was a two-mile bicycle race, while
I there were two walking races on the j
program. Since that time California;
and Stanford have engaged in thirty-,
three meets, fifteen of which have been!
won by Stanford, with two tied. Dur
ing this time track and field compe
tition has become second only to foot
ball in importance.
Olympics Revived
Under the leadership of Baron
Pierre de Coubertin, the old-time
Olympic games were revived in 1896.
The first series of contests was held I
in Athens in a new stadium built on '
the ruins of the ancient one. Of the
fourteen events in the track and field
competition nine were won by the
United States while Great Britain won
three and Denmark and Greece each
won one event. A Greek had the honor
of winning the feature event, the
twenty-six-mile Marathon run. Since
that time the United States has won
the track and field competition in
every one of the Olympic games by
varying margins. In recent years the
little country of Finland has become
! America's greatest rival.
