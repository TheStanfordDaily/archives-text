## MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE 
### Monroe Eaton 
The fast that the Peninsula Railway Company (alias the Toonerville
trolley) has found it necessary to burn the weeds oft' the track with a traveling
fire machine reminds us of a funny story we heard once.
It seems that there were two irishmen, Pat and Mike, who were planning
a trip to the local campus. Well, to make a short story long, Mike took the ;
trolley (if we may say so) and Pat walked.
BUT NOW WE COME TO THE CLIMAX. YOU THOUGHT PAT, WHO
WALKED, WOULD GET THERE FIRST. NO SIR, NOT A BIT OF IT. j
THIS WAS IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN THEY HAD HORSE-DRAWN
STRRETCARS. »
As a result the grass that grew up between trips didn't interfere with
the progress of the car a bit because the horses ate it as fast as they went |
along; so Mike got there first. <
* * *
The only way that we can account for the indifference students show
in regard to the garage questionnaire published in the Daily last week is i
that mbst of them own automobiles valued at less than $7.50'.
* * *
Cabbages wishes to announced that, contrary to rumors circulating about
the campus, classes will not be excused on Wednesday in order that students
may attend the circus in Palo Alto.
