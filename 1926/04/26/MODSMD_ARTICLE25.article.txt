(Headline in the Daily Trojan)
Cabbages would remind our worthy contemporaries that hazing was
abolished on the Stanford campus way back in 1923.
BUT IN SPITE OF THIS FACT WE THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE
SHOULD CONSIDER ITSELF SEVERELY SLAPPED ON ITS RESPECTIVE
WRISTS.
And perhaps, after all, it is a good thing that hazing was abolished when
it was. Nothing could be more disconcerting that to see the members of our
august body under the methods of discipline used now only by some fraterni
ties.
But we would advise the chief student governing body to be more careful
in the future what it passes because we fear that chastisement of the com
mittee in the way suggested by the headline might lead to a serious loss of
confidence in the Golden Rule:
Spare the rod
And spoil the child.
