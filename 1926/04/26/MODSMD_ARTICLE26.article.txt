# JUSTICE IS DONE

The judge was quite a pleasant man, with kindly smile of happy cheer,
Which he could vary to a chill of ice when cases he must hear.
The jury—twelve of Pineville's best intelligence was in the box—■
The trial was certain to be just—the lawyers, each a sly old fox.
The case —Beth Sweetie vs. State, was one which had the town agog;
The murder of a nagging wife, with circumstances in a fog!
The lady who had shot the gun which K.O.'ed Mrs. Bolden Brave,
Was led up to the witness stand, and this the story that she gave . . .
"I was a sweet and simple girl, untouched by fires of love or hate,
When I was hired as governess to keep the tots inside the gate.
"The woman, neither young nor fair, had made her husband, Bolden Brave,
Lose his affection, and he wished that she'd divorce, or find her grave.
"And then I came into his life as governess of his sweet tots,
He thrilled me—mad, or, mad I was, for soon I came to love him —lots.
"He called me his sweet sugar plum and once—he kissed me in the hall —
All, 1 shall keep that in my heart —but to my tale; that isn't all."
The jury sat with bated breath, and hung on Sweetie's every word,
She was a lulu, and the twelve were anxious that her cause be heard.
"Where was 1? Yes, he'd kissed me —well, our love broke forth just like a rash,
And madly I adored the man . . . What? No!! I didn't think of cash!!!!
"Of course, I knew he had a million working in the downtown banks;
But love is what I felt —why, sure, he bifflnght me things, and got my thanks!
"And then, because he was so sad, I took the gun and shot his wife,
Because I knew he loved but me, and I just couldn't spoil his life!"
The testimony having ceased, the jury arose to leave the room,
For their deliberation in this case of love, and death, and gloom.
They sat and talked and then the tears flowed free —why she had done it right;
No reason for convicting her; the dear had made a noble fight!
When they returned in half a shake, "Not guilty" was their smiling finding.
The judge, with tears upon his cheeks, rose up and said, "Decision binding!"
He blessed the day that love had won, and spoke with heat and terms of scorn,
Of nagging wives—why, right was right, as sure as you were ever born.
And then he gave her damages of fifty thousand iron plunks,
And said she'd done her duty well —may love be hers in gobs and chunks.
—L.A.B.
