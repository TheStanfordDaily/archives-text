"If it just doesn't rain everything
will be all right," says Joseph Thorn
ton, labor foreman for the University,

cessful hay crop this year.
Men were busy throughout last week

chines are expected within two weeks

for sale, all according to the prevailing
market prices of the commodity. Rain
ruined last year's crop to the extent
of $600.
