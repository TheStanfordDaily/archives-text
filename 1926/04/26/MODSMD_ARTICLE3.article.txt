# FRESHMEN ADOPT BUGGY RIDING AS LATEST DIVERSION
## 
### 
The gav 'nineties, when a horse
was occasionally seen outside of
a livery stable, were recalled Fri
day evening when two freshmen
approach Roble, drawn by one
of the equine prides of Mayfield,
and called for their ladies. The
couples received a rousing send
off, which nearly caused a run
away, but the creature proved
docile when the cheers died away.
The particular advantages of
horse transportation over that by
automobile were not stated by
the drivers, but it is considered
by those familiar with the sub
ject that buggy riding has a
peacefulness all its own. Need
less to add, there were expres
sions of "thanks for the buggy
ride."
