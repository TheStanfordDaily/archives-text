# ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ADVOCATES PLAN FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY
## 
### 
President Mary E. Woolley of Mt.
Holyoke College, speaker at the Uni
versity Assembly, Wednesday, at 11
o'clock, is one of the leading advo
cates of such plans as Stanford's "in
dependent study plan," by which uni
versities are trying to get away from
mass education and pay more atten
tion to the needs and desires of indi
vidtual students. In recent talks given
in California she has stressed this
point, and her address Wednesday will
give Stanford students and faculty
some sidelights on Stanford's methods
as seen by an Eastern educator who
is familiar with all the colleges of the
j country and has herself been a col
lege president for more than a quarter
' of a century.
] President Woolley has lifted Mt. j
! Holyoke from the status of a seminary 1
j to the rank of one of the leading col-;
! leges of the country during her presi- j
dency. In the East she is regarded not I
as a woman president of a women's j
college, but as a leader in college ad
i ministration.
Her subject for Wednesday is "Edu-;
cation as an Adventure," which is an
indication that she will stress the idea
which is interesting a good many col
lege students, that the value of a col- j
lege education lies not in "courses"
and "grades" as dispensed by the fac-!
ulty, but the gaining of knowledge by \
each student and in his own way.

UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, Reno, j
—P.l.P.) —The senior memorial this
year will consist of a walk from the
Lake street entrance to the university
grounds to the steps of Morrill hall.
It will be in keeping with the new
building program now being inaugu
rated on this campus.

Work on the new Stagg Field sta
dium has been started at the Univer
sity of Chicago. Seats for 50,000 will
be completed by next fall, and the
total seating capacity when the stands
are finished will be over 70,000.
