## DUCO NOW BECOMING STANDARD FINISH FOR CARS OF ALL MARES More Than Forty Per Cent Of Manufacturers Use New Type of Paint

Perhaps those Stanford students who
come from east of the Rocky Moun
tains can remember how the family
car was stored for the winter because
of the snow and cold. When the roads
again became passable in the early
spring, the auto was taken from its
resting place and put in condition for
the summer months. Here in Cali
fornia, the motorists' paradise, this is
never done for automobiling is a favor
ite year-around pastime. But one thing
is done both in the East and the West
in the spring; the car must be made
beautiful for the summer months of
touring.
A few years ago the auto would have
been sent down to the paint shop to be
laid up for three or four weeks while it
was being painted. The machine would
look nice for most of the summer, but
the greatest disadvantage of a paint job
is the fact that it does not stand up
well under the rigors of the weather.
To meet the demands of the motoring
public for an automobile finish that
would stand up under all conditions
Duco was perfected by the E. I. Du
Pont de Nemours and Company. The
idea for this finish came in 1914, but
it was not put on the market until 1924.
Then the Oakland adopted it as a
standard finish for all models. In an
other year many of the leading auto
manufacturers had also selected Duco
as a finish for their product. In 1925
more than forty per cent of the manu
facturers who had a display at the New
York Automobile Show presented cars
with this finish.
