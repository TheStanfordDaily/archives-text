# MOTOR TRUCK DISPLACES RICKSHAW IN CHINA USED FOR BUILDING ROADS, TRANSPORTING TROOPS COOLIES UNLOAD CARS FROM JUNKS WITH EASE
## 
### 
The rickshaw, that frail two-wheeled
; vehicle operated by man power, which
J has been the Chinese method of local
! transportation, for centuries, is passing
before the most modern type of motor
I car and truck.
The roads of China have little to
j commend them for use of rubber tired
j conveyances, but many of the native
I population, as well as foreign residents,
; prefer this newer method of transporta
tion. It enables them to eliminate time
in a country where Time is reckoned by
dynasties or centuries.
Even in the newer military regime of
China, which is now battling against
I the incursion of Soviet doctrine, the
| motor truck has become an important
! link in the operations.
The big factor in bringing about this
! condition is the use of Dodge Brothers
! Trucks, which are now in general use
J in the provinces of Hankow and Honan.
Recently a shipment of thirty Dodge
| Brothers chassis was made to General
| Wu Pei Fu, commanding the Chinese
| army at Tientsin, in the Province of
j Chi Li. General Wu is using this fleet
j for transporting troops and for road
j building.
Two other large shipments of these
1 units were received by the L. E. Gale
j Company, Dodge Brothers Dealers at
Hankow. These shipments were dis
bursed to other points in the provinces
of Hankow and Honan for road build
ing and for transportation needs.
The consignment comprised two train
loads, one load containing 55 Graham
! Brothers Trucks destined for Kaifeng,
Honan. The other train load, consist
ing mainly of Dodge Brothers chassis,
was for distribution from the L. E.
Gale Company's headquarters at Han
| kow.
The huge shipment was made across
j the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai. Here

the heavy export boxes were transferred
to lighters for the trip up the Yangtze
River a distance of 600 or 700 miles in
land. The lighters used were "Junks,"
small frail sail boats of native design,
capable of holding three or four of
these huge boxes. Four days is re
quired to make the inland journey.
On arrival at Hankow more difficul
ties were experienced. Lack of modern
equipment for unloading such bulky
freight was confronted. But there were
coolies, myriads of them, ready on the
bank eager to assist in the work.
The boxes were removed from the
deck of the Junk by use of a long steel
cable and a windlass. Back from the
river bank is a long, broad concrete
wall for Hood protection. This wall is
about twelve feet high. Another task
confronted Mr. Gale and his associates
in getting the heavy boxes up to dry
ground. The boxes were rolled to a
pair of skids which had been placed on
the steps of a driveway leading to the
top of the wall. A "yoke" made of
bamboo was stretched around the box
to be raised. To this "yoke" are at
tached a number of circular slings made
of leather or some heavy cloth. These
slings are thrown over the right
shoulder of each man at work and by
continual forcing they manage to take
the heavy freight up the required dis
tance. Usually about thirty coolies are
employed at this task.
The coolies go about their work with
a manner which belies their stoical na
ture. A leader is chosen and he directs
the work. As the men take hold of
their box the leader begins a "song"
which is similar to the "heave-ho;
heave-ho" chant of the American track
layers.
The boxes are carried by this manual
labor to the waiting freight cars some
distance down the wall of the river
bank.

the steps of a driveway leading to the
top of the wall. A "yoke" made of
bamboo was stretched around the box
to be raised. To this "yoke" are at
tached a number of circular slings made
of leather or some heavy cloth. These
slings are thrown over the right
shoulder of each man at work and by
continual forcing they manage to take
the heavy freight up the required dis
tance. Usually about thirty coolies are
employed at this task.
The coolies go about their work with
a manner which belies their stoical na
ture. A leader is chosen and he directs
the work. As the men take hold of
their box the leader begins a "song"
which is similar to the "heave-ho;
heave-ho" chant of the American track
layers.
The boxes are carried by this manual
labor to the waiting freight cars some
distance down the wall of the river
bank.
The rickshaw, that frail two-wheeled
; vehicle operated by man power, which
J has been the Chinese method of local
! transportation, for centuries, is passing
before the most modern type of motor
I car and truck.
The roads of China have little to
j commend them for use of rubber tired
j conveyances, but many of the native
I population, as well as foreign residents,
; prefer this newer method of transporta
tion. It enables them to eliminate time
in a country where Time is reckoned by
dynasties or centuries.
Even in the newer military regime of
China, which is now battling against
I the incursion of Soviet doctrine, the
| motor truck has become an important
! link in the operations.
The big factor in bringing about this
! condition is the use of Dodge Brothers
! Trucks, which are now in general use
J in the provinces of Hankow and Honan.
Recently a shipment of thirty Dodge
| Brothers chassis was made to General
| Wu Pei Fu, commanding the Chinese
| army at Tientsin, in the Province of
j Chi Li. General Wu is using this fleet
j for transporting troops and for road
j building.
Two other large shipments of these
1 units were received by the L. E. Gale
j Company, Dodge Brothers Dealers at
Hankow. These shipments were dis
bursed to other points in the provinces
of Hankow and Honan for road build
ing and for transportation needs.
The consignment comprised two train
loads, one load containing 55 Graham
! Brothers Trucks destined for Kaifeng,
Honan. The other train load, consist
ing mainly of Dodge Brothers chassis,
was for distribution from the L. E.
Gale Company's headquarters at Han
| kow.
The huge shipment was made across
j the Pacific Ocean to Shanghai. Here

the heavy export boxes were transferred
to lighters for the trip up the Yangtze
River a distance of 600 or 700 miles in
land. The lighters used were "Junks,"
small frail sail boats of native design,
capable of holding three or four of
these huge boxes. Four days is re
quired to make the inland journey.
On arrival at Hankow more difficul
ties were experienced. Lack of modern
equipment for unloading such bulky
freight was confronted. But there were
coolies, myriads of them, ready on the
bank eager to assist in the work.
The boxes were removed from the
deck of the Junk by use of a long steel
cable and a windlass. Back from the
river bank is a long, broad concrete
wall for Hood protection. This wall is
about twelve feet high. Another task
confronted Mr. Gale and his associates
in getting the heavy boxes up to dry
ground. The boxes were rolled to a
pair of skids which had been placed on
the steps of a driveway leading to the
top of the wall. A "yoke" made of
bamboo was stretched around the box
to be raised. To this "yoke" are at
tached a number of circular slings made
