# Chicago Council Requires Tail Lights for Horses
## 
### 
A spccial committee of the city coun
cil in Chicago recommended for pas
sage the ordinance requiring all eques-
I trians in the city to carry red tail lights
|on their horses. The measure requires
j that the animals hear a red light visible
I from the rear for a reasonable distance
i when out after dark.

The average motor car, it is esti
j matd, consumes 300 gallons of gasoline
I a year. At 21 cents a gallon, this
would be only $63, while lubricating
oils, it is estimated, cost only $11 more.
