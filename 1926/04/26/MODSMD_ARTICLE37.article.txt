# LOCKHEED HYDRAULIC BRAKE SHOWS VALUE AS SAFETY DEVICE
## 
### 
One of the greatest advances in the
line of safety devices for automobiles
in recent years has been the develop
ment of new types of brakes. Many
accidents have been caused by defective
mechanisms that failed to stop the ma
chine when it was absolutely necessary
that its forward progress be impeded.
Most of this trouble came when two
wheel brakes were standard equipment
on all cars, and before four-wheel and
hydraulic types of brakes had been de
veloped.
The Lockheed Hydraulic brake is
one of the safety devices that has
proven its worth in many cases. It is
nearly as perfectly safe as it is possible
for a man-made mechanism to be.
Lockheeds are now used on more than
a score of different makes of autos.
The Wagner Electric Company of St.
Louis, Missouri, as manufacturers of
the Lockheed brake has just appointed
G. Y. McClatchie as their official rep
resentative for this district. McClatchie
distributes the Peerless and the Olds
mobile in Palo Alto, Redwood City,
Menlo Park, and Mayfield.
