# "STANFORD FOREVER" FEATURE NUMBER OF CARD BAND RECORD
## 
### 
Following a week-end performance
in the Oakland Victor studio, the
Stanford Rand has received word that
its record, "Stanford Forever," with a
medley number on the reverse side, is
"entirely a success." Fifty members
of the band played almost continuously
for three hours yesterday morning in
making the record, which is one of a
series of university band recordings
being made by the Victory company.
"Stanford Forever," the new sta
dium march and one of the outstand
ing Cardinal songs, was recorded on
one side of the disc, while a medley
composed of some of the best-loved
Stanford melodies was made for the
reverse surface. Three trial records
were made of each selection. Tests of
each record were played immediately
after recording, thus correcting flaws
in the recording process.
