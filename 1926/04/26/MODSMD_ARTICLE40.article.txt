# COURSE FOR GOLFERS OPENED TO STUDENTS AT STATE COLLEGE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE,
Pullman —(P.I.P.) —A nine-hole golf
course, built and financed by the asso
ciated students of the State College,
was formally opened Saturday. Earl
Foster, graduate manager, was in
charge of the work.
The course is constructed along the
two sides of Maple Drive, just off the
edge of the campus, on land pur
chased by the student body two years
ago. Since that time the fairways
have been under construction and at
present they are in good shape.
The greens are of the sand type and
are now being oiled and rolled to get
them in the best possible condition
for the opening date.
The new course offers a varied as
sortment of holes. Some of them are
long, others short iron shots, while
three of them are pitch shots to greens
cut from the hillside. Par will be
either 33 or 34.
Student tickets will admit to the
course but just how the townspeople
and the faculty will be handled has
not yet been decided. Possibly a sea
son ticket will be issued the proceeds
from which will be used to keep a
man on the course at all times. Work
on the greens is being rushed to have
everything in readiness for the fornial
opening.
