## Ty Cobb 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Ty Cobb. Will the world ever see his equal? For twenty-one years now
he has led Father Time a merry chase, and has been giving that worthy
gentleman, as well as the baseball prophets, the merry "Ha Ha" ever since
1914, when the first "Ty Cobb is slipping" stories started to circulate. Cobb
may not be the greatest manager in baseball, but he is its greatest player, and
there never was a greater one before him.
"Cap Anson," you say? Cap batted .303 in his twenty-second season. I'll
bet a suit of clothes that Ty beats Anson's mark in this, his twenty-second
year. Hans Wagner? Cobb has passed every one of Wagner's marks but two,
and when he has played in 61 games, and been at bat 75 times, he will hold
those two records, that of playing in the most games and the most times at
bat. If you'll pardon the old reference, Ty has literally shingled for himself
a permanent home in the Hall of Fame with records that he has made. And
every time he plays he sets a new mark for future generations to shoot at.
One of the biggest "kicks" I got out of any sporting event in 1925 was in
seeing Cobb come to bat with the bases full at the Yankee Stadium last sum
mer and laughingly poke a home run into the bleachers. The Ty-gers scored
thirteen runs that inning, and no one enjoyed the party more than the
venerable Tyrus—"the boy who won't grow old."
Since Cobb assumed the managerial duties at Detroit in December, 1920,
the team has finished in sixth, third, second, third, and fourth positions. This
year, if reports of a great change in Ty's methods in handling his men are
correct, this trend towards the cellar should cease, and the new policy, com
bined with heavy hitting and good pitching, should bring the Ty-gers a, better
place in the final standing.
