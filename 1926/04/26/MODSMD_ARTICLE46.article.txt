# EXCITED DANCERS SEE WEEDS BURNED OFF RIGHT-OF-WAY
## 
### 
Students who attended the En
cina Club dance Friday night had
the opportunity of watching the
efforts of the Peninsula Railway
Company to burn the weeds off
its right-of-way.
Burners were attached to the
rear of a work car which played
flames on the tracks below. The
danger of starting a grass fire,
however, was slight, as the vege
tation was consumed by the
burners rather than set on fire
and allowed to burn of itself.
Also, the burner was followed
by a tank car which was ready
to put out all fires that might
have started.
Burning the weeds off the track
is a necessity as the presence of
vegetation 011 the right-of-way
rots thf ties and makes their
frequent replacement necessary.
