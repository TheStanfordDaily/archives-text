# Thursday's Organ Recital Features Widor's "Adagio"
## 
### 
Thursday afternoon's organ recital
promises to be an interesting one with
Vidor's "Adagio from the Fifth Sym
phony" on the program. Many of his
criticisms written under a nom de
plume have been preserved, and are
of much constructive interest.
Bonnet's "Chant du Printemps" is
also on the program. "Within a Chi
nese Garden," by Stoughton, will be
given, and "Elegiac Romance," a com
position of Moreton, an English or
ganist, promises something really new
in the field of organ music. The pro
gram closes with the vigorous "Finale
in D Major" by the noted Philadelphia
I organist, Edward Shippen Barnes.
