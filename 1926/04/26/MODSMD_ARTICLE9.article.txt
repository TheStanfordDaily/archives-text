# Must Obtain 1300 Pledges To Have Artists Appear
## 
### 
Thirteen hundred pledges by Stan
ford students will be required in order
to insure the appearance on the cam
pus next year of some of the world's
greatest musicians, according to the
Executive Committee's new plan. The
pledges will be circulated early this
week and everyone will be given an
opportunity to signify whether or not
he desires to attend the concerts.
The entire series of six concerts,
distributed throughout the three quar
ters of next year, will be offered to
the student body for the price of $3
a ticket. By making use of the season
ticket plan, it has been possible to
arrange for the presentation at an
average rate of 50 cents a concert, by
artists whose contracts specify that
tickets for their individual recitals
may not be sold for less than two or
three dollars.
Make Contracts Now
If the quota of pledges is reached
this week, contracts will be immedi
ately signed which will bring to the
basketball pavilion the following not
able artists: Louis Graveure, Belgian
baritone; Mischa Elman, violinist, and
his string quartette; the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra under the
leadership of Dr. Alfred Hertz; Tito
Schipa, Metropolitan Opera tenor; and
Rosa Ponselle, one of the most popu
lar operatic sopranos on the concert
stage. A sixth concert will be selected
and announced shortly.
The executive committee representa
tives have reserved these artists for
definite dates and will clinch the con
tracts if the response from the student
body is sufficient to guarantee the suc
cess of the venture.
Cards This Week
Cards have been prepared which
will be distributed to the various liv
ing groups during the early part of
the week with the request that all
those sign who intend to take season
tickets next year. Promotion of the
concerts will be entirely in the hands
of students and will enable the reten
tion of the annual appearance of San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
