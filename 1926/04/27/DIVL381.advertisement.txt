STOP STUMBLING THROUGH LIFE!
We live in a "Stumbling Age." Some folks "stumble" out of vanity.
They still cling to the idea that "glasses spoil good looks." With
other# it's just a matter of carelessness and neglect. You'll never
know how much you're missing 'til you stop "stumbling" through life
with half-vision.
