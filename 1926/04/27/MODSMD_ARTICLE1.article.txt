# SEVENTY CARD MEN TO ENTER P. A. A. EVENTS
## Stanford Mile Relay, Team Set for Attempt at World Record TEMPLETON AFTER TITLE Entire Varsity, Babe Squads Will Compete May 8 In San Francisco 
### 
Over seventy track athletes will
represent Stanford at the annual Pa
cific Athletic Association's track and
field meet to be held in Kezar Stadium
at San Francisco on Saturday, May 8.
Coach Dink Templeton has entered
his entire freshman and varsity squads
with the intention of taking this year's
P.A.A. track championship.
One of the outstanding attractions
of the meet will be the attempt by the
Stanford relay team to break the
•world's mile relay record. The Cardinal
quartet smashed the Pacific Coast in
tercollegiate record in the meet with
U.S.C. and two weeks later in the
Stanford-California meet they broke
the record again. The time made by
Templeton's one-lap artists in the Big
Meet, 3.19, is just three seconds slower
than the world's record, held by the
University of lowa.
To Attack Record
The Stanford team, composed of
Babcock, Storie, Richardson, and Mil
ler, is undoubtedly one of the fastest,
if not the fastest, mile relay combina
tion in the United States. Miller led
the last California man by sixty yards
in the final lap of the relay in the Big
Meet, after his three teammates had
added yards to the Stanford lead at
each lap. Even with little competition
in the Big Meet the Cardinal runners
managed to turn in a record of 3.19,
and this shows that they can come
mighty close to the world's mark if
they are given the competition.
Stanford's varsity team appears to
be strong in all the events except the
pole vault and two-mile. Miller, Storie,
and Babcock are an almost unbeatable
trio in the 440, while Bill Richardson
is easily the favorite to cop the honors
in the 880. Bill Kerr is the best bet
for the Cardinals in the mile.
Freshmen Figure
West and Spencer are certain to
make a good showing in the hurdles,
with Don Nelson, freshman star, also
figuring in the places. Stanford is not
especially strong in the sprints, but
Caspar, Coverly, or Hvland may break
in for points. Syer, 1929 sprint ace, will
be among the leaders in both the cen
tury and 220.
Stanford's one-two-three place men
in the javelin throw, Harlow, Joaquin,
and Shipkey, are among the best spear
