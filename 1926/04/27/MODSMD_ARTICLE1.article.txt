# SEVENTY CARD MEN TO ENTER P. A. A. EVENTS
## Stanford Mile Relay, Team Set for Attempt at World Record TEMPLETON AFTER TITLE Entire Varsity, Babe Squads Will Compete May 8 In San Francisco 
### 
Over seventy track athletes will
represent Stanford at the annual Pa
cific Athletic Association's track and
field meet to be held in Kezar Stadium
at San Francisco on Saturday, May 8.
Coach Dink Templeton has entered
his entire freshman and varsity squads
with the intention of taking this year's
P.A.A. track championship.
One of the outstanding attractions
of the meet will be the attempt by the
Stanford relay team to break the
•world's mile relay record. The Cardinal
quartet smashed the Pacific Coast in
tercollegiate record in the meet with
U.S.C. and two weeks later in the
Stanford-California meet they broke
the record again. The time made by
Templeton's one-lap artists in the Big
Meet, 3.19, is just three seconds slower
than the world's record, held by the
University of lowa.
To Attack Record
The Stanford team, composed of
Babcock, Storie, Richardson, and Mil
ler, is undoubtedly one of the fastest,
if not the fastest, mile relay combina
tion in the United States. Miller led
the last California man by sixty yards
in the final lap of the relay in the Big
Meet, after his three teammates had
added yards to the Stanford lead at
each lap. Even with little competition
in the Big Meet the Cardinal runners
managed to turn in a record of 3.19,
and this shows that they can come
mighty close to the world's mark if
they are given the competition.
Stanford's varsity team appears to
be strong in all the events except the
pole vault and two-mile. Miller, Storie,
and Babcock are an almost unbeatable
trio in the 440, while Bill Richardson
is easily the favorite to cop the honors
in the 880. Bill Kerr is the best bet
for the Cardinals in the mile.
Freshmen Figure
West and Spencer are certain to
make a good showing in the hurdles,
with Don Nelson, freshman star, also
figuring in the places. Stanford is not
especially strong in the sprints, but
Caspar, Coverly, or Hvland may break
in for points. Syer, 1929 sprint ace, will
be among the leaders in both the cen
tury and 220.
Stanford's one-two-three place men
in the javelin throw, Harlow, Joaquin,
and Shipkey, are among the best spear
tossers on the coast, and should en
counter little trouble placing in the
P.A.A. meet. Bill Sparling, freshman
javelin thrower, is real varsity caliber
at the present time, and will give his
older opponents a great battle.
Work and King will offer plenty of
opposition to coast high jumpers, as
each is capable of 6 feet 4 inches or
better. Dick Macßae and Sid Meeks
are the class of the coast in the broad
jump.
Fred Zombro and John Lauritzen,
of the 1929 squad, should make the
varsity broad jumpers extend them
selves for the honors. Both men are
capable of better than 22 feet, and as ;
both are good competitive athletes,
they should figure in the places.
Hulsman Formidable
Hulsman, freshman pole vaulter, has
cleared the bar at 12 feet G inches!
repeatedly, and is able to do even
better under pressure. Chet Ross com
pletely surprised Stanford enthusiasts '
in the Big Meet by going 12 feet 7 j
inches, so he must be conceded a good j
chance in the P.A.A. meet.
Hoffman and Evans are Stanford's j
best varsity men in the weight events, i
while Forster, Fleishhacker, Tandy,!
and Way are the strongest weight tos- (
sers from the freshman squad. Hoff-1
man and Evans are both capable of
better distances than they made in
the Big Meet, and they are expected !
to come through in good style May 8.!
The full team entry list for the 1
P.A.A. meet has not been definitely
announced, but it is almost certain
that the list will include the majority
athletic clubs, in addition j
to teams representing several colleges j
in the state.

be among the leaders in both the cen
tury and 220.
Stanford's one-two-three place men
in the javelin throw, Harlow, Joaquin,
and Shipkey, are among the best spear
tossers on the coast, and should en
counter little trouble placing in the
P.A.A. meet. Bill Sparling, freshman
javelin thrower, is real varsity caliber
at the present time, and will give his
older opponents a great battle.
Work and King will offer plenty of
opposition to coast high jumpers, as
each is capable of 6 feet 4 inches or
better. Dick Macßae and Sid Meeks
are the class of the coast in the broad
jump.
Fred Zombro and John Lauritzen,
of the 1929 squad, should make the
varsity broad jumpers extend them
selves for the honors. Both men are
capable of better than 22 feet, and as ;
both are good competitive athletes,
they should figure in the places.
Hulsman Formidable
Hulsman, freshman pole vaulter, has
cleared the bar at 12 feet G inches!
repeatedly, and is able to do even
better under pressure. Chet Ross com
pletely surprised Stanford enthusiasts '
in the Big Meet by going 12 feet 7 j
inches, so he must be conceded a good j
chance in the P.A.A. meet.
Hoffman and Evans are Stanford's j
best varsity men in the weight events, i
while Forster, Fleishhacker, Tandy,!
and Way are the strongest weight tos- (
sers from the freshman squad. Hoff-1
man and Evans are both capable of
better distances than they made in
the Big Meet, and they are expected !
to come through in good style May 8.!
The full team entry list for the 1
P.A.A. meet has not been definitely
announced, but it is almost certain
that the list will include the majority
athletic clubs, in addition j
to teams representing several colleges j
in the state.

Over seventy track athletes will
represent Stanford at the annual Pa
cific Athletic Association's track and
field meet to be held in Kezar Stadium
at San Francisco on Saturday, May 8.
Coach Dink Templeton has entered
his entire freshman and varsity squads
with the intention of taking this year's
P.A.A. track championship.
One of the outstanding attractions
of the meet will be the attempt by the
Stanford relay team to break the
•world's mile relay record. The Cardinal
quartet smashed the Pacific Coast in
tercollegiate record in the meet with
U.S.C. and two weeks later in the
Stanford-California meet they broke
the record again. The time made by
Templeton's one-lap artists in the Big
Meet, 3.19, is just three seconds slower
than the world's record, held by the
University of lowa.
To Attack Record
The Stanford team, composed of
Babcock, Storie, Richardson, and Mil
ler, is undoubtedly one of the fastest,
if not the fastest, mile relay combina
tion in the United States. Miller led
the last California man by sixty yards
in the final lap of the relay in the Big
Meet, after his three teammates had
added yards to the Stanford lead at
each lap. Even with little competition
in the Big Meet the Cardinal runners
managed to turn in a record of 3.19,
and this shows that they can come
mighty close to the world's mark if
they are given the competition.
Stanford's varsity team appears to
be strong in all the events except the
pole vault and two-mile. Miller, Storie,
and Babcock are an almost unbeatable
trio in the 440, while Bill Richardson
is easily the favorite to cop the honors
in the 880. Bill Kerr is the best bet
for the Cardinals in the mile.
Freshmen Figure
West and Spencer are certain to
make a good showing in the hurdles,
with Don Nelson, freshman star, also
figuring in the places. Stanford is not
especially strong in the sprints, but
Caspar, Coverly, or Hvland may break
in for points. Syer, 1929 sprint ace, will
be among the leaders in both the cen
tury and 220.
