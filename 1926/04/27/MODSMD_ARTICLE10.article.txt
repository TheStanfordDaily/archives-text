# LIFE IN TIMES OF QUEEN ELIZABETH IS LECTURE TOPIC
## William Ellsworth, Speaker Tonight, Gives Ideas of Other Colleges 
### 
Describing the life of the times, the
court, the adventurers, the voyagers,
and the contemporaries of Shake
speare, William Webster Ellsworth
will give an illustrated lecture on "The
Times of Queen Elizabeth" in the As
sembly hall at 7:30 o'clock tonight.
Ellsworth, who is author of "The
Golden Age of Authors" and retired
president of the Century Publishing
Company is making an annual lecture
trip from coast to coast. In the course
of his campus visits, Ellsworth, who
has been making mental notes about
the educational systems and the stu
dents of America, says that the young
people of the Middle West and on the
Pacific Coast seem far more eager for
an education than those of the East.
"In the East there are still many
who go to college because of athletics
or social life or because it is the
thing to do." That does not hold true
so much in the West, says Ellsworth.
Urges "Culture" Chair
In speaking of a professorship of
taste and culture which he suggests as
a new chair in colleges, Ellsworth de
clares, "The man or woman for the
post must be just the right sort, and
my ideal would not be easy to find.
He should not have a regular chair,
but be must have an attractive home,
with the right kind of pictures and
books, and he must have the students
in often for teas and talks.
"He must know about music and
art and literature. He must be able to
discuss the new books and he must
have frequent mlisicales, with which
plan the musical department should
co-operate. The professor of art should
be asked in to talk perhaps twice a
month.
"The atmosphere must always be
that of the home and not of the class
room. So much attention is paid at
colleges to things that are not taken
out into life â€”athletics, for instance.
The average college man takes little
interest in them after leaving school
except to go to a baseball game occa
sionally.
Wrong Music Available
"On the other hand, things such as
music are neglected. A college man
hears his glee club and sings 'Onward,
Christian Soldiers,' under his breath
Sunday morning. But he does not learn
to love a Beetthoven symphony or to
know the difference between Bach and
Wagner. And then, in later life, he
goes to a symphony concert and his
education begins.
