A stack of newly cut hay on
the Held behind the art gallery
went up in flames last night at
about 8:45 o'clock. The large fire
truck answered the alarm, while
several freshmen looked on and
shouted their encouragement
from the windows of Encina. The
firemen succeeded in putting out
the blaze. But this was accom
plished only to find another stack
behind the library afire also.
The origin of the two blazes is
unknown, but it is thought likely
from the fact of their starting at
practically the same time that
the damage was caused by some
unknown miscreant.
