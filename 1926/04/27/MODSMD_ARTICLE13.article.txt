# CRANSTON W. HOLMAN ELECTED TO CAPTAIN CARDINAL TENNIS MEN
## Herrington, Neer, Ogden, McElvenny Leave Today For Ojai Tourney 
### 
Cranston W. Holman, '27, ranking
man on the Stanford varsity tennis
team which defeated California this
year, was elected captain for the 1926-
1927 season last night. Holman, for
the past two years the leading Stan
ford player, holds the national junior
tennis title, is eighth ranking player of
the United States, and was a finalist
last year in the national collegiate
singles tournament.
Holman, however, will be unable
to accompany A1 Herrington, Ralph
McElvenny, Lionel Ogden, and Phil
Neer, lettermen, who leave this eve
ning for Ojai, where the Cardinal stars
will enter the tournament which will
be held this Thursday, Friday, and Sat
urday. Heavy scholastic courses will
prevent Holman from defending his
intercollegiate singles title which he
won last year at Ojai.
'Herrington and McElvenny will
play in the intercollegiate doubles and
singles events, while the other two
players are entered in the open singles
and doubles matches. Herrington, at
present second man on the Cardinal
varsity squad, last year won the open
doubles cup paired with Neer, former
Stanford star and intercollegiate
doubles champion. In the same tour
nament, two other present varsity
men, Cranston Holman and Ogden,
made a clean sweep in the intercol
legiate events, taking the doubles and
Holman winning the singles.

The Ojai tournament as one of the
outstanding events of the Southern
part of California annually attracts an
entry list of more than 150 tennis en
thusiasts, including the greater part
of California's nationally noted play
ers. Harold God shall and Harvey S nod
grass are included in this year's entry
lists, along with Art Duff, Southern
Branch, Fred Houser of U. S. C., and
Frank Cutler and Harry Shaw, San
Diego Teachers' College, all players of
intercollegiate worth.
