seventh inning run in a 12-11 game.

last inning to win a 4-2 victory over
Delta Upsilon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon

with El Capitan with a 4-1 win. Juni

S.A.E. Carries On
The Phi Sig squad scored strong
in the first and second inning and
again in the fifth. Hits were very much
in evidence on both sides. Hawkins
and Bryant served as the Phi Sig bat
tery, and Follansbee and Freeman for
Theta Xi.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon continued its
winning streak yesterday when it de
feated El Capitan in a hotly-contested
game .Strong pitching by Laßue and
close fielding by the El Capitan squad
featured the entire battle.
Canfield held down the batting in
the first inning to two strikeouts and
one fly, but an error by Silvius in the
second let McDermott of the S.A.E.'s
get safely on first. Gibbons was walked
immediately afterward with Shuinaker
and Peters fanning. Todd connected
