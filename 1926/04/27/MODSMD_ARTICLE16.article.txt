# THETA XI WINS FROM PHI SIGS IN CLOSE GAME
## Junipero Serras Have Easy Time Beating Branner Nine, 15 to 10 CHI PSIS DEFEAT D. U.'S LaRue Pitches S.A.E. to 4-1 Victory Over El Capitan In Tight Contest 
### 
Three close scores, one walkaway,
and one default sum up yesterday's
intramural ball play. Theta Xi nosed
out Phi Sigma Kappa with a lucky
seventh inning run in a 12-11 game.
Chi Psi likewise came through in the
last inning to win a 4-2 victory over
Delta Upsilon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
managed to come out of a tight battle
with El Capitan with a 4-1 win. Juni
pero Serra ran away with Branner I,
winning 15-10. El Cuadro won from
Encina II by default.
A disastrous second inning of pitch
ing gave Theta Xi a strong lead of six
runs in their game with Phi Sigma
Kappa. Several body hits, a number
of walks, plus more easy throws, were
dealt out at this time by Hawkins of
the Phi Sigs. Van Vorhis, Finch, Fol
lansbee, Freeman, Fain, and Casad
came through for the markers.
S.A.E. Carries On
The Phi Sig squad scored strong
in the first and second inning and
again in the fifth. Hits were very much
in evidence on both sides. Hawkins
and Bryant served as the Phi Sig bat
tery, and Follansbee and Freeman for
Theta Xi.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon continued its
winning streak yesterday when it de
feated El Capitan in a hotly-contested
game .Strong pitching by Laßue and
close fielding by the El Capitan squad
featured the entire battle.
Canfield held down the batting in
the first inning to two strikeouts and
one fly, but an error by Silvius in the
second let McDermott of the S.A.E.'s
get safely on first. Gibbons was walked
immediately afterward with Shuinaker
and Peters fanning. Todd connected
squarely with the ball to slam out a i
two-base hit which brought in McDer- j
niott and Gibbons.
Although the S.A.E. squad continued I
to get good hits throughout Uie next 1
four innings, the El Capitan fielding
effectively shut out any chance of!
scoring. Keyes and Laßue succeeded
in reaching home in the last of the i
i sixth to set the final score. Read j
brought in the lone El Capitan marker |
in the seventh.
A pinch hit by Ditzler in the seventh
inning changed a tie score into a vic
: tory for the Chi Psis against the!
j D. U.'s. The game was mainly charac-1
terized by errors and poor fielding, j
with the redeeming feature of good
pitching on both sides. Robertson and !
Abramson were responsible for the j
two Delta Upsilon scores, while King, |
Ankele, and Ditzler brought in the
four Chi Psi runs.
In a lagging, loosely played contest, i
Junipero Serra Club won over Branner |
j I, 15-10, on the Sequoia diamond. The i
Serra team outclassed Branner at the
| start, stepping into an early lead, S-3,
I and then proceeded to play listless ball
j for the rest of the game. Harold and
j Scherer, battery for the club nine, held
the hall team to few hits, most of the
scores resulting from errors in the
infield.
Bush League Stuff
j Through an error, Branner was al
lowed five unexpected scores. The I
score was 14-5, and Harold, thinking j
; it was the last of the seventh, lobbed j
the ball over in order to afford his men j
some needed fielding practice. Bran-1
ner took quick advantage, scoring five
runs and putting themselves in a posi
j tion to threaten. But when the seventh
| inning did come Harold tightened and
retired the opposition with no further
j scores.
The pitching yesterday was other-1
I wise good, Fry for Branner and Har
old giving but one walk each. Fry
j struck out ten men during the after
noon, but to make up for this, the
Serra Club batters found him for many
hits.
