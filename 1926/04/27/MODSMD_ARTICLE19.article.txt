# An Opportunity

A recent editorial in this column was devoted to explaining that, de
sirable as such additions would be, Stanford is not vet in a position to or
\
ganize colleges of Music and Fine Arts.
Now comes the new plan of the Executive Committee which if suffi
ciently supported by the student body will insure the appearance here next
year of several of the outstanding musicians of the world, those whose
names are invariably thought of by everyone when music is discussed.
This week will decide whether the scheme will stand or fallâ€”whether this
praiseworthy venture will be carried out or whether it will fail for lack of
support and next year's program will be destitute of a single worthwhile
musical event. The situation would be just that, for the plan comes at a
particularly critical time in the musical affairs of the University and the
vicinity. Both the Stanford Symphony Committee, which has brought the
San Francisco orchestra here every year, and the Peninsula Music Asso
ciation, which produces an annual series of solo concerts, are in precarious
financial straits, and grave doubt exists whether they will be able to con
tinue next year. Both organizations have declared themselves in favor
of the Executive Commitfee's plan which would not only preserve the
orchestra concert, but would bring a list of solo artists of international
fame to the campus. This the Peninsula Association has dreamed of doing
for years, but has been unable because of the large sums demanded by the
musicians for a single concert.
Use of the Basketball Pavilion, which has been pronounced an excel
lent acoustic setting for concerts, enables the sale of sufficient seats for
each concert to make the plan possible. It is safe to predict that crowds
of several thousand will be contributed to each concert by towns on the
Peninsula whose citizens have been unable to hear these musical celebrities
without journeying to San Francisco, and then at high rates.
The Pavilion on the night of a concert should present a memorable
sight, and the good that the plan would do the University in promoting
good will and a friendly feeling in the vicinity cannot be overemphasized.
Briefly the idea is this : the Associated Students themselves will promote
a series of six recitals to'occur during the three quarters of next year, in
which such singers as Louis Graveure, baritone; Tito Schipa, tenor; and
Rosa Ponselle, soprano; will sing and such instrumental artists as Mischa
Elman with his string quartet, and the San Francisco Symphony under Dr.
Alfred Hertz, will play. Season tickets will be offered the students at the
rate of $3 for the six events. This low price is possible only because of the
season ticket plan for almost all of the artists have contracts which set a
minimum figure of $2 or $3 for individual concerts. It is safe to say that
it would cost a campus dweller more to go to the city and get the cheapest
seat for any one of these musicians there than the entire series sells for
here.
Thirteen hundred pledges are needed before the Executive Committee
will feel safe in going ahead with its arrangements. To those who may
have been hanging back on grounds of being "unable to understand good
music" it might be said that they will never have better opportunity to find
out how understandable and enjoyable it really is.
