man, gained the first victory for the
upperclassmen by trimming John Wil
liams in three sets, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. Wil

struggle, but under the hot sun and
the steady driving of Wheldon, grew
sufficiently unsteady to come out sec
ond best.

junior win at the expense of Charles
West, 6-4, 6-2. West relies upon an

the only doubles match of the day.
