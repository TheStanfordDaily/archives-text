NEAR-CHEER
This is just a little message of hope and good cheer to those of us who
are, perhaps, too studiously inclined. Remember that while there is life
there is hope, maybe.
The precocious-looking chap in the field glasses may be a Block "S" man
—and then again, he may not. That petrified bolony with the spindle legs
might be a football hero. You can't tell. Never judge a person or a blind
date by appearances.
To some of us studying is a gift—that is to say, we had it wished on us,
when we would be the school idol who wins the track meet by placing first
in every event. Instead, we do naught but pile up surplus honor points, and
wear specs. Damnit they ain't any justice.
Now let us give you a little advice on ho\y to be the chief itch of the
campus—first, throw oft the specs, be done with them; second, get a hair-cut;
third, wear loud pants and louder socks; fourth, cut all classes; fifth, queen
all the time and any time; and sixth, what you damn please.
Write for all the shows, and take the leading parts. Parade up and down
the row in a doggy roadster, and raise cain in general.
These simple instructions will make a hero of you—a Stanford man to
whom other Stanford men will point and say, "There goes Willie McGoop,
a regular guy and a bear with the women. He used to stand 34 plus 152, in
the bawl-out, now he is 56-78 and going strong."
So weep not, ye drones, but do as Willie did and become the most
popular man in school. Remember IT CAN BE DONE.
P.S. Willie flunked out for the second time last quarter; he isn't coming
back any more. —W.
