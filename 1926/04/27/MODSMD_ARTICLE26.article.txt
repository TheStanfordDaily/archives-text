### 
UNIVERSITY OP WASHINGTON—
(P.I.P.) —With the first half of the
spring football training period ended,
Coach Enoch Bagshaw is considering j
dispensing with the annual class i
games, because of the small number i
of upperclassmen turning out. So far, 1
only four seniors and ten juniors have j
shown sufficient interest to report for 1
the practice sessions.
At present, the coaching staff is 1
sending (he men through regular 1
scrimmage work.
