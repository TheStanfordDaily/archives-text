# PAVILION SUITED FOR ANY MUSICAL EVENT, SAYS ALFRED HERTZ
## 
### 
"Stanford's basketball pavilion lias (
excellent acoustic qualities for any
sort of musical event; it is far super
ior to the Assembly hall in this re-j
gard. I would like to conduct my
orchestra there some time." This was .
the statement of Dr. Alfred Hertz,!
known to students and faculty of Stan
ford as the popular leader of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, which
has appeared on the campus in two or
more annual concerts for the past ten
years. He had just completed a careful
test for the basketball pavilion with a
view to determining its possibilities
for use as an auditorium.
Dr. Hertz's desire to conduct a con
cert in the pavilion may be realized
and in addition Stanford students may
have the rare opportunity of hearing
not only the San Francisco Orchestra
again next year but four musicians
whom public and critics alike have
acclaimed as outstanding in their
fields. Whether all this will take place
depends only upon the response made
by the student body to the Executive
Committee's plan for producing a
series of six concerts spaced during
the three quarters of fiext year. Every
student will be asked to sign a card
by which he pledges himself to pur
chase one of the $3 season tickets
which will be good for the entire
[ series.
If thirteen hundred of these pledges
are obtained the contracts will be
signed which will bring to the Stan
ford pavilion next year the following
internationally famous group: Louis
Graveure, premier baritone of the con
cert stage; Mischa Elman, appearing
with his remarkable new string quar
tet; the San Francisco Symphony;
Tito Schipa, operatic tenor of .the
I Metropolitan Opera Company; and
j Rosa Ponselle, prima donna soprano,
' ulso of that Company. Her rare voice,
personal beauty, and personality have
caused critics to write of her only in
superlatives.
Many of the living groups will have
the opportunity to sign the pledge
cards at dinner tonight, and before
the week is over the Executive Com
! mittee will know whether or not Stan
| ford has responded to one of the most
| ambitious schemes so far conceived to
'bring the best in art to her campus.
