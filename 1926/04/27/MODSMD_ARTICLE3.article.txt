# '27 Opera Begins Final Rounds Of Chorus Practice
## 
### 
With the last song sent to the or
chestrator, Jack Wiggiu, musical di
rector for the 1927 Junior Opera, "Ride
a Cock Horse," which will be pre
sented in the Assembly hall Friday
and Saturday, May 7 and 8, has com
menced final work with the choruses
and soloists.
Owing to the nature of the music
for "Ride a Cock Horse," it has been
a difficult job to get it in shape. The
period of the show is the early nine
teenth century in England, and conse
quently the usual jazz heard in cam
pus productions cannot be used. A
compromise was necessary to keep the
atmosphere of the time and yet to
make it modern enough to hold the
interest of the audience.
Like "Vagabond King"
The compromise is a middle point
between "The Vagabond King," one
of the latest costume musical come
dies to use ultra-modern scores, and
"The Student Prince," which used the
old-fashioned type exclusively. "The
Vagabond King" has met with suc
cess with the public, and has been
both favorably and adversely criticized
by the musical critics in New York.
Most of the libretto in "Ride a Cock
Horse" is composed of folk songs and
country dances of the older period.
There are also songs more martial in
type, such as the opening chorus and
the Night Riders' Song, which is one
of the features, written by Wiggin and
Ted Duncan.
Research Undertaken
A great deal of research work was
done by Wiggin and Gordon Hall,
musical assistant, in finding old songs,
lyrics, and history, m the library, be
fore the songs could be written. After
this was done, the composers had to
adapt music to the ideas to modern
musical comedy style. The latest light
comic opera ideas are being inculcated
into the work in an attempt to break
away from the stereotyped college and
amateur work.
A single song theme has been run
through the entire libretto, to give it
more of a continuity and to leave with
the audience the high points of the
songs.
The feature pieces of the show have
been written by Ted Duncan, Gordon
Hall, Jean Wakefield, and Jack Wig
gin. The lyrics were composed by the
authors, Tommy Breeze and Harry
Boutell, and Gregory Williamson.
