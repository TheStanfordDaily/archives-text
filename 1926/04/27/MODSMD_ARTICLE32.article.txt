# STANFORD SWIMMERS PREPARE FOR MEET WITH SAN JOSE MEN
## Brandsten Expects Little Difficulty in Winning Encounter Friday 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimmers will
meet the San Jose alumni aquatic team
next Friday evening in the pool of
the Garden City team. Although the j
Cardinal team is not full strength this
quarter and may be weak in one or!
two events, a victory is anticipated by j
Coach Ernst Brandsten. The San Jose
pool is one of the shortest in the
vicinity, measuring only sixty feet, j
Many of the races will be decided
largely by the ability of tho competing j
swimmers to take the many turns this
pool necessitates..
Recent tryouts against time seem j
to point to Cardinal superiority in at'
least three events. Ted Smith, who |
placed second in the backstroke race |
in the Stanford-California meet last
quarter, has been improving steadily i
this quarter and last week was clocked
in a hundred in 1:12, which is two-;
fifths of a second under the present
Stanford-California record established
last quarter by Arden Allen. Smith
also made 1:22 in the 100-yard breast
stroke.
New Stars Loom
In a practice 100-yard free style held i
yesterday, Kryne van Den Akker, who
swam to a second place in the 220;
against California, beat out a fast!
field in the creditable time of :58 2-5 j
seconds. A few inches behind was |
Allen Christensen, a transfer from i
Utah University, who will be eligible!
for next year's swimming team and is \
expected by Brandsten to be one of j
the mainstays. Christiansen and his i
brother, Lee, both of whom were cap- j
tains of the Utah team, made :58 flat!
for the century free style and this
quarter had several times hung up
the speedy time of :25 flat for the i
fifty. He is also capable of 1:19 or'
better in the 100-yard breaststroke be- j
sides doing a pretty backstroke. His ]
all-round swimming ability and endur- 1
ance were proved when he made 4:lf>
in his first attempt at the 300-yard |
medley race. Ted Smith, the present)
medley star of 0 the University, has ,
only made six seconds under this time.; j
Bob Harris, a member of the Stan- J
ford relay team, was not far behind .
the leaders in the 100-yard trial. Both â– 
he and Van den Akker have gone a
shade under :2G in the fifty.
With these men swimming the'
sprints and Carl Stevenson, varsity
middle distance star in the 220, the;
Cards seem likely to collect the lion's 1
share of the points in the free style !
events as well as the backstroke. Dave i
Fall in the diving should have a clear
field against San Jose competition.
It is in the breaststroke that the;
alumni team appears strongest and
Stanford weakest. Willis, of San Jose,!
has made around 1:15 in the 100-yard;
sailor style swim in his home pool.
Warren Littlefield, formerly of j
Stockton's swimming team, and one j
of the greatest breaststroke men on i
the coast, is registered in the Univer- j
sity this quarter but. will not be eligi-';
ble for competition in the meet. He j i
will, however, go along and swim an '
exhibition. Over a course of the 60-foot <
length he has recently made the re-j
-markable time of 1:11, and may with ' j
his speed on the turns go under this
on Friday. Wagner, the varsity's best i
eligible breaststroke performer, will j
not be able to compete in the meet.
