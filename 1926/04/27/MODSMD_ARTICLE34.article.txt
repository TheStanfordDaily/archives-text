# STRICT DISCIPLINE FEATURES RUSSIAN SCHOOLS, SAYS LANZ
## Students Have Less Freedom Now Than Before War; Must Work Hard 
### 
"One of the striking characteristics
of university education in Russia if
the existence of more strict discipline
than that exercised before the war,'
said Dr. Henry Lanz of the Slavi<
languages department who spoke be
fore the Cosmopolitan Club last night
Lanz recently returned from a three
months' trip in Russia.
"A few years ago Russian collegf
students were constantly lighting foi
academic freedom and freedom of as
sociation with students, and they were
not obliged to go to classes. Now the}
are required to attend classes, and
they must do a great deal of work ir
order to avoid dismissal from the uni
versity.
Discipline Is Strict
"Owing to the existing discipline
and the obligation to attend classes
students are very careful about their
work and universities are successfully
turning out good specialists. Since it
is the work of the universities to train
specialists, they fail to aid the old re
search activities which are now con
centrated about institutes or acade
mies."
Speaking of institutes, Lanz referred
to a pedagogical laboratory for re
search work along pedagogical lines.
Research workers are using intelli
gence tests in an effort to find out
statistically the average of achieve
ments during each year of school
work.
Primary Grades Easy
In contrast to the rigid discipline in
universities, that of primary and sec
ondary schools is lax. Pupils are ac
customed to enjoy complete freedom
with consequent ijoise in classrooms.
Educational experiments in America
taken to Russia fail because the sys
tem of education is not prepared for
innovations such as are in this coun
try.
Studies of sociology are the most
important of any school program in
Russia. Although the study of Rus
sian language is absent as a separate
subject, it is considered part of socio
logical courses, and teachers instruct
in the language while they are teach
ing them political and social theories
and are discussing economic condi
tions.
