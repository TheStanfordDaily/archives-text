# INDIANS ORIGINATED LA CROSSE, NATIONAL SPORT OF CANADIANS
## Willingness to Coach Game At Stanford Expressed By "Pop" Warner 
### John M. Reily 
By John M. Reily

Lacrosse, a game which is rapidly
gaining popularity as an important
sport in this country, is an old Indian
game and gets its name from the re
semblance of the most important im
plement of the game to a bishop's
crozier. It is the national game of the
Canadians and was adopted by them
from the original inhabitants of this
country.
Lacrosse, as played by the Indians,
was almost as important as a battle
and the night before was taken up
with revelry and wagering on the out
come. The warriors of two different
tribes lined up on the sides of the
field 800 or 1000 strong and in full
war paint carried on an all-day game.
The medicine men acted as referees
and the squaws urged their braves on
to greater accomplishments by follow
ing them around the field with whips.
With the crosse the Indians brained
each other as well as batting the ball.
The game attracted much attention
among the French settlers in Canada,
and found favor with the British set
tlers. However, it was not until 1867
when Canada became a Dominion that
G. W. Beers, a prominent player, sug
gested that lacrosse be made the na
tional game. An association was
formed and the game has flourished
vigorously since then.
The game as it is played now neces
sitates the use of a light rubber ball
about the size of a tennis ball, and
the crosse whiter is a curved stick
something like a hockey stick with a
loose network fastened across it. The
object is to send the ball by means of
the crosse through the opponents' goal
posts at the end of a field 100 or 150
yards long. The hall may be hit,
thrown, or carried with the crosse. A
team consists of twelve men and a
game lasts for two thirty- or forty
minute halves.
In an interview last year "Pop"
Warner expressed his willingness to
coach this game at Stanford. He had
experience in such coaching while at
Carlisle. The season is from March to
June and would fit in with the other
seasons very readily.
All the large Eastern colleges play
the game as a minor sport, and it is a
very important game in England. This
year a team made up of the best men
from the Oxford and Cambridge teams
is touring the East and the popularity
it is receiving is shown by the fact
that the Yale bowl was used for a
game with the Englishmen.

Lacrosse, a game which is rapidly
gaining popularity as an important
sport in this country, is an old Indian
game and gets its name from the re
semblance of the most important im
plement of the game to a bishop's
crozier. It is the national game of the
Canadians and was adopted by them
from the original inhabitants of this
country.
Lacrosse, as played by the Indians,
was almost as important as a battle
and the night before was taken up
with revelry and wagering on the out
come. The warriors of two different
tribes lined up on the sides of the
field 800 or 1000 strong and in full
war paint carried on an all-day game.
The medicine men acted as referees
and the squaws urged their braves on
to greater accomplishments by follow
ing them around the field with whips.
With the crosse the Indians brained
each other as well as batting the ball.
The game attracted much attention
among the French settlers in Canada,
and found favor with the British set
tlers. However, it was not until 1867
when Canada became a Dominion that
G. W. Beers, a prominent player, sug
gested that lacrosse be made the na
tional game. An association was
formed and the game has flourished
vigorously since then.
The game as it is played now neces
sitates the use of a light rubber ball
about the size of a tennis ball, and
the crosse whiter is a curved stick
something like a hockey stick with a
loose network fastened across it. The
object is to send the ball by means of
the crosse through the opponents' goal
posts at the end of a field 100 or 150
yards long. The hall may be hit,
thrown, or carried with the crosse. A
team consists of twelve men and a
game lasts for two thirty- or forty
minute halves.
In an interview last year "Pop"
Warner expressed his willingness to
coach this game at Stanford. He had
experience in such coaching while at
Carlisle. The season is from March to
June and would fit in with the other
seasons very readily.
All the large Eastern colleges play
the game as a minor sport, and it is a
very important game in England. This
year a team made up of the best men
from the Oxford and Cambridge teams
is touring the East and the popularity
it is receiving is shown by the fact
that the Yale bowl was used for a
game with the Englishmen.
