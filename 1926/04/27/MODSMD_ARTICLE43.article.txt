## Two Pirate Stars 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is the biggest double-attraction that occupies one side of any infield
in baseball today, not excepting Kelly and Frlsch, of the Giants, or Bottomley
and Hornsby, of the Cardinals. For Glenn Wright and Pie Traynor, ot Pitts
burgh, are so good, both 011 attack and defense, that old-time fans are
beginning to agree that they even surpass the work of such star left-side
combinations as Turner and Bradley, of Cleveland; Tinker and Steinfeldt,
of the Cubs; and Barry and Baker, of the Athletics. And many and long are
the debates as to whether or not they are as great—or ever will be as great—
as Wagner and Leach of the Pirates. Only Herman Long and Jimmy Collins,
of Boston, seem, so far, to be the goal of perfection for these two young Pirate
infielders to shoot at.
Consider for a moment the combined statistics of the play last year of
these two youngsters. They batted .314, scored 211 runs, made 378 hits (each
got 189), including 24 home runs, and drove in a total of 227 runs. On
defense, they made 564 put outs and 833 assists —their total chances being
1477, of which 80 went for errors. Individually, each had the most chances
and made the most assists of anyone in the league at their respective posi
tions. and Traynor made more putouts.
Wright and Traynor's average age is 25, they weigh 170 pounds, and are
5 feet 11 inches and 6 feet tall, respectively. They should keep up the good
work for many years to come, surpassing even Long and Collins.
"G. W." stands for George Washington—and Glenn Wright. There is a
saying, "I'd rather be right than President." That's O. K., but I'm darned if I
can decide if I'd rather be Wright than Traynor!
