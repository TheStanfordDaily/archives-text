# NATURE OF FOOD DOES NOT ALTER STOUTNESS
## 
### 
An investigation was recently con
ducted in the Anatomy department
which seemed to prove that stoutness
and leanness are little affected by the
food that the individual eats.
White mice were used for the ex
periment. Two mice of the same spe
cies were confined in separate cages
and fed exactly the same food at exactly
the same hours during the day. In
spite of this, one individual is nearly
three times the size of the other.
According to Professor Danforth,
who has been conducting the investi
gation, these facts should be of in
terest to human dieters.
