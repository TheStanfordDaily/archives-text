"That many of the alumni came
fifty or a hundred miles to attend a
Stanford meeting to hear someone
from the University is clear evi
dence that the alumni are vitally in
terested in the welfare of their Alma
Mater," says John E. McDowell, alumni
secretary, who has just returned from
a five weeks' trip in the East.
McDowell, who went East to attend
the thirteenth annual conference of
the Association of Alumni Secretaries
held in Columbus, Ohio, on April 15,
1(>, and 17, visited about fifteen Stan
ford alumni centers during his trip.
The alumni held luncheons and din
ners where McDowell talked to them
about their own organization. The his
tory, accomplisments, and future of
the alumni society was outlined by
McDowell in his message to the gath
erings.
Alumni Interested
"Alumni seemed to be most vitally
interested in Stanford's progress," de
clared McDowell. "Never before have
I found them so intensely loyal and
interested in the welfare of the Uni
versity."
One of the most interesting meet
ings, according to McDowell, was held
at Harvard where forty-three Stanford
men who are of the class of '24 or '25
are attending Harvard School of Busi
ness or the Law School. Among others
who were at this alumni gathering
were Professor John Tatlock, a former
member of the English department,
and Professor Henry Fairclough, of
the classical literature department,
who is on a year's leave of absence,
teaching at Harvard.
