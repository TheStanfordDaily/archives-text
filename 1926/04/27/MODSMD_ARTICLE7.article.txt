# PRESIDENT WILBUR TO INAUGURATE WOMEN'S OFFICERS AT DINNER
## 
### 
The installation of next year's of
ficers of Associated Women Students
will take place at the Women's Con
ference party to be held Thursday
night, April 29, in the Clubhouse, when
dinner will be served at 6 o'clock for
all women students. The new regime
of executives will be duly sworn into
office by President Wilbur at this
meeting.
The custom of the formal initiation
of the officers into the duties of their
respective positions is a recent de
velopment in the women's administra
tion. Mildred Worswick, last year's
president, was the first to be sworn
into office by Dr. Wilbur. According
to Miss Worswick it will become one
of Stanford's traditions to have a for
mal installation of the members of
Women's Council.
Make Annual Report
A report of the year's work accom
plished by A.W.S. and Conference will
be presented by Miss Worswick, and
a complete resume of the Western In
tercollegiate Conference of A.W.S. to
which she and Charlotte Lovekin were
delegates will be made.
The various women's presidents in
the West believe that many problems
which are similar in themselves on
each campus differing in the condi
tions at the separate university, can
be solved in a much more effective
manner after a thorough and enlight
ening discussion of them in an assem
bly. The suggestions made by the re
cent convention will be presented
Thursday evening.
New Officers
The new officers of Associated Wo
men Students are Charlotte Lovekin,
president; Barbara Berkins, vice-presi
dent; Eleanor Davidson, secretary;
Kathreen Clock, senior member; and
Anne Bancroft, junior member. Going
jout of office after a year's service are
Mildred Worswick, Margaret Dietrick,
jand Gladys MeLcod, the senior mem
bers of the present Women's Council.
Dinner will be served in the Club
house to all the women in three shifts
before the Conference party. The din
ing rooms of the living groups will
'close. Tickets of three different colors
' will be sold in the different groups as
! dinner is served at six, six-thirty and
I seven o'clock. The Conference dinner
, will help to materially decrease the
debt on the Women's Clubhouse.
