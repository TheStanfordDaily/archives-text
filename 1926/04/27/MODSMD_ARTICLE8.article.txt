# WOOLLEY TALKS ON EDUCATION AS ADVENTURE
## Holyoke President Favors Teaching as Individual Undertaking TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY Will Give Opportunity to Compare Various Plans Of Study 
### 
"Education as an Adventure" is the
subject of the University Assembly
address of President Mary E. Woolley
of Mt. Holvoke College in the Assem
bly hall at 11 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing.
President Woolley will emphasize
her own belief in the desirability of
regarding education as an individual
rather than a mass undertaking. Stan
ford men and women will be given an
opportunity to compare Stanford's ac
complishments in this direction
through the "independent study plan"
and similar devices with what other
institutions are doing.
Dr. Woolley speaks from the experi
ence of a president who has for a
quarter of a century put her ideas into
practice in a progressive and growing
college, who has watched the develop
ment of other colleges during that
period, and who is an active leader not
only in educational affairs but in a
wide range of civic and world move
ments.
Is Brown Graduate
President Woolley is a graduate of
Brown University and holds honorary
degrees not only from that institution
but from several others, including
Yale, Amherst, and Smith. She has
been active in the progress of higher
education for women in all parts of
the world, and is also a member of
many boards concerned with men's col
leges and education in general.
World peace has always had her
effective support, and she has held
office in most of the bodies devoted
to securing such peace. An indication
of the breadth of her interests is
given by her membership in the New
England Woman's Press Association
and in the Board of Electors of the
Hall of Fame. She has written on such
varied topics as the history of the
early Colonial postoffice and the de
velopment of the love of romantic
scenery in America.
