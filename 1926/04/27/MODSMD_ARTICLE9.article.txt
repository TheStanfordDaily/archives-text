An exhibit of block prints and etch
ings by European artists has been put
011 display at the Art Gallery. The
works are all legitimate prints, in that
the colors have been applied on the
blocks rather than 011 the pictures
themselves. One work is that of "Blue
Butterflies" by Louis Icart, which
shows extreme care and application
011 the part of the artist. The picture,
of a lady in a dainty dress of black
lace of an intricate pattern, shows
with clearness each design of the beau
tiful lace, as well as the delicate blend
ing of others colors which form the
background of the scene.
"Prague Under the Snow" is an
original etching, the proof of which
was taken from a copper plate. The
plate, each time it was applied to the
print, was hand-inked and liand-paint
ed. The printing was also done by
hand. This picture was published in a
limited edition, numbered and signed
by the artist, and the plate was de
stroyed upon its completion.
Still another work deserving men
tion is "Silk Merchants of India" by
Charles W. Bartlett. This work is ex
tremely colorful, with bright, deep
blues and greens, which are in direct
contrast* to a picture by Georges
Plasse, which shows a charming diffu
sion of colors. This exquisite blending
effect is shown to best advantage in
the sky coloring, where orange and
yellow tints shade into a place delicate
blue.
Each picture in the collection has
some distinctive, original feature. "The
etchings are done in aquatint, soft
ground, and hard-ground work.
