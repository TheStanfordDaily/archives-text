For the Prom
Evening clothes portray your
Individuality. If you wear
Someone else's tuxedo you are
Not yourself. When a man
Essays to wear formal attire

Be exact; his shirt, meticulous;
His studs and his links—they
Must all blend into the picture.

Helpful in making selections
Of formal dress accoutrements.
