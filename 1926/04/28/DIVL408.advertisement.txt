Otis Micro-Drive Elevators, as developed for the mine laying ships and for the
great Armjrand Navy Bases at New York and Boston, are now in constant use

as saving time in operation, and increasing the life of the apparatus. On freight
elevators it also provides an exactly level landing to facilitate the handling of freight.
