Something different in
Shirts and Neckwear
When you get tired of ordinary and everyday
patterns and colorings . . . and begin to
feel the urge for something different in your
shirts and neckwear . . . step around to see
my offerings.
You'll be sure to find the new and novel in
the extensive assortments ... in just the
designs and colors you seek . . . with the
sparkle and vigor that sets them apart as
"something different."
