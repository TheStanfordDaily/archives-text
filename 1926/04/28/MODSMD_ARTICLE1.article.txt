18-0 tally, while Sigma Chi managed to
keep ahead of Kappa Alpha long
enough to win 5-3.

Consistent twirling by Green, Theta
Chi moundsman, kept the Zetes down
to a very few hits and many fans.
Brock, of the Zetes, proved almost
equally capable in the matter of pitch
ing, holding the Theta Chi squad to
a minimum of hits. Good fielding, how
ever, was the strong point of the game.
Both sides cut down on errors, par
ticularly on flies and base-throws.
Cass Scores
Cass accounted for the lone run of
the Zetes in the first, while True and
Greene made the two winning runs for
the Theta Chi squad in the fourth and
fifth.
Kappa Sigma got off to a flying start
against Los Arcos in the first inning
when six runs were made in rapid
succession. The lead was followed up
again in the second and the fourth
with four and eight runs scored. The
effective pitching of the Moore broth
ers practically limited the Los Arcos
batting to strikeouts and an occasional
walk to first base. Conover, Farewell,
Stephens, and Southward accounted
for most of the runs.
Sigma Chi Wins
The Sigma Chi-Kappa Alpha tangle
proved to be one of the hardest played
contests of the present round. Sigma
•Chi gained the lead early in the con
test and managed to keep safely ahead
until threatened by two runs scored
by Kappa Alpha in the last inning.
Dryden's pitching held the Kappa
Alphas down to three hits. Coleman
brought in two of the five winning
Sigma Chi runs, while Dryden, Adams,
and Snook accounted for the other
three.
