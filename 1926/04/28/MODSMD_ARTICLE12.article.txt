# PLEDGE CARDS FOR 1927 CONCERTS TO CIRCULATE ON QUAD
## Twenty California Musical Authorities Plan to Attend Concert 
### 
Encouraging results have been re
ceived from the season ticket pledge
cards circulated for the Executive
Committee's plan of holding a Series
of six concerts in the pavilion next
year. Several sororities and fraterni
ties have turned in their cards.

Pledge cards will be placed in the
Bookstore and all those who have not
had an opportunity to get them
through their living group are re
quested to obtain them there. Before
the week is over every member of the
student body will have had an oppor
tunity to indicate support for the con
certs. Boxes will be placed on the
Quad tomorrow in which cards can
be deposited.

The plan is briefly as follows: Six]
concerts will be given next year under
the auspices of the Associated Stu-!
dents if sufficient support, is assured j
this quarter. Thirteen hundred pledges :
from Stanford students for the $3 sea-!
son tickets will be required before the !
contracts with the artists can be!
signed by the "Executive Committee,
representatives. Louis Graveure, Bel- j
gian baritone; Mischa Elman and his j
string quartet; Tito Schipa, operatic i
tenor; and Rosa Ponselle, prima donna j
soprano of the Metropolitan Opera
Company, are included. The San Fran- 1
cisco Symphony Orchestra will also,
play in one concert.
