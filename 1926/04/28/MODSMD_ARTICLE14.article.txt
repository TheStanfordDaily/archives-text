# THINKING WOMEN, MEN NEEDED FOR WORLD-WOOLLEY
## World Civilization Depends On Leaders Who Have Chance to Think 
### 
Believing that the American stu
dents with their wealth and unlimited
opportunities are losing much of the
spirit of adventure in education, Mary
E. Woolley, president of Mt. Holyoke
College .who spoke at the University
Assembly today, pleaded for a greater
percentage of thinking men and wo
men for this century.

Education has been an adventure to
the men who have made real to us j
such inventions as the telegraph and j
the telephone. They have thought into j
and around their problems. Dr. Wool-'
ley pointed out that education as an
adventure of the mind should not be j
confined to scientists, discoverers, and i
outstanding leaders since the world of
the twentieth century needs thinking 1
men and women with trained, disci-!
plined minds ready to meet the inter- j
class and world problems.
The downfall or upward progress of
the world's civilization depends not
on the few leaders but on the rank
and file of real leaders, those men and
women who have developed the power
of thought. In the light of this neces- j
sity, students should not regard college
as a pleasant way to spend time or i
as a means to a social or economic I
end but as an adventure of the mind.'
Illustrating mass education by re- :
ferring to the recent decrease in il
literacy in China brought about by
spread of the fundamentals of reading
and writing. Dr. Woolley characterized
the "revolution in China as a revolu-;
tion of the mind." The Chinese student ;
body, which is vitally interested in
political and social development, has j
an important influence on these condi
tions.
The twentieth century world is char
acterized by the five-lettered word, i
"inter," as found in international, in- ;
ter-racial, interworld, according to Dr.
Woolley. The problem of students of
today is to understand this word and :
to apply it.
