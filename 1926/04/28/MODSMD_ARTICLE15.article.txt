# SENIOR CLASS WILL FINANCE BUILDING OF DRINKING FOUNTAIN
## 
### 
The Seniors voted to construct an- j
other fountain for the Inner Quad at '
a meeting in the Women's Clubhouse
last night. This is carrying out the
policy commenced two years ago by
the graduating class of 1924.
Delmer Daves, president, gave a
written questionnaire to the class
members. These questions, he said, j
were to secure general information
of what a student knows after four i
years in college. The subjects were
art, literature, music, commerce, and
government. Sociological questions of!
a very personal nature were given j
separately to the men and women, i
causing much comment. The results j
and the list of the questions will be j
given as soon as Daves has collected
them.
The wffrk of the Endowment Com- j
mittee under Hartley Devlin has been
completed. The Aetna Company's bid '
was accepted as their offer was $6.50 |
a year for the premiums compared J
with $7 offered by the other com
panies.
The premium itself will be $6.18, the
additional 32 cents allowing for any!
lapses that may occur. At the end ofj
twenty-five years the lump sum of
approximately $100,000 will be turned
over to the University as a gift from
the Class of 1926.
