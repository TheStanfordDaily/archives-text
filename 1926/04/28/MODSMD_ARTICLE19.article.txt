Sigma Alpha, national political science
fraternity, at a convention held the

Texas. Professor Patterson, head of
the Political Science department of the

fraternity, Alpha Pi Zeta, on February
9 of this year. Luther Evans, formerly
of Texas, now an instructor here, in
stalled the chapter.
Alpha Pi Zeta was founded in 1902
and had chapters at Stanford and Cali
fornia, but due to the fact that a
national social science fraternity is
called by the same name the members
of the Stanford chapter determined to
transfer their membership to the Pi
Sigma Alpha fraternity.
At a meeting held Thursday by the
j Stanford chapter Paul E. Jackson was
j elected to membership in the frater
nity.
