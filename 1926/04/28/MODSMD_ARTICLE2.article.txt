# D. L. WEBSTER WILL DESCRIBE METEORS FOR FACULTY CLUB

### 
Professor D. L. Webster of the
Physics department will speak on "The!
Meteor Crater of Arizona" at a meet
ing of the Faculty Research Club to
be held tonight in the Faculty Club
house at 8 o'clock.
The meteor crater of Arizona is a
•crater-like formation a little over
three-fourths of a mile in diameter,
located in the desert in Northern Ari
zona. It seems to have been made, ac
cording to Professor Webster, by the
impact of a large group or meteors or
by a small comet which struck the
ground at an angle of about forty-five
degrees.
The force of the meteor was so great
that it penetrated through almost half
a mile of solid rock. This is the only
crater of this kind which has been
found on the earth, but its resem
blance to the craters on the moon is
close enough to point to the conclu
sion that most of them were formed
by processes of the same kind.
