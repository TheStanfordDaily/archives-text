# James P. Busch Awarded Block "S" for Baseball
## 
### 
Due to an error made last week in
the Graduate Manager's Office the
i name of James P. Busch was left off
the list of men to be granted Block
"S" awards for competing in four and
: a half innings of the Stanford-Califor
| nia baseball series, or one-half of the
innings of the U.S.C. series.
This mistake was corrected yester
: day and a block "S" awarded to Busch
1 at the regular weekly meeting of the
i Executive Committee.
