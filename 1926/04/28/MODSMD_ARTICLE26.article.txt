# Yes, No Garage
## 
### 
If the number of replies to the questionnaire which was inserted in the
Daily is any indication, there is no need for a University garage on the
Stanford campus. Only sixteen coupons have been received; and, as was
pointed out in the first editorial on the subject, it would be necessary to
have at least 100 prospective patrons before the project could be given
consideration.
The negative result of the campaign has considerable significance for it
plainly demonstrates that, althoug the public is anxious to criticize and sug
gest, it is lethargic when given the opportunity to act. Before giving the
garage matter any publicity the editor consulted several auto owners and
found them in hearty accord with his scheme. Comptroller Roth was
sympathetic, yet dubious. He did not l>elieve that there would be 100
students willing to store their automobiles in the projected garage; how
ever, he was open to conviction, and supported the idea of a poll.
But when only sixteen automobile owners are sufficiently interested to
clip ouf a coupon and deposit it in the postoffice, little proof can be ad
vanced that a garage would be a self-supporting enterprise.
Still of the opinion that the building would be a welcome and patronized
institution, the editor will bring this campaign to an abrupt and unsuc
cessful close.
