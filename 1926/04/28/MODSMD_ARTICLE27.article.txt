# An Innovation
## 
### 
A new item of interest has been added to the summer quarter program
by John A. Sellards, Director of the summer session. Automobile excur
sions to near-by scenic points are being planned and will be put into oper
ation at the immediate start of the quarter.
The director has instituted an innovation that should prove quite popu
lar indeed. Hundreds of students on the campus during the months of
June to August are strangers to the Santa Clara valley and even Northern
California and inadvertently leave the campus without taking advantage
of the scenic beauties surrounding them. There are even those attending
during the winter who know little of the topography of the country out
side of Palm Drive and San Juan hill. Perhaps a number of them will be
able to participate in Mr. Sellards' plan. To do so will surely be to profit.
The itinerary planned includes such points of interest as Lick Observa
tory, where privileges usually unaccorded to individuals will be extended
to the University parties, to the Big Basin, a two-day trip to Carmel, Mon
terey, Del Monte, Pacific Grove, Santa Cruz, Half Moon Bay, and San
Francisco with its principal centers.
There was never a sight-seeing company with attractions such as these.

THE BIG TEN WEEKLY SAYS: It begins to look as though any
worry about America's winning the 1928 Olympic meet is unnecessary.
All the Olympic committee has to do is to keep the University of Southern
California and Stanford track teams in training for a couple of years.
