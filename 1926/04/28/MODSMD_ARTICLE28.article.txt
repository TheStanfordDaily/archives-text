Reservations for the Stanford Band
concert Friday evening may not be
made after today. Of the 750 seats in
the reserved section, more than 500
have already been assigned. The four
main sections at the back in the gal
lery will be reserved, as well as the
two main blocks of the lower floor.
To date more than twenty people,
two of whom are composers of note, j
have signified their intention of com
ing from Los Angeles for the concert, j
The band will play a march by one of
these men. E. R. Flint, composer of
the "Stanford Forever" march, will
also be present, to hear the interpreta-!
tion of this piece.
The band has been rehearsing every |
night this week for the concert. The
program will consist of a few classical
numbers and several lighter selections.
The concert will be opened by Franz
Schubert's "Overture Rosamunde."
This overture, composed before Schu
bert was twenty-one years of age, ;
was originally meant for a comic
opera, but instead has been used for
one of the heavier selections. It. whs
lirst played in 1817 at the Theatre
An L)er Wein in Berlin. The basses are

prominent in the piece and the six
Sousaphones of the band bring out the
leading part well.
In Part I of the program, along with
the overture, Claude L. McCue will
play a saxaphone solo, entitled "La
Somnambule," by Singelee. This piece
requires faster fingering on the saxo
phone than any piece yet written for
that particular instrument. Adin D.
Henderson will also play a violin solo
written by Jeno Hubay. C. L. McKin
stry, '25, will accompany him.
Richard Taylor, manager of the
band, will give an euphonium solo, a
"Fantasia on aria" from the opera
"Maritana" by Wallace-Round.
Two numbers of the second part are
Massenet's "Scenes Pttoresques" and
Sanfranec's "Atlantis Suite," the lat
â€¢ter being the finale of the evening.
"Scenes Pittoresques" is one of the
most celebrated of Massenet's works.
From this the band will play the
Marche and the Angelus. In the latter
movement chimes, which have been
brought down from San Francisco
especially for the affair, will be used
to represent the Bells of St. Mary's.
