CABBAGE OIL
Mike and Ike were two lads who lived on a farm. It was a big farm, all
of 5 acres, and the family possessed three cows, two pigs, and a Ford. Pa
used to bootleg on the side once in a while, but just the same, the old
homestead was mortgaged clean up to the smokestack on the roof.
Ike and Pa hoped to raise the mortgages soon by putting the farm in
Cabbages and sending them to Ireland, but Mike couldn't see the cabbages
or the farm either. He hated the place, and besides, he was darn tired of
chaperoning pigs and cows. So one fine day he upped and lit out, just like
that, leaving a short note of farewell which he hung on the brindle cow.
Five weary years have Charlestoned past. Mike had worked himself
through college and become a civil engineer. He was a howling success at
school, but outside, things didn't go so well. It was a cold, cold world. All
the railways and bridges in the country were built already, so what chance
had a poor C. E.? Ans., none at all. Mike was now washing dishes at Coffee
Dan's.
One day our hero thought he would journey home and give the poor
folks at the farm a treat. At least, he was better off than Ike, and could give
him and Pa the laugh.
So off he went in his one suit (he had hocked his overcoat long since to
pay the rent of his fifth floor back), all dolled up to give the town sheiks fits
of envy.
When he arrived at Jerkwater things didn't look the same to him; the
place had grown. Jerkwater had become a thriving metropolis. But, un
daunted, Mike hired a taxi and drove out to the ranch. He could still lord
it over Ike and Pa.
The driver stopped in front of a huge mansion. "Here you are, sir," he
said, "there's where your Pappy lives."
Mike looked at him. "Are you trying to be funny?" he said, suspiciously,
"because if you are, why ?"
"No sir, honest he liveß there. Ax anyone."
"Whaddye mean? My pop was as poor as a church mouse. Donl kid me!"
"Yessir, he was poor once," explained the driver, "but you see ,he made
a fortune on his cabbages—er—they made him rich."
"Cabbages make anyone rich?" howled Mike. "For two cents I'd "
"They made him rich, I said. He had 5 acres of them and he made a
fortune on them. I "
"Boy! Go slow, I'm warning you."
"They discovered five oil wells, one for each acre. Here comes your pap
now. Did you want to see him?"
"No," said Mike. "Take me back to the station. I just remembered
I left the water running in my bathtub."
Moral: So you see Little Boys and Girls of Cabbage Land, even the lowly
cabbage can turn into gold. Who knows but what some day we might find
oil in our own little patch of cabbages? Yea, WHO KNOWS? But then, we're
hopeful. Mayhap it will come some day—and so will Christmas.

school, but outside, things didn't go so well. It was a cold, cold world. All
the railways and bridges in the country were built already, so what chance
had a poor C. E.? Ans., none at all. Mike was now washing dishes at Coffee
Dan's.
One day our hero thought he would journey home and give the poor
folks at the farm a treat. At least, he was better off than Ike, and could give
him and Pa the laugh.
So off he went in his one suit (he had hocked his overcoat long since to
pay the rent of his fifth floor back), all dolled up to give the town sheiks fits
of envy.
When he arrived at Jerkwater things didn't look the same to him; the
place had grown. Jerkwater had become a thriving metropolis. But, un
daunted, Mike hired a taxi and drove out to the ranch. He could still lord
it over Ike and Pa.
The driver stopped in front of a huge mansion. "Here you are, sir," he
said, "there's where your Pappy lives."
Mike looked at him. "Are you trying to be funny?" he said, suspiciously,
"because if you are, why ?"
"No sir, honest he liveß there. Ax anyone."
"Whaddye mean? My pop was as poor as a church mouse. Donl kid me!"
"Yessir, he was poor once," explained the driver, "but you see ,he made
a fortune on his cabbages—er—they made him rich."
"Cabbages make anyone rich?" howled Mike. "For two cents I'd "
"They made him rich, I said. He had 5 acres of them and he made a
fortune on them. I "
"Boy! Go slow, I'm warning you."
"They discovered five oil wells, one for each acre. Here comes your pap
now. Did you want to see him?"
"No," said Mike. "Take me back to the station. I just remembered
I left the water running in my bathtub."
Moral: So you see Little Boys and Girls of Cabbage Land, even the lowly
cabbage can turn into gold. Who knows but what some day we might find
oil in our own little patch of cabbages? Yea, WHO KNOWS? But then, we're
hopeful. Mayhap it will come some day—and so will Christmas.

CABBAGE OIL
Mike and Ike were two lads who lived on a farm. It was a big farm, all
of 5 acres, and the family possessed three cows, two pigs, and a Ford. Pa
used to bootleg on the side once in a while, but just the same, the old
homestead was mortgaged clean up to the smokestack on the roof.
Ike and Pa hoped to raise the mortgages soon by putting the farm in
Cabbages and sending them to Ireland, but Mike couldn't see the cabbages
or the farm either. He hated the place, and besides, he was darn tired of
chaperoning pigs and cows. So one fine day he upped and lit out, just like
that, leaving a short note of farewell which he hung on the brindle cow.
Five weary years have Charlestoned past. Mike had worked himself
through college and become a civil engineer. He was a howling success at
school, but outside, things didn't go so well. It was a cold, cold world. All
the railways and bridges in the country were built already, so what chance
had a poor C. E.? Ans., none at all. Mike was now washing dishes at Coffee
