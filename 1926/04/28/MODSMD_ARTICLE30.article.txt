# SENIOR BECOMES DEMENTED FROM TRYING TO ANSWER QUESTIONNAIRE
## 
### 
Searching parties were still out at an early hour this morning scouring
the hills for John Milkwater who left the Women's Clubhouse last night in a
state of dementia five minutes after the senior questionnaire had been passed
out.
Members of the class when asked to account for Milkwat.er's sudden
lapse of rationality stated that the terrific nervous strain of answering the
questions truthfully might explain their classmate's condition. It was also
believed by some that the shock of being given an examination for which he
had not studied might have caused Milkwater to become insane. (He was a
member of Phi Beta Kappa.)
Prominent psychologists hold that the examination was above the intelli
gent e of the average senior since it contained questions that could not be
answered in the affirmative without exaggerating nor in the negative without
falsifying.
Witnesses who saw Milkwater leave the room quote his last words as
being: "I wouldn't care how many fields the examination covers as long as it
stayed in the open and kept away from the cactus gardens and the eight-mile
house."
