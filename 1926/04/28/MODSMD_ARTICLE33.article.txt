# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
I The Editor, Sir:
Will some brave (lisriple of honor
< societies please enlighten the Student
\ Body as to the how, when, why, and
what for of that honored body of men
, existing under the treacherous-sound
ing cognomen of "sCALPERS sO
| CIETY"?
1 have witnessed the evolution of
this honored body from its ameboid
stage to a great social monster as it
now exists with neither head, tail, nor
heart. I realize the vast amount of
! social prestige such an order casts
upon those lucky individuals who bask
! within its mystic shadows and the
i stigma of mediocrity that falls upon
I those not receiving that distinction
! and I am sure the Campus would be
I interested to know where, why, when,
j and how it originated, what things
j worthy of mention it has achieved
since its organization, and for what
I purpose and on what basis it now
| exists as an "honorary society" on the
j Stanford Campus.
