Stanford will meet the University of
Arizona polo four in a two-game tour
nament to be played here May G and 8,
according to Major Keliher, polo coach.
The squad of four will arrive on May
3, and spend the week in practice and
getting accustomed to the horses and
field of the University. During the
week, they will stay with the members
of the Stanford polo team at their
various houses.
The Arizona Wildcats are considered
to be one of the strongest polo aggre
gations in the West, and rank high in
the national field. Last year Stanford
was defeated by the Wildcat team.
During the same season, the Arizona
four defeated the New Mexico Military
Institute and the 10th Cavalry.
Polo Organized in 1922
Polo was organized in the University
of Arizona during the school year of
1922-23, by Lieutenant Colonel Ralph
Parker, Cavalry. Polo in its short ex
istence at the University has over
come many obstacles, and the teams
turned out have advanced to national
prominence.
In the intercollegiate tournament at
San Antonio, Texas, in the fall of 1923,
the Arizona team won the Southwest
ern Collegiate championship by de
feating teams from the Colorado Ag
gies, Texas Aggies, University of
Oklahoma, and New Mexico Military
Institute.
Prominent among the players at Ari
zona is Jemmie Hearon, considered by
Eastern sport writers as the "Great
est Collegian" in the game. He plays a
No. 2 position. Hearon shows excep
tional cleverness in his field general
ship, and handles the members of his
team well.
Saunders Is Star
Harry Saunders fills the No. 1 posi
tion. He is a hard-riding cowpuncher
from St. Johns, Arizona, and plays a
cool, consistent game. His earlier
training on horseback, and the fact
that he is a product of the range and
knows horses, makes him a heady

rider and an excellent No. 1 man.
Jimmie Schildman at No. 3 is a j
strong and accurate hitter, while Paul [
Sawyer, at No. 4 position, is a bulwark
on the defensive. He is one of the best
backs in the college game, and his
accurate backhand strokes are of ma
terial aid in preventing opponents' j
scores. Possible substitutes for any of t
these men are Ralph Austin and Jerry
Snyder, who can be depended upon to
take any position on the field.
Arizona's coach is Captain P. R. I
Upton, cavalry. Captain Upton carries 1
a two-goal handicap in the United 1
States Polo Association, Army Associ
ation Branch.
