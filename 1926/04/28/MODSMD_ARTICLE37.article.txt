# BASKETBALL INVENTED FOR WINTER INDOOR SPORT
## 
### Gordon French 
Basketball is the most modern of
the major sports which interest a great
many people. Unlike any other sport
it was deliberately invented at one
sitting instead of having a long period ;
of evolution like football and baseball..
Thirty-four years ago Dr. Naismith
of the International Y.M.C.A. Training
School at Springfield, Massachusetts,
wanted a game to be played indoors
to take the place in the winter time,
of football and baseball, so he struck
upon a crude form of present-day bas-.
ketball. At first the ball used was a
footbjfil, but this proved unsatisfac- J
tory and led to the adoption of the j
present form of the ball. Originally
peach baskets were used as goals, thus
giving the name to the game.
Spread Rapidly
This game rapidly spread with many
modifications throughout the Y.M.C.A.'s
of the country and finally a profes
sional game sprung up. The associa
tion's rules became very technical
while on the other hand the profes
sional game became very loosely gov
erned and degenerated into an ex
tremely rough sport. One of the favo
rite forms of the professional game
was played without any out-of-bounds,

I but instead the playing service was
surrounded by a net, thus originating
the term of "cage" game.
Rules Standardized
Within the first decade the colleges
took up the sport and the first league,
the Eastern Intercollegiate League,
- was formed in 1901, while the West
ern Conference started four years
later. During this time the Amateur
Athletic Union took up the sport and
helped spread it throughout the coun-
I try. Each of these organizations had
; its own rules so that a great deal
j of confusion arose. In order to remedy
the situation, in 1915 the three or
j ganizations had a joint meeting and
| adopted uniform rules which greatly
accelerated the progress of the sport.
The evolution of the game has
gradually made it the speediest one
now played. A premium has been
placed on quickness, alertness, and
shiftiness. At first the long passing
attack was usually used, but recently
the game has swung toward short,
snappy passing and pivoting. Still
more recently various combinations of
the two types have been evolved. Two
schools of teaching have arisen, the
compact five-man defense and the man
in-the-liole type which have both had
I great success.

School at Springfield, Massachusetts,
wanted a game to be played indoors
to take the place in the winter time,
of football and baseball, so he struck
upon a crude form of present-day bas-.
ketball. At first the ball used was a
footbjfil, but this proved unsatisfac- J
tory and led to the adoption of the j
present form of the ball. Originally
peach baskets were used as goals, thus
giving the name to the game.
Spread Rapidly
This game rapidly spread with many
modifications throughout the Y.M.C.A.'s
of the country and finally a profes
sional game sprung up. The associa
tion's rules became very technical
while on the other hand the profes
sional game became very loosely gov
erned and degenerated into an ex
tremely rough sport. One of the favo
rite forms of the professional game
was played without any out-of-bounds,

I but instead the playing service was
surrounded by a net, thus originating
the term of "cage" game.
Rules Standardized
Within the first decade the colleges
took up the sport and the first league,
the Eastern Intercollegiate League,
- was formed in 1901, while the West
ern Conference started four years
later. During this time the Amateur
Athletic Union took up the sport and
helped spread it throughout the coun-
I try. Each of these organizations had
; its own rules so that a great deal
j of confusion arose. In order to remedy
the situation, in 1915 the three or
j ganizations had a joint meeting and
| adopted uniform rules which greatly
accelerated the progress of the sport.
The evolution of the game has
gradually made it the speediest one
now played. A premium has been
placed on quickness, alertness, and
shiftiness. At first the long passing
attack was usually used, but recently
the game has swung toward short,
snappy passing and pivoting. Still
more recently various combinations of
the two types have been evolved. Two
schools of teaching have arisen, the
compact five-man defense and the man
in-the-liole type which have both had
I great success.
