## "When We Were Very Young" 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
This is the first of a series about famous athletes who did anything at all
worthy of comment when they were in their minority—the minor the better.
It is begun with the hope that Christopher Robin's father won't object to the
use of the title that brought him added fame.
When Bobby Jones was very young (he is now a veteran of 24), he was
so frail and sickly that a famous Southern physician actually said that he
had only four or five months to live. But young Mr. Jones fooled him, and in
1910 was winning a special children's golf tournament at the East Lake Club,
Atlanta. Two years later, when he was ten years old, Bob won a junior
tournament at the same club, and when he was thirteen he had broken par
by five strokes on a 6,464-yard course!
When Suzanne Lenglen was very young, her Dad decided that he would
make a world's tennis champion out of her, and instructed, trained, and
coached her accordingly. Hour after hour "Suzie" had to practice serving
at a spot on the court designated by Papa Lenglen's handkerchief, or batting
and rebatting tennis balls against a wall. But in 1914, at the age of 15, she
won the international hard court championship. She has won the Wimbledon
tournament every year since the war with the exception of 1924, when she
withdrew just before the finals.
When Young Stribling was "Very Young" Stribling, his parents, who were
traveling all over the world in vaudeville, trained him to be a boxing cham
pion. He met all comers (of his age) when he was seven, and did an act in
a minature ring with his kid brother. "W. L." could balance himself on one
foot when he was six months old. Now he is able to stand nearly all the
light-heavyweights in the world on their ears with a smack or two.
