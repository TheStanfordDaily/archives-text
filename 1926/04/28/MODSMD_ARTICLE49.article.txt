# SEQUOIA CLUB PLANS PIRATE SPORT DANCE
## 
### 
Sequoia Club is planning a Pirate
Dance which will be presented next
Saturday night at Sequoia Hall. Clever
lighting effects and novel favors are
promised by Burt McKim, chairman
of the social committee. The dance
will be a sport affair.
Decorations for the function are
being carried forth in connection with
the main pirate theme. The orchestra
will appear to play from the deck of a
brigantine, flying the Jolly Roger, and
sailing a heavy sea. The entrance to
the floor will be through a dark cave,
closely approximating the well-hidden
hangout of the famous Captain Kidd.

Ten awards, each accompanied by a
medal, are offered to graduates of
1926 classes by the College Art Asso
ciation of America. The first prize is
a traveling scholarship of $1250, the
second, a resident scholarship of $500,
and in addition eight honorable men
tions will be given.
