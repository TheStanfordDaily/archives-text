This meeting of Conference is usu
ally a resume of the work that has
been done in women's activities dur
ing the preceding year. A report of the
recent Western Collegiate Conference
at the Southern Branch will be given.
The proceeds of the dinner which
the Women's Clubhouse Board will
serve in the clubrooms preceding the
party will go toward paying off the
Clubhouse debt. It is the custom of
the Clubhouse Board to arrange din
ners before each quarter's Conference
party in order to raise funds to meet
the building debt.
Each women's living group agrees
to donate to the Clubhouse Board the
cost of its dinner for that evening.
Dinners will not be served in any of
the women's dining halls tomorrow.
If the spring quarter dinner is suc
cessful, the Board says, it will prob
ably be able to pay off the Clubhouse
debt this year.
