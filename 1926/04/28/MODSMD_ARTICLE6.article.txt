## 
### 
Leaving of chalk advertising on the
sidewalks for several days, or until it
wears off, will not be permitted, ac
cording to action taken by the Execu
tive Committee last night at the regu
lar weekly meeting.
The motion passed was as follows:
That all organizations be responsible
for all chalk advertising on the cam
pus, and see that it be removed on the
following day.
This action was similar to a stand
taken by the Executive Committee at
this time last year in regard to placing
posters to advertise shows, dances,
and the like, in improper places. Defi
nite places were named on which
posters must not be tacked and, while
this was not carried out in the chalk
advertising, the Committee expects
the organizations to use prudence in
putting out the chalk signs, and ex
pects them to be removed on the fol
lowing day.
The Committee feels that leaving the
signs is not only unsightly, and of
fensive, if left on the walks, but feels
also that confusion results by mixing
the out-of-date signs with newer ones.
