# DRIVE FOR PLEDGE CARDS TO CONTINUE WITH 1300 AS GOAL
## Committee Leaves Blanks at Bookstore; Tomorrow Closes Drive 
### 
Season ticket pledge cards for the
student body concert plan have been
placed in the Stanford Bookstore, and
may be obtained by all those who have
not yet signified their intention of
attending the six concerts which will i
be produced next year if sufficient sup
port is shown. Boxes on the Quad,
near the Law Steps, will contain cards
both today and tomorrow, which will
be the final opportunity to pledge at
tendance.
Every effort is being made to realize
the quota of 1300 pledges which was
decided upon as the minimum which
would insure the concerts. If tljis fig
ure is reached live contracts now
pending with prominent artists will
be signed, and Stanford will be as
sured of a notable musical season.
Three dollars has been fixed as the
season price for all six concerts. It
has been possible to set this low figure
because of the fact that the concerts
will be purely an A.S.S.U. enterprise,
the student body itself being the pro
ducers. The basketball pavilion, which
will be used as the auditorium for the
events, will seat five or six thousand
in easy seeing and hearing distance.
Its acoustics have been declared ex
cellent. Large numbers of people are
expected for each concert from Palo
Alto and towns on the Peninsula.
According to Robert E. Lewis, presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., the student body
should back the plan up to the fullest
extent. Each individual must realize,
he declared, that his pledge is neces
sary to save the project, for if the
required number are not obtained, the
plan will have to be abandoned.
