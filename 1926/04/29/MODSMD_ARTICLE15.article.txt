##

be raised locally, in Palo Alto, the
surrounding towns, and on the cam
pus. Last year $1000 was contributed
by the students, and at least that much
is expected this year. Lindsay Winter
botham has been appointed student
chairman of the Committee for the
drive.
Working with Winterbotham are
Leslie Gordon, William Fain, Louis

The money to be raised is to insure
a covering of the deficit of $1500 which
the Home had last year because of a
shortage in the Community Chest
drive. The total cost of operation of
the Home last year was $33,226.34, and
constituted 14,515 child days of ser
vice. The cost per child day was the
unusually low figure of $2.29. This was
made possible as a result of efficiency
and high occupancy, which 99.14 per
cent of the possible maximum of chil
dren who could be handled under the
budget and with the facilities at hand.
A complete canvass of the campus
will be made by the above committee
during the drive, and the committee is
desirous of having the various living
groups discuss the matter of contribu-1
tions.
