# STANFORD MEMBERS OF MOSHER FAMILY NOT AFTER FORTUNE
## 
### 
Members of the Mosher family at
Stanford will not file claims for their ,
share of the reputed $200,000,000 estate I
left by the will of William Mosier.
silk merchant of Manchester, England, i
in 1500>.
The would-be heirs on the campus |,
include Professor Charles Moser, of
the Civil Engineering department; Dr.,
Clelia Duel Mosher, Medical Advisor
of Women; Helen Elizabeth Mosher,
and Francis William Mosher, Jr. When ,
informed that Percy M. Williams, San
Francisco grocer, had prepared and;
forwarded his claim Monday for the ,
fortune, Dr. Mosher declared that al
though she was a direct descendant 1
of the English line of Moshers it would
be useless to attempt to secure any
| of the estate.
She traces her ancestry to the fam-
I ily of Moshers who arrived from Great
| Britain in 1637. Professor Moser ex- i
j plained that his ancestors emigrated ;
! from Switzerland to the United States j
and are distant relatives of the Eng- j
lish family.
Although Miss Mosher's family has
lived in this country since before the
Revolution, she believes that any at-!
: tempt to obtain her share of the money j
! will be futile. Francis Mosher stated
j that his prospects of receiving any J
| part of the estate are so slight that he
j has only a gambling chance. He does
; n't expect to file any claim in the near i
! future.
Francis Mosher traces his ancestry
i from the Scotch branch of the family
! which settled in Nova Scotia during
the latter years of the seventeenth cen-
I tury. According to the letter received
j by the San Francisco claimant, E. V.
j Straight, Milwaukee attorney, will
journey to England in order to press
claims for members of the family this
will not be the first attempt made to
! secure the fortune,
