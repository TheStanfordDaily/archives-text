# FREHE SEEKING CLUE TO HEFT OF WIRE CABLE
## Loss Discovered Tuesday; Ton of Material Used For Testing Taken VALUE IS SET AT $750 Necessitates Repetition of Experiments Conducted For Three Years 
### 
Deputy Sheriff Fred Frehe, head of
the campus police force, is working on
a clue as to the identity ot" the thief
who stole 2470 pounds of valuable
copper and aluminum testing cable
which was being used in electrical ex
periments conducted by Professor
Ryan and his assistants. It was taken
from the high tension laboratory in
front of the Roble gymnasium.
The theft was discovered Tuesday,
and had evidently occurred within the
last rains, as the ground where the
cable had lain had not been rained on
recently. Iron clamps and other attach
ments not wanted had been removed
and left on the ground nearby.
The cable was valued at approxi
mately $750, but the principal loss is
in the fact that an experiment was
under way to discover the effects of
weathering, the atmospheric pressure
on such types of power cable, and the
relative amount of voltage lost after
such weathering processes had been
at work. The experiments have been
carried on over a period of three years,
and that part of them which affected
the stolen cable will have to be started
over again. The most valuable cable
was on top of the electrical tower, and
could not be removed by the thief.
Protection of the cable had been
thought to be ample, according to Pro
fessor Ryan, as the plant is surrounded
by a high wire fence, and the cable is
so heavy as to require a truck to re
move it. Furthermore, the location of
the Laboratory is such as to preclude
any thief working for very long un
molested. The copper cable, which
comprised 2127 pounds of the amount
taken, belonged to the city of Los
Angeles, and had been loaned to tho
University. The aluminum cable was
the gift of the Great Western Power
Company.
