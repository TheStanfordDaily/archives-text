# EIGHTY PLAYERS TO MAKE APPEARANCE IN FIRST CONCERT
## 
### 
Stanford's band, which will be heard
in its concert at 8 o'clock tomorrow
night, is one of the largest and most
complete bands the University has
ever had. Eighty men will play, and
every type of band instrument will be
used.
Tomorrow's concert will be the first
one given in the Assembly hall by
the band for a number of years, and
will be the initial appearance of the
organization this year in concert work.
The bands before the World War
seldom had more than forty men.
Through the efforts of Professor E. W.
Martin, who took charge of the band
in 1914, the band has doubled in size.
During the years immediately pre
ceding the outbreak of the war it was
the custom of the band to give a con
cert every two weeks either at the
corner of the Engineering building or
under the old oak which stands in
front of the library. Concerts ceased
during the war, but they were later
continued at irregular intervals in the
court of the New Union or in the
Band Shell at Lake Lagunita.
