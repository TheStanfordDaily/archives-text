# The
						Survival of the Honest

From publications which are received in the Daily office, we gather
that the Honor System is not meeting with success in some American uni
versities. A recent compilation in the New Student indicates that, if two
mythical teams were formed, the Pacific Coast would be defending the
system, with the Middle West as the opposing force. Quite flattering to
westerners.
But our elation has been endangered. Reports that have been circu
lating on the campus point out that all is not as it should be.
From a sponsor we learn that the present freshman class, or at least
an appreciable portion of it, is not fully aware of the significance of the
Honor System. And other reports indicate that the men who are here
for their first year are not the inly offenders. Perhaps too much time has
been devoted to the discussion of trivial traditions and not enough to one
cf the most important and basic ones.
The Honor System places every student on his "own." The profes
sor must leave the examination room, and he should be confident that no
student will seek outside aid in the writing of his paper. The responsi
bility theoretically rests entirely with the individual. Only an out-and-out
idealist could believe that in a community of 3000 there were none in
clined to be dishonest; so the Men's Council possesses the power to judge
and punish those who have not adhered to the established principles.
However, there are not many who care to report misdoers. From
childhood all have carried an instinctive hatred for the "snitch-baby."
But saner logic can be applied. We are working for diplomas on a
competitive basis; and each quarter students are eliminated from the con
test. Perhaps some of the eliminated would have retained their standing
had not a cheater unfairly boosted the class and University average.
There is no need to play the spy; but let's make sure that every Stan
ford A.B. is earned and that only the "honest survive."
