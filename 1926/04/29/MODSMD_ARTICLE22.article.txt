# The 						Adventure of Education
## 
### 
The transition from China to the United States and back to China again
was one of the most interesting phases of the lecture yesterday by Presi
dent Mary E. Woolley, of Mount Ilolyoke College. "Education as an
Adventure," was Miss Woolley's topic and the sidelights on Chinese edu
cation were in themselves effective illustrations of education as an adven
ture. As she expressed it yesterday, "The recent revolution in China is
fully as much a revolution of the mind as of government. China is in the
midst of a Renaissance with its movement for New Thought, and the
younger generation has never been more absorbed in an occupation than
in the interesting details of this new aventure —Education."
There is little room here for a critical discussion of Education per se,
its value, or its limitations; but one cannot help believe that the offerings of
the present system of learning are something to be highly regarded and
taken as something valuable in the life of the first generation. But is there
the proper appreciation of these offerings? We of the University and of
the younger generation are so often backed in a corner and asked why we
have no suitable appreciation of the opportunities given for intellectual;
improvements that the question has become tiresome; which in no whit
detracts from the truth of its answer—"No."
Now the young Chinaman, Miss Woolley has stated, is all absorbed in
his new pursuit. Perhaps the young American has grown stale and no
longer sees a pleasurable occupation in University attendance —which is
certainly not to his credit. Education in the present decade means no more
to him than a suit of clothing, something to be displayed to the world
around him. There is little thought of education for the "Adventure' in
it, education to be worked with and thought over, education to be treasured
for its inherent value and pleasure.
There are few who realize that Man has been intrusted with a faculty
which it is his duty to prize and improve—the human mind. It is a garden
which is to be cultivated and watched over with a joy in seeing it produce.
It is a valuable possession—not an attribute to be displayed. None of us
have gone the full limit or done everything possible with this possession,
and it is a fact to regret and at which to marvel at the same time.
WITH ONLY 600 PLEDGES signed out of a necessary 1300, pros
pects are slightly cloudy for the proposed series of concerts which were to
bring to Stanford next year some of the world's foremost proponents of
music. *
All that is required to make this scries of concerts a reality is a pledge
by 1300 people to pay fifty cents for each concert. Yet only 600 of these
pledges are returned in the first count.
Really, it makes one believe that there are some people who wouldn't
give a nickel to see St. Peter pitch for the Giants.

younger generation has never been more absorbed in an occupation than
in the interesting details of this new aventure —Education."
There is little room here for a critical discussion of Education per se,
its value, or its limitations; but one cannot help believe that the offerings of
the present system of learning are something to be highly regarded and
taken as something valuable in the life of the first generation. But is there
the proper appreciation of these offerings? We of the University and of
the younger generation are so often backed in a corner and asked why we
have no suitable appreciation of the opportunities given for intellectual;
improvements that the question has become tiresome; which in no whit
detracts from the truth of its answer—"No."
Now the young Chinaman, Miss Woolley has stated, is all absorbed in
his new pursuit. Perhaps the young American has grown stale and no
longer sees a pleasurable occupation in University attendance —which is
certainly not to his credit. Education in the present decade means no more
to him than a suit of clothing, something to be displayed to the world
around him. There is little thought of education for the "Adventure' in
it, education to be worked with and thought over, education to be treasured
for its inherent value and pleasure.
There are few who realize that Man has been intrusted with a faculty
which it is his duty to prize and improve—the human mind. It is a garden
which is to be cultivated and watched over with a joy in seeing it produce.
It is a valuable possession—not an attribute to be displayed. None of us
have gone the full limit or done everything possible with this possession,
and it is a fact to regret and at which to marvel at the same time.
WITH ONLY 600 PLEDGES signed out of a necessary 1300, pros
pects are slightly cloudy for the proposed series of concerts which were to
bring to Stanford next year some of the world's foremost proponents of
music. *
All that is required to make this scries of concerts a reality is a pledge
by 1300 people to pay fifty cents for each concert. Yet only 600 of these
pledges are returned in the first count.
Really, it makes one believe that there are some people who wouldn't
give a nickel to see St. Peter pitch for the Giants.
The transition from China to the United States and back to China again
was one of the most interesting phases of the lecture yesterday by Presi
dent Mary E. Woolley, of Mount Ilolyoke College. "Education as an
Adventure," was Miss Woolley's topic and the sidelights on Chinese edu
cation were in themselves effective illustrations of education as an adven
ture. As she expressed it yesterday, "The recent revolution in China is
fully as much a revolution of the mind as of government. China is in the
midst of a Renaissance with its movement for New Thought, and the
younger generation has never been more absorbed in an occupation than
in the interesting details of this new aventure —Education."
