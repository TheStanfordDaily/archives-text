THE INSIDIOUS THING
(Man kidnaps girl; then lets her go—News Item.)
Our little Rosa Pocolo went tripping down the street;
From school she came, and little Rose was looking mighty sweet.
Our Rosa was a buxom lass of sixteen happy years,
Her fact wa soften wreathed with smiles, and never streaked with tears.
A prettier girl could not be found on Twenty-Fourth Street, West;
Full many a heart of many a lad beat quick 'neath many a vest.
And so, as Rosa walked along this bright and lovely day.
She lined her seven admirers up and marshalled the array.
"There's Tony—he's a funny guy, but he has lots of dough! —
And Louis —he is handsome, too, and not so very slow!
"And Andre —such a loving tone he gets into his voice—"
And Joe, Ignatius, Carlo, Pete —she couldn't make her choice.
Her mind was filled with thoughts like these when to the curb a Ford
Drove up, a man leaned out and said, "Hey, Rosa, get aboard?
"I'm heading for your Papa's shop to get my Lizzie fixed,
Hop in, I'll get you there as quick as drinks were ever mixed."
So foolish Rosa got inside, because she thought he knew
Her Papa—and the man was nice!—then down the street they flew.
Right past her house without a stop the fellow drove his car,
When she protested, he declared they wasn't goin' far.
But still he drove, and Rosa knew kidnapping was his game!
But what could Rosa do? She was a helpless little dame.
They drove out past the City Park and then into the hills,
While up and down poor Rosa's back there traveled icy chills.
At last she felt she had a plan to make the crook forget
His kidnapping, and so she said, "Say, listen, do you pet?"
Well, kerosene on blazing fire does just the work this did,
He stopped the car, and turning, said, "Huh, do I? Watch me, kid!"
He stooped to steal a little kiss, then, with a look of pain,
Sat up, and opening wide the door, said, "You're a loss, no gain!"
And then she stepped out on the ground and started walking home,
And he drove off the other way, his face a pasty chrome.
How was it that the maid escaped? Don't tell me you are green!
It isn't always best to drink your morning Listerine. —L.A.B

Her mind was filled with thoughts like these when to the curb a Ford
Drove up, a man leaned out and said, "Hey, Rosa, get aboard?
"I'm heading for your Papa's shop to get my Lizzie fixed,
Hop in, I'll get you there as quick as drinks were ever mixed."
So foolish Rosa got inside, because she thought he knew
Her Papa—and the man was nice!—then down the street they flew.
Right past her house without a stop the fellow drove his car,
When she protested, he declared they wasn't goin' far.
But still he drove, and Rosa knew kidnapping was his game!
But what could Rosa do? She was a helpless little dame.
They drove out past the City Park and then into the hills,
While up and down poor Rosa's back there traveled icy chills.
At last she felt she had a plan to make the crook forget
His kidnapping, and so she said, "Say, listen, do you pet?"
Well, kerosene on blazing fire does just the work this did,
He stopped the car, and turning, said, "Huh, do I? Watch me, kid!"
He stooped to steal a little kiss, then, with a look of pain,
Sat up, and opening wide the door, said, "You're a loss, no gain!"
And then she stepped out on the ground and started walking home,
And he drove off the other way, his face a pasty chrome.
How was it that the maid escaped? Don't tell me you are green!
It isn't always best to drink your morning Listerine. —L.A.B
