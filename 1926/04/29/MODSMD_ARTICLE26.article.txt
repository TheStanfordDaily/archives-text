# WARNER MAINTAINS TWO-MILE RUNNERS DEVELOP ENDURANCE
## 
### 
"College sports are maintained pri
marily for the benefit to be derived
therefrom by those who participate in
them," states Glenn S. Warner, Stan
ford football coach, who criticizes the
view commonly taken by the public
and sports writers that university ath
letic activities exist solely for the en
tertainment of spectators.
Warner advances his opinion in
reply to the criticism that the two-mile
run should be eliminated from college
track-meet programs because the event
is uninteresting to spectators. The
Stanford mentor maintains that the
list of track and field events on a
college program is made up to provide
a sufficient variety so that every stu
dent can become proficient in at least
one of the events. To this end the
weight events are designed for men
of strength, the sprints for men capa
ble of speed but no endurance, and
the distance runs for students who,
although incapable of great speed,
possess endurance.
Answering the view that, the dis
tance run is physically hard on the
entrant, Warner contrasts this race
with the four-mile crew event in which
the college crew is required to keep
up sustained strenuous labor for a
twenty-minute period. Warner's twelve
years' experience as track coach at
Carlisle affords a basis for the further
statement that the two-mile run is no
more strenuous than the mile, the half,
or the quarter.
In addition, Warner states that he
has nevec heard a single advocate for
the races' discontinuance until he
came to the Pacific Coast. Western
athletes are credited with slower times
and less competition because they do
not train as faithfully as the runners
in the East.
