## 
### G. W 
Another piece of professional Btage
craft has been added to Stanford dra
matic institutions in the production of
"Ride a Cook Horse," the Junior Opera
to be presented in the Assembly hall
May 7 and 8, in the addition of an
assistant director to the production
staff. The professional stage has long
recognized that the complexities and
innumerable details of a musical com
edy cannot all be handled by one di
rector-in-chief; and Charles Parks also
took this into account in the selection
of Leonard Schwartz to assist him in
the presentation of "Ride a Cock
Horse."
Both Parks and Schwartz are well
known to those who follow campus
dramatics. The former, since his ini
tial appearance in "If I Were King"
in 1922, has taken part in many of the
most successful productions of the
past four years, among them being
"Milestones," "R.U.R.," "You and I,"
"Polly With a Past," "Dear Brutus,"
and "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys." His pre
vious experience in the line of direct
ing was secured last year when he
took over the casting and preliminary

direction of "Polly With a Past," the |
1925 senior class presentation.
Schwartz has likewise had consider
able experience on the Assembly hall
stage. Making his debut in "Dulcy,"
the sophomore play of 1924, he has
since taken part in "You and I," "Polly
With a Past," "The Goose Hangs
High," and "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys."
The music, chorus, and technical di
rection of "Ride a Cock Horse" is to j
be in the same hands as have handled
these phases of the two other musical
shows presented this year. Chrysella
Kiler is developing a number of dances
and specialties which, owing to the i
period of the production, that of Eng-!
land of the early Nineteenth century, |
will be of a type new to the campus.;
Under the direction of Leslie Kiler I
ambitious settings in the atmosphere !
of the play are in process of construc- 1
tion. With all the original music which ;
will constitute the score of "Ride a I
Cock Horse" in the hands of the or-!
chestrator, John Wiggin, musical di
rector, is entering upon the last phase
of his work, that of drilling the orches- \
tra and choruses for the production. |

able experience on the Assembly hall
stage. Making his debut in "Dulcy,"
the sophomore play of 1924, he has
since taken part in "You and I," "Polly
With a Past," "The Goose Hangs
High," and "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys."
The music, chorus, and technical di
rection of "Ride a Cock Horse" is to j
be in the same hands as have handled
these phases of the two other musical
shows presented this year. Chrysella
Kiler is developing a number of dances
and specialties which, owing to the i
period of the production, that of Eng-!
land of the early Nineteenth century, |
will be of a type new to the campus.;
Under the direction of Leslie Kiler I
ambitious settings in the atmosphere !
of the play are in process of construc- 1
tion. With all the original music which ;
will constitute the score of "Ride a I
Cock Horse" in the hands of the or-!
chestrator, John Wiggin, musical di
rector, is entering upon the last phase
of his work, that of drilling the orches- \
tra and choruses for the production. |
