## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
April 28. â€”The addition of a plot of
land ten acres in size bordering on the
land of the new university dormi
tories, will give Wisconsin one of the
finest intramural athletic fields in the
country. The land will be made into
baseball diamonds for the spring part
of the program and will serve a great
er purpose for football in the fall.
The extension of slch a program on
the neighborhood of Samp Randall
will tend to center the entire Badger
athletic program away from the lower
campus; With the dormitories on the
verge of completion, it means the
growth of a new center for Cardinal
athletics and an extension that should
carry them out of the business district
of the city. Another factor that will
make this the real center of Wiscon
sin warriors is the fast-growing impe
tus for the field house and the sanction
of the regents to a location just across
the street from the new intramural
field.
The O.A.C. board of control is being
petitioned to put golf on the list of
minor sports.
