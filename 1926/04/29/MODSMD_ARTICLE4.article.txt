# STANFORD SWIMMING TEAM TO ENCOUNTER SAN JOSE ALUMNI
## Loss of Williams, O'Connor, Allen Weakens Power Of Cardinal Squad 
### 
Stanford swimmers will take part!
in the first competition since their j
trip East when they meet the San j
Jose alumni team tomorrow night in '
San Jose. In response to the request j
of alumni swimmers, Coach Brandsten
has agreed to omit diving from the list j
of events to be counted in the final
point score, but Dave Fall will do some
exhibition diving.
A victory is expected by the Cards,
although they are weakened this quar-1
ter by the loss of Bob Williams in the
sprints, Arden Allen in the breast
stroke, and Wally O'Connor in all;
; the free-style events. Of the men who :
! won second place for Stanford at the j
I National Intercollegiate Champion-
I ships at Annapolis last month, only
I Carl Stevenson will be competing to
morrow night. He will swim the 220-
1 yard free style and probably the 100
! also. Stevenson will have things all his
j own way in the furlong and may set a
! new tank record.
j In the 50-vard free style Brandsten
j plans to swim Bob Harris, who has
! been making 26 seconds and better
| consistently. He should make about
I :25 2-5 tomorrow night. Phil Brooks
i will probably also swim in this event.
In the 100-yard dash the Cardinal
; hopes will be pinned on Kryne van
; Den Akker, who this week made the
i surprising time of :68 2-5 for the cen
tury. Bill Danford, who has in the
j past been swimming the sprints, will
| be Stevenson's partner in the 220. He
has done under 2:39 in this race.
Ted Smith is expected to defeat the
San Jose swimmers in the 100-yard
backstroke. Smith has been steadily
I improving during the past quarter and
now swims consistently around 1:12,
| which is two-fifths of a second under
| the Stanford California record. Second
I man in the backstroke will probably
| be Phil Brooks.
Herb Klein will be entered in the
i 100-yard breaststroke race, since Wag
ner, who took first place in that event,
against California, will not be able to
enter the meet. Willis, the San Jose
breaststroker, is the outstanding swim
mer of the team, and has made the 100
yards in 1:15. Ted Smith will also
i swim in this race, if the order of
jevents can be arranged so that the
| breaststroke will not come imrnedi-
I ately before the backstroke.
