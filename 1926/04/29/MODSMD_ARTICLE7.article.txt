# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY DISPLAYS DERISIVE PICTURE POSTCARDS
## 
### 
Derisive picture postcards, thrusting
jibes respectively at the Allies and the
Central Powers in the Great War, and
issued by German and Russian firms,
were placed on exhibit in the Hoover
Wat* Library showcase recently.
Among the German cards are many
that have the Russian Empire as their
especial butt.
One of these is a picture of a chess
game, in which von Hindenburg. guid
ed by the Kaiser who is standing be
hind him, has just placed Russia's
king ni check. Behind the Russian
general are grouped the other Allies,
Italy, Great Britain, and France. Each
of the figures is the portrait of the
leader of his country's forces. The
Allies are shown as frigtened to death,
while the German is grasping his
piece ferociously, and has just knocked
several other pieces to the ground.
"On to Berlin," the Allies' famous
war-cry, is ridiculed by the Germans
in a card that shows the prison gang.
The Allied soldiers, shackled, are
headed toward Berlin, with heavily
armed German soldiers prodding them
on.
Russia replied to these and other
cards of the same type with similar
jibos. "The Juggler," a colored card, is
a picture of the traditional "Heinle,"
with a long sabre dangling at his side,
sitting on top of a world labelled "Ger
nmnia." The world, in turn, is balanced
at the mouth of a cannon-barrel that is
up-ended on the handle of a coffee pot.
