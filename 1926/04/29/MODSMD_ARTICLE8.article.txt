The Dekes suffered an 8 to 2 defeat
yesterday when the Phi Delt nine suc
ceeded in outplaying them in every de
partment of the game. The contest
was more closely played than the
score would indicate, and resulted in
good fielding and hitting.
The Phi Delts got away with Ack
ley's pitching in the very first inning
to bring in four runs. The first four
men in the lineup—David, Bryant,
Snyde, and McHose —crossed the plate
before the pitcher could stem the tide.
Clever stealing and an error by Nolan,
Deke catcher, helped along the scor
ing.
Snyde pulled the surprise of the
game when he slammed out a homer
in the third with two men on bases.
Bryant made the eighth tun in the
fifth when he was brought in by a
three-base hit of Snyde.
Dekes Get Two Hits
The Dekes made great efforts to
overcome the Phi Delt lead, but were
able to score only two hits. Their two
runs were brought in by Ackley and
Fuller in the second inning.
Th'e pitching favored Reynolds of
the Phi Delts, though the total number
of strikeouts and walks were identical
for both twirlers. Fielding was like
wise good with both teams.
The slugging baseball artists of El
Tigre found Pabst, Phi Ps.i pitcher, for
countless telling hits, ank this advan
tage, added to the strong mound work
of their own twirler, Hunter, enabled
them to win, 11-0. Yesterday's was the
first game played by El Tigre in the
intramural series, its previous con
tests having been won by default.
In the fourth inning Thompson, El
Tigre, went to first on a scratch hit,
and Stockbridge knocked him in with
a pretty triple, Taylor then walked to
the plate and hit a sizzling double. |
James Prisinzano walked, and Linne
man and Sanborn struck out. G. Prisin
zano then batted a three-bagger, scor
ing his brother and Taylor, and on an
error reached home. Pabst walked
Brown, and Hunter then drove the
ball into a neighboring backstop for I
and undisputed home run.
Bat Twice in Inning
The ball was losing its cover by
this time, but Thompson and Stock- j
bridge both hit, the latter for the
second time that inning, and were
driven in by Taylor's double. Jim
Prisinzano ended the orgy with a
strikeout. The latter, along with Stock
bridge, scored again in the sixth on
Linneman's hit.
Beard, Phi Psi third baseman, made j
a spectatcular play in the fourth, when
he went after Linneman's foul fiy. He
ran through the tall grass and, upon
catching the ball, performed a com- j

plete cartwheel across a ditch at the
edge of the diamond.
Sequoia I effectively trimmed a hast
ily-gathered Encina V nine, 8-3. Mack
pitched for the victors, while Holt was
in the box for the freshmen. McKenna,
McCuen, Noack, Cramer, Mack, and
Newland brought in runs for Sequoia
in the third, piling up the winning
lead. The game was shortened to four
and one-half innings because of a late
start.

The Dekes suffered an 8 to 2 defeat
yesterday when the Phi Delt nine suc
ceeded in outplaying them in every de
partment of the game. The contest
was more closely played than the
score would indicate, and resulted in
good fielding and hitting.
The Phi Delts got away with Ack
ley's pitching in the very first inning
to bring in four runs. The first four
men in the lineup—David, Bryant,
Snyde, and McHose —crossed the plate
before the pitcher could stem the tide.
Clever stealing and an error by Nolan,
Deke catcher, helped along the scor
ing.
Snyde pulled the surprise of the
game when he slammed out a homer
in the third with two men on bases.
Bryant made the eighth tun in the
fifth when he was brought in by a
three-base hit of Snyde.
Dekes Get Two Hits
The Dekes made great efforts to
overcome the Phi Delt lead, but were
able to score only two hits. Their two
runs were brought in by Ackley and
Fuller in the second inning.
Th'e pitching favored Reynolds of
the Phi Delts, though the total number
of strikeouts and walks were identical
for both twirlers. Fielding was like
wise good with both teams.
The slugging baseball artists of El
Tigre found Pabst, Phi Ps.i pitcher, for
countless telling hits, ank this advan
tage, added to the strong mound work
of their own twirler, Hunter, enabled
them to win, 11-0. Yesterday's was the
first game played by El Tigre in the
intramural series, its previous con
tests having been won by default.
In the fourth inning Thompson, El
Tigre, went to first on a scratch hit,
and Stockbridge knocked him in with
a pretty triple, Taylor then walked to
the plate and hit a sizzling double. |
James Prisinzano walked, and Linne
man and Sanborn struck out. G. Prisin
zano then batted a three-bagger, scor
ing his brother and Taylor, and on an
error reached home. Pabst walked
Brown, and Hunter then drove the
ball into a neighboring backstop for I
and undisputed home run.
