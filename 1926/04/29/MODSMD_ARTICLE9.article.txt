Plans for the next issue of Chaparral
| having been suddenly changed by
what he has described as "a most un
; fortunate concatenation of circum
j stances," the Old Boy of the University

ito his lips and issued a clarion call
j for funny, humorous, amusing, laugh
j able, comical, and other kinds of ma
j terial with which to fill the blank
i pages of the May number of Chaparral.
The new issue will have for its gen
eral theme satire upon modernist ten
j dencies in the fields of art, literature,
! and science, it was announced follow
ing a meeting of the editorial staff of
the comic yesterday afternoon. It is
: expected that all phases of the Intelli
gentsia and things intelligent are to be
ridiculed.
In giving advice to young writers,
the Old Boy outlined more fully what
is desired for the forthcoming issue.
| lie said that he had suffered enough
; from the "holier than thou" attitude
on the part of those who had by devi
i ous means acquired culture, under
, standing, and savoir faire, and that
now all modernist tendencies such as
| cubist art, free verse, psycho'-analysis,
I et al, are to be held up to the ridicule
of the world.
The scheduled combination issue of
| Chaparral and the Dartmouth Jac.k-O-
