## Sigma Nu Squelched by El Toro Aggregation in Five Innings FRYE'S HIT BREAKS TIE El Campo Nine Plays Like Champions in Encina Basement Game 
### 
Phi Kappa Sigma 3, Breakers 1
El Campo 22, Encina Basement 3
El Toro 10, Sigma Nu 1
A two-base hit slugged out by Frye
won a 3-1 victory for the Phi Kapps
yesterday in their game with Breakers.
Frye's hit in the fourth brought in
Kay and Connolly and broke a one to
one tie.
The game was usual in respect to
poor batting, but unusual in regard to
the excellent fielding displayed on
both sides, and particularly in the
infield work of the winning Phi Kapps.
McColloch outdid himself at short by
stopping all of ten balls without a
single error. Frye likewise showed up
strong at first.
The pitching was about a toss-up
between George of the Breakers and
Wright of the Phi Kappa Sigma squad.
The latter came through well in the
seventh when, with two men on bases,
lie fanned two Breakers and put a
third out on a fly. Very few hits were
scored by either side.
Campo Runs Wild
El Campo had no chance to look
like the champions they are in their
game with Encina Basement, the score
of which was 22-3. They merely went
to bat, hit at the first good ball offered,
if any, and made their way around
the circuit for a total of twenty-two
weary trips. This was exciting at first,
but later on it became tiresome, and
hitting was so much the exception
rather than the rule that only the out
standing performances need be men
tioned.
In the fourth inning, when El Campo
scored eight runs, bringing the total
to sixteen, Smith scored two runs,
making his total for the day four tal
lies in five times at bat. Ross likewise
<1 id exceptional stick work, with three
runs in four times at bat. Britten,
Lentz, and Gardiner all scored three
runs during the rout.
McKeown pitched for the losers, but
lie was not at all well supported by
his catcher, Carlson, and many bases
were stolen through the latter's loose
catching. Tillison, with two, and
Thornton, with one, accounted for the
freshman team's three tallies.
The game consumed about two hours
and forty minutes, six and one-half
innings being played
El Toro squelched Sigma Nu, 10-1, in
five innings of play. Busch pitched
for the winners and completely baffled
his opponents, allowing but three hits
and donating but two walks. Hem
merslev scored the sole Sigma Nu run
in the fourth when Murphy brought
him in with a single.
Dyer occupied the box for the fra
ternity nine and was hit frequently.
Crever, right field, and Sutro, first
base, each scored three runs in three
times at bat.
