Alan Herrington, varsity letterman,
and Phil Neer, former Stanford var
sity captain, were the sensations of
the first-day matches in the thirteenth
annual Ojai Valley tennis champion
ships.
In a fast contest, Herrington, at
present second ranking player on the
Cardinal varsity squad, defeated Wil
kinson of the San Diego State College,
in straight sets, 6-0, 6-3. He is today
in the third round of the intercollegiate
singles championship, and will prob
ably face Norval Craig, Occidental
star, in the finals.
Neer scored a brilliant victory over
Erick Franzackerly of the University
of Southern California in the men's
open singles. His stinging drives and
fast service enabled him to hand his
opponent a beating, 6-1, 6-3. Harvey
Snodgrass, 1025 clay court champion,
is the likely rival who will meet Neer
in the finals of the tournament.
