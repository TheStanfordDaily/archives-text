# DR. JORDAN GIVES VIEWS ON RELIGION IN LECTURE
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan traced the
history of the religious development
of mankind from the days of the
prophets to the present time in an
allegory of "The Innumerable Com
pany." This was the subject of the
regular Thursday night lecture given
by Dr. Jordan last night. He will
speak on Luther Burbank next week.
The talk unfolded the religion of
David Starr Jordan. The story began
with the discovery of a chart which
directed people to "a land of beautiful
mists, and a river, across which was
an everlasting happiness and rest."
Prophets led the early travels and un
veiled the meaning of the chart and
directed the "innumerable company"
through the wilderness.
Follow Prophets Blindly
But many charts were developed by
this means instead of the people stay
ing with the original charts that were
the correct ones. The people followed
the prophets blindly, and the leader
held his staff aloft as he walked be
fore them, so that its shadow was cast
over the purple mists of the valley
before them. But as the day grew, the
hot sun poured down, the mists
cleared, and a dry, arid desert spread
before the people.
"The people demanded a sign, as
they became restless, and so the lead
er held aloft the staff, but instead of
the broad shadow on the mists, there
was only a thin white line in the
desert dusts, and the white banners
were soiled.
"Then came the desire of the peo
ple to help one another by bringing
water for their children and by pour
ing oil on the wounds of the afflicted.
This only led to more evil than good,
though, for the children got used to

having water and refused to get it
themselves, and the sick lay übed all
day and the others had to wait upon
them.
"People began to believe that they
should obey the words of the prophets
and of the charts to the very letter.
They became distrustful of each other.
Oftentimes obedience was gotten only
at the point of the sword. 111-feeling
sprang up and those who deviated
from the charts were punished."
The allegory was continued on down
through th<j pages of history, through
the development of different ideas,
through the growth of new thoughts
on religion.
"This is the story of religion as I
believe in it," said Dr. Jordan, as he
brought his lecture to a close. "The
incidents in the journey are well
known to history—the 'Thirty Years
War," the war on indulgences and the
Protestant Revolution—are all the
various ways by which men have
sought the land beyond the river,
where all men must go, one by one.
Non-Essentials Discarded
"As the time passed by, people be
gan to realize more and more what the
charts really were, and to think less
of the 'interpretations.' The non-essen
tials are being wiped away and what
isn't true is being discarded.
"We may look back to the old charts
and find much of the beautiful in them.
While I do not believe in the cos
mology and astronomy of the Old Tes
tament, I have a great dislike for those
who sneer at it, for they cannot under
stand its real beauty and honesty.
"I find nothing in the old charts
about 'power and glory forever," for
these are nothing to a God who has
no end and no beginning.
