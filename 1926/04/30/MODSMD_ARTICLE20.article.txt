# EATING CLUBS STAGE TERRIFIC BATTLE BUT SPONSORS QUELL MOB
## 
### 
One loaf of bread started the
annual inter-club water fight last
night when members of the
Breakers and El Toro eating
clubs treated each other to a
shower bath, and attempted to
show how water gladiators should
act.
The baker's pride was bounced
off the head of a Breaker by a
rival before dinner. Truce was
called until after the meal. Break
ers finished eating first and
launched a surprise attack on the
enemy.
Both organizations proceeded
to battle out in the open, much
to the delight of more than a
hundred Babes who were perched
in Encina windows. Quick action
on the part of Stanley Weigel and
Jake Irwin, senior sponsors,
forced the freshmen, who had
brought fire hoses into action, to
leave the field clear.
The only casualty of the com
bat. occurred when a pitcher
gashed the temple of a Breakers
fighter. He was not seriously in
jured.
