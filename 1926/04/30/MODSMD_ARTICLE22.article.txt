There seems to be little doubt that the Stanford Band will prove a de
cided success tonight in its initial formal concert of the year. If appear
ances before the University at football games can l)e pseudo-trials, we be
lieve the band is well-fitted to entertain in the Assembly hall this evening.
After hearing the organization at every important athletic contest one is
led to accept it, with little further thought, as an institution; but like other
institutions, its withdrawal at any time would cerainly be the missing link
in an afternoon's enjoyment in the Stadium.
Professor Martin, the band's leader, claims for himself no "Sousan"
laurels, but we are tempted to fasten them upon him after glancing over
his record of twelve years' service for Stanford. Through his efforts the
organization has doubled in size, has improved greatly in appearance, is
capable of concert action; and, as noted above, is an indispensable part of
an athletic contest.
Years ago, there existed the custom of presenting a fortnightly con
cert in the court of the New Union or the band shell of Lake Lagunita.
We entertain little doubt on this matter, also—that a revival of the custom
would be a pleasing one to many of the University. Assembly Hall ap
pearances are too few and far between and there can be few things more
entertaining than an evening concert. s

LIVING GROUPS WHICH ARE NOT ADHERING strictly to
the rules governing competition are smirching the intramural sport calen
dar. Recently two teams were required to forfeit games which they had
won with ineligible men in their lineups.
Intramural sports are designed to give men who do not compete on
yarsity or freshman intercollegiate squads an opportunity for healthy com
petitive recreation. Groups should be eager to make the best possible
showing; but to do so they should not disregard the regulations which
have been made by the committee in charge. It is a direct violation of the
rules for members of intercollegiate teams to play on intramural squads.
The competition between living groups is one of the best features of
the Stanford athletic program. High standards have been set and these
should be maintained.

SEVERAL STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED that articles de
posited in the racks of the library have mysteriously disappeared. Let us
repeat that not so long ago personal property could be left with utter se
curity any place on the campus.

THE BIG TEN WEEKLY SAYS: Last spring Yale beat Harvard
25 to 15 in baseball. Harvard has called in Fred Mitchell as coach. His
first job will probably be to develop better punting.

The art of maintaining peace and order as practiced in the noble halls
of the University of Denver. Ihe Denver Clarion:
"If a committee of students dctects the authors of anonymous handbills dis
tributed two weeks ago carrying veiled charges against the administration, it will
mean warm trouble for some one.'

Engineers shine in the heart of the editor of the University of Wash
ington Daily —at the expense of the other male specimens on the campus:
"No, you never hear much about those engineers. You don't find them lolling
under trees or sporting gay plus-fours and still gayer sox. They aren't the kind that
clutter up sorority They aren't the type that are always demonstrating the
latest Charleston anguish."
