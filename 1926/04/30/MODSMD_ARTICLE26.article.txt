A BALLAD OF INDISCRETION
, O list to a lay that is tragic,
A story to fill you with tears;
A ballad familiar to many
(So we hope) in the oncoming years.
In the quaint little town of Dead Mule Creek
On a branch of the old Santa Fe
A youth was preparing for college;
He must leave his dear parents that day!
He left midst the plaudits of many.
All agreed there was no better lad
To bring fame to his little city,
Though his loss made the townspeople sad.
Alas! When he got to the college,
Dead Mule Creek soon faded away.
He forgot the advice of his papa,
And started in queening each day.
Went the days of the school year a flying—
Came the dawn of the day to go home —
'Rose our hero, arrayed him in golf pants
(This is nearly the end of the pome).
White knickers he wore to return in—
White knickers with faint checks of blue —
As he stepped from the train at Dead Mule Creek,
Women shrieked, strong men turned leaden-hue!
He proceeded no further than First Street
When guns in the firm hands of men
Poured forth sudden death on our hero —
No Hollywood stuff for them.
L'ENVOI
On return to your little home city,
For your personal safety and all,
Be sure to dress in approved fashion,
Too much pride precedeth a fall! —F.T.M
