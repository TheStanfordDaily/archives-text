# Two Stars Report to U.S.C. Coach for Spring Football
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, Los Angeles. â€” Offset
ting in part the loss of five stars
through graduation, Bert Heiser and
Gene Dorsey reported this week for
spring football at the University of
Southern California. These two men
were among the best Coach Henderson
had two years ago. Heiser is a full
back and last season was expected to
become the greatest bet on the squad
for this position. But Heiser failed vo
make enough hours and was therefore
ineligible last season. Dorsey dropped
out of the university about a year ago
and was also ineligible last fall. Dor
sey was one of the fastest ends on the
team two years ago and is a capable
punter.
The Trojans will also be aided this
year by the addition of such 1925
freshmen as Jesse Hibbs, tackle, and
John Fox, center. Both of these men
are almost certain of making the first
string this fall.
