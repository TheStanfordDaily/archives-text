It is a Stanford boast that the
University is up with the eduea- •
tional trend nine times out of ten

At present, however, the Univer
i sity is behind on the tenth inno

a popular pastime at several

The Stanford lack of sidewalks
hinders the adoption of the sport
here, as there are technical dif
ficulties which prevent skating

nevertheless, would be able to

dow followed by a rending crash

lecture hour.
