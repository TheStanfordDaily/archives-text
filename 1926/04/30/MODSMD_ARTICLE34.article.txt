# ENGLISHMEN MODEL WATER POLO ALONG SOCCER GAME LINES
## Introduced in United States By British Swimming Coach in 1897

By Herb Klein

Water polo, like basketball, is one I
of those games which has been tie-1
liberately "made up" at some definite |
time. Probably swimmers have played j
around in the water with inflated balls ;
for centuries, but it was not until the j
middle of the nineteenth century that
some ingenious Englishmen conceived
the idea of water polo.
One pleasant morning in the fifties
a group of swimming enthusiasts went
to bathe in a river not far from Lon
don. They took with them a round
football, such as is used for soccer.
The game they evolved was modelled j
along the lines of soccer among the j
land sports, and has been often called
"water soccer" since. The players—
there were seven on each side —hit
upon the idea of anchoring two row
boats in suitable places for their goals.
They probably altered and improved
the rules frequently as they played,
as children do with their own particu
lar game creations.

Water polo "took" at once and j
speard all over the British Isles. Inter- j
sectional games were started in which j
North England teams met those from j
the South, or Scotland met England, j
or Wales, Scotland, and so on. At first j
many swimmers played the game as a j
means of keeping in top condition, of
developing the ability to handle them
serves in the water, and of learning
to sprint with ease. It was soon played
for its own sake alone, and was recog
nized as a fast and exciting game with
a number of unique thrills.
In 1884 the game was recognized by
the Amateur Swimming Association of
England and a standardized set of
rules adopted. Slight variations which !
had existed in the game as it was j
played in the different sections of the !
British Isles were eliminated with the '
new regulations.
In 1890 the game was first intro- j
duced in the United States by one j
John Robinson, an English swimming j
coach. Robinson found that the Ameri- j
can temperament demanded a more
rough and tumble game with elements j
of football and wrestling thrown in. j
He and several of- the foremost Ameri-'
can players modified the sport so as i
to permit tackling in the water. Scor-j
ing was altered so that the ball was j
pressed against a goal board by the ;
hand of the player, instead of being j
thrown through a goal frame from a :
distance as it had been before. Some;
terrifying strangleholds and grips
were developed for the rules allowed i
a man to be held under till he released!
the ball.

This form of the game was very
popular here in 1897, and came to
the attention of thousands at the J
Sportsmen's shows, then being held
all over the United States. The supre
macy of the new form in American
athletic clubs and colleges lasted until
1911. In that year the New York Ath
letic Club and the Chicago Athletic
Clul), intense rivals, competed for the
annual A.A.U. championship under the
American rules. A bloody battle took
place in which several players on each
side were hurt. The A.A.U. officials
thereupon discarded this game in fa
vor of the original variety, which was
at that time thriving in Britain. Inter
national matches were being held
regularly in which England, Scotland,
and Wales took part. The game was
also thriving in English possessions
in New Zealand, Australia, Canada,
and India. It met with considerable
favor on the continent, especially
France.
At the present time Eastern colleges
still play a modified form of the
"American" game with its tackling
and ducking. With the exception of
these institutions all teams in the

United States use the original form, '
now known as "International water
polo." Each year seven or eight ex
cellent athletic club teams compete
for the A.A.U. tities. The last was won
a few weeks ago, by the Chicago Ath- j
letic. Club after several years of vie- j
tories by the Illinois Athletic Club. !

Water polo, like basketball, is one I
of those games which has been tie-1
liberately "made up" at some definite |
time. Probably swimmers have played j
around in the water with inflated balls ;
for centuries, but it was not until the j
middle of the nineteenth century that
some ingenious Englishmen conceived
the idea of water polo.
One pleasant morning in the fifties
a group of swimming enthusiasts went
to bathe in a river not far from Lon
don. They took with them a round
football, such as is used for soccer.
The game they evolved was modelled j
along the lines of soccer among the j
land sports, and has been often called
"water soccer" since. The players—
there were seven on each side —hit
upon the idea of anchoring two row
boats in suitable places for their goals.
They probably altered and improved
the rules frequently as they played,
as children do with their own particu
lar game creations.

Water polo "took" at once and j
speard all over the British Isles. Inter- j
sectional games were started in which j
North England teams met those from j
the South, or Scotland met England, j
or Wales, Scotland, and so on. At first j
many swimmers played the game as a j
means of keeping in top condition, of
developing the ability to handle them
serves in the water, and of learning
to sprint with ease. It was soon played
for its own sake alone, and was recog
nized as a fast and exciting game with
a number of unique thrills.
In 1884 the game was recognized by
the Amateur Swimming Association of
England and a standardized set of
rules adopted. Slight variations which !
had existed in the game as it was j
played in the different sections of the !
British Isles were eliminated with the '
new regulations.
In 1890 the game was first intro- j
duced in the United States by one j
John Robinson, an English swimming j
coach. Robinson found that the Ameri- j
can temperament demanded a more
rough and tumble game with elements j
of football and wrestling thrown in. j
He and several of- the foremost Ameri-'
can players modified the sport so as i
to permit tackling in the water. Scor-j
ing was altered so that the ball was j
pressed against a goal board by the ;
hand of the player, instead of being j
thrown through a goal frame from a :
distance as it had been before. Some;
terrifying strangleholds and grips
were developed for the rules allowed i
a man to be held under till he released!
the ball.

This form of the game was very
popular here in 1897, and came to
the attention of thousands at the J
Sportsmen's shows, then being held
all over the United States. The supre
macy of the new form in American
athletic clubs and colleges lasted until
1911. In that year the New York Ath
letic Club and the Chicago Athletic
Clul), intense rivals, competed for the
annual A.A.U. championship under the
American rules. A bloody battle took
place in which several players on each
side were hurt. The A.A.U. officials
thereupon discarded this game in fa
vor of the original variety, which was
at that time thriving in Britain. Inter
national matches were being held
regularly in which England, Scotland,
and Wales took part. The game was
also thriving in English possessions
in New Zealand, Australia, Canada,
and India. It met with considerable
favor on the continent, especially
France.
