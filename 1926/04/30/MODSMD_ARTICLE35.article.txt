The pageant this year concerns the
adventures of Resanoff, Russian noble
man and governor of Alaska, in San
Francisco and later in Siberia. The
Count came to California to seek food
supplies for his Alaskan colony in
1805, and spent several weeks in the
port. He also sought to get a trade |
treaty between the Czar and the King
of Spain, but the Spanish commerce j
regulations forbade any foreign trade !
for the colonies. During his stay Res-!
anoff met Dona Concepcion de Argu
ello, daughter of the governor of San
Francisco. He sought her hand in
marriage, and obtained her consent i
and her father's. He was forced, how-!
ever, to leave the Spanish port before |
a marriage could be consummated. j
Resanoff planned to return to Alaska
and thence to Russia. He promised
Dona Concepcion that he would try
to get the post as ambassador to
Spain. He never returned, however. In
the Fiesta, written by Jean Ward, the
story of his stay at San Francisco and
what'became of him after he left New
Spain is told.
The part of Resanoff is played by j
Chesterlyn Thomas, that of Dona Con-1
