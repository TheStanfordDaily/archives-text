# A 						CALENDAR OF COMING EVENTS
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Now that the Merry Month of May
is actually here at last, the Sport Fan,
whose other name is Legion, can
breathe a sigh of relief and cast his
\?agle eye ove& the calendar of coming
events with a bit of pleasurable an
ticipation. For the fifth month is chuck
full of events of importance in boxing,
racing, track, golf, and other sports,
and although 'tis the month of the '
Emerald, the diamond season is just
getting into its real stride. Last year
May was still in its infancy when Ty
Cobb hit three home runs and made
three other hits in six times at bat in
one game, and the next day hit two
more homers! And in this May Rogers
Hornsby celebrates his first anniver

sary as manager of the Cardinals.
Boxing jumps into the ring with
both feet this month. The Catholic
Big Sisters benefit in New York is the
outstanding feature, with that long
looked-for return battle between
Loayza and McGraw, and the Zivic-
Harmon, Genaro-Graham, and Gold
sten-Vacarelli bouts. It's a wow! Be
'sides that, we are promised a Stribling-
Risko set-to, a Carpentier-Huffman
; battle (?). a return Flowers-Greb
Snatch, and a fight between Jack De
laney and some worthy opponent.
Do you like horse-racing? Pimlico
opens May first, and the historic
Preakness will be run on the tenth.
The turf bugs will then flock to Louis

ville for the famous Derby to see
what fleet three-year-old will succeed
the famous Flying Ebony which so
surprised the world last year.
Golf? Glenna Collett plays in the
British women's championship on May
10th, and on the 24tli the male ama
teurs (i.e. gentlemen) tee off at Muir
field, in Scotland. There'll be plenty
of American entries there, with a fine
chance of the title coming back to
this country for the first time since
Walter Travis won it in 1904.
The well-known IC4A meet (the
"Intercollegiates") takes place at Cam
bridge on May 28th and 29th, and
there'll be other track meets of import
ance before then. The college crews

will be tuning up for the big races
in June, fishing and swimming are
good (sometimes), and sailing is fine
(if you have a boat). Tennis is in
order —and a second meeting between
Helen and Suzanne is the big May-be
of the month.
Polo? Not for me, except the Polo
Grounds kind, but it will be done. Not
as many people play polo as play
ponies, however. The iron steeds will
be the center of the spot light at the
end of the month when the knights
of the roaring road go tearing around
the oval before close to 200,000 spec
tators at Indianapolis in the annual
Memorial Day automobile race.
There are plenty of thrills in May!

The well-known IC4A meet (the
"Intercollegiates") takes place at Cam
bridge on May 28th and 29th, and
there'll be other track meets of import
ance before then. The college crews

will be tuning up for the big races
in June, fishing and swimming are
good (sometimes), and sailing is fine
(if you have a boat). Tennis is in
order —and a second meeting between
Helen and Suzanne is the big May-be
of the month.
Polo? Not for me, except the Polo
Grounds kind, but it will be done. Not
as many people play polo as play
ponies, however. The iron steeds will
be the center of the spot light at the
end of the month when the knights
of the roaring road go tearing around
the oval before close to 200,000 spec
tators at Indianapolis in the annual
Memorial Day automobile race.
There are plenty of thrills in May!

Now that the Merry Month of May
is actually here at last, the Sport Fan,
whose other name is Legion, can
breathe a sigh of relief and cast his
\?agle eye ove& the calendar of coming
events with a bit of pleasurable an
ticipation. For the fifth month is chuck
full of events of importance in boxing,
racing, track, golf, and other sports,
and although 'tis the month of the '
Emerald, the diamond season is just
getting into its real stride. Last year
May was still in its infancy when Ty
Cobb hit three home runs and made
three other hits in six times at bat in
one game, and the next day hit two
more homers! And in this May Rogers
Hornsby celebrates his first anniver

sary as manager of the Cardinals.
Boxing jumps into the ring with
both feet this month. The Catholic
Big Sisters benefit in New York is the
outstanding feature, with that long
looked-for return battle between
Loayza and McGraw, and the Zivic-
Harmon, Genaro-Graham, and Gold
sten-Vacarelli bouts. It's a wow! Be
'sides that, we are promised a Stribling-
Risko set-to, a Carpentier-Huffman
; battle (?). a return Flowers-Greb
Snatch, and a fight between Jack De
laney and some worthy opponent.
Do you like horse-racing? Pimlico
opens May first, and the historic
Preakness will be run on the tenth.
The turf bugs will then flock to Louis

ville for the famous Derby to see
what fleet three-year-old will succeed
the famous Flying Ebony which so
surprised the world last year.
Golf? Glenna Collett plays in the
British women's championship on May
10th, and on the 24tli the male ama
teurs (i.e. gentlemen) tee off at Muir
field, in Scotland. There'll be plenty
of American entries there, with a fine
chance of the title coming back to
this country for the first time since
Walter Travis won it in 1904.
