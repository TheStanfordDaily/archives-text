# MORE PLEDGE CARDS NEEDED TO ASSURE NEW CONCERTS PLAN
## Proposal May Fail Through Lack of Few Hundred Student Names 
### 
All members of the student body I
who have not yet signed pledge cards
for season tickets in the A.S.S.U. plan
for a series of six concerts to be given
next year, are urged to 'do so as soon j
as possible. Stanford is likely to fail i
by a few hundred votes, in which case ,
the concerts will not be held and a |
great opportunity will have been lost 1
to all students, according to those in 1
charge of the arrangements for the
plan.
It is believed that the series, if once
produced, would become a regular and 1
valued part of the yearly program,>
while if it fails for lack of interest j
this time, it will probably be many
years before a similar opportunity is '
offered.
Prompt response is necessary for
possibility of obtaining the artists on
the dates proposed will be lost within
a few days. If student support rallies,
and the 1300 pledges needed have j
been signed, contracts will be signed
in San Francisco, which will bring to |
the Stanford basketball pavilion a j
brilliant list of artists, including such ;
stars as Louis Graveure, Belgian bari- j
tone; Misclia Elman, violinist, and his ,
string quartette; Tito Schipa, noted j
operatic tenor, and Rosa Ponselle, j
leading soprano of the Metropolitan,
Opera Company of New York.
The San Francisco Symphony Or-,
chestra, conducted by Alfred Hertz, |
would also be presented and would be
a memorable concert, according tq.
Hertz, who says that the acoustics, as j
well as the seeing facilities of the pa- ;
vilion, are excellent.
The season price of $3 for the series j
is believed to be one of the lowest
prices ever offered anywhere for a j
group of this quality. It is mad pos- j
sible only by the seating capacity of j
the pavilion, and the student body i
promotion of the venture, which does
away with profits of outside managers ,
or organizations. Large numbers of j
Palo Alto and Peninsula citizens have,
declared their intention of attending J
the entire series if it is given.
More than one hundred and fifty 1
pledges were turned in yesterday to
boxes placed along the Quad for that :
purpose. Pledge cards may also be j
obtained and turned in at the Stanford (
Bookstore.
