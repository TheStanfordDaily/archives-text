# SCRIMMAGE WORKOUT COMPLETES SEASON'S FOOTBALL PRACTICE
## Warner Sees Good Prospects For Next Year's Team In New Material 
### 
Spring football ended this afternoon I
when Coach Warner organized teams
and ran them through their plays fac- j
ing other teams in regular competition.
Every man was given a chance to play, j
Coach Warner expressed himself as j
being impressed with one fact in par
ticular about the practices, and that !
was the excellent showing made by
men not on the team last year.
According to the coaches, a good
line may be expected next fall, with
several men out for each position. Be
cause of this mid-year work, the j
coaches will be better able to assign
the men to the places where they will
best fit, and where they will be S
needed most.
Practice during these months has j
included tackling, blocking, and clip- j
ping, with the tackling dummy. Dur-j
ing the last portion of the period, work ;
in opening holes in the line and break
ing through was administered. Side-;
stepping, open field running, and dif-j
ferent methods of carrying the ball
were drummed into the backfield, 1
while ends and linesmen had practice j
in getting down under punts.
Who Will Punt?
Kicking received special emphasis,
j because the need of a good kicker
since Nevers' departure. Good timber
was turned over and several players
give promise of developing into var
sity caliber by October. Graves. Post,
Young, Wolf, and Murphy are showing
the most promise in this line.
The flank positions are causing no
! worry, with Shipkey certain to hold
1 down his regular berth at left end, and
! with Davidson, Vincenti, Harder, Pres
ton, Worden, and Montgomery out for
the other wing place.
At tackle> Freeman, Poulson, Art
man, Everett, Moomaw, Morley, Gif
ford, and Harris are fighting for places.
Although Harris has not been out, he
will he in the running for the final
lineup next fall.
Captain Swan has deserted his posi
tion at guard, but his shoes are being
filled by Doyle, Robesky, Simons, Kata
zain, Ingram, and Helmke. From this
list will be chosen the two heavy
weight strong-arm defense men.
Four Try Center
Center is puzzling dopesters, for no

really outstanding single player has,
turned up. The trouble is not too
acute, for four out of the five aspirants
are about the same high caliber ma
terial. McCreery, Vermillya, Natcher,
and Graham leave little to be desired
in the key place. Cook, from the last
year's freshman team, has not had a
! great opportunity to show his wares,
j but is expected to be in the running
| when the suits are passed out.
In the backfield, the loss of Nevers,
' Mitchell, and Solomon will not be felt
as badly as it was thought. Quarter
■ backs are much in evidence since
Captain Swan and Eli Post have taken
i hold of the work. These two, with
i Lewis, freshman quarter last year, can
;be banked on to deliver the goods.
Millage, 1928 standby at full, is ex
j pected back next fall, and will try
lout for the quarterback place.
The fullback will be chosen from
I Walker, Patchett, Smalling, S. Post,
Fleishhacker, Young, and Josephs. All
of these men are new developments
1 except Patchett, who was Nevers' un
derstudy last season. Anything can be
expected when these men enter com
petition next fall for the coveted berth.
The man who predicted Ed Walker at
full may not miss his guess so very
far, since the ex-end, ex-quarterback,
i ex-fullback has been going well during
i workouts.

acute, for four out of the five aspirants
are about the same high caliber ma
terial. McCreery, Vermillya, Natcher,
and Graham leave little to be desired
in the key place. Cook, from the last
year's freshman team, has not had a
! great opportunity to show his wares,
j but is expected to be in the running
| when the suits are passed out.
In the backfield, the loss of Nevers,
' Mitchell, and Solomon will not be felt
as badly as it was thought. Quarter
■ backs are much in evidence since
Captain Swan and Eli Post have taken
i hold of the work. These two, with
i Lewis, freshman quarter last year, can
;be banked on to deliver the goods.
Millage, 1928 standby at full, is ex
j pected back next fall, and will try
lout for the quarterback place.
The fullback will be chosen from
I Walker, Patchett, Smalling, S. Post,
Fleishhacker, Young, and Josephs. All
of these men are new developments
1 except Patchett, who was Nevers' un
derstudy last season. Anything can be
expected when these men enter com
petition next fall for the coveted berth.
The man who predicted Ed Walker at
full may not miss his guess so very
far, since the ex-end, ex-quarterback,
i ex-fullback has been going well during
i workouts.
Spring football ended this afternoon I
when Coach Warner organized teams
and ran them through their plays fac- j
ing other teams in regular competition.
Every man was given a chance to play, j
Coach Warner expressed himself as j
being impressed with one fact in par
ticular about the practices, and that !
was the excellent showing made by
men not on the team last year.
According to the coaches, a good
line may be expected next fall, with
several men out for each position. Be
cause of this mid-year work, the j
coaches will be better able to assign
the men to the places where they will
best fit, and where they will be S
needed most.
Practice during these months has j
included tackling, blocking, and clip- j
ping, with the tackling dummy. Dur-j
ing the last portion of the period, work ;
in opening holes in the line and break
ing through was administered. Side-;
stepping, open field running, and dif-j
ferent methods of carrying the ball
were drummed into the backfield, 1
while ends and linesmen had practice j
in getting down under punts.
Who Will Punt?
Kicking received special emphasis,
j because the need of a good kicker
since Nevers' departure. Good timber
was turned over and several players
give promise of developing into var
sity caliber by October. Graves. Post,
Young, Wolf, and Murphy are showing
the most promise in this line.
The flank positions are causing no
! worry, with Shipkey certain to hold
1 down his regular berth at left end, and
! with Davidson, Vincenti, Harder, Pres
ton, Worden, and Montgomery out for
the other wing place.
At tackle> Freeman, Poulson, Art
man, Everett, Moomaw, Morley, Gif
ford, and Harris are fighting for places.
Although Harris has not been out, he
will he in the running for the final
lineup next fall.
Captain Swan has deserted his posi
tion at guard, but his shoes are being
filled by Doyle, Robesky, Simons, Kata
zain, Ingram, and Helmke. From this
list will be chosen the two heavy
weight strong-arm defense men.
