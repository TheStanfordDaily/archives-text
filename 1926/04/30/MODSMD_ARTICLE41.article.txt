# CARD MERMEN WILL SWIM AT SAN JOSE IN PRACTICE MEET
## Ineligible Flashes Promise To Make Varsity Men Show Speed 
### 
I Ernst Brandsten's mermen will clash
with, the San Jose alumni team in a
dual meet at San Jose tonight. This
; will be the first competition since the
California meet in which practically
i all the swimmers will take part, and
I they are on edge to make some speedy
i times.
The San Jose pool is 50 feet by
I 70 feet, the shorter dimension usually
being used as the length, so that a
hundred-yard swim will be six laps
and have five turns. Because of this,
| turning ability will be a great asset in
j all the races. The alumni team will
| have a slight edge, being accustomed
| to the pool.
Carl Stevenson, who will swim the
I 220- and the 100-yard free style for the
| Cards, has had experience in the San
! Jose tank, and will probably win the
furlong event by a large margin. The
I time should be well under 2:30. Steven

son is the only member competing to
night of the five-man Stanford team
which placed second in the National
Intercollegiate Championships at An
napolis. He has maintained training
since returning from the trip.
Fall Will Dive
Dave Fall, captain of the swimming
team and winner of second place in
the A.A.U. low board competition at
Chicago, will give an exhibition of
fancy diving. The diving event will
not count in the meet as the result
of San Jose's request that it be elimi
nated because of their deficiency in
the springboard event.
The lineup in the various events has
been picked by Brandsten. In the fifty
yard free style the Cards will be repre
sented by Bob Harris and Phil Brooks.
Both are capable of under 26 seconds.
The hundred-yard sprint will find
Kryne Van den Akker and Carl Steven
son as the Stanford hopes. This race
should be won in close to 58 seconds
in the shorter tank. It is doubtful if
San Jose has anyone that can give
either of the two Card century ir\3n
any competition.
Free Style Is Close
Carl Stevenson and Bill Danford will
swim the 220 free style. Danford
should make close to 2:30 if in good
form.
One of the specialty events is due
to go to San Jose and the other to
Stanford. Ted Smith, in the back
stroke hundred has been cutting his
time down daily until he can now
make 1:12 without extending himself.
With a few good turns he should go
well under this figure, as his condi
tion is good. Phil Brooks will be the
second man in the backstroke.
Herb Klein will swim the 100-yard
breaststroke, due to the absence of
Wagner, the first man in the Stanford-
California sailor style swim.
Willis, the San Jose flash, is figured
to win this event in about 1:15 or
under. Ted Smith may also swim for
I the Cards if the schedule of events

1 can be altered so that he has an
i opportunity to rest between the breast
: and backstroke races.
The exhibition swimming by the
Stanford ineligible men will be a fea
ture of the meet. Warren Littlefield,
j registered this quarter for the first
' time, is one of the best breaststrokers
on the coast. In a hundred-yard exhibi
j tion he is expected to go under 1:11.
; He gained time on every turn because
i of his great shove-off.
Colin Smith, A1 Christensen, Lee
Christensen, and Rod Ward, ineligi
! hie flashes, will have a relay team in
j that race to make things hot for
the varsity relay four.

Herb Klein will swim the 100-yard
breaststroke, due to the absence of
Wagner, the first man in the Stanford-
California sailor style swim.
Willis, the San Jose flash, is figured
to win this event in about 1:15 or
under. Ted Smith may also swim for
I the Cards if the schedule of events

1 can be altered so that he has an
i opportunity to rest between the breast
: and backstroke races.
The exhibition swimming by the
Stanford ineligible men will be a fea
ture of the meet. Warren Littlefield,
j registered this quarter for the first
' time, is one of the best breaststrokers
on the coast. In a hundred-yard exhibi
j tion he is expected to go under 1:11.
; He gained time on every turn because
i of his great shove-off.
Colin Smith, A1 Christensen, Lee
Christensen, and Rod Ward, ineligi
! hie flashes, will have a relay team in
j that race to make things hot for
the varsity relay four.
I Ernst Brandsten's mermen will clash
with, the San Jose alumni team in a
dual meet at San Jose tonight. This
; will be the first competition since the
California meet in which practically
i all the swimmers will take part, and
I they are on edge to make some speedy
i times.
The San Jose pool is 50 feet by
I 70 feet, the shorter dimension usually
being used as the length, so that a
hundred-yard swim will be six laps
and have five turns. Because of this,
| turning ability will be a great asset in
j all the races. The alumni team will
| have a slight edge, being accustomed
| to the pool.
Carl Stevenson, who will swim the
I 220- and the 100-yard free style for the
| Cards, has had experience in the San
! Jose tank, and will probably win the
furlong event by a large margin. The
I time should be well under 2:30. Steven

son is the only member competing to
night of the five-man Stanford team
which placed second in the National
Intercollegiate Championships at An
napolis. He has maintained training
since returning from the trip.
Fall Will Dive
Dave Fall, captain of the swimming
team and winner of second place in
the A.A.U. low board competition at
Chicago, will give an exhibition of
fancy diving. The diving event will
not count in the meet as the result
of San Jose's request that it be elimi
nated because of their deficiency in
the springboard event.
The lineup in the various events has
been picked by Brandsten. In the fifty
yard free style the Cards will be repre
sented by Bob Harris and Phil Brooks.
Both are capable of under 26 seconds.
The hundred-yard sprint will find
Kryne Van den Akker and Carl Steven
son as the Stanford hopes. This race
should be won in close to 58 seconds
in the shorter tank. It is doubtful if
San Jose has anyone that can give
either of the two Card century ir\3n
any competition.
Free Style Is Close
Carl Stevenson and Bill Danford will
swim the 220 free style. Danford
should make close to 2:30 if in good
form.
One of the specialty events is due
to go to San Jose and the other to
Stanford. Ted Smith, in the back
stroke hundred has been cutting his
time down daily until he can now
make 1:12 without extending himself.
With a few good turns he should go
well under this figure, as his condi
tion is good. Phil Brooks will be the
second man in the backstroke.
Herb Klein will swim the 100-yard
breaststroke, due to the absence of
Wagner, the first man in the Stanford-
