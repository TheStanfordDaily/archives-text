# FACULTY WILL RULE ON CARD I.C. 4-A. ENTRY
## Board of Athletic Control Approves Competition in Championship Meet TWELVE MAY MAKE TRIP Participation Dependent on Committee's Sanction at Session Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's participation in the Inter
| collegiate Amateur Athletic Associa
! tion of America track meet May 28
' and 29 at Philadelphia, with the na
! tional track championship as the stake,
| will be decided tomorrow morning at
a meeting of the Faculty Athletic Com
-1 mittee.
Sanction for twelve members of the
! Cardinal squad to participate in the
| IC4A meet was granted by the Board
j of Athletic Control, which will finance
! the trip, but this decision must be
I supported by the faculty committee.
I In the event that the proposed trip
is given faculty support, the Cardinal
men will be competing for the first
time since 1924, when the Stanford
j team took third place to Yale, although
( heavy favorites to take the champion
ship. Participation in the meet last
J year was financially impossible be
â–  cause of the loss of the Board of Ath
| letic Control in the Stanford-Nebraska
1 meet .However, six Cardinal men, led
! by Captain Glenn S. Hartranft, later
participated in the National Collegiate
1 meet, winning more points than any
other entering university.
Teams from both California and
' U.S.C. have already signified their in
! tentions of entering the IC4A, the lat
i ter to defend the national champion
' ship which they won last year. The
Bruin team under the direction of
! the veteran Walter Christie, took first
honors for three successive years prior
j to 1924. Stanford, provided she enters,
; will be U.S.C.'s chief contender for the
j national supremacy on the track and
! field.
