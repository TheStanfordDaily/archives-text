# Row Starts Last Lap Of Rushing; Ends Wednesday
## 
### 
Rushing starts on its last lap tomor
row morning at 8 o'clock when the
final period before pledging begins.
Dates with freshmen will extend until
1 o'clock Sunday morning, and rushing
on Sunday will be from 8 to 8 o'clock
Monday and Tuesday the lunch dates
will be from 11:30 to 2 o'clock and the
dinner dates from 5:30 to 8 o'clock.
Pledging will take place at the Old
Union on Wednesday, when the bids
will be given out by a duly authorized
lawyer.
One of the features of the rushing
system this year which is considered
an improvement over previous sys
tems is the limiting of the dates for
the night before pledging to 8 o'clock.
This gives the freshman a whole eve
ning and night to himself to make
his decision more in accordance with
his own desires.
