# PIANO SOLO FEATURE OF ENTERTAINMENT FOR JUNIOR PROM
## 
### 
Gene James will appear in person
with his Palace Hotel orchestra at the
Junior Prom Friday night and will
give a piano solo as a special feature,
according to an announcement made
last night by Victor Greisser, general
chairman for the dance. Work on deco
rating the basketball pavilion for the
promenade began Saturday morning
under the direction of John Menzies
and Kenneth Graham.
In order to have the decorations
completed for the dance Menzies de
clares that the co-operation of mem
bers of the junior class will be neces
sary. Work will be carried on at the
pavilion throughout the week.
No general call for workers from
the class will be issued, says Menzies,
who is in charge of the decorating,
but all class members are urged to re
port promptly when they are requested
to work.
The responsibility for securing
workers each day will be taken by the
members of the decoration committee:
Roy Hunt on Tuesday, Robert Mclnnes,
Wednesday, Sidney Meeks and Haugh
ton Uickerton, Thursday, and Thomas
Coughran, Friday. With this plan be
ing used it is expected to complete
the decorating with the least difficulty.
Decorations for the Junior Prom will
follow a Russian motif, and will be
carried out under the supervision of
John Craig of San Francisco. Panels
will be hung around the sides of the
pavilion from the thirty-foot ceiling,
while special lighting effects will be
used. Present plans also call for the
decoration of the lobby.
