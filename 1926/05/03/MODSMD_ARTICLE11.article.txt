# World's Record Goal Of Cardinal Mile Relay Team
## 
### 
An attempt toy Coach Dink Temple
ton's relay team to break the world's
record promises to be the outstanding
event in the annual Pacific Athletic
Association track and field meet to be
held in San Francisco next Saturday.
Further importance is added to the
event by the possibility that Charley
Hoff, the great Norwegian pole
vaulter, will run on the team opposing
the.Cardinals in their record-breaking
attempt. Hoff is a great broad-jumper
and sprinter, and has negotiated the
440 in 48 seconds flat on several occa
sions. If he enters the relay he will
probably run under the colors of the
Olympic Club.
Records Set in 1921
The existing record for the mile re
lay was set in Philadelphia in 1921 by
the Pennsylvania State American Le
gion team composed of Rogers, Eby,
Brown, and Maxam. The record es
established at this time was 3 minutes,
16 4-10 seconds. The intercollegiate
record is held by the University of
lowa four-man team in 3 minutes 18
6-10 seconds. Stanford's best time this
season was made in the Big Meet,
when the Cardinals beat California by
sixty yards in 3 minutes, 19 seconds.
The Cardinal one-lap runners, Bab
cock, Storie, Richardson, and Miller,
set this time with practically no oppo
sition, so Templeton is convinced that
his men can step around the world's
record with a little competition to stir
them on.
Save Men for Relay
Templeton announced definitely that
his relay runners would not compete in
their other events unless the relay was
held first. Stanford's track team is
strong enough to have a good chance
to cop the P.A.A. championship with
out Richardson in the 880 and Miller,
Storie, and Babcock in the 440. The
Cardinal mentor plans to save his men
for the record-breaking attempt in pre
ference to allowing them to ruin their
chances by running in other races.
Another great attraction will be the
attempt made by Charley Hoff to
break his own world's mark in the
pole vault. The Norwegian vaulter has
set his mark at fourteen feet and will
make a great effort to clear the bar
at this height.
Scholz Entered
Jackson Scholz, national 220' cham
pion, has also entered the meet. He
worked out on the Stanford oval last
night and seemed to be in the best of
condition. Track enthusiasts are ex
pecting a great race between Scholz
and Captain Barber, of California.

The Cardinal one-lap runners, Bab
cock, Storie, Richardson, and Miller,
set this time with practically no oppo
sition, so Templeton is convinced that
his men can step around the world's
record with a little competition to stir
them on.
Save Men for Relay
Templeton announced definitely that
his relay runners would not compete in
their other events unless the relay was
held first. Stanford's track team is
strong enough to have a good chance
to cop the P.A.A. championship with
out Richardson in the 880 and Miller,
Storie, and Babcock in the 440. The
Cardinal mentor plans to save his men
for the record-breaking attempt in pre
ference to allowing them to ruin their
chances by running in other races.
Another great attraction will be the
attempt made by Charley Hoff to
break his own world's mark in the
pole vault. The Norwegian vaulter has
set his mark at fourteen feet and will
make a great effort to clear the bar
at this height.
Scholz Entered
Jackson Scholz, national 220' cham
pion, has also entered the meet. He
worked out on the Stanford oval last
night and seemed to be in the best of
condition. Track enthusiasts are ex
pecting a great race between Scholz
and Captain Barber, of California.
An attempt toy Coach Dink Temple
ton's relay team to break the world's
record promises to be the outstanding
event in the annual Pacific Athletic
Association track and field meet to be
held in San Francisco next Saturday.
Further importance is added to the
event by the possibility that Charley
Hoff, the great Norwegian pole
vaulter, will run on the team opposing
the.Cardinals in their record-breaking
attempt. Hoff is a great broad-jumper
and sprinter, and has negotiated the
440 in 48 seconds flat on several occa
sions. If he enters the relay he will
probably run under the colors of the
Olympic Club.
Records Set in 1921
The existing record for the mile re
lay was set in Philadelphia in 1921 by
the Pennsylvania State American Le
gion team composed of Rogers, Eby,
Brown, and Maxam. The record es
established at this time was 3 minutes,
16 4-10 seconds. The intercollegiate
record is held by the University of
lowa four-man team in 3 minutes 18
6-10 seconds. Stanford's best time this
season was made in the Big Meet,
when the Cardinals beat California by
sixty yards in 3 minutes, 19 seconds.
