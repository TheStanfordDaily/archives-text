# FOUNDER NEW THEORY OF VOICE TRAINING TO LECTURE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Madame Barbereaux Parry, founder j
of the Barbereaux system of voice j
| training will speak tonight at the Pi i
| Phi House at 9 o'clock.
Madame Parry stands in much the
same relation to the musical world
j that Marietta Johnson does to the edu
j cational, both having made a careful
voice training of children.
The Barbereaux system is based upon
the theory that all vocal action is
j involuntary. The old orthodox methods
I of voice training, by concentrating the
| pupils' attention upon technique and
| pitch, tends to make the action valun
; tary.
To illustrate the harmful effects of
! such methods, Madame Parry, in her
book, suggests that we try to turn
| some other involuntary act, such as
1 winking, into a voluntary action. She
i claims the technique of singing will
' take care of itself if certain simple
' conditions are maintained.
Her lecture will be addressed to the
general public as well as to musicians,
! since her method trains the speaking
as well as the singing voice, and in
! volves the whole education of the
child.
The lecture tonight is free and the
public is invited.
