# TICKETS FOR JUNIOR OPERA WILL GO ON SALE TOMORROW
## Many of This Year's Finds Have Roles in "Ride A Cock-Horse" PRESENTED TWO NIGHTS Aileen Burks Will Make Last Appearance in Well- Suited Part 
### 
Tickets for the 1927 Junior Opera,
"Ride a Cock-Horse," will go on Bale
at the Old Union at 1 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon. They are priced at $1 and
$1.25.
The Opera will be presented in the
Assembly hall on both Friday and Sat
urday nights. This arrangement was
made in order that Palo Alto people
could obtain better seats, and so the
students going to the Junior Prom
could get seats for the following night
and would not have to miss the show.
Aileen Burks, co-starring with Velma
Randall, is making her last appear
ance on the campus stage in a part to
which she is well suited and in which
she will culminate a long series ot
successful characterizations. She made
her debut in Captain Applejack, and
has since been seen in "Milestones,"
"So This Is Eden," "Polly with a
Past," and "Fashion." Miss Burks has
also taken roles in skits for several
football and track shows
Experienced Cast
All of the people in the cast have
had former experience on the campus,
except Rupert Adams, who is taking
the part of a Jewish solicitor. Velma
Randall, who will be remembered from
two performances this year in "The
Goose Hangs High," and "Fashion,"
made her initial appearance last year
in the sophomore play, "Dulcy." Since
then she has been in one play a quar
ter. taking parts in "You and I," and
last year's Junior Opera. "Ace High,"
besides the plays this year.
In co-starring Miss Burks and Miss
Randall, two of the most accomplished
actresses who have been at Stanford
for some time will be seen in parts
well suited to them.
Besides the finds of former years,
the newer people of this year are also
cast in leading parts. A1 Cass, who
will be remembered as the roviest
Rover of the Ram's Head show last
quarter, has one part of a double wnale
lead, with William Pabst.
Character Roles
Cecil Doll and Felton Kaufmann are
two more who have started their cam-
I pus careers only this year. Doll played
the part of the blustery chief of de
j tectives in the sophomore play, "In
j the Next Room," and the part of an
old man in "Fashion." His part as Sir
I Roderick is that of a nervous, bluster
ing English peer. Kaufmann was also
i in "Fashion," and has the part of a
j Jew solicitor.
As a whole, the cast is unusually ex
; perienced. Lucie Bentley, the only
other feminine lead, has shown an
ability to play sophisticated parts with
poise and polish. John Truman was
j in "The Devil's Daughter," last year's
] Ram's Head production. His portrayal
J of the old witch will be long remem
I bered as a splendid piece of work
! George Mauser, George Bogue, Ridei
Torjussen, and Frank Baker have ap
j peared before.

Cecil Doll and Felton Kaufmann are
two more who have started their cam-
I pus careers only this year. Doll played
the part of the blustery chief of de
j tectives in the sophomore play, "In
j the Next Room," and the part of an
old man in "Fashion." His part as Sir
I Roderick is that of a nervous, bluster
ing English peer. Kaufmann was also
i in "Fashion," and has the part of a
j Jew solicitor.
As a whole, the cast is unusually ex
; perienced. Lucie Bentley, the only
other feminine lead, has shown an
ability to play sophisticated parts with
poise and polish. John Truman was
j in "The Devil's Daughter," last year's
] Ram's Head production. His portrayal
J of the old witch will be long remem
I bered as a splendid piece of work
! George Mauser, George Bogue, Ridei
Torjussen, and Frank Baker have ap
j peared before.
Tickets for the 1927 Junior Opera,
"Ride a Cock-Horse," will go on Bale
at the Old Union at 1 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon. They are priced at $1 and
$1.25.
The Opera will be presented in the
Assembly hall on both Friday and Sat
urday nights. This arrangement was
made in order that Palo Alto people
could obtain better seats, and so the
students going to the Junior Prom
could get seats for the following night
and would not have to miss the show.
Aileen Burks, co-starring with Velma
Randall, is making her last appear
ance on the campus stage in a part to
which she is well suited and in which
she will culminate a long series ot
successful characterizations. She made
her debut in Captain Applejack, and
has since been seen in "Milestones,"
"So This Is Eden," "Polly with a
Past," and "Fashion." Miss Burks has
also taken roles in skits for several
football and track shows
Experienced Cast
All of the people in the cast have
had former experience on the campus,
except Rupert Adams, who is taking
the part of a Jewish solicitor. Velma
Randall, who will be remembered from
two performances this year in "The
Goose Hangs High," and "Fashion,"
made her initial appearance last year
in the sophomore play, "Dulcy." Since
then she has been in one play a quar
ter. taking parts in "You and I," and
last year's Junior Opera. "Ace High,"
besides the plays this year.
In co-starring Miss Burks and Miss
Randall, two of the most accomplished
actresses who have been at Stanford
for some time will be seen in parts
well suited to them.
Besides the finds of former years,
the newer people of this year are also
cast in leading parts. A1 Cass, who
will be remembered as the roviest
Rover of the Ram's Head show last
quarter, has one part of a double wnale
lead, with William Pabst.
