# Eastward, Ho!
## 
### 
The three leading California universities will all be represenetd at the
annual I.C.A.A.A.A. track and field championship, as a result of the de
cision of the Faculty Athletic committee to allow a ten or twelve-man
Stanford team to make the trip to Harvard. U.S.C. and California had
already decided to send representatives.
The names of the Stanford athletes who will make the trip have not
yet heen announced; but the faculty committee definitely provided that a
man in order to make the trip must have at least a "C" average, and must
return to take final examinations at the termination of the competition.
The date of the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet as far as we at Stanford are con
cerned, is rather inconvenient for the competition is held only two weeks
before the final examinations of the Spring quarter. It would not be any
too safe for a man who has not a few honor points to miss practically two
weeks of schooling at so late a date in the quarter. As personnel of the
team has not been announced, we cannot ascertain the number of men that
will be affected by the setting of a scholastic requirement; but the action
is fair, and should satisfy both the students and the faculty.
But to get back to the original subject; the California delegation will
be formidable to say the least. Dopesters are already at work; and their
figures are gratifying. Of the three colleges U.S.C. is the favorite, with
Stanford a close second, and the Berkeley men in third place. Perhaps
the order will be shifted after the Pacific Coast Conference meeting Sat
urday; but in any event it seems that together the three universities have a
fair chance to capture the lion's share of the points at the Eastern meet.
Verily, the East should look to the West.

"Upperclassmen at the University of California and Stanford University wear
corduroy trousers. The class loyalty of each individual is judged by the amount of
dirt which he is able to accumulate on them. Sometimes a pair of "cords" is worn
for two years without being subjected to the indignity of the washtub."

THE EDITORIAL STAFF of the Daily Palo Alto will meet in the
office at 1 o'clock tomorrow. It is essential that.every member he present.
