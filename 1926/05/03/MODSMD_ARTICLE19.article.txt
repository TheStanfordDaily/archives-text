# STUDY PLAN REVISED BY MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR FALL QUARTER
## 
### 
Revision of the curriculum of the
School of Medicine of Stanford Uni
versity at San Francisco will be in
stituted in the fall quarter. Until the
present time the third year of the
medical student's work has been de
voted to theoretical, didactic work,
practical experience coming in the
Out-Patient Clinic.
The Out-Patient Clinic is maintained
for persons who need medical advice
and service and are unable to pay for
it. In return for the service given by
the clinic, they enter an agreement
whereby the medical students can
study and examine their cases.
According to the new system, medi
cal students will begin practical work
in their third year in the Out-Patient
Clinic and will include some theo
retical work. The majority of his
fourth year will be devoted to work in
the clinic. This revision brings the
student in contact with patients whose
cases are not severe enough to he
sent to the hospital. During his year
as an interne the medical man has to
do chiefly with severe cases. Hence
this new system gives him ambula
tory practice as well as the other.
This system also places the student
on his own initiative as contrasted
with the routine method of formal
courses. A student, being assigned a
specific case, must thoroughly acquaint
himself with the nature of the disease
or ailment through extra reading, en
aiding the student to cover each field
comprehensively.
Next year will be the transltorj
year in which the new system will bt
instituted. Modifications and adjust
mpnts will be made for those now
working under the present system
â– who will be affected by the revision
