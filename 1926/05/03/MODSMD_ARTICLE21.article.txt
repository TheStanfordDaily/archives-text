# CABBAGES and THINGS
## FROM BAD TO WORSE 
### Steve O'Donnell 
Willie McSoup was the chief itch and rub in the senior class ol' Little
Rock High, Little Rock, Montana. He was the town sheik and rated swell
with all the women, and everything; it just came natural. Willie wasn't stuck
up or anything, he merely took it all as a matter of course—something to be
expected.
When Willie graduated and went East to college everybody said he would
show up those Eastern boys, and make them green with envy. Why, there
wasn't nobody in all Montana could shake a stick to Willie—the big blonde
brute.
So Willie came to college. Of course he would have no trouble in assert
ing his title as sheik of the campus. But things didn't go so well at first—the
other boys in his class deliberately shunned him. This Willie attributed to
their jealousy, and proceeded to take no notice of it.
Finally the day of the big frosh dance rolled around, and our Bill set
forth in all his countrified glory to make the hit of the night. He had been
unable, for some unknown reason, to find a girl to go with him, but he was
going anyway—wouldn't be hard for him to cut in.
At the dance, true to his purpose, he walked to the middle of the xoor
as one did in Montana, and tried to cut in. Not a chance—he just stood
there like a rummy, until at last someone yelled to him, "Get off the floor
ya big hayseed."
And then it dawned upon him that the other fellows were dressed dif
ferent—and looked different. They had tuxes.
Willie was wearing his brown suit, the pride of Little Rock, which didn't
quite fit him, the heels of his shoes were run down, his hair was uncombed
and hadn't been cut for a month or two. Then came the realization of the
horrible truth—just a plain counrified hick.
Quietly, unnoticed, he stole away fearful lest someone should further
ridicule for the tears that were in his eyes. "Just a hick, a plain hick, instead
of the life of the party. Oh, Death, where is thy sting?"
And thus another misguided creature had been crudely awakened to his
real status in this world of ours—this cruel, unsympathetic world.
Ain't it the truth? The hope and pride of Little Rock and the hayseed
boob of Kampus Kollege.
Moral: Look before you leap, and then don't leap. —W.P.W.

Willie was wearing his brown suit, the pride of Little Rock, which didn't
quite fit him, the heels of his shoes were run down, his hair was uncombed
and hadn't been cut for a month or two. Then came the realization of the
horrible truth—just a plain counrified hick.
Quietly, unnoticed, he stole away fearful lest someone should further
ridicule for the tears that were in his eyes. "Just a hick, a plain hick, instead
of the life of the party. Oh, Death, where is thy sting?"
And thus another misguided creature had been crudely awakened to his
real status in this world of ours—this cruel, unsympathetic world.
Ain't it the truth? The hope and pride of Little Rock and the hayseed
boob of Kampus Kollege.
Moral: Look before you leap, and then don't leap. —W.P.W.
