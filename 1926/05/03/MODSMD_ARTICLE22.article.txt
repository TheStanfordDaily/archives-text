He'd waited for at least a week, and never got a note;
The silence that the lady kept was getting all his goat.
He dropped another little line to let her know he waited
For her reply, but not a word returned; so he debated
"This mamma that I called my own has tossed me by the way;
No mamma living ever saw me standing that. Well, say,
"I'll find some homely little maid and rush her for a week;
I'll show that high hat little girl she'll be the first to speak!"
And so he phoned a friend and asked if he knew anyone
Who'd like to trye a little date—yes, blind—and have some fun?
Why, sure, he knew the very dame and she would love to go;
Of course, she wasn't beautiful, but nice?—Oh, well, you know!
And so, when Friday came around, our hero went to call,
A-wondering if he was picked, or if he'd picked a fall.
He stepped inside, and Holy Cow, she wasn't much on face,
But she was nice!!!! Oh, well, you know—you find them everyplace.
They had an evening full of fun, and came home late at night.
And paused outside the little gate, where they concluded right.
The next week, came another date, and then, with weeks that followed,
Still othrs came, and then arrived the joy that must be swallowed.
With this advance toward happiness, the couple felt so gay,
They'd see each other often, when there were cakes to slay.
The little high hat lady who was cause of all this mirth
Had faded from his mind as if she wasn't on the earth.
Of course, this would have been quite sad, but she refused to worry;
She didn't even bat an eye amid this fuss and flurry,
For she was having quite a time with one who'd been a date
As blind as that which started him toward his present fate.
The ways of love are manifold, and no one knows the key
To what may come from idle dates as well as you and me.
They both are having hotsy times and neither cares a hoot
What happens to the other, and they've lulu times, to boot.
So blind dates aren't the rotten things they crack them up to be
Unless, of course, the dates I mean are those for you and me. —L.A.B.
