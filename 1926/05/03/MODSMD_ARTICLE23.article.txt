# CHEMICAL STAFF AT CEMENT FACTORY IS HEADED BY ALUMNI

### Clark Dilley 
Two Stanford men, O. U. Small, who
was at Stanford 1915-i7, and E. Bol
linger, '25, are head and assistant
head respectively of the chemical de
partment of the Portland Cement fac
tory at Redwood (Oity, Small was
appointed to his position in 1924 and
Bollinger last summer.
The Redwood City plant is the first
of its kind to use material from oyster
shells for cement, which is composed
of limestone, silica, iron, aluminum,
and a small amount of gypsum. In
searching for this material a limestone
containing a high percentage of cal
cium carbonate and silica in a com
bined form must be found. Investiga
j tions of the bottom of the San Fran
cisco bay showed that a large bed
of oyster shells and clay contained the
[appropriate mixture of silica and the
other necessary materials suitable for
the manufacture of cement.
Since the establishment of this plant
numerous other plants have been built
which get part or all of their material
from shells and sediment under water.
In the East a plant has been erected
which obtains part of its material
I
j from such marine deposits, while near
New Orleans a plant, is being con
structed to get its material solely, as
the Redwood plant, from deposits lying
upon the ocean floor.
At Redwood City large centrifugal
pumps are used, which have cutters
to bore into the beds And suckers to
draw the material up into barges. At
the mill the shells are ground to a very
fine mesh by steel balls. Water, having
j been added to insure finer grinding,
I when combined with the ground shrll
I and clay forms a slurry which is
pumped into pipes from which sam
ples are taken to determine if the
mixture is correct.
When the proper mixture is ob
tained the slurry is pumped into a
cylindrical kiln and the material slowly
flows from one end to the other while
i being subjected to a temperature
i reaching as high as 3000 degrees

Fahrenheit. Upon cooling the clinkers
which had been formed in the kiln
are ground into a fine powder, thus
forming the cement ready for use.

Women students at the Adventists'
College of Walla Walla, Washington,
are required to wear, their dresses
within twelve inches of the floor.
