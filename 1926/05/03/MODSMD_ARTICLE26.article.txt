## NEW PILLARS MAKE POSSIBLE GREATER VISION AND SAFETY 
### 
"If we could only see that little spot
just about the corner we would be
assured of far greater safety in driv
ing," says Durlin B. Hackett, local
Hupmobile dealer. "Cars seemingly
come out of 'no-where* merely because
the driver's vision is restricted by the
old-style front pillars. The number of
accidents resulting on this account can
be decreased through the wider use of
the newer type of body construction
such as is now used on the Hupmobile
Six which provides full vision both to
the right and left of the driver.
"This is one way manufacturers can
co-operate with automobile clubs to
make driving safer.
"It has been pointed out that the
majority of mishaps are the result of
the driver's inability to quickly detect
cars that are approaching from either
aide because the front windshield pil
lar forms a "blind spot" on the line of
sight. Also, the normal eye cannot
discern objects coming from the left
as readily as from the right side.
"The narrow window pillar as spe
cially designed for Hupmobile closed
cars is a slender steel column which
combines safety in clear vision as well
as furnishing the necessary strength
and stability as roof support. This pil
lar in the sedan makes it possible to
readily detect any car that is approach
ing in ample time to prevent collision."
