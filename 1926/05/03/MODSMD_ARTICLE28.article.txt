# TELLS OF GREATER THOUGHT NEEDED IN TIRE CONSTRUCTION
## 
### 
"Your tires are 110 better than
their cord structure!"
This terse statement was made
today by Mr. Nuttall, Palo Alto
dealer for the Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. Mr. Nuttall was em
phasizing the need for greater
thought on the part of every mo
torist for the vital factors in tire
construction that control mileage
and govern economy.
"Tires are, in reality, cord fab
ric structures heavily insulated
and fortified with rubber," he
said. "The back-bone of the tire,
the framework, the skeleton of
the tire, is therefore the cord
aterial from which it is built. On
an even basis with the quality of
the tread, side-wall, and bead con
struction, too much attention can
not be given to the cord structure
of the tire, when new equipment
is being bought."
