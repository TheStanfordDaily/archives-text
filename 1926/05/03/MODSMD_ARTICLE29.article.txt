# OLD TIRES MAY BE TURNED IN ON NEW BALLOONS-DEALER

"A lot of people still do not realize
that they can turn in their high-pres
sure tires and get an allowance on
them when they buy balloon tires,"
says W. A. Boggess of the Palo Alto
Vulcanizing Works.
"These car owners have been im
pressed by the easy riding qualities of
balloon tires and the saving they repre
sent in repair bills and increased trac
tion, but because some of the present
high-pressure tire equipment is still
in good condition they decide to wait
until the tires wear out before replac
ing them with balloons.
"But tires do not wear out all at the
same time —and balloon tires cannot
be put on one at a time.
"It is, however, possible to put on
interchangeable balloon tires in the
rear with high-pressure tires in front,
and some car owners have started
using balloon tires in this way.
"However, if a man has high-pres
sure tires on his car, one of which,
let's say, is practically new and one
pretty well worn out and the other
two having seen more or less wear, he
can make a fresh start with balloons
by bringing his tires in and getting an
allowance on them against the pur
chase of new tires. This has made it
easy for thousands of people over the
country to change over to balloon tire
equipment without too much expense."
