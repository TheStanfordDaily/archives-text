# STANFORD CONVALESCENT HOME OPENS FUND DRIVE
## 
### 
With $1000 as the goal, the Stanford
Convalescent Home Appeal will begin
on the campus next Wednesday to
last for a week, terminating on May
12, Labor Day, at the Home. It is
hoped that this quota will be exceeded
by several hundred dollars, the Con
valescent Home being a distinctively
Stanford charity.
Last year $33,000 was spent in car
ing for the sick children who are
brought here from San Francisco to
grow strong and healthy. Stanford and
Palo Alto together will raise $7000 for
the support of the Home during the
coming year. Of this $1000 will be ob
tained by campus appeal.
Through Living Groups
The appeal will be made this year
through the living group organizations
on the campus. Each fraternity, soror
ity, and club will have a fund through
which the subscriptions of its .mem
bers are turned in as was done very
successfully by a few organizations
last year. The amounts of the funds
will be announced from day to day
during the week. The aim is to get a
contribution from every student at

Stanford.
The committee in charge of the ap
peal is made up of Lorraine Cleave
land, Helen Huneke, William Fain,
Les Gordon, Kenneth McDougall, Sher
man Hazelton, and Louis Lundborg.
All arrangements will be made by
them through the presidents of cam
pus groups. The committee will begin
work tomorrow and the contributions
will start Wednesday.
Debt of $1500
The income of the home last year
was $31,500 which came from contri
butions from the San Francisco Com
munity Chest, endowments, and Stan
ford support. The large number of
cases taken care of by the Home called
for an expenditure of $33,000, so that
a debt of $1500 now exists which will
be paid off from the $7000 to be raised
here.
The Convalescent Home is unique
as a University charity. It is inti
mately associated with Stanford both
in its organization and its location. It
has become a regular part of the
school year to spend a day in which
the student body works at the Home.
