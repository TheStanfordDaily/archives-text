# All-Steel Body Still Good After Eleven Years' Service
## 
### 
One of the first cars to have an all
steel body was salvaged from a junk
pile recently, and, while the chassis and
engine were useless, the body was in
perfect condition, except for its paint,
and could have been used again after
eleven years of service.

There are now 4,600,000 motor ve
hicles registered on farms in the United
States. Of this number, 4,160,000 are
passenger cars.

Chevrolet production in January this
year was nearly three times that of the
same month last year.
