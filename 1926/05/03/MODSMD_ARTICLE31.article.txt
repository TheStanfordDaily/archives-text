# SPEEDY ROADSTERS USED BY MOTOR OFFICERS CARS PROVE PRACTICAL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DEMPSEY'S ARREST DEMONSTRATES ABILITY
## 
### 
j California motorists during the past
I year have, no doubt, come to respect
] the speedy little Chrysler roadsters
j which are in general use throughout
| Northern California and the officers
J using these cars state that there is
! rarely, if ever, a case where the mo
| torist can successfully elude them. It
j is evident that the efficiency of the
patrolling officers is increasing, due
to the fact that with the old motor
cycle equipment, the highways are
practically unpatrolled during wet
weather as it is highly hazardous to
ride a motorcycle at high speeds on a
wet highway. The four-wheel equip
ment with the hydraulic four-wheel
breaks enable the officers to maintain
their patrols without let-up.
Another advantage of the atuomobile
equipment is that a traffic officer
mounted on a motorcycle can be "spot
ted" by a motorist for a great distance
on the highway and consequently the
motorist will be much more discreet
when he knows an officer is in the
immediate vicinity.
Dempsey Picked
The speed and pick-up of the Chrys
ler was ably demonstrated about a
month ago when one of the Madera
County officers arrested Jack Dempsey
when he was traveling over seventy
miles an hour. The Dempsey limousine
and the state car were speeding down
the highway and ran into a string of
autos. Here the Chrysler's pick-up
came into use, as a result of which
Jack Dempsey is now facing a charge
of speeding, although his chauffeur

i was driving the machine at the time.
As a matter of general information
and also a warning to owners who
have a weakness for speeding, atten
tion is called to the number of Chrys
ler sales made recently to the force
of law and order.
About thirty members of the Cali
fornia State Police force are now
equipped with Chrysler cars, according
to A. M. Grant & Company, Chrysler
distributors in Palo Alto.
The state does not buy these cars,
but each officer is given an allowance
and told to buy the car he thinks is
best suited to his needs. These men
know motor cars from bumper to
bumper and the fact that over half
the entire force have chosen Chrysler
is ample proof of the confidence in
Chrysler's ability.
Mr. Grant also reports that Motor
Police in a number of the different
sections of the country have standard
ized on Chryslers. There are a large
number of these cars used by the New
York police and the justly famous
Pennsylvania constabulary, as well as
in other states.
Such sales as those made to the
various state officers, emphasize the
high standing in which Chrysler cars
are held among owners or operators
whose transportation needs require un
failing performance. Because of the
rapid acceleration and their ability to
operate at high speeds over extended
periods, Chrysler cars have become
the predominant choice in this import
ant field of service.
