# Italian Speed Demon Breaks Thirty-Six World's Records
## 
### 
Thirty-six world records are said to
have been broken during a non-stop
run by an automobile over the Monza
track in Italy. The car covered 14,916
kilometers (9,268.35 miles) in 144 hours.

I he "life of the party" who drives at
60 miles an hour very frequently puts
an end to it later.
