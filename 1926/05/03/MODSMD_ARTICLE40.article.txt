# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
When Walter Johnson shut out the hard-hitting Athletics in a fifteen
inning game at Washington about two weeks ago, he started the season most
auspiciously for a pitcher who is now in his twentieth season in the majors.
Disciples of numerology will take delight in proving that much good luck must
come from an opening day's performance which brings a veteran pitcher's
strike-out total of 3,333 and his shut-out victories to 111. And the first inning
that he pitched was his 5,555 th, too! Surely it must mean something.
It's an old stunt to tell who was president, who was the heavyweight
champion, and how old certain young stars of the present era were when such
and such a veteran first began his career, but I know of no better way than
that of bringing out forcefully just how long this remarkable man has been
pitching. When you say that he threw his fast ball over the plate for Wash
ington in 1907, it doesn't mean as much as if you say that he began when
Roosevelt was President, when Tommy Burns was heavyweight boxing cham
pion of the world, when Jack Dempsey was only 12 years old, and when
Helen Wills was just beginning to walk. And the fact that he is still able
to burn over his speed ball and control his curves after spending nineteen
consecutive seasons doing it is a great tribute to as fine a pitcher as ever
lived. And you might add that last year he batted .433!
There have been many famous Johnsons in sport history, but none will
ever hold the place in the hearts of the fans at large that "Big Train"
occupies. The swish and the rush and the roar of his fast ball will be stilled
eventually, but the pitching records he has set and the bigness of the man
himself will never be forgotten.
