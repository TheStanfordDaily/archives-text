# NEW STANFORD SONG INTRODUCED BY BAND AT FORMAL CONCERT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
. "Stanford Forever," a new march
by E. R. Flint, '01, was presented to
the campus for the first time last Fri
day night when the Stanford Hand
gave its formal concert in the Assem
bly hall. The number proved to be
spirited, melodious, and original. It
won the hearty approval of the large
audience which heard the concert, and
should be a popular addition to the
Stanford songs and marchcs.
During its two-hour program the
band played for the most part in a
capable and finished manner. The com
positions included many solos on the
various band instruments. Among the
ensemble pieces the suite, "Atlantis,"
which closed the program, was prob
ably the most dramatic and impressive.
The band was far more successful
in its regular selections than when
acting as accompaniment to its solo
ists, at which time there was a ten
dency to get slightly off pitch. As an
ensemble, however, the band showed
excellent unity and sharpness of at
tack which indicated sureness of exe
cution resulting from ample practice.
Professor Ernest Whitney Martin, di
rector of the band, led throughout the
concert.
The program opened with "Alma
Mater." Schubert's tuneful overture
to "Rosamunde" followed. John M.
Wlllits, student leader, played a cor
net solo, "Stars in a Velvety Sky," in
a pleasing manner, and encored with
Victor Herbert's "Kiss in the Dark."
A French horn and flute duet was
played by Walter Heineman, and H.
Weldon Nussbaum. -The band accom
paniment was somewhat loud and par
tially absorbed the tone. The entire
band encored with "Celestial Choir"
by King. Adin D. Henderson gave an
J excellent and lively rendition of "Little
| Sweetheart" on the E flat clarinet.

The band offered "Fall of Jericho,"
a descriptive suite in six divisions.
Lack of contrasts of volume prevented
this number from having much dra
matic quality although it was consci
entiously played.
