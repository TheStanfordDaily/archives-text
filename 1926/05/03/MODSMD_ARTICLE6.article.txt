# ENGLISH CLASS WILL GIVE THREE PLAYS IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
Work on the three one-act plays to
be produced Tuesday, May 11, by the
Play Production Class, English 19b, is
continuing rapidly under the direction
of Marion Craig Wentworth, who is
taking Miss Buckingham's place in the
latter's absence. Chief of the plays to
be produced is the "Thrice-Promised
Bride," a Chinese play, written by
Cheng-Chin Hsuing, a Chinese student
in America.
This play has been chosen by critics
to represent China in the collection of
international plays prepared yearly. It
is of interest to note that Mrs. Went- j
worth, while acting as a judge of one- j
act plays several years ago, passed
favorably upon this play, but was over-'
ruled by the other judges. Since that
time, the play chosen as the prize
winner has not been heard of, while
the Chinese play has taken its place
as an excellent work of art.
No other theatre has produced it on
the coast, although it was lately
chosen by the Provincetown Players
as their production. It will be present
ed with Chinese music and the quaint
customs of the Chinese'stake. In China
the property men sit at the back of
the stage, and bring the necessary
properties forward as they are needed.
In conection with the direction of
the "Thrice-Promised Bride," Tso Shih,
of the Stanford Chinese Club, is lend
ing his services. Music for the skit
will be furnished by a three-piece Chi
nese orchestra made up also from the
Chinese Club.
The Stanford Committee on Public
Exercises has taken over the manage
ment of the several plays, and has
planned their presentation in place of
the regular Tuesday evening lecture
for May 11. All who are interested in
the work of the class are invited. No
j admission will be charged.
