# DELTA TAU NINE DEFEATS A. T. O. BY 9 TO 7 SCORE
## Davis Displeased with Large Number of Forfeits in Past Three Weeks 
### 
The intramurai baseball series suf
fered a serious relapse Friday after
noon, with three forfeits. Delta Taus
and A.T.O.'s were the only nines to
play, the former winning 9-7. Alpha
Sigma Phi has not yet organized a
team, and so declared its third default
of the season to Delta Chi; Encina I
forfeited to the Betas, and the Alpha
Delts and Fijis claimed exemption
from their game on account of rushing
activities, and were both declared
losers on a percentage basis.
The intramural sports department,
headed by C. W. Davis, is dissatisfied
with the large number of forfeits
which have occurred this season.
Eighteen out of sixty-three games
scheduled during the past three weeks
of play were won or lost unplayed.
Davis calls to the attention of team
managers the fact that the schedule
represents an agreement to be present
which should not be violated except
for extraordinary reasns, and then not
without advance notice to the oppos
ing team. The series enters into the
next to last week of play today and,
with rushing season at its close, more
enthusiasm should be displayed.
The Delta Tau-A.T.O. contest was
well fought. The A.T.O.'s were leading
7-4 at the beginning of the fifth, but
Delta Tau went to bat and engaged
in a stimulating rally which netted
them five tallies and put the game on
ice. Morrison was the day's hero for
Delta Tau. He took the mound for
Meyer in the third and let the A.T.O.'s
! gather but one run thereafter.
Hitting was quite vicious on both
sides, but the Delta Tau exhibition in
I the fifth provided most of the excite
ment, when Downey and Morrison
each got triples and McGettigan dou
bled. Among the A.T.O.'s Farwell was
prominent with his batting, doubling
I in the first and tripling in the fourth.
Hossam and Tifal are also credited
with doubles. Pegram and Dill com
posed the A.T.O. battery; Myer, Morri
son and James that of Delta Tau.
