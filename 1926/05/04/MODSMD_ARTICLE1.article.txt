# FUND WORKERS START $1,000 CHARITY DRIVE
## Drive Committee Chairman Hopes to Reach Goal By Next Week GOES TO CONVALESCENTS Each Living Group to Have Separate Fund; List to Be Published 
### 
Tomorrow will be the opening day j
for the Stanford Convalescent Home
Appeal which will have as its object
the raising of $1000 on the campus
within the next week. The quota for
Palo Alto and Stanford together is
$7000, of which only $1000 is to come
from actual student subscriptions. The
committee in charge of the Appeal,
headed by Lindsay Winterbotham,
hopes to reach its objective before the
time limit.
The Home is the one distinctively
Stanford charity, according to the com
mittee, being located on the campus
and directly connected with the Lane
Hospital in San Francisco. Last year
the student contributions went over
$1000.
Forty Children Cared For
Forty children are continually under
the care of experienced nurses at the j
home, coming from clinics at the city
and remaining until they have gained
health and strength. The Home last
year spent $33,000 in caring for its |
•charges, and was filled to capacity all
the time. The income last year was |
$31,500, leaving a debt of $1500, which |
it is hoped will be paid off by this
year's subscriptions. Support of the j
Home is mainly through the San Fran-1
cisco Community Chest aided by in-;
terest on an endowment, individual
donations, and contributions from or
•ganizations.
Efficient management has made it i
possible to take care of each child at
a total cost of $2.29 per day, but oper
ating at full capacity the year round ;
as the Home has done, makes neces
sary the maximum support from all
sources.
"If all the members of the student 1
body could make a trip through the
home and see the wonderful work that
is being done, and the sick children
who are regaining health almost vis
ibly, there would be no doubt that our
quota would be filled many times over. I
It is our aim to get some contribution
from every student in the University,"
says Lindsey Winterbotham, chairman
of the committee in charge, which be- J
gan work today.
Other members are Lorraine Cleave
land, Helen Huneke, Lester Gordon,
Louis Lundborg, Kenneth McDougall, |
Sherman Hazeltine, William Fain. I
These students will be in charge of
the collecting, which will be done
through campus organizations rather
than by individuals.
Each campus living and eating
group will have a fund made up of
all the contributions of its members.
A list will be published in the Daily
Palo Alto during the coming week
showing the relative progress of the j
funds.
Those who are unable to make their
contribution through any group may
send a check to the Home made pay-1
able to the Stanford Convalescent I
Home. They will receive a receipt and
have their names added to the regular ;
list of donors for the coming year. !
The coming appeal week will culmi
nate in University Labor Day on May
12 on the grounds of the Home in J
which members of the student body
will adjourn classes for work on the
grounds followed by a barbecue.
"Flaming Feet" are the latest thing
on the campus of Syracuse. Brightly

Those who are unable to make their
contribution through any group may
send a check to the Home made pay-1
able to the Stanford Convalescent I
Home. They will receive a receipt and
have their names added to the regular ;
list of donors for the coming year. !
The coming appeal week will culmi
nate in University Labor Day on May
12 on the grounds of the Home in J
which members of the student body
will adjourn classes for work on the
grounds followed by a barbecue.
"Flaming Feet" are the latest thing
on the campus of Syracuse. Brightly
colored galoshes are the most recent
innovation. 1
Tomorrow will be the opening day j
for the Stanford Convalescent Home
Appeal which will have as its object
the raising of $1000 on the campus
within the next week. The quota for
Palo Alto and Stanford together is
$7000, of which only $1000 is to come
from actual student subscriptions. The
committee in charge of the Appeal,
headed by Lindsay Winterbotham,
hopes to reach its objective before the
time limit.
The Home is the one distinctively
Stanford charity, according to the com
mittee, being located on the campus
and directly connected with the Lane
Hospital in San Francisco. Last year
the student contributions went over
$1000.
Forty Children Cared For
Forty children are continually under
the care of experienced nurses at the j
home, coming from clinics at the city
and remaining until they have gained
health and strength. The Home last
year spent $33,000 in caring for its |
•charges, and was filled to capacity all
the time. The income last year was |
$31,500, leaving a debt of $1500, which |
it is hoped will be paid off by this
year's subscriptions. Support of the j
Home is mainly through the San Fran-1
cisco Community Chest aided by in-;
terest on an endowment, individual
donations, and contributions from or
•ganizations.
Efficient management has made it i
possible to take care of each child at
a total cost of $2.29 per day, but oper
ating at full capacity the year round ;
as the Home has done, makes neces
sary the maximum support from all
sources.
"If all the members of the student 1
body could make a trip through the
home and see the wonderful work that
is being done, and the sick children
who are regaining health almost vis
ibly, there would be no doubt that our
quota would be filled many times over. I
It is our aim to get some contribution
from every student in the University,"
says Lindsey Winterbotham, chairman
of the committee in charge, which be- J
gan work today.
Other members are Lorraine Cleave
land, Helen Huneke, Lester Gordon,
Louis Lundborg, Kenneth McDougall, |
Sherman Hazeltine, William Fain. I
These students will be in charge of
the collecting, which will be done
through campus organizations rather
than by individuals.
Each campus living and eating
group will have a fund made up of
all the contributions of its members.
A list will be published in the Daily
Palo Alto during the coming week
showing the relative progress of the j
funds.
