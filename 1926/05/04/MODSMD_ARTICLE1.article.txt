Tomorrow will be the opening day j
for the Stanford Convalescent Home
Appeal which will have as its object
the raising of $1000 on the campus
within the next week. The quota for
Palo Alto and Stanford together is
$7000, of which only $1000 is to come
from actual student subscriptions. The
committee in charge of the Appeal,
headed by Lindsay Winterbotham,
hopes to reach its objective before the
time limit.
The Home is the one distinctively
Stanford charity, according to the com
mittee, being located on the campus
and directly connected with the Lane
Hospital in San Francisco. Last year
the student contributions went over
$1000.
Forty Children Cared For
Forty children are continually under
the care of experienced nurses at the j
home, coming from clinics at the city
and remaining until they have gained
health and strength. The Home last
year spent $33,000 in caring for its |
•charges, and was filled to capacity all
the time. The income last year was |
$31,500, leaving a debt of $1500, which |
it is hoped will be paid off by this
year's subscriptions. Support of the j
Home is mainly through the San Fran-1
cisco Community Chest aided by in-;
terest on an endowment, individual
donations, and contributions from or
•ganizations.
Efficient management has made it i
possible to take care of each child at
a total cost of $2.29 per day, but oper
ating at full capacity the year round ;
