unanimously by the Fortnight Club of
Palo Alto at a meeting at which a re
j port of the concerts was given by Mrs.

I cessitated the sale of practically every
j seat in order to avoid indebtedness,
the Fortnight Club voted to continue
the recitals during the coming year.
Mrs. Mitchell, in submitting a sketch
of the origin, activities, and plans of
,' the association, told of its organiza
> tion fourteen years ago through the
efforts of the members of the Fort
j nightly Music Club, one of whose ob
jects is the promotion of love of music
i and of opportunities for hearing good
music in the community. The forty
club members secured subscriptions
for the Peninsula Association by mak
( ing a personal house-to-house canvass
I of the Palo Alto district. Concerts have
, â–  been sponsored each year since that
I j time.
( I A report submitted to the Fortnight-
( 1 ly Club Monday evening, April 26,
, showed that 1100 seats were sub
( scribed for at the evening of the
'Johnson-Ruth concert, and that since
, that time subscription cards have been
T sent, to former members and new peo-
I pie whose names have been sent to
j the secretary. An early response to
i these cards is hoped for. With these
facts in view, the Fortnightly Club
unanimously voted to continue the con
. certs for the season 1926-27.
