# FRATERNITY BODY BANS LAST-MINUTE RUSHING EFFORTS
## BIDDING IS FROM 1 TO 5 Houses Breaking Regulation Tomorrow to Be Denied Pledging Rights 
### 
Drastic measures will be em
ployed to prevent last-minute vio
lation of rushing rules, according
to Frank Frye, president of the
Interfraternity Council. Any fra
ternity whose members are seen in
company with prospective pledges
will be denied the privilege of
pledging those students. Since to
morrow is a closed date the Coun
cil also forbids any fraternity
members to frequent the Union to- j
morrow afternoon.
Bidding will be from 1 to 5 o'clock j
tomorrow afternoon in the student
manager's office of the Old Union. In- j
dividual cards have been sent to each i
freshman with an appointed time for
consulting the Interfraternity Council's !
lawyer within the bidding hours. Dur
ing his appointment each freshman!
will indicate to the lawyer the choice j
of his house, and will then go immedi- i
to his chosen fraternity.
Dates with freshmen tonight mustj
end promptly at 8 o'clock, according 1
to Frye, who emphasizes the necessity!
for keeping the closed hours from this '
time until after bidding. The Council,
which will keep watch for any viola
tion of these hours, requests fraternity |
men to keep away from the Union dur
ing bidding. Frye asks that any ques- j
tions regarding pledging or bidding be
referred to him.
Lists of freshmen bid by each fra
ternity were sent in to the Council last i
night and tabulated for reference at!
bidding tomorrow. A total of 183 fresh-!
men, with 14 undecided, were pledged
by the twenty-four Stanford fraterni
ties last year.
