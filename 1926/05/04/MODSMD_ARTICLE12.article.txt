## 
### 
Freshman women swimmers deci-|
I sively defeated the juniors by a score !
■of 39V£ to in the first interclass
1 meet of the year. Though the juniors
took half of the first places the
j freshmen won out with their second
i and third-place points.
Clarita Hunsberger, captain of the
| juniors, was high-point winner with
; thirteen points. She won first in the
| plunge and diving, and took second in
the 25-yard free style. Rosalie Walters j
! and Sallie Miller, freshmen, came next |
; with eleven and ten points respec-;
! tively.
Miss Miller won the 25-yard free 1
style in fast time, and stands a good
chance of taking the event in the com
ing Field Day meet. Her first in the
75-yard free style also gives the fresh-1
men a chance to get some points in
that event in the final meet.
Jean Armes, freshman captain,
I brought in points for her team in the
25-yard free style, 75-yard free style,
| and relay. Rosalie Walters swam well
|in the 50-yard free style, leading:
i throughout the race and being at no j
time pressed.
Chances of a freshman victory on
Field Day looked quite bright after
yesterday's meet.
The juniors' inability to take second
and third places gave the freshmen a
large lead early in the meet which
was never threatened.
Tomorrow the sophomores meet the
seniors. Each class meets the other
three in dual meets to be run off dur- i
ing the next three weeks. Standing for
the cup will be determined only by
the results of the meet on Field Day,
though points won in these dual meets
will count towards the selection of
the All-Star team.

25-yard free style won by Miller (F),
| Hunsberger (J) second, Armes (F).
Breast stroke- won by Jordan (J), j
j Duryea (disqualified).

Freshman women swimmers deci-|
I sively defeated the juniors by a score !
■of 39V£ to in the first interclass
1 meet of the year. Though the juniors
took half of the first places the
j freshmen won out with their second
i and third-place points.
Clarita Hunsberger, captain of the
| juniors, was high-point winner with
; thirteen points. She won first in the
| plunge and diving, and took second in
the 25-yard free style. Rosalie Walters j
! and Sallie Miller, freshmen, came next |
; with eleven and ten points respec-;
! tively.
Miss Miller won the 25-yard free 1
style in fast time, and stands a good
chance of taking the event in the com
ing Field Day meet. Her first in the
75-yard free style also gives the fresh-1
men a chance to get some points in
that event in the final meet.
Jean Armes, freshman captain,
I brought in points for her team in the
25-yard free style, 75-yard free style,
| and relay. Rosalie Walters swam well
|in the 50-yard free style, leading:
i throughout the race and being at no j
time pressed.
Chances of a freshman victory on
Field Day looked quite bright after
yesterday's meet.
The juniors' inability to take second
and third places gave the freshmen a
large lead early in the meet which
was never threatened.
Tomorrow the sophomores meet the
seniors. Each class meets the other
three in dual meets to be run off dur- i
ing the next three weeks. Standing for
the cup will be determined only by
the results of the meet on Field Day,
though points won in these dual meets
will count towards the selection of
the All-Star team.
