Members of the cast of the
Junior Opera, "Ride a Cock-
Horse," are indignant at the slur
ring remarks that have circulated
on the campus about certain
"Sheiks" who have been seen
traversing the Quad with would
be sideburns adorning their
cheeks.
The men wish the students to
know that they are not sheiks, j
but that they are great, big, i
strong, medieval men of the Eng- j
land of a century ago. Sideburns
were then in vogue, just as much
as they were five years ago, but
they did not denote that the
wearer thereof was out to im
press the feminine members of
society with their beauty.
As a matter of fact, it is stated
that the razors weren't all they
should be in those days and every
bit of hair that could be left on
the face was just that much more
of a protection against a chance
of cutting the cutaneous mem
branes below.
