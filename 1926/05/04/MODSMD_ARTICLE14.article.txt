# VARSITY BALL TEAM WILL PLAY TWELVE CONTESTS IN JAPAN
## Cardinal Nine Guests of Waseda University on Oriental Tour 
### 
Under the leadership of Coach Harry
Wolter the Stanford varsity ball team
on its trip to Japan will play twelve
games on the island, preceded by four J
contests planned in the Hawaiian j
Islands where the players will stop for i
several days. The previous notice that |
the squad is making the trip as guests
of the Imperial Japanese government i
was erroneous; the Waseda University j
; of Tokio was instrumental in arrang- j
i ing for the Cards to come on the barn- !
i storming expedition.
Thirteen men, to be selected in the
i early part of June, will leave here on
June 8 for the Hawaiian Islands, where
! their first games will take place. In !
Japan itself seven games are planned
in Tokyo, and five in Osaka. There is
also a possibility that four additional
contests will be scheduled in Man-
I churia.
The Waseda University has a ball
team which is planning a tour of the
United States next year, and plans a
two-game series with the Cards here â€¢
at that time. Iso Abe, director of the
Waseda ball team, has sent final con
firmation of the arrangements for the !
Stanford trip.
The players will be gone for a total
of three months, returning to the
j United States on September 3. Final
; examinations will be given on the boat
j while enroute to Hawaii through Coach
| Harry W T olter.
Wolter is at present managing a |
semi-pro ball team in Idaho. He will j
; be back about the end of the month, i
Tom Quinn, Stanford baseball man-
I ager, is handling arrangements here.
