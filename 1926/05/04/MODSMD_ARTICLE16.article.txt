### 
Yesterday's intramural results:
Kappa Sigma 9, Sigma Chi 5.
El Tigre 11, Phi Delta Theta 1.
Encina 111 defaulted to Los Arcos.
Encina IV defaulted to Delta
Kappa Epsilon.
A brace of good, old-fashioned hits
in the lucky seventh put Kappa Sigma
in the lead and enabled them to win
yesterday rrom Sigma Chi, 9-5, in a
zippy ball game marking the opening
of the fourth week of intramural play.
Dryden, Sigma Chi moundsman, held
the opposition to three runs until the
last inning, and with the score 5-3 In
his team's favor, settled into the box
to polish off the game with a trio of
strikeouts.
Instead, however, Farish burnt out
a fast grounder through short, and
was advanced to third by Shipkey's
double to left field. Farwell flied out,
Stevens hit, and Southworth cleaned
the bases with a double. Hamilton was
hit by a pitched ball and took first,
Conover was out, Larsen to Snook,
and then Newkirk emptied the bags
again with a two-base hit and stole
home himself before Moore retired the
side.
Sigma Chi tried vainly to rally in
the last of the seventh, but after Lar
sen reached first it was "one, two.
