# KAPPA SIGMAS WIN GAME IN LUCKY SEVENTH
## Dryden Blows Up, Allowing Kappa Sigma Team to Score Heavily MORE DEFAULTS OCCUR El Tigre Swamps Phi Delt Ball Nine in Loosely Played Game 
### 
Yesterday's intramural results:
Kappa Sigma 9, Sigma Chi 5.
El Tigre 11, Phi Delta Theta 1.
Encina 111 defaulted to Los Arcos.
Encina IV defaulted to Delta
Kappa Epsilon.
A brace of good, old-fashioned hits
in the lucky seventh put Kappa Sigma
in the lead and enabled them to win
yesterday rrom Sigma Chi, 9-5, in a
zippy ball game marking the opening
of the fourth week of intramural play.
Dryden, Sigma Chi moundsman, held
the opposition to three runs until the
last inning, and with the score 5-3 In
his team's favor, settled into the box
to polish off the game with a trio of
strikeouts.
Instead, however, Farish burnt out
a fast grounder through short, and
was advanced to third by Shipkey's
double to left field. Farwell flied out,
Stevens hit, and Southworth cleaned
the bases with a double. Hamilton was
hit by a pitched ball and took first,
Conover was out, Larsen to Snook,
and then Newkirk emptied the bags
again with a two-base hit and stole
home himself before Moore retired the
side.
Sigma Chi tried vainly to rally in
the last of the seventh, but after Lar
sen reached first it was "one, two.
three," and out they went. The second
j and third were Sigma Chi's big in
nings. Coleman and Ramsey, both of
whom had walked, scored on Staub's
triple in the second. The next time
at bat Dryden, Walker, and Larsen
crossed the plate, ending the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Moore pitched good ball for the win
ners, tightening up after the third to
j help his teammates overcome the two
run lead against them. Dryden looked
like the day's winner, though, until the
Kappa Sigs found him in the seventh.
Phi Delts Lose
El Tigre completely swamped the
Phi Delt team, the team which last
week ran away with the strong Deke
squad when, by heavy hitting and
close fielding, the eating club chalked
up a score of 11 to 1. Runners in last
year's play, El Tigre, bids fair to come
through even stronger this year,
Coming up behind a slight Phi Delt
lead, gained by a run brought in by
Kenney; the El Tigre came in strong
| in the second, third, and fourth, scor
ing a total of ten runs and nine hits.
Taylor, Brown, and Prisinzano ac-
counted for most of the winning runs.
The pitching of Hunter proved ef
fective in shutting out Phi Delt hits.
In the sixth, with two men on base
j and one out, Hunter showed up par
ticularly well by cutting off a Phi Delt
rally with two fans. Thompson at catch
and Taylor at first likewise, played
good ball with a minimum of errors.
Reynolds and David served as the
Phi Delt battery. The fraternity
team's playing was very loose and was
characterized by numerous errors.
Los Arcos won from Encina IV by
forfeit.

strikeouts.
Instead, however, Farish burnt out
a fast grounder through short, and
was advanced to third by Shipkey's
double to left field. Farwell flied out,
Stevens hit, and Southworth cleaned
the bases with a double. Hamilton was
hit by a pitched ball and took first,
Conover was out, Larsen to Snook,
and then Newkirk emptied the bags
again with a two-base hit and stole
home himself before Moore retired the
side.
Sigma Chi tried vainly to rally in
the last of the seventh, but after Lar
sen reached first it was "one, two.
three," and out they went. The second
j and third were Sigma Chi's big in
nings. Coleman and Ramsey, both of
whom had walked, scored on Staub's
triple in the second. The next time
at bat Dryden, Walker, and Larsen
crossed the plate, ending the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Moore pitched good ball for the win
ners, tightening up after the third to
j help his teammates overcome the two
run lead against them. Dryden looked
like the day's winner, though, until the
Kappa Sigs found him in the seventh.
Phi Delts Lose
El Tigre completely swamped the
Phi Delt team, the team which last
week ran away with the strong Deke
squad when, by heavy hitting and
close fielding, the eating club chalked
up a score of 11 to 1. Runners in last
year's play, El Tigre, bids fair to come
through even stronger this year,
Coming up behind a slight Phi Delt
lead, gained by a run brought in by
Kenney; the El Tigre came in strong
| in the second, third, and fourth, scor
ing a total of ten runs and nine hits.
Taylor, Brown, and Prisinzano ac-
counted for most of the winning runs.
The pitching of Hunter proved ef
fective in shutting out Phi Delt hits.
In the sixth, with two men on base
j and one out, Hunter showed up par
ticularly well by cutting off a Phi Delt
rally with two fans. Thompson at catch
and Taylor at first likewise, played
good ball with a minimum of errors.
Reynolds and David served as the
Phi Delt battery. The fraternity
team's playing was very loose and was
characterized by numerous errors.
Los Arcos won from Encina IV by
forfeit.

A brace of good, old-fashioned hits
in the lucky seventh put Kappa Sigma
in the lead and enabled them to win
yesterday rrom Sigma Chi, 9-5, in a
zippy ball game marking the opening
of the fourth week of intramural play.
Dryden, Sigma Chi moundsman, held
the opposition to three runs until the
last inning, and with the score 5-3 In
his team's favor, settled into the box
to polish off the game with a trio of
strikeouts.
