# EDUCATION DIRECTOR DECLARES GRADUATE TRAINING NECESSARY
## 
### 
"While college graduation and a
year of graduate work was once desir
able for a senior high school teacher,
it is now a necessary prerequisite,"
declared Joseph Marr Gwinn, Super
intendent of San Francisco Schools,
speaking before the Education Club
last night on the topic, "Higher Edu
cational and Professional Standards
for Senior High School Teachers."
The greatest problem of modern
education is "What will happen when
the new curriculum is put into the
hands of old teachers?" The introduc
tion of businesslike methods into
senior high schools has brought the
need of a new type of teacher, not so
much with a higher standard but a
different one. Every teacher should
realize the relationship of his work to
that of other members of the faculty;
lie should accept the fact that he is a
worker in group production. He should
j also try to have more contact with the
! outside world.
| "It has been agreed by California
| high school principals that there
i should be more practice teaching, and
j more time spent in trying to under-
I stand students," said Gwinn. "Too lit
i tie account is taken of the state's need
for specialized service. At Stanford
j University, and at the Universities of
I California. Washington, and Oregon,
there are relatively too many prepar
i ing to teach the social sciences, Latin,
and mathematics, while there are too
few who are taking up manual and
household arts, physical training, and
music. In the state of California last
j year forty-eight per cent of the new
I teachers were assigned to teach sub
jects for which they were unprepared.
This condition is undoubtedly the
same throughout the nation as a
whole."
New teachers were said to be under
, several disadvantages: they are placed
in small schools where they have to
teach three or four subjects; they have
to submit to the priority of older
teachers, and as a result, the group
is an itinerant one.
Gwinn concluded by saying, "The
i service of high school teachers may
be adjusted and extended if they learn
to co-operate with the faculty and the
outside world; to stop the tendency
to wander from school to school; and
j to obtain not further education, but
.education of a different, highly spe
cialized type."
