# The 						Wooden Indian

### 
Ten years ago one might easily believe that all property missing from
Palo Alto, Mayfield. or surrounding villages could be traced immediately
to a hall or fraternity living room. It seemed "Ye Goode Old Custom" in
"Ye Goode Old Daves" to appropriate the cigar store Indian and the
saloon sign for futuristic decoration.
Now one is inclined to doubt the insinuation of a Redwood City paper
that a wooden policeman, which formerly attracted clients to a certain
real estate office in that fair city, "is now standing guard in some hall or
fraternity house at a well-known university not far from here." Three
guesses can be taken concerning the identity of that university and all
three will point to Stanford. In a way we do not blame the editor of that
article for turning in this direction for the recovery of the missing totem
for at one time he would be justified in believing Stanford to be the source
of such trouble. In fact, if one were to tour Encina hall, either on the
outside or inside, he would find at the present time considerable evidence
of midnight raids upon nearby places of business.
But not all residents of the University are either back in the dark ages
of a decade ago or still in that juvenile age so essential to midnight raids,
ll is certain that more than a creditable majority of students living in halls,
other than Encina, and nearly all fraternity men no longer look with favor
upon such appropriation, as they are credited with by the Redwood City
paper. Ideas of living and proper action change with ideas of proper
dress, and one should give Stanford credit for an onward march in the
direction of sane conduct.
The invention of the word "collegiate" has perhaps aided in this
change. "Collegiate" dress, living, and actions are frowned upon and
while the various interpretations of what is "collegiate" are as many as the
blades of grass, still the practice of midnight appropriation is universally
regarded as childish and collegiate.
