# AMERICAN COLLEGE PROFESSORS OBJECT TO STUDENT MORALS
## 
### 
A complaint charging intercollegiate
football as conducive to drinking,
gambling, and dishonesty among stu
dents has beer, launched by a com
mittee of the American Association of
University Professors.
The report of the committee on
methods of increasing the intellectual
interests and raising the intellectual
standards of undergraduates is pub
lished in the Association's April bul
letin.
Limitation of student participation
in intercollegiate football to one year
is advocated in the report, in addition
to the adoption of faculty coaching
systems conducted by men of charac
ter and personal influence. Football,
while admitted a good sport, is criti
cized mainly because its present ex
cess has demoralized student bodies,
according to the committee.
Professor Ernest W. Wilkins of the
University of Chicago heads the com
mittee, which recommends that repre
sentatives from various colleges form
a committee with a view to adopting a
general plan which may be put in oper
ation before the opening of the foot
ball season next fall.
