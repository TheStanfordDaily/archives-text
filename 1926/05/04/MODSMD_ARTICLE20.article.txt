Harvard has taken a considerable beating the past few years—for one
thing or another. But insult has I>een added to injury by the release of a
motion picture version of "Brown of Harvard," a play which when staged
in Boston in 190/ precipitated a small riot. The author, one must re
member was a Radcliffe student. Donald Ogden Stewart, famous Ameri
can satirist, who adapted the play to the silver sheet was formerly a Yale
undergraduate; and we dare say that few of the actors have anything but
a passing knowledge of the Yard.
In the words of the New Student, the photoplay is an "impression of
Harvard life bv, not only one, but many who have never been there. "It
has been flashed on the screen at the Harvard Union where it was indig
nantly received; and soon it is to be presented in Boston. 1 here is some
chance that there will be rioting similar to that of 1907; however, it is
pointed out that the undergraduates should appreciate the futility of hurl
ing edibles at mere images.
All things considered we wonder not that the sons of the Crimson are
taking the matter seriously. They no doubt, all of them, were highly
amused on viewing Harold Lloyd in "The Freshman '; but 1 ate College is
not Harvard University, any more than Brown is a real Harvard "under
grad." We have not had the opportunity of seeing the latest college
movie; but reviews and descriptions indicate clearly that the joke is on
Harvard, perhaps placed intentionally, perhaps unintentionally.
The rest of us guys can sit back and laugh.
