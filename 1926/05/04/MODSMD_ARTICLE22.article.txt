NOT SO MUCH THE FALL AS THE SUDDEN STOP
The following, which shows the origin of the world's oldest chestnut, is the
brain-child of the judge who presided over the United States district court,
Eastern District of New York in 1898.
It appears that one John J. King, a stevedore, brought an action against the
steamship Strabo for personal injuries received when a ladder, up which he was
walking to the ship's deck, slipped and dropped him to the dock.
"From this statement," was the court's subtle observation, "it is in
ferred that physical injury was caused the libellant by his fall, which
was increased by his striking the dock."

THE BATTLE
The time is come when-all the boys
Are running wildly to and fro
To annex dates, coupes and coin
Wherewith the Junior Prom to go.
i
No simple line will get by here
One has to be a diplomat
To rustle forth a chariot
Sufficient gas, and things like that.
The studies slide and slip and skid
Ye campus Drybawle rates full high
Though 011 this week he hardly works
Vet with a heavy crash gets by.
The telephones in each Greek house
Each hall, each humble student's cot,
Are ringing wildly, night and day
Meanwhile, the l)ooks go heeded not.
I
The night has come, a sabbath calm
Pervades the campus all its length—
The struggle all is over but
The fiercer battle looms in strength.
The music starts, the dance is on—
In taxis wild-eyed young men gaze
Upon their watches, but they wait
A good while outside in a daze.
The dance—can't tell about it here
We hope it's hot—it ought to be,
With full ten thousand kilowatts
Of student energy let free.
—F. T. M.
