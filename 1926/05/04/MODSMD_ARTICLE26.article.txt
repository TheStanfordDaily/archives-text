# EXPERIENCES OF TRIP RECORDED BY QUAYLE
## 
### 
Experiences during a trip to the
South Sea islands are recorded in the
"Scientific Journal" of Ernest H.
Quayle, '25, the original of which the
author has given to the library. The
diary is in 35 small notebooks, one of
which is missing, but will be supplied
later. The notes were taken during the
Whitney South Sea expedition, sent
out by the American Museum of Na
tural History in New York from Sep
tember 1920 to January 31, 1923, on
the S.S. "France."
Quayle includes in his diary accounts
of native ways, records of plants seen,
sketches of plants and places, and the
story of his own activities.
Quayle was registered at Stanford
in the English department in 1916-17.
The following year he changed his
major to botany. In 1920 he left the
University to go with the Whitney
party to the South Seas. Returning in
1923, he completed his work in 1925.
