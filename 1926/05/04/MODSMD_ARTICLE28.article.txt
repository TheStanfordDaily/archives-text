### 
Thirty million is the average
number of germs inhabiting a
pair of dirty cords, according to
a senior student of sanitary en
gineering who has conducted
scientific research upon this sub
ject at the University of Cali
fornia.
A pair of traditional upperclass
trousers that had not been
cleaned for five months was used
for the experiment. The method
employed was similar to that
used by the bacteriologist for
bureau of sanitary engineering of
the state board of health. The
samples were washed 250 times
in bottles containing 100 centi
meters of sterile water. One centi
meter from each bottle was ex
amined and the number of germs
counted.
Three pieces of cloth cut from
the cords yielded an average of
20,000 bacteria per square inch.
The cords contained 1500 square
inches of cloth, the student esti
mated, making a total of 30,000,-
000 germs.
