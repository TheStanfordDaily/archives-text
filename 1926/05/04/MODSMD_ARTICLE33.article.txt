# COLLEGE TRAINING CLAIMED USEFUL IN THEATRICAL WORK
## 
### 
College training is a valuable pre
paration for the theatrical profession,
according to Lee Shubert, producer,
who discusses the matter in the Cor
nell Daily Sun. The majority of the i
men and women connected with the j
theatre, whether they be authors, pro- ;
ducers, stage technicians, or what not,
are found to be college graduates. This
does not imply that a college diploma
is essential to success in the show
business but, as in all professions, the
man who is best trained and edacated
has the mo.it promising chance of
reaching the top.
Colleges, next to professional train
ing schools, offer the student the best l
opportunity to study the secrets of the j
theatre. The careers of some of the
foremost men in the profession began
in college dramatic societies, says Mr.
Shubert.
Speaking of the influence which col
leges exert on the theatre, the pro-!
ducer declares, "College-bred audi
ences demand finer acting, finer plays,'
finer scenery. They put the producer j
to the task of searching the four cor
ners of the globe 111 an effort to satisfy |
these demands."
The morality of the stage and of the !
world he believes to be as sound and |
firm as it ever was, if not more so.
