# College Magazine Started At University of Oregon
## 
### 
After four years without a campus
periodical other than the Year Book,
the University of Oregon will com
mence a real college magazine, the
first issue to appear next fall. This
action was taken recently by the
executive council due to a large num
ber of petitions from fraternities and
campus organizations for the publica
tion of a new campus magazine.
