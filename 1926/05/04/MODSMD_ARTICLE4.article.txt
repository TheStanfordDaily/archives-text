# REDSHIRT POLO PLAYERS TRAIN FOR ARIZONA TILT
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Stanford meets the University of
Arizona polo squad in a two-game
series, which will be played on the
Highway field at 2:30 o'clock Thurs
day and Saturday. Admission will be
charged for these contests, the price
being fifty cents for general admission,
and twenty-five cents for students with
A.S.S.U. cards. Bleachers have been
constructed in anticipation of a rec
ord crowd.
The Arizona team has an enviable
record behind it, and has always suc
ceeded in defeating former Cardinal
fours. The odds are again in favor of
the invading players, for with the ab
sence of Captain Fred Trotter from
the lineup, the Stanford team is some
what weakened. Adding to this the
fact that the Arizona team boasts the
so-called "Greatest Collegian" in
Jimmy Hearon, the playing promises
to be fast and furious.
