# REDSHIRT POLO PLAYERS TRAIN FOR ARIZONA TILT
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Stanford meets the University of
Arizona polo squad in a two-game
series, which will be played on the
Highway field at 2:30 o'clock Thurs
day and Saturday. Admission will be
charged for these contests, the price
being fifty cents for general admission,
and twenty-five cents for students with
A.S.S.U. cards. Bleachers have been
constructed in anticipation of a rec
ord crowd.
The Arizona team has an enviable
record behind it, and has always suc
ceeded in defeating former Cardinal
fours. The odds are again in favor of
the invading players, for with the ab
sence of Captain Fred Trotter from
the lineup, the Stanford team is some
what weakened. Adding to this the
fact that the Arizona team boasts the
so-called "Greatest Collegian" in
Jimmy Hearon, the playing promises
to be fast and furious.

The Arizona squad members ar
rived on the campus yesterday, and
will stay at fraternity houses during
their visit. They will go through sev
eral workouts in order to become ac
customed to the Stanford horses,
which they will ride.
Polo was started at Stanford by
Major Leroy Collins, in 1921, assisted
by Captain Charles Boyle. Major Coi
lins is at present at Fort Sill, Okla
-1 homa, while Captain Boyle plays for
' the 76th Field Artillery at Monterey.
Captain John Jenkins coached the
squad in 1924, and since this time
Lieutenant Charles Whitmore has
been in charge.
The strength of the team this year
] was lessened by the injury of Captain
Fred Trotter, who broke his arm the
j day before the first game of the sea
son. Trotter, captain of the team, and
star No. 4 man, showed exceptional
ability during the 1924-25 season, and
his loss to the squad is felt. Later in
the year Trotter's arm permitted him
to play, but another accident fractured
it again.
Lineup Chosen
The lineup for the contests will be
as follows: Kenneth Krohn will start
as No. 1 man. Krohn is in his first
year of varsity competition, although
he has had a great deal of polo ex
perience during the past. He is a sure
hitter and is expected to star in both
the Arizona and Oregon series.
No. 2 position will be filled by C. O.
Thompson. Thompson is noticeable for
having had the speediest development
of any man on the squad. He is an ex
cellent horseman and the fact that he
can get the most out of his ponies,
coupled with his hitting and hard rid
ing ability, makes him an opponent
to be feared at all times in the game.
Lyall C. Vanderburgh, who played
on the Stanford team with the famous
Barby brothers, will play No. 3. Van
derburgh is considered the star of the
squad since Trotter dropped from the
running. Much is expected of him in
the way of brilliant offensive and de
fensive play during the games Thurs
day and Saturday. He is particularly
adept in under-the-neck shots, which
drive the ball out of dangerous terri
tory toward the sideboards.
Whether or not Kenenth C. Brown
can fill the shoes of Captain Fred
Trotter at No. 4 is at present a ques
tion. Brown was shifted to this posi
tion from another place on the team,
and has had but little time to learn
the play of his new position. His abil
ity at clever guarding of the goal is
expected to cut down the scoring of
the fast Arizona forwards.
Stanford substitutes include George
Baker, Lawrence Weymouth, Wallace
Rothrock, W. I. Hollingsworth, T. E.
Austin, and F. S. Trieste.
The Stanford squad has been primed
for the Arizona tilts, since this series
and the one with Oregon Agricultural
College on May 14 and 15 are the
games for which the season's work is
directed. Next Tuesday the squad will
leave for Corvallis to meet the Aggie
four.

Stanford meets the University of

The Arizona team has an enviable

The Arizona squad members ar
rived on the campus yesterday, and
will stay at fraternity houses during
their visit. They will go through sev
eral workouts in order to become ac
customed to the Stanford horses,
which they will ride.
Polo was started at Stanford by
Major Leroy Collins, in 1921, assisted
by Captain Charles Boyle. Major Coi
lins is at present at Fort Sill, Okla
-1 homa, while Captain Boyle plays for
' the 76th Field Artillery at Monterey.
Captain John Jenkins coached the
squad in 1924, and since this time
Lieutenant Charles Whitmore has
been in charge.
The strength of the team this year
] was lessened by the injury of Captain
Fred Trotter, who broke his arm the
j day before the first game of the sea
son. Trotter, captain of the team, and
star No. 4 man, showed exceptional
ability during the 1924-25 season, and
his loss to the squad is felt. Later in
the year Trotter's arm permitted him
to play, but another accident fractured
it again.
Lineup Chosen
The lineup for the contests will be
as follows: Kenneth Krohn will start
as No. 1 man. Krohn is in his first
year of varsity competition, although
he has had a great deal of polo ex
perience during the past. He is a sure
hitter and is expected to star in both
the Arizona and Oregon series.
No. 2 position will be filled by C. O.
Thompson. Thompson is noticeable for
having had the speediest development
of any man on the squad. He is an ex
cellent horseman and the fact that he
can get the most out of his ponies,
coupled with his hitting and hard rid
ing ability, makes him an opponent
to be feared at all times in the game.
Lyall C. Vanderburgh, who played
on the Stanford team with the famous
Barby brothers, will play No. 3. Van
derburgh is considered the star of the
squad since Trotter dropped from the
running. Much is expected of him in
the way of brilliant offensive and de
fensive play during the games Thurs
day and Saturday. He is particularly
adept in under-the-neck shots, which
drive the ball out of dangerous terri
tory toward the sideboards.
Whether or not Kenenth C. Brown
can fill the shoes of Captain Fred
Trotter at No. 4 is at present a ques
tion. Brown was shifted to this posi
tion from another place on the team,
and has had but little time to learn
the play of his new position. His abil
ity at clever guarding of the goal is
expected to cut down the scoring of
the fast Arizona forwards.
Stanford substitutes include George
Baker, Lawrence Weymouth, Wallace
Rothrock, W. I. Hollingsworth, T. E.
Austin, and F. S. Trieste.
The Stanford squad has been primed
for the Arizona tilts, since this series
and the one with Oregon Agricultural
College on May 14 and 15 are the
games for which the season's work is
directed. Next Tuesday the squad will
leave for Corvallis to meet the Aggie
