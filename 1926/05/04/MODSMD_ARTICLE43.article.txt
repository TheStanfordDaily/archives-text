## Anything Can Happen in Golf 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Anything can happen in golf" â€”and there is no other game in which so
many extraordinary, humorous, and interesting things do happen as in the
ancient and honorable pastime.
William Bullock and "Smoky Joe" Wood, formerly a star pitcher, were
having a friendly game of golf last July at Port Jervis, N.Y. The match was
close, and, as it happened, the result depended on a putt on the fifth green.
Bill Bullock, who is publicity director of the New York County Republican
Committee, was all set up to tap his ball a mere matter of twelve inches into
the cup when the ferocious roar of a lion suddenly rent the air, making Bill
miss. The King of Beasts which won the match for "Smoky Joe" was in the
Port Jervis little Coney Island just across a river from the fifth green, and out
of sight behind some thick woods.
Birds often carry off golf balls, sometimes actually dropping them onto the
green for a lucky player. At the Princess Anne Country Club, Norfolk, Va., the
players actually have to run, after making their shots, to get to the balls
before the crows do. One man followed a thieving crow to its net and there
discovered forty golf balls! Last year State Senator J. S. Barron, a former
Virginia golf champion, was playing for a medal score and was one under par
when lost a stroke when a crow picked up his ball.
The woman player at the Shawnee Club who took 166 strokes on one hole,
yet qualified, got in not only because of her determination, but also because
there were only sixteen entries, with special qualifying prizes for each one.
When she finally got the ball out of the river, she was more than a mile
downstream, and had to play back through a thick wood.
