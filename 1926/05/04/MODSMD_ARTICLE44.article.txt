# New Rule at Washington Requires Lights on Canoes
## 
### 
Canoe spooners at the University of
Washington are reported to be all
stirred up over the recent ruling of
the United States Bureau of Naviga
tion that canoes must display red
lights in navigable waters. Those who
avail themselves of the privacy of
Lake Washington for spring wooing
purposes have gone on record against
the edict and declare the ruling an
abridgement of their individual
"rights."
