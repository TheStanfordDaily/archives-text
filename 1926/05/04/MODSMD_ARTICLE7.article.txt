An exhibition of water-colors by
Miss Enid Kinney, of San Jose, who
was formerly Superviser of Art at j
the San Jose State Teachers College,
was put on display at the Art Gallery
; yesterday.
During the summer of 1925, after
' a travel through Egypt and Palestine,
Miss Kinney visited France, Belgium,
and England. It was during her visit
! in these European countries that she
' painted the water-colors which are be
; ing shown. They are done in a direct
' style, in transparent color, an extreme
ly desirable effect in a water-color
j picture.
Works by Miss Kinney have been
on exhibit at the Art Gallery before,
' and one can note the change in tech
nique since her past exhibitions, in
that her work in the latest exhibit has
been done more freely. Of the two
methods used in water-color, that of
applying the paint on a dry surface,
; or employing the wet wash principle,
| Miss Kinney has chosen the dry sur
face method for her pictures.
Her collection contains many for
-1 eign views, done in strikingly bright
colors, of such places as Bruges, Cairo,
Brittany, and London. There are also
a number of sea pictures in the dis
play. Miss Kinney has produced some
excellent water effects, and has used
every interesting color combination
together with her unusual application
of them. One does not appreciate the
i full beauty of the work, however, in
just a casual glance at the colelction;
the pictures are seen at their best
: when the observer is far enough away
| from them to comprehend the exqui
site blending of the colors.
