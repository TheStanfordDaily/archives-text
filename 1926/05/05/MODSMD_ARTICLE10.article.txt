# Construction Of Roman Aqueducts Shown By Ashby

Illustrating with slides the courses i
of several aqueducts entering Rome, |
Thomas Ashby, distinguished English |
archaeologist, who lectured on "The j
Aqueducts of Ancient Rome" last j
night, explained the routes, composi
tion, and structure of such aqueducts !
as the Aqua Marcia and the Aqua j
Appia.
The Aqua Marcia, constructed in j
144 8.C., had its source in the springs :
between Tivoli and Subiaco, and is
sixty-two miles in length. The greater
part of the Aqua Marcia is under-1
j ground. Long stretches are on arches, j
j some of which bear parts of two or ;
three other aqueducts above them,
i Eleven aqueducts built between 312
I B.C. when the first one, the Aqua j
! Appia, was constructed, and 226 A.D., j
i the date of the construction of the |
! most recent one, the Aqua Alexan-;
j drina, entered Rome. The water sup- j
plied by the aqueducts was adequate '
, for that period, and much of the vast
; water supply of the city was expended
| on fountains and public baths.
Aqueducts Circuitous
The first aqueducts which are much !
longer than those of a later period
j followed circuitous routes, because it
was difficult to excavate in hard rock, j
; Aqueducts of the earlier times were
j usually sixty miles in length, while the
I succeeding water carriers were com- j
monly forty miles long. The fall from
! the source of the water supply to the [
{ city was ordinarily about one thousand
j feet.
Slides showing the broken and I
j crumbling arches indicated the pic
turesqueness of the ruins. Pictures of
j the subterranean passages of the aque-1
, ducts illustrated the fact that lime
j deposits decreased the size of the
i underground sections.
! Early aqueducts were built of rough-;
! hewn dimension stone, while the more j
i recent ones are constructed of con-1
I crete and brick. From time to time
| buttresses were added to the aqueducts ,
j in order to strengthen them after they ,
j had been weakened by years of use. i
j Concrete facing was also added to
j some of the ancient water carriers.
