# A 						CAPELLA SINGERS PRESENT HISTORICAL TRADITION IN MUSIC
## 
### 
!
Modern representatives of an his
j torical tradition in music are the
i singers of the Smallraan A Capella
| Choir which will be heard in the As- j
| sembly hall May 17 under the auspices
;of the Stanford Glee Club. This or
i ganization is one of the foremost ex- j
i ponents of the art of unaccompanied
1 choral singing in the country, and is
I declared by critics to possess the pre- j
i cision, purity of tone, and sense of
j absolute pitch which characterized the
j singing of the choirs which were the
I pride of the musical services in me- j
i dieval cathedrals.
Unaccompanied Singing
A capella, unaccompanied singing,
calls for a high degree of training of
the performers, and in return gives
j enjoyment that is entirely different j
; from that of the usual accompanied |
j choral singing. John Smallman of Los !
i Angeles is the organizer and present
director of the organization which
j bears his name.
Forty male and female voices,
trained to a high pitch of perfection,
1 make up the choir. A unique feature
tof the group is the costumes which j
j the singers wear during all their pro- j
grams. The Los Angeles Examiner |
comments, "The idea of having the j
choristers wear gypsy costumes is ex-j
, cellent. It gives brightness and infor-1
j mality to a type of progra mwhich is :
' traditionally sombre."
Sing by Memory
! The singing is not only unaccom-1
' panied but done entirely from mem-1
lory. All the many difficult composi-j
tions on the choir's repertoire have j
I been so thoroughly learned that no,
music is needed.
i A capella singing requires extra-1
ordinary breath control as well as an I
accurate sense of pitch. The many un-j
accompanied human voices blending
i together in perfect and sustained frar
-1 j mony give an organ-like effect.
Composers whose works are sung
j include the greatest masters of early
religious music, John Sebastian Bach,
' Orlando di Lasso, and others. Among
- the modern compositions are "Annie
Laurie," in O'Hara's arrangement; i
l "De Shaapfol," a negro spiritual of |
i | particularly haunting quality; and
i "Crusader's Hymn," arranged by'
Christiansen.

comments, "The idea of having the j
choristers wear gypsy costumes is ex-j
, cellent. It gives brightness and infor-1
j mality to a type of progra mwhich is :
' traditionally sombre."
Sing by Memory
! The singing is not only unaccom-1
' panied but done entirely from mem-1
lory. All the many difficult composi-j
tions on the choir's repertoire have j
I been so thoroughly learned that no,
music is needed.
i A capella singing requires extra-1
ordinary breath control as well as an I
accurate sense of pitch. The many un-j
accompanied human voices blending
i together in perfect and sustained frar
-1 j mony give an organ-like effect.
Composers whose works are sung
j include the greatest masters of early
religious music, John Sebastian Bach,
' Orlando di Lasso, and others. Among
- the modern compositions are "Annie
Laurie," in O'Hara's arrangement; i
l "De Shaapfol," a negro spiritual of |
i | particularly haunting quality; and
i "Crusader's Hymn," arranged by'
Christiansen.
