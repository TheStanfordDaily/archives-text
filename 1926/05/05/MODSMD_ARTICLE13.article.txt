A play day—not a work day—is the
plan of the committee arranging the
j program for University Labor Day
which is next Wednesday afternoon, j
The afternoon will be a University:
holiday, as has been the annual cus->
torn ever since the Convalescent Home
was started. A big barbecue and a
snappy series of entertainments are i
being provided by the committee in j
| charge.
In order to shorten the period of!
work as far as possible, Harvey Lytell, !
! general chairman, has plotted out the <
grounds and the work at the Home in
! such a way that every piece of work
will have one man in direct charge
who can oversee that particular job. :
With this systematized method the
| work can be done faster, the commit
j tee thinks, and the entertainments can
! start earlier.
Heretofore the serving of the barbe-1
j cue has been unsatisfactory to all ex
; cept those who were first in line. This j
i year, however ,a new plan has been !
arranged so that four lines may form
1 around the roasting pit, which will be :
J in charge of Sam McDonald. The usual j
i cafeteria style will be in vogue, but!
the serving will be faster and more
j of it.
Lloyd Nolan, who has charge of the
entertainment, states that all the cam- j
pus talent will be out en masse and j
' allow the students to enjoy their best :
renditions free. He says that everyone .
should take advantage of this oppor
tunity because it is the only time in !
the year that such amusement can be
had at the nominal price of nothing, j
Roy H. Button, Superintendent of I
Yards and Grounds, is co-operating j
with the committee in the matter of
i implements and outlay of work. He is !
I arranging to supply more tools than !
were on hand last year, so there will ;
be no men idle on account of a lack j
j of working equipment.
