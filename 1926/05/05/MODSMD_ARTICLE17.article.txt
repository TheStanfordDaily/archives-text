# NORTHERN TEAMS TO ENTER SPRINT STARS IN CONFERENCE MEET
## 440, 880 Entries Threaten Stanford's Chances in Events Saturday 
### 
Reports coming from the North in
dicate that northern schools entering
the conference meet will not only be
well represented in the distance events
i but will have their share of stars in
the sprints and middle-distance runs. |
Californians, who expect the three j
southern members'of the conference
to sweep the list of events, may pos
sibly be disillusioned. Although indi-
I vidual stars from the North may cut
heavily into the points, it is not ex
; pected that the California universities
! will have serious rivalry for team
| honors.
Montanan Threatens
From Montana comes the news that
Russell Sweet, dash star, who holds
the Pacific Coast Conference record in

i pete, thus giving Barber of U.C. and
House of U.S.C. a real threat.
The Stanford rooters' dream of a
one-two-three finish in the quarter
mile was given a severe shock when
i the news came from the Oregon Ag
gies that Sisson, a powerful 440 man,
is being trained. Sisson was also a
member of the Oregon Aggies' four
man four-mile relay team which won
i that event at the Drake Relays after a
: great race. After running his mile in
i the relay, Sisson ran in the special 440-
