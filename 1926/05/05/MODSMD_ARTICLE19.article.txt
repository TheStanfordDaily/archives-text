# CARDINAL POLO PLAYERS WILL MEET ARIZONA
## Wildcats Present Strongest Opposition Encountered During Season SOUTHERN TEAM ARRIVES Winner to Depend on Team, Individual Playing, Not Horse Superiority 
### 
Meeting the strongest opposition to
be faced during this polo season, Stan
ford's University polo four is prepar
ing for the two games with the Uni
versity of Arizona Wildcats tomorrow
and Saturday, at 2:30 o'clock on the
Highway field. The polo season will
conclude with a trip to Corvallis, Ore
gon, where the Cardinal riders will
clash with the Oregon Agricultural
College team for the last games of the
year.
The Arizona squad of five men, in
cluding Hearon, Saunders, Schildman,
Austin, and Snyder, arrived on the
campus and are staying at Sigma Nu,
Sigma Chi, and Delta Chi houses be
fore the games. Yesterday afternoon
and this morning they held practice
in order to get accustomed to the field
and the horses.
Squad Weakened
The Arizona squad has been weak
ened by the loss of Sawyer, star No. 4
man, who was one of the team making
the trip East in 1924 for the national
championships with Princeton. This
loss puts the squad more on a par with
the Stanford team, who was set back
early in the season by the injury of
Captain Fred Trotter, who was star
No. 4 man for the Cardinals.
Another possible disadvantage to
the Wildcats is that Schildman was
operated on for appendicitis seven
weeks ago, but he feels capable of
playing, and will start at No. 4 in
Sawyer's place.
I Jimmy Hearon, the "Greatest Colle
-1 gian," on being asked his opinion of
the conditions under which they ex
pect to play, stated that the field, al
though dirt, is better than they ex
i pected, and the horses, although not
; equal to the wiry Arizona ponies, are
, also better than were expected. The
Wildcats are used to playing on a turf
field, and the dirt field will handicap
■ them a little. The horses at Arizona
; are smaller and faster, because of the
1 fact that the R.O.T.C. unit at the
1 Southern college is cavalry, while the
unit at Stanford is artillery.
Champs Made
1 Several changes have been an
i nounced in the Arizona lineup. Harry
Saunders still holds his position at
No. 1. Jimmy Hearon, who was play
ing at No. 2, has shifted back to No. 3,
! while Jerry Snyder and Ralph Austin
i alternate at the No. 2 berth. Jimmy
I Schildman has dropped back from No.
3 to No. 4, and will fill the shoes of
j Sawyer, past star performer in the
backfield.
The Stanford lineup has been al
j tered also. L. C. Vanderburgh, who
; rides regularly at No. 3, will be played
!at No. 2 during the coming games,
; while C. O. Thompson, past No. 2 man,
! will fill in at No. 3. There is little dif
! ference in these positions, but both of
i them call for clever and fast aggres
j sive play. Both men are well fitted
i for the type of riding and hitting
I called for.
Bleachers have been erected on the
i Highway field in anticipation of a rec
j ord crowd. Admission will be charged
; for both games, and tickets will be
50c for general admission and 25c for
students with A.S.S.U. cards. The
I games will be called at 2:30 o'clock
j promptly, and will not last longer than
4 o'clock. There will be six periods
of seven and one-half minutes each,
with changes of strings of horses after
the third period.

i for the type of riding and hitting
I called for.
Bleachers have been erected on the
i Highway field in anticipation of a rec
j ord crowd. Admission will be charged
; for both games, and tickets will be
50c for general admission and 25c for
students with A.S.S.U. cards. The
I games will be called at 2:30 o'clock
j promptly, and will not last longer than
4 o'clock. There will be six periods
of seven and one-half minutes each,
with changes of strings of horses after
the third period.
Meeting the strongest opposition to
be faced during this polo season, Stan
ford's University polo four is prepar
ing for the two games with the Uni
versity of Arizona Wildcats tomorrow
and Saturday, at 2:30 o'clock on the
Highway field. The polo season will
conclude with a trip to Corvallis, Ore
gon, where the Cardinal riders will
clash with the Oregon Agricultural
College team for the last games of the
year.
The Arizona squad of five men, in
cluding Hearon, Saunders, Schildman,
Austin, and Snyder, arrived on the
campus and are staying at Sigma Nu,
Sigma Chi, and Delta Chi houses be
fore the games. Yesterday afternoon
and this morning they held practice
in order to get accustomed to the field
and the horses.
Squad Weakened
The Arizona squad has been weak
ened by the loss of Sawyer, star No. 4
man, who was one of the team making
the trip East in 1924 for the national
championships with Princeton. This
loss puts the squad more on a par with
the Stanford team, who was set back
early in the season by the injury of
Captain Fred Trotter, who was star
No. 4 man for the Cardinals.
Another possible disadvantage to
the Wildcats is that Schildman was
operated on for appendicitis seven
weeks ago, but he feels capable of
playing, and will start at No. 4 in
Sawyer's place.
I Jimmy Hearon, the "Greatest Colle
-1 gian," on being asked his opinion of
the conditions under which they ex
pect to play, stated that the field, al
though dirt, is better than they ex
i pected, and the horses, although not
; equal to the wiry Arizona ponies, are
, also better than were expected. The
Wildcats are used to playing on a turf
field, and the dirt field will handicap
■ them a little. The horses at Arizona
; are smaller and faster, because of the
1 fact that the R.O.T.C. unit at the
1 Southern college is cavalry, while the
unit at Stanford is artillery.

Saunders still holds his position at
No. 1. Jimmy Hearon, who was play
