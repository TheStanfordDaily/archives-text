# CARDINAL POLO PLAYERS WILL MEET ARIZONA
## Wildcats Present Strongest Opposition Encountered During Season SOUTHERN TEAM ARRIVES Winner to Depend on Team, Individual Playing, Not Horse Superiority 
### 
Meeting the strongest opposition to
be faced during this polo season, Stan
ford's University polo four is prepar
ing for the two games with the Uni
versity of Arizona Wildcats tomorrow
and Saturday, at 2:30 o'clock on the
Highway field. The polo season will
conclude with a trip to Corvallis, Ore
gon, where the Cardinal riders will
clash with the Oregon Agricultural
College team for the last games of the
year.
The Arizona squad of five men, in
cluding Hearon, Saunders, Schildman,
Austin, and Snyder, arrived on the
campus and are staying at Sigma Nu,
Sigma Chi, and Delta Chi houses be
fore the games. Yesterday afternoon
and this morning they held practice
in order to get accustomed to the field
and the horses.
Squad Weakened
The Arizona squad has been weak
ened by the loss of Sawyer, star No. 4
man, who was one of the team making
the trip East in 1924 for the national
championships with Princeton. This
loss puts the squad more on a par with
the Stanford team, who was set back
early in the season by the injury of
Captain Fred Trotter, who was star
No. 4 man for the Cardinals.
Another possible disadvantage to
the Wildcats is that Schildman was
operated on for appendicitis seven
