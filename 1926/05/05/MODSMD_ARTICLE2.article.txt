# OFFICIAL STANDARDS OF AMERICAN WHEAT ARE LOSING VALUES
## 
### 
According to a recent issue of
"Wheat Studies," the monthly maga-:
zine of the Food Research Institute:
of Stanford University, the official
wheat standards of the United States •
are losing much of their value because
of the changes that are taking place!
in the trade practices of evaluating
•wheat. I
"The standards do not directly con
sider protein content of wheat, where
as millers in the .last decade have
come to consider it seriously, because
bakers now demand flour of specified
protein content," says "Wheat,
Studies."
"The baker regards the protein con
tent of his flour as an important index
to the quantity of bread he can bake
Irom a given quantity of flour. ,
"The introduction of a protein t'ac- J
tor in the grading of wheat would 1
stimulate the producer to bend his;

efforts to securing high-protein wheat
as well as high yields. In the soft
winter wheat area much could be ac
complished in this direction.
"The addition of a protein factor to
the basis of the country's wheat stand
ards is important not merely as an act
of justice to the quality producers and
to the lesser millers, but also as an
important element of the country's
national policy in providing for the
future."
