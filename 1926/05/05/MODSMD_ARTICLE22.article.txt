Not so long ago it was provided that there could be only one charity
drive a quarter. Previously students had been constantly bothered by
agents, collecting for one charitable institution or another. The limitation
should be appreciated by the students; and they should be more than will
ing to get behind the three drives that are held a year. The quota in these
campaigns is never exhorbitant.
The last drive of the year which opens today is for the benefit of Stan
ford's own charitable institution—the Convalescent Home. Seven thou
sand dollars is the amount to be raised on the campus and in Palo Alto;
and of this sum the student body is asked to contribute $1000. 1 lie money
collected will be used in part to pay off a. deficit from last year and in
part for current expenses.
There is little need to call attention to the work that the institution is
doing. Practically every student has visited the old Stanford residence,
and here seen about two score children who have been sent to the country
to recuperate from illness.
The organization is favorably known all over the Bay Region as the
Stanford Convalescent Home. With the title "Stanford" outsiders im
mediately associate the 2,800 students at the University. Yet all that the
students are individually contributing to the Home is an afternoon's work
and a few cents a year. Next week we will have the opportunity to work;
and the next few days we will have the opportunity to give.
Again, the inimitable college woman! Softly spoken words by Dean
Irene T. Myers of Occidental:
"My students arc tired of Jazz. Totting parties? 1 should say that the
average college woman is not inclined in that direction. She is a bit too fas
tidious for that sort pf thing."
