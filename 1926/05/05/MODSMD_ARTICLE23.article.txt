# MODERN BASEBALL TRACED BACK TO ANCIENT GREEKS
## 
### Edward Sibbett 
Baseball, as baseball, is not yet half
a century old. The making of the first;
ball is attributed to the Lydians, and
it is true that ball-playing was a fa
vorite way of recreation with the an
cient Greeks. Although the greatest
game of baseball probably had its
origin long ago with the stages of its
evolution being marked by "Club Ball," j
"Rounders," "One Old Cat," and j
"Town Ball," it is a purely American 1
sport, the Americans moulding it into '
the National Sport it is today.
Englishmen witnessing a game of
baseball for the first time will immedi
ately exclaim, "Why this is nothing l
but Rounders." He is right, but even
centuries before, "Rounders" must
have had its origin in some such game !
as "Club Ball."
Played in 1344
From an old English engraving of
1344, showing a female figure in the !
act of pitching the ball to a male
figure who is about to hit it with a
large club we see the fundamentals
of "Club Ball" and even "Rounders."
This game in turn may have found
its derivation in old domestic quarrels
as suggested by the threatening club
and missile in the woman's hand.
Accepted as the source of baseball 1
as well as cricket, "Rounders" has
been a favorite English pastime for
many years. This game was played i
upon a ground in the shape of a more !
or less regular pentagon, the bases
at the angles being about twenty yards
apart. There aro not less than ten or \
more than thirty players who take
their places around the bases and in '
various parts of the fields.
The tosser calls "play," throwing
the ball to the batter who strikes with
a cricket stump and then runs around
the bases as many times as possible
until the ball is found and returned.
If the runner is hit with the ball he is
called out. When only one of the bat
ters is left he may call for "three fair

hits for the rounders," and if he hits
the ball hard enough to complete the
round of bases his side gets another
inning.
Fielders Trackmen
Patterned after the game of their
English brothers early American set
tlers played what is known to every
school boy as "One Old Cat" and
"Scrub," from which came the colon
ists' game of "Town Ball" in 1831.
In those days fielders were trained
like track men, the ball going for
great distances, necessitating a cross
country run to capture the elusive
missile. The team getting twenty-one
ruus first won the game. If a batter
was hit while running the bases, or
his hit was caught on the first bounce,
he was declared out.
To the Knickerbocker Club of New
York in 1846 goes the honor of having
the first organized ball club. At this
point the game took 011 more of its
modern aspects. After the disguised
underhand throw had come into vogue
a curved delivery was introduced. It
was not uncommon for a hard-hitting
college team to make over a hundred
runs a game. As late as 1867 when
two college teams made a 13-8 score,
it was considered a phenomenon.
Professional baseball took its first
stand when the Cincinnati "Red Stock
ings" entered the field in 1869. With
the advent of the swifter playing pro
fessional, and the reduced size and
weight of the ball, the various safe
guards of padded gloves, catchers'
mitts, breast pads, and masks were
introduced.
Rules have passed through years of
evolution. Rough edges have been
hewn off, the rough surfaces polished.
Useless rules have been abolished and
useful ones evolved. The result of the
old "Club Ball," "Rounders," "One
Old Cat," and "Town Ball" made scien
tific, has finally led to the National
Sport of America as known today.

Englishmen witnessing a game of
baseball for the first time will immedi
ately exclaim, "Why this is nothing l
but Rounders." He is right, but even
centuries before, "Rounders" must
have had its origin in some such game !
as "Club Ball."
Played in 1344
From an old English engraving of
1344, showing a female figure in the !
act of pitching the ball to a male
figure who is about to hit it with a
large club we see the fundamentals
of "Club Ball" and even "Rounders."
This game in turn may have found
its derivation in old domestic quarrels
as suggested by the threatening club
and missile in the woman's hand.
Accepted as the source of baseball 1
as well as cricket, "Rounders" has
been a favorite English pastime for
many years. This game was played i
upon a ground in the shape of a more !
or less regular pentagon, the bases
at the angles being about twenty yards
apart. There aro not less than ten or \
more than thirty players who take
their places around the bases and in '
various parts of the fields.
The tosser calls "play," throwing
the ball to the batter who strikes with
a cricket stump and then runs around
the bases as many times as possible
until the ball is found and returned.
If the runner is hit with the ball he is
called out. When only one of the bat
ters is left he may call for "three fair

hits for the rounders," and if he hits
the ball hard enough to complete the
round of bases his side gets another
inning.
Fielders Trackmen
Patterned after the game of their
English brothers early American set
tlers played what is known to every
school boy as "One Old Cat" and
"Scrub," from which came the colon
ists' game of "Town Ball" in 1831.
In those days fielders were trained
like track men, the ball going for
great distances, necessitating a cross
country run to capture the elusive
missile. The team getting twenty-one
ruus first won the game. If a batter
was hit while running the bases, or
his hit was caught on the first bounce,
he was declared out.
To the Knickerbocker Club of New
York in 1846 goes the honor of having
the first organized ball club. At this
point the game took 011 more of its
modern aspects. After the disguised
underhand throw had come into vogue
a curved delivery was introduced. It
was not uncommon for a hard-hitting
college team to make over a hundred
runs a game. As late as 1867 when
two college teams made a 13-8 score,
it was considered a phenomenon.
Professional baseball took its first
stand when the Cincinnati "Red Stock
ings" entered the field in 1869. With
the advent of the swifter playing pro
fessional, and the reduced size and
weight of the ball, the various safe
guards of padded gloves, catchers'
mitts, breast pads, and masks were
introduced.
Rules have passed through years of
evolution. Rough edges have been
hewn off, the rough surfaces polished.
Useless rules have been abolished and
useful ones evolved. The result of the
old "Club Ball," "Rounders," "One
Old Cat," and "Town Ball" made scien
tific, has finally led to the National
Sport of America as known today.
Baseball, as baseball, is not yet half
a century old. The making of the first;
ball is attributed to the Lydians, and
it is true that ball-playing was a fa
vorite way of recreation with the an
cient Greeks. Although the greatest
game of baseball probably had its
origin long ago with the stages of its
evolution being marked by "Club Ball," j
"Rounders," "One Old Cat," and j
