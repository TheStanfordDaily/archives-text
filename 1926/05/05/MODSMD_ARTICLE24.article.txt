FIFTY-CENT BLUES
Have any of you fellows ever made a date and theu lost all but 50 cents
of your hard-earned (?) cash matching pennies?
Ain't it the bung? Ain't it tho? What to do, what to say, what not to say,
when to say it —that down in the dumps feeling.
Gosh, what can a poor guv do? You gotta take 'em out somewheres —
they won't stay home —they don't wanna.
They wanna dance. They wanna eat —they don't wanna stay home by
the fire, etc. If only those good old times were back with us.
When you say let's go to the movies, they say no I wanna dance.
When you say let's go for a tide they say no 1 wanna eat. They won't
pet, won't smoke —hell, what WILL they do?
Nothing. Ain't it the bunk? -—W.P.W.

HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF
(Found in an ancient volume, the 1894 Quad)
"No rug, no dish, no bedding—
No water and no light.
No soap, of course no towels,
No furniture in sight.
No chimney and no cooking stove,
No hatchet, hammer, nails,
No pictures, books, or music-
All yes! the pussy wails.
No food but crackers, friends to tea.
No ice, nowhere to go—
But Oh! the fun that we did have
Pioneering on the row!
The scribe who wrote this ancient rhyme
Saw future time in better part,
When palaces with marble walls
Would rear up monuments to art.
His prophecy was wrong, his thoughts
Were much in error in the mass.
Now once again for pioneers
The row must seek, for men of brass.
Yea! Time will come when in the night
The houses all in ruin bleak
Stand stark beneath the waning moon
While Greeks for some poor shelter seek.
The time is coming on apace—
Each brother sees its shadow now, ,
W T hen in the house he tries to clog
And brings down plaster on his brow.
Alas that such should ever be,
That houses fall with passing years—
But all the boys can do is sit
And swear like hell as ruin nears.
L'Envoi
When the Dekes live in old dry-goods boxes,
Sigma Nu rolls away down the hill;
When the stucco falls off of the Zete house,
The old times will be back with a will. —F.T.M.

L'Envoi
When the Dekes live in old dry-goods boxes,
Sigma Nu rolls away down the hill;
When the stucco falls off of the Zete house,
The old times will be back with a will. —F.T.M.
FIFTY-CENT BLUES
Have any of you fellows ever made a date and theu lost all but 50 cents
of your hard-earned (?) cash matching pennies?
Ain't it the bung? Ain't it tho? What to do, what to say, what not to say,
when to say it —that down in the dumps feeling.
Gosh, what can a poor guv do? You gotta take 'em out somewheres —
they won't stay home —they don't wanna.
They wanna dance. They wanna eat —they don't wanna stay home by
the fire, etc. If only those good old times were back with us.
When you say let's go to the movies, they say no I wanna dance.
When you say let's go for a tide they say no 1 wanna eat. They won't
pet, won't smoke —hell, what WILL they do?
Nothing. Ain't it the bunk? -—W.P.W.

HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF
(Found in an ancient volume, the 1894 Quad)
"No rug, no dish, no bedding—
No water and no light.
No soap, of course no towels,
No furniture in sight.
No chimney and no cooking stove,
No hatchet, hammer, nails,
No pictures, books, or music-
All yes! the pussy wails.
No food but crackers, friends to tea.
No ice, nowhere to go—
But Oh! the fun that we did have
Pioneering on the row!
The scribe who wrote this ancient rhyme
Saw future time in better part,
When palaces with marble walls
Would rear up monuments to art.
His prophecy was wrong, his thoughts
Were much in error in the mass.
Now once again for pioneers
The row must seek, for men of brass.
Yea! Time will come when in the night
The houses all in ruin bleak
Stand stark beneath the waning moon
While Greeks for some poor shelter seek.
The time is coming on apace—
Each brother sees its shadow now, ,
W T hen in the house he tries to clog
And brings down plaster on his brow.
Alas that such should ever be,
That houses fall with passing years—
But all the boys can do is sit
And swear like hell as ruin nears.
