rule, is busy trying to get something
more out of college than studies, the
foreigner devotes himself to studies

activities," believes Professor Ralph
S. Minor, University of California ex
aminer, in accounting for the marked
ability of foreign students in contrast
with the average college student.

attends a university in this country is
sufficient evidence that he has greater
initiative than the majority of students
of his country, according to Minor.
The head of the English department
at California declares that the progress
of the foreign students depend upon

can students grasp facts and figures
more easily, while certain classes of
foreigners deal with abstract ideas
more readily.
