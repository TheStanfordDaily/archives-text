UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON—
(P.I.P.) —Rash comments made by
members of Badger debate club at its
last meeting, on the subject, "Our
friend, the Governor —or the Guy at
Olympia," caused the officers of the
organization and those who partook in
the discussion to be called before the
faculty discipline committee.
The debaters expressed opinions
that if the governor did not mend his
ways, impeachment was imminent, and
that he was malting the ITniversity of
Washington a rich man's school. Be
cause the matter went into the press,
the faculty disciplinary committee
took it up but has not yet disclosed
its decision in the case.
