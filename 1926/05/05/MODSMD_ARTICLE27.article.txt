# Yellow Umbrellas Added To Engineers' Equipment
## 
### 
Gay. yellow umbrellas have become
part of the equipment of the class in
Civil Engineering at the University
of Nebraska. The sunshades have a
definite purpose, that of protecting the
eyes when the engineers doing plane
table work have to work outdoors,
often in the light of a glaring sun
which reflects on the glazed white
paper used.
Each umbrella is supported by three
guy ropes and three iron pegs to pre
vent its blowing away and scattering
paraphernalia.
