# College Love Acclaimed As Scholarship Panacea
## 
### 
Love has been acclaimed the great
panacea for low scholarship by Jose
phine Small, dean of women at Cin
cinnati University. She is joined in
her opinion by Dean Frank Chandler
of that university and a score of deans
of Ohio colleges and universities who
are all agreed that "college love is a
tonic for students."
One of the most outstanding de
fenders of this theory is Dean J. Lee
Richmond of Toledo University, who
says that a student fired by romance
excels himself, not wishing to disillu
sion the particular woman who ranks
his I.Q. as one of the highest in the
country.
The contrary view of student love
affairs if? held at Northwestern Uni
versity where it is forbidden for stu
dents to marry.
