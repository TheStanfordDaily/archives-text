# 1927 MEN URGED TO ASSIST IN FINAL PROM DECORATIONS
## 
### 
Junior class members are urged
by John Menzies, chairman of
the decoration committee, to help
with the work on the Junior Prom
decorations at the pavilion for
the rest of the week.
Work on the decorations is pro
gressing, but there is a crying
need for aid from class members
in the afternoons after 1:30
o'clock and in the evenings. The
panels have yet to be hung and
various other jobs to be done
that require the assistance of
many men before Friday night.
John Craig of San Francisco,
who is in charge of the decorat
ing, is on the campus and will re
main for the rest of the week to
personally direct the assembling
of the decorations.
