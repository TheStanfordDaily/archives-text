# MINNESOTA TO BUILD ORGAN IN AUDITORIUM
## 
### 
A $100,000 pipe organ will eventu
ally be installed in the University of
Minnesota's Memorial auditorium,
which is soon to be constructed. A
faculty committee is now at work at
the problem of obtaining funds for the
organ which will compare with the
monster municipal organ of Cleveland,
Ohio, and the world-famed organ of
the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City,
Utah;
It is planned to bring the world's
best organists to the Minnesota cam
pus for popular concert courses, when
the new organ is installed.
