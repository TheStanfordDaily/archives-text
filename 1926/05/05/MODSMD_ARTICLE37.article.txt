# HISTORY OF POLO TRACED TO EARLY DAYS OF ATHLETICS
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Polo enjoys the distinction of being
the oldest game played with a ball and
a stick. The word "polo" comes from j
the Tibetan "pulii," meaning "ball." As ;
early as 600 B.C. there are records of!
the game in Persian annals. In this i
year, a certain prince with his follow- 1
ers, in exile, astonished a Turkish |
prince with the ease with which they !
defeated the Turkish players. This is!
the first chronicle of an international
match.
The records show that the game was
originated in Persia, where it was
taught to the royal princes as part of |
their training. From here, it spread to
China, Tibet, Constantinople, and In
dia, from where it was introduced in
England and finally in America.
Twelve Types Known
There are twelve different types of
polo. Several of the first deal with the!
methods of play in Tibet and Persia. I
These games were of various kinds. |
Among the mare those in which over!
300 participants with wooden cudgels!
played on the ground, with balls from I
one to many in number. Tradition had j
it that either four or five men lined up j
on a side. However, the Chinese game
was planned for two participants.
In this Chinese game, the object was
to put the ball, usually the size of a
doubled first and painted red, into a ]
hole between the goal posts. Both;
players endeavored to get the ball into j
the same goal at first, but it soon was 1
varied to two goals with each man de- i
fending his own* and playing to the j
other.
The Japanese varied this somewhat,
in that the ball used was made of paper
with sand or bamboo chips glued to the
outside. The club was shaped liek a
racquet. The object of their play was
to carry the ball on the racquet and put'
it into a hole about a foot in diameter
in a board five feet high. The number
of players was variable, but the usual
thing was for several to participate.
British Form Rules
The Indian form of the game was |
more like the modern in that the two I
teams lined up and the play started!
when the ball was thrown into the cen- j
tcr of the field by an umpire.
English polo before the present form, I
was heavily encumbered by rules which j
slowed the game up a great deal. Pen-1
alties were imposed on offenses which I
in the game today make for speed and :
thrills.
Polo was first introduced in England !
by the Tenth Hussars in 1869, and was!
organized by the Hurlingham club in
1873. The field was boarded at the side,!
and the periods of play were fixed by j
rules.
Americans Add Speed
The present polo game is speeded |
up by American abolition of several
English rules and penalties. The off
side shot, once penalized by British of
ficials, is used by Americans, to the ex
tent that the contest became faster, the
attack stronger, the passing longer, and \
the pace greater and more sustained, j
The players had to show more accuracy |
in their shots than had been necessary j
before.
Among the Persians, the gas was
very rough and demanded great phy
sical eexrtion, besides endangering the
person of the players. Men who vol
untarily played polo were looked upon
as the acme of bravery and hardihood,
and were idealized by both people and
monarchs. This was carried so far
that Shah Bahran, of Persia, who found I
a player wearing a coat of mail under ]
his polo shirt, promptly slew the culprit, i
Sport of Kings
In China, the game shared with foot-j
ball the position of first importance, i
Men who played well received royal
positions and were promoted to high •
offices. The kings were often ardent
devotees of the sport. Since the Chi
nese game was a twosome affair, the
king who played it was always with an
inferior. In respect to this phase of the i
sport, several protests were made. The
following is one:
"A certain king, extremely fond of
polo, was wont to play at all hours of
the day, often neglecting his royal du
ties for his pleasure. Accordingly, one
of his advisors prepared a protest stat
ing that the king should not play polo
because, (1) the subject with whom he
phved would feel either great elation |
or dejection according as the game
turned out. This was considered to be j
bad. (2) It was destructive of the royal!
dignity to jump on a horse, seize a j
club, and ride madly here and there
after a ball, with no other thought than j
to be first and win. (3) It was danger
ous to make light of the dignity of the
royal house, and the queen was also |
degraded. " It is recorded that the king
involved sighed many days over this
decree.

by the Tenth Hussars in 1869, and was!
organized by the Hurlingham club in
1873. The field was boarded at the side,!
and the periods of play were fixed by j
rules.
Americans Add Speed
The present polo game is speeded |
up by American abolition of several
English rules and penalties. The off
side shot, once penalized by British of
ficials, is used by Americans, to the ex
tent that the contest became faster, the
attack stronger, the passing longer, and \
the pace greater and more sustained, j
The players had to show more accuracy |
in their shots than had been necessary j
before.
Among the Persians, the gas was
very rough and demanded great phy
sical eexrtion, besides endangering the
person of the players. Men who vol
untarily played polo were looked upon
as the acme of bravery and hardihood,
and were idealized by both people and
monarchs. This was carried so far
that Shah Bahran, of Persia, who found I
a player wearing a coat of mail under ]
his polo shirt, promptly slew the culprit, i
Sport of Kings
In China, the game shared with foot-j
ball the position of first importance, i
Men who played well received royal
positions and were promoted to high •
offices. The kings were often ardent
devotees of the sport. Since the Chi
nese game was a twosome affair, the
king who played it was always with an
inferior. In respect to this phase of the i
sport, several protests were made. The
following is one:
"A certain king, extremely fond of
polo, was wont to play at all hours of
the day, often neglecting his royal du
ties for his pleasure. Accordingly, one
of his advisors prepared a protest stat
ing that the king should not play polo
because, (1) the subject with whom he
phved would feel either great elation |
or dejection according as the game
turned out. This was considered to be j
bad. (2) It was destructive of the royal!
dignity to jump on a horse, seize a j
club, and ride madly here and there
after a ball, with no other thought than j
to be first and win. (3) It was danger
ous to make light of the dignity of the
royal house, and the queen was also |
degraded. " It is recorded that the king
involved sighed many days over this
decree.
Polo enjoys the distinction of being
the oldest game played with a ball and
a stick. The word "polo" comes from j
the Tibetan "pulii," meaning "ball." As ;
early as 600 B.C. there are records of!
the game in Persian annals. In this i
year, a certain prince with his follow- 1
ers, in exile, astonished a Turkish |
prince with the ease with which they !
defeated the Turkish players. This is!
the first chronicle of an international
match.
The records show that the game was
originated in Persia, where it was
taught to the royal princes as part of |
their training. From here, it spread to
China, Tibet, Constantinople, and In
dia, from where it was introduced in
England and finally in America.
Twelve Types Known
There are twelve different types of
polo. Several of the first deal with the!
methods of play in Tibet and Persia. I
These games were of various kinds. |
Among the mare those in which over!
300 participants with wooden cudgels!
played on the ground, with balls from I
one to many in number. Tradition had j
it that either four or five men lined up j
on a side. However, the Chinese game
was planned for two participants.
In this Chinese game, the object was
to put the ball, usually the size of a
doubled first and painted red, into a ]
hole between the goal posts. Both;
players endeavored to get the ball into j
the same goal at first, but it soon was 1
varied to two goals with each man de- i
fending his own* and playing to the j
other.
The Japanese varied this somewhat,
in that the ball used was made of paper
with sand or bamboo chips glued to the
outside. The club was shaped liek a
racquet. The object of their play was
to carry the ball on the racquet and put'
it into a hole about a foot in diameter
in a board five feet high. The number
of players was variable, but the usual
thing was for several to participate.
British Form Rules
The Indian form of the game was |
more like the modern in that the two I
teams lined up and the play started!
when the ball was thrown into the cen- j
tcr of the field by an umpire.
English polo before the present form, I
was heavily encumbered by rules which j
slowed the game up a great deal. Pen-1
alties were imposed on offenses which I
in the game today make for speed and :
thrills.

the game in Persian annals. In this i
year, a certain prince with his follow- 1
ers, in exile, astonished a Turkish |
prince with the ease with which they !
defeated the Turkish players. This is!
the first chronicle of an international
match.
The records show that the game was
originated in Persia, where it was
taught to the royal princes as part of |
their training. From here, it spread to
China, Tibet, Constantinople, and In
dia, from where it was introduced in
England and finally in America.
Twelve Types Known
There are twelve different types of
polo. Several of the first deal with the!
methods of play in Tibet and Persia. I
These games were of various kinds. |
Among the mare those in which over!
300 participants with wooden cudgels!
played on the ground, with balls from I
one to many in number. Tradition had j
it that either four or five men lined up j
on a side. However, the Chinese game
was planned for two participants.
In this Chinese game, the object was
to put the ball, usually the size of a
doubled first and painted red, into a ]
hole between the goal posts. Both;
players endeavored to get the ball into j
the same goal at first, but it soon was 1
varied to two goals with each man de- i
fending his own* and playing to the j
other.
The Japanese varied this somewhat,
in that the ball used was made of paper
with sand or bamboo chips glued to the
outside. The club was shaped liek a
racquet. The object of their play was
to carry the ball on the racquet and put'
it into a hole about a foot in diameter
in a board five feet high. The number
of players was variable, but the usual
thing was for several to participate.
British Form Rules
The Indian form of the game was |
more like the modern in that the two I
teams lined up and the play started!
when the ball was thrown into the cen- j
tcr of the field by an umpire.
English polo before the present form, I
was heavily encumbered by rules which j
slowed the game up a great deal. Pen-1
alties were imposed on offenses which I
in the game today make for speed and :
thrills.
Polo was first introduced in England !
by the Tenth Hussars in 1869, and was!
organized by the Hurlingham club in
1873. The field was boarded at the side,!
and the periods of play were fixed by j
rules.
Americans Add Speed
The present polo game is speeded |
up by American abolition of several
English rules and penalties. The off
side shot, once penalized by British of
ficials, is used by Americans, to the ex
tent that the contest became faster, the
attack stronger, the passing longer, and \
the pace greater and more sustained, j
The players had to show more accuracy |
in their shots than had been necessary j
before.
Among the Persians, the gas was
very rough and demanded great phy
sical eexrtion, besides endangering the
person of the players. Men who vol
untarily played polo were looked upon
as the acme of bravery and hardihood,
and were idealized by both people and
monarchs. This was carried so far
that Shah Bahran, of Persia, who found I
a player wearing a coat of mail under ]
his polo shirt, promptly slew the culprit, i
Sport of Kings
In China, the game shared with foot-j
ball the position of first importance, i
Men who played well received royal
positions and were promoted to high •
offices. The kings were often ardent
devotees of the sport. Since the Chi
nese game was a twosome affair, the
king who played it was always with an
inferior. In respect to this phase of the i
sport, several protests were made. The
following is one:
"A certain king, extremely fond of
polo, was wont to play at all hours of
the day, often neglecting his royal du
ties for his pleasure. Accordingly, one
of his advisors prepared a protest stat
ing that the king should not play polo
because, (1) the subject with whom he
phved would feel either great elation |
or dejection according as the game
turned out. This was considered to be j
bad. (2) It was destructive of the royal!
dignity to jump on a horse, seize a j
club, and ride madly here and there
after a ball, with no other thought than j
to be first and win. (3) It was danger
ous to make light of the dignity of the
royal house, and the queen was also |
degraded. " It is recorded that the king
involved sighed many days over this
decree.
