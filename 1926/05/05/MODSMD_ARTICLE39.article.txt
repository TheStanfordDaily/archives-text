# JUNIOR CLASS WILL PUBLISH SCORES FOR 'RIDE A COCK-HORSE'
## 
### G. W 
Definite announcement was made!
] today by John L. Wiggin, musical di-
I rector, and Leonard K. Schwartz, as-1
sistant general director of "Ride a
; Cock Horse," the Junior Opera to be
presented in the Assembly hall Friday
| and Saturday nights, that there will |
be issued a song-book of the show
i which will be placed on sale between
| acts of the performance.
J With the exception of the musical j
; shows produced here last year, and 1
j the football show and Ram's Head
j Show this year, it has always been I
i customary to have the scores of Stan-
I ford's original shows available in pub
lished form. It was owing to requests i
from various sources on and off the ;
campus for copies of the words and j
music of some songs from the Ram's
Head and football shows that the pro
ject of getting out a songbook for j
| "Ride a Cock-Horse" was begun, Wig-;
I gin states.
j The songbook will contain the out
i standing hits from the year's musical :
; shows, "The Big Game Gaities," "Ray, â– 
; Ray, Rover Boys," and "Ride a Cock
: Horse." While announcement of the
i songs definitely selected for publica-j
, tion has not yet been made by the
j directors, it is expected that choice
j will be from the following: "Lady
! Lou," by Jean Wakefield, "Girl of My
i Dreams," by Kenneth Hess, and "The
i
| New Football Song," by Jean Wake
i field and Gregory Williamson from
the Big Game Gaieties; "Caroline," by
i Jack Wiggin and Tom Breeze, "Red
| Hot Vamp," by Jean Wakefield, "I Am
| the Villain," by Jack Wiggin and Tom
Breeze, and "Captain Stop the Boat" j
by Jack Wiggin and Gregory William
son from the Ram's Head Show.
Special song practice by the com- j
bined choruses and orchestra of "Ride
a Cock-Horse" held yesterday after
j noon indicated that there will be no
dearth of hits from which the com-!
pilers of the songbook may make their
| selections from the forthcoming pro- i
i duction. The opening number, "A Sol
| dier Is Careless and Gay," by Jack
I Wiggin and Tom Breeze, is one of the
I most tuneful numbers of the show; in
I musical form it is based upon several
I typical old English tavern songs, and
I has a fine swing and pleasing melody,
j "The Song of the Night Riders" by
\ Jack Wiggin and Gregory Williamson
! is another period number, with strong
I harmonic possibilities and dramatic
power; it is somewhat similar in con-'
j ception to "Song of the Man Hunt"
j from "Rose Marie." "Shepherd's
Round" by Jack Wiggin and Tom
Breeze is a rollicking country dance'
tune which most members of the
| chorus are already whistling. The
i featured love song of "Ride a Cock
! Horse" is "Twilight Time," a love bal-j
lad by Jack Wiggin and Gregory Wil
liamson; "Always Loving You" is an
other love song, to be sung by Velma
Randall; unlike the other numbers of
the show these pieces may be ren-'
dered as either ballads or fox-trots.
The cover design for the songbook!
! has been executed by Tom Breeze,
which is singularly appropriate, as
! he served as lyricist in the first two
musical shows of the year and is one
of the authors of "Ride a Cock-Horse."
Specimens of his art work have ap
peared from time to time in Chaparral.
According to Schwartz the songbook
will arrive on the campus from a San
Francisco printing establishment on
I Friday afternoon and will be available
| at both performances. Copies remain
! ing from these sales will be left at the
j Bookstore.
