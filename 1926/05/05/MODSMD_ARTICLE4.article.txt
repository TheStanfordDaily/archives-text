# CONVALESCENT HOME APPEAL FOR FUNDS OPENS HERE TODAY
## Associated Students Asked To Contribute $1000 Toward Goal 
### 
Today opened the first stage of the
Convalescent Home Appeal which will
close next Wednesday, when the an
nual University Labor Day will be
held on which the entire student body
works at the Home. The Appeal has
as its goal the raising of $1000 on the
campus.
Some contribution is asked from
every member of the Associated Stu- j
dents. Each organization on the cam-!
pus will have a fund to which the con
tributions of its members will be |
turned in. This plan worked very sue- j
cessfully last year witji several of the
fraternities, sororities, and eating
clubs, and is being adopted for all this j
>ear. A list will be published in the j
Daily showing the standing of each i
organization's fund.
A change is announced on the Com- j
mittee by Linn Winterbotham, chair- \
man. Powell Carpenter replaces Slier- j
man Hazeltine. Other members are
Helen Huneke, Lorraine Cleaveland,
Lester Gordon, Louis Lundborg, Ken
neth McDougall. and William Fain.
The student body is asked to sub
scribe only $1000 out of the $7000 to
be contributed by Stanford and Palo
Alto together.
The following letter explaining the
appeal has been sent to campus or
ganizations by Linn Winterbotham:
To the Friends of the Stanford Con
valescent Home:
The help of every Stanford man and
woman is urgently needed for this
worthy cause, the Stanford Convale
scent Home Appeal, during the week
of May sth to May 12th.
Last year, the Home gave 14,600
days of child service at a cost of
$33,226. The income from donations
and interest on general endowment
funds amounted to $31,674, leaving a
deficit of $1551. To meet the expenses
of this year, and to wipe out last
year's deficit, the Home needs $7000
from the Stanford and Palo Alto com
munities. Of this amount, the student
body is asked to subscribe $1000.
Each one is urged to take some part
in maintaining the Stanford Convale
scent Home for sick and crippled chil
dren .It belongs to the University, and
is one of the noblest means of reliev
ing human suffering that any Univer
sity has ever undertaken. Every dollar
that is given will go directly to pro
vide food, clothing, and nursing care
for these forty sick and crippled chil
dren whose parents in most cases can
not afford to give tliem the care they
need. It is a chance for some fine so
cial service work in relieving human
I suffering right here on the campus.
Last year some organizations made
; donations in the names of their re
spective houses or clubs. It is urgently
hoped this year that every house and
club will be added to the list of donors
who help take care of this family
; of forty sick children. Please see the
! committee in your group during the
j week.
Checks may be addressed to the
Stanford Convalescent Home, Stanford
University.
LINDSEY WINTERBOTHAM,
Chairman Stanford Convalescent
Home Appeal Committee.
