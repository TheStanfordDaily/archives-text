# NATHAN GIVES VIEWS ON COLLEGE HUMOR
## 
### 
That college humor "inclines a bit too
j tiringly to the crass and boorish" is the
i opinion expressed hv George Jean
Nathan, ediotor of the American Mer
cury and dramatic critic of Judge, in
an interview given to the Daily Prince
tonian. While he admires the ingenuity
and genuineness of student wit he finds
I that it and American humor in general
j develop boorish tendencies in an effort
to escape composition that is both
funny and literarj r .
Nathan denounces faculty censorship
| of student publications as a hindrance
j to spontaneous expression and believes
i that it creates more mischief than
; would the absence of control.
For every college to regularly inflict
on the public a comic magazine he finds
an unjustifiable practice. His advice
I to college playrights is to shun Broad
j way plots. "There are situations and
| settings enough on the campus for a
good play."
