# Jones Offers Trophy for Winner of Punting Contest
## 
### 
In order to develop more capable
punters for next season's varsity Coach
' Howard Jones," U.S.C. grid mentor,
i will stage a three-day punting contest
i at the close of spring practice.
Last year Jones used Bob Lee and
Morley Drury as his mainstays for
booting the pigskin but, according to
Jones neither of these men are reliable
or accurate kickers. Consequently he
is giving all his spare time in the pres-'
| ent practice to develop some new punt
| ing material.
1 A trophy will be awarded to the atli- j
; lete hanging up the best score in the
; contest. Points will be based on ac
i curacy and time.
