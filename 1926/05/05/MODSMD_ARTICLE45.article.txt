# ENGLISH CLASS WILL GIVE THREE ONE-ACT PLAYS NEXT TUESDAY
## Marion Craig Wentworth to Emphasize Acting Over Settings, Scenes 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Working for acting rather than ef- j
fects with elaborate scenery and light- j
ing, the play production class, English |
19b, is spending its time and efforts
in improving the realism of the three
one-act plays to be presented May 11,
at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly hall.
Mrs. Marion Craig Wentworth, direc- j
tor of the and a nationally I
known playwright, is being assisted ,
in this work by Helen Lewis, William
Thornton, and Raymond Bruce.
Three Plays Planned
The productions to be put on at this
performance are "The Thrice-Promised
Bride," a Chinese play by Cheng-Chin
Hsiung; "The Pot Boiler," by Alice
Gerstenberg, and "The Maker of
Dreams," by Oliphant Dawn.
The first of these plays was written
by a Chinese student, and is based on
an age-old theme. In China, because
of the custom sometimes practiced of
the betrothal of children before they j
are born, there often occur slight mix- j
ups in the promises. Cases where a j
girl has promised through the various
legal or recognized mediums to more j
than one man are very common. The ■
only redress the injured parties have
is found in the courts of law, where
the Chinese magistrate administers
justice. This play deals with such a
chain of circumstances.
It shows a remarkable grasp of
human nature, and the writer has man-j j
aged to keep the Chinese atmosphere j •
throughout, although using character- j <
istic English idioms and expressions j'
in the conversation. Odd Chinese cus- j
toms and literary allusions are clever- .
ly worked in, and the completed play i
is a gem of oddity. This is the first I
time it has been produced on tlfe ]
coast. The Provincetown Players pro- ]
duced it in the East, but several minor ]
discrepancies in costuming are to be |
j noticed in their production. In order, j
| to obviate this, Tso Shih, member of {
the Stanford Chinese Club, is lending
! his services as assistant director. Shih ;
I I •
j is familiar with Chinese customs and 1
j dress, and is of material aid.
Comedy Is Favorite
Miss Gerstenberg's production, "The j:
i Pot Boiler," is an universal favorite!
; with one-act play producers. It is j
j based on the dress rehearsal of the j
1 commonplace plot of the ruined father, I
the black villain, his demand for the >
beautiful daughter's hand, and all the
rest of the hokum often found in such (
plays. The absurdity and pseudo-dra-,
matic qualities of such a plot are de-1
veloped with bold strokes, while com- j
edy runs riot throughout.
The playwright, in his efforts to
force the cast into their parts, man-'
ages his effects with an egotistical i
self-satisfaction which is upheld dur- [
ing the entire act. The addition of'
lines and side comments, coupled with
the intensely dramatic climax which
falls flat when most needed, gives this
play a comedy twist appealing to
everyone.
The third play, "The Maker of j
| Dreams," is a fantasy, also popukir j
j with playgoers. The love of Pierrette j
i for Pierrot is carried forward in a i
theme replete with beautiful lines and
whimsical effects. This fantasy is in
the proper contrast to the other plays
to balance the evening's offerings.

of the custom sometimes practiced of
the betrothal of children before they j
are born, there often occur slight mix- j
ups in the promises. Cases where a j
girl has promised through the various
legal or recognized mediums to more j
than one man are very common. The ■
only redress the injured parties have
is found in the courts of law, where
the Chinese magistrate administers
justice. This play deals with such a
chain of circumstances.
It shows a remarkable grasp of
human nature, and the writer has man-j j
aged to keep the Chinese atmosphere j •
throughout, although using character- j <
istic English idioms and expressions j'
in the conversation. Odd Chinese cus- j
toms and literary allusions are clever- .
ly worked in, and the completed play i
is a gem of oddity. This is the first I
time it has been produced on tlfe ]
coast. The Provincetown Players pro- ]
duced it in the East, but several minor ]
discrepancies in costuming are to be |
j noticed in their production. In order, j
| to obviate this, Tso Shih, member of {
the Stanford Chinese Club, is lending
! his services as assistant director. Shih ;
I I •
j is familiar with Chinese customs and 1
j dress, and is of material aid.
Comedy Is Favorite
Miss Gerstenberg's production, "The j:
i Pot Boiler," is an universal favorite!
; with one-act play producers. It is j
j based on the dress rehearsal of the j
1 commonplace plot of the ruined father, I
the black villain, his demand for the >
beautiful daughter's hand, and all the
rest of the hokum often found in such (
plays. The absurdity and pseudo-dra-,
matic qualities of such a plot are de-1
veloped with bold strokes, while com- j
edy runs riot throughout.
The playwright, in his efforts to
force the cast into their parts, man-'
ages his effects with an egotistical i
self-satisfaction which is upheld dur- [
ing the entire act. The addition of'
lines and side comments, coupled with
the intensely dramatic climax which
falls flat when most needed, gives this
play a comedy twist appealing to
everyone.
The third play, "The Maker of j
| Dreams," is a fantasy, also popukir j
j with playgoers. The love of Pierrette j
i for Pierrot is carried forward in a i
theme replete with beautiful lines and
whimsical effects. This fantasy is in
the proper contrast to the other plays
to balance the evening's offerings.
Working for acting rather than ef- j
fects with elaborate scenery and light- j
ing, the play production class, English |
19b, is spending its time and efforts
in improving the realism of the three
one-act plays to be presented May 11,
at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly hall.
Mrs. Marion Craig Wentworth, direc- j
tor of the and a nationally I
known playwright, is being assisted ,
in this work by Helen Lewis, William
Thornton, and Raymond Bruce.
Three Plays Planned
The productions to be put on at this
performance are "The Thrice-Promised
Bride," a Chinese play by Cheng-Chin
Hsiung; "The Pot Boiler," by Alice
Gerstenberg, and "The Maker of
Dreams," by Oliphant Dawn.
The first of these plays was written
by a Chinese student, and is based on
an age-old theme. In China, because
of the custom sometimes practiced of
the betrothal of children before they j
are born, there often occur slight mix- j
ups in the promises. Cases where a j
girl has promised through the various
legal or recognized mediums to more j
than one man are very common. The ■
