# SPORTS OF 1926
## A 						California Coach 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Walter Christie is one of the best track and field coaches in the world.
The Far West has known him well for the last twenty-five years, and the East
that had forgotten that he used to coach at Columbia, Williams, and the Navy
before he went to the great open spaces, learned to know him well in 1921,
*22, and '23, when his University of California teams won the Eastern inter
collegiate meets. Eastern colleges had done that trick before, but for a coach
to bring his athletes more than 3,000 miles and win three years in a row was
not only unbelievable—it was pretty darn fresh!
Walter Christie is a successful coach because he has been a successful
athlete for twenty-six years. It was first as an amateur ball player that he
showed his ability, and his speed on the base paths brought about the sug
gestion that he go in for sprinting. So Walter took the suggestion, and com
peted for the Titan and the Manhattan Athletic clubs in New York City.
"But I had to eat," said Christie, "and so turned professional." The fact that
he made money in every event on the track and field program except the
pole-vault shows what a versatile and able "pro" he was!
Christie was a veritable Iron Man, in fact. He'd go. through a field day
in one town, and then take a train to the next town, and do the same thing
the next day. The sprints were his best events, and liis mark of 19 2-sths
seconds for 200 yards shows that he was a real star. He ran the 100 in 10
flat "hundreds of times,"-to use his own words.
But track and field athletics didn't take all of this remarkable man's time.
Not by a jugful. He has played professional baseball, umnired eames. and
once nranaged a minor league team. He has trained football teams, coached
baseball and basketball, and officiated at nearly every sport on the calendar.
As a field coach at the last Olympic games, bis men won seven out of a
possible ten first places. He knows his stuff, this bird.
