Wouldn't it be nice to send her a box of hosiery or perhaps a pair
of boudoir slippers—something that she would not buy for herself but
would appreciate all the more because it came from you?

Newest Shades at $1.95 a pair (packed in a gift box ready to mail).
Quilted Satin Slippers in Old Rose, Delph Blue, Lavender, and Black,
at $2.75.
