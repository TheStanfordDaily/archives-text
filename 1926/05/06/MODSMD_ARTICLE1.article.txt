## Leslie Kiler Has Arranged Old English Atmosphere In Period Scenes STAGE SETS EFFECTIVE Research by Chrysella Kiler And Authors Assures Unique Costumes 
### Frank Baker 
Last night's rehearsal of the 1927
Junior Opera which will be given to
morrow and Saturday nights in the
Assembly Hall, was the first to use the
colorful period costumes and com
pleted atmospheric sets. Though last
night was merely an experimental at
tempt on the part of the electricians
1o secure the most effective lighting,
the results lead to the belief that "Ride
3i Cock-Horse" will rank with the best
of Stanford productions scenically.
Chrysella Kiler, costumer and chorus
director, together with Tommy Breeze
and Harry Boutell, authors, has done
a great deal of research work in pre
paration for the costumes, both as to
the styles of the time and the prevail
ing colors. The setting is about 1810
in England. Considerable time has
been spent in the Stanford Library
and in libraries in San Francisco
searching for plates and description of
dress in order to obtain the correct
dress.
A moving picture company was dis
covered in Los Angeles that had just
completed a period picture. A large
number of rich and expensive cos
tumes were used which they were
willing to rent to the University for
the production of the Junior Opera.
The quality and newness of these
dresses has enhanced greatly the ap
pearance of the choruses. One costume
worn by William Pabst is the same
one worn by Crane Wilbur when he
made his tour of the Western coast
several years ago in "Beau Brummel."
Leslie Kiler has put his theatre
workshop class to work steadily for
some weeks preparing the most real
istic sets that have been built this
year. He, too, has done a great deal of
research work to get the proper archi
tectural designs in all of the sets. The
last act is in the courtyard of an inn.
Kiler has done exceptionally fine work
with this set, creating the old inn at
mosphere with an original and striking
set.
