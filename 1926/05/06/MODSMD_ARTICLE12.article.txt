# DEBATERS DECRY NEWS SENSATIONS ABOUT COLLEGES
## Euphronia, Women's Society Members Vote 10 to 7 Against Press 
### 
After an hour of open discussion,
members of the Euphronia and Wo
men's Debating Society by a 10 to 7
vote decided last night that the sensa
tional publicity given by the daily
press to American universities was
deplorable.
Katherine Applegate, of the Wo
men's debating organization, charged
newspapers with using campus events
for sensational advertising in order to
sell copies. She not only severely criti
cized newspapers but attacked periodi
cals and novels as being responsible
for the publication of noxious informa
tion.
"The generalizations of college life
as given in 'The Goose Step' and 'The
Plastic Age' are detrimental to the
best interests of American universi
ties," she said. With the broadcasting
of unimportant news which hurts col
leges, endowments are decreased, uni
versity students go astray, parents re
fuse to send their children to the insti
tutions concerned, and an unreal at
mosphere is attached to college life,
according to Miss Applegate.
In several cases the press failed to
print even half of what actually had
occurred, W. L. Gosslin, of the Euphro
nia Society, pointed out, in upholding
the American press. The result of this
publicity was to clean up the causes
of the news. The newspapers compel
us to take action when conditions are
bad. We should not strive to stop such
publicity but eradicate the causes, de
clared Gosslin.
"Stanford receives a great deal of
friendly publicity in the columns of
American newspapers, especially on
athletics, debating, endowment, and
dramatics. What is printed in the
newspapers is just about 100 per cent
true."
The affair was the first of an annual
series of informal meeting between
members of the Stanford Women's
Debating Society and Euphronia.
