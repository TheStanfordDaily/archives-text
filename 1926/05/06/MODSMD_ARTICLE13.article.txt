Kazuo Kawai, '26, is the author of
an article, "Three Roads and None
Easy," appearing in the May issue of
the Survey Graphic Magazine. In the
; contribution he presents the attitude
j of the American-born Japanese toward
business prospects in America.
According to Kawai, members of
| the second generation Japanese in
! America are discriminated against by
j all business and professional men. The j
Japanese communities in the United >
j States are too small to support many;
business or professions by themselves, j
"Yet, placed as we are between the ,
: devil and the deep sea, some of us are
I willing even to take a chance of going
I to Japan to seek our fortunes there," i
j says Kawai. Painting a dark picture
of the prospects of Japanese graduates
from American universities, he finds j
j only three roads open to the race.
"I see some of my friends practically
I admitting defeat and settling down to
i a life of docile servitude. I see others
i
of my friends so impatient that they
| are willing to take the desperate gam-1
ble of trying to adapt themselves to
life in Japan. And I see still others
buckling down to the long and diffi
cult task of trying to change condi- !
I tions."
