### 
Yesterday's intramural results:
Beta Theta Pi 8, Delta Tau Delta 6.
Delta Chi 6, El Campo 5.
Alpha Sigma Phi forfeit to El Toro.
Sigma Nu - Encina Basement, double
forfeit.
Brilliant pitching by Salzman en
abled Delta Chi to maintain a 6-to-5
lead for three innings and defeat El
Campo, last year's championship team,
in a hotly-contested game yesterday.
The mound work of Salzman, ably
backed up by the catching of Sandys,
and the strong batting of half the
lineup, aided the fraternity squad heav
ily. El Campo offered stiff opposition
which narrowly escaped making a tie
score at various points in the game.
Campo Opens Scoring
Britten and Taylor led off in the
first for what seemed like an El
Campo walkaway by scoring two runs.
Delta Chi was unable to hit Britten
until the third inning. At that time,
however, Salzman, Hay, and Frazer
each knocked out a two-base hit, and
the inning ended 3-2 in their favor.
El Campo broke into the lead again
in the last of the same inning when
McCullough slammed out a home run
into left field, which brought in Smith
from second base.
The yelling for McCullough had
hardly died down when Lytel repeated
the performance for the Delta Chi's.
Biaginni, making the fifth hit, brought,
in Sandys and closed the first part
of the fourth with Delta Chi again in
the lead.
Errors by Frazer cut down the ef
ficiency of Salzman's pitching in the
last of the fourth and resulted in a
marker for El Campo. The eating club
squad failed in an opportunity to gain
the lead, and was unable to again
cross the home plate.
Hay brought in the last run of the
game in the fifth. El Campo displayed
very clever infielding which alone
kept their opponents from scoring on
numerous hits.
Betas Win Title
As a result of their 8 to 6 victory
over Delta Tau Delta in yesterday's
intramural baseball play, the Betas
are champions of League VI and will

Yesterday's game was won in the
first inning. Five hits netted the win
ners six runs, Morrison of Delta Tau

Herrington were batted in by Kis
singer, while Mannoccir, Tibley, Mont
gomery, and Strong all crossed the
plate on a series of hits, aided by
errors. Kissinger and Montgomery
scored again in the fifth.
Herrington pitched consistent ball
for the Betas. He is credited with nu
merous strikeouts, and he kept the
Delta Tau batters well at bay. Myer
and Downey scored in the first, Wise
and Mayer in the third, and Wise and
Downey again in the fifth. Delta Tau
poked out eleven hits, while the win
ning Betas gleaned only eight. Super
ior infield work on the part of the win

a minimum.

Delta Chi was unable to hit Britten
until the third inning. At that time,
however, Salzman, Hay, and Frazer
each knocked out a two-base hit, and
the inning ended 3-2 in their favor.
El Campo broke into the lead again
in the last of the same inning when
McCullough slammed out a home run
into left field, which brought in Smith
from second base.
The yelling for McCullough had
hardly died down when Lytel repeated
the performance for the Delta Chi's.
Biaginni, making the fifth hit, brought,
in Sandys and closed the first part
of the fourth with Delta Chi again in
the lead.
Errors by Frazer cut down the ef
ficiency of Salzman's pitching in the
last of the fourth and resulted in a
marker for El Campo. The eating club
squad failed in an opportunity to gain
the lead, and was unable to again
cross the home plate.
Hay brought in the last run of the
game in the fifth. El Campo displayed
very clever infielding which alone
kept their opponents from scoring on
numerous hits.

for the Betas. He is credited with nu
merous strikeouts, and he kept the

ning Betas gleaned only eight. Super
ior infield work on the part of the win

score at various points in the game.
