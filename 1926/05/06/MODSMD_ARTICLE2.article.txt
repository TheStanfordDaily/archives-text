# FIRST EFFORTS FOR CONVALESCENT HOME DRIVE NET SUCCESS
## 
### 
Contributions for the Stanford Con
valescent Home Appeal have been com-!
ing in an encouraging manner, accord
ing to the committee in charge of the j
drive. The student body quota has
been fixed at $1,000, which should be
reached before the week is over. The
drive, which began yesterday, will
<los Wednesday on University Labor
Day.
The Convalescent Home is a distinc
tively Stanford charity. Located on
â™¦he campus and intimately connected
with the Lane Hospital in San Fran
cisco, the Home has become a funda
mental part of the University. Accord
ing to the committee, no other univer
sity aids in supporting a similar char
ity closely connected with it.
The appeal is being made through
the fraternities, sorsrites, eating clubs,
and halls on the campus. Contribu
tions made by members will be turned
in to the fund for that organization.
Collection will be made during the
week-end and again at the end of the
drive.
Any members of the student body
who are unable to contribute through
an organization may send their con
tributions by check to the Stanford
Convalescent Home. They will receive
a receipt and have their names placed
on the roll of the Home's contributors.
It is th object of the appeal to se
< ure one contribution from every mem
ber of the Associated Students rather
than a few large contributions from
isolated individuals.
Stanford and Palo Alto together will
contribute $7,000 to the support of the
Homo during the coming year. Only
$1,000 of this is to come from the Uni
versity students themselves.
