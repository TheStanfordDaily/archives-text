# Colleges and the Press
## 
### 
Euphronia Debating Society last night discussed a very interesting
problem—"Resolved, that we deplore the sensational publicity given by
the daily press to American universities."
Colleges always have been, and always will be, great sources of news.
From early childhood the American is schooled to enjoy stories of college
pranks and college politics.
The taste for such stories is cultivated unconsciously. \\ hen Grimm's
Fairy Tales and Bedtime Stories no longer satisfy the reading thirst of a
youth, he turns to narratives of school life which are so vividly written
that he cannot help but place himself in the role of the hero. And there
he will remain always.
When a university student is mistreated by co-collegians because he is
charged with betraying his Alma Mater, we may feel that the story is not
sufficiently interesting to justify its being printed. Whether we say it or
not. we feel that the subject is one that is incomprehensible to the "butter
and egg" public.
But the newspaperman knows that Americans have been reared on this
sort of stuff; that it will be a real human interest yarn. 'Is there not a
parallel situation in the eighth volume of the Hokum Boys series? Aziah
Whipplesauce who is about to disclose the carefully worked out signals to
the rival team is tied to the Old Oak by Tom, Dick, and Harry Hokum;
and he is not released until after the rivals have been defeated. The
readers fall for this stuff; and they fall hard.
There is the consideration too that the man who has never attended
college thinks the university student a curiosity—a queer specie; and any
items concerning the curiosity are found to be quite interesting, although
the actual event was probably quite trivial. If a mule kicked a man, the
happening would probably be related in three or four lines on a back page;
but let a zebra kick a man and see where the story will be placed.
The newspaper is a buyer and seller of news; and the material it can
glean off a college campus has real reading-interest chiefly because of pre
vious impressions of the reader.
