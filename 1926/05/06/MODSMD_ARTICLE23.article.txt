"Men will run the business of the country while the women will manage
the government in the future." declared Professor Henry Landes, dean of
Ihe College of Natural Sciences at the University of Washington and hus
band of Mrs. Bertha Landes, Seattle's first woman mayor-elect; and the
editor of the Cornell Daily Sun was incited to write the following:
"Dean Landes said that the election of women to office would
soon he the rule instead of the exception. This, we admit, may
happen. But we are very skeptical whether women will ever 'man
age the government' in the future. To do this women would be
forced to acquire the arts of gracefully resting their feet on the
table, wearing derbies, growing double chins, looking prosperous,
and chewing black cigars. We assert that the power behind the
throne will remain for some time at status quo, the typical male
politician, a repulsive animal found only in the United States of
America."
Probably the Sun is overdramatic; but at any rate the advocaters of
male supremacy have little to worry about. Three or four years ago the
male population was alarmed by an influx of women into the business
world. Now. according to Dean Landes, they are moving to a new field
of conquest before they have become definitely established in the first.
It seems that after politics no longer holds a thrill the next move will
be back to the home.
A FEW MONTHS AGO a Certain Student submitted to us a ques
tionnaire which he had compiled on the delicate subject of "necking."
Scores of his friends had been questioned on all phases of the "institu
tion"; and he was anxious that we make the results public. We refused
011 the grounds that the idea was sophomoric and the information was not
of any great social consequence.
Perhaps we are wrong and there are many 011 the campus who enjoy
this sort of rot, for last night we were assailed by the compiler at a meet
ing. He inferred that we were suppressing nc7vs.
