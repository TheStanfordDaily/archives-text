MY DOUBLE
When I was young, it used to be the ladies loved me so,
Whenever 1 went out, you see, they wouldn't let me go.
1 often wished that 1 was free, but everyone said "No"—
But 1 was only two or three, and had a bit to grow.
Was everything upon the stage now known to knowledge, too.
But soon I reached the pesky age, when everything 1 knew
With this, 1 often struck a rage from out the family crew —
But I was at the pesky stage, when 1 was ten and two.
As later clays came to the fore, the ladies grew quite fair
The more I saw, 1 wanted more, and I was in despair.
I sought about for all the lore inscribed of cheeks and hair;
For sixteen is a hectic score for youngsters who are there.
... . ■» j |
At last I've reached the sum oft years allotted to a man,
And wandering in this vale of tears, there's still a gulf to span.
Fair Cupid murmurs in my ears that 1 have got the can.
No wonder that 1 take to beers, for I'm an also-ran.
Oh, true, the ladies like the kind of beauty that I sport.
But, seeking it. they always find their search is very short.
1 chew upon the lemon rind—my double holds a court.
The ladies always troop behind to laugh at each retort.
!
I wonder if the fellow knows—l guess he must, at that, —
That he's a double—if I chose, I'd cut him out so flat!!!
The man who pays, pays through the nose. I'm sure each girl's a cat.
The bum! I'd like to shower blows beneath his cocky hat.
When he comes in attended by the bevy of his queens.
And seats himself, beneath the sky no man shows plainer greens,
Than does the person known as "I." If I were in my teens,
I think that I would sigh or cry or kick him in the jeans!!!
