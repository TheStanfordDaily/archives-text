# IRON MEN
## 
### BY FFG MURRAY 
Every sport has its iron men, those
war-horses of unusual stamina and vi
tality who either carry on for year
after year or else accomplish some
prodigious feat of strength and en
durance within a short space of time.
Boxing has known several of these
"freaks" —men like Joe Grim, "the
man who couldn't be knocked out"
(but was); Tommy Ryan, who held a
title for thirteen years; Johnny Kil
bane, a champion for twelve years;
and Georges Carpeutier, who has been
fighting since he was thirteen. Then
there were Jem Mace, who fought for
forty-eight years, and Bob Fitzsim
mons, whose ring career was only one
year shy of three decades.
Right now one of the ring's iron men
is making ready to regain a title he

! gave up voluntarily two years ago. \
Johnny Dundee fights Kid Kaplan
j early next month, and Dundee fought
| his first ring battle in 1910!
In baseball today there are several
iron men who continue to outplay the
youngsters year after year, though '
their ages hover around the forty-year j
mark. Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Tris I
Speaker, Walter Johnson, Babe Adams,!
and Jack Quinn —all still able to throw ;
a ball. Johnson's career is studded I
; with iron man pitching feats. In 1908 j
he shut out the Yankess in three
straight games. And don't forget Ed j
Reulbach, of the Clubs, who pitched a
double-header against Brookyn and 1
kept the Dodgers from scoring in both
games, and Ed Walsh, who pitched j
, 4G4 innings in one season. Old Cy j

Young pitched in the majors for twen-!
ty-two years, and Iron Man McGinnity
pitched in and out of the majors for
ten years longer than that. Everett
Scott's record of playing in 1307 con
secutive games must be mentioned, too.
Nurmi, with his four Olympic vic
tories in 1924, was one of the iron men
of the running track. On two occasions
he broke the world's record for both
the 1500 and 5000 meter runs within
the space of three hours. Joie Ray
once won two one-mile races in differ
ent cities on the same night. Joie is
still going strong, after eleven years
of competition. Remember Lon Mey
ers? He won four national champion
ships in one afternoon.
Walter Hagen is one of golf's iron
men, but for a continuous string of

| championship play over a long span
i of years, put down John Ball, who won
his first and his latest big titles forty I
years apart, and add the names of
those other great British players — j
! Braid, Taylor, Herd, Vardon, and Ray J
—all of whom still play winning golf
while well over fifty years old. The j
champion iron man of golf, so far as j
endurance goes, is Nick Morris, of San
Antonio, who played 290 holes in a
single day.
Men like Norman Brooks, the tennis
player; Zbyszko, the wrestler; Frank
Kramer, the cyclist; Willie Hoppe, the
, billiards-player; and Jay Gould, the
' court tennis champion, who recently
j defaulted his title after a twenty-year
| reign, were all supermen, molded from
the finest grade of iron ore.

straight games. And don't forget Ed j
Reulbach, of the Clubs, who pitched a
double-header against Brookyn and 1
kept the Dodgers from scoring in both
games, and Ed Walsh, who pitched j
, 4G4 innings in one season. Old Cy j

Young pitched in the majors for twen-!
ty-two years, and Iron Man McGinnity
pitched in and out of the majors for
ten years longer than that. Everett
Scott's record of playing in 1307 con
secutive games must be mentioned, too.
Nurmi, with his four Olympic vic
tories in 1924, was one of the iron men
of the running track. On two occasions
he broke the world's record for both
the 1500 and 5000 meter runs within
the space of three hours. Joie Ray
once won two one-mile races in differ
ent cities on the same night. Joie is
still going strong, after eleven years
of competition. Remember Lon Mey
ers? He won four national champion
ships in one afternoon.
Walter Hagen is one of golf's iron
men, but for a continuous string of

| championship play over a long span
i of years, put down John Ball, who won
his first and his latest big titles forty I
years apart, and add the names of
those other great British players — j
! Braid, Taylor, Herd, Vardon, and Ray J
—all of whom still play winning golf
while well over fifty years old. The j
champion iron man of golf, so far as j
endurance goes, is Nick Morris, of San
Antonio, who played 290 holes in a
single day.
Men like Norman Brooks, the tennis
player; Zbyszko, the wrestler; Frank
Kramer, the cyclist; Willie Hoppe, the
, billiards-player; and Jay Gould, the
' court tennis champion, who recently
j defaulted his title after a twenty-year
| reign, were all supermen, molded from
the finest grade of iron ore.

Every sport has its iron men, those
war-horses of unusual stamina and vi
tality who either carry on for year
after year or else accomplish some
prodigious feat of strength and en
durance within a short space of time.
Boxing has known several of these
"freaks" —men like Joe Grim, "the
man who couldn't be knocked out"
(but was); Tommy Ryan, who held a
title for thirteen years; Johnny Kil
bane, a champion for twelve years;
and Georges Carpeutier, who has been
fighting since he was thirteen. Then
there were Jem Mace, who fought for
forty-eight years, and Bob Fitzsim
mons, whose ring career was only one
year shy of three decades.
Right now one of the ring's iron men
is making ready to regain a title he

! gave up voluntarily two years ago. \
Johnny Dundee fights Kid Kaplan
j early next month, and Dundee fought

In baseball today there are several
iron men who continue to outplay the
youngsters year after year, though '
their ages hover around the forty-year j
mark. Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Tris I
Speaker, Walter Johnson, Babe Adams,!
and Jack Quinn —all still able to throw ;
a ball. Johnson's career is studded I
; with iron man pitching feats. In 1908 j
he shut out the Yankess in three
straight games. And don't forget Ed j
Reulbach, of the Clubs, who pitched a
double-header against Brookyn and 1
