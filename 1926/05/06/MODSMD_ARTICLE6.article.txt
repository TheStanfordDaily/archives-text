# STANFORD SWIMMERS ENTER TWO EVENTS IN WINGED "O" MEET
## Captain Dave Fall to Dive Against Carroll; Smith In Medley Race 
### 
Stanford swimmers will be entered
I in two of the four events of the swim
, ming meet to be held at the Olympic
j Club pool Sunday night at 8 o'clock.
| The Cardinal competitors have even
i breaks for victories in each case.
Dave Fall, captain of the varsity
, swimming team, and the most capable
diver now at Stanford, will compete
|in low-board diving for the Robert
; Smith Trophy. His chief contestant
will be Guprtin Carroll of the Olym
-1 pic Club. Fall and Carroll have once
i before met for the trophy. At this time,
Fall was defeated by a narrow margin
| in the low-board event, leaving Carroll
i one leg on the trophy. The next con
-1 test is regarded as decisive, for the
! final event will be a high diving con
; test, in which Fall is acknowledged to
be Carroll's superior. A1 White, pres
ent A.A.U. titleholder, and one of
Ernst Brandsten's most successful
pupils, will give an exhibition.
A feature 200-yard medley swim will
find Ted Smith, varsity backstroke
i star, competing. Frank Mooney of the
| Olympic Club was figured to win the
j mixed event easily, but Smith's entry
makes it certain that he will have to
set a fast clip if he is to win. Smith is
in wonderful condition and has gone
the 200-yard medley in 2:34. It is ex
pected that heats will be required for
this event so Smith has worked out
accordingly, swimming the distance
twice a day.
I The medley consists of breaststroke,
I backstroke, and crawl, swum without a
stop in the order named. Smith will
be equal or superior to Mooney in
every stroke but the crawl, and should
be able to get a lead in the first two
groups that the Winged "O" swimmer
cannot cut down.
A special 50-yard sprint race and a
novice 220' are also on the program.
