Stanford's chances for breaking th 4
I world's relay record of 16 4-10 seconds
I next Saturday in the rttile were given
ja decided handicap when Bill Storit,
, second man on the Cardinal four, {
pulled a muscle in practice last night. I
' Storie will participate in the event, j
but his time will probably not be his
! best. The injury occurred when the j
; Cardinal quarter pulled up lame fol
j lowing a hundred-yard sprint with
| Jackson Scholz, world-famous sprinter,
' and Lawrence Babcock, also of the
j Stanford relay four.
Stanford heads the list of entrants i
j with fifty men, Olympic Club of San }
Francisco is next with forty-five, and j
University of California and St. Mary's
College have twenty-five each. The
Humboldt Athletic Club and several
other athletic clubs in the bay district
also have strong squads entered in !
the meet.
Stanford will be represented by two
teams, the varsity and freshman
| squads competing for separate point
scores. Coach Dink Templeton's var
sity team is conceded the best chance
to cop the team honors because of the
strong showing made by the Cardinal
track stars in every meet this season.
Relay Chief Event
The chief event of the meet, as far
as Stanford interest is concerned, will
be the attempt made by Templeton's
relay team to break the world's mile
i relay record. The Stanford four-man
' team, composed of Babcock, Storie,
| Richardson, and Miller, covered the
; distance in 3 minutes 19 seconds in
• the Big Meet, even though they were
' not pressed by the California runners.
I The Cardinal mentor believes that his j
men can run under the world's mark
| of 3 minutes 16 seconds if they are
| given opposition in the attempt Satur
i day.
The liop-skip-and-jump, an event
omitted from intercollegiate track
i meets, will probably be one of the
1 most interesting events on the pro
gram. The national champion, Kelly,
is entered in the competition, and his
: work will be a novel sight for most j
; of the spectators. Wally Jayred is en
tered for the Stanford varsity, and his j
distances made in practice mark him j
as a serious contender for the P.A.A.
I title. Kelly's best mark this year is
48 feet.
Five-Mile Race
Another unusual event for Pacific
! Coast meets is the five-mile race. Cum
mings will represent the varsity team
jin this event. The hammer throw is
also listed on the program, but no
; Stanford athlete has entered.
Stanford's star middle distance run
ners may.not enter their favorite races
' in case the relay is held as the last
j event. Templeton wants his runners
to be in the best of condition for the
try at the world's relay mark, and will
not take a chance on tiring them in
the 4<TO and 880.
West and Spencer, of the varsity,
and Nelson, 1929 star, are the main
Stanford entrants in the hurdles. John
son and Ragan of California will fur
nish the principal opposition for the
Stanford timber toppers. The sprints
1 offer a pair of good races with Captain
I Jim Barber of California opposing the
phenomenal Jackson Scholz.
Battle in Weights
A great battle looms in the weight
events. Gerkin of California and Hoff
man of Stanford always put up a great
exhibition, and their best efforts will
probably find an equal in the marks
made by Jack Merchant of the Olym
pic Club. Merchant ifl also a star per
former in the hammer throw and
broad jump.
The broad jump will offer another
chance for Stanford and California
jumpers to appear against each other.
Meeks and Macßae are expected to
place ahead of Bondshu, but Paul
Boren, former California star, is also
in the fight for first place. The high
jump will give Work and King of Stan
ford, and Hampton of California, an
opportunity to break the triple tie set
up in this year's Big Meet.
The P.A.A. meet will give Temple
ton a good idea of the way his men
j,are lining up for the Pacific Coast
i Conference meet in the Cardinal sta-
I dium the following Saturday.
More men have been sent to the
j Olympic games by Chicago University
than any other Western university.
The University of Minnesota will
open a new school of agriculture next
fall.
