Track and field enthusiasts are
promised an interesting meet tomor
row when 250 of Northern California's
star athletes will compete in the Pa

ships to be held in the Kezar Stadium,
San Francisco. The stadium gates will
be open at 12 o'clock, and students
with A.S.S.U. cards will be admitted
for 50 cents.

With fifty experienced performers
entered in every event, Stanford has
an excellent chance to win team hon
ors. The Redshirts are meeting stiff
opposition from athletes of California,
Nevada, St .Mary's, College of the
Pacific, and the Olympic Club.
Even with Bill Storie's lame leg,
the Cardinal relay four are expected to
equal or surpass the present world's
record of 3:15 4-10 seconds. The Olym
pic Club team will be given a forty
five yard handicap which the Cards
will have to overcome to smash the
record. Charley Hunter, Olympic Club
coach, has announced that Joe Pyne,
Karl Fuller, Bill O'Brien, and Winthrop
Crane will compose the O.C. squad.
Relay Men Saved

Miller and Storie will not run the
quarter-mile tomorrow and Bill Rich
ardson is not entered in the 880. Bill
Kerr is the best Stanford bet in the
mile. West and Spencer are certain to
make a good showing in the hurdles,
but will have to beat Swede Leistner
and Ragan.
As Harlow. Joaquin, and Shipkey
are entered in the javelin, Stanford is
certain to take several places in that
•event. Work and King will offer plenty
of opposition to coast high-jumpers
and will again battle for first place
■with Hampton of California.
Hulsman will have an opportunity to
show just how high he can pole vault
when really pressed. Chet Ross is also
•entered.

Stanford will be represented by
strong weight men including Hoffman,
Evans, Fleishacker, Tandy, and Way,
who are to meet Hartranft, Gerkin,
and Merchant.

Two of the special events which are
liound to attract attention are the 50-
and 100-yard dashes ior women.
Wanda Danley, world's woman cham
pion for the 100-yard dash, and con
queror of Helen Filkey, Chicago star,
will face stiff competition when she
