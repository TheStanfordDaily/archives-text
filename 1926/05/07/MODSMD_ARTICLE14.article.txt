# DR. JORDAN DEFENDS LUTHER BURBANK ON RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
## Plant Wizard Was Known As "Strange Farmer" At Santa Rosa 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan paid tribute
to Luther Burbank, "plant wizard,"
last night, when he gave his regular
Thursday evening lecture at his home.
He said that "Luther Burbank may
have been an infidel as far as the
word is meant by those who hurl it as
an epithet at people who do not be
lieve as they do, but Burbank's reli
gion is the only religion that scientists
know. Infidel or not, he was not un
religious. He was much misunderstood
and possessed a nature as sensitive
and delicate as the hand which could
change a grain of pollen- from one
plant to another.
"Burbank's religion was universal,
and if you have any religion at all.
you cannot separate it from that of
Burbank's," continued Dr. Jordan.
"The only religion that is not Bur
bank's is that made up wholly of
forms and ceremonies.
"There has been a great deal of
hullabaloo raised and charges of 'in
fidel' tossed about, simply because Bur
bang enunciated the religion of scien
tific men," he said.
"Burbank's God was not the God of
revenge and punishment, but it was
rather the expression of his own sensi
tive soul and his love for humanity.
Burbank was very religious in his way
and above all was a lover of natural
life.
"There has been considerable worry
about Luther Burbank, just as there
was about Lincoln, because he was
not a member of any organized church.
Most men of science agree with Bur->
bank's conception of religion, however,
as it contains elements which alone
are compatible with modern science."
Dr. Jordan himself was partly in
strumental in Burbank's early success,
for it was he who asked the Carnegie
Institute to provide Burbank with
$10,000 a year, in order that he would
be able to conduct his experiments
without having to sell his products.
Dr. Jordan voiced his respect aftd
admiration for the great botanist.
"Burbank gave his life to his re
researches in plant life and his love
of man. and he never attempted to
commercialize the results of his ef
forts. He was an ardent exponent of
evolution and an artist of nature.
"At first Burbank was not very well
known around Santa Rosa," Dr. Jor
dan said. "People wondered how a
man could expect to get rich by pull
ing up his plants almost as fast as he
planted them, and this 'strange farmer'
was the subject of all sorts of wild
speculation.
"While Santa Rosa was gaping at
this strange farmer and wondering
what he was doing, a man came clear
from Holland, just to see Burbank. He
said Burbank had attracted more at
tention through his experiments than
any other living botanist."

Institute to provide Burbank with
$10,000 a year, in order that he would
be able to conduct his experiments
without having to sell his products.
Dr. Jordan voiced his respect aftd
admiration for the great botanist.
"Burbank gave his life to his re
researches in plant life and his love
of man. and he never attempted to
commercialize the results of his ef
forts. He was an ardent exponent of
evolution and an artist of nature.
"At first Burbank was not very well
known around Santa Rosa," Dr. Jor
dan said. "People wondered how a
man could expect to get rich by pull
ing up his plants almost as fast as he
planted them, and this 'strange farmer'
was the subject of all sorts of wild
speculation.
"While Santa Rosa was gaping at
this strange farmer and wondering
what he was doing, a man came clear
from Holland, just to see Burbank. He
said Burbank had attracted more at
tention through his experiments than
any other living botanist."
Dr. David Starr Jordan paid tribute
to Luther Burbank, "plant wizard,"
last night, when he gave his regular
Thursday evening lecture at his home.
He said that "Luther Burbank may
have been an infidel as far as the
word is meant by those who hurl it as
an epithet at people who do not be
lieve as they do, but Burbank's reli
gion is the only religion that scientists
know. Infidel or not, he was not un
religious. He was much misunderstood
and possessed a nature as sensitive
and delicate as the hand which could
change a grain of pollen- from one
plant to another.
"Burbank's religion was universal,
and if you have any religion at all.
you cannot separate it from that of
Burbank's," continued Dr. Jordan.
"The only religion that is not Bur
bank's is that made up wholly of
forms and ceremonies.
"There has been a great deal of
hullabaloo raised and charges of 'in
fidel' tossed about, simply because Bur
bang enunciated the religion of scien
tific men," he said.
"Burbank's God was not the God of
revenge and punishment, but it was
rather the expression of his own sensi
tive soul and his love for humanity.
Burbank was very religious in his way
and above all was a lover of natural
life.
"There has been considerable worry
about Luther Burbank, just as there
was about Lincoln, because he was
not a member of any organized church.
Most men of science agree with Bur->
bank's conception of religion, however,
as it contains elements which alone
are compatible with modern science."
Dr. Jordan himself was partly in
strumental in Burbank's early success,
for it was he who asked the Carnegie
Institute to provide Burbank with
$10,000 a year, in order that he would
be able to conduct his experiments
without having to sell his products.
