# CURTAIN RISES ON 1927 JUNIOR OPERA TONIGHT
## "Ride a Cock-Horse" Should Set New Mark for Musical Shows WILL REPEAT TOMORROW Desirable Seats Available at Box Office for Both Performances 
### 
Due to an error in arranging the
seat sale last Tuesday for "Ride a
Cock-Horse," the 1927 Junior
Opera, being presented tonight and
tomorrow night in the Assembly
hall, similar blocks of seats for
both nights were left out of the
sale, and will be available at the
box office tonight. This will enable
a few more people to get desirable
seats.

An interesting similarity is shown
in "Ride a Cock-Horse" and the pres
ent day; that is, say about five or six
years ago when Bill and the rest of
the boys came marching home from
the Great War. At the time this scene
is laid, almost exactly a century ago.
the English Tommies were marching
home from the Napoleonic Wars.

Nightriders Feature

The same unrest and discontent is
shown throughout the play that has
been experienced in America since the.
last war. A band of nightriders, under
a clever leader, who is likened to
Robin Hood in his exploits and reck
less love for fair play, were running
loose in the neighborhood of Kent, and
in fact, all over the surrounding coun
try. They terrorized the villagers, and
pillaged the rich. All through the show
these nightriders feature in the back
ground of the plot, giving many com
plications, and rivaling the best blood
of Heidelberg in their songs and
dances.

The Opera is a most expansive rausi
i cal show and represents another stride
i forward in the field of student produc
tions. The script by Tommy Breeze
| and Harry Boutell, the music by sev
! eral campus composers, with lyrics by
the authors and Gregory Williamson,
; have all been taken over by Charles
! Parks, assisted by Leonard Schwartz,
! and have been made into a purely
! Stanford presentation.
