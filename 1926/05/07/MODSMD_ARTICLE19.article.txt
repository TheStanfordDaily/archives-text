# The 						Penalty of Genius
## 
### 
The struggles of a genius passed in review last night at the home of
David Starr Jordan as the Doctor discussed the life of Luther Burbank.
From his boyhood experiments with the Early Rose potato to his last days
of extensive, scientific work with plants, the late Santa Rosa horticultural
ist was pleasantly pictured in the intimate reminiscences of Dr. Jordan.
One fact was outstanding among the hundreds composing the busy
life of Luther Burbank: the mild manner in which he intermittently pro
tested the world's misunderstanding of his activities, With fame had come
publicity and with it suitable newspaper appelations, among them that of
"plant wizard." People traveled to Santa Rosa to see the "wizard whiz"
as though his work were of the side-show variety. This in itself was mis
understanding for the quiet, sensitive Burbank wished only the simple
recognition of work well-done and the inward satisfaction in his success
with plant breeding. In fact, we wonder at times if he would not have
been happier as "the Santa Rosa horticulturist," without the Carnegie
Institute, hundreds of newspapers, and the Pathe News to chronicle his
daily steps.
Then, as if Age were not a bar to further intrusions upon his peace of
mind, he was viciously attacked prior to his death for the declaration that
he was an "infidel." Ignorance only could have brought 011 the fire of
criticism that was directed at him, and ignorance as usual misplaced its
energies. To call Luther Burbank a heathen and irreligious was also to
condemn Peter and Paul and even Emerson for they in their day were
"infidels" in the true sense of the word. "Infidel" in the light of disagree
ment with mass ideas but not disbelief in Religion and God, whether per
sonal or otherwise. No man could love nature and plant life as Burbank
did and not live a religious life whether it was attended by church cere
mony or not. Those who were personally acquainted with Burbank will
go testify^
But it seems always the doo mof genius to struggle not only for
recognition but with itâ€”understanding. History is replete with those
whose efforts in the interest of mankind have been made doubly burden
some by the scoffing criticism of the unbelievers. Let a man touch even
the outer circle of a new and strange group of ideas; and, if he is known
beyond the outskirts of his individual village, someone will attempt his
downfall; whether intentionally or unintentionally is immaterialâ€”the
spirit of the man attacked is injured. It is indeed a misfortune that
Luther Burbank's last days were so saddened by circumstances which
placed him in the light of the "unbeleiver." Nothing could I>e farther from
the truth; but such misunderstanding seems the penalty of genius.
