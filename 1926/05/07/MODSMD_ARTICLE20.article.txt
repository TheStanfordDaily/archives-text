night the Rally Committee decided to present bleacher stunts at
the Pacific Coast Conference meet. This means that the committee mem
bers will have to do some rush work to design and plot the section ; but ac
cording to Calvin H. Conron, chairman, the section will be in readiness
and the stunts, although they will be elementary, will be effective. What
is worrying the committee now is whether ( X) 0 rooters will be willing to
purchase rooters' tickets and take part in the stunts.
The week-end of the meet Stanford will be the host to the Conference
teams and officials, as well as to the alumni. Stanford and California have
made an art of the presentation of organized stunts, and U.S.C. has re
cently adopted the practice. It will be an excellent opportunity to exhibit
our accomplishment to the rest of the Coast universities.
Realizing that there will be a great many men who will not wish to
purchase caps at so late a date in the year, the committee is planning only
card stunts. A white shirt and a rooters' ticket will be the only require
ments for admission to the reserved section.
The student tickets will be placed on sale Tuesday, and will be pro
curable up to the time of the meet.' 1 lowever, if all students who are plan
ning to attend will avail themselves of a seat on the first day, the work of
the Rally Committee will be greatly accelerated, for it will be possible to
lav out the stunts a few davs in advance.
