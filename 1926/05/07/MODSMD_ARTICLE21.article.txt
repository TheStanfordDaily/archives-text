Junior Week activities begin tonight with the Junior Prom in the pa
vilion and the first presentation of the ()pera, "Ride a Cock-Horse." Lake
sports and the Cord Hall tomorrow with the final showing of the Opera
in the evening complete the list of entertainment arranged by the Juniors.
In the Prom and C )pera, the main features of the week-end, the class of
] ( )27 has done an excellent job. The pavilion decorations have been exe
cuted so that the building is quite transformed from its utilitarian purpose.
In "Ride a Cock-llorse" the committee has made a departure from the
usual run of operas to delve back to the Napoleonic era for an original
setting.
The juniors have done well to concentrate into two days so many well
planned events.
