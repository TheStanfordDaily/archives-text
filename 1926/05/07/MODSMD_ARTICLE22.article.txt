THE DEADLY SEX
In days of old the legends say that things were good and true,
And life was worth the living, folks were not like me and you.
Now Grandma—holds the times were best when ladies went to church,
And men came calling, and the maids were set upon a perch.
Against this, you will hear from her that Mother in her day
Had done the boldest kinds of things, and sure had Heck to pay.
While Mother, on the other hand, will tell of how her fun
Was innocent and full of kick, enjoyed by everyone.
\
Instead, she'll pick on daughter who goes out till two at night,
And then comes home and raises Cain^—she'll say it isn't right.
And daughter will bring up the case of older sister's beau,
Who did the things that young men do, and older folks don't know.
She'll speak about his wickedness and sister's parties, too,
And what she'll say is this —you'll find that it is very true:
"The older days are always best in everybody's eyes,"
And this is proof that daughter's words are very, very wise.
When sister fixed her features up before His Honor came,
She plied the selfsame methods used to catch the modern game.
She powdered and she painted and she made her eyebrows blacker
By adding stuff you bought at stores, a sort of darkey lacquer.
But in those days cosmetics were protection from your foes,
Oxide of arsenic was used in powder for your nose;
Antinmony, another poison stuff, was in the paint
That sister used upon her eyebrows, seeming what they ain't.
So mother was not so upset when sister dear stepped out,
She knew she had protection for most any kind of bout.
For if the boy that sister necked had aimed to hit her lips,
And got her cheek instead, 'twas sure he'd passed in all his chips.
No wonder sister was so free to queen and neck and ride,
When she had powers whose demand just couldn't be denied.
And so, the days of old were best, as you can see at once,
No man was going to take his life in hand and be a dunce.
But funny that we have no tale of deaths in times of yore,
A reason for this oddity, we find in modern lore.
The maidens, realizing that they had such powers then,
Afraid to kill their sweeties off, would give in to the men.
Instead of fighting for a kiss, and waking up quite dead,
Cosmetics were protection, but they helped the men instead!!! —L.A.B.

Who is the man in the taxicab?
This question has been baffling many of the most acute minds on the
campus for the past few weeks and has raised the revenues of the taxi
company by no less than 35 per cent, through the efforts of those who ride in
the buggies in the hope of capturing the culprit.
Although the methods of the scoundrel are admittedly ingenious his line
is now getting old and posses are scouring the country in the hope of putting
a horse-hair rope about the adam's apple of the villain. Success in his
capture will be broadcast in a special edition of the Daily.

She knew she had protection for most any kind of bout.
For if the boy that sister necked had aimed to hit her lips,
And got her cheek instead, 'twas sure he'd passed in all his chips.
No wonder sister was so free to queen and neck and ride,
When she had powers whose demand just couldn't be denied.
And so, the days of old were best, as you can see at once,
No man was going to take his life in hand and be a dunce.
But funny that we have no tale of deaths in times of yore,
A reason for this oddity, we find in modern lore.
The maidens, realizing that they had such powers then,
Afraid to kill their sweeties off, would give in to the men.
Instead of fighting for a kiss, and waking up quite dead,
Cosmetics were protection, but they helped the men instead!!! —L.A.B.

Who is the man in the taxicab?
This question has been baffling many of the most acute minds on the
campus for the past few weeks and has raised the revenues of the taxi
company by no less than 35 per cent, through the efforts of those who ride in
the buggies in the hope of capturing the culprit.
Although the methods of the scoundrel are admittedly ingenious his line
is now getting old and posses are scouring the country in the hope of putting
a horse-hair rope about the adam's apple of the villain. Success in his
capture will be broadcast in a special edition of the Daily.
THE DEADLY SEX
In days of old the legends say that things were good and true,
And life was worth the living, folks were not like me and you.
Now Grandma—holds the times were best when ladies went to church,
And men came calling, and the maids were set upon a perch.
Against this, you will hear from her that Mother in her day
Had done the boldest kinds of things, and sure had Heck to pay.
While Mother, on the other hand, will tell of how her fun
Was innocent and full of kick, enjoyed by everyone.
\
Instead, she'll pick on daughter who goes out till two at night,
And then comes home and raises Cain^—she'll say it isn't right.
And daughter will bring up the case of older sister's beau,
Who did the things that young men do, and older folks don't know.
She'll speak about his wickedness and sister's parties, too,
And what she'll say is this —you'll find that it is very true:
"The older days are always best in everybody's eyes,"
And this is proof that daughter's words are very, very wise.
When sister fixed her features up before His Honor came,
She plied the selfsame methods used to catch the modern game.
She powdered and she painted and she made her eyebrows blacker
By adding stuff you bought at stores, a sort of darkey lacquer.
But in those days cosmetics were protection from your foes,
Oxide of arsenic was used in powder for your nose;
Antinmony, another poison stuff, was in the paint
That sister used upon her eyebrows, seeming what they ain't.
So mother was not so upset when sister dear stepped out,
She knew she had protection for most any kind of bout.
For if the boy that sister necked had aimed to hit her lips,
And got her cheek instead, 'twas sure he'd passed in all his chips.
No wonder sister was so free to queen and neck and ride,
When she had powers whose demand just couldn't be denied.
And so, the days of old were best, as you can see at once,
