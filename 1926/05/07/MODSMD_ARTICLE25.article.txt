# INTERCLASS WATER POLO SEASON BEGINS TUESDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Close contests loom for the inter
class water polo championships, the
first games of which will be played
Tuesday afternoon. The sophomores
have a slight edge, although the fresh
men have a capable seven.

The seniors will miss the ability of
Arden Allen and Wally O'Connor, two
of the best varsity players, neither
of whom are registered in the Univer
sity. Bob Williams, one of the junior
mainstays, is also gone. These ab
sences may weaken the upperclass
teams to such an extent that they will
lose to the sophomores and freshmen.

Players who will probably be the
backbone of the seniors are Ted Smith,
Ken Graham, Wardle Poulson, and
Johnny Mack. The junior hopes will
be fastened to Phil Brooks, Art Stew
art, Carl Stevenson, Ewing Sibbett,
Dutch Fletcher, Roderick Ward, and
Bill Hinckle. The sophomore squad is
almost intact with Kryne Van den Ak
ker, Harry Maltby, both this year's
lettermen, Harry Andrews, Herb Klein,
Dixon Smith, Bob Harris, Bob Sims,
Colin Smith, Bill llollingsworth, and
Frank Triest to choose from.

The first-year men will have the ad
vantage of having played together re
cently. They had a high power aggre
gation and many of their players will
make excellent varsity material. In
scrimmage with the varsity early in
the year they played on nearly even
terms.

Bob Burns, Cal Strong, Tom Tliur
low, Fred Thon, Andy Cole, Truman
Parker, and John Doyle comprise the
team. In a contest to settle an argu
ment earlier in the year a sophomore
team defeated the freshmen by a fairly
slim margin.

First contests will be held in the
afternoon at Encina Pool. This team,
whose members have a chance to work
out together once or twice beforehand,
will have a decided advantage over a
pickup bunch so managers of inter
class swimming and water polo are
advised to see that their players are
notified and a time be set for practice.

A twenty-five-acre park on the
ground of the University of Washing
