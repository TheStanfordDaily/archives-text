The Registrar's Office calls atten
tion for the last time to the fact that
next Tuesday, May 11, is the final date
on which applications for the A.B. de
gree to be granted at the end of this
quarter may be filed. The list is now
presumably complete, but any who will
be eligible for candidacy for gradua
tion but who have not obtained the
application blanks at the Registrar's
Office, are warned to do so at once.

Two-thirds of 180 students who had
automobiles at Purdue last year re
ceived one or more conditions in their
studies.
