# Wisconsin Students Aid Criminals With Course
## 
### 
Sociology students at the University
of Wisconsin are making it possible for
several of the inmates of the state
prison to take correspondence courses
through university extension. A fund

for this purpose was established last
year after an inspection tour through
the jails. Small loans are made to pris
oners who will profit from the courses
after their release. The men who are
thus aided are expected to pay back
the money eventually in order that the
fund may be made permanent.
