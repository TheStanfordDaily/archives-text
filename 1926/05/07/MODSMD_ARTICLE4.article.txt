The game in the first three chuckers
was all Arizona. The first score came
after about a minute of play. Good
backing by Brown at No. 4 helped to
keep the ball in play, although the

fast passes and excellent teamwork
of the visitors broke through for the
initial score, made by Saunders after
a heady dribble.

The second chuccker was the biggest
from the Arizona point of view, since
they managed to tally six of their ten
scores in it. Play started with Kenny
Krohn dribbling the ball down the
field, but the Wildcats' backfield play-
era tightened up their defense and
brought the ball out of danger. Hearon
then showed his championship caliber
by rushing the ball to a score down
the sidelines, riding off two Stanford
opponents at the same time. The goal
was made by an easy backhand stroke
in the midst of a muddle of horses and
men.

Stanford Recovers
At the end of the second period, the
game stood 8 to 0, with Arizona still
playing a winning type of polo and
Stanford merely showing four men on
the field. Due to the injury of Schild
man, the Arizona playing softened up,
and the Stanford players got under
way. Vanderburgh started the reju
venation of the Stanford team with a
series of long runs which carried the
ball into Arizona territory to stay for
the first time in the game.

When the horses were shifted after
the third chuccker, the Cardinal came
back strong again. After some passing
back and forth, Vanderburgh angled
the ball through from the right with
a clever cross-shot. A third time the
ball, in play again, lodged at the goal,
but Hearon, on the run in after his
dribbling, snapped it through.

Ken Krohn showed his mettle when,
in the next chuccker, he rode off sev
eral Arizona men to score with a cross
shot at a difficult angle. The entire
team passed to good advantage during
the following set-to, and Thompson
finally rolled the ball through for a
score. As the period ended, another
goal for Stanford was spoiled by the
fast and clever riding of Hearon, visit
ing captain.

The final score of the match was
made by Arizona in the last chuccker,
when Snyder carried the ball down
the field for a clean goal. The next
game will be played Saturday at 2:30
o'clock on the Highway field. The ad

The game in the first three chuckers
was all Arizona. The first score came
after about a minute of play. Good
backing by Brown at No. 4 helped to
keep the ball in play, although the

fast passes and excellent teamwork
of the visitors broke through for the
initial score, made by Saunders after
a heady dribble.

The second chuccker was the biggest
from the Arizona point of view, since
they managed to tally six of their ten
scores in it. Play started with Kenny
Krohn dribbling the ball down the
field, but the Wildcats' backfield play-
era tightened up their defense and
brought the ball out of danger. Hearon
then showed his championship caliber
by rushing the ball to a score down
the sidelines, riding off two Stanford
opponents at the same time. The goal
was made by an easy backhand stroke
in the midst of a muddle of horses and
men.

Stanford Recovers
At the end of the second period, the
game stood 8 to 0, with Arizona still
playing a winning type of polo and
Stanford merely showing four men on
the field. Due to the injury of Schild
man, the Arizona playing softened up,
and the Stanford players got under
way. Vanderburgh started the reju
venation of the Stanford team with a
series of long runs which carried the
ball into Arizona territory to stay for
the first time in the game.

When the horses were shifted after
the third chuccker, the Cardinal came
back strong again. After some passing
back and forth, Vanderburgh angled
the ball through from the right with
a clever cross-shot. A third time the
ball, in play again, lodged at the goal,
but Hearon, on the run in after his
dribbling, snapped it through.

Ken Krohn showed his mettle when,
in the next chuccker, he rode off sev
eral Arizona men to score with a cross
shot at a difficult angle. The entire
team passed to good advantage during
the following set-to, and Thompson
finally rolled the ball through for a
score. As the period ended, another
goal for Stanford was spoiled by the
fast and clever riding of Hearon, visit
ing captain.

The final score of the match was
made by Arizona in the last chuccker,
when Snyder carried the ball down
the field for a clean goal. The next
game will be played Saturday at 2:30
o'clock on the Highway field. The ad
