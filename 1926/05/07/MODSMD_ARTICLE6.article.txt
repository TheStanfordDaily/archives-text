# DONATIONS EXPECTED FROM STUDENTS FOR CONVALESCENT HOME
## Committee Plans to Finish Stanford Campus Drive By Wednesday 
### 
To obtain some contribution from
every member of the Stanford student
body is the aim of the committee in
charge of the Stanford Convalescent
Home Appeal. The committee, headed
by Lindsay Winterbotham, hopes to
complete the campus quota of $1000
by Wednesday.

Of the total quota for Stanford and
Palo Alto of $7000, $1500 will go to
pay off last year's deficit. Last year,
while $33,000 was spent by the Home
in caring for its patients, the income
totaled only $31,500. The San Fran
cisco Community Chest, aided by an
endowment, individual donations, and
contributions from organizations, was
the major support of the Home.

Efficient management has enabled
the directors to take care of each of
the forty children at an average cost
of $2.29 per day, but operating at full
capacity the year around, as the es
tablishment has done, makes necessary
maximum support from all sources.

Lindsay Winterbotham said in re
gard to this work, "Each one is urged
to take some part in maintaining the

Stanford Convalescent Home for sick
and crippled children. It belongs to
the University, and is one of the
noblest means of relieving human suf
fering that any University has ever
undertaken. Every dollar that is given
will go directly to provide food, cloth
ing, and nursing care for these forty
sick and crippled children whose par
ents in most cases cannot afford to
give them the care they need."

Besides Winterbotham, the commit
tee includes: Helen Huneke, Lorraine
Cleaveland, Lester Gordon, Louis
Lundborg, Powell Carpenter, Kenneth
McDougall, and William Fain. These
| students will be in charge of the col
lecting which will be done through
i organizations rather than through in
j dividuals.
Each campus living and eating group
i will have a fund made up of all the
j contributions of its members, and the
totals will be published in the Daily
Palo Alto during the coming week to
show the relative progress of the or
ganizations. Those who are unable to
make their contribution through their
eating group can do so individually by
i sending a check to the Home made
payable to the Stanford Convalescent
! Home.
The Appeal Week will culminate on
I May 12 in the University Labor Day.
Work will be done that afternoon on
the grounds of the Home and will be
followed by a barbecue.

Home Appeal. The committee, headed
by Lindsay Winterbotham, hopes to
complete the campus quota of $1000
by Wednesday.

Of the total quota for Stanford and
Palo Alto of $7000, $1500 will go to
pay off last year's deficit. Last year,
while $33,000 was spent by the Home
in caring for its patients, the income
totaled only $31,500. The San Fran
cisco Community Chest, aided by an
endowment, individual donations, and
contributions from organizations, was
the major support of the Home.

Efficient management has enabled
the directors to take care of each of
the forty children at an average cost
of $2.29 per day, but operating at full
capacity the year around, as the es
tablishment has done, makes necessary
maximum support from all sources.

Lindsay Winterbotham said in re
gard to this work, "Each one is urged
to take some part in maintaining the

Stanford Convalescent Home for sick
and crippled children. It belongs to
the University, and is one of the
noblest means of relieving human suf
fering that any University has ever
undertaken. Every dollar that is given
will go directly to provide food, cloth
ing, and nursing care for these forty
sick and crippled children whose par
ents in most cases cannot afford to
give them the care they need."

Besides Winterbotham, the commit
tee includes: Helen Huneke, Lorraine
Cleaveland, Lester Gordon, Louis
Lundborg, Powell Carpenter, Kenneth
McDougall, and William Fain. These
| students will be in charge of the col
lecting which will be done through
i organizations rather than through in
j dividuals.
Each campus living and eating group
i will have a fund made up of all the
j contributions of its members, and the
totals will be published in the Daily
Palo Alto during the coming week to
show the relative progress of the or
ganizations. Those who are unable to
make their contribution through their
eating group can do so individually by
i sending a check to the Home made
payable to the Stanford Convalescent
! Home.
The Appeal Week will culminate on
I May 12 in the University Labor Day.
Work will be done that afternoon on
the grounds of the Home and will be
followed by a barbecue.
