### 
Chi Psi defeated the Phi Sigma
Kappa intramural nine by a comfort
able margin yesterday, 9-3. Van King,
pitching for the winners, allowed nu
! merous walks and hits, but he was
; well supported in the infield, with
Murphy at first, Ankele at short, Russ
lat second, and Pierce on the third
I sack.
! Eva scored for the Phi Sigs in the
second when he was advanced by a
series of walks given by King to Bruce
and Peck and was batted in by Has
selbach's single. Reed and Eva tallied
again in the third on Bruce's hit, this
I ending the afternoon's scoring for the
i Phi Sigs.
Win in First

The Chi Psi nine actually won the
j game in the first inning. Russ, King,
Ankele, Reeves, and Dunbar all hit
j and all scored. King walked in the sec
! ond and on a succession of bungles
! completed the circuit. Ankele and
I Reeves tallied in the fourth on an
other group of errors, and in the sixth
King and Ankele added two more to
| the score for good measure. These
! latter two men are credited with three
1 runs apiece out of the nine scored by

their team.
Theta Xi Outclassed
The El Capitan-Theta Xi fracas pro
duced nothing startling or notable.
Four of the winners' eight runs came
in the third, when the club batters
hit Follansbee four times, which was
sufficient to score Marsh, Canfield,
Noble, and Silvius. Marsh and Foster
tallied in the first and Fagg and Rouse
in the fourth. El Capitan made six hits
to five for Theta Xi.
Morrison and Freeman were t"he

By Templeton Peck
scorers in the first inning for the fra
ternity men. Scofield douzled in the
third frame, but Canlield, El Capitan
pitcher, tightened, and he died on
base. Only four hits were allowed by
Can field and the fast El Capitan in
field.

Junipero Serra Club continued its
series of victories by closing out El
Cuadro with a no-hit, no-run game
played on the Sequoia diamond yester
day. The clubmen scored frequently
and totaled 14 runs in six innings of
play.

Harold showed up strong for Juni
pero Serra at pitch, although his skill
was not very severely taxed by the
El Cuadro batsmen. McCall, pitching
for El Cuadro, succeeded in holding
down his opponents to two hits and
three runs in the first four innings,
but failed to hold in the last two when
eleven runs were scored against him.
Espsy, Morrison, Scherer, and Negas
accounted for a large part of the win-

ning runs.
