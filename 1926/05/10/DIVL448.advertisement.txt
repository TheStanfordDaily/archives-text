Soft breezes fan your cheek. Fragrance of
the orange grove steals through the window.
What a night for sleep!
Why not bury yourself in bed with a sigh of
content. How cool and inviting the soft bed
linen lies against your skin. How smooth it
is—how restful to the touch!
You bless the thought that led you to store
the linen closet with Pacific Sheets and
Pillow Cases.
Your thrift will please you too, for Pacific
bed-linen is as economical as it is luxurious.
Feel its firm even texture and you know that
it will wear and wear and wear.
