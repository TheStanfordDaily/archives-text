# CARDINALS FAIL IN ATTEMPT AT REPLAY RECORD
## New Hundred-Yard Dash Mark Will Not Stand Because of Winds STANFORD TAKES THIRD Hoffman, Ross, King, Take First Places in P.A.A. Field Events 
### 
Stanford's varsity track and field
team placed third in the thirtieth an
nual P.A.A. track championships at
Kezar stadium in San Francisco Sat
urday. The Olympic Club carried off
team honors by running up a total of
(59 points. Walter Christie's University
of California trackmen were second
with 44% points, and the Cardinal ath
letes took a close third with 41 points.
Stanford freshmen copped fourth place
with 6 markers.
Captain Jim Barber, California
sprinter, broke the existing world's
record when he defeated the nationally
known Jackson Scholz in the fastest
race ever seen on the coast. Barber
turned in a record of 9 5-10 seconds,
which is one-tenth of a second faster
than the present world's mark recog
nized by A.A.U. officials. However, the
Bruin flash was aided by a strong
wind at his back, so it is probable
that the A.A.U. will not accept the new
time was made by Roland Locke, phe
record as being official. The same
nomenal Nebraska sprinter, two weeks
ago, but the record was not recognized
for the same reason.
Hoffman Beats Hartranft
Biff Hoffman, Stanford weight star,
be;it out his former teammate, Tiny
Hartranft, in both the shotput and dis
< us events. Hoffman tossed the iron
ball 47 feet 3 and 7-8 inches, and
heaved the discus 148 feet 9 inches.
Hartranft placed second in both
wents, and Fleishhacker of the Stan
ford freshmen took third in the shot,
while Evans of the Stanford varsity
took a third in the discus.

Hoffman tied for high point honors
with "Swede" Leistner, former Stan
ford hurdle star. Leistner annexed
both hurdles titles. West of Stanford
and Ragan of California finished so
c lose to Leistner that the result ap
peared to be a triple tie. West also
placed second in the 220-yard low
sticks, and Spencer of Stanford took
fourth.
Relay Team Fails
The attempt made by the Cardinal
four-man relay team to lower the
■world's mark for the mile relay failed
by over three seconds. The Stanford
quartet was hampered by the wind.
The time turned in by Templeton's
runners, 3:19 £>-10, is 5-10' of a second
slower than the new Conference mark
sot up by the Stanford four in the
Big Meet.
The Olympic Club relay team, which
paced the Cardinals, started with a
45-yard advantage, but Templeton's |
runners overcame the lead in the third i
lap, and finished the race with 25
yards to the good.
Three Stanford men figured in the
high jump, with Bob King taking first ,
place with a great leap ot' 6 feet 4 1-8
inches. Muhs placed third, and Tom
1 Work fourth.
Record in Broad Jump
The broad jump produced the best i
marks made on the coast this season,
with a new P.A.A. record going on the
books. Martin, former Poly high
jumper, and competing in Saturday's
meet under Olympic Club colors,
leaped 24 feet 1 inch, for first place
and the new record. Merchant of the
Olympic Club, took second with a jump ;
iof 23 feet 10 inches, and Meeks of 1
Stanford placed third with 23 feet 8 j
i inches. All of the first six jumpers
! went over the 23-foot mark.

Chet Ross, who first gained pole j
vaulting fame in this year's Big Meet, j
surprised with a leap of 12 feet 8;
inches, to take first place. Edmonds
| of the Stanford freshmen, and Sterling
j of California tied for second at 12 feet
j G inches. Harlow placed second in the
1 javelin, the event being won by Myrra
| of the Olympic Club with a heave of I
I 198 feet.
No Points in 880
Stanford failed in the middle dis-!
tance events because of Templeton's ,
i stars saving themselves for the at
| tempt to smash the world's relay rec
ord.
Wally Jayred surprised by taking
a second place in the hop-skip-and- j
jump, his best effort being a little:
behind the mark of 47 feet inch j
made by Kelly, the national champion. [
The Olympic Club cinched the meet
with clean sweeps in both the hammer
throw and the 56-pound weight event, i
Neither Stanford nor California were j
;entered in these events.
