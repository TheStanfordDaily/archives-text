# POLO TEAM WINS SECOND CONTEST FROM WILDCATS
## GAME FULL OF THRILLS Captain Trotter's Presence Strengthens Speedy Cardinal Attack 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Playing a fast and consistently hard
hitting game, the Stanford polo quartet
annexed the second contest with Ari
zona by a 5 to 3 score. The unexpected
presence of Captain Fred Trotter in
the Cardinal line-up explains the well
executed comeback of the Redshirts.
His riding and hitting throughout far
surpassed anything on the field, even
the highly-touted "Greatest Collegian,"
Jimmy Hearon. This ends the series
with the Southwestern university, each
team having won a game.

The first chukker opened with spec
tacular running, passing, and hitting
by Trotter. The play alternated up and
down the field, centering mostly
around the goals. All four of the Stan
ford men played hard and fast, and
the resulting speedy contest was the
best seen in a long time. After a rush
during which the play evolved about
a muddle of men in front of the Ari
zona goal, Vanderburgh snapped in the
first tally for the Cardinal. Further
play of the Stanford forwards was im
peded by clever backing, fast stops,
and spectacular pick-ups by Schildman
and Saunders.
Vanderburgh Scores
Early in the second chukker. Trot
ter got going from under his own goal,
and carried the ball down the entire
field, carrying it out at the goal. Van
derburgh later in the play plugged a
hard backhand through for the second
tally. Arizona was held scoreless in the
the first two chukkers.
The game was well contested at all
times, the ball being played usually in
a mix-up of men involving both teams.
Krohn, who had lost a stirrup, ran the
ball to the very goal, where Thompson
passed his miss and rolled it in on a
dribble shot. The first Arizona score
came after a fast play to the Stanford
goal, where Schildman tallied.
Saunders of the visitors' squad
played bang-up polo all during the
match. His runs when started usually
went the entire field. Many shots made
by the Wildcats were hard-luck tries,
for they often slipped out past the
goal. Trotter saved the day often by
his clever backhand tries.
Kenneth Brown, who went in for
Krohn during the fifth period, showed
several good shots. In the run-out of
play following the gong at the end of
the fifth chukker, Trotter came
through with some of the prettiest
j shooting and dribbling of the day. He
j scored on a difficult angle to put the
ball out of play for the period.
Last Chukker Speedy
Speed personified was the last
{chukker. The fastest horses had been
J saved up on both sides, and both teams
went in with the spirit to win. Back
ing by Thompson and Vanderburgh,
and clever riding-off by Trotter, com
bined with the teamwork and passing
of the Arizonans, kept the excitement
at fever heat. Hearon starred for the
I Wildcats here. His shots time and
I again went out at the goal, and his
j clever riding and dribbling gave him
I many opportunities. Finally, one of
the most difficult hit the goal and
oozed through. As the game ended, the
ball was being rushed again to the
Arizona goal by the Cardinal forwards.

the most difficult hit the goal and
oozed through. As the game ended, the
ball was being rushed again to the
Arizona goal by the Cardinal forwards.
The line-up for the contest was as
follows: Arizona, No. 1, Saunders; No.
2, Snyder; Nofl 3, Hearon; No. 4,
i Schildman. Stanford, No. 1, Krohn;

Playing a fast and consistently hard
hitting game, the Stanford polo quartet
annexed the second contest with Ari
zona by a 5 to 3 score. The unexpected
presence of Captain Fred Trotter in
the Cardinal line-up explains the well
executed comeback of the Redshirts.
His riding and hitting throughout far
surpassed anything on the field, even
the highly-touted "Greatest Collegian,"
Jimmy Hearon. This ends the series
with the Southwestern university, each
team having won a game.

The first chukker opened with spec
tacular running, passing, and hitting
by Trotter. The play alternated up and
down the field, centering mostly
around the goals. All four of the Stan
ford men played hard and fast, and
the resulting speedy contest was the
best seen in a long time. After a rush
during which the play evolved about
a muddle of men in front of the Ari
zona goal, Vanderburgh snapped in the
first tally for the Cardinal. Further
play of the Stanford forwards was im
peded by clever backing, fast stops,
and spectacular pick-ups by Schildman
and Saunders.
Vanderburgh Scores
Early in the second chukker. Trot
ter got going from under his own goal,
and carried the ball down the entire
field, carrying it out at the goal. Van
derburgh later in the play plugged a
hard backhand through for the second
tally. Arizona was held scoreless in the
the first two chukkers.
The game was well contested at all
times, the ball being played usually in
a mix-up of men involving both teams.
Krohn, who had lost a stirrup, ran the
ball to the very goal, where Thompson
passed his miss and rolled it in on a
dribble shot. The first Arizona score
came after a fast play to the Stanford
goal, where Schildman tallied.
Saunders of the visitors' squad
played bang-up polo all during the
match. His runs when started usually
went the entire field. Many shots made
by the Wildcats were hard-luck tries,
for they often slipped out past the
goal. Trotter saved the day often by
his clever backhand tries.
Kenneth Brown, who went in for
Krohn during the fifth period, showed
several good shots. In the run-out of
play following the gong at the end of
the fifth chukker, Trotter came
through with some of the prettiest
j shooting and dribbling of the day. He
j scored on a difficult angle to put the
ball out of play for the period.
Last Chukker Speedy
Speed personified was the last
{chukker. The fastest horses had been
J saved up on both sides, and both teams
went in with the spirit to win. Back
ing by Thompson and Vanderburgh,
and clever riding-off by Trotter, com
bined with the teamwork and passing
of the Arizonans, kept the excitement
at fever heat. Hearon starred for the
I Wildcats here. His shots time and
