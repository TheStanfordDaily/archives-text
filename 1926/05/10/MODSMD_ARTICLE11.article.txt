# CATHCART CONDEMNS AMERICAN METHODS OF ENFORCING LAW
## 
### 
Condemning the failure of the Amer
ican police system in making crime ab
solutely "unerringly unsafe," and
scoring the inadequate treatment of
crime and criminals in this country,
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Stan
ford Law School charged the police

and criminal system of the United
States as failing in the government's
fundamental function of protecting life
and property, when he addressed the
California Academy of Social Sciences
at its session held on the campus Sat
urday morning.
America's supremacy in furthering
the existence of crime was pointed out
by the Stanford professor, who gave
figures pointing out the extent of crim
inal acts committeed in this country
contrasted with that of England, as
listed in the Swaney report of the
American Bar Association of 1922.

War was denied as the cause for
crime, according to Cathcart, as crime
existed before the period of the Great
War. Lack of religious instruction was
also decried as a cause. "But," he con
tinued, "there has been as much of
this in other countries as in America,
and their crimes have not increased.
