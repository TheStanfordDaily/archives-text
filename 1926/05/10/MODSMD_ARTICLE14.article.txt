# PAGES OF QUAD ON DISPLAY AT ENGLISH, ENGINEERING CORNERS
## 
### 
Pages from Volume 33 of the Quad
are 011 exhibit this week in the dra
matic council bulletin boards at the
English and Engineering corners.
Especially interesting are the pages
from the dramatic section, which had
drawn favorable comment from Ed
mund Russ, president of the Sierra Art
and Engraving Company, who has
handled the engraving work of this
year's Quad. Typical pictures from the
year section and football sections will
also be shown. Several of the Big
Game section pages will be displayed.
Examples of Pedro Lemos' paintings
and wood cuts which he has done for
the Quad will be displayed.

The setting of pictures in gray pan
els is a feature new to this year's

Quad. A series of cartoon "section
closers" have been done by an English
cartoonist who brought into these car
toons some novel book features from
London.
Despite the conflicting statement
earlier in the year, the Quad will con
tain over 500 pages. The end sheets
this year are printed in three colors
on brown paper stock. They depict a
typical Stanford view, a broad spread
ing oak in the foreground and a field
of golden poppies.

"The "Story of Stanford" has been
j written by Professor Edward M.
; Hulme, who was editor of the Quad in
| 1596. It tells the story of Stanford Uni
i versily in five paragraphs of lyrical
prose. "Youth," a poem written by
i Maxwell Anderson, co-author of "What

Price Glory," received his Ph.D. at
Stanford in 1914, is being reproduced
from a number of "Sequoia" of his
time.

Entry blanks have been mailed to
enter the Quad in the Central Inter
scholastic Press Association's sixth an
nual university year book contest.
