handled the body, to have been dead
about a week, was found late Friday
afternoon by a grass-cutter working
in the west half of the Arboretum near
the State Highway. A coroner's in
quest, conducted by Coroner Amos
Williams of San Jose early Saturday
morning, found the death "from an
unknown cause." A vial of crystals of
a deadly poison found nearby indicated
suicide.
