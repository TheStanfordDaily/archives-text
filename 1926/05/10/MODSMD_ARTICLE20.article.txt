# ANCIENT GREEK WORK OBTAINED FOR LABOR DAY
## Unearthed at Crisco, Greece, Is Considered Oldest Vaudeville Script LARGE CAST PROCURED Short Working Session, Big Barbecue to Precede Entertainment 
### 
An ancient manuscript, begrimmed,
greasy, and with the old Greek writ
ing nearly obscured, was recently un
earth at Crisco, Greece. The work was
deciphered after many years of effort
on the part of Greek professors, and
discovered to be what is considered
the oldest type of vaudeville now
known. Lloyd Nolan, head of the en
tertainment committee for University
Labor Day, which will be Wednesday,
announces that arrangements have
been made to produce this ancient
work as in the original, for its first
performance in the rehabilitated state.

A large cast of experienced actors
have also been procured to portray the
vaudeville. Special costumes, special
direction, and special sets will round
out what is to be one of the greatest
pieces of originality and inspiration
attempted at Stanford for many Labor
Days.
Similar to Modern
The directors state that the method
of alternating lightfoot artists with
acrobats, musicians with buffooners,
and magicians with muscle-grinders,
is very similar to the present mode. In
between the acts the announcement of
performances and other things is done
by a method similar to that in vogue
in the days of King Arthur's notable
tourneys. Other features are being
withheld.

For the first part of the afternoon a
short session of work has been lined
up by Harvey Lvtel, general chairman
of the day. A definite system has been
outlined, so as to shorten the time of
working to the least possible mini
mum. Implements in great abundance
have been procured by the implement
committee, and they state that there
will be no necessity of ambitious men
standing around waiting for a shovel
handle to be released by a perspiring
laborer, in order that they may do a
share of the work.
Immediately after the work, a gigan
tic barbecue lunch will be piled upon
tables, ready for the hungry workers.
While they are munching Sam McDon
ald's barbecued meat and the sand
wiches and other dainties prepared by
the sandwich committee, the enter
tainment will start, and give a rousing
climax to a big day of labor.
