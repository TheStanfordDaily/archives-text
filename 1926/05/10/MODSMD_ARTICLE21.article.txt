# UNDERCLASSMEN LOOK STRONG IN INTERCLASS WATER POLO CONTESTS
## 
### 
Interclass water polo games are
| scheduled to begin Tuesday afternoon
| in Encina pool. Close contests appear
! likely in all games with a slight edge
| for two underclass teams who, on
j paper, appear likely to have the best
I teamwork.
The sophomores, who won the recent
i Swedish Marathon in the Junior Lake
| Sports, will attempt to maintain their
| aquatic supremacy in the water polo
| contests. They should get some high
J class competition from the freshmen
who have played together as a team
the most recently, and who adminis
tered a decisive defeat to the Cali
j fornia freshmen. The juniors may also
i be reckoned with although they will
miss Bob Williams who is not regis
! tered this quarter.
Arden Allen and Wally O'Connor,
I two of the greatest players on the
1 varsity squad, are not enrolled this
quarter, and so will be lost to the
seniors.
Probable members of the sophomore
seven are Kryne Van den Akker, Harry
Maltby, Herb Klein, Bob Harris, Dixon
Smith, Colin Smith, and Bob Simins.
The babe team will be the same as
| the one which met the California year
■ lings. Cal Strong, Bob Burns, and Tru
man Parker in the forward lineup
1 make a hard combination to keep from
scoring. Fred Tlion, Torn Thurlow, and
Andy Cole play in the backfleld, with
John Doyle at goal.
