# The 						Miniature Crime Wave
## 
### 
Saturday morning while Professor A. M. Cathcart was deliberating
on the inability of the American criminal system to eliminate crime there
was at least one motor owner on the campus who discovered that a val
uable accessory had been removed from his car during the night. And
there were probably others.
The number of reported losses is quite alarming; and yet there are un
doubtedly a considerable number of which we know nothing. Two type
writers were removed from the Quad office, one of which was subse
quently returned; over a ton of cable was hauled away from an experi
mental laboratory; and books and auto accessories are constantly disap
pearing. Any one of the thefts, no matter how small, is sufficient to arouse
indignation, for aside from the moral aspect of the situation, the Stanford
community a short time ago was noted for being a spot where property
was secure.
The regular police force on the campus consists of a foreman of out
side property who is also a special deputy sheriff, four watchmen who are
responsible to the foreman, and a part-time motorcycle policeman who
patrols the University roads. On nights of basketball games and As
sembly hall gatherings special officers are hired. At other times detectives
have been employed. For the size of the community the protection is
ample. The solution would appear to be the closer cooperation of the com
munity.
Watchfulness on the part of the students would undoubtedly accom
plish considerable; and no doubt would prove that members of our com
munity are not to blame. When a loss is discovered it should be reported
immediately, or if any campus resident notices a suspicious occurrence
it would be well to notify the police officer. Perhaps laxness in this direc
tion is somewhat responsible for the present condition of insecurity; and
concerted action may put a stop to the thefts. At any rate, it is worth
trying.
if the guilty are students, and we hope that they are not, there is prob
ably some grounds for their brazenness. In the past mis-doers have been
punished by the Men's Council and the sentence has usually been expul
sion. But this, when compared to the treatment which would be accorded
by a law court, is a trivial judgment. It might be better for out-and-out
criminals to be turned over to civil authorities.
