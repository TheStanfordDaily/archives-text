Educationists, newspapers, and others who are more or less continually
finding fault with college publications, could do well at times to consider
all sides of the question. College comic sheets are most often the par
ticular target of adverse criticism, yet from the editors of such magazines
as Judge and Life comes the statement that this field produces wit of the
most spontaneous, most subtle, and most enervating of all types. Nine
tenths of the contributors to the above magazines have had their laboratory
work on college comics, and the editors of the same admit that they con
sider the college humor field their salvation for future copy.
A list of the leading humorists ol" today represents numerous figures
who have written for college magazines. Among these can be mentioned:
George Jean Nathan, dramatic critic of Judge, The American Mercury,
and others, was formerly editor of the Cornell Widow. Cory Ford, con
tributing to the Bookman, Life, Judge, Inanity Fair, College Humor, and
others, is just two years removed from the Columbia Jester.
The Irwin brothers. Wallace and Will, were prominent in luitnor at
Stanford. Feg Murray, nationally known sports cartoonist, at one time
held forth on the Chaparral. John Held, Jr., prolific cartoonist for dozens
of publications, went through a hazardous college humorist experience.
Rube Goldberg, who receives a larger salary than the President of the
United States for creating a few pen and ink sketches every day, was one
time art editor of the California Pelican. Cyril Hume, poet and novelist,
left the Yale Record only two years ago. Booth Tarkington is a former
editor of the Princeton Tiger.
The staffs of Vanity Pair, College Humor, and College Comics, are al
most entirely composed of former college humorists.

Aristocracy waves its ermines at the University of Oklahoma. The
Oklahoma Daily:
"At the recent Hinli School track meet several high school girls were sitting |
in the bleachers with a member of a sorority who was escorting them.
"One of them suggested that each of them buy a package of peanuts. The j
university girl, who evidently doesn't like peanuts, looked disdainful, and was
very emphatic in her refusal to buy them.
"The high school girl looked frightened and decided she didn't want any
cither."

THE DAILY PALO ALTO EDITORIAL STAFF will meet in the
office at 1 o'clock tomorrow. It is imperative that all members be present.
