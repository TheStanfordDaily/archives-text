## PICTURE OF A GUY TRYING TO MAKE AN 8 O'CLOCK 
### Steve O'Donnell 
Our hero turns in at two a.m. after a strenuous night at bridge. Sets
alarm for 7. Deep silence —ZZZzzz. More of same.
Alarm goes off —brrrrrrrrr-ingggggggg —"aw shut up, will ya?" Back to
sleep. Silence —zzzzzzzzz. Wakes up with start—"for heaven's sake, one
minute to eight—" Jumps out of bed; still bleary-eyed, dresses. Goes down
and gargles scupscoffee.
Time, 8:07 "damnit, can't find notebook, where in hell? Oh, here it is..
Now, les see, where was I? Curses on these 8 o'clocks, no time for a smoke."
Dashes down Quad, stumbles on Law steps and tears pants —staggers
onward, ever onward —time, 8:09 —runs into co-ed, knocking her books six
ways to Halifax —picks up books —"Beg your pardon." "Oh, not at all," says
she, smilingly—they talk about the weather, etc., hears bell vaguely—time
8:59 —still talking, but not about the weather. Hears bell, this time dis-
to life —"er —I really must go, I gottta 8 o'clock and there's
the bell. So long."
Dashes again. This trip takes him to the classroom —completely empty,
not a soul in sight. "Well, I'll be damned, after breaking my neck to get here
in time, Prof. Gazookus comes to life and gives us a cut."
And so our hero returns to Quad, pulls out cigarette, and sits down to
wait for his nine o'clock.
He's still waiting.
Moral: 'Tis better to have tried and lost than not to have tried at all.

It seems that some of the organizations that advertise their entertain
ments with chalk signs on the walks think that their duty is done as far as
eradicating the ads is concerned if they pray for rain immediately after the
performance is over.
* * *
One hundred and five of the stickers were recently advertised in the Daily
as being useful to write letters with, etc. And the ad declared that there
was a sticker to express every thought that a college student might have. All
of which means nothing except that the manufacturers of the stickers figure
the average university I.Q. to be about 78.
