# ENGLISH CLASS WILL PRESENT GROUP OF THREE ONE-ACT PLAYS
## 
### 
Three one-act plays, "The Maker of !
Dreams," "The Pot Boiler," and "The
Thrice-Promised Bride," will compose
the program to be presented by the
play production class, English 19b,
tomorrow at 7:30 o'clock in the,
University Assembly hall. No admis-;
sion will be charged for the plays,j
which are sponsored by the Stanford
Committee on Public Exercises.
"The Maker of Dreams," the first |
of the plays which will be presented j
during the evening, is a fantasy, the |
love of Pierette for Pierrot forming the j
nucelus for action. Oliphant Dawn, the :
author, has especially emphasized the 1
lines of the Dream-maker, who speaks
of his ideals and lofty sentiments
throughout the play.
The cast for this production include
Sydney Gray, as Pierrot, the wander
ing singer in a company of strolling
players; Dorothy Fordyce as Pierrette,
the partner of Pierrot, aiul Christopher ,
Hartsough as the old maker of dreams.!
The second play is "The Pot Boiler," I
by Alice Gerstenberg. Miss Gersten-j
berg has incorporated into her farce
many of the old-fashioned ideas of 1
hokum in such a manner as to put
them to ridicule. The famous old plot
of the villain having a strangle hold
on the father, and getting the girl, is :
the theme of the play within the play, i
The scene is a dress rehearsal. Sud, j
the playwright, is directing his latest !
masterpiece. The manner in which he '
bullies the actors and forces them into
their parts is excellently portrayed.
Bv-play between Sud and Wouldby,
mixed with directors to the actors, I
create the atmosphere familiar to all j
who have struggled with amateur pro- j
ductions.
The cast includes Alfred Bruce as \
Thomas Pinikles Sud, the playwright; j
Mr. Wouldby, the novice, Herbert Eox- I
worthy; Mr. Ivory, the ruined father,
George Bogue; Miss Ivory, the sacri
ficing heroine, Clarita Hunsberger;
Mr. Inkwell, the deep-dyed villain,
Kenneth McDougall; Mr. Ruler, the !
upright hero, Robert Syer.

The direction of these plays is under j
Marion Craig Went worth, nationally j
known playwright and artist in dra- |
niatic interpretation. Mrs. Wentworth ;
is being assisted by Helen Lewis and 1
Alfred Bruce.
