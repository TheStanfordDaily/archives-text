# OF INTEREST TO MOTORISTS
## AUTOMOBILE PROVING GROUND PURCHASED BY PACKARD MOTORS Five Hundred Miles of Hills, Level Land Converted Into Testing Area 
### 
The Packard Motor Car Company
has purchased more than 500 acres of
land for an automobile proving ground.
The tract, which lies two miles south
of Milford, Mich., is one of the few
spots in Southern Michigan which is
hilly in character. There is, however, a
large flat expanse, on which it is
planned to build a two-mile speedway.

"Engineers are at work laying out a
number of tracks beside the two-mile
course," says George R. Bury, vice
president of Earle C. Anthony, Inc.
"Some of them will have steep grades,
so that cars ban be given every kind
of road experience. Actual work on the
new, big testing plant will be started
as soon as the frost leaves the ground
in the spring. The speedway, which is
to be only one-half mile shorter than
the Indianapolis motor race course,
will have all turns so banked that cars
of the fastest type can be driven with
wide-open throttle.

"Hills steeper than those found on
any motor highway in the country will
make possible the most severe kind
of hill climbing tests at the new prov
ing ground and any danger lying in
high speed testing on highways will
be removed," he continues. "This ex
tensive development by the Packard
Company not only is for the purpose
of maintaining the development and
perfection of its product but also in
the interest of safety to the public.
