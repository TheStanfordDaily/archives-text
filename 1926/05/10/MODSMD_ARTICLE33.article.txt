# CHRYSLER COMPANY ANNOUNCES ANOTHER SIX-CYLINDER MODEL
## Corporation Plans New Car To Complete Line-up In Major Markets 
### 
The Chrysler Corporation has an
nounced a new six-cylinder car, the
Chrysler "60," at the lowest price at
which a Chrysler six-cylinder car ever
has been sold.
There are five models: Touring,
roadster, two-passenger, coupe, coach,
. and sedan. This new entry into the
field is the fourth to bear the Chrysler
name. Following closely along the lines
that have made the Chrysler "70" and
the Chrysler Imperial "80" supreme in
their respective fields, it completes
i Chrysler dominance of the six-cylinder
! field, and with the four-cylinder model
represents the Chrysler line-up in the
! four major markets.
Entirely New Model
The "60" is not designed to replace
! some other model in the line, but is a
1 wholly new cration, built to supply a
' definite need in the motor car field —
| the need of a six of exceptional quality
! and performance that could be sold
at a low price and occupy a place be
j tween the Chrysler four-cylinder car
| and the Chrysler "70." That this new
j Chrysler "60" does provide such qual
i ity and performance is clearly indi-
I cated by a combination of features
I which are entirely new to the field in
1 which the car will sell and which,
I Chrysler executives believe, make it
' stand apart from other cars in any
| where near the same price group.
