# 1927 OPERA SPOILS GOOD PLOT WITH SLOW ACTION
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
It was once the fashion for Stanford
audiences, gathered in the age-old As
sembly Hall for their annual dish of
Ram's Head or Junior Opera produc
tions, to expect three acts of modern
hokum, "murder will out," the daily
life of the "400," or what have you?
At least it was modern and, as long
as the villain died in three gasps and
the hero sputtered through a hundred
or so lines of love-making, everyone
spent an enjoyable evening.

Then came "Mike" Ely with his 1925
Ram's Head offering of Russian in
cense in "The Devil's Daughter;" later
came Gordon Davis and his cut-back
to "Fashion;" then last week-end we
were presented with the pseudo-his
toric tale of "Ride a Cock-Horse."
There were some who went, expecting
the ancient and honorable plots men
tioned above, and left, feeling they had
been cheated by the absence of their
expectations. The wise ones, however,
were those who saw beneath the slow
action into the true motives of the
two authors, Tommy Breeze and Henry
Boutell, and how they attempted (at
least we believe) to portray a section
of life somewhat different than we are
accustomed to see; to provide plot,
yes, but with enough characterizations

to absorb the interest that would usu
ally be given to standard plots; and to
give the director a chance to use his
imagination in atmosphere, color, and
single character work. Stripped of the
chorus work and atmosphere, the plot
did drag—but what of it? There were
enough clever lines, flashes of imagi
native genius, odd characters, old
vaudeville hokum well interwoven, and
ußiintentional burlesque to more than
take care of the evening's entertain
ment.
Well Directed
The technical work could not have
been placed in better hands. Charles
Parks, the director, and Leonard
Schwartz, his assistant, were given
the responsibility of a script that was
certainly not a finished product (as
have been all amateur scripts) and
the Results Friday and Saturday were
very commendable indeed. One finds
it difficult to comment directly upon a
director's workfi for his credit lies in
the manner In which his actors have
been moulded, the interest has been
bolstered, the color heightened, and
the entrances and exits strengthened.
That is to say, we believe that those
who were on the lookout for such
