# 1927 OPERA SPOILS GOOD PLOT WITH SLOW ACTION
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
It was once the fashion for Stanford
audiences, gathered in the age-old As
sembly Hall for their annual dish of
Ram's Head or Junior Opera produc
tions, to expect three acts of modern
hokum, "murder will out," the daily
life of the "400," or what have you?
At least it was modern and, as long
as the villain died in three gasps and
the hero sputtered through a hundred
or so lines of love-making, everyone
spent an enjoyable evening.

Then came "Mike" Ely with his 1925
Ram's Head offering of Russian in
cense in "The Devil's Daughter;" later
came Gordon Davis and his cut-back
to "Fashion;" then last week-end we
were presented with the pseudo-his
toric tale of "Ride a Cock-Horse."
There were some who went, expecting
the ancient and honorable plots men
tioned above, and left, feeling they had
been cheated by the absence of their
expectations. The wise ones, however,
were those who saw beneath the slow
action into the true motives of the
two authors, Tommy Breeze and Henry
Boutell, and how they attempted (at
least we believe) to portray a section
of life somewhat different than we are
accustomed to see; to provide plot,
yes, but with enough characterizations

to absorb the interest that would usu
ally be given to standard plots; and to
give the director a chance to use his
imagination in atmosphere, color, and
single character work. Stripped of the
chorus work and atmosphere, the plot
did drag—but what of it? There were
enough clever lines, flashes of imagi
native genius, odd characters, old
vaudeville hokum well interwoven, and
ußiintentional burlesque to more than
take care of the evening's entertain
ment.
Well Directed
The technical work could not have
been placed in better hands. Charles
Parks, the director, and Leonard
Schwartz, his assistant, were given
the responsibility of a script that was
certainly not a finished product (as
have been all amateur scripts) and
the Results Friday and Saturday were
very commendable indeed. One finds
it difficult to comment directly upon a
director's workfi for his credit lies in
the manner In which his actors have
been moulded, the interest has been
bolstered, the color heightened, and
the entrances and exits strengthened.
That is to say, we believe that those
who were on the lookout for such
details will readily commend Parks
for his success in general stage direc
tion. His selection of characters was
especially good.
Individual honors must go to Aileene
Burks, playing her last Stanford role,
for her admirable interpretation of
"Joan." Under the influence of the
plot, "Joan" might easily have been
subordinated in importance and, cer
tainly, interest to that of "Larry Pen
der," played by A1 Cass, or even that
of "Master Will Kent" (William
Pabst). As it was, Miss Burks took a
•
firm hold upon her part and played it
with a strength and charm that few
amateurs could put into that of such
a heroine as "Joan." It was in her
range of emotions that she particularly
pleased; changing easily from the sar
castic to the sympathetic, and the
pathetic to the inspired. With her
clear singing voice and sense of humor,
she was unsurpassed during the eve
ning and will be missed in future pro
ductions.
Cass Makes 'Em Laugh
A1 Cass provided his own original
interpretation of "Larry Pender." re
gardless of what may have been its
original meaning, but since no one
really cared about the original—just
so long as Cass made them giggle—he
is to be placed at the top of the ladder.
His ridiculous exaggeration having
brought its usual quota of smiles,
everyone was pleased. Just the same,
we hope some director will bring out
the latent dramatic ability we believe
he possesses.
Velma Randall was unfortunate in
being cast in a re-written and second
hand "Dulcy," but being placed there
she did her best —which was undoubt
edly more than anyone else within
several leagues could have done. De
spite the veneer of simplicity inherent
ly attributed to the role, she gave it a
charming sincerity—paradox though it
may seem.
In appearance, William Pabst, as
"Will Kent," was the typical and per
fect hero. He wore his clothes well,
and the audience instinctively praised
Parks for his selection of Pabst. Hav
ing little opportunity for humor in the
presence of the inimitable Cass, he
was burdened with the difficult role
of true lover, but succeeded well in
carrying it off.
One cannot help thinking of Lucie
Bentley as the vampire, "Diana Gre
ville," and George Bogue as "Captain
Bullington," in the same breath, as it
were. There are many who, playing
the part of "Diana Greville," would
drown it and lose it by a strictly Cleo
patra-like interpretation; but Miss
Bentley saved it from mediocrity by
a light vein of humor that bordered
on burlesque yet was far enough away
to make the role good humor —as it
should be. The pomposity of George
Bogue added much to his otherwise
inferior part.

By a continuous rain of expletives,
Cecil Doll managed to stay in the pub
lic eye—or perhaps one should say,
the public ear, for he was certainly
not long out of hearing. His vigor was
a bright feature of his part as the
unyielding father. John Truman
scored another success in his line of
aged roles, while George Mauser as
the bartender, was all that could be
desired. Frank Baker was a very ex
cellent highwayman, and Rupe't

Adams and Felton Kaufman good at
mosphere. The latter should try "Shy
lock" sometime.
Unusually good orchestrations added
to the flavor of a number of good
songs. Jack Wiggin did well in his
musical direction and should be fur
ther commended for his part in the
actual composition of some of the fa
vorites. "The Doubtful Dilettante" was
probably the cleverest of the offerings,
while "Twilight Time" and "The Night-
Riders' Song" were well appreciated.
The play itself gave an excellent op
portunity for costuming and settings
and Leslie and Chrysella Kiler took
full advantage of it. Only determined
research could result in such effects
as the wedding scene, and others; and
those who said that much of the suc
cess of the production was due to cos
tumes and steps were very near the
truth, at that. The chorus work of both
men and women showed expert tute
lage besides several steps new to the
Stanford stage. And while speaking of
the choruses, it would be well to give
notice of the Ail-American Amateur—
Carol Chandler. Three years' service
have made her a member of the Old
Guard.
The play was fortunate in the in
clusion of two specialties, an exquisite
dance by Barbara Eubanks, and the
usual entertaining clog by Frances and
Hall Boone.
