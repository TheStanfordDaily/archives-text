# Kansas Athletes Adopt Colors of Harvard, Yale
## 
### 
The University of Kansas has dis
covered that the crimson and blue
which it has long used as its colors
are not the official Kansas colors. The
board of regents originally provided
for sky blue and corn yellow.
The blue of Yale became a part of
the colors in honor of the donor of
land for the athletic field, who was a
Yale man. To this was added the crim
son of Harvard, and these two colors
have been worn by Kansa√ü athletes
during all the subsequent years. The
colors have never been officially
changed to the ones now in use, how
ever. /
