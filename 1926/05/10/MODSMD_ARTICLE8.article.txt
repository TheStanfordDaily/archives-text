# THETA CHI RALLIES IN SEVENTH INNING TO BEAT BRANNER I
## Fraternity Men Knock Out Five Hits for Five Runs To Cinch Game 
### 
Friday's intramural baseball results:
Theta Chi 9, Branner I 5.
Encina I won from Zeta Psi by forfeit.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon won from Delta
Upsilon by forfeit.
The Branner l-Theta Chi game was
the only one of the three scheduled
in the intramural series which was
played last Friday, but in the number
of hits which viciously peppered the
infield and outer garden, it made up
for the two forfeits. Not until the first
of the seventh did the splinters begin
to fly from the bats, but in that inning
Theta Chi walked to the plate with a
vengeance and drove out five hits for
five runs, giving them the game, 9-5.
Green hit and went to third on Harris'
single, while the latter stretched his
hit into a double, but not without los
ing a trouser leg in sliding to the sack.
Adams walked, and Dye's fly cleaned
the bases. McKnight scored the last
run on Walsh's clean hit over third
base.
Until the seventh inning, the game
had looked as if it would go to Bran
ner. Steinweden scored in the first and
again in the third, Lindblom tallied in
the second and the sixth, and Wing
followed him across the plate to total
five runs for Branner to four for Theta
Chi. But in the seventh Day blew up
and was hit freely and frequently.
Green twirled for the winners. He al-
Clii. But in the seventh Fry blew up
nated twelve to the fraternity men.
