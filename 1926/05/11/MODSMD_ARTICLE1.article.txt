# GAME LOST BY DEKES PLAYING INELIGIBLE MAN
## Fraternity Plays Freshman Numeral Man Against Intramural Rules THREE GAMES PUT OFF Rogers, Yearling Shortstop, Prevents Tigre Scoring By Lucky Catch 
### 
Yesterday's intramural baseball re
sults:
Branner I 7, Zeta Psi 1.
El Tigre defeated Delta Kappa Ep
silon by forfeit.
Junipero Serra Club defeated En
cina II by forfeit.
Los Arcos defeated Sigma Chi by
forfeit.
Eneina 111 defeated Kappa Alpha by
forfeit.
With three of the five scheduled
-games yesterday going by the forfeit
route, Deltu Kappa Epsilon boosted
the total to four, forfeiting to the El
Tigre nine which, however, the Row
team had defeated by an 8-6 score. El
Tigre was given the game because of
the ruling which prohibits an intra
mural team from playing a numeral
or varsity man, a rule violated by the
Dekes who played Johnny Rogers, 1929
.shortstop, in this position. El Tigre,
undefeated, wins the championship of
League 111 by yesterday's game.
The Dekes, having no expectation
of winning the game from the eating
club team which had heretofore been
invincible, put Rogers in their lineup
lo make the game more interesting.
They were successful, too, for in the
last of the seventh their new player
ran back into his. territory and, leap
ing high in the air, speared a beautiful
liner by G. Prisinzano which would
otherwise have been a double, scoring
James Prisinzano and Linneman, and
.so tying the score for further possi
bilities.
Tomorrow's games have been post
poned to Thursday and Friday, it is 1
announced by C. W. Davis, because of :
conflict with the Labor Day program
tomorrow. Alpha Kappa Lambda,
scheduled to play Phi Sigma Kappa,
will play Thursday on Diamond 111,
while the Breakers nine will meet Se-1
quoia 1 on the Sequoia diamond the j
same afternoon. The game between
Sigma Nu and El Campo has been post-1
poned to Friday, when the two teams !
will play on the Sequoia diamond.
Junipero Serra Club easily cinched
the League * title yesterday by win
ning from Encina II by default. The
club has a clean record and is favored
to make a strong bid for honors in j
the play-offs for the University cham-!
pionship.
Kappa Sigma likewise automatically i
took the League II crown by the for- j
feit of Sequoia 11. Sigma Chi, default-1
ing to Los Arcos, entered into a tie |
with the latter team for second-place I
honors in the same league, while a :
tie for third place was caused by
Kappa Alpha's default to Encina 111. j
Theta Chi Wins
Rallying behind the motto, "Thirty
runs or bust!" Theta Chi completely
eliminated El Cuadro from glory on
Diamond 111. The final score, 30-4, is !
the largest total of runs made this
season. A triple change of pitchers by j
El Cuadro failed to stem the tide of i
hits made by the fraternity men.
The defensive work of the Theta Chi
squad was fairly good. Green at pitch
scored numerous fan-outs, although I
the low record made by El Cuadro at j
bat was due more to the fault of the j
batters than to the pitchers. After the '
first twenty runs, the El Cuadro field- 1
ing became a farce.
Dice brought in six of the Theta Xi
runs, Virag five, and Harris and True,
four each. The victory failed to give
Theta Chi a chance for the league
championship, however, because of a
defeat suffered last week at the hands
of Juniperro Serra Club.
Zetes Lose Again
Zeta Psi closed an inglorious season
yesterday when Branner II walked
away with almost a no-hit no-run game j
by a 7-1 score. Most of the Branner j
runs were made in the first inning.
Wing led off with a single which, with j
the help of another single by Fry and
an error by the Zetes, quickly brought j
him home. Truman and Newmark |
slugged out more singles for the start- 1
ers of the third and fourth scores,
while Hanock made it around for the
fifth run from a walk delivered by ]
Brock, Zete moundsman. Hunt and '
Wing brought in the two runs for the !
final tally of seven.

poned to Friday, when the two teams !
will play on the Sequoia diamond.
Junipero Serra Club easily cinched
the League * title yesterday by win
ning from Encina II by default. The
club has a clean record and is favored
to make a strong bid for honors in j
the play-offs for the University cham-!
pionship.
Kappa Sigma likewise automatically i
took the League II crown by the for- j
feit of Sequoia 11. Sigma Chi, default-1
ing to Los Arcos, entered into a tie |
with the latter team for second-place I
honors in the same league, while a :
tie for third place was caused by
Kappa Alpha's default to Encina 111. j
Theta Chi Wins
Rallying behind the motto, "Thirty
runs or bust!" Theta Chi completely
eliminated El Cuadro from glory on
Diamond 111. The final score, 30-4, is !
the largest total of runs made this
season. A triple change of pitchers by j
El Cuadro failed to stem the tide of i
hits made by the fraternity men.
The defensive work of the Theta Chi
squad was fairly good. Green at pitch
scored numerous fan-outs, although I
the low record made by El Cuadro at j
bat was due more to the fault of the j
batters than to the pitchers. After the '
first twenty runs, the El Cuadro field- 1
ing became a farce.
Dice brought in six of the Theta Xi
runs, Virag five, and Harris and True,
four each. The victory failed to give
Theta Chi a chance for the league
championship, however, because of a
defeat suffered last week at the hands
of Juniperro Serra Club.
Zetes Lose Again
Zeta Psi closed an inglorious season
yesterday when Branner II walked
away with almost a no-hit no-run game j
by a 7-1 score. Most of the Branner j
runs were made in the first inning.
Wing led off with a single which, with j
the help of another single by Fry and
an error by the Zetes, quickly brought j
him home. Truman and Newmark |
slugged out more singles for the start- 1
ers of the third and fourth scores,
while Hanock made it around for the
fifth run from a walk delivered by ]
Brock, Zete moundsman. Hunt and '
Wing brought in the two runs for the !
final tally of seven.
Yesterday's intramural baseball re
sults:
Branner I 7, Zeta Psi 1.
El Tigre defeated Delta Kappa Ep
silon by forfeit.
Junipero Serra Club defeated En
cina II by forfeit.
Los Arcos defeated Sigma Chi by
forfeit.
Eneina 111 defeated Kappa Alpha by
forfeit.
With three of the five scheduled
-games yesterday going by the forfeit
route, Deltu Kappa Epsilon boosted
the total to four, forfeiting to the El
Tigre nine which, however, the Row
team had defeated by an 8-6 score. El
Tigre was given the game because of
the ruling which prohibits an intra
mural team from playing a numeral
or varsity man, a rule violated by the
Dekes who played Johnny Rogers, 1929
.shortstop, in this position. El Tigre,
undefeated, wins the championship of
League 111 by yesterday's game.
The Dekes, having no expectation
of winning the game from the eating
club team which had heretofore been
invincible, put Rogers in their lineup
lo make the game more interesting.
They were successful, too, for in the
last of the seventh their new player
ran back into his. territory and, leap
ing high in the air, speared a beautiful
liner by G. Prisinzano which would
otherwise have been a double, scoring
James Prisinzano and Linneman, and
.so tying the score for further possi
bilities.
Tomorrow's games have been post
poned to Thursday and Friday, it is 1
announced by C. W. Davis, because of :
conflict with the Labor Day program
tomorrow. Alpha Kappa Lambda,
scheduled to play Phi Sigma Kappa,
will play Thursday on Diamond 111,
while the Breakers nine will meet Se-1
