## 
### 
"Although the spirit of international
ism in France is achieving substantial
things, there is danger that those who
are objecting to nationalism may be
j come anti-national," said Professor
Albert L. Guerard who spoke on "The
Spirit of Cosmopolitanism in France"
! before the Cosmopolitan Club banquet
! in the Union last night.
"France has always had traditions
j of internationalism because there have
been many races living there side by
i side. Although they are open-hearted
and open-minded welcoming foreign
ers in public places, the door to the
French home is practically closed.
"The difficulty of the spirit of cos
j mopolitanism is evidenced since
; through it opposition to the traditions
!of one's country and to one's race
j arises."
Professor Payson J. Treat of the
| history department acted as toastmas
