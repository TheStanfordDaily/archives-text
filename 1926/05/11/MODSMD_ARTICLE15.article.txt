# ALUMNI MAY PLEDGE FOR CONCERT SERIES UNDER REVISED PLAN
## Pledges for Season Tickets Are But 1000 Out of Necessary 1300 
### 
With a present total of nearly 1000
student pledges, the committee ar
ranging for the series of six musical
concerts next year ha sset out to get
the final 300 pledges to swell the
amount to the required 1300. Besides
the student pledges, new arrangements
have been made whereby alumni on
the Peninsula will be able to procure
the season tickets for $4. Today a cir
culation was started to put these
pledges in the hands of the alumni.
Faculty members have been allowed
the opportunity of securing tickets at
the same rate as the students.
The planned contract calls for
musicians including Louis Graveure,
Belgian baritone; Mischa Elman, vio
linist, and his string quartet; Tito
Schipa, noted operatic: tenor; and Rosa
Ponselle. leading soprano of the Metro
politan Opera Company of New York.
The low admission price was made
possible by eliminating the profits of
outside managers because of the direct
contracts with these artists, and also
by planning to have the pavilion seat
ed to capacity at each performance.
Large numbers of Palo Alto and
Peninsula citizens have declared their
intention of attending the entire series
if it is given.
