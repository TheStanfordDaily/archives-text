Arrangements Completed

I made reports at a meeting held last
night by Harvey Lytel, general chair
! man. William Hobro, labor head, has
arranged the work in fifteen sections,
placing a responsible man at the head
: of each section, and plans to relieve
the workers in each section with new
men every short interval. Harry
O'Carrol has scoured the campus, cor
poration yards, and downtown, arrang
: ing for implements, and states that
there will be plenty on hand, so that
j no students will need to be idle be
j cause of the lack of tools.
Transportation has been provided
for by Charles Dickenson for all wo
men, and trucks to carry the imple
ments an dother paraphernalia back
and forth to the Home. Lloyd Nolan
: has arranged a special program of
; vaudeville skits, and general amuse
ment which will be headed by Clinton
Mason, well-known clubman of San
Francisco, who has several skits which
' he does for amateur programs.
A new system has been worked out
for the barbecue, whereby four sepa
rate lines may form, two on either
side of Sam McDonald's roasting pit,
j and will complete their forage for
food right on the same line, going to
a separate table for coffee. Philip
! Meyer has charge of finances, and is
handling all disbursement of funds.
The Stanford band will be at the
Home all afternoon, wiving numbers
at various intervals. A raised platform
has been provided on which dancing

to the music of Tyroler's orchestra.
