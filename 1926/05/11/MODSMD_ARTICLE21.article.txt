If all labor in this great universe of ours were as amply rewarded as
will be that expended tomorrow in the annual celebration of Labor Day,
tramps and kings would have nothing to worry about. For two or three
hours of pleasurable toil amongst the ranks of Stanford intelligentisia,
the laborer will receive a list of rewards ranging from a sumptuous ban
quet to Broadway vaudeville. And the most enticing aspect of the after
noon's program is the announcement that there is little hard work in sight.
Many hands make light work, it seems.
Harvey Lytel will be in charge and will have capable assistants, among
them being "Certain Students," long experienced in Convalescent Home
duties; the "Man with a Hoe"; and the "Man with the Feather Duster."
Members of the 500 are welcome, there being numerous plans laid to take
advantage of their many capabilities in addition to the need for their
presence at the dance. Entertainment will be absolutely free and with
Lloyd Nolan and Dave Mannoccir at the helm, it will be worth several
Labor Days. Of food there will be more than plenty. Those who know
will testify to this attribute of Sam McDonald's culinary ability.
Labor Day has long been one of the most pleasing traditions of Stan
ford. There is a degree of unselfishness about the entire idea that is
worthy of the most charitable institution or organization in existence. The
day, the work, and the motive are all humble recognition of the good efforts
on the part of those in charge of the Convalescent Home. A great deal oi
useful work will undoubtedly be accomplished tomorrow, but of equal
value to the institution, we are sure, will be the student body's appreciation
of the Home's existence.
But—no work, no eats.
