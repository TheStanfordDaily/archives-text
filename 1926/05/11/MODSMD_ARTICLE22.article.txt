# Stewart Apologizes
## 
### 
Tuesday the Daily Palo Alto commented editorially on Harvard
University's reaction to the recent screen production of the play, "Brown
of Harvard." In the letter below which was clipped from the Harvard
Crimson, Donald Ogden Stewart, who adapted the play for the motion
picture, makes apologies.
To the Editor of the Crimson:
I have just finished reading Mr. Nichol's review of the "movie"
version of "Brown of Harvard," which I helped adapt for the screen
and I make haste to apologize to all Harvard undergraduates for
the fact that, according to Mr. Nichols, the photoplay is not in the
least like Harvard as it really is.
I am deeply sorry that this has occurred and I can only say in
my defense that when the picture was released, it seemed to me
that the only inconsistencies with Harvard life were the facts that
in the picture there were several good looking girls at the dance and
that Harvard won a football game with Yale.
But apparently I was wrong and, as I have said, I sincerely
apologize.
Yours truly,
DONALD OGDEN STEWART, Yale '16
