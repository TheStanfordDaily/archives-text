# La 						Fiesta Lagunita

### 
The Stanford women's own production, La Fiesta Lagunita, will be
presented on the banks of Lagunita Friday night. From present indica
tions "The Romance of Resanoff and Conchita" will be a complete artistic
success. Every effort is being put forth to make it so.
Produced, as it will be, at night on a larger scale than ever before,
the pageant represents the work of several months by the women of the
University, practically all of whom will take part. Through past suc
cesses the Fiesta has attained the distinction of a University tradition, the
only one founded by Stanford women.
Now that the women are doing everything possible to make the produc
tion a success, the student body as a whole should support it.

The joys of holding forth with an educational institution in a city. The
Silver and Cold of the University of Colorado:
"To the Editor: I want to enter an indignant protest against those fraternities,
who, for the purpose of serenading a sorority, insist upon coming into a quiet resi
dential neighborhood late at night in a dozen automobiles with mufflers open and
with yells and cat calls and then inflicting upon our innocent ears what these simple
souls believe to be music and what their amorous hearts believe to be song."

The roaring Nineties. Item for the "30 Years Ago Today" column of
the mighty Chicago Daily Tribune:
"Special advices received early this morning from Hartford, Michigan, say that
the Pottawattomic Indians, entrenched thereabouts, arc preparing to send a warship
with 200 braves into the harbor of Chicago to collect $45,000 said to be due their
tribe for land along the lake shore."

Oxy students get the cold hand from their president. The Occidental:
"The May Day reception was held at President Bird's house. Ice and .wafers
were served."
