YO, HO! HO! AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!
There is a law on England's books which gives the Admiral rights on sea —
They guarantee to him the stuffs thrown overboard by you or me.
If we should sail from here to there and meet a storm with raging zest.
And, fearing that our goods be lost, we cast off some to save the rest;
Or if we left the sinking ship and in the sea we said our prayers,
If deck loads floated, Admirals would glomrn the dope and call it theirs.
And so this matter of a right to washed-off goods and floating jetsam
Fell to the Admirals, unless the commoners sneaked out to get some.
Our tale is of a winer's ship which sailed away with a load of booze—
The skipper, meeting with a storm, tossed everything, except his shoes.
Sixteen casks of brandy went with one of whiskey, three of wine—
Right merrily they rode the waves until cast up from off the brine.
The populace, on hearing that the wine was floating near the shore,
Trooped out with boats to get a cask or two or three or any more.
They dragged them in, and each one broached a keg and drank enternal health
To wind and storm which gave to them this modicum of liquid wealth.
The Admiral, whose cellar had by now got down to dry estate,
Had also planned on stocking up—his plans seemed doomed to get the gate.
And so he sobered up a bit to see if he could find a rule
Whereby the wine that floated in was his —oh, he was no man's fool!
With this in mind, he made his case —King vs. Twenty Casks of Wine —
And with this start tie ordered up the culprits for a legal fine.
The court was called, the plaintiff held the dirty bums had gone and got some,
By sneaking out when no one looked, and stealing all his legal flotsam.
The judge called the defendants in and asked each fellow's breath to smell,
As this would furnish evidence that any judge could quickly tell.
But when you've had a bit yourself it's hard to catch the other's whiff,
And just about an hour before the judge had been a trifle stiff.
And since the Admiral was just about the same from day to day,
The two of them could find no proof for use to make the culprits pay.
And so the case was thrown aside and never even came to trial,
Because their innocence was proved without a single man's denial.
Oh, would that this was all the tale —we ought to end our story here,
But just imagine what their fate had been if wine, instead, was beer!

But when you've had a bit yourself it's hard to catch the other's whiff,
And just about an hour before the judge had been a trifle stiff.
And since the Admiral was just about the same from day to day,
The two of them could find no proof for use to make the culprits pay.
And so the case was thrown aside and never even came to trial,
Because their innocence was proved without a single man's denial.
Oh, would that this was all the tale —we ought to end our story here,
But just imagine what their fate had been if wine, instead, was beer!

YO, HO! HO! AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!
There is a law on England's books which gives the Admiral rights on sea —
They guarantee to him the stuffs thrown overboard by you or me.
If we should sail from here to there and meet a storm with raging zest.
And, fearing that our goods be lost, we cast off some to save the rest;
Or if we left the sinking ship and in the sea we said our prayers,
If deck loads floated, Admirals would glomrn the dope and call it theirs.
And so this matter of a right to washed-off goods and floating jetsam
Fell to the Admirals, unless the commoners sneaked out to get some.
Our tale is of a winer's ship which sailed away with a load of booze—
The skipper, meeting with a storm, tossed everything, except his shoes.
Sixteen casks of brandy went with one of whiskey, three of wine—
Right merrily they rode the waves until cast up from off the brine.
The populace, on hearing that the wine was floating near the shore,
Trooped out with boats to get a cask or two or three or any more.
They dragged them in, and each one broached a keg and drank enternal health
To wind and storm which gave to them this modicum of liquid wealth.
The Admiral, whose cellar had by now got down to dry estate,
Had also planned on stocking up—his plans seemed doomed to get the gate.
And so he sobered up a bit to see if he could find a rule
Whereby the wine that floated in was his —oh, he was no man's fool!
With this in mind, he made his case —King vs. Twenty Casks of Wine —
And with this start tie ordered up the culprits for a legal fine.
The court was called, the plaintiff held the dirty bums had gone and got some,
By sneaking out when no one looked, and stealing all his legal flotsam.
The judge called the defendants in and asked each fellow's breath to smell,
As this would furnish evidence that any judge could quickly tell.
But when you've had a bit yourself it's hard to catch the other's whiff,
And just about an hour before the judge had been a trifle stiff.
And since the Admiral was just about the same from day to day,
The two of them could find no proof for use to make the culprits pay.
And so the case was thrown aside and never even came to trial,
Because their innocence was proved without a single man's denial.
Oh, would that this was all the tale —we ought to end our story here,
But just imagine what their fate had been if wine, instead, was beer!
