# STANFORD STUDENT MORALS SUBJECT OF MAGAZINE ARTICLE
## 
### 
Stanford's morals are discussed by
Charles A. Selden in the May issue
of The Ladies Home Journal in an
article of a series entitled "Fashions
in College Morals."
In discussing the campuses of Stan
ford and the University of California,
the writer finds that "neither institu
tion has the advantage over the other
in the loveliness of its setting. They
are very different, but both are glori
ous."
Stanford is given a practically clean
bill of health in regard to violations
of the prohibition law. One student
and several of his friends whom were
treated to claret, and a fraternity
house which violated the regulations
against liquor are listed "as the only
records of serious misconducts so far
as liquor is concerned for last year."
President Wilbur is quoted in the
article as declaring: "There was far
more drinking and immorality in my
own undergraduate days than now.
Student opinion is now all against it
and has reduced it to a minimum."
In regard to the conditions for wo
men at Stanford, Dean Yost said:
"Girls are better today than in
my time. They are more frank, but
that does not frighten me in the least.
On the contrary, I have more confi
dence in them because of that very
frankness and their wholesome com
mon sense concerning matters about
which girls of an earlier period had to
be secretive. Girls no longer make mis
takes through ignorance. It is a won
der to me that the young women of
my time turned out so well as they
did."
