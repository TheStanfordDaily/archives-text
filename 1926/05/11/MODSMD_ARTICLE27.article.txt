| Complete investigation of the li
braries of representative universities
throughout the country is being car
ried out by the Carnegie Corporation,

, ings of the main library, and of the
I special and departmental libraries.
Questionnaires on all phases of li
brary work and problems were left in
the hands of the various libraries of
the campus by Professor Works. These
cover the period from 1875 to the pres
ent time, except for universities found
ed after the former date. Statistics for
j these begin at their founding. For most
lof the questionnaires the data from
1875 to 1910 are taken for five-year
periods, and after that annually.
The program of the investigation in
cludes a study of the growth of li
braries and their present relations to
the universities of which they are a
part. Libraries that are independent
or semi-independent of the main uni
versity library have separate question
naires submitted to them.
Many Questions Asked
Questions on the hours of service
rendered by libraries, the number of
their employes, and the time they
spend at work, the circulation of books
and periodicals, inter-library loans,
and extension service form one branch

problem is discussed in its relation to
the expenses of the university as well
as its relation to the library's expendi
tures in former years.
Administrative problems covered by
the questionnaires are such as the re
lation of departmental libraries to the
main one, rules of the library, use of
student help to supplement the regu
lar staff, access to the stacks, effi
ciency in service, publicity, and checks
on the books loaned. Research done

a part of the work on which the Car
negie Corporation desires data.
Reasons for Study

conducting this investigation are
stated as follows: first, to find out to
what extent American universities are
competent as an aid to teaching and to
research, and, second, to determine
the resources, building accommoda
tions, and status of libraries as well as
the financial support. The investiga
tion is being conducted at the request
of a number of universities.
Members of a committee of univer
sity librarians appointed to tabulate
the data when it is all collected, and
to submit the results to the corpora
tion are: Andrew Keogh, of Yale;
William W. Bishop, Michigan; Azariah
S. Root, Oberlin; Frank K. Walter.
Michigan; and Sidney B. Mitchell, of

Reasons for Study
The purposes of the corporation in
conducting this investigation are
stated as follows: first, to find out to
what extent American universities are
competent as an aid to teaching and to
research, and, second, to determine

tions, and status of libraries as well as
the financial support. The investiga
tion is being conducted at the request
of a number of universities.

| Complete investigation of the li
braries of representative universities
throughout the country is being car
ried out by the Carnegie Corporation,
I whose agent, Professor George A.
| Works of Cornell, visited the campus
; recently. Professor Works spent two
days at Stanford, studying the work
, ings of the main library, and of the
I special and departmental libraries.
Questionnaires on all phases of li
brary work and problems were left in
the hands of the various libraries of
the campus by Professor Works. These
cover the period from 1875 to the pres
ent time, except for universities found
ed after the former date. Statistics for
j these begin at their founding. For most
lof the questionnaires the data from
1875 to 1910 are taken for five-year
periods, and after that annually.
The program of the investigation in
cludes a study of the growth of li
braries and their present relations to
the universities of which they are a
part. Libraries that are independent
or semi-independent of the main uni
versity library have separate question
naires submitted to them.
Many Questions Asked
Questions on the hours of service
rendered by libraries, the number of
their employes, and the time they
spend at work, the circulation of books
and periodicals, inter-library loans,
and extension service form one branch
of the investigation. The financial
problem is discussed in its relation to
the expenses of the university as well
as its relation to the library's expendi
tures in former years.
Administrative problems covered by
the questionnaires are such as the re
lation of departmental libraries to the
main one, rules of the library, use of
student help to supplement the regu
lar staff, access to the stacks, effi
ciency in service, publicity, and checks
on the books loaned. Research done
by members of the library staff is also
a part of the work on which the Car
negie Corporation desires data.
