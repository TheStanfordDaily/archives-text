The Editor, Sir:
The members of the cast of "Ride a
Cock-Horse" are to he congratulated
on their production, but it seemed an
injustice to them as well as unbefitting
the dignity of a Stanford assemblage
to mix merchandising with dramatics
by the spirited campaign for the sale
of songbooks put on between the acts.
We expected soda pop, peanut, and
ice cream cone vendors to come next
—perhaps to be followed by a sale of
tickets for an after-curtain Wild West
show.
Much of the pleasure of attending a
theatre is derived from the artistic
atmosphere. The interior decorations
and appointments of our venerable
assembly hall are not especially con
ducive to an atmosphere of beauty,
but that is no excuse for giving it the
tone of an amusement beach. Yepdors
of all sorts, even the program sellers,
are barred from carrying on their ac
tivities within the stadium; and can
you believe that such trades are more
out of place at an athletic event than
at a Stanford dramatic production—
and at that the Junior Opera?
H. D. Swim, '26.
