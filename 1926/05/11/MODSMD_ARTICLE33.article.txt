# ENGINEERS SPONSOR PURIFICATION OF NEW TECHNICAL MAGAZINE
## 
### 
Sponsored by Louis O. Howell, '27,
a meeting of all Stanford engineering
students will bo held Tuesday, May 18,
to decide upon the advisability of, and
plans for, an engineering magazine to
be published monthly by Stanford
Civil, Electrical, and Chemical Engi
neers, as well as majors in Geology
and Mining departments. Semi-techni
cal magazines of this nature are pub
lished by practically every engineering
school of the United States of any
size or reputation, according to How
el, who is initiating work in enrolling
Stanford in this field.
The Stanford magazine, according
to Howell, if modeled after publica
tions issued at the present time, would
contain articles by students, alumni,
and professors, and would deal with
technical subjects, trips taken in the
interest of geological or engineering
work, and articles dealing with sub
jects of interest to students following
the engineering profession. Published
monthly, the magazine would be self
supporting through student and alumni
subscriptions, an dadvertising solicited
by the publication business staff.
A tentative organization of the
magazine publication staff calls for a
board consisting of an executive edi
tor, a business manager, an editor in
charge of the student section, an edi
tor in charge of the alumni section,
and a treasurer-auditor to control
monetary matters.
Among the twenty-one universities
and engineering institutes which at
present are enrolled in the Engineer
ing College Magazines Association, all
with a monthly circulation of more
than five hundred copies, are the "Wis
consin Engineer," the Cornell "Sibley
Journal of Engineering," the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology's
"Engineering News," and publications
of Princeton, Kansas, lowa, Michigan,
and Pennsylvania.
