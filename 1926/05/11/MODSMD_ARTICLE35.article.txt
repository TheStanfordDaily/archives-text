# "THUNDER ON THE LEFT"
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
In a recent issue of Collier's Weekly,
Harris Wills, in an interview by John
B. Kennedy, said, "If Dempsey's afraid
of me, let him say so, and be done
with it. Or maybe some day we'll meet
somewhere when he hasn't got a po
lice whistle, and I'll have some fun."
There are many people who think
that if these two birds ever do meet,
Wills will have as much fun with
Dempsey as Jack Johnson did with
poor old Jeffries back in 1910. Others
agree that, if they met in some alley,
where Wills could get by with his
holding and hitting tactics, the steve
dore would enjoy the party far more
than the heavyweight champion, but
if they ever met in the ring, Jack
would have all the fun.
It's really a crime to add to the
millions of meaningless words that

| have already been written about that
will-o'-the-wisp of the sport world, a
Dempsey-Wills match. They're either
never going to fight, which dbesn't
mean anything, or they are going to
fight, which means about as little, for
each is well past his prime, and the
| combined opponents of both fighters
; since 1919 would scarcely provide Jim
Jeffries with an evening's workout.

Can you imagine Carpentier rocking
Jeffries back on his heels, or Firpo (
push-punching the mighty boilernaaker i
out of the ring? And do you think that |
the man who knocked out Fitzsim
mons and Corbett twice each and
Ruhlin once, and who beat Tom Shar
key twice and Joe Choynski and Peter
Jackson, would stoop to slaughtering
such innocents as Billy Miske, Bill

Brennan, Fred Fulton, Bill Tate, Kid
Norfolk, Tut Jackson, Homer Smith,
John Lester Johnson, Floyd Johnson,
and Charley Weinert? If you do, back
[ up and think again.
What a pity that Dempsey didn't j
! keep his word to be a "Fighting Cham- j
pion." What a battle he and Wills |
would have put up in 1920 ! But cheer i
| up, it really looks as though the;
. "Manassa Man-Mauler" (that was) is I
actually going to be seen in the ring 1
: again, and that's a step nearer to get- '
i ting a new champion than we have i
i been for three years. And what the j
heavyweight division needs more than
anything else is a new champion— j
even if it's a gorilla.
j Gorillas at least never carry police j
whistles.

It's really a crime to add to the
millions of meaningless words that

| have already been written about that
will-o'-the-wisp of the sport world, a
Dempsey-Wills match. They're either
never going to fight, which dbesn't
mean anything, or they are going to
fight, which means about as little, for
each is well past his prime, and the
| combined opponents of both fighters
; since 1919 would scarcely provide Jim
Jeffries with an evening's workout.

Can you imagine Carpentier rocking
Jeffries back on his heels, or Firpo (
push-punching the mighty boilernaaker i
out of the ring? And do you think that |
the man who knocked out Fitzsim
mons and Corbett twice each and
Ruhlin once, and who beat Tom Shar
key twice and Joe Choynski and Peter
Jackson, would stoop to slaughtering
such innocents as Billy Miske, Bill

Brennan, Fred Fulton, Bill Tate, Kid
Norfolk, Tut Jackson, Homer Smith,
John Lester Johnson, Floyd Johnson,
and Charley Weinert? If you do, back
[ up and think again.
What a pity that Dempsey didn't j
! keep his word to be a "Fighting Cham- j
pion." What a battle he and Wills |
would have put up in 1920 ! But cheer i
| up, it really looks as though the;
. "Manassa Man-Mauler" (that was) is I
actually going to be seen in the ring 1
: again, and that's a step nearer to get- '
i ting a new champion than we have i
i been for three years. And what the j
heavyweight division needs more than
anything else is a new champion— j
even if it's a gorilla.
j Gorillas at least never carry police j
whistles.

In a recent issue of Collier's Weekly,
Harris Wills, in an interview by John
B. Kennedy, said, "If Dempsey's afraid
of me, let him say so, and be done
with it. Or maybe some day we'll meet
somewhere when he hasn't got a po
lice whistle, and I'll have some fun."
There are many people who think
that if these two birds ever do meet,
Wills will have as much fun with
Dempsey as Jack Johnson did with
poor old Jeffries back in 1910. Others
agree that, if they met in some alley,
where Wills could get by with his
holding and hitting tactics, the steve
dore would enjoy the party far more
than the heavyweight champion, but
if they ever met in the ring, Jack
would have all the fun.
