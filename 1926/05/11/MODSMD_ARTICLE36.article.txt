# DRUNK MEN ARE MORE RESTLESS IN SLEEP PSYCHOLOGISTS SHOW
## 
### 
New data on the psychology of sleep
ing has been announced by Professor
H. M. Johnson of the Mellon Institute,
Pittsburgh, who told of the results of
his recent experiments at a meeting of
mid-western phychologists.
The eight hours of sleep indulged in
by the average man was shown to be j
a series of eleven-minute periods of,
complete restfulness, interspersed
with periods of restlessness. These re
sults were obtained by placing sleep
ing subjects in a suspended bed which
automatically recorded the occupants'
movements.
The popular belief that drunkenness
causes heavier sleep was proved falla
cious by an adaptation of the same
experiment. An intoxicated man was
put to bed in the suspended couch, but
tossed so vigorously that the experi
mental device was shattered. After
four hours, the subject grew quieter
and slept with reasonable normality.
The psychologists also arrived at an
analysis of the success of Red Grange \
on the gridiron, tracing mental factors !
as direct components to the Ail-Ameri
can star's work on the football field. |
"Psychological treatment," declared C.;
R. Griffith of the psychology depart
ment of the University of Illinois, "en
ables men to build up muscular pro- \
cesses wjiich they could not be coached
to achieve."
