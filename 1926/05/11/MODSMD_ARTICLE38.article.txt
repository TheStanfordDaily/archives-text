# UNIQUE CEREMONIES WILL MARK FIFTIETH ANNUAL I.C.4-A. MEET
## 
### 
Special ceremonies are being plan
ned in conection with the fiftieth an
nual intercollegiate championship
track and field meet which will be
held this year at the Harvard stadium
at Cambridge. William F. Garcelon,
former Harvard varsity hurdler, who
is active in amateur athletics in New
England, is chairman of the committee
in charge of the special features of
the program.
A reunion of former officials and
point-winners is planned as the cen
tral feature. Some of the athletes who
i won prizes in the first meet at Sara
toga in 1876 are expected to be pres
ent, and some of the first " trophies
will be on exhibition. Garcelon has not
j completed his plans yet and is daily
spending considerable time elaborating
on the details of the celebration. On
the program for the reunion are a
parade of the former point-winners
and a get-together banquet. To assure
the success of the plans, some 2000
; point-winners have been asked to at-
I tend the event.
Although nothing definite has been
decided, it is quite certain that all
manner of entertainment will be
planned for the "old-timers," and it is
rumored that a few of the stars, rest
i ing high on the pinnacle of glory
gained in by-gone days, may again
assume an aggressive attitude and
partake in a bit of special competition
such as a tug-of-war, high-wheel bi
: cycle, and other events formerly in
| eluded in this meet.
A complete schedule of the special
ceremonies from flag-raising to the
banqueting, will probably be ready for
publication in a short time. Some of
the brightest luminaries of former
days, from record-breaking performers
i to consistent winners, will be on view
to the present athletic following when
the parade gets under way at the
stadium.
