# YALE VOTES AGAINST DRY AMENDMENT IN UNIVERSITY POLLING
## 
### 
Votes taken, pro and con, on prohi-!
bition and its enforcement are about'
evenly divided, according to pools con
ducted at Yale and the University of i
Kansas. Yale instructors and students
favor the repeal of prohibition, while i
students at the middle-western insti- j
tutions through the proportional repre
sentation plan barely favored prohibi-!
tion. The total Yale vote showed ai
total of 5080 against prohibition, with j
446 for the eighteenth amendment.
The vote at Yale was conducted by ]
the Yale News, student publication,
because the "drys" have singled Yale j
as "an exemplary, law-abiding com
munity," and because Professor
Fisher of that college had voiced the j
same opinion when called befoie the
Senate prohibition inquest.
Professor Fisher stated that Yale
was dry and that drinking was on the j
decline at the school. The "News," fol- J

; lowing the poll, stated that "If Yale is
'to be taken as an example of the
| operation of- prohibition, we are justi
fied in concluding that it is a failure." j
Interest in the vote was high, with
more students participating than in
the recent conflict over the traditional
custom of compulsory chapel. The to- j
tal vote is as follows:
For enforcement of present 1aw.... 446 ,
For light wines and beer 1836 j
For governmental sale of liquor ... 952
For complete repeal of legislation..22B2 ;
Total: 446 for, 5070 against.
