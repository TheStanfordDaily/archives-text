# STRIKE ENDANGERS BRITAIN'S LIBERAL POLICY SAYS STUART
## Controversy Is Question of Supporting Constitution; Not Wage Fight 
### 
"The unfortunate part of the strike
! in England from an international as
pect," said Professor Graham H, Stuart
of the Political Science department
' yesterday, "is that it endangers the
progressive policy with which the Brit
ish government has been handling the
debt question and the other problems
of European despondency. The en
lightened attitude of England toward
! solving the ills of the Continent is now
in danger of failing because of inter
nal difficulties."
The strike is now almost entirely
divorced from the real issue it began
with —the question of reducing the
scale of wages paid to the coal miners
! —and has been made bv the govern
! ment stand in the matter, a question
|of a blow against the constitution,
I according to Stuart.
"The British government is in a
! position where it is forced to win,"
' said Professor Stuart, "and labor can
not back down without wrecking its
party, which now holds a strong sec
! ond place in affairs.
"It must be remembered, however,
j that the strikers are in a minority;
: so any attempt by them to gain the
upper hand by use of force would be
j sure to react against them. A pro
longed strike would likely bring about
i an economic collapse with widespread
I effects abroad."
! Professor Stuart expressed the
j opinion that the present difficulties
may be a beginning of the long-pro
posed plans of the laborists to nation
alize the natural resources of the Brit*
i ish Isles.
