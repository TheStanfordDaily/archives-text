held Monday when the freshmen meet
the sophomores. The meet between
the sophomores and juniors, planned
| for this Wednesday, has been post

points respectively.
Jean Armes, in winning the 25-yard
[ free style, surprised by beating Ade
laide Kelly, the seniors' star sprinter.
Nadine Stewart took a fairly easy
third.
The 75-yard free style was the out
standing race of the meet, Sally Miller
winning by but three-tenths of a sec
ond over Rosalie Walters, a teammate
of hers. For the three lengths of the
pool they raced evenly until Sally
Miller tapped the end before Rosalie
Walters. Both beat the existing ltoble
pool record for the distance and if
j either of them can repeat on Field
I Day she will be a new record-holder.
Lois Hopper won the breaststroke
I easily from Nadine Stewart, who had
1 a good lead over Roberta Richards.
The race was spoiled by many dis
qualifications.
Lucille Burlingame won the plunge
easily for the seniors, beating her
nearest rival, Martha Blackwelder, by
five feet. Elsa Krotozyner was third.
Doris Swayze and Lois Hopper, by
i taking first and second in diving,
cinched the meet for the seniors, so
j that when the seniors won the relay,
the feat merely added to the size of
their score over the freshmen.
The next interclass meet will be
held Monday when the freshmen meet
the sophomores. The meet between
the sophomores and juniors, planned
| for this Wednesday, has been post
poned to Monday, May 24, on account
of Labor Day.
