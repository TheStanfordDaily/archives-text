# A 						CAPELLA CHOIR IS ENGAGED FOR NIGHT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
On the evening of May 17, the
' Smallman A Capella Choir with John
Smallman, founder and conductor, has
been engaged for a concert at the As-
I sembly hall. All the seats for this en
gagement will be reserved and may be
[obtained for 75 cents at the Old Union
' and Cranciall's.
This organization, which has been
! described by ablp music critics as one
j of the greatest of its kind in existence,
!is composed of forty mixed voices,
'singing unaccompanied. Extremely
careful selection was made by John
Smallman from various organizations
of which he is conductor, including the
Los Angeles Oratorio Society, and the
choir of the First Congregational
Church of Los Angeles.
Singing "A Capella" or unaccom
panied, is the purest form of choral
: art, and was the style used in early
' centuries. A Capella means literally,
j "chapel style," hence the reason for
the choir adopting the Italian title.
Percy Grainger, world-famous Au
stralian composer and pianist, en
; dorsed the choir with this enthusiastic
statement: "Last night I heard John
! Smallman rehearse his 'A Capella'
! choir, and it was a revelation to me.
I Though I have heard many fine A
; Capella organizations in various parts
of the world (especially in Holland
and England), I have never heard any
| to approach Mr. Smallman's choir in
j general artistry or technical skill.
"Mr. Smallman accomplishes inde
! pendence of phrasing and shading in
1 the various parts, a vividness of dv
! namic contrasts and a sheer beauty of
j vocal tone that are absolutely new to
jmy ears. Mr. Smallman is indeed a
! true genius in his field and his A
| Capella choir ought to tour the world
i and show that superlative perfection
i Los Angeles and America have reached
j in what is acknowledged to be one of
j the most exacting of all the branches
i of music."
The assisting artist is Vera Barstow,
| noted violinist.
