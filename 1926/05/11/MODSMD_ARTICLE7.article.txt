# TOMORROW LAST DAY OF CHARITY DRIVE FOR HOME
## Students Urged Last Night To Support Movement For $1000 Fund 
### 
I Members of all campus living groups
S were again urged to contribute to the
I Stanford Convalescent Home Appeal
! last night. The Appeal is being brought
1 to the attention of the student body
]as far as possible through organiza
tions. All those who have not been
reached in this way are requested to
i send their contributions to the Stan
j ford Convalescent Home made payable
| to that institution. They will receive
j a receipt and their, names will be
] added to the list of donors to the Home
j for the year.
The Appeal began last Wednesday
and will close tomorrow on University
Labor Day. The student body lias been
! asked to contribute only $1000 of the
total $7000 which it is hoped will be
raised in Stanford and Palo Alto. The
committee in charge of the Appeal,
headed by Linn Winterbotham, aims
to secure contributions from as large
a proportion of the student body as
possible, rather than large contribu
tions from a few.
The Convalescent Home takes care
of sick and crippled children from San
Francisco and nurses them back to
health in the fresh air and natural
surroundings of the campus. The Home
| has a maximum capacity of forty chil- j
| dren and has made the remarkable
' record during the past year of aver
j againg almost 100 per cent of its full
! capacity all the time. Capable manage-1
ment has made it possible to aid the
; largest number of children that could
be cared for all the time, and lias re
duced the cost for each child per day
I to $2.29. Even this low rate when mul-j
; tiplied by the number of forty chil
! dren every day in the year figures up
to $33,000, which were the total ex
penditures of the Home last year. This
exceeded the income of $31,500 so
that there is a deficit of $1500 which
must be paid off first and makes it
additionally necessary that response
to the Appeal be generous,
j On Thursday a complete list of fra
ternities, eating clubs, and halls will
|be prepared containing the amount
contributed by each group. Since the
| Convalescent Home is an institution
| intimately associated with Stanford,
! both in its situation and in its organi
! zation, it is hoped that the $1000 mini
j mum will be far exceeded before the
final contributions go in on Wednes
day, when members of the student
! body will be working on the grounds
I of the Home.
