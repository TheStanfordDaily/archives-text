# CALIFORNIA TRACK TEAMS FAVORED IN CONFERENCE MEET
## Officials Limit Number of Men Eligible From Each University 
### 
Stanford track enthusiasts will have
their last opportunity to watch Coach
Dink Templeton's varsity track and
field team in action on the coast this
season when teams representing every
principal university on the coast com
pete in the Stanford stadium Saturday
afternoon for the Pacific Coast Con
ference title. From all present indica
tions, the best chances for the crown
seem to rest among Stanford, Univer
sity of California, and University of
Southern California, as none of the
northwestern teams have shown
enough strength this season to be
considered as serious contenders for
the team championship.
Conference officials have limited the
number of men competing on each
team to fourteen, with the view of
giving the weaker teams a better
chance against the strong California
college teams. Coach Templeton has
not yet picked his squad, although the
great showing made by a number of
the Cardinal athletes in the P.A.A.
meet last Saturday give him a good
basis for his selection.
Number Limited
The field events will have a most
important bearing on the outcome of
the meet as many of the outstanding
performers on coast teams are entered
in this division of the meet. A great
three-corner battle looms in the weight
events, with Hoffman of Stanford, Ger
kin of California, and Houser of U.S.C.
having about equal chances for first
honors.
Houser is naturally favored to take
victories in both weight events, but
Gerkin and Hoffman, both great com
petitive athletes, will give the Trojan
star considerable opposition. Gerkin
broke Hauser's intercollegiate record
in the shot-put in this year's Big Meet,
and nearly equaled Houser's discus
