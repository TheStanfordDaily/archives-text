# CALIFORNIA TRACK TEAMS FAVORED IN CONFERENCE MEET
## Officials Limit Number of Men Eligible From Each University 
### 
Stanford track enthusiasts will have
their last opportunity to watch Coach
Dink Templeton's varsity track and
field team in action on the coast this
season when teams representing every
principal university on the coast com
pete in the Stanford stadium Saturday
afternoon for the Pacific Coast Con
ference title. From all present indica
tions, the best chances for the crown
seem to rest among Stanford, Univer
sity of California, and University of
Southern California, as none of the
northwestern teams have shown
enough strength this season to be
considered as serious contenders for
the team championship.
Conference officials have limited the
number of men competing on each
team to fourteen, with the view of
giving the weaker teams a better
chance against the strong California
college teams. Coach Templeton has
not yet picked his squad, although the
great showing made by a number of
the Cardinal athletes in the P.A.A.
meet last Saturday give him a good
basis for his selection.
Number Limited
The field events will have a most
important bearing on the outcome of
the meet as many of the outstanding
performers on coast teams are entered
in this division of the meet. A great
three-corner battle looms in the weight
events, with Hoffman of Stanford, Ger
kin of California, and Houser of U.S.C.
having about equal chances for first
honors.
Houser is naturally favored to take
victories in both weight events, but
Gerkin and Hoffman, both great com
petitive athletes, will give the Trojan
star considerable opposition. Gerkin
broke Hauser's intercollegiate record
in the shot-put in this year's Big Meet,
and nearly equaled Houser's discus
1 mark on the same day. Since the Stan
| ford-California meet Hoffman has
j come within a couple of inches of both
I records, so it can readily be snen that
: the weight events will produce a great
battle.
Records Threatened
The coast record in the broad jump
, is in danger of going by the boards in
| Saturday's meet. Sid Meeks, Stanford
I ace, leaped 23 feet 8% inches in the
j P.A.A. meet, which is well over the
| present record of 23 feet 5 inches held
by Flanagan of Oregon. Meeks is
credited with three jumps over 23 feet
G inches in the P.A.A. meet, and his
best jump is just one-half inch under
the present Stanford-California record.
Flanagan will be entered in the meet
Saturday to defend his record, and
Elmer Bondshu of California, who
placed fourth with a leap of 23 feet 7
inches in the P.A.A. meet, will also be
in the competition. Meeks is the fa
vorite to take a first place in the Con
! ference meet, and his teammate, Dick
i Macßae, must also be considered in
j the battle for first honors.
Field Events Close
Bob King, phenomenal sophomore
i high-jumper, looks to be the class of
j coast ozone climbers this year. King
has done consistently around the 6
foot 4 mark all season, and his leap of
; 6 feet 4 1-8 inches in the P.A.A. meet
1 is one of the best collegiate marks
! recorded on the coast for some time.
Hampton of California must always
j be considered as a serious contender
for first-place honors, as should Cogge
' shal of U.S.C. Tom Work has had an
| off season this year, but his tie for
first place in the Big Meet shows that
he is of first-rate caliber.
Chet Ross has made steady progress
in the pole vault since the Big Meet,
and his first place in the P.A.A. meet
,at 12 feet 8 inches indicates that he
i will be in on the finish with the great
j U.S.C. vaulter, Barnes. Hill of Cali
j fornia, holder of the new Stanford
| California record, is another first-place
i contender.
Harlow Favored
Chuck Harlow of Stanford is un
doubtedly the best of coast javelin
throwers and is capable of over 190
feet almost any time. Wenzel of Ore-
I gon is the only northerner that seems
to have a chance in the spear-tossing
; event, and he will encounter a great
ideal of opposition when he goes up
against Tom Joaquin and Ted Shipkey
of Stanford. Cook, the best U.S.C. jave
lin-thrower, rarely goes over the 180-
foot mark, which is not quite good
; enough on the coast this season.
The northern teams cannot be con
sidered as strong contenders in the
! field events, as the California athletes
1 surpass by far any marks set up by
i Washington, Oregon, or Montana per
formers this year. The fight for supre
macy in the field seems to be between
| Stanford, California, and U.S.C., with
none of the three having a very
marked margin of superiority.
The North is fairly strong in the
track events, however, and with the
■ three southern teams fighting for the
1 lead in the point totals the places
j taken by the Northerners will have a
j decided effect upon the final point
j standings.

not yet picked his squad, although the
great showing made by a number of
the Cardinal athletes in the P.A.A.
meet last Saturday give him a good
basis for his selection.
Number Limited
The field events will have a most
important bearing on the outcome of
the meet as many of the outstanding
performers on coast teams are entered
in this division of the meet. A great
three-corner battle looms in the weight
events, with Hoffman of Stanford, Ger
kin of California, and Houser of U.S.C.
having about equal chances for first
honors.
Houser is naturally favored to take
victories in both weight events, but
Gerkin and Hoffman, both great com
petitive athletes, will give the Trojan
star considerable opposition. Gerkin
broke Hauser's intercollegiate record
in the shot-put in this year's Big Meet,
and nearly equaled Houser's discus
1 mark on the same day. Since the Stan
| ford-California meet Hoffman has
j come within a couple of inches of both
I records, so it can readily be snen that
: the weight events will produce a great
battle.
Records Threatened
The coast record in the broad jump
, is in danger of going by the boards in
| Saturday's meet. Sid Meeks, Stanford
I ace, leaped 23 feet 8% inches in the
j P.A.A. meet, which is well over the
| present record of 23 feet 5 inches held
by Flanagan of Oregon. Meeks is
credited with three jumps over 23 feet
G inches in the P.A.A. meet, and his
best jump is just one-half inch under
the present Stanford-California record.
Flanagan will be entered in the meet
Saturday to defend his record, and
Elmer Bondshu of California, who
placed fourth with a leap of 23 feet 7
inches in the P.A.A. meet, will also be
in the competition. Meeks is the fa
vorite to take a first place in the Con
! ference meet, and his teammate, Dick
i Macßae, must also be considered in
j the battle for first honors.
Field Events Close
Bob King, phenomenal sophomore
i high-jumper, looks to be the class of
j coast ozone climbers this year. King
has done consistently around the 6
foot 4 mark all season, and his leap of
; 6 feet 4 1-8 inches in the P.A.A. meet
1 is one of the best collegiate marks
! recorded on the coast for some time.
Hampton of California must always
j be considered as a serious contender
for first-place honors, as should Cogge
' shal of U.S.C. Tom Work has had an
| off season this year, but his tie for
first place in the Big Meet shows that
he is of first-rate caliber.
Chet Ross has made steady progress
in the pole vault since the Big Meet,
and his first place in the P.A.A. meet
,at 12 feet 8 inches indicates that he
i will be in on the finish with the great
j U.S.C. vaulter, Barnes. Hill of Cali
j fornia, holder of the new Stanford
| California record, is another first-place
i contender.
Harlow Favored
Chuck Harlow of Stanford is un
doubtedly the best of coast javelin
throwers and is capable of over 190
feet almost any time. Wenzel of Ore-
I gon is the only northerner that seems
to have a chance in the spear-tossing
; event, and he will encounter a great
ideal of opposition when he goes up
against Tom Joaquin and Ted Shipkey
of Stanford. Cook, the best U.S.C. jave
lin-thrower, rarely goes over the 180-
foot mark, which is not quite good
; enough on the coast this season.
The northern teams cannot be con
sidered as strong contenders in the
! field events, as the California athletes
1 surpass by far any marks set up by
i Washington, Oregon, or Montana per
formers this year. The fight for supre
macy in the field seems to be between
| Stanford, California, and U.S.C., with
none of the three having a very
marked margin of superiority.
The North is fairly strong in the
track events, however, and with the
■ three southern teams fighting for the
1 lead in the point totals the places
j taken by the Northerners will have a
j decided effect upon the final point
j standings.
Stanford track enthusiasts will have
their last opportunity to watch Coach
Dink Templeton's varsity track and
field team in action on the coast this
season when teams representing every
principal university on the coast com
pete in the Stanford stadium Saturday
afternoon for the Pacific Coast Con
ference title. From all present indica
tions, the best chances for the crown
seem to rest among Stanford, Univer
sity of California, and University of
Southern California, as none of the
northwestern teams have shown
enough strength this season to be
considered as serious contenders for
the team championship.
Conference officials have limited the
number of men competing on each
team to fourteen, with the view of
giving the weaker teams a better
chance against the strong California
college teams. Coach Templeton has
not yet picked his squad, although the
great showing made by a number of

in the shot-put in this year's Big Meet,
and nearly equaled Houser's discus
1 mark on the same day. Since the Stan
| ford-California meet Hoffman has
j come within a couple of inches of both
I records, so it can readily be snen that
: the weight events will produce a great
battle.
Records Threatened
The coast record in the broad jump
, is in danger of going by the boards in
| Saturday's meet. Sid Meeks, Stanford
I ace, leaped 23 feet 8% inches in the
j P.A.A. meet, which is well over the
| present record of 23 feet 5 inches held
by Flanagan of Oregon. Meeks is
credited with three jumps over 23 feet
G inches in the P.A.A. meet, and his
best jump is just one-half inch under
the present Stanford-California record.
Flanagan will be entered in the meet
Saturday to defend his record, and
Elmer Bondshu of California, who
placed fourth with a leap of 23 feet 7
inches in the P.A.A. meet, will also be
in the competition. Meeks is the fa
vorite to take a first place in the Con
! ference meet, and his teammate, Dick
i Macßae, must also be considered in
j the battle for first honors.
Field Events Close
Bob King, phenomenal sophomore
i high-jumper, looks to be the class of
j coast ozone climbers this year. King
has done consistently around the 6
foot 4 mark all season, and his leap of
; 6 feet 4 1-8 inches in the P.A.A. meet
1 is one of the best collegiate marks
! recorded on the coast for some time.
Hampton of California must always
j be considered as a serious contender
for first-place honors, as should Cogge
' shal of U.S.C. Tom Work has had an
| off season this year, but his tie for
first place in the Big Meet shows that
he is of first-rate caliber.
Chet Ross has made steady progress
in the pole vault since the Big Meet,
and his first place in the P.A.A. meet
,at 12 feet 8 inches indicates that he
i will be in on the finish with the great
j U.S.C. vaulter, Barnes. Hill of Cali
j fornia, holder of the new Stanford
| California record, is another first-place
i contender.
Harlow Favored
Chuck Harlow of Stanford is un
doubtedly the best of coast javelin
throwers and is capable of over 190
feet almost any time. Wenzel of Ore-
I gon is the only northerner that seems
to have a chance in the spear-tossing
; event, and he will encounter a great
ideal of opposition when he goes up
against Tom Joaquin and Ted Shipkey
of Stanford. Cook, the best U.S.C. jave
lin-thrower, rarely goes over the 180-
foot mark, which is not quite good
; enough on the coast this season.
The northern teams cannot be con
sidered as strong contenders in the
! field events, as the California athletes
1 surpass by far any marks set up by
i Washington, Oregon, or Montana per
formers this year. The fight for supre
macy in the field seems to be between
| Stanford, California, and U.S.C., with
none of the three having a very
marked margin of superiority.
The North is fairly strong in the
track events, however, and with the
■ three southern teams fighting for the
1 lead in the point totals the places
j taken by the Northerners will have a
j decided effect upon the final point
j standings.
Stanford track enthusiasts will have
their last opportunity to watch Coach
Dink Templeton's varsity track and
field team in action on the coast this
season when teams representing every
principal university on the coast com
pete in the Stanford stadium Saturday
afternoon for the Pacific Coast Con
ference title. From all present indica
tions, the best chances for the crown
seem to rest among Stanford, Univer
sity of California, and University of
Southern California, as none of the
northwestern teams have shown
enough strength this season to be
considered as serious contenders for
the team championship.
Conference officials have limited the
number of men competing on each
team to fourteen, with the view of
giving the weaker teams a better
chance against the strong California
college teams. Coach Templeton has
not yet picked his squad, although the
great showing made by a number of
the Cardinal athletes in the P.A.A.
meet last Saturday give him a good
basis for his selection.
Number Limited
The field events will have a most
important bearing on the outcome of
the meet as many of the outstanding
performers on coast teams are entered
in this division of the meet. A great
three-corner battle looms in the weight
events, with Hoffman of Stanford, Ger
kin of California, and Houser of U.S.C.
having about equal chances for first
honors.
Houser is naturally favored to take
victories in both weight events, but
Gerkin and Hoffman, both great com
petitive athletes, will give the Trojan
star considerable opposition. Gerkin
broke Hauser's intercollegiate record
in the shot-put in this year's Big Meet,
and nearly equaled Houser's discus
1 mark on the same day. Since the Stan
| ford-California meet Hoffman has
j come within a couple of inches of both
