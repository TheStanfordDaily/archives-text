# NATION'S BEST 880 MEN RACE IN P.C.C. MEET
## Firsts in Javelin, High Jump Should Increase Card Point Total MILLER FAVORED IN 440 Richardson Given Edge Over Rivals; Percy Niersbach Close Competitor 
### Clif Moore 
Five of the greatest half-milers in
the Uhited States will compete in the
feature event of the Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field meet in the
Stanford stadium next Saturday after
noon. Captain Bill Richardson of Staf
ford, Boyden of California, Charteris
•of Washington, Gillette of Montana,
and Niersbach of U.S.C., are rated as
(he fastest two-lap runners in the
country, and their race for first honors
.Saturday should produce one of the
greatest struggles in coast conference
track history.
Richardson is given the edge over
his rivals because of his sensational
showing in the Stanford-California
meet this year. The Cardinal captain
beat his old rival, Boyden, by ten
yards in the Big Meet, setting a new
Stanford-California record for the half
mile. Charteris won the Washington-
Oregon 880 last Saturday in 1.58 on
a slow, muddy track, but his fast race
in the Coast Conference meet last
year, in which he defeated both Rich
ardson and Boyden, marks him as a
■dangerous contender for first place.
Richardson Favored
Niersbach of U.S.C. has negotiated
the two laps in 1.56 or better all sea
son, and when pitted against his three
fast rivals, should come through with
even better time. The 880 seems to be
anybody's race, but the concensus of
opinion gives the Cardinal skipper a
slight edge over the other runners.
Kichardson is at the height of his
form, and his performance Saturday
should result in a time mighty close
to the national and world's 880 record.
The Washington team arrived in
Palo Alto yesterday and worked out
in the stadium for a few hours in the
afternoon. Charteris and Wilde, two
of the Northern stars, looked to be in
fine condition.
Stanford undoubtedly has a decided
edge in the quarter-mile, with Temple
ton's famous trio, Miller, Storie, and
Babcock recognized as the best of
Coast one-lap artists. Miller has
smashed the Stanford-California mark
for two successive years, and has ne
gotiated the 440 under 49 seconds in
nearly every meet this season.
Storie vs. Miller
Storie is right behind the Cardinal
flash in every race, and the big fight
for first place in the conference meet
seems to be between him and Miller.
Babcock is not yet capable of keeping
up with his two teammates, but his
best effort is good enough to defeat
the rest of the Coast 440 runners.
Stanford's great strength in the
quarter-mile will do much toward add
ing a number of needed points to the
Stanford total. With a probable vic
tory in the half-mile, one or two places
in the javelin, a first in the high jump,
and a good chance for a first place in
the broad jump, as well as sure points
in the weight events, hurdles, and pole
vault, the Stanford athletes should
amass enough points to bring them
■close to the Coast Conference title.
