# ONE-ACT PLAYLETS WELL RECEIVED BY CAMPUS AUDIENCE
## CHINA PRODUCTION BEST Mrs. Wentworth's Dramatic Students Please With Good Presentation 
### Calvin Behle 
Substitution of three one-act plays,
| "The Maker of Dreams," "The Pot j
I Boiler," and the "Thrice-Promised
i Bride," for the regular Tuesday eve- j
ning lecture proved a very successful■
I innovation for the Stanford campus I
I as a full assembly of students and
campus theatregoers greeted the ef- j
forts of Mrs. Marion C. Wentworth's |
i English 198 class,
i !
j The nonchalant delivery and action |
; of the professional stage were neither
i expected nor fulfilled, but at the other j
! extreme, the halty action, the lax
wording, and the whole flavor usually<
i connected with performances of aj
purely amateur type, was notably ab-
I sent. Technical errors, mistakes in
| directing, costuming, and acting, were
present, but, especially with the justi-i
! fication of offering practical training |
| to students of a university English
I class, the English class's work may be!
j considered a distinct success.
Evincing the best work of the three
' productions was the "Pot Boiler," writ
j ten by Alice Gerstenberg, satirizing
the rehearsal of the olden drama.j
Clever acting, fundamental soundness
of the play, and able directing showed 1
1 its appreciation in the timely laughs
and hearty applause of the audience.
Credit for the success of the play
! must go in a large measure to Alfred j
i Bruce, who, in addition to directing
! the comedy, played the part of the j
| author-director, acting from all parts 1
! of the Assembly hall, and scoring dis
! tinct successes at times when the play ]
i relied purely on acting for its effect. !
I The part had originally been scheduled
for Gartha Winslow, who was forced
i to leave school last week because of
1 illness.
; Clarita Hunsberger, as the heroine,'
proved herself an actress of no little 1
ability, carrying her part with a swift
ness that kept the play from lagging. ;
Elizabeth Wilbur, playing Mrs. Pencil,
an adventuress, was afforded domina
tion over many scenes of the play,
with her stage presence successfully
carrying her through pitfalls which
could have easily halted the play's
continuity. Miss Wilbur showed the
best acting of the evening.

McDougal Is Villain

Kenneth McDougal was outstanding,
jas the perfect villain, while Robert
: Syer, the man who was born good
! looking, delivered his lines cleverly'
as the lover. George Bogue made his
! second appearance on the Stanford |
. stage in the past week, this time well
j cast in the part of the stern fatherj
j and hard-hearted capitalist. .
"Ttie Thrice-Promised Bride," the j
I last play of three, was much the best:
| production as a work of art and !
| beauty, holding the audience well j
| throughout the whole difficult per-!
I formance. In choosing an Oriental pro-,
! duction for a cast of English-speaking ;
students, Mrs. Wentworth showed con
fidence in the work of her pupils, con
fidence which was well-placed. Forget-!
ting the inevitable English accent and j
the unreal appearance of the cast as •
Oriental characters, "The Thrice-Prom-!
ised Bride" showed the best acting of i
the evening.
Chinese Play Good

Dorothy Quinn, playing Han Chu- j
Yin. the bride, gave a convincing por
trayal of the young Chinese, bartered
off for money. Julia North, in her dual
i role, was cast in a difficult part, but
I her ability mastered any threat of'
| over-playing.
j McKay, Thornton, and Bramkamp,:
j three suitors, were well-cast and ere- \
ated real characters sueing for the
hand of the Chinese. Wardle Poulson
the magistrate, did well in holding the!
play together and lending that atrnos- j
phere which kept the audience tense, j
Lloyd Nolan showed his versatility.;
, taking the part of an attendant fol- j
, lowing his performance last quarter j
ias the lead in the "Green Goddess."
! "The Maker of Dreams," a fantasy,
portrayed its idyllic atmosphere very i
well under the acting of Dorothy For-;
. j dyce, as Pierette, Sidney Gray as \
Pierrot, and William Hartsough as the;
Maker of Dreams. The love of Pier
rette and Pierrot was skilfully guided
through its pitfalls by the Dream
maker, who guides them in their true
I role of happiness.
Lloyd Nolan, stage manager, and i
• Harris Skelton and Edward Sibbett,
' j crew, performed their duties in a stan
ijdard well up to that of the entire,
program.
