Substitution of three one-act plays,
| "The Maker of Dreams," "The Pot j
I Boiler," and the "Thrice-Promised
i Bride," for the regular Tuesday eve- j
ning lecture proved a very successful■
I innovation for the Stanford campus I
I as a full assembly of students and
campus theatregoers greeted the ef- j
forts of Mrs. Marion C. Wentworth's |
i English 198 class,
i !
j The nonchalant delivery and action |
; of the professional stage were neither
i expected nor fulfilled, but at the other j
! extreme, the halty action, the lax
wording, and the whole flavor usually<
i connected with performances of aj
purely amateur type, was notably ab-
I sent. Technical errors, mistakes in
| directing, costuming, and acting, were
present, but, especially with the justi-i
! fication of offering practical training |
| to students of a university English
I class, the English class's work may be!
j considered a distinct success.
Evincing the best work of the three
' productions was the "Pot Boiler," writ
j ten by Alice Gerstenberg, satirizing
the rehearsal of the olden drama.j
Clever acting, fundamental soundness
of the play, and able directing showed 1
1 its appreciation in the timely laughs
and hearty applause of the audience.
Credit for the success of the play
! must go in a large measure to Alfred j
i Bruce, who, in addition to directing
! the comedy, played the part of the j
| author-director, acting from all parts 1
! of the Assembly hall, and scoring dis
! tinct successes at times when the play ]
i relied purely on acting for its effect. !
I The part had originally been scheduled
for Gartha Winslow, who was forced
i to leave school last week because of
1 illness.
; Clarita Hunsberger, as the heroine,'
proved herself an actress of no little 1
ability, carrying her part with a swift
ness that kept the play from lagging. ;
