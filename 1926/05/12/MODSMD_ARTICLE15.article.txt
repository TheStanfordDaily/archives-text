# Tyroler's Plans For Alumni Day Dance Completed
## 
### 
Plans for the annual University Day
dance which will be held in the
pavilion at 9:30 o'clock Saturday night
have been completed by Frederic N.
Tyroler.
Tickets for the dinner which will be
given in Encina that evening include
admittance to the dance as well as
to the program at the Memorial
Church following the dinner. Dinner
tickets which are selling at $1.50 a
plate may be obtained from John E.
McDowell, alumni secretary. For those
who do not attend the dinner the ad
mission price to the dance will be $1
a couple.
Since the entire evening of enter
tainment including the dinner and
dance may be obtained for $3 a couple,
the committee on University Day sug
gests that students as well as alumni
attend the dinner. The committee em
phasizes that this is a University Day
including all students as a part of its
festivities.
Employment of the Encina dining
halls instead of the pavilion where it
has been customary to hold the alumni
dinners eliminates clearing the tables
before the dance starts.
Seats in the Memorial Church for
the formal program of speakers and
music to be given following the din
ner, will be reserved for faculty, emeri
tus and active, trustees, alumni, and
students holding dinner tickets which
will include coupons of admittance to
the exercises.
Tickets for the undergraduates who
do not attend the dinner but wish to
hear the program in the Church, and
for members of the University staff,
may be obtained at the office of the
Committee on Public Exercises Friday.
The general public will be admitted
without tickets for such seats as are
left.
