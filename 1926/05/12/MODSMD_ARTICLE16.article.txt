# BRITISH STRIKE WILL HURT MINERS MOST, SAYS WELSH SCHOLAR
## 
### 
The general strike in England
has been called off following a
conference of labor leaders and
government heads, according to
Associated Press dispatches today.
The miners are still striking.

!
That the striking British miners will !
| have to bear the brunt of the burden |
j in any settlement that is devised is
the opinion of Stanley Herbert, lec
turer on international politics at the
j University of Wales, who is at present
on the campus studying the effects of
the American immigration policies in
the West.
"The whole mines system of Eng
; land will have to be reorganized on a
technical basis, that is, more coal will
: have to be used to furnish manufac
turing power, more coal must be con
sumed in making by-products, and the
j coal must be more efficiently and
j cheaply mined so that it can compete
|on the Continent. Until this is done,
I there can be little hope for permanent
j betterment of the miner's lot."
In regard to the immediate effect,
j Herbert said that the loss in internal
, l
| revenue would probably prove to be
; a serious matter to the government.
On the other hand, he said, the politi
' j cal reaction against labor will un
doubtedly strengthen the existing con
• servative government.
1 j "Things are not as some newspapers
• j would have us believe; there is 110
• attempt being made to overthrow the
■ i government in England. Should the
1 labor party triumph—and it is unlikely
I that it will —it would mean that an
■; election would be held and new men
! | would probably come into control."
J "When the strike started," said Her
-1! Bert, "the unemployment situation was
at the brightest point since 1021, and
the nation was beginning to enjoy a
general industrial and trade revival,
r The strike is unfortunate in that it
I I will seriously set back these improving
condtions. A further prolongation of
the tie-up will also greatly endanger
some of the British foreign market."
