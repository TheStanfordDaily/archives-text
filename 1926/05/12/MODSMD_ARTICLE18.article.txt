A.S.S.U. President, Vice-President,
and Secretary are to be elected in the
spring election, and also all class of
ficers. Other offices to be filled are:
three places on the Men's Council, to
be filled by upperclassmen; one junior
man member of the Executive Com
mittee, and one junior woman mem
ber; one sophomore man member of
the committee, and one woman; one
member of the Board of Athletic Con

Governors, to be seniors or holdovers.
Besides the election of officers, two
amendments will be voted on by the
Student Body. The first is to incorpor

into the A.S.S.U. constitution. As it
now stands it is merely in the by-laws,
and subject to the changing whims of
passing personnels of the Executive
Committee. The amendment would
make it an integral part of the consti
tution.
The second amendment is to change
the name of The Daily Palo Alto from
its present cognomen to that of the
Stanford Daily.
