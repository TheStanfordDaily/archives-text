# To the Aid of the Rally Committee
## 
### 
There are certainly few men in the University who will not attend the
Conference track meet in the stadium Saturday. That point being taken
for granted, we wish to impress upon the campus the fact that an organ
ized rooting section has been planned, and to successfully execute the idea,
tickets should be purchased immediately in order that the stunts may be ade
quately planned.
Stanford will be host to nine track teams, numerous visitors and offi
cials, and the executive representatives of each school to the Pacific Coast
Conference committee meeting. The University has for some time prided
itself upon its cheering sections. The California and New Year's games
give ample opportunity for us to display our self-admitted talents during
the football season, but with the advent of track this opportunity is usually
lost. With hundreds of visitors to the campus Saturday, however, we re
gain this chance to execute the sections so well planned during the fall.
Toward this end, the Rally Committee, in cooperation with the Board
of Control, has agreed to re-create the stunts used during the last few
football seasons. Realizing that there will be many men who will not wish
to purchase caps at so late a date, however, the committee is planning only
presentations requiring cards. The only burden upon the memory of the
students who enter the stadium Saturday, therefore, will be the small fact
that white shirts and rooter's tickets will be the requirements for admis
sion to the reserved section.
These particular tickets were placed on sale yesterday, but only a few
were called for. They will be procurable up to the day of the meet but
the work of the Rally Committee will be greatly accelerated and lightened
if a large advance sale occurs,
