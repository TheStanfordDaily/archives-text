# Two Delegates! Why ?
## 
### 
it would seem that some explanation is forthcoming from the Execu
tive Committee in defense of its decision last night to send two delegates
to the convention of student body presidents at the University of Wash
ington. It is true that in past years two men have been sent —the incom
ing president and the retiring president; but this year the convention is
being held before the results of the Spring election will be known. We
cannot see that anything will be gained by sending two officers, both of
whom cease to hold office at the end of this quarter.
If the A.S.S.U. has any extra money, it might well be turned over to
the Convalescent Home or some other charitable institution.
A NOTABLE INNOVATION in Tuesday evening presentations
was the substitution last night of three one-act plays for the usual lecture.
Their popularity was evidenced in the large audience which received them
very favorably. The director, Miss Marion Craig Wentworth, may well
be congratulated upon the success of her players; and the Committee on
Public Exercises is to be commended for such judicious variation.
AGAIN WE HEAR MURMURS of protests directed at the alleged
showers in the Encina Gymnasium. It seems that for a few days the
pipes were giving a normal supply of hot and cold water; but the improve
ment was only temporary.
Something should be done. That's our story, and we'll stick to it.
