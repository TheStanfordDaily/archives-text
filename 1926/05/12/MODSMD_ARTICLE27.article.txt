JOLLY-UPS
The jolly-up! (the Lord he praised)
'S a Stanford custom purely.
The women dance, enjoy themselves,
The men look on demurely.
Most usually these orgies last
From six-fifteen to eight;
Exact time doesn't matter
When you get there you won't rate.
You tag someone and start to dance,
Your line begins to tell,
When some big bozo comes along
And cuts you out —oh hell!
The scare of this here burst of rhyme
Is just full size—you hear?
The reason for this interlude
Will now be. made quite clear.
There goes a queen you want to know,
Have noticed her a year.
Right now's your chance—but when you tag, .
You get from here to here.
No time to shoot your standard line
About your bawl-out ranks,
Just time to say, "please pardon me
For cutting in" —and "thanks."
If when you quit this noble school
With only solace cups
Of gin—don't blame your schedule,
But those damphool jolly-ups. F.T.M.
* ♦ *
Now that the tumult and the shouting has died and rushing is over, the
Cads, the Lincolns, and the Packards, have largely returned home, and the
campus is settled back to the more usual routine of Fords.

THE REWARD OF TOIL
The big Cit ex was the next morning, and the boys were all primed to
spend the night in industrious study. Someone suggested the inevitable bull
session to clear up some of the rough spots in the course. They were to meet
in Susia McDonald's room on the 4th floor of Encina at 7:00 o'clock.
Promptly at 7 bells the boys showed up all ready for the night's work.
Then someone suggested a lil game of bridge before beginning work —to brush
the cobwebs away. Two hours later, "aw let's finish out this rubber, whaddye
say?" Time —Ten bells.
"Well, let's get goin, fellas." "Sure." "Say, waddye think of this girl
I had the other night pretty good, huh?" "Not half bad, considering
who took her," ets. "I know where you can get it for three dollars
a quart an I says to him, I says . Time—Twelve bells etc.,
etc. "And then I put my arm around her kiss? No
slapner Time —Two a.m.
"Well, fellas, no use studying any more, tonight, les turn in, waddye say?"
"Sure." "Well, goo night solong."
But there ain't no justice—none at all. None of them did better than 95.

JOLLY-UPS
The jolly-up! (the Lord he praised)
'S a Stanford custom purely.
The women dance, enjoy themselves,
The men look on demurely.
Most usually these orgies last
From six-fifteen to eight;
Exact time doesn't matter
When you get there you won't rate.
You tag someone and start to dance,
Your line begins to tell,
When some big bozo comes along
And cuts you out —oh hell!
The scare of this here burst of rhyme
Is just full size—you hear?
The reason for this interlude
Will now be. made quite clear.
There goes a queen you want to know,
Have noticed her a year.
Right now's your chance—but when you tag, .
You get from here to here.
No time to shoot your standard line
About your bawl-out ranks,
Just time to say, "please pardon me
For cutting in" —and "thanks."
If when you quit this noble school
With only solace cups
Of gin—don't blame your schedule,
But those damphool jolly-ups. F.T.M.

Now that the tumult and the shouting has died and rushing is over, the
Cads, the Lincolns, and the Packards, have largely returned home, and the
campus is settled back to the more usual routine of Fords.

THE REWARD OF TOIL
The big Cit ex was the next morning, and the boys were all primed to
spend the night in industrious study. Someone suggested the inevitable bull
session to clear up some of the rough spots in the course. They were to meet
in Susia McDonald's room on the 4th floor of Encina at 7:00 o'clock.
Promptly at 7 bells the boys showed up all ready for the night's work.
Then someone suggested a lil game of bridge before beginning work —to brush
the cobwebs away. Two hours later, "aw let's finish out this rubber, whaddye
say?" Time —Ten bells.
