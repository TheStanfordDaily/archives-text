"Topsy and Eva," at the Columbia
Theatre, San Francisco.
After an absence of over two years, j
the Duncan Sisters are back in San
Francisco with their own show, their
own lyrics, and their own inimitable;
fun-producing sketches. They are, of
course, nine-tenths of the show. One |
goes into the theatre and waits for
them to appear and as soon as they
leave the stage, waits for their nextj
appearance.
Rosetta Duncan, as Topsy, simply
carries her whole scenes, first gurgling
like a young pickaninny, and acting
the harum-searat "just growed" child
to perfection, then bringing the audi
ence into a nearly tearful pity for her
disbelief, only to jump back into the
buffoonery which brings the house
down all about her in chuckles, chor-!
ties, and roars of laughter. Vivian, her
sister, as Eva, furnishes the contrast
of being beautiful, and feeds her the!
lines through most of the show, being
quite held in the background by her
more versatile sister.

The choruses and songs as a whole
are not at all impressive, but the indi
vidual performances of Virgil Johnson,
as Uncle Tom, because of his singing,
and of Marguerite Ball, because of her!
dancing, deserve comment. Miss Ball
is far above the ordinary and was en-'
thusiastically received. The singing of j
the rest of the cast was quite common
place, as was their acting. However, j
there was none of it bad, and as a \
filler for the Duncan sisters, fits very '
j well.
The nine Pickaninny dancing girls,j
who were secured especially for the
show from the Palace Theatre, Lon
don, England, were excellent. Their
dances were executed without a slip.
