# ROOTERS' TICKETS ON SALE TOMORROW, FRIDAY COMMITTEE PLANS BIG STUNTS FOR P. C. C. MEET "GUY WITH RED SOCKS" WILL DIRECT ROOTERS
## 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the' Pacific
Coast Conference meet which will
be held in the stadium Saturday
are now on sale at $1.00 each. This
sale will continue tomorrow and
Friday, but after that time the
student prices will be boosted to
the regular admission charge of
$1.50.
It is absolutely necessary that the
rooters sale close Friday in order that
the Rally Committee be able to de
termine the exact size of the rooting
section and lay out the direction cards
accordingly. Nine hundred seats have
been set aside for the section and it is
the desire of the Rally Committee to
sell out this entire block.

It is planned to execute seven fea
ture stunts with the same style as the
stunts worked at the Big Game. Root
ers will not be required to wear
rooters' hats, but everyone in the sec
tion must wear a white shirt with or
without neckties.
Just previous to the high hurdle
event, the student aggregation will
form its colorful patterns under the
direction of rally committee members
headed by Delmer Daves.
The Board of Athletic Control has
agreed to supply the necessary ma
terial for the stunt series, and ar
rangements are being made by John
H. Roberts, Frank L. Hastings, and
John T. De Frees.
