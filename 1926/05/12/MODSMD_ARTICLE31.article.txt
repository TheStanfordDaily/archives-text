# GRASS FIRE ON HILL BRINGS DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
"
Certain fraternity men supposedly
endeavored to emulate the example
the freshman class set last week when
they fired two stacks of hay on San
Juan hill at about 10 o'clock last night, j
The fires were a success for all con- j
cerned excepting the members of the '
University fire department, who failed j
to see the humor involved in putting â– 
out grass fires in the evening after a j
hard day's work.
