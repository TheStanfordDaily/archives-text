The Red Light of Revolution
The Editor, Sir:
In last night's paper Professor Stu
art said that the strike for wages has
passed to a strike against the unwrit
ten Constitution of Great Britain. A
constitution is the organic law of the
state. Whenever the organic law of
the state does not provide for the
organic law of life, the red light of
revolution burns and flashes warning.
What is the organic law of life? It
is the persistent desire of a worker
to receive a living wage—to receive
the means of subsistence for one's wife
and three children. This composition
of a normal family has been fixed
both by Mr. Rowntree of England and
our Department of Labor. It needs
must be met for a wage to be a
living one.
Theoretically which law is higher:
the organic law of the state or the
organic law of life; the deep and cry
ing desire to have the means of sub
sistence? Then in the same breath ask
which law takes precedence practi
cally. The high talk of a constitution
shows little worth when a miner wants
a pair of shoes.
In Great Britain one law is pitted
against the other. The Red Light of
Revolution will never burn when the
organic law of the state takes account
of the organic law of life. Keep ahead
of public criticism. Hoover advises as
much when he says, "If business won't,
government will." Because he recog
nizes that if government won't, the
workers will. The law of life is in
exorable. —Lloyd L. Sullivan.
