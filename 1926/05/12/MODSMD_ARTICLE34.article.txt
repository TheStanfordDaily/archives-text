# SOPHOMORES, 1927 WIN FIRST ROUND OF CLASS WATER POLO
## 
### 
Sophomores and juniors won in the
first round of the intercluss water polo
championships held in Encina Pool
yesterday afternoon. The second-year
men scored a big upset when they
defeated the babe seven, 4 to 1. The
babes had their original team which
defeated the California frosli by a lop
sided score last quarter, and were
figured to beat the sophomores who
had not played together for some time.
The sophs, however, displayed a capa
ble defense and had the yearlings com
pletely outclassed throughout the con
test.
The juniors had a little more diffi
culty in disposing of their combined
senior and holdover opponents. They
accumulated a total of 3 goals to 0' for
the seniors.
Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock the
final games will be played in which
the sophomores and juniors fight it out
for first while the seniors and fresh
men try for third place. The teams
are more closely matched than were
the Berkeley and the Cardinal teams
when they met last quarter; and both
the sophomores and juniors are better
aggregations than the Blue and Gold
was able to produce.
Sophomores Have Edge
The sophomores seem to have a
slight edge, but the difference is so
slight that the game will be practi
cally a toss-up. The juniors will have
an advantage in Wardle Poulsen, the
varsity's capable goal guard who keeps
the opposing team from registering
the greater part of their shots. The
sophomore forward lineup played to
gether so much better than had been
expected today that they may be able
to overcome the handicap.
In the first game the sophomore
team composed of Bill Danford, sprint;
Herb Klein and Harry Maltby, for
wards; Kryne Van den Akker, center
back; Frank Treist and Bob Lilly,
backs; Dixon Smith, goal guard, met
the frosh whose lineup was: Bob
Burns, sprint; Cal Strong and Andy
Cole, forwards; Tom Thurlow, center
back; Fred Thon and Truman Parker,
guards; John Doyle, guard.
Of the four goals credited to the
sophomores, three were scored by
Herb Klein. The other was made by
Kryne Van den Akker. Klein regis
tered twice in the first half. Van den
Akker, who alternated with Bill Dan
ford in the sprint position, swam the
ball up close and scored in the early
part of the second period. The final
tally came when a corner throw for
the sophomores gave an opportunity
for a play from Maltby to Klein and
into the frame.
Juniors Play Well
The juniors lined up as follows:
Phil Brooks, sprint; Rod Ward and
Art Stewart, forwards; L. Christian
sen, center back; Carl Stevenson and
Len Schwartz, guards; Bill Hinckle
and Wardle Poulsen alternated as
guards. The senior team was made up
of A. Christiansen, sprint; Ted Smith
and Johnny Mack, forwards; Stan Bel
cher, center back; Ralph Draper and
Laurence Canfield, guards; van King,
goal guard.
The upperclassmen played evenly
for the first few minutes. Art Stewart
scored first for the juniors; Phil
Brooks made the next point. In the
last half Stewart scored again and the
game ended just as Carl Stevenson
was swimming the ball down for a
possible additional junior point.

varsity's capable goal guard who keeps
the opposing team from registering
the greater part of their shots. The
sophomore forward lineup played to
gether so much better than had been
expected today that they may be able
to overcome the handicap.
In the first game the sophomore
team composed of Bill Danford, sprint;
Herb Klein and Harry Maltby, for
wards; Kryne Van den Akker, center
back; Frank Treist and Bob Lilly,
backs; Dixon Smith, goal guard, met
the frosh whose lineup was: Bob
Burns, sprint; Cal Strong and Andy
Cole, forwards; Tom Thurlow, center
back; Fred Thon and Truman Parker,
guards; John Doyle, guard.
Of the four goals credited to the
sophomores, three were scored by
Herb Klein. The other was made by
Kryne Van den Akker. Klein regis
tered twice in the first half. Van den
Akker, who alternated with Bill Dan
ford in the sprint position, swam the
ball up close and scored in the early
part of the second period. The final
tally came when a corner throw for
the sophomores gave an opportunity
for a play from Maltby to Klein and
into the frame.
Juniors Play Well
The juniors lined up as follows:
Phil Brooks, sprint; Rod Ward and
Art Stewart, forwards; L. Christian
sen, center back; Carl Stevenson and
Len Schwartz, guards; Bill Hinckle
and Wardle Poulsen alternated as
guards. The senior team was made up
of A. Christiansen, sprint; Ted Smith
and Johnny Mack, forwards; Stan Bel
cher, center back; Ralph Draper and
Laurence Canfield, guards; van King,
goal guard.
The upperclassmen played evenly
for the first few minutes. Art Stewart
scored first for the juniors; Phil
Brooks made the next point. In the
last half Stewart scored again and the
game ended just as Carl Stevenson
was swimming the ball down for a
possible additional junior point.
Ernst Brandsten, coach of swimming
and water polo, refereed the games.
He predicts a close final contest.
Sophomores and juniors won in the
first round of the intercluss water polo
championships held in Encina Pool
yesterday afternoon. The second-year
men scored a big upset when they
defeated the babe seven, 4 to 1. The
babes had their original team which
defeated the California frosli by a lop
sided score last quarter, and were
figured to beat the sophomores who
had not played together for some time.
The sophs, however, displayed a capa
ble defense and had the yearlings com
pletely outclassed throughout the con
test.
The juniors had a little more diffi
culty in disposing of their combined
senior and holdover opponents. They
accumulated a total of 3 goals to 0' for
the seniors.
Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock the
final games will be played in which
the sophomores and juniors fight it out
for first while the seniors and fresh
men try for third place. The teams
are more closely matched than were
the Berkeley and the Cardinal teams
when they met last quarter; and both
the sophomores and juniors are better
aggregations than the Blue and Gold
was able to produce.
Sophomores Have Edge
The sophomores seem to have a
slight edge, but the difference is so
slight that the game will be practi
cally a toss-up. The juniors will have
an advantage in Wardle Poulsen, the
varsity's capable goal guard who keeps
the opposing team from registering
the greater part of their shots. The
