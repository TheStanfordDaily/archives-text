### 
"That the present award system be
incorporated into the constitutional
amendment to be voted upon at the
spring election on May 25," was the
decision of the Executive Committee
last night.
This action was made after deliber
ation on the number of changes that
have been made this year, in accord
ance with the requests of the various
athletic divisions. As nearly as the
committee has been able to ascertain,
all the changes which these sports
have deemed necessary have been
made.
In order to make it impossible for
the whims of passing committees to
change the awhrds plan at will, in
order to make it a system of rules
with the full sanction of the student
body behind it, it is necessary to in
corporate the plan into the constitu
tion itself. No change from the present
rules will be made putting it into the
permanent form.
Implication is made that the system
will become standardized and known
to all students when it is made a con
stitutional amendment, and has been
in operation for several years. The
uncertainty arising from having the
rules in the by-laws will be eliminated
because the Executive Committee will
not be able to make changes when
ever an exception comes to hand.
