# SMALLMAN CHOIR PRESENTS RECITALS IN GYPSY COSTUMES
## 
### 
Smallman's A Capella Choir will
give a recital in the Assembly hall
Monday evening. This organization
comes from Southern California where
it was organized and trained by John
Smallman, the present director, who
is an authority on choral singing in all
its branches. The A Capella Choir has
been pronounced one of the foremost
organizations of its kind in America.
It has the unique feature of giving all
of its recitals with its members in
Gypsy costumes, which are said to
enliven the usual sombre spirit of
the old religious music which is promi
nent in its repertoire.
A capella signifies unaccompanied
singing. Not only does the Smallman
choir render all its numbers without
any instrumental aid, but it vocalizes
entirely from memory and makes no
use of music in its concerts.
A capella singing has been called
the highest form of choral singing be
cause of the purity and excellence of
the tone that an experienced group of
this sort produces, and because of the
long tradition back of the art. In the
Middle Ages every medieval cathedral
had its A Capella (which means liter
ally "chapel style") choir, which
prided itself on absolutely accurate
pitch sense which enabled its mem
bers to sing in key the most difficult
chants, and wonderful breath control
for producing organ-like tones of amaz
ing duration.
Such singing requires a variety of
male an dfemale voices, all experi
enced and trained in the tradition as
well as the technique of unaccom
panied choral singing. This sort of a
Kroup Mr, Smallman has developed,
according to prominent critics, includ
ing Percy Grainger, Australian pianist,
who said that the work of the choir
was a revelatio nto him.
