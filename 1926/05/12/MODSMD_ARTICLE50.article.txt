# SPORTS OF 1926

Good old Eddie Collins. He is one of the "Four Immortals" now rounding
out their glorious careers in the American League.
The many youths who are dropped with loud hullabaloos from their college
football or baseball teams because it leaked out that they had played profes
sionally during the summer under assumed names, will feel less shame when
they scan the life story of Eddie Collins, for this man, one of the most honest
and respected in all baseball, once committed the very same "crime." Away
back in 1906, Eddie, then a student at Columbia University, played baseball
for ( onnie Mack under the alias of Sullivan. But thirteen years later, when
the big gamblers were bribing various members of the "Black Sox" to throw
the world series, they knew better than even to approach Eddie Collins, for if
they had done so, there would have been a few less gamblers.
Collins is now starting his third decade as a ballplayer. Yesterday he
celebrated his thirty-ninth birthday. The passing years have been easy on this
sloping-shouldered, nimble athlete, who was a star football-player in his
undergraduate days. In the twenty years that Collins has been with the
Athletics and the White Sox, he has built up the reputation of being one of
baseball's greatest second basemen, and also one of its leading base-stealers.
In 2557 games he batted .333 and stole 724 bases. , •
When Collins was appointed manager of the lowly White Sox in December,
1924, every single member of the team wrote to congratulate him and to ex
press their faith in him. And he kept the Sox in the race during 1925 until
toward the end of the season, when his own injuries kept him out of the game.
Chicago should finish even better than fifth this year—because of Manager
Edward Trowbridge Collins.
