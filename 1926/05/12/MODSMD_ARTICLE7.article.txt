Scoring 87 strokes in playing the
nine-hole links at the Emerald Lake
Country Club, R. A. Hefner and M. D.
Jergins, Delta Upsilon, took the lead
in the race for the intramural golf
championship, making the best score
of the ten teams in the first qualifying
round held yesterday afternoon. Six
teen remaining entries in the tourna
ment will play this afternoon, the eight
pairs with the lowest scores being
chosen from the entire entry list for
further competition.
Closely following the D.U. pair, and
also favored to qualify, was the
Breakers team, M. L. Carlsmith and
Rodney George, who negotiated the
course in 88 strokes. A1 Post and
Frank Howlett, Alpha Kappa Lambda,
were the third best team, making a
95. The other seven teams, all making
over 100, will probably not qualify for
further competition.

Lake Club, has announced the. pre
sentation of a perpetual trophy for the
participant making the longest drive
in three tries. Douglas Lewis, playing
for Beta Theta Pi, is at present lead
ing with a drive of 265 yards, closely
followed by Hefner and George in the
order named. Hefner also turned in a
42 for the course yesterday, the best
score made. â€¢
