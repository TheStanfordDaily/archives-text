# A.S.S.U. To Vote On New Name Of Daily Palo Alto
## 
### 
Last night at the regular weekly
meeting of the Executive Committee
a petition was passed to put before
the students an amendment to the
A.S.S.U. constitution changing the
name of The Daily Palo Alto to the
Stanford Daily.

After several weeks of deliberation
and the elimination of a number of
names, the one suggested seemed to be
the most appropriate. As a result the
motion to change the title was put to
the staff, which passed it unanimously.

Due to the fact that the name "The
Daily Palo Alto" is several times men
tioned in the constitution, and since it
is incorporated in the constitution as
such, an amendment is needed to make
the change. This petition from the
staff and several other members of the
student body will be incorporated on
the ballots of the spring election which
will be held Tuesday, May 25.
