# CAMPUS QUOTA FOR HOME NOT YET OVER TOP
## Convalescent Home Appeal Will Close Campaign Friday Evening STUDENTS DONATE $904 Winterbotham States Fund Being Well Supported By Campus Groups 
### 
Contrary to the statement made last
night at the Convalescent Home re
garding the success of the Convale
scent Home Appeal, the drive has not
yet gone over the top, according to a
statement issued by Linn Winter
botham, chairman of the drive com
mittee. He stated that the contribu
tions registered to date total $904.
The campaign will be continued un
til Friday evening when it will offi
cially end. Speeches will be made and
•collections taken in living groups
which have not reported yet tomorrow
during the noon and evening meals.
Winterbotham said it would be neces
sary for the committees in each living
group to turn in their reports by Fri
day noon.
Roble Hall leads the list of donors
with $170; while Toyon Club, repre
senting the eating clubs, has turned
in $120. These two living groups, com
bined with Encina Hall, Sequoia Hall,
and Branner Hall, totaled $403.
All sororities have turned in contri
butions, but several stated they would
turn in more later. The ten sororities
contributed a sum of $165 to date. Only
ten of the twenty-four fraternities
have been heard from, with a resulting
total of $135. These figures as an
nounced by the committee chairman
include all donations up to Wednesday
noon.
The committee particularly desires
that each member of the student body
turn in a dollar to the fund, as this
small contribution would easily swell
the drive above its quota. Several
plans have been used in the various
organizations but the most successful
•way was an assessment of $1 from
«ach member. One of the main rea
sons the drive is particularly urgent
is the fact that the San Francisco
Community Chest has cut the Home's
budget $3000 for the coming year.
According to Linn Winterbotham,
the work of the committee composed
of Lorraine Cleaveland, Helen Huneke,
Leslie Gordon, Louis Lundborg, Ken
neth McDougall, William Fain, and
Powell Carpenter, has been particular
ly effective this year. All those who
have not been reached by organiza
tions are requested to send their dona
tions by a check made out to the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
Funds for maintenance of the Home
come from three main sources: the
San Francisco Community Chest,
$15,024; donations from individual or
ganizations, $3700; and interest on
general endowment funds, $5400. With
the Community Chest donation cut to
$15,000 additional contributions are
greatly needed.
