# Card Polo Four Plays O.A.C. Men In Final Contest
## 
### 
Stanford University's crack polo
four will meet the Oregon Agricultural
College in the final contests of the
polo season tomorrow and Saturday
at Corvallis, Oregon. There is a possi
bility of a game with the 30th Infantry,
but no arrangements have yet been
concluded.
Earlier in the year, the Aggie team
journeyed to Stanford for two games,
both of which they won by large
scores. Stanford's chances in these
games were lessened by the use of a
second team throughout the contests.
In mid-winter, the O.A.C. poloists went
to Tucson, where they were beaten
two out of three games with Arizona.
The northern team has forged to the
front in Northwestern polo, having
won the Northwest indoor polo cham
pionship last year, and the Oregon
State polo title for the past two years.
The squad is composed entirely of
veterans, all the men having played
at least a year.
Frank Huffman plays at No. 1. His
scoring ability ranks high and his
occupancy of the starting place on
the team insures some fast competi
tion for Kenneth Krohn of the Stan
ford team.
At the No. 2 position is John Kenny.
He is an aggressive and heady player,
and can be counted on especially
where hard riding and strategic shoot
ing is demanded. He will be faced by
Lysle Vanderburgh, who will captain
the Stanford team during the trip.
Critics say that Vanderburgh's playing
in the Arizona series ranked on a par
with that of Jimmie Hearon, the great
est collegian.
Captain Fred Trotter will not ac
company the team north, as it is
thought best to keep him out on aq
count of his arm. His place will be
filled by Brown, who played No. 4
during the first Arizona game.
Fred Baclier rides at No. 3 for the
Northerners. He is an accurate shot
and a tireless rider, and has been on
the team for three years. His experi
ence is a big factor in his favor.
Harvey Dick at No. 4 is the bulwark
of the defense. Dick played with the
Portland Hunt Club before going to
0.A.C., which gives him a background
of experience better than the other
members of his squad. Leo Beckley
and King Sweet are the Aggie substi
tutes. Both of them are veterans of
last year's team, and both play any
position. The Oregon team is coached
by Lieutenant H. M. Woodward, Jun
ior Cavalry.
The other members of the Stanford
team making the trip are Thompson,
Weymouth, and Rotlirock.

scoring ability ranks high and his
occupancy of the starting place on
the team insures some fast competi
tion for Kenneth Krohn of the Stan
ford team.
At the No. 2 position is John Kenny.
He is an aggressive and heady player,
and can be counted on especially
where hard riding and strategic shoot
ing is demanded. He will be faced by
Lysle Vanderburgh, who will captain
the Stanford team during the trip.
Critics say that Vanderburgh's playing
in the Arizona series ranked on a par
with that of Jimmie Hearon, the great
est collegian.
Captain Fred Trotter will not ac
company the team north, as it is
thought best to keep him out on aq
count of his arm. His place will be
filled by Brown, who played No. 4
during the first Arizona game.
Fred Baclier rides at No. 3 for the
Northerners. He is an accurate shot
and a tireless rider, and has been on
the team for three years. His experi
ence is a big factor in his favor.
Harvey Dick at No. 4 is the bulwark
of the defense. Dick played with the
Portland Hunt Club before going to
0.A.C., which gives him a background
of experience better than the other
members of his squad. Leo Beckley
and King Sweet are the Aggie substi
tutes. Both of them are veterans of
last year's team, and both play any
position. The Oregon team is coached
by Lieutenant H. M. Woodward, Jun
ior Cavalry.
The other members of the Stanford
team making the trip are Thompson,
Weymouth, and Rotlirock.
Stanford University's crack polo
four will meet the Oregon Agricultural
College in the final contests of the
polo season tomorrow and Saturday
at Corvallis, Oregon. There is a possi
bility of a game with the 30th Infantry,
but no arrangements have yet been
concluded.
Earlier in the year, the Aggie team
journeyed to Stanford for two games,
both of which they won by large
scores. Stanford's chances in these
games were lessened by the use of a
second team throughout the contests.
In mid-winter, the O.A.C. poloists went
to Tucson, where they were beaten
two out of three games with Arizona.
The northern team has forged to the
front in Northwestern polo, having
won the Northwest indoor polo cham
pionship last year, and the Oregon
State polo title for the past two years.
The squad is composed entirely of
veterans, all the men having played
at least a year.
Frank Huffman plays at No. 1. His
scoring ability ranks high and his
occupancy of the starting place on
the team insures some fast competi
tion for Kenneth Krohn of the Stan
ford team.
