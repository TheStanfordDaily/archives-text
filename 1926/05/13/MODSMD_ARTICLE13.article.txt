# REPRESENTATIVES FROM CONFERENCE MEET ON CAMPUS
## WILL DISCUSS FINANCES Subsidizing Athletes Looms As Important Subject For Consideration 
### 
Faculty representatives of the Pa
cific Coast Conference will hold their
semi-annual meeting at Stanford to
morrow and Saturday. Delegates from
the nine member-schools of the Con
ference will gather in the clubroom
of Toyon hall for discussions of policy
and rules.
Graduate managers of the schools
represented will also be in attendance
at a separate meeting today for con
sideration of financial problems aris
ing in the Conference. A determination
of the trial heats be run tomorrow will
also be made.
The faculty representatives who ar
rive today and tomorrow for the meet
ing are: Professor H. C. Howe, Ore
gon University; Dean H. V. Carpenter,
Washington State College, the presi
dent of the Conference; Professor W.
B. Owens, Stanford; Professor Charles
C. May, Washington; Dean J. H.
Hildebrand, University of California;
M. F- Angell, Idaho, secretary-treas
urer; Professor O. J. Marston, U.S.C.;
Professor A. B. Cordley, 0.A.C.; and
Professor J. P. Rowe, Montana.
The subsidization of athletes will be
one of the main topics under consider
ation. Discussion will undoubtedly cen
ter upon a plan presented by the Uni
versity of California last December
through its representative, Dean Joel
H. Hildebrand, and recently modified
by him. Dean Hildebrand has sub
mitted a brief in support of his pro
posal and a reply brief has been pre
pared by Professor Owens of Stanford
which points out that, while some
limitation is necessary, the proposed
plan does not, in his opinion, provide
a sufficiently definite standard for
judging the propriety of financial aid.
The proposal of California is as fol-1
lows:
"No student shall represent his in- j
stitution in any contest:
"Who, subsequent to the adoption
of this section shall receive, within
one year prior to matriculation, money j
by gift or loan, or by payment for
services in an amount in excess of the J
reasonable value of such service, or
to the equivalent of money, such as
board, scholarship, etc., unless the
source and character of these gifts or
payments to him shall indicate that j
they have not accrued to him because
of his athletic ability.
"The faculty athletic representative j
shall require a verified statement from j
each candidate for competition in any
sport a detailed statement of the j
sources of his financial support, in
cluding any sums earned during vaca
tion, in such form and detail as shall
permit the determination of his eligi- j
bility under this section. Blank forms i
of such statements shall be prepared
by the secretary of this conference
and distributed by him to members.
"The faculty athletic representative
shall certify the eligibility of each ath
lete under this rule, and shall transmit,
with the eligibility lists a statement
of the character and value of all schol
arships held by athletes named there
on, and also, upon request of any mem
ber of the Conference, a copy of the
verified statement of courses of finan
cial support of any specified athlete
or athletes."
Other questions for consideration by
the Conference will be: the possibility
of a commissioner for the selection of
officials; a defined policy on the New
Year's game relative to selection of
opponents, and other phases; and a
thorough revision and clarifying of
Conference rules.

to the equivalent of money, such as
board, scholarship, etc., unless the
source and character of these gifts or
payments to him shall indicate that j
they have not accrued to him because
of his athletic ability.
"The faculty athletic representative j
shall require a verified statement from j
each candidate for competition in any
sport a detailed statement of the j
sources of his financial support, in
cluding any sums earned during vaca
tion, in such form and detail as shall
permit the determination of his eligi- j
bility under this section. Blank forms i
of such statements shall be prepared
by the secretary of this conference
and distributed by him to members.
"The faculty athletic representative
shall certify the eligibility of each ath
lete under this rule, and shall transmit,
with the eligibility lists a statement
of the character and value of all schol
arships held by athletes named there
on, and also, upon request of any mem
ber of the Conference, a copy of the
verified statement of courses of finan
cial support of any specified athlete
or athletes."
Other questions for consideration by
the Conference will be: the possibility
of a commissioner for the selection of
officials; a defined policy on the New
Year's game relative to selection of
opponents, and other phases; and a
thorough revision and clarifying of
Conference rules.
Faculty representatives of the Pa
cific Coast Conference will hold their
semi-annual meeting at Stanford to
morrow and Saturday. Delegates from
the nine member-schools of the Con
ference will gather in the clubroom
of Toyon hall for discussions of policy
and rules.
Graduate managers of the schools
represented will also be in attendance
at a separate meeting today for con
sideration of financial problems aris
ing in the Conference. A determination
of the trial heats be run tomorrow will
also be made.
The faculty representatives who ar
rive today and tomorrow for the meet
ing are: Professor H. C. Howe, Ore
gon University; Dean H. V. Carpenter,
Washington State College, the presi
dent of the Conference; Professor W.
B. Owens, Stanford; Professor Charles
C. May, Washington; Dean J. H.
Hildebrand, University of California;
M. F- Angell, Idaho, secretary-treas
urer; Professor O. J. Marston, U.S.C.;
Professor A. B. Cordley, 0.A.C.; and
Professor J. P. Rowe, Montana.
The subsidization of athletes will be
one of the main topics under consider
ation. Discussion will undoubtedly cen
ter upon a plan presented by the Uni
versity of California last December
through its representative, Dean Joel
H. Hildebrand, and recently modified
by him. Dean Hildebrand has sub
mitted a brief in support of his pro
posal and a reply brief has been pre
pared by Professor Owens of Stanford
which points out that, while some
limitation is necessary, the proposed
plan does not, in his opinion, provide
a sufficiently definite standard for
judging the propriety of financial aid.
The proposal of California is as fol-1
lows:
"No student shall represent his in- j
stitution in any contest:
"Who, subsequent to the adoption
of this section shall receive, within
one year prior to matriculation, money j
by gift or loan, or by payment for
services in an amount in excess of the J
reasonable value of such service, or
to the equivalent of money, such as
board, scholarship, etc., unless the
source and character of these gifts or
payments to him shall indicate that j
they have not accrued to him because
of his athletic ability.
