# POLAR FLIGHTS AID AVIATION PROGRESS SAYS W. F. DURAND
## Favorable Arctic Weather Conditions Held Cause Of Two Successes 
### 
That the polar flights of Byrd and
Amundsen are significant evidences of
the progress of aviation, and that they
will result in a stimulating of public
interest in flying, is the opinion of
William F. Durand, professor emeritus
of mechanical engineering, member of
the President's Aircraft Board, and na
tionally-known authority on aeronau
tics.
"It must be remembered, however,"
said Professor Durand, "that the
flights, while remarkable achieve
ments, owe their success in a large
degree to the accidents of weather.
Had the temperature, or any number
of other conditions been less favorable,
they could not have done it.
"It is very rare that suitable flying
conditions can be found in the Arctic,"
Professor Durand further stated, "and
it is for that reason little likelihood
exists for that area ever being used
as an aerial route between the conti
nents.
"The experiments so far this season
have brought out that airships and
airplanes are equally effective for dif
ficult work. Both types have been sub
jected to more severe tests; but an
Arctic flight appeals more to public
interest, and hence these flights can
be expected to have a general effect
on aviation. The trip of the Norge will
be especially valuable in re-establish
ing public confidence in lighter-than
air craft."
In mentioning Commander Byrd,
Professor Durand said that he had dis
cussed the plans for the flight with
him last fall and had found them very
capably worked out. Byrd, he consid
ered to be a man of high ability. Pro
fessor Durand also went over the plans
for the polar flight of the ill-fated
Shenandoah, which was to be held last
summer. He express*! the opinion that
had the flight been held it would very
likely have been a success.
"The flight of Commander Byrd adds
another record to a long series of
American conquests in the air. It will
help prove that this country is not so
backward in aviation as some people
would have us believe."
