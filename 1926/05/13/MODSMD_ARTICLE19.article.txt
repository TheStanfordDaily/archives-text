# PACIFIC COAST TEAMS ARRIVE FOR WORKOUTS
## Dope Indicates Cards, U.S.C. Aggregations Have Equal Chance NORTHERN SQUADS WEAK Templeton Picks Thirteen To Compete Saturday In P.C.C. Meet

Trials for the Conference Meet
will be held in the stadium at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon. A
general admission ticket for the
Saturday meet must be presented
for admission to these elimina
tions. The events in which trials
will be held will be decided this
afternoon at a managers' meeting.
Trials will probably be held In
the sprints, 440, hurdles, and some
field events.

With track athletes from the Uni
versity of Washington practicing daily
in the Stanford stadium, and teams
from Oregon, Montana, California, and
U.S.C. expected to arrive today or to
morrow, the annual Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field meet looms as
the greatest event in Coast track his
tory. This year's conference meet
brings together a number of the most
outstanding athletes in the United
States, and Saturday's competition
will probably assume national impor
tance.
When it is taken into consideration
that the titular meet will be a com
bination of the Stanford-California,
Stanford-U.S.C., and California-U.S.C.
encounters, together with the cream of
northern athletes entered, it can eas
ily be seen that Saturday's program
holds promise of being the greatest
meet of a season already repleie with
great events.
Dean Cromwell's athletes are con
ceded the best chance to cop the team
honors because of sensational vic
tories scored over both Stanford and
California. It is hardly safe to predict
that the Trojan stars will take the
championship, however, because Stan
ford and California have both shown
point-scoring power equal to the
strength possessed by the Southerners.
None of the best three northern
teams, Washington, Montana, or Ore
gon, can be placed on a par with the
strong California squads, because the
records turned in by the North
erners this year compare favorably
with the showing of the Californians
in only a few instances.
Coach Dink Templeton has selected
thirteen of the fourteen men allowed
to compete, and intends to pick the
remaining athlete today. Captain Bill
Richardson is the only man entered in
the half-mile, but the Cardinal mentor
will run his famous 440 trio, Miller,
Storie, and Babcock, in the one-lap
event. Stanford will not be represented
in the sprints or the mile.
Bob King and Tom Work will com
pete in the high jump, and Sid Meeks
and Dick Macßae are entered in the
broad jump. Three Cardinal athletes,
Harlow, Joaquin, and Shipkey, are in
the javelin-throwing event, and Biff
Hoffman will be Stanford's only repre
sentative in the weight events. Clar
ence West is the only Cardinal hurdler
entered.
The fourteenth man will be selected
from final tryouts this afternoon, in
which Chet Ross, pole-vaulter, and Ted
Criley, two-miler, are the chief con
tenders. Ross made an unexpected
good showing in the Big Meet, clearing
the bar at 12 feet 7 inches, and last
Saturday in the P.A.A. meet, kept up
his good work by leaping 12 feet 8
inches for the first place. Criley placed
second in the two-mile in the Stanford-
California meet in one of the gamest
struggles on the program.
Nine hundred thousand dollars has
been raised for Missouri University
memorials.

remaining athlete today. Captain Bill
Richardson is the only man entered in
the half-mile, but the Cardinal mentor
will run his famous 440 trio, Miller,
Storie, and Babcock, in the one-lap
event. Stanford will not be represented
in the sprints or the mile.
Bob King and Tom Work will com
pete in the high jump, and Sid Meeks
and Dick Macßae are entered in the
broad jump. Three Cardinal athletes,
Harlow, Joaquin, and Shipkey, are in
the javelin-throwing event, and Biff
Hoffman will be Stanford's only repre
sentative in the weight events. Clar
ence West is the only Cardinal hurdler
entered.
The fourteenth man will be selected
from final tryouts this afternoon, in
which Chet Ross, pole-vaulter, and Ted
Criley, two-miler, are the chief con
tenders. Ross made an unexpected
good showing in the Big Meet, clearing
the bar at 12 feet 7 inches, and last
Saturday in the P.A.A. meet, kept up
his good work by leaping 12 feet 8
inches for the first place. Criley placed
second in the two-mile in the Stanford-
California meet in one of the gamest
struggles on the program.
Nine hundred thousand dollars has
been raised for Missouri University
memorials.
Trials for the Conference Meet
will be held in the stadium at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon. A
general admission ticket for the
Saturday meet must be presented
for admission to these elimina
tions. The events in which trials
will be held will be decided this
afternoon at a managers' meeting.
Trials will probably be held In
the sprints, 440, hurdles, and some
field events.

With track athletes from the Uni
versity of Washington practicing daily
in the Stanford stadium, and teams
from Oregon, Montana, California, and
U.S.C. expected to arrive today or to
morrow, the annual Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field meet looms as
the greatest event in Coast track his
tory. This year's conference meet
brings together a number of the most
outstanding athletes in the United
States, and Saturday's competition
will probably assume national impor
tance.
When it is taken into consideration
that the titular meet will be a com
bination of the Stanford-California,
Stanford-U.S.C., and California-U.S.C.
encounters, together with the cream of
northern athletes entered, it can eas
ily be seen that Saturday's program
holds promise of being the greatest
meet of a season already repleie with
great events.
Dean Cromwell's athletes are con
ceded the best chance to cop the team
honors because of sensational vic
tories scored over both Stanford and
California. It is hardly safe to predict
that the Trojan stars will take the
championship, however, because Stan
ford and California have both shown
point-scoring power equal to the
strength possessed by the Southerners.
None of the best three northern
teams, Washington, Montana, or Ore
gon, can be placed on a par with the
strong California squads, because the
records turned in by the North
erners this year compare favorably
with the showing of the Californians
in only a few instances.
Coach Dink Templeton has selected
thirteen of the fourteen men allowed
to compete, and intends to pick the
remaining athlete today. Captain Bill
