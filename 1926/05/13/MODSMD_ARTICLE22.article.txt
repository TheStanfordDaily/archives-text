# The 						Convalescent Home
## 
### 
The drive for the Convalescent Home funds will be continued until
the quota of $1,000 is reached, according to the committee in charge. It
was originally planned to have the drive end yesterday; hut at this time
only $904 had been received, and several living groups had not reported.
The Daily has previously commented on the drive; and praised the
idea of having only one solicitation a quarter. Those who labored at the
Home yesterday obtained first hand information on the work that is being
accomplished by the institution. The quota should be oversubscribed by
tonight; and all reluctant living groups will probably be heard from.
While commenting on the Home, it is well to give credit to the com
mittee and individual's who arranged the annual Labor Day. It is pretty
generally agreed that considerable was accomplished; and the officials of
the institution are well pleased. Harvey Lytel, the general chairman, and
his corps of efficient assistants planned so well that no time was lost, and
there was plenty of work for all. But the feed and entertainment did
much to soothe the tired, blistered laborers. For the food we thank
Donald Adams and the world's champion outdoor chef, Sam Mac Donald;
and for the entertainment, the credit should be bestowed on Lloyd Nolan.
Signs of insanity at the University of Pittsburg:
"Students in a Latin class under Professor Stinchcomb refused to leave their
r#om until a substitute teachcr was provided to conduct the class in the absence of
their regular instructor, who was sick."
Another high school student goes wrong. Remarks made by a one
Edward Reid when safely home from a prep school convention held at
0.A.C.:
"Collegians wear garters, they go to church, and they smoke."
