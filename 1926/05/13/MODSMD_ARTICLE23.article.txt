The Editor, Sir:
I saw by your editorial last night
that you questioned the action of the
Executive Committee in sending the
vice-president to the president's con
vention at Seattle. I am not in the
least surprised that you asked for an
explanation.
The only explanation I can give is
that it was purely an arbitrary and
well-planned move on the part of two
members of the committee. There
were only six members present at the
meeting, the president having no vote
unless there is a tie. Of the five mem
bers eligible to vote, two voted for
sending the vice-president North, one
voted no, and two did not vote. Of
these last two, one was the vice-presi- j
dent who stated he would vote for it
if there was a tie.
As you stated in your editorial there I
is 110 reason why the Associated Stu
dents should pay for sending someone |
on a trip, merely because they can
afford to. There are too many which
warrant the Associated Students giv
ing their money and support to with
out sending the vice-president sight
seeing over the country. The constitu
tion provides that the president and
the president-elect shall attend the
convention. It says nothing about the
vice-president.
In closing, I wish to state that I DID
NOT recommend the action of the
committee. It was purely a matter of •
graft.
Very truly yours,
