# SNAKES REFUSED BY ZOOLOGY DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
No more snakes or lizards will be
received by the Zoology department,
was the edict issued last night Pro
fessor John O. Snyder, professor of
Zoology.
After being presented with a gopher
snake by Sergeant R. E. Lawrence, of
the Palo Alto police force, Tuesday
afternoon, Professor Snyder has de
cided not to accept any more reptiles.
"Every year about this time, people
begin to catch snakes and bring them
in to the department," said Professor
Snyder last night. "We have no use
for them, but keep them on exhibit
until the end of the spring quarter
and then liberate them in a hayfield
some miles out of town.
"We do not kill them or use them
for experiments as they are very valu
able in killing rats and other rodents
around the country."
Students are hereby warned that it
will be a waste of time and energy to
trap roving serpents in order to pre
sent them to the University.
