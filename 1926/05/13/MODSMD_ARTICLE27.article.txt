# STANFORD CAMPUS OF EARLY YEARS LACKED TREES, LIVING GROUPS
## Railroad Station, Oak Trees Composed Town of Palo Alto in 1891 
### Hallie Keating 
The Stanford campus, without trees,
i and the present body of living groups,
i is hard to imagine, but in the early
' years of the University the campus
was almost destitute of trees.
In the summer of 1891 Escondite
cottage, near Encina, was the only
house on the campus available for the
faculty. This was the former home of
Peter Coutts. It was occupied by Dr.
and Mrs. Jordan. Here on the porch
the # first entrance examination was
held. Three students applied; one girl
passed, but the two young men failed.
Since none of the offices were finished
the library here was used to serve as
a mail office.
There was no town of Palo Alto.
The railroad station, and some of the
oak trees were signified by this name,
but only two trains were scheduled to
stop here a day, and sometimes they
did not slow down for the station.
At first, the only houses available
for the rest of the faculty were in
Mayfield and Menlo Park, but a num
ber of small frame houses were at last
built on Alvarado. These were the
nucleus of the present Row.
Encina and Roble were completed
shortly before the opening of the Uni
versity. At first, candles were the only
light, but eventually electric lights and
hot water arrived on the scene. The
dining room at Roble was not finished'
until later in the year, so the seventy
two girls that composed the Associ
ated Women Students took their meals
at Encina.
Some of the students liVed at "The
Camp," and almost all of them ate
there. Encina food had already ac
quired a reputation. This Camp was a
group of one-story white buildings be
hind the Quad near the present Lasuen
street, tt was originally built for the
accommodation of men working on the
buildings. A sign at the entrance of
the camp read: "Grub is ready at the
i camp." This was at first the only pluce
I where visitors to the campus could

obtain meals.
The story is told of one man who
lived in one of the camp buildings,
"which stood a little way off the
ground and was open underneath. He |
is said to have set snares through a
trapdoor in his floor for unwary
chickens that came for pickings about
the camp. He often got the cook to j

prepare those same chickens for his i
dinner."
But with the organization of frater
nities at the end of the first year, and
the erection of more homes on Alva
rado, the living problem begun to!
smooth itself out, and resolved from
the treeless plain into tlia present .
j grouping of houses.
