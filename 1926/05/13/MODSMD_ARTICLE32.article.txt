## 
### 
Discovery by a student in Princeton !
University of the oldest skeleton of a i
fossil cat yet known to man is creat
j ing a stir in the scientific world. The
1 three-million-year-old fossil was found
by C. L. Jepsen, '27, two years ago
| when he was a student in the South
} Dakota School of Mines. Definite proof
has now been established that the
I skeleton is that of an unusually large
I sabre-tooth tiger.
This tiger was one of the remote an
cestors of modern cats and was about
the size of a small lion. It possessed
the ability of opening its mouth to the

astonishing angle of 165 to 170 de
grees. Jepson believes that the great
cat was drowned in its den as a result
of a flood in a nearby river. He has
named the tiger hedelpheneus oharrai,
honoring Dr. C. C. O'Harra, prominent
South Dakota scientist.
The student body of thp Florida
State College for Women has adopted
and sent to the governor of the state
a protest against lynching.
"Hello Day" was observed by the
sophomore class at the University of
Washington recently. A sophomore
lunch and mixer was held at noon fol
lowed by an all-university dance.
