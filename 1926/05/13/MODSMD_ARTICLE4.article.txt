# FIESTA DRESS REHEARSAL PLEASES SELECT AUDIENCE
## 
### Frank Baker 
The favored few who attended the
dress rehearsal of the "Romance of
Resanoff, the Russian, and Conchita,"
the 1926 Fiesta Lagunita, last night,
were surprised, agreeably surprised.
The pageant, which is scheduled for
8:15 o'clock tomorrow night on the
shores of Lagunita, exhibited the re
sults of the intensive rehearsing that
it has been undergoing ever since the
opening of this quarter.
The reason for the surprise of the
spectators is that pre-Fiesta gossip
has always been extremely unsatis
factory. If the past Fiestas have been
as good as the rehearsal promises for
this one, the gossip was certainly un
founded. The dances, the pantomine,
the sets, the costumes, and the light
ing approach as near to the profes
sional as the reviewer has seen on a
college campus.
Arthur Cyril, who is directing the
Fiesta, is from the Forest Theatre in
Carmel. He was dramatic coach at

Stanford at the time Gordon Davis
was a student here, and has been on
the professional stage with him. He
has had considerable experience with
this type of production, and is par
ticularly competent with the larger
groupings.
A change in the part of Conchita
was recently made. Kathleen Fitz has
been given the role, and though she
has had but a short time with the cast,
she showed an aptitude at pantomine
that will give the part a distinct per
sonality. Another change was that of
Wona, the Indian Slave, from Mar
jorie Robinson to Nelty Lefranc.
Chesterlyn Thomas, as Rosanoff, is
admirably suited to her part. Her dig
nity of bearing and an abundance of
long hair help to make her a striking
Russian soldier. Margaret Olsen, as
Old Conchita, Margarita Espinosa, as
Maria, Elizabeth Doyle, as the Rus
sian Slave, and Astrid Arnoldson,
as the Russian Lieutenant, are all cast
