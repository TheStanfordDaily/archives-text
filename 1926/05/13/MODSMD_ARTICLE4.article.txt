# FIESTA DRESS REHEARSAL PLEASES SELECT AUDIENCE
## 
### Frank Baker 
The favored few who attended the
dress rehearsal of the "Romance of
Resanoff, the Russian, and Conchita,"
the 1926 Fiesta Lagunita, last night,
were surprised, agreeably surprised.
The pageant, which is scheduled for
8:15 o'clock tomorrow night on the
shores of Lagunita, exhibited the re
sults of the intensive rehearsing that
it has been undergoing ever since the
opening of this quarter.
The reason for the surprise of the
spectators is that pre-Fiesta gossip
has always been extremely unsatis
factory. If the past Fiestas have been
as good as the rehearsal promises for
this one, the gossip was certainly un
founded. The dances, the pantomine,
the sets, the costumes, and the light
ing approach as near to the profes
sional as the reviewer has seen on a
college campus.
Arthur Cyril, who is directing the
Fiesta, is from the Forest Theatre in
Carmel. He was dramatic coach at

Stanford at the time Gordon Davis
was a student here, and has been on
the professional stage with him. He
has had considerable experience with
this type of production, and is par
ticularly competent with the larger
groupings.
A change in the part of Conchita
was recently made. Kathleen Fitz has
been given the role, and though she
has had but a short time with the cast,
she showed an aptitude at pantomine
that will give the part a distinct per
sonality. Another change was that of
Wona, the Indian Slave, from Mar
jorie Robinson to Nelty Lefranc.
Chesterlyn Thomas, as Rosanoff, is
admirably suited to her part. Her dig
nity of bearing and an abundance of
long hair help to make her a striking
Russian soldier. Margaret Olsen, as
Old Conchita, Margarita Espinosa, as
Maria, Elizabeth Doyle, as the Rus
sian Slave, and Astrid Arnoldson,
as the Russian Lieutenant, are all cast
in parts to which they are well fitted.
Particular notice should be taken
-of the Death dance, executed by Laura
j Peocock. This is an interpretive dance
of a. character that is entirely new
to the campus, and with Miss Peo
cock's admirable performance, is cer
tain to be one of the high points of
! the pageant.
But among the most important
| things of the Fiesta this year, and the
things that will set it off from other
productions, are the settings, the light
ing effects, and the costume work. In
building an outdoor amphitheatre in
the beautiful setting of Lagunita, the
first step was taken toward a success
ful show. A special stage was built
up of turf, and rows of natural seats

|
j graded cm the side of the hill over- /
looking it. Leslie Kiler has arranged
j a few sets almost severely simple that
set oft' the natural surrounding in a
very effective manner.
Harold Todd, who has handled the
Assembly hall lighting for the past two
years, has secured lighting equipment j
from the Family Club, and put it up
so as to make a play upon the stage j
that is entirely new to the campus, and
far superior to former efforts. The l
costumes have been arranged by Pa
-1 trice Naumau, who has worked for
I some time with Chrysella Dunker
Kiler. Too favorable comment cannot
j be made on the blending of color and
' appropriateness shown in the costum
ing.

she showed an aptitude at pantomine
that will give the part a distinct per
sonality. Another change was that of
Wona, the Indian Slave, from Mar
jorie Robinson to Nelty Lefranc.
Chesterlyn Thomas, as Rosanoff, is
admirably suited to her part. Her dig
nity of bearing and an abundance of
long hair help to make her a striking
Russian soldier. Margaret Olsen, as
Old Conchita, Margarita Espinosa, as
Maria, Elizabeth Doyle, as the Rus
sian Slave, and Astrid Arnoldson,
as the Russian Lieutenant, are all cast
in parts to which they are well fitted.
Particular notice should be taken
-of the Death dance, executed by Laura
j Peocock. This is an interpretive dance
of a. character that is entirely new
to the campus, and with Miss Peo
cock's admirable performance, is cer
tain to be one of the high points of
! the pageant.
But among the most important
| things of the Fiesta this year, and the
things that will set it off from other
productions, are the settings, the light
ing effects, and the costume work. In
building an outdoor amphitheatre in
the beautiful setting of Lagunita, the
first step was taken toward a success
ful show. A special stage was built
up of turf, and rows of natural seats

|
j graded cm the side of the hill over- /
looking it. Leslie Kiler has arranged
j a few sets almost severely simple that
set oft' the natural surrounding in a
very effective manner.
Harold Todd, who has handled the
Assembly hall lighting for the past two
years, has secured lighting equipment j
from the Family Club, and put it up
so as to make a play upon the stage j
that is entirely new to the campus, and
far superior to former efforts. The l
costumes have been arranged by Pa
-1 trice Naumau, who has worked for
I some time with Chrysella Dunker
Kiler. Too favorable comment cannot
j be made on the blending of color and
' appropriateness shown in the costum
ing.
The favored few who attended the
dress rehearsal of the "Romance of
Resanoff, the Russian, and Conchita,"
the 1926 Fiesta Lagunita, last night,
were surprised, agreeably surprised.
The pageant, which is scheduled for
8:15 o'clock tomorrow night on the
shores of Lagunita, exhibited the re
sults of the intensive rehearsing that
it has been undergoing ever since the
opening of this quarter.
The reason for the surprise of the
spectators is that pre-Fiesta gossip
has always been extremely unsatis
factory. If the past Fiestas have been
as good as the rehearsal promises for
this one, the gossip was certainly un
founded. The dances, the pantomine,
the sets, the costumes, and the light
ing approach as near to the profes
sional as the reviewer has seen on a
college campus.
Arthur Cyril, who is directing the
Fiesta, is from the Forest Theatre in
Carmel. He was dramatic coach at

Stanford at the time Gordon Davis
was a student here, and has been on
the professional stage with him. He
has had considerable experience with
this type of production, and is par
ticularly competent with the larger
groupings.
A change in the part of Conchita
was recently made. Kathleen Fitz has
been given the role, and though she
has had but a short time with the cast,
she showed an aptitude at pantomine
that will give the part a distinct per
sonality. Another change was that of
Wona, the Indian Slave, from Mar
jorie Robinson to Nelty Lefranc.
