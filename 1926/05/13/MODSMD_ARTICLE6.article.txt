Other University departments, in
cluding Economics and Geology, which
had planned dinners, have abandoned
the idea in view of the dinner which
the Trustees of the University are
holding in honor of the Stanford Na
tional Board and the Academic Coun
cil. The dinner will be held in the
Branner Hall dining room the same !
evening as the Law Association din
ner. The Law Association, however,
had made so many plans that it was
found impracticable to abandon them.
