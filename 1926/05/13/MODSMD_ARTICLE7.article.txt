# DR. MEARS BELIEVES ISSUE NOT SETTLED IN BRITISH STRIKE
## English Situation Affects Entire World, Not a Local Problem 
### 
"While it is happy news that defi
nite steps are being taken to end the
present British coal strike," said Dr.
Elliot G. Mears, acting professor of
the Graduate School of Business, in
discussing the economic aspects of
the strike, "it is unfortunately true
that no solution of the real point at
issue is in sight for the simple reason
that the British coal situation is not
a local matter but a far-reaching inter
national problem."
High-grade coal resources, conven
iently located at tidewater, explain
more than any other one factor Eng
land's dominant position in the world
marts, Professor Mears pointed out.
Ships leaving her shores carry manu
factures of high value but small bulk;
so there is ample space remaining to
carry coal for export sale. Among Brit
ain's exports coal ranks second only
to cotton goods, and brings in the
equivalent of several hundred million
dollars yearly.
"The whole industrial system in
England is tied up with the sale of
this coal. If the marginal coal mines
continue to be operated—some of
which must produce at the depth of
two miles —the excess cost of oper
ations places British merchants and
consumers at a real disadvantage since
this fuel is the main dependence for
the acquisition of foodstuffs and raw
materials from other countries."
"The crux of the matter," said Pro
fessor Mears, "is that oil is displacing
coal in shipping and in some indus
trial uses; bunkering stations around
the world no longer have the monopoly
they once did; and if British coal is
to compete successfully with American
and other coals i/i international mar
kets, the cost at the mine must be
kept down .otherwise not only the in
ternal economic status but also Bri
tain's advantages in international
financing, commerce, and shipping are
in serious jeopardy."
