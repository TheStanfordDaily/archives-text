# NINE COAST TEAMS AWAIT GUN IN ANNUAL CONFERENCE TRACK MEET SCHEDULED IN STADIUM
## Stanford, U.S.C., California Strongest Contestants For Coast Title TRIALS START TODAY Charteris Not in Best of Condition Because of Ear Trouble 
### Clif Moore 
There will be heats in the 100,
220, 440, and both hurdles events
starting at 2 o'clock today, accord
ing to a decision made by the
Pacific Coast Conference Graduate
Managers Association in a meeting
held this morning. Further busi
ness was postponed until this
afternoon's meeting.

Nine teams, representing every prin
cipal university on the coast, compete
tomorrow afternoon in the Stanford
stadium for the track and field cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. Trials in several of the events
are being held this afternoon.
The fight for the coast crown ap
pears to be a struggle, with Stanford,
U.S.C., and California making the
strongest bids. None of the six north
ern teams, Washington, Montana, Ore
gon. Washington State, 0.A.C., or
Idaho, are conceded much of a chance
to figure in the battle.
Charteris' Ears Lanced
A serious upset in the half-mile oc
curred yesterday when Charteris, star
Washington 880 runner, was forced to
undergo an operation upon his ears.
The Husky half-miler had his ears
lanced, but the operation will not
•cause him to withdraw his entry.
Every event promises to be of real
•championship caliber with many na
tionally-known athletes contending for
the honors. The two sprints loom as a
pair of the most bitterly contested
events on the program, with Barber
of California, House and Smith of
n.S.C., Sweet of Montana, and Clark
of Washington expected to produce
the best races in this year's coast
track history. Barber is conceded a
slight superiority in both races, but
any of the above-mentioned sprinters
are liable to break the tape ahead of
the Bruin flash.
Stanford is expected to have a glori
ous time in the quarter-mile, with Mil
ler, Storie, and Babcock favored to
place in the order named. Captain Bill
Richardson is rated above the other
three half-mile stars, Niersbach, Char
teris, and Boyden, and should come
close to setting a new coast or national
record in his favorite event.
U.S.C. Has Hurdlers
The U.S.C. stellar hurdlers, Grum
bles and Dye, are picked to take first
places in the hurdles, with West of
Stanford, Kelsy and Tuck of Oregon,
and Ragan and Johnson of California,
also figured in the battle. The low
and high sticks might be anybody's
races, and the times made under such
stiff competition should be near a
record.
Bud Houser of U.S.C. is the reigning
favorite to take both firsts in the
weight events, but he will be given a
great battle by Gerkin of California,
and Hoffman of Stanford. Wetzel, Ore
gon weight star, is also a strong con
tender.
King Favored
Bob King is given a slight edge over
Hampton of California, and Coggeshall
of U.S.C. to take a first place for Stan
ford in the high jump. Tom Work of
Stanford may come out of his slump to
beat out his opponents. Work now
holds the record in the event.
Stanford has a good chance to take
the first three places in the javelin,
with Harlow, Joaquin, and Shipkey all
capable of tossing the spear over 185
feet. Wetzel of Oregon and Cook of
U.S.C. are the only other javelin
throwers liable to give the Stanford
trio any great deal of opposition.
Sid Meeks is the favorite to take
first place in the broad jump, his mark
of 23 feet 8 inches made in the P.A.A.
meet last week being the best colle
giate jump on record on the coast this
year. Flanagan of Oregon, the present
record-holder, is a great competitive
jumper, and he will force the Cardinal
ace to his best effort. Macßae of Stan
ford, Bondshu of California, and Rey
nolds of U.S.C., are the other jumpers
sure to be in on the battle for first
place.
Coach Dink Templeton's relay team
is certain to win the four-lap event,
but a new record can hardly be ex
pected, owing to the number of teams
entered in the event. With eight other
tams on the track, the Cardinal quar
tet, Babcock, Storie, Richardson, and
Miller ,will undoubtedly run into a
great deal of opposition, so it would
be extremely difficult to negotiate the
distance in the usual fast time.
There will be heats in the 100,
220, 440, and both hurdles events
starting at 2 o'clock today, accord

220, 440, and both hurdles events
starting at 2 o'clock today, accord
ing to a decision made by the
Pacific Coast Conference Graduate
Managers Association in a meeting
held this morning. Further busi
ness was postponed until this
afternoon's meeting.

Nine teams, representing every prin
cipal university on the coast, compete
tomorrow afternoon in the Stanford
stadium for the track and field cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. Trials in several of the events
are being held this afternoon.
The fight for the coast crown ap
pears to be a struggle, with Stanford,
U.S.C., and California making the
strongest bids. None of the six north
ern teams, Washington, Montana, Ore
gon. Washington State, 0.A.C., or
Idaho, are conceded much of a chance
to figure in the battle.
Charteris' Ears Lanced
A serious upset in the half-mile oc
curred yesterday when Charteris, star
Washington 880 runner, was forced to
undergo an operation upon his ears.
The Husky half-miler had his ears
lanced, but the operation will not
•cause him to withdraw his entry.
Every event promises to be of real
•championship caliber with many na
tionally-known athletes contending for
the honors. The two sprints loom as a
pair of the most bitterly contested
events on the program, with Barber
of California, House and Smith of
n.S.C., Sweet of Montana, and Clark
of Washington expected to produce
the best races in this year's coast
track history. Barber is conceded a
slight superiority in both races, but
any of the above-mentioned sprinters
are liable to break the tape ahead of
the Bruin flash.
Stanford is expected to have a glori
ous time in the quarter-mile, with Mil
ler, Storie, and Babcock favored to
place in the order named. Captain Bill
Richardson is rated above the other
three half-mile stars, Niersbach, Char
teris, and Boyden, and should come
close to setting a new coast or national
record in his favorite event.
U.S.C. Has Hurdlers
The U.S.C. stellar hurdlers, Grum
bles and Dye, are picked to take first
places in the hurdles, with West of
Stanford, Kelsy and Tuck of Oregon,
and Ragan and Johnson of California,
also figured in the battle. The low
and high sticks might be anybody's
races, and the times made under such
stiff competition should be near a
record.
Bud Houser of U.S.C. is the reigning
favorite to take both firsts in the
weight events, but he will be given a
great battle by Gerkin of California,
and Hoffman of Stanford. Wetzel, Ore
gon weight star, is also a strong con
tender.
King Favored
Bob King is given a slight edge over
Hampton of California, and Coggeshall
of U.S.C. to take a first place for Stan
ford in the high jump. Tom Work of
Stanford may come out of his slump to
beat out his opponents. Work now
holds the record in the event.
Stanford has a good chance to take
the first three places in the javelin,
with Harlow, Joaquin, and Shipkey all
capable of tossing the spear over 185
feet. Wetzel of Oregon and Cook of
U.S.C. are the only other javelin
throwers liable to give the Stanford
trio any great deal of opposition.
Sid Meeks is the favorite to take
first place in the broad jump, his mark
of 23 feet 8 inches made in the P.A.A.
meet last week being the best colle
giate jump on record on the coast this
year. Flanagan of Oregon, the present
record-holder, is a great competitive
jumper, and he will force the Cardinal
ace to his best effort. Macßae of Stan
ford, Bondshu of California, and Rey
nolds of U.S.C., are the other jumpers
sure to be in on the battle for first
place.
Coach Dink Templeton's relay team
is certain to win the four-lap event,
but a new record can hardly be ex
pected, owing to the number of teams
entered in the event. With eight other
tams on the track, the Cardinal quar
tet, Babcock, Storie, Richardson, and
Miller ,will undoubtedly run into a
great deal of opposition, so it would
be extremely difficult to negotiate the
distance in the usual fast time.
There will be heats in the 100,
220, 440, and both hurdles events
starting at 2 o'clock today, accord
