# NINE COAST TEAMS AWAIT GUN IN ANNUAL CONFERENCE TRACK MEET SCHEDULED IN STADIUM
## Stanford, U.S.C., California Strongest Contestants For Coast Title TRIALS START TODAY Charteris Not in Best of Condition Because of Ear Trouble 
### Clif Moore 
There will be heats in the 100,
220, 440, and both hurdles events
starting at 2 o'clock today, accord
ing to a decision made by the
Pacific Coast Conference Graduate
Managers Association in a meeting
held this morning. Further busi
ness was postponed until this
afternoon's meeting.

Nine teams, representing every prin

tomorrow afternoon in the Stanford
stadium for the track and field cham

Idaho, are conceded much of a chance
to figure in the battle.

the honors. The two sprints loom as a
pair of the most bitterly contested
events on the program, with Barber
of California, House and Smith of
n.S.C., Sweet of Montana, and Clark
of Washington expected to produce
the best races in this year's coast
track history. Barber is conceded a
slight superiority in both races, but
any of the above-mentioned sprinters
are liable to break the tape ahead of
the Bruin flash.
Stanford is expected to have a glori
ous time in the quarter-mile, with Mil
ler, Storie, and Babcock favored to
place in the order named. Captain Bill
Richardson is rated above the other
three half-mile stars, Niersbach, Char
