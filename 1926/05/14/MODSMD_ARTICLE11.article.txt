## 
### 
For those alumni who could not at
end University Day, the Stanford
)and will give a concert Saturday eve
ling between 8 and 10 o'clock over
he KGO broadcasting station at Oak
and. Last year when the band played
iver a San Francisco station alumni
n seven different states heard the
jrogram. This year the program will
be heard in more states because the
Oakland station is larger and more
powerful than the San Francisco sta
tion.
The radio concert is being spon
sored by the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce, its members furnishing the
means of transportation for the band.
One of the attractions of the evening
will be a short talk by Ray W. Smith,
secretary of that organization, on the
university community. Also Margery
Blackwelder, soprano, accompanied on
the piano by Marguerite Negus, will
give two selections, and Benjamin F.
Culver will give a baritone solo.
Those members of the band who
will be heard in solo work are Claude
L. McCue, who will play on the saxo
phone, and Richard W. Taylor who
will give au euphronium solo. Walter
H. Heineman and H. Welydon Nuss
baum will repeat their French horn
and flute duet which made such a hit
with the audience at the formal con
cert of April 30.
The concluding numbers will be the
skyrocket yell followed by the Stan
ford Forever march, Come Join the
Band, and the Hymn.
