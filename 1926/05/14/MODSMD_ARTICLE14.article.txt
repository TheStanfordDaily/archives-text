# DAVID STARR JORDAN TALKS ON LIFE OF ROBERT L. STEVENSON
## Speaks of Great Writer as Friend Whom He Knew Personally 
### 
Robert Louis Stevenson was the sub- ■
ject of Dr. Jordan's regular Thursday j
evening lecture, held at his home last j
night. He discussed the life and works .
of this man who he referred to as a !
friend of his.
Discussing Stevenson's life, Dr. Jor
dan said that he was a man who suf-1
fered much physical discomfort from i
illnesses, but he triumphed over many
of these discomforts during his life-;
time. Doctors at that time were just j
finding out that ordinary colds are in-;
fectious, and Stevenson had a cold i
that proved to be a serious drain upon [
his body.
Stevenson came out to San Fran-:
«isco when he was a young man and
lived there for a time, returning to
Europe. Here he met his future mate, i
He moved to London, but the foggy !
weather was too hard on him, so he!
came back to California with his wife.
They settled in Monterey for a while
and then moved to the Silverado sil
ver mine. Then Robert Louis Steven-j
son decided that this weather also was
too hard on him and made arrange- j
ments to move to the South Seas!
where he lived until he died.
Dr. Jordan said that it has been
stated that the moving of Stevenson |
to the South Seas was the greatest
thing that has happened to literature
since Byron went to Greece. A road
was built to Stevenson's home and j
marked "The Road to the Warm
Heart."
After Stevenson's death, the people
built a trail to the top of Mount Vaea.
There they dug a grave out of the ;
lava and cemented it to make it
strong. On one side of the tomb was '
placed a native flower, the hibiscus,;
with the inscription "To the World- j
Renowned Teller of Tales." On the I
other side was a Scotch thistle, and j
also the epitaph that Stevenson had
written, ending, "Home is the sailor,
home from the sea."
