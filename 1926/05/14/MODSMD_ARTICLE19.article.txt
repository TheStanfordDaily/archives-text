# Our Guests

Tomorrow the University will be the host of two large groups —the
Stanford alumni and the track and field athletes of the Pacific Coast C ©n
ference universities. Our guests should he well received and attended.
Some fourteen Cardinals and Coach "Dink" Templeton have planned the
entertainment for the visiting athletes, while several committees under the
guidance of Alumni Secretary John E. McDowell and Dudley S. De (jroot
have arranged the program for the "grads."
In both cases the student body has been assigned a role.
Last evening stickers on which appeared the words, "Alumni Wel
come, Hop In," were plastered to the windshields of campus automobiles,
Providing transportation is only one of the many ways which we have to
demonstrate our hospitality. Every student should be at once a reception
committee and an information bureau.
Probably every student has returned to his high school after graduation
lo find that he is a stranger in a familiar place, it is an uncanny sensation
and one that no alumni should be forced to experience. On behalf of the
student body, the Daily Palo Alto extends to the returning alumni a
cordial welcome, and the assurance that the campus is theirs for the day.
While the nine teams are struggling for points at tomorrow's meet 900
Stanford rooters will form an organized rooting section to show the Con
ference officials and visiting athletes how rooting section stunts are staged.
It is old stuff to the alumni and students; but to most of the Conference
representatives it will be something new and different. 1 lie Rally Com
mittee has mapped out the stunts which will be performed with cards only.
Every purchaser of a rooter's ticket will be expected to wear a white shirt
and occupy a seat in the reserved section.
Again we welcome our visitors !
