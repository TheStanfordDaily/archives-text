# HELEN ATKINSON TO PLAY VIOLIN SOLOS IN CHURCH SERVICE
## 
### 
Mrs. Helen Engel Atkinson, violinist
of Palo Alto, will be soloist at the
regular organ recital to be given Sun
day afternoon at 4 o'clock in the Me
morial Church. Mrs. Atkinson is a
member of the first violin section of
the San Francisco Symphony and has
the distinction of being one of the
relatively few women in the orchestra.
She is also director of the Stanford
University orchestra.
Together with Warren D. Allen, Mrs.
Atkinson will play "Chaconne," a com
position of Tommaso Vitali, a seven
teenth century composer. The "Cha
conne" is in the best classical tradition
which prevailed at the period and has
much of the formal grace and charm
that characterizes the music of the
time.
Other compositions which Allen will
render as organ solos include modern
works. "Pastorale in A Major" is by
Winter Watts, a contemporary Ameri
can writer for organ and orchestra,
whose work has attracted much favor
able comment. The "Pastorale" is so
recent that it is not as yet published
and will be played by Allen from
manuscript.
"Sketch in F Minor" is by Robert
Schumann, and has all the romantic
and intimate quality associated with
its composer who was the very heart
of the Bomantlc tendency in music.
"Adagio from the Fifth Symphony"
by Charles Marie Widor, and "Toccata
in B Minor" by Augustin Barrie will
end the recital.
