# The 						Cry of "Wolf"
## 
### 
There is moss around the old story of the shepherd boy who cried
"Wolf" once too often and thereby lost the aid he desired. However* the
moral of the story is as strong today as it ever was.
This morning the campus fire department received a 5 a.m. call and
readily responded—but it is entirely possible that they might, instead, have
thought it but another false alarm (one of many turned in during the past
two weeks) and failed to answer speedily.
There is a limit to any man's patience—even a fireman's—and having
reached this limit through two weeks of false alarms and calls to paltry
hay-fires, the department would actually have been somewhat justified
had they lain abed. I f the excitement-seeking youngsters of the University
will persist in their tricks, real tragedies may occur.
The editor is not the only individual to feel the injustice being done the
fire department and indirectly the entire University. Insurance officials
have indignantly pointed out the extreme hazard that lies in the proximity
of frequent hay-fires to local homes. Sparks may easily fly from burning
grass in addition to the possibility of the flames spreading as do forest
fires. It has also been suggested that it is very possible for two blazes to
occur simultaneously, with the hay-fire happening first. This would leave
a serious blaze, starting immediately after, to burn itself out with the de
partment goose-chasing about the campus attending to fires set by thought
less incendiaries.
Incidently, due publicity is herewith given to the praise and thanks
which is being" broadcast today by the members of Chief Dugan's squad
for the student aid given the department this morning. This, according
to the Chief, applies not only to the axe-wielding stalwarts who augmented
the local force, but to the members of Kappa Kappa Gamma who served a
satisfying breakfast to the fire-fighters, a la Red Cross.
