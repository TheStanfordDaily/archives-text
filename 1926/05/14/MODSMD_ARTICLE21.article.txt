# La 						Fiesta Lagunita
## 
### 
After months of preparation the Stanford women are ready for the j
presentation of La Fiesta Lagunita. And when we say Stanford women,
we mean the "500" for practically every member of the A.W.S. is in some j
manner interested in the production.
The Fiesta as it is to he given tonight is the product of several years j
of trial and discard. Numerous themes have been attempted and types of j
atmosphere used until those in charge believe they have exactly what is j
desired by the University for presentation tonight.
The idea behind such presentation is in itself worthy of commendation, j
Stanford could rightly be criticized if it did not offer this manner of
activity with which to absorb the interest of the women students for three
months of the year. A proper appreciation by the University of the idea
and the work would be to view the Fiesta tonight. Approximately two]
thousand dollars has been spent in costumes and scenery, and while the
A.W.S. cannot hope to entirely regain this amount we hope that the ex
penditure will be partially repaid in an encouraging sale of tickets.
