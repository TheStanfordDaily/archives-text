Chicago, May 5. —"What is this, yet, I see by the paper?" shouted Abdul :
"Hull" Amir to his roommate, Ivan "Killer" Skivar, at W. Madison |
Street, today, according to the story told the police by Skivar.
Brandishing a newspaper in the face of Skivar, Amir is alleged to have j
screamed, "Read that, low life! Head that. 'BANDIT PAIR GET $42.24 IN
GAS STATION HOLDUP'."
"Crook! Robber! Hold out on me, will you!"
Here Amir socked Skivar on the cauliflower and the fight was on. Knives,
pistols, machine-guns, and coast-defense rifles were brought into the fray by
the two suspects.
The distracted landlady, Mrs. Sophronia Gatch, ran to the street, and
called Officer Goniff McCubbin of the Stock Yards Station who was asleep in
the rear of Casey's saloon. McCubbin forced entrance into the quarters of
the two men and arrested them.
They will be arraigned tomorrow in Judge Lewis' court.

Chicago, May 6.— (C.N.A.) —Peace has spread her snowy wings over the!
mended friendship of Abdul "Bull" Amir and Ivan "Killer" Skivar, who today !
were arraigned in Judge Lewis' court on a charge of conduct unbecoming i
gentlemen and bandit suspects. They were arrested yesterday by Officer I ,
McCubbin of the Stock Yards Station in a fight in the rooms at W. I
Madison Street.
"You see, judge," Skivar said in court, "half of $42.24 is $21.12. The other
day I gave Amir $21 for his part in a business venture of ours. An article in j
a newspaper, mentioning some holdup swag as $42.24, incensed him for some j
reason, and we had words.
"Amir, poor fellow, is no great business man and never thinks of expenses.;
In our business deal I was forced to buy a gallon of gasoline, for which I paid 1
$.24 and I charged it off against the profits, making $21 the fair share for each, j
Because of Amir's hot temper, I did not get a chance to explain this to him or !
show him the accounts on our venture."
Here Skivar produced his ledgers, which proved his statement.
"I know you are thinking we had something to do with that gas station
job, you old rascal," Skivar then chaffingly told the judge.
The judge admitted as much.
"But you know, although we have been before you on twenty or more !
robbery charges, judge," Skivar continued, "both of us promised that nice ;
reformer, Mrs. Bernice Horses, that we would never do it again."
This was said with a sob which started tears to the eyes of the bailiff
and left the judge not unmoved.
As a result, Skivar and Amir were released under bond to keep the peace. l
Their bond was set at $10.50, or half of $21.

Clam-Lovers who called to present a petition for the governmental erection
of a suitable monument to Mary Ann McCarthy of the shores of San Francisco i

Chicago, May 6.— (C.N.A.) —Peace has spread her snowy wings over the!
mended friendship of Abdul "Bull" Amir and Ivan "Killer" Skivar, who today !
were arraigned in Judge Lewis' court on a charge of conduct unbecoming i
gentlemen and bandit suspects. They were arrested yesterday by Officer I ,
McCubbin of the Stock Yards Station in a fight in the rooms at W. I
Madison Street.
"You see, judge," Skivar said in court, "half of $42.24 is $21.12. The other
day I gave Amir $21 for his part in a business venture of ours. An article in j
a newspaper, mentioning some holdup swag as $42.24, incensed him for some j
reason, and we had words.
"Amir, poor fellow, is no great business man and never thinks of expenses.;
In our business deal I was forced to buy a gallon of gasoline, for which I paid 1
$.24 and I charged it off against the profits, making $21 the fair share for each, j
Because of Amir's hot temper, I did not get a chance to explain this to him or !
show him the accounts on our venture."
Here Skivar produced his ledgers, which proved his statement.
"I know you are thinking we had something to do with that gas station
job, you old rascal," Skivar then chaffingly told the judge.
The judge admitted as much.
"But you know, although we have been before you on twenty or more !
robbery charges, judge," Skivar continued, "both of us promised that nice ;
reformer, Mrs. Bernice Horses, that we would never do it again."
This was said with a sob which started tears to the eyes of the bailiff
and left the judge not unmoved.
As a result, Skivar and Amir were released under bond to keep the peace. l
Their bond was set at $10.50, or half of $21.

Washington, May 7.— (C.N.A.) —"I have always said that newspapers were;
at the bottom of the crime wave which is undermining the youth of this great
nation," said Congressman Amos Schnauss today before the delegation of
Clam-Lovers who called to present a petition for the governmental erection
of a suitable monument to Mary Ann McCarthy of the shores of San Francisco i
Bay.
"Were it not for the dreadful publicity given high school drinking-parties ;
and gas-station banditry, this country would be better off and a part of the ,
| enormous expense of enforcement might be directed to the erection of j
monuments to our nation's great.
"I am in favor of Mary Ann McCarthy and Officer McCubbin who was so
kind to those two unfortunate, misunderstood boys in the recent Chicago l

Chicago, May 5. —"What is this, yet, I see by the paper?" shouted Abdul :

Brandishing a newspaper in the face of Skivar, Amir is alleged to have j
screamed, "Read that, low life! Head that. 'BANDIT PAIR GET $42.24 IN
GAS STATION HOLDUP'."
"Crook! Robber! Hold out on me, will you!"
Here Amir socked Skivar on the cauliflower and the fight was on. Knives,
pistols, machine-guns, and coast-defense rifles were brought into the fray by
the two suspects.
