# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
In criticizing plays or stage per
formances we have to take into con
sideration time and place. Over-empha
sis often leads to as many errors and
mistakes as non-emphasis. Exaggera
tion and pure imagination may make
plays to be unrealistic, especially a
foreign play. Few people have any
concrete idea as to the foreign play—
the time and place of its happening.
With this point in view it will per
haps be not mistakable for me to say
that Mr. Theon Wright of the Palo
Alto Times and Mr. Calvin Behle of
the Daily Palo Alto in their criticism
of the Chinese play produced pn Tues
day evening by 19b commit the error
mentioned. Their ideas concerning the
Oriental people show perhaps a gross,
undiscriminating general impression.
They conceive* that the Chinese talk
and act entirely different from the
Americans, but their over-emphasis
upon this factor leads them to a catas
trophic misunderstanding of the Ori
ental people.
Perhaps these gentlemen may have
from time to time met Chinese or
Japanese and heard them talk different
languages and noticed their differences
from the English and thereby formed
conclusions that "Clear-cut booming
tones of the Occident served very
feebly to carry over the strange sym
bolism of the Orient, and occasionally
reduced to burlesque what might have

! carried." There is 110 ground to say
; that the Chinese do not talk in a clear-
I cut booming tone. It is only personal
impression that' makes the critic feel
so.
Regarding the actions, I believe that
the players did assimilate many of the
Oriental imaginary and poetic ways of
presenting our classic plays. Moreover,
with the help of the Chinese students
here 011 this campus they did more or
I less act like the Chinese —when pre
[ senting classic drama.
The play, "The Thrice-Promised
Bride," occurs as early as 600 A.D.
Ancient Chinese were quite different
from the Chinese Empire preceding
the Republic. Mr. Wright's conception
of the Mandarin and the Manchurian
War Lord is entirely misconceived.
For the Chinese customs as well as
the political and military systems have
undergone a great change since the
Manchus entered into China in 1644.
Manchurian War Lord is a new term.
It refers only to Chang Tso. the pres
ent Chinese military officer in Man
churia. The representation of the
Warrior Knight in "The Thrice-Prom
ised Bride" was based upon ancient
tradition and classic stage representa
tion. —TSO SHIH.
In celebration of the end of the sea
son of winter sports at McGill Univer
sity. Montreal, a giant toboggan party
was held.
Great Britain and Ireland still rank
first in total tonnage of shipbuilding.

Regarding the actions, I believe that
the players did assimilate many of the

presenting our classic plays. Moreover,

Ancient Chinese were quite different

Manchurian War Lord is a new term.
It refers only to Chang Tso. the pres

The Editor, Sir:
In criticizing plays or stage per
formances we have to take into con
sideration time and place. Over-empha
sis often leads to as many errors and
mistakes as non-emphasis. Exaggera
tion and pure imagination may make
plays to be unrealistic, especially a
foreign play. Few people have any
concrete idea as to the foreign play—
the time and place of its happening.
With this point in view it will per
haps be not mistakable for me to say
that Mr. Theon Wright of the Palo
Alto Times and Mr. Calvin Behle of
the Daily Palo Alto in their criticism
of the Chinese play produced pn Tues
day evening by 19b commit the error
mentioned. Their ideas concerning the
Oriental people show perhaps a gross,
undiscriminating general impression.
They conceive* that the Chinese talk
and act entirely different from the
Americans, but their over-emphasis
upon this factor leads them to a catas
trophic misunderstanding of the Ori
ental people.
Perhaps these gentlemen may have
from time to time met Chinese or
Japanese and heard them talk different
languages and noticed their differences
from the English and thereby formed
conclusions that "Clear-cut booming
tones of the Occident served very
feebly to carry over the strange sym
bolism of the Orient, and occasionally
reduced to burlesque what might have

! carried." There is 110 ground to say
; that the Chinese do not talk in a clear-
I cut booming tone. It is only personal
impression that' makes the critic feel
