# WELTON CROOK WILL CONDUCT TESTS FOR COAST STEEL WORKS
## Metallurgical Laboratories Used for Experiments On Case-Hardening 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Experimental work on the develop-1
ment of a new case-hardening steel for
the Pacific Coast Steel Company is
being carried 011 by Welton J. Crook,
professor of metallurgy, at the Stan- J
$prd metallurgical laboratories. Pro
fessor Crook is consulting metallurgi- j
cal engineer for the steel company. ;
The laboratory at Stanford is acting !
as an experimental plant of the P.C.S.
Company, since a part of the apparatus !
was donated by it to the University, j
All the company's heat treating and j.
other testing is done at the laboratory .
at Stanford.
The process in use at the present j
time for the case-hardening of steel is I
as follows: the steel is placed in a spe
cially prepared box, made of a nickel
chrome alloy, and is packed with cas- 1
ing material, which is the company's
own invention. This material is made
as a by-product of the county can
neries ; it is made of peach pits, cal
cined, or retorted, and then quenched i
in sodium carbonate water. This ma-!
terial is packed around the steel, and j
the box is placed in an electric fur
nace with an automatic heat control.
Steel Heated
While in the furnace, it is heated to
1700 degrees Fahrenheit for the num- j
ber of hours necessary to get the pro
per hardness. This time varies, since â€¢
the longer it heats, the thicker the'
; case-hardened cover will become. Dur
j ing the heating process, the carbon
j from the casing material penetrates
I the steel, so that it becomes carbon-
I ized in a shell around the central
j core, which remains soft.
The steel is hardened by heating
again and quenching in cold water, i
| Thus, the oxide remains hard, while !
: the core stays soft and more or less i
! flexible. This type of steel is used ex
-1 tensively in the construction of auto
' mobile wrist pins. The hardened outer '
; coat gives great wear, while the soft 1
j cort allows enough resilency so that
shocks will not snap the pin.
The work going on is for the pur
pose of developing steel with these
requirements. The steel company is i
working in conjunction with the Cater
pillar Tractor Company, of San Lean
dro, who will be the purchasers.
The steel undergoing examination
I must pass certain specifications, in-!
eluding the S.A.E. test, or the Society I
of Automobile Engineers' 1020 steel
1 specification. The 1020 is a sort of
steel shorthand, in that the first nu
-1 meral, one, means that it is plain
i carbon steel, the following zero means
no alloy, and the twenty indicates the
j carbon content of the specimen. The
! steel, after passing this S.A.E. test,
1 must be free of any surface seams
| over one-sixteenth of an inch in depth.
Must Pass Quench Test
The next qualification is that it pass
a quench test. The material is heated
! in the electric furnace to between 1660
I and 1670 degrees Fahrenheit for a
period of twenty minutes, and then is !
quenched in cold water. After this j
treatment, the hardness must fall with-1
! in certain limits. This hardened speci- j
men is then broken; the fracture must 1
j show freedom from foreign inclusions, j
and also must show fine grain size. I
Following this is the carbonizing
I test. This is the process of case-hard
j ening described before, except that a
piece of normal steel undergoes the
i test under the same conditions and!
I 1
in the same box with the experimental
j steel. After the preliminary heat, the ;
I steels are cooled and reheated to 1420
I to 2440 dgrees temperature, and then
i quenched in cold water. Then the
j depth of the case is measured in both
1 normal and experimental steel. The!
| case on the sample must at least equal j
j that on the normal steel.
The original steel, before going j
through the tests, must pass the frac- j
j ture test "as rolled." The steel bar has j
i a slot cut in it with a hack saw, or
long shrinkage cavities, internal blow
holes, and inclusions, and must have :
| desirable grain structure.
