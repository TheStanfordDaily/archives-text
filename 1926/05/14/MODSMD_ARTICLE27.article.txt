# VARIED MODELS OF MACHINE GUNS SENT FOR R.O.T.C. STUDY
## Weapons Used by A.E.F., Now Obsolete, Show Growth of Types 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Several machine guns and automatic J
rifles have been sent by the United j
States government to the ordnance j
department of the Stanford R.O.T.C. j
unit in order that the development and |
evolution of the various systems of I
their operation may be studied. Sev-j
eral obsolete rifles have also been re-1
reived which will be used in study in
connection with the modern Spring-
Held army rifle.
The machine guns have been racked
and set up at the ordnance department
where they can be seen by those in
terested. The department offices are
next to the car tracks, immediately
behind the clock tower. The showroom
includes several large guns used in
field artillery work, besides tractors
and trucks of interest.

The machine guns 011 exhibition
which were used in the American Expe
ditionary Forces are the Browning
water-cooled .30 caliber, model 1917,
which is an improvement over the
types previously used extensively by
the A.E.F. in France. Models of these
guns are also on exhibition.
The rifles and machine guns date
back to the Colt machine gun, .30
caliber, model 1902. This gun is air
cooled, and is operated by gas. There
is an added cylinder below the barrel
of the gun, which is connected with
the barrel through a porthole in the
barrel. After the bullet has passed
this hole, and before it leaves the muz
zle, there is a high gas pressure in
the barrel originating in the propel-1
lant charge of powder. This pressure I
is transmitted into the extra cylinder, j
and works a piston, which in turn i
operates the breach action of the gun I
in ejecting the spent cartridge shell !
and reloading with a new one.
The operator running the firing
holds down on the trigger, and after
each new shell is loaded into the
breach the hammer falls and fires it.
The gun is cooled by air, the heat j
radiating from a fluted addition to I
the barrel, resembling the outside of I
a motorcycle cylinder.
Maxim Water-Cooled
A Maxim machine gun, model 1904, i
caliber .30, water-cooled gun is a little !
later development in gunnery. The
cooling of this gun and other water
cooled models is accomplished by a
water jacket with a steam outlet,
which covers part of the barrel of the
gun. This gun has been perfected with
this feature in order to facilitate the
rapid cooling of the barrel and the
consequent efficiency in sustained fir
ing which results.
A Benet-Mercie automatic rifle is
also included in the guns, which is a
development of the English Hotchkiss
machine gun. It also is air-cooled and
gas-operated.
An automatic used largely by the
A.E.F. in France is the Chauchat auto
matic rifle. This gun fires 300' rounds
of ammunition per minute, and is of
the recoil-operated, air-cooled type.
The recoil-operated gun works from
the recoil of the shot. The breach is
thrown open, the spent cartridge is
ejected, and a new load is thrown in.
Vickers Gun Interesting
Another interesting, although obso
lete gun is the Vickers gun. It uses
.30 caliber ammunition, and fires 600
shots per minute. Tt is fed from a web
bing belt, carrying 250 rounds of am
munition. Several of the guns men
tioned are operated with synchronizers
which so regulate the speed of firing
that bullets may be sent between the
blades of an aeroplane propeller re
volving at full speed, and not strike
the blades. This gun is a variation of
the Maxim giyi. It is a 1915 model.

cooled models is accomplished by a
water jacket with a steam outlet,
which covers part of the barrel of the
gun. This gun has been perfected with
this feature in order to facilitate the
rapid cooling of the barrel and the
consequent efficiency in sustained fir
ing which results.
A Benet-Mercie automatic rifle is
also included in the guns, which is a
development of the English Hotchkiss
machine gun. It also is air-cooled and
gas-operated.
An automatic used largely by the
A.E.F. in France is the Chauchat auto
matic rifle. This gun fires 300' rounds
of ammunition per minute, and is of
the recoil-operated, air-cooled type.
The recoil-operated gun works from
the recoil of the shot. The breach is
thrown open, the spent cartridge is
ejected, and a new load is thrown in.
Vickers Gun Interesting
Another interesting, although obso
lete gun is the Vickers gun. It uses
.30 caliber ammunition, and fires 600
shots per minute. Tt is fed from a web
bing belt, carrying 250 rounds of am
munition. Several of the guns men
tioned are operated with synchronizers
which so regulate the speed of firing
that bullets may be sent between the
blades of an aeroplane propeller re
volving at full speed, and not strike
the blades. This gun is a variation of
the Maxim giyi. It is a 1915 model.
Several machine guns and automatic J
rifles have been sent by the United j
States government to the ordnance j
department of the Stanford R.O.T.C. j
unit in order that the development and |
evolution of the various systems of I
their operation may be studied. Sev-j
eral obsolete rifles have also been re-1
reived which will be used in study in
connection with the modern Spring-
Held army rifle.
The machine guns have been racked
and set up at the ordnance department
where they can be seen by those in
terested. The department offices are
next to the car tracks, immediately
behind the clock tower. The showroom
includes several large guns used in
field artillery work, besides tractors
and trucks of interest.

The machine guns 011 exhibition
which were used in the American Expe
ditionary Forces are the Browning
water-cooled .30 caliber, model 1917,
which is an improvement over the
types previously used extensively by
the A.E.F. in France. Models of these
guns are also on exhibition.
The rifles and machine guns date
back to the Colt machine gun, .30
caliber, model 1902. This gun is air
cooled, and is operated by gas. There
is an added cylinder below the barrel
of the gun, which is connected with
the barrel through a porthole in the
barrel. After the bullet has passed
this hole, and before it leaves the muz
zle, there is a high gas pressure in
the barrel originating in the propel-1
lant charge of powder. This pressure I
is transmitted into the extra cylinder, j
and works a piston, which in turn i
operates the breach action of the gun I
in ejecting the spent cartridge shell !
and reloading with a new one.
The operator running the firing
holds down on the trigger, and after
each new shell is loaded into the
breach the hammer falls and fires it.
The gun is cooled by air, the heat j
radiating from a fluted addition to I
the barrel, resembling the outside of I
a motorcycle cylinder.
Maxim Water-Cooled
A Maxim machine gun, model 1904, i
caliber .30, water-cooled gun is a little !
