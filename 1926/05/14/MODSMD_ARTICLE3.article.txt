lon, at present at the head of League j
VII, would fall into a triple tie should j
it lose to Chi Psi this afternoon.
The semi-finals will take place on
Wednesday and the finals Friday. j
The Alpha Delts came out from hid- j
ing yesterday, played their game with j
the Betas, and won, 5-4, which consid-j
erably upset the dope. The Alpha Delt j
team has played but one game this :
season, winning that from Delta Tau
Delta, and forfeiting the remaining |
contests. The Betas last week won the j
championship through their command
ing lead in the percentage column.
The game itselt was one of that
kind often heard of but seldom seen, i
won in the last inning with two out
and two on base when the unsung
hero lines, out a home run. That is ,
what Neil Miller did when Pitcher I
AI Herrington of the Betas grooved |
one over where he wanted it. Valen-'
tine and Dunn scored by the clout. J
The former brought in the other two i
of the winners' runs .making the per- ]
feet total of three hits and three runs 1
in three times at bat. Dennis was j
the winning pitcher.
Alpha Kappa Lambda threw a mon
key wrench into the League IV ma
chinery by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma
7-6. A triple tie now exists between
these two teams and Breakers for the
championship.
Phi Kaps Come Close
The A.K.L.'s were leading 7-1 until
the last of the seventh, when the Phi
Kaps settled down to business and
scratched up five runs in the score
book, but this was insufficient. Meak
in's triple was the notable hit of the
rally. Hubbard, Sanders, Clark, and
Wright scored successively in this
inning.
A walk, a triple, and two errors were
responsible for four A.K.L. runs in the
first inning, scored by Verplank, Daw
son, Cornell, and Barnett.
Starting out with a lead of five runs,
Phi Gamma Delta easily outclassed
the A.T.O. men, 9-3. After the first
inning the game was never in doubt.
Hunt, Elliot, and Boynton each scored !
twice for the Fijis, while Blazier,
Broenkow, and Adams contributed one
tally each.
Pegcam. A.T.O. pitcher, was the star
for his team, making two runs, one of
which was a homer. McCreery brought
in the other score.
Orgy of Hitting
The peculiar feature of the El Capi- i
tan-Phi Sigma Kappa game was that
each team batted around in the sev
enth inning in an orgy of hitting and
walking. El Capitan emerged victors,
17-11, however, although the hits were
divided more closely, 10-8. The contest
was played on the varsity diamond.
Yesterday's victory puts El Capitan
secure in second place in League VII,
and the result of the S.A.E.-Chi Psi
game tomorrow will determine wheth
er these three nines will enter into a
tie for first place honors.
Title Is Cinched
Delta Chi ran away with El Toro
with a 16-3 score and cinched the
championship of League V. The vic
tory gives Delta Chi an undefeated
place in the running for the pennant.
The game started out much in favor
of El Toro when, in the first inning,
Shurill, Homlvn, and Sutro crossed
the base for runs. But these runs
proved both the first and the last to
be brought in by the club. In the sec
ond half of the first, Delta Chi made
three hits and two runs.
The big surprise of the day came
in the last of the fourth. Hay came to
bat for Delta Chi with two men down.
He made first on a hit, reached third
by steals, and was brought in by a
hit by Frazer. Slater singled, and a
moment later reached home when
Goodsell slammed out a home run.
Lytel almost repeated Goodsell's
performance by knocking out a three
base hit immediately after. Sandys,
following Lytel's example, laid out an
other three-baser. A whole series of
one-base hits by Salzman, Biaginni,
Hay, Slater, and Newcomb followed in
close order.
Breakers-A.K.L. Tied
The Breakers nine finished out a
tie in League IV this afternoon by de
cisively defeating Sequoia I. The game
was a walkaway for the eating club
from the very first inning when a
total of eleven runs were made.
Before the game was over, Breakers
had mounted up a total of 18 runs,
while Sequoia had failed to cross home
plate for a single. The good pitching
of George was largely responsible for
shutting out Sequoia.
At the present writing, Breakers
and Alpha Kappa Lambda are tied for
the league championship.

these two teams and Breakers for the
championship.
Phi Kaps Come Close
The A.K.L.'s were leading 7-1 until
the last of the seventh, when the Phi
Kaps settled down to business and
scratched up five runs in the score
book, but this was insufficient. Meak
in's triple was the notable hit of the
rally. Hubbard, Sanders, Clark, and
Wright scored successively in this
inning.
A walk, a triple, and two errors were
responsible for four A.K.L. runs in the
first inning, scored by Verplank, Daw
son, Cornell, and Barnett.
Starting out with a lead of five runs,
Phi Gamma Delta easily outclassed
the A.T.O. men, 9-3. After the first
inning the game was never in doubt.
Hunt, Elliot, and Boynton each scored !
twice for the Fijis, while Blazier,
Broenkow, and Adams contributed one
tally each.
Pegcam. A.T.O. pitcher, was the star
for his team, making two runs, one of
which was a homer. McCreery brought
in the other score.
Orgy of Hitting
The peculiar feature of the El Capi- i
tan-Phi Sigma Kappa game was that
each team batted around in the sev
enth inning in an orgy of hitting and
walking. El Capitan emerged victors,
17-11, however, although the hits were
divided more closely, 10-8. The contest
was played on the varsity diamond.
Yesterday's victory puts El Capitan
secure in second place in League VII,
and the result of the S.A.E.-Chi Psi
game tomorrow will determine wheth
er these three nines will enter into a
tie for first place honors.
Title Is Cinched
Delta Chi ran away with El Toro
with a 16-3 score and cinched the
championship of League V. The vic
tory gives Delta Chi an undefeated
place in the running for the pennant.
The game started out much in favor
of El Toro when, in the first inning,
Shurill, Homlvn, and Sutro crossed
the base for runs. But these runs
proved both the first and the last to
be brought in by the club. In the sec
ond half of the first, Delta Chi made
three hits and two runs.
The big surprise of the day came
in the last of the fourth. Hay came to
bat for Delta Chi with two men down.
He made first on a hit, reached third
by steals, and was brought in by a
hit by Frazer. Slater singled, and a
moment later reached home when
Goodsell slammed out a home run.
Lytel almost repeated Goodsell's
performance by knocking out a three
base hit immediately after. Sandys,
following Lytel's example, laid out an
other three-baser. A whole series of
one-base hits by Salzman, Biaginni,
Hay, Slater, and Newcomb followed in
close order.
Breakers-A.K.L. Tied
The Breakers nine finished out a
tie in League IV this afternoon by de
cisively defeating Sequoia I. The game

from the very first inning when a
total of eleven runs were made.
Before the game was over, Breakers
had mounted up a total of 18 runs,
while Sequoia had failed to cross home
plate for a single. The good pitching

in the last of the fourth. Hay came to
bat for Delta Chi with two men down.
He made first on a hit, reached third
by steals, and was brought in by a
hit by Frazer. Slater singled, and a
moment later reached home when
Goodsell slammed out a home run.
Lytel almost repeated Goodsell's
performance by knocking out a three
base hit immediately after. Sandys,
following Lytel's example, laid out an
other three-baser. A whole series of
one-base hits by Salzman, Biaginni,
Hay, Slater, and Newcomb followed in
close order.
Breakers-A.K.L. Tied
The Breakers nine finished out a
tie in League IV this afternoon by de
cisively defeating Sequoia I. The game

from the very first inning when a
total of eleven runs were made.
Before the game was over, Breakers
had mounted up a total of 18 runs,
while Sequoia had failed to cross home
plate for a single. The good pitching
of George was largely responsible for
shutting out Sequoia.
At the present writing, Breakers
and Alpha Kappa Lambda are tied for
the league championship.
Tomorrow's games: Sigma Nu vs.
El Campo, Sigma Alpha Epsilon vs.
Chi Psi, Theta Xi vs. Delta Upsilon.

Breakers are tied for the title in
League IV, and will probably play off
tomorrow morning. Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon, at present at the head of League j
VII, would fall into a triple tie should j
it lose to Chi Psi this afternoon.
The semi-finals will take place on
Wednesday and the finals Friday. j
The Alpha Delts came out from hid- j
ing yesterday, played their game with j
the Betas, and won, 5-4, which consid-j
erably upset the dope. The Alpha Delt j
team has played but one game this :
season, winning that from Delta Tau
Delta, and forfeiting the remaining |
contests. The Betas last week won the j
championship through their command
ing lead in the percentage column.
The game itselt was one of that
kind often heard of but seldom seen, i
won in the last inning with two out
and two on base when the unsung
hero lines, out a home run. That is ,
what Neil Miller did when Pitcher I
AI Herrington of the Betas grooved |
one over where he wanted it. Valen-'
tine and Dunn scored by the clout. J
The former brought in the other two i
of the winners' runs .making the per- ]
feet total of three hits and three runs 1
in three times at bat. Dennis was j
the winning pitcher.
Alpha Kappa Lambda threw a mon
key wrench into the League IV ma
chinery by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma
7-6. A triple tie now exists between
these two teams and Breakers for the
championship.
Phi Kaps Come Close
The A.K.L.'s were leading 7-1 until
the last of the seventh, when the Phi
Kaps settled down to business and
scratched up five runs in the score
book, but this was insufficient. Meak
in's triple was the notable hit of the
rally. Hubbard, Sanders, Clark, and
Wright scored successively in this
inning.
A walk, a triple, and two errors were
responsible for four A.K.L. runs in the
first inning, scored by Verplank, Daw
son, Cornell, and Barnett.
Starting out with a lead of five runs,
Phi Gamma Delta easily outclassed
the A.T.O. men, 9-3. After the first
inning the game was never in doubt.
Hunt, Elliot, and Boynton each scored !
twice for the Fijis, while Blazier,
Broenkow, and Adams contributed one
tally each.
Pegcam. A.T.O. pitcher, was the star
for his team, making two runs, one of
which was a homer. McCreery brought
in the other score.
Orgy of Hitting
The peculiar feature of the El Capi- i
tan-Phi Sigma Kappa game was that
each team batted around in the sev
enth inning in an orgy of hitting and
walking. El Capitan emerged victors,
17-11, however, although the hits were
divided more closely, 10-8. The contest
was played on the varsity diamond.
Yesterday's victory puts El Capitan
secure in second place in League VII,
and the result of the S.A.E.-Chi Psi
game tomorrow will determine wheth
er these three nines will enter into a
tie for first place honors.
Title Is Cinched
Delta Chi ran away with El Toro
with a 16-3 score and cinched the
championship of League V. The vic
tory gives Delta Chi an undefeated
place in the running for the pennant.
The game started out much in favor
of El Toro when, in the first inning,
Shurill, Homlvn, and Sutro crossed
the base for runs. But these runs
proved both the first and the last to
be brought in by the club. In the sec
ond half of the first, Delta Chi made
three hits and two runs.
The big surprise of the day came
in the last of the fourth. Hay came to
bat for Delta Chi with two men down.
He made first on a hit, reached third
