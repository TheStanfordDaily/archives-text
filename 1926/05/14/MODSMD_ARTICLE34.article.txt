# No "Quarter" Given

There is 110 race on the athletic program that requires such a combination
of speed and stamina as the grueling quarter-mile dash. To run a good
double furlong, a man must be both fast and strong, and above all he must
have a large portion of that quality so well expressed by the simple four-letter
word —guts.
Probably the three greatest quarter-milers of all time were Maxey Long,
Binga Dismond, and Ted Meredith. All three beat 48 seconds running around
one turn; Long raced 440 yards on a straightaway in 47 flat (Meredith did,
too, but with the aid of a strong wind) and ran the distance around the
Travers Island five-lap track in 47 4-5.
Meredith, whose time of 47 2-5, made at the intercollegiate trames at
Cambridge on May 27, 1916, is accepted as the standard world's record for 440
yards, probably ran more fast quarters, counting his many magnificent relay
performances, than any other runner. I accompanied Ted on an athletic trip
to Norway and Sweden in 1916, and saw him race and beat a relay team com
posed of four Scandinavian school boys in a 400-meter race.
Binga Dismond's record is not so well known. It is not down alongside
of Meredith's because the record was never applied for. It stands as an
intercollegiate conference record, however. The dusky Binga, who is now a
prominent physician in the Harlem district of New York City, set his mark
while a student at the University of Chicago, at Northwestern field, June 13,
1916. Roy Campbell tells me that Binga actually looked around and slackened
his pace before the finish, and should have made even faster time.
Then there was Lon Meyers, who won the national A.A.U. 440-yard run
six years in succession. The distance, in the national championships has
been run in 49 seconds or better only six times in fifty years
