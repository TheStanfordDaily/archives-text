# CAMPUS RESIDENTS STARTLED BY ARMY FLIERS' NIGHT RAID
## 
### 
Campus residents were treated
last night to something of the
kind of an air raid which Paris
and London got regularly during
the war. The main difference was
that there was no shelling and
nothing more dangerous than
flares were dropped.
The show was staged by a com
pany of the Const Artillery, which
will be on the campus for a
month practicing anti-aircraft de
fense, and planes from Crissy
Field, San Francisco.
The plan of the evening was for
the airplane to attempt to get in
close enough to bomb a target
with flares without being detected
by listening devices and search
lights. If the searchlights picked
the plane out flrst, however, the
attack was considered unsuccess
ful. Practice of this sort will prob
ably be seen several nights dur
ing the next few weeks.
