# A 						CAPELLA CHOIR WILL BE PRESENTED IN GYPSY COSTUMES
## 
### 
Monday evening the A Capella
Choir, organized by John Smallman,
will be presented in the Stanford As
sembly hall under the auspices of the
Stanford Glee Club. The organization
will be decidedly different from any
musical group that has appeared on
the campus for some time.
They sing entirely unaccompanied
and from memory as in the best "A
Capella" tradition. They also give all
their concerts with the ftiembers
dressed in attractive and brightly
colored gypsy costumes which are said
to add greatly to the effectiveness of
the ensemble.
John Smallman, who organized the
choir in Los Angeles, has done a nota
ble work already, according to critics.
David B. Usher, writing in the Los
Angeles Express, has given the fol
lowing summary of the value and sig
nificance of the choir: "Smallman has
made a greater contribution to the
musical culture of the Pacific West
in forming this choir than is probably
realized by the public. He has laid
thorough foundations for the noblest
choral traditions, because unaccom
panied singing is the acme of chorus
art from a point of view of perform
ance and repertoire. His vocal ma
terial is nothing short of excellent and
I repeat I would not have believed its
high qualities but for hearing this en
semble in the Mach Motet. Here is the
making of the best chorus I have
heard here and abroad."
A Capella, or the art of singing un
accompanied, relying only on the na
tural beauty and flexibility of the hu
man voice for musical effects, is an
old and noble musical tradition. Not
only are voices of clear and fresh
quality required to get a beautiful en
semble tone, but the performers must
have splendid breath control for the
long sustained notes, and they must be
possessed of an accurate sense of pitch
and the ability to sing exactly on pitch
over long periods of time and with
no outside instrumental aids.
