# FIESTA LAGUNITA TO BE STAGED ON LAKE SIDE TONIGHT
## STARTS AT 8:15 O'CLOCK Kathleen Fitz, Chesterlyn Thomas Have Leads in Bi-Annual Pageant 
### Frank Baker 
Tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the natur
al amphitheatre prepared especially
for the "Romance of Resanoff, the
Russian, and Conchlta," the lights will
rise on a moon-flooded patio of a Span
ish Mission, with a colorful group of
Spanish Senoritas, chic, enticing, who
dance to the strains of music of Old
Spain.
With the greensward of the shores
of Lake Lagunita as their stage, the
dancing girls, under the direction of
Mrs. Ruth Calvin and Adelaide Kelly,
have been rehearsing creative dances
for several weeks in preparation for
the Fiesta. Mrs. Calvin has broken
away from the hidebound traditions of
interpretive work and has created
many original and daring fantasies of
motion.
Mood is the keynote to the work
undertaken in the dances for the
Fiesta. The girls were given the time,
the place, and the mood they were ex
pected to portray, then the music best
suited to each particular feeling was
played. They were told to do as theii
emotions prompted them. Out of these
experiments, the best movements were
selected, and inculcated into rhythmi
cal and harmonious creations. Tht
result is like the song of an old mas
ter, lyrical, emotional, and filled with
vision.
The Dance of the Snowflakes is
nearest to interpretive dancing that
the pageant contains. Here the dancers
are dressed in white costumes spark
ling with tiny silver crystals and
sweep across the stage in the manner
of drifting snow. All the other dances,
except, of course, the more or less
typical Spanish and Italian dances,
have been originally created by the
directors and girls on their own stage.
Miss Kelly, who has directed the
Spanish and Indian dances, has studied
the folk and native dances with great
care, and chose very appropriate and
charming combinations. The swing of
the music, and the colorful costumes,
add materially to these interpreta
tions.
It is a great relief to find that the
directors have not overburdened the
girls with costumes in their dances.
Usually the campus productions have
ruined their esthetic effect by volumi
nous clouds dangling from shoulders,
from elbows, from knees, but the
artistically designed clothes for the
Fiesta are both beautiful and allow for
freedom in dancing.
The finale dance was arranged by
Laura Peocock, as was also the death
dance which she executes herself.
Seemingly coming from nowhere the
black spectre of Death weaves a spell
over the Russian lover, Resanoff, and
he dies, as the black veil descends
over him. Then Death herself is re
vealed, not an ugly, decrepit thing,
but a youthful, fanciful spirit.

Spain.
With the greensward of the shores
of Lake Lagunita as their stage, the
dancing girls, under the direction of
Mrs. Ruth Calvin and Adelaide Kelly,
have been rehearsing creative dances
for several weeks in preparation for
the Fiesta. Mrs. Calvin has broken
away from the hidebound traditions of
interpretive work and has created
many original and daring fantasies of
motion.
Mood is the keynote to the work
undertaken in the dances for the
Fiesta. The girls were given the time,
the place, and the mood they were ex
pected to portray, then the music best
suited to each particular feeling was
played. They were told to do as theii
emotions prompted them. Out of these
experiments, the best movements were
selected, and inculcated into rhythmi
cal and harmonious creations. Tht
result is like the song of an old mas
ter, lyrical, emotional, and filled with
vision.
The Dance of the Snowflakes is
nearest to interpretive dancing that
the pageant contains. Here the dancers
are dressed in white costumes spark
ling with tiny silver crystals and
sweep across the stage in the manner
of drifting snow. All the other dances,
except, of course, the more or less
typical Spanish and Italian dances,
have been originally created by the
directors and girls on their own stage.
Miss Kelly, who has directed the
Spanish and Indian dances, has studied
the folk and native dances with great
care, and chose very appropriate and
charming combinations. The swing of
the music, and the colorful costumes,
add materially to these interpreta
tions.
It is a great relief to find that the
directors have not overburdened the
girls with costumes in their dances.
Usually the campus productions have
ruined their esthetic effect by volumi
nous clouds dangling from shoulders,
from elbows, from knees, but the
artistically designed clothes for the
Fiesta are both beautiful and allow for
freedom in dancing.
The finale dance was arranged by
Laura Peocock, as was also the death
dance which she executes herself.
Seemingly coming from nowhere the
black spectre of Death weaves a spell
over the Russian lover, Resanoff, and
he dies, as the black veil descends
over him. Then Death herself is re
vealed, not an ugly, decrepit thing,
but a youthful, fanciful spirit.
Tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the natur
al amphitheatre prepared especially
for the "Romance of Resanoff, the
Russian, and Conchlta," the lights will
rise on a moon-flooded patio of a Span
ish Mission, with a colorful group of
Spanish Senoritas, chic, enticing, who
dance to the strains of music of Old
Spain.
