# FIESTA LAGUNITA SHOWS GOOD DANCING, PANTOMIME

"The Romance of Resanoff, the Rus
! sian, and Conchita," presented by the
| women of Stanford last Friday at Lake
i Lagunita as their bi-annual spring
fiesta, showed what could be done in
the way of pantomime and dancing
with a group of 160 girls, most of
whom were inexperienced.
The plot, written by Jean Ward, the
selection of the spot for the natural
i stage and its preparation, the general
j grouping of the dances, and the whole
theme, were all happy choices.
! There are few points upon which
; the production can be adversely criti
! cized. The main onfe is that the dances,
taken individually, were a bit too
drawn out, particularly the Indian
Dance and Twilight. Other minor
errors in the dancing were probably
caused bv the unfamiliarity of the
music, which was excellent in itself,
but to which the girls had never be
j fore danced. These, added to the fact
' that the thunder sounded too much

i like the rapid descent of a Ford down
! a rooky road, and that the referee's
j whistle was rather weak, make up the
; visible faults in the Fiesta.
Somehow just the right chord was
touched in making the pageant as
purely creative as possible. Thanks to
I someone, Greek dances and things
! Greek were entirely left alone.
The work of the (lancing directors,
i Mrs. Ruth Calvin, Adelaide Kelly, and
Laura Peocock, is especially to be
commended. They trained a group of
j girls so they could execute their
dances with grace and rhythm.
The work begun by Wilbur Hall in
the general direction of the show was
adequately carried forward by Arthur
Cyril, a former member of the faculty,
who formerly coached dramatics here.
Individual hpnors of the pageant go
to Chesterlyn Thomas as Resanoff,
Kathleen Fitz as Conchita, Laura Peo
cock as Death, and Helen Stewart and
