# FIESTA LAGUNITA SHOWS GOOD DANCING, PANTOMIME
## 
### Frank Baker 
"The Romance of Resanoff, the Rus
! sian, and Conchita," presented by the
| women of Stanford last Friday at Lake
i Lagunita as their bi-annual spring
fiesta, showed what could be done in
the way of pantomime and dancing
with a group of 160 girls, most of
whom were inexperienced.
The plot, written by Jean Ward, the
selection of the spot for the natural
i stage and its preparation, the general
j grouping of the dances, and the whole
theme, were all happy choices.
! There are few points upon which
; the production can be adversely criti
! cized. The main onfe is that the dances,
taken individually, were a bit too
drawn out, particularly the Indian
Dance and Twilight. Other minor
errors in the dancing were probably
caused bv the unfamiliarity of the
music, which was excellent in itself,
but to which the girls had never be
j fore danced. These, added to the fact
' that the thunder sounded too much

i like the rapid descent of a Ford down
! a rooky road, and that the referee's
j whistle was rather weak, make up the
; visible faults in the Fiesta.
Somehow just the right chord was
touched in making the pageant as
purely creative as possible. Thanks to
I someone, Greek dances and things
! Greek were entirely left alone.
The work of the (lancing directors,
i Mrs. Ruth Calvin, Adelaide Kelly, and
Laura Peocock, is especially to be
commended. They trained a group of
j girls so they could execute their
dances with grace and rhythm.
The work begun by Wilbur Hall in
the general direction of the show was
adequately carried forward by Arthur
Cyril, a former member of the faculty,
who formerly coached dramatics here.
Individual hpnors of the pageant go
to Chesterlyn Thomas as Resanoff,
Kathleen Fitz as Conchita, Laura Peo
cock as Death, and Helen Stewart and
I Barbara Eubanks for their duet in
"Twilight." Miss Thomas was luckily
of a height that could handle the part,
and adding to it a certain poise and
dignity, was a splendid Russian cava
lier. Her gestures were smooth and in 1
co-brdination.
Kathleen Fitz had an extremely
pleasing personality and was charm
! ing as a Spanish senorita, though the !
| part was not particularly well suited
Ito her type. She labored under the
| difficulty in her dance of not having j
sufficient time to rehearse, but sur-,
! prised even the directors by her ease
â–  and facility in its execution.
The Death dance, by Miss Peocock.
was a type of dancing that had its i
origin in France, and has been seen
but a few times here. The horribleness
of the black weaving figure held the
audience in suspense until the final
undraping. It was a masterpiece in
creative work. Barbara Eubanks and
Helen Stewart had only a short dance!
together, but they were both dainty i
and graceful in their movements, and j
their nymph-like interpretation made a
distinct impression.
The other members of the cast, Mar- 1
garet Stebbins, Margaret Olson, Mar
garita Espinosa, Elizabeth Doyle, and
Astrid Arnoldson, were well-cast. They
completed a well-rounded pageant.
The sets, though simple to the ex-1
treme, were just what was required for ,
the natural setting of the trees -and
lake. Leslie Kiler added one more I
laurel to his wreath in their construc- j
tion. Harold Todd had a large order J
to fill in giving the proper lighting!
effects on the stage, as the outdoor
work requires totally different effects, j
However, the lighting was the best
the reviewer has seen at Stanford. j
As a final touch, the costuming for
the show was far above par. The j
colors blended and contrasted un
usually well. Patricia Nauman, who
has worked with Chrysella Kiler for i
some time, devoted a great deal of'
energy to getting the proper costumes, j
and to say the least, she was success-1
ful. The filmy costumes for the dancers :
in Twilight, Lightning, etc., were a j
great, improvement over the bulky;
clothing that often adorns the lithe
limbs of the dancers in campus pro-1
ductions.

Because of the theft and mutilation
of the senior canes by the sophomores j
at Northwestern University, there will
be no Sophomore Hop there this
spring.
