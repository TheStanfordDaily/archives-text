# A 						Cappella Choir Presents Musical Program Tonight
## 
### 
Unaccompanied choral singing,
which has been called the highest and
purest form of vocal music, will be
offered this evening in the Stanford
Assembly Hall when the Smallman
A Cappella choir gives a recital under
the auspices of the Stanford Glee Club.
It has been said the possibilities of
the human voice in harmony and mel
ody can be appreciated only in the
work of a highly trained and experi
enced unaccompanied choral group,
such as this one which sings the most
difficult numbers of its large reper
toire entirely from memory.
John Smallman, organizer and pres
ent conductor of the choir, is one of
the foremost authorities on choral
singing in the country. He came to
Los Angeles from Boston where he re
ceived his entire musical training. In
the last six years he has produced
many oratorios and programs with the
Los Angeles Oratorio Society.
His inspiration for the choir was re
ceived from world-famous organiza
tions of a similar nature: the Sistine
Chapel Choir, the Ukrainian National
Chorus, and the St. Olaf Lutheran
Choir. He has given special attention
to the selecting of the clearest and
freshest voices possible. Each one of
the forty members, both male and
female, are highly trained and sing
with precision and exactness of pitch.
Already the Smallman choir has been
favorably compared with the great
organizations after which it was mod
eled.
The singers of the group are dressed
in gaily-colored gypsy costumes, a de
cided innovation in the usual practice
of organizations devoted largely to
singing classical and religious music,
and one which has attracted much
favorable comment, since it greatly
enlivens the appearance of the group.
The repertoire of the A Cappella
choir is a varied one, and though it
contains some of the grandest and
most difficult masterpieces of the me
dieval church music, it also has some
modern works which will be familiar
to many of the listeners. "Annie
Laurie" in the arrangement by O'Hara,
and a negro spiritual of great charm,
"De Sheepfol"" by Webbe, are in
cluded.
"Hymn to Racliael, the Divine," by
Enrico Bossi, is one of the most beau
tiful of the more recent religious com
positions. The older notets, chants, and
chorals which the choir sings in the
authentic manner in which they were
given in the medieval cathedrals, are
among the most inspiring of its pro
gram. The harmony of the voices is
beyond anything else obtainable in
vocal art of any sort.
