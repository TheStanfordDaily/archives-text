# CARDINAL VICTORY IN COAST CONFERENCE MEET POINTS TO CHANCE OF WINNING I.C. 4-A.
## EAST-WEST FOOTBALL CONTRACT CANCELLED BY CONFERENCE ACT Eastern Officials Condemn Commercialism of Pacific Coast Participation 
### 
Cancellation of the contract with
the Tournament of Roses for the an
nual New Years Day East-West foot
ball classic formed the nucleus of de
cisions. made at a meeting of the fac
ulty representatives of the Pacific
Coast Conference held at Palo Alto
Friday evening. Action on proposals
for further limiting participation in
athletics was postponed until the next
meeting of the representatives in De
cember.
The decision of the faculty in break
ing the connection of the conference
with the East-West classic came large
ly as a result of criticism of Eastern
officials that the participation of the
Pacific Coast Conference in the New
Years game gave it too much of a
commercial tinge. Athletic managers
of the various schools in the Confer
ence first made the proposal at their
meeting held Friday afternoon, de
claring that too much pressure was
put upon a university to play the game
as a duty to the conference, rather
than using its own judgment. The ac
tion of the conference, however, does
not prohibit a university from inde
pendently playing for the Tournament
of Roses.
The amendment proposed by Dean
Joel Hildebrand of California that stu
dents receiving any outside financial
help be barred from participation, to
gether with the modification amend
ment advocated by Professor W. B.
Owens of Stanford, was tabled for the
December meeting in Los Angeles.
Boxing and wrestling Avere ruled
out from athletic events and will not
be recognized by the conference, al
though separate schools can schedule
dual contests in these sports.
