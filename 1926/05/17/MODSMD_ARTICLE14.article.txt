# RECOMMEND FUNDS TO ASSIST WORK OF APPOINTMENT OFFICE
## 
### 
That the Appointment Office may re
ceive an endowment soon which will
materially aid it in enlarging its scope
of service, was indicated by a recent
report of an investigating committee
of the Stanford High School Principal's
Club.
The committee's recommendation
for additional funds is based on the
findings that there is need of great
co-ordination between educational in
stitutions and the industries and pro
fessions which graduates enter.
At present the work of the bureau
is confined to assisting self-supporting
students during the academic year and
in the vacation periods, helping gradu
ate students to obtain the maximum of
opportunities, and assisting high
school principals and other school ad
ministrators in securing competent
teachers. The committee felt that
these activities are only a very small
part of the possibilities for service
that this office can render.
At this time the Appointment Office
is receiving as much money as is avail
able in fairness to other departments
of the University. As there is no hope
of help from this quarter in the near
future, the committee recommended
that Stanford High School Principals
Club initiate action to secure sufficient
endowment to insure the extension
and improvement of the office's activi
ties.
