## TWELVE RECORDS FALL Bill Richardson Proves Best On Coast by Defeat of Boyden, Charteris 
### Clif Moore 
Conclusive proof that Stanford's
; track team will finish near the top in
j the, 1.C.4-A. meet at Cambridge was
furnished by the Cardinals' decisive
victory over the best athletes in the
l West at the Pacific Coast Conference
j meet in the stadium Saturday. In the
greatest contest ever staged on the
j coast, Coach Dink Templeton's charges
amassed 49 1-3 points. Their closest
rival, U.S r C., took second place with
41 markers; California was third with
27 1-2; two men gave Montana fourth
honors by scoring 15; Washington fin
ished fifth, with 14; and Washington
State sixth, with 9 5-6.
Twelve Pacific Coast Conference
records went by the boards in Satur
day's meet, and the performances
[ turned in in the three events that
failed to break coast marks were good
[ enough to win a first place in almost
I any meet in the country. Every event
produced marks that compare favor
: ably with any results recorded in the
United States this year.
Gillette Is Hero
In a meet replete with brilliant
J performances and record-breaking re
i suits, the efforts of the two great ath
! letes stand out above all'others. Gil
j lette of Montana perhaps deserves
| more credit than any other competitor
' for the way in which he annexed first
1 places in both the mile and two-mile,
| and set a new coast record in each.
Houser, star weight-tosser of U.S.C.,
with new coast records in the shot-put
and discus, occupies the second highest
niche in the P.C.C. hall of fame.
Lee Barnes, Trojan and Olympics
Games pole-vaulter, broke all Ameri
j can records, intercollegiate or other

i into the ozone, diet Ross, fighting
i Stanford vaulter, showed his great
