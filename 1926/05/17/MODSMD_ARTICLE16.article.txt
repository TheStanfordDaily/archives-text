### Clif Moore 
Conclusive proof that Stanford's
; track team will finish near the top in
j the, 1.C.4-A. meet at Cambridge was
furnished by the Cardinals' decisive
victory over the best athletes in the
l West at the Pacific Coast Conference
j meet in the stadium Saturday. In the
greatest contest ever staged on the
j coast, Coach Dink Templeton's charges
amassed 49 1-3 points. Their closest
rival, U.S r C., took second place with
41 markers; California was third with
27 1-2; two men gave Montana fourth
honors by scoring 15; Washington fin
ished fifth, with 14; and Washington
State sixth, with 9 5-6.
Twelve Pacific Coast Conference
records went by the boards in Satur
day's meet, and the performances
[ turned in in the three events that
failed to break coast marks were good
[ enough to win a first place in almost
I any meet in the country. Every event
produced marks that compare favor
: ably with any results recorded in the
United States this year.
Gillette Is Hero
In a meet replete with brilliant
J performances and record-breaking re
i suits, the efforts of the two great ath
! letes stand out above all'others. Gil
j lette of Montana perhaps deserves
| more credit than any other competitor
' for the way in which he annexed first
1 places in both the mile and two-mile,
| and set a new coast record in each.
Houser, star weight-tosser of U.S.C.,
with new coast records in the shot-put
and discus, occupies the second highest
niche in the P.C.C. hall of fame.
Lee Barnes, Trojan and Olympics
Games pole-vaulter, broke all Ameri
j can records, intercollegiate or other
| wise, by climbing up 13 feet 8 inches
i into the ozone, diet Ross, fighting
i Stanford vaulter, showed his great
i worth as a competitive athlete by plac
i ing second to the U.S.C. champion
i with a leap of 12 feet 6 inches.
Captain Bill Richardson confirmed
the belief that this is the greatest
year in his career by beating out the
three finest half-milers in the country
—Charteris of Washington, Boyden of
California, and Niersbacli of U.S.C. in
one of the most thrilling races of the
day. The Card leader ran in fourth
position until the last corner on the
second lap was reached, and then he
sped by the field to finish ten yards
ahead of Charteris in the record time
of 1 minute 54 2-10 seconds.
Quarter-Miters Cop
Stanford's trio of quarter-mile stars,
Miller, Storie, and Babcock, came
through with their expected one-two
three finish, thereby adding ten points
to the Cardinal total. Miller broke
the old' record with a mark of 49
seconds flat.
Chuck Harlow, while conceded a
first place in the javelin, came through
with a wonderful toss of 201 feet,
1 1-2 inches, a new coast mark that
will probably stand for a long time.
One of the greatest events on the pro
gram was the broad jump, in which
every place-winner broke the coast
record by at least three inches. Bond
shu of California came through with
a great leap of 24 feet 2 1-4 inches,
setting a new mark. Sid Meeks of
Stanford jumped farther than any
Stanford broad-jumper has ever done
before to place second with a mark of
24 feet. Flanagan of Oregon, the for
mer record-holder, placed third with
23 10 7-8, and Dick Macßae took fourth
for Stanford with 23 feet 8 inches.
Bob King came through with his ex
pected victory in the high jump, his
mark of 6 feet 4 3-4 inches rating him
as the class of the coast.
Sweet Beats Barber
Sweet of Montana defeated Barber
of California in a record-breaking run
in the 100-yard dash. The Montana
flash turned in a new mark of 9 7-10
seconds. Barber took the honors in the
220, after Sweet was forced to drop
out at the fifty-yard mark with a pulled
tendon.
The Trojan hurdlers lived up to ad
vance notices in both the low and high
sticks. Dye taking the highs in 14.9,
and Grumbles winning the lows at
24 7-10 seconds. West of Stanford fin
ished behind Reynolds of U.S.C. for
third place in the highs. In the lows
the Cardinal timber-topper led the
field until the third barrier from the
last, when lie lost his stride, allowing
the Trojan star, Meyers of W.S.C., and
Enos of California, to pass him.

Miller, Storie, and Babcock, came
through with their expected one-two
three finish, thereby adding ten points
to the Cardinal total. Miller broke
the old' record with a mark of 49
seconds flat.
Chuck Harlow, while conceded a
first place in the javelin, came through
with a wonderful toss of 201 feet,
1 1-2 inches, a new coast mark that
will probably stand for a long time.
One of the greatest events on the pro
gram was the broad jump, in which
every place-winner broke the coast
record by at least three inches. Bond
shu of California came through with
a great leap of 24 feet 2 1-4 inches,
setting a new mark. Sid Meeks of
Stanford jumped farther than any
Stanford broad-jumper has ever done
before to place second with a mark of
24 feet. Flanagan of Oregon, the for
mer record-holder, placed third with
23 10 7-8, and Dick Macßae took fourth
for Stanford with 23 feet 8 inches.
Bob King came through with his ex
pected victory in the high jump, his
mark of 6 feet 4 3-4 inches rating him
as the class of the coast.
Sweet Beats Barber
Sweet of Montana defeated Barber
of California in a record-breaking run
in the 100-yard dash. The Montana
flash turned in a new mark of 9 7-10
seconds. Barber took the honors in the
220, after Sweet was forced to drop
out at the fifty-yard mark with a pulled
tendon.
The Trojan hurdlers lived up to ad
vance notices in both the low and high
sticks. Dye taking the highs in 14.9,
and Grumbles winning the lows at
24 7-10 seconds. West of Stanford fin
ished behind Reynolds of U.S.C. for
third place in the highs. In the lows
the Cardinal timber-topper led the
field until the third barrier from the
last, when lie lost his stride, allowing
the Trojan star, Meyers of W.S.C., and
Enos of California, to pass him.
Conclusive proof that Stanford's
; track team will finish near the top in
j the, 1.C.4-A. meet at Cambridge was
furnished by the Cardinals' decisive
victory over the best athletes in the
l West at the Pacific Coast Conference
j meet in the stadium Saturday. In the
greatest contest ever staged on the
j coast, Coach Dink Templeton's charges
amassed 49 1-3 points. Their closest
rival, U.S r C., took second place with
41 markers; California was third with
27 1-2; two men gave Montana fourth
honors by scoring 15; Washington fin
ished fifth, with 14; and Washington
State sixth, with 9 5-6.
Twelve Pacific Coast Conference
records went by the boards in Satur
day's meet, and the performances
[ turned in in the three events that
failed to break coast marks were good
[ enough to win a first place in almost
I any meet in the country. Every event
produced marks that compare favor
: ably with any results recorded in the
United States this year.

Twelve Pacific Coast Conference
records went by the boards in Satur
day's meet, and the performances
[ turned in in the three events that
failed to break coast marks were good
[ enough to win a first place in almost
I any meet in the country. Every event
produced marks that compare favor
: ably with any results recorded in the
United States this year.
Gillette Is Hero
In a meet replete with brilliant
J performances and record-breaking re
i suits, the efforts of the two great ath
! letes stand out above all'others. Gil
j lette of Montana perhaps deserves
| more credit than any other competitor
' for the way in which he annexed first
1 places in both the mile and two-mile,
| and set a new coast record in each.
Houser, star weight-tosser of U.S.C.,
with new coast records in the shot-put
and discus, occupies the second highest
niche in the P.C.C. hall of fame.
Lee Barnes, Trojan and Olympics
Games pole-vaulter, broke all Ameri
j can records, intercollegiate or other
| wise, by climbing up 13 feet 8 inches
i into the ozone, diet Ross, fighting
i Stanford vaulter, showed his great
i worth as a competitive athlete by plac
i ing second to the U.S.C. champion
i with a leap of 12 feet 6 inches.
Captain Bill Richardson confirmed
the belief that this is the greatest
year in his career by beating out the
three finest half-milers in the country
—Charteris of Washington, Boyden of
California, and Niersbacli of U.S.C. in
one of the most thrilling races of the
day. The Card leader ran in fourth
position until the last corner on the
second lap was reached, and then he
sped by the field to finish ten yards
ahead of Charteris in the record time
of 1 minute 54 2-10 seconds.
Quarter-Miters Cop
Stanford's trio of quarter-mile stars,
Miller, Storie, and Babcock, came
through with their expected one-two
three finish, thereby adding ten points
to the Cardinal total. Miller broke
the old' record with a mark of 49
seconds flat.
Chuck Harlow, while conceded a
first place in the javelin, came through
with a wonderful toss of 201 feet,
1 1-2 inches, a new coast mark that
will probably stand for a long time.
One of the greatest events on the pro
gram was the broad jump, in which
every place-winner broke the coast
record by at least three inches. Bond
shu of California came through with
a great leap of 24 feet 2 1-4 inches,
setting a new mark. Sid Meeks of
Stanford jumped farther than any
Stanford broad-jumper has ever done
before to place second with a mark of
24 feet. Flanagan of Oregon, the for
mer record-holder, placed third with
23 10 7-8, and Dick Macßae took fourth
for Stanford with 23 feet 8 inches.
Bob King came through with his ex
pected victory in the high jump, his
mark of 6 feet 4 3-4 inches rating him
as the class of the coast.
Sweet Beats Barber
Sweet of Montana defeated Barber
of California in a record-breaking run
in the 100-yard dash. The Montana
flash turned in a new mark of 9 7-10
seconds. Barber took the honors in the
220, after Sweet was forced to drop
out at the fifty-yard mark with a pulled
tendon.
The Trojan hurdlers lived up to ad
vance notices in both the low and high
sticks. Dye taking the highs in 14.9,
and Grumbles winning the lows at
24 7-10 seconds. West of Stanford fin
ished behind Reynolds of U.S.C. for
third place in the highs. In the lows
the Cardinal timber-topper led the
field until the third barrier from the
last, when lie lost his stride, allowing
the Trojan star, Meyers of W.S.C., and
Enos of California, to pass him.
