# R. L. Templeton, Conspirator
## 
### 
One is tempted to charge Robert Lyman Templeton with conspiracy
after viewing the recent Pacific Coast conference meet. Any man who
will take fourteen men and do with them what Templeton has done in the
last two months and against the odds which were in favor of a southern
school at that time, is certainly indictable for attempting to gather all the
sugar for himself.
And the strange (!) aspect of the whole matter is that Stanford is
whole-heartedly behind said Templeton in his heinous crime. He is cer
tainly in a position now and forever to worthily accept the praise that is
being bestowed upon him by the Coast, the State, and the University. We
modestly wonder if any coach in the United States can show a record as
comparatively good as Templeton's, considering his few years of service
as the Cardinal track mentor. Others may have opened the doors of their
respective institutions occasionally in the past twenty years to show to the
world some great individual athlete, but Templeton has consistently in six
years given his rivals something to worry about in the matter of both teams
and individuals. And we do feel that we are heaping it up when we say
that Templeton should be ranked among the best in these United States.
Saturday he will depart for the eastern coast with his squad of thirteen
champions. If there is anything in past performances and the infallible
(?) dope of sports writers, the Cardinal colors should be up in the lead
and out o' the mob when the final points are counted in the I.C.A.A.A.A.
meet. In fact, if there is any justice in superstition, the number thirteen
will add a couple of feet to the pole-vault, to the discus, and even slash a
second or so off of Captain Richardson's time in the half-mile.
lint whether "Dink" is depending on Lady Fortune or.downright
muscle and skill, he will have the best wishes of the University with him.
