"Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away."
The man who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel slipped on an orange
peel the other day and died. The world's strongest man recently died of
blood poisoning contracted by sitting on a tack. A European monarch died
last year from the scratch of a pet monkey. Alexander the Great, who
sighed for other worlds to conquer, succumbed to a commonplace fever.
An explorer who has dared the frozen expanses of the North with im
punity was recently reported dying of pneumonia. A famous steeple
jack and human fly fell from an apple tree last year and broke his neck. A
record parachute-jumper fell oil his back porch and broke both legs.
All of which, will go a long way toward making us feel less humiliated
the next time we are run over by an automobile.

THE BLEACHER STUNTS WHICH WERE STAGED at the
Conference meet were declared by those who could see them to be letter
perfect. The Rally Committee members who arranged the display deserve
considerable credit; but it was regretable that, because some undergradu
ates would not cooperate, it was necessary to secure alumni aid in filling
the section.
NOW THAT THE SPORT SEASON IS PRACTICALLY closed
the campus faces an interesting week of political campaigning. Nomina
tions officially opened today and the Spring election will be held next
Tuesday.
THE DAILY PALO ALTO EDITORIAL STAFF will meet in the
office at 1 o'clock tomorrow to elect an editor for next year.
Interesting speciman of journalistic inaccuracy from the estimable
Harvard Crimson:
"Only one other man besides the immortal Meredith lias run an I.C.A.A.A.A.
half-mile faster than did Captain Richardson of California in his team's recent meet
against Stanford."
Great versatility overtakes the Northwest. The O.A.C. Daily
Barometer:
"Asa part of the annual Military tournament a parachute jump will he made by
Lieutenant Van Ault. He is an accomplished jumper and a musician. He drops off
at two thousand feet and plays the 'Star Spangled Banner' on his saxophone en route
to the earth."
