### Monroe Eaton 
AN UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE
Dear Papa:
Well, the other day we had that Labor Day at the Convalescent Home I
told you about in my last. Believe me, it was a loUof fun. They gave us frosh
hoes, picks, axes, and whatnot, and told us to go to it.
Well, after working steadily for five minutes I looked up and found I was ;
alone; the other fellows were over by the house queening with the women.
But, being a woman-hater, I kept right on working. It kind of made me sore,
though, because when the call for eats came, these snakes et al rushed up i
to the tables, and by the time my turn came around there wasn't much left.
Gee, queening must create an awfully good appetite. All I got was one plate,
some beans, a bone (somebody had already gnawed the meat off), one dried
pickle and a piece of ham out of a ham samlwich.
Well, they didn't give me any spoon so I had to eat the beans with my'j
fingers. Some women sitting next to me remarked that my manners was |
awful to eat beans that way when everybody knows they should be eaten with
a knife —but I was not mad.
Well, when I finished the beans, I went over and stood fifteen minutes in
line for ice cream. When rny turn came they had just run out. But hell,
I wasn't mad. So then I stood for twenty minutes more in line for some
coffee. When my turn came the coffee had just run out. But I wasn't mad.
Well, by the time I got over to where the show was going to be, all the !
good places were gone, and I had to climb onto some guy's back to see at all.
They said the show was going to be about some Greek tragedies or something.
Personally, it looked like bum tragedy to me! why, it was comedy—they even j
showed us what a Greek baby looked like. It looked like any other baby '
except that its hair was red.
Well, the show concluded the evening's performance as all the women
had to report to rehearse for a siesta or something. I rode home on the
bumper of some guy's Ford —and went to bed tired but happy.
Well, now, I ain't feeling so good. There are six raw blisters on each of
my hands —my back is sprained, and I can't get the stickers out of my sox !
(the other pair is being cleaned). So, Thursday and Friday I cut all my i
classes to rest up.
Well, that's about all, I guess; will write again soon.

good places were gone, and I had to climb onto some guy's back to see at all.
They said the show was going to be about some Greek tragedies or something.
Personally, it looked like bum tragedy to me! why, it was comedy—they even j
showed us what a Greek baby looked like. It looked like any other baby '
except that its hair was red.
Well, the show concluded the evening's performance as all the women
had to report to rehearse for a siesta or something. I rode home on the
bumper of some guy's Ford —and went to bed tired but happy.
Well, now, I ain't feeling so good. There are six raw blisters on each of
my hands —my back is sprained, and I can't get the stickers out of my sox !
(the other pair is being cleaned). So, Thursday and Friday I cut all my i
classes to rest up.
Well, that's about all, I guess; will write again soon.

AN UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE
Dear Papa:
Well, the other day we had that Labor Day at the Convalescent Home I
told you about in my last. Believe me, it was a loUof fun. They gave us frosh
hoes, picks, axes, and whatnot, and told us to go to it.
Well, after working steadily for five minutes I looked up and found I was ;
alone; the other fellows were over by the house queening with the women.
But, being a woman-hater, I kept right on working. It kind of made me sore,
though, because when the call for eats came, these snakes et al rushed up i
to the tables, and by the time my turn came around there wasn't much left.
Gee, queening must create an awfully good appetite. All I got was one plate,
some beans, a bone (somebody had already gnawed the meat off), one dried
pickle and a piece of ham out of a ham samlwich.
Well, they didn't give me any spoon so I had to eat the beans with my'j
fingers. Some women sitting next to me remarked that my manners was |
awful to eat beans that way when everybody knows they should be eaten with
a knife —but I was not mad.
Well, when I finished the beans, I went over and stood fifteen minutes in
line for ice cream. When rny turn came they had just run out. But hell,
I wasn't mad. So then I stood for twenty minutes more in line for some
coffee. When my turn came the coffee had just run out. But I wasn't mad.
Well, by the time I got over to where the show was going to be, all the !
good places were gone, and I had to climb onto some guy's back to see at all.
They said the show was going to be about some Greek tragedies or something.
Personally, it looked like bum tragedy to me! why, it was comedy—they even j
showed us what a Greek baby looked like. It looked like any other baby '
except that its hair was red.
Well, the show concluded the evening's performance as all the women
had to report to rehearse for a siesta or something. I rode home on the
bumper of some guy's Ford —and went to bed tired but happy.
Well, now, I ain't feeling so good. There are six raw blisters on each of
