## MUCH TIRE TROUBLE DUE ONLY TO POOR WHEEL ADJUSTMENT Uneven Rolling Motion Is Hard on Tires, Resulting In Excessive Wear 
### 
Much of the tire trouble that is
blamed on defective tires is due to
wheel misalignment. According to a
story released by O'Meara Tire Ser
vice, local dealers for the Mohawk
tires , many tires wear out that would
run for miles if the wheels were kept
111 the proper shape.
The wheels of your car are built to
give a true rolling motion to the tire.
When they do not roll true you will
find your tires wear unevenly. A
broken bearing, a bent axle, a loose
rim will cause the wheel or tire to be
out of alignment. Sometimes in mount
ing the rim one lug is drawn down
tighter than another, this will also
cause misalignment of the tire. In time
driving will often loosen up the steer
ing mechanism producing wheel wob
ble. Excessive weights, broken bear
ings, sudden application of brakes
causing displacement of springs also
have a tendency to throw rear wheels
out of line. Brakes poorly adjusted,
drums or brake drums out-of-round
will cause uneven wear on tires.
Can you conceive of dragging your
tires wit hthe full weight of your car
on them, 174 feet in every mile? This
is precisely what takes place with a
tire one inch out of line. You will be
surprised to note the many cars that
have wheels out of line.
