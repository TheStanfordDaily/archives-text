The female of the species who drives
an automobile in California is not more
deadly than the male, despite Kipling's
j findings.
Will H. Marsh, chief of the division
of motor vehicles, today pointed to
| his records to prove that women
j drivers have fewer accidents and are
more careful than men.
1 Neither is the urge for speed so
prevalent among women, Marsh finds,
■ notwithstanding all that has been said
; and written about jazzmania and the
i tendencies of the present generation
to live at a fast pace.
j "Women are naturally more cau

j tious," said the motor vehicle chief.
I "They make up for their lack of knowl
j edge about motors by taking fewer
| chances, and if they don't always give
I (lie correct hand signal at least they
give some sort of signal, which is
I more than hundreds of men do.
"They are more careful at crossings
' and have more respect for dangerous
i turves. In short, they display more ;
horse-sense on the average than men."
The number of women driving is in- j
! creasing at a fast rate, Marsh added, j
Although only about 15 per cent of all
I California drivers are women nearly j
; one-third of the applications received j
i for new cards are filed by women.
