### 
i The hardest part of a car to keep
; new and glossy is the motor hood. It's
; the first to grow dull, to check, and to
peel. The terrific temperature changes
soon mar the finish. Murcote, a new
I refinishing process that will keep the
hood and the rest of the car unmarred
after countless days of engine heat, of
driving rain, and blistering sun, is
being used now by the Independent
j Auto Lacquer Enamel Company of
Palo Alto.

Unlike all ordinary finishes, after
the ground work is prepared all finish
ing coats of this astonishing new pro

j cess—Murcote —are sprayed on in one
day by special air-spraying equipment.
Each coat as it is sprayed on, amal
gamates and becomes part of all the
others, forming one dense, solid
sheathing of glossy beauty. A finish
seemingly as soft as velvet yet with I
the tough suppleness of sword steel, j
Heat, wind, sleet, rain cannot mar the |
gloss.
