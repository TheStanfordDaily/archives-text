# Women's Hockey Game Ends in 3 to 3 Tie
## 
### 
In an indiscriminately good game,
which ended in a 3 to 3 tie, the All-
Star hockey team and a graduate team
met Saturday morning as part of the
University Day program.
The game was work with slow play,
as it is the only game to he played
this spring, but there were some long
runs and hard playing that helped
make the game interesting. Two of the
three goals for the undergraduates were 1
made by Carolyn Shepherd, halfback.
Charlotte Lovekin, left wing, making
the other goal. Carol Davis Buttrey and
Alida Israel scored for the graduates.
Between halves the "S" society,
representing the undergraduates, and
the graduates both put on stunts.
