j illustrated lecture to be given by Rob-
I ert V. Anderson, '06, in the Little
j Theatre at 7:30 o'clock Tuesday eve

' spending the remainder of his time
doing independent research work.
During the past twelve years he has
been geologist for S. Pearson and Son,

The speaker made his first trip
j around the world the year before he
graduated, taking extensive walking
j trips through Japan for geological pur
poses. Afterwards he wrote papers 011
the great volcano and contributed an
; article to the Popular Science Month
ly, giving translations of the Japanese
accounts of the first discovery of
Japan by Europeans.
Soon after his graduation Anderson
joined the United States Geological
Survey, remaining with the govern
ment until 1913. Upon his resignation
from the Survey he became geologist
, for S. Pearson and Son, Ltd., and in
| connection with this company has trav
! eled in South America, China, North
j Africa, and Europe.
Drilled in Algeria
The greater part of the year 1923
1 Anderson spent in Algeria, where his
' company was conducting drilling oper
ations. While there he was able to
spend most of his time in detailed
geological studies with a view to com
pleting the large amount of geological
information which the company had
obtained during several years in that
country.
Anderson has conducted several
earthquake studies starting with his
graduation from Stanford "by the
j earthquake" of 1906. Like other Stan
ford geologists, he spent some weeks
I making a detailed study of the effects
of the earthquake and the movements
that took place in the coast ranges.
The results of these investigations
I were published in the volumes issued
' by the Carnegie Institution covering
the joint studies of the California
I earthquake.
