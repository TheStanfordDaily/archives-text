In an extra game held last Saturday
morning to decide the tie for honors
in the intramural baseball champion
ship race of League IV, Breakers de
feated Alpha Kappa Lambda, 7-4, in
five innings of good ball played on
the varsity diamond, and thus took the
tie. The game was shortened from the
usual seven innings by mutual agree
ment.
Only once, in the fourth, was Rabbit
George, Breakers twirler, actually
threatened, and at that time he tight
ened and pulled himself out of a seri
ous hole with a series of fast, well
grooved deliveries that stumped the
A.K.L. batters after one run had been
scored. George dealt out seven strike
outs in five innings—one to every third
batter.
Breakers Start Early
Breakers were up first and started
with a vengeance. Vincenti connected
with the first ball pitched for a triple.
Bailard then hit viciously, and was
safe at first, while Vincenti scored.
Patterson hit, and then George's bingle
scored the two. In the second Mitchell
and Vincenti tallied on some poorly
judged throws by the A.K.L. infield.
Mugs Mitchell singled in the fourth,
and when Dawson let the ball roll be
tween his legs, the batter stretched
his hit into a home run. Vincenti sing
led, but was caught in a pickle between
second and third a few minutes later
as a result of poor judgment in base
running. Bailard made the last Breaker
score on a well-placed hit by Patterson.
In the fifth inning Cornell tightened
and shut out the Breakers, one-two
three.
Miller was high scorer for A.K.L.,
with runs in the first and third. Daw
son also scored in the third inning on
Cornell's hit. Kellogg, who played a
stellar game at first base, crossed the
plate in the fourth on a clean single
by. Mansfield. George allowed the
A.K.L.'s but three hits, while Cornell
was tapped for eight by the Breakers.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon won the cham
pionship of League VII Friday after
noon by crowding out Chi Psi in an
eight-inning game 7-6. Besides giving
the placque to S.A.E., the game sets a
recprd for longevity by lasting from
4:30 to 7 o'clock in the evening. The
winning run which broke the seventh
inning tie was brought in by La Hue,
Sig Alph pitcher.
The first inning belongs to S.A.E.
La Hue led off with a three-base hit,
and landed home on a short base-line
hit by Hayes. King, Chi Psi mounds
man, stopped further batting display
by three fan-outs. La Itue, in turn, did
even better by laying away the three
Chi Psi batters in regular order.
The pitching duel continued into the
second, S.A.E. getting no farther than
first. La Rue weakened at this point
and let two men on bases by body
hits, one of which succeeded in reach
ing home for the first Chi Psi run.
Alpha Sig scored in the third. The
fifth inning gave S.A.E. two more
runs. The sixth, however, was the cru
cial point in the game. La Rue and
McDermott scored runs for their
team. Chi Psi, facing a handicap of
four runs, made good on some poor
balls by La Rue and evened the score.
Sandwiek, Dunbar, Russ, and Ankele
accounted for the tallies.
Both pitchers held the seventh down
to practically shutout ball. In the extra
inning, La Rue, making his fifth run
of the day, broke the tie and won the
game.

second, S.A.E. getting no farther than
first. La Rue weakened at this point
and let two men on bases by body
hits, one of which succeeded in reach

fifth inning gave S.A.E. two more
runs. The sixth, however, was the cru
