In an extra game held last Saturday
morning to decide the tie for honors
in the intramural baseball champion
ship race of League IV, Breakers de
feated Alpha Kappa Lambda, 7-4, in
five innings of good ball played on
the varsity diamond, and thus took the
tie. The game was shortened from the
usual seven innings by mutual agree

Only once, in the fourth, was Rabbit
George, Breakers twirler, actually
threatened, and at that time he tight
ened and pulled himself out of a seri
ous hole with a series of fast, well
grooved deliveries that stumped the
A.K.L. batters after one run had been
scored. George dealt out seven strike
outs in five innings—one to every third
batter.
Breakers Start Early
Breakers were up first and started
with a vengeance. Vincenti connected
with the first ball pitched for a triple.
Bailard then hit viciously, and was
safe at first, while Vincenti scored.
Patterson hit, and then George's bingle
scored the two. In the second Mitchell
and Vincenti tallied on some poorly
judged throws by the A.K.L. infield.
Mugs Mitchell singled in the fourth,
and when Dawson let the ball roll be
tween his legs, the batter stretched
his hit into a home run. Vincenti sing
led, but was caught in a pickle between
second and third a few minutes later
as a result of poor judgment in base
running. Bailard made the last Breaker
score on a well-placed hit by Patterson.
In the fifth inning Cornell tightened
and shut out the Breakers, one-two
three.
Miller was high scorer for A.K.L.,
with runs in the first and third. Daw
son also scored in the third inning on
