about the Bond Business
THERE is a great deal of misinformation
among college men concerning the bond
business. Some think it is an easy, quick way to
earnings. Others underestimate its possibil
ities. The truth lies in between.
Businesses differ in the kinds of ability they
require. Some men who would succeed in one line
of business would only rut themselves in others.
We discuss these things frankly with college
men who are interested in entering the bond busi
ness—whether they are undergraduates or men
who are not satisfied with the work they have
taken up since leaving college.
Every man we employ is given several months'
training, with pay,in our bond school before being
assigned to actual work. This serves to give the
man the best chance to succeed — and it also
protects our clientele from unsatisfactory service.
If Ton Are Interested
in the bond business as a vocation, we shall be glad
to send you our pamphlet giving useful information.
