For three days only—a spectacu
lar special Paramount production
—a great sea thriller made right.
Miss everything else but see
"SEA HORSES"
Directed by Allan Dwan with
Florence Vidor and Jack Holt,
and a big all-star supporting cast.
This, we assure you, is no mere
"movie," but a spectacular spe
cial with all that the word im
plies. A stirring screen version
of Francis Brett Young's grip
ping novel, which will amaze you
with its cyclonic action, drama,
and thrills on land and sea.
