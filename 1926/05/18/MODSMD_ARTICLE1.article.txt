The Kappa Sigma-El Tigre play-off
game of the intramural baseball cham
pionship series was forced to an extra
inning yesterday, the Kappa Sigs win
ning at the end of the eighth, 14-13.
El Tigre apparently had the contest
on ice, with a lead of 11 to 9, when
Parish and Newkirk brought in runs
for the winners in the seventh, tying
the score 11-all and paving the way
for three tallies and victory for Kappa
Sigma in the eighth.
El Tigre started with five runs in
the first, scored by Taylor, Hunter,
iStockbridge, Brown, and Linneman.
Kappa Sigma retaliated in the second
â€¢when Southworth, Parish, Newkirk,
Wolf, and Moore crossed the plate.
Taylor tallied for El Tigre in the same
inning, leaving the balance of the
score in favor of the club team, 6-5.
Kappa Sigs Take Lead
Shipkey, Moore, Stevens, and South
worth gained what looked to be a sure
lead for Kappa Sig in the fourth, but
El Tigre came back with four more
tallies and in the sixth increased their
lead by one when Prisinzano brought
in a run.
Parish's and Newkirk's contributions
in the seventh deadlocked the score.
Parwell came to bat in the extra in
ning. hit and scored later when South
worth doubled. Newkirk doubled,
bringing in Southworth, and Conover's
sacrifice scored Newkirk.
El Tigre went to bat faced with the
necessity of making at least three
runs, but Moore, Kappa Sig twirler,
held the club batters, allowing only
Stockbridge, with a double, and James
Prisinzano, who tripled, to score.
Serra Gets Breaks
Junipero Serra Club benefited con
sistently by favorable breaks to win
4-3 from the Betas.
Bill Negus pitched for the winners
in place of Prank Harold, who was out
with an injured finger, and although
he allowed a quantity of hits, received
good support and kept the Betas under
control until the last of the seventh.
But at this point, with Mannoccir and
Herrington on third and second and
none out, Harold was called into the
box. He fanned Poster and Pallette
and Mannoccir was tagged wtien, in
desperation, he tried to steal home,
: with the ball in Catcher Scherer's
hand. This ended the only rally in
! which the Betas threatened the club
team.
Betas Threaten
The sixth was the first good inning
for the losers, for Pallette and Watt
' crossed the plate in that frame, while
Lewis scored the last run of the game
lin the seventh. The Betas hit well,
! connecting with the ball no less than
j twenty times, but Junipero Serra had
too fast an infield and too accurate an
outfield to allow this hitting to count
i for as much as the twelve gentle taps
they themselves succeeded in getting
from Kissinger, fraternity twirler.
Junipero Serra started its attack in
the second. Zipfel singled, Naumes
j struck out, Harold hit, and Zipfel
| wormed his way around the bases to
! score on errors. Harold went around
i by the ?ame method in the fourth, and
; Scherer and Negus scored in the fifth
| on Cullinan's well-placed single.
The game was not without its hu
morous side. Creagh, Serra third-base
man, cartwheeled across the ditch
nearby the diamond with regularity
in attempting to catch foul flies, and
[both teams kept up a babel of base
ball chatter.
By virtue of yesterday's victory,
Junipero Serra will enter the semi
final play-offs Wednesday in a game
with Kappa Sigma.
S.A.E. Downs Breakers
With the help of a few hits, and
some last-minute pitching by La Rue,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon managed to pull
J itself into the semi-finals of intramural
baseball yesterday by defeating Break
ers 5-3. A home run by MacDermott
with Keyes and La Hue on bases, in
i the first, was the outstanding point of
: the scoring.
! La Rue, pitching for S.A.E., started
\ the game off by letting Breakers bring
|in a run from three walks, but re
deemed himself by striking out the
i other three batters. Following MacDer
| mott's home run of the same inning,
! 'he Row squad was in a fair way to
make more runs until batting stopped
with three fans.
The second inning was a succession
of fans. Dobson got on first with a
walk, but was put out on third by a
fast throw from MacDermott. S.A.E.
failed to reach first base.
Breakers Lack Punch
Breakers lost a wonderful oppor
tunity to gain the lead in the third
when, with three men on bases, George
i fanned and Trombetta flied out. Ander
son, with a single, brought in MacDer-
I mott for another S.A.E. marker.
I The fifth brought in two runs for

Breakers. Trombetta, George, and Pat
terson figured in the scoring. Breakers
again lost an opportunity to win in the
following inning, when a third fan
was made with three on bases. La Rue
showed his ability to hold down the
batting in crucial points.
Shumaker scored the last run for
S.A.E. in the sixth. Breakers made a
final threat in the seventh, but was
not quite able to put over a winning
hit against La Rue's fast pitching.
One run was made by George, and
when the last batter fanned there were
two men waiting on bases for an op
portunity to come home and tie the
score.
Semi-final play-offs tomorrow are:
Junipero Serra Club vs. Kappa Sigma;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon vs. Delta Chi.
