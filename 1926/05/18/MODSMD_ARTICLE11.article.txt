# WESTERN SCHOOLS PLAN TRACK MEET REPLACING P.C.C.
## Conference Officials Act to Make Eastern Journey Unnecessary 
### 
Under a new ruling by officials of
the Pacific Coast Conference the meet
last Saturday at the stadium was the
last meet of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence track teams as such. However,
the representatives of the various
schools have outlined a new plan in
which all colleges west of the Rockies
will be eligible to compete in the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiates, as the
new meet will be termed.
This action was taken in order to
do away with the annual trip to the
East now required of Western teams
if they wish to compete in meets of
national importance, the I.C.A.A.A.A.
or the National Intercollegiates. The
members of the meeting who outlined
the plan consider that the meet will
rival any other in the United States,
considering the fact that so many
marks were set by the few colleges
competing last Saturday.
The first of these meets will be held
in Los Angeles, under the auspices of
the University of Southern California,
sometime during the first, second, and
third weeks of June, 1927. The north
ern section of the conference will con
tinue to hold a separate sectional meet,
the date having already been set for
June 27, 1927, and the place being
Corvallis, Oregon.
The annual conference champion
ships were abandoned because they
would be superfluous if an intercolle
giate meet were held and also because
northern and southern schools affili
ated with the conference found it dif
ficult to arrive at a satisfactory date
for their holding, northern institutions
preferring a later date than California
teams because of the later arrival of
good weather in the Northwest.
