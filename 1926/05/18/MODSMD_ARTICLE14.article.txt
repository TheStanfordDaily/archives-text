# Stately Old Grad Returns Horseless Buggy Arrives Speeds Past Campus Houses
## 
### 
An old grad, Maxwell, '02, was a
visitor on the campus yesterday. But
this particular veteran is not a Stan
for eiffcineer or an "Econ" major; it
is a horseless carriage of the heydey
days when Palm Drive seldom saw a
speed greater than fifteen miles an
hour. Two enterprising freshmen
resurrected the old vehicle and drove
it up the Row yesterday at a stately
pace. â€¢
The model includes four wheels,
rubber-tired, two lanterns, a receding
hood, and a gas tank. Its kind flour
ished during the butterfly waist-hoop
skirt period. The specimen boasts two
speeds, forward, low and high.
