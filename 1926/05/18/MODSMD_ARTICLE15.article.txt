# JUNIORS BEAT 1928 WATER POLO SQUAD FOR CLASS HONORS
## Diminutive Distance Flash Scores Both Tallies For Victors 
### 
In a hard-fought game the junior
water polo team defeated the sopho
more seven and won the interclass
championship yesterday afternoon in
Encina Pool. The contest was much
closer than the 2 to 0 score would in
dicate, and almost until the final
whistle was blown there was still a
chance that the '28 mermen would be
able to tie or defeat the upperclass
players.
One goal was made in the first of the
two five-minute halves and the other
in the second. Carl Stevenson, varsity
distance swimmer, was the only scorer
of the game, tossing both shots for
the juniors.
Ward Poulsen, varsity goal guard,
play a strong game as goal guard for
'27, and stopped all attempts that the
sophomores were able to make.
, '27 Takes Interclass
As a result of yesterday's game the
juniors win the interclass title with
sophomores second, seniors third, and
freshmen fourth. In the preliminary
games held last Tuesday, the sopho
mores trimmed the freshmen 4 to 0'
and the juniors cleaned the seniors to
the tune of 3 to 0. The fact that the
juniors were able to get one goal less
from the sophomores than from the
sniors clinches the claim of '28 to the
title of runner-up in interclass water
polo.
For the first few minutes of the first
half neither side could register and
it looked as though the match might
end in a scoreless tie. The ball went
from one team to another constantly.
A goal for the sopohores was threat
ened but once, when Danford, '28 for
ward, tossed the ball to Klein whose
shot fell short.
The juniors got the sphere and
passed back and forth until Stevenson,
playing near the goal, had an opening,
and tossed it into a corner, past
Smith, '28 goal guard. The half ended
immediately afterward.
1928 Misses
Sophomores seemed on the verge of
a point in the second half when their
player, Colin Smith, got away for a
dribble toward the opposing frame,
with 110 one around him. No tally was
registered. Carl Stevenson got another
one through for the upperclassmen
} about the middle of the period. A slow
j easy lob from him went into the cor
ner of the frame before it could be
stopped.
The junior lineup was: forwards,
Art Stewart, Phil Brooks; guards, Rod
Ward, Ken Graham, Bill Brunner;
goal guard, A1 Christiansen.
The sophomores took the water as
follows: forwards, Herb Klein, Bill
Danford, Bob Lilly; guards, Kryne van
den Akker, Harry Maltby, Colin Smith;
goal guard, Dixon Smith. Later Bob
Harris was substituted at center back
and van den Akker moved up to take
Danford's place as forward.
