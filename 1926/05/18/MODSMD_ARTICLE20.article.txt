Xo sir. For good clean fun, there is nothing to compare with a good
old fire on a warm spring evening.
Where do we find such jovial good humor? Where do we get such a
golden opportunity to laugh at the other fellow's misfortune? Let us be
specific. Let us consider a few classic incidents.
Do you remember when the Deke house burned, and one of the
brothers threw the typewriter out.of the window and carried the mattress
downstairs? Or when the women's boathouse burned and four doughty
fire fighters, led by Eddy Lamb raced toward the blaze carrying the nozzle
of the hose? And twenty-odd pa jama-clad figures leaped simultaneously
on that same hose, bringing the fire fighters down, on the seats of their
trou' in approved Mack Sennett fashion?
Or do you remember at the Sigma Chi fire when an ambitious hero, en
deavoring to save the picture of the University's chief executive, threw it
off of the roof, only to see it smash to bits on the sidewalk.
And then yesterday afternoon, when perspiring Fiji's searching for a
blaze, with bare hands, frantically tore a four-foot hole in a perfectly good
roof, only to have the red ha*** and grinning face of the senior president
thrust through the aperature. '
No sir, for good clean fun, there is nothing to compare with a good old
fire on a warm spring evening.
Skyrocket! Chief Dugan!

THE STUDENT BODY WILL AGAIN ballot on the proposition
of electing captains of athletic teams. The new proposal is to do away
with captains entirely. The Daily invites students to use its columns to
express their opinion on the subject. Contributions should be signed and
limited to 200 words. The names of the authors will be withheld from
publication if so desired.
