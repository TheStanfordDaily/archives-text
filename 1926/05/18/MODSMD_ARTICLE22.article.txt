Lay off of that hot engines course!
The senior engineer doth cry,
As from the laboratory bleak
He staggers forth with bloodshot eye.
The econ punks have troubles, too —
Accounting most times hits them square.
When columns fail to balance right
The course is often flunked right there.
The chemist now his mournful cry
'Gainst quant analysis doth raise,
He doesn't mind five afternoons
Of work, but does mind Saturdays.
Law majors in their library
With towels 'round their aching brows,
Sit busy far into the night
To justly settle legal rows.
The other schools have studies, too,
That give the students silver hair;
All claim their course is much too hard—
To have to work so is not fair!
And thus you see, no matter what
Your major subject's all about,
You still will have to work like hell;
Therefore you might as well flunk out. —F.T.M.

But for John Phelps, 09, the following little gem might have sparkled more or
less unnoticed in the Classified Ad section of the Daily
In introducing this classic ad, John suggests that, should it bear fruit, the gentle
men who fills the qualifications be signed up for the varsity.
"For Rent—Unabused Tuxedo with good reputation, desires new owner who
measures thirty-six or thirty-eight through the chest. Priced most attractively for
cash customers. Write—Hamilton Avenue, Palo Alto."

Furthermore, Mr. Phelps writes, he would have sent the ad to the Literary Digest,
but for fear that some scout would sign the prospect up for U.S.C.'s "Blundering
Herd."

But where, John, did you get the idea that any of the "Blundering Herd" would
read the Literary Digest?

Stanford, May 17 (By Accelerated Press) —Two fires both of unknown origin,
have occurred in fraternity houses on this campus in the past week.
In the first, the Sigma Chi House was only half burned, while in the second, the
property loss was enormous, the front pillar on the Fiji porch being severely scorched.
The administration has announced that the Sigma Chi House will he rebuilt ex
actly as it was. A slight delay in this program has been occasioned, however, pend
ing arrangements with the Smithsonian Institute for the services of an ancient au
thority on eighteenth century architecture.

But where, John, did you get the idea that any of the "Blundering Herd" would

Stanford, May 17 (By Accelerated Press) —Two fires both of unknown origin,
have occurred in fraternity houses on this campus in the past week.
In the first, the Sigma Chi House was only half burned, while in the second, the
property loss was enormous, the front pillar on the Fiji porch being severely scorched.
The administration has announced that the Sigma Chi House will he rebuilt ex
actly as it was. A slight delay in this program has been occasioned, however, pend
ing arrangements with the Smithsonian Institute for the services of an ancient au
thority on eighteenth century architecture.
