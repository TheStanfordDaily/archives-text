Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, who is a

made the following „ statement con
cerning the concerts:
"Human history shows that, music
and the fine arts come to full flower
where there is a virile people living in
a region with beautiful surroundings
and a moderate agreeable climate.
Everything seems to be set for such
a development in the San Francisco
Bay region. The growing appreciation
of music, the increasing beauty in our
surroundings, all indicate the advance
which we are to make in these direc
tions. The development by the Phil
'harmonic Society of San Mateo County
of an interest in open-air symphony
music is, it seems Ho me, of much
significance. These concerts will not
only give much pleasure, but will en
hance the love of music and develop
taste for that which is good, on the
part of our people."
