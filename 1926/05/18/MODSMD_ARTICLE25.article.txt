# CAMPUS OPINION

; The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that Mr. Nolan's
criticism of the Executive Committee
j is rather unwarranted. The Associated
' Students cannot attend to every de
tail of their governemnt because of
; the unwieldiness of the ballot. They
I have, therefore, elected representa
tives vested with the powers of govern
ment. It is only meet that the exercise
of those powers be left to their dis
cretion.
It is given the Executive Committee i
to send the vice-president to the presi
dents' convention if it were held —
which it is not —for no other reason j
than that such action is too trivial to
warrant the time necessary to the i
student body's expression of approval!
or disapproval. The Executive Com
mittee has seen fit to take that action.
Then why should The Daily Palo Alto (
columns be filled with the death-groans
of die-hards?
Perhaps it is not the custom to send !
the vice ; president to the presidents'
convention —what of it? The law is
made for man, not man for the law,
and if it is profitable to change the !
customs, the customs should be j
changed. We want able men to repre
sent Stanford wherever we may send i
representatives. If one of those men
are to be found—as is the case —in the
vice-presidential chair, let us not allow ;

the greater good to be lost because of \
the customs prevailing.
As a disinterested observer, I, my- :
self, am in favor of the action, and if, |
as has been said, it is au "arbitrary
and well-planned move on the part of
the members" of the Executive Com
mittee, I take my hat off to them for
having done a good thing well.
