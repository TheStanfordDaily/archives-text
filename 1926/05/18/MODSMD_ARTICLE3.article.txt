# FRENCH ALGERIA IS TOPIC OF R. V. ANDERSON LECTURE
## 
### 
"Selection of university students
should not be merely on the basis of
intellectual superiority, but on the
basis of all-round superiority," said
Robert V. Anderson in an interview
yesterday. Anderson will give an illus
trated lecture on "Algeria—the heart
of the French North African Empire"
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
tonight. Anderson, '06, is a geologist of
note who for many years has been
connected with the Whitehall Petro
leum Corporation.
In his lecture tonight Anderson will
give a brief geographical review of
Algeria. He will discuss aspects of
Algeria as a French zone of coloniza
tion, viewing high lights of its history,
peoples, and races.
One of the speaker's many interests
outside the field of geology is the sub
ject of increasing the power of the
universities to turn out leaders of
civilization, especially by a more care
ful selection of student material, by
those institutions capable of being
"selective universities."
"The more selective function is exer
cised as an essential corollary to edu

cation the more diverse will universi
ties become, each setting standards
that it wishes its name to represent
or that it can attain. The university
that establishes high standards of har
monious physical and mental endow
ment, as well as of training, will gain
notably in prestige," declared Ander
son.
"It would seem that the fundamental
qualifications to be sought by the in
stitution which adopts the ideal of all
round manhood and womanhood are
superior physical constitution, ability,
and character, judging these primarily
in the light of hereditary qualities,
with regard to advantages gained
through previous influence and train
ing. •
"The first fundamental is not mere
ly, nor necessarily, a temporary state
of health, but rather a sound physical
background, the foundation that pre
sages a long and active life. The sec
ond is the intelligence and capacity
that will permit one to think and to do
things well. The third may be con
sidered to comprise those qualities of
good humor, initiative, will, aspiration,
honor, and others which predispose to i
the helpful employment of one's facul-j
ties.
"In addition to the best methods
now in practice for judging talent and
mental, not merely scholastic, qualifica
tion, it would be necessary to subject,
candidates to complete physical tests
along well-known lines, to learn the
main features of their family history, |
with special reference to hereditary j
vitality, ailments, and abilities, to ob-|
tain data regarding their childhood and •
school record, and finally, to have'
them come into personal contact with |
a number of men and women of super- j
ior ability and experience in judging |
personality, inclinations, and other
traits of character.
"With respect to the question of
health and constitution, it is true that
physical examinations are very gen
erally given by universities to their
matriculates; but almost entirely with
a view to hygiene and to helping the !
individual, rather than as a basis for j
refusal.
"It is bound to be the case that
young people drawn together by asso
ciation, and by a community of thought
and tastes, as a result of attendance j
at universities, are more apt to marry I
within than outside this circle. The'
selective process of which universities ,
are agents is thus converted into a :
eugenic process.
"It is the 'select' element of society
that is relied upon chiefly for leader-!
ship, for the guiding work of the world.
Of the many factors silently at work
winnowing from the mass those who i
shall hold leading positions, the uni- :
versity is of course only one, but it is ;
among the most powerful and will j
surely become more so.
"If the university of the highest
grade is to be a select association of '•
the best that it can draw, let the basis
for admission be a comprehensive one,
let its candidates be judged as indi-1
viduals, as 'men of parts' not merely j
of one part, let each represent a well- 1
balanced union of superior physical
and mental heritage."

"Selection of university students
should not be merely on the basis of
intellectual superiority, but on the
basis of all-round superiority," said
Robert V. Anderson in an interview
yesterday. Anderson will give an illus
trated lecture on "Algeria—the heart
of the French North African Empire"
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
tonight. Anderson, '06, is a geologist of
note who for many years has been
connected with the Whitehall Petro
leum Corporation.
In his lecture tonight Anderson will
give a brief geographical review of
Algeria. He will discuss aspects of
Algeria as a French zone of coloniza
tion, viewing high lights of its history,
peoples, and races.
One of the speaker's many interests
outside the field of geology is the sub
ject of increasing the power of the
universities to turn out leaders of
civilization, especially by a more care
ful selection of student material, by
those institutions capable of being
"selective universities."
"The more selective function is exer
cised as an essential corollary to edu

cation the more diverse will universi
ties become, each setting standards
that it wishes its name to represent
or that it can attain. The university
that establishes high standards of har
monious physical and mental endow
ment, as well as of training, will gain
notably in prestige," declared Ander
son.
"It would seem that the fundamental
qualifications to be sought by the in
stitution which adopts the ideal of all
round manhood and womanhood are
superior physical constitution, ability,
and character, judging these primarily
in the light of hereditary qualities,
with regard to advantages gained
through previous influence and train
ing. •
"The first fundamental is not mere
ly, nor necessarily, a temporary state
of health, but rather a sound physical
background, the foundation that pre
sages a long and active life. The sec
ond is the intelligence and capacity
that will permit one to think and to do
things well. The third may be con
sidered to comprise those qualities of
good humor, initiative, will, aspiration,
honor, and others which predispose to i
the helpful employment of one's facul-j
ties.
"In addition to the best methods
now in practice for judging talent and
mental, not merely scholastic, qualifica
tion, it would be necessary to subject,
candidates to complete physical tests
along well-known lines, to learn the
main features of their family history, |
with special reference to hereditary j
vitality, ailments, and abilities, to ob-|
tain data regarding their childhood and •
school record, and finally, to have'
them come into personal contact with |
a number of men and women of super- j
ior ability and experience in judging |
personality, inclinations, and other
traits of character.
"With respect to the question of
health and constitution, it is true that
physical examinations are very gen
erally given by universities to their
matriculates; but almost entirely with
a view to hygiene and to helping the !
individual, rather than as a basis for j
refusal.
"It is bound to be the case that
young people drawn together by asso
ciation, and by a community of thought
and tastes, as a result of attendance j
at universities, are more apt to marry I
within than outside this circle. The'
