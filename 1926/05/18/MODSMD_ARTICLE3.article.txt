# FRENCH ALGERIA IS TOPIC OF R. V. ANDERSON LECTURE
## 
### 
"Selection of university students
should not be merely on the basis of
intellectual superiority, but on the
basis of all-round superiority," said
Robert V. Anderson in an interview
yesterday. Anderson will give an illus
trated lecture on "Algeria—the heart
of the French North African Empire"
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
tonight. Anderson, '06, is a geologist of
note who for many years has been
connected with the Whitehall Petro

In his lecture tonight Anderson will
give a brief geographical review of
Algeria. He will discuss aspects of
Algeria as a French zone of coloniza

peoples, and races.
One of the speaker's many interests
outside the field of geology is the sub

universities to turn out leaders of
civilization, especially by a more care
ful selection of student material, by
those institutions capable of being
"selective universities."
"The more selective function is exer

that it wishes its name to represent
or that it can attain. The university
that establishes high standards of har
monious physical and mental endow
ment, as well as of training, will gain
notably in prestige," declared Ander
son.
"It would seem that the fundamental
qualifications to be sought by the in
stitution which adopts the ideal of all
round manhood and womanhood are
superior physical constitution, ability,
and character, judging these primarily
in the light of hereditary qualities,
with regard to advantages gained
through previous influence and train
ing. •
"The first fundamental is not mere
ly, nor necessarily, a temporary state
of health, but rather a sound physical
background, the foundation that pre
sages a long and active life. The sec
ond is the intelligence and capacity
that will permit one to think and to do
things well. The third may be con
sidered to comprise those qualities of
