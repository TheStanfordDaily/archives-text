# ABUNDANT BIRD LIFE AT STANFORD DUE TO CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
## 
### 
The Stanford campus, because of its
J. favorable climatic and geographical
i conditions, forms an excellent place
| , for the study and observation of birds,
i according to Professor John O. Snyder
of (he Zoology department. With the
bay on one side, bordered by a broad
! marsh and a rather flat valley which
' slopes up to the foothills, birds of all
! kinds are found on the campus.
Conditions at Stanford favor bird
; life. The forests and canyons of the
mountains, the streams flowing down
from the mountains to the bay, and
the brush-covered valleys and culti
vated fields and orchards attract the
birds.
Marine Birds
j Because Stanford is near the bay,
; marine birds are often found on the
I campus. From the marsh lands come
' the marsh birds, and the open fields
| and trees of the valleys give their
I characteristic types. Occasionally the
mountain tops are snow-covered and
i for this reason birds that are attracted j
: to cooler climates are often found here
also. It has been stated that a walk !
j which might take one in a day from |
; the bay to the mountain tops would ;
cover a more varied region and contain !
] a more varied bird fauna than would
| a trip from Chicago to Boston.
The bay and marsh regions in win-;
ter are inhabited by a great number I
of ducks, geese, and water birds from
the north. In former years they used j
to be there in great numbers, but be- 1
cause of hunting, civilization, and the
cultivation of the marsh they are now
I disappearing. The marsh itself har-j
bors birds found only in California,
I among which are the clapperrail, the
J Bryant marsh sparrow, and the marsh I
song sparrow.
Valleys Contain Species
In the valleys are found the ordinary |
representation of California songbirds.
Among these are the California linnet,
the bullock oriole, and others. In the
wintertime great numbers of birds
such as the robin, varied thrushes,;
bluebirds, and warblers enter the val- I
ley from the north and mingle with :
the resident birds there. The most j
common of the latter are the quail and 1
blackbirds. The foothills and moun
tains furnish such birds as the crested
jay and the chat.
Two birds formerly found 011 the
j campus have now entirely disappeared.
; These are the white-tailed kite and
the • burrowing owl. However, some
1 other birds have appeared in late years
j such as the juncos and a few others.
Many larger birds have been found
jon the campus. Among these have been
j the American and the golden eagle,
; the turkey vulture, the great-horned
owl, and the great blue herron. Three
species of the humming bird, the
smallest known birds, have been found. ;

| , for the study and observation of birds,
i according to Professor John O. Snyder
of (he Zoology department. With the
bay on one side, bordered by a broad
! marsh and a rather flat valley which
' slopes up to the foothills, birds of all
! kinds are found on the campus.
Conditions at Stanford favor bird
; life. The forests and canyons of the
mountains, the streams flowing down
from the mountains to the bay, and
the brush-covered valleys and culti
vated fields and orchards attract the
birds.
Marine Birds
j Because Stanford is near the bay,
; marine birds are often found on the
I campus. From the marsh lands come
' the marsh birds, and the open fields
| and trees of the valleys give their
I characteristic types. Occasionally the
mountain tops are snow-covered and
i for this reason birds that are attracted j
: to cooler climates are often found here
also. It has been stated that a walk !
j which might take one in a day from |
; the bay to the mountain tops would ;
cover a more varied region and contain !
] a more varied bird fauna than would
| a trip from Chicago to Boston.
The bay and marsh regions in win-;
ter are inhabited by a great number I
of ducks, geese, and water birds from
the north. In former years they used j
to be there in great numbers, but be- 1
cause of hunting, civilization, and the
cultivation of the marsh they are now
I disappearing. The marsh itself har-j
bors birds found only in California,
I among which are the clapperrail, the
J Bryant marsh sparrow, and the marsh I
song sparrow.
Valleys Contain Species
In the valleys are found the ordinary |
representation of California songbirds.
Among these are the California linnet,
the bullock oriole, and others. In the
wintertime great numbers of birds
such as the robin, varied thrushes,;
bluebirds, and warblers enter the val- I
ley from the north and mingle with :
the resident birds there. The most j
common of the latter are the quail and 1
blackbirds. The foothills and moun
tains furnish such birds as the crested
jay and the chat.
Two birds formerly found 011 the
j campus have now entirely disappeared.
; These are the white-tailed kite and
the • burrowing owl. However, some
1 other birds have appeared in late years
j such as the juncos and a few others.
Many larger birds have been found
jon the campus. Among these have been
j the American and the golden eagle,
; the turkey vulture, the great-horned
owl, and the great blue herron. Three
species of the humming bird, the
smallest known birds, have been found. ;
