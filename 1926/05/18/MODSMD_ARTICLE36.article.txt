By taking all places in the plunge,

meet held yesterday at Roble pool.
Madeline Frick, sophomore captain,
lead the scoring with thirteen points,
a first in the 50-yard free style, a first
in the plunge, and a second in the
75-yard free style. Jean Wakefield,
sophomore, was second in point totals
with a first in the breast stroke, a
second in the 25-yard free style, and
a lap in the relay, making a total of
nine and a quarter points.
High freshman scorers were Jean
Armes, captain, and Rosalie Walters,
with eight points each.
The opening of the meet saw Jean
Armes and Jean Wakefield racing
evenly for almost the entire 25 yards
of their race. Jean Armes won by a
touch. Lida Rittler took third, being
but slightly behind the other two.
The sophomores evened the score
when Jean Wakefield took a first in
the breaststroke, Roberta Richards
and Elsa Krotozyner coming in second
and third respectively for the fresh
men.
Madeline Frick, by winning the 75-
yard free style for the sophomores,
gave them a one-point lead as the
freshmen took both second and third
with Jean Armes and Barbara Lee.
In the next event, the plunge, the
sophomores took a commanding lead
by scoring all points. Madeline Frick,
Helen Huneke, and Frances Clancy
finished in the order named. All three
made distances which give them pos
sibilities as place winners in the event
on Field Day. Madeline Frick beat
Helen Huneke for first place by going
three inches farther. Frances Clancy
was a foot behind.
The time made by both Rosalie Wal
ters, who won the 75-yard free style
event, and Madeline Frick, who placed
second, was as good time as has been
made this year.
Tomorrow the juniors will meet the
seniors in the third round of the inter
class series. The summary:

(F), Wakefield (S) second, Rittler (S)
