# ENGINEERS MEET TO DISCUSS PLANS FOR PUBLISHING JOURNAL
## 
### 
Stanford engineers, together with
students in the Geology and Mining
departments, will meet this evening at
7:30 in Room 26S in order to discuss
the proposed plan of Lewis O. Howell,
'27, calling for monthly publication of
an engineering journal similar to those
published by practically every engi
neering institution of importance in
the United States. The engineers
will discuss the advisability of publish
ing such a magazine, and if the pro
posal is favorably received, tentative
steps towards its organization will be
taken.
The Stanford engineering journal, if
modeled after those now in publica
tion by the engineering schools of Cor
nell, Boston Tech, Wisconsin, Prince
ton, Kansas, lowa, and other universi
ties, will contain articles by students,
alumni, professors, and men prominent
in engineering work. Both technical
subjects and stories of trips or experi
ments in engineering or other work
of interest to engineering or geology
and mining students will be included
in the publication, which will be self
supporting through advertising and
subscription.
An organization for publication as
tentatively suggested by Howell, who
is initiating the movement with the
view of obtaining support of the Stan
ford engineering students, would in
clude an elective or appointive board
of five students of faculty members,
composed of an executive editor, a
business manager, an alumni editor,
an editor in charge of the student sec
tion, and a treasurer-auditor for the
supervision of finances.
