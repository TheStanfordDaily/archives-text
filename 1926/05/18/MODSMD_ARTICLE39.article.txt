# SPORTS OF 1926
## Richards the Lion-Hearted 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The young gentleman looking at you from the octagonal frame is the boy
who has beaten Bill Tilden more often than any other tennis player. The
trimming he administered to Large William at White Sulphur Springs the
other day was the second time this year ana the third time in succession that
the Boy Prodigy of Yonkers has defeated the national champion. Vinnie is
now one victory up on Bill, as far as their total matches go.
Every spring brings the usual slushy weather, followed shortly by a
Richards victory over Tilden. And every September brings revenge to Bill,
but Vinnie says that 1926 will be different, that they'll have their usual
"spanking sets," only this time it won't be he who gets slapped.
Besides being Olympic tennis champion, third ranking player in the United
States, etc., etc., Richards writes newspaper articles and sells life insurance.
You may think that your life isn't worth much when you face Vinnie across
the net, but you'll find it worth a lot if you ever face him across his desk in
an insurance office.
Vinnie is voyaging soon —sailing for Europe on Saturday, with Howard
Kinsey as a traveling companion. In Paris they'll "join the ladies" (the
women members of the United States team), and play a series of .team matches
with the French players, followed by competition in the French hard court
championships. The troupe then moves on to Merrie England and more team
matches, and then the historic Wimbledon tournament.
I approached Vincent Richards last summer at Forest Hills, after he had
lost the first of his terrific Davis Cup trial matches with Billy Johnston.
"Good sport, wasn't it?" he said, as I shook his dripping hand. I'll say it
was —and I'll say this too —Vincent Richards is a good sport!
