# HARMONY, MELODY OF A CAPPELLA SINGERS PLEASE IN CONCERT
## Excellent Technique Shown By Smallman Singers In Assembly Hall 
### Herb Klein 
Smallman's A Cappella Choir proved
a revelation to the audience which
j heard it last night in the Assembly
! hall. With splendid fullness of tone, j
i clearness of melody, and almost un- j
i believable ability to produce exalted j
| and inspiring harmony, the group of ;
! forty singers, dressed in their novel j
and attractive Gypsy costumes, proved j
jthat the art of unaccompanied singing
was truly the peak of vocal music and j
that there exists in the West at least
one organization capable of the part
in an advanced form.
The program was varied by the in
; elusion of some modern folk and art
! songs with the usual repertoire of re-;
jligious and medieval music. The Small-!
1 man Choir lacked the usual rather j
, forbidding and gloomy appearance of
| choirs, being dressed, both men and
women, by many-colored gypsy outfits J
I whose colors contrasted and harmon-,
ized almost as effectively as tlieir
! voices.
The choir appeared under the au- j
â€¢ spices of the Stanford Glee Club. It is :
! a comparatively new organization in :
I Los Angeles but has already earned j
praise in many quarters.
Three imposing numbers by the;
choir opened the recital: "Hymn to
I Raphael, the Divine," dedicated to the
'great painter; "Hosanna," and "Beauti
ful Saviour," both by Christiansen.
Delicate pianissimo passages in;
i which the voices sank to a low mur- j
mur were set off against brilliant!
climaxes with every voice exerted to
its utmost. There was never any un- j
certainty or indistinctness in the soft- j
est parts, however, and even when alli
the tremendous volume which the
choir possessed was used, the effect
was never blaring or oppressive; the;
. purity of tone and perfect unity of j
I attack which are essential to good (
A Cappella singing were at all times!
j present.
The spirit and zest with which sing
ing was done in the more modern
songs which followed was equal to
that of the older music. A "Nocturne," j
by Cesar Cui of the modern Russian 1
school, was melodious and somewhat j
exotic in feeling. A special arrange-j
ment of Annie Laurie was sung in
which the folk song was expanded al- j

most into a symphony for voices and
called forth some of the most effective
work of the choir.
As an encore, "The Song of the
Volga Boatmen" was given in a dis
tinctive and memorable manner. The
choir's arrangement contained sus
tained notes sung by the bass as a
melodic background which gave the
familiar folk song a new and attrac
tive effect. The sharpness of attack,
due probably to the capable baton of
John Smallman, the director, was in

evidence here in the way the boat
men's cry was almost snapped out,
making the song one of energy and
virility, rather than the mournful
chant it generally becomes.
Two groups of violin solos were
played by Vera Barstow, soloist with
the choir. Her work in the lengthy
"Rondo Capricioso" by Saint Saeua
seemed better than in her earlier se
lection, but was never of sufficient
merit to be placed on the same pro
gram as that of the choir.
