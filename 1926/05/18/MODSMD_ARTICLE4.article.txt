# HARMONY, MELODY OF A CAPPELLA SINGERS PLEASE IN CONCERT
## Excellent Technique Shown By Smallman Singers In Assembly Hall 
### Herb Klein 
Smallman's A Cappella Choir proved
a revelation to the audience which
j heard it last night in the Assembly
! hall. With splendid fullness of tone, j
i clearness of melody, and almost un- j
i believable ability to produce exalted j
| and inspiring harmony, the group of ;
! forty singers, dressed in their novel j
and attractive Gypsy costumes, proved j
jthat the art of unaccompanied singing
was truly the peak of vocal music and j
that there exists in the West at least
one organization capable of the part
in an advanced form.
The program was varied by the in
; elusion of some modern folk and art
! songs with the usual repertoire of re-;
jligious and medieval music. The Small-!
1 man Choir lacked the usual rather j
, forbidding and gloomy appearance of
| choirs, being dressed, both men and
women, by many-colored gypsy outfits J
I whose colors contrasted and harmon-,
ized almost as effectively as tlieir
! voices.
The choir appeared under the au- j
• spices of the Stanford Glee Club. It is :
! a comparatively new organization in :
I Los Angeles but has already earned j
praise in many quarters.
Three imposing numbers by the;
choir opened the recital: "Hymn to
I Raphael, the Divine," dedicated to the
'great painter; "Hosanna," and "Beauti
ful Saviour," both by Christiansen.
Delicate pianissimo passages in;
i which the voices sank to a low mur- j
mur were set off against brilliant!
climaxes with every voice exerted to
its utmost. There was never any un- j
certainty or indistinctness in the soft- j
est parts, however, and even when alli
the tremendous volume which the
choir possessed was used, the effect
was never blaring or oppressive; the;
. purity of tone and perfect unity of j
I attack which are essential to good (
A Cappella singing were at all times!
j present.
The spirit and zest with which sing
ing was done in the more modern
songs which followed was equal to
