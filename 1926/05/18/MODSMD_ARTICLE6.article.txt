# PETITIONERS WOULD ABOLISH CAPTAINS FOR SPORTS TEAMS
## Ex Committee Will Pass on Appeal Before Placing It on Ballot 
### 
Another petition regarding the elec
tion of captains of athletic teams was
circulated on the campus yesterday
and this morning, in which the peti
tioners go one step further than the
Executive Committee did in its action
at the special election several "weeks
ago. This petition asks that no cap
tains be elected either before or after
any particular athletic season.
Following is the petition handed to
Robert E. Lewis, president of the
A.S.S.U., this morning: "We, the un
dersigned, do hereby respectfully peti
tion the Executive Committee to place
the following rule on the ballot at the
spring election to become a part of
the by-laws of the constitution:
"That no captains be elected for any
athletic team representing Stanford
University."
This petition was signed by eighty
seven students. The Executive Com
mittee will pass on it at the regular
meeting of that body tonight, before
it will be added to the ballot for the
general election to be held next Tues
day.
