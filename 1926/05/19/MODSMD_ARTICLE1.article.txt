# CARDS, U. S. C. FAVORITES FOR I. C. 4-A. TITLE
## Templeton Has Men Entered In All Field Events; Each Point-Winner THIRTEEN TO MAKE TRIP Stanford Records in P.C.C. Meet Point to Victory In Eastern Clash 
### Clifton Moore 
Three California teams, Stanford,
University of California, and U.S.C.,
loom as the strongest contenders for
the annual 1.C.4-A. track and field
championship to be decided in the
Harvard stadium at Cambridge, May
28 and 29. Stanford and U.S.C. are
favored more than California, but all
three coast teams should be among
the leaders in the big national meet.
Stanford rates the position of favo
rite to cop the 1.C.4-A. title because
of the decisive manner in which Coach
Dink Templeton's athletes won the
coast conference championship in the
P.C.C. meet last Saturday. The times
and distances recorded in the confer
-ence meet equal or better any results
turned in by Eastern track performers
this season, and the coast athletes are
experted to make the East take notice
this year.
Thirteen Card Men
Stanford will be represented by a
thirteen-man team, every member of
which Templeton thinks will be a
point-winner. The Cardinals triumphed
over the strongest teams in the West
last Saturday with not a single entry
in the sprints, mile, or two-mile. Tem
pleton concentrated his men in Stan
ford's strongest events and utterly
disregarded the weaker events, and
by this means won the honors from
teams represented in every event.
The team competing for Stanford in
the East will be practically the same
combination Templeton used last
week. Tom Joaquin, javelin thrower,
is the only member of the conference
champions that will not make the
eastern journey. The Cardinals will
compete in four track events and every
one of the field events.
Captain Bill Richardson's phenome
nal performances all this season mark
him as the premier half-mile runner
of the United States. He is credited
with records in both the California-
Stanford meet and the Coast Confer
ence meet, and his time of 1 minute
53 3-10 seconds established in the Big
Meet is the fastest collegiate time,
made all season. I
The Cardinal leader proved conclu
sively that he is the class of the coast
by his decisive victory over the West's
best 880 runners in the P.C.C. meet.
He defeated Charteris of Washington,
last year's intercollegiate champion,
by eight yards, the first time the
Husky star has ever been beaten.
Richardson also crossed the line ahead
of Boyden, his old California rival,
and Niersbach, the Trojan flash, rated
as two of the best half-milers in the
country.
Stanford's trio of quarter-milers,
Miller, Storie, and Babcock, came
through as was expected in the con
ference meet, placing one-two-three
ahead of the fastest field on the coast.
Miller holds every coast intercollegiate
record, and his time of 47 2-10 in the
final lap of the relay last Saturday is
the fastest time that has ever been
made by a college runner from a run
ning start. Miller is expected to lead
the field in the East, and his two team
mates should be right behind him.
West Chosen
Clarence West is the only Cardinal
hurdler selected for the trip. West is
a fine performer in the high sticks,
and although he will encounter plenty
of competition at Cambridge he should
give the Eastern timber toppers a
great battle. West has suffered a great
deal of hard luck in running the low
hurdles this year, and his misfortune
in stumbling near the finish has cost
him a number of first and second
places.
With a good possibility of running
up a number of points in the track
events, and a certainty of adding a
great deal more in the field, Stanford's
total should be above the column of
points amassed by other teams. The
Cardinal athletes are all expected to
add to the Stanford score, and Tern
pleton's stars can be counted upon to
outpoint the other aggregations in the
meet.
