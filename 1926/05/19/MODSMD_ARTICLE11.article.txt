### Frank Baker 
Editors Note:
The student body will ballot 011 the
following by-law to the constitution
of the A.SS.U. at the Quad election
| Tuesday: "That no captains be
} elected for any athletic team repre-
I seating Stanford University after
September 1, 1926."
In order to bring this issue to a
! vote it zcas necessary for the Execu
j the Committee to pass a by-lazv, and
! then for a petition to be circulated
requesting that the committee's action
be ratified by the student body. The
complete story of the procedure is
given below.
' The petition handed to the Execu
j tive Committee last night to have a
j new by-law put on the ballot for the
! election next Tuesday, stating "That
no captains be elected for any athletic
i team representing Stanford Univer
! sity," had to be passed up by the
: Committee, because this was not the
1 proper and constitutional manner of
| inserting a by-law into the constitu
-1 tion. However, the Committee pre
i pared a by-law reading essentially the
j same, and expressed the desire that
some group get out another petition
in order to bring the matter to a vote
; of the students.
Ballot Tuesday
A petition was circulated this morn
ing which will place the by-law on
j the ballot for the v general election
; Tuesday. The petition reads: "We, the
undersigned members of the A.S.S.U.,
do hereby petition that the by-law, pro
i viding that in the future no captains
be elected for Stanford athletic teams,
which was passed at a regular meeting
;of the Executive Committee on May
j 18 1926, be submitted for the approval
I or disapproval of the student body at
i the regular spring election." Now, with
1 the by-law on the ballot Tuesday, a
majority opinion will decide the issue.
The by law was put in by the Execu
j tive Committee only after it had the
opinion of Professor Marion Rice Kirk
wood, of the Law School. Professor
I
Kirkwood states: "Your constitution,
1
j Article XIV, provides for the adoption
iof by-Jaws. It recognizes only one
; method by which the initiative may be
j taken in this matter. That method is
1 by action of the Executive Committee.
| It seems to me, therefore, that the
i present petition is ineffective and that
i the question cannot be properly placed
upon the ballot in the proposed man
ner.
New Petition Filed
"If the Executive Committee should
today adopt such a by-law, then under
Article XIV it would not take effect
for one week and during that time a
petition may be filed, signed by twen
| ty-five members of the student body,
j requesting that the proposed change
| be submitted to a vote of the Associa-
S tion. If such a petition were filed then
j the proposal should appear on the bal
j lot and it would become a part of the
| by-laws only upon receiving a majority
I vote at the election."

in order to bring the matter to a vote
; of the students.
Ballot Tuesday
A petition was circulated this morn
ing which will place the by-law on
j the ballot for the v general election
; Tuesday. The petition reads: "We, the
undersigned members of the A.S.S.U.,
do hereby petition that the by-law, pro
i viding that in the future no captains
be elected for Stanford athletic teams,
which was passed at a regular meeting
;of the Executive Committee on May
j 18 1926, be submitted for the approval
I or disapproval of the student body at
i the regular spring election." Now, with
1 the by-law on the ballot Tuesday, a
majority opinion will decide the issue.
The by law was put in by the Execu
j tive Committee only after it had the
opinion of Professor Marion Rice Kirk
wood, of the Law School. Professor
I
Kirkwood states: "Your constitution,
1
j Article XIV, provides for the adoption
iof by-Jaws. It recognizes only one
; method by which the initiative may be
j taken in this matter. That method is
1 by action of the Executive Committee.
| It seems to me, therefore, that the
i present petition is ineffective and that
i the question cannot be properly placed
upon the ballot in the proposed man
ner.
New Petition Filed
"If the Executive Committee should
today adopt such a by-law, then under
Article XIV it would not take effect
for one week and during that time a
petition may be filed, signed by twen
| ty-five members of the student body,
j requesting that the proposed change
| be submitted to a vote of the Associa-
S tion. If such a petition were filed then
j the proposal should appear on the bal
j lot and it would become a part of the
| by-laws only upon receiving a majority
I vote at the election."
Editors Note:
The student body will ballot 011 the
following by-law to the constitution
of the A.SS.U. at the Quad election
| Tuesday: "That no captains be
} elected for any athletic team repre-
I seating Stanford University after
September 1, 1926."
In order to bring this issue to a
! vote it zcas necessary for the Execu
j the Committee to pass a by-lazv, and
! then for a petition to be circulated
requesting that the committee's action
be ratified by the student body. The
complete story of the procedure is
given below.
' The petition handed to the Execu
j tive Committee last night to have a
j new by-law put on the ballot for the
! election next Tuesday, stating "That
no captains be elected for any athletic
i team representing Stanford Univer
! sity," had to be passed up by the
: Committee, because this was not the
1 proper and constitutional manner of
| inserting a by-law into the constitu
-1 tion. However, the Committee pre
i pared a by-law reading essentially the
j same, and expressed the desire that
some group get out another petition
in order to bring the matter to a vote
; of the students.
