Robert E. Lewis, President of the
A.S.S.U.. left last night for Seattle to
attend the Convention of Pacific Coast!
j Student Body Presidents which is be- \
\ ing held this year at the University of ;
Washington.
I These conventions are held for the j
purpose of round table discussion of
' the many and various problems that j
confront the student organizations of
the Pacific Coast colleges, and to en- >
able the presidents to become better ac-1
| quainted with the methods at other uni- j
versities.
One of the main points of discussion j
this year will be the Stanford system i
of placing all of the freshmen men in'
one hall. This plan has been watched
, closely by the other schools, and its i
progress has been the object of much j
comment. Lewis will endeavor to ex-1
I plain the working of the sponsor sys
tem and the way the freshman hall is
i run here.
