# MINGLING OF RACES ALGERIAN PROBLEM DECLARES ANDERSON
## Native, Foreign Population Increases; Outsiders Improve Country 
### 
"Algeria offers an interesting field
for study of European colonization in
that it involves the question of
whether or not the European race will
fuse with the natives," said Robert
Van Vleck Anderson, '06, who gave an
illustrated lecture on "Algeria—Heart
of the North African Empire," in the
Little Theatre last night.
"An outstanding feature of Algeria
is that it is a zone of colonization by
a white race in what is a white man's
J country, suitable for them and con
trolled by them, but already denselj
: populated by a race inferior but fairly
; high which might be considered capable
| ble of taking care of itself.
Population Growing
"European population, including pri
! marily French, Spanish, and Italian,
! is growing, and through the stability
: and peace in Algeria brought about
through the European inroads, the
native population is increasing. In
time the natives must be given more
i equality with the result of a mingling
| of races, although there are many bin
| drances such as religion, manners, and
racial prejudices. With these condi
■ tions it is inevitable that a distinct
; race will grow up."
In speaking of the social conditions
: in Algeria, Anderson said: "The peo
ple seem happy but carry on under
i conditions which appear to be leading
( nowhere. Lack of initiative and lazi
ness are given as causes for this
inertia. The French are giving oppor
tunities for developing initiative
I through the introduction of education
on a more extensive scale. They have
established higher schools, but most
of the natives are content with a pri
mary education. Education for the na-
I tives does not progress rapidly except
' as they come into contact with the
' French."
I Since Algeria is isolated, cut off in
| the north by a rugged coast facing
| the Mediterranean, in the west by the
I Atlantic, on the south by the Sahara,
> and on the east by the sea, it has not
partaken of the inflow of civilization
! as has Europe. In view of the difficulty
;of access to Algeria the number of
inroads made is surprising, according
to Anderson.
Resources Lacking
Algeria, which lacks an abundance
lof national resources, is a food-pro
| ducing country, agriculture being the
(chief occupation of the inhabitants.
The small farmers and peasants are
' outside the cities where there are a
1 large number of tradesmen, craftsmen,
i and workmen on a small scale. Many
i of the natives who work farms during
j most of the year emigrate to the cities
on the coast to work in the summer,
j some even going to France to work.
Algeria is not an arid region as is
1 commonly thought but is similar to
: California in geography and climate.
The Coast Range of California is much
the same as the Tell Atlas chain of
mountains in Algeria, and the plateau
region of Algeria is similar to the San
I Joaquin Valley. The Sahara Atlas cor
l responds to the Sierra Madre Moun
; tains. The climate of North Africa is
! like that of California, rainy in winter,
dry in summer, cool in winter, and hot
in summer.

country. Illustrations of the villages,
buildings, and natives were also

Resources Lacking
Algeria, which lacks an abundance
lof national resources, is a food-pro
| ducing country, agriculture being the
(chief occupation of the inhabitants.
The small farmers and peasants are
' outside the cities where there are a
1 large number of tradesmen, craftsmen,
i and workmen on a small scale. Many
i of the natives who work farms during
j most of the year emigrate to the cities
on the coast to work in the summer,
j some even going to France to work.
Algeria is not an arid region as is
1 commonly thought but is similar to
: California in geography and climate.
The Coast Range of California is much
the same as the Tell Atlas chain of
mountains in Algeria, and the plateau
region of Algeria is similar to the San
I Joaquin Valley. The Sahara Atlas cor
l responds to the Sierra Madre Moun
; tains. The climate of North Africa is
! like that of California, rainy in winter,
dry in summer, cool in winter, and hot
in summer.

"Algeria offers an interesting field
for study of European colonization in
that it involves the question of
whether or not the European race will
fuse with the natives," said Robert
Van Vleck Anderson, '06, who gave an
illustrated lecture on "Algeria—Heart
of the North African Empire," in the
Little Theatre last night.
"An outstanding feature of Algeria
is that it is a zone of colonization by
a white race in what is a white man's
J country, suitable for them and con
trolled by them, but already denselj
: populated by a race inferior but fairly
; high which might be considered capable
| ble of taking care of itself.
Population Growing
"European population, including pri
! marily French, Spanish, and Italian,
! is growing, and through the stability
: and peace in Algeria brought about
through the European inroads, the
native population is increasing. In
time the natives must be given more
i equality with the result of a mingling
| of races, although there are many bin
| drances such as religion, manners, and
racial prejudices. With these condi
■ tions it is inevitable that a distinct
; race will grow up."
In speaking of the social conditions
: in Algeria, Anderson said: "The peo
ple seem happy but carry on under
i conditions which appear to be leading
( nowhere. Lack of initiative and lazi
ness are given as causes for this
inertia. The French are giving oppor
tunities for developing initiative
I through the introduction of education
on a more extensive scale. They have
established higher schools, but most
of the natives are content with a pri
mary education. Education for the na-
I tives does not progress rapidly except
' as they come into contact with the
' French."
I Since Algeria is isolated, cut off in
| the north by a rugged coast facing
| the Mediterranean, in the west by the
I Atlantic, on the south by the Sahara,
> and on the east by the sea, it has not
partaken of the inflow of civilization
! as has Europe. In view of the difficulty
;of access to Algeria the number of
inroads made is surprising, according
to Anderson.
