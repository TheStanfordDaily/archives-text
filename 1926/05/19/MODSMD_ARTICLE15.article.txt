# AWARD FOUNDED IN MEMORY OF ERIC K. JORDAN
## Parents Make University Gift of $5000 for Research Fellowships SON WAS GEOLOGIST Wide Latitude Allowed for Fund Administration; Two Stipulations 
### 
As a memorial to their son, Eric
j Knight Jordan, wlio was killed in an
j automobile accident March 10, while
jon a geological trip. Dr. David Starr
j Jordan and Mrs. Jordan have estab
| lished a fund for research fellowships
, in geology at Stanford University, to
I be known as the Eric Knight Jordan
Research Fellowships in Geology.
L | They have turned over to the Uni
versity for this purpose $5000 and an
nounce that they hope to be able to
add to this amount and that friends
i of their son and themselves may also
make additions.
j The plan of such a memorial fund
I was made by Dr. and Mrs. Jordan
; soon after their son's death and later
j formulated and presented to the IJni
! versity authorities, who have accepted
I it with deep appreciation of its sig
! nificance.
As submitted to the Board of Trus
; tees and accepted by them, the plan
! gives the University wide latitude in
I I the administration of the fund, only
■ two conditions being stipulated:
' | "First, that the name of Eric Knight
J Jordan shall be perpetuated in the
•! title of the fellowships, it being our
J belief that he gave promise of becom
j ing a rare worker in Geology, his cho
■; sen subject.
| "Second, that the principal sum be
! forever kept inviolate, only its earn
: | ings to be used for any purpose what
! j soever.
"All other details concerning the
proposed fellowships we leave to the
I University authorities."
President Wilbur commented espe
cially on the broad wisdom shown by
Chancellor and Mrs. Jordan in these
provisions. "As the years go on," he
said, "Eric Jordan's name will be a
source of inspiration to many workers
in his own field of geology, in which
he had already achieved signal suc
cesses, although a young man, and in
which he gave promise of a brilliant
future. The conditions of the gift are,
I think, the wisest I have yet seen in
any scholarship or fellowship founda
tion because they permit sufficient
elasticity to meet changing condi
tions."
PJric Knight Jordan was a graduate
of Stanford where he followed in the
footsteps of his eminent father as a
scientist, even as a youth contributing
valuable additions to scientific knowl
edge. He took part in several scientific
expeditions and was made a member
of the scientific staff of the California
Academy of Sciences. At the time of
his death he was carrying on advance
studies at Stanford in addition to his
duties in this connection. He was killed
when his automobile was wrecked
through losing a tire on the State
Highway near Morgan Hill.
