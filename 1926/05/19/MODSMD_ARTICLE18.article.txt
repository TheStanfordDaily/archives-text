# More Western Competition
## 
### 
The news columns have blossomed forth with the announcement of a
new sponsoring body for the annual Pacific Coast track and field meet;
and, in fact, a bigger and better meet for the competitive desires of the
hundreds of athletes and scores of colleges and universities of the Far
West. The change occurred last Friday in a secret session of the coast
conference graduate managers who moved to drop the present method of
conducting the annual Conference track meet and to sponsor the new, in
clusive program.
Apparently, the conference is acting as the benevolent despot and is
throwing its support around the shoulders of its smaller rivals, giving
them a chance for high honors and big-time competition; further, it was
felt that such an intercollegiate meet as proposed would fulfill better the
purposes which are behind the old Conference meet —the deciding of a
Far Western champion.
We believe in and commend the action of the conference if it will lead
to further action which we believe is more desirable than any yet proposed :
a National meet at which a genuine national champion will be decided. If
the P.C.C. feels that by their recent move they will satisfy that craving of
the nine conference schools for great honors, a craving which is only nat
ural we make bold to state that they are doomed to disappointment.
More quantity competition, as the new Pacific Coast Intercollegiates
will provide, will not necessarily be more quality competition although an
occasional star sprinter or distance man, may loom. There will still remain
the desire on the part of the athletes themselves to compete with the cream
of the East and Middle-West and thereby make certain who is entitled to
be called the best team in the country.
The date for the new Intercollegiates has been set for one of the first
three weeks in June. If the California teams succeed in forcing them
selves into the lead in the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet next week, we feel safe in
predicting that there will be a strong sentiment next year in favor of re
peating the trip—regardless of the theoretical advantages now presented
for the new plan. And one will not honestly blame those who will demand
more eastern competition for western squads.
But anyway the new plan can do no harm; and, as we have pointed out
it would be admirable if it encouraged the innovation of a decisive na
tional meet, the winner of which would be the undisputed champion of the
United States.
