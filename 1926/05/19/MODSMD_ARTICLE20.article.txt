# WILL ERECT MEMORIAL FOR WALTER CAMP
## 
### 
Erection of a national memorial to
the late Walter Camp, "Father of
American Football," is being planned
by the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation in co-operation with Yale
University. The memorial is to be a
tribute not from Yale alumni alone,
but from all colleges, universities, and
preparatory schools where football is
played today. A monumental gateway
at the entrance to the Yale Athletic
Fields is the form chosen for the me
morial. Yale fields will be renamed
the Walter Camp Fields.
The co-operation of 458 colleges and
scores of preparatory schools is called
for in the plans for raising the money
for the memorial. The undertaking is
unique in that it is the first time that,
all American colleges have engaged in
a co-operative enterprise of this sort.
