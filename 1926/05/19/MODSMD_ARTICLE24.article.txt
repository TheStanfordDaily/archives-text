Youth steels fire truck to escort maiden home, and drives in low gear all
the way, burns out bearing, wrecks the truck against a tree, and disappears. —
News Item.
The item said the fellow didn't know what he was doing,
When he sneaked off —it's sure he didn't see the trouble brewing.
But listen here while I expound a theory of my own.
This kid who drove the truck around knew more than now is known!
You recollect the item said that they'd been to a dance?
No doubt that something turned his head and put him in a trance.
Of course, we cannot blame the girl—they never are the cause
For foolishness done in the whirl to get their eye's applause.
But let us trace the path he took when from the hop they strayed,
And in this manner read the book where reasons are portrayed.
He had to take the lady home, and she had far to go—
No doubt the thought was in his dome that it was long and slow.
And so he sought about to find a means of transportation
And with the truck, across his mind there sped a high elation!!
Here was the means, within his power, to give his girl a ride;
And, queening, if they burned an hour, the heat could be defied!
For, having as their chariot a handy fire truck,
Then, love or not, 'twould carry it —here was some wondrous luck!
And so, he stole the autocar and took away the maid;
They went, and no one knows how far, but it was some parade.
He liked the lady very much, for evidences show
That little use he gave one clutch, because he drove in low.
The bearing that was burned away was one beneath his feet —
Quite plain, that from his ankles down there was no dearth of heat!
(Examinations of the car would seem to indicate
No evidence of burn or char left there by human freight.)
And finally, as to the wreck which finished off the ride —
You cannot drive, if round your neck a pair of arms are tied!!!!
For if you drive a car in low and burn a bearing, too,
To wreck the thing is just so-so and hardly something new.
And lastly, having done these things, you up and disappear
The coma that a true love brings explains it all, my dear.
Analysis of what was done in cases such as this,
Is easy, if. like me, you're one affected by a kiss
If you are such a one as I have found myself to be,
Just introspect —your inward eye will find a lot to see! —L.A.B.

the way, burns out bearing, wrecks the truck against a tree, and disappears. —
News Item.
The item said the fellow didn't know what he was doing,
When he sneaked off —it's sure he didn't see the trouble brewing.
But listen here while I expound a theory of my own.
This kid who drove the truck around knew more than now is known!
You recollect the item said that they'd been to a dance?
No doubt that something turned his head and put him in a trance.
Of course, we cannot blame the girl—they never are the cause
For foolishness done in the whirl to get their eye's applause.
But let us trace the path he took when from the hop they strayed,
And in this manner read the book where reasons are portrayed.
He had to take the lady home, and she had far to go—
No doubt the thought was in his dome that it was long and slow.
And so he sought about to find a means of transportation
And with the truck, across his mind there sped a high elation!!
Here was the means, within his power, to give his girl a ride;
And, queening, if they burned an hour, the heat could be defied!
For, having as their chariot a handy fire truck,
Then, love or not, 'twould carry it —here was some wondrous luck!
And so, he stole the autocar and took away the maid;
They went, and no one knows how far, but it was some parade.
He liked the lady very much, for evidences show
That little use he gave one clutch, because he drove in low.
The bearing that was burned away was one beneath his feet —
Quite plain, that from his ankles down there was no dearth of heat!
(Examinations of the car would seem to indicate
No evidence of burn or char left there by human freight.)
And finally, as to the wreck which finished off the ride —
You cannot drive, if round your neck a pair of arms are tied!!!!
For if you drive a car in low and burn a bearing, too,
To wreck the thing is just so-so and hardly something new.
And lastly, having done these things, you up and disappear
The coma that a true love brings explains it all, my dear.
Analysis of what was done in cases such as this,
Is easy, if. like me, you're one affected by a kiss
If you are such a one as I have found myself to be,
Just introspect —your inward eye will find a lot to see! —L.A.B.
