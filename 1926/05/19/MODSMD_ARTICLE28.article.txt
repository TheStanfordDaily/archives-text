# CAMPAIGN BOOKLETS FOR $500,000 LAW BUILDING SENT OUT
## Plans Call for Building of Second Quadrangle With Library as Center 
### Barbara Dewlaney 
As part of the campaign to raise
$500,000 for the construction of a. new
Law building, a booklet containing in
formation about the project is being
sent out by the University to Stanford
law graduates, nearby lawyers, and
other interested people. The proposed
building will be situated east of the
main University library and form a
part of the new quadrangle which is
being developed.
The booklet contains illustrations of
the first and second floor plans and
sketches of the Law building which
has beer designed to meet the needs
of the school for many academic gen
erations to come. The proposed struc
ture consists of a unified group of
buildings surrounding an arcaded open
court.
Building Described
The front portion of the building
facing east will be composed of class
rooms. A two-story library and office
building in the rear is to be devoted
primarily to library stacks, a reading
room, and offices. Space is provided
for stacks on both the first and second
floors. Surrounding the stacks on the
first floor are a number of conversa
tion rooms. Offices surround the stack
rows on the second floor.
"At present the Law School is
cramped in every department," the
pamphlet states. "The quarters consist
of two buildings on the Inner Quad
rangle. One of these contains the reci
tation rooms, three in number, which
are totally inadequate. In order to
meet conditions, it has been necessary
to schedule classes at undesirable
hours during the day, and some
courses have for several years been
held in recitation rooms allotted to
other departments and situated at a
considerable distance from the offices
of the law faculty.

"The second structure contains the
library, reading room, and offices of
the faculty. Conditions here are less
satisfactory than in the recitation
rooms. In this building can be housed
only 22,000 of the more than 32,000
volumes which constitute the library.
It has been necessary to store the rest
of the books in the basement of the
Administration building, where it is
impossible to ma"ke effective use of
them. In order to crowd in the 22,000
volumes the larger part of the stack
space in the offices of members of the
faculty has been utilized and two-story
stacks have been run around the out
side walls. These stacks are sixteen
feet high, and the upper shelves can
be reached only by portable' ladders.
The efficiency of the library is thereby
greatly impaired.
"Under such conditions it is impos
sible to shelve the books satisfactorily.
Furthermore the stacks are all made
of wood, and the interior partitions of
the building arfe ordinary wood lath
and plaster, with a false ceiling of the
same construction. It is apparent that
this valuable library is subject to a
great fire hazard.
Reading Room Small
"The reading room for students can
accommodate at one time not more
than ninety of the three hundred en
rolled. The library is the student's
laboratory, and he should be urged to
make the greatest possible use of it
from the beginning of his law course.
Under present conditions the begin
ning students are practically crowded
out."
Founded in 1893, the Law School
has grown slowly but steadily until
the present attendance exceeds three
hundred. There are nine faculty resi
dent men devoting their entire time
to the work of legal instruction as ;
well as other active practitioners who
lecture on special topics.
High Standard Set
"Stanford occupies a unique posi- j
tion in the matter of establishing high
standards," explains the booklet. "It j
is the leading privately endowed uni
versity in the West. It has an onnor- !
tunity to contribute to the develop
ment of law in the vast area of the
West, where legal problems differ in j
many respects from those of the East, i
"As support must come from private 1
endowment, with no aid from state
taxation, its resources fire necessarily!
limited. Along with the rest of the
University the Law School lias there
fore been forced to adopt the policy ■
of restriction upon the members in
attendance. No more students are ac
cepted than can be properly taught."
In accordance with this policy the
Board of Trustees, on the recommenda
tion of the Law School faculty, by
resolution passed June 27, 1924, pro
vided that an A.ll. degree should there-!
after be required for admission to the
professional curriculum in law. This is
the only school west of Pennsylvania
with such a requirement for admis
sion.
Additional funds amounting to

$50,000 for the endowment of the law
library are also being solicited. Al
though the present law library is for
the most part adequate for the needs
of law students preparing for ordinary
work of practice, it is deficient for re
search work.

High Standard Set
"Stanford occupies a unique posi- j
tion in the matter of establishing high
standards," explains the booklet. "It j
is the leading privately endowed uni
versity in the West. It has an onnor- !
tunity to contribute to the develop
ment of law in the vast area of the
West, where legal problems differ in j
many respects from those of the East, i
"As support must come from private 1
endowment, with no aid from state
taxation, its resources fire necessarily!
limited. Along with the rest of the
University the Law School lias there
fore been forced to adopt the policy ■
of restriction upon the members in
attendance. No more students are ac
cepted than can be properly taught."
In accordance with this policy the
Board of Trustees, on the recommenda
tion of the Law School faculty, by
resolution passed June 27, 1924, pro
vided that an A.ll. degree should there-!
after be required for admission to the
professional curriculum in law. This is
the only school west of Pennsylvania
with such a requirement for admis
sion.
Additional funds amounting to

$50,000 for the endowment of the law
library are also being solicited. Al
though the present law library is for
the most part adequate for the needs
of law students preparing for ordinary
work of practice, it is deficient for re
search work.
As part of the campaign to raise
$500,000 for the construction of a. new
Law building, a booklet containing in
formation about the project is being
sent out by the University to Stanford
law graduates, nearby lawyers, and
other interested people. The proposed
building will be situated east of the
main University library and form a
part of the new quadrangle which is
being developed.
The booklet contains illustrations of
the first and second floor plans and
sketches of the Law building which
has beer designed to meet the needs
of the school for many academic gen
erations to come. The proposed struc
ture consists of a unified group of
buildings surrounding an arcaded open
court.
Building Described
The front portion of the building
facing east will be composed of class
rooms. A two-story library and office
building in the rear is to be devoted
primarily to library stacks, a reading
room, and offices. Space is provided
for stacks on both the first and second
floors. Surrounding the stacks on the
first floor are a number of conversa
tion rooms. Offices surround the stack
rows on the second floor.
"At present the Law School is
cramped in every department," the
pamphlet states. "The quarters consist
of two buildings on the Inner Quad
rangle. One of these contains the reci
tation rooms, three in number, which
are totally inadequate. In order to
meet conditions, it has been necessary
to schedule classes at undesirable
hours during the day, and some
courses have for several years been
held in recitation rooms allotted to
other departments and situated at a
considerable distance from the offices
of the law faculty.
Books Unavailable
"The second structure contains the
library, reading room, and offices of
the faculty. Conditions here are less
satisfactory than in the recitation
rooms. In this building can be housed
only 22,000 of the more than 32,000
volumes which constitute the library.
It has been necessary to store the rest
of the books in the basement of the
Administration building, where it is
impossible to ma"ke effective use of
them. In order to crowd in the 22,000
volumes the larger part of the stack
space in the offices of members of the
faculty has been utilized and two-story
stacks have been run around the out
side walls. These stacks are sixteen
feet high, and the upper shelves can
be reached only by portable' ladders.
The efficiency of the library is thereby
greatly impaired.
"Under such conditions it is impos
sible to shelve the books satisfactorily.
Furthermore the stacks are all made
of wood, and the interior partitions of
the building arfe ordinary wood lath
and plaster, with a false ceiling of the
same construction. It is apparent that
this valuable library is subject to a
great fire hazard.
Reading Room Small
"The reading room for students can
accommodate at one time not more
than ninety of the three hundred en
rolled. The library is the student's
laboratory, and he should be urged to
make the greatest possible use of it
from the beginning of his law course.
Under present conditions the begin
ning students are practically crowded
out."
Founded in 1893, the Law School
has grown slowly but steadily until
the present attendance exceeds three
hundred. There are nine faculty resi
dent men devoting their entire time
to the work of legal instruction as ;

It has been necessary to store the rest
of the books in the basement of the
Administration building, where it is
impossible to ma"ke effective use of
them. In order to crowd in the 22,000
volumes the larger part of the stack
space in the offices of members of the
faculty has been utilized and two-story
stacks have been run around the out
side walls. These stacks are sixteen
feet high, and the upper shelves can
be reached only by portable' ladders.
The efficiency of the library is thereby
greatly impaired.
"Under such conditions it is impos
sible to shelve the books satisfactorily.
Furthermore the stacks are all made
of wood, and the interior partitions of
the building arfe ordinary wood lath
and plaster, with a false ceiling of the
same construction. It is apparent that
this valuable library is subject to a
great fire hazard.
Reading Room Small
"The reading room for students can
accommodate at one time not more
than ninety of the three hundred en
rolled. The library is the student's
laboratory, and he should be urged to
make the greatest possible use of it
from the beginning of his law course.
Under present conditions the begin
ning students are practically crowded
out."
Founded in 1893, the Law School
has grown slowly but steadily until
the present attendance exceeds three
hundred. There are nine faculty resi
dent men devoting their entire time
to the work of legal instruction as ;
well as other active practitioners who
lecture on special topics.
High Standard Set
"Stanford occupies a unique posi- j
tion in the matter of establishing high
standards," explains the booklet. "It j
is the leading privately endowed uni
versity in the West. It has an onnor- !
tunity to contribute to the develop
ment of law in the vast area of the
West, where legal problems differ in j
many respects from those of the East, i
"As support must come from private 1
endowment, with no aid from state
taxation, its resources fire necessarily!
limited. Along with the rest of the
University the Law School lias there
fore been forced to adopt the policy ■
of restriction upon the members in
attendance. No more students are ac
cepted than can be properly taught."
In accordance with this policy the
Board of Trustees, on the recommenda
tion of the Law School faculty, by
resolution passed June 27, 1924, pro
vided that an A.ll. degree should there-!
after be required for admission to the
professional curriculum in law. This is
the only school west of Pennsylvania
with such a requirement for admis
sion.
Additional funds amounting to

$50,000 for the endowment of the law
library are also being solicited. Al
though the present law library is for
the most part adequate for the needs
of law students preparing for ordinary
work of practice, it is deficient for re
search work.
