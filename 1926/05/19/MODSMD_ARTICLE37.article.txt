## Tris Speaker—American League 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is Sir Tristram of the Lake, playing manager of the Cleveland i
Indians, the team that has been upsetting the dope in the American League:
pennant race so far this year. Besides being a fine manager, a wonderful j
player, and one of Texas' leading citizens, Speaker is as versatile as any j
athlete in America, with the possible exception of Fred Stone and Doug
Fairbanks.
Having spent over half his summers in the outfield of various American
League ball parks, you would expect Tris to know something about catching
flies. He does. Probably only Tanglefoot, that great Indian player, has
caught more flies than Tris. In April, 1918, he made two unassisted double
plays.
Having been at bat nearly 2500 times, you'd expect "Spoke" to know some-1
thing about hitting a baseball. He does. The Indian Boss has struck out,
fewer times than any other major leaguer, has made over 3000 hits, and has
made more two-baggers than any other player in either league since Peter 1
Cartwright stepped oft" the first diamond fifty years ago. In one season, 1923, J
he made fifty-nine doubles, a major league record.
Having cavorted around the base paths and the outfield for twenty odd ■
seasons, you'd expect Mr. Speaker to be slowing up, wouldn't you? Last year,
when the Indians were playing the Yankees in Cleveland, this "gray-haired man,
won a game by scoring from first on a single. Slowing up? You should see him! ;
But besides being able to do all of these things, would you believe that
Tris Speaker can also ride a bucking broncho, rope and tie a calf in twenty
four seconds, shoot a round of golf in 82 or 83, break 95 out of 100 targets at
trap-shooting, and star at hunting, fishing, fly-casting, automobile-driving,!
sleight-of-hand tricks, photographic work, watch-repairing, and what have you'
A pennant for Cleveland in 1926? You "Spoke" a mouthful!
