# STANFORD MOTHERS ELECT NEW OFFICERS

### 
Mrs. J. C. Branner was elected presi
dent of the Stanford Mothers' Club at
a meeting yesterday afternoon at the
Women's clubhouse. Mrs. A. W. John
son and Mrs. R. O. Bolman were
chosen first and second vice-presidents
respectively, and Mrs. Doane was
elected treasurer.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner spoke on re
ligion at Stanford. He stated that the
Memorial Chapel has won the affec
tions of the students at Stanford.
"The congregation of the Stanford
church is a moving and changing pro
cession. Of the students registered at
Stanford at present 87 per cent have
shown a church preference," according
to Dr. Gardner.
"It seems to me," he concluded, "that
we must establish at Stanford courses
of philosophy of religion, ethics, and
comparative religion. Stanford would
be untrue to the charter and to Mrs.
Stanford if it did not uphold a chapel
on the campus."
Texas A. and M. will have a class
of practical instruction in the care of
automobiles.
