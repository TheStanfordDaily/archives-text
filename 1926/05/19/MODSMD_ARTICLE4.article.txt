# Utah Men Arrive For Contest With Campus Debaters
## 
### 
Norman L. Christianson, Utah Agri
cultural College debate manager, and
the Aggie forensic team arrived on the
campus this afternoon from Logan for
their return contest with Stanford, to
be held in the Little Theater at 8 o'clock
tomorrow night. The visiting squad
will be guests of Toyon club tonight
and tomorrow.
This will be the first of a series of de
bates with Pacific Coast universities.
Philip Cavalero and Darrell R. Parker,
Stanford speakers, will uphold the af
firmative of the question, "Resolved,
That the prohibition law should not be
amended."
Each speaker will be allowed fifteen
minutes in which to present his argu
ments, and both teams will have fifteen
minutes of rebuttal. The affirmative is
to deliver there rebuttals, while the
Utah negatives will be allowed two re
buttals. As was the case in the Stan
ford-Utah Agricultural College debate
held at Logan, January 30, an audience
decision will be taken both before and
after the arguments.
Christianson was a member of the
Utah team which was defeated by
George N. Crocker and Theodore F.
Baer, Cardinal debaters, in January on
the question, "Resolved, That the
younger generation's freedom of thought
and action is detrimental to society."
He was mainly responsible for the de
feat of the Stanford team here in 1925
on the ftiestion, "Resolved, That the
Immigration Law of 1924 be so amend
ed as to admit Japanese on the same
basis as Europeans."
Utah's debate manager, Christianson,
has represented his college in intercol
legiate debates for the past three years
and was the winner of the Utah Ex
temporaneous Speaking contest this
fall. His calm delivery, keen analysis
of the subject, and his deliberateness
may return him a victor in his third
contest against Stanford. The score is
even at the present time with both
Utah and the Cardinals winning one
debate.
