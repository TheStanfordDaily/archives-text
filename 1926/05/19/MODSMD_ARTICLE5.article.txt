# 1927 QUAD OPENS MANAGERIAL TRIALS: FOR FRESHMEN ONLY
## 
### 
All freshmen interested in becoming
members of either the business or the
editorial staffs of the 1927 Quad are re
! quested to report at the first meeting of
the year at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the
Quad office in the Old Union. This
opportunity applies only to freshmen;
and those freshmen who try out for the
staff will be eligible for selection when
the executive offices of the Quad are
Hied next June, after one year's work.
It is desired that women as well as
men try out for the work. Two sal
aried positions are reserved for women
each year. According to Robert Para
dise, manager of the 1927 Quad, there
is no reason why a woman should not
be appointed manager if her work de
serves it. Miss Marion Winchester of
the University of California was busi
ness manager of the Blue and Gold last
year.
Those trying out will be divided into
two distinct departments: the mana
gerial staff and the editorial staff. The
managerial tryoutees will carry on the
financing of the Quad by sale of books
and advertising. The editorial staff
will carry on the technical planning of
the book including such things as the
literary work, photography, and art.
Only managerial tryoutees are asked
to appear at the meeting Thursday. All
those wishing to try out for the edi
torial staff should communicate with
Robert Paradise, the Business Mana
ger, at Box 1792.
