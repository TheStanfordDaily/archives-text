# Army Horse Show Postponed Week Because Of Band
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
The Horse Show, planned for Satur
day, has been postponed until Friday,
May 28, at 1:30 o'clock. The postpone
ment was caused because the band
was unable to play due to an engage
ment with the Fiesta de las Rosas at
San Jose for the former date. In addi
tion, the postponement will give the
polo squad members more time to
practice for the events.
All Reserve Officers Training Corps
enrolled students are eligible to par
ticipate in the events, and no limit has
been set for women who wish to enter
the potato and spoon race, or the
ladies' musical chair. A large number
of women in Captain Pettigrew's class
in equitation have signified their in

for the horses will be held on Monday
at which time horses for the different
events will be decided on.
