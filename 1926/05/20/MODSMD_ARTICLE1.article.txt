Serra Plays Good Ball
The Junipero Serra nine played
tight ball, with Frank Harold pitching,
and the infield fielding with precision.
The game was played on the freshman
diamond, and the vegetation in the
infield may have stopped a good many
of what would otherwise have been
hits for Kappa Sigma.

The first score of the game came
in the last" of the first when Stevens,
who had singled and been advanced
by Farewell's hit, scored - for Kappa
Sigma on a sacrifice by Southworth.
Not again during the whole game did
they threaten, the nearest approach
to a rally being in the fourth with
Newkirk on second and Wolf on first.
Hamilton hit a liner straight over sec
ond, but Naumes, who was hugging
the bag, caught the ball and retired
the side on an easy double play.

Junipero Serra started out to gcore
in the second frame and succeeded in
advancing Harold to third and Harlow
to second, but Guthrie fanned to re
tire the side.

Negus Scores
Negus sneaked away to third base
in the third inning, and on Cullinan's
sacrifice went home for the first run.
With the score now tied 1-all, Junipero
Serra came to bat in the fourth and
hit Southworth freely, bringing in two
runs. Zipfel fanned; Harold hit;
Naumes was out; Harlow advanced
Harold to third; First Baseman Stew
art's error allowed Harold home, put
Harlow on third, and admitted Guth
rie to first. Scherer hit, scoring Har
low; Espy walked to fill the bases;
