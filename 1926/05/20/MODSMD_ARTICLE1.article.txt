Steady pitching and good fielding
were the reliable baseball combina
tion used by Junipero Serra Club yes
terday when it defeated Kappa Sigma
4 to 1.

Serra Plays Good Ball
The Junipero Serra nine played
tight ball, with Frank Harold pitching,
and the infield fielding with precision.
The game was played on the freshman
diamond, and the vegetation in the
infield may have stopped a good many
of what would otherwise have been
hits for Kappa Sigma.

The first score of the game came
in the last" of the first when Stevens,
who had singled and been advanced
by Farewell's hit, scored - for Kappa
Sigma on a sacrifice by Southworth.
Not again during the whole game did
they threaten, the nearest approach
to a rally being in the fourth with
Newkirk on second and Wolf on first.
Hamilton hit a liner straight over sec
ond, but Naumes, who was hugging
the bag, caught the ball and retired
the side on an easy double play.

Junipero Serra started out to gcore
in the second frame and succeeded in
advancing Harold to third and Harlow
to second, but Guthrie fanned to re
tire the side.

Negus Scores
Negus sneaked away to third base
in the third inning, and on Cullinan's
sacrifice went home for the first run.
With the score now tied 1-all, Junipero
Serra came to bat in the fourth and
hit Southworth freely, bringing in two
runs. Zipfel fanned; Harold hit;
Naumes was out; Harlow advanced
Harold to third; First Baseman Stew
art's error allowed Harold home, put
Harlow on third, and admitted Guth
rie to first. Scherer hit, scoring Har
low; Espy walked to fill the bases;
and then Negus fanned, retiring his
side. Cullinai) made a lone tally in the
fifth. The seventh saw Cullinan on
third and Harold on second, but Names
struck out, ending all opportunity to
score.

Guthrie at first for the winners dis
played one of the stellar exhibitions
of the afternoon, catching all kinds of
wild throws for numerous putouts.
Naumes at, second likewise sparked
with his clean fielding. Farewell played
good ball at shortstop for Kappa Sig,
and Stevens was the only fraternity
player to get two hits.

A seventh-inning rally broke a tie
score and won a decisive 7-4 victory
and a place in the finals for Sigma
Alapha Epsilon in their game with
Delta Chi yesterday. Two doubles by
MacDermott and Gibbons taken from
the weakening arm of Salzman, Delta
Chi moundsman, found men on bases
and ended a hard-fought game.

Pitching was the big point in the
game, with the edge favoring Laßue's
speedy ball. Hits were not very much
in evidence, and what few were made
belong mostly to the winning squad.

Delta Chi scored the opening run
of the game in the first when an
infield hit by Biaginni brought in
Sandys. A two-base hit by MacDermott
failed to even up the score in the sec
ond due to shut-out pitching by Salz
man with the three other batters.

Delta Chi Threatens
Delta Chi made another serious
threat in the third by putting three
men on bases. Strike-outs and short
flies prevented scoring. S.A.E. got
going again in the third, and by a
series of errors on the part of the
opposition succeeded in getting a run
ner across the plate.

Laßue's pitching entirely closed out
Delta Chi in the next round. Bledsoe,
for S.A.E., slammed out a two-base hit
and reached home on a hit by Ander
son and a poor throw by Slater, Delta
Chi third-baseman. A double play by
Frazer, Hay, and Biaginni finished the

inning.
A two-base hit by Newcomb, some
clever stealing, and a couple of sacri
fices tied the score for Delta Chi in
the sixth. Laßue managed to pull him
self out of a bad hole by doing some

strong pitching.
The game was decided in the sev
enth. Peters got to first on an error
by Hay, Todd hit a single, and Keyes
reached first on a catcher's error. Just
at this point MacDermott, the excel
lent S.A.E. catcher, decided to start
things going, and slammed out a hit
to right field which brought him to
second base and which also scored
Peters and Todd. Gibbons next stepped
to the bat and likewise laid out a
double.

Salzman made a valiant attempt to
win his own game in the last of the
seventh, stealing home from a single,
but the pitching of Laßue was alto
gether too effective for a last-mtnute
rally.
