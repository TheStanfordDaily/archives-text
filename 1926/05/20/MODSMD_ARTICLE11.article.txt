# REYNOLDS CHOSEN BY QUAD BOARD TO EDIT 1928 EDITION
## APPOINT LEWIS MANAGER Champlin, Andrews Selected To Take Positions as Women's Heads 
### 
Herbert K. Reynolds was last night
appointed by the Quad Board to edit
the 1928 Quad, with Lucia Champlin
as women's editor. Frank "Mac" Lewis
was appointed to the position of busi
ness manager, and California Andrews
to that of women's manager. The pho

Shoup.

The Quad board, which fills all posi

are attached, chose the above people

of the tryoutees was considered. The
board consists of Robert E. Lewis,
Harry L. Noland, F. Lowell Matthay,
Basil L. McGann, Robert Paradise,
Allan S. Klauber, and Helen Ritten
house.

Members of both the editorial and
managerial staffs of the Stanford Quad
are recommended by a system of trial
based on points earned by tryoutees
in doing the actual work of publishing
the annual. Points are given for each
type of work, the most important being
given a larger number in proportion.
This system is the outgrowth of many
years' experience in organizing Quad
work.

Many students started out for the
editorial staff, but only five men and
five women stayed with the work. Rey
nolds was considered the most con
sistent, having gradually increased his
ratio of work as the publishing date
neared, and helped most when the
critical last period came. Gustave A.
Mueller was the closest man to Rey
nolds in the hour score, having 364

against Reynolds' 425. Robert Frazee,
with 285, Jack Shoup, with 328, and
Martin J. Weil, with 234 points, also
worked steadily.
