# REYNOLDS CHOSEN BY QUAD BOARD TO EDIT 1928 EDITION
## APPOINT LEWIS MANAGER Champlin, Andrews Selected To Take Positions as Women's Heads 
### 
Herbert K. Reynolds was last night
appointed by the Quad Board to edit
the 1928 Quad, with Lucia Champlin
as women's editor. Frank "Mac" Lewis
was appointed to the position of busi
ness manager, and California Andrews
to that of women's manager. The pho
tographic editor will be Jack W.
Shoup.

The Quad board, which fills all posi
tions on the annual to which salaries
are attached, chose the above people
after four hours of deliberation during
which the various angles of the work
of the tryoutees was considered. The
board consists of Robert E. Lewis,
Harry L. Noland, F. Lowell Matthay,
Basil L. McGann, Robert Paradise,
Allan S. Klauber, and Helen Ritten
house.

Members of both the editorial and
managerial staffs of the Stanford Quad
are recommended by a system of trial
based on points earned by tryoutees
in doing the actual work of publishing
the annual. Points are given for each
type of work, the most important being
given a larger number in proportion.
This system is the outgrowth of many
years' experience in organizing Quad
work.

Many students started out for the
editorial staff, but only five men and
five women stayed with the work. Rey
nolds was considered the most con
sistent, having gradually increased his
ratio of work as the publishing date
neared, and helped most when the
critical last period came. Gustave A.
Mueller was the closest man to Rey
nolds in the hour score, having 364

against Reynolds' 425. Robert Frazee,
with 285, Jack Shoup, with 328, and
Martin J. Weil, with 234 points, also
worked steadily.
The choice between Lucia Cham
plin and Margaret Olsen was one of
the hardest problems the board had
to decide. Because the women had put
in almost a like number of hours,
much of the decision was based on the
work done by Miss Cliamplin in work
ing with Reynolds in putting out a
record number of pages while they
had the desk editorships.

Lewis was chosen manager out of
a group of four men left at the final
count. The race between Lewis and
Frederick A. Zitkowski was very close.
Newell Benton and Jack Ford were far
behind.

In the managerial tryouts the points
are figured on a technical basis. Book
sale, and the amount of advertising
obtained are the deciding factors.
Lewis was slightly ahead of Zitkowski
at every rating through the year, and
on all phases of the point system, al
though having but a slight margin in
each case. However, his total points,
3364, against Zitkowski's 2762, shows
the difference in the long run.

California Andrews, with 1931 points,
Anne Hartwell, with 1811, and Fay
Hamilton, with 1639, were closely
grouped in the race for women's man
ager, but the final choice went to Miss
Andrews.
The last selection made by the board
was that of photographic editor.
Shoup was chosen for this position in
view of his knowledge of photography,
an din view of the work he has done
in trying out for the editor. Shoup and
Reynolds were more familiar with the
photographic work than the others.
With Reynolds as editor, and Shoup on
photographs, the board feels this phase
of the work will be adequately han
dled.

the annual. Points are given for each
type of work, the most important being
given a larger number in proportion.
This system is the outgrowth of many
years' experience in organizing Quad
work.

Many students started out for the
editorial staff, but only five men and
five women stayed with the work. Rey
nolds was considered the most con
sistent, having gradually increased his
ratio of work as the publishing date
neared, and helped most when the
critical last period came. Gustave A.
Mueller was the closest man to Rey
nolds in the hour score, having 364

against Reynolds' 425. Robert Frazee,
with 285, Jack Shoup, with 328, and
Martin J. Weil, with 234 points, also
worked steadily.
The choice between Lucia Cham
plin and Margaret Olsen was one of
the hardest problems the board had
to decide. Because the women had put
in almost a like number of hours,
much of the decision was based on the
work done by Miss Cliamplin in work
ing with Reynolds in putting out a
record number of pages while they
had the desk editorships.

Lewis was chosen manager out of
a group of four men left at the final
count. The race between Lewis and
Frederick A. Zitkowski was very close.
Newell Benton and Jack Ford were far
behind.

In the managerial tryouts the points
are figured on a technical basis. Book
sale, and the amount of advertising
obtained are the deciding factors.
Lewis was slightly ahead of Zitkowski
at every rating through the year, and
on all phases of the point system, al
though having but a slight margin in
each case. However, his total points,
3364, against Zitkowski's 2762, shows
the difference in the long run.

California Andrews, with 1931 points,
Anne Hartwell, with 1811, and Fay
Hamilton, with 1639, were closely
grouped in the race for women's man
ager, but the final choice went to Miss
Andrews.
The last selection made by the board
was that of photographic editor.
Shoup was chosen for this position in
view of his knowledge of photography,
an din view of the work he has done
in trying out for the editor. Shoup and
Reynolds were more familiar with the
photographic work than the others.
With Reynolds as editor, and Shoup on
photographs, the board feels this phase
of the work will be adequately han
dled.
Herbert K. Reynolds was last night
appointed by the Quad Board to edit
the 1928 Quad, with Lucia Champlin
as women's editor. Frank "Mac" Lewis
was appointed to the position of busi
ness manager, and California Andrews
to that of women's manager. The pho
tographic editor will be Jack W.
Shoup.

The Quad board, which fills all posi
tions on the annual to which salaries
are attached, chose the above people
after four hours of deliberation during
which the various angles of the work
of the tryoutees was considered. The
board consists of Robert E. Lewis,
Harry L. Noland, F. Lowell Matthay,
Basil L. McGann, Robert Paradise,
Allan S. Klauber, and Helen Ritten
house.

Members of both the editorial and
managerial staffs of the Stanford Quad
are recommended by a system of trial
based on points earned by tryoutees
in doing the actual work of publishing
the annual. Points are given for each
type of work, the most important being
given a larger number in proportion.
