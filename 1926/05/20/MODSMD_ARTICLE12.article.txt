# FOUR HUNDRED MEN EXPECTED TO ENTER SPRING TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Over four hundred athletes are ex
pected to compete for the individual
high scoring honors in the spring
quarter intramural track meet, and the
times and distances now standing in
the six scheduled events are in seri
ous danger of going by the boards be
fore the onslaughts of the twenty-eight
teams entered.

The mile relay championships will
be the biggest event on the program,
and the finals will occupy all the time
devoted to the meet on the last day
of competition, Friday, May 28. The
trial heats for the relay will be held
next Wednesday.

Breakers won the relay champion
ship last year. Fifteen teams were
entered in the meet, and of this num
ber Breakers, Sigma Nu, Sigma Alpha
Rpsilon, and Theta Xi qualified for the
finals. Breakers led the field in the
final heat, setting a new record of 3
minutes, 12 2-10 seconds, breaking the
mark of 3 minutes 14 5-10 seconds set
by the Breakers the year before.

The relay consists of eight men, each
running 220 yards. Breakers have
practically the same combination that
has established a record for the past
two years, so the club team is ex
pected to take the honors again this
year.

Three track and three field events
make up the rest of the intramural
schedule. The scores of the ten high
est men in each event count toward
their team total. Points will be added
to the regular intramural point stand
ing, and the points scored by indi
vidual performers will count towards
the high-point prize. Laurence H.
Dorcy of Encina Hall won the gold
medal last year with the highest num
ber of points that has ever been to-

talled by an intramural athlete.
The hundred-yard dash and the run-
ning broad jump are the events listed
for Monday, the first day of competi-
tion. Tuesday's events are the 120-
yard low hurdles and the shot-put. The
trial heats for the relay championship
will be run off on Wednesday, and the
half-mile and discus throw will take
place on Thursday. The finals for the
relay title will conclude the meet on
Friday.
