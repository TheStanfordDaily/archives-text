# Betas Take Golf Title By Beating Kappa Sigma 5-4
## 
### 
Playing steady golf all the way, Beta
Theta Pi defeated Kappa Sigma for
the intramural links championship yes
terday afternoon, 5 up and 4 to go,
on the Emerald Lake course. Hal
Miller and Ellie Thygeson, playing for
the losers, put up a stiff fight until
the sixteenth hole, where Doug Lewis
and John Lee of the Betas gathered
brilliant par 3's to clinch the match
and the title.

The score was figured on the basis
of one point for best ball and one for
aggregate, two points being possible
on the first hole, only to have their
opponents even things up by winning
double honors on the second. From
then on it was nip and tuck, neither
team gaining a decisive advantage un
til the seventeenth. The Betas were
three up at the end of the first nine.

By virtue of their victory yesterday
the Betas gain possession for one year
of the perpetual Nielsen & Culver sil
ver golf trophy, won in 1925 by Sigma
Nu. Doug Lewis, first man on the
Beta team, also won the driving con
test held in conjunction with the in
tramural tourney, by knocking the ball
out 265 yards. He was awarded the
perpetual silver trophy donated by C.
W. Holt, secretary of the Emerald
Lake Golf Club.

In the semi-final round Monday the
Betas won from Theta Chi, repre
sented by Phil Green and Milton
Hogle. Kappa Sigma earned the right
to enter the finals by defeating the
Branner team, composed of Lawrence
Ring and Harold Trattner.

The two losers in the semi-finals
battled it out yesterday for third place
in the tourney, with Theta Chi coming
out on top, and Branner taking fourth
honors.
