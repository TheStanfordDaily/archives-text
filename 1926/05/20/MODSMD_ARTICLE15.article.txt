# TRYOUTEES FOR QUAD BUSINESS STAFF TO MEET THIS EVENING
## 
### 
All freshmen trying out for mana
gerial and editorial'positions on the
1927 Stanford Quad will meet this eve
ning with Robert Paradise, 1927 busi
ness manager, in the Quad office in
the Old Union.

The cost of publishing one issue of
the Quad totals $22,000, all of which
is handled through the managerial de
partment, the expense being borne by
advertising, sale of books, and group

pictures.
There will be little actual work per
formed by the managerial department
this quarter, as it will merely be a
period to get the tryoutees started.
