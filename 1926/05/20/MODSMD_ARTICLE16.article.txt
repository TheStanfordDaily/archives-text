# GALLERY EXHIBITING JAPANESE SCROLL
## 
### 
The Art Gallery is at present ex
hibiting a Japanese art scroll of the
eighteenth century. The scroll is a
pictorial biography of Iyeasu, military
ruler of Japan who died in 1616.

Tanyu, the artist, is a representative
of the idealist school, which originated
and flourished during the centuries
when Japan maintained her integrity
shut off from the rest of the world.
Life as it was was not acceptable to
the idealists, and they never copied
nature, but rather enhanced it. The
idea of biography in pictorial form
was a common one with the Japanese
as a whole.
