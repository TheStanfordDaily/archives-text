# The 						Fight Is On

The victory of Congressman \ are in the Pennsylvania Republican
Senatorial primary is the first important indication that prohibition is
destined to become the leading political question of the near future. As
is pointed out by Arthur S. Henning, special correspondent for the San
Francisco Chronicle, "The beer and light wine issue now becomes a lead
ing, if not paramount, issue in the election of Senators and Congressmen
this year, and is not unlikely to be projected into the presidential election
of 1928." Vare was the victor Wednesday over Governor Pinchot and
Senator Pepper by a goodly plurality, and his greatest boost was his stand
on the modification of prohibition. The other candidates were undoubt
edly more experienced, and had the backing of powerful machines.
Although both the Republicans and Democrats are reluctant it seems
inevitable that the question will soon be a partisan one. Prohibition polls
and the recent Pennsylvania primary prove that the matter is ready for a
show-down.
At the present time neither of the two existing parties have issues of
as great importance as the one which is looming; but whether either one
could take a stand on prohibition without causing a split in its ranks is a
problem. The Republicans of Pennsylvania have made the first move;
but only in the primaries. Perhaps it will be carried further and we will
find the Republicans universally in favor of modification, and the Demo
crats in favor of enforcement. If so there will be a swapping of backing,
for there is nothing to show that either party is chiefly wet or chiefly dry.
If the Republican and Democratic parties persist in avoiding the issue
it is altogether possible that their prominence will be assumed by two other
parties which will face the question of prohibition squarely. The Ameri
can public should welcome the day when the problem is settled. I here
has been enough dickering.
