# "The Stanford Daily"
## 
### 
Among the issues that will be presented to the students at the Spring
election is an amendment requiring that the name of the Daily Palo Alto
be changed to "The Stanford Daily."
It has for some time been felt by those connected with the paper that a
better title could be applied. The present name does not indicate to an
outsider that the journal is anyway connected with Stanford University;
and besides some confusion has resulted because of the similar designa
tion of the campus and town paper â€”the former the Daily Palo Alto and
the latter the Daily Palo Alto Times. The Times could not change its
name without entirely losing identity with the community for which it is
published.
The petition asking that the title be changed was initiated by members
of the editorial and business staffs of the Daily who feel, as probably do
most students, a sentimental regard for the present name. It has adorned
the issues for more than thirty years, and has been contracted into a con
venient nickname. Yet the staff workers see the advantages of a different
title, and have asked that the sentimental be disregarded for the practical.

Naive statement opens high-pressure advertising campaign. Reed Col
lege Quest:
"The purpose of Reed Day is to advertise the school to prospective college
students of the vicinity, so that they will know such a school as Reed exists."

Gilbert Keith Chesterton unburdens himself on the matter of journal
ism. The Boston College Heights:
"In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong
thing that he never thinks of saying anything else."

Seductive devices of the eternal female apprehended at Denver by the
aid of up-to-date psychological methods:
"Nine co-eds out of every ten seek education not as a training for a career,
but think college is only an aid in securing a husband," Professor Phillips of the
psychology department of Denver University says. His warning to young men
is: "There is not one co-ed in ten who has not designs to lead you to the altar."

Intelligence forges ahead at the University of Minnesota:
Asa result of tests conducted at the University it was found that the stu
dents who elect to sit in the front rows of a classroom are on the average better
students than those who choose the bark of the room.
