FIRE!
The flames rush up into the air,
The brothers grab their shirts and ties,
The fire bell rings, the siren toots,
And peans of thanksgiving rise.
But what the hell? A house afire
Seems small occasion to rejoice!
"Quite true —but in this special case
Conditions differ" says a voice.
For now the house will be repaired;
Indeed, it may be painted too.
The last sufficient quite to pay
For in-con-ve-ni-en-ces few.
The other boys upon the row
Stand by with envy in their breasts —
And plot to borrow gasoline
• To renovate their coats and vests.
Of course if this petroleum
Derivative should conflagrate,
'Twould be unfortunate, but then
'Twould be the working out of fate.
And so no more in peaceful sleep
The firemen here will spend their days
And nights —but busy dousing fires
And eating smoke and all such ways. —F.T.M
