# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In all probability it may be con
sidered presumptious for one that has
completed his college career to mingle
with campus questions of the present
time. However, I cannot help but com
ment on recent articles appearing in
the daily press regarding the proposi
tion to abolish captains from all ath
letic teams.

I am not at all surprised at the
course of events regarding this ques
tion. University life has always inter
ested me and I have been following
affairs at Stanford for some time; and
the more thought I put on this recent
question that was once voted on, the
more I am convinced that the insti
gators of the movement are political
and not altruistic in purpose.

I feel that if the students that are
behind this move were carefully in
vestigated, their friends and associ
ates, the fact that the move is a
political one would be very apparent.
One group that is sponsoring this
move have never been on an athletic
team in active competition. They do
not know the meaning of discipline
that is necessary. If leaders are not
necessary and expedient in the vari
ous pursuits of life I will grant that
the training of morons might just as
well start in the universities of our
nation.

Another group supporting the aboli
tion move are athletes but are men
whose principles are tainted with
puny politics. For the sake of friends
who have been disappointed they are
willing to sacrifice an ideal and a fine
necessary tradition. If this last sen
tence is too veiled, the fable of the
fox and the grapes will carry my point.

The whole question of captaincy
abolition is one of the evils that come
with success in athletics. It is the
same in government—when the ad
ministration is laboring under the
duress of reverses they idolije their
leaders even though inefficient. With
the return of success the radicals pre
pare to slash and spare no institution
or ideal regardless of the good it will
do.

The sponsors of this inane, selfish,
and assinine "reform" should consider
the good of the University and not
their friends' selfish disappointments.

If you see fit you may publish this
as a whole but not in part. I will not
address further communications to
your office so will thereby not trouble
you further with an outsider's view
point. I remain yours sincerely,
J. B. Johnson.

The Editor, Sir:
We have with us again a group of
petitioners with a petition. A new idea
has been born. I hope every student in
college goes to the polls on Tuesday
to vote down the non-election of cap
tains idea. Some fellows have a hard
time putting In their twenty-four hours
every day. Conceding this, why abolish
captains? There is no pressing need
for it, or else it would have come
about long before this. Besides, this is
a very matter-of-fact place anyhow,
and any honor that may come to one
is a deserved reward for his efforts;
the reward is rarely misplaced.

In sports in universities, the glam
our and feeling play a major part.
Take away the captains and you lose
much of this. We have known cap
tains from the days we chose up sides
on the vacant lot. In competition one
side has to,, lose. If it. happens our
team loses, it is no reflection on the

captain. It is on his account we do as
well as we do. The other side has a
captain. I admire fellows who go out
and do things, but I cannot say much
for those who go out to undo things.

sidered presumptious for one that has
completed his college career to mingle
with campus questions of the present
time. However, I cannot help but com
ment on recent articles appearing in
the daily press regarding the proposi
tion to abolish captains from all ath
letic teams.

I am not at all surprised at the
course of events regarding this ques
tion. University life has always inter
ested me and I have been following
affairs at Stanford for some time; and
the more thought I put on this recent
question that was once voted on, the
more I am convinced that the insti
gators of the movement are political
and not altruistic in purpose.

I feel that if the students that are
behind this move were carefully in
vestigated, their friends and associ
ates, the fact that the move is a
political one would be very apparent.
One group that is sponsoring this
move have never been on an athletic
team in active competition. They do
not know the meaning of discipline
that is necessary. If leaders are not
necessary and expedient in the vari
ous pursuits of life I will grant that
the training of morons might just as
well start in the universities of our
nation.

Another group supporting the aboli
tion move are athletes but are men
whose principles are tainted with
puny politics. For the sake of friends
who have been disappointed they are
willing to sacrifice an ideal and a fine
necessary tradition. If this last sen
tence is too veiled, the fable of the
fox and the grapes will carry my point.

The whole question of captaincy
abolition is one of the evils that come
with success in athletics. It is the
same in government—when the ad
ministration is laboring under the
duress of reverses they idolije their
leaders even though inefficient. With
the return of success the radicals pre
pare to slash and spare no institution
or ideal regardless of the good it will
do.

The sponsors of this inane, selfish,
and assinine "reform" should consider
the good of the University and not
their friends' selfish disappointments.

If you see fit you may publish this
as a whole but not in part. I will not
address further communications to
your office so will thereby not trouble
you further with an outsider's view
point. I remain yours sincerely,
J. B. Johnson.

The Editor, Sir:
We have with us again a group of
petitioners with a petition. A new idea
has been born. I hope every student in
college goes to the polls on Tuesday
to vote down the non-election of cap
tains idea. Some fellows have a hard
time putting In their twenty-four hours
every day. Conceding this, why abolish
captains? There is no pressing need
for it, or else it would have come
about long before this. Besides, this is
a very matter-of-fact place anyhow,
and any honor that may come to one
is a deserved reward for his efforts;
the reward is rarely misplaced.

In sports in universities, the glam
our and feeling play a major part.
Take away the captains and you lose
much of this. We have known cap
tains from the days we chose up sides
on the vacant lot. In competition one
side has to,, lose. If it. happens our
team loses, it is no reflection on the

captain. It is on his account we do as
well as we do. The other side has a
captain. I admire fellows who go out
and do things, but I cannot say much
for those who go out to undo things.
