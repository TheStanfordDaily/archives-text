# FRESHMEN RETURN LOST SILVERWARE, CROCKERY IN HURRY
## 
### 
Encina Commons regained a
large amount of silverware and
crockery last week when it
was announced at dinner that the
sponsors had gone through all
the rooms in the hall Wednesday
afternoon while the freshmen
were working at the Convalescent
Home and had made a list of the
tableware belonging to the Uni
versity. found in each room.
Opportunity was given those
who had made collections of
dishes and spoons to return them
immediately. Within a half hour
after the close of the meal six
teen salt cellars, three or four
dozen glasses, a bushel or so of
knives and forks and a large
number of plates and saucers bad
been collected, with further loot
continually coming in.
The raid failed, however, to
bring back most of the plates
taken, as their fate was met at
the crockery bouncing experi
ments which are conducted each
evening at the hall after 10 p.m.
