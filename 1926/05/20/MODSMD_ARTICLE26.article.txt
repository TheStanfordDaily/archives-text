# 1926 I.C. 4-A MEET MARKS 50 YEARS OF TRACK COMPETITION

This year will mark the fiftieth an
niversary of the first annual cham
pionship track and field meet held by
the Intercollegiate Association of Ama
teur Athletes of America at Saratoga,
New York, in 1876. This meet has
gradually grown from a meet of merely
local importance to an affair of na
tional scope with teams entering from
Maine to California.

Since the beginning of the cham
pionship meets only eight of the forty
one colleges which have scored points
have been able to win the champion
ship. While it is seventeen years since
Harvard has won, the Crimson holds
the greatest number of victories, thir
teen. Yale comes next with ten, and
the University of Pennsylvania and
Cornell University have won the
trophy nine times each. Although Har
vard has won the most team cham
pionships, Yale has outscored the
Crimson 868 points to 762.

The Columbia University teams have
run away with the trophy on three
occasions, while the University of
California has done likewise. From a
Far West standpoint it is extremely
interesting that in the five years that
Far Western teams have competed
regularly, four championships have
been won, and in the only year that
the East was victorius Stanford fin
ished a mere three points behind the
victor. Incidentally, the two teams
which have each won only one vic
tory, Princeton and Southern Califor
nia, won, respectively, the first and
last meets to be held.

After the first meet at Saratoga,
New York City was awarded the meet
until 1903, when it was decided to
alternate the scene of the meet be
tween Harvard and Franklin Field,
Philadelphia.

Princeton University had the honor
of winning the first championship with
25 points to its credit. The program
that year consisted of a 100-yard dash
which was won in 11 seconds, a 440-
yard dash which was won in 56 sec
onds, an 880-yard run won in 2 min
utes, 16 1-2 seconds, a one-mile run
won in 4 minutes, 58 1-2 seconds, a
120-vard hurdle race won in 18 1-3
seconds, running broad-jump won with
a leap of 20 feet 3 1-2 inches, running
high-jump won at 5 feet, 4 inches, and
16-pound shot put won by a heave
of 30 feet 11 1-2 inches.

Since the first championships many
changes have been made in the pro
gram. In 1877, the 220-yard dash, the
hammer throw, pole-vault, and one
mile walk were added, and all but the
last is still on the program, it being
dropped in 1898. The 220-yard low hur
dles was added in 1888 and the two
mile run in 1899. The most recent addi
tions are the discus and javelin throws
which were first used in 1922. Among
the events held at one time or another
were the standing high-jump, tug-of
war, two-mile bicycle race, and other
bicycle races of varying length.
