## 
### 
Strikes in general and tlie British
strike in particular will be the subject
of Dr. Jordan's lecture to be given
this evening at his home. He will talk
upon the different phases of strike,
their whys and wherefores.
"Strikes are a great economic loss,"

says Dr. Jordan. "The strikers aro
either trying to pinch their employers
or the people, and generally every
body suffers. In the words of economic)
experts, a general strike is general
foolishness, and as such is foredoomed
to failure. They should be met and
planned for in advance. That is one
of the things that is wrong with th&
English method of handling strikes.
They wait for the crisis to come in
stead of planning to meet it."
