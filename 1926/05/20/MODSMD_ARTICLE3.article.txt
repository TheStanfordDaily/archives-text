## 
### 
After an hour of heated argument,
members of the Euphronia Debating
Society, by a two to one vote, last
night decided that H. L. Mencken's
attitude towards the American public
is harmful.

In attacking the editor of the Ameri
can Mercury, Leonard H. Kirkpatrick
declared. "Mr. Mencken likes to over
turn tables to hear the crash, to bump
heads to see the bruises, to tear down
learning for self-advertising purposes.
He can give you lessons in cynicism
and contempt, but the modern reader
is unwilling to accept a single remedy
for any of the evils he points out.
"Causes Headaches"

"He has been characterized by an
attitude of destructive criticism, he
has torn down our antiquated shacks
of learning and has given us nothing
in their place. I greatly doubt if
Mencken has ever given anything save
headaches to the American public."
Upholding the writings of Mencken,
George N. Crocker, former president
of Euphronia, said, "There is nothing

the people of the United States need
more today than some critic like H. L.
Mencken who will stand up in their
midst and sow their faults. He has a
passionate hatred of hokum, bunkum,
and twaddle, and he vigorously at
tacks it.

"f6 Powerful Reformer"
"He may be superficial in his treat
ment, greatly conceited, and destruc
tive, but Mencken is one of the most
powerful reformers in the United
States today and we are impressed by
the kernels of truth found in his

work."
