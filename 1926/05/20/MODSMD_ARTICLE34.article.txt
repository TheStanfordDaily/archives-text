# GLORIFYING THE AMERICAN GIRL
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
"Whom would you rather draw than
Dempsey?" a friend of mine inquired
the day. "Wills, of course," I
answered, "and I don't mean Harry
Wills, either!" So here is The Queen
of the Courts again, ready to play in
the Franco-American team matches
next week and then, on June 2, in the
French hard court championships. The
conclusion is, of course, that she will
meet Suzanne in the latter tourna
ment, and then, perhaps, the "Lenglen
trail" that has been a-winding its way
from victory to victory in Europe ever

since the war will come to an abrupt
end.
Look at Helen! Isn't she a beauty?
My idea of a good assignment would
be to draw Helen Wills six days a
week. Helen of Troy, that famous
dame who owned "the face that
launched a thousand ships," never
graced the courts of Sparta or Troy
as well as this modern Helen, of
Berkeley, graces the courts upon which
she plays tennis as few men can play
it.
Have you ever seen Helen Wills play
at Forest Hills? No matter how severe

[ the competition, or how hot the [
j weather ,she never seems to get the
j slightest bit excited or ruffled. Now
and then she takes the handkerchief
! out of her middy-blouse pocket and
dabs at her demure, placid face with it
| â€”and the next instant she is sending
j over a booming drive that would do
credit to Billy Johnston. Flo Ziegfeld
' should sign her up. She never loses
that dainty look and perfect poise, and
is far prettier and more graceful than
many a so-called dancer that you see
on the stage.
My friend Edwin Levick, the New

York photographer, tells me that of all
the many tennis stars he has "shot,"
on and off the courts, none was so
gracious or condescending, or so grate
ful for a gift of the finished photos, as
Little Miss Poker Face herself.
Isn't it tough luck to be just twenty,
to be young and beautiful, and the
second best girl tennis player in the
world, and to travel all around, playing
in tournaments, winning cups and
medals and other prizes, and meeting
kings and dukes and princes!
"The Woman Pays" should be
changed to "The Woman Plays."
