# ENGLISH CLASS GIVES GOOD PRESENTATION OF ONE-ACT DRAMAS
## 'Overtones,' 'Tents of Arabs Bring Out Talents of Student Cast 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
"Overtones" and "The Tents of the
Arabs," two one-act plays produced in
open session of English 19b yesterday
in the Little Theatre were exception
ally well done by the class members
composing the casts. Both plays are
of a nature not often presented on
the American stage. Attention was
placed upon dramatization, and the
two were given without costumes,
make-up, or scenery. In spite of this
lack, the plays were gripping and car
ried the listener completely into the
spirit of their plots.

The first play, "Overtones," by Alice
Gerstenberg, deals with two women in
conversation, each one attended by
her inner self, or overtone. The sharp
contrast between what was said and
what was thought was vividly brought
out by the interchange of conversation
between principles and overtones.
Helen Cooper as Harriet, who had mar
ried for money, was convincingly cast,
and upheld the subtlety of difference
between her outer and inner feejings.
Burks Finished Actor

Aileen Burks as her overtone, Hetty,
portrayed in a finished manner the
despair which would naturally be felt
within such a woman. Her part called
for an ability to carry the thought by
slight movements of her body, since
the majority of her lines were given
from beneath a veil.

Margaret, played by Alice Solinger,
was the woman, poor and miserable,
who had married for love. She in
vested her characterization with dis
tinct reality. Her overtone, Maggie,
played by Margaret White, completed
the cast. Miss Solinger and Miss White
showed equal talent with their parts,
each bringing out in every word the
latent possibilities of desperation
which the author had vested in them.
A great deal of credit is due Helen
Lewis, who directed the play.

Ruth Minskey Outstanding
The second production, "The "fents
of the Arabs," by Lord Dunsany, deals
with a king who escapes his throne
and leaves it to a camel driver, so
that he can wander in the desert with
his love, the gypsy girl. Miss Ruth
Minskey as the gypsy stood out sharp
ly with her grace and the depth of
feeling shown by the reading of her
lines. She seemed aware of the inner
feelings of a gypsy, and developed th«
characterization in a convincing
fashion.
Reidar Torjussen, as the chamber
lain, developed his character well, as
did Herbert Boomer as Bel-Narb, the
usurping king. Charles Moore as the
King carried his part, with a little
more diciculty, but managed it nicely,
portraying the King's desire for the
desert. Harris Skelton and Edward
Sibbett were well cast. William Thorn
ton directed the production.

lain, developed his character well, as
did Herbert Boomer as Bel-Narb, the
usurping king. Charles Moore as the
King carried his part, with a little
more diciculty, but managed it nicely,
portraying the King's desire for the
desert. Harris Skelton and Edward
Sibbett were well cast. William Thorn
ton directed the production.
"Overtones" and "The Tents of the
Arabs," two one-act plays produced in
open session of English 19b yesterday
in the Little Theatre were exception
ally well done by the class members
composing the casts. Both plays are
of a nature not often presented on
the American stage. Attention was
placed upon dramatization, and the
two were given without costumes,
make-up, or scenery. In spite of this
lack, the plays were gripping and car
ried the listener completely into the
spirit of their plots.

The first play, "Overtones," by Alice
Gerstenberg, deals with two women in
conversation, each one attended by
her inner self, or overtone. The sharp
contrast between what was said and
what was thought was vividly brought
out by the interchange of conversation
between principles and overtones.
Helen Cooper as Harriet, who had mar
ried for money, was convincingly cast,
and upheld the subtlety of difference
between her outer and inner feejings.
Burks Finished Actor

Aileen Burks as her overtone, Hetty,
portrayed in a finished manner the
despair which would naturally be felt
within such a woman. Her part called
for an ability to carry the thought by
slight movements of her body, since
the majority of her lines were given
from beneath a veil.

Margaret, played by Alice Solinger,
was the woman, poor and miserable,
who had married for love. She in
vested her characterization with dis
tinct reality. Her overtone, Maggie,
played by Margaret White, completed
the cast. Miss Solinger and Miss White
showed equal talent with their parts,
each bringing out in every word the
latent possibilities of desperation
which the author had vested in them.
A great deal of credit is due Helen
Lewis, who directed the play.

Ruth Minskey Outstanding
The second production, "The "fents
of the Arabs," by Lord Dunsany, deals
with a king who escapes his throne
and leaves it to a camel driver, so
that he can wander in the desert with
his love, the gypsy girl. Miss Ruth
Minskey as the gypsy stood out sharp
ly with her grace and the depth of
feeling shown by the reading of her
lines. She seemed aware of the inner
feelings of a gypsy, and developed th«
characterization in a convincing
fashion.
Reidar Torjussen, as the chamber
lain, developed his character well, as
did Herbert Boomer as Bel-Narb, the
usurping king. Charles Moore as the
King carried his part, with a little
more diciculty, but managed it nicely,
portraying the King's desire for the
desert. Harris Skelton and Edward
