# FRIDAY, MAY 28, SET AS DATE OF ANNUAL WOMEN'S FIELD DAY
## 
### 
i Women's Field Day will be held on
Friday, May 28, this year, instead of
on Saturday, as has been the custom
. in the past, Helen Lease announced
i at the W.AA. board meeting last eve
, ning. The date was changed because of
, several conflicts with other University
j activities.

The new date may conflict. Miss
Lease reported, with the competitive
drill in gymnastics which is to be held
on Friday. The drill may, however, be
incorporated in the field day activities.
Mrs. Greta Brandsten of the physical
education department is in charge of
the drill.
A program for the field day was con
sidered by the board, and provisionally
approved. Miss Lease was given full
power to change the program.
