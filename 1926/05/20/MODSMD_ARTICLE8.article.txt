# Stanford Power In East Depends On Field Events
## 
### Clif Moore 
Points made in the field events will
be a deciding factor in Stanford's bid
for the track and field title in the
1.C.4-A meet at Cambridge, May 28
and 29. The Cardinals are conceded a
small number of points in the track
events, but the markers garnered in
the field will have the greatest effect
upon Stanford's chances for the inter
collegiate track crown.

The Cardinal is represented by at
least one star in each of the field
events. Biff Hoffman carries a double
responsibility in being entered in both
the shot-put and the discus. The Stan
ford weight star will compete for the
third time this year against Bud Hou
ser, the Trojan champion, and he is
expected to make an even better show
ing in the East than he has made in
the other meets this season. Gerkin
of California will also be a strong con
tender.

Broad Jump Important
The broad ju&p assumes great im
portance from the West's point of view
because of the stellar athletes that will
represent the coast in that event.
Bondshu of California, holder of the
new P.C.C. record of 24 feet 2 3-4
inches, is one of the finest jumpers
entered in the meet. Sid Meeks, who
took second place last Saturday with
a leap of 24 feet, will place up with
the outstanding broad-jumpers in the
country. Dick Macßae of Stanford is
a great competitive athlete, and can
be expected to be right among the
stars in the battle for first place.
Captain Norton, of Yale, who won
the broad jump last year, leaped 23
feet 11 inches. The marks made on the
coast this year have not been equalled
by Easter jumpers, and because of
this the coast stars are the favorites
to take the majority of points.
Bob King has proved on several oc
casions this year that he is the class
of Western high-jumpers, and his work
in the East should not fall below his
marks established this year. King is

cppable, of clearing the bar at better
than 6 feet 4 inches, and under the
stress of stiff competition, should make
an even better height. Tom Work did
nearly 6 feet 6 inches in the P.C.C.
last year, and if lie comes out of his
slump, can be counted upon to make a
great showing at Cambridge.
Work has jumped off a dead leg all
season, and even with this handicap,
he succeeded in getting over the bar
at (? feet 3 inches in the Big Meet.
King and Work form a great combina-
tion, and if things go right in the East
they should place high in their favo
rite event.
Ross Has Chance

Chet Ross is the only Stanford en
trant in the pole vault, but his per
formances in past meets have shown
that he can be counted upon to make a
great battle for the honors. Lee
Barnes, star U.S.C. vaulter, will un
doubtedly win the event, and Hill of
California will also be in the running.

Plarlow is the favorite to win first
place in the javelin throw, his mark
of 201 feet 2 1-2 inches in the confer
ence meet being the best collegiate
rcord made in the United States this
year. Ted Shipkey should be right be
hind the Cardinal ace, and their marks
will doubtless give the East a great
deal to talk about.

Stanford's main rival for the inter
collegiate title will be Dean Cromwell's
U.S.C. athletes. The Trojans are
superior to any other team in the
country in the weight events, and the

pole vault, and Cromwell's hurdlers,
Dye, Grumbles, and Reynolds, are
among the best. The Trojans also
have strength in the sprints, high
jump, and javelin, and their total of
points should be mighty close to the
Stanford score. California must also
be considered as a strong contender,
but Walter Christie's team cannot be
rated alongside the Cardinals and the
Trojans.'

jump, and javelin, and their total of
points should be mighty close to the
Stanford score. California must also
be considered as a strong contender,
but Walter Christie's team cannot be
rated alongside the Cardinals and the
Trojans.'
Points made in the field events will
be a deciding factor in Stanford's bid
for the track and field title in the
1.C.4-A meet at Cambridge, May 28
and 29. The Cardinals are conceded a
small number of points in the track
events, but the markers garnered in
the field will have the greatest effect
upon Stanford's chances for the inter
collegiate track crown.

The Cardinal is represented by at
least one star in each of the field
events. Biff Hoffman carries a double
responsibility in being entered in both
the shot-put and the discus. The Stan
ford weight star will compete for the
third time this year against Bud Hou
ser, the Trojan champion, and he is
expected to make an even better show
ing in the East than he has made in
the other meets this season. Gerkin
of California will also be a strong con
tender.

Broad Jump Important
The broad ju&p assumes great im
portance from the West's point of view
because of the stellar athletes that will
represent the coast in that event.
Bondshu of California, holder of the
new P.C.C. record of 24 feet 2 3-4
inches, is one of the finest jumpers
entered in the meet. Sid Meeks, who
took second place last Saturday with
a leap of 24 feet, will place up with
the outstanding broad-jumpers in the
country. Dick Macßae of Stanford is
a great competitive athlete, and can
be expected to be right among the
stars in the battle for first place.
Captain Norton, of Yale, who won
the broad jump last year, leaped 23
feet 11 inches. The marks made on the
coast this year have not been equalled
by Easter jumpers, and because of
this the coast stars are the favorites
to take the majority of points.
Bob King has proved on several oc
casions this year that he is the class
of Western high-jumpers, and his work
in the East should not fall below his
marks established this year. King is

cppable, of clearing the bar at better
than 6 feet 4 inches, and under the
stress of stiff competition, should make
an even better height. Tom Work did
nearly 6 feet 6 inches in the P.C.C.
last year, and if lie comes out of his
slump, can be counted upon to make a
great showing at Cambridge.
Work has jumped off a dead leg all
season, and even with this handicap,
he succeeded in getting over the bar
at (? feet 3 inches in the Big Meet.
King and Work form a great combina-
tion, and if things go right in the East
they should place high in their favo
rite event.
Ross Has Chance

Chet Ross is the only Stanford en
trant in the pole vault, but his per
formances in past meets have shown
that he can be counted upon to make a
great battle for the honors. Lee
Barnes, star U.S.C. vaulter, will un
doubtedly win the event, and Hill of
California will also be in the running.

Plarlow is the favorite to win first
place in the javelin throw, his mark
of 201 feet 2 1-2 inches in the confer
ence meet being the best collegiate
rcord made in the United States this
year. Ted Shipkey should be right be
hind the Cardinal ace, and their marks
will doubtless give the East a great
deal to talk about.

Stanford's main rival for the inter
collegiate title will be Dean Cromwell's
U.S.C. athletes. The Trojans are
superior to any other team in the
country in the weight events, and the

pole vault, and Cromwell's hurdlers,
Dye, Grumbles, and Reynolds, are
among the best. The Trojans also
have strength in the sprints, high
jump, and javelin, and their total of
points should be mighty close to the
Stanford score. California must also
be considered as a strong contender,
but Walter Christie's team cannot be
rated alongside the Cardinals and the
Trojans.'
