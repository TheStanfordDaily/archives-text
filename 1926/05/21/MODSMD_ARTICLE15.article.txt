# CARDINAL TEAM OEF TO I.C. 4-A TILT TOMORROW
## Twelve Track Men Depart In Morning for National College Event STORIE NOT TO LEAVE Will Hold Workout at Stagg Field in Chicago on Way East 
### Clif Moore 
Stanford's hopes for victory in
the 1.C.-4A suffered a severe set
back this morning with the an
nouncement that Bill Storie, quar
ter-miler, will not make the trip,
because of the serious illness of
his wife. Storie was doped to take
two or three points, and his ab
sence may enable U.S.C. to beat
out the Cards by a slim margin.
This is the third successive year
that he has been prevented at the
last moment from accompanying
the track team on an Eastern trip.
His own illness forced him to with
draw in 1924 and 1925.

Twelve redshirt runners embark
for Cambridge tomorrow on the 9
o'clock train to represent Stanford in
the annual 1.C.-4A track and field
championships to be held in the Har
vard stadium May 28 and 29. Teams
representing every major university
in the United States will be entered,
and it is expected that this meet will
be the greatest in history.

Stanford, California, and U.S.C. will
ably represent the West in the titular
meet. Coach Dink Templeton's strong
Cardinal varsity is the favorite to cop
the intercollegiate title, and the U.S.C.
Trojans are expected to finish close
behind Stanford in the battle for top
honors. California is not rated as high
ly as the other two Western teams, but
Coach Christie's team should give the
Easterners a great fight for third place.
Will Train Enroute
The Cardinal athletes will take a
light workout at Stagg Field in Chi
cago enroute to Cambridge. Prelimi
naries in every event will be held in
the Harvard stadium on Friday, and
the finals are scheduled for Saturday.

Captain Bill Richardson is the Stan
ford entrant in the half-mile, and the
Cardinal leader is recognized as the
greatest two-lap runner in the United
States, and is the reigning favorite to
cop the intercollegiate title in the
Eastern meet. Tempieton's two great
I quarter-railers, Ted Miller and Larry
I Babcock, are expected to give the
! Eastern athletes some stiff competi
i tion in the one-lap event. Miller holds
| every Pacific Coast record in his fa
vorite race, and is regarded as one of
! the strongest bidders for the top lion
! ors in the East.
West to Hurdle
Clarence West is the only Cardinal
hurdler making the trip. West is a
.fine performer in the high barriers and
should give Dye of U.S.C., the favo
rite for first place, a hard battle. West
is not so strong in the low sticks, but
if he keeps his feet near the finish of
the race, he should come in among
the winners.
Stanford appears to be especially
strong in the field, and the Cardinals
are counted upon to amass enough
points in this department to sway the
margin of victory in Tempieton's fa
vor. Biff Hoffman will compete in both
weight events, and should give Bud
Houser of U. S. C. and Gerkin of Cali
fornia plenty of competition.
Sid Meeks and Dick Macßae are
entered in the broad jump, and to
gether with Bondshu of California, are
rated as the best jumpers in the coun
try. Meeks is credited with the best
distance that has ever been made by
a Stanford jumper, and if he repeats
his mark of 24 feet in the Eastern
meet he should be one of the strongest
contenders for the title.
Two Stanford high-jumpers will rep
resent Stanford in the East. Bob King
and Tom Work should make a great
showing and the former is expected
to win a first place in the intercolle
giates. Both Stanford stars are capable
of better than 6 feet 4 inches.
Ross to Vault
Chet Ross has proven that he is one
of the greatest of Stanford's competi
tive athletes, and he should come
through with exhibition in the pole
vault. Lee Barnes of U.S.C. is con
ceded the first place, but Ross is
capable of being right among the fin
est in any meet.

1 Harlow and Shipkey are regarded
as the greatest javelin throwers in the
country. Both are able to toss the
spear over 190 feet, which is plenty
good enough to beat the other javelin
throwers in the meet. Harlow sailed
the spear 201 feet in the P.C.C. meet
last Saturday.

representing every major university
in the United States will be entered,
and it is expected that this meet will
be the greatest in history.

Stanford, California, and U.S.C. will
ably represent the West in the titular
meet. Coach Dink Templeton's strong
Cardinal varsity is the favorite to cop
the intercollegiate title, and the U.S.C.
Trojans are expected to finish close
behind Stanford in the battle for top
honors. California is not rated as high
ly as the other two Western teams, but
Coach Christie's team should give the
Easterners a great fight for third place.
Will Train Enroute
The Cardinal athletes will take a
light workout at Stagg Field in Chi
cago enroute to Cambridge. Prelimi
naries in every event will be held in
the Harvard stadium on Friday, and
the finals are scheduled for Saturday.

Captain Bill Richardson is the Stan
ford entrant in the half-mile, and the
Cardinal leader is recognized as the
greatest two-lap runner in the United
States, and is the reigning favorite to
cop the intercollegiate title in the
Eastern meet. Tempieton's two great
I quarter-railers, Ted Miller and Larry
I Babcock, are expected to give the
! Eastern athletes some stiff competi
i tion in the one-lap event. Miller holds
| every Pacific Coast record in his fa
vorite race, and is regarded as one of
! the strongest bidders for the top lion
! ors in the East.
West to Hurdle
Clarence West is the only Cardinal
hurdler making the trip. West is a
.fine performer in the high barriers and
should give Dye of U.S.C., the favo
rite for first place, a hard battle. West
is not so strong in the low sticks, but
if he keeps his feet near the finish of
the race, he should come in among
the winners.
Stanford appears to be especially
strong in the field, and the Cardinals
are counted upon to amass enough
points in this department to sway the
margin of victory in Tempieton's fa
vor. Biff Hoffman will compete in both
weight events, and should give Bud
Houser of U. S. C. and Gerkin of Cali
fornia plenty of competition.
Sid Meeks and Dick Macßae are
entered in the broad jump, and to
gether with Bondshu of California, are
rated as the best jumpers in the coun
try. Meeks is credited with the best
distance that has ever been made by
a Stanford jumper, and if he repeats
his mark of 24 feet in the Eastern
meet he should be one of the strongest
contenders for the title.
Two Stanford high-jumpers will rep
resent Stanford in the East. Bob King
and Tom Work should make a great
showing and the former is expected
to win a first place in the intercolle
giates. Both Stanford stars are capable
of better than 6 feet 4 inches.
Ross to Vault
Chet Ross has proven that he is one
of the greatest of Stanford's competi
tive athletes, and he should come
through with exhibition in the pole
vault. Lee Barnes of U.S.C. is con
ceded the first place, but Ross is
capable of being right among the fin
est in any meet.

1 Harlow and Shipkey are regarded
as the greatest javelin throwers in the
country. Both are able to toss the
spear over 190 feet, which is plenty
good enough to beat the other javelin
throwers in the meet. Harlow sailed
the spear 201 feet in the P.C.C. meet
last Saturday.
Stanford's hopes for victory in
the 1.C.-4A suffered a severe set
back this morning with the an
nouncement that Bill Storie, quar
ter-miler, will not make the trip,
because of the serious illness of
his wife. Storie was doped to take
two or three points, and his ab
sence may enable U.S.C. to beat
out the Cards by a slim margin.
This is the third successive year
that he has been prevented at the
last moment from accompanying
the track team on an Eastern trip.
His own illness forced him to with
draw in 1924 and 1925.

Twelve redshirt runners embark
for Cambridge tomorrow on the 9
o'clock train to represent Stanford in
the annual 1.C.-4A track and field
championships to be held in the Har
