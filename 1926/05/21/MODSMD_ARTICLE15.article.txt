Stanford's hopes for victory in
the 1.C.-4A suffered a severe set
back this morning with the an
nouncement that Bill Storie, quar
ter-miler, will not make the trip,

his wife. Storie was doped to take
two or three points, and his ab

ably represent the West in the titular
meet. Coach Dink Templeton's strong
Cardinal varsity is the favorite to cop
the intercollegiate title, and the U.S.C.
Trojans are expected to finish close
behind Stanford in the battle for top
honors. California is not rated as high
ly as the other two Western teams, but
Coach Christie's team should give the
Easterners a great fight for third place.
Will Train Enroute
The Cardinal athletes will take a
light workout at Stagg Field in Chi
cago enroute to Cambridge. Prelimi
naries in every event will be held in
the Harvard stadium on Friday, and
the finals are scheduled for Saturday.

Captain Bill Richardson is the Stan
ford entrant in the half-mile, and the
Cardinal leader is recognized as the
greatest two-lap runner in the United
States, and is the reigning favorite to
cop the intercollegiate title in the
