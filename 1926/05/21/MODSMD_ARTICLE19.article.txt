# The
						Awards Plan
## 
### 
Last Spring an attempt was made to incorporate a workable awards
system into the constitution of the A.S.S.U. A committee was delegated,
and it spent much time in preparing a proposition which was put on the
ballot at the Quad election, and which was overwhelmingly voted down.
The opinion at the time was that a new system was needed; but the one
which was suggested was far from popular.
At the beginning of the present school year a new plan was drafted.
With the past failure to guide them, the composers were able to suggest a
scheme which was passed by the Executive Committee as a by-law.
The plan made no changes in the status of the various sports; but
specifically provided what will be required of a man who receives an
award, and changed the nature of the second class minor sport letter.
From time to time sections of it have been altered until now it is workable.
But the awards system is of little value when it exists as a by-law for it
may be changed at the discretion of any future Executive Committee. If
it is possible for each Committee to adapt the plan to suit particular cases,
there is little justification for maintaining any awards requirements at all.
In order to make it an integral part of the constitution, so that it will not
be subject to the revision of governing boards, the by-law is being pre
sented to the student body as an amendment at the Quad election Tuesday.
If the plan receives a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, and we
see no reason why it should not, the granting of awards in the future will
be standardized.
