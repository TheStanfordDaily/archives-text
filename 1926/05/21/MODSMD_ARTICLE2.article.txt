# UTAH DEBATERS BEATEN BY CARD FORENSIC TEAM
## 
### 
Philip Cavalero and Darrell R. Par
ker, Stanford debaters, defeated Stan
ley Christiansen and Cecil B. Kenner,
of the Utah Agricultural College, last
night by a 73 to 12 audience vote, de
bating on the present prohibition law.
By winning the decision, the Cardinals
now have won two contests to Utah's
one during the past two years.
In opening the debate, Cavalero de
clared that the present policy of pro
hibition is fundamentally sound and
any compromise of a minority is not
only unjustified but totally unneces
sary. "The United States has taken
the lead in the greatest social experi
ment of the age and no alteration of
the prohibition law is possible.
"We cannot tolerate any compromise
of the present law. It would be a disas
trous step backward, and a prosper
ous and thriving America cannot take
such a step," said the first Stanford
speaker. "We cannot compromise with
alcohol."
Basing his argument on the belief
that public sentiment, as expressed in
newspaper polls and state elections, is
against the law, B. Kenner advocated
a modification of the Volstead Act to
allow the manufacture and sale of
light wines and beer. "Unless the pres
ent prohibition law is changed, repeal
of the act is certain. America will sup
port a law, but It will not enforce an

act which makes the drinking of non
intoxicating beverages of 2.75 per cent
alcoholic content a crime," he said.

In attacking the modification propo
sal presented by the Utah debater,
Parker, second Stanford speaker,
pointed out that prohibition has justi
fied itself, can be enforced, and any
amendment will cause the ultimate de
feat of the prohibition cause.

"Prohibition was off to a bad start
and it may take from fifty to seventy
five years to make it a success in the
United States. With enforcement of
ficers who are not appointed under a
political spoils system, the success of
the Eighteenth amendment is assured.
Public sentiment is back of the Vol
stead Act."

Christianson, the second Aggie rep
resentative, denied that the majority
of American citizens were in favor of
the prohibition law and that further;
enforcement is impossible. Conditions
of law and order are becoming worse i
and we are raising a younger genera- •
tion who have a deadened conscience j
toward all law, in the opinion of Chris
tianson.
The Utah representatives declared
that they believed in prohibition, but
in order to keep the Eighteenth amend-1
ment, a modification was necessary.
Professor Harold Shepherd, of the
Stanford Law School, was chairman!
of the debate. i

that public sentiment, as expressed in
newspaper polls and state elections, is
against the law, B. Kenner advocated
a modification of the Volstead Act to
allow the manufacture and sale of
light wines and beer. "Unless the pres
ent prohibition law is changed, repeal
of the act is certain. America will sup
port a law, but It will not enforce an

act which makes the drinking of non
intoxicating beverages of 2.75 per cent
alcoholic content a crime," he said.

In attacking the modification propo
sal presented by the Utah debater,
Parker, second Stanford speaker,
pointed out that prohibition has justi
fied itself, can be enforced, and any
amendment will cause the ultimate de
feat of the prohibition cause.

"Prohibition was off to a bad start
and it may take from fifty to seventy
five years to make it a success in the
United States. With enforcement of
ficers who are not appointed under a
political spoils system, the success of
the Eighteenth amendment is assured.
Public sentiment is back of the Vol
stead Act."

Christianson, the second Aggie rep
resentative, denied that the majority
of American citizens were in favor of
the prohibition law and that further;
enforcement is impossible. Conditions
of law and order are becoming worse i
and we are raising a younger genera- •
tion who have a deadened conscience j
toward all law, in the opinion of Chris
tianson.
The Utah representatives declared
that they believed in prohibition, but
in order to keep the Eighteenth amend-1
ment, a modification was necessary.
Professor Harold Shepherd, of the
Stanford Law School, was chairman!
of the debate. i
Philip Cavalero and Darrell R. Par
ker, Stanford debaters, defeated Stan
ley Christiansen and Cecil B. Kenner,
of the Utah Agricultural College, last
night by a 73 to 12 audience vote, de
bating on the present prohibition law.
By winning the decision, the Cardinals
now have won two contests to Utah's
one during the past two years.
In opening the debate, Cavalero de
clared that the present policy of pro
hibition is fundamentally sound and
any compromise of a minority is not
only unjustified but totally unneces
sary. "The United States has taken
the lead in the greatest social experi
ment of the age and no alteration of
the prohibition law is possible.
"We cannot tolerate any compromise
of the present law. It would be a disas
trous step backward, and a prosper
ous and thriving America cannot take
such a step," said the first Stanford
speaker. "We cannot compromise with
alcohol."
Basing his argument on the belief
that public sentiment, as expressed in
newspaper polls and state elections, is
against the law, B. Kenner advocated
a modification of the Volstead Act to
allow the manufacture and sale of
light wines and beer. "Unless the pres
ent prohibition law is changed, repeal
of the act is certain. America will sup
port a law, but It will not enforce an

act which makes the drinking of non
intoxicating beverages of 2.75 per cent
