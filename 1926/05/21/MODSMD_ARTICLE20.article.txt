# CLAY DEPOSITS ARE TESTED FOR CERAMIC WORKING PROPERTIES
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Tests of all the known clay deposits j
in California are being carried on for |
the State Mining Bureau by Professor j
W. F. Dietrich, associate professor of
mining at Stanford. Professor Dietrich
made a trip last summer during which j
time he visited practically all the clay
pits and a great number of ceramic
products factories in the state. This
summer he will make another trip to j
complete his collections.
For four months, he visited the clay '
pits, and took samples from each for
his experiments. Over 100 ceramic]
plants were visited at the same time, j
including those manufacturing archi-j
tectural terra cotta, bathroom tile, j
bath tubs, sinks, kitchen crockery, and !
many other products of a widely di- i
versified nature.
The experiments are being con
ducted under a co-operative venture j
between the University and the State!
Mining Bureau. Professor Dietrich is
giving his time to the work with a
view to further work along these lines
in the future. The particular experi
ments are to determine the character
istics that effect the working proper
ties of the clays. All the expenses of
the work are paid for by the State !
Bureau.
Over 212 speciments have been col
lected. and all the data on half of them
and part of the data on the rest of
them have been determined. The total
time necessary to test completely each
clay sample is about five hours, in
cluding mixing, drying, burning, and
running heat tests of various sorts.
After the clay is dried and powdered, ;
it is mixed to a plastic consistency.
The test pieces are made in a brass
mould which is oiled to prevent the!
i
clay from sticking. The resulting bars,
seven in number, are divided as fol
lows: three are cut up in four pieces
each, and the remainder are left as
made. In addition, several cones are
formed of the same material. These
materials are weighed wet, and then
allowed to dry in the air.
The drying is carried on for a few 1
hours at about 7f» degrees centigrade,
and then dried at 110 degrees. After
this the bars are placed in a dessicator,,

which extracts all the moisture from
them. Calcium chloride extracts the
moisture up to 8 per cent atmospheric
content, and phosphorous pentoxide is
used to complete the extraction. After
this, the volume and weight of each
specimen is determined.

From this, the smaller test baps are j
fired. They are placed in oil-fired assay
muffles, in specified numbers, and
heated to a certain degree. Samples
of the same clay are heated to twelve J
different temperatures, and each one j
tested. They are allowed to cool in j
the muffles, and then are removed j
and boiled in distilled water for two
hours, after which they are again
tested and weighed.
The fusing point of the clays is
determined by placing the prepared
cones with standard cones which melt
down at given temperatures. The two |
types of cones are placed in an oxy- j
aceteline furnape, and heated until the !
test clays melt down. By comparing j
this with the standard clays, the fus- j
ing point is determined. The softening
point of the cones is indicated by the (
tip bending over and touching the j
base placque in which the cones are !
imbedded.
One of the final tests is for trans
verse strength. The long bar, approxi
mately seven inches in length, is !
marked off in a five-inch space and is :
placed over a gap to be broken. From
the center of the bar is suspended a
receptacle in which is poured shot, j
The bar is finally broken by the weight j
of this shot. The weight necessary to ;
break the bar is measured, and the j
two remaining pieces are again broken
over a three-inch gap. All forces lie-1
cessary to break the bars are recorded, i
The connection with this, a total i
of more than 2000 ounces, is often i
needed to break a bar with a cross-j
section of approximately one square j
inch. The drier the bars, the stronger ;
they become.
Clavs in this preparation show differ- j
ent shades of colors with varying!
heats. The usual thing for ordinary
brick clays is that the higher the ,
temperature applied, the darker be-'
• •onies the brick, until after a certain i
point when the color approaches dark
brown indicating the place of over-1
firing. In the whiter bricks and tile
clays, the first heats are pinkish, while
the Inter heats become more and more
white. There are no pure white cera
mic clays in the pits of California.
