FROM WILLIE TO PAPA: BREAKING IT GENTLY
Dear Pop:
Well, it's some time since I last wrote you, but I've been awful busy
studying hard every night for finals which come off three (3) weeks from
now. I've been staying up so late nights, that I can't get up in time for my
8 o'clocks so don't be surprised if I tlunk my 8 o'clock this quarter —like last
quarter.
Well, things ain't going so well in my 9 o'clock either. You see when
I stayed up so late studying and missed my 8, by the time I dress and
everything its 5 of 9 —and that means either going to my 9 or not eating
breakfast. So 1 might not do so well Jhere either —a man must eat.
Well, everything was going along swell in my ten o'clock when the prof
the other d%y happened to overhear me make some complimentary remarks
about him —at least I thought they were complimentary remarks —all 1 said
was that I wished there was more pipes in this Kollege like the ones he gave.
And do you know he gave me a dirty look and walked away without even
saying goodbye or anything. Some of these profs can't take a joke. So I
guess maybe I won't do so well as I thought in that course either.
•' Well, I was just congratulating myself on hitting my 11 o'clock for a loop
when a serious catastrophe occurred. You see, we boys was going down to
the show the other night, and I guess 1 was going a little faster than usual
because Jerry the speed cop was chasing me. Anyway, just as I came to the
highway I crashed uito Prof Snoozem's brand new sedan and knocked him into
a palm tree. And the cop was coming so fast he couldn't, top and skidded
on his posterior end clear to the railway station. So I guess maybe 1 won't
do so well in my 11 either though through no fault of mine.
Well, there is nothing else of great importance to mention except that
you better send me some bail money on acc. of that fool cop putting me in
the cooler on sor 6 counts. He says he's gonna put me up for doing 60 in a
20 mile zone, driving without a license, resisting an officer (I did not. I let
him slide as far as he wanted to!), having a bad breath, reckless driving, and
I forget the rest.
Well, I'll have a good place to study anyway—nice and quiet. Oh yes,
Prof Snoozem just called. He wants a settlement of $30,000 for the loss
of his car and the loss of his dignity. Please remit by wire (the money, f
mean). Can I have my job back next year?
Your darling boy, Willie.
