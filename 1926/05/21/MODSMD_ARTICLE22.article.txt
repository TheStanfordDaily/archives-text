The Editor, Sir:
Since I am one of the group whose
principles are tainted with puny poli
tics and who have never been on an |
athletic team in active competition as ]
outlined by Mr. Johnson in the Daily !
! Palo Alto, I feel called upon not to
throw mud, but to support this "inane,
selfish, and assinine reform," although
realizing perfectly my weaknesses.
1. Is there any reason why a leader 1
! cannot assert himself as such a leader j
i without the title of captain?
2. Is it possible that a coach of such |
teams is not qualified to pick such a
i man to carry out the minor instruc
! tions in football?
3. Is it true that the men elected to
j captaincy in the last few years at Stan- i
' ford have generally been the ones con-j
I ceded by the student body and the i
j team itself as being the logical man?
4. Is it true that there are no poli
! tics connected with such selections
and that no bad feelings result?
5. Is it true that coaches are never i
I handicapped by such selections?
6. Is it true generally that there is i
j one man who deserves such single j
! honor above all the rest?
7. Is it true that captains are neces-i
sary?
8. Is it true that the group who op-'
poses this plan most vigorously has'[
no future ambitions and are interested
strictly in the good of the University?
| 9. Is it true that all traditions are i
i
perfect and all who oppose them are j
of questionable character, feeble in- j
tellect, suffering with that malady j
; commonly known as "sour grapes"?
