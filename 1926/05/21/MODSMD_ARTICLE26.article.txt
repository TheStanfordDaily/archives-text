# DR. CARL L. ALSBERG WRITES ARTICLE ON STUDIES OF STARCH
## Presents Opposing Views of Search Gelatinization As Now Believed 
### 
"Studies Upon Starch," written by
Dr. Carl L. AJsberg, director of the
Food Research Institute, has been re
printed from the February number of
"Industrial and Engineering" by the
Stanford University Food Research
Institute.

"As one reals the literature," says
Dr. Alsberg in his article, "one finds
that two views are current concerning
the gelatinization of starch granules.
One is that as these are heated in
water, they swell and thereupon disin
tegrate to yield a colloidal solution.
The other is that the granules swell
but do not, ordinarily, disintegrate.

"The first view is to be found in
most of the books-on the biochemistry
of plants and on the chemistry of the
carbohydrates. Pringsheim's statement
puts this view clearly thus: 'In cold
water the /natural starch granule is
insoluble; when heated, starch paste
is formed through the swelling, separa
tion of the granule layers, and finally
bursting of the granule.' Since this
â– view is found in textbooks, it is prob
ably the one most generally held. At
any rate, many studies have been
made upon the colloidal properties of
starch under the assumption that
heated starch-water suspensions are
colloidal solutions.

"The second view, that when starch j
granules are heated in water they;
swell but do not ordinarily disinte
grate, has been stated again and again
by various investigators since 184S, !
yet has not found its way into text
books, except into those on the sixing i
and dyeing of textiles. However, this
second view is the correct one, as any-!
one may convince himself by using
the microscope."
Dr. Alsberg says that possibly the
failure of this theory to gain general
recognition is due to the fact that in
Europe the most common commercial ;
starch is that of the potato, in conse-;
quence of which this starch has been i
studied probably more than all others I
put together. Potato starch presents
rather an exceptional behavior. Al-!
though the majority of starches exam-j

ined at Stanford swell when eliated in
water, but do not burst, even after
continued boiling, the starch of the
potato gradually fragments and disin
tegrates.
