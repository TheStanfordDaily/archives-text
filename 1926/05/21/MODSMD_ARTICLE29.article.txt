# STANFORD DELEGATES LEAVE FOR EASTERN RESEARCH CONCLAVE
## 
### 
At the Joint Conference of the Deans
of Men and Delegates of the Personnel i
Research Federation which was held
at the University of Minnesota in Min i
neapolis, Stanford was represented by j
Dean George B. Culver and Karl M. j
Cowdery, director of Personnel Re
search.
The conference dealt principally;
with the progress in the study and in-;
vestigation of the use of various meas-!
ures for estimating student success.

Dean Culver presided over several j
ol' the sessions. Cowdery presented the
Stanford program of selection and ad
mission of students, which proved to
be one of the most interesting fea- j
tures of the convention. All of the |

delegates showed exceptional interest
in the Stanford program, and it is evi-1
dent that Stanford has advanced its
system of admission far beyond that
of any of the other colleges repre
sented at the national convention, ac
cording to Cowdery.

Dean Culver has prolonged his trip
so that he may attend other Eastern
colleges and university conventions
before returning to Stanford.
