scoring honors.
Monday has been selected as the first j
day of competition, and the 100-yard;
dash and the running broad jump are
the two events listed on the intramural
schedule for the day. Marshal Hale, j
former track captain, set the intramural |
record for the century several yearsj
ago while competing for the Sigma Nuj
team. Hale negotiated the distance in |
10 seconds flat.
Miles Crookshank, Delta Upsilon. j
established the broad jump record at j
22 feet 7 inches. This mark lias stood j
for two years, and is very liable to still j
be on the books after next week's meet. I
The 120-yard low hurdles and the j
shot-put are the events on Tuesday's]
program. Orlo Hays, Phi Delta Theta, j
holds the present record of 13 3-5 sec

ord in the shot-put with a heave of 42

biggest ever staged in intramural track j
history.

close of the regular track and field!
events. The half-mile run and the dis-j
cus throw are listed for this day. Dick 1
