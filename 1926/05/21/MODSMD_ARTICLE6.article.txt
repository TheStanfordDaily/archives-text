# General Walkout In England Dead Avers Dr. Jordan
## 
### 
"The general strike is killed," said
Dr. Jordan la√üt night in hia Thursday
evening lecture. "The workers realize
that they cut into themselves and
leave themselves worse off than be
fore."
His talk was concerned with strikes,
their whys and wherefores, and espe
cially with the British strike. He dis
cussed the different phases and causes
of the strike, and explained what made
the miners strike.
"My sympathies were with the
miners," he continued, "but the whole
situation is a circle. If the government
pays the strikers, the money comes
from the people, and if the government
does not pay, the mines close down
and another million unemployed is
turned loose on England. It is a diffi
cult situation, but striking only makes
it worse, and the British people must
realize that by now.
Should Look Ahead
"It is the nature of the British peo
ple to 'muddle through' a situation, and
that has saved them on most occa
sions. But it is really a duty of the
government to look ahead and meet
crises before they reach their height.

That has been the trouble with the
English during this strike. They failed
to make the proper preparations for
it."

"The British system of aristocracy is
largely to be blamed for the situation.
Owners are unable to make money
from their holdings and the working
men are beginning to object to carry
ing the whole burden. Lack of ability
on the part of the aristocratic oper
ators has a great deal to do with the
way that the situation has developed,"
he said.
Dole System Poor
"The dole system now in use in
England to provide for men out of
work tends to make them want to
stay out of work. This makes it a poor
measure. A strike is a war in a small
way," went on Dr. Jordan. "The pres
ent strike has cost the British people
almost as much as they owe the
United States. All strikes are exceed
ingly costly, draining the resources of
a country and stopping production.
"When people begin to destroy prop
erty, shoot and kill, they are wrong,
no matter what their cause for resent
ment. But there are two sides to every
question and both may have some jus
tification."
There may be continued striking for
specific results, predicted Dr. Jordan,
but England will not likely be faced
with another crisis similar to the gen
eral strike. "The people have found
this method too costly, and they have
also found that they suffer worse than
the employers."
