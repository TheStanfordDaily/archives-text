# PAUL JAY BRAMKAMP GETS ECKART AWARD FOR RESEARCH ESSAY
## 
### 
Paul Jay Bramkamp has been award
! Ed the annual William Roberts Eckart
I Research prize for mechanical engineering
j for his essay on "Gas Engine Carbure
tion." The Eckart fund was estab
i lishcd in 1923 by Professor W. R. Eck
(art, of the department of mechanical
I engineering, together with his mother,
j two brothers, and sisters, as a memorial
Ito his father, W. R. Eckart. The aim
j of the fund is to foster and to cncour
! age experimental research in mechan
! ical engineering and to interest, assist,
I and inspire young men who have shown
ability to conduct such work.
William R. Eckart was a pioneer en
' gineer 011 the Pacific Coast, and did
j pioneer work in the various divisions of
| engineering, including civil, mining,
j hydro-electric, and marine. He was
j consulting engineer for the Comstock
! project, and other big mining projects,
and was associated with the Union Iron
Works in the building of steel ships, as
