## 
### 
A1 Christensen of Stanford, swim
ming unattached, won the 100-yard free
style event for juniors in an aquatic
meet held last night at the Elks Club
in San Francisco. Ted Smith, varsity
backstroker, gave Paul de Silva, the
winner of the 100-yard dorsal style
swim, a hard fight all the way and
finished second less than a yard be
hind de Silva.
The 100-yard free style was the most
spectacular event of the evening. Four
' preliminary heats had been held with
only one man qualifying in each so
that four winners lined up for the
start of the finals. Ogden Driggs, an
Athens Club paddler, jumped into the
lead and maintained it till the start
of the last lap when Christiansen
stepped out. The two made their last
turn together and in the final hundred
feet the Card swimmer sprinted to win
by a foot. The time of 59 seconds was
very good, considering the heats which
had been run off a short time before,
and the fact that the race was a
junior event. Tom Wilkenson of the
Olympic Club placed third.
Christiansen has made the century
in :58, swimming against time, and
should be one of the most valuable
men on the squad next year. He is a
transfer from Utah University where
he was the undisputed aquatic star.
