I
Stanford Engineers, together with j
| majors in Geology and Mining, will I
j meet tomorrow evening at 7:30 o'clock j
| in Room 268, for the purpose of fur-1
j thering plans for the publication of a'
Stanford Engineering Journal.
At the Tuesday meeting, representa- j
i tives from the Civil, Chemical, Elec-1
j trical, and Mining departments, to-j
; gether with students of Geology and j
Mining, and of the School of Engineer-!
• .
mg, were present. Members of campus j
engineering societies, together with
the other students present, were
j strongly in favor of such a journal as
is proposed by Lewis O. Howell, '27,
: who is initiating the movement. Pro
fessors in the engineering departments
j have also favored a Stanford Journal,
and have offered to give credit for
work done.
The magazine as proposed will be
self-supporting from subscriptions and
advertising. Articles will be written
by students, alumni, professors, or
men prominent in engineering work,
| dealing with subjects either of a tech- j
! nical nature or of general interest to
I
| students and others interested in this ,
i line of study.
I The publication of such a journal |
|by the Stanford engineers would,
place Stanford with Cornell, Boston
Tech, Princeton, Wisconsin, and prac- j
tically every prominent engineering
I school in this r^s^ect.
