### 
"Every man knocks his profession |
like mad, and sticks to it like a leech," J
quoted Anna G. Fraser, '00, in an ad
dress made to Pi Lambda Theta last j
Friday afternoon in the Women's
Clubhouse. Miss Fraser, state director,
of the National Education Association, 1
and dean of girls at Oakland High
| School, presented her views on "Why |
i Teachers Remain in the Profession." j
' Because a man is traditionally the
head of a secondary school, there is
i not much opportunity for executive
! work for women in this field, but in
1 the primary schools there is a greater
! chance.
Miss Fraser explained that most .
women fail to continue teaching be
! cause they actively dislike it, though
a few stop because they are ashamed
of being teachers. Many leave for bet- j
ter jobs, only to return to teaching
later
