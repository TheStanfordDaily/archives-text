Polls for the spring election of

tomorrow morning at 8:45 and close
at 2 o'clock. Men will vote on the
outer Quad, near the Law Steps, and
women across from the main entrance
to the Library. Each person is allowed
to vote for officers of his own class
and all A.S.S.U. officers, except that
only upperclass students may vote for
Men's Council candidates.
Besides the officers, there are three
changes in the Constitution to be
voted upon. The first is the change of
the name of The Daily Palo Alto to
The Stanford Daily. Next is the inser
tion of the present award plan into
the Constitution proper, instead of
leaving it in the by-laws.
Election of Captain
These first two changes are to be
changes in the Constitution. The third,
"That no captains be elected for any
athletic teams representing Stanford
University after September 1, 1926,"

thirds majority to carry, while the
third requires only a majority.
