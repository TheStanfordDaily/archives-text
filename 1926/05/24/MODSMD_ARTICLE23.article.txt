# The 						Election
## 
### 
Tomorrow's Quad election promises to be one of the most interesting
that has been held in recent years. With three important measures to be
considered and a large list of candidates for student body and class offices
to be checked the poll should be one of the heaviest ever recorded in the
minutes of the A.S.S.U.
Probably the most contested issue on the ballot will be the ratification
of the by-law which abolishes the election of athletic team captains. Only
a few weeks ago a less radical measure was introduced and was defeated
at a special election; but some of those who were in favor of the scheme
were not satisfied with the results, and have brought to vote a severer rule.
The first by-law provided that an honorary captain be elected at the close
of the season's competition, the second will not recognize captains at all.
Considerable space has been devoted to the idea in the Daily which
from the beginning has been in favor of the proposal. The arguments,
pro and con, have formed no small part of the campus conversation; and
probably everyone has a firm conviction for one side or the other.
1 lowever, less consideration has been given the two amendments which
will appear on the ballot —one providing that the name of the Daily Pai.o
Alto be changed to "The Stanford Daily," and the other which would
make the athletic awards plan, now a by-law, an integral part of the
A.S.S.U. constitution.
The request that the name of the Daily be changed was made by the
staff of the paper which at the same time suggested the new name after
selecting it from a number which were considered. There are two reasons
for the change: the present title does not indicate to an outsider that the
paper is connected with Stanford Universtiy, and there is an appreciable
confusion between the University paper and the Daily Palo Alto Times.
The name Daily Palo Alto has headed the issues for over thirty years
and it is not without regret that we recommend its disuse; but sometimes
sentiment must be waived for the practical.
The athletic awards plan now exists as a by-law in which form it may
be changed at the discretion of any Executive Committee to fit any par
ticular case. But, if it is incorporated into the constitution of the student j
body it can be changed only by the regular process of amendment —a stu-1
dent election. The plan has been given a year's trial, and has been revised !
from time to time until it is now workable. If it receives a two-thirds J
majority of the votes cast tomorrow, there will be definite constitutional j
restrictions on the granting of athletic awards, and the requirements will
be the same from one year to another.
As for the student and class offices, let the best man win; and may the
poll be heavy.

A.S.S.U. constitution.
The request that the name of the Daily be changed was made by the
staff of the paper which at the same time suggested the new name after
selecting it from a number which were considered. There are two reasons
for the change: the present title does not indicate to an outsider that the
paper is connected with Stanford Universtiy, and there is an appreciable
confusion between the University paper and the Daily Palo Alto Times.
The name Daily Palo Alto has headed the issues for over thirty years
and it is not without regret that we recommend its disuse; but sometimes
sentiment must be waived for the practical.
The athletic awards plan now exists as a by-law in which form it may
be changed at the discretion of any Executive Committee to fit any par
ticular case. But, if it is incorporated into the constitution of the student j
body it can be changed only by the regular process of amendment —a stu-1
dent election. The plan has been given a year's trial, and has been revised !
from time to time until it is now workable. If it receives a two-thirds J
majority of the votes cast tomorrow, there will be definite constitutional j
restrictions on the granting of athletic awards, and the requirements will
be the same from one year to another.
As for the student and class offices, let the best man win; and may the
poll be heavy.
Tomorrow's Quad election promises to be one of the most interesting
that has been held in recent years. With three important measures to be
considered and a large list of candidates for student body and class offices
to be checked the poll should be one of the heaviest ever recorded in the
minutes of the A.S.S.U.
Probably the most contested issue on the ballot will be the ratification
of the by-law which abolishes the election of athletic team captains. Only
a few weeks ago a less radical measure was introduced and was defeated
at a special election; but some of those who were in favor of the scheme
were not satisfied with the results, and have brought to vote a severer rule.
The first by-law provided that an honorary captain be elected at the close
of the season's competition, the second will not recognize captains at all.
Considerable space has been devoted to the idea in the Daily which
from the beginning has been in favor of the proposal. The arguments,
pro and con, have formed no small part of the campus conversation; and
probably everyone has a firm conviction for one side or the other.
1 lowever, less consideration has been given the two amendments which
will appear on the ballot —one providing that the name of the Daily Pai.o
Alto be changed to "The Stanford Daily," and the other which would
make the athletic awards plan, now a by-law, an integral part of the
A.S.S.U. constitution.
