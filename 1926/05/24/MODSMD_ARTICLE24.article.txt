# The 						Collegiate Utopia?
## 
### 
Amid the wrangling of educational authorities —self-styled and psfeudo
—about the commercialization of football, the detracting effects of extra
curricular activities, and the absence of an intellectual curiosity in present
clay collegians, attention is drawn to Berea college, at Berea, Ky., which is
seventy-five years old and has a capacity of three thousand students. Here
there is no intercollegiate football, because of its expense; there is no use
of automobiles and no wearing of silk articles of clothing, because tliese
two commitments provoke social competitions; there is no smoking, be
cause it is wasteful of money. In fact, they make it possible for a student
to attend school for $150 a year.
The question arises as to how to consider this school. Is it a forerun
ner of the Utopian college, or is it merely a sectional freak, existing as it
does because of its peculiar situation? The latter proposition is the more
probable of the two. Berea college draws its students from the moun
tains, from the so-called one remaining "undiluted reserve" of true Amer
ican blood, and its graduates shun the world. The majority of them go, as
the president of the college asserts, back again to teach in the rural districts.
They have no need to practice social competition, for they will never meet
it. So their problem is sectional, and the means by which they attack it
should have no significance in considering the problem of colleges in
general.— Michigan Daily.

The editorial stafT of the Daily Palo Alto will meet in the office at 1
o'clock tomorrow. All staff members must be present.
