HOW TO PHILOSOPHIZE BEFORE GETTING A BLIND DATE
Now who hasn't had a blind date sometime or other during his life?
When your main grab and clutch turns you down two days before the dance —'
ya just halfta scamper for a blind date.
Some guys like to gamble on blind dates—and 9 out of 10 they are a
gamble. Altho it is said that a bozo named Rameses 11, fondly labeled Half-
Pint by his admiring friends, had a blind date with a certain party way back;
in .000035 a.d. or thereabouts (what's a thousand yrs. among friends). This
is a matter of grave historic import.
Anyway, this nut-brown oleomargarine really turned out to be a 1011, and
Half-Pint had a good racket that night at the Sphinx Hole in One Country Club.
But this was long ago and doesnt concern us now.
As we was sayin', brethren, did ya ever stop to think, and this aint no i
sermon, that mayap they is two sides to this here blind date idea?
An' what about this other side, the weaker side? A blind date, ya know,'
works two ways—forwards and backwards.
Most of uh males around these parts aint noted for our manly beauty—;
we're not so hot. We're not evep luke warm. We're just a bunch of coconut
heavers—minus tails.
Takes two to make a party. And chances are 50-50 that WE might be
the lemon. 'S'fact.
So next time ya drag a B.D. before ya go, gaze on your ossified counte
nance in a lookin' glass until you start to blush—then go get your blind date.

We were NOT astonished the other day to hear two barbers arguing as
to whether or not the North Pole was the sign of a union shop.

Since hair cuts have gone up to 65c on the campus, most students are
showing a marked leaning toward art. Perhaps the boyish bob will soon
become a reality.

The other morning our janitor came into the room and kindly offered to j
make our bed for us if we would arise.
However, not wishing to trouble him we replied that it was of little use 1
because we believed that by sleeping in it we had pressed out most of the j
wrinkles that his efforts of the day before yesterday had produced.
But after all janitors are kind-hearted souls. What habits of sloveliness •
most of us would fall into if we did not have one to tell us how badly our
room needed to be cleaned up.

Cabbages takes this opportunity to compliment the local police authorities !
on their nose for slight infractions of the speed laws and parking rules. We
only wish that they had as sensitive an olphactory organ for tires and other
spare parts that inadvertently change hands during the "wee sma' hours."

SOMEONE COULD START A VERY PROFITABLE BUSINESS ON THE I
CAMPUS BY MANUFACTURING ROLLER-SKATES FOR CANOES SO THAT
DEVOTEES OF THE PADDLE MAY NOT BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR SPORT
WHEN THE LAKE BECOMES COMPLETELY DRY.

What could be more romantique than to glide down the gently sloping
bank of Lagunita in a roller-skating canoe.

At last we have discovered a sport which combines the thrill of tobog
ganing, the romance of canoeing, and the joy of roller-skating.
