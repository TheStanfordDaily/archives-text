## POLITICAL CAREERS DENIED TRAFFIC AND INSPECTION OFFICERS Enforcement Men to Take Absence Leave or Resign To Enter Campaign 
### 
State traffic officers and inspectors
"tickled" with the political bee were
informed recently in a ukase issued by
Will H. Marsh, Chief of the Division
of Motor Vehicles, that they will be
required either to take a leave of
absence from their duties or resign
before making a campaign for public
office.
Officers employed in enforcement
work cannot properly enforce the law
against those through whom they seek
political advancement, the motor chief
held. Marsh's bulletin to the officers
said:
"It has come to my attention that
some employes of the traffic depart
ment of the state are planning to seek
political preferment at the forthcom
ing primaries. This department con
siders it laudable that every employe
have ambitions and has no objection
to those aspiring for advancement.
However, any employe desiring to
enter the political arena will either be
required to take a leave of absence
or resign from his position before en
gaging in these activities.
Gifts totaling $1,575,000 have been
received within the last year by the
University of California.
