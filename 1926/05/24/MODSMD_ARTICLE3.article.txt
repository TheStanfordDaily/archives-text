# AWARDS PLAN MAY GO IN CONSTITUTION BY BALLOT
## 
### 
A change in the present award sys
tem will be one of the issues submit- j
ted to the student body tomorrow at
the A.S.S.U. election. The purpose of
the vote is to change the award sys
tem from a mere by-law to an integral
part of the constitution, with no
change from the plan as it is at pres
ent. A two-thirds majority will be
necessary to incorporate it into the
constitution.
The plan follows:
There shall be five major sports:
Football, Track, Basketball, Baseball,
and Tennis.
There shall be four first-class minor
sports: Swimming, Soccer, Boxing, and
Polo.
There shall be four second-class
minor sports: Fencing, Golf, Gym, and
Wrestling.
! This plan is to go into effect at the
beginning of the 1926 Track season,
and is not retroactive.
