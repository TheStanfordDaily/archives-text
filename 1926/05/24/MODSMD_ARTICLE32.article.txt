Worn cylinder pistons or piston
I rings will not hold the compression.
The result is a vapor coming out of
the oil filler spout. This vapor is heavy
and when the car is traveling at high
speed it comes into the drivers' com
partment causing a headache. This can
be temporarily eliminated until the
engine can be reconditioned by carry- j
ing the fumes to the rear through a
flexible tube.

A simple way of locking the mechan
ism of the car, where no factory lock
is installed in the transmission, is to
drill a hole through the clutch pedal
just as close to the floor-board as pos
sible, and snap a padlock into it.

Do not keep a new tire on the rack j
too long. Use it for a few thousand j
miles, then replace it on the rack. It
will not deteriorate so rapidly and is
not so tempting to the tire thief.

When greasing your car examine the
1 leaves of the springs in the center, as
a break will throw the strain on next
j leaf. Keep the spring clips tonight to
I prevent breaking springs.
* * *
Worn cylinders and piston rings
allow the compression to pass into the
crank case, and cause the engine to
use more oil. The worn rings will not
i wipe off the excess oil.

When changing your tires to an over
-1 size, check your speedometer over a
marked mile. If it is found too fast
or slow you can have the gears
changed to give your speed and mile
age accurately.

Carry an extra fan belt in your car;
They usually break when least ex
pected and the nearest garage may not
have your size or type in stock.
