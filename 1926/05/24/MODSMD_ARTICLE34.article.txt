Mrs. Bertha K. Landis, mayor-elect

Mrs. David Starr Jordan, addressed
the community luncheon of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce last week
upon the different reforms that she j
intends to inaugurate while she is in
office. To get to the luncheon on time,
however, she had an opportunity to be i
impressed with the ease of riding and
the power of the Hupmobile 8.
