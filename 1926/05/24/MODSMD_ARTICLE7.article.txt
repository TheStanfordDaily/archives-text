# PROPOSE TO ENLARGE PALO ALTO HOSPITAL WITH NEW BUILDINGS
## 
### 
!
Plans for a proposed new hospital |
building, to be situated on the south-1
west end of the present site of the
Palo Alto hospital, are being drawn i
under the direction of the city engi-1
neer. This work will probably be sub-.
mitted to the board of works in about
a month.
The capacity of the present hospital j
has already been exhausted and there j
is a possibility that a bill will pass i
the legislature prohibiting the use of j
frame buildings of more than one story i
for hospital purposes, thus making |
the erection of a new building a neces
sity.
The proposed new wing would be
three stories in height with a recess
on the top for an operating room and
dressing quarters. The wing would
contain several private rooms, semi
private quarters, and six wards con
taining eight beds each. In all there
would be eighty to ninety beds, which
would probably take care of the city's
needs for several years.
The plan would also provide for an
other wing, which together with the
first unit, could take care of a popula
tion of about 60,000.
A rough estimate of the cost of the
first wing is approximately $250,000
but no definite way of raising the
funds has yet been considered. An
endowment, it is conceded, would
greatly simplify the problem.
