# GORDON DAVIS RETURNS FROM EASTERN TRIP
## Will Open Tryouts Tonight In Assembly Hall for Senior Farce START WORK AT ONCE Title of 1926 Production Not Yet Announced by Committee 
### 
Since the return of Gordon Davis to
j the campus Saturday, plans have been
I outlined for the Senior Farce. Tonight'
| from 7 to 9 o'clock in the Assembly j
: hall all who wish to try out for the '
! farce may do so.
Davis states that he is very desirous
| of having new people try for the show
I as he wants to discover talent for next
| year. He is going to push the tryouts |
| through in as short a time as possible
! and get to the rehearsals so that he j
! can slacken up during finals week in
! order that the cast will not be im
paired in their studies.
Davis brought with him one of the
! newest and cleverest farces that
j Broadway has had the past season, but
j declines to give out the name as yet.
j He states that it offers many excellent
j characters.
Campus Dramatics Good
Davis remained in New York longer
! than he expected to attend the Drama
i League Convention to represent Stan
; ford. He states that there was a good
i assortment of pictures taken from the
i best shows of the past two years, and
i that the people at the convention were
! quite surprised at the work that has
| been done here on the campus. They
! consider Stanford to have one of the
j most unique and successful organiza
j tions in the country.
Hatcher Hughes, who is head of the |
dramatics work at Columbia, and au
thor of "Hell Bent fer Heaven," pro-1
I duced here last fall, said that Stanford j
i does the finest work in the country in
I college productions.
Few Good Plays
In speaking of the season in New
i York generally, Davis makes the state
ment that it was extremely disappoint
-1 ing. That there are a few fine shows, ;
j he has no doubt, but as is not usually
I the case there are more theatres than
i there are shows, and consequently the >
I managers are throwing in a lot of trash
I that would never get by in a good j
season.
There is, however, a notable phase !
of the season's work in reviving older |
plays such as Oscar Wilde's "Impor-1
tance of Being Earnest," Ibsen's |
"Ghosts," and "Hedda Gabler," sev
eral of the Gilbert and Sullivan light
operas, and a number of Shaw's plays.
I This, Davis feels, is a good thing be
cause it keeps the old favorites in cir- j
culation.
Dramatics Next Year
In view of the fact that good plays j
are so scarce this year, Davis hasj
found it extremely difficult to arrange j
! for plays for the campus next year, j
There is so much trash and so much
sex stuff, though it can be run on,
Broadway would not go over on the
campus, that he finds it harder than i
ever to secure the type of shows he j
wants. There are few very fine plays j
on the sex line, such as "Young Wood-'
ley," being played by Glen Hunter, i
and "The Bride of the Lamb," that 1
would be well received here if they'
could be put on properly by the stu
dents But such shows as "Lulu Bell"
and "The Shanghai Gesture" are pure
ly melodramatic and sensational.
