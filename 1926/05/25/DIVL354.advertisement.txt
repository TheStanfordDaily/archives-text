What Is
A Life
Underwriterl
One who executes and delivers
a life insurance policy. In
other words, a person whose
business it is to offer the
known benefits of life insur
ance to individuals, to corpor
ations, to partnerships, etc.
But further, the life under'
writer is one who must con
vince those clients of the
benefits offered. This tneana
stimulating contact with hu»
man character, and with large
affairs. Some underwriters
prefer the game of character
and deal mainly with indi
viduals. Others prefer affairs;
to them is open the great field
of business insurance.
Furthermore, the business of
life underwriting pays highly
for initiative and ability.
And still more, the life under'
writer offers to his client a
commodity which has no risk
in it, does not deteriorate,and
adds no burden of mental
worry. The life underwriter
sells absolute security, the
foundation of serenity of mind.
It is worth while to think
these things over now and to
remember them when, per
haps, you find yourself wrong- •
ly placed in whatever business
you may have chosen.
