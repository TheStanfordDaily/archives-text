# LAKE LOSING WATER FAST; WILL BE DRY WITHIN TWO WEEKS
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita will be dry in
two weeks, as the water level is
now dropping at the rate of two
and one-half feet every twenty
four hours, according to meas
urements made yesterday and
this morning.
Bathers have taken their last
swim for this year in Lagunita as
the water has now reached such
a level as to render it fit only for
a mud bath, or mosquito plunge.
The water is being used to irri
gate the tomato fields south of
the Convalescent Home.
The lake is drained at this
time every year, in order to pre
vent it from becoming a breeding
ground for mosquitos.
