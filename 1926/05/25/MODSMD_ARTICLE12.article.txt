administrative heads of the colleges
in the country.
The second discussion was 011 stan

differ with types.

meeting was training for leadership.
This meeting was presided over by
Mrs. Herbert Hoover, who has been

ford, Miss Bunting declared, for the
training of women who could instruct
in athletics.
The annual convention of the Amer
ican Physical Education Association,
which met in Newark, New Jersey,
was the last meeting Miss Bunting
attended. Here the main topic was dis
cussion in the fields of commercial and
industrial recreation, the coming field
for athletic development. The modern
idea of having the recreation for every
one instead of in specialized form for
a few of the employes, met with great
approval as being the proper method
in this field.
