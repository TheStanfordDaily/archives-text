The plan of the federal government to enlist California state ami mu
nicipal officers into its prohibition corps as $1 a year men has been blocked,
temporarily at least, in the Central and Northern sections of California.
In fact in San Francisco the presidential order was not only defied, but
the Board of Supervisors has ordered a vote on the question of prohibi
tion at the election in November in order to determine the sentiment of its
constituents. The ballot will be similar to those used in straw votes
throughout the Nation, and will give the citizens three alternativesâ€”en
forcement, modification, or annullment.
This morning's press reports do not indicate that the Washington ad
ministration will be quick in withdrawing its latest enforcement measure,
although a slight hint of something or other is contained in the statement
that President Coolidge signed the bill hastily along with a number of
other routine orders which he received from the Treasury department.
There is also the veiled denial that the plan is intended to force states
which have refused or have reluctantly passed enforcement regulations
into adhering more closely to the Volstead Act.
State and municipal executives are fighting the proposition on the
grounds that it is a violation of state rights and that their officers have
more work than they can handle without saddling duties which should be
per formed by the Federal government.
It is easy to understand the position of the United States government
in creating the $1 a year men when we observe some facts which were
disclosed by Colonel Ned Green, federal prohibition director for Northern
California and Nevada, in a talk before a group of Palo Alto citizens yes
terday. He stated that at the outset 948 men were selected as the pioneer
federal enforcement staff and the number has not been increased appre
ciably since then. At the present time only 500 men are available for
actual field police duty. The point of speech was that the states and fed
eral government are jointly obligated in enforcing prohibition, and that
this was understood at the time the amendment was passed.
fust what the outcome will be is hard to determine; but anyway the oc
currence is politically significant, and is more proof that at the next na
tional election prohibition will be, if not the most important, one of the
leading issues. The Pennsylvania Republicans have voiced their opinion;
Illinois and New York elections in November will include a ballot on the
three phases of the question, and the California incident is not without
some import.
There is indeed a political awakening all over the country, and in view
of the fact that the American people have for several years been politically
lethargic, action should be welcomed. The Eighteenth Amendment plus
the Volstead Act has taken the form of an alarm clock, awakening citi
zens to an interest in governmental methods.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A NEW HOSPITAL building
is being planned for Palo Alto is a welcome one; and we hope that means
of financing the project will be soon found. As was pointed out in the
news columns yesterday, the capacity of the present hospital is exhausted,
and there is on top of this consideration the possibility that frame hospital
buildings of more than one story will be prohibited by legislative action.
