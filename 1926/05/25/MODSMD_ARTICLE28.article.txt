The Big Men on the Campus grow suddenly affable. The light of brotherly
love and kindness shines from their honest eyes. Hardly can they restrain
themselves from clapping hearty hands to the back of all they pass 011 the
Quadrangle.
The highest speak to the lowly in honeyed phrases. First names, long
forgotten, are once more 011 the tip of every tongue. Whence comes all this
delightful democracy? Is the milennium at hand? Or is Spring getting in
her good work?
Or can it be that nominations are closed, and elections are today?

He clapped the voter on the back.
His face exuded joy.

The voter grinned a sheepish grin.
His bosom puffed with pride.
"You're right it is. It's nine. I'm low,"
' To the great man at his side.
Some weeks have passed. The candidate
Is safe in office now.
He sees the voter on the Quad.
He does not smile nor bow.

L'ENVOI
Oh! Hark to my lay. It is tragic.
List to my tale. It is sad.
The misguided voter may vote either way.
He's a cinch to come out to the bad.
And will this deter him a trifle?
The burlap to hold, as of yore?
It will, in the well-known pig's ankle.
Next Spring he'll be crying for more.

Oh! So you were nominated, were you?
Neither were we!

In the Sign of the Sour Grape,
