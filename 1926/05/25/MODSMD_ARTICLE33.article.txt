# RHODES SCHOLARSHIP CANDIDATES SHOULD APPLY IMMEDIATELY
## 
### 
Students wishing to apply for
Rhodes scholarships to begin in the
fall of 1927 should see Professor Au
gustus Murray, of the Classical Liter
ature department, before the end of
the present quarter. The five Stanford
candidates must be selected by Octo
ber 16, 1926, which is too short a time
from the beginning of the fall quarter
for the local committee to give them
due consideration in the fall.
One scholar will be selected from
the state of California on December
11, 1926, but qualifications of the five
recommended students must be sent
to the state committee by October 23,
1926. The state committee which
chooses the scholar from those recom
mended by the universities in the
state, is made up of old Rhodes schol
ars.
The qualities that the committee
must consider in the final selection
are: (1) Literary ana scholastic ability
and attainments; (2) Qualities of man
hood, character, public spirit, and
leadership; (3) Physical vigor, aft
shown by interest in outdoor sports,
and in other ways.
Ability Essential
If a candidate should not excel in
all three of these requirements, it is
stated that the preference should be
given to the man who shows distinc
tion in either character and person
ality, or intellect, over one who shows
a lower degree of excellence in both.
Exceptional athletic distinction is not
to be treated as of equal importance
with the other requirements.
To be eligible for the scholarship a
man must: (1) Be a male citizen of
the United States, with at least five
years' residence, and unmarried; (2)
By the first of October of the year
for which he is elected he must have
passed his nineteenth and not have
passed his twenty-fifth birthday. For
the current scholarship this means
that to be eligible a man must have
been born after October 1, 1902, and
before October 1, 1908; (3) By the
first of October of the year for which
he is elected he must have completed
at least his sophomore year at some
recognized degree-granting university
or college of the United States of
America.
May Apply from Home
Candidates may apply either from
the state in which their home is, or in
the state in which they have had at
least two years of their college educa
tion before applying.
In making the final selection, the
State Committee interviews the candi
dates so that the most ably fitted will
be selected. This makes the selection
fairer than by mere judging of the
credentials, according to Dr. Murray.
As the scholarship runs for three
years, only during two years of every
three is there a student chosen from
one state. California will send a schol
ar for the terms beginning both in
1927 and 1928.
The scholarship carries with a sti
pend of 400 pounds per year which is
sufficient for necessary expenses
though it is recommended the student
have some funds of his own. The sum
has been recently increased from the
former amount of 350 pounds.
Dr. Murray wishes that all students
interested in applying for the scholar
ship should see him immediately at
that the application can be filed be
fore the end of this quarter. Anyone
considering contesting for the posi
tion is requested to discuss with Dr.
Murray the qualifications and oppor
tunities.
