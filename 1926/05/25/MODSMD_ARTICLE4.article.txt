Although there was a large turnout
for the first tryouts for the Senior

find certain characters that he desires,
and wants to have a large number of
new tryoutees tonight in the Assembly
hall from 7 to 9 o'clock. This will be
the last chance for new people, as
Davis intends to start rehearsals this
week.
