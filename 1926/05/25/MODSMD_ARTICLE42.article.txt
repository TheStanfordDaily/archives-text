# SPORTS OF 1926
## Age Versus Youth 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
This is a study in contrasts. The old stuff of "Age verus Youth" and "East
versus West." Coaching two of the teams entered in the 1.C.4-A games at
Cambridge next Saturday are Jack Moakley of Cornell, the Grand Old Man
of the Hill, and "Dink" Templeton, of Stanford, the most successful youngster
now in the business of tutoring track and field athletes.
"Dink" once competed under Moakley's tutorship. That was back in 1920
at Antwerp. Templeton had tried out for that Olympic team in the high jump,
an event in which he had a record of 6 feet, 4 inches. But the Eastern judges
disqualified him, claiming that his Western jumping form was illegal. "Dink"
was as sore as a wet hen. The air was blue around the jumping pit. He made
a post-entry into the broad-jump and qualified for the trip to Belgium. At
Antwerp, he placed fourth in the event, probably helped to jump farther by
words of advice from Jack Moakley, head coach of the United States Olympic
team.
Now he is doing his best to bring Stanford home a winner over Cornell
and the other thirty-odd universities entered in the events this week-end.
Cornell has won nine 1.C.4-A titles; Stanford, none. But Templeton has a much
better chance to win this year than Moakley has.
Templeton's success as a track coach has been phenomenal. Graduating
from Stanford 1 soon after the war, and leaving behind him a record as the
greatest punter and one of the most versatile athletes ever seen on the Pacific
Coast, he started right in showing others how to be great athletes themselves.
Competition is severe out there, and each year young Templeton had to match,
wits with such veteran mentors as Walter Christie, of the University of
California, and Dean Cromwell, of the University of Southern California. Dean
didn't score a victory over "Dink" until this spring and then only by three
disputed points, and Christie has bowed to this "young upstart" the last three
years in succession.
Whoever wins, both Moakley and Templeton will be good friends â€”and
great coaches.
