Basil L. McGann is editor of the

since its original organization early
this year.
Seven 1926-27 Issues
It was decided that next year seven
editions of the Lit will be published,
the first on November 15 and monthly
till May 15, instead of the former plan
for eight issues, with the last on
June 15.
The number of pages devoted to ad
vertising will be increased from nine
to twelve, rates remaining the same.
The active business manager has been
placed on a salary of $30 per month,

April and May issues this year. Bound
volumes of the magazine will be placed
on file in the Library and in the
A.S.S.U. office. Any students who wish
to have their own personal copies
bound may make arrangements by
getting in touch with Art Duncombe,
Box 2, Campus.
Competition was keen for the posi
tion of business manager which was
won by Gertrude Baker. Miss Baker
will be the first woman manager of
any student publication at Stanford,
as far as can be ascertained by check
ing all available files.
A highly successful first year has
been experienced by the magazine,
both in its business and its editorial
division. A clear profit of 12 per cent
has been made on the gross income
from subscriptions and advertising.
This money will be set aside in a
reserve fund. The circulation was ex
pected to be around 500 copies per
month; but the number has mounted
until now 1000 copies of each issue
are printed and distributed.

been a managing editor of the Lit
since its original organization early
this year.
Seven 1926-27 Issues
It was decided that next year seven
editions of the Lit will be published,
the first on November 15 and monthly
till May 15, instead of the former plan
for eight issues, with the last on
June 15.
The number of pages devoted to ad
vertising will be increased from nine
to twelve, rates remaining the same.
The active business manager has been
placed on a salary of $30 per month,
beginning next November. No salary
was received by the business manage
ment during the past year, while the
magazine was in its early stages.
The Lit will continue in the 48-page
size in which it has appeared in the
April and May issues this year. Bound
volumes of the magazine will be placed
on file in the Library and in the
A.S.S.U. office. Any students who wish
to have their own personal copies
bound may make arrangements by
getting in touch with Art Duncombe,
Box 2, Campus.
Competition was keen for the posi
tion of business manager which was
won by Gertrude Baker. Miss Baker
will be the first woman manager of
any student publication at Stanford,
as far as can be ascertained by check
ing all available files.
A highly successful first year has
been experienced by the magazine,
both in its business and its editorial
division. A clear profit of 12 per cent
has been made on the gross income
from subscriptions and advertising.
This money will be set aside in a
reserve fund. The circulation was ex
pected to be around 500 copies per
month; but the number has mounted
until now 1000 copies of each issue
are printed and distributed.
Basil L. McGann has been elected
by the Lit governing board to succeed
A. Grove Day as editor of the Stan
ford Lit. The Executive Committee
approved the election last night. Gert
rude Baker will be business manager,
succeeding Arthur G. Duncombe.
Harry L. Noland will succeed F. Low
ell Matthay as advisory business man
ager. The new managing editors are
Carl Stroven and Edgar P. Owens,
who replace McGann and Dean Storey.
Associate editors will be Harry M.
Bennett, Herbert Klein, Oliver Wil
lard, Helen Stanford, and Emerson
Spencer. One more associate editor
will be appointed next fall. Executive
Committee members of the Stanford
Literary Board will be appointed later
this quarter or early next autumn.
Basil L. McGann is editor of the
Stanford Quad, Volume 33, and has
