# ALPHA CHI SIGMA TO SHOW "DYNAMITE" FILM
## 
### 
"Dynamiteâ€”A Basic Material of
Modern Civilization," a film, will be
shown tomorrow evening at 7 o'clock
in the Little Theatre by Alpha Chi
Sigma, chemistry fraternity. Dr.
Frankforter of the Chemistry depart
ment will give a short outline of the
history of explosives, in connection
with the film.
The use of dynamite will be traced,
and its effect upon civilization shown
by the production. The great increase
in ore production of late years, coal
production having increased from
33,000,000 tons in 1870 to 650,000,000
tons in 1920, refined copper and iron
ore production having increased in
like proportion, has been made possi
ble by the use of explosives in mining
the ore.
Our highways today are the products
of quarrying by blasting. In recent
years 800 miles of ditches have been
blown with dynamite, and swamps in
fested with mosquitoes have been
drained to the benefit of humanity.
Dynamite now is used in planting
trees and in rejuvenating old orchards.
In addition, the film will show how the
explosive is used to accomplish such
remarkable feats. It will picture the
Itopauno plant of the DuPont Com
pany, the largest dynamite plant in the
world, and will describe the process
by which dynamite is made.
