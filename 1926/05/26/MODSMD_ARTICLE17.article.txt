# STANFORD HAS EDGE ON RIVAL TRACK SQUADS
## Stanford Man at Harvard Concedes Cards Good Chance in I.C.4-A FAVORS WESTERN STARS Crimson Aggregation Called Strongest Team From Atlantic Coast 
### 
"After making a casual 6tudy of the
strength of eastern teams, I would
say that Stanford's chances to win the
Fiftieth Annual 1.C.4-A meet Saturday
will depend upon how many points
U.S.C. makes. The competition will bo
chiefly from the Pacific and not the
Atlantic Coast." This is the opinion of
Daniel D. Gage, '24, a student of the
Graduate School of Business Adminis
tration of Harvard, who has written
a survey of Eastern track received
today by The Daily Palo Alto. Gage is
also treasurer of the Business School
Club at Harvard.
Harvard, says Gage, is conceded the
strongest Eastern team entered in the
intercollegiates. Defeating Princeton
and Dartmouth in dual meets and tak
ing the indoor 1.C.4-A by a substantial
margin, the Crimson track squad is
considered the leading Eastern con
tender for honors.
In the sprints, Harvard has A. H.
Miller, a two-hundred-pound flash who
clips the 100 consistently in 10 flat.
Although the century is Miller's best
race, he is also Harvard's sole con
tender in the 220.
Harvard Strong in 440
Harvard's serious threat to cut into
Stanford points is in the middle dis
tances, where the Crimson is fortu
nate in having two men much better
than the average. Kane, 440' man, is
usually figured to run under 50 sec
onds, and in the dual meet with Dart
mouth two weeks ago, made 49 flat in
fair competition. Soapy Watters is
the second Harvard threat, being capa
ble of 1.54 in the half. He defeated
Bill Richardson in the 1.C.4-A two
years ago. Although Watters is some
times entered in the mile, Gage's
opinion is that it is doubtful if he
could stand the two races under the
stiff competition assured Saturday.
Williard Tibbitts, two-miler, and
Red Haggerty, 1925 winner, are the
Crimson mainstays in the distance
races, while Harvard has not exhibited
any strength which should cause West
era teams any worry in the other \
events. Kane and Ballantyne, hurdlers,
are not up to the par of any of the
Pacific Coast performers, and Gage
concedes West of Stanford to bej
superior to eight of these men. Har- i
vard's weight men are not placed in
the class of Hoffman, Houser, Gerkin, !
the leading Westerners.
Cornell Fairly Strong
"Pennsylvania and Yale," writes j
Gage, "the teams which forced Stan
ford in third place two years ago, will j
enter only mediocre teams. Yale has
only a couple of stars left from her
famous team of 1924, while Pennsyl
vania lost a dual meet to Cornell two
weeks ago, showing up well only in j
the hurdles. I would say that, second
to Harvard, Cornell has perhaps the i
best chance of running up points. Cor-1
noil presents a strong pair of sprinters !
in Captain "Hank" Russell and Good-1
willies. The former equalled the
world's record in the 220 last year, |
and this year has shaded ten seconds j
in the 100.
"There will be about twenty other j
colleges entered, but none of them j
have more than one or two stars. Bos
ton College has Frank Hussy, star
sprinter, Bill McKillop, quarter-miler, |
and a couple of promising hurdlers. !
Holy Cross and Georgetown will enter \
some capable men in the quarter and j
half, and from the smaller colleges j
some dark horses are bound to appear. I
Boston Tech has a new man, George i
Leness, to offer competition in the 1

half, since he has negotiated the dis-1
tance in 1.55. Tech also has a pole- j
vaulter who leads most Easterners at
12 feet 8 inches."
