# A 						Morning Paper
## 
### 
With the close of a successful adventure, the ambitious look ahead to
possible fields for improvement and betterment. But a new undertaking
can never be started until the last idea is running smoothly. At the end of
this quarter the Daily Palo Alto will be ready to open operations as
The Stanford Doily with a staff which during this year has proved capable
of publishing a seven-column daily. It is natural that the incoming board
seeks for new fields of conquest.
Glancing into the future it is not difficult to see that the Stanford cam
pus will not always be content with an afternoon paper. Each day com
plaints are made about the timeliness of the happenings which are related
in the columns. The morning San Francisco papers are able to score a
scoop 011 practically every large news break; and for a very good reason.
Almost every event of importance on this campus, or for that matter
011 any college campus, occurs between noon and midnight. As an after
noon paper, the Daily is required to lock its forms shortly after the noon
hour, or at the hour when the fun is just beginning; and consequently to
morrow evening you will read about the events which are happening at the
present time, and which tomorrow morning will be related in the city
papers. If The Stanford Daily was a morning edition, a student would
arise in the morning, and starting for his coffee and snails would pick up
a paper which contained the latest.
There is the possibility too that an Associated Press franchise could
be secured later; and the sheet would then not only print stories of most
recent events 011 the campus, but would contain the latest in the field of
world news. As a morning paper with full news coverage, the Daily
would be almost sure of a large subscription list in Palo Alto. However,
it has been pointed out that it is best for improvements to be made one at
a time.
To both the editorial and business staffs the change would be a bles
sing. At the present time the news editors and the most industrious re
porters are not only required to stay up late at night, but also must spend
a good part of the morning and afternoon in the office. The editorial work
011 a morning paper would be done during the hours of 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and 12 o'clock at night. There would be fewer "cut" classes
and less time necessitated in the preparation. The business staff would
find it easier to solicit advertising in Palo Alto, for the campus paper
would be the only morning journal in the community.
Plans are now under way to effect the change; and, if they are success
fully worked out, we predict that in the future there will be no complaints
on the service which the Daily renders.
VICTOR GREISSER WAS LAST NIGHT appointed business
manager of The Stanford Daily for the year 1926-27. Greisser has been
on the business board of the Daily since his freshman year, and in addi
tion has held responsible class and managerial positions. With so capable
an executive in charge of the financial end, the paper should continue to
prosper and grow.
YESTERDAY'S HEAVY POLL was indeed gratifying, for besides
assuring the elected candidates that a goodly portion of the student body
was behind them, it registered the true sentiment of the students on the
two amendments and the by-law.

world news. As a morning paper with full news coverage, the Daily
would be almost sure of a large subscription list in Palo Alto. However,
it has been pointed out that it is best for improvements to be made one at
a time.
To both the editorial and business staffs the change would be a bles
sing. At the present time the news editors and the most industrious re
porters are not only required to stay up late at night, but also must spend
a good part of the morning and afternoon in the office. The editorial work
011 a morning paper would be done during the hours of 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and 12 o'clock at night. There would be fewer "cut" classes
and less time necessitated in the preparation. The business staff would
find it easier to solicit advertising in Palo Alto, for the campus paper
would be the only morning journal in the community.
Plans are now under way to effect the change; and, if they are success
fully worked out, we predict that in the future there will be no complaints
on the service which the Daily renders.
VICTOR GREISSER WAS LAST NIGHT appointed business
manager of The Stanford Daily for the year 1926-27. Greisser has been
on the business board of the Daily since his freshman year, and in addi
tion has held responsible class and managerial positions. With so capable
an executive in charge of the financial end, the paper should continue to
prosper and grow.
YESTERDAY'S HEAVY POLL was indeed gratifying, for besides
assuring the elected candidates that a goodly portion of the student body
was behind them, it registered the true sentiment of the students on the
two amendments and the by-law.
With the close of a successful adventure, the ambitious look ahead to
possible fields for improvement and betterment. But a new undertaking
can never be started until the last idea is running smoothly. At the end of
this quarter the Daily Palo Alto will be ready to open operations as
The Stanford Doily with a staff which during this year has proved capable
of publishing a seven-column daily. It is natural that the incoming board
seeks for new fields of conquest.
Glancing into the future it is not difficult to see that the Stanford cam
pus will not always be content with an afternoon paper. Each day com
plaints are made about the timeliness of the happenings which are related
in the columns. The morning San Francisco papers are able to score a
scoop 011 practically every large news break; and for a very good reason.
Almost every event of importance on this campus, or for that matter
011 any college campus, occurs between noon and midnight. As an after
noon paper, the Daily is required to lock its forms shortly after the noon
hour, or at the hour when the fun is just beginning; and consequently to
morrow evening you will read about the events which are happening at the
present time, and which tomorrow morning will be related in the city
papers. If The Stanford Daily was a morning edition, a student would
arise in the morning, and starting for his coffee and snails would pick up
a paper which contained the latest.
There is the possibility too that an Associated Press franchise could
be secured later; and the sheet would then not only print stories of most
recent events 011 the campus, but would contain the latest in the field of
world news. As a morning paper with full news coverage, the Daily
would be almost sure of a large subscription list in Palo Alto. However,
