Sophomore women swamped the sen
iors in the last interclass track compe
tition before Field Day when they won
yesterday by a score of 45-22. Lois
Hopper, senior captain, was high-point
winner with fifteen points, taking first
in the shot put, basketball throw, and
baseball throw. The sophomore scor
ing was led by Fay Hamilton, who
look first in the 75-yard dash and 100-
yard hurdles, making ten points.
The time made by Hamilton in the
75-yard dash was good, but not as fast
as the record-breaking time of Dew
la ney in the junior-freshmen meet last
week. The 50-yard dash time was the
same as last week's, 7 fiat, being slow
er than has been turned in many times
in practice. Lease and Bakewell ran
a dead heat to the tape, but Lease
broke it by a better leap at the finish.

Hamilton took a tenth of a second
' off of the time made last week in the
100-yard hurdles, which is a new event
this year.

feet 7 inches, two feet under the rec
ord made by Lansburgh of the fresh

ability in the shot put and the base
ball and basketball throw. In the latter
event her distance was 79 feet 8 i-icn
es, 21 feet farther than Shoup's win
ning mark last week. In the baseball
I throw, however, she missed the mark
