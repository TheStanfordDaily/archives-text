## IMPRESSIONS OF "STANFORD NIGHT" AT THE MOVIES 
### Monroe Eaton 
By One Who Did Not Attend
The stage contains many people for no reason whatsoever, among them
six politicians who have been found guilty and are now lined up ready to be
shot. .
The director calls for a cast from the audience and gets two —a plaster-of-
Paris cast and an iron cast. Also a nicely-cast tomato. He chooses the iron
cast.
The director shouts "shoot," the audience applauds, but the execution fails
because the lights go oul.
The director calls for another cast of stars. This time he gets a cauliflower,
a cat, and a petrified egg which finds its mark, hence his appeal for stars is
successful.
This time the execution does not fail. Three actors fall dead in their tracks.
The director shouts "cut." Several men produce their pocket-knives, but
before anything can be cut the lights go out again. There is a ripping sound
as if someone were chewing the rag.
When the stage is again illuminated it is found that someone has put a
Kleig light in his pocket.
There follows a riot scene in which the entire student body participates.
2,936 students sign contracts with Mack Sennett, Paramount, Universal,
First National, and others, varying in amounts between $100,000 and $10,000,000
a year.
