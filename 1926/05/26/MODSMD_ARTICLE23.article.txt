# FROM WILLIE TO PAPA: SPRING IS CAME
## 
### 
Dear Papa:
Well, am still studying hard as the deuce. Have only been to 2 shows this
wk. altho being broke I couldnt have gone anyway, but that is besides the
point.
Well, what with Spring, and its flowers and birdies and grass, not to men
tion the croaking of froggies, its pretty hard for a fella to buckle down to
some real work. In fact, I should say its almost impossible considering the
California moskitoes that buzz around and wont let a fella sleep during his
classes, actually forcing him to listen to the droning of the Prof which in
normal times alone is enough to put anyone to sleep. And what is more, the
flies is getting real fresh and dont even wait to be introduced before they
swim in your soup, etc.
Well, the other day, speaking of flies, it occurred to me to do some studying
in the lib (the queening center of the Kollege). So I brought me books and
settled down with a sigh of resignation to study with uncommon assiduou
sity (?). Had no sooner begun when millions of flies, not the same ones as
b e f ore _ o ther ones, started buzzing around me, crawling on my face, down
my neck —and you know how ticklish I am. Of all the V4s
- there wasnt nothing to do but to retaliate in kind, so I gets out my
flyswatter—which everyone carries around here as a weapon of defense —and
went to it with a grand war hoop.
Well, I want to go on record as an advocate of flypaper. Flyswatters is too
dangerous —to the user. In one hour I only snagged three flies. Anyway, I
swings so hard that I dislocated my neck, broke my hand on the desk, and
knocked over a bottle of ink. which ruined my best and only shirt.
Well, in the future, I intends leaving are of fly swatting to them as wants it.
Live and let live is my motto.
Well ,iliev aint no Hies 011 Willie, since I made myself a flypaper shirt.
Adieu, I remains, Your darling boy, Willie.
