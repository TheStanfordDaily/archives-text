# YALE SHOWS POWER AS I.C.4-A TEAM BY BEATING PRINCETON
## 
### 
Records made in the recent Yale-|
Princeton meet indicates Yale will
have a formidable team in the 1.C.4-A
which will be held next Saturday with
a good chance of a victory. Two inter-1
collegiate records were broken and
I one tied in what was said to be the J
fastest dual meet of the year in the I
East. However, only in five events j
' were the marks superior to those made j
in the California-Stanford meet. By an |
odd coincidence, both intercollegiate j
records made were surpassed on the ;
same day in other meets —in fact one j
was broken in two different meets.
Carr of Yale broke the pole-vault
mark with a leap of 13 feet 3 inches,
but on the same afternoon Barnes of
U.S.C. did 13 feet 8 inches. Gibson of j
Princeton broke the other record by j
ten inches when he tossed the javelin j
199 feet 11 inches, but at Stanford 1
Harlow threw the spear 201 feet 2V2
■■ inches, and in the Middlewest Kuck,
of Kansas, hurled the javelin 214 feet.
Davidson of Yale threw the spear 188
feet 10 Clark of Yale tied the
intercollegiate record of 21.2 in the
220, when Norton of Yale, favorite in
the East to win the 220, did not run.
Norton, however, won the 100 in 10 j
seconds.
Fast Time Registered
Fast time was registered in both i
the 440 and the 880 with Paulsen of j
Yale running the quarter in 49.2. In an i
earlier meet he ran 48.9. On the same ;
day in a meet with Dartmouth, Kane !
of Harvard ran 49 flat. Hogan of Yale |
ran the half-mile in the fast time of '
1.54.8. Smith of Yale covered the two- 1
mile in 9:43, while 011 the same day j
Tibbetts of Harvard, last year's cham-1
pion, won in 9:42. Tibbetts is capable i
of 9:27, however. The only other out-;
standing performance in the Yale meet i
came in the low hurdles, when Law-1
rence of Princeton did 24.2.
A decided upset came in the broad
j jump when Norton, last year's 1.C.4-A j
I champion, jumped only 22 feet 4 -inches |
I to take a third; Dikeman of Princeton
| won with a leap of 23 feet one-half 1
! inch.

Records made in the recent Yale-|
Princeton meet indicates Yale will
have a formidable team in the 1.C.4-A
which will be held next Saturday with
a good chance of a victory. Two inter-1
collegiate records were broken and
I one tied in what was said to be the J
fastest dual meet of the year in the I
East. However, only in five events j
' were the marks superior to those made j
in the California-Stanford meet. By an |
odd coincidence, both intercollegiate j
records made were surpassed on the ;
same day in other meets —in fact one j
was broken in two different meets.
Carr of Yale broke the pole-vault
mark with a leap of 13 feet 3 inches,
but on the same afternoon Barnes of
U.S.C. did 13 feet 8 inches. Gibson of j
Princeton broke the other record by j
ten inches when he tossed the javelin j
199 feet 11 inches, but at Stanford 1
Harlow threw the spear 201 feet 2V2
■■ inches, and in the Middlewest Kuck,
of Kansas, hurled the javelin 214 feet.
Davidson of Yale threw the spear 188
feet 10 Clark of Yale tied the
intercollegiate record of 21.2 in the
220, when Norton of Yale, favorite in
the East to win the 220, did not run.
Norton, however, won the 100 in 10 j
seconds.
Fast Time Registered
Fast time was registered in both i
the 440 and the 880 with Paulsen of j
Yale running the quarter in 49.2. In an i
earlier meet he ran 48.9. On the same ;
day in a meet with Dartmouth, Kane !
of Harvard ran 49 flat. Hogan of Yale |
ran the half-mile in the fast time of '
1.54.8. Smith of Yale covered the two- 1
mile in 9:43, while 011 the same day j
Tibbetts of Harvard, last year's cham-1
pion, won in 9:42. Tibbetts is capable i
of 9:27, however. The only other out-;
standing performance in the Yale meet i
came in the low hurdles, when Law-1
rence of Princeton did 24.2.
A decided upset came in the broad
j jump when Norton, last year's 1.C.4-A j
