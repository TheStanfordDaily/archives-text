### 
It took fifty cents to send a letter
from Texas to Ohio in 1840, according
to a mark on the envelope of one of
the two letters recently donated to
the manuscript collection of the Uni
versity of Texas by Mrs. Lillian G.
Harwell of Austin. The letters were
written by a pioneer Texas woman in
the neighborhood of Gonzales to her
mother in Ohio, and are dated Decem
ber 22, 1839, and April 9, 1840.
