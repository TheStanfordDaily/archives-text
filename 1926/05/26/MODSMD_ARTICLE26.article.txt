# STUDY SCHEDULE OF STANFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL IS REVISED
## 
### 
A revision has been made in the
study schedule of the medical students
at Stanford Medical School in San
Francisco, which will put into effect
gradually, beginning next fall. The
purpose of the new system is to mini
mize the didactic, theoretical work and
increase the praltical work. Under the;
new system the seniors will be as-1
signed patients in the out-patient clinic '
and the juniors will do the hospital
work.
This new plan puts the student on '
his own initiative. He is assigned a
case, takes the history of it, makes 1
the physical examination, and diagno
sis treatment, but he does not carry
it out as the interne would do. He j
studies the particular disease thor- 1
ouughly, reading up on it while study-;
ing the case. This enables him to study
and learn through actual practice.
The out-patient clinic gives the pro
spective doctor experience in ambula
tory cases, cases that the doctor has
at his office continually. The interne;
comes in contact with only the cases |
severe enough to be sent to the hos
pital, having little experience with the j
ambulatory type of work. The new i
plan affords this added practice.
