# CROMWELL CERTAIN TROJANS WILL SCORE 25 POINTS IN EAST
## Eleven U.S.C. Athletes Must Get Eight Additional Markers for Title 
### 
LOS ANGELES —Eleven members
of the University of Southern Cali
fornia track and field team must score
a total of at least eight points if the
Trojans hope to retain their National
Collegiate championship honors in the
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet at Boston at Boston
on May 28 and 29. It took just 33 points
for the Cardinal and Gold tracksters
to annex top honors last year at Phila
delphia, and if the same total will win
this time, eleven of the fifteen who will
make the trip East, must score eight
digits.
Dean Cromwell, veteran Trojan
coach, figures he has 25 points pretty
well sewed up in four men. These are
Captain "Bud" Houser, greatest weight
man of modern times, who should
annex first in both shot and discus
without any too great effort. Houser's
world's record of 158 feet 1% inches
in the discus, and his recent toss of 50
feet 7 1-4 inches in the shot, should
be good enough to insure him of first
places. That's ten points.
Then there is Leighton Dye, Nation
al intercollegiate champion in the high
hurdles. Dye has twice negotiated the
high sticks in :14.6 on the Coast this
season, and although he has been
slowed up lately by the long training
season, and extra study for examina
tions, he is expected to be able to be
in the best of form for the meet. That
would be five more points.
Grumbles in Champ
Third is Ken Grumbles, who, like
Dye, is a defending champion, his
forte being the low hurdles. Grumbles
has run the lows in :23.6 this season,
which equals the I.C.A.A.A.A. record,
and is confident he can withstand any
and all challenges for the first position.
The fourth member of the quartet,
Lee Barnes, is a new one to eastern
College competition, but is doubtless
well known to all sport fans. Barnes
is the Olympic pole vault champion,
and recently established an American
record of 13 feet 8 inches in the aerial
event. Barnes made his mark at the
Pacific Coast Conference meet, dis
tancing all opposition by fourteen
inches. He did not miss a single jump
during the day. Barnes should easily
outjump Eastern opposition, as he has
outclassed everything in the West.
That's twenty-five points scored by
four men. Leaving, as mentioned pre
viously, eight points to be accounted
for by eleven others. Alden Ross and
Henry Coggeshall, both of whom have
done six feet three inches this year,
are looked upon as possibilities for
places in the high jump. Andrew "Bill"
Cook, the midget javelin thrower, can
gain a place if he is up to his best
notch. He has thrown the spear close
to 190 feet, placing third to Harlow
and Shipkey of Stanford in the P.C.C.
meet. Both Cardinal men will be at
the intercollegiates.
Percy Niersbach, the varsity half
mil er, will be given a chance in the
quarter. He has turned in some good
times in the once-around event, and is
a strong, sturdy runner, who will not
be bothered by an excessive number
of heats.
Aleski Stands Chance
Joe Aleski will assist Captain Bud
Houser in the weights. Aleski did not
•compete in the P.C.C. meet, but has
displayed form this season, which

j seems good enough to insure him of a
: place against Eastern oppositions,
i which isn't much, at best. He has put
j the shot 4f> feet (> inches and the discus
J139 feet 8 inches this season.
The three Trojan sprinters, Ed
j House, Herschell Smith, and Johnny
| Parsons, are capable of doing things in
j the sprints. The first two named have
I bettered :10 flat in the century, and
| all three have run under even time in
I the furlong, with House doing :21.4
and Parsons third best at :21.G.
I Ronald Stever and Clifton Reynolds,
j hurdlers de luxe, are expected to finish
! close up behind Dye in the high sticks,
|no matter if all the Wolfs in Penn
| State are in the meet. Stever was third
| in the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet last year, and
! Reynolds established a new Pacific
Coast Conference record of :14.8 in a
I heat of the sticks this year, and only
a foot behind Dye in the final, the race
being run in : 14.9. Reynolds is also
a high-class broad-jumper. He made
j three jumps of over 24 feet in the
i Pacific Coast Conference meet, fouling
j each time by a fraction of an inch.
His best official jump was 23 feet 7
! inches, while 23 feet 8 inches took
i fourth place.
