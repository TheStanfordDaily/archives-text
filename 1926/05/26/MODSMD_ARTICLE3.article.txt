# "MEET THE WIFE" CHOSEN FOR SENIOR PRODUCTION
## 
### 
"Meet the Wife," by Lynn Starling,
has been chosen for the Senior Farce,
to be given Wednesday, June IG. It is
a sparkling, witty comedy that more
than fills the needs of the annual
senior show, according to Gordon
Davis, director, who states that it will
be a distinct contrast to the other
plays he has staged this year.
Realizing that the campus desires
something mirth-provoking after the
strain of the last weeks of the quarter,
Davis chose this light, amusing farce.
The play was very much of a suc
cess last season in New York, the
star role being carried by Mary Bo
land, who is now playing "Cradle-
Snatchers." The main part is the part
of a grown-up "Dulcy" about thirty-six
to forty years old. There are, however,
several good parts, even though the
cast is a small one of eight characters.
Davis is attempting to secure, in
his selection of the people to portray
the parts, those with the comedy

I spirit, who will get into the comic
j sway of the show, and carry it with
their personalities.
! The technical staff, under Leslie
i Kiler, will have only one scene to
| construct, and thus will have ample
time to build a bright and stunning
setting that will harmonize with the
Hpirit of the play.
The Senior Farce is becoming more
popular every year. Though people are
reluctant to stay over one more eve
ning just to see the Farce, those who
have done so have been much enter
tained, and have given the shows fa
; vorable criticism. Davis has attempted
to get as good plays as possible, so
the audience would get its money's
worth. He feels he has been extra
ordinarily successful this year, and
believes "Meet the Wife" will be the
funniest show of the season. It is built
for laughs.
The cast of the show has not been
completed, but Davis expects to make
| the final selections tonight.
