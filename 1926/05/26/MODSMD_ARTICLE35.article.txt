# HERBERT DECLARES CO-OPERATION NEED OF ENGLISH MINES
## Deterioration, Heavy Debts, Taxes Problems Which Face Mine Owners 
### 
"Co-operation and efficient engineer
ing in the coal industry are needed in
the industrial reorganization upon
which the future of Great Britain de
pends," said Sydney Herbert, profes
sor of the University of Wales, who
lectured in the Little Theatre last
night.
Great Britain's coal and general in
dustrial situation is changed, and she
is face to face with the fact that the
mines are getting older, that she has
a tremendous debt burden, and that
taxation is greater now than ever be
fore. Everything depends on how these
conditions are met.
If the industry is bankrupt, high i
wages cannot be maintained. On the
other hand, it is not to the national
interest that the many millions em
ployed in the coal industry be forced
to accept an inadequate wage. In order
to reorganize the industry into a pay
ing proposition, it is necessary that
labor and capitalists come to an under
standing and unite for greater effi
ciency in the coal enterprise.
Strikes No Novelty
Large scale conflicts between labor
and capital are not new, and recent
history of the industry is a troubled
one. The average annual number of
strikes during the years 1919 to 1925
has been 181. Trouble broke out early
in 1919 under the coalition govern
ment, and a Royal Commission was ap
pointed to inquire into the condition
of the industry.
Justice Sankey, presiding officer of,
this commission, in his final report :
recommended the principle of state j
ownership of the coal mines and the !
nationalization of royalties. He pointed
out that some of the coal owners are
a real hindrance to the development
of the coal deposits. In many cases!
barriers of coal were left unworked j
between adjoining properties of vari-'
ous owners, resulting in the waste of
millions of tons of coal. Sankey also!
criticized the inefficiency due to lack i
of co operation between operators in!
pumping and draining the mines.
Nationalization Proposed
The labor representatives on the I
commission proposed nationalization
of the coal mines plus control by j
technicians and miners concerned. The ]
employers advocated nationalization of
royalties, amalgamation of colliery in- j
terests by districts, and legal limitation
of profits.
No steps for reorganization were j
taken by the government, however,;
which retained control of the coal in
dustry as taken over during the war !
until 1921 when the government sud- j
denly released control. Although com-!
plete stoppage of the coal industry re
sulted, peace was finally made and the
mining industry continued more or
less smoothly until last summer, when
the battle over wages began. The em
ployers desired to cut wages, and the
miners resisted. A general strike was
imminent when the government, called
in to settle the dispute, granted a sub
sidy and appointed a new royal com
mission.
Miners Not Lazy
Finding the depression serious, with
about 73 per cent of the British coal i
produced at a loss, the commission !
suggested that the mineral industry
should be acquired by the state. That
means in effect, that the royalties;
should be nationalized, that the many j
small units of production be amalga-j
mated, that a national fuel and power l
committee be established to procure ;
better connection of mining with allied
industries with a view to production j
of cheaper power, promotion of re-'
search by the government, and the
formation of a selling association,
especially in the export trade.
Concerning those responsible for
the high cost of coal, the report says,
"There is in many quarters an impres
sion that the British miner could and
should work harder than he does." The ;
report emphasizes that this view found i
no support from any of its expert wit
nesses. The commission rejected the I
charges brought by the miners to the j
effect that the management is responsi- j
ble for the high cost of coal.
A petition signed by more than 300 I
seniors, to be excused from finals, has i
been denied the senior class at North-1
western University.

"Co-operation and efficient engineer
ing in the coal industry are needed in
the industrial reorganization upon
which the future of Great Britain de
pends," said Sydney Herbert, profes
sor of the University of Wales, who
lectured in the Little Theatre last
night.
Great Britain's coal and general in
dustrial situation is changed, and she
is face to face with the fact that the
mines are getting older, that she has
a tremendous debt burden, and that
taxation is greater now than ever be
fore. Everything depends on how these
conditions are met.
If the industry is bankrupt, high i
wages cannot be maintained. On the
other hand, it is not to the national
interest that the many millions em
ployed in the coal industry be forced
to accept an inadequate wage. In order
to reorganize the industry into a pay
ing proposition, it is necessary that
labor and capitalists come to an under
standing and unite for greater effi
ciency in the coal enterprise.
Strikes No Novelty
Large scale conflicts between labor
and capital are not new, and recent
history of the industry is a troubled
one. The average annual number of
strikes during the years 1919 to 1925
has been 181. Trouble broke out early
in 1919 under the coalition govern
ment, and a Royal Commission was ap
pointed to inquire into the condition
of the industry.
Justice Sankey, presiding officer of,
this commission, in his final report :
recommended the principle of state j
ownership of the coal mines and the !
nationalization of royalties. He pointed
out that some of the coal owners are
a real hindrance to the development
of the coal deposits. In many cases!
barriers of coal were left unworked j
between adjoining properties of vari-'
ous owners, resulting in the waste of
millions of tons of coal. Sankey also!
criticized the inefficiency due to lack i
of co operation between operators in!
pumping and draining the mines.
Nationalization Proposed
The labor representatives on the I
commission proposed nationalization
of the coal mines plus control by j
technicians and miners concerned. The ]
employers advocated nationalization of
royalties, amalgamation of colliery in- j
terests by districts, and legal limitation
of profits.
No steps for reorganization were j
taken by the government, however,;
which retained control of the coal in
dustry as taken over during the war !
until 1921 when the government sud- j
denly released control. Although com-!
plete stoppage of the coal industry re
sulted, peace was finally made and the
mining industry continued more or
less smoothly until last summer, when
the battle over wages began. The em
ployers desired to cut wages, and the
miners resisted. A general strike was
imminent when the government, called
in to settle the dispute, granted a sub
sidy and appointed a new royal com
mission.
Miners Not Lazy
Finding the depression serious, with
about 73 per cent of the British coal i
produced at a loss, the commission !
suggested that the mineral industry
should be acquired by the state. That
means in effect, that the royalties;
should be nationalized, that the many j
small units of production be amalga-j
mated, that a national fuel and power l
committee be established to procure ;
better connection of mining with allied
industries with a view to production j
of cheaper power, promotion of re-'
search by the government, and the
formation of a selling association,
especially in the export trade.
Concerning those responsible for
the high cost of coal, the report says,
"There is in many quarters an impres
sion that the British miner could and
should work harder than he does." The ;
report emphasizes that this view found i
no support from any of its expert wit
nesses. The commission rejected the I
charges brought by the miners to the j
