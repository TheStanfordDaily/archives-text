# SPORTS OF 1926
## Big and Fast 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Every sport now and then produces an athlete who tips the scales at 200
pounds or more, yet who is as fast as lightning in all his movements. Boxing
gave us Jim Jeffries; football, "Germany" Schulz; wrestling, Frank Gotch;
baseball, Babe Ruth; and so on down the list. This article deals with a few
of the track and field stars of recent years who have combined both size and
speed to an unusual degree.
He who is big and fast is lucky; and blessed is the track coach who can
make use of an athlete in both the sprints and weight events. Of such a
type is Caleb Gates of Princeton, a weight-thrower who possesses unusual
sprinting ability. Yale and Harvard tackles will tell you that Caleb Gates is
one he-man of a football player too, but that's another story. Suffice it to say
that he is indoor intercollegiate champion in the 35-pound weight throw, and
a member of the quarter-mile relay team which equaled the record of the
Penn relays in 1925.
"Truck" Miller, the husky halfback of the Harvard football team, looks
like a shot-putter, but is a sprinter with a 9 4-5 record in the hundred. "Truck"
is a far better runner than he is a ball-carrier. Many track fans, this writer
among them, think that Miller was the winner of the 60-yard dash at the
indoor intercollegiates. He certainly was ahead of Russell and Hussey five
yards from the tape.
Emerson Norton, that handsome behemoth of Georgetown, and his team
mate, Tony Plansky, the demon fullback, are two fine examples of big and fast
men. Norton is built like Grant's tomb, yet vaults more than twelve feet,
jumps more than six, and almost beat Chaarley Hoff in a very fast hurdle race
in their memorable indoor all-around test.
Earl Thomson, the hurdle champion, weighed 200 when he ran 14 2-5.
"Tiny" Hartranft has put the shot close to 51 feet and has run ten flat hun
dreds. And these are not the only examples of speed and power combined.
