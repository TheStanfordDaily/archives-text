# CARDINAL GYM TEAM WINS FOURTH PLACE IN SOUTHERN MEET
## 
### 
Interest in Stanford's gym team re
ceived a decided impetus when the
Cardinals took fourth place in the
A.A.U. state gym meet held last Friday
at the U.S.C. gymnasium, according
to Charles W. Davis, coach of the
Stanford men, who returned to the
campus Sunday night.
Dual and triangular meets with
Pomona, U.C. Southern Branch, U.S.C.,
and California will probably be sched
uled in order to place the Cardinal
gym team on a basis with those of
other coast universities, and to in
crease interest in this sport.
Although handicapped by the ab
sence of Wayne Smith, star performer,
the Cardinal men were able to take
eight points in the contest, which was
won by Southern Branch. The meet,
which was the A.A.U. and the inter
collegiate state meet combined, was

by far the closest competition yet
furnished by the Cardinal men, several
experts of national fame being en
tered. Captain-elect Ray Taylor scored
second in the calisthentics exercise
and third in the Longhorn, King took
fourth in the mat, and Beckwith fourth
in the ring exercises. Ellis Abbe, the
fourth Stanford man, was unable to
place.
The Cardinal gymnasts will be led
next year by Ray Taylor, who was
elested captain prior to the team's de
parture last Wednesday. Sterling Beck
with will manage the team.
