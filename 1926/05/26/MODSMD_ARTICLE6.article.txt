Freshmen who have not yet done so
may sign up at the meeting of the I
1927 Quad managerial staff at 7:30
o'clock tomorrow night, in the Quad j
business office in the Old Union. A
large number of prospective tryoutees j
J appeared at the first meeting, held last
] Thursday, but Robert Paradise, man-,
ager of the annual which will appear a '
| year from now, states that he will still
sign up applicants. Very little actual
work will be done this quarter; the
main purpose is to get the tryoutees
lined up.
A business manager and two assist- j
I ants, making three paid positions in i
all, will be selected from the tryoutees
1 of the class of 1929 on the basis of the
work they do in the coming year. One
!of the positions is that of women's
! manager, so that women tryoutees are
j especially desired.
