# FRENCH REVOLUTION PAPERS DISPLAYED BY HOOVER LIBRARY
## Louis XV Signature Appears On Old Treasury Order; Gift of Collector 
### 
The actual signature of Louis XV
of France appears on one of the docu
ments that was placed in the Hoover
War Library showcases yesterday. The
paper is written in French in hand
writing resembling the medieval Latin
script, and appears to be an order on
the treasury.
The papers among which this docu
ment is found are part of a sheaf that
was presented to the Stanford library
by the family of the French gentleman
who had collected them. The collector,
who died last autumn, and his father
were in Paris during the revolution of
1848, and acquired some of the papers
that were removed from the palace
of the Tuileries by the revolutionists.
Most of the papers date from the reign
of Louis Philippe, but some are older.
A few go back to the reign of Louis
XIV.
Fireworks Prohibited
Among these last is a proclamation
of the prime minister, Mazarin, an
nouncing the appointment of the Sieur
de Berthelot as commissioner on fire
works, and warning the French that
fireworks are to be used only by per
mission of the government. The procla
mation is signed by Berthelot himself,
as well as by other officials. It is
dated April 9, 1C65. It bears a seal
whose impression remains only on the
paper that was folded over the wax.
The wax has almost entirely disinte
grated.
Another of the papers of this epoch
is an appointment of two guardians
for a minor. This is so faded in places
as to be illegible. Some of the words
are completely effaced. The paper has
been crumpled, and someone has scrib
bled across the back of it.
Two papers which go together are
a permit from the Duke of Orleans to
an Italian marionette-showman, Ono
frio Mignone, to establish a theatre
and use the name of the Duke de
Nemours as patron, and a complaint
registered by Mignone that he was pre
vented from doing so. The first is a
document bearing the seal of Orleans.
The second is a regular law brief.
The last two papers of the present
exhibit are apparently half-pages from
a parchment hymn-book. One of them
is the chant for the celebration of
Pentecost, with a picture in oils and
gilt on the reverse side. The other is
for the day of Assumption, with a pic
ture of the Assumption on the other
side. This latter is dated August 15.
