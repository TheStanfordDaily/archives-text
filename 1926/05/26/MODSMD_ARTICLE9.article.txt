# Dr. Louis Newman To Explain Trend Of American Life
## 
### 
"Who Shall Inherit the United
States?" will be the subject of an ad
dress to be given by Dr. Louis I.
Newman at 7:45 o'clock tonight in the
lobby of the Old Union, under the
auspices of the Euphronia Debating
Society.
Dr. Newman will present a general
picture of modern American life, and
explain its effect on the future genera
tions. He is to give a general survey
of the present trend in politics, philo
sophy, literature, and religion, based
on his wide experiences in different
parts of the United States.
The speaker will be introduced by
the Rev. D. Charles Gardner, Univer
sity chaplain. Dr. Newman, who is
now Rabbi of the Temple Emanu-El,
San Francisco, attended the University
of California and graduated from
Brown University.
Fights Religion in Schools
After several years as a clergyman
in New York City, Dr. Newman came
to San Francisco in 1924, to become
one of the youngest religious leaders
of the city. At the present time he is
making a determined fight against the
introduction of religious teaching in
the public schools.
Dr. Newman gave the invocation at
the Charter Day exercises of the Uni
versity of California this year, and
has addressed many clubs and organi
zations recently on the question of
evolution, under the auspices of the
Science League.
Backs Reformed Judaism
Being a friend and disciple of Dr.
Stephen S. Wise, the speaker is one
of the exponents of the new reformed
Judaism and has broken away from
many of the old orthodox ideas. His
addresses are of the intellectual type,
and he has a refined, forceful manner
of speaking.
New officers for the coming year will
be elected at the annual Euphronia
Society banquet to be held in the New
Union Tuesday evening. Tonight's
meeting will include the last open dis
cussion for the quarter.
