# CARDINALS FACE STRONG FIELD IN I.C.4-A. EVENTS
## U.S.C. to Furnish Stiffest Competition in Race for Championship MILLER'S COLD IS WORSE Stanford Quarter-Miler Is Seriously Handicapped By Illness 
### Calvin Behle 
Ted Miller, premier Pacific Coast
quarter-miler and one of Stan
ford's best bids for first place in
that event, has developed a severe
cold and is not expected to figure
in the intercollegiate meet, accord
ing to a letter received yesterday
from Graduate Manager Al Mas
ters, who is accompanying the
Cardinal track men. Miller con
tracted the cold just prior to his
departure for the East, and on
the long trip to Cambridge it has
grown steadily worse. With Storie
remaining at Palo Alto and Miller
not in condition, Babcock, captain
elect, is the only one of Stanford's
great 440 men who will bid for
I.C.A.A.A.A. honors.
Facing what is probably the strong
est galaxy of stars which has ever
assembled for an I.C.A.A.A.A. meet,
twelve Stanford track men, led by
Coach Dink Templeton, will open to
morrow their assault on the track and
field championship. Preliminary heats
will be held tomorrow, while the finals
will be run off at Cambridge Saturday.
Stanford's chances for winning the
title would seem extremely favorable,
if it were not for the ever-present
threat of the veteran Dean Cromwell's
Trojans who, fifteen strong, are de
fending their championship of last
year. U.S.C.'s threat lies in five nation
al. Olympic, or 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. cham
pions, with twenty-five points practi
cally assured.
Western Teams Balanced
Although practically every college
entered has one or more potential
point-winners, the two western uni
versities, followed by California, pre
sent the best-balanced teams. Eastern
meets have been decidedly lacking in
all-around competition, although indi
vidual efforts have established many
enviable marks.
Stanford's title hopes depend largely
on her success in the middle distances,
•where Palo Alto fans are confident of
supremacy. Richardson's time of
1:53.8 has not been n< ired this year
