# CARDINALS FACE STRONG FIELD IN I.C.4-A. EVENTS
## U.S.C. to Furnish Stiffest Competition in Race for Championship MILLER'S COLD IS WORSE Stanford Quarter-Miler Is Seriously Handicapped By Illness 
### Calvin Behle 
Ted Miller, premier Pacific Coast
quarter-miler and one of Stan
ford's best bids for first place in
that event, has developed a severe
cold and is not expected to figure
in the intercollegiate meet, accord
ing to a letter received yesterday
from Graduate Manager Al Mas
ters, who is accompanying the
Cardinal track men. Miller con
tracted the cold just prior to his
departure for the East, and on
the long trip to Cambridge it has
grown steadily worse. With Storie
remaining at Palo Alto and Miller
not in condition, Babcock, captain
elect, is the only one of Stanford's
great 440 men who will bid for
I.C.A.A.A.A. honors.
Facing what is probably the strong
est galaxy of stars which has ever
assembled for an I.C.A.A.A.A. meet,
twelve Stanford track men, led by
Coach Dink Templeton, will open to
morrow their assault on the track and
field championship. Preliminary heats
will be held tomorrow, while the finals
will be run off at Cambridge Saturday.
Stanford's chances for winning the
title would seem extremely favorable,
if it were not for the ever-present
threat of the veteran Dean Cromwell's
Trojans who, fifteen strong, are de
fending their championship of last
year. U.S.C.'s threat lies in five nation
al. Olympic, or 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. cham
pions, with twenty-five points practi
cally assured.
Western Teams Balanced
Although practically every college
entered has one or more potential
point-winners, the two western uni
versities, followed by California, pre
sent the best-balanced teams. Eastern
meets have been decidedly lacking in
all-around competition, although indi
vidual efforts have established many
enviable marks.
Stanford's title hopes depend largely
on her success in the middle distances,
•where Palo Alto fans are confident of
supremacy. Richardson's time of
1:53.8 has not been n< ired this year
by any other lialf-miler, nor has Ted j
Miller's record of 48.0 in the quarter.
A potential win of the former, how- ■
ever, is seriously disputed by "Soapy" i
Watters of Harvard, running his last
race for the Crimson. Watters beat j
the Card captain in Stanford's last
participation in 1924, but this year;
has not done better than 1:55. Hogan, i
Yale, Campbell, Columbia, and Leness, !
M.1.T., are also exceptionally strong j
men in this event, while Boyden, Bruin ;
star, will again bid for a victory over J
his rival of three years in Stanford-1
California competition. The winning
time in this event should approach the
meet record and world's mark for the
half set by Ted Meredith, former,
Pen sylvan ia star.
Miller Faces Strong Field
Ted Miller of Stanford is another
runner whose ability will be tested
against the I.C.A.A.A.A. field. Miller
is probably the fastest 440 man ever
to run on the Pacific Coast, but it is
a vital question to Stanford if he can
come through after the long trip.
Times comparable to those of Miller
have been very scarce in the East, but
such competition as the big meet of
the year produces will force Miller to
his best to place among the first to
the tape.
Honors in the weight events, con
ceding at the outset the hammerthrow
to the East, present a decidedly West
ern atmosphere. Houser, TJ.S.C.'s world
champion discus thrower, Hoffman of
Stanford, Gerkin of California, and
Aleksi ,also of U.S.C., have made
marks in both the discus and shot
which have been unequaled in the East
this year. Houser will be defending
his title won last year in the discus,
although Hills of Princeton edged him
into second place in the shot.
Both hurdle events also seem to
have a California color, with Grumbles,
Dye, Stever, Kaer, and Reynolds, all
of U.S.C., outnumbering contenders
from any other university. The former
two are 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. champions,
while Reynolds, Stever, and Kaer will
also be in the running. West of Stan
ford, Moore of Penn State, Ragan of
California, and Lawrence of Princeton
are the only entrants who will seri
ously dispute the Trojan five.
Stars in Sprints
The two sprint events finds another
field of stars, including Barber of
California, Norton of Yale, Hussey of
M.1.T., Miller of Harvard, and the Tro-

Jans, House, Smith, and Parsons. All
of these men have bettered ten flat
in the century and 22 seconds in the
220.
Harlow of Stanford has made the
best official distance this season in the
javelin, but with Leyden, of Maine,
throwing 195 feet, Cook of U.S.C.
throwing 189, and Harlow's teammate.
Shipkey, tossing the spear 192 feet,
the winner of this event should estab
lish a new I.C.A.A.A.A. mark of over
200 feet.
A win In both jumps seems prob
able for a western entry, but. the ques
tion of which man is doubtful. Norton
of Yale won last year with a jump of
23 feet 11% inches in the broad jump.
Bondshii, California, and Meeks, Stan
ford, have both done over 24 feet in
competition this year, while McCrae,
Stanford, and Dikeman, Princeton,
have surpassed the 23-foot mark. Ross
and Coggeshall, U.S.C., Hampton, Cali
fornia, and both King and Work of
Stanford have all bettered 6 feet 3
inches this year, a full inch better
than recorded by any Eastern entrant.
King, who has cleared 6 feet 4 inches,
seems to have the edge on the field.
Ted Miller, premier Pacific Coast

year. U.S.C.'s threat lies in five nation
al. Olympic, or 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. cham
pions, with twenty-five points practi
cally assured.
Western Teams Balanced
Although practically every college
entered has one or more potential
point-winners, the two western uni
versities, followed by California, pre
sent the best-balanced teams. Eastern
meets have been decidedly lacking in
all-around competition, although indi
vidual efforts have established many
enviable marks.
Stanford's title hopes depend largely
on her success in the middle distances,
•where Palo Alto fans are confident of
supremacy. Richardson's time of
1:53.8 has not been n< ired this year
by any other lialf-miler, nor has Ted j
Miller's record of 48.0 in the quarter.
A potential win of the former, how- ■
ever, is seriously disputed by "Soapy" i
Watters of Harvard, running his last
race for the Crimson. Watters beat j
the Card captain in Stanford's last
participation in 1924, but this year;
has not done better than 1:55. Hogan, i
Yale, Campbell, Columbia, and Leness, !
M.1.T., are also exceptionally strong j
men in this event, while Boyden, Bruin ;
star, will again bid for a victory over J
his rival of three years in Stanford-1
California competition. The winning
time in this event should approach the
meet record and world's mark for the
half set by Ted Meredith, former,
Pen sylvan ia star.
Miller Faces Strong Field
Ted Miller of Stanford is another
runner whose ability will be tested
against the I.C.A.A.A.A. field. Miller
is probably the fastest 440 man ever
to run on the Pacific Coast, but it is
a vital question to Stanford if he can
come through after the long trip.
Times comparable to those of Miller
have been very scarce in the East, but
such competition as the big meet of
the year produces will force Miller to
his best to place among the first to
the tape.
Honors in the weight events, con
ceding at the outset the hammerthrow
to the East, present a decidedly West
ern atmosphere. Houser, TJ.S.C.'s world
champion discus thrower, Hoffman of
Stanford, Gerkin of California, and
Aleksi ,also of U.S.C., have made
marks in both the discus and shot
which have been unequaled in the East
this year. Houser will be defending
his title won last year in the discus,
although Hills of Princeton edged him
into second place in the shot.
Both hurdle events also seem to
have a California color, with Grumbles,
Dye, Stever, Kaer, and Reynolds, all
of U.S.C., outnumbering contenders
from any other university. The former
two are 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. champions,
while Reynolds, Stever, and Kaer will
also be in the running. West of Stan
ford, Moore of Penn State, Ragan of
California, and Lawrence of Princeton
are the only entrants who will seri
ously dispute the Trojan five.
Stars in Sprints
The two sprint events finds another
field of stars, including Barber of
California, Norton of Yale, Hussey of
M.1.T., Miller of Harvard, and the Tro-

Jans, House, Smith, and Parsons. All
of these men have bettered ten flat
in the century and 22 seconds in the
220.
Harlow of Stanford has made the
best official distance this season in the
javelin, but with Leyden, of Maine,
throwing 195 feet, Cook of U.S.C.
throwing 189, and Harlow's teammate.
Shipkey, tossing the spear 192 feet,
the winner of this event should estab
lish a new I.C.A.A.A.A. mark of over
200 feet.
A win In both jumps seems prob
able for a western entry, but. the ques
tion of which man is doubtful. Norton
of Yale won last year with a jump of
23 feet 11% inches in the broad jump.
Bondshii, California, and Meeks, Stan
ford, have both done over 24 feet in
competition this year, while McCrae,
Stanford, and Dikeman, Princeton,
have surpassed the 23-foot mark. Ross
and Coggeshall, U.S.C., Hampton, Cali
fornia, and both King and Work of
Stanford have all bettered 6 feet 3
inches this year, a full inch better
than recorded by any Eastern entrant.
King, who has cleared 6 feet 4 inches,
seems to have the edge on the field.
Ted Miller, premier Pacific Coast
quarter-miler and one of Stan
ford's best bids for first place in
that event, has developed a severe
cold and is not expected to figure
in the intercollegiate meet, accord
ing to a letter received yesterday
from Graduate Manager Al Mas
ters, who is accompanying the
Cardinal track men. Miller con
tracted the cold just prior to his
departure for the East, and on
the long trip to Cambridge it has
grown steadily worse. With Storie
remaining at Palo Alto and Miller
not in condition, Babcock, captain
elect, is the only one of Stanford's
great 440 men who will bid for
I.C.A.A.A.A. honors.
Facing what is probably the strong
est galaxy of stars which has ever
assembled for an I.C.A.A.A.A. meet,
twelve Stanford track men, led by
Coach Dink Templeton, will open to
morrow their assault on the track and
field championship. Preliminary heats
will be held tomorrow, while the finals
will be run off at Cambridge Saturday.
Stanford's chances for winning the
title would seem extremely favorable,
if it were not for the ever-present
threat of the veteran Dean Cromwell's
Trojans who, fifteen strong, are de
fending their championship of last
year. U.S.C.'s threat lies in five nation

his rival of three years in Stanford-1
California competition. The winning
time in this event should approach the
meet record and world's mark for the
half set by Ted Meredith, former,
Pen sylvan ia star.
Miller Faces Strong Field
Ted Miller of Stanford is another
runner whose ability will be tested
against the I.C.A.A.A.A. field. Miller
is probably the fastest 440 man ever
to run on the Pacific Coast, but it is
a vital question to Stanford if he can
come through after the long trip.
Times comparable to those of Miller
have been very scarce in the East, but
such competition as the big meet of
the year produces will force Miller to
his best to place among the first to
the tape.
Honors in the weight events, con
ceding at the outset the hammerthrow
to the East, present a decidedly West
ern atmosphere. Houser, TJ.S.C.'s world
champion discus thrower, Hoffman of
Stanford, Gerkin of California, and
Aleksi ,also of U.S.C., have made
marks in both the discus and shot
which have been unequaled in the East
this year. Houser will be defending
his title won last year in the discus,
although Hills of Princeton edged him
into second place in the shot.
Both hurdle events also seem to
have a California color, with Grumbles,
Dye, Stever, Kaer, and Reynolds, all
of U.S.C., outnumbering contenders
from any other university. The former
two are 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. champions,
while Reynolds, Stever, and Kaer will
also be in the running. West of Stan
ford, Moore of Penn State, Ragan of
California, and Lawrence of Princeton
are the only entrants who will seri
ously dispute the Trojan five.
Stars in Sprints
The two sprint events finds another
field of stars, including Barber of
California, Norton of Yale, Hussey of
M.1.T., Miller of Harvard, and the Tro-

Jans, House, Smith, and Parsons. All
of these men have bettered ten flat
in the century and 22 seconds in the
220.
Harlow of Stanford has made the
best official distance this season in the
javelin, but with Leyden, of Maine,
throwing 195 feet, Cook of U.S.C.
throwing 189, and Harlow's teammate.
Shipkey, tossing the spear 192 feet,
the winner of this event should estab
lish a new I.C.A.A.A.A. mark of over
200 feet.
A win In both jumps seems prob
able for a western entry, but. the ques
tion of which man is doubtful. Norton
of Yale won last year with a jump of
23 feet 11% inches in the broad jump.
Bondshii, California, and Meeks, Stan
ford, have both done over 24 feet in
competition this year, while McCrae,
Stanford, and Dikeman, Princeton,
have surpassed the 23-foot mark. Ross
and Coggeshall, U.S.C., Hampton, Cali
fornia, and both King and Work of
Stanford have all bettered 6 feet 3
inches this year, a full inch better
than recorded by any Eastern entrant.
King, who has cleared 6 feet 4 inches,
seems to have the edge on the field.
Ted Miller, premier Pacific Coast
quarter-miler and one of Stan
ford's best bids for first place in
that event, has developed a severe
cold and is not expected to figure
in the intercollegiate meet, accord
ing to a letter received yesterday
from Graduate Manager Al Mas
ters, who is accompanying the
Cardinal track men. Miller con
tracted the cold just prior to his
departure for the East, and on
the long trip to Cambridge it has
grown steadily worse. With Storie
remaining at Palo Alto and Miller
not in condition, Babcock, captain
elect, is the only one of Stanford's
great 440 men who will bid for
I.C.A.A.A.A. honors.
Facing what is probably the strong
est galaxy of stars which has ever
assembled for an I.C.A.A.A.A. meet,
twelve Stanford track men, led by
Coach Dink Templeton, will open to
morrow their assault on the track and
field championship. Preliminary heats
will be held tomorrow, while the finals
will be run off at Cambridge Saturday.
Stanford's chances for winning the
title would seem extremely favorable,
if it were not for the ever-present
threat of the veteran Dean Cromwell's
Trojans who, fifteen strong, are de
fending their championship of last
year. U.S.C.'s threat lies in five nation
al. Olympic, or 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. cham
pions, with twenty-five points practi
cally assured.
Western Teams Balanced
Although practically every college
entered has one or more potential
point-winners, the two western uni
versities, followed by California, pre
sent the best-balanced teams. Eastern
meets have been decidedly lacking in
all-around competition, although indi
vidual efforts have established many
enviable marks.
Stanford's title hopes depend largely
on her success in the middle distances,
•where Palo Alto fans are confident of
supremacy. Richardson's time of
1:53.8 has not been n< ired this year
by any other lialf-miler, nor has Ted j
Miller's record of 48.0 in the quarter.
A potential win of the former, how- ■
ever, is seriously disputed by "Soapy" i
Watters of Harvard, running his last
race for the Crimson. Watters beat j
the Card captain in Stanford's last
participation in 1924, but this year;
has not done better than 1:55. Hogan, i
Yale, Campbell, Columbia, and Leness, !
M.1.T., are also exceptionally strong j
men in this event, while Boyden, Bruin ;
star, will again bid for a victory over J
his rival of three years in Stanford-1
California competition. The winning
time in this event should approach the
meet record and world's mark for the
