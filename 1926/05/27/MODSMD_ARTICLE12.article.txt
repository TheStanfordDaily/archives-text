# BREAKERS' SQUAD CLOSE TO RECORD IN RELAY TRIALS
## MAKES TIME OF 3:12.5 Delta Chi, Betas, Phi Delts, Theta Chi Take Other Preliminaries 
### 
Failing by but two-fifths of a second
to break its own intramural relay rec
ord for the mile, the Breakers' eight
man team qualified for the finals, eas
ily defeating the rival teams entered
in the third trial heat run off yester
day afternoon. Winners of the four
other heats are Delta Chi, Beta Theta
Pi, Phi Delta Theta, and Theta Chi.
These teams will compete for the
championship tomorrow.
Breakers' time of 3:12.5, made in a
trial heat, seems to indicate strongly
that the present record of 3:12.2 will
go by the boards for the third year in
succession. The eight eating club men
have been in training for the event
for the past week. Under the close
competition which is certain to be fur
nished by the other four finalists
Breakers will be extended to their
best in order to win the placque.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi's eight with a trial time
of 3:15.7, and Phi Delta Theta with a
mark of 3:18.2, will offer Breakers
severest competition in the finals. Nei
ther of these teams were pressed to
win their heats. Beta Theta Pi dealt
the Kappa Sigs a serious blow to the
latter's hopes for the year's intramural
championship by eliminating them in
the slowest time made in any of the
five heats, winning in 3:22 flat. Theta
Chi defeated Branner and Zeta Psi
in the other heat, the Theta Chi's run
ning the mile in 3:21.1.
Move than three hundred students
and participants witnessed yesterday's
races, an attendance greater than has
heretofore shown up for intramural
events. The discus and half-mile
events of the track and field meet will
be held today, deciding not only the
team championship but the winner of
the gold medal for the highest indi
vidual scorer. Wally Jayred, Alpha
Delta Phi, is at present leading.
The outcome of the year's intramu
ral championship will be decided by
the track meet and relay, those closing
competition for the year. Breakers are
at present leading with 146 points, but
are closely pressed by the Betas with
145 points. Breakers are again favored
because of their strong relay team
and track and field men, although the
Betas are decidedly not out of the
running. Kappa Sigma was virtually
eliminated from title hopes by the
Betas, but have a strong team entered
in the track meet. S.A.E., Phi Delta
Theta, and Theta Chi are all among
the leading contenders.

championship by eliminating them in
the slowest time made in any of the
five heats, winning in 3:22 flat. Theta
Chi defeated Branner and Zeta Psi
in the other heat, the Theta Chi's run
ning the mile in 3:21.1.
Move than three hundred students
and participants witnessed yesterday's
races, an attendance greater than has
heretofore shown up for intramural
events. The discus and half-mile
events of the track and field meet will
be held today, deciding not only the
team championship but the winner of
the gold medal for the highest indi
vidual scorer. Wally Jayred, Alpha
Delta Phi, is at present leading.
The outcome of the year's intramu
ral championship will be decided by
the track meet and relay, those closing
competition for the year. Breakers are
at present leading with 146 points, but
are closely pressed by the Betas with
145 points. Breakers are again favored
because of their strong relay team
and track and field men, although the
Betas are decidedly not out of the
running. Kappa Sigma was virtually
eliminated from title hopes by the
Betas, but have a strong team entered
in the track meet. S.A.E., Phi Delta
Theta, and Theta Chi are all among
the leading contenders.
Failing by but two-fifths of a second
to break its own intramural relay rec
ord for the mile, the Breakers' eight
man team qualified for the finals, eas
ily defeating the rival teams entered
in the third trial heat run off yester
day afternoon. Winners of the four
other heats are Delta Chi, Beta Theta
Pi, Phi Delta Theta, and Theta Chi.
These teams will compete for the
championship tomorrow.
Breakers' time of 3:12.5, made in a
trial heat, seems to indicate strongly
that the present record of 3:12.2 will
go by the boards for the third year in
succession. The eight eating club men
have been in training for the event
for the past week. Under the close
competition which is certain to be fur
nished by the other four finalists
Breakers will be extended to their
best in order to win the placque.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi's eight with a trial time
of 3:15.7, and Phi Delta Theta with a
mark of 3:18.2, will offer Breakers
severest competition in the finals. Nei
ther of these teams were pressed to
win their heats. Beta Theta Pi dealt
the Kappa Sigs a serious blow to the
latter's hopes for the year's intramural
championship by eliminating them in
the slowest time made in any of the
five heats, winning in 3:22 flat. Theta
Chi defeated Branner and Zeta Psi
in the other heat, the Theta Chi's run
