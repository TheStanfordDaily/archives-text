# A. S. S. U. WILL GET PROFITS OF ROOTERS' HATS NEXT SEASON
## 
### 
By a contract recently accepted by the
A.S.S.U. all proceeds from the sale of
rooters' hats will go to the student
body. The contract was made with
Roos Brothers, Inc., of Palo Alto, who
will sell the hats to students at the
regular price, but will turn all profits
over to the A.S.S.U. treasury. No other
store will be allowed to sell the hats.
Competitive bidding lias heretofore
been held, in which the clothiers of
Palo Alto vied with each other to
gain the hat-sale concession. The offer
by Roos Brothers is an entirely new
thing, and was readily accepted by the
Associated Students.
