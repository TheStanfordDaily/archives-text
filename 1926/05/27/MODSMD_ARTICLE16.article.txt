# POLO SEASON CLOSES WITH TOURNEY FOR INTERCLASS TROPHY
## Preliminary Matches Start Monday; Junior Squad Favored to Win 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
The polo season will end next week
with the play for the interclass trophy.
Teams from the four classes will meet
in preliminary matches on Monday
and Wednesday, and the winner will
be decided in the final round Friday.
The games will be held on Encina
field. The competition was not held
last year, but in the two years before
the contests went to the class of 1924.
All the teams entered are known to
be good except the freshman squad,
which is an unknown quantity. The
1929 team has been working hard and
may be a surprise when it meets the
juniors in the first game Monday at
2 o'clock.
The other teams in the tournament
are almost toss-ups. The seniors are
relying on the brilliance of Vander
burgh, varsity star, at No. 2 position.
In addition, with George Baker at the
goal, 1926 class has an equally strong
defensive player.
Griffith, at No. 3. was a member of
the varsity squad at the beginning of
the year, but has not turned out for
polo this quarter. Beckwith at the re
maining position has but this year's
experience with the second squad be
hind him. Kahle, also new to the game,
may substitute for Beckwith.
If Captain Fred Trotter plays, the
entire junior team will be composed
of varsity material. Trotter, however,
may not be able to compete, due to
his injury earlier in the season.
Kenneth Krohn and Kenneth Brown
at No. 1 and No. 2, are two of the
factors which point to a probable jun
ior victory. Both men have partici
pated in most of the intercollegiate
games this year, and have shown
themselves to be dependable. With
Wally Rothrock at No. 3, the team
is completed.
The sophomores, although muster
ing a redoubtable crew, are putting
reliance most on teamwork. With this
end in view, the men have been prac
ticing more consistently than the
other teams. First in ability on the
squad is Tex Thompson, varsity star,
who lias shown the most remarkable
rise of any man on the team this sea
son.
Backing him up are Weymouth at
No. 3 and Austin at No. 1. both of
whom are varsity players of ability.
Frank Triest fills up the quartet at
No. 4. George Connolly, who may sub
stitute for Austin, is a strong hitter,
but rather irregular.
The freshman squad, composed of
Lloyd Vance, Sam Hayes, Joe Bitter
lin, and Jack Dill, with Larry Carlson
in reserve, has a disadvantage in that
they are not eligible for varsity com
petition, and therefore must play with
inferior horses in the second string.
The first game is called Monday at
2 o'clock. Wednesday, the sophomores
and seniors meet, and Friday the win
ners will fight it out for the cup. Both
matches will be at 2 o'clock. There
will be no admission charge for the
games. Four chukkers of seven and a
half minutes each will be played.

of varsity material. Trotter, however,
may not be able to compete, due to
his injury earlier in the season.
Kenneth Krohn and Kenneth Brown
at No. 1 and No. 2, are two of the
factors which point to a probable jun
ior victory. Both men have partici
pated in most of the intercollegiate
games this year, and have shown
themselves to be dependable. With
Wally Rothrock at No. 3, the team
is completed.
The sophomores, although muster
ing a redoubtable crew, are putting
reliance most on teamwork. With this
end in view, the men have been prac
ticing more consistently than the
other teams. First in ability on the
squad is Tex Thompson, varsity star,
who lias shown the most remarkable
rise of any man on the team this sea
son.
Backing him up are Weymouth at
No. 3 and Austin at No. 1. both of
whom are varsity players of ability.
Frank Triest fills up the quartet at
No. 4. George Connolly, who may sub
stitute for Austin, is a strong hitter,
but rather irregular.
The freshman squad, composed of
Lloyd Vance, Sam Hayes, Joe Bitter
lin, and Jack Dill, with Larry Carlson
in reserve, has a disadvantage in that
they are not eligible for varsity com
petition, and therefore must play with
inferior horses in the second string.
The first game is called Monday at
2 o'clock. Wednesday, the sophomores
and seniors meet, and Friday the win
ners will fight it out for the cup. Both
matches will be at 2 o'clock. There
will be no admission charge for the
games. Four chukkers of seven and a
half minutes each will be played.
The polo season will end next week
with the play for the interclass trophy.
Teams from the four classes will meet
in preliminary matches on Monday
and Wednesday, and the winner will
be decided in the final round Friday.
The games will be held on Encina
field. The competition was not held
last year, but in the two years before
the contests went to the class of 1924.
All the teams entered are known to
be good except the freshman squad,
which is an unknown quantity. The
1929 team has been working hard and
may be a surprise when it meets the
juniors in the first game Monday at
2 o'clock.
The other teams in the tournament
are almost toss-ups. The seniors are
relying on the brilliance of Vander
burgh, varsity star, at No. 2 position.
In addition, with George Baker at the
goal, 1926 class has an equally strong
defensive player.
Griffith, at No. 3. was a member of
the varsity squad at the beginning of
the year, but has not turned out for
polo this quarter. Beckwith at the re
maining position has but this year's
experience with the second squad be
hind him. Kahle, also new to the game,
may substitute for Beckwith.
If Captain Fred Trotter plays, the
entire junior team will be composed
of varsity material. Trotter, however,
may not be able to compete, due to
his injury earlier in the season.
