"The Students' Organization Fund was organized in Octobcr 1919. for the
purpose of consolidating and co-ordinating the accounts carricd by various student
organizations. Its business is carried out under the direction of the Manager and
Treasurer appointed by the President, and the Executive Committee of the Associated
Students. The details of the Organization follow :
"1. All student organizations receiving subscriptions, assessments, donations, or
other funds, with the exception of living groups, and of clubs or societies whose
income is less than $50 per year, operate through the Students' Organization Fund.
Any student organization, regardless of the qualifications above, may, upon applica
tion, have the use of the Fund."—Current Report of the Students' Organisation l'und.
Campus clubs, societies, and publications have been benefitted greatly
by the establishment of the Fund. It not only provides a central account
ing' bureau; but in addition is a reliable check on their expenditures.
Many groups have recognized the benefits of the system and, even though
they do not solicit funds outside their own membership, have joined. But
there is one campus group which by all legal rights should be in the
organization, and which has withheld from entering. This group is the
Stanford Y.M.C.A.
The main reason for not joining, as we understand it, is that of the
amount raised by the Y.M.C.A., only a small portion is collected from the
students —last year's books show that of the total income, $8,685.71, the
students contributed $424.40. But they also show that the faculty, parents
of students, alumni, and the students themselves gave $4,637.09, or more
than half of the total amount raised.
To come under the Fund, an organization must annually pay a fee
based on the amount of money which is handled; and this seems to be
another argument used by the Y.M.C.A. I his reason would seem to
hold ljtrle water when we consider that all the rest of the campus societies
are paying the required fee.
