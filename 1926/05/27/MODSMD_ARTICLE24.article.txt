We have always been somewhat skeptical about the corrector system
as it is employed in the larger classes at the University. It is inconceiv
able that the corrector will treat someone for whom he has no use as char
itably as he will a friend. He may have the best of intentions; but uncon
sciously will make slight concessions to those whom he likes. It is human
nature to do so.
Rut there is one professor at Stanford who has eliminated any chance
of this occurring. Before the bluebooks are turiÂ«ed over to his assistants
the covers are torn from them. Thus the corrector has no way of telling
whose paper he is correcting, unless he is familiar with the handwriting.
When the papers have been graded it is an easy matter to restore the covers
to the proper book for the students are instructed to write their seat num
bers l)Oth on the cover and at the top of the first page of text.
It would be well if all the instructors of large classes gave this system
a trial. If it proves popular, the bluebooks in the future could contain a
perforated coupon upon which the student could write his name. A serial
number could be placed on the detachable piece and the same number on
the main portion of the examination book. This last named method would
expedite matters somewhat.
