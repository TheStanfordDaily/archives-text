# Shifting the Blame
## 
### 
Some clay the male population of the United States may rise in right
ful indignation, cancel the Nineteenth amendment, refuse to allow women
to enter the business world, and do away with co-education. But until all
this is accomplished the Stanford campus must tolerate each year a
women's edition of the Daily. The 1926 version will appear tomorrow.
Last year the sheet was titled the "Daily Pink," and the women jour
nalists modestly substituted small pictures of carnations for the dashes
which are ordinarily used to separate stories. Jt was a rather foggy
metaphor, hut the flowers represented the "pink of perfection." Ihe pre
liminary proceedings are a deep secret and we can only guess what will
creep in tomorrow's paper; but the editor announces in advance that he
will positively not he responsible. A shout from the outside ofiice indi
cates that the rest of the men members of the staff also deny any part in
(he undertaking.
There will be 110 edition of the Daily at all Monday, partly because the
printers will need a day's vacation after tomorrow's ordeal, partly to give
the editor time to rejoin the straggling remnants of his prized possession;
but primarily because Memorial Day falls on a Sunday and the me
chanical workers desire Monday as their day off.
Enough has been said. The "gals will have the last word.

Unusual thought overtakes editorial writer on The Heights, Boston
College:
"Sophomorcse Next jcar you sliall have attained to the dignity of Juniors."
