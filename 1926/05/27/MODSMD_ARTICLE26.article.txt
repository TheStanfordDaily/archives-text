# SPORTS OF 1926
## The 						Head Weighter 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Tomorrow is a big day in the life of Bud Houser, of Los Angeles. In j
the Harvard stadium at Cambridge, this mild-mannered young giant from j
California leads his team-mates in the defense of their title as Champions of !
America in the annual meeting of the I.C.A.A.A.A. And Captain Houser will
be fighting for a victory for Southern California, for the Pacific Coast, and for j
himself, in his last appearance in the East as a college athlete. It may be j
said right here, that no athlete ever fights harder in a meet than this same !
Bud Houser. He is one of the greatest competitive athletes in the world today, i
Having known Bud since the days when he was startling the athletic world
with his achievements as a weight-thrower while a student at Oxnard High
School (near San Diego) in 1921, I can state that he is one of the most tireless
workers, one of the most ambitious, and withal one of the most modest of any ■
champion I have ever come in contact with. And, it might be added here, Bud ;
has other aims in life besider breaking shot and discus records. He graduates ■
from the U.S.C. dental school and takes the California State board exams next j
month.
Bud's athletic career is studded with glittering performances. In 1921, j
when a high school boy. he won the National A.A.U. championship in the shot (
put. defeating the mighty Pat McDonald. Although a considerably smaller
man. he has shown conclusively his superiority over "Tiny" Hartrant't, the j
Pacific Coast's other 50-foot shot-putter and 156-foot discus-thrower. He has
twice broken the world's record in the discus. He holds both the Olympic and
the National titles in both of his favorite events, and is the present 1.C.4-A i
discus champion. And he did all of this in spite of being named Clarence!
He should round out a glorious college career with a double victory in the
events of tomorrow and Saturday.
