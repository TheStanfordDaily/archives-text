# JAPANESE BASEBALL IS "UNTIRING FOR PITCHER"
## "ADOPTED BY MANY BIG GAMES" STATEMENT SAYS BUT STANFORD MEN WILL USE HOME PRODUCT 
### 
A Japanese-made baseball with a
genuine "Horse Hidecover" has been
received by Tom Quinn, manager of
the varsity ball team, which will leave
for its tour of Japan early next month.
The horse-hide sphere is to all outward
appearances of regulation size, weight,
and physical properties, but according
to the statement on the box, is is not
only "Untiring for Pitcher," but is
"Extraordinate Speedy" and has there
fore been "Adopted by Many # Big
Games."
The American national game has
came to be very popular in Japan, and
large crowds turn out to see contests
between university teams and to watch
the Extraordinate Speedy pitchers bat
tle untiringly for nine innings as they
heave one Horse Hidesphere after an
other.

Harry Wolter and thirteen members
of the Cardinal ball squad will leave
on June 8 for a trip to Japan via the
Hawaiian Islands. The tour will last
until September, and is under the au
spices of Waseda University of Japan.
The Waseda University ball team
plans a tour of the United States next
year and a two-game series will be
scheduled with the Cards at that time.
The schedule for the Stanford team
calls for twelve games on the other
side of the Pacific, seven in Tokyo,
five in Osaka, and possibly some in
Manchuria.
The Stanford players claim that
they will take their own domestic
baseballs on the trip, not trusting to
their ability to handle the supernormal
speed and power claimed for the Japa
nese product.
