R. J. Spiers, '22, who received a
position last March through the efforts
of the geology department, is conduct
ing geological exploration for the
Huasteca Petroleum Company at Tam
pico, Mexico. This company is a sub- j
nidiary of the Pan-American Petroleum j
Corporation, lately purchased by the
Standard Oil Company.
Spiers, who was holding a position
in Arizona when recommended to his !
present job by Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, !
expects to be trained in the use of the j
torsion balance, a new instrument for j
locating subterranean oil deposits. Sev- j
eral new oil fields have been located j
in Texas during the past year by its 1
use.
The instrument operates by measur-,
ing accurately slight differences in
jgravity. It is considered 1000 times
more accurate than the instruments
used in the physics laboratories for
similar measurements. The principle
involved is that different rocks have
different specific gravities, and there
fore exert varying forces in gravita
tional pull. In plotting the various j
pulls, some idea may be gained of the
underground formations by the use of
this instrument. Most large companies
are beginning to use the apparatus to
discover new oil strikes.
