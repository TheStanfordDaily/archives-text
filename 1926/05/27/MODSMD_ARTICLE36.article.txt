# RADIO STATION HAS BIG POWER INCREASE
## 
### 
With a new transmitter and other
new equipment, amateur radio station
601, owned and operated by Brandon
Wentworth and Phil Schofield, Stan
ford students, the power of the sta
tion has been increased from 50 to 250
watts.
Before the installation, signals from
England, Italy, Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, France, India, South America,
and China, had been picked up and
sent back with the old 50-watt. outfit.
With the new set the local students
have succeeded in communicating with
Lockfleld-on-Tyne, England, station
station G2CC. Contact was kept with
the English station for an hour.

Seniors at the University of Wash
ngton recently turned bootblacks and
collected over $500 by shining shoes.
