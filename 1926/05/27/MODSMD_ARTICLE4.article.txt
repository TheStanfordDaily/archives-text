# RACIAL GROUPS WILL NEVER OWN COUNTRY STATES DR. NEWMAN
## San Francisco Clergyman Addresses Meeting of Euphronia 
### 
"America will belong to those who
by their own strength and efforts, not
through racial or family inheritance,
are worthy to inherit the United
States," declared Dr. Louis I. Newman,
San Francisco clergyman, in an ad
dress given last night at an open meet
ing of the Euphronia Debating Society.
In discussing the question, "Who
Shall Inherit the United States," Dr.
Newman said, "There is a common
aspiration and hope in American life,
and to say that this country is to be
only Anglo-Saxon in culture is a pro
phecy which only the future can bear
out. America will not belong to any
one racial or religious group or a
combination of them.
America Still Young
"Although the true American is still
in the making, the people of tomor
row will not necessarily be the prod
uct of racial fusion through intermar
riage. The family idea will hold our
racial and religious groups in America
intact. There never can nor will be
one national American religion. This
country today and tomorrow wants
perfect Catholics, Protestants, and
Jews, not a mongrel or nondescript
type."
Dr. Newman pointed out that the
"melting pot" should melt political and
economic differences, but that racial
and religious groups are not to be de
stroyed in the United States of the
future. Through the co-operation of
existing cultural an dethical bodies of
people, the continuance of the Ameri
can nation depends, is the opinion of
Dr. Newman.
The speaker of the evening was in
troduced by the Rev. D. Charles Gard
ner, University chaplain. Following his
address. Dr. Newman answered ques
tions from the audience.
Members of Euphronia society will
hold their quarterly banquet Tuesday
evening in the Union. New officers for
the coming year will be elected at this
meeting, which will be the last of the
quarter.
