# STANFORD RIDERS WILL COMPETE IN R.O.T.C. EVENT
## WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE Nineteen Men Entered in Half-Mile; Judges Selected 
### 
The annual horse show, postponed
from last Saturday, will start tomor
row afternoon at 1:30 o'clock. The
first, event will be the Roman race,
after which will occur the ladies'
events, so that the women will have
an opportunity to participate in the
women's Field Day events.
Prizes for the several events have
been furnished by Palo Alto mer
chants. In addition, blue, red, and yel
low ribbons will be presented to the
first, second, and third place winners
in each event. A cup is awarded to
the winner of the horsemanship con
test. Prizes have been arranged by
William Enderud and Homer Dom
baugh.
The most popular event is the half
mile, with nineteen men entered. The
steeplechase with eleven entries, will
also prove interesting, as the course
is twice around and over eight Jumps.
In most of the events, the competition
will necessarily be limited by the cali
ber of the horses drawn. Thi3 will
notably take effect in the half-mile
and steeplechase events, where a few
horses stand out by their speed and
performance.
Several private horses are entered
in the events, notable among them
being Billy, a fine pinto owned by
Kenneth Brown, and Lady McJean,
the mount to be used by Martha Black
welder.
In the Roman race, the hope of most
of the entries will center on a mishap
to the "greys," Janette and Scott. For
several years this team has run, and
always won, because of their similarity
in size and gait. Ted Criley, mounted
on the greys this year, will receive a
handicap of several yards. Handicaps
seem not to bother them, for they won
handily by over thirty yards when
handicapped by twenty last year.
The judges for the competition are
Professors Payson J. Treat, Charles
B. Wing, James P. Mitchell, William
B. Owens, Dean George B. Culver,
Majors Power and Johnson, U.S-.A.,
and Dr. William Barrow. The officials
will be Major William Geary, Major
John Keliher, Captain Moses Petti
grew, and Lieutenant Charles Whit
