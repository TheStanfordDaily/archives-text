# CARDINALS CONCEDED CHANCE TO TAKE I.C.A.A.A.A. MEET
## West Coast Sends Stars to National Contest in Harvard Stadium YALE, HARVARD STRONG Illness of 440 Star Lessens Stanford Prospects in Quarter-Mile Race 
### 
This afternoon at Cambridge will
see the opening of the Fiftieth 1.C.4-A
meet with Stanford having a good
chance to chalk up her first win in
this championship contest.
The West Coast sends the two lead
ing contenders this year in U.S.C. and
Stanford, the East's strongest teams
being Yale aiid Harvard. What will
probably be the deciding factor in the
meet, other than the ability of Stan
ford's and U.S.C.'s men to come
through under competition, is in what
events some of tho small college indi
vidual stars get into tho scoring col
umn.
East May Surprise
Small colleges, by taking unexpected
places in the strong events of the
team doped to win, have in former
years ruined that team's chances for
the title.
With the breaks all in Stanford's
favor, the Cardinal should come out
on top, with U.S.C. close behind. If
Eastern teams take unexpected points
in the hurdles and weight events,
U.S.C.'s hope of victory will wane.
The majority of the Stanford points
should come in the middle distance
races, jumps, and javelin, with
weights, pole vault, and hurdles con
tributing a few points. Taking into
consideration only those records which
have been given some publicity, Stan
ford should win with 40 points, U.S.C.
scoring 39.
East Is Strong
In the sprints U.S.C. should score
two points with House and Smith. It
is here that the East, and especially
Yale and Harvard, are strong. Norton
and Clark of Yale and Miller of Har
vard should gather many points, as
Norton is given a good chance to win
the 100, and Clark should take the
220. Barber of California should press
both of them hard in these races.
Miller's cold lessens Stanford's
chances in the 440* to take first, but
Templeton may enter Richardson in
this event if there are not too many
heats in the 880. If Miller is well, he
should win. Richardson, if entered, has
a good chance to lead the field.
Richardson May Win
The half-mile will be a great race,
and should end in a victory for Bill
Richardson. "Soapy" Watters of Har
vard, who beat Richardson in the race
two years ago, will again make a
strong bid for first, but Richardson's
time has been the better this year,
