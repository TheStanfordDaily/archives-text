# CARDINALS CONCEDED CHANCE TO TAKE I.C.A.A.A.A. MEET
## West Coast Sends Stars to National Contest in Harvard Stadium YALE, HARVARD STRONG Illness of 440 Star Lessens Stanford Prospects in Quarter-Mile Race 
### 
This afternoon at Cambridge will
see the opening of the Fiftieth 1.C.4-A
meet with Stanford having a good
chance to chalk up her first win in
this championship contest.
The West Coast sends the two lead
ing contenders this year in U.S.C. and
Stanford, the East's strongest teams
being Yale aiid Harvard. What will
probably be the deciding factor in the
meet, other than the ability of Stan
ford's and U.S.C.'s men to come
through under competition, is in what
events some of tho small college indi
vidual stars get into tho scoring col
umn.
East May Surprise
Small colleges, by taking unexpected
places in the strong events of the
team doped to win, have in former
years ruined that team's chances for
the title.
With the breaks all in Stanford's
favor, the Cardinal should come out
on top, with U.S.C. close behind. If
Eastern teams take unexpected points
in the hurdles and weight events,
U.S.C.'s hope of victory will wane.
The majority of the Stanford points
should come in the middle distance
races, jumps, and javelin, with
weights, pole vault, and hurdles con
tributing a few points. Taking into
consideration only those records which
have been given some publicity, Stan
ford should win with 40 points, U.S.C.
scoring 39.
East Is Strong
In the sprints U.S.C. should score
two points with House and Smith. It
is here that the East, and especially
Yale and Harvard, are strong. Norton
and Clark of Yale and Miller of Har
vard should gather many points, as
Norton is given a good chance to win
the 100, and Clark should take the
220. Barber of California should press
both of them hard in these races.
Miller's cold lessens Stanford's
chances in the 440* to take first, but
Templeton may enter Richardson in
this event if there are not too many
heats in the 880. If Miller is well, he
should win. Richardson, if entered, has
a good chance to lead the field.
Richardson May Win
The half-mile will be a great race,
and should end in a victory for Bill
Richardson. "Soapy" Watters of Har
vard, who beat Richardson in the race
two years ago, will again make a
strong bid for first, but Richardson's
time has been the better this year,
and unless he is boxed, should come
out ahead.
Neither Stanford nor U.S.C. have
entries in the mile and two-mile. It is
here that Eastern teams should run
up a number of points.
The hurdles are U.S.C.'s strong
races, and it is in these that upsets
are likely to occur. Giving Dye a first
and Reynolds a third, U.S.C. gathers
8 points. This might be raised to 9 if
Reynolds takes a second, which is
doubtful. West for Stanford should
make a point.
In the low hurdles it is the same
situation. Grumbles, defending cham
pion, should again lead the field with
Dye taking fourth, West of Stanford
again being good for one point.
King should win the high jump, but
any additional points will depend upon
the condition of Work's jumping leg.
Work may surprise and place, but this
cannot be counted upon. Between Ross
and Coggeshall the Trojans should
take five points.
In the broad jump Norton is defend
ing champion, but may be displaced,
as many have outdistanced him this
year. Conceding Bondsliu and Norton
the first places Stanford should still
add five points to her total between
the work of Meeks and Mc√üae.
Houser Puts Shot
The Trojans come to the front again
in the weight events. Bud Houser
should take five points in both shot
and discus, and is likely in so doing
to break the records as well. The East
being low on good weight men should
lose out in these events, Stanford tak
ing four points in each event by Biff
Hoffman, and Gerkin of California,
coming in for some points.
Lee Barnes, in winning the pole
vault for U.S.C., also has a good chance
to break the record, having in the
recent P.C.C. meet broken all Ameri
can records with great ease. Ross of
Stanford is expected to take a fourth
here, as he has shown great ability as
a competitive athlete.
Harlow of Stanford should win the
javelin, with Gibson of Princeton tak
ing second. Giving a third to Shipkey,
Stanford would gain eight points,
bringing the total to 40 against 39 of
U.S.C.
