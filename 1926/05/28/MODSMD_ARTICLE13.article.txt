# FRESHMEN CONCEDED VICTORY IN WOMEN'S SWIMMING CONTEST
## 
### 
Freshman women swimmers are fa
vored to win the annual interclass
title at the Field Day meet today, from
the sophomores, who have the second
strongest team.
The 75-yard free style should be the
best race of the day, and should be
negotiated in time breaking the rec
ord set by Clarita Hunsberger Mon
day. Hunsberger, '27, Sallie Miller, '29,
Rosalie Walters, '29, and Madeline
Frick, '28, all have a chance of com
ing in first, but they will probably be
timed Hunsberger, Miller, Frick, Wal
ters.
Jean Armes, freshman captain, and
Miller and Hunsberger have all made
16 flat in the 25-yard free style, with
Wakefield, '28, close behind with 16
and a fraction. The race should be be
tween these four, though there is a
possibility that Adelaide Kelly, '26,
will break into the scoring column.
She was last year's winner in the
event and may, under competition,
come through with good time.
Plunging will be run off as the first
event, giving Madeline Frick, sopho
more captain, a better chance of
breaking the record, which has stood
since 1920. Helen Huneke, '28, should
take an easy second, with the possi
bility of winning the event from her
teammate. Burlingame and Hopper,
both seniors, will fight it out for third
place.
Barbara Frick, '29, has made the
best time in the backstroke, and has
broken the existing record consistently
in practice. Being pushed by Storey,
'28, Frick stands the best chance of
breaking the record made last year by
Margery Blackwelder. Storey, who has
had little practice, has been constantly
improving and has been coming close
to Frick's times in this event.
The 50-yard free style will be a bat
tle between Miller and M. Frick. Mil
ler will probably win, and may do so
with record-breaking time. Walters,
'29, Rittler, *28, Feusier, '26, and Kelly,
'26. will fight for the other places.
In the breaststroke the seniors
should score at least five points and
possibly more. Lois Hopper and Na
dine Stewart, seniors, and Jean Wake
field, sophomore, have all made prac
tically the same time.
Hunsberger, junior captain and
Olympics diver, is coneedod a first
place in the diving. The seniors should
take five points with Hopper and
Swayze. Rittler and van Loben Sels
should compete for the final point.

the sophomores, who have the second
strongest team.
The 75-yard free style should be the
best race of the day, and should be
negotiated in time breaking the rec
ord set by Clarita Hunsberger Mon
day. Hunsberger, '27, Sallie Miller, '29,
Rosalie Walters, '29, and Madeline
Frick, '28, all have a chance of com
ing in first, but they will probably be
timed Hunsberger, Miller, Frick, Wal
ters.
Jean Armes, freshman captain, and
Miller and Hunsberger have all made
16 flat in the 25-yard free style, with
Wakefield, '28, close behind with 16
and a fraction. The race should be be
tween these four, though there is a
possibility that Adelaide Kelly, '26,
will break into the scoring column.
She was last year's winner in the
event and may, under competition,
come through with good time.
Plunging will be run off as the first
event, giving Madeline Frick, sopho
more captain, a better chance of
breaking the record, which has stood
since 1920. Helen Huneke, '28, should
take an easy second, with the possi
bility of winning the event from her
teammate. Burlingame and Hopper,
both seniors, will fight it out for third
place.
Barbara Frick, '29, has made the
best time in the backstroke, and has
broken the existing record consistently
in practice. Being pushed by Storey,
'28, Frick stands the best chance of
breaking the record made last year by
Margery Blackwelder. Storey, who has
had little practice, has been constantly
improving and has been coming close
to Frick's times in this event.
The 50-yard free style will be a bat
tle between Miller and M. Frick. Mil
ler will probably win, and may do so
with record-breaking time. Walters,
'29, Rittler, *28, Feusier, '26, and Kelly,
'26. will fight for the other places.
In the breaststroke the seniors
should score at least five points and
possibly more. Lois Hopper and Na
dine Stewart, seniors, and Jean Wake
field, sophomore, have all made prac
tically the same time.
Hunsberger, junior captain and
Olympics diver, is coneedod a first
place in the diving. The seniors should
take five points with Hopper and
Swayze. Rittler and van Loben Sels
should compete for the final point.
Freshman women swimmers are fa
vored to win the annual interclass
title at the Field Day meet today, from
the sophomores, who have the second
