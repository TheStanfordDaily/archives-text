# BRITISH COAL STRIKE NEWSPAPERS SHOWN BY HOOVER LIBRARY
## 
### 
Newspapers printed in London dur
ing the recent strike form the exhibit
which the Hoover War Library placed
in one of its show-cases yesterday.
The papers were loaned to the library
by Sydney Herbert, professor at the
University of Wales, who is doing re
search work on the campus, and who
spoke on the British coal strike in the
Little Theatre Tuesday evening. A
copy of the Spectator was added to
the exhibit by Professor Ephraim D.
Adams of the History department.
Two copies of the British Worker,
dated May 6 and 7, are in the collec
tion. This paper was the official organ
of the General Council of the Trades
Union Congress, and contains strike
news only.
The London Express issued a strike
bulletin on May 11 containing not only
strike news, but brief dispatches on
occurrences abroad. One notice it con
tains is as follows: "One curious ef
fect of the strike has been a falling
off in the marriage rate. May is al
ways a bad month for marriages, but
Registrars throughout London have
been having fewer couples before them
than in any previous May of recent
years."
The government put out a regular
sized, seven-column newspaper, the
British Gazette, published by His
Majesty's Stationery Office, composed
mostly of government accounts on
the strike, but also containing some
short foreign news items. The main
story of the issue is "The Truth About
the Coal Negotiations," by Sir Doug
las McGarel Hogg, Attorney-General
of the kingdom.
Rudyard Kipling contributed to this
issue a short poem entitled "Protect
Us Yet Again."
