classes.

towards the Field Day championship.

competition receives five points, sec
ond place getting three, third place
two, and fourth place one. Dope points
to a close score because no class has a
decided advantage over the other in
more than one sport.

ly at 2 o'clock. The track competition
should be keen between all four
classes because the seniors, though
lacking in numbers, will be able to
gather many points through Lois Hop
per and Doris Kildale. Their ability
will somewhat counterbalance the
number of entries of the other three
classes.
At 3 o'clock the apparatus contest
for underclassmen will be held in
Roble gymnasium. This year no class
competitive drill will be included, but
W.A.A. points will be given to the

Rittler for the title, Jean Ward play
ing Lois Hallman at the same time
for the class standing.

the swimming meet, will start at 4
o'clock in the Roble pool. This should
be a three-cornered race between the
seniors, sophomores, and freshmen, a 9
the juniors have not a strong team.

most first-place winners will probably
take the meet.
Barbecue Follows
