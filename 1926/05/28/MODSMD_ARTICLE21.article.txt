# The
						Pink
## 
### 
The year rolls around and once again the meek inherit the Daily Palo
Alto office. Once annually it is the pleasure of the women of the staff to
usurp the work and titles of our brother journalists, and to produce in a
rosy film of efficiency, the Women's Edition.
Gone are the smoke-clouds from many pipes, the thumping hunt and
hit of the masculine typist as he painstakingly pounds out a story, the
shuffling of heavy feet going to and fro. Substituted are fresh breezes
from the open windows, the measured tap-tap of adroit-fingered typists,
an all-pervading peace. What wonder that from such an atmosphere
comes the very "Pink of Perfection."
But there is a deeper purpose to the Women's Edition than to voice
the long-suppressed ideas of the women or to show their journalistic
capabilities. To give full recognition to a day set apart for women's
athletic activities and, by bringing these events into prominence, to arouse
interest and enthusiasm in them is the real underlying motive of the women
in putting out the paper today.
We wish to take this opportunity of publicly thanking the masculine
members of the staff who made this issue possible by their co-operative
spirit of non-interference and non-appearance. Furthermore, we extend
our assurances that if ever there comes a time when they undertake a task
so stupendous, our co-operation will not be lacking.
