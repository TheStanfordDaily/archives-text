# Speaking of Endowments

As the women of the University gather in preparation for Field Day,
the old question again arises: Why should not the women's physical train
ing department be put on a par with that of the men? That the women
of Stanford University should be compelled to use gymnasium buildings
and equipment of last century is almost too much for human understand
ing.
This is the only remaining university on the Pacific Coast that is not
possessed of a modern gymnasium for women. That almost three-fourths
of the women students are enrolled for athletic work is ample testimony
of the need for greater facilities.
Surely the women are entitled to the next benevolence in the way of
endowments that finds its way through the gates of the University.
