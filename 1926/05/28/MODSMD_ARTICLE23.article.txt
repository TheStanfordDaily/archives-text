# Back Seats
## 
### 
Every year has witnessed the passing of many Stanford traditions.
Apparently many more are doomed to die: Sophomoric pranks are ever
on the wane; the "rough" is becoming more refined; senior sombreros
appear about as frequently as "dinks"; the wood peckers are casting
covetous eyes on the less and less used "Toonerville."
The tendency in this direction has been wholly constructive, however.
It has been an abandonment of the useless in most cases. In view of this
fact, therefore, it fills our editorial heart with joy to witness the diminish
ing number of women who meekly take seats in the gallery at assemblies.
May this absurd practice pass with other outlived traditions.
