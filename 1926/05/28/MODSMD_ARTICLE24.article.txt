A little sympathy for the faculty as expressed by The Cal. Tech :
"About this time of year a most curious malady begins to creep over our
campus, characterized by a good-natured indifference to classwork. Perhaps
even the faculty members are beginning to tire in their efforts to foist
knowledge upon an unwilling student body."
Startling discovery made by The Daily Cardinal of the University of
Wisconsin:
"Co-education has its place in modern university life. The time-honored
fiction about sex inferiority of women is unadulterated piffle."
Unique pre-final traffic regulation made at the University of Cali
fornia:
"Anyone not attending the university must pay $6 for use of- the library."
