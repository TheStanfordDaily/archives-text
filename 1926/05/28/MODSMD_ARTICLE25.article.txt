Tryoutees' Prayer: Dear God —Please let me take lotsa pictures, lotsa
ads, lotsa time, and grow up and be a big editor. Let me sit with my feet
on the desk and go up to the city for an engagement with the engraver, and
see all the plays in town.

If co-eds from Stanford are banished
And the queens from the Row disappear,
While Madrono is deserted and silent,
# And Roble is minus its cheer.
Then the men will grow dirty and careless,
"Pop" Harris will go out of biz;
And Stickey's will have to go bankrupt
For the lack of a call for their fizz.
Cigar store will do a fine business,
Hut Myers will move out with his tubs,
For those who would not save from the makin's,
A haircut, shave, or rub.
The Dean will have various troubles
To shelter mere man from all harm,
And classes will run every Sunday,
To keep men down on the Farm.
But the Co-eds will never be banishod
Till the Quad is pushed into the bay,
Or another Stanford is founded,
Or finally mere man has his way. PWB, '18.
