# SOPHOMORES FAVORED TO WIN INTERCLASS TRACK MEET TODAY
## Senior Captain May Break Record in Basketball Throw, Shotput 
### 
By their strength on the dashes, and
their large number of possible second
and third-place winners, the sopho
. mores should win the interclass track
| meet this afternoon, with the fresh
; men taking second. Though other
classes have a few stars, the size of
the 1928 squad and the number of
point-winners among them will pile up
a large score for the sophomores.
In the 50-yard dash the race should
be between Dewlaney, *27, and For
dyce, '28, with Gunsolus, '29, also liable
to break the tape. From times made
this season, Fordyce should win, but
in the dual meets held the last two
weeks she did not meet Dewlaney,
who should give a good account of
herself,
Dewlaney should turn the tables in
the 75-yard dash and beat Fordyce,
though the race will be between these
two with Lansburgh, freshman cap
tain, as the third contender.
The hurdle race will be between
Lansburgh, '29, Hamilton, '28, and
Hopper, '26. From records made this
season, Hamilton should win. If Hop
per did not have a bad knee, she would
be the probable winner.
Freshmen Jump
The broad jump will bring points
to the freshmen as Lansburgh is con
ceded a first in this event. Her jump
of 14 feet 1 inch last week has not
been closely approached this year.
Gunsolus, '29, Cone, '28, Kildale, '26,
and Deal, '28, should fight it out for
the other places.
In the high jump Bakewell, '28, and
Applegate, '27, have proved them
selves the best performers, and in a
claaß by themselves. Though Apple
gate did not clear 4 feet in the meet
last week she has cleared it in prac
tice consistently. This was the mark
that Bakewell made in the sophomore
senior meet.
Lois Hopper, senior captain, will
take ten points for her team in the
field. In the shot and basketball throw
she has regularly gone boyond all
other marks. She made her new rec
ord in the basketball throw this week,
and may possibly break her own rec
ord this afternoon. Shoup, '29, is her
nearest competitor in the basketball
throw, and Lease, '28, and Huntington,
'28, Bhould take five points between
them for the sophomores, in the shot
put.
Baseball throw will be a duel be
tween Shoup, '29, and Watson, '28, the
edge being given to the former. Nei
ther have come near breaking Koeck's
record in the event, though they may
posßibly do so this afternoon.
Four places will be counted in each
event carrying a value of five, three,
two, and one points. The sophomores'
ability to take seconds and thirds as
well as their share of firsts, should
give them the meet.
