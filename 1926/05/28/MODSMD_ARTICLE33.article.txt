# Art Department Exhibits Work in House Designing
## 
### 
The Art department is holding an
exhibit of all the work done in the
department during the year.
An interesting feature of the exhibit
is work shown from the course in Art
of Houso Design. The purpose of the
course is to develop appreciation of
beauty and good taste. A picture of a
commonplace house is given to the
student to re-design. Matters of city
planning are also stressed, and the
student is shown how private homes
and cheap real estate projects done
on a large scale can combine beauty,
utility, and good taste.
