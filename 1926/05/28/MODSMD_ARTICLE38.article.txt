# DR. JORDAN DEFINES EARTHQUAKE CAUSES, DISTURBANCE AREAS
## 
### 
"In the California earthquakes there
are 110 explosions, no bursting of
'caves of gloom,' no escape of sul
phurous or other gases and none of
the phenomena which excite the imagi
nation of the superstitions of the ig
norant or credulous," said Dr. Jordan
last night in discussing the California
earthquake of 1906. "They are not
caused by electricity; neither is. there
any reason to suppose that any plane
tary conditions produce them, nor is
there evidence of their connection
with climatic conditions."
According to Dr. Jordan there are
two sets of disturbances which shake
the crust of the earth and therefore
go by the name of earthquakes. Erup
tive earthquakes are explosions, usu
ally of Bteam, about a volcano. Teu
tonic earthquakes, the most felt with
in the United States, are breaks in the
overloaded or overstrained crust of
tlie earth, and for the most part have
nothing to do with volcanoes.
"Since the earthquake of 190G many
small earthquake waves have followed,
evidently harmless details in the pro
cess of adjustment. The coast, for
some reason connected with the secular
changes in continents and seas, is in
California and along the whole run
of the Pacific slowly rising. Perhaps
some part of the Pacific Ocean is
slowly sinking, as part of this same
movement. In any event, the rise of
this heavily-loaded and much-broken
area is accompanied by a heavy strain."
