# WINNER OF WOMEN'S TENNIS TITLE TO BE DETERMINED TODAY
## 
### 
Margaret Owen, '29, and Lida Rittler,
'28, meet for the University women's
tennis title at 3 o'clock this afternoon
on the Roble tennis courts.
Both women have won their way to
the finals by decisive victories over
Lois Hallman, '27, and Jean Ward, '26,
class championfi. Rittler won her
matches with greater ease than Owen,
though neither one was hard pressed.
Rittler's steadiness has featured her
play all season. This, coupled with the
tournament experience sho gathered
last year, gives her an advantage over
Owen. Owen, though, has shown her
self a good fighter, and able to come
from behind to win. Unless she is ner
vous she stands an excellent chance
of winning.
At the same time Jean Ward will
play Lois Hallman for the third posi
tion in the class standings. Their
match should be quite even, though
Hallman will probably win, as Ward
has not been up to good form this
year. Ward's three years of experience
may be an aid to her, however.
