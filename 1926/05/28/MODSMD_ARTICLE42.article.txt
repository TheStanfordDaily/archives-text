# WOMEN ATHLETES USE EQUIPMENT OF 1894 STANFORD LACKS ADEQUATE GYMNASIUM BUILDINGS WOODPECKERS THREATEN PRESENT STRUCTURE
## 
### Hallie Keating 
At the end of the street car tracks,
stand a group of wooden buildings,
dignified by time and hard use and
known as the Ruble gymnasiums.
Since the registration in the physical
education department averages over
330 each quarter, these buildings and
their equipment are interesting from
more than a historical point of view.
The oldest building, which is used
as the gymnasium proper, was built in
1894, and is one of the few remaining
wooden structures still in use on the
campus. It was situated at first on the
road toward the Roble bridge, but with
the change of Sequoia hall, to a men's
dormitory, the gymnasium was moved
to its present location. At the time
of its erection, it was provided with
athletic equipment of the latest mod
els. This equipment is still being used.
The swimming pool was built in
1917, and opened about the same time
as the new Roble hall. About the pool
was erected a temporary building with
a few showers, a laundry, and some
dressing booths to serve until a more
adequate structure could be put up.
This building also remains in use.
Improvements Needed
Since nearly three-fourths of the
women of the University are enrolled
in classes here, the equipment is ut
terly inadequate, according to Helen
M. Punting, physical director. While
the problem of shortage of dressing
rooms is partially solved, by allowing
women going in costume from their
living groups directly, this is undesir
able for the best result of the work
and the health of the women.
The gymnasium itself is used most
of the time for dancing classes. In

rainy weather this presents a difficult
problem for classes such as basketball,
hockey, and archery as well as for
the formal gymnasium classes.
While the outdoor athletic fields are
in good condition, there is need for
their further development and im
provement.
Stanford Behind
"Stanford is the only university on
the coast that will not have a modem
up-to-date gymnasium for women, at
the end of this year," declared Miss
Bunting. "New buildings are in con
struction at California; plans for such
equipment have recently been finished
at Washington; and both Oregon and
Mills already possess them.
"The chief need of our physical edu
cation department is for new buildings
and money with which to develop the
athletic fields. The present offices are
cramped, and it is impossible to deal
with the theoretical side of the wo
men's sports, that is the most essen
tial.
"Besides needing it for college ac
tivities," says Miss Bunting, "there is
an imperative need to house a major
department in physical education.
There is a constant demand for this
sort of training, and because we have
not the equipment here, I have been
forced time and again to advise per
sons wanting this to go elsewhere,"
continued Miss Bunting.
The policy of the department has
been to encourage mass activity
rather than specialization of a few
athletes. Work has been on a class
basis rather than varsity. This requires
a more extensive equipment but is
better for the individual student.
