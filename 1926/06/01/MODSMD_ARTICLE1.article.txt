## Far Western Athletes Show Greatest Strength in Field Contests KING SETS JUMP RECORD Trojan Track, Field Stars Pile Up 35½ Points to Bring Back Title 
### 
Scoring second place in the Fiftieth
I.C.A.A.A.A. track and field meet held i
at Cambridge last Friday and Satur
day, the Cardinal twelve-man team,
closed the 1926 season, bowing to the
Trojans who retained their title by
scoring 35%-points to Stanford's 25%.
Yale, titleholders of 1924, placed third
with 25 1-3 points, followed by Har- j
vard, 20 points, Syracuse, 17 points, j
and California, the third western out-1
fit, with 16 points.
Bob King, sensational sophomore
high-jumper, was the outstanding!
Cardinal man, setting a new 1.C.4-A
record with a leap of 6 feet 5% inches.
Chuck Harlow, javelin thrower, was
the second Stanford man to win in
the 1926 intercollegiate meet, tossing
the spear a distance of 195 feet 31
inches. Other Cardinal point-winners |
were West in both hurdles, Hoffman in
the weights, Work, high jump, and!
Richardson in the half-mile.
Upsets Occur
Several upsets marked the events. J
which emphasized again the supre-l
macy of the West through strength in ;
the field events. With defeats in the
broad jump and middle distances,
Stanford's hopes of attaining the na
tional championship were shattered.
Meeks and Mcßae, star broad-jump
ers, Richardson, Pacific Coast 880 rec- j
ord-holder, and Miller, coast 440 title
holder. scoring but a single point in
the events where U.S.C.'s greatest com
petitor was considered the strongest.
Barnes Fails
Lee Barnes, Olympic champion and
holder of the American pole vault rec
ord, surprised the Trojans by failing
to vault higher than 12 feet 6 inches
and second place, while Barber, Bond
shu, and Hill, California, were unable
to break into the scoring. Norton,
Yale's 1925 I.C.A.A.A.A. broad jump
champion, also failed to qualify in
this event.
Stanford was somewhat compen
sated for her upsets by the showing
of Clarence West, who turned in his
fastest time of competition in both
hurdle events. Pushing Leighton Dye,
1925 champion, to a time of 14.7 sec
onds in the high hurdles, and taking
fourth place to Kenneth Grumbles,
who repeated his victory of 1925, West
proved to be the Cards' highest point
scorer. Grumbles' time of 23 4-16, sec
onds in the latter event broke a rec
ord of twenty-eight years' standing.
The Stanford star tied for first in his
qualifying heat with a time of 24 sec
onds flat.
Hoffman Scores
Hoffman gave the Cardinals five
points by places in the discus and
shot.
Tom Work's leap of 6 feet 3%
inches in the high jump, tying for sec
ond with Coggeshall of U.S.C., proved
another Stanford surprise.. Bill Rich
ardson was the other Stanford point
scorer, placing fifth in the half.
Miller, who was handicapped by a
severe cold, was unable to place in
the quarter, although he won his pre
liminary heat the previous day. Meeks
and Mcßae, broad -junipers, Ross,
pole vaulter, Babcock, quarter-miler,
and Shipkey, javelin, were unable to
qualify for the finals. The meet as a
whole did not fulfill Stanford expecta
tions, for times made by the Cardinals
in winning the Pacific Coast meet
from U.S.C. had promised a stronger
Stanford showing. The effect of the
trip, however, and unexpected upsets,
proved too much for Coach Temple
ton's men.
