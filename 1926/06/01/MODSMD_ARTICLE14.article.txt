# New Quad Ready For Distribution Next Monday
## 
### 
Quad Volume 33 will be distributed
next Monday, Basil McGann, editor,
stated last night. The book will come
off the press Friday and will be al
lowed to remain in the bindery over
the week-end i in order to insure per
fect dryness of ink and binding.
The University of California found
it necessary to distribute the Blue and
Gold the day it came out of the bind
ery, and as a consequence it went into
the hands of the students damp and
unready for the hard usage to which
it is immediately subjected. No incon
venience will be caused by holding the
distribution of the Quad over the week
end, and McGann plans that the annual
shall go over the counter in perfect
shape.
