# STANFORD RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES CRITICIZED
## 
### 
A pessimistic view of the progress
of religious work at Stanford Univer
sity was expressed by Dr. M. Willard
Lampe in a report made to the Presby
terial general assembly at Baltimore
yesterday. Dr. Lampe's report de
scribed the efforts of the Presbyterian
Church to combat hostility, paganism
and indifference in American college
communities.
The following comment was made
on Stanford: "The University Me
morial Church dominates the campus
architecture, but spiritually it is like
the altar on Mar's Hill, 'To an Un
known God.' The great majority of the
students are either indifferent or skep
tical in their attitude toward religion."
