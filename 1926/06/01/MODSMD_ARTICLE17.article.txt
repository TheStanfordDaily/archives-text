# LANZ TO TALK ON LIFE TODAY AMONG SOVIETS
## Theatre Is Only Branch of Russian Art in Pace With Revolution TO DISCUSS EDUCATION Will Also Consider Attitude Of Government Toward United States 
### 
That the theatre is the only branch
I of Russian art keeping pace with the
| revolution is the opinion of Dr. Henry
I Lanz, instructor of Slavic languages,
i who will speak on "Impressions of
; Russia" in the Little Theatre at 7:30
| o'clock tonight.
| Lanz will discuss the economic and
i social situation in Russia as well as
Russia's attitude toward America. His
lecture will also include consideration
fo several educational phases includ
ing the development of new scientific
I institutions and research institutes.
"The theatre is dependent on the
j revolution and is an expression of the
| whole change of life and attitude tak
! ing place in Russia. Classical music
j is being composed entirely indepen
dent of any revolutionary influences.
| There is not even a song of any im
! portance which was composed through
the influence of the revolution.
Painting Declines
"Painting is on the decline, and the
j great masters are largely outside of
Russia. Art displays, which are usually
! those exhibited by young people, are
numerous," declared Lanz.
Contrary to the general impression
that art collections in Russia were
damaged during the revolutionary
period, these collections are intact
i and in many instances have been in
' creased. Hundreds of ikons, including
i some of the twelfth and thirteenth
j centuries, were discovered after 1918.
All private art collections are now
under government care.
All sorts of amusements may be
found in Moscow, including theatres,
concerts, and American moving pic
tures, which predominate, are popular
jin Russia. In the theatres, formerly
I called the imperial theatres, new his
torical plays and talks and lectures by
! foreigners and leading Russians are
given much more extensively than
; ever before.
Newspapers Communistic
All newspapers are communistic,
and a large number are supported by
! the government. Although newspapers
j constantly criticize, they are not
; allowed to attack certain principles.
Criticism of the government is not sup
pressed in detail, but must be made
from the point of view of the domi
nating party. Decisions of the execu
tive committee of the Soviet Gbvern
ment cannot be criticized.
In speaking of student movements
Lanz remarked, "No political agitation
exists among students, who probably
1 fear loss of scholarships in case of
; such developments. A large number
of students have been granted schol
arships by the government.
' j "Russia has become more demo
cratic in outlook since the war. Many
; people are from the working class and
â–  | peasants now have a better chance
for advancement. The government
| regularly sends a large number of
; ! workmen to the universities, paying
' i their way."
