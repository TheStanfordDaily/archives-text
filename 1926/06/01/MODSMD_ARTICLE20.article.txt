# "Out of the West"
## 
### 
With the passing of the fiftieth anniversary of the first I.C.A.A.A.A. j
competition it would hardly seem amiss again to call attention to the fact j
that the meet, sometimes known as the "eastern" intercollegiates, had
again a distinctly western tinge. Five times in the last six years have coast
athletes brought home the trophy, while in the other year Stanford was a
bare three points behind the winner. After all, it's as much a western meet
as any could possibly be.
Some statistician, with an adding machine of sufficient capacity, may
total the score compiled by less than fifty athletes from California. It
suffices for most of us to glance rather casually through the summary; no
magnifying glass is necessary to learn where the western men placed. The
U.S.C., California, and the V S tanford teams came through the'hard trip
and the hard meet with flying colors; all deserve the most hearty con
gratulations.
Along the way, it is interesting to note that the west gathered but six
of its more than 75 points in the flat races. In the field, however, things
looked like a Coast conference meet. The first four places in both the;
shot and high jump fell to men from Stanford, U.S.C., and California,,
and in the latter event Bob King scaled the bar to set a new record. The
discus, too, was much the same, while western hurdlers repeated their
triumphs. But the result of the meet is now an old story.
Inasmuch as the I.C.A.A.A.A. is becoming somewhat of a carnival for;
western track men we hope that not far in the future it, or a combined I
West-East meet whatever it is called, may be held somewhere on the Coast, i
Within the past few years California universities have combined to grab
the major share of the honors, so it would seem that they had acquired
something of a hold on the I.C.A.A.A.A. competition. And the Coast
would surely support the meet to its utmost.
