## DODGE MAKES MT. WHITNEY-DEATH VALLEY TRIP AUTOMOBILE MEETS EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE COVERS NEARLY THOUSAND MILES IN JOURNEY 
### 
In an adventurous and certainly one
of the most unusual motor tours in
automobile history, a Dodge Brothers
touring car recently completed a trek
that led from the precipitous, snow
laden slopes near Mount Whitney, the
highest mountain in Continental Uni
ted States, to the heat-tortured floor
of Death Valley, lowest point in the
country.
According to a story received by
Walters and Blangy, local dealers, the
car made the trip with ease over a
country offering an extreme range of
temperatures.
"Swirling over nearly 1000 miles of
desert roads, the adventurous party of
motorists in their Dodge Brothers
touring car succeeded in linking these
two natural geographical extremes.
Strangely enough, both Mount Whit
ney and Death Valley are located with
in the confines of Inyo County and
are scarcely more than sixty miles
apart as the crow flies.
"Those unfamiliar with these conti
nental landmarks will undoubtedly be

interested to know that the jagged,
saw-toothed crest of Mount Whitney,
rising 14,501 feet aboye the level of
the sea, was officially seen for the first
time from Mount Brewer by members
of the Geological Survey of California
in 1864, and was named for the dis
tinguished head of that survey. Mount
Whitney, despite its formidable as
pect, has been a kindly giant and its
toll of human life has been small, due
to the lack of icy crevasses that dis
tinguish other high peaks in the coun
try.
"But not so Death Valley; this
dreadful sink, so appropriately named,
is tragically linked with the settling
of this great West. Into its fiery maw
unwittingly trod the Forty-niners, and
Death Valley took its toll. Lying di
rectly east of Mount Whitney, between
the Panamint and Funeral ranges, this
scorched depression is 284 feet below
sea level at its lowest point. One hun
dred miles long and from two to ten
miles wide, its utter desolation is truly
terrifying. And yet it is not without
fascination."
