# BALLOON TIRES LOSE ENDURANCE UNLESS CORRECTLY INFLATED

Although the motorists of the coun
' try are by this time sold on the many
advantages that the balloon tire has
; brought, they have not yet learned
; the vital importance of guarding
against underinflation, which means a
; heavy loss in mileage and an unneces
sary addition to overhead expense, ac
cording to Louis P. Signer, manager

the California State Automobile Asso
( ciation.
"Three pounds of air does not mean
much to the average car owner, but
it would mean a great deal more to
him if he were to realize that an
underinflation of three pounds in a
balloon tire calling for 27 pounds re
duces the mileage of that tire by more
than two thousand #iiiles," Signer said.
"There is little similarity in high
and low pressure tires. The balloon
I contains fewer plies of sustaining cot
! ton fabric and a greater volume of air
than the high pressure tire. There is a
smaller volume of air in the older tires
but the air is maintained at higher
! pressure.
"Having fewer plies of fabric, the
balloon tire flexes more when in con
tact with road irregularities. The side
walls vibrate rapidly, bending like a
; piece of wire in the hand. If they
bend too far, the cotton cords will
break and the plies will separate, caus
ing premature thread wear and re
duced mileage."
