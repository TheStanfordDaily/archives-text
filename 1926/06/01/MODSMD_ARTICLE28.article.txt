Examine the oil that is removed
from the crankcase. It tells the story
of the condition of your motor. Water
in the oil indicates a faulty cylinder
head gasket or a cracked cylinder
head. Small particles of metal indi
cate undue wear on bearings or other
working parts. If the oil looks at all
out of the ordinary, take a sample to
your repair man for inspection.

Overhauling of the motor means the
replacement of worn parts and a thor
ough examination for defective or
cracked parts. Do not fail to have the
crankshaft measured wit ha microme
ter, to see that it is round, as it is
useless to fit a bearing to an egg
shaped crank shaft.
* * *
Keep the connections of the acceler
ator control well oiled so that the gas
can be supplied slowly without jerk
ing the car. If oiling does not remedy
it, examine the spring and rod adjust
ments for tension and leverage.

An air-cooled motor depends upon
the volume of air circulating past
cylinders for its cooling. A long steady
climb that can just be made in high
should be made in second in order
to speed up the engine and the air
circulation.
* * *
A sudden heating of the engine in
dicates trouble, unless it is a hot day
and the car is climbing a grade. Ex
amine the fan belt, check the oil, and
see that the water is circulating
properly.
* * *
Rear springs that allow the frame
to hit the bumper when going over an
unusual chuck hole should be exam
ined. They probably need resetting to
place them in their original condition.
* * *
Wobbly wheels are often caused by
uneven tightening of rim lugs. Jack
up the car and spin the wheel. Then
loosen all lugs and tighten them
evenly,

Do not neglect your car. When a
rattle is heard, locate it. A cotter pin,
nut, or screw may save dollars, and a
quiet-running car adds to your com
fort.
