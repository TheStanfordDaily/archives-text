# INSPECT BRUSHES
## 
### 
You should examine the generator
brushes on your car at least twice a
year, according to the free emergency
road service of the California State
Automobile Association. The principle
troubles to which the brushes are sub
ject include the sticking of the brushes
in the holders, brushes fitting poorly
to the commutator, weak holder
springs, and brushes grounded by oil,
dirt, or carbon particles.
