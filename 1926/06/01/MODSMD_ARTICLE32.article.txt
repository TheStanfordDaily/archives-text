##

Many experienced motorists put cyl
inder oil into the gasoline tank when \
breaking in a new car, especially dur- j
ing the first few hundred miles, ac-1
cording to the free emergency road
service of the California State Auto
mobile Association. One quart of oil to
eighteen or twenty gallons of gasoline
is enough. This practice insures posi- j
tive lubrication of the piston rings and
valves.
