## Ruth Vredenburgh Winner Of Musical Chair Contest, Doris Fee Second 
### Lynn Brampkamp 
Highest honors in the seventh An
nual Horse Show, held Friday by the
Military Department, went to C. O.
Thompson who, by winning four events
and placing second in another, showed
his superiorial to the field of entries.
Among his victories was that in the
horsemanship event, which win gave
him the cup and prize spurs.
No falls marred the afternoon's
events and a small grass fire was the
only happening not on the program.
Thrills were furnished the spectators
by the steeplechase event when all the
entries bunched closely together
cleared the first hurdle without a fall.
The event proved an oddity, since only
three men qualified for positions by
clearing every hurdle in the course.
Davis Performs
Among the notable performances of
the day was that of Burt Davis who,
single-handed after his teammates had
lost hold of the rope, won the tug-of
war event from his four opponents.
Miss Ruth Vredenburgh won the
ladies' musical chair. Doris Fee and
Martha Blackwelder followed in order.
Miss Vredenburgh proved to be the
most agile in dismounting at the stop
ping of the music.
Only two teams ran in the Roman
race, which was the first event on the
program, and the "greys," Janette and
Scott, ridden by M. L. Broekway, won
handily as was predicted. H. B. Rus
sell, riding second, finished strong.
In the potato and spoon race, won
by Miss Jean Stewart and Cadet K. G.
Krohn, the first three teams finished
the balancing act without a mishap.
Miss Doris Fee and Cadet Paul Flagler
placed second.
Half-Mile Is Thriller
The half-mile race, won by Thomp
son, proved most interesting through
the fight for second place that de
velepode. H. B. Russell nosed out L. B.
Weymouth, after the latter's last
minute sprint failed. The remount
class resulted in another win for
Thompson, his riding ability showing
up well, though Krohn was a good sec
ond in this event.
