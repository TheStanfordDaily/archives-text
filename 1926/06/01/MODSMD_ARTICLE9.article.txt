# DAVIS ANNOUNCES LATE CHANGES IN 1926 FARCE CAST
## DAVES REPLACES WEIGLE Virginia Greene, Adelaide Kelly Trade Original Parts in Senior Play 
### 
Announcement was made today by
Gordon Davis of several last-minute
changes and substitutions in the cast
of "Meet the Wife," the senior farce,
to be presented in the Assembly hall
011 June 16, the night after finals.
Stanley Weigel, originally an
nounced in the role of Harvey Lennox,
has been unable to keep up with the
strenuous rehearsal schedule Davis
has found it necessary to maintain on
account of the combined pressure of
his duties as student body president
elect.
Delmer Daves will take over the part
left vacant by Weigel. Daves is one of
the best-known and most-capable cam
pus actors, having appeared in lead
ing roles in "R.U.R.," "Macbeth," "Ray,
Ray, Rover Boys," and several other
productions since his debut in "Cap
tain Applejack," the sophomore play
of 1923.
Virginia Greene and Adelaide Kelly
have traded the parts for which they
were originally cast in the production.
Miss Greene, who first took the part of
Doris, is now rehearsing that of Alice.
The former is new to the campus
stage, and the latter is being seen in
her first important role since "Mile
stones" in 1924. As Doris, Miss Kelly
is creating a favorable impression
with those who have watched pre
liminary rehearsals of the farce, as
she not only is admirably suited to
her role in temperament, but is also
keeping up a brisk tempo and giving a
sustained characterization even at this
early stage of practice.
George Mott, Jr., in the role of Wil
liam, is a new member of the cast. He
will begin rehearsing tonight.
