# RUSSIA IS SAFER NOW THAN BEFORE WAR, STATES LANZ
## FEWER DISTURBANCES Living Conditions Improved, Unemployment Problem Remains Serious 
### 
"Under the present regime life in
Russia seems to be safer than it was
before the war," said Dr. Henry Lanz,
instructor or Slavic languages, who
spoke on "Impressions Russia" in
the Little Theatre last ilghi. T re
cently returned from a ,tiree months'
trip in Russia. \
"In Moscow I met with ierfect order
maintained by the miniirum of police
force. Although the nuryoer of police
men in the streets is ostensibly
smaller than it used j be, there are
less public disturbances than formerly.
1 did not see a single drunken person
in the street, and the number of beg
gars is considerably smaller.
Unemployed Receive Aid
"The problem of unemployment is
.still grave, but much is being done for
those who do not work, especially in
the matter of housing conditions. Al
though Russian homes and living
houses are crowded, renters pay for
their rooms in proportion to their
salaries. The unemployed secure
rooms free of charge and may not be
expelled for failure to pay rent.
"Certain help from professional or
ganizations is also received by the
unemployed. If they present proof that
they have been engaged in some pro
ductive work for the last twenty-five
years, old people receive a small pen
sion.

"One of the first things that I found
in Russia was that there is little mys
tery and a great deal of misery, a
misery that is entirely independent of
any political issues and which would
persist under any form of government.
Russia makes an impression of a coun
try that is now recovering from a dan
gerous malady.
"The revolution and civil war caused
.a great deal of destruction and still
more deterioration. Everybody who is
engaged in the work of reconstruction,
be it the government, big corporations,
professional organizations, or private
individuals, is facing enormous diffi
culties. Lack of money seems to be a
great hindrance."
Russia is financially isolated from
the rest of the world. Depreciation of
currency which is prevalent at present
results in a higher cost of living. Al
though other countries have interna
tional credit which greatly alleviates
the situation, Russia has none. Since
the greatest economy is necessary to
run the country, the government is
trying to reduce its expenses to re
duce the staff of the employes result
ing in a great deal of unemployment.

In speaking of universities and re
search institutions, Lanz said, "A large
number of research institutes were
lately established in Russia, not mere
ly in Moscow, but all over the country.
Competent people, largely former pro
fessors and academicians, are in
charge of those institutes. Research
work is being done along many lines,
and I was surprized to see the num
ber of publications in all departments
of science, all published by the govern
ment.
"A highly interesting movement is
taking place in Russian philology, a
movement combining philological re
search with a real philosophical in
terest. Much highly interesting work
has been done lately along the lines
of formal analysis of prose and verse.
Metrical studies, the studies of rhythm
in prose and verse, the principles and
laws of poetic composition attract the
interest of a number of unusually
gifted scholars," declared Lanz.

of formal analysis of prose and verse.
Metrical studies, the studies of rhythm
in prose and verse, the principles and
laws of poetic composition attract the
interest of a number of unusually
gifted scholars," declared Lanz.
"Under the present regime life in
Russia seems to be safer than it was
before the war," said Dr. Henry Lanz,
instructor or Slavic languages, who
spoke on "Impressions Russia" in
the Little Theatre last ilghi. T re
cently returned from a ,tiree months'
trip in Russia. \
"In Moscow I met with ierfect order
maintained by the miniirum of police
force. Although the nuryoer of police
men in the streets is ostensibly
smaller than it used j be, there are
less public disturbances than formerly.
1 did not see a single drunken person
in the street, and the number of beg
gars is considerably smaller.
Unemployed Receive Aid
"The problem of unemployment is
.still grave, but much is being done for
those who do not work, especially in
the matter of housing conditions. Al
though Russian homes and living
houses are crowded, renters pay for
their rooms in proportion to their
salaries. The unemployed secure
rooms free of charge and may not be
expelled for failure to pay rent.
"Certain help from professional or
ganizations is also received by the
unemployed. If they present proof that
they have been engaged in some pro
ductive work for the last twenty-five
years, old people receive a small pen
sion.

"One of the first things that I found
in Russia was that there is little mys
tery and a great deal of misery, a
misery that is entirely independent of
any political issues and which would
persist under any form of government.
Russia makes an impression of a coun
try that is now recovering from a dan
gerous malady.
"The revolution and civil war caused
.a great deal of destruction and still
more deterioration. Everybody who is
engaged in the work of reconstruction,
be it the government, big corporations,
professional organizations, or private
individuals, is facing enormous diffi
culties. Lack of money seems to be a
great hindrance."
Russia is financially isolated from
the rest of the world. Depreciation of
currency which is prevalent at present
results in a higher cost of living. Al
though other countries have interna
tional credit which greatly alleviates
the situation, Russia has none. Since
the greatest economy is necessary to
run the country, the government is
trying to reduce its expenses to re
duce the staff of the employes result
ing in a great deal of unemployment.

In speaking of universities and re
search institutions, Lanz said, "A large
number of research institutes were
lately established in Russia, not mere
ly in Moscow, but all over the country.
Competent people, largely former pro
fessors and academicians, are in
charge of those institutes. Research
work is being done along many lines,
and I was surprized to see the num
ber of publications in all departments
of science, all published by the govern
ment.
"A highly interesting movement is
taking place in Russian philology, a
movement combining philological re
search with a real philosophical in
terest. Much highly interesting work
has been done lately along the lines
of formal analysis of prose and verse.
