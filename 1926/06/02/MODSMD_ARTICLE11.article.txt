# STANFORD RETAINS POWER FOR 1927 I.C.A.A.A.A. MEET
## U.S.C. Loses Heavy Scorers; Barber Only Loss of California Team 
### 
Despite graduation losses breaking
up the great 1926 track combinations
of California, U.S.C., and Stanford, the
three Western universities who scored
more than one-third of the total
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet points last week
should again be the strong contenders
for the 1927 title. Performances of
such men as Hoffman, Gerkin, King,
Barnes, Reynolds, Boyden, and many
others of equal ability should again
bring the California men to the fore
when pitted against the country's best,
offsetting the losses of such stars of
today as Houser, Grumbles, Dye, Mil
ler, Richardson, Harlow, and Barber.

Stanford, although losing heavily
from the combination which gave her
her strength in dual and Pacific Coast
meets, will again have point-winners
who turned in 19% of the Cardinal's
25% 1.C.4-A points. Bob King, whose
leap of 6 feet 5 3-4 inches broke the
1.C.4-A record in the high jump, will
have two more years of competition,
while Tom Work, who tied for second
place in the same event, will also boost
Stanford's strength in the jump.
Card Stars Remain
Cliff Hoffman, winner of five points
in the weight events, will have another
year of competition, as will also Clar
ance West, Stanford's high-point man
with six counters in the two hurdle
events. West surprised by proving to
be one of the foremost threats to
Grumbles and Dye of U.S.C., and next
year should lead the Cardinal trio,
West, Nichols, and Spencer, well to the
fore in the low and high sticks. Ship
key in the javelin, Ross in the pole
i vault, Meeks in the broad jump, and
Baboock in the quarter, all members
' of this year's team, will return, bol
j stered by Hulsman and Edmonds,
; vaulters, Forster, Fleishhacker, and
Tandy, weight men, Sparling, javelin
thrower, Dales, quarter-miler, McKin
non, half-miler, Nelson, hurdler, and
Syer, sprinter, from the freshman
! ranks.
Bill Richardson, for three years the
i Cardinal's mainstay in the 880, Har
low, veteran javelin man, Mc√üae,
| broad-jumper, Ted Miller and Bill
i Storie, quarters, and Bill Kerr, dis
| tance runner, will be lost to Stanford
I by graduation. These six men counted
for thirty-six points in the California
meet this year, and have been the nu
cleus for Stanford's bid for national
honors. Pacific Coast records in the
; half, the 440, and the relay are likely
j to bear witness to the efforts of Miller,
Richardson, and Storie for some years
j to come. Louis Gaspar and Coverly,
j sprinters, and Muhs, high-jumper, have
also ended their Stanford competition.
; Evans, whose intramural record made
the same day of the 1.C.4-A meet
would have netted four points and
; second place in that meet, Hyland and
j Adams, sprinters, and Ranney and
Criley will be on hand again.
Trojans Lose Stars
j The twice-champion Trojan team

will lose heavily, since Houser, Grum
bles, and Dye, first-place winners for
two years, are closing their competi
tive careers for U.S.C. Cook, fourth
place in the javelin, will also be lost.
Such men as Barnes, Coggeshall, Rey
nolds, Aleksi, all placing in the 192G
championship meet, will again be on
hand, enabling the Trojans to loom as
the biggest threat to Stanford's hopes.
Charlie Borah, sensational freshman
speedster. House and Smith, sprinters,
Helman, distance runner, Stever, hur
dler, and stars from the 1929 team will
also represent U.S.C.
California's only loss, one which
will be keenly felt, is Phil Barber.
Gerkin, Hampton, Schwobeda, Boyden,
Talbot, Stevens, Foi, Hill, Sterling,
Ragan, Enos, and Johnson, all figur
ing in the 1926 Big Meet, will attempt
to avenge the three straight defeats
handed the Golden Bear by the Cardi
nal. With such a balanced outfit, the
Bruins promise to make a big bid
for the coast dual championship, al
though lack of outstanding stars will
detract from I.C.A.A.A.A. and Pacific
Coast Meet possibilities.
