# STANFORD RETAINS POWER FOR 1927 I.C.A.A.A.A. MEET
## U.S.C. Loses Heavy Scorers; Barber Only Loss of California Team 
### 
Despite graduation losses breaking
up the great 1926 track combinations
of California, U.S.C., and Stanford, the
three Western universities who scored
more than one-third of the total
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet points last week
should again be the strong contenders
for the 1927 title. Performances of
such men as Hoffman, Gerkin, King,
Barnes, Reynolds, Boyden, and many
others of equal ability should again
bring the California men to the fore
when pitted against the country's best,
offsetting the losses of such stars of
today as Houser, Grumbles, Dye, Mil
ler, Richardson, Harlow, and Barber.

Stanford, although losing heavily
from the combination which gave her
her strength in dual and Pacific Coast
meets, will again have point-winners
who turned in 19% of the Cardinal's
25% 1.C.4-A points. Bob King, whose
leap of 6 feet 5 3-4 inches broke the
1.C.4-A record in the high jump, will
have two more years of competition,
while Tom Work, who tied for second
place in the same event, will also boost
Stanford's strength in the jump.
Card Stars Remain
Cliff Hoffman, winner of five points
in the weight events, will have another
year of competition, as will also Clar
ance West, Stanford's high-point man
with six counters in the two hurdle
events. West surprised by proving to
be one of the foremost threats to
Grumbles and Dye of U.S.C., and next
year should lead the Cardinal trio,
West, Nichols, and Spencer, well to the
fore in the low and high sticks. Ship
