# HOUSER'S RECORDS ALL SET WITH SAME ANCIENT "PLATTER"
## 
### 
Enclosed within the suitcase con
taining the track outfit of Bud Houser,
world's champion discus thrower, re
turning from Cambridge where his
team won the I.C.A.A.A.A. champion
ship for the second consecutive year,
is Houser's most-valued possessionâ€”
a battered discus. Worthless to any
but the great Trojan weight-thrower,
it is Houser's amulet, for with this he
has established all his records in the
discus. He will use no other, and his
pet weight has "weighed in" correctlv
on a variety of scales.

Among the records set by the U.S.C.
leader with his pet platter are the
following: world's mark of 158 feet
1 3-4 inches, made at Palo Alto April
2, 192G; National A.A.U. record of 156
feet 6 inches made at San Francisco,
July 4, 1925; Olympic mark of 151 feet
6 1-6 inches, made at Paris, 1924;
I.C.A.A.A.A. record of 153 feet, made
at Cambridge May 29, 1926; world's
record for seven-foot circle of 147 feet
8V 2 inches; Drake Relay record of 147
feet 7 inches made at Ues Moines,
April 17, 1926.
