# FACULTY BULLETINS SHOW INCREASE OF HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS
## 
### 
The most recent issue of the Faculty
Bulletin, issued by the Registrar's of
fice for the information of the faculty,
contains some interesting figures
showing the increase in the number
of high school students in the state
during the last quarter of a century
and the increase in enrollment at Stan
ford since 1919-20.

In 1900 there were 124 high schools
registering 13,081 jupils; in 1925-26
the number of high schools was 413
and the estimated number of pupils
212,941. In addition there were in this
last year probably 20.15G ninth-grade
pupils in the state registered in junior
high schools, making an estimated
total of 233,097 high school pupils. In
the meantime, although the state popu
lation has grown, the ratio of high
school attendance to pupils has grown
very much more rapidly—from nine
high school pupils per 1000 population
to 49 per 1000 population.

At Stanford, in spite of the limits on
the number of men with less than
third-year standing admitted to the
University, the total registration has
increased from 2949 in 1919-20 to 4304,
the estimated total for the current
year. These totals include all who
attend the University for as much as
a single quarter during the year. The
figures by quarter show the same in
crease, from 2451 in the autumn quar
ter 1919-20, for instance, to 3138 this
year. This increase has necessarily
come about almost wholly in the junior
and senior and graduate years. The
number of graduate students, for in
stance, has grown from 283 to 553.

The Bulletin also gives figures show
ing the rapid growth in junior college
attendance. In 1922-23 the attendance
in junior colleges, including those con
nected with or supported by high
school districts, or connected with
teachers' colleges, was 1826, a number
which has grown to 5520 this year.
Five new junior colleges had been es
tablished in the meantime and four
have been organized this year since
these statistics were compiled. There
are now 27 junior colleges in the state,
not counting the four just mentioned,
21 connected with high schools and six
with teachers' colleges.

are now 27 junior colleges in the state,
not counting the four just mentioned,
21 connected with high schools and six
with teachers' colleges.
The most recent issue of the Faculty
Bulletin, issued by the Registrar's of
fice for the information of the faculty,
contains some interesting figures
showing the increase in the number
of high school students in the state
during the last quarter of a century
and the increase in enrollment at Stan
ford since 1919-20.

In 1900 there were 124 high schools
registering 13,081 jupils; in 1925-26
the number of high schools was 413
and the estimated number of pupils
212,941. In addition there were in this
last year probably 20.15G ninth-grade
pupils in the state registered in junior
high schools, making an estimated
total of 233,097 high school pupils. In
the meantime, although the state popu
lation has grown, the ratio of high
school attendance to pupils has grown
very much more rapidly—from nine
high school pupils per 1000 population
to 49 per 1000 population.

At Stanford, in spite of the limits on
the number of men with less than
third-year standing admitted to the
University, the total registration has
increased from 2949 in 1919-20 to 4304,
the estimated total for the current
year. These totals include all who
attend the University for as much as
a single quarter during the year. The
figures by quarter show the same in
crease, from 2451 in the autumn quar
ter 1919-20, for instance, to 3138 this
year. This increase has necessarily
come about almost wholly in the junior
and senior and graduate years. The
number of graduate students, for in
stance, has grown from 283 to 553.

The Bulletin also gives figures show
ing the rapid growth in junior college
attendance. In 1922-23 the attendance
in junior colleges, including those con
nected with or supported by high
school districts, or connected with
teachers' colleges, was 1826, a number
which has grown to 5520 this year.
Five new junior colleges had been es
tablished in the meantime and four
have been organized this year since
these statistics were compiled. There
are now 27 junior colleges in the state,
not counting the four just mentioned,
21 connected with high schools and six
with teachers' colleges.
