# DRAMATICS STUDENTS PLAN NEW GROUP OF SHORT PRODUCTIONS
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Several one-act plays will be pro
duced in the Little Theatre June 9
, and 10 by the play production class, j
I English 19b. These plays will com- i
i plete the quarter's offering of plays by !
| this class, under the direction of:
! Marion Craig Wentworth. The group i
i includes "What If They Could?" a!
| radio whimsy by Mrs. Wentworth.
Chief among the* productions is "The I
Truth," by Benavente, the greatest!
| Spanish dramatist of the day. This !
i work has been translated from the j
i Spanish, and received the Nobel prize '
I in 1924. Lloyd Nolan and Aileen Burks i
[ carry the leads.
This play is an example of the most \
modern realism. The play as a whole is
j subtle and sophisticated in the ex
i treme, containing a great deal of
i poetry and telling lines. It is not melo-j
i dramatic in the American idea, but
! calls for quiet forceful acting.
I Mrs. Wentworth's play bears a
j psychic strain through it. It is an i
! attempt to reveal the other world, and
is a prophecy of the future. Critics
claim the same mystic power for Mrs.
Wentworth herself in her rendition of
I several characterizations.
The second play, "His Voice in a
Whisper," is an Indian masque, taken i
from a volume of Manitou masques,
I translated from the Indian by Hartley
Alexander. The action and pantomime j
:in the original Indian version have
| been retained in this play of ancient
standing and tribal meaning. The play
gives an opportunity to show the won
derful poetry and lofty faith and ideal-!
ism of the American Indian language.
Albert Freemen, a full-blooded Sioux |
Indian, is lending his aid in the fine
; points of direction of this play. His!
j Indian name is Gaii-Wah-Go-Wah, or I
| "Voice Bearing a Message."
The plays given are selected from
' international sources in an effort to i
| familiarize American people with the
customs and ideals of other lands, i
Russian, Chinese, Indian, American, j
Canadian, and other foreign plays have j
been selected with this purpose.
