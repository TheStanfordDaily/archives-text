# GEOLOGISTS SELECT SUMMER COURSE SITE
## 
### 
The Ventura quadrangle has been j
i selected as the location for the sum
| mer geology course by Professor C. F.
Tolman, Hubert G. Schenck, and Linn
1 M. Farrish after visiting the region
j last week-end.
Interesting geological outcroppings
j were found, with a rapid developing
oil field in the vicinity. The field until 1
lately has been non-productive because
of the high pressure of the oil body.
Due to the work of a Stanford gradu-;
1 ate, Hortel, this difficulty has been
j overcome.
