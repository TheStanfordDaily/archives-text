# DAILY MAY PUBLISH MORNING PAPER AS INCOME INCREASES
## INCREASE A NECESSITY Ex Committee Adds $1.00 to Associated Students Quarterly Fee 
### 
The possibility of having a morning
! paper on the campus next fall was
j given a great boost at the Executive
I Committee meeting last night when
| that body passed a by-law increasing
the quarterly A.S.S.U. fee. According
l to the new ruling, the fee in the fu
; ture will be $3.00 instead of $2.00, mak
j ing the total amount to be paid at the
j beginning of each quarter for tuition
; and incidentals $97 instead of $98. Of
' this increase the Daily Palo Alto will
receive twenty-five cents.
! This extra income may make it pos
j sible for the Daily to be published in
| the mornings, according to an an
j nouncement by the business manager
| this noon. With the morning publica
; tion the Daily would be enabled to give
i complete coverage on happenings of
| the entire day and night on the morn
i ing after it happens.
j This was also necessary, according
! to the Committee to meet the expenses
| of the Association Students' activities,
j which are increasing every year, and
I which require increasingly large ex
j penditures.
Under the new ruling the distribu
tion is made as follows:
1. One Dollar ($1.00) to the Board
of Athletic Control.
a) Of this one dollar ($1.00) the
Women's Athletic Association
shall receive fifty cents (50c) per
each undergraduate women.
2. Two dollars ($2.00) to the Asso
ciated Students (A.S.S.U.). This to be
further divided as follows:
a) Seventy-five cents (75c) per
each undergraduate student shall
go to the Daily Palo Alto.
b) Twenty-five cents (25c) per
each undergraduate woman stu
dent shall go to the Associated
Women Students.
c) One dollar and twenty-five
cents ($1.25) per undergraduate
• student (man) shall go to the As
sociated Students (A.S.S.U.).
d) One dollar ($1.00) per each
undergraduate woman student
shall go to the Associated Stu
dents (A.S.S.U.).
Some important reasons for having
a morning paper, as pointed out in the
! editorial column last week, are as fol
lows: Latest news would be contained
;in a morning edition since almost
every event of importance on this cam
pus occurs between noon and midnight.
1 Since there is a possibility that an
Associated Press franchise could be
secured later, the sheet would carry
| the latest in the field of world news.
Since the editorial work on a morn
ing paper would be done during the
hours of 2 o'clock in the afternoon and
I 12 o'clock at night, the time ordinarily
| spent in work in the morning as well
i as afternoon and evening would be
saved. The business staff would find it
: easier to solicit advertising in Palo
Alto, for the campus paper would be
: the only morning journal in the com-
J munity.
Under the old system, in effect until
| the end of this year, $1 went to the
j Board of Athletic Control, 50 cents of
| the women's money going to the Wo
; men's Athletic Association. The other
$1 went to the Associated Students to
Ibe divided between The Daily Palo
Alto, Associated Women Students, and
I the general Associated Students fund.
Fifty cents went to the paper, 25 cents
| of the women's money went to Asso
! ciated Women, and 25 cents to the

Some important reasons for having
a morning paper, as pointed out in the
! editorial column last week, are as fol
lows: Latest news would be contained
;in a morning edition since almost
every event of importance on this cam
pus occurs between noon and midnight.
1 Since there is a possibility that an
Associated Press franchise could be
secured later, the sheet would carry
| the latest in the field of world news.
Since the editorial work on a morn
ing paper would be done during the
hours of 2 o'clock in the afternoon and
I 12 o'clock at night, the time ordinarily
| spent in work in the morning as well
i as afternoon and evening would be
saved. The business staff would find it
: easier to solicit advertising in Palo
Alto, for the campus paper would be
: the only morning journal in the com-
J munity.
Under the old system, in effect until
| the end of this year, $1 went to the
j Board of Athletic Control, 50 cents of
| the women's money going to the Wo
; men's Athletic Association. The other
$1 went to the Associated Students to
Ibe divided between The Daily Palo
Alto, Associated Women Students, and
I the general Associated Students fund.
Fifty cents went to the paper, 25 cents
| of the women's money went to Asso
! ciated Women, and 25 cents to the
i
j general fund. Of the men's money 50
! cents went to the Daily, and 50' cents
to the general fund.
The possibility of having a morning
! paper on the campus next fall was
j given a great boost at the Executive
I Committee meeting last night when
| that body passed a by-law increasing
the quarterly A.S.S.U. fee. According
l to the new ruling, the fee in the fu
; ture will be $3.00 instead of $2.00, mak
j ing the total amount to be paid at the
j beginning of each quarter for tuition
; and incidentals $97 instead of $98. Of
' this increase the Daily Palo Alto will
receive twenty-five cents.
! This extra income may make it pos
j sible for the Daily to be published in
| the mornings, according to an an
j nouncement by the business manager
| this noon. With the morning publica
; tion the Daily would be enabled to give
i complete coverage on happenings of
| the entire day and night on the morn
i ing after it happens.
j This was also necessary, according
! to the Committee to meet the expenses
| of the Association Students' activities,
j which are increasing every year, and
I which require increasingly large ex
j penditures.
Under the new ruling the distribu
tion is made as follows:
1. One Dollar ($1.00) to the Board
of Athletic Control.
a) Of this one dollar ($1.00) the
Women's Athletic Association
shall receive fifty cents (50c) per
each undergraduate women.
2. Two dollars ($2.00) to the Asso
ciated Students (A.S.S.U.). This to be
further divided as follows:
a) Seventy-five cents (75c) per
each undergraduate student shall
go to the Daily Palo Alto.
b) Twenty-five cents (25c) per
each undergraduate woman stu
dent shall go to the Associated
Women Students.
c) One dollar and twenty-five
cents ($1.25) per undergraduate
• student (man) shall go to the As
sociated Students (A.S.S.U.).
d) One dollar ($1.00) per each
