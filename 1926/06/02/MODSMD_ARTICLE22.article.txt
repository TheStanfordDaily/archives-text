Securing an invaluable collection of
scale insects, many hitherto unknown.
Professor Gordon F. Ferris of the En
tomology department has returned
from an eleven-months trip in Mexico.
Professor Ferris visited the west coast,
passing over bandit-infested regions
and sections of the southern mountain
area where isolation has kept condi
tions in practically a barbaric state.
On his return, the Stanford professor
visited the eastern coast and Mexico
City.
