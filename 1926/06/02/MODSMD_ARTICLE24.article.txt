# A 						Baseball League

### 
An editorial appearing in the last volume of 1 he Daily Palo Alto
recommended that a California intercollegiate baseball league be formed.
It was pointed out that while the Pacific Coast Conference made adequate
provisions for football, track, and basketball it of necessity neglected base
ball. The nines in Oregon and Washington, because of the weather con
ditions, are not able to start practicing until the Spring; but there seems
to be plenty of available material.
Fortunately the colleges in California are closely grouped in two dis
tricts —California, Saint Mary's, Santa Clara, and Stanford in the North;
U.S.C., Pomona, Occidental, and the Southern Branch in the South. It
would be possible for each district to have a play-off, and then let the two
winners play a "state series." Such an arrangement would undoubtedly
attract considerable interest; and would do much to reinstate the diamond
game to its former more important position in the realm of collegiate
sports.
As it is the Stanford players have three or four months of hard work
outs; and then they meet the Kenealy Seals, the Ambrose 1 ailors, the
Redwood City Police, and Ireland's Independents—all of which are un
doubtedly good teams. But with the exception of the annual clash with
Cliff Ireland, none of the contests arouse an appreciable amount of student
interest. When these recruited teams have completed their invasion, the
Cardinals turn to the Southern part of the state, play a series of games
which mean little, and return to meet California. The Bruin-Card series
is the only one at which there is anything at stake.
Imagine any other sport continuing its existence under such a handi
cap. Even football, now the predominant collegiate sport, would probably
soon be relegated to a lower position if the elevens were not provided with
decisive preliminary season contests.
Perhaps the time is not ripe for the formation of such a league as was
outlined above ;'but at any rate the matter is worth some thought, and some
active move might be taken during the summer months. Next year we
would like to see some keen competition in the California Intercolicgiate
Baseball League's State Scries.
Possible source of misinterpretation seen in the news columns of the j
Pacific University Index:
"Professor Hopkins and his sociological class drove to Salem last Wednes
day to make a more detailed study of the state penitentiary. Although all of
those making the trip had visited the penitentiary before, it was not until this
trip was made that they really knew how the work was carried on."
The process of deduction is given its logical application at Ohio State j
University. Reported by the Lantern :
"Eight freshmen were thrown into Mirror Lake at 11 a.m. today by Bucket
and Dipper as the beginning of a strenuous campaign to enforce freshman rules.
The campaign was started by the painting of two signs, one on the Long Walk
and one beside the spring, reading: 'To H with Bucket and Dipper.'
"Exactly who did the work is not known, but bf ducking several freshmen a
day for the next two weeks the members of the organization expect to reach the
real culprits."

More advertising space in heaven for Yale. A Yale man on the subject
of compulsory chapel as quoted by the New Student:
"Yale has not yet abolished God. . . Yale is the last great fortress against a
mechanistic age, and the temple within the stronghold is seriously threatened
with demolition."

Slight inaccuracy on the matter of safe and sane prohibition enforce
ment discovered in the University Daily Kansan :
"The house bill appropriating $9,000,000 for 10 new coast guard cutters to
augment the rum fleet was favorably reported by Senate commerce committee."
