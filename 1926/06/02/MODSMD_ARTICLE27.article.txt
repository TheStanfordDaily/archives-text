Dere Jaik:
1 wuz grately sooprized the uther daie to find that polishing appels is not
an institooshun in this universitie like I thot it wuz. If yew ever cum here
Jaik dont ever tri to polish apels in publik becuz the profs dont appreshiait
it 1 bit.
Yew see Jaik it wuz this waie. On account of mie being abowt ready to
flunk owt in mie eekon curse 1 desides to polish a few appels with the prof
having herd as how it wuz veri defective at times. But never having seen
it dun I dident noe just how to go abowt it. But eniwaie I goz down town
and bies 2 nise appels at the groshary stoar and taiks them in cumpeny with
a peace of 1 of mie red flannle shirts (with wich to polish them) to class
with me.
After the prof getz thru blabbin I goz up to him and offers him the appels
sayin at the same time, like this:
"Can I polish them fur yew sur?"
The prof sorta lukt aniway as if he mite like apels but at furst he dident
seem to taik it so well becuz I seen him sorta scowl. But jaik I always did
sai that I hev a convinsing false becuz he seems abowt ready to throe the
ink well at me when all of a sudden he luks again at appels in mie 1 hand and
the peace of flannle in tuther and then at mie faise and sorta smiles. Then he
sez: "Shure"; just like that.
Wei jaik 1 polishes away on them appels for abowt ten minutes until
yew cud see the freckles on your nose in em, the prof and the two gies wich
wuz lookin on, smilin all the time. Then I hands em to the prof and walks owt,
at the same time hearing him chukkel with glee becuz he wuz so glad to get
them appels.
I sez to miself I must be a sinch to get a A in that curse but do yew noe
Jaik that when I got mie examinashun paper back todaie it har a strait ( —)

From Willie to Papa; This Here Intramural Stuff
Dear Papa:
Well, I can hardly move or manipulate this typewriter on acc. of being
stiff all over —I mean in my muscles. You see they are having the annual
Intramural track campaign for all the clubs on the campds. And each club
is obliged to beg, borrow, or steal as many trackmen (?) as they can on acc.
of the more men they run, the more chnce they have of winning this here
tournament.
Well, of course I turns out for dear old 0.0.0. —my life wouldnt have
been worth the lick of a postage stamp if I hadnt —and so does the rest of
the 0.0.0.'5. I didnt have any track suit so I startles the boys out of their
census by appearing in my 8.V.D., covered partially by a sweat shirt, and
wreaing by everyday (and Sunday) street shoes.
Well, the first days they had the 100 yd. dash and the broad jump. I did
fine, myself, but the others boys didnt go so well. For instance, my time in
the 100 was 15 flat. The others didnt even qualify for the event. And in the
broad jump, being broad-minded, I made 11 2-5 feet which far outclassed the
rest of the boys.
Well, the following days they had the hurdles, and in this event I scored
100 persent. I was the only guy in the whole bunch who knocked down all I
the hurdles without falling on my face. The rest all left theres standing up J
like rummies, the guys I mean. So I guess I won that event easily. Likewise
I heaved the shot 15 feet counting the roll thus winning the shot in a rollaway.
Well, the next days occurred the y 2 mile and the discus throw. Now you
know I have always been a good distance runner. It runs in the family as all
the menfolks were in the old army game and were specially adept at long
distance retreating preferring to be shot in the posterior than elsewhere, for
which I cant blame them exactly. Anyway I had no difficulty in running the
| half in 3:45; with ease —honest it was like taking milk from a baby—no one
I else would run it with me knowing I was so good. In the discus it was a
ffinny thing. I was winding up in great form preparing to break the record
when the darn thing slipped out of my hand and went backwards to the
extent of 36 ft., a winning throw without a doubt. So I didnt have to throw
no more; they was so jealous that they told me to get the hell away from
there —but I wasnt mad.
Well, tomorrow they are going to name the winner of the Intramural cup.
Of course, it will go to dear old 0.0.0., me having scored most heavily in all
events —its too bad that I didnt go out for varsity track, just think of all the ]
records I might have smashed.
Well, I certainly am stiff, but being high-point man of the meat was j
worth it, and besides it aint the first time I've been stiff —but not in the way
you mean. There being nothing else, I might as well close till next time.
Your darling boy, Willie. W.P.W. I

which I cant blame them exactly. Anyway I had no difficulty in running the
| half in 3:45; with ease —honest it was like taking milk from a baby—no one
I else would run it with me knowing I was so good. In the discus it was a
ffinny thing. I was winding up in great form preparing to break the record
when the darn thing slipped out of my hand and went backwards to the
extent of 36 ft., a winning throw without a doubt. So I didnt have to throw
no more; they was so jealous that they told me to get the hell away from
there —but I wasnt mad.
Well, tomorrow they are going to name the winner of the Intramural cup.
Of course, it will go to dear old 0.0.0., me having scored most heavily in all
events —its too bad that I didnt go out for varsity track, just think of all the ]
records I might have smashed.
Well, I certainly am stiff, but being high-point man of the meat was j
worth it, and besides it aint the first time I've been stiff —but not in the way
you mean. There being nothing else, I might as well close till next time.

From Willie to Papa; This Here Intramural Stuff
Dear Papa:
Well, I can hardly move or manipulate this typewriter on acc. of being
stiff all over —I mean in my muscles. You see they are having the annual
Intramural track campaign for all the clubs on the campds. And each club
is obliged to beg, borrow, or steal as many trackmen (?) as they can on acc.
of the more men they run, the more chnce they have of winning this here
tournament.
Well, of course I turns out for dear old 0.0.0. —my life wouldnt have
been worth the lick of a postage stamp if I hadnt —and so does the rest of
the 0.0.0.'5. I didnt have any track suit so I startles the boys out of their
census by appearing in my 8.V.D., covered partially by a sweat shirt, and
wreaing by everyday (and Sunday) street shoes.
Well, the first days they had the 100 yd. dash and the broad jump. I did
fine, myself, but the others boys didnt go so well. For instance, my time in
the 100 was 15 flat. The others didnt even qualify for the event. And in the
broad jump, being broad-minded, I made 11 2-5 feet which far outclassed the
rest of the boys.
Well, the following days they had the hurdles, and in this event I scored
100 persent. I was the only guy in the whole bunch who knocked down all I
the hurdles without falling on my face. The rest all left theres standing up J
like rummies, the guys I mean. So I guess I won that event easily. Likewise
I heaved the shot 15 feet counting the roll thus winning the shot in a rollaway.
Well, the next days occurred the y 2 mile and the discus throw. Now you
know I have always been a good distance runner. It runs in the family as all
the menfolks were in the old army game and were specially adept at long
distance retreating preferring to be shot in the posterior than elsewhere, for
which I cant blame them exactly. Anyway I had no difficulty in running the
| half in 3:45; with ease —honest it was like taking milk from a baby—no one

census by appearing in my 8.V.D., covered partially by a sweat shirt, and
wreaing by everyday (and Sunday) street shoes.
Well, the first days they had the 100 yd. dash and the broad jump. I did
fine, myself, but the others boys didnt go so well. For instance, my time in
the 100 was 15 flat. The others didnt even qualify for the event. And in the
broad jump, being broad-minded, I made 11 2-5 feet which far outclassed the
rest of the boys.
Well, the following days they had the hurdles, and in this event I scored
100 persent. I was the only guy in the whole bunch who knocked down all I
the hurdles without falling on my face. The rest all left theres standing up J
like rummies, the guys I mean. So I guess I won that event easily. Likewise
I heaved the shot 15 feet counting the roll thus winning the shot in a rollaway.
Well, the next days occurred the y 2 mile and the discus throw. Now you
know I have always been a good distance runner. It runs in the family as all
the menfolks were in the old army game and were specially adept at long
distance retreating preferring to be shot in the posterior than elsewhere, for
which I cant blame them exactly. Anyway I had no difficulty in running the
| half in 3:45; with ease —honest it was like taking milk from a baby—no one
I else would run it with me knowing I was so good. In the discus it was a
ffinny thing. I was winding up in great form preparing to break the record
when the darn thing slipped out of my hand and went backwards to the
extent of 36 ft., a winning throw without a doubt. So I didnt have to throw
no more; they was so jealous that they told me to get the hell away from
there —but I wasnt mad.
Well, tomorrow they are going to name the winner of the Intramural cup.
Of course, it will go to dear old 0.0.0., me having scored most heavily in all
events —its too bad that I didnt go out for varsity track, just think of all the ]
records I might have smashed.
Well, I certainly am stiff, but being high-point man of the meat was j
worth it, and besides it aint the first time I've been stiff —but not in the way
you mean. There being nothing else, I might as well close till next time.
Your darling boy, Willie. W.P.W. I

After the prof getz thru blabbin I goz up to him and offers him the appels

Dear Papa:
Well, I can hardly move or manipulate this typewriter on acc. of being
stiff all over —I mean in my muscles. You see they are having the annual

is obliged to beg, borrow, or steal as many trackmen (?) as they can on acc.
of the more men they run, the more chnce they have of winning this here
tournament.
Well, of course I turns out for dear old 0.0.0. —my life wouldnt have
been worth the lick of a postage stamp if I hadnt —and so does the rest of
