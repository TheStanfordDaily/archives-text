# ANTI-AIRCRAFT WORK IS SHOWN AT CAMP OF FIELD ARTILLERY
## Three Listening Devices Are Used to Locate Plane By Sound Direction 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Battery A of the 63d Coast Artillery
Anti-aircraft unit from Fort Scott, San
Francisco, under Captain Horace L.
Whittaker, has established a working
field unit of anti-aircraft activities on
the military department drill field.
They will remain on the campus for a
month, carrying on tests and actual
observations of locating aircraft at
night.
The work is done in conjunction with
the aircraft service, the planes operat
ing from Crissy Field, San Francisco,
from which point the planes start down
in the night in an attempt to locate the
anti-aircrafe outfit and simulate bomb
ing them. Work along this line will be
carried on early in June.
Three Times a Week
Operations are being carried on every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday nights,
at which time the listening devices and
pilot searchlights are operated. The
listening devices are known as expo
nential sound locators, so called be
cause of the shape of the horns which
follow an exponential curve, which lias
been determined as the best for gath
ering sound. There are three such de
vices at the field of operations. Each
one is worked as a single unit in con
junction with a plotting board and one
searchlight known as the pilot light.
Four men are detailed to each outfit
as a crew; of these four, one listens for
direction of sound in a horizontal po
sition, or the azimuth, as it is called.
Another listens in a perpendicular plane
to the'first in order to determine the
elevation of the flying aircraft. The re
maining two read the scales giving the
angle of the azimuth from the true
north, and the angle of elevation.
This data is sent to the plotting room j
by a headset phone and is there cor-J
rected for sound lag, atmospheric den- j
sity, and wind. The sound lag is the '
result of the fact that the plane is fly-1
ing at a certain rate, and the sound is j
travelling at another rate. There must!
be calculation to determine the distance !
the plane has travelled from the point j
at which the sound was generated. The I
data thus obtained is called out to the
pilot light which also has elevation and J
azimuth scales and which, at the com- j
mand of "in action," the searchlight is
turned on and then is supposed to be in
the general field of the plane. One out;
of six times a direct hit is considered \
to be a good average with a well
trained crew of listeners.
Work Done Rapidly
Other lights are organized in groups
about these pilot lights as directive
points and are charted as to form inter- i
sections at about the point where the
plane is or should be, and if the plane
is not directly hit, the others search
along the pilot beam with a sort of
scissors effect and try to catch the plane
in the inverted cone of light above the
intersection of the three or more beams.
Ordinary time between the first sound
from the motors of the plane and the
time when the plane will be in position
to bomb the workings is calculated to
be not over three minutes, so the work
being done by the listeners must be
done rapidly.
The listeners themselves are fairly
accurate, if the men operating them
are good. There is considerable of a
knack in the listening, and it would
seem that good listeners were born, not
made. The man tries to equalize the
sound in both ears, rather than seek
for volume, since there is one horn for
each ear. At present the unit is prac
ticing listening and running the lights
independently. Next week they will
combine all operations together and try
to pick up planes as they come down
from the starting place at San Fran
cisco.

Game to Be Played
About June 8 or 9, regular maneuvers j
will commence, when planes from the i
starting field will take off at an un
known hour to the listeners, and will
attempt to drop a simulated bomb, con- 1
sisting of a flare. The work of the lis- j
teners has been successful if they locate
the advancing plane before "bombs"
can be dropped. The searchlights will
be placed in a form which will repre
sent an area guarded by searchlights
and guns'. The sensitive area which
the bombers will attempt to hit will be
represented by a single searchlight with
the beam thrown perpendicularly in
the air, and located at Sunnyvale. This J
will remain fixed. The plan is not ar- j
ranged to test the ability of the bomb
ers to hit the area, but merely the abil
ity of the observers to pick up the |
planes.
Four phases will be gone through,
each phase representing a bombing
squadron. Each phase will end with 1
the dropping of a flare, which is sup
posed to be fired at a point in the air j
at which they could release a bomb in

order to drop it on the defended sensi
tive point.
In addition to the test on location
and illumination, it is also designed to
see how quickly the observers can pick
up the plane and determine its ap
proximate position, altitude, speed, and
other factors in order to relay the in
formation to friendly forces which
might be several miles in the rear.
These posts, without the searchlights,
are often used for advance stations for
anti-aircraft guns, also equipped with
listening devices. The experiments will
be conducted as if San Jose were the
point of sensitivity. At present, a radio
at South San Francisco is acting as ad
vance post for this unit, in order to an
nounce the time at which the planes
come over their point of observation.

ranged to test the ability of the bomb
ers to hit the area, but merely the abil
ity of the observers to pick up the |
planes.
Four phases will be gone through,
each phase representing a bombing
squadron. Each phase will end with 1
the dropping of a flare, which is sup
posed to be fired at a point in the air j
at which they could release a bomb in

order to drop it on the defended sensi
tive point.
In addition to the test on location
and illumination, it is also designed to
see how quickly the observers can pick
up the plane and determine its ap
proximate position, altitude, speed, and
other factors in order to relay the in
formation to friendly forces which
might be several miles in the rear.
These posts, without the searchlights,
are often used for advance stations for
anti-aircraft guns, also equipped with
listening devices. The experiments will
be conducted as if San Jose were the
point of sensitivity. At present, a radio
at South San Francisco is acting as ad
vance post for this unit, in order to an
nounce the time at which the planes
come over their point of observation.
Battery A of the 63d Coast Artillery
Anti-aircraft unit from Fort Scott, San
Francisco, under Captain Horace L.
Whittaker, has established a working
field unit of anti-aircraft activities on
the military department drill field.
They will remain on the campus for a
month, carrying on tests and actual
observations of locating aircraft at
night.
The work is done in conjunction with
the aircraft service, the planes operat
ing from Crissy Field, San Francisco,
from which point the planes start down
in the night in an attempt to locate the
anti-aircrafe outfit and simulate bomb
ing them. Work along this line will be
carried on early in June.
Three Times a Week
Operations are being carried on every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday nights,
at which time the listening devices and
pilot searchlights are operated. The
listening devices are known as expo
nential sound locators, so called be
cause of the shape of the horns which
follow an exponential curve, which lias
been determined as the best for gath
ering sound. There are three such de
vices at the field of operations. Each
one is worked as a single unit in con
junction with a plotting board and one
searchlight known as the pilot light.
Four men are detailed to each outfit
as a crew; of these four, one listens for
direction of sound in a horizontal po
sition, or the azimuth, as it is called.
Another listens in a perpendicular plane
to the'first in order to determine the
elevation of the flying aircraft. The re
maining two read the scales giving the
angle of the azimuth from the true
north, and the angle of elevation.
This data is sent to the plotting room j
by a headset phone and is there cor-J
rected for sound lag, atmospheric den- j
sity, and wind. The sound lag is the '
result of the fact that the plane is fly-1
ing at a certain rate, and the sound is j
travelling at another rate. There must!
be calculation to determine the distance !
the plane has travelled from the point j
at which the sound was generated. The I
data thus obtained is called out to the
pilot light which also has elevation and J
azimuth scales and which, at the com- j
mand of "in action," the searchlight is
turned on and then is supposed to be in
the general field of the plane. One out;
of six times a direct hit is considered \
to be a good average with a well
trained crew of listeners.
Work Done Rapidly
Other lights are organized in groups
about these pilot lights as directive
points and are charted as to form inter- i
sections at about the point where the
plane is or should be, and if the plane
is not directly hit, the others search
along the pilot beam with a sort of
scissors effect and try to catch the plane
in the inverted cone of light above the
intersection of the three or more beams.
Ordinary time between the first sound
from the motors of the plane and the
time when the plane will be in position
to bomb the workings is calculated to
be not over three minutes, so the work
being done by the listeners must be
done rapidly.
The listeners themselves are fairly
accurate, if the men operating them
are good. There is considerable of a
knack in the listening, and it would
seem that good listeners were born, not
made. The man tries to equalize the
sound in both ears, rather than seek
for volume, since there is one horn for
each ear. At present the unit is prac
ticing listening and running the lights
independently. Next week they will
combine all operations together and try
to pick up planes as they come down
from the starting place at San Fran
cisco.

Game to Be Played
About June 8 or 9, regular maneuvers j
will commence, when planes from the i
starting field will take off at an un
known hour to the listeners, and will
attempt to drop a simulated bomb, con- 1
sisting of a flare. The work of the lis- j
teners has been successful if they locate
the advancing plane before "bombs"
can be dropped. The searchlights will
be placed in a form which will repre
sent an area guarded by searchlights
and guns'. The sensitive area which
the bombers will attempt to hit will be
represented by a single searchlight with
the beam thrown perpendicularly in
the air, and located at Sunnyvale. This J
will remain fixed. The plan is not ar- j

sound in both ears, rather than seek
for volume, since there is one horn for
each ear. At present the unit is prac
ticing listening and running the lights
independently. Next week they will
combine all operations together and try
to pick up planes as they come down
from the starting place at San Fran
cisco.

Game to Be Played
About June 8 or 9, regular maneuvers j
will commence, when planes from the i
starting field will take off at an un
known hour to the listeners, and will
attempt to drop a simulated bomb, con- 1
sisting of a flare. The work of the lis- j
teners has been successful if they locate
the advancing plane before "bombs"
can be dropped. The searchlights will
be placed in a form which will repre
sent an area guarded by searchlights
and guns'. The sensitive area which
the bombers will attempt to hit will be
represented by a single searchlight with
the beam thrown perpendicularly in
the air, and located at Sunnyvale. This J
will remain fixed. The plan is not ar- j
ranged to test the ability of the bomb
ers to hit the area, but merely the abil
ity of the observers to pick up the |
planes.
Four phases will be gone through,
each phase representing a bombing
squadron. Each phase will end with 1
the dropping of a flare, which is sup
posed to be fired at a point in the air j
at which they could release a bomb in

order to drop it on the defended sensi
tive point.
In addition to the test on location
and illumination, it is also designed to
see how quickly the observers can pick
up the plane and determine its ap
proximate position, altitude, speed, and
other factors in order to relay the in
formation to friendly forces which
might be several miles in the rear.
These posts, without the searchlights,
are often used for advance stations for
anti-aircraft guns, also equipped with
listening devices. The experiments will
be conducted as if San Jose were the
point of sensitivity. At present, a radio
at South San Francisco is acting as ad
vance post for this unit, in order to an
nounce the time at which the planes
come over their point of observation.
Battery A of the 63d Coast Artillery
Anti-aircraft unit from Fort Scott, San
Francisco, under Captain Horace L.
Whittaker, has established a working
field unit of anti-aircraft activities on
the military department drill field.
They will remain on the campus for a
month, carrying on tests and actual
observations of locating aircraft at
night.
The work is done in conjunction with
the aircraft service, the planes operat
ing from Crissy Field, San Francisco,
from which point the planes start down
in the night in an attempt to locate the
anti-aircrafe outfit and simulate bomb
ing them. Work along this line will be
carried on early in June.
Three Times a Week
Operations are being carried on every
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday nights,
at which time the listening devices and
pilot searchlights are operated. The
listening devices are known as expo
nential sound locators, so called be
cause of the shape of the horns which
follow an exponential curve, which lias
been determined as the best for gath
ering sound. There are three such de
vices at the field of operations. Each
one is worked as a single unit in con
junction with a plotting board and one
searchlight known as the pilot light.
Four men are detailed to each outfit
as a crew; of these four, one listens for
direction of sound in a horizontal po
sition, or the azimuth, as it is called.
Another listens in a perpendicular plane
to the'first in order to determine the
elevation of the flying aircraft. The re
maining two read the scales giving the
angle of the azimuth from the true
north, and the angle of elevation.
This data is sent to the plotting room j
by a headset phone and is there cor-J
rected for sound lag, atmospheric den- j
sity, and wind. The sound lag is the '
result of the fact that the plane is fly-1
ing at a certain rate, and the sound is j
travelling at another rate. There must!
be calculation to determine the distance !
the plane has travelled from the point j
at which the sound was generated. The I
data thus obtained is called out to the
pilot light which also has elevation and J
azimuth scales and which, at the com- j
mand of "in action," the searchlight is
turned on and then is supposed to be in
the general field of the plane. One out;
of six times a direct hit is considered \
to be a good average with a well
trained crew of listeners.
Work Done Rapidly
Other lights are organized in groups
about these pilot lights as directive
points and are charted as to form inter- i
sections at about the point where the
plane is or should be, and if the plane
is not directly hit, the others search
along the pilot beam with a sort of
scissors effect and try to catch the plane
in the inverted cone of light above the
intersection of the three or more beams.
Ordinary time between the first sound
from the motors of the plane and the
time when the plane will be in position
to bomb the workings is calculated to
be not over three minutes, so the work
being done by the listeners must be
done rapidly.
The listeners themselves are fairly
accurate, if the men operating them
are good. There is considerable of a
knack in the listening, and it would
seem that good listeners were born, not
made. The man tries to equalize the
