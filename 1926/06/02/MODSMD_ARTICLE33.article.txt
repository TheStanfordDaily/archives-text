# STANFORD SWIMMERS ENTERED IN OLYMPIC MEET INDEPENDENTLY
## 
### Herb Klein 
Cardinal aquatic stars will compete
in the swimming meet to be held Sun
day evening, June 13, at the Olympic
Club of San Francisco, as unattached
entries. They will be unable to swim
for Stanford because of the rule pro
hibiting any athlete representing this
University competing on Sundays.
Three swimming races and one div
ing event will be held, which are ex
pecte dto attract some of the greatest
aquatic talent of Northern California.
The races are the 220-yard free style,
220-yard breaststroke, and 150-yard
backstroke, all open events. There will
also be high fancy diving for the Smith
trophy.
Five of Ernst Brandsten's proteges
will compete in the various events,
and have good chances to grab a string
of firsts. Carl Stevenson, diminutive
varsity middle distance star, will enter
the 220-yard free style.
Stevenson has made 2:28 in prac
tice already, and should cut this down
by several seconds before the furlong.
He will have plenty of competition if
Lester Smith and a few of the other
Olympic Club flashes are on hand.
Smith holds the Pacific Coast record
in the furlong at 2:21, and usually has
things all his own way at the distance.
Skip Littlefield and Cece West will
swim in the 220-yard breaststroke.
Both are speedy at the sailor-style
stroke and swim fairly evenly. Little
field has the edge on basis of past
times. Whoever wins will have to do
3:04 or better, according to dopesters.
Ted Smith, varsity backstroke star,
will swim his own peculiar stroke in
the 150-yard dorsal swim. In the past
week Smith has turned in 1:53 for the
distance and since this was in prac
tice without any extra effort there is
a good chance that he will be able to
nick 1:50' for the race. This is as fast
time as Arden Allen, first Card back
stroker for the past three years, has
made in Encina Pool.

Dave Fall will probably cinch the
Robert A. Smith diving trophy by de
feating Guerton Carroll of the Olympic
Club in the high diving. Both
Carroll and Fall have each taken one
leg on the cup in the past tw ocompeti
tions, but Fall has been Carroll's super
ior in the high fancy variety for some
time past, and should take the title
and with it the cup, unless something
unforeseen happens.

made in Encina Pool.

Dave Fall will probably cinch the
Robert A. Smith diving trophy by de
feating Guerton Carroll of the Olympic
Club in the high diving. Both
Carroll and Fall have each taken one
leg on the cup in the past tw ocompeti
tions, but Fall has been Carroll's super
ior in the high fancy variety for some
time past, and should take the title
and with it the cup, unless something
unforeseen happens.
Cardinal aquatic stars will compete
in the swimming meet to be held Sun
day evening, June 13, at the Olympic
Club of San Francisco, as unattached
entries. They will be unable to swim
for Stanford because of the rule pro
hibiting any athlete representing this
University competing on Sundays.
Three swimming races and one div
ing event will be held, which are ex
pecte dto attract some of the greatest
aquatic talent of Northern California.
The races are the 220-yard free style,
220-yard breaststroke, and 150-yard
backstroke, all open events. There will
also be high fancy diving for the Smith
trophy.
Five of Ernst Brandsten's proteges
will compete in the various events,
and have good chances to grab a string
of firsts. Carl Stevenson, diminutive
varsity middle distance star, will enter
the 220-yard free style.
Stevenson has made 2:28 in prac
tice already, and should cut this down
by several seconds before the furlong.
He will have plenty of competition if
Lester Smith and a few of the other
Olympic Club flashes are on hand.
Smith holds the Pacific Coast record
in the furlong at 2:21, and usually has
things all his own way at the distance.
Skip Littlefield and Cece West will
swim in the 220-yard breaststroke.
Both are speedy at the sailor-style
stroke and swim fairly evenly. Little
field has the edge on basis of past
times. Whoever wins will have to do
3:04 or better, according to dopesters.
Ted Smith, varsity backstroke star,
will swim his own peculiar stroke in
the 150-yard dorsal swim. In the past
week Smith has turned in 1:53 for the
distance and since this was in prac
tice without any extra effort there is
a good chance that he will be able to
nick 1:50' for the race. This is as fast
time as Arden Allen, first Card back
stroker for the past three years, has
made in Encina Pool.
