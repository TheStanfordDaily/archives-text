# STANFORD BAND RECORD RELEASED BY PRODUCERS
## 
### 
The Stanford Band record, bearing
"Stanford Forever" march, and the
Stanford Song Medley was released
today by the Victor Company and will
be on sale at all branch stores of the
company on the Coast immediately.
Through an error at the factory, the
first few records have a label reading
"University of Stanford" band, on
them. This, however, has been cor
rected on the records which are being
manufactured now.
The release of the record by the
Stanford Band came simultaneously
with that of the Yale University Band.
Previous records made by the Illinois,
Cornell, Notre Dame, and Wisconsin
bands have already broken all sales
records. Victor officials have estimated
the sale of the Stanford record to be
at least 100,000. The greatest sale of

I Stanford Band records is expected
during the football season of 1926.
The Band will receive a small royalty
from the sale of each record.
Professor E. Whitney Martin an
| nounced today that the contest for
words for the trio of "Stanford For
i ever" is now open. Band officers de
clare that it will be one of Stanford's
greatest songs and ask that the manu
scripts be written during the summer
and mailed to the band director before
October 1. It is pointed out that the
words to "Come, Join the Band," like
many other great college songs, were
written after the music was written.
. With a musical foundation such as
j "Stanford Forever" furnishes, it is
i hoped that a fine march song will be
j written. A prize of $10, to be awarded
by competent judges, will be piade
i for the best words to the march trio.
