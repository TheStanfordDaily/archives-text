# FIRST STADIUM USED FOR PYTHIAN GAMES IN ANCIENT GREECE
## Varied Types of Structures Common in American Universities 
### Gordon French 
Throughout the world stadiums of!
; various modes and sizes are springing
; up, but practically all are built pri- j
; marily for a single purpose—athletics, j
! Stadiums are 110 new development, but I
after centuries without them, they are !
again coming into their own. This is 1
I particularly true in the United States, j
where practically every college and
: university has its stadium.
One of the first stadiums of the world
.of which there is any remaining trace
' is found in Greece, the first home of
organized athletics. This stadium was
built at Delphi, and was in the shapo
of a "U," having tiers of seats for
the spectators along each side and at
one end, which was semi-circular. This
structure was erected in the third
century, 8.C., and was 630' feet in I
length. It was the scene of the Pythian
Games.
Modifications of "U" Common
A modification of the "U"-shaped
type can be found in the stadium of
i the Ohio State University. In this, the
sides are not quite parallel, but are
curved inward to improve visibility!
at the far ends. Oval and circular sta-'
i dia of which that at Stanford is an
example, are modified "U"-shaped !
| structures with the top of the "U"
! closed in.
The name "stadium" was originally j
applied to the foot-race course at,
; Olympia, Greece, where athletic games I
I were celebrated. To ancient Greeks, 1
I the word "stadium" signified also a
measure of distance, namely, the dis
j tance of 606.75 feet between the ter-!
i minal pillars of the Olympia stadium.
Afterwards the word was adopted by
the Romans, eight stadia making a i
Roman mile.
Have Varied Uses
While a stadium is primarily de
signed for athletic competition, it can
; be used and is used for many other
; purposes such as parades, pageants,
drills, meetings, celebrations, and ex-j
hibitions of all kinds. The Los Angeles
Coliseum has even been used to give
Philharmonic concerts and the same
thing is being done in several Eastern
stadiums. In 1925 when the national
Shriners' convention was being held
in Los Angeles, the Coliseum was used
for their programs and pageants with
great success.
Stadium construction is of two types, j
One is of concrete, such as the Univer- j
sity of California stadium, while the
! other is an earthen bowl built up with
wood, as the Stanford stadium. Both
types have their advantages, the con- j
j Crete type probably being the more
permanent, while the wooden is un
doubtedly the more comfortable of the j
two. To overcome the latter disadvan
tage, some stadiums have concrete
j foundations but the seats are con
structed of wood.
Card Stadium Cost $210,000
The Stanford stadium was started
in the spring of 1921 and completed the
same fall in time for the Big Game.
, President Wilbur turned the first cod
on June 1. It cost $210,000 to build
1 the stadium at its original size of j
j 60,000 seats. Since then over 10,000
; more seats have been added. The track
was built at a cost of $14,000' extra.
The cost of construction per seat was
! considerably less than that of concrete
j stadiums. The concrete structures cost
from $6.40 to $16.70 per seat to build,
| with the average about $10 per seat.
! On the other hand the Stanford struc
i ture cost only $3.50 per seat.

The name "stadium" was originally j
applied to the foot-race course at,
; Olympia, Greece, where athletic games I
I were celebrated. To ancient Greeks, 1
I the word "stadium" signified also a
measure of distance, namely, the dis
j tance of 606.75 feet between the ter-!
i minal pillars of the Olympia stadium.
Afterwards the word was adopted by
the Romans, eight stadia making a i
Roman mile.
Have Varied Uses
While a stadium is primarily de
signed for athletic competition, it can
; be used and is used for many other
; purposes such as parades, pageants,
drills, meetings, celebrations, and ex-j
hibitions of all kinds. The Los Angeles
Coliseum has even been used to give
Philharmonic concerts and the same
thing is being done in several Eastern
stadiums. In 1925 when the national
Shriners' convention was being held
in Los Angeles, the Coliseum was used
for their programs and pageants with
great success.
Stadium construction is of two types, j
One is of concrete, such as the Univer- j
sity of California stadium, while the
! other is an earthen bowl built up with
wood, as the Stanford stadium. Both
types have their advantages, the con- j
j Crete type probably being the more
permanent, while the wooden is un
doubtedly the more comfortable of the j
two. To overcome the latter disadvan
tage, some stadiums have concrete
j foundations but the seats are con
structed of wood.

on June 1. It cost $210,000 to build
1 the stadium at its original size of j
j 60,000 seats. Since then over 10,000
; more seats have been added. The track
was built at a cost of $14,000' extra.
The cost of construction per seat was

from $6.40 to $16.70 per seat to build,
