# SPORTS OF 1926
## The 						Noblest Row-Man 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Little did the late Hiram Conibear dream that the rowing principles which
he instilled at the University of Washington would some day spread all over
the United States, and that the men who learned and used his "system" at
the great Pacific Northwest, institution would be sought after as coaches by
such universities as Yale, Harvard, and Princeton.
Truly, the Washington stroke is riding the crest of the wave of popular
favor at present, and the rowing principles of a man who never rowed himself,
but who had been a bicycle racer and so knew that the leg is a more powerful
engine than the arm, are now taught by Washington men at the University of
California, at Annapolis, at Pennsylvania,.at Princeton, at Yale, and, of course,
at Washington.
Ed Leader, at Yale, is probably the best of all the disciples of Conibear.
Closely pressing him for the honor is "Rusty" Callow, at Washington, whose
varsity crew hadn't lost a race until the Poughkeepsie regatta last year.
"Cal" Ebright, at the University of California, though beaten by Washington,
will make his initial bow as a coach at the intercollegiate regatta next month.
The three Wshingtonians who are acting as head coaches at Eastern institu
tions for the first time this year are Bob Butler, at Annapolis; "Chuck" Logg
(who was assistant to J. D. Spaeth last year), at Princeton; and Fred Spuhn
(who assisted at Harvard in 1925), at Pennsylvania.
Spaeth, Rice, Wright, Miller —all have gone; the Glendons have moved to
Columbia, and the Washington influence is spreading; When the Father of
our country crossed the Delaware, he must have used an eight-oared shell.
