Senior Cabinet of the Y.W.C.A. met
with the Advisory Board Tuesday eve
ning to hear reports from the dele
gates to the National Convention.
Ethelind Thompson, the president of
the Y.W., gave a summary of the
speeches of the Rev. W. C. Gilkey, the
convention speaker.
Eleanor Davidson gave an account
of the business session, and Elizabeth
Bakewell spoke on the student assem
bly and the international aspects of
the Y.W.C.A. work. Miss Isabel Capps,
secretary, told of her impressions of
the staff conference held immediately
following the regular session. One of
the most interesting facts noticed by
all the delegates to the convention
was the different atitude of the stu
dents and the working girls toward
their problems. The college women
concerned chiefly with the intellectual
difficulties of thinking out their
theories on a campus, while the
women engaged in industry were deal
ing with concrete problems of their
actual experience.
Mrs. J. P. Mitchell, who has been a
member of the advisory board since
1915, with the exception of one year,
and is now resigning, spoke of her
regret at leaving the work, and ap
preciation of her help was expressed
by the members.
