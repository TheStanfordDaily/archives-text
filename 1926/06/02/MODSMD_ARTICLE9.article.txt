# MRS. NEVERS BALKS AT PROPOSED OPTION OF ERNIE TO MINORS
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers recently rejoined the
St. Louis Browns upon their return
home after a disastrous three-and-a
half weeks' tour around the American
League. Nevers did not make this trip
because he refused to travel unless
accompanied by his wife.

The Browns have rule which pro
hibits the wives of the players from
accompanying their husbands on base
ball trips during the regular season.
At the same time, the Browns are
unable to option Nevers to the minors
because of a clause in his contract
which states that they cannot farm
him out without his consent.

A couple of weeks ago Ernie was
all set and willing to be shipped out
to Tulsa of the Western League, but
according to Business Manager Wil
liam Friel of the Browns, Mrs. Nevers
balked at the deal, and the transfer
was called off.

While the Browns were away from
St. Louis, Nevers remained in the city
and worked out every day with the
Cardinals to keep in condition. Now
that his club is back home Ernie will
probably have an opportunity to show
what he can do, as the majority of
the other Brownie pitchers have
failed.
