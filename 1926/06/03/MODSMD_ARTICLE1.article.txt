# 590 APPLICANTS ACCEPTED FOR FALL ENTRANCE
## Successful Candidates Must Maintain Scholastic Standing LIST ONLY PROVISIONAL 1435 High School Students Qualify for Admission To University 
### 
Out of 1435 applicants for admission
to Stanford next fall, who were fully
qualified so far as their scholarship
and recommendations were concerned,
only 590 could he accepted. The re
mainder of these people, 845, received
notification that the quota had been
tilled. However, a few places have
been left for students who may pass
with exceptionally high averages the
general examinations to be given in
various parts of the country late in
the summer.
Up to this year the determination of
successful candidates was made in the
middle of August, after the close of
the school year. Making the decision
earlier ends the suspense of those
who hope to be admitted to Stanford,
and gives those who cannot enter
Stanford time to make other arrange
ments.
With the limit of 500 women stu
dents, there will be 140 places open
next October, and 764 applications
from fully qualified candidates were
received, a ratio of about 7 to 1. Four
hundred and fifty men with less than
two years of college credit can be ad
mitted, and there were 671 qualified
applicants.
All acceptances are conditioned on
the successful students maintaining
through the rest of their preparatory
school course the same high record
that won them this provisional admis
sion, and in passing the intelligence
test which is necessary for final en
rollment. A large proportion of the
candidates have already passed this
examination, which the University
:gave earlier in the year.
