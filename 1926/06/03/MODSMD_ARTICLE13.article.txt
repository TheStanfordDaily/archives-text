# TERMAN TO CONFER WITH STUDY PLAN CANDIDATES
## 
### 
j Professor Lewis M. Terman will be
| in his office in the Psychology depart
ment from 2 to 5 o'clock tomorrow
I afternoon and on Monday and Tuesday
| afternoons of next week to confer with
' students who contemplate registering
i next year under the Independent Study
i Plan.
| The purpose of the Independent
! Study Plan is to give able students an
i opportunity to exercise their own ini
j tiative in their university work and
| to go ahead as fast as they desire,
i without being held to the requirements
of regular class instruction in the or
! dinary classes.
"From the kindergarten to the uni
| versity," says Professor Terman, "we
are coming to recognize that our sys
; tem of mass education tends to con
centrate attention upon the average
and the inferior to the neglect of those
j of exceptional ability. The gifted, be
-1 cause they are not encouraged to forge
ahead, and are rarely required to exert
themselves, fall by degrees into an
intellectual slump.
' "Various methods of reform are
being tried out, but the system of
i honors courses, or independent study
programs, is the one that has found
most favor. This scheme, in one form
or another, is now in operation in
Harvard, Brown, Barnard, Radcliffe,
Swarthmore, Vassar, Smith, Yale,
: Michigan, Wisconsin, and a score or
; more of other institutions throughout
the country. The Independent Study

| Plan was adopted at Stanford a year
j ago and was put into operation at the
: beginning of (he winter quarter. The
, essential features can he stated
; briefly."
j (1) At the beginning of his junior
year, or any quarter thereafter, the
; student of exceptional ability may,
| with the consent of his major depart
ment, enroll under the Independent
Study Plan for the remainder of his
| undergraduate course.
(2) For such student a program of
i work is outlined which is both more
I comprehensive and more intensive
j than that of the average student â€”one
i that calls for more self-direction and
demands a higher type of thinking.
This program of study entirely re
places the usual requirements of units
and courses.
(3) A faculty member of the major
department is appointed to serve as
the student's adviser. He helps outline
the program of study, supervises the
student's work, and from time to time
tests his accomplishment by reports,
theses, and conference discussion.
(4) The student is made entirely re
sponsible for the management or his
time and may attend as many or as
! few lectures as he likes, lie knows,
i however, what he must accomplish by
the time of graduation, and lie knows
that the searching graduation examina
tions will test his ability to organize
I and use knowledge rather than his
ability to take on a huge cargo of
I facts.
