# FOURTEEN BALL PLAYERS MAKE TRIP TO JAPAN
## Wolter Selects Tentative Squad for Tour to Orient WILL LEAVE TUESDAY Several Games Scheduled For First Stopover in Hawaiian Islands 
### 
Fourteen Stanford baseball players
i will leave for a two months' tour of
j
I Japan next Tuesday, according to the
tentative selection announced by
| Coach Harry Wolter.
The squad will be composed of Steve
I Collins, pitcher; John Sobieski, pitch
er; Tod Oviatt, pitcher; Bill Maguire,
first baseman; James Garibaldi, sec
iond baseman; Jimmy Busch, short
istop; Captain Murray Cuddeback.
| third baseman; Tex Weaver, fielder;
Gene Nissen, fielder; Bill Clark, field
er; Hal King, catcher; Jerry Stewart,
fielder; Paddy Draper, first baseman;
I and Clarence Sypher, catcher. Tom
Quinn, senior manager of the ball
team, and Harry Wolter and Mrs.
Wolter will complete the party.
At the last Conference meeting the
case of Tod Oviatt was brought up by
! Professor William B. Owens of the
Law School with the result that Oviatt
| was declared eligible to make the trip,
j This relieves Wolter's problem con
| siderably by giving him another de
pendable pitcher besides "Count"
J Sobieski and Steve Collins, who bore
j the brunt of the hurling for Stanford
all season. All have been taking part
! in workouts twice a week during the
! past month and have struck out the
batters of the army team, who were
I their practice opponents, with encour-
I aging regularitv.
! .
rhe trip is under the auspices of
i Waseda University of Japan. Iso Abe,
director of the Waseda ball team, has
j made arrangements with Tom Quinn,
Stanford manager, for the details of
1 the tour. The nine of the Nipponese
I university is planning a tour of the
United States next year and will prob
ably visit Stanford for a two-game
! series.
The first stop for the squad will be
| at the Hawaiian Islands, where several
j games will be played. While on the
| boat en route to the islands the players
j will take their final examinations,
I which will be sent back to the campus.
In Japan itself twelve games are
1 scheduled, seven in Tokio, and five in
| Osaka. Four additional contests may
be held in Manchuria. The team will
j return to California September 3.
Next Sunday a barbecue will be held
i for the quad, at which the captain for
| the coming year will be chosen.
