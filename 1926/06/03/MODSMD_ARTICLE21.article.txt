# A 						Retreat
## 
### 
An hour or two intermission between classes in the morning, nothing
in particular to study, and no great inclination to join in one of the many
"bull sessions" which are holding forth along the edge of the Quad. This
is the predicament in which a student occasionally finds himself.
Granted, he can amble into the library, procure a book, and read; but
how splendid it would be if a room were provided in the building which
contained only fiction, magazines, and newspapers—not a room hushed
with silence and coldly formal. Rather a small nook with a few comfort
able chairs where he could relax and fully appreciate the contents of the
volume that he is perusing.
The nearest thing to a retreat of this sort in the Stanford library is the
Timothy Hopkins rooms. But it does not fill the bill. It is too austere,
and, although it shelves a few books of a light vein, the majority of its
works are not the type that one would select when one has only an hour or
so to linger.
There is no doubt some nook in the building that could be rearranged
at slight expense, and filled with suitable printed matter; and we predict
that it would be well patronized. Here is a chance for the library to assist
in refuting the statement that the college student is poorly read, and is
ignorant of current world and national happenings.
