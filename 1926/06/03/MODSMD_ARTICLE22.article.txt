# The 						Branner Dining Hall

There has been some interest on the part of the men residing in Bran
ner Hall as to what would be done next year with the Branner dining hall
which has not been used for a year-and-a-half. This morning the Daily
interviewed Comptroller Roth on the subject.
The situation is this. At the time Toyon and Branner were con
structed plans were also made for two smaller dormitoriesâ€”one on the
piece of ground now occupied by the three eating club buildings, and the
other on the site of the Branner parking spaces. As the project got under
way the costs rose, and it was impossible to erect the smaller dwellings.
An attempt was made to run the dining hall; but it was discovered that
there were not sufficient unaffiliated men in the two completed groups to
make the scheme a financial success. Hence it was closed. Had the other
dwellings been completed this action would have been unnecessary.
Another consideration which prompted the University to give up the
dining room was the fact that the Union and Encina were not paying, be
cause of a lack of patronage. But last year these units made a substantial
profit, and this year they are expected to make still more.
Roth at present sees no way out until the projected small buildings are
financed and erected. Then the Branner hall will be assured of patronage
aplenty. Until such a date the club will probably be used for an occasional
dance; but will not perform its original function.
