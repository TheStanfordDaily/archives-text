### 
The announcement that the phonograph record which was made by the
Stanford band is a success and will be released in the near future marks
the close of a very successful year for tbe Stanford musical organization.
The students are all too prone to take the activities of the band as a matter
of fact. We are so accustomed to having the band appear at athletic con
tests that we fail to consider the hours which the organization must spend
rehearsing; but if the band was not on hand there would certainly be a
holler.
May we here render thanks to tbe group, and particularly to Professor
Ernest Whitney Martin who devotes so much time and energy to its con
duct. A record sale of the band's product will be assurance that its efforts
are not unappreciated.
Perhaps roses might give a richer odor. High-class journalism from
the Y News as produced at Brigham Young University:
"Final arrangements are being completed to make the summer quarter at
Brigham Young University finer than ever before. The most recent action to
make for greater richness of courses in the engagement of Mr. Seville Flowers."
Alon/.o B. See, big elevator and cable man from the wilds of New York
City, unburdens his soul for the benefit of posterity. From the Bryn Mawr
College News:
"A child born of a woman who has been to college should be taken from the
mother as soon as possible and placed in some institution where it would be
properly cared for."
Candidness or cattiness? Take your choice. The College News from
Bryn Mawr: '
"In Apology: The College News regrets that a paragraph of Miss King's
discussion in last week's issue of the Art Club's showing was cut by the printer.
However, the criticism contained in the paragraph was all adverse."
