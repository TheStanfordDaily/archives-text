# FORMER STANFORD SWIMMER COACHES CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM
## 
### 
Jim Sparling, '22, has been so suc
cessful as swimming coach of Palo
Alto high school that his squad now
holds the title of champions of the
North Coast section of the California
Interscholastic Federation, which
laurels were won last week at Neptune
Beach. The Paly High paddlers alsp
administered an impressive defeat to
Lowell High, rulers of aquatic circles
in San Francisco for many years.
Sparling was a breast-stroker while
at Stanford and a protege of Coach
Ernst Brandsten. The outstanding
stars of the Paly High team are Lucy,
in the sprints, Huff, in the middle dis
tances, and Smith, diver.
The points by which Palo Alto won
the North Coast meet totaled 48. Other
schools trailed as follows: Alameda 18,
Berkeley 13, Tamalpais 8y 2 .
Huff of Palo Alto made 2:48 in the
220-yard free style and won the 440
in 0:20. R. Lucy copped the 50-yard
free style event in 27 2-5. Wilson of
Palo Alto won the plunge at 61 feet,
and D. Lucy set a new record for the
130-pound class when he traveled the
150-yard free style in 1:44, a full seven
seconds under the old mark.
In dual meets the swimmers de
feated Lowell and Galileo high schools
of San Francisco, besides winning the
last two Peninsula titles by decisive
scores. By taking the measure of
Lowell, Sparling's paddlers showed
real class, for the San Francisco Card
inal mermen have had things all their
own way in Northern California for
years, having taken the San Francisco
city title for the past three decades
without a break.
Palo Alto has acquired the distinc
tion of handing Lowell its first defeat
in a dual swimming meet in the past
31 years. Sparling's team is well bal
anced in the various events and in
Huff, Lucy, and Smith, has at least
three athletes' that should make a
name in aquatics.
