# VANITY FAIR PRIZE WINNER UPHOLDS "BULL SESSIONS"
## 
### 
College "bull sessions" alone keep
alive the noble art of conversation
which has flamed down the ages, is
the contention of Elmer J. Beth, win
ner of the Vanity Fair's College Hu
mor contest, in his article, "The Sopho
moric Salon," published in the June
number of the magazine.
"If it were not for the colleges, con
versation would have vanished com
pletely in the historical limbo of the
mummy, the saloon, the buffalo. In
the college, however, the idle group
still assembles. Here the young men
may come together, reflect, pronounce,
consider, refute. Forsooth, there is
nothing else to do . . . ." declares the
$500' prize winner.
Beth blandly announces to the world
that the subjects of "bull sessions"
are many and varied. "From particu
lar women, the conversation turns to
women in general, thence to codes of
ethics, double standards, free think
ing. the virtues of hedonism, and the
birth rate in Lapland. Mr. Percy
Marks committed an error in scholar
ship in his 'Plastic Age' when he de
clared that conversational sessions are
held only on the subjects of women

I and religion.
"All active sessionists in good stand
' ing are men with lecherous, lascivious
| pasts of adventure. He who has not
I yielded to temptation, or who has not
i at least exposed himself to temptation,
! must either hold his peace and hope
that the discussion will take a scien
| tiflc or religious turn, or he must fabri
! cate a lurid, pa sionate tale of Baccha
nalian carousals, Bohemian abandon,
or underworld burlesque.
"The ordinary young man enters
| college with a meagre foundation of
learning. The average college gradu
ate leaves his Alma Mater with a still
J more meagre foundation of learning.
I But, unless he is stone blind and as
; deaf as a jazz orchestra leader, no
graduate ever leaves college without a
I college education. That is to be had
| in the conversational passages of the
night. There he may decorate the mod
ern practice of the ancient art. In the
truest sense, he will have become a
philosopher."
The author of this expose is a junior
student in the School of Journalism
at the University of Wisconsin and
editor of the "Skyrockets," humor
column of the "Daily Cardinal."
