# DOMONOSKE TO JOIN ENGINEERING SCHOOL FACULTY IN AUTUMN
## 
### 
Arthur B. Domonoske, now a mem
ber of the University of California
faculty and a man with an extremely
varied practical experience in engi
neering, will join the Stanford School
of Engineering next year.
Professor Domonoske graduated
from the University of California in
1907, receiving the degree of Master
of Science there in 1909. He was an
instructor there until 1913, when he
went to the University of Illinois. Dur
ing the war he was back at the Uni
versity of California and taught in the
United States Shipping Board School
for Engineer Officers which was in
operation on its campus. Since 1923 he
has held the title of Associate Profes
sor of Experimental Engineering and
Director of Shops.
Professor Domonoske has inter
spersed his tecaliing with the active
practice of his profession and with
research investigations in the plants
of big manufacturing concerns. In this
way he has become an expert in shop
management, machine and powerhouse
design, in heat power engineering, and
automotive engineering.
His attainments have led to his
membership in a large number of
scientific bodies, including Sigma Xi,
national scientific scholarship society,
thte American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, the Society of Automotive
Engineers, the American Society for
Steel Treating, and the Society for the
