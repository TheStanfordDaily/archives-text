# DRAMA CLASS PLANS PRODUCTION OF FOUR PLAYS WEDNESDAY
## Second Series of One-Act Pieces to Be Given on Friday, June 11 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Four one-act plays, "What If They
Could?" "The Boor," "The Truth," and
"His Voice Is a Whisper," will be pre
sented by the play production class in
the Assembly hall, Wednesday, June
9. Several others will be given Friday,
June 11, at an open session of the
class in the Little Theatre. No admis
sion charge will be made for any of
the productions.
"Shadows of the Glen," which will
be presented Friday, is of Irish origin,
and ably depicts the happy-go-lucky
attitude of the Irish youth. The plot
revolves about the love of a tramp for
a colleen, whose father frowns on the
affair. Cleverly worked out and well
cast, this play should furnish excellent
light comedy.
Sir James Barrie is represented by
his two works, "Rosalind" and "The
Twelve-Pound Look." Subtle charac
terizations, with gentle satire of cus
toms and types, occur in both. Barrie
finds the depths of emotion consistent
ly, mostly through the action rather
than the lines.
"Rosalind" deals with the disallu
sionment of a well-to-do young English
man who is in love with an actress.
Like all comedy, there is a strain of
tragedy running through it, in the
broken dreams of the young man.
In "The Twelve-Pound Look" the
contrast between the comic and tragic
elements is even more strongly
brought out. Success and its effect cn
three people is the theme of the play.
Inner feelings are developed fully and
are revealed suddenly and at unex
pected moments.
"The Judgment of Indra," an East
Indian play, is written by a former
Stanford student, and has been trans
lated from the East Indian language.
It is unusual in its rendition, and
throws a different light on Indian cus
toms from what is most often found
in such foreign plays.
"Brother in Arms" fills out the group
planned for Friday afternoon. By se
lecting plays from all nations, Mrs.
Marion Craig Wentwortli, director of
production, is endeavoring to create a
closer understanding between peoples.
Those directing the plays are Miss
Helen Lewis, Miss Catherine White,
William Thornton, and Alfred Bruce.
