# GRADUATES ASKED TO REGISTER FOR WORK
## 
### 
Those who are graduating this June
are urged to register with the Ap
pointment Office at once so as to
insure prompt attention for any future
needs in the matter of faculty recom-!
mendations, education records, or as-1
sistance in obtaining permanent work. j
Mrs. E. B. Snell, appointment secre- j
tary, in asking for this registration,j
calls attention to the uncertainty of j
which has been experienced in arrang-1
ing for recommendations from profes- i
sors after the student has once left j
the school. The work will be further â– 
facilitated by registration before i
graduation.
