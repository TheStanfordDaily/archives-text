# SOPHOMORES DEFEAT SENIORS IN SECOND CLASS POLO CONTEST
## Vanderburgh's Horse Kicks Goal for Freak Score In Favor of 1928 
### 
Tn the second interclass polo con
! test, when the sophomore aggregation
ran away from the senior four in the
! first two chukkers, to win easily, 7
{to 2, Thompson, with two goals to
I his credit, led'the scoring. Kalile and
i Vanderburgh halved honors for the
; seniors. Tomorrow afternoon the jun
! ior and sophomore teams meet in th< j
| deciding game of the interclass cup
| trophy, given yearly by the Military
i department.
The first score was a freak, result
!ing from a furious rally near the senior
| goal. The ball, emerging from the mud
j die, was kicked through the goal by
Vanderburgh's horse for a sophomore
I score. Thompson, playing No. 4 man,
! showed his versatility by holding out
in the open and recovering the ball
in contrast to his usual fast-shooting
style of play demanded by No. 3 posi
tion. He tallied the second score after
one such rush. Thompson scored once
I more at the end of the period.
The last period was more senior
j than sophomore, since two senior
j goals were tallied. Fast riding by
j Baker and Vanderburgh after the ball
i had been hit in out of bounds put
| the sphere in scoring position, and
j Kahle tallied. Following this, on a
foul by Thompson, Vanderburgh scored
with his free shot.
The majority of sophomore scores
came because of the tendency of the
senior squad to leave Thompson un
i guarded. Baker and Vanderburgh
starred throughout the game for the
upperclassmen, while Thompson and
Weymouth played well for 1928.
The line-up was as follows: Seniors,
J No. 1, Ross; No. 2, Vanderburgh; No.
3, Baker; No. 4, Beckwith. Substitutes,
j Kahle for Beckwith. Sophomores, No.
1, Austin; No. 2, Weymouth; No. 3,
I Triest; No. 4, Thompson. Substitute,
j Connolly for Triest.
