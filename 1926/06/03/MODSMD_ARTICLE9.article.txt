# "MEET THE WIFE" SETTING ACHIEVES REALISTIC EFFECT
## ONLY ONE SCENE USED Kilers Able to Avoid Mere Suggestion in Erecting Drawing Room 
### 
An attractive set is being prepared
by Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Kiler for the
Senior Farce, "Meet the Wife," which
is to be given Wednesday, June 16. All
the action of the play is in one room,
and this allows the stage workers to
experiment with design and decoration
much more than if

a there* were several
| changes. Usually
I they have had to
; do the work by
I suggestion, using
j| lighting effects and
I painted scenery in
I such a way as to
3 produce solidity
! and background,
I but with only the
I one set to prepare
I it has been possi
ble to build a draw
r ing room almost as
if it were actually

being put into a house.
The construction is solid and will
be a change for campus theatregoers.
Leslie Kiler is doing the construction
part of the set, and is experimenting
with realism, instead of "the sugges
tive work he usually finds it neces
sary to do.
The drawing room is that of an ex
tremely wealthy New Yorker, and is
furnished in the most resplendent
fashion. Mrs. Kiler has charge of the
detail in furnishing. She is doing the
room in the same manner an interior
decorator .would take over a fc >use to
decorate.
