# DAVIS PLEASED WITH CAST OF SENIOR FARCE
## Adelaide Kelly Is Cast in First Dramatic Role Since Milestones DELMER DAVES HAS ROLE Production Predicted to Be Funniest on Campus In Past Year 
### Frank Baker 
Gordon Davis states that he is ex
tremely well pleased with the way the
east for "Meet the Wife," the Senior
Farce to be presented Wednesday,
June It], has worked into the comedy
spirit of the play.
The show is dependent on the spon
taniety and action of the cast in their
respective roles, and Daves believes

he has an idealj
group in this re- j
spect, having rep- 1
resentatives from j
almost all types
on the campus.
Representing the !
"old guard" is j
Del m e r Daves, ;
who made his de- i
but in the sopho-'
more play of 1923, !
"Captain Apple- j
jack." Since then j
he has distin- j
guished himself j
in many parts, j

notably that of Alquist in "R.U.R.," j
and the main role in Macbeth. He was j
also in "So This Is Eden," "Ray, Ray, ;
Rover Boys," and "Hell Bent Fer!
Heaven," besides taking part in many j
■diort skits *fn track and football shows, j
He was the director of last year's
Junior Opera, "Ace High."
Miss Nauman's Career
Patrice Nauman started her campus j
career in "Milestones," and followed j
with a splendid presentation of thej
part of Lady Macduff in "Macbeth" i
last year. She will be remembered as i
Mrs. Tiffany, of "Fashion," this year's
Masquers play. As Mrs. Harvey Len- i
nox in "Meet the Wife," Miss Nauman
is handling the biggest female part ■
since "Dulcy." New York critics have
characterized the part as portrayed in
its initial performance by Mary
Boland, as a middle-aged Dulcy.
Mrs. Lennox is a flighty female, but i
has a mind of her own. She finds her- j
self confronted with the problem of I
having two husbands, and what she ;
does to straighten out the tangle is j
the plot of the play.
Adelaide Kelly, who is better known J
•on the campus as a dancer than as!
an actress, is making her first appear- j
ance in an important role since she j
played in "Milestones," in which she
made her debut at the same time as
Miss Nauman. Miss Kelly has the part
of a charming young woman in "Meet
the Wife," and is adding good comedy,
with life and color, to a splendid per
sonality.
Dramatic Finds
Of the dramatic finds of the past i
year are Wayne Newcomb, Hal;
Boomer, and Sam Hayes. Newcomb I
first appeared last summer in "Hell
Bent Fer Heaven," and "The Roman
cers." He ably portrayed the part of I
Sid in the former play. Boomer shows ,
versatility in jumping from a negro i
part sulh as he had in "Fashion" to
the role of esthetic poet in "Meet the
Wife." Sam Hayes will be remembered
as the young British officer in "The j
Green Goddess."
Virginia Greene and George Mott
are making their initial appearance at j
Stanford, and round out what is con- j
sidered by those who have seen the |
late rehearsals, one of the best com- ■
edy casts the campus has had. Surely {
the play will be the most laughter- ■
provoking of the year.
