i Prom all preliminary indications, the
total of summer quarter registrations
; and that of Stanford students who will
continue their work through the sum
j iner will be larger than ever before.
John A. Sellards, director of the sum
j mer quarter, is confident that the stu
l dent body will number at least 1500.
The number of registrations in dor
! mitories and the total of fraternity
| houses which will be kept open during
j the coming summer indicate a consid
erable increase in the attendance of
regular undergraduate students. Last
j summer about 48 per cent of those in
j attendance were graduate students,
< and Sellards predicts that the propor
! tion will be much larger this year.
Plays Scheduled
Three plays under the direction of
Gordon Davis have been planned for
! the summer quarter. These produc
tions, which have been scheduled for
j July 9, 30, and August 13 will be pre
! sented in the Assembly hall.
"Aren't We All?" is the first play
■ of the quarter and will be given on
July 9. The stage success was written
by Frederick Lonsdale, the eminent
j English playwright whose modern
