# JEFFERSON WHEN WRONG TREMBLED, A VERS JORDAN
## 
### 
"Thomas Jefferson trembled only
when he did something that he thought
was wrong," declared Dr. Jordan last
evening. "He always remembered that
God was just. He was one of the most
influential men in the colonies, before
he was president, while he was presi
dent, and after he had finished his
term of office."
"Why Jefferson Trembled" was the
subject of Dr. Jordan's lecture.
He Never Gambled
"Jefferson was an affectionate man,"
said Dr. Jordan. "He loved his family
and his friends. He was fond of horse
racing, but he never gambled. He was
one of the colonies' greatest lawyers,
although he never argued any of his
cases. His voice was weak, but he was
a great jurist and he convinced many
people through his writings.
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declara
tion of Independence. He w T anted this
used as his epitaph together with the
fact that he was responsible for the
abolition of the established church in
Virginia and that he was the father
of the University of Virginia.
Jefferson hated war above all things;
he hated militarism; he hated pomp.
It is said, for instance, that he walked
down to the capital to be inaugurated.
He tried to get general education es
tablished in the United States.
Jefferson was one of Virginia's great
est men. He was set against slavery,

! advocating that the government buy
all of the slaves and export them. He
claimed that this would be only a
; mere bagatelle to what they would
I cost the Union if they were not gotten
rid of. He foresaw the Civil War.
Dr. Jordan said: "A great many re
j forms come into the world when they
are turned from a political question
into a moral one. This was what hap
t pened in the case of slavery, for the
j South did not want to fight over the
, question, and neither did the North,
until it was removed from the realm
; of politics and placed in the field of
I morality. Then both sides thought
they must fight.
Favored Democracy
"Hamilton and Jefferson were two
great opposing forces in the Cabinet.
| Hamilton favored a strong, centralized
! government, with a protective tariff
for infant industries, the control of all,
however, being placed in the hands of
only a few. Jefferson stood always for
democracy. He opposed aristocracy in
all forms. He claimed that no fair and
I real government could be had unless
it was based upon democracy."
Jefferson was a true Christian in
every sense of the word, though a
: statement of his, printed near his
j death, led many to believe the con
i trary. But he said, "I am a Christian
i in the only sense that Jesus wanted
| anyone to be a Christian."
