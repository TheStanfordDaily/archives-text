# STANFORD SWIMMERS PREPARE FOR FINAL CONTEST OF SEASON
## Cardinal Mermen Will Enter Meet at Olympic Club Unattached 
### Herb Klein 
Stanford swimmers are taking daily
workouts at Encina Pool in prepara
tion for the open swimming meet to
be held by the Olympic Club the eve
ning of June 13. The Card mermen
to compete will enter unattached since
the races are on a Sunday and they
are therefore prohibited from swim
ming under the Cardinal colors.
There will be a race for every style
of swimming, breaststroke, backstroke,
and crawl, and a diving competition
for the Robert A. Smith trophy. The
three swimming events are expected
to attract the best talent in the dis
trict.
West vs. Littlefield
Two of Ernst Brandsten's paddlers
are scheduled to start in the 220-yard
breaststroke and should make the race
hot for each other as well as the rest
of the field. Judging by the way Cece
West and Skipper Littlefield, Cardinal
sailor style stars, have been kicking
their away along in practice, the audi
ence at the Olympic Club has a good
chance of seeing the furlong negoti
ated close to 3:04 or 3:05.
Ted Smith is entered in the 150-yard
backstroke and will probably have
some stiff competition in the form of
Mitchell and other Olympic Club stars
who can ramble in the upside down
position almost as fast as any other
way. Smith is in condition and has
made 1:53 in practice without forcing
himself.
Carl Stevenson. 220- and 440-
yard star, will compete in the open
220 free style at the Olympic Club. He
has been in strict training and has
turned in 2:28 already with time as
his only opponent. Lester Smith, holder
of the present Pacific Coast record in
the free style furlong, will swim for
the Club team.
The high fancy diving competition
will settle a score between Guerton
Carroll, the Winged O's best spring
board artist, and Dave Fall, Cardinal
diving ace. Each of the two have cap
tured one event of the two which have
been held to determine the winner of
the Robert A. Smith trophy. The high
diving will decide who the future
owner of the cup will be. Fall has a
decided advantage over Carroll on the
high board and should take the trophy.
