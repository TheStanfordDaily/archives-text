Now that Phi Beta Kappa has elected members the editor has run
across a consoling bit of information for "sour grapers." A psychology
professor at the University of Michigan has made a survey and has dis
covered that ten years after graduation the Phi Betes were only averaging
$3,000 a year, and that those whom he terms "glad handers" were raking
in an average of $10,000 per annum after the same period of time. All of
which will probably cause a great thumbing of noses at the key-wearers,
and a general desertion of the books.
But the Phi Betes are probably no more alarmed than we are. Earning
power is only a partial estimate of an individual's worth, and on final
analysis the real value of education is the satisfaction which it gives the
educated. We are preparing to live—to live happily. The "glad bander"
may find happiness in an income of $10,000 a year, while the Phi Beta
Kappa may be content with a considerably smaller revenue and the per
sonal satisfaction which he derives from being a well educated man.
As Abraham Lincoln once remarked, "For those who like that sort of
thing, that's the sort of thing they like." Congratulations, Phi Betes!
Congratulations, glad handers!
