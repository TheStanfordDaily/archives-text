# The
						Last Appearance
## 
### 
With the last turn of the press Monday, the Daily Palo Alto passes
from existence to give way next Fall to The Stanford. Daily. Ihe staff
members vacate the office and turn their attention to long neglected books
in preparation for final examinations.
Anyone who wishes an announcement printed, or who wishes to take
a parting poke at the present editorial board, had better hurry. It is posi
tively our last appearance.
The Y.M.C.A. points the way out. The Wesleyan Argus:
"A moving picturc entitled 'Hell and the Way Out,' will he shown in Fayer
weather Gymnasium on Monday evening under the auspiccs of the Middletown
League of Nations Association and the Young Men's Christian Association."
Another party goes smash. The Wesleyan Argus:
"It is absolutely imperative that the debt resulting from the Junior Prom be
paid at once."
