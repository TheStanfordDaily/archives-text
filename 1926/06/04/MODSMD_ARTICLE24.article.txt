From his travels for more than
thirty years into all parts of the earth, |
Dr. Douglas H. Campbell, professor j
of botany at Stanford from its open-1
ing until his retirement last year, has
written an "Outline of Plant Geogra- j
phy." This volume of 392 pagqs, pub- j
lished by Macmillan is not only a I
manual for scientists and scholars, but j
is as well a book of value and intense i

interest for the general reader.
About most of the places he de
scribes Dr. Campbell is able to write j
as a visitor and eye-witness, and what
he saw was not scientific facts alone ;
but humanly interesting and beautiful |
features of the world. Even the larger j
part of the book, which comprises a
minutely detailed presentation of the
botanical characteristics of all tlie
zones, continents, and countries of the
earth, arranged for easy reference for
botanical students, is illuminated by
descriptions and observations which
are the work of the artist in the au
thor rather than of the "pure" scien- 1
tist. This feature of the volume is en
hanced by more than 150 photographs,
most of them taken by Dr. Campbell !
himself. j
The scholarly validity of the book is
vouched for by Dr. Campbell's reputa
tion and by other volumes of which
he is the author. Its attractive quali
ties for the non-scientific reader is the
natural outcome of Dr. Campbell's per- j
sonality. He is a landscape artist of
very considerable ability and his ap- j
preciative eye is shown in this book.
Dr. Campbell modestly refers to him
self as a sort of amateur in this par
ticular field of plant geography. He is
an "amateur" only in so far as this
branch of interest is one that has ap- j
pealed to him during the last decade
i

or so, whereas in his narrower special
field he has been studying for a good i
deal longer. Nevertheless in this field !
of plant geography he has made con- i
tributions to science that have given I
him a high reputation in it altogether
apart from his reputation in other di
rections.
The parts of the book that will par- I
ticularly appeal to the general reader ;
are the passages in which he traces
the development of plant life on the i
earth and the evidences through this
development and present distribution
of the changes by which the land areas
of the earth today have come to their
present forms. The introduction is es
sentially a popular treatise on this sub
ject, and there are passages through
out the book which illuminate it.
