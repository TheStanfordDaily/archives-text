"PATSY"—CURRAN THEATRE
"Patsy," the brilliant musical com
' edy now playing at the Curran Theatre
i in San Francisco, is really the best
production of its kind that has visited
■ this part of the country this season,
j "Lady Be Good" and "No, No, Nan-
I nette" both received a big hand and
I a lot of support, but this production
! seems to have them all cheated.
Lou Holtz, the scintillating come
dian, is the center of all the good
j clean fun. He gets off a lot of fast
wheezes and at times tinges on the j
personal, keeping the audience up on j
! its toes.
The "Tiger Eyes" number led by j
Gloria Foy, the star of the Patsy j
Company, is the big hit of the show. I
And the Russian number led by the |
■ trio is excellent. In fact, the music j
throughout the performance is good I
and above the average of the shows j
that caravan over the mountains and :
! plains to the coast. —R.I.A.
