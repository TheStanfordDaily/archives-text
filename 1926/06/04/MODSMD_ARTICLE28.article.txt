## THE 						TRUE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF GARLIC 
### Steve O'Donnell Professor Veto 
The term garlic is derived from the Latin word garlicus which was tlie
slogan of the first manufacturers of Blisterine (Romus and Remus) who
started their trade in Rome in the year 1492 B.C.
The plant was first brought to America in 1492 A.I). by a European trader
and manufacturer of Blisterine who wished to introduce his product in this
country. The result was deliterious upon the natives. Many refused to use
Blisterine after eating garlic, consequently many families were broken up.
In 1620' the first Chinese settlers in America planted a bed of garlic
around the Plymouth rock thus effectually keeping away the Indians for a
time; but finally a resourceful redskin chieftain made effective use of a bottle
of Blisterine and came near annihilating the settlers.
Later on Dred Scott made his famous decision which was that he would
not eat another piece of garlic for the rest of his days. This brought on the
Civil War as a result of the overproduction of garlic in the country.
In 1896 a group of men realizing that garlic among friends was a perfectly
safe proposition formed a garlic eaters' union with the motto, "garlic for
one and all."
It was recently reported that garlic has been introduced at the North
Pole and has proved an effective means of breaking the ice when taken in
sufficint amounts. However, it is believed that the Blisterine Company has
already dispatched a shipment of their anti-garlic compound to that part
of the world.
Taken all in all I am strong for garlic but "where there is garlic, let
there be Blisterine."
