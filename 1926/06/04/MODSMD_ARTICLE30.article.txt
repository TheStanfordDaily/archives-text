# ORIGIN OF FOOTBALL DATES BACK TO AGES UNKNOWN IN HISTORY

### Gordon French 
Football, like the majority of sports
common in the world today, has a rec
ord that stretches back so far into
antiquity that its origin is lost in
obscurity. Delving into the past re
veals the fact that the game was more
truly a football game the further back
one traces it, with its latest develop
ment, American football, only secon
darily a football game. More and more
is the contest shifting away from the
use of the feet.
A very crude type of football was
organized in Greece and spread
throughout the Roman empire when
it dominated the civilized world. In
those days no limit was placed on
the number of players on each side
•with a resulting great variation in the
&ize of the gridiron. Harpaster, as it
was called, seems to have been, at
times, little more than an organized
gang fight. A Roman document writ
ten by Julius Pollux, says: "The play
ers divided into two bands. The ball
was placed upon a line between them.
At the two ends of the field, behind
the line upon which the players were
stationed, were two other lines beyond
which the two bands strove to carry
the ball."
Besides the evidences of the an
tiquity of football in the civilized
world, several remote nationalities
have originated or at least adopted a
type of football. The Eskimo played
with a ball filled with moss, while the
Polynesian Islanders used a ball made
of bamboo fibers. But its chief home,
where it was most popular and de
veloped most, was the British Isles.
The first documental evidence of foot
ball in England that has been un
covered, is in 1175.
It soon swept the country and be
came so popular that archery was neg
lected, with a result that several kings
passed laws against it. Later it was
revived and Shrove Tuesday was set
aside as football day, but again it got ■
into difficulties and was suppressed,;
this time for excessive roughness.
Football was first played between i
California and Stanford in 1892 with i
the Blue and Gold losing 14 to 10. In j
1905, with Stanford having the edge !
in victories, it was decided to abandon ■
football for rugby. In rugby the rivals
competed with almost equal success
until the war. In 1920 the revised
American game was adopted with a
resulting string of California victories ;
until the tie of 1924 and the Stanford j
win of 1925.
Baseball is the most popular sport j
among the women at Ohio State Uni-I
versity. Tennis, dancing, archery, and;
track follow.

was placed upon a line between them.

the line upon which the players were
stationed, were two other lines beyond

Football, like the majority of sports
common in the world today, has a rec
ord that stretches back so far into
antiquity that its origin is lost in
obscurity. Delving into the past re
veals the fact that the game was more
truly a football game the further back
one traces it, with its latest develop
ment, American football, only secon
darily a football game. More and more
is the contest shifting away from the
use of the feet.
A very crude type of football was
organized in Greece and spread
throughout the Roman empire when
it dominated the civilized world. In
those days no limit was placed on
the number of players on each side
•with a resulting great variation in the
&ize of the gridiron. Harpaster, as it
