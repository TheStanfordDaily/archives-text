# G. Corby, '22, Performing Experiments With Radio
## 
### 
Experiments on the breaking down i
of quartz used in crystal-controlled !
j transmission radio sets are being made
1 in his Menlo Park laboratory by Grant !
! Corby, '22, who is attempting to de- j
! velop a method of preserving or restor- j
| ing the mineral for radio use after it j
I lias become "dead."
I
Corby, who is a petroleum geologist
! of the Marland Oil Company, is trying
| to determine what structural changes
I have been made in the quartz which
produce the "breaking down," and also
to find a way of restoring the mineral j
! to its previous state.
Using an amateur 40-meter wave- j
length, he has succeeded in establish- |
ing communication with Brazil and
! Chile.
