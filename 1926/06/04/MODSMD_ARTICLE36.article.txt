# G. Corby, '22, Performing Experiments With Radio
## 
### 
Experiments on the breaking down
of quartz used in crystal-controlled
transmission radio sets are being made
in his Menlo Park laboratory by Grant
Corby, '22, who is attempting to de-
velop a method of preserving or restor-
ing the mineral for radio use after it
has become "dead."

Corby, who is a petroleum geologist
of the Marland Oil Company, is trying
to determine what structural changes
have been made in the quartz which
produce the "breaking down," and also
to find a way of restoring the mineral
to its previous state.
Using an amateur 40-meter wave-
length, he has succeeded in establish-
ing communication with Brazil and
Chile.
