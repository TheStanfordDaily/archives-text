# Play Production Class To Present One-Act Dramas
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Play-lovers will be treated to a
series of excellent productions Wed
nesday night in the Assembly hall,
when the English 19b play production
class will give "The Truth," "The
Boor," "His Voice Is a Whisper," and
"What If They Could?" No admission
charge will be made for the plays,
which are given as part of the quar
ter's work in the class in play produc
tion. Another series will be put on
Friday at the Little Theatre at 2
o'clock.
Chief among these plays is "What
If They Could?" a radio whimsy by
Mrs. Marion Craig Wentworth, instruc
tor in the class. Mrs. Wentworth is a
nationally-known playwright and
teacher of voice interpretation. Her
psychic treatment of the future as
developed by this play shows a deep
insight and a clear vision of human
possibilities.
The work of the greatest Spanish
dramatist, probably the greatest liv
ing dramatist in the world, "The
Truth," with Lloyd Nolan and Aileene
Burks, is a play of real life, done with
all the subtlety at his command. It
presents a new angle on life problems,
quiet and intense, with a good deal of
wisdom. Benavente has been called
the Bernard Shaw of Spain, although
he shows a depth of feeling and a
heart wisdom, never found in Shaw.
"His Voice Is a Whisper" comes
from the American Indian tribal
masques, and reveals the innate poetry
of the Indian language. The transla
tion by Alexander is excellent, and
carries the imagery and spiritual ten
dencies of the Indians with lovely
touches. It is made doubly effective by
the drum and flute music of Indian
origin which accompanies the piece
throughout. Mystic atmosphere and
native dancing build the plot to the
climax at the end.
The quartet of plays is completed
with "The Boor," a Russian presenta
tion. Fiery temper intermingled with
sudden changes of heart bring forth
the rich humor of this play. The Rus
sian lady in seclusion, burst in upon
by the boor, demanding money, and
the consequent result, furnishes some
excellent comedy.
