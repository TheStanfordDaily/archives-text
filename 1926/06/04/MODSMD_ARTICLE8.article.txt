# SENIOR WOMEN HEAR STANFORD GRADUATE DISCUSS CO-EDUCATION
## 
### 
The purposes and organization of
the American Association of Univer
sity Women were explained to the
senior women by Mrs. Frederick
Faulkner (Hazel Padler, '06) yester
day afternoon in the Clubhouse. Mrs.
Faulkner stressed the international
side of the association in her talk.
The association has its headquarters
in Washington, D.C., and has centers
in Europe at Paris and London. As a
national organization it maintains a
number of scholarships for under
graduate women students, and eleven
for graduates. It is divided into dis
tricts, in which the local organisations
are grouped. Stanford is in the Pacific
district.
"Further extension of co-education
is one of the great aims of the associa
tion," Mrs. Faulkner said. "Harvard is
now the last of the larger universities
to bar women."
The association also gives women
an opportunity to keep in touch with
their university or college after they
graduate, and helps them to work with
women from other universities in the
communities in which they live.
Dean Mary Yost entertained the
senior women at a garden party at
her home after Mrs. Faulkner's talk.
