A Life
Underwriter?
One who executes and delivers
a life insurance policy. In
other words, a person wnose
business it is to offer the
known benefits of life insur
ance to individuals, to corpor
ations, to partnerships, etc.
But further, the life under*
writer is one who must con*
vince those clients of the
benefits offered. This means
stimulating contact with hu
man character, and with large
i affairs. Some underwriters
> prefer the game of character
: and deal mainly with indi
viduals. Others prefer affairs;
\ to them is open the great field
of business insurance.
Furthermore, the business of
life underwriting pays highly
for initiative and abikty.
. And still more, the life under
writer offers to his client a
commodity which has no risk
in it, does not deteriorate, and
adds no burden of mental
worry. The life underwriter \
sells absolute security, the
foundationofserenityofmind.
j It is worth while to think
these things over now and to
remember them when, per
haps, you find yourself wrong'
ly placed in whatever business
you may have chosen.
