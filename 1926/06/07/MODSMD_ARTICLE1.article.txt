### 
Choosing "Art and Life" as his topic,
Professor Edward M. Hulme of the
History department will deliver the
last Tuesday evening lecture of the
quarter in the Little Theatre at 7:30'
o'clock tomorrow night.
In the preface of his speech Profes
sor Hulme will speak of the meaning
of art, its interest, and its significance.
In outlining his lecture Professor
Hulme said in a recent interview, "The
fascination and the vitality of art arise
from the fact that it is the best reve
lation of life that we have. A work of
art can tell us three things about the
life that produced it.
"It can reveal to us the spirit of the
age in which it was created. Every
age has its own mental temper, its
own spiritual conditions; and in order
to give voice to these things, it must |
of necessity develop its own tongue. |
Every artist feels the pervading spirit j
of his age.
Art Reveals Spirit of Nation I
"A work of art can reveal to us the ;
spirit of the nation in which itl was J
created. Velasquez breathed iuto every |
stroke of his brush the spirit of Spain. |
Gainsborough, in all his variety, with
his homely richness, speaks of Eng- j
land. Rembrandt translated even bibli- j
cal scenes into terms of Dutch life, j
Moliere could not have been English; j
and Shelley could not have been j
French.
"The third things which a work of j
art can tell us is the spirit of the indi- j
vidual who created it. Personality is i
the most inscrutable of all mysteries. I
Its secret has long been sought, but |
never found. No two persons are alike. !
Everyone is unique. Men reveal what!
they are in their gestures, their looks,
and the tones of their voices. Above
all else, they reveal themselves in art.
"When we learn these three things !
from art, we can live a thousand lives '
other than our own. We can live in i
every civilized century in every land, j
and with every great man who has I
written, or carved, or painted, or com- j
posed. We can live life vicariously."j
