### Lynn Bramkamp 
After the presentation of four one
' act plays Wednesday evening at 8
! o'clock in the Assembly hall, the work
j of the play production class, English
I 19b, will come to a close with five
more plays at 2 o'clock Friday after
| noon in the Little Theatre. Plays from
: all nations are being produced, in
| accordance with the plans of Mrs.
Marion Craig Wentworth, class direc
| tor.
Work in the class has emphasized
dramatization and characterization
j with the minimum of effort directed
; toward scenery and light effects. Parts
i have been selected with an object of
casting all the class members rather
than finding particular types for any
j place. Several of the class members
I in the first series of plays developed
' excellent possibilities.

|to be put on, is "The Boor," with
George Bogue as Swernor, the boister
ous, boorish hero, Helen Cooper as

! boor, and Harris Skelton as the ser
i vant.
"The Truth," a Spanish playlet,
brings Lloyd Nolan to the front again
with a distinctive new role, that of a
Spanish gentleman. Much of the force

which Nolan possesses. Aileene Burks
plays ttye part of Luiva in an excellent
: ljialiner. Herbert Boomer is the ser-
J vant.
"What If They Could?" a radio

1 wliose ideas of propriety are shocked
sby the modern generation. Helen
Lewis as Aunt Sara adds charm with
i her personality. The leading feminine
role is taken by Julia North, that of
i Astrea, who possesses, along with
| David Stollery, as Larry, certain
i psychic powers. Some effects of this
j power are shown by the love of Eileen
'and Sammy, portrayed by Dorothy
Quinn, and C. William Hartsough, re
! spectively.

An Indian play, "His Voice Is a
\ Whisper," completes the four. Robert
jSyer takes the double role of His Voice

more plays at 2 o'clock Friday after

j with the minimum of effort directed
; toward scenery and light effects. Parts
i have been selected with an object of
casting all the class members rather

j place. Several of the class members
I in the first series of plays developed

J vant.

i Astrea, who possesses, along with

'and Sammy, portrayed by Dorothy
Quinn, and C. William Hartsough, re
! spectively.

An Indian play, "His Voice Is a
\ Whisper," completes the four. Robert
jSyer takes the double role of His Voice
