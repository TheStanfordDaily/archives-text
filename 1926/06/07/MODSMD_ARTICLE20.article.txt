### Frank Baker 
Seat sale for the Senior Farce,
"Meet the Wife," to be given Wednes
day night, June 16, will open tomorrow
at 1 o'clock in the offices of the
A.A.U. in the Old Union. Prices are
75 cents and $1.
Gordon Davis considers this to be
the funniest Senior Farce he has ever
directed. The sen-

ior show, he be
lieves, should be
light and laugh-in
spiring, in order to
furnish a contrast
and let-down from
the last strenuous
week of finals, and
"Meet The Wife,"
when he saw it in
the East last sea
son, impressed him
as the sort of play
needed. He has

been trying to get
the rights for it for

some time, but its popularity in the
East made that impossible until the
present.
The play ran for some time on
Broadway, with Mary Boland playing
the title role of Mrs. Lennox. The
part is being portrayed by Patrice
Nauman here. It met with such suc
cess in NeAV York that the stock com
panies are taking the show up all over
the country.
Cast Complete
When the Senior Farce was first
introduced as an annual event on the
campus and for some time thereafter,
there were very few who stayed to
see it, but gradually, because of the
fact that it is usually the most com
ical show of the year, and because it
usually has an experienced cast,. it
has grown in popularity. The audi
ences the last few years have in
creased in size and enthusiasm.
The cast Davis has finally arranged
after a few minor changes, is one that
has had a great deal of experience,
and one that enters into the spirit of
comedy so necessary to the light,
farcical air carried throughout the
play.
The complete cast is as follows:
Mrs. Harvey Lennox. Patrice Nauman
Harvey Lennox Delmer Daves
Victor Staunton Adelaide Kelly
Philip Lord Sam Hayes
Gregory Smith Wayne Newcomb
Alice Virginia Greene
Wijliam George Mott, Jr.
