For the text of the farewell editorial of Volume 69, the last volume of
lhe Daily Palo Alto, the editor is indebted to a recent issue of the
Nation, and more particularly to an article contained therein, written by
Norman Studer, the news editor of the New Student and the managing
editor of the City College Student. By way of introduction Studer says,
"Undergraduate journalism is not the pale growth of a few years ago. A
new and healthy spirit is manifest in many college papers. No subject is
now taboo that affects the interest of the learners and no college official
is immune from criticism and publicity."
Later Studer makes the claim that undergraduate papers fall into two
groups; the bulletin boards and the journals of opinion; and as he de
velops his article he shows plainly that for the former he has no respect,
while he is heartily in favor of the journals of opinion. He cites several
instances which he believes significant in the development of college jour
nalism, some of which were successful, others which fell flat because of
faculty interference. Throughout the entire article he consciously, or un
consciously, builds up the idea that university officials are tyranically at
tempting to gag student opinion, and that the successful paper is the one
which defies the prohibition.
How many of his citations are significant, the Daily can only guess.
To state that an editor is dismissed from college because he condemns com
pulsory chapel is not sufficient. Nine times out of ten the presentation is
more responsible for the discipline than the subject matter. A campaign
can be conducted decently or it can be conducted indecently. Then too
many of the publications which he mentions are comics or literary maga
zines, not newspapers.
In this whole so-called movement of student opinion there is some
ilanger; or, at least, it so appears to one familiar with the conditions at
Stanford; and the editor has risked having his brain child classified "as
goodness knows what" by maintaining a cautious policy of criticism, and
attempting to be constructive rather than destructive. No administrative
"gag rules" have prompted this course; but rather the firm conviction that
a slow development of opinion is the soundest one, that propaganda and
journalism are widely separated fields, and that Stanford is in no need of
a sweeping reform or an overly aggressive paper. At different times
changes have been suggested and the criticism has been taken in good faith.
The students are given practically all the power they desire in the Uni
versity's conduct. It has been the Daily's policy not to mould opinion;
but to encourage the student to form an opinion, or in other words to
think. The editor has favored issues which have proved unpopular; but
in their defeat he has seen a paradoxical victory.
And here "swang song" is brought to a close, pausing only long enough
to give thanks to those who have aided so greatly in the preparation of the
paper. The campus will later hear more of Harry Bennett. Before
actually assuming the position as editor of The Stanford Daily he has put
across a scheme which has been the ambition of every editor â€”the publica
tion of a morning paper. As the last managing editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, he has done more than perform the duties to which he has been as
signed. To Douglas Meservey, the editor is indebted for a large portion
of the editorials which have appeared in this column, and to Alfred Post
for capable work as a news staff executive. Florence Gallagher, the I
women's editor, besides efficiently supervising the work of the women news j
gatherers, has assisted materially in organizing the group of news editors i
and reporters, who, fortunately for Bennett, will all return next Fall to j
prepare the first issue of lhe Stanford Daily. Lastly, the editor wishes to
thank Professor Everett W. Smith of the journalism division for his close i
co-operation and his valuable counsel.
