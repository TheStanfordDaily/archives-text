# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
THE PARTING SHOT
On this day the Daily Palo Alto, generally and rightly known to the
reading public of the Campus as the "Dippy," hut assiduously referred to by
members of the staff, under peril of demotion, as the "Daily," publishes its
last set of advertisements, fillers, and exchanges. We therefore consider it
nothing but proper that we take it upon ourselves to give credit where it is
due, and we hope that the cabbages and other things thrown from this column
will be received with open minds and open arms.

Contrary to popular belief our editor has had nothing to do with this
paper whatever except to come around occasionally and bother the staff by
giving advice and to write tillers for the editorial column when the business
department couldn't find enough advertisements to fill the space. After hours
of persuasion we have at least induced him to put a sample of his creation
in this column:
The Editorial
Patronize Daily Palo Alto advertisers; they bring results.

The women's editor, like the editor (himself), does not write editorials.
In fact we can find very little to blame upon her except the pink atrocity
which recently cluttered up campus ash cans. Besides this she also causes
trouble occasionally by rating the staff. Finally, we are certain that if the 500
did not have an official representative on the paper in the person of the
women's editor, nothing short of a breakdown of the press could save them
from over-publicity.

Unfortunately, but as is generally the case, the managing editor will be
the editor of the paper next autumn. If the staff did not have him to make
all their mistakes for them we do not know what would become of this paper.
It is claimed by some that the managing editor once got the right set of
headlines on a news story, but aside from this mistake his career has been
marked by an unbroken series of errors. It is also generally believed that
if there were no managing editor the paper could go to press on time
every day.

We are extremely thankful for a business manager because the news staff
and the printers can rest for several hours each day just before the paper
goes to press while they are waiting for the business department to bring in
the advertisements. We are also thankful to the manager for the auto page
which has proven a great aid to campus queeners by its helpful suggestions
such as: "When the car stops, look in the gasoline tank," and, "Always lock
the car before getting out to push."

The desk editors have sometimes helped in putting out the paper. Aside
from the fact that they have at times neglected to "blue pencil" the most
interesting portions of news stories they have done their work quite efficiently.
Many of the extraordinary headlines which appear in the paper are the brain
children (probably during a brain storm) of the desk editors.
* * * *
Some of the members of the staff have written news stories this year, but
aside from this they have been careful to see that all news has been kept out
of the hands of the avaricious desk editors. Furthermore, if it were not for
the staff, the desk editors would have nothing to worry about except the editor,
managing editor, and linotypist. One member was on the staff of a high school
paper for nearly two weeks. Only five do not know what a typewriter is.
* * * *
Not unworthy of mention is our linotypist, Oliver (not Oliver Cromwell),
the bane of the desk editors' existence. What with shouting for more copy and
making enough typographical errors to keep everyone busy, he muddles
through a hectic life. Nothing could be more appropriate than to give here
an untouchd copy of his work as the proofreader encounters it, hot from
the machine:

NAME SQUID STAF FAT HEADS ELECTION
VOLUME IIIXXX WOW NO SOAP PRICE $-.05

Last but not least come ourselves, whereupon we have nothing to say.
Besides writing seven-eighths of all the advertisements and editorials,
Cabbages has written seven-eighths of all tlie stories published in the paper
this year, and taken up space when it was not even necessary.
With tears in our eyes and ears we now let our hands fall from the
keyboard of our typewriter (or rather the University's typewriter) never
again to throw a cabbage either for or at the Daily Palo Alto.
Famous Last Words: You know darn well no one on the staff has change
for a dollar!
