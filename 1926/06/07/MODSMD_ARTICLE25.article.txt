# FIRE INSPECTION HELD BEFORE DRY SEASON
## 
### 
Chief ifugan is certain that there
will be no duplication of the recent
San Francisco fire on the Stanford
campus if it is in his power to avoid it.
To be fully prepared for the coming
dry season, he has directed the burn
ing of most of the dry grass plots in
the vicinity of buildings.
Further protection will be obtained
by an inspection of the fraternity,
sorority, and living club houses. All
waste material that could be a possible
source of fire must be removed at once.
A prize is offered at the University
of lowa for the two women having the
smallest feet.
