The Canadian provincial universities
generally correspond to American
state universities. Entrance is based
on examinations given to graduates of
secondary schools. The universities
have four-year courses and are pub
licly endowed or supported by provin
cial legislatures. A difference between
the Canadian universities and Ameri
can universities is the greater impor
tance they attach to honorary courses
and examinations, instead of spending
more time in instruction.
English Lecture System
The English lecture system, which
is common at Stanford, but not used
in some state universities, is used in
all the Dominion institutions. In the
majority of subjects teachers give two
or three 50-minute lectures per week
and the students are required to pass
examinations at the end of the semes
ters.
With the exception of certain
French-Canadian institutions all the
universities in Canada are co-educa
tional and the attendance of men and
women is about equal.
University extension courses are
especially popular in the Western
Prairie Provinces. The University of
Alberta boasts that its extension divi
sion is the largest of any university in
proportion to population reaching one
third of the people of the province.
The larger universities in Canada
are Dalhousie, a privately endowed
denominational college at Halifax with
782 students, Laval, a men's Catholic
institution at Quebec with an enroll
ment of 1705, and the Western Pro
vincial Universities of Manitoba, Sas
katchewan, and Alberta with a com
bined registration of 4262 undergradu
ates.
Toronto Hundred Years Old
The University of Toronto, which
next year will celebrate its one hun
dredth anniversary and the twentieth
anniversary of the Presidency of Sir
Robert Falconer, is the provincial Uni
versity of Onatorio and the second
largest English-speaking university in
the British Empire. It has an enroll
ment record of about 5000 graduate
and undergraduate students register
ing from every province in Canada,
the United States, British Isles, China,
Japan, Korea, India, Australia, and
the British West Indies and Guiana,
together with nearly 13,000 students
registered in affiliated colleges of
Music, Agriculture, Pharmacy, and
Veterinary. At the university itself

| there are forty-five buildings for the
j faculties of arts, applied science, en-
I gineering, education, forestry, dentist-
I ry, and graduate studies. Over 300 i
| graduates are holding teaching posi
j tions in the United States at the pres
! ent time.
King's College is the oldest univer-
I sity in the British Overseas Domin
i ions, having been established at Wind
sor, Nova Scotia, in 1789 by the Angli
can body under the leadership of loyal
ists front New England.
Similar to Stanford
Queen University is the most simi
lege. As it is situation in the small
town of Kingston, Ontario, the stu
i dents have acquired a liberal and in
! dependent college atmosphere. The in
! stitution is about half the size of Stan
ford, and the men students live in
town and are responsible for student
government and self-discipline. About
300 women students live on the cam
pus in dormitories.
McGili University, situated on the
southern slope below Mt. Royal in
Montreal, is run on a large endowment j
of $16,000,000. In scholastic standing I
it is probably the highest in Canada,
the various engineering and law facul
ties rating particularly well. It has the
only school of physical education for
women in Canada.
The University of British Columbia
at Vancouver is the youngest of the
Canadian institutions, having been j
founded in 1915.
The students at British Columbia
recently by a slight majority voted to
allow their teams to play the American
football game. Before this the English
Rugby game, played from October to
March, was the most popular sport.
Prominent Sports
The first three months of the college j
year are the busiest in intercollegiate j
sports, which include Canadian and i
English rugby, track and field, harrier, I
soccer, tennis, and golf, all officially <
recognized by the. Canadian Intercolle
giate Athletic Union! The officially ,
recognized winter sports are hockey, j
swimming, water polo, gymnastics, j
wsestling, and boxing. The University
of Toronto has won the Canadian ama- i
teur rowing championship and repre- !
sented the Dominion in the Olympic I
Games where they placed second.
Football or Canadian Rugby is the |
sport which finances the others, and :
even the recently constructed stadiums j
at the larger universities are unable j
to cope with the demand for tickets, j
