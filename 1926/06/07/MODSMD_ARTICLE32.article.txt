# OAK TREES AROUND PALO ALTO FOUND HUNDRED YEARS OLD

### Templeton Peck 
] The familiar reference in literature
! and even in common speech to the
i "aged oak" have led many people to
believe that the oak trees which cover
! the hills of California and particularly
| the region around Stanford count their
I ages in centuries. But James I. W.
| McMurphy, professor of botany, has
! made a study of a group of about thirty
I local trees, in which he found that the
i rings of growth observable on the live
; oak (Quercus Agrifolia) indicated ages
varying from 51 to only 132 years.
"Probably none of the live oaks are
older than 150 years," he declared.
Professor McMurphy made his ob
| servations on the stumps of trees
which had been cut down after having
! died. With the aid of a microscope, he
was able to count the oftentimes indis
j tinct rings which under normal con
; ditions are of annual growth. The live
oak, he found, averaged the youngest.
The valley oak (Quercus Lobata), a de
| ciduous species, showed ages ranging
I from 175 to 281 years. Possibly some
! attain 300. The blue oak, which like
! the valley oak, is deciduous, shows
practically the same age.
Some May Be 500
"Some of the larger specimens of
these varieties I would guess to be
500 years old, but one cannot be cer
tain until they die or are cut down."
A second object of McMurphy's ex
periments was to discover if there
were any correlation between the
diameter of the trunk and the age of
the tree. The method used was to
count the growth-rings of the stump,
measure two diameters, at right an
gles, and note the height of the top
of the stump from the ground. In a
few cases a direct relation seemed to
obtain, but in others there would be
unaccountable differences.
; Two stumps, 73 years old, for exam
| pie, showed a diameter of 20 inches,
â€¢ a nice correlation. But in the case of
i two others, aged 64 years, one stump
| measured 12 inches while the other
measured 24. Still another pair of
stumps having a 20-inch diameter ex
j hibited an age variation of 47 years.
