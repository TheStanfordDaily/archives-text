Music Education in America—Archi
bald T. Davidson, Associate Profes
sor of Music at Harvard University,
and director of the Harvard Glee
Club. (Harpers.)
There is considerable food for
thought in this volume for the layman,
though its greatest appeal will be to
J educators and supervisors of music.
; Mr. Davidson states quite frankly that
America is an unmusical nation, and
in answer to the "Why" that naturally
follows, lays the blame entirely on our
j present inefficient and inadequate sys
; tems of musical education.
The book takes up elementary
i schools, secondary schools and col
leges, analyzes the faults that exist in
the musical curricula of each, and pro
|

j poses remedies that sound convincing
j enough.
He is a strong believer in the value
of the substantial type of music, the
classics which have proved their
j worth over long periods. He would
have children in the elementary and
high schools take part in the actual
performance of these works, confident
ly asserting that even young children
will derive more vital and lasting
j satisfaction from the real article than
[ from the weak and puerile songs that
I are the usual portion ol' the young be
i ginner in American public schools.
; Davidson applies the same theory to
j college glee clubs and community
i singing. .
As conductor of the Harvard Glee
1 Club Professor Davidson puts his theo
ries into practice; under his leadership
l the group turned from the usual "Rah,
I Rah" and mawkishly popular choral
; songs to the best classics, with the re
: suit that the club now has a larger
j membership, sings better, attracts a

I
better audience, exercises a wider in
fluence.
i Davidson takes a dig in passing at
some cherished traditions and habits.
He points out that the prevalent
"Music Memory" contests really show
little or nothing about the actual
I musical understanding even of the
j medal-winning lad who identifies 24H
out of a possible 250 selected over
tures, symphonies, tone poems, and
songs. Another rather silly custom ex
! posed is that of attempting to interest
! children —and grown-ups, too, for that
matter —in music for the first time by
telling them "stories" about every
piece they hear. The notion that each
| piece of music must represent some
thing definite and tangible is actually
harmful, says Davidson.
In our opinion the books falls into
the common error of assuming that
the average American is far less musi
cal than the average Frenchman or
German chiefly because the tradition
■ has always been to that effect. Artists

who come from the other side often
have a different story to tell.
The book is clearly and not at all
pedantically written. The author has
experience, and convictions based on
that experience. He does not claim to '
have a universal panacea for all the j
ills of musical education, but merely
a few suggestions that should help im- i
mensely.—H.A.K.

In our opinion the books falls into
the common error of assuming that
the average American is far less musi
cal than the average Frenchman or
German chiefly because the tradition
■ has always been to that effect. Artists

who come from the other side often
have a different story to tell.
The book is clearly and not at all
pedantically written. The author has
experience, and convictions based on
that experience. He does not claim to '
have a universal panacea for all the j
ills of musical education, but merely
a few suggestions that should help im- i
mensely.—H.A.K.
Music Education in America—Archi
bald T. Davidson, Associate Profes
sor of Music at Harvard University,
and director of the Harvard Glee
Club. (Harpers.)
There is considerable food for
thought in this volume for the layman,
though its greatest appeal will be to
J educators and supervisors of music.
; Mr. Davidson states quite frankly that
America is an unmusical nation, and
in answer to the "Why" that naturally
follows, lays the blame entirely on our
j present inefficient and inadequate sys
; tems of musical education.
The book takes up elementary
i schools, secondary schools and col
leges, analyzes the faults that exist in
the musical curricula of each, and pro
|

j poses remedies that sound convincing
j enough.
He is a strong believer in the value
of the substantial type of music, the
classics which have proved their
j worth over long periods. He would
have children in the elementary and
high schools take part in the actual
performance of these works, confident
ly asserting that even young children
will derive more vital and lasting
j satisfaction from the real article than
[ from the weak and puerile songs that
I are the usual portion ol' the young be
i ginner in American public schools.
; Davidson applies the same theory to
j college glee clubs and community
i singing. .
As conductor of the Harvard Glee
1 Club Professor Davidson puts his theo
ries into practice; under his leadership
l the group turned from the usual "Rah,
I Rah" and mawkishly popular choral
; songs to the best classics, with the re
: suit that the club now has a larger
j membership, sings better, attracts a

I
better audience, exercises a wider in
fluence.
i Davidson takes a dig in passing at
some cherished traditions and habits.
He points out that the prevalent
"Music Memory" contests really show
little or nothing about the actual
I musical understanding even of the
j medal-winning lad who identifies 24H
out of a possible 250 selected over
tures, symphonies, tone poems, and
songs. Another rather silly custom ex
! posed is that of attempting to interest
! children —and grown-ups, too, for that
matter —in music for the first time by
telling them "stories" about every
piece they hear. The notion that each
| piece of music must represent some
thing definite and tangible is actually
harmful, says Davidson.
