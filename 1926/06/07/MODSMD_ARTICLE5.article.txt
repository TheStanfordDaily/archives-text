# ICHIHASHI TO TALK ON NATIONS AROUND PACIFIC AT ASILOMAR
## Problems on Coast, Working Forces in Far East To Be Discussed 
### 
"Pacts about the Pacific" is the gen
eral topic which Professor Yamato
Ichihashi of the History department
will discuss in lectures which he will
give during the Asilomar conference
from June 17 to June 26.
In speaking of his lectures Profes
sor Ichihashi said in a recent inter
view, "It will be my aim to summarize
the salient facts concerning the na
tions bordering'the Pacific. The four
nations to be studied are China, India,
Korea, and Japan.
"The first topic to be taken up will
be that of immigration to the United
States from countries of the East,
with special emphasis on laws that
affect the Oriental interests, particu
larly on the Pacific Coast. My object
will be to expose the facts, rather than
discuss them. The law passed in 1924
which operates against the Japanese
will be included in the study.
"After stating the character of the
problem as we find it on the Coast,
we will go back to the countries of
the Far East to examine the working
forces in the lives of their peoples. My
approach will be to endeavor to draw
a line of demarcation between the vari
ous people. This is a most difficult
task, for it must attempt to overcome
the prejudice on the part of Western
ers that all Orientals are alike. If it
proves impossible, I shall present
facts which seem to differentiate each
! category of Asiatics from Westerners,
i Having exposed this particular diffi
' v:ulty, I wlil take up each of the four
j countries separately and give the im
| portant facts relative to them."
I In speaking of India Professor Ichi
j hash! will devote his time to a pre
sentation of the growth and history of
I Buddhism, and its subsequent exten
i sion through the three other countries.
