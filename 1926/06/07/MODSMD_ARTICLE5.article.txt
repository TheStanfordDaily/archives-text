# ICHIHASHI TO TALK ON NATIONS AROUND PACIFIC AT ASILOMAR
## Problems on Coast, Working Forces in Far East To Be Discussed 
### 
"Pacts about the Pacific" is the gen
eral topic which Professor Yamato
Ichihashi of the History department
will discuss in lectures which he will
give during the Asilomar conference
from June 17 to June 26.
In speaking of his lectures Profes
sor Ichihashi said in a recent inter
view, "It will be my aim to summarize
the salient facts concerning the na
tions bordering'the Pacific. The four
nations to be studied are China, India,
Korea, and Japan.
"The first topic to be taken up will
be that of immigration to the United
States from countries of the East,
with special emphasis on laws that
affect the Oriental interests, particu
larly on the Pacific Coast. My object
will be to expose the facts, rather than
discuss them. The law passed in 1924
which operates against the Japanese
will be included in the study.
"After stating the character of the
problem as we find it on the Coast,
we will go back to the countries of
the Far East to examine the working
forces in the lives of their peoples. My
approach will be to endeavor to draw
a line of demarcation between the vari
ous people. This is a most difficult
task, for it must attempt to overcome
the prejudice on the part of Western
ers that all Orientals are alike. If it
proves impossible, I shall present
facts which seem to differentiate each
! category of Asiatics from Westerners,
i Having exposed this particular diffi
' v:ulty, I wlil take up each of the four
j countries separately and give the im
| portant facts relative to them."
I In speaking of India Professor Ichi
j hash! will devote his time to a pre
sentation of the growth and history of
I Buddhism, and its subsequent exten
i sion through the three other countries.
Confucianism in China
The influence of confucianism on
! the life and culture in China and its
place in Korean and Japanese think
ing will be considered. Korea holds a
unique position in that it has no reli
gion indigenous to the nation, but is
j influenced by a combination of Confu
cianism and Buddhism, with some few
contributions of a national character.
Shintoism, the chief moving force in
j Japan, will also be studied.
"Having revealed the cultural back
ground of these nations, modern prac
tical aspects of the intercourse and
contacts between nations of the
and West will be considered. Educa
tional, social, economic, and religious
I conditions will be considered separ
ately for each of the four countries,
as their present status and needs are
! so varied as to make separate treat-
I ment necessary.
"For example, Japan does not need
help in education. Her school system
, is already equal to any in the world,
! and illiteracy is absolutely unknown.
| Medical knowledge is highly devel
oped, and missionary aid along that
j line is not needed. When we want
money, we come into the market and
pay interest, as our credit is perfectly
sound.
i
Bad Conditions in India
I "In India, however, illiteracy and
I abject poverty are appalling .and sani
! tary conditions are equally terrible.
| Korea is well situated at present, but
political chaos and poverty are at
: work in China. There is no definite
! school system in China, and there is
a lack of technical knowledge.
"Having stated the case from all
I these angles, we will try to find a
! means for effective co-operative work
j which will help bring understanding
between the nations and improve the
status of Westerners in the Orient and
| that of people from the Far East in
i the United States."
