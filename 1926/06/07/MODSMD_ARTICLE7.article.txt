# RACE PREJUDICE OF CHILDREN EVIDENCED BY QUESTIONNAIRES
## Student in Education Class Questions 106 Pupils in Grammar Schools 
### 
That race prejudice is developing in |
the minds of children of grammar J
school age is the conclusion reached j
after tabulation of answers given in j
questionnaires circulated recently by j
a student in a University education
class in order to determine the child i
attitude toward race.
Questionnaires were given out to
one hundred six children of the sixth,
seventh, and eighth grades of the
Mayfield Grammar School. Since the
race problem in California is largely ;
the Japanese problem, special atten
tion was given to the responses of the
ten Japanese pupils filling out the ,
questionnaire and to the attitude of
the other children concerning the i
Japanese. f
Results show plainly a marked pre-1
ference on the part of the whites for j
members of their own race. The Japa-!
nese, on the other hand, indicated a j
tendency to rate the white race above j
their own in almost every instance.
Germans Most Like Americans
The first question asked is as fol
lows: "Which of the people whose
names follow are most like Ameri
cans?" The following list accompanied
each question: Germans, Japanese,
I Turks, Russians, English, Negroes,
i Chinese, French, Italians. In answer
ing, the children were asked to give
their own opinions only, rating the
nations from one to nine in order of
preference.
Eight other questions followed, us
ing similar lists of the same people
which the pupils rated.
The English people are the most j
honest and trustworthy, according to
both the Americans and Japanese. The j
Americans place the French as second !
in the question of honesty, and the i
Japanese rate themselves second. I
The English are again rated first as j
making the best friends, according to I
both Japanese and American. Although
the Americans rated the French as j
second in the question of friendships, 1
the Japanese rate the Germans as sec-j
ond. Turks are rated last in this ques- j
tion by American children. The Turks j
and negroes received the same average j
placement in the Japanese tabulation, j
Both the Japanese and American
pupils rate the English first in the I
quality of making the best American j
citizen. Similar to the above question j
answers, the Germans are rated as j

I second by the Japanese in this ques
; tion, and the French are given second
j place by the Americans, Americans
say that Turks are least desirable as
| American citizens, while the Japanese
j say that negroes are least desirable.
Under "Which of these people have
j done the most for civilization?" the
Japanese group rates the nations in
i the order of French, English, Japanese
j showing that they are not partial to i
, their own nation. There seems to be
, no tendency for them to rate tliem
! selves at the top of the list.
The whites, on the other hand, rate
! the English whom they know the most !
j about, at the top of the list, while they
put the Japanese, whom they rate low
I on the question, "Which of these peo
! pie do you know the most about?" cor
j respondingly low on the other ques
tions.
Most Peaceful Peoples
Both the Japanese and Americans
| rate the English and French in first j
; and second places, respectively, in re- j
gard to the question of which people !
j is the most peaceful. The Japanese'
rank the Chinese as least peaceful. !
and the Turks are considered as least j
peaceful by the Americans.
Although the Americans express j
: highest desire for the English to live j
j in America, the fact that the Japanese

| express a preference for English peo- I
[ pie is a startling revelation. Nor do
J the Japanese place themselves second
in rating this question, but rate the
Germans second and the Japanese
third. The Americans choose the
French second in the question.
