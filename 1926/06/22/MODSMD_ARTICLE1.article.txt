# SUMMER QUARTER OFFERS VARIETY OF INTERESTS
## 
### JOHN A SELLARDS Director of the Summer Quarter 
Stanford University places before
you all its educational resources for
the summer quarter. Your faculty is
composed of members of the Stanford
staff, with the addition of visitors
from other institutions of the United
States and of Europe.
In summer you have an exceptional
opportunity to develop new interests
and to take advantage of much that
the University has to offer in addition
to classroom instruction. It is a splen
did chance to explore new fields and
to lay the foundation for a broader
culture. There will be public lectures
on many subjects for you to attend;
the Hoover War Library is the most
notable collection of its kind in Amer
ica, and is full of interesting materials
for others besides those who are spe
cializing in historical study; the exhi
bitions in the Art Gallery may be
visited with profit.

In addition to the concerts and re
citals which the University will pro
vide for you on the campus, no doubt
many summer quarter students will
welcome the opportunity to attend a
series of Sunday afternoon symphony
concerts at Hillsborough, near Stan
ford. This series will run through the
quarter, and the concerts will be given
under some of the principal conductors
of this country.

Week-end excursions have been ar
ranged throughout the quarter, in
order that you may see the principal
points of interest in this region of the
state. These will appeal particularly to
those who are newcomers to this part
of California.

Your fellow students come from
ous social gatherings, in order that
new arrivals and those who are here

for the summer only may have an
opportunity to know each other as
well as the students who are here for

nearly all the states in the Union, and
from a number of foreign countries.
There will be through the quarter vari
longer residence.
I am ready, as are the members of
the faculty, to give any information
or suggestions which you may need in
connection with your work at the Uni
versity. We all want your summer at
Stanford to be a most satisfactory one,
both from the point of view of work
accomplished and as a pleasant ex
perience that will leave a lasting
memory.


Director John A. Sellards
