# 1926 COMPLETES COLLEGE CAREER
## PROGRESS DEPENDS UPON VOLUNTEER SPIRIT: WILBUR 
### 
The spirit of the volunteer in edu
cated men and women is needed for
the progress and upbuilding of the
world, President Wilbur told the
graduates in his commencement ad
dress yesterday, tlie spirit of the man

who not only sees a need but is
willing to step forward and un
dertake the risk through action.
"We can determine the direc
tion in which we are moving by
looking ahead and moving for
ward," he said. "By studying the
past, so that its experiences may
guide us in the future, and by
volunteering for service we can
work each day toward better
things."
Dr. Wilbur pointed to the early
(lays of the war as the high
point in his career as president,
when Stanford students whole
lieartedly came to him for advice
as to how they could best serve,
willingly sacrificing their college
careers and their personal hopes
in their eagerness to aid the
country.
"Years of planning," he said,
"bright hopes for professional
life, cherished desires for the
establishment of a home, all
were pushed aside for the new
new and larger duty. The spirit

of the volunteer was as contagious as I
it was magnificent.
The Backwash of War
"Since those days and the critical
ones which followed we have apparent
ly been caught in the backwash from j
this high tide of emotion, self-sacri
fice, and aspiration. Great material I
prosperity with a spread of human
comforts to a degree never before
known, has brought out many qualities
in all parts of society which ar« remi
niscent of the grossness and weakness -
of the human being. High ideals, pri-!
yate, national, or international, are '
scoffed at in the public press and on )

the public forum. The dollar and all
of its ugly progeny seems at times to
be enthroned. The hit-run driver, the
giddy adolescent, the redolent bootleg
ger, the foul actress, the criminal, the
criminal lawyer, the free spender, and

the loose liver have much of the glare
of the spotlight turned on them by the
daily press.
"We grew up as a nation under
strong spiritual impulses and were
tempered by the severe struggle of
pioneer days. Adversity develops the
force we call character. Prosperity is
harder for the human being to with
stand and seems to wither much of the
most beautiful, and sensitive in the
make-up of individuals and societyl.
Prosperity, though, if properly guided,
builds a civilization. It can build here
on our continent, the greatest ever
known.


President Ray Lyman Wilbur
