# 1926 COMPLETES COLLEGE CAREER
## PROGRESS DEPENDS UPON VOLUNTEER SPIRIT: WILBUR 
### 
The spirit of the volunteer in edu
cated men and women is needed for
the progress and upbuilding of the
world, President Wilbur told the
graduates in his commencement ad
dress yesterday, tlie spirit of the man

who not only sees a need but is
willing to step forward and un
dertake the risk through action.
"We can determine the direc
tion in which we are moving by
looking ahead and moving for
ward," he said. "By studying the
past, so that its experiences may
guide us in the future, and by
volunteering for service we can
work each day toward better
things."
Dr. Wilbur pointed to the early
(lays of the war as the high
point in his career as president,
when Stanford students whole
lieartedly came to him for advice
as to how they could best serve,
willingly sacrificing their college
careers and their personal hopes
in their eagerness to aid the
country.
"Years of planning," he said,
"bright hopes for professional
life, cherished desires for the
establishment of a home, all
were pushed aside for the new
new and larger duty. The spirit

of the volunteer was as contagious as I
it was magnificent.
The Backwash of War
"Since those days and the critical
ones which followed we have apparent
ly been caught in the backwash from j
this high tide of emotion, self-sacri
fice, and aspiration. Great material I
prosperity with a spread of human
comforts to a degree never before
known, has brought out many qualities
in all parts of society which arÂ« remi
niscent of the grossness and weakness -
of the human being. High ideals, pri-!
yate, national, or international, are '
scoffed at in the public press and on )

the public forum. The dollar and all
of its ugly progeny seems at times to
be enthroned. The hit-run driver, the
giddy adolescent, the redolent bootleg
ger, the foul actress, the criminal, the
criminal lawyer, the free spender, and

the loose liver have much of the glare
of the spotlight turned on them by the
daily press.
"We grew up as a nation under
strong spiritual impulses and were
tempered by the severe struggle of
pioneer days. Adversity develops the
force we call character. Prosperity is
harder for the human being to with
stand and seems to wither much of the
most beautiful, and sensitive in the
make-up of individuals and societyl.
Prosperity, though, if properly guided,
builds a civilization. It can build here
on our continent, the greatest ever
known.


President Ray Lyman Wilbur
"You of the graduating class will
soon face the world looking for a place
where you can do your part and live
your life. It takes no great ability in
a prosperous country to fill a few stom
achs and cover a few backs. You with
your training should be able to do
that readily, but are you going to do
that volunteer work which in a thou
sand fields build up our community
life and our civilization? Most of the
advanced steps that are being made in
modern communities have come
through the voluntary efforts of indi
viduals who have made experiments
or performed services at the cost of
their own time and money."
Dr. Wilbur told the graduates that
the vision which comes from education
is essential to intelligent life. "But,"
he said, "it is just as important to act
as it is to see. Your real advancement
depends upon your capacity to volun
teer . Volunteering means exposure,
risk, struggle, effort. But the way to
it is open.
"You, as graduates of this Univer
sity, have been given the opportunity
to acquire a broader vision and a
greater understanding than many of
your fellow citizens. Many of you, too,
have shown the spirit of the volun
teer. We know from experience that
should any unusual call come a very
high percentage of you would rise to
meet the difficulty just as Stanford
men and women have done before. The
question that concerns us now is
whether as you take up the duties of
citizenship, you are going to lead a
life of self-interest and self-advance
ment, or whether you are going to take
care of yourself and at the same time
be able to contribute a large portion
of trained energy for the benefit of
the community."
Preserve Stanford Habit
The President urged the graduates
to take advantage of all they have ac
quired of the methods and habits of
students, but to bear in mind that
only by putting this into action can it
count for progress. "As a citizen," he
urged upon them, "it is important to
do something in the way of action.
Meditation is not apt to make one pro
ficient in the arts of citizenship. You
should have acquired here in the Uni
versity some of the habits of the stu
dent. You should know where the rec
ords of human knowledge are kept
and how to acquire further knowledge.
The student habit is built up with dif
ficulty; it requires concentration and
effort. Many who graduate from col
lege throw it off the way they do old
clothes. In many ways it is your most
valuable possession. Keep up the habit
of the student. Find out by using the
methods of the student what is going
on about you. Act, but guide your ac
tion by preparation. In this way you
can continually enlarge your vision
and increase your capacity for volun
teer service."
