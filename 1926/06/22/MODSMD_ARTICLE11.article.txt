# WORLD'S GOOD WORKMEN MUST MEET OPPOSITION
## 
### 
Men do not often get a chance to
work under "ideal conditions," and
the best work is often done when men
have to fight against adversity and op
position, declared Dean Willard L.
Sperry of the Harvard Theological
School in his baccalaureate address to
the graduating class in the Memorial
Church Sunday.
"The Trowel and the Sword" was
the subject of Dean Sperry's sermon,
hnd his text, Nehemiah 4:17, was,
"They which builded the wall . . . .
every one with one of his hands
wrought in the work, and with the
other he held a weapon."
"These men," said Dean Sperry,
"were building the walls of the City
of God. The work was going forward
under difficulties. Scoffers laughed at
them, enemies opposed them. They
seem never to have had an hour free
from distraction and danger. Tfiey
worked, as the story runs, with a
trowel in one hand and a sword in
the other.
"This University has been trying to
do one thing for you, namely, to put
into your hand the trowel with which

you may build a stable civilization
among men, fit to be called a City of
God. This trowel takes many forms.
It is a dividers and compass, a slide
rule, a table of logarithms, a painter's
brush, a surgeon's scalpel, a poet's
brush. You have the trowel in one
hand; it is now your need to take a
sword in the other.

"Your clamor for ideal conditions in
which to do efficient work is a claim
the world never has recognized and
does not now recognize. The great
work of the world has always been
done by those who worked with the
trowel and the sword.

"So intimately and constantly is
good work bound up with the unlikely
condition that one wonders if we were
given ideal conditions and theoreti
cally efficient labor the work would
be done. You see the greatest triumphs
of the human spirit in statescraft, sci
ence, letters, and art achieved in the
fact of adverse circumstance. Every
where you will see this sword arm of
the human spirit bared against pov
erty, neglect, disease, and implacable
oposition, fighting for the clear and in
violate place in which to work."
