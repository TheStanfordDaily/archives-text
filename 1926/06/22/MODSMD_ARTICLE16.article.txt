# STANFORD AWARDS DEGREES TO 807 MEN AND WOMEN
## WILBUR MAKES ADDRESS Thirty-fifth Commencement Marks Largest Class In History 
### 
At its thirty-fifth commencement
yesterday in the Memorial Church
Stanford conferred tlie A.B. degree
upon 579 men and women, and various
advanced degrees upon 228 others, a
total of 807. At its first commencement,
held in the old chapel, now the Little
Theatre, before the church had been
built, the University conferred 29
A.B.'s and nine higher degrees. It was
not until Stanford had graduated its
sixth class, in 1897, that the whole
number of A.B. degrees conferred up
to that time totaled as many as were
bestowed yesterday.

"Keep up the habit of the student,
guide your action by the methods of
the student, but, act," was the advice
in the commencement address yester
day by President Wilbur, who in 1896
received his own degree from Stan
ford at the hands of Dr. Jordan, the
first president.
A Cosmopolitan Body
In its early years Stanford prided
itself 011 drawing students from all
parts of the country. Among the gradu
ates yesterday were representatives
from thirty-eight states outside Cali
fornia, as well as from Hawaii and
the Philippines and nine foreign coun
tries. Sixty-six colleges besides Stan
ford had given degrees to those who
received their advanced degrees here
yesterday.
At the first commencement and for
many after that, there were no gifts to
the University to be announced; none
had been received from any but the
Founders. Yesterday President Wilbur,
in announcing gifts during the year
totaling many thousands, read from a
twelve-page on the printed
pages of which the benefactions were
listed.
Gifts to the University
The most notable of these gifts, and
one that was not announced until yes
terday, was $50,000 from the Rocke
feller Foundation, an addition to the
$50,000 given last year for the erec
tion and equipment of another building
for the Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove. This department of the
University, which ranks with the sta
tion at Naples, Italy, and that at
Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, for the
excellence of its location for the study
of ocean life, attracts investigators
from all parts of the world to its
laboratories. Formerly, it was used for
regular University classes in the sum
mer, but now it is maintained in full
operation for such classes through half
the year.
Other gifts that were announced in
clude $73,000 from Carnegie Corpora
tion for the maintenance of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute for the
year, $40,000 from business men of
the state for the support of the Gradu
ate School of Business, $25,000 from
the class of '99, and $27,000 from '25,
both through endowment insurance,
and a more than usually large number
of donations to the Hoover War Li
brary from foreign governments and
from individuals, many of them rare
and valuable publications and docu
ments.
Last Class Gathering
The final gathering of the graduates
in the Inner Quad after the commence
ment exercises closed a period of fes
tivities that began with the senior
play Wednesday evening, following the
last final examination, and running
through the reception of President and
Mrs. Wilbur, the senior promenade in

the Union court, the senior ball in
Toyon hall, class day, with exercises
in the church, the laying of the class
plate, and the ceremony of the class
gift, the baccalaureate sermon, and
the various faculty receptions Sunday
afternoon.

yesterday in the Memorial Church
Stanford conferred tlie A.B. degree
upon 579 men and women, and various
advanced degrees upon 228 others, a
total of 807. At its first commencement,
held in the old chapel, now the Little
Theatre, before the church had been
built, the University conferred 29
A.B.'s and nine higher degrees. It was
not until Stanford had graduated its
sixth class, in 1897, that the whole
number of A.B. degrees conferred up
to that time totaled as many as were
bestowed yesterday.

"Keep up the habit of the student,
guide your action by the methods of
the student, but, act," was the advice
in the commencement address yester
day by President Wilbur, who in 1896
received his own degree from Stan
ford at the hands of Dr. Jordan, the
first president.
A Cosmopolitan Body
In its early years Stanford prided
itself 011 drawing students from all
parts of the country. Among the gradu
ates yesterday were representatives
from thirty-eight states outside Cali
fornia, as well as from Hawaii and
the Philippines and nine foreign coun
tries. Sixty-six colleges besides Stan
ford had given degrees to those who
received their advanced degrees here
yesterday.
At the first commencement and for
many after that, there were no gifts to
the University to be announced; none
had been received from any but the
Founders. Yesterday President Wilbur,
in announcing gifts during the year
totaling many thousands, read from a
twelve-page on the printed
pages of which the benefactions were
listed.
Gifts to the University
The most notable of these gifts, and
one that was not announced until yes
terday, was $50,000 from the Rocke
feller Foundation, an addition to the
$50,000 given last year for the erec
tion and equipment of another building
for the Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove. This department of the
University, which ranks with the sta
tion at Naples, Italy, and that at
Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, for the
excellence of its location for the study
of ocean life, attracts investigators
from all parts of the world to its
laboratories. Formerly, it was used for
regular University classes in the sum
mer, but now it is maintained in full
operation for such classes through half
the year.
Other gifts that were announced in
clude $73,000 from Carnegie Corpora
tion for the maintenance of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute for the
year, $40,000 from business men of
the state for the support of the Gradu
ate School of Business, $25,000 from
the class of '99, and $27,000 from '25,
both through endowment insurance,
and a more than usually large number
of donations to the Hoover War Li
brary from foreign governments and
from individuals, many of them rare
and valuable publications and docu
ments.
Last Class Gathering
The final gathering of the graduates
in the Inner Quad after the commence
ment exercises closed a period of fes
tivities that began with the senior
play Wednesday evening, following the
last final examination, and running
through the reception of President and
Mrs. Wilbur, the senior promenade in

the Union court, the senior ball in
Toyon hall, class day, with exercises
in the church, the laying of the class
plate, and the ceremony of the class
gift, the baccalaureate sermon, and
the various faculty receptions Sunday
afternoon.
