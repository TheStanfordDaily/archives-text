# STANFORD AWARDS DEGREES TO 807 MEN AND WOMEN
## WILBUR MAKES ADDRESS Thirty-fifth Commencement Marks Largest Class In History 
### 
At its thirty-fifth commencement
yesterday in the Memorial Church
Stanford conferred tlie A.B. degree
upon 579 men and women, and various
advanced degrees upon 228 others, a
total of 807. At its first commencement,
held in the old chapel, now the Little
Theatre, before the church had been
built, the University conferred 29
A.B.'s and nine higher degrees. It was
not until Stanford had graduated its
sixth class, in 1897, that the whole
number of A.B. degrees conferred up
to that time totaled as many as were
bestowed yesterday.

"Keep up the habit of the student,
guide your action by the methods of
the student, but, act," was the advice
in the commencement address yester
day by President Wilbur, who in 1896
received his own degree from Stan
ford at the hands of Dr. Jordan, the
first president.
A Cosmopolitan Body
In its early years Stanford prided
itself 011 drawing students from all
parts of the country. Among the gradu
ates yesterday were representatives
from thirty-eight states outside Cali
fornia, as well as from Hawaii and
the Philippines and nine foreign coun
tries. Sixty-six colleges besides Stan
ford had given degrees to those who
received their advanced degrees here
yesterday.
At the first commencement and for
many after that, there were no gifts to
the University to be announced; none
had been received from any but the
Founders. Yesterday President Wilbur,
in announcing gifts during the year
totaling many thousands, read from a
twelve-page on the printed
pages of which the benefactions were
listed.
Gifts to the University
The most notable of these gifts, and
one that was not announced until yes
terday, was $50,000 from the Rocke
feller Foundation, an addition to the
$50,000 given last year for the erec
tion and equipment of another building
for the Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove. This department of the
University, which ranks with the sta
tion at Naples, Italy, and that at
Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, for the
