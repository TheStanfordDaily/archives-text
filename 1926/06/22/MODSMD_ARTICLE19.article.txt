Stanford is a little city, and its spirit is earnestness and good fellow
ship. Those of ns who have been citizens here for longer or shorter times
wclcome all the newcomers into this fellowship, as we welcome each other
back. There is plenty of hard work to be done and plenty of opportunities
for relaxation and recreation. Not all the activities which help to bind
us together during other quarters are available in the summer, but there
are enough if we take advantage of them. Good citizenship calls for some
contribution by each to the community life and enterprises. Do your share.
This paper hopes to serve as one of these centralizing and unifying
forces. Make it your own. We want to serve as a medium for the
exchange of opinions and the dissemination of good Suggestions. We
shall welcome communications from our readers, provided they concern
the general interests of the campus community, are signed (though the
signature need not be published if you prefer), and do not exceed 250
words in lengthâ€”shorter is better.
