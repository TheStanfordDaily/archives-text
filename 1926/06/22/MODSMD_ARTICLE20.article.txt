# Summer Symphony
## 
### 
Through the public spirit and efforts of a group of Peninsula citizens,
seven symphony concerts by one of the best organizations in the country,
in a setting of ideal fitness just a little outside our gates, are available to
summer quarter students and faculty for only $4. It hardly seems
necessary to urge that such a remarkable opportunity be accepted, but it
may be timely to warn that the first concert comes soon and that tickets
should be purchased promptly.
