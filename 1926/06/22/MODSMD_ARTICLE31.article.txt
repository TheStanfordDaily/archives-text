# RYAN ABLE TO WIDEN EXPERIMENTS' SCOPE IN NEW LABORATORY
## 
### Templeton Peck 
Erected to provide facilities for
(Wider experimentation in high voltage
electric transmission, the Harris J.
Ryan laboratory of electrical engineer
ing, situated near Frenchman's Dam
on a special grant of University prop-
Jyty, nears completion.

The structure has been built
through the combined donations of the
iUniversity and General Electric Com
pany, the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company, the California-Oregon Power
Company, the San Joaquin Light and
Power Company, and the Great West
ern Power Company, and upon comple
tion will be turned over to Dr. Harris
J. Ryan, head of the Electrican Engi
neering department, and his associates
and students.

The University has built the labora
tory and prominent electrical develop
ment companies have equipped it in
recognition of the contributions of Dr.
Ryan and the Stanford engineering de
partment to the electrical industry.
The benefits received will be mutual,
but the step marks a significant ad
vance toward a lasting corporation
between the pure science of the Uni
versity and the technical science of
industry.
Discoveries Valuable
To accomplish such a union has been
one of the motives of Dr. Ryan in his
■work both here and at Cornell, where
he began his study of high voltage
phenomena. His discoveries made in
,the local high-voltage laboratory, built
in 1913, have solved many of the dif
ficulties encountered in power trans
mission and have saved millions of
dollars in large-scale electric opera
tion.

The total coat of the project was
approximately $360,000!, including the
property given by the University,
valued at $75,000. Seventy-five acres
of land comprising a strip 300 feet
•wide and 8,000 feet long have been
appropriated by the trustees of the
.University, on which to suspend large
transmission lines. The land grant
may be increased to 200 acres, allow
ing for a strip six miles long, if the
lieed arises.
Expense Divided
The University also donated $110,000
for the erection of the laboratory
building. The remainder of the ex
pense is divided among the following
items: six transformers (gift of Gen
eral Electric) $116,000'; fffenerators and
other equipment, $34,000; cranes,
$5000. Freight and installation charges
amounted to $20,000.

Constructed entirely of steel, the
framework of the main laboratory
building is 173 feet long, 60 feet wide,
and 50 feet high from floor to trusses.
The walls are covered with corrugated
asbestos board. Three giant doors are
provided on the south wall, each forty
feet square. Through these the high
voltage terminals lead. At the west
end of the building a partition cuts
off an area fifty feet wide in which
will be installed the equipment used
in the old laboratory. Elementary in
struction and researches requiring the
use of comparatively low voltages will
be carried on here.
Transformers Donated
In the main room of the laboratory,
60 by 120 feet, will be located the six
huge transformers donated by General
Electric. These are at present being
transported to, and installed in, the
laboratory. They are each capable of
developing 350 kilovolt-amperes, and
taken together can supply 2,100,000
volts single-phase, or 1,200,000 volts
three-phase. The former voltage repre
sents the highest ever produced at
commercial frequency.

Adjacent to the north side of the
main building is a much smaller con
crete structure containing the requi
site power plant, power and voltage
control facilities, offices, instruments
and equipment, photographic dark
room, and seminar library rooms. Here
■will be located two synchronous motor
generator power-receiving and control
sets for operating the transformers.
The motors have a capacity of 500
kilowatts each and the three-phase
line-wave generators 1500 kilovolt-am
peres each.
Little Power Used
The two million volt testing set,
contributed by the General Electric,
was manufactured at, and shipped di
rect from, the company's factories in
Schenectady, New York, and Pittsfield,
Massachusetts. This set is the largest

ever made and will operate at a volt
age of 2,100,000.

The total annual cost for power con
sumed in the laboratory will be com
paratively small because of the short
durations of time when large amounts
of power will be required for study
and test purposes. The University
itself will be obliged to carry this ex
pense until such time as an endow
ment shall be made.
Problem Is Great
The problem of transmission of elec
trical power at high voltages, 500,000
to 1,000,000, increasingly demands so
lution as the West expands in num
bers and needs. The Columbia and
Colorado rivers are almost unlimited
sources of power, and as soon as long
distance transmission is made feasible,
will be developed to supply the bulk
of the electricity consumed throughout
the Western region.

According to electrical experts, the
power industry must be prepared to
enter upon a program of trunk-line
transmission for the interconnection
of the greater power sources and mar
ket centers. Sufficiently high voltages
must be supplied to compete economi
cally with steam power. This is the
responsibility of engineers like Dr.
Ryan and the experts of the country's
leading electrical companies—to de
velop and perfect transmission pro
cesses which will provide a rapidly
growing area with the needed power.
