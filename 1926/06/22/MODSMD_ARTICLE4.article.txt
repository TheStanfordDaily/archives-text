# BARBER MEETS NEW CUSTOMERS
## 
### 
With the opening of summer
session many new faces have
been seen frequenting the Block
"S" Barber Shop in Palo Alto.
Throughout the year Ted Housh,
the proprietor, comes to know a
large part of the Stanford stu
dents, for many of them patron
ize his shop, but with a new
quarter starting he is faced with
the task of meeting the students
registering here for the first
time. The shop will remain open
all summer with a force of five
barbers ready to serve you to
your satisfaction. Your patron
age is solicited.
