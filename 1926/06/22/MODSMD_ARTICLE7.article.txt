# CAST TRIALS FOR "AREN'T WE ALL" OPEN TOMORROW
## SENIOR FARCE PLEASES Patrice Nauman Plays Well As Mrs. Harvey Lennox In "Meet the Wife" 
### 
Tryouts for parts in "Aren't We
I.All?" Frederick Lonsdale's recent New
York success, will be held in the As
sembly Hall, tomorrow afternoon from
I 3 to 5 and in the evening from 7 to 10
! o'clock. Gordon Davis, dramatics di-

rector, urges everyone interested to
try out for the three plays to be given
during the quarter. Any registered
student, graduate or undergraduate,
with the exception of freshman wo
men, is eligible.

Davis himself will take in "Aren't
We All?" the leading role first played
in New York by Cyril Maude. The play
will be presented in the Assembly
hall July 9, which requires that the
cast be picked and rehearsals be be
gun at the earliest possible time, ac
cording to Davis.
"Meet the Wife," the 1926 Senior
Farce, provided an admirable and
wholly pleasant conclusion to the
Stanford dramatic season of 1925-26.
The sheer comedy and brilliance of
the dialogue of Lynn Starling's play
kept the audience in an uproar for the
better part of two hours.

The cast chosen by Director Gordon
Davis carried along the difficult char
acterizations with scarcely a mishap.
As Mrs. Harvey Lennox, the tempera
mental, domineering, and enthusiastic
hostess of "Liberty Hall," Miss Pa
trice Nauman deftly handled a part
which required ease and sureness in
technique and a natural flair for com
edy. It is greatly to be doubted if any
other campus actress could have
played the role as capably; Miss Nau
man showed the true spirit of the
farceur.
Seconding the efforts of Miss Nau
man were Delmer Daves as Mr. Len
nox and Hal Boomer as the aesthetic
Victor Staunton. This capable three,
Miss Nauman, Daves, and Boomer,
breathed a life and humor into the
Starling farce that drew the continued
laughter and applause of the audience.

Sam Hayes overcame the difficulties
usually attendant on such a role and
carried along well the part of Philip
Bellamy, Mrs. Lennox's first husband.
In the roles which furnished the juve
nile love interest Miss Adelaide Kelly
and Wayne Newcomb had parts which
were eclipsed in the flow of laughter
arising from Mr. and Mrs. Lennox and
Victor.
Gordon Davis' direction was pleas
antly evident in that the actors bridged
over with no difficulty some rather
obvious weaknesses in the construc
tion of the Starling play. Mr. and Mrs.
Leslie Kiler designed an effective set
ting for the living room of "Liberty
Hall."
