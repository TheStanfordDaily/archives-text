# FIRST AUTO TRIP OFFERS VARIETY GOING TO OCEAN
## Week-End Excursion Leads Through Redwoods to Half Moon Bay TO VIEW QUAKE FAULTS Picturesque Route Winds From Foothills Over Summit to Sea 
### 
On Saturday, July 10, at 10 a.m., the
first of a series of eight summer week
end excursions sponsored by the Uni
versity will leave for La Honda and
Half Moon Bay. The trip starts from
the main entrance of the Stanford
Union. The fare is $2.50, passengers
providing their own luncheons.
The trip from Stanford to Half
IVloon Bay provides a wealth of pecu
liarly varied and interesting scenery.
Comfortable seven-passenger cars will
carry the excursionists from the level
valley over the typical rolling foothills
bordering the Santa Clara Valley, into
the mountains covered with stately
and impressively beautiful redwoods,
and then down the western slopes of
the mountains to the Pacific.
There is much of interest to per
sons of all inclinations. The early part
•of the trip is through territory which
is reminiscent of the early days of
Stanford. Later those who hold in
terest in geology and natural history
will have the opportunity to see earth
quake faults and interesting exempli
fications of the flora and fauna of Cali
fornia.
The route follows the County Road
back of Lagunita, past the old Palo
Alto Stock Farm, famed as the birth
place of the world reknowned race
horse, Palo Alto, then across the an
cient and rickety bridge which spans
Sau Francisquito Creek and to the
left on the county highway. Five miles
from the campus on this road is "The
"Wunder " a resort which appeared oil
the itinerary of a group of visiting
scientists not long ago as "a former
life-saving station on the left." A few
miles beyond this is the first view of
! the San Andreas earthquake fault,
which is crossed again later.
Pass Searsville Lake
Then the road leads past Searsville
I Lake where, to secure water for irri
gation purposes, a canyon was dammed
j and the thriving village of Searsville
j submerged, making a lake that is now
a playground for Peninsula people. A
| mile from Searsville -the route turns
j abruptly and commences the ascent
I of the La Honda grade. Half way up
■ there is a wide-spread view of Lake
j Searsville and the entire Portola val
! ley below, with the University's red
roofs a conspicuous feature.
The summit of the grade is some
: 1500 feet above sea-level. There the
new Skyline Boulevard is crossed.
From summit down to the ocean, the
road winds through second-growth red
wood and some of the original trees.
Six miles down the western slope the
i route leads into La Honda, a pictur-
I esque mountain hamlet famous for its
j delicious cider. A mile or two beyond
. this is Bonzagni's mountain lodge, well
known for its excellent food. The road
winds down from Bonzagni's to the
: rolling foothills and to Half Moon Bay.
Buccaneers' Battleground
Passing through Half Moon Bay, a
rather shabby small village, the party
will reach the long, curving beach,
which possesses an element of ro
mance from contemporary buccaneer
ing escapades. It is reputed to be the
inlet for much of the liquor supply of
northern California. Several bloody
conflicts have been staged between
bootleggers, federal officers, and hi
; jackers, and many wild, tales have
I come out of the hills of hangings, rack
ings, and torture, which smack of me-
I dieval cruelty rather than of the pro
i saic present.
The route affords a number of little
glimpses of the geology of the region
and the San Andreas rift is crossed
four times. A great variety of trees
and other vegetation may be seen, the
outstanding features being the oaks
of the valley, the redwoods of the
mountains, and the marine flora of
the coast. The fauna of the region is
also varied and interesting, but na
turally will not be displayed to the best
J advantage to those travelling in a pro
cession of automobiles.
The University has set aside both
i the ridge and Lake Searsville as a
J natural history preserve. On account of
j the diversity of the soil and slope ex-
I posure several plant formations such
Sas chaparral, oak forest, and grass land
j are represented on the ridge. Sixty
five species of trees and shrubs have
been listed as growing on the reserve.
The trip is expected to take approxi
mately five hours, the return being
about 4 in the afternoon.
