# LESTER SEIB ON CAMPUS NOW FOR SHORT VACATION
## 
### 
Lester Seib, '22, known on the pro
j fessional stage as Lester Vail, and
! remembered here for his talented
| work in Stanford dramatics, has re
l turned to the campus for a short vaca
tion before resuming his work on
Broadway. Seib has just completed a
successful season in New York, having
recently finished playing the leading
male role in "The Makropolous Se
cret," a play in which Helen Menken
was the feminine lead. Seib is under
lontract with Charles Hopkins for the
coming season.
Commenting on Stanford dramatics,
Seib, wbo had his preliminary training
under Gordon Davis, present director
of dramatics here, said, "Throughout
the East, Stanford holds an enviable
place in the sun, in having one of the
finest of the so-called little theatres
organizations of the country, as dis
tinguished from the professional stage.
In no college that I know," he said, "is
attempted the number of plays which
Stanford successfully produces during
the college year, and in no college are
plays produced with more finesse and
professional technique than here at
Stanford."
Stanford Training Helped
Seib says he derived great benefit
from his dramatic training at Stan
ford. "I gained very much from my
training under the dramatic organiza
tion here," he said. "Not only in act

! ing, but in direction and the technical
side of the stage, is the training in
valuable. Hut," he said in commenting
on the plight of the stage-struck ama
teur, "despite all the excellent train
ing in the world, an actor must pos
sess natural talent to become success
ful. Actors are born and not made.
There are many persons who show a
certain degree of talent in college dra
matics and who have the desire to be
j come professional actors, and it is one
of the greatest problems of the di
rector of college dramatics to tactfully
prevent such people from attempting
professional acting which invariably
results in mediocrity. I should rather
be a good plumber than a fair actor,"
he added.
Seib has had a colorful career in the J
four years since his graduation. The j
year following his commencement he
toured the Orient with a repertory
company. Gordon Davis was a member
of the same party. For two years after J
his return from the Orient, Seib played |
with Jesse Bonstelle's stock company i
in Detroit, where he became a favorite j
with the theatre-going public. In the !
past season he played the lead in
"Caught," a successful Broadway pro
duction, and has recently closed the
season with the leading male role in J
Capek's "Makropoulous Secret." Seib
will spend a short while on the campus
before returning to New York.

Seib has had a colorful career in the J
four years since his graduation. The j
year following his commencement he
toured the Orient with a repertory
company. Gordon Davis was a member
of the same party. For two years after J
his return from the Orient, Seib played |
with Jesse Bonstelle's stock company i
in Detroit, where he became a favorite j
with the theatre-going public. In the !
past season he played the lead in
"Caught," a successful Broadway pro
duction, and has recently closed the
season with the leading male role in J
Capek's "Makropoulous Secret." Seib
will spend a short while on the campus
before returning to New York.
Lester Seib, '22, known on the pro
j fessional stage as Lester Vail, and
! remembered here for his talented
| work in Stanford dramatics, has re
l turned to the campus for a short vaca
tion before resuming his work on
Broadway. Seib has just completed a
successful season in New York, having
recently finished playing the leading
male role in "The Makropolous Se
cret," a play in which Helen Menken
was the feminine lead. Seib is under
lontract with Charles Hopkins for the
coming season.
Commenting on Stanford dramatics,
Seib, wbo had his preliminary training
under Gordon Davis, present director
of dramatics here, said, "Throughout
the East, Stanford holds an enviable
place in the sun, in having one of the
finest of the so-called little theatres
organizations of the country, as dis
tinguished from the professional stage.
In no college that I know," he said, "is
attempted the number of plays which
Stanford successfully produces during
the college year, and in no college are
plays produced with more finesse and
professional technique than here at
Stanford."
Stanford Training Helped
Seib says he derived great benefit
from his dramatic training at Stan
ford. "I gained very much from my
training under the dramatic organiza
tion here," he said. "Not only in act

! ing, but in direction and the technical
side of the stage, is the training in
valuable. Hut," he said in commenting
on the plight of the stage-struck ama
teur, "despite all the excellent train
ing in the world, an actor must pos
sess natural talent to become success
ful. Actors are born and not made.
There are many persons who show a
certain degree of talent in college dra
matics and who have the desire to be
j come professional actors, and it is one
of the greatest problems of the di
rector of college dramatics to tactfully
prevent such people from attempting
professional acting which invariably
results in mediocrity. I should rather
be a good plumber than a fair actor,"
he added.
