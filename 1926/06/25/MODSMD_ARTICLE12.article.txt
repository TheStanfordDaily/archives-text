# DR. HANS BLICHFELDT SUFFERS HEAVY LOSS IN FIRE IN HIS HOME
## Electric Toaster Supposed Cause of Blazeâ€”University Apparatus Called 
### 
Damage of approximately $3500, in
cluding the loss of valuable books and
papers, was caused by fire originating
in an electric toaster at the College
Terrace home of Professor Hans F.
Blichfeldt of the Stanford Mathe
matics department shortly after 10
o'clock Wednesday morning. Insurance
partially covers the damage.
The toaster left burning in the
kitchen started the blaze, which rapid
ly spread to the second floor and roof
where it was brought under control
only after the Mayfield, Palo Alto, and
Stanford University fire trucks arrived.
Much additional damage was caused
by water, and by delay in turning in
the alarm. Occupants of the house did
not make use of the nearby fire alarm
box, recently installed, and were un
able to reach the fire department
promptly by phone.
