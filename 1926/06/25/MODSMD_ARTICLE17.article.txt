# POSTPONE FIRST PLAY OF SUMMER TO A WEEK LATER
## Later Date for Production Gives More Advantages; No Interferences TRYOUTS TO CONTINUE Theatrical Workshop Class Will Handle Sets for Coming Play 
### 
Frederick Lonsdale's delightful play,
"Aren't We All?" will not be given Fri
day night, July 9, as was previously an
nounced. Instead the first play of the
Summer season will be given July 16,
one week from that date. Gordon
Davis, director of dramatics, feels that
a better production may be given with
the addition of the extra period of time.
No other Campus activity conflicts
with this time so it was decided to post
pone the production date.
The exact repertoire for the Summer
productions is not yet definitely known.
There will be three plays in all, two of
which will be Lonsdale's play and Noel
Coward's "Hay Fever." The third play
lias not yet been selected, nor is the
relative date of production decided upon.
Tryouts Will Continue
Tryouts for the present production
have brought out a quantity of talent
which augurs well for an excellent pro
duction. Tryouts will continue today
and tomorrow in the Assembly Hall,
from 3 till 5, and 7 till 10. Davis urges
everyone to try out.
The technical and art direction of the
Summer plays will as usual, be in the
hands of Mr. and Mrs. E. Leslie Kiler,
who have had so much to do with the
building of the reputation of Stanford
dramatics throughout the country. Mr.
Kiler has the happy faculty of being
able to both design and construct his
sets. Mrs. Kiler is especially gifted in
the art of costuming as well as design
ing.
Theatrical Workshop Executes
The execution of Mr. Kiler's ideas is
carried out unde rliis supervision by
Gordon Davis' class in Theatrical
Workshop.
Gordon A. Davis, who has been for
the past eight years connected with
Stanford dramatics as director, will
have charge of all the Summer plays.
His task is made doubly difficult by the
fact that he plays the leading part in
one of the three plays. Davis has in
the past directed with remarkable suc
cess such plays as Capek's "R. U. R.,"
"Macbeth," and "Dear Brutus." These
plays and others have attracted nation
wide attention.
The summer season of this year
promises to be one of the best which
the campus has seen. For the past two
years Greek drama lias been produced
on the steps of the Museum. This year
the classic production has been omitted
and another indoor play added to the
list. This gives greater opportunity to
a larger number to participate, as stu
dents are permitted to act in but one
play cach quarter.

dramatics throughout the country. Mr.
Kiler has the happy faculty of being
able to both design and construct his
sets. Mrs. Kiler is especially gifted in
the art of costuming as well as design
ing.
Theatrical Workshop Executes
The execution of Mr. Kiler's ideas is
carried out unde rliis supervision by
Gordon Davis' class in Theatrical
Workshop.
Gordon A. Davis, who has been for
the past eight years connected with
Stanford dramatics as director, will
have charge of all the Summer plays.
His task is made doubly difficult by the
fact that he plays the leading part in
one of the three plays. Davis has in
the past directed with remarkable suc
cess such plays as Capek's "R. U. R.,"
"Macbeth," and "Dear Brutus." These
plays and others have attracted nation
wide attention.
The summer season of this year
promises to be one of the best which
the campus has seen. For the past two
years Greek drama lias been produced
on the steps of the Museum. This year
the classic production has been omitted
and another indoor play added to the
list. This gives greater opportunity to
a larger number to participate, as stu
dents are permitted to act in but one
play cach quarter.
Frederick Lonsdale's delightful play,
"Aren't We All?" will not be given Fri
day night, July 9, as was previously an
nounced. Instead the first play of the
Summer season will be given July 16,
one week from that date. Gordon
Davis, director of dramatics, feels that
a better production may be given with
the addition of the extra period of time.
No other Campus activity conflicts
with this time so it was decided to post
pone the production date.
The exact repertoire for the Summer
productions is not yet definitely known.
There will be three plays in all, two of
which will be Lonsdale's play and Noel
Coward's "Hay Fever." The third play
lias not yet been selected, nor is the
relative date of production decided upon.
Tryouts Will Continue
Tryouts for the present production
have brought out a quantity of talent
which augurs well for an excellent pro
duction. Tryouts will continue today
and tomorrow in the Assembly Hall,
from 3 till 5, and 7 till 10. Davis urges
everyone to try out.
The technical and art direction of the
Summer plays will as usual, be in the
hands of Mr. and Mrs. E. Leslie Kiler,
who have had so much to do with the
building of the reputation of Stanford
dramatics throughout the country. Mr.
Kiler has the happy faculty of being
able to both design and construct his
sets. Mrs. Kiler is especially gifted in
