# POSTPONE FIRST PLAY OF SUMMER TO A WEEK LATER
## Later Date for Production Gives More Advantages; No Interferences TRYOUTS TO CONTINUE Theatrical Workshop Class Will Handle Sets for Coming Play

Frederick Lonsdale's delightful play,
"Aren't We All?" will not be given Fri

The exact repertoire for the Summer

There will be three plays in all, two of
which will be Lonsdale's play and Noel

lias not yet been selected, nor is the
relative date of production decided upon.
Tryouts Will Continue
Tryouts for the present production
have brought out a quantity of talent
which augurs well for an excellent pro
duction. Tryouts will continue today
and tomorrow in the Assembly Hall,
from 3 till 5, and 7 till 10. Davis urges
everyone to try out.
The technical and art direction of the
Summer plays will as usual, be in the
hands of Mr. and Mrs. E. Leslie Kiler,
who have had so much to do with the
building of the reputation of Stanford

Kiler has the happy faculty of being
able to both design and construct his
sets. Mrs. Kiler is especially gifted in
