# Get Acquainted
## 
### 
The first flays of the summer quarter are marked with a great number
meetings arranged to permit speedy formation of acquaintance between
the members of the University, faculty and students. For many of these,
Stanford associations are restricted to the brief three months of the sum
mer term. If they are to form here the personal contacts which are so
large a part of the benefits of being in such a community as this they must
begin early.
The University officials and the permanent residents of the campus
have done their part admirably; it remains for all to take advantage of the
opportunity offered.
One of the best of these gatherings is the informal reception at the
President's House this evening. It is good particularly, because to it all
parts of the community are invited. All Stanford people can begin to get
acquainted with each other at once.
