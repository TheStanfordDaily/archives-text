### 
A California orchestra, led by a California composer, and playing
music by that composer out-of-doors in the California style, is the unique
combination that is being offered to people at Stanford and in the vicinity
in the concert to be given at the Hillsborough school grounds, only 12
miles from the campus, on Sunday. The director, Henry Hadley, helped
to found the California orchestra he will lead Sunday.
The place chosen for this concert and the rest of the series sponsored
during the summer by the Philharmonic Society of San Mateo County
is convenient of access from the campus, and has the added asset of giving
people a chance to hear really good music outdoors, a desirable combina
tion in summer.
The concert series should be a success because the combination of cul
ture and comfort is a rare one that should appeal to all people who are
within reach of it.
