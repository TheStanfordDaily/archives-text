# CARL STEVENSON IN MILE SWIM AGAIN
## 
### 
Carl Stevenson, of Stanford, will
again enter the Healdsburg
to be held at Healdsburg, on the Rus
sian river, on July 5.
Last year he won this event against
such experienced swimmers as Lester
Smith and Art Hargreaves of the
Olympic Club.
He is expected to win again this
year, and thus add a second victory
towards the three necessary to give
him the handsome cup presented for
the first time last year.
Bob Williams and Phil Brooks of
Stanford are competing this year.
The former should gain a place,
while it is thought that the latter,
essentially a sprinter, will find the dis
tance too great.
