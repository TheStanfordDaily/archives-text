# POSTOFFICE BOXES AVAILABLE JULY 1
## 
### 
There will be plenty of postoffice
boxes available July 1 for students who
want them, according to Mrs. C. A.
Thomas, Stanford postmistress. A
considerable number of additional
boxes were recently provided.
Mrs. Thomas urges students and
faculty who are new on the campus
to make sure, in the interest of prompt
delivery of their mail, to have it ad
dressed to their box numbers or to
general delivery. Since the campus
does not have carrier delivery, letters
can be made more quickly ready for
delivery if time is not taken out look
ing up names in the directory as is
frequently necessary if the complete
address is not given.
The postoffice is Stanford Univer
sity, California. Correspondents who
address University mail to Palo Alto
may cause an additional delay in de
livery, since the letters have to be
forwarded to the campus if they go
to Palo Alto instead of coming here
directly.
