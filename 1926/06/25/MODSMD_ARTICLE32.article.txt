# SEQUOIA HALL UNDER REPAIRS THIS SUMMER
## 
### 
Sequoia Hall, one of Stanford's old
est landmarks, is taking a new lease on
life. This venerable monument, after
having served for nearly thirty years as
a women's dormitory, being the first to
bear the name of Roble, has of late been
used for men's living quarters.
The hall will remain unoccupied dur
ing the summer except for a small
group of men, who must live there in
order to fulfill the fire insurance re
quirements. Sequoia will be no quieter
than usual however, as a large number
of workmen will constantly be on hand
making the necessary repairs. The raps
of hammers and the whirr of saws take
the place of the more usual sounds of
phonographs and falling water.
New plumbing is being installed in
addition to the more obvious external
j improvements. Upon the completion
of these repairs Sequoia should be fit
for occupancy for at least another thirty
years.
