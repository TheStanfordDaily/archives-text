# LICHTENSTEIN TELLS OF SYMPHONY TO BE HELD IN BURLINGAME
## 
### 
Victor Lichtenstein ,in his lecture
Wednesday afternoon in the Little \
Theatre, explained the difficult and |
austere first symphony of Brahms, '•
which will be the first number on the i
musical program in Hillsborough Sun- j
day afternoon.
A symphony, said he, has no intel- j
lectual significance at all. It has a!
purely aesthetic justification .transport-!
ing the hearer to an illusory world,
where he experiences a "bath of the i
emotions." The composer suggests the
entire range of human emotions by i
contrasting his musical material, thus j
making a symphony comparable to an i
epic poem, or a temple, or a drama.
A symphony consists of four parts, j
the first demonstrating the knowledge
and art of the composer and requiring
the greatest attention and concentra- j
tion on the part of the hearer. The j
second is an Andante, or slow move
ment, lyric in quality; the third is gayer j
in character, a dance of some sort. In 1
Brahms' first symphony it is a delicate
and intimate German folk song, a sim- 1
pie and amiable conversation in music, j
His fourth movement begins slowly,!
which is unusual, but it soon becomes i
faster, and finishes with that note of j
triumph and cheer which is essential |
to all symphonies.
Brahms lived during the height of j
the Romantic movement, but he |
scorned to use the new instruments |
which were being introduced at that!
time to get more delicate tints of tone I
color, and turned to the old severe form !
of Beethoven, adding to the classical |
group of instruments only the trom- j
bone. Hence the more pleasant sonori-1
ties of romantic symphonies are lack
ing in his symphony and no composer
is so forbidding as Brahms on first
hearing; but his unequalled majesty,
nobility and reticence of style become |
more apparent with successive hear- j
ings. He is the sanest of all the nine- I
teenth century composers and is a [
worthy successor of the great Beethoven, j
Brahms' first symphony takes about J
forty-five minutes in all to play and in j
that time gives the listener the "quint-1
escence of emotional experience." Each I
instrument plays an individual role,
speaking and retiring, or speaking with
others. Repetition, says Lichtenstein,
is the essence of a symphony and he |
explained how the main theme, which j
is given in the introduction, is repeated)
throughout the other three movements.!

graph various parts of this Brahms
symphony as it was interpreted by i
Weingartner, conducting the London
Symphony Orchestra. He called at-1
tention to the contributions of the pon- j
tifical bassoon, the tender flute, the i
melancholy oboe, the passionate cello,'
the heroic horn and the triumphant
trumpets, showing how the timbre of
these instruments suggested different
moods. Because of the intricacy and

Victor Lichtenstein ,in his lecture
Wednesday afternoon in the Little \
Theatre, explained the difficult and |
austere first symphony of Brahms, '•
which will be the first number on the i
musical program in Hillsborough Sun- j
day afternoon.
A symphony, said he, has no intel- j
lectual significance at all. It has a!
purely aesthetic justification .transport-!
ing the hearer to an illusory world,
where he experiences a "bath of the i
emotions." The composer suggests the
entire range of human emotions by i
contrasting his musical material, thus j
making a symphony comparable to an i
epic poem, or a temple, or a drama.
A symphony consists of four parts, j
the first demonstrating the knowledge
and art of the composer and requiring
the greatest attention and concentra- j
tion on the part of the hearer. The j
second is an Andante, or slow move
ment, lyric in quality; the third is gayer j
in character, a dance of some sort. In 1
Brahms' first symphony it is a delicate
and intimate German folk song, a sim- 1
pie and amiable conversation in music, j
His fourth movement begins slowly,!
which is unusual, but it soon becomes i
faster, and finishes with that note of j
triumph and cheer which is essential |
to all symphonies.
Brahms lived during the height of j
the Romantic movement, but he |
scorned to use the new instruments |
which were being introduced at that!
time to get more delicate tints of tone I
color, and turned to the old severe form !
of Beethoven, adding to the classical |
group of instruments only the trom- j
bone. Hence the more pleasant sonori-1
ties of romantic symphonies are lack
ing in his symphony and no composer
is so forbidding as Brahms on first
hearing; but his unequalled majesty,
nobility and reticence of style become |
more apparent with successive hear- j
ings. He is the sanest of all the nine- I
teenth century composers and is a [
worthy successor of the great Beethoven, j
Brahms' first symphony takes about J
forty-five minutes in all to play and in j
that time gives the listener the "quint-1
escence of emotional experience." Each I
instrument plays an individual role,
speaking and retiring, or speaking with
others. Repetition, says Lichtenstein,
is the essence of a symphony and he |
