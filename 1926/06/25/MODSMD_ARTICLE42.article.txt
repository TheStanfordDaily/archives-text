## 
### 
Miss Julia Sullivan, an Irish girl,
lias registered in Stanford because she
would rather teach in California than
in London, as she has been doing. She
is working to gain her credentials for
teaching in this state. In England she
has been a teacher since graduating
from Avary Hill College.
It took her nearly a month to get
from London to the Stanford campus,
but she was here in time. She had
never been in America before she
made this trip to Stanford.
The things that have mainly im
pressed her so far, she says, are the
tall buildings of New York and San
Francisco, the broad stretches of open
country, the greater freedom on ac
count of the fewer people than she is
accustomed to iii the densely populated
regions she is accustomed to, and the
spontaneous hospitality of Califor
nians.
"It would take months to get ac
quainted in an English university,"
Miss Sullivan said, "while here you
make friends in a day."
