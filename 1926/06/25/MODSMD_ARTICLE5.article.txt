# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS OF AGASSIZ AS A TEACHER OF SCIENCE
## Great Naturalist Induced Students to See With Their Own Eyes 
### 
Declaring that Agassiz's greatest
\ worth as a teacher lay in his inducing
students to gain knowledge first luyid
; from nature and laboratories rather
than from textbooks, Dr. Jordan last
night held the first of his Thursday
evening conferences at his home dur
: ing the summer quarter. His topic was
i "Agassiz as a Teacher."
Dr. Jordan pointed out that Agassiz's
advent in this country with his new
mode of teaching completely altered
; instruction in the natural sciences, par
; ticularly those of geology, biology, and
botany. Dr. Jordan was one of Agas
i siz's students in those early days.
In his personal contacts with his
| students, the "Master," as Dr. Jordan
refers to him in his own autobiography
S "The Days of a Man," was filled with
i a keen enthusiasm for accurate and
scientific knowledge. Despite the fact
i that he was not a Darwinian, he be
lieved in the freedom of science to
question and ascertain facts before at
tempting to answer the problems
| which come before it.
In "The Days of a Man" Dr. Jordan
discusses him as an idealist and non
| believer in the theory of Darwin. "To
the Darwinian theory as it looked to
; him he was most earnestly opposed.
Essentially an idealist, he regarded all
j his own investigations not as studies
| of animals and plants as such, but as
glimpses into the divine plans of
which their structures are the expres
sions. 'That earthly form is the cover
lof the spirit was to him a truth of
! once fundamental and self-evident.' To
his mind, also, divine ideas were espe
j cially embodied in animal life, the
j species being the 'unit thought.'
"The marvel of structural affinity—
] unity of plan—in creatures of widely
I diverse habits and outward appearance
j he took to be simply a result of the
association of ideas in the divine mind.
To Darwin, on the other hand, those
relations illustrated the tie of a com
mon heredity acting under diverse
conditions of environment."
