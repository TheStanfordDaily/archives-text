# APPOINTMENT OFFICE TO GIVE MORE HELP THAN LAST SUMMER
## Students Seeking Work and Number of Jobs Are Both Increased 
### 
Present indications are that the em
ployment office will be of even greater
service to self-supporting students this
summer than a year ago, according to
the secretary. More students have ap
plied for part-time or full-time work,
and also an increase in available posi
tions has been noted, although accu
rate figures are not yet compiled.
Widely varied occupations are of
fered to men and women who wish to
earn all or part of their expenses. Po
sitions as bookkeepers, caretakers,
cooks, dishwashers, gardeners, seam
stresses, and tutors are among the
many sorts of employment which the
office is able to secure.
Records of the summer quarter for
1925 showed that of the 1200 students
registered, 35.4 per cent of the men
and 12.4 per cent of the women were
partially or wholly self-supporting.
Annual Earnings Big
During the entire year the total an
nual earnings of those placed in non
teaching positions by the Appointment
Office were $126,348.
Another aid extended through the
Appointment Office is that of the Rob
ert F. Stever loan library, which con
sists of textbooks required by students
for their university work. The total
number of volumes exceeds five hun
dred, having been swelled consider
ably by donations at the end of the
year.
The Appointment Office, well
equipped and able though it is to meet
its task, does not cover the field as
I'ully as it could with more facilities.
Nine persons are employed regularly
in the office and the force is not suffi
cient to release executives from the
burden of office detail work neces
sarily burdening such an organization.
Needs Bigger Income
The rapidly growing size of the Uni
versity community increases the com
petition for jobs and positions for
every effort is made to "fit the man to
the job" and insure satisfaction to the
employer.
As pointed out in the annual report
of the secretary, "A large income
â€¢would make possible many develop
ments of the work of the office that
are not income-producing, but which
are nevertheless exceedingly import
ant educationally and vocationally,
and which would pay for themselves
many times over in increased friend
liness toward the University on the
part of the students, alumni, faculty,
and the general public."
