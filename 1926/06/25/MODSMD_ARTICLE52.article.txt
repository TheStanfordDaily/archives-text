# SPORTS OF 1926
## Nothing But The Ruth 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Five years ago today Bambino hit number 16 off of Pitcher Davis of the
Browns at the Polo Grounds with none on. Six years ago yesterday he hit
numbers 13, 14, and 15 off of Zachary, Carlson, and Snyder, of Washington,
also at New York. Do you think he'll beat his records of 59, made in 1921,
or even of 54, made the year before? It is strange that in neither of those
two years did he hit a circuit clout with the bases full. Yet in 1919, when he
made only 29 homers, he socked four with the bases loaded. I believe that in
his entire major league career he has hit only half a dozen under such happy
circumstances.
That's where the crowd get its biggest thrill. Remember when Ruth
Ruth struck out with the bases loaded in 1923? There was drama for you—
the Yanks needed two runs to win, but Bob Meusel's bat got them the next
instant. •
What's the Big Bam going to do? Who would have thought that he'd
cmoe back like this? Playing the outfield better than ever, running the bases
with a fine mixture of brains and speed, crossing the opposition now and then
by a deft bunt down the third base line —and hitting home runs as he did five
and six years ago! Can you beat it?
