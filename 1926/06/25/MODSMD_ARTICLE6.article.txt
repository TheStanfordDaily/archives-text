# NOT ENOUGH TRADE YET TO KEEP CELLAR DOORS FROM CLOSING
## 
### 
There has not so far been enough
patronage of The Cellar to warrant its
being kept open beyond the experi
mental week that was announced, ac
cording to the management. Unless
there is more trade, the financial Joss
will compel closing.
However, it is realized that the first
days of the quarter have afforded lit
tle leisure for such enjoyment as The
Cellar provides, and furthermore there
is a possibility that a hot spell may
yet demonstrate that there is a de
mand for The Cellar which has not
yet been evident. The mental atmos
phere about the place is mildly hope
ful but not vividly optimistic.
The dining room and cafeteria in
the Union are doing a good business
and it is clear that, whether summer
quarter students require soda and sun
daes, they maintain a habit of regular
eating.
