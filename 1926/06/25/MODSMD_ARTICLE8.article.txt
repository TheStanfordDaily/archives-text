# HENRY HADLEY TO DIRECT MUSIC OF HIS COMPOSITION
## Leads Symphony Orchestra Sunday in Rendition of His "Angelus" SEASON TICKETS SELLING Students and Faculty Take Advantage of Special Rates Offered 
### 
The first concert of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra in Hills
borough available for holders of the
special $4 tickets issued to Stanford
students and faculty will be given next
Sunday afternoon.
This concert will to a considerable
degree center around Henry Hadley,
fro whom it will be a sort of home
coming, since he will conduct the or
chestra, of which he was one of the
organizers and early leaders, after an
absence of a number of years from
the West.
Hadley is now with the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra and is a com
poser of sound reputation. Particular
interest is attached to the third num
ber on the program, his own composi
tion rendered under his own direction
—the beautiful "Angelus," the second
movement from his Symphony No. 3.
There is a good deal of expectancy
among music-lovers, who are looking
forward to hearing the man who is
recognized as one of America's out
standing composers conduct the or
chestra in one of the most attractive
pieces from his own hand.
Suggested by Church Bells
He has told the circumstances sur
rounding its composition. It was sug
gested by his hearing every afternoon
the bells of a distant church wafted
across the fields to a secluded spot
where he was at work on this sym
phony during the summer of 1906 in a
little Italian village near Milan. The
mood of the piece is one of quiet, re
ligious contemplation, the theme of
the chimes weaving itself through the
entire movement. It opens with a
figure for chimes and harp with sus
taining chords for wind instruments.
The chief theme is given to solo cello.
Later a contrasting theme appears in
the oboe. The whole theme is of a
gentle romantic character.
Fits Outdoors Setting
The composition is peculiarly appro
priate to the outdoor setting in the
grounds of the Hillsborough school
where these Sunday afternoon concerts
are given. Besides Hadley's composi
tion, Sunday's concert will include the
popular Brahms Symphony in C minor,
Strauss' tone poem, "Don Juan," and
the spirited "Carneval Romaine" over
ture of Berlioz.
The special rate tickets for the sea
son of Sunday symphony concerts are
now on sale in Director Sellards' of
fice in the Administration building,
and a considerable number have been
sold.
