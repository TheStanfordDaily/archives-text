## 
### 
"European Civilization and Ameri
can Civilization: a Personal Experi
ence," is the subject that Professor
Paul Perigord, Chairman of the De
partment of Romanic Languages at the
University of California Southern
Branch, has chosen for his lecture to
morrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock in
the Little Theatre. The lecture will be
given in English. Professor Perigord
will attempt in his lecture, he says, to
interpret American civilization from
the European standpoint.
Professor Perigord has been in
America for some years, and during
that time has been gathering and for
mulating his ideas of what the civiliza
tion of this nation really seems to be.
He has traveled throughout the United
States and Europe, both as a repre
sentative of the French government
and in a private capacity. He speaks
English fluently.
Studied in America
After studying at the University of
Paris, Professor Perigord came to the
United States and attended Columbia,
Chicago, and Minnesota. He returned
to France during the war, and served
as a captain in the French army. He
was wounded, and was sent to Amer
ica in 1917 as officer-instructor at Har
vard for the Harvard battalion of the
New England division.
Subsequently President Wilson
asked him to tour the country with
Roosevelt, Bryan, Franklin K. Lane,
and other leading Americans, to ex
plain the aims of the war. He spent
eight months in touring all the larger
cities of the United States.
With American Division
Just before the Armistice, Professor
Perigord returned to France with an
American division. At the cessation of
hostilities he was sent back to the
United States by the French govern
ment as a member of the French High
Commission. On finishing his work
with that body, he went to the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology at Pasa
dena, where he was professor of His
tory. He remained there until last
year, when he went to the Southern
Branch to lecture 011 French Civiliza
tion.
Professor Perigord will remain at
Stanford several weeks. He and his
family are living at the home of Pro
fessor Albert L. Guerard of the Eng
lish department. The family returns
to France next year. Mrs. Perigord is
an American woman.
