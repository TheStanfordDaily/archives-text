# GEIGER ENJOYS CALIFORNIA ATMOSPHERE OF CULTURE
## 
### 
Dr. Moritz Geiger, Professor of
Philosophy at the University of Got
tingen, Germany, and acting Professor
of Philosophy at Stanford for the sum
mer quarter, says that he finds in the
in the West, and especially in Cali
fornia, an atmosphere of culture and
esthetic appreciation. Dr. Geiger was
pleased to find California and Stan
ford free of the maelstrom of ma
terialism which is supposed to typify
the activity of the United States.
Nineteen years ago Dr. Geiger was
a student at Harvard. This is his first
visit to the West and he feels that
his short stay here has convinced him
that America is not to be judged alone
by the East. He said, "Most Europeans
gain their impressions of the United
States from their knowledge of the
East, but that, I have learned from my
brief stay here, is a false impression."
He expressed his delight in finding a
community in which people had time

to "live as well as to do."
The weather of California is an ele
ment which has gained the admiration
of Dr. Geiger. Climatic conditions in
Germany at this time of year are ex
tremely uncertain and usually the
weather is unpleasant.
On their trip to the West, Dr. and
Mrs. Geiger spent several days in Los
Angeles. They were pleased by the
attractiveness of the residential sec
tions, but expressed a dislike for the
congestion of the downtown districts
of the city. The weather of Southern
California appealed to them, as well as
the beauty of the resident portions of
the cities.
Mrs. Geiger, who is especially inter
ested in art and architecture, finds
pleasure in California architecture.
Both she and Dr. Geiger enjoy the
subtle combination of Spanish and In
dian types of architecture which are
found in the more or less typical Cali
fornia homes. These they like much
better than the Colonial types preva
j lent in the East.
j Dr. Geiger was at a loss to compare
j the students of America and Germany,
j saying, "Our educational system is so
| different from yours that it is difficult
for me to compare the two. In Ger
many our secondary schools of 'Gym
nasia' are much more advanced than
your high schools. Our universities are
devoted almost entirely to technical
specialization, whereas here in the
United States you have opportunities
for a broader and more cultural educa
tion. As a philosopher, this method
appeals to me greatly."
Dr. Geiger is especially pleased to
be here at Stanford, which he believes
to have an ideal location for a uni
versity. He expressed himself as being
in accord with the statement of Wil
liam James, eminent psychologist and
one-time Stanford professor, who said
that Stanford was ideal because it had
the three elements of beauty of sur
roundings, opportunity for rest and
recreation, and the advantages of a
nearby city.
After the end of the summer quarter
Dr. Geiger plans to go East to give a
series of lectures in several eastern
colleges before returning to Germany
to resume his duties at the University
of Gottingen.
