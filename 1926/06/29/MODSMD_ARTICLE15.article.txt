# SAN FRANCISCO YOUTH DROWNS ON SUNDAY AT SEARSVILLE LAKE
## James O'Brien Dies While Friends Seek Guards; Body Recovered 
### 
James O'Brien, aged 19, was
drowned in Lake Searsville Sunday
afternoon at 4 o'clock when the canoe,
in which he and his friend Fred Pierce
had been riding, tipped over. James
O'Brien was the son of Mrs. Annie
O'Brien of San Francisco.
The two boys, after renting the
canoe, paddled around for a short time
in full view of the main bathing sec
tion of the lake. They then paddled
toward the dam, keeping within fifty
yards of the shore, and by doing so
became hidden from the life guard at
the boathouse.
When the canoe tipped over Fred
Pierce was too exicited to do anything
to help his friend. A nearby canoe, in
stead of rendering immediate assist
ance, hurried away to call the life
guard from the far side of the lake.
In the meantime a woman seeing the
upturned canoe had warned the near
est guards who swam at once to the
spot and started diving to find the
body. It appears that James O'Brien
had sunk without once coming to the
surface.
Within twenty minutes after the ac
cident, the body was recovered by the
use of a drag, and was taken to the
shore where for two hours Ernie
Brandsten and doctors made every
possible efforts toward resuscitation;
their efforts, however, proved futile.
Before renting the canoe Mr. O'Brien
had assured the life guard that he was
able to swim. Ernie Brandsten states
that in future everyone renting a canoe
at Searsville will have to demonstrate
to the life guards that he is able to
swim at least two hundred yards.
An inquest was held by James Crow
at Redwood City yesterday afternoon
at 2 o'clock.
