# LANDSCAPE EXHIBIT BY ISABEL SNELGROVE SHOWN AT GALLERY
## 
### 
An exhibition of landscapes painted
by Isabel P. Snelgrove, a teacher of
art in the schools of Olivet, Michigan,
showing unusual coloring and manner
of treatment, was opened at the Stan
ford Art Gallery a week ago today and
will continue until July 18.
Miss Snelgrove painted many of
these pictures during her visit to
California at the time of the Panama
Pacific International Exposition, in
1915, using as subject matter the Cali
fornia coast and hills, and including
several studies of Golden Gate Park,
San Francisco. The other pictures in
this exhibition are landscapes painted
in Colorado and other eastern states.
The artist paints in a direct method
whereby values are placed on the can
vas without successive changes. That
is, she visualizes the picture, then
creates each part with one stroke of
the brush, thus attaining a strong tech
nique. "Sand and Shadow" is an exam
ple of this treatment.
