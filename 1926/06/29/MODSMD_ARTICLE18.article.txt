# LESTER SEIB WILL ACT HAMLET WITH MODERN COSTUME
## Playing of New Version Is First Attempt on Amateur Stage "AREN'T WE ALL?" LATER Gordon Davis Announces First Summer Play for July Sixteenth 
### 
Lester Seib, '22, known on Broadway
as Lester Vail, will play the leading
role in "Hamlet," to be produced in
modern dress in the Assembly Hall
the evening of July IK. This production
will take the place of "Aren't We All?"
which will be produced at a later date
this summer.
The production of "Hamlet" in the
dress of the present day is unprece
dented on the academic amateur
stage. Not only has 110 other amateur
group attempted the production of this
difficult piece, but it has been only
within the past year that it has been
attemtped professionally. The charac
ter of Hamlet is among the most baf
fling ever created, and it is a role
which no undergraduate could hope to
perform in any other than a farcical
manner. Mr. Seib is well suited to play
this part through his wide profes
sional dramatic experience.
Difficulties in casting promise to be
lessened by excellent material brought
to light by the recent tryouts, although
no other parts have as yet been an
nounced save that of Mr. Seib as Ham
let.
Thought of as a mere publicity
stunt when it was conceived in Lon
don last year, and in New York a few
months later, "Hamlet" in contempor
ary clothing, has gained the admira
tion of many and is thought by some
to be the finest and truest representa
tion of Shakespeare's greatest dra
matic study.
Early criticism predicted that the
wearing of modern clothes would de
tract from the actual presentation of
the drama. Gordon A. Davis, director
of dramatics, in answer to that criti
cism, says, "From the point of view
of both actors and the audience, cum
bersome Elizabethan costumes are ele
ments which tend to remove attendtion
from the play and center it upon the
j colorful features of the costuming. The
j actors are conscious of their trappings
i as is the audience," he added.
| Some critics objecj to the pre
sentation of the drama in modern dress
I on the grounds of the strange and
: unorthodox method of playing this
; classic which has for so leng been as
j sociated with the costumes of the
j Elizabethan period. Davis himself says
| that he experienced a sensation of
| disgust when he first heard of the
! production of "Hamlet" in the garb
| of modernity. He says that he felt that
| a decadence was coming upon the
| theatre when a venerated classic such
i as this should be ruined for the sake
! of pecuniary gain. Later he came to
the conclusion that the presentation
of Hamlet in unobtrusive contempor
ary garb is the truest representation
I of Shakespeare's masterpiece.
Davis has postponed the plays for
| merly announced because he feels
{ that the opportunity of presenting
j "Hamlet," made possible by the pres
| ence of Seib, is good fortune not to be
I overlooked. Davis says, "In presenting
j 'Hamlet' in the dress of the day, we
| are not modernizing the masterpiece;
jwe are naturalizing it. Nothing is
I changed save the costuming, whicvh,
1 I feel, will enable us to present 'Ham
! let' as a play, and not as a mere char
| acter."
The criticism which followed the
| New York and London productions
| was diverse, yet the general opinion
j was that the play was more than a
i money-making scheme. From among
I the wealth of reviews which appeared
after these presentations, that of John
j Mason Brown, writing in the Theater
Arts Monthly for January of this year,
i stands out as being one of the more
i rational reactions.
Brown says in his article, "The ex
periment had the rare merit of bring-
J ing 'Hamlet' before an audience so
j that it could be relished as a play, in
â–  stead of being venerated as a classic,
j The stretches between soliloquies be
: came as alive as the soliloquies, and
the chief concern became very rightly,
not how would Basil Cydney read
such and such a speech, or handle
such and such a scene, but what would
j Hamlet do, and what would happen
| to him."
The casting of this play is an enter
| prise of more than a little difficulty,
i but besides this the technical and art
j direction present other problems
1 which are difficult of solution, espe
, cially in such a limited time. Mr. and
Mrs. E. Leslie Kiler will supervise the
{ settings and art directions.
