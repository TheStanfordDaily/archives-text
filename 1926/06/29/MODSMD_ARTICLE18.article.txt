# LESTER SEIB WILL ACT HAMLET WITH MODERN COSTUME
## Playing of New Version Is First Attempt on Amateur Stage "AREN'T WE ALL?" LATER Gordon Davis Announces First Summer Play for July Sixteenth

Lester Seib, '22, known on Broadway
as Lester Vail, will play the leading
role in "Hamlet," to be produced in
modern dress in the Assembly Hall
the evening of July IK. This production
will take the place of "Aren't We All?"
which will be produced at a later date

lessened by excellent material brought
to light by the recent tryouts, although
no other parts have as yet been an
nounced save that of Mr. Seib as Ham

to be the finest and truest representa

Early criticism predicted that the
wearing of modern clothes would de
tract from the actual presentation of
the drama. Gordon A. Davis, director
of dramatics, in answer to that criti
cism, says, "From the point of view
of both actors and the audience, cum
