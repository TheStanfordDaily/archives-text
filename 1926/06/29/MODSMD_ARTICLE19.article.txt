# STANFORD MAN'S SON DIES OF LOCKJAW
## 
### 
Bill De Sombre, 10-year-old son of
W. E. De Sombre, a summer quarter
student, died of lockjaw at the Palo
Alto hospital Saturday night after a
brief illness.
The infection was contracted ten
days before the child's death, when
the little fellow stepped on a rusty
nail while playing near his home at
Anaheim. Immediate attention was
given the wound, Anti-Tetanus serum
being injected within twenty minutes
after the accident. Apparently the boy
had suffered no ill effects from the
incident and the plans for coming to
Palo Alto were carried out as origi
nally intended. The boy became ill
after arrival in the north.
The mother reached Palo Alto Sun
day morning, after Bill's death.
