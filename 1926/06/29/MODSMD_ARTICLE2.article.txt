1919; copy was finished four years
later, In 1924 the work went to press,

Geoffrey Chaucer is the only great
English poet to whose works there is
no concordance. In producing this vol
ume a great need has been filled in the
field of English philology. A similar
work was contemplated by Ewald
r Flugel, who before his death was a pro
fessor here. Flugel conceived the idea
of creating a combined concordance
and dictionary to the works of Chau
cer. Since his death, it has been found
possible to separate the two works.
Drs. Tatlock and Kennedy have under
taken the edition of a concordance,
while the creation of the dictionary is
being carried on by a group of Cornell
scholars under the direction of Profes
sor Northrup of that university.
The production of the concordance
is being carried on under the guidance
of the Carnegie Institute. Dr. Tatlock

Works of Geoffrey Chaucer." Dr. Mar
gery Bailey of the English department
