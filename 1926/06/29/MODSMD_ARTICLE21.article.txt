Among the Stanford students of the regular scholastic year, the sum
mer quarter has a reputation for laxity. Not only, is there a release from
the press and hurry of many activities but there is also a general let-down
in the observance of "Stanford traditions" —those practices which make
life at the University unique and different from that at other universities.
This is only natural because of the large percentage of students registered
in the summer quarter who are unfamiliar with those traditions.
Therein li<;s the reason why some unsuspecting woman is surprised to
receive a round of applause as she walks down the Law Steps. Another
tradition is that of the "glory of the cords," the right to wear which is re
served for upperclassmen. A custom which is perhaps better known than
either of those two is that of the taboo on smoking in the Quad. The use
of senior bench t located north of the Library, and the wearing of som
breros are reserved for the graduating class.
■/. Still another tradition which marks life at the University during the
regular scholastic year is the custom of students to greet each other with a
"Hello!" regardless of whether or not they know each other. 1 his is one
of the most worthwhile of Stanford traditions.
Since there is a corresponding let-down in the strictness with which
these traditions are enforced the question of observing them or not is
placed more and more upon the individual. For those who register here
for but a quarter or for the first time with the object of continuing their
work the question is one of just how much of Stanford life do they wish
to experience. These traditions are part and parcel of the true Stanford
student's stay at the University and there is no reason why the summer
quarter should be an exception to the rule.
