With this issue of The Daily Palo Alto a humour column, which
will be a regular feature of the paper, is first presented. It is not the
object of the paper to confine the contents of the column solely to clip
pings from the humour magazines of other universities but to supplement
such matter with the products of local humourists.
Any who wish may therefore try their wits in filling the column.
Worthy contributions will be published.
The readers of The Daily Palo Alto are also invited to hand in
communications of a more serious nature. These will be printed, if it is
so desired, under the captain "Campus Opinion." All such communica
tions should he signed but the name will be withheld from publication
when requested by the writer.
