An aspect of the summer quarter that makes thta period of study
differ from the other quarters of the year is the influx of professors called
from other universities. To say that this practice is worthwhile is to utter
a platitude.
A university which never changes or adds to its faculty grows stag
nant, its classes get in a rut. During the summer quarter however, eastern
ideas come West to Stanford and the best of these are retained. Students
have the opportunity to sit before men of renown from other institutions
and to assimilate the progress of other American colleges and foreign uni
versities. The faculty of Stanford also benefits from these visitors, new
theories are advanced, new friendships are made. Later the visiting pro
fessors take back to their classrooms Stanford ideas. The summer quar
ter is truly cosmopolitan in thought.
