ing on table in the Stanford Union, and
made additional money by delivering the j
Daily Palo Alto. He was a member of '
the freshman boxing team in 1923 and
took part in the intercollegiate contests
that year. He bad the faculty of making j
true friends, and be had the respect of all j
who knew him. His major professor, Dr.
Swain of the chemistry department, says
that he had a remarkable capacity for
growth, while his former scoutmaster in
Salt Lake City, his home, calls him a
leader whose clean living, spirit of fair
ness, and unselfishness, was an inspiration
to the members of his troop.
McAllister's mother says that next to
his personal loyalties, bis love for Stan
ford was his guiding devotion. She tells
of his boyhood days when be would work
all summer long in order to add some
thing to his savings account so that he
could come here. "It is entirely fitting,"
she says, "that that money should be de
voted to a memorial for him at the college
which be loved."
