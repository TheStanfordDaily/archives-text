# DEAN CULVER TELLS HIS IMPRESSIONS OF EASTERN COLLEGES
## Attends Conference of Deans At Minnesota and Sees I.C.A.A.A.A. Meet 
### 
I)ean Culver returned recently from
his eastern trip during which he at
tended the Annual Conference of
Deans and Advisors of Men, the
].C.A.A.A.A. track meet, and visited
many universities and other points of
interest.
At the convention, which was held
at the University of Minnesota May
13 to 15 inclusive, Dean Culver was
honored with the invitation to preside
jointly with Dean C. R. Melcher, presi
dent of the organization. This courtesy
was extended to Mr. Culver because of
his official position with the similar
organization of the Pacific Coast
deans.
Speaking of the conference, Mr. Cul
ver said, "My semi-official position
gave me an excellent opportunity to
become well acquainted with the con
ference members so that I now feel
in rather close personal touch with the
various deans throughout the country."
Assistant Register Cowdery of Stan
lord, at a joint session of Deans and
the Personnel Group, presented a
paper which was well received.
The University of Wisconsin was
Dean Culver's next stop. There he was
entertained by Dean Goodnight. The
Dean was impressed by the beautiful
setting of the University near the
lakes.
At the University of Chicago Mr.
Culver had luncheon with Vice-Presi
dent Woodward, fromer Dean of the
Stanford Law School. While in Illinois
Dean Culver also visited Northwestern
University, in order to inspect its
housing plan for students.
Speaking of his two-day stop in
Washington, the Dean continued,
"Merle Thorpe, a Stanford graduate
and a prominent man in the United
States Chamber of Commerce, was
kind enough to arrange a luncheon for
me at Washington. Although I lived in
Washington for five years after gradu
ating from Stanford, the enormous
growth of the city during and since
the war made it seem to me like an
entirely new place. I should say that
the Lincoln Memorial was the most
impressive addition to the beauty of
Washington."
Mr. Culver then went to Princeton,
where in spite of a cold rainy day, he
was impressed by the beauty and at
tractiveness of the college. Princeton
is strictly a University town and has
an air which makes one feel at home,
according to Culver. Dean Gauss en
tertained Mr. Culver there.
At New York the Dean met a num
ber of Stanford men at a dinner given
for him by Dr. T. A. Storey, '96, at the
Harvard Club.
Concerning Yale, Mr. Culver re
ports, "At Yale I was shown about by
Harvey, a Yale sophomore and a
brother of 'By' Harvey of Stanford.
New Haven is a good-sized city grown
to the very doors of Yale. Harkness
Memorial, a group of dormitory build
ings, is one of the attractive architec
tural features of Yale. It represents
an outlay of approximately $8,000,000."
Dean Culver enjoyed his visit at
Boston not only because of the
I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet, but also be
cause of the historical associations of
the locality. He visited Lexington and
Concord, and the former homes of
Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Long
fellow, and Paul Revere.
In concluding the story of his trip
Mr. Culver said, "I was impressed with
the comparatively conservative dress
of the average American university
man in contrast with the extremes of
a few years ago. It may be worth men
tioning also that I saw no apparel sug
gestive of the need of laundries and
cleaners as is sometimes the case with
certain Stanford cords'."
Dean Culver believes that while
many eastern universities can look
back further into their history than
can Stanford, none is looking further
or straighter ahead than is Stanford.

Harvard Club.
Concerning Yale, Mr. Culver re
ports, "At Yale I was shown about by
Harvey, a Yale sophomore and a
brother of 'By' Harvey of Stanford.
New Haven is a good-sized city grown
to the very doors of Yale. Harkness
Memorial, a group of dormitory build
ings, is one of the attractive architec
tural features of Yale. It represents
an outlay of approximately $8,000,000."
Dean Culver enjoyed his visit at
Boston not only because of the
I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet, but also be
cause of the historical associations of
the locality. He visited Lexington and
Concord, and the former homes of
Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Long
fellow, and Paul Revere.
In concluding the story of his trip
Mr. Culver said, "I was impressed with
the comparatively conservative dress
of the average American university
man in contrast with the extremes of
a few years ago. It may be worth men
tioning also that I saw no apparel sug
gestive of the need of laundries and
cleaners as is sometimes the case with
certain Stanford cords'."
Dean Culver believes that while
many eastern universities can look
back further into their history than
can Stanford, none is looking further
or straighter ahead than is Stanford.
I)ean Culver returned recently from
his eastern trip during which he at
tended the Annual Conference of
Deans and Advisors of Men, the
].C.A.A.A.A. track meet, and visited
many universities and other points of
interest.
At the convention, which was held
at the University of Minnesota May
13 to 15 inclusive, Dean Culver was
honored with the invitation to preside
jointly with Dean C. R. Melcher, presi
dent of the organization. This courtesy
was extended to Mr. Culver because of
his official position with the similar
organization of the Pacific Coast
deans.
Speaking of the conference, Mr. Cul
ver said, "My semi-official position
gave me an excellent opportunity to
become well acquainted with the con
ference members so that I now feel
in rather close personal touch with the
various deans throughout the country."
Assistant Register Cowdery of Stan
lord, at a joint session of Deans and
the Personnel Group, presented a
paper which was well received.
The University of Wisconsin was
Dean Culver's next stop. There he was
entertained by Dean Goodnight. The
Dean was impressed by the beautiful
setting of the University near the
lakes.
At the University of Chicago Mr.
Culver had luncheon with Vice-Presi
dent Woodward, fromer Dean of the
Stanford Law School. While in Illinois
Dean Culver also visited Northwestern
University, in order to inspect its
housing plan for students.
Speaking of his two-day stop in
Washington, the Dean continued,
"Merle Thorpe, a Stanford graduate
and a prominent man in the United
States Chamber of Commerce, was
kind enough to arrange a luncheon for
me at Washington. Although I lived in
Washington for five years after gradu
ating from Stanford, the enormous
growth of the city during and since
the war made it seem to me like an
entirely new place. I should say that
the Lincoln Memorial was the most
impressive addition to the beauty of
Washington."
Mr. Culver then went to Princeton,
where in spite of a cold rainy day, he
was impressed by the beauty and at
tractiveness of the college. Princeton
is strictly a University town and has
an air which makes one feel at home,
according to Culver. Dean Gauss en
tertained Mr. Culver there.
At New York the Dean met a num
ber of Stanford men at a dinner given
for him by Dr. T. A. Storey, '96, at the
Harvard Club.
