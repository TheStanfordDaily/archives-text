Dr. Bailey Edits Book
Among the most recent publications
of the Press is a reprint of James
Boswell's "The Hypochondriack," edit
ed by Dr. Margery Bailey of the Eng
lish department. This work is a series
of 70 essays published anonymously
by Boswell in the "London Magazine"
from 1777 to 1783. The book is an
nounced as giving an entirely new
slant on Boswell's character, refuting
the traditional idea that he was a com
pletely trivial person. The influence of
Johnson is shown in this work by
numerous anecdotes and recognizable
quotations of his, many of which were
omitted from the "Life of Johnson."
A work that has attracted consider
able attention is the "Genetic Studies
of Genius," in two volumes, the first
entitled "Mental and Physical Traits
of a Thousand Gifted Children," and
the second, "Early Mental Traits Of
Three Hundred Geniuses," edited by
Lewis M. Terman of the Psychology
department. The second is still in the
press.
The first volume gives the results
of an investigation by Dr. Terman and
a group of other scientists of 1400
California school children of remark
able mental endowment. The second
is a series of studies of 301 acknowl
edged geniuses in the years 1450 to
1850, by Dr. Catharine Morris Cox,
psychologist of the Central Clinic in
Chicago. Such persons as Napoleon,
Pasteur, Lincoln, and Mozart are here
discussed.
In the field of law, the newest book
issued by the Press is Judge Jackson
H. Italston's "The Law and Procedure
of International Tribunals." This is an
enlarged and revised edition of a work
published by the author in 1910. Judge
Ralston has served as counsel and
agent for the United States in various
cases, was umpire for the Italian-
Venezuelan Mixed Claims Commission,
and wrote the official report of the
Venezuelan Arbitrations of 1903.
