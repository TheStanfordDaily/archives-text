## Samples of Art in Jewelry, Pottery of Many Lands Placed in Display 
### 
< An exhibition of world's handicrafts,
ferranged to show the adaptation of
design and ornament to different ma
terials executed by different peoples
of the world is now being shown at
the Stanford Art Gallery. The work is
represented in samples of pottery,
glass, metal, wood, textiles, jewelry,
basketry, toys, and models gathered
from the four corners of the earth.
One of the rare things in the exhibi
tion is a large yellow Imperial China
jvase decorated with the Imperial
dragon in blue. The Imperial dragon
lias five toes, which distinguish him
from the ordinary dragon with three,
find the appearance of this dragon on
a piece of antique china is proof that
ft was made for royalty.
Ancient Greek Ware Shown
Antique Greek vases of the very best
Jkind may be found in one case. Some
of these were collected by Leland
Stanford, Junior, when he was in
Greece with his family, and have since
become very difficult to procure.
Others, much more antique, were exca
iVated at Cyprus. There is also Phoeni
cian and Alliambrian pottery. One of
,the most beautiful things in the dis
play is a Chinese bowl of white jade,
li'ight inches in diameter.
The Egyptian alabaster vases shown
Juive a remarkable refinement of con
tour in their shaping. In the same
case with them are examples of Vene
tian and Cyprian glass work, both an
cient and modern. The chemical action
of the earth in which these were
buried, has given excavated glassware
it lovely irridescent coloring. There are
jexamples of both the common and the
silver Cloisonne, and the steps are
thrown by which the Chinese prepare
]the lovely cases by covering the metal
( with designs in colored enamel that is
jbaked on.
j "Play Element" Illustrated
The piece of art which best illus
trates the play element is a large ele
phant-shaped incense burner made of
metal and covered with lacquer. The
elephant has his head tucked down
on his chest, his eyes squinted, and
appears to be suppressing a chuckle
sit the expense of everyone who looks
pt him.
A case of ancient and modern wood
>vork contains a Chinese desk screen
which is a very fine piece of craft,
being made of hand-carved teakwood
with a decorated blue porcelain panel
inset in the center. There are also
some Indian totems, and Oriental and
Egyptian carvings.
South Sea Work Shown
The basketry and weaving from the
South Sea Islands, the Philippines, and
the Hawaiian Islands show a pleas
ing rhythm in the ornamentation. The
Guatemala textiles avoid monotony of
repeated design by changing the
colors. Human figures and ducks ap
pear to be a favorite subject in these
vvorks, being worked into the designs
,\vith delightful feeling and variety.
Other parts of the world have long
used art methods that are now becom
ing adopted by the more civilized peo
ples. Among the examples of this are
the Javanese batiks and some dye
.work from the East Indies. The tappa
cloth from the South Sea Islands is
inade from the internal bark or "liber"
of three sorts of trees: the Chinese
paper mulberry, the bread fruit tree,
and a tree much resembling the wild
lig tree of the West Indies. The bark
is pounded into thin sheets and is
-decorated with dyes which are printed
•on the cloth from designs carved on
the surfaces of the paddles used for
beating the cloth.

cloth from the South Sea Islands is

of three sorts of trees: the Chinese
paper mulberry, the bread fruit tree,

represented in samples of pottery,
glass, metal, wood, textiles, jewelry,
basketry, toys, and models gathered
from the four corners of the earth.
One of the rare things in the exhibi
tion is a large yellow Imperial China
jvase decorated with the Imperial
dragon in blue. The Imperial dragon

from the ordinary dragon with three,

Ancient Greek Ware Shown
Antique Greek vases of the very best
Jkind may be found in one case. Some
of these were collected by Leland
Stanford, Junior, when he was in
Greece with his family, and have since
become very difficult to procure.
Others, much more antique, were exca
iVated at Cyprus. There is also Phoeni
cian and Alliambrian pottery. One of
,the most beautiful things in the dis
play is a Chinese bowl of white jade,
li'ight inches in diameter.
The Egyptian alabaster vases shown
Juive a remarkable refinement of con
tour in their shaping. In the same
case with them are examples of Vene
tian and Cyprian glass work, both an
cient and modern. The chemical action
of the earth in which these were
buried, has given excavated glassware
it lovely irridescent coloring. There are
jexamples of both the common and the
silver Cloisonne, and the steps are
thrown by which the Chinese prepare
]the lovely cases by covering the metal
( with designs in colored enamel that is
jbaked on.
j "Play Element" Illustrated
The piece of art which best illus
trates the play element is a large ele
phant-shaped incense burner made of
metal and covered with lacquer. The
elephant has his head tucked down
on his chest, his eyes squinted, and
appears to be suppressing a chuckle
sit the expense of everyone who looks
pt him.
A case of ancient and modern wood

which is a very fine piece of craft,
being made of hand-carved teakwood
with a decorated blue porcelain panel
inset in the center. There are also
some Indian totems, and Oriental and
Egyptian carvings.
South Sea Work Shown
The basketry and weaving from the
South Sea Islands, the Philippines, and
the Hawaiian Islands show a pleas

Guatemala textiles avoid monotony of
repeated design by changing the
colors. Human figures and ducks ap
