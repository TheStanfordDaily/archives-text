# STANFORD RESEMBLES HARVARD CONTRARY TO BELIEF--TATLOCK
## 
### 
The resemblance between Stanford
and Harvard is noted by Dr. John S. P.
Tatlock, former head of the English
Department here, and now a professor
at Harvard, who is here for the Sum
mer Quarter. "Both institutions," he
said, "are free from the restrictions of
state control, being endowed, free uni
versities, and this divorce from state
control is a great advantage as both
institutions stand for freedom and
progress. This will probably be start
ling to-.some, for Harvard has had the
undeserved reputation of being hide
bound by tradition. On the contrary,
Harvard is quite as much a force for
freedom as is Stanford."
Dr. Tatlock, who graduated from
Harvard twenty years ago, finds a
great change in the attitude of the
students of that institution since his
undergraduate days. Nowadays, he
says, the students are very much more
industrious than they were in the days
when he attended. The air of serious
ness and complete studiousness is
quite different from the attitude of
twenty years ago. This spring brought
to his attention with special force, the
change in the attitude. In his day,
students were inclined to congregate
in the dooryards and on the steps of
buildings. "This year," he said, "there
was none of this. Everyone seemed to
be going somewhere. Still there may
be a loss," he added.
Dr. Tatlock believes that the reason
for this new industry can be found in
the tutorial system which has been
adopted since his college days. This
system is an adaptation of the Oxford
system which, he believes, provides a
tremendous stimulus to progress. This
system is one in which students after
their rst year in the university, are
their first year in the university, are
member of their major department.
Students are at the end of their
senior year required to pass a com
prehensive examination over the sub
ject on which they have been concen
trating. (Concentrating is used at Har
vard in the same sense as majoring at
Stanford.) This system, believes Dr.
Tatlock, gives more opportunity for in
dividual initiative than does the older
system. There is more freedom in the
method of securing information, em
phasis being placed on the result
rather than on method.
Dr. Tatlock believes that Stanford
has exceptional advantages as a uni
versity. He noted the enviable location
of Stanford in a spot of beauty with
the advantages of a city not far away,
and emphasized the value of limited
enrollment. Freedom from state ron
trol and the fact that Stanford is the
only institution of its kind within 2000
miles, were also mentioned as advan
tages by Dr. Tatlock.

versities, and this divorce from state
control is a great advantage as both
institutions stand for freedom and
progress. This will probably be start
ling to-.some, for Harvard has had the
undeserved reputation of being hide
bound by tradition. On the contrary,
Harvard is quite as much a force for
freedom as is Stanford."
Dr. Tatlock, who graduated from
Harvard twenty years ago, finds a
great change in the attitude of the
students of that institution since his
undergraduate days. Nowadays, he
says, the students are very much more
industrious than they were in the days
when he attended. The air of serious
ness and complete studiousness is
quite different from the attitude of
twenty years ago. This spring brought
to his attention with special force, the
change in the attitude. In his day,
students were inclined to congregate
in the dooryards and on the steps of
buildings. "This year," he said, "there
was none of this. Everyone seemed to
be going somewhere. Still there may
be a loss," he added.
Dr. Tatlock believes that the reason
for this new industry can be found in
the tutorial system which has been
adopted since his college days. This
system is an adaptation of the Oxford
system which, he believes, provides a
tremendous stimulus to progress. This
system is one in which students after
their rst year in the university, are
their first year in the university, are
member of their major department.
Students are at the end of their
senior year required to pass a com
prehensive examination over the sub
ject on which they have been concen
trating. (Concentrating is used at Har
vard in the same sense as majoring at
Stanford.) This system, believes Dr.
Tatlock, gives more opportunity for in
dividual initiative than does the older
system. There is more freedom in the
method of securing information, em
phasis being placed on the result
rather than on method.
Dr. Tatlock believes that Stanford
has exceptional advantages as a uni
versity. He noted the enviable location
of Stanford in a spot of beauty with
the advantages of a city not far away,
and emphasized the value of limited
enrollment. Freedom from state ron
trol and the fact that Stanford is the
only institution of its kind within 2000
miles, were also mentioned as advan
tages by Dr. Tatlock.
The resemblance between Stanford
and Harvard is noted by Dr. John S. P.
Tatlock, former head of the English
Department here, and now a professor
at Harvard, who is here for the Sum
mer Quarter. "Both institutions," he
said, "are free from the restrictions of
state control, being endowed, free uni
versities, and this divorce from state
control is a great advantage as both
institutions stand for freedom and
progress. This will probably be start
ling to-.some, for Harvard has had the
undeserved reputation of being hide
bound by tradition. On the contrary,
