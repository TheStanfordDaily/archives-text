### 
"The Peace Plan of Jane Addams"
has been announced as the subject for
the Thursday evening conference at
the home o fDr. David Starr Jordan.
Throughout the year Dr. Jordan de
votes Thursday evenings to lectures
and discussions of various tpoics. Stan
ford students and faculty, and mem
bers of the community are invited.
Jane Addams' peace plan is an in
ternationalism of good will, newer and
more powerful than the old "dove-like
ideal." She believed that the social
point of view should be kept para
mount, and social sentiments should
be enlightened, disciplined, and di
rected by the fullest knowledge. This
would necessitate social affections, the
beginning of cosmopolitan affections.
