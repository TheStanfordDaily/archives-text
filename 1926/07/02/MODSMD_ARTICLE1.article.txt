# AMERICA CAN BE CULTURAL LEADER IF SHE CHOOSES
## Professor Perigord Says Nation Must Build On Prosperity MUST CHANGE EMPHASIS Potentially Has as Much Artistic Ability as Older Countries 
### 
"The future, culturally, belongs to
America, but it docs not belong to lier
unless she prepares the right environ
ment for culture," said Professor Paul
Perigord, chairman of the Department
of Romanic Languages, Southern
Branch, in his talk on "European Civ
ilization and American Civilization: a
Personal Experience," Wednesday
afternoon. He ascribed America's
present lack of a definite civilization, as
compared with older countries, to this
nation's intensive application to ma
terial achievement.
"Potentially America has just as
much artistic ability as the older coun
tries," he said, "but we do not train our
young people for cultural pursuits.
When I ask a man of some wealth in
Pasadena what his son is going to do,
he says, perhaps, that he is going into
the bond business. 'But,' I say, 'do you
not think it would be a fine thing, with
all your money, to fit him to make some
great cultural contribution, in art or
music or writing, to the world?'
" 'But I don't think he cares for that,'
he will say.
"Of course he cares. If he had not
been brought up in a society where all
rewards and recognition go for material
achievement, to the real estate men and
the bond brokers, and not to the men
of science and of art, he would find it
just as natural to go into some cul
tural pursuit."
Different Points of View
Professor Perigord illustrated the
great divergence in the American and
the European point of view by telling
about his own experiences. When he
first came to America, he said, he found
it extremely difficult to adjust himself
to American life and customs. How
ever, when he went back to Francc he
found that the Frenchmen, even from
his own region, called him "the Ameri
can." During his stay in America he
had absorbed an atmosphere and a point
of view entirely different from that of
his countrymen. On his return to the
United States, however, he said, he was
not called Paul Perigord, the American,
but the Frenchman.
"It is a good thing, though, to have
a solid material basis for civilization."
he added. "You cannot have a real
civilization without the material things.
But is it quite fair to devote all energy
to them?"
American Idealism
Professor Perigord remarked that
when he announced to his friends in
Europe that he intended to return to
America, they expressed great surprise.
"We know America is a beautiful coun
try," they said, "but what is there for a
man of intellect, of culture?" He told
them that he was convinced that
America really had the capacity for cul
ture.
He spoke of the idealism the Ameri
can people showed in their reception of
French officers during the war. He il
lustrated by showing how, in his own
case, during his tour of the United
States in 1917 to explain the aims of
the war, he found it impossible to spend
money because the people everywhere
gave him whatever he needed, as a
tribute to his uniform of a French cap
tain. That, he said, showed that they
really felt the ideal of France as a de
fender of liberty.
Look to Us to Lead
As another proof of the American
soul, Professor Perigord told how the
Pasadena Community Playhouse has
grown from a tiny venture to a great
enterprise of an entire community. He
said that success has been achieved
with entirely inexperienced people act
ing, writing, and staging the produc
tions. He himself has worked with the
Playhouse for some years.
"They are looking to us in America
here for the culture of the future," he
said. "There is a divergence of the Eu
ropean and American civilizations of
today, but there is also much that both
have in common. America has the
sound economic basis for her civiliza
tion, and now she can go ahead with
the cultural things."
