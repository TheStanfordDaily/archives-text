# AMERICA CAN BE CULTURAL LEADER IF SHE CHOOSES
## Professor Perigord Says Nation Must Build On Prosperity MUST CHANGE EMPHASIS Potentially Has as Much Artistic Ability as Older Countries

"The future, culturally, belongs to
America, but it docs not belong to lier
unless she prepares the right environ
ment for culture," said Professor Paul
Perigord, chairman of the Department
of Romanic Languages, Southern
Branch, in his talk on "European Civ
ilization and American Civilization: a
Personal Experience," Wednesday
afternoon. He ascribed America's
present lack of a definite civilization, as
compared with older countries, to this
nation's intensive application to ma
terial achievement.
"Potentially America has just as
much artistic ability as the older coun
tries," he said, "but we do not train our
young people for cultural pursuits.
When I ask a man of some wealth in
Pasadena what his son is going to do,
he says, perhaps, that he is going into
the bond business. 'But,' I say, 'do you
not think it would be a fine thing, with
all your money, to fit him to make some
great cultural contribution, in art or
music or writing, to the world?'
" 'But I don't think he cares for that,'
he will say.
"Of course he cares. If he had not
been brought up in a society where all
rewards and recognition go for material
achievement, to the real estate men and
the bond brokers, and not to the men
of science and of art, he would find it
just as natural to go into some cul
tural pursuit."
Different Points of View
Professor Perigord illustrated the
great divergence in the American and
the European point of view by telling
about his own experiences. When he
first came to America, he said, he found
it extremely difficult to adjust himself
