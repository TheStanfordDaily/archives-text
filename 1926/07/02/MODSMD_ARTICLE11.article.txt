# DR. CUBBERLEY TALKS ON "4,4,4,4 PLAN" AT MEETING LAST NIGHT
## 
### 
More than 125 men attended the an
nual banquet held last evening in the
Stanford Union by the Education de
partment. The Phi Delta Kappa men
sent out over 200 invitations for the
affair and were gratified at the re
sponse from the men.
The program that followed the din
ner was worthy of the large gathering.
Dr. Ellwood P. Cubberley was the
principal speaker of the evening. He
talked upon suggested reorganizations
in the present educational system and
advocated the "4,4,4,4 plan." He ex
plained that the first four-year unit
would provide an expression school
and would include the kindergarten
and the first and second grades. The
next unit would be a drill and skill
period and would include grades from
three to six. The present seventh and
eighth grades would be combined with
the first two years of high school to
form the third uilit. This would be an
exploratory period where the child
would try out the various subjecth
in an attempt to find himself. The last
two years of high school and the first
two years of college would be included
in u junior, or people's college. This
college would be the finishing school
for the great majority of pupils and
woull add two years of training to
that which most students are now
getting.
If this reorganization should be car
ried out, the present universities
would become upper division and
graduate schools, in Dr. Cubberley's
opinion. He also pointed out that the
increasing number of graduate stu
dents seeking admission to Stanford
made such a plan seem to be the
logical solution for this University.
Superintendent Walter Bachrodt act
ed as the toastmaster of the evening.
He called for short talks from several
prominent men who are on the faculty
this summer. Dr. Marion Rex Trabue,
who is here from the University of
North Carolina, spoke briefly, and Dr.
Fred Carleton Ayres, of the University
of Washington, also made a few re
marks.
Harold Pattee gave a statistical re
port showing the growth in enrollment
in the Education department during
the past year. He reported a total of
275 graduate students enrolled this
quarter.
