# NO ISSUE OF THE DAILY PALO ALTO TUESDAY MORNING
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto will not
be issued next Tuesday on ac
count of the observance of Mon
day as a University holiday. The
printers observe Independence
Day on Monday, also, which
would make it impossible to get
the paper out on time.
If you do not receive your paper
on time telephone to the Business
Manager, Palo Alto 1074. Sub
scribers or others who are not
able to reach the Business Mana
ger by telephone are requested
to call the editorial department,
Palo Alto 900, Local 13, which
will see that the message is de
livered. â€¢
