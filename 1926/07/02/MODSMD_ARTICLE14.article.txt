# BUSINESS METHODS OF ANCIENT GREECE TOLD BY BULLOCK
## Past Moneymaking Schemes Compared to Those of Modern Finance 
### 
"Few more important things have
happened in Greek history than the
coming of the moneymakers," said Pro
fessor C. J. Bullock in his lecture,
"Ancient Moneymakers of Greece,"
Tuesday night in the Little Theatre.
Problems of the present find their
counterparts in the past. Before the j
introduction of money, the Greek ideal
of the rich man was one who did his
work in the fields and house, and was
never idle. Barter was the only means
of exchange, and accumulation of
wealth was impossible, since perish
able agricultural commodities were
traded, according to Professor Bullock.
The introduction of coinage necessi
tated economic changes. The scope of
mercantile enterprise was increased,
and social problems of upper and
lower classes were created. Civiliza
tion became commercialized.
Peasants Lose Land
Men gradually amassed wealth, and
the first use to which they put it was
buying land from peasants. The peas- j
ants in turn, having rid themselves of ,
their property, lost the money. The
landed class, gradually gaining in ,
power, dominated governmental poli- |
c-ies and produced tyrants, but found ,
itself unable to solve the problem of
poverty among the lower class.
The* speaker went 011 to say that j
principles of taxation, monopolies, j
joint stock enterprises, and funda- i
mentals of banking were familiar to 1
business men of countries surrounding j
the Mediterranean. Governments at
tempted agricultural monopolies, not
only to secure more wealth, but to
gain power. Crimes in public expendi
ture, and frauds, especially in marine
insurance,*were common. In showing
the importance of money, the profes
sor called attention to a thesis which
attempted to prove that leaders of an
cient civilizations gained their influ
ence through their wealth.
Dionysius Discussed
The story of Dionysius, a tyrant who
always needed money, was compared
to the situation caused in the United
States in 1920, by the excess profits
tax. Slaves had brought word to the
ruler that his people cursed him in
the market place, because of the
severity of his levies. Dionysius re
plied that as long as the people com
plained. the tax must be continued, for
surely they had more property to lose.
When servants reported that men
laughed and jested, the tax was re
pealed. "When an excess tax is so ab
surd as to become a joke," continued
Dr. Bullock, "it is best abolished.
Dionysius knew more about principles
of taxation than people of today. He
never would have made an internal
revenue official; he was an intelligent
man, too intelligent to levy an impos
sible tax like the excess profits tax."
Information concerning business
matters brought to court for settle
ment may be found in orations of
Demosthenes. From his pleas, one
1 learns that property was assessed at
one-fifth its value. Thus, if it could
be proved that a factory was taxable
|to the amount of three talents, its
| known worth was fifteen.

plied that as long as the people com
plained. the tax must be continued, for
surely they had more property to lose.
When servants reported that men
laughed and jested, the tax was re
pealed. "When an excess tax is so ab
surd as to become a joke," continued
Dr. Bullock, "it is best abolished.
Dionysius knew more about principles
of taxation than people of today. He
never would have made an internal
revenue official; he was an intelligent
man, too intelligent to levy an impos
sible tax like the excess profits tax."
Information concerning business
matters brought to court for settle
ment may be found in orations of
Demosthenes. From his pleas, one

one-fifth its value. Thus, if it could

"Few more important things have
happened in Greek history than the
coming of the moneymakers," said Pro
fessor C. J. Bullock in his lecture,
"Ancient Moneymakers of Greece,"
Tuesday night in the Little Theatre.
Problems of the present find their
counterparts in the past. Before the j
introduction of money, the Greek ideal
of the rich man was one who did his
work in the fields and house, and was
never idle. Barter was the only means
of exchange, and accumulation of
wealth was impossible, since perish
able agricultural commodities were
traded, according to Professor Bullock.
The introduction of coinage necessi
tated economic changes. The scope of
mercantile enterprise was increased,
and social problems of upper and
lower classes were created. Civiliza
tion became commercialized.
Peasants Lose Land
Men gradually amassed wealth, and
the first use to which they put it was
buying land from peasants. The peas- j
ants in turn, having rid themselves of ,
their property, lost the money. The
landed class, gradually gaining in ,
power, dominated governmental poli- |
c-ies and produced tyrants, but found ,
itself unable to solve the problem of
poverty among the lower class.
The* speaker went 011 to say that j
principles of taxation, monopolies, j
joint stock enterprises, and funda- i
mentals of banking were familiar to 1
business men of countries surrounding j
the Mediterranean. Governments at
tempted agricultural monopolies, not
only to secure more wealth, but to
gain power. Crimes in public expendi
ture, and frauds, especially in marine
insurance,*were common. In showing
the importance of money, the profes
sor called attention to a thesis which
attempted to prove that leaders of an
cient civilizations gained their influ
ence through their wealth.
Dionysius Discussed
The story of Dionysius, a tyrant who
always needed money, was compared
to the situation caused in the United
States in 1920, by the excess profits
tax. Slaves had brought word to the
ruler that his people cursed him in
the market place, because of the
severity of his levies. Dionysius re
plied that as long as the people com
plained. the tax must be continued, for
surely they had more property to lose.

laughed and jested, the tax was re
pealed. "When an excess tax is so ab
