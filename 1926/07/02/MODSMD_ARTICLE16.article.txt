### 
Exceptional for the number of actors
who have had previous experience on
the Stanford stage, Ihe cast for "Hani
let," to be given July* 16, was an
nounced yesterday by Gordon A. Davis,
director pf dramatics. With but four
exceptions, all members of the cast
have previously acted here. This
wealth of experienced material prom
ises a polished production of this piece
of the theatre.
Lester Vail (Les Seib, '22), a past
favorite on the Stanford stage and of
recent years 011 the professional stage,
will enact Ihe difficult role of Hamlet,
to which he is particularly well adapt
ed by virtue of his professional experi
ence. The character of Ophelia, an
intricate and subtle study, will be por
trayed by Velma Randall, an actress
whose name is not unfamiliar to the
campus from her previous dramatic
successes. Miss Randall has starred in
"Dulcy," the Junior Opera of 1925,
more recently in "Fashion," and in
other plays.
Polonius Is Difficult
One of the most difficult problems
in casting "Hamlet" was to find a
Polonius who would be able to play
that part in a convincing manner. Wil
liam Thornton, who has done excellent
character work in Capek's "R.U.R.,"
and in "Milestones," has been selected
by Davis to portray this role. Thorn
ton has also had experience in Greek
drama, having played in last year's
production of "Agamefnnon."
Anna Mae Price, who is Director of
Dramatics at the San Mateo Junior
College, has been chosen to play the
part of the Queen. Miss Price, who is
taking summer work here, should
make an excellent Gertrude with her
background of New York training and
her experience as a director. This will
be her first appearance on the Stan
ford stage.
Claudius will be enacted by James
