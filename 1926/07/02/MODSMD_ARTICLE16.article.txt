### 
Exceptional for the number of actors
who have had previous experience on
the Stanford stage, Ihe cast for "Hani
let," to be given July* 16, was an
nounced yesterday by Gordon A. Davis,
director pf dramatics. With but four
exceptions, all members of the cast
have previously acted here. This
wealth of experienced material prom
ises a polished production of this piece
of the theatre.
Lester Vail (Les Seib, '22), a past
favorite on the Stanford stage and of
recent years 011 the professional stage,
will enact Ihe difficult role of Hamlet,
to which he is particularly well adapt
ed by virtue of his professional experi
ence. The character of Ophelia, an
intricate and subtle study, will be por
trayed by Velma Randall, an actress
whose name is not unfamiliar to the
campus from her previous dramatic
successes. Miss Randall has starred in
"Dulcy," the Junior Opera of 1925,
more recently in "Fashion," and in
other plays.
Polonius Is Difficult
One of the most difficult problems
in casting "Hamlet" was to find a
Polonius who would be able to play
that part in a convincing manner. Wil
liam Thornton, who has done excellent
character work in Capek's "R.U.R.,"
and in "Milestones," has been selected
by Davis to portray this role. Thorn
ton has also had experience in Greek
drama, having played in last year's
production of "Agamefnnon."
Anna Mae Price, who is Director of
Dramatics at the San Mateo Junior
College, has been chosen to play the
part of the Queen. Miss Price, who is
taking summer work here, should
make an excellent Gertrude with her
background of New York training and
her experience as a director. This will
be her first appearance on the Stan
ford stage.
Claudius will be enacted by James
DuPrau who appeared here in "Mac
beth" as Duncan. Norris James, who
has played in "The Dover Road," Polly
with a Past," and other campus pro
ductions, will act the part of Horatio.
Marvin Park, who played in Dulcy,
has been cast as Rosencrantz. Felton
Kauffman, who was in "Fashion," will
play Osric.
Philips Brooks and Charles Benedict
will play the parts of Bernardo and
Francisco. Both Brooks and Benedict
have been in numerous local produc
tions. Harold Taylor, whose exception
al character work as the high priest
in "The Green Goddess" is still re
membered, will do the role of the
Player King in the play within the
play.
Make First Appearance
John Trueman, another character
actor of reputation, will be the First
Grave Digger. Trueman has given ex
ceptionally fine interpretations, in the
Junior Opera of 1925, in Ram's Head
shows, and in other campus produc
tions. The Second Grave Digger will
be acted by Guy Holliday. He has
played in "Hell Bent Fer Heaven,"
as well as in other plays.
Among those who are appearing for
the first time on the Stanford stage is
Morris Doyle. Doyle will take the part
of the Ghost. Another newcomer to
Stanford dramatics is Robert Sears
who will enact Marcellus. Leartes will
be rendered by Boyd Newborn, Guild
enstern by Jack Wilson.
Byron Harvey and Barbara Eubanks,
both known for their dancing in pre
vious shows, will be pantomime ac
tors in the play within the play. Miss
Eubanks played in "Dear Brutus" and
in last year's Greek Drama. Harvey
has starred in Ram's Head shows and
Junior Operas.
The parts of the Player Queen and
one Player have not yet been cast.
Davis expects, however, to announce
these in a day or so.
