A university is the cultural training ground for young men and
women. Trades and professions may be studied in vocational schools but
the man who most certainly and most rapidly becomes successful has a
well-informed background acquired in a university.
The liberal education of the college man is not entirely gained in the
classroom. University authorities realize this and gather for the student's
entertainment and instruction lecturers, musicians, and artists. The
college man is encouraged to partake of these extra-curricula activities.
Frequent art exhibits are open to the student. Possibly because they
are free he does not attend; possibly the art gallery is too easy of
access; probably if he went to one exhibit he would attend future dis
plays and would strengthen his cultural background.
Scholars and advanced thinkers from all over the world are induced
to come to the University campus and to speak upon subjects of which
they are authorities. Students are invited; the wiser ones accept. They
gather new ideas, they can talk upon thoughtful subjects.
A concert series, sanctioned by the University, is offered at a price
,that would attract the city dweller, but the student attendance is slighting.
The future lawyer, business man, doctor does not now think he Will ever
need to know of Liszt or Brahms.
Is the student wise in developing a single-track mind, is he getting
what he should get from his college course whe nhe neglects the creative
arts? Why waste time in acquiring a liberal education? When the con
versation of his future business associates, of his clients, of his patients
turns to Raphael, to Kant, to Beethoven he will quote from Babson, from
Blackstone, or from Hahnemann.
Attendance is not taken at the Tuesday evening lectures; one is free
to enter and to leave the art gallery when he chooses; the symphony
concerts cost only fifty cents. How easily and how cheaply a more
liberal education may be obtained!
