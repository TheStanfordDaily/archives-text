# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY HADLEY AT SECOND CONCERT
## 
### 
Henry Hadley, as guest conductor
of the San Francisco Symphony Or-1
chestra, made a particularly pleasing
choice when he placed both Brahms
and Strauss on the program of the
second symphony concert which was
presented by the Philharmonic Society
of San Mateo County in the Hills
borough District School grounds at
San Mateo last Sunday afternoon.
Brahms' Symphony No. 1, in C Minor
was the first number on the program.
During the first movement the audi
ence had not become fully accustomed
to the novel experience of hearing a |
symphony in the open air, but the
powerful second movement compelled
rapt attention in spite of the blazing
aun. The third movement is gay and
rather the abandon of the intellect
than a sensuous orgy. The last move
ment is introduced by a solemn adagio
of highly tragic expression, but moves
forward through conflict, moment of
doubt, and hope of victory to a trium
phant conclusion.
The presentation of the tone poem,
"Don Juan," was probably the finest
rendition. Richard Strauss wrote this
program music in 1898, when he was
twenty-four years of age, and his style
was not fully developed, but his sym
pathies seem to have been at one
with those of the hero of Nicholas
Lenau's poem.
The "Angelus" from Henry Hadley's
own Symphony No. 3, with its pastoral
theme and the motive of the bells
wafted across the fields, appealed es
pecially to Stanford people, Mr. Had
iey wrote this "tone-picture" in 1906
when he was sojourning in a little
Italian village near Milan. The theme,
he says, was suggested by his hearing
every afternoon the sound of the bells
of a distant church wafted across the
fields to a secluded spot in the woods
where he worked out of doors. This
number received an encore.
The overture, "Le Carneval Romain"
from the opera, "Benvenuto Celini,"
shows the characteristic fire of the
Frenchman, Berlioz, its composer.
