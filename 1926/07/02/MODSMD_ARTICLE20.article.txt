# Beauty and Education

The fact that the ground is being ploughed up near the new tennis
courts preparatory to extending the planting scheme around the men's
gymnasium and athletic fields is casually mentioned by the reporter who
writes about the construction of the new courts. It is worth no more
space 01* emphasis because it is in no way out of the ordinary. The
beautification of the open spaces about the campus is taken for granted.
But it was not always so. When President Branner was installed, only
a little more than a decade ago, in 1913, he called special attention in
his inaugural address to the lack of beauty in the surroundings. "The
attractiveness of the grounds," he said, "has been greatly diminished by
the bare, sunbaked courts and the general shabbiness," and<by way of
giving an idea of the impression made on an outsider, he added: "A few
years ago a visitor to these grounds was heard to remark, entirely
without feeling, that he had never seen an institution where there were
so many evidences of poverty." There was defense for the University's
neglect in that; it was actually the result of poverty. Stanford since the
very first years had not had any money beyond the needs of the most
pressing requirements.
But President Branner was right when he declared, "The beauty of
our surroundings is an educational asset which some of us are slow to
appreciate at its full value." There is an actual educational value in
beauty of surroundings. Stanford people are aware of this; they have
always prized the influence of the quiet dignity of arched decades upon
the impressionable minds of students as they enter as freshmen and the
enduring memories of the Quad that remain with them as alumni. I)r.
Branner noted with rejoicing the plan of the trustees at that time to
begin at once the improvement of conditions that he deplored. That
improvement has been going ahead steadily ever since.
