# The 						Inconsistency of Student Desires
## 
### 
The announcement of a University vacation Monday brings to mind
the thought of what a hue and cry there would have been had 110 holiday
been announced. That this is the general student attitude when oppor
tunity for a vacation exists is amply borne out by past experiences—
notably the students' agitation for a holiday on Armistice Day several
years ago.
The attitude in itself represents an inconsistency not generally
• thought of by the student at the time he yearns for a respite from classes.
The mere presence of students in a university implies that they arc there
seeking an education. It is generally agreed that it is necessary that
classes be given to insure the continuance of the educational process.
Despite all this students are prone to seize whatever opportunity is
at hand for getting out of a day's work. When a professor gives a "cut"
110 feeling is entertained by the student that he is thereby losing part of
his tuition fee. Instead he is inclined to think that the professor is a
rather broad-minded, liberal fellow.
Similarly the granting of a holiday is not greeted-with a resentment
on the part of the student body. No thought is present that ultimate
"value received" for the tuition fee is thereby being cut down.
\\ hether or not the loss of a day's work at college is of any great
worth is a problem of more or less importance which must be solved
before condemnation of the student's apparent inconsistency can be
made. This is not an editorial against holidays—we're all for them.
