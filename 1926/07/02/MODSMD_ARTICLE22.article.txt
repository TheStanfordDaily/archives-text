# SUMMER SQUASHES
## 
### 
1 own
A little car
Which holds
Four or five
People
And it enables me
To trickle
Around
The Campus
And make Excursions
To and from
Palo Alto
And quite often
I stop
To offer
Transportation.
I hardly dare proffer
A "ride"
To MEN students.
NOW,
I am worried
Because frequently
I see
Fair ladies walking
And my knightly
CONSCIENCE
Says Stop
But my vague
Knowledge of
ETIQUETTE
Says Don't Stop,
And really I am
Quite undecided
Not to mention
Confused.
Earnestly I beg
Some kindly
Person
To write to me
And tell me
Whether or not
I ought to ■»►
STOP.
Quaeritur!
—H.S.B.

EGOTISM
The Lord made the mountain,
The Lord made the sea.
The Lord made the cactus bush,
And made the leafy tree.
The Lord made men,
And he made some crazy.
The Lord made me,
And he made a daisy.

UNIVERSITY REGULATION
During the summer quarter, as in the
regular school year, all examinations
will be conducted on the Honor Sys
tem; please take alternating seats in
every second row.

Nothing is worse than sitting in a
barber's chair with your mouth full of
lather, watching the boy trying to give
another customer your new Panama
hat. —Jack-O'-Lantern.

Nature Lover (gazing at a gigantic
tree) —Oh, wonderful mammoth oak,
if you could speak what would you
tell me?
Gardener (near by)—S'cuse me,
mum, but he would probably say: "I'm
not an oak, I'm an elm. —Answers.
