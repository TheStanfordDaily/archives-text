# GERMAN STANDARDIZATION ONLY PARTLY SUCCESSFUL
## 
### 
Standardization of industry as we
have it in America can be only partly
successful in Germany because of the
great variety of tastes and traditions
in the different sections of the German
nation, according to Doctor Moritz
Geiger, Professor of Philsophy in the
University of Gottingen, Germany,
who is Acting Professor in Philosophy
at Stanford for the summer quarter.

Personal Tastes Differ

Personal tastes are widely divergent
in the different parts of Germany. In
the West the people are influenced by
France, in the East, by Russia, and
they have a different set of customs,
different kinds of work, and even dif
ferent dialects. For this reason a
Henry Ford could not succeed in Ger
many because large-scale production
of automobiles would be useless. With
only half the population of the United
States, and that population so varied
in habit, Germany cannot afford to in
vest large sums in expensive machin
ery of production because the salable
output in many cases would not justify
the overhead costs. For instance, peo
ple in one section of Germany do not
use the same kinds of automobiles as
they do in another. Standardization is
successful in some commercial enter
prises such as the manufacturing of
collars on a large scale, but it is still
a problem as to just how far Germany
can adopt the American industrial sys
tem.
The practice of standardisation was
first successfully worked out in Ger
many, the railroads and telephones
being owned and operated by the
state. The idea spread to the United
States and was adopted and worked

out successfully in industry. Now this
idea of industrial standardization is
invading Germany and it will have to
be tempered to fit conditions there.
War Influences Education
Standardization in education has
been changed to a great extent by the
war. Formerly, required military ser
vice was considered the best means
of "keeping fit" during the years spent
in the university. Now athletics such
as football, swimming, and running are
stressed, and military training is com
paratively unimportant. As contests
are between cities, rather than be
tween colleges, sports are of universal
interest.
Another difference is in the number
of students working their way through
colleges and in the means by which
this is accomplished. In pre-war days,
money was earned only by tutoring, or
by literary and clerical work. Today,
according to Professor Geiger, the men
do everything but housework.
Germany has no endowed universi
ties. Like railroads and telephone sys
tems, education is controlled by the
state. Tuition is regulated so that each
scholar pays as much as he is able.
Thirty per cent pay nothing.
Airplanes Used Extensively
Professor Geiger remarked upon the
absence of passenger airplanes in the
United States, saying that in Germany
there is airplane service between all
cities at a rate about equal to first
class railway fare. If a passenger buys
a ticket for passage from Hamburg to
Berlin, a bus calls for him at his home
and takes him to the flying field. Ar
rived in Berlin, another bus carries
him to his destination.
