# IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER COLLEGE OF PACIFIC'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
## 
### 
Paul A. Schilpp, head of the Depart-1
ment of Philosophy at the College of .
the Pacific, formerly located at San
Jose, speaks with great enthusiasm ofj
the growth and development of that
institution which is now located at
Stockton. In its former location, the
College of the Pacific held the un
enviable position of being in a com- j
munity which had little interest in the
existence of such an institution, and
of being somewhat obscured by the
shadow of the larger university a few
miles to the north.
Schilpp, who is assisting Dr. Moritz
Geiger, the eminent German philoso- ;
pher who is here for the summer, re
ceived his A.B. at Baldwin-Wallace
|
College. Later he received an M.A. j
at Northwestern University and a P.D. j
at Garrett Theological Seminary, |
which is located 011 the campus of j
Northwestern. As a result of the Tift- j
ing and publication of certain phrases j
from a recent speech of his, Schilpp 1
has been in a controversy with Will j
C. Wood, Superintendent of the State j
Board of Education, over the subject |
of mass education, which Schilpp con- I
eeives to be harmful to the student j
who receives his training under this '
type of educational system.
Schilpp believes that now, located |
in Stockton, a city which fully appre-!
ciates the full significance of being j
the site of a college with a background ,
which this institution has, and with
a new campus and fifteen handsome j
newly-constructed brick buildings, the !
College of the Pacific is now in a posi- j
tion to stride forward and assume a |
position 011 the western horizon com- !
parable to that of Stanford and Cali-;
fornia.
The College of the Pacific, the oldest !
college in California, moved from its
location at San Jose, to the new cam- :
pus at Stockton, in 1924. The organiza- ;
tion of the college comprises four de
partments: a College of Liberal Arts,
a School of English, a Conservatory
of Music which is said to be the finest
in the West, and u School of Art. In
addition to these departments there is
a division devoted to the Little Thea
tre movement, which produces plays
and gives theoretical instruction in
various branches of the dramatic art.
The College of the Pacific is ac
credited by the State Board of Educa
tion and gives high school teaching
credentials for fifth-year work. At its
recent commencement, the college
graduated five Master's Degrees, two
in English, two in History, and one in
Germanic Languages.
Schilpp attributes the phenomenal
growth of the college to the ability

and statesmanship of its president,
Tully C. Knowles. "I believe that the
faculty would die for him," said
Schilpp.
Believing that mass education is un
productive, Sc hilpp hopes that the en
rollment of the institution will be
limited when the 2500 mark is reached.
This goal, he believes, will be at
tained within the next ten years. The
present enrollment is 826.
