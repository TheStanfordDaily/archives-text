# ELEVEN NEW COURTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR TENNIS PLAYERS
## 
### 
Eleven new tennis courts are now in
the process of construction opposite
the Encina gymnasium at a cost of
approximately $30,000, which in addi
tion to the fifteen courts now in use,
will give Stanford tennis facilities
comparable to those of any American
university.
The new courts include three which
will be used for tournament and exhi
bition purposes, around which bleach
ers seating nearly 4000 will be placed.
The other eight courts which will be
placed adjacent, will give Stanford a
total of twenty-four courts. This does
not include women's, faculty, or pri
vate courts located 011 the campus.
Laborers are now engaged in the
cultivation of the plot between the En
cina gymnasium and the new courts,
in which shrubbery and trees will be
planted in keeping with the landscape
plan for the athletic plant which ex
tends from the basketball pavilion to
the football stadium.
