### 
The Women of Roble were hostesses
at an informal jolly-up and get-togeth
at an informal jolly-up and get-together
for the men students at their hall on
Wednesday evening. An unusually
large number of students attended.
Delmer Daves was in charge and
proved himself an able manager. He
succeeded in bringing in the bashful
roughs, and was leader of the grand
march.
A number of girls relayed at the
piano and gave excellent music. The
dance was from 6:30 to 8 p.m.
