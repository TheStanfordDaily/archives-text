# DR. JORDAN DISCUSSES JANE ADDAMS SCHEME
## 
### 
"The Pcace Plan of Jane Addams,"
was the subject discussed by Dr. Jor
dan last night at his regular Thursday
evening conference.
Dr. Jordan who was president of the
International Peace Society at the time
Miss Addams submitted her scheme,
presented the idea in person to Presi
dent Wilson. Mr. Wilson said he was
convinced of the feasibility of the plan,
but must take time to consider it. He
never acted upon the suggestion.
Dr. Jordan also spoke of the means
by which the plan was formed. In
1915 Jane Addams went to Europe, and
obtained written statements from all
foreign ministers, saying that they
wanted peace and would accept nego
tiations. Continuous mediation be
tween neutral nations was included.
The result, which according to Dr.
Jordan was the wisest and most promis
ing plan submitted, was adopted both
by the Women's Association and the
International Peace Society.
