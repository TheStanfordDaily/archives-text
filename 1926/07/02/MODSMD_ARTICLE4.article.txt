# HOLMAN IS BRILLIANT AS HE PROGRESSES IN EASTERN TOURNEY
## Seeded Players Come to Fore Giving Promise of East-West Matches 
### 
In a triumphal march three Pacific
coast tennis stars are winning their
way toward the final rounds of the
national intercollegiate single tennis
tournament now in progress at the
Merion Cricket Club in Philadelphia.

Cranston Holman of
Stanford, and Brad
shaw Harrison and
Edward Chandler of
California have now
survived the fourth
Eround and entered
the quarter-finals.
Lionel Ogden, Stan
ford captain of this
year, fell before Clif-

ford Marsh, Williams College ace.
As a result of yesterday's play Hol
man and Chandler entered the semi
final round. Harrison, who had been
making such sensational progress, met
defeat at the hands of Van Ryn qf
Princeton in a sparkling three-set
match, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Chandler was not
seriously extended to win from Col
burn of Pennsylvania, 6-3, 6-3, while
Holman, who seems to have finally
recovered the brilliant form he for
merly displayed, won handily from
Marsh of Williams, 6-1, 6-2.
Sullivan of Lehigh won over Barr of
Texas and will meet Holman for the
final round position. Yesterday's play
cleared the field of all but Atlantic
and Pacific Coast players, leaving the
way clear for a battle for western or
eastern supremacy. More than 4000
people witnessed the matches in the
third and fourth rounds, a remarkable
attendance for early-round play.
Stanford and California representa
tives also won their matches in the
first round of the doubles, Holman and
Ogden winning at 6-3, 6-4 from Watson
and McGlinn of Yale, and Chandler
and Stow defeating D. and J. O'Lougli
lin of Pittsburgh at 6-4, 6-4.
The tourney began June 27 with 66
entrants from 26 different universities.
Chandler entered as defender of his
title won last year when he defeated
Holman in the final round. Harrison
played with the California freshmen
last year.
Though the tournament has been
featured by the decisive triumphs of
the eight seeded players pointing to
some coming battles, Holman has met
with serious opposition in every round.
In his first match he was extended to
three long sets to defeat Love of
Texas. Against Lyman of the Navy he
J barely" saved the first set, winning it
; at 9-7, and then hitting his stride in
j the second set he won it 6-0. The other
; seeded players who gained the quarter
final bracket were John Van Ryn of
Princeton, Neil Sullivan of Lehigh,
and J. F. Whitbeck of Harvard.
More than 4000 people witnessed
Wednesday's play. This number is re
markable for early-round matches.
