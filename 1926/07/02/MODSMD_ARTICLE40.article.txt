# Maximum Hours Limitation Only for Degree Credits
## 
### 
The Registrar has explained that
students have a misconception as to
the maximum number of hours they
are permitted to take. Extra units may
be carried to fulfill departmental or,
group requirements, or to earn grado
points for the satisfaction of the schol
arship committee. The limits restrict
only credits which can be earned to
ward the A.B. degree.
Because the summer quarter is di
vided into two halves, confusion and.
misunderstanding arise in regard to
the amount of work that is required.
Undergraduates previously registered,
and new upper division students may
take a maximum of 9 units and a
minimum of seven units counting to
ward the degree if attending only half
the session. If staying the whole quar
ter, the maximum is 18 units and the
minimum, 13.
Graduate students must take at least
8 units of work if staying the whole
term, and not less than four for half
that time.
New lower division students and
those who have withdrawn from
courses must take at leasts 13 hours,
during the entire session, or 7 during
the half. The high limits for this groui>
are 16 and 8 hours.
