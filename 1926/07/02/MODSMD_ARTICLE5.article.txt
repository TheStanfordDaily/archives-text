# Campus Gardeners Irrigate Trees to Prevent Drought
## 
### 
To check the withering effects of
the summer, already placing its mark
on the flora of the Bay Region, the
gardening staff of the campus has
been engaged during the past few days
in irrigating the roots of the orange
trees in the rear of the Administration
building. The work will soon be ex
tended to practically all vegetation on
the campus.
The orange trees failed to bear fruit
this year as was expected as a result
of the dryness of the growing season.
