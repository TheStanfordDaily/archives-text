# CELLAR CHANGES HOUR FOR OPENING TO NOON
## 
### 
The opening hour of The Cellar has
been changed from 1:00 o'clock to
12:00. Formerly the refreshment-serv
ing institution located in the basement
of the Old Union was open from 1:00
til 10:00, now it will commence busi
ness at noon and continue until the
same hour at night.
Patronage as yet has not warranted
keeping The Cellar open. Unless busi
ness increases it will be necessary to
discontinue the service.
