# Woman Student Innocent of Old Law Step Tradition
## 
### 
A young lady innocently sat on the
Law steps Thursday morning, not
realizing her mistake in reposing on
that sacred place. A self-appointed
committee of custom-loving students
informed her of the tradition but their
assertions were met with suspicion. A
group gathered about and convinced
her, by means of the customary clap
ping, that she was really in the wrong.
With a smile she arose and graciously
acknowledged her mistake and the
Quad settled back again to its normal
existence.
