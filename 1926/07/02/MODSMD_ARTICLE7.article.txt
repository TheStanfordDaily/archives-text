The new Dumbarton Bridge, span
ning the southern part of San Fran
cisco Bay is nearing completion and
will be ready for traffic about Septem
ber first. The bridge is a long-awaited
luxury for motorists of the Peninsula
and it will greatly relieve the increas
ing congestion of the highway. The
bridge, with the approaches, will cost
approximately $2,000,000.
The span is located about four miles
from Palo Alto, near the Veterans'
Hospital, and connects with Newark,

of the Big Games.
The West approach will consist of
sixty-three spans and the east side will

of thirty-five feet. The bridge itself
has nine 9 225-foot spans. The material
