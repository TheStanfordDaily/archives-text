and field championships, and Stanford
men competing under athletic clubs
placed in several events. Emerson
Spencer led a fast field to win the 440-
yard low hurdle event; Leistner fin
ished close behind Dye, the winner, in
the 120-yard high hurdles; Hoffman,
who failed to place in the discus, took
fourth in the shot put; and Harlow
led Myrra, the world's champion, in
the javelin, to take third.
World's Records Fall
Tuesday's competition brought out
sensational competition, and saw the
collapse of two world's relay records.
The most spectacular performance of j
the day was made by Lloyd Hahn of
the Boston Athletic Association, who
ran his half-mile lap in the two-mile j
relay in 1 minute 51 1-5 seconds —a
full second faster than the world's rec
ord —to carry his club to victory in |
that event.
The other record to fall was the
440-yard relay when the Newark Ath- i
letic Club's sprinters lowered the [
existing record of 49 9-10 seconds in j
41 4-10 seconds. The same team fell j
shorf of the record in the half-mile i
relay by 4-10 of a second when j
won in 1 minute 27 8-10 seconds.
Two N.C.A. relay records also fell ;
in the mile and the four-mile events j
to 3 minutes 17 4-5 seconds and 17 j
minutes 54 seconds.
