# RUSSIAN MUSIC IS DISCUSSED BY LANZ IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
Professor Henry Lanz of the Depart
ment of Slavic of Stanford University
lectured Wednesday afternoon at the
Little Theatre on "Russian Music." He
briefly outlined the History of Music
in Russia, beginning with the old folk
songs and church music, and continu
ing down to the present time, giving
the most important composers and
illustrating with selections from their
works.
Professor Lanz said that it is almost
impossible to present folk music effec
tively apart from its natural setting,
and that for that reason ancient Rus
sian music has remained practically
unknown outside of Russia.. Italian in
fluence dominated Russian music for
nearly 100 years, according to Pro
fessor Lanz. In the first half of the
19th century Glinka led a national
movement In music. He was the first
composer to turn to Russian subjects
and music as a fitting basis for an
Opera. Professor Lanz played a record
from Glinka's "A Life for the Czar,"
and a piano selection, "Kammenoi
Ostrow" by Rubenstein.
Professor Lanz spoke of Tchaikow
sky, who, he said, was not a nation
alist like Glinka, but a cosmopolitan,
and is, for that reason, the most gen
erally liked of Russian composers.
Professor Lanz further mentioned
five contemporaries of Tchaikowsky,
all realists, who had great influence
on Russian music. Not one of the five
was a professional musician. The most
important, according to Lanz, was
Rimsky Korsakoff.
Of the younger musicians Professor
Lanz named Skrjabiu, whose "Etude
for the Left Hand" he played, Skrja
bin's compositions are characterized
by cosmic energy and mystic power.
The lecture closed with the playing
of the "Prelude in C Sharp Minor" by
Rachmaninoff.
