# HEIGHTS ARE ATTAINED IN REHEARSAL FOR HAMLET
## Play as Whole Gains from Production in Clothes Of Present Day 
### 
"Hamlet" in modern clothes, omit-1
ting the rhetorical rendition of the '
lines, became a more understandable
play to the modern audience than the
traditional production. This was
demonstrated at last night's rehearsal.
An invited guest to the rehearsal
who has for several years been a fol- j
lower of Stanford dramatics com- j
mented, "It is tedious to sit through j
an early rehearsal of a difficult play, j
It is hard to imagine another thing j
quite so uninteresting, quite so prosaic j
as constant interruption and repeti- j
tion. A bare stage, save a few very !
ordinary, many-scarred chairs, flats j
stacked against cracked plaster walls, !
tormentors and teasers sadly askew, j
form a background which removes |
much of the glamor usually associated j
with the theatre. Yet desite this un- j
preposessing setting, last night's re-1
hearsal of 'Hamlet' was intensely real.;
How incongruous would have been 1
gaudy Elizabethan costumes in this \
unconventional setting, how incongru-!
ous 'Hamlet' played in such surround-;
ings in any attire!
"But figures in the garb of the pres- j
ent rehearsed parts in such a fashion j
that all was forgotten but the lines of
the play. Hamlet, the man, appeared ]
as a fellow being, not as a histrionic j
sulphite who was understandable to i
no one. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern i
were college mates of Hamlet, not pro- j
fessional actors mumbling half-memor
ized speeches. All the characters were
real. The play became alive. It was
not the heavy piece of the theatre
that it is usually considered. Besides |
being the greatest play of the greatest I
dramatist of all time, it became an
actable modern drama without rhet
oric and ranting. It was humanized,"
the visitor added.
"Mr. Seib, in an ordinary street suit,
sitting on a piano bench, held his
small audience spellbound while he
talked Hamlet's soliloquy. There was
nothing of 'acting' in his rendition of
the lines, merely a sincere presenta-
tion of deep emotion. His normal dress ;
made that scene and the others con- j
vincing. They all became real inci- j
dents, not elaborately costumed stage j
scenes. Miss Randall as Ophelia be-,
came a living person, an understand
able girl. The absence of brilliant cos-!
turning made one forget the surround- j
ings and remember only the sufferings
of the unfortunate."
Gordon Davis, the director, said a j
few days ago, " 'Hamlet' in modern !
