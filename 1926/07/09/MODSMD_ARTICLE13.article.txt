# HEIGHTS ARE ATTAINED IN REHEARSAL FOR HAMLET
## Play as Whole Gains from Production in Clothes Of Present Day 
### 
"Hamlet" in modern clothes, omit-1
ting the rhetorical rendition of the '
lines, became a more understandable
play to the modern audience than the
traditional production. This was
demonstrated at last night's rehearsal.
An invited guest to the rehearsal
who has for several years been a fol- j
lower of Stanford dramatics com- j
mented, "It is tedious to sit through j
an early rehearsal of a difficult play, j
It is hard to imagine another thing j
quite so uninteresting, quite so prosaic j
as constant interruption and repeti- j
tion. A bare stage, save a few very !
ordinary, many-scarred chairs, flats j
stacked against cracked plaster walls, !
tormentors and teasers sadly askew, j
form a background which removes |
much of the glamor usually associated j
with the theatre. Yet desite this un- j
preposessing setting, last night's re-1
hearsal of 'Hamlet' was intensely real.;
How incongruous would have been 1
gaudy Elizabethan costumes in this \
unconventional setting, how incongru-!
ous 'Hamlet' played in such surround-;
ings in any attire!
"But figures in the garb of the pres- j
ent rehearsed parts in such a fashion j
that all was forgotten but the lines of
the play. Hamlet, the man, appeared ]
as a fellow being, not as a histrionic j
sulphite who was understandable to i
no one. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern i
were college mates of Hamlet, not pro- j
fessional actors mumbling half-memor
ized speeches. All the characters were
real. The play became alive. It was
not the heavy piece of the theatre
that it is usually considered. Besides |
being the greatest play of the greatest I
dramatist of all time, it became an
actable modern drama without rhet
oric and ranting. It was humanized,"
the visitor added.
"Mr. Seib, in an ordinary street suit,
sitting on a piano bench, held his
small audience spellbound while he
talked Hamlet's soliloquy. There was
nothing of 'acting' in his rendition of
the lines, merely a sincere presenta-
tion of deep emotion. His normal dress ;
made that scene and the others con- j
vincing. They all became real inci- j
dents, not elaborately costumed stage j
scenes. Miss Randall as Ophelia be-,
came a living person, an understand
able girl. The absence of brilliant cos-!
turning made one forget the surround- j
ings and remember only the sufferings
of the unfortunate."
Gordon Davis, the director, said a j
few days ago, " 'Hamlet' in modern !
dress means more than Hamlet attired
in a dinner jacket. It means a com
plete restatement of the play—a re
statement which employs the method
of the modern theatre. We want to re
move 'Hamlet' from the shelf of the
venerated clasics and stand you face
to face with Hamlet the man. A man
involved in a drama of thrills and
startling revelations of truth —a swift

ly-moving, high-keyed, intensely ab
sorbing piece of the theatre. It is an
experiment which we feel sure will in
| terest every lover of the drama both
traditional and modern."
That ideal was attained at last
night's rehearsal. Hamlet the man was
encountered face to face. "Hamlet" the

I'lay became in modern attire, not a
stunt, not a sacrelege, but an intensely
interesting dranm. Speeches were
talked, not acted. The performance
gained from the contemporary costum
ing. Attention was centered upon the
i play, not on the external trappings as
j is so often the case.

move 'Hamlet' from the shelf of the
venerated clasics and stand you face
to face with Hamlet the man. A man
involved in a drama of thrills and
startling revelations of truth —a swift

ly-moving, high-keyed, intensely ab
sorbing piece of the theatre. It is an
experiment which we feel sure will in
| terest every lover of the drama both
traditional and modern."
That ideal was attained at last
night's rehearsal. Hamlet the man was
encountered face to face. "Hamlet" the

I'lay became in modern attire, not a
stunt, not a sacrelege, but an intensely
interesting dranm. Speeches were
talked, not acted. The performance
gained from the contemporary costum
ing. Attention was centered upon the
i play, not on the external trappings as
j is so often the case.
"Hamlet" in modern clothes, omit-1
ting the rhetorical rendition of the '
lines, became a more understandable
play to the modern audience than the
traditional production. This was
demonstrated at last night's rehearsal.
An invited guest to the rehearsal
who has for several years been a fol- j
lower of Stanford dramatics com- j
mented, "It is tedious to sit through j
an early rehearsal of a difficult play, j
It is hard to imagine another thing j
quite so uninteresting, quite so prosaic j
as constant interruption and repeti- j
tion. A bare stage, save a few very !
ordinary, many-scarred chairs, flats j
stacked against cracked plaster walls, !
tormentors and teasers sadly askew, j
form a background which removes |
much of the glamor usually associated j
with the theatre. Yet desite this un- j
preposessing setting, last night's re-1
hearsal of 'Hamlet' was intensely real.;
How incongruous would have been 1
gaudy Elizabethan costumes in this \
unconventional setting, how incongru-!
ous 'Hamlet' played in such surround-;
ings in any attire!
"But figures in the garb of the pres- j
ent rehearsed parts in such a fashion j
that all was forgotten but the lines of
the play. Hamlet, the man, appeared ]
as a fellow being, not as a histrionic j
sulphite who was understandable to i
no one. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern i
were college mates of Hamlet, not pro- j
fessional actors mumbling half-memor
ized speeches. All the characters were
real. The play became alive. It was
not the heavy piece of the theatre
that it is usually considered. Besides |
being the greatest play of the greatest I
dramatist of all time, it became an
actable modern drama without rhet
oric and ranting. It was humanized,"
the visitor added.
"Mr. Seib, in an ordinary street suit,
sitting on a piano bench, held his
small audience spellbound while he
talked Hamlet's soliloquy. There was
nothing of 'acting' in his rendition of
the lines, merely a sincere presenta-
tion of deep emotion. His normal dress ;
made that scene and the others con- j
vincing. They all became real inci- j
dents, not elaborately costumed stage j
scenes. Miss Randall as Ophelia be-,
came a living person, an understand
able girl. The absence of brilliant cos-!
turning made one forget the surround- j
ings and remember only the sufferings
of the unfortunate."
Gordon Davis, the director, said a j
few days ago, " 'Hamlet' in modern !
dress means more than Hamlet attired
in a dinner jacket. It means a com
plete restatement of the play—a re
statement which employs the method
of the modern theatre. We want to re
move 'Hamlet' from the shelf of the
venerated clasics and stand you face
