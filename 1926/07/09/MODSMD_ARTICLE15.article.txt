# APPEAL IS MADE FOR MORE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ERIC JORDAN FUND
## 
### 
Following the establishment of the
Eric Knight Jordan Research Fellow
ships in Geology by Dr. and Mrs. David
Starr Jordan an appeal is being made
to graduates in Geology and to Eric
Jordan's many friends for further con
tributions toward these Scholarships.
The conditions under which the
original gift was made were: "First,
that the name of Eric Knight Jordan
shall be perpetuated in the foundation,
it being believed that he gave promise
of becoming a rare worker in geology,
his chosen subject; second, that the
principal sum be forever kept invio
late, only its earnings to be used for
any purpose whatsoever."
The founders expect to add to the
gift at times, and it is hoped that
others will do so.
