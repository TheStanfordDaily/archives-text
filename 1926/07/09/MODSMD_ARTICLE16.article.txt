ranged the following program:
Overture to "Tannhauser" Wagner
Symphony in B Minor, "Unfinished"
Schubert
Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 Liszt
Symphonic Suite, "Scheherazade" v
Rimsky-Korsakoff
All four are favorites of American
audiences. Schubert's symphony, the
"Unfinished," beautifully lyric and per
haps the most popular of symphonies,
is an ideal composition for hearing in
the open air. The Rimsky-Korsakoff
suite is riyh in melody and brilliant in
its oriental color. Its tonal themes
come from tales of the "Arabian
Nights."
The "Tannhauser" overture, with its
magnificent contrasting of spiritual
love as expressed in the Pilgrims'
chorus, and the sensuous love as car
ried in the Venusberg music, is
familiar to almost everyone. Liszt's
Second Rhapsody, the favorite among
all his soul-stirring Gypsy-rhytlim com
positions, is another generally known
and well appreciated work.

zens for the advancement of musical
