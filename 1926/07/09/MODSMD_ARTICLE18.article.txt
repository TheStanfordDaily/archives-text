# HOLMAN DEFEATED BY CHANDLER IN TOURNEY
## 
### 
Californian supremacy in collegiate
tennis was decisively demonstrated
for the sixth successive year last Sat
urday wheu Edward G. Chandler of
the University of California defeated
Cranston Holman of Stanford 6-0, 3-6,
6-1 for the national intercollegiate
singles title.
- Chandler and his partner, Tom Stow,
were also victorious in the doubles,
winning from Holman and Lionel
Ogden of Stanford at 6-0, 5-7, 6-1.
Chandler won the title last year also
by vanquishing Holman in four sets.
This year the winner was apparently
overwhelming his Stanford rival when
he won eleven straight games in the
first two sets which took only 20 min
utes. Holman rallied as Chandler
seemed to let down in the third set
and won 6-3. In the final set Chandler
was complete master of the situation.
The champion was at the top of his
game, and he gave a demonstration of
brilliant stroking from all court posi
tions.
Both Chandler and Holman will
enter the national open tournament at
Forest Hills this month.
