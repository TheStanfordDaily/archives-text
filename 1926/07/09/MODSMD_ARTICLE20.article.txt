# UNIVERSITY MUST WELCOME CHANGE SAYS DR. WILBUR
## Declares to Assembly That Spirit of Youth Is Necessary MUST LOOK TO FUTURE Progress Depends Upon a Willingness to Adopt New Ideas 
### 
"Stanford, as a useful instrument for*
the new civilization, must face change
and new issues with pleasure, rather
than with suspicion and resentment,"
said President Wilbur in his address
on "The University and Obstacles We
meet in Education," in the Assembly
Hall yesterday morning.
President Wilbur continued with the
statement that universities are com
munity governments. Those who look
back into the past and try to keep
things the same, may be compared to
politicians of today, who make a pol
icy of hammering anyone who presents
new theories concerning economic or
social problems.
"A great part of the importance of
a university lies in its interest in ex
perimental methods," the speaker re
marked. "Youth itself is an experi
ment, and civilization is dependent
on conveniences originated in college
laboratories."
"Everyone and everything is ap
proaching either maturity or senility,
and the latter comes when one is no
longer interested in ideas not based on
authority or tradition. Change itself
is the basis of getting ahead. Youth
advances regardless of old opinions
and prejudices."
Continuing, President Wilbur point
ed out that especially in endowed uni
versities, where political control plays
no part, is experimentation possible.
The chief obstacles with which edu
cation must contend are dogma, super
stition and prejudice. People who fool
themselves cannot get a modern edu
cation, and it is difficult to reach those
who are living altogether in the dark
ages of inherited ideas.
The process of education must be
gradual, and its criticisms based oil
the results. In California, during 1900,
there were 15,000 high school students.
During 1925, there were 230,000. It is
true that the increase of population
was great, but the increase of educa
tion was even greater. Dr. Wilbur
cited the Junior College, now recog
nizedly successful, as an institution
that had a hard struggle against the
desire on the part of youth for four
years of so-called college life.
President Wilbur concluded his
speech with a plea to summer quarter
students to be interested in Stanford,
not because it is Stanford University,
but because here, people come to learn
how to live right, play fair, and handle
the forces of civilization in the best
way.
