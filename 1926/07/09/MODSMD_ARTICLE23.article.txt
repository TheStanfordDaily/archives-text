Stanford, erstwhile home of the "Rough," the hard-boiled He-Man
from the open spaces, seems to lie in a stage of transition. Hickory shirts
and over-ripe "cords" are giving way to sweaters of many colors and
knickers such as the Prince of Wales never wore. In American colleges
generally kegs, jugs, and roistering "beer-busts" are being supplanted by
pocket flasks, square faced bottles and parties in palm-fronded hotel din
ing rooms. Many universities have carried this tendency much farther
than has Stanford.
The situation here is typical of all transitions. There are two clearly
defined factions on the campus looking askance at each other. One clings
to the old traditions and casts longing glances back to the days when som
breros served as halos, Freshman discipline was enforced and first year
men were conspicuous by their absence from the Law Steps and other
sacred places.
The other faction upholds and advances the new order. This began as
a movement toward individualism in dress and in action on the part of a
few prominent students. But it is now becoming as much of an iron
bound fashion as our woolly,appearanee on the roughest of our "rough"
days. There is danger that our new spirit will make no advance and will
be included with the chief fault of the old.
