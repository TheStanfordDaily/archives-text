# Publishers Serve
## 
### 
To the making of books there may be no end but many people fail to
realize the influence that the publication of a new book may have. The
appearance of the Tarr and McMurray geographies revolutionized the
teaching of that subject. The publication of Dr. Cubberley's "History of
Education" resulted in such a course being offered in most of the universi
ties of the United States. In like manner many other books have exerted
an important influence in the progress made in every field of knowledge.
Jt is entirely fitting, therefore, that a good deal of attention should be
given to the exhibit of new books displayed here next week by the leading
textbook publishers. These companies will be here to serve by telling
what is new in any particular field. The service they represent is vital to
the progress of education but that service must be accepted by the educa
tors before it can become effective.
