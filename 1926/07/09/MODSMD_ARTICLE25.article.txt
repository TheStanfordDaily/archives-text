### 
Stanford is truly blessed with great teachers and because of the
limited enrollment students have the chance to secure the inspiration that
comes from personal contact with men of unusual ability.
Some students of the hermit type are inclined to underestimate the
values that may be secured from friendships formed with professors
and with fellow students who are working in the same field. Much of
the criticism, however, that is being aimed at the large universities
deplores the fact that students and professors never become acquainted
when class enrollments run into the hundreds. Here where conditions
are so ideal for the formation of friendships, the thoughtful student will
be quick to recognize this unique advantage that Stanford has to offer.
