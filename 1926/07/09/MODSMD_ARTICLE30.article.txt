# SUMMER SQUASHES
## 
### de Gardner 
It is to be regretted that the nation
al custom of Saturday bath-taking is
discouraged during this summer quar
ter. But such is the case, because the
Encina pool will be closed on that day.
Possibly the men will be able to alter
their personal curriculum to enable
themselves to bathe on Fridays.
