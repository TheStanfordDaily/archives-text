# A 						REPLY—THE WALKER'S VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
When on Palm Drive
You have a car
You wish to share
With one who walks,
Why think of Post
Or other folk
Who would restrain
Or show disdain?
Use common sense
And Golden Rule.
Many a one
Who goes to school
Must reach the Quad
By eight o'clock.
A morning walk's
A real treat
Except on days
Of sultry heat
Or when the time
Too swiftly speeds;
Then friendly lift
Would fill a need.
A better guide
Than Emily
13 common sense;
So, any day
Offer a ride;
Then, if refused,
Forget <lie one
Who so abused
A privilege
Some would have used.
I THANK YOU.
—ONE WHO WALKS.
