# CHARLES CESTRE, NOTED PROFESSOR, LECTURES ON AMERICAN POET
## Edward Arlington Robinson Is a Neglected Poet In His Belief 
### 
Characterizing Edward Arlington
Robinson as a great poet and a neg
lected poet, Charles Cestre, professor
of English Literature at the Sorbonne,
in his lecture Tuesday evening in the
Little Theatre, said that this poet was
not recognized by the general public
here because Americans were in too
much of a hurry to give him the
necessary study. Some say that he is
obscure, but, said Professor Cestre,
"he is so only to those who are un
familiar with him. His obscurities are
merely passages of deep thought." For
this reason he is not yet appreciated
except by the elite. His so-called ob
scurities become clear if he is thought
fully read.
Called a "Futilitarian"
Professor Cestre said that Robinson
has been reviled by American critics
who strive to make criticism aggres
sive in order to draw the limelight to
themselves. They criticize Robinson
for not putting any of the strikingly
American features of hurry and haste
and din, of honking and booming and
boosting into his poetry; and because
he is above this superficiality, and
•writes upon universal themes that are
of interest to all mankind, he has been
called by one critic, in a clever phrase,
a "futilitarian."
Diversity of Form Shown
Robinson's poetry shows a high
quality and an amazing diversity of
form. He understood tragedy, and he
understood humor, and wrote both. He
understood the intensity of lyrical pas
sion and his lyrics show a remarkable
sympathy and insight into the heart
of man. He wrote epic poetry of rare
style. Yet, in spite of the volume and
variety of his work, he did not write
the "easy, obvious poetry of love," as
Professor Cestre called it, but applied
his ability to feel deeply to higher
things. In his first volume, "The Chil
dren of the Night," which contains
poetry written when he was between
twenty and twenty-eight years of age,
there is not one love effusion. "I think
we ought to be very grateful to him
for it," said Professor Cestre.
Epics Are Great
Robinson's two great epics, "Merlin,"
and "Launcelot," eclipse anything
Tennyson or Swinburne did, said Pro
fessor Cestre. He compared the "Mer
lin" of Tennyson with that of Robin
son and showed how the latter poet
possessed the splendor of Tennyson
with the addition of a dramatic power
and deep human truth which was lack
ing in the work of the earlier poet.
A highly cultured poet with vast
classical knowledge and extraordinary
creative power, Robinson approaches
the great human problems with a
sensitive soul and never deals in the
trite idealism or the blaring cynicism
of most modern poetry.

not recognized by the general public
here because Americans were in too
much of a hurry to give him the
necessary study. Some say that he is
obscure, but, said Professor Cestre,
"he is so only to those who are un
familiar with him. His obscurities are
merely passages of deep thought." For
this reason he is not yet appreciated
except by the elite. His so-called ob
scurities become clear if he is thought
fully read.
Called a "Futilitarian"
Professor Cestre said that Robinson
has been reviled by American critics
who strive to make criticism aggres
sive in order to draw the limelight to
themselves. They criticize Robinson
for not putting any of the strikingly
American features of hurry and haste
and din, of honking and booming and
boosting into his poetry; and because
he is above this superficiality, and
•writes upon universal themes that are
of interest to all mankind, he has been
called by one critic, in a clever phrase,
a "futilitarian."
Diversity of Form Shown
Robinson's poetry shows a high
quality and an amazing diversity of
form. He understood tragedy, and he
understood humor, and wrote both. He
understood the intensity of lyrical pas
sion and his lyrics show a remarkable
sympathy and insight into the heart
of man. He wrote epic poetry of rare
style. Yet, in spite of the volume and
variety of his work, he did not write
the "easy, obvious poetry of love," as
Professor Cestre called it, but applied
his ability to feel deeply to higher
things. In his first volume, "The Chil
dren of the Night," which contains
poetry written when he was between
twenty and twenty-eight years of age,
there is not one love effusion. "I think
we ought to be very grateful to him
for it," said Professor Cestre.
Epics Are Great
Robinson's two great epics, "Merlin,"
and "Launcelot," eclipse anything
Tennyson or Swinburne did, said Pro
fessor Cestre. He compared the "Mer
lin" of Tennyson with that of Robin
son and showed how the latter poet
possessed the splendor of Tennyson
with the addition of a dramatic power
and deep human truth which was lack
ing in the work of the earlier poet.
A highly cultured poet with vast
classical knowledge and extraordinary
creative power, Robinson approaches
the great human problems with a
sensitive soul and never deals in the
trite idealism or the blaring cynicism
of most modern poetry.
Characterizing Edward Arlington
Robinson as a great poet and a neg
lected poet, Charles Cestre, professor
of English Literature at the Sorbonne,
in his lecture Tuesday evening in the
Little Theatre, said that this poet was
not recognized by the general public
here because Americans were in too
much of a hurry to give him the
necessary study. Some say that he is
obscure, but, said Professor Cestre,
"he is so only to those who are un
familiar with him. His obscurities are
merely passages of deep thought." For
this reason he is not yet appreciated

scurities become clear if he is thought
