# SPORTS OF 1926
## Another Comet? 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Bud Chandler, of the University of California, has clearly shown himself
in matches this spring to possess the edge of abikty on his Stanford rival,
| Cranston Holman. Outstanding in his feats is the defense of his intercollegiate
crown this year.
The tall, rangy Berkeley hoy played all parts of the court equally well
last summer and has improved tremendously in the last few months. His
victories in the.spring over Cranston Holman, of Stanford, the eighth ranking
player of the U.S.A., and Billy Johnston, ranked 1 number two, seem to bear
! out these statements.
Some day, somewhere, somebody is going to win the national singles title
from Bill Tilden. I can't seem to figure either LaCoste or Borotra as the one
to do it, although Big Bill himself has picked the poker-faced Rene as his
successor . Neither do I think that Vincent Richards will ever wear the crown
| that now adorns the sunburned dome of our actor-author-tennis champion.
Hunches come and hunches go, and. like Lochinvar, hunches and tennis cham
; pions sometimes come out of the West. I have a strong hunch that Tilden's
successor will come from the state that sent Maurice McLoughlin, Billy
Johnston, and Lindley Murray East to win the championship. Bud Chandler
may not be the man, but he seems to have the edge now on Cranston HolmaiC
the Golden State's other foremost young player."
Both Howard Kinsey and Billy Johnston are very lavish in their praises
iof young Chandler. He has the build, the temperament, and the strokes, and
he made good in the East this summer.
