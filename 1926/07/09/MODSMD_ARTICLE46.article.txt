# Trend in Education Seen In Increased Enrollment
## 
### 
Forty-five graduate students have
enrolled this quarter in the M.A.
Thesis course with Dr. Almack.
According to the Education Depart
ment faculty this enrollment Is almost
twice the number listed in any previ
ous quarter. Besides these beginners
there are 47 who have already received
their masters degrees and are doing
advanced work.
Dr. Ellwood P. Cubberley, Dean of
the School of Education, points out
that, gratifying as this increase may
be, the significant consideration is the
trend in education which these facts
disclose. He states that men and wo
men of character and ability are being
drawn into educational work in this
state in increasing numbers and are
seriously preparing for it as a profes
sion. He feels that this is an encourag
ing condition for soon there will be
an adequate supply of well-trained
teachers and the teachers of poor
training will be forced out of the
classrooms.
Dr. Almack calls attention to the
fact that the masters degree is not re
quired in order to secure a high school
teaching credential, but the men and
women who are preparing for such
work are interested in more than
merely working off the requirements
and, consequently, are taking up re
search problems in their various teach
ing fields. He feels that this fact is
the best indication of the new profes
sional attitude that is gaining ground
among the teachers of the state.
