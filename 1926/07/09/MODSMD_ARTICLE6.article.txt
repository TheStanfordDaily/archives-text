# STEVENSON OUTSTRIPS COMPETITORS IN MILE SWIM AT HEALDSBURG
## 
### 
Carl Stevenson of Stanford won the
Healdsburg mile swim held in the Rus
sian river for the second time on
Monday. He negotiated the course in
22 minutes 31 3-5 seconds.
Bob Williams, also of Stanford,
gained an easy fourth place; his time
was 25 minutes.
Swimming in faultless style, Steven
son came in 50 yards ahead of his near
est competitor, Arthur Hargreaves, of
the Olympic Club. For the first quar
ter mile Stevenson held second place
a foot or two behind Hargreaves, then
he drew to even terms and continued
so for 100 yards. A bend in the river
caused the two leaders to vary their
courses slightly, and when they
straightened out Stevenson on his
blind side was at a disadvantage.
He gained speed again and drew
into the lead, increasing his advan
tage at every stroke until he crossed
the finishing line.
Bob Williams found no difficulty in
holding his place. He drew away from
the crowd at the start, and swam
strongly for the whole course.
Both Stevenson and Williams plan
to enter the race again next year.
Should the former win for the third
time he will retain the magnificent cup
presented to him last year, when he
won the first race of the series to be
held at Healdsburg. Bob Williams next
year should win the Junior mile swim
in which he placed fifth this year, and
stand a good opportunity to gain a
higher place in the open mile.
Two remarkable features of this
race were that every one of the 32
starters completed the course; and
that an old man, who has entered
swimming races for over fifty years,
crossed the line ahead of three boys
young enough to be his grandchildren.
