# MENLO CIRCUS CLUB FEATURES CHILDREN'S EQUESTRIAN ABILITY
## Irving Hellman's Horses Are Added Attraction to Charity Event 
### 
More than thirty-five children will
j take part in the annual performance
! which the Menlo Circus Club is pre
senting Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock
j for the benefit of the Stanford Conva
! lescent Home. Eleven riding acts are
| being rehearsed under the supervision
of Clarence R. Walter who for several
j years has acted as ringmaster for the
i performances.
I In addition to the regular acts those
| in charge of the affair have arranged
1 for the showing of the horses from
J Irving Hellman's northern stable. Mr.
Hellman owns some of the finest show
i horses in the West, the best of which
are stabled in this vicinity.
The Circus Club is a unique organi
zation. It was started several years
| ago for the double purpose of provid
\ ing riding competition for the children
j of the locality and raising funds for
; the Convalescent Home. From this be
ginning it has evolved into one of the
leading social clubs on the Peninsula;
but it has continued to stage the an
| nual benefit riding exhibition.
Those in charge hope that this year
| $5000 will be raised, and turned over
to the Convalescent Home. Tickets
for the performance can be secured
from Mrs. Ernest Stent of Atherton.
j The general admission fee is $1, re-
I served seats $2, and boxes $30.
