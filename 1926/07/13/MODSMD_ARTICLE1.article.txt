# SEAT SALE TODAY FOR "HAMLET" IN MODERN CLOTHING
## Technical Work Difficult; Requires Seventeen Set Changes WILL BE NO WAITS Archaeological Costuming Is Said to Be an Anachronism 
### 
The seat sale for "Hamlet" in mod- J
era dress, to be given Friday night in 1
the Assembly Hall, will take
this afternoon in the Old Union and |
at Grandad's in Palo Alto. Tickets will
be cents and one dollar.
The curtain will rise promptly at 8:20 j
Friday night.
Rehearsals have attained an excep- j
tionally high tempo in the past week,
indicating an excellent production on
Friday evening.
Hamlet is an exceedingly difficult I
drama from the technical viewpoint. J
The script necessitates sixteen differ- ;
ent settings for the five acts. Leslie j
Kiler has designed his sets in such ;
a manner as to be in keeping with the
tone of modernity brought out by the
costuming. They will be ultra-modern j
in their design, and are so created as
to facilitate changes. Mr. Kiler expects
to set a new record for set changing. ;
The technical direction is in the
hands of Chrysella Bunker Kiler j
whose past work in costuming and de- j
sign is well known to the patrons of
Stanford dramatics. The costuming j
will also be ultra-modern.
Harmony of production is the key- j
note to the technical work and acting, i
This technical harmony, with the
modernized costumes will assist in a
large degree to present a truer in- j
terpretation of the play as a play, j
rather than as a dramatic spectacle, j
Critics of this new conception of j
producing Hamlet, will bd interested â– 
in the article of John Mason Brown
who writes in the current issue of the
Theatre Arts Monthly, "What we have i
brought up on as Shakespearean tradi- I
tion, with its archaeologic costumes
and settings, goes no further back I
than the cradle songs of Queen Vic- j
toria. For a full two hundred years :
before the archteologists of the Nine-!
teenth Century busied themselves in i
the theatre, Shakespeare had been!
played in "modern dress," whether the i
time was the Restoration or the reign !
of the four Georges, as the contem
porary prints show all too clearly."
Mr. Brown points out that the cos-1
turning in archaic clothes is the inno
vation in the production of Shakes-j
peare, the presentation in clothes of j
the present being the traditional |
method. The production in archaic j
clothes is in reality an. anachronism. !
