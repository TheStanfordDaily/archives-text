# COLORED PICTURES ENLIVEN NEW TEXTS
## 
### 
The new readers being shown at the
Annual Textbook Exhibit, which
opened in Room 300' yesterday, present
a contrast in physical make-up with
the books of ten years ago. Bright
colored pictures enliven the pages and
arouse the child's curiosity and inter
est. The quality of paper used is better
and the binding is more substantial as
well as more attractive.
The publishers also point out that,
since the investigation of Dr. Guy Bus
well, at Chicago, of eye movement
habits, an effort is being made to
secure a uniform length of line in
order that the child may develop
rhythmic eye movements.
The new books of the leading pub
lishers will be on display all week at
this exhibit and the public is cordially
i invited.
