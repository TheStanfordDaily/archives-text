# STANFORD MAN HAS LARGEST COLLECTION OF SCALE INSECTS
## Guggenheim Funds Finance Expedition to Wilds Of Mexico 
### 
Dr. Gordon Floyd Ferris, Assistant
Professor of Entomology, on his recent
trip, gathered the largest collection of
scale insects ever assembled in Mex
ico. He is now back in the University
laboratory preparing his microscopic
slides and making a careful study of
his specimens. Although the work of
classification has just started, he
states that he has many insects that
have never been seen or studied be
fore. An observer who watched Dr.
Ferris poised before his microscope
with his scapula and teaser preparing
slides, remarked that he felt sure the
care-free days of these tiny insects
were over.
The Guggenheim Foundation sent
Dr. Ferris to Mexico to study certain
groups of insects, especially those pro
ducing scale. He started from Nogales
on the American boundary and went
down the west coast to Salina Cruz,
then to Mazatlan, San Bias, Tepic,
Colima, and Manzanlllo.
From San Bias an interesting side
trip was made to the Tres Marias
Islands where the Mexicans have a
penal colony. These islands are rarely
visited by foreigners and then only
by scientists.
The most strenuous part of the ex
pedition occurred when with a Mexi
can servant and two burrows Dr.
Ferris tramped through the mountains
from Colima to Acapulco, a distance
of about 500 miles. Foreign influence
is almost entirely lacking in this part
of Mexico, he said. Some time was
later spent in the region of Puerto on
the Gulf of Mexico and he also went
to Mexico City.
For three months while about Ma
zatlan and Manzanlllo Dr. Ferris was
accompaned by Mrs. Ferris who was
collecting plants for the Dudley Her
barium.
