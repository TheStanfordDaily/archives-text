Frank W. Thomas, head of the De
partment of Education, Fresno State
Teachers College, spoke last Thursday
at the Stanford Union before the first
meeting of the luncheon club formed
by the men of the education depart
ment. His subject was "Personality and
Self Improvement." He stated that a
school man could improve his person
ality by cultivating a love for children,
by continuing his professional studies,
and by keeping the idea of service
foremost in his work.
More than 75 men attended the
luncheon and others were turned away
because the room could not accommo
date more. The members were divided
into groups according to the states
from which they came. Each group
will be responsible for one future
meeting. Mr. Lloyd Elliott will act as
chairman next Thursday, representing
the group from Arizona.
