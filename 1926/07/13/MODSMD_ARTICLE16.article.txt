## 
### 
Alfred Hertz, conductor of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, is
strong in his praise of the symphony
concert for the entire year. He be
lieves that under the ideal conditions
exisitng, the afternoon Hillsborough
concert will fill a needed place, and
will be of great value to musicians
who may be able thus to continue their
artistic work during the summer.
"I do not see why the Hillsborough
concert series should not became an
annual enterprise of steadily growing
popularity," says Mr. Hertz. "Sym
phony music is an acquired taste, and
once you acquire the taste for the
best in music as performed by a great
symphony orchestra, you will be more
and more drawn to it and it will be
come as it should, an essential part of
your life. There is in every human
being an unconscious craving for the
beautiful; and fortunate, indeed, are
the people who take advantage of the
opportunity to satisfy their desire for
the beautiful by attending these con
certs."
