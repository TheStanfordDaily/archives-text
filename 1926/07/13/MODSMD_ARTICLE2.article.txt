# E. I. McCormac of Berkeley Addresses History Club
## 
### 
With an informal address which he
termed "Rambling Remarks," Dr. E. I.
McCormac of Berkeley, Acting Profes
sor of History at Stanford this quarter,
opened the first meeting of the History
Club in the Women's Clubhouse last
Thursday night, at which new mem
bers were welcomed.
Dr. McCormac offered three possible
conceptions of history: first, things
-that happen; second, things that hap
pen and are recorded; and third,
things that happen and are recorded
and are of significance. The last con
ception is the truest one and renders
History one of the most vital subjects
in the domain of human knowledge.
