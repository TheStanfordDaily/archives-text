# DR. T. A. STOREY WILL BE DIRECTOR OF STANFORD GYM
## Authority on Physiology Comes from College of City of New York BEGINS WORK IN FALL No Other Changes in Staff Of Physical Culture Department Made

Thomas Andrew Storey, '96, will re
turn to Stanford in October to take up
his work as Professor of Hygiene and
Physical Education for Men, and Di
rector of Encina Gymnasium. For the
past 20 years he has served in a simi
lar capacity at the College of the City
of New York. The present staff will
otherwise remain intact.
Since 1906 Dr. Storey has been at
the College of the City of New York
as Professor and Director of the De
partment of Hygiene, where, during
his term of service, he has built up the
first rounded-out Department of Hy
giene in the country. His organization
there has served as a model not only
for other universities, but also for the
public school system of New York, and
the physical training urged by the
government for the nation.
Stanford Graduate of '96
Dr. Storey's active and varied career
has made him a recognized authority
on health conservation and promotion,
and on hygiene and hygiene methods
in educational institutions. In 1896 he
graduated in History from Stanford.
As a result of his activity and interest
in physical education he was put in
charge of directing the work here in
the old gymnasium where he served
until 1906 after receiving his M.A. in
1900. and Ph.D. in 1902 from the Hop
kins Marine Laboratory, Pacific Grove.
His interests by this time had turned
definitely from history to hygiene, and
after carrying on his studies in physi
ology at Michigan and the Boston
Long Island Hospital, he received the
degree of M.D. at Harvard in 1905.
Work of Pioneering Nature
At Stanford his work was of a
pioneering nature. At the time when
he served, there was no organized or
required system of physical training.
Only about 300 students elected to
take the courses given, and "Tom"
Storey, as he was then called, and a
few student assistants composed the
staff of directors. That he was a popu
lar man, and that his work in doing
wonders for Stanford with the poor
facilities available was appreciated by
students as well as administration is
shown by the Chaparral of May 1901 in
which he was eulogized.
System Model for Nation
After leaving Stanford he continued
his work at the College City of New
York. When he bfegan his services
there was no organized physical edu
cation department there; he was given
complete power, and out of nothing he
has built up a system that has served
as a model for the nation. Dr. Storey's
activities there, and elsewhere, have
been based on his belief in the value
