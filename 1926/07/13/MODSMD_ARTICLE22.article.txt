# College Senility
## 
### 
In a recent address to the student body President Wilbur made the fol
lowing statement:
"Everyone and everything is approaching either maturity or senility,
and the latter state comes when one is no longer interested in ideas not
based on authority or tradition. Change itself is the basis of getting
ahead. Youth advances regardless of old opinions and prejudices."
Senility is not a condition of mind reserved for the aged. It may be
found quite as well in the college man. Individualism and open-minded
ness are essential to any sort of advance.
A university is a laboratory wherein experiments are conducted for the
eradication of superstition, dogma and prejudice. If only one experi
ment is made and its conclusion is generally accepted, we have made no
advance. We may have destroyed one dogma but have we not created a
new one to take its place ?
About 1900 "Stanford Men" decided they were becoming entirely too
refined. They looked about for an example of what the college man
should be and succeeded in "out-Princetoning" the Princetonian, who, at
that time, smoked a strong pipe and "called a spade" in no uncertain terms.
The "Rough" developed here. In many ways it was picturesue and fine
but it became an iron-bound tradition; it was a dogma. Now a new and
more sophisticated order of college life is developing.
The true "Stanford Man" will accept neither the old order nor the new
implictiv. He will take the good in both but he will maintain his individ
uality. He must experiment independently in many things if he is to be a
leader and leadership is the greatest thing a university can sponsor.
