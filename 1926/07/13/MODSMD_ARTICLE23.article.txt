A university depends upon the loyalty of its alumni. The alumnus
who gives of his ability and time to his Alma Mater is displaying his-loy
alty as sincerely as one who gives of his wealth.
An alumnus who has made a success in his profession and who returns
to his campus to place his talents at the disposal of the undergraduate body
is evidencing that elusive thing known as "college spirit." It is too seldom
that students have the opportunity of seeing and meeting the men who have
made Stanford an institution of which to be proud, for the reputation of
the institution is derived from the success of its graduates.
Stanford students are fortunate in having the opportunity this quarter
of associating with an alumnus who has succeeded in dramatics. ()ther
universities pay fabulous salaries to celebrities to induce them to become
Fellows of Creative Arts. While these Fellows have only a mercenary
interest in the university they do animate student acquisitiveness in their
chosen fields. A graduate who is imbued with the ideals and the traditions
of his college can do far more to lead student thought than any paid out
sider. It would be an excellent tradition for devoted alumni in every field
to return to the campus for short intervals and inspire the undergraduates
by their ability and success but equally by their loyalty.
