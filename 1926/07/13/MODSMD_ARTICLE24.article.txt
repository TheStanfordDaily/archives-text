# An Opportunity

### 
The War Department is offering an exceptional opportunity to college
junior-classmen who are financially unable to complete their senior year.
One hundred such men a year, according to this plan, may complete their
education by enlisting in the army for an 18-month period, half of which
will be spent in college, and half in special camps where army supply
problems will be studied. No obligation is incurred, and the student may
return to civilian life after this time if he so desires.
The apparent purpose of this move by the War Department is to in
terest ambitious college men in one of the hardest problems the army
has to solve. The commissary question created tremendous difficulties
during the great war, proving that scarcely any army problem is more
worthy of research. Without forcing the issue, the War Department
is seeking to train men in this field. The plan provides additional and
congenial education which benefits the army, and furthers individual
accomplishment by stimulating research work.
