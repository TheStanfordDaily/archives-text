# "Family Reunions"
## 
### 
Tt is fitting that a group so closely related in interests as the summer
school people at Stanford should have a common meeting ground in the
weekly teas given at Roble 11 all. Such informal gatherings are taken for
granted in smaller groups of friends within a community, and for all the
men and women of the campus to feel free to wander into Roble on Tues
day afternoons to have a cup of tea and exchange the latest gossip with
their professors and classmates is one more proof of the informal good
fellowship which prevails among the summer school "Stanford family."
