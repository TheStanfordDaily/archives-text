Sir:
Has it not occurred to you that the
closing of the Encina Pool on Satur
days (news item) is a desperate move
on the part of the "Overripe Cord-
Party" (editorial) to come back into
power?
Yet you allow that tradition-defying
paragraph to creep into your column
which suggests that baths can be
taken on Fridays.

A REPLY
IN REVERSE
If you
In plus fours
Or cords
Or strangely clad
In clothes of business man
Were footing it
Up the road
In haste
Late to class
And a girl-driven Ford
Should stop
And offer you a ride
Would you think
The world plumb mad
And that she were
Presumptuous
And turn down the Ford
Bumptuous?
Speaking not of cars —
A Ford
Levels all
Before it
Man and maid customs
Fall.

fered by the British Y.M.C.A. Now
even British wives will be thoroughly
well made.

The Eskimos consider their Hell a
place of intense cold; ours is thought
to be fearfully hot. Well —my father
married an Eskimo woman so I pre
sume I can eat, drink, and be fright
fully merry!

Amundsen states that there are no
blond Eskimos in the Arctic Circle.
Evidently the Eskimo gentlemen do
not prefer blondes.
