## 
### 
Scholastic reports recently pub
lished bring the information that while
three stars of last year's California
freshman football team have been dis
qualified, all of the Cardinal Babes
will report for varsity practice.
The three men who "flunked" at
Berkeley constitute a severe blow for
(he California hopes. Tliey are Barr,
Beckett, and Briggs. This is the first
limn in years that the Stanford fresh
men have avoided scholastic casual
ties. Several potential varsity players
will return, including Artman, tackle;
Doyle, guard; Harder, end; Simms
and Wilton, halfbacks; and Lewis,
quarterback.
