A dilapidated cotton sack left on the
steps of the Art Gallery recently
shows that freedom from restraint at
Stanford has reached the nth degree,
and that democratic principles extend

Canines whose parents were pedi
greed, and those whose parents are
unknown, invade the sacred halls of
Roble, dig for gophers in the campus
pansy beds, and gnaw decadent bones
(skeletal) about the library in unmo
lested peace. Indeed, these numerous
members of the Stanford group are
allowed all the privileges of the biped
population, while suffering none of its
restrictions. They have no fines to
pay, and no lockout penalties. A dog
may enter and leave classes as he
pleases, and may even sit on the plat
form with the professor without feel
ing himself unduly conspicuous. And
011 the Stanford campus he may leave
his playthings where he tires of them
without fear of reprimand.
