# Library Exhibits Coats Of Arms of Old France
## 
### 
Coats of arms of representative
French families of the last century
form the exhibit which was placed in
one of the cases in the entrance hall
to the library last week. There are 14
shown in the exhibit. Some of them
date back to the times of the crusades;
others are of later origin.
Half of these coats of arms carry
the medal of the Ordre du Saint-
Esprit, ancient royal order of the mon
archy. A few of the others have incor
porated in them other orders.
Among the coats of arms are two
that show a religious inheritance in
the family. That of Cosnac is sur
mounted by a cardinal's hat. That of
Clermont-Tonnerre has the papal
crown and the keys of St. Peter.
The arms of Bouille combine the
religious and the military in their
crusading insignia. The Cross is part
of the shield, and the motto is double,
the first part referring to the cru
sades. "A vero bello Christi" is the
religious inscription, which means,
"To the true war of Christ." The other,
"Tout par labeur," means "All by
labor."
More modern military achievement
is shown by the use of the marshal's
baton, sign of the highest military
rank under both the monarchy and the
empire, in the arms of Bethune and
of Cosse-Brissac. These also are old
families.
! The blue and gold, ermined-lined
royal mantle of France forms the back-
I ground for the arms of Grammont and
; of Kergorlay. The latter has a French
version of the old saying, "God helps
! those that help themselves," in its
| motto, "Ayde-toi, Kergorlay, Dieu
! t'aydera."
Clermont-Tonnerre has the red, er
mine-lined mantle as background. The
arms of Gonzaga are imposed on a red
mantle with a plain white lining.
The Lilies of France appear in sev
eral coats of arms. More of them have
crowns, although a few have not.
Among those that appear to be of
foreign families that came to France
are Eglington, Gonzaga, Walsh, and
Douglas.
Radepont bears the motto, "Pro lib
erando Rege," or "To free the King."
Other families whose arms appear are
D'Armagnac-Castagne and Estourmel.
