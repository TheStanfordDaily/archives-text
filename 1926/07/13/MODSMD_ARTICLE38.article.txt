# ROAD BEHIND SEQUOIA LEADS TO SPOTS OF HISTORICAL INTEREST
## 
### 
The road which runs from the north
east corner of the Quad back of Se
quoia hall to "lovers' (RoBle) bridge"
across San Francisquito Creek, passes
through some of the most important
places in Stanford history.
When Senator Stanford purchased
the San Francisquito Rancho in 1870
as the nucleus of his residential es
tate, this old road stretched across the
hills to the village of Searsville, the
present location of Searsville lake. To
the South it crossed the present loca
tion of the Quad, passed behind where
Encina hall now is, and ended at Col
lege Terrace in Mayfield.
When Senator Stanford was plan
ning the University after the death of
his son in 1884, he found the old road
would interfere with the construction
of the Quad, so he gave Santa Clara
County the land on which the present
county road was subsequently built.
The old thoroughfare was split as it
is today, and "lovers' bridge" substi
tuted for the old wagon crossing. For
tunately nothing had to be built be
tween the Quad and the footbridge,
and that part of the historical lane is
still there. Through the trees the rem
nant crosses Governor's Avenue lead
ing from the Stanford residence to
the stock farm where the famous race
horses were bred and trained. It
passes the spot where the statue of a
horse marks the burial place of the
thoroughbreds. A little further along
is the spot where the first house in
this area, made of adobe by Antonio
Buelna in 1839, was constructed. It is
interesting to remember these old
facts and to picture in one's mind the
gradual decay of the careful garden
ing of Governor's Avenue, the forma
tion of the Stanford residence as the
Stanford Convalescent Home, and the
fading of the stock farm into the semi
deserted hayfields of today.
