### 
One of the high murks in the num
ber of tourist visitors to the Stanford
campus is reached during the month
of July. In about a ten-day period,
three quarters of the states, and about
four or five foreign countries are
represented by sight-seers. The major
ity come from New England and the
North Central states, but lately many
Australians have made the trip of in
spection.
The best-known features of Stan
ford are the Memorial Church and the
stadium. People seem more interested
in the former than in the University
itself. Besides calling it the chapel, it
has been termed cathedral, mosque,
and mission. Eastern men never fail
to compare the stadium with that of
some other college.
According to Harrison van der Wer
ker, student guide, who compiled the
statistics, nearly one thousand persons
visited the campus during February.
In March and April the number stead
ily declined until in May it dropped
as low as two hundred. All through
July, August, and September, the aver
age is between eight and nine hundred
visitors a week.
Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are
the busiest days, and the fewest num
ber of people come on Thursday.
