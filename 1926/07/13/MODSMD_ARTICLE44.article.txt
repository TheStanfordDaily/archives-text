# STANFORD DEFEATED BY JAPANESE TEAMS
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team is
suffering a series of defeats at the
hands of Japanese nines on its oriental
tour this summer. The three games
played in Tokyo were lost by small
margins. On July 2 the Stanford play
ers lost to the Meiji University 3 to 1;
and July 3 they fell before Waseda
University 7 to ti, and again on July 5,
3 to 2.
Baseball was introduced into Japan
but a few years ago, but the natives
have attained a remarkable proficiency
in the game, which has become very
popular in that country.
Bear Nine Wins Games
In a series of four games that have
been played by the University of Cali
fornia in Honolulu against Japanese,
Hawaiian, Filipino, and Chinese nines,
the American team has captured three
victories.
On June 27 the Bears resumed their
victorious career after a temporary
setback, defeating the Asahis 4 to 2
as a result of a home run in the eighth
inning. On July 4 they won by 4 to 3
over an all-Filipino team, and on July
5 repeated their victory at 2 to 0. An
all-Chinese team turned the tide of the
California winnings on July G, when
in the third inning Wong knocked a
home run with two men on bases to
win 7 to 2.
