# DR. BROWNE SPEAKS IN MEMORIAL CHAPEL
## 
### 
The Ilev. Charles R. Browne, D.D.,
Dean of Yale University Divinity
School, addressed the Stanford stu
dents in Memorial Chapel Sunday.
"Where do we go from here?" he
asked. "It all depends on us. Many
are now at the parting of the ways
and, like Lot and Abraham, can go
forward or back, to the right or left,
up or town, toward Sodom or toward
the city of God. Upon us alone rests
the choice."
Dr. Browne said that, "It is what you
want to be that counts. It is tomor
row more than yesterday that makes
today what it is. Look ahead and face
the very highest that life can hold for
you, and then move towards it."
