# FLUCTUATING TRADE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL BOOKSTORE STORAGE
## 
### 
The Stanford Co-operative Bookstore
! has carpenters at work altering the
back part of the building in order to
provide more storage space which is
i demanded by the constantly increas
; ing business. Sales have grown fifty
' per cent within the past five years.
According to Mr. R. M. Stager, man
ager of the Bookstore, storage space
! is particularly necessary in a concern
of this kind, because college business
; comes in waves. Yearly, on the first
of October, 3,000 students demand
j textbooks and supplies, and they want
them in a hurry. After this rush there
is a lull, followed by increasing sales
until the high point is reached at the
I beginning of each quarter. September
is the quietest of all months.
The problem of estimating how
j many students will register in various
courses, in order to buy the correct
! amount of material, is no easy one,
says Stager, and this falls to the heads
of the different departments. Miss
; Margaret Fordyce is head of the book
department, and Mrs. H. F. Bauchou
I has charge of stationery, souvenirs,
i and drugs. Mr. Stager manages the
department of miscellaneous supplies,
j "and anything that's left," as he says.
Started by Students
The Bookstore was started by a
group of students about 1900 in a little
building along the street car track
•situated where the foundry is now.
The first bookkeeper, Miss F. R.
Layes, has been in the office ever
j since its foundation. The students
i failed to make a success of the under
taking because classes interfered with
| their work; but a number of the Stan
ford faculty saw the need of such an
enterprise on the campus and took
charge of the store, hiring Mr. W. F.
: Hyde, who is now in the real estate
! and insurance business in Palo Alto,
i as manager. In those days, "Palo Alto
was nothing but a tall tree," and a
campus bookstore was a vital neces
sity.
Today the store has a staff of eight
| clerks and three bookkeepers and its
| gross sales for last year were around
: $135,000. It is run independently of the
J University, although its board of di
{ rectors is composed of faculty men.
! From carrying only books and class
room supplies, it has broadened its
scope to include everything from tooth
paste to typewriters.

of this kind, because college business
; comes in waves. Yearly, on the first
of October, 3,000 students demand
j textbooks and supplies, and they want
them in a hurry. After this rush there
is a lull, followed by increasing sales
until the high point is reached at the
I beginning of each quarter. September
is the quietest of all months.
The problem of estimating how
j many students will register in various
courses, in order to buy the correct
! amount of material, is no easy one,
says Stager, and this falls to the heads
of the different departments. Miss
; Margaret Fordyce is head of the book
department, and Mrs. H. F. Bauchou
I has charge of stationery, souvenirs,
i and drugs. Mr. Stager manages the
department of miscellaneous supplies,
j "and anything that's left," as he says.
Started by Students
The Bookstore was started by a
group of students about 1900 in a little
building along the street car track
•situated where the foundry is now.
The first bookkeeper, Miss F. R.
Layes, has been in the office ever
j since its foundation. The students
i failed to make a success of the under
taking because classes interfered with
| their work; but a number of the Stan
ford faculty saw the need of such an
enterprise on the campus and took
charge of the store, hiring Mr. W. F.
: Hyde, who is now in the real estate
! and insurance business in Palo Alto,
i as manager. In those days, "Palo Alto
was nothing but a tall tree," and a
campus bookstore was a vital neces
sity.
Today the store has a staff of eight
| clerks and three bookkeepers and its
| gross sales for last year were around
: $135,000. It is run independently of the
J University, although its board of di
{ rectors is composed of faculty men.
! From carrying only books and class
room supplies, it has broadened its
scope to include everything from tooth
paste to typewriters.
