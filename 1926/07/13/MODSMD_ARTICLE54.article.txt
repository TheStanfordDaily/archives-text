# EMPLOYMENT FOUND THROUGH UNIVERSITY APPOINTMENT OFFICE
## 
### 
; During the past year the Appoint
ment Office has again demonstrated
itself as being one o fthe most bene
ficial service features offered by the
(University administration. The help
rendered in finding employment for
students and alumni has proved in
valuable.
Many men and women find it pos
sible to attend the University and at
the same time earn enough to pay
a large proportion of their expenses.
The following figures illustrate the
benefits accrued: Sixteen per cent of
the men students earned all of their
expenses during the past year, twenty
six per cent earned ten to fifty per
cent of their expenses, eight per cent
earned fifty to 9$ per cent, and twelve
per cent earned indefinite amounts. Of
the women registered in the Univer
sity, twenty-four per cent earned all
or part of their expenses.
Secures Permanent Positions
Besides the aid offered to under
graduates, the Appointment Office has
often solved the question, "After
graduation what?" Positions are found
every year for large numbers of the
graduating class. Employment is also
found for alumni of longer standing.
The systematic manner in which the
office is conducted makes it possible
to perform its work with expense
in proportion to the value of its ser
vices. Neither undergraduates nor
alumni seeking employment are re
quired to pay any part of their earn
ings toward the maintenance of the
bureau. The principal source of in
come is from the fee paid as a part of
the University tuition, and set aside
for this purpose.
A page in the registration book is
devoted to data for the use of this
office. Information as to intention with
regard to earnings during the quarter
is kept on file for reference. Besides
this the applicant is required to sup
ply certain information on the first
call at the office. The most important
data obtained at this time is a list of
the kinds of work the student is able
and willing to do.
Business Men Call
Residents and business men of all
the nearby communities have become
accustomed to call upon the Appoint
ment Office whenever in need of out
side part-time help. Many business
houses put in requests for men to fill
both summer and permanent positions.
Nine men and women are constantly
employed in this bureau keeping up
the records and bringing job-seeker
and employer together.
The possibilities open to the student
â– who desires to be self-supporting while
attending school are best illustrated
by the following examples taken from
the records.

perience earned over $250 during win
