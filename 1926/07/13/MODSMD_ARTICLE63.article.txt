# MANY LOST ARTICLES FOUND BY DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
The lost anil found department at j
Stanford habitually keeps the even
tenor of its way returning strayed fra
ternity pins and rouge pots, but it 1
has occasional, high moments as, for
instance, when two distracted parents
called for a lost baby there some time
ago. The baby was later found on the
hills back of the campus. A purse lost j
on Palm Drive and containing over j
$100 was restored to its owner last
week.
This department is located upstairs
in the Administration building, in the j
auditing department, and is presided
over by Mrs. Gladys B. Smith. Each j
found article which is turned in is tiled
with the name of the person bringing j
it to the office, and if it is not claimed
by* the owner within a reasonable
time Mrs. Smith drops a card to the
finder telling him that he may come
and get the article if he wants it.
Some articles, particularly fountain '
pens, are unclaimed and at the end of j
the year are sold over the counter and
the money given to the Stanford Con
valescent Home. The pens thus sold ,
from last year netted $15.
There is a remarkable amount and
variety of material in the safe of the
department now. This includes a good
sized handful of fraternity and class j
pins, including a Hammer and Coffin ;
pin, eight rings, a do r, en fountain pens,
and as many pencils, a canvas sack ;
full of powder and rouge compacts and
vanity boxes, and a purse containing
fifteen cents.
