# HOOPS GIVES TALK ON BAROQUE AND ROCOCO IN LITTLE THEATRE
## Says That Men Have Taken Styles from Those of Women's Finery 
### 
"The dress of modern men was origi
nally an imitation of a feminine style,"
said Dr. Johannes L. Hoops, professor
•of English philology at Heidelberg, in
his lecture, "The Age of Baroque and
Rosoco," given in the Little Theatre,
Wednesday afternoon.
Dr. Hoops illustrated by the use of
slides, which showed that men of
today have borrowed the idea of outer
coat and waistcoat from a woman's
dress.
He explained that this tendency,
which can be seen today, of one sex
to imitate the other, is continually
found. As another example he pointed
out that when women, in the time of
Marie Antoinette of France, wore their
hair very high and adorned with
feathers, the dandies of the court fol
lowed suit and wore their hair in the
same style.
Spanish Influence
In the first of the 17th century,
under the influence of the formal man
ners of Spain, the crinoline and the
stiff millstone ruff were the fashion,
according to Dr. Hoops. When at last
the ruff went out, it was not, he said,
because of its discomfort, but because
Philip IV of Spain was an economical
monarch and objected to seeing Span
ish money paid over into the Nether
lands for linen.
The speaker stated that in the sec
ond quarter of the 17th century, at the
time of the 30 Years' War, the German
influence with its adventurous spirit
•of freedom replaced the Spanish in
fluence. In clothes the German mili
tary uniform, with its baggy boots,
short doublet, and broad felt hat, modi
fied, however, to the point of carica
ture, became the fashion.
Wigs Are Worn
In the absence of the ruff, asserted
Dr. Hoops, men wore their hair longer
until Louis XIV, as he grew old and
lost his hair, introduced wigs. From
then on, he said, wigs grew larger and
more elaborate until in the middle of
the 18th century the rise of the mid
dle class and the increasingly rational
tendency of the times caused their
decline. He also stated that the first
■cravats were worn when the long wigs
hid the shoulders but left a gap in
front where some decoration was
necessary.
The styles of women, in contrast to
those of men, said Dr. Hoops, go much
farther back. "How long will they
last?" and with the hope that what
ever may follow them, "the good sense
of modern women will guard us from
:a return of that preposterous mons
trosity, the crinoline."

tary uniform, with its baggy boots,
short doublet, and broad felt hat, modi
fied, however, to the point of carica
ture, became the fashion.
Wigs Are Worn
In the absence of the ruff, asserted
Dr. Hoops, men wore their hair longer
until Louis XIV, as he grew old and
lost his hair, introduced wigs. From
then on, he said, wigs grew larger and
more elaborate until in the middle of
the 18th century the rise of the mid
dle class and the increasingly rational
tendency of the times caused their
decline. He also stated that the first
■cravats were worn when the long wigs
hid the shoulders but left a gap in
front where some decoration was
necessary.
The styles of women, in contrast to
those of men, said Dr. Hoops, go much
farther back. "How long will they
last?" and with the hope that what
ever may follow them, "the good sense
of modern women will guard us from
:a return of that preposterous mons
trosity, the crinoline."
"The dress of modern men was origi
nally an imitation of a feminine style,"
said Dr. Johannes L. Hoops, professor
•of English philology at Heidelberg, in
his lecture, "The Age of Baroque and
Rosoco," given in the Little Theatre,
Wednesday afternoon.
Dr. Hoops illustrated by the use of
slides, which showed that men of
today have borrowed the idea of outer
coat and waistcoat from a woman's
dress.
He explained that this tendency,
which can be seen today, of one sex
to imitate the other, is continually
found. As another example he pointed
out that when women, in the time of
Marie Antoinette of France, wore their
hair very high and adorned with
feathers, the dandies of the court fol
lowed suit and wore their hair in the
same style.
Spanish Influence
In the first of the 17th century,
under the influence of the formal man
ners of Spain, the crinoline and the
stiff millstone ruff were the fashion,
according to Dr. Hoops. When at last
the ruff went out, it was not, he said,
because of its discomfort, but because
Philip IV of Spain was an economical
monarch and objected to seeing Span
ish money paid over into the Nether
lands for linen.
The speaker stated that in the sec
ond quarter of the 17th century, at the
time of the 30 Years' War, the German
influence with its adventurous spirit
•of freedom replaced the Spanish in
fluence. In clothes the German mili
tary uniform, with its baggy boots,
short doublet, and broad felt hat, modi
fied, however, to the point of carica
ture, became the fashion.
