Money to meet the final payment
upon the $45,000 Stanford Women's
Clubhouse has been raised, according
to Mrs. Ell wood P. Cubberley, treas
urer of the club. The one great enter
prise of Stanford women since 1910
has been the financing and furnishing
of this community center and now
they have reached their goal.
Herbert Hoover gave the first $10,-
000 to build a Union where the men
would be brought together, and the
students, the faculty, and the alumni
united to complete the project. This
building made the need of a similar
building for the women all the more
apparent. In 1910 a group of loyal
alumnae incorporated the Stanford
Women's Club and started the move
ment for a women's clubhouse.
At first their purpose was to build
a bungalow out under the oaks, but
when the challenge came to join with
the Stanford Union in building a club
house quadrangle, the plan was adopt
ed enthusiastically. The new location
demanded a building of considerable
size, but with courage and determina
tion the women set out to construct
a clubhouse that would be in harmony
with the larger plan.
Debt of $16,000 Assumed
The original campaign brought $14,-
000 and, with this money as a start,
the outside and partition walls were
built and the lower floor completed.
To do this much a debt of $16,000 was
assumed. In the following twelve years
this debt was wiped out and $15,000
more was spent in completing and fur
nishing the building.
Since its opening in 1915, it has
been one of the most useful buildings
on the campus to the men as well as
the women students. The English Club,
the History Club, the Education Club,
the Cosmopolitan Club, and similar
organizations have found it a conven
ient place to hold meetings. All stu
dent groups are and the
building is in continual use. Nothing
