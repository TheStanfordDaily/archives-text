# CLUBHOUSE FINAL PAYMENT MONEY HAS BEEN RAISED
## Building Provides Gathering Place for Organizations On the Campus FILLS A CAMPUS NEED Built in Answer to Challenge Of Union to Construct Clubhouse Quad 
### 
Money to meet the final payment
upon the $45,000 Stanford Women's
Clubhouse has been raised, according
to Mrs. Ell wood P. Cubberley, treas
urer of the club. The one great enter
prise of Stanford women since 1910
has been the financing and furnishing
of this community center and now
they have reached their goal.
Herbert Hoover gave the first $10,-
000 to build a Union where the men
would be brought together, and the
students, the faculty, and the alumni
united to complete the project. This
building made the need of a similar
building for the women all the more
apparent. In 1910 a group of loyal
alumnae incorporated the Stanford
Women's Club and started the move
ment for a women's clubhouse.
At first their purpose was to build
a bungalow out under the oaks, but
when the challenge came to join with
the Stanford Union in building a club
house quadrangle, the plan was adopt
ed enthusiastically. The new location
demanded a building of considerable
size, but with courage and determina
tion the women set out to construct
a clubhouse that would be in harmony
with the larger plan.
Debt of $16,000 Assumed
The original campaign brought $14,-
000 and, with this money as a start,
the outside and partition walls were
built and the lower floor completed.
To do this much a debt of $16,000 was
assumed. In the following twelve years
this debt was wiped out and $15,000
more was spent in completing and fur
nishing the building.
Since its opening in 1915, it has
been one of the most useful buildings
on the campus to the men as well as
the women students. The English Club,
the History Club, the Education Club,
the Cosmopolitan Club, and similar
organizations have found it a conven
ient place to hold meetings. All stu
dent groups are and the
building is in continual use. Nothing
but the sudden destruction of this
community center could make the stu
dent body realize the important place
it holds in the campus life.
Club Has 350 Life Members
At present there are 350 life mem
bers who paid $25 or more toward the
building. From fees, life memberships,
rents, donations, benefits, and piano
rents, the remaining money to run and
pay for the clubhouse has been raised.
The total cost of the building as it now
stands has been about $45,000.
The Women's Clubhouse is in the
Mission style of architecture with
tiled roof and is three stories in
height. The lower floor contains the
office and living rooms for the house
mother, a kitchen, locker and dressing
rooms, committee rooms, and a large
living room. There is also a bedroom
suite for visiting alumnae on this floor.
On the second floor, there is a large
social hall with a complete stage.
Separated from this room by glass
folding doors, is a cozy library with a
fireplace. The third floor has been
divided to furnish quarters for the
Y.W.C.A., the Women's Conference,
the Women's Athletic Association, the
Red Cross and Lane Clinic, a beauty
parlor, and three sound-proof piano
practice rooms.

The total cost of the building as it now
stands has been about $45,000.
The Women's Clubhouse is in the
Mission style of architecture with
tiled roof and is three stories in
height. The lower floor contains the
office and living rooms for the house
mother, a kitchen, locker and dressing
rooms, committee rooms, and a large
living room. There is also a bedroom
suite for visiting alumnae on this floor.
On the second floor, there is a large
social hall with a complete stage.
Separated from this room by glass
folding doors, is a cozy library with a
fireplace. The third floor has been
divided to furnish quarters for the
Y.W.C.A., the Women's Conference,
the Women's Athletic Association, the
Red Cross and Lane Clinic, a beauty
parlor, and three sound-proof piano
practice rooms.
Money to meet the final payment
upon the $45,000 Stanford Women's
Clubhouse has been raised, according
to Mrs. Ell wood P. Cubberley, treas
urer of the club. The one great enter
prise of Stanford women since 1910
has been the financing and furnishing
of this community center and now
they have reached their goal.
Herbert Hoover gave the first $10,-
000 to build a Union where the men
would be brought together, and the
students, the faculty, and the alumni
united to complete the project. This
building made the need of a similar
building for the women all the more
apparent. In 1910 a group of loyal
alumnae incorporated the Stanford
Women's Club and started the move
ment for a women's clubhouse.
At first their purpose was to build
a bungalow out under the oaks, but
when the challenge came to join with
the Stanford Union in building a club
house quadrangle, the plan was adopt
ed enthusiastically. The new location
demanded a building of considerable
size, but with courage and determina
tion the women set out to construct
a clubhouse that would be in harmony
with the larger plan.
Debt of $16,000 Assumed
The original campaign brought $14,-
000 and, with this money as a start,
the outside and partition walls were
built and the lower floor completed.
To do this much a debt of $16,000 was
assumed. In the following twelve years
this debt was wiped out and $15,000
more was spent in completing and fur
nishing the building.
Since its opening in 1915, it has
been one of the most useful buildings
on the campus to the men as well as
the women students. The English Club,
the History Club, the Education Club,
the Cosmopolitan Club, and similar
organizations have found it a conven
ient place to hold meetings. All stu
dent groups are and the
building is in continual use. Nothing
but the sudden destruction of this
community center could make the stu
dent body realize the important place
it holds in the campus life.
Club Has 350 Life Members
At present there are 350 life mem
bers who paid $25 or more toward the
building. From fees, life memberships,
rents, donations, benefits, and piano
rents, the remaining money to run and
pay for the clubhouse has been raised.
