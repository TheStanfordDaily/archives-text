# A 						County Obligation
## 
### 
The article about the old county road in last Tuesday's Daily Palo Alto
brings to light a problem concerning the new road and its ancient bridge
across San Francisquito Creek. This bridge was built in 1884 and for a
time was satisfactory for horse-drawn vehicles of the day. However it
has been allowed to deteriorate as has the short unpaved stretch of road
on its west side, until the two together present a serious menace to life,
limb, and automobile tires.
A short time ago a life was lost at the sharp turn on the east side of
the structure, which may have been partially, at least, due to the present
situation. The protruding nails in the floor of the bridge, the loose boards,
the doubtfully sound structure of the bridge itself, the sharp turn on the
east sideâ€”any of these may cause a serious accident at any time. Should
this happen, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, in whose boundaries the
bridge and road lie. might be liable for damages which would exceed the
cost of proper repair.
Yet disregarding the element of danger, this spot is a disgrace to the
two counties who have taken the pains to replace bridges elsewhere where
far less traffic passes.
Economic policy as well as the sense of public duty should prevail, and
no political prejudice should interfere with the due action of our county
governments.
