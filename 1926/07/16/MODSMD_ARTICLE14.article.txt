# Compulsory Education
## 
### 
Ever since the modern university evolved from the meagre parochial
schools maintained by the old Church Fathers, the question of compulsory
attendance of classes has probably been debated. Many European col
leges, notably Oxford, have solved this problem and no longer require their
students to attend a definite number of classes.
American colleges, led by Princeton, seem to be following this trend.
The Princetonian, if he maintains a certain average in his curicula work,
is noticompelled to attend classes. Stanford, too, has recently instituted an
independent study plan but this effects upper division students only.
The freshman year in most American universities with its discipline
and routine is probably as well worked out as it can be with the idea of
educating first-year men up to the college atmosphere and ideals. But why
should a man be subjected to a definite class schedule after he has been
"acclimated?" It is inferred that he comes to the university with the
definite purpose of delving into the world of thoughts and ideas so that he
may better build his own life. Does a definite, treadmill routine of college
life help to broaden him ?
The argument is often advanced that enforcement of class attendance
is valuable because it gives the student frequent contact with his profes
sors' personalities in the light of which their courses are presented. From
this may we not infer that lack of attendance in some classes reflects upon
the instructor's individuality ? 1f a man desires to pursue knowledge in his
own way, why should he be hampered by a grammar-school classroom
routine?
