"Number please?"
"Palo Alto 1471."
"Roble."
"Miss Ourie, please."
"Miss Ourie does not answer. Would
you like to speak to her mother?"
"Thank you, yes."
"Mrs. Ippie on the phone."
"I wanted to ask your daughter to
see Hamlet-in-Modern-Clothes with
me."
"Sorry, but she has a date, and so
have I. Perhaps her grandmother
hasn't, though. Should I call her to
the phone?"
"No, thank you. I'm going to walk
down Palm Drive and get picked up by
a girl-driven Ford!"

AS WE SAY IT—OMELETTE IN
MODUMIZED CLOSE
(Mit apologize to Milt Gross)
2nd Floor—Such a strategy as we saw
it last ivinnin!
Ist Floor—Strategy?
2nd " —Yeh! A dramatics wot dey
call Jakespor's Omelette.
Ist " —Hmm! He's in de eggs
beezness, ha?
2nd " —Who's talking from eggs?
In a ornatorium we saw it
a kink, mit a wive, and his
couriers. And a goosed!
Ist " —A goosed? I say wot it was
de eggs beezness!
2nd " Hmm. No! A goosed wot's
de sprite uv a murmured
kink.
Ist " —Iy, yi yi yi yi, ha! So how
was?
2nd " —So Omelette contemporates
zooaside. So is it t obe, or
was it not to be, dot's wot
he esks. Wise is it to suffer
mitt de stings and spar
rows of bad beezness, ha?
Better is it not to drown
in de wodder mit de bills
round yor neck?
So if in de sleep of debt
come de epparitions—Ay,
ay, veil dere comes de rub,
vitch makes perhaps a
livetime after being diz
eazed.
Ist " —Rimockable!!
2nd " —Yeh, yeh, unde he asks who
is it who's to stay witt de
grabbing greeditors, witt
de lending sharks, witt de
panics of dispriced loves,
witt de unillegalness of de
lawrers, ha? Is dis a sys
tem ha? Ven a decision
once of a hypodemic nid
dle vill bring permanently
unconscience?
Ist " —Iy yi yi yi yi yi, und so wot
was?
2nd " —So no one wots been a
traveler in de never regi
mes has ever riturn to in
fawm de publics from de
noosepapers.
In a worsers suspicion
we might fall dan wot we
are in now.
So dots a puzzling of the
will to ourselves, ha? And
its our consciousness
makes of us all cowherds!!
Ist " Hmmmmmmmm! Nize baby,
itt opp all de encina hasz.

We learn that tournaments are be
ing started in Ping Pong and Horse
Shoe Pitching.
We ourselves are quite ready to
meet all comers in that ancient sport
of drawing the long bow, and in that
manly feature of the Western rodeo,
throwing the bull..

The Palo Alto Times speaks of
Plato. Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles,
Homer, Dante, Horace, Shakespeare,
Virgil, Goethe, Cervantes, and Balzac,
as the "immoral" dozen.
Evidently an attempt to popularize
these classicists.
