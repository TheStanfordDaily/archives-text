# BERKELEY CUBS SAD; STANFORD PUPS TO DINE ON BEAR MEET
## 
### 
When the news reaches Berkeley
that eleven puppies have been born to
""Tiny" Thornhill's police dog, "Gret
•chen," what will the bear cubs say?
A complete football, team —and in the
family of the Stanford coach!
And to make matters worse, "Tiny"
asserts that all of the new arrivals
have shown a marked craving for bear
meat. He has taken the coincidence as
a prophetic one for a good football
season this fall, and in the hope of en
couraging the youngsters in their lik
ing for bear meat has named them
after some of the best bear-eaters of
all time. The bow-wows have received
the respective monickers of Pop,
Husky, Harry W., Hal, Ernie, Charlie,
Myron. Wallace, Harry M., Dink, and
Tiny, Jr.
