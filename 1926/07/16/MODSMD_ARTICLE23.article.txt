## 
### 
Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Director of the
Detroit Symphony Orchestra, will
make his first Pacific Coast appearance
when he directs the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in the fourth of
the series of outdoor concerts given
by the Philharmonic Society of San
Mateo County in the Hillsborough
school grounds next Sunday afternoon
at 3:15.
The program will be as follows:
Overture "Oberon" Weber
Fifth Symphony (E Minor)
Tschaikowsky
Intermission
Introduction to "Chovantchina"
Moussourgsky
Tone Poem "Les Preludes" |Liszt
The Overture to "Oberon" was
Weber's last musical composition. It
is a resume of the musical contents of
the opera and has been placed among
the finest of the romantic overtures
the world posseses. After the introduc
tion prolonged horn tones are heard,
representing the call of Oberon, the
king of the fairies. All the elves of
his kingdom obey the summons. The
famous crashing chord, which comes
as a striking surprise, concludes the
introduction.
Russian Theme
In the Fifth Symphony of Tschai
kowsky we seem to see whole nations
in revolt. The first movement suggests
the surging of a great mass of people,
perhaps the Russian nation, vital and
free-souled, but submerged and un
happy. The second movement, one of
the most popular compositions Tschai
kowsky ever wrote, is a passionate
and sensuous andante. The third move
ment is a beautiful piece of delicate
tracery, perhaps the aristocracy danc
ing in its ballroom, oblivious of the
groanings of the workers outside. With
the opening of the fourth movement
the armies of the people seem to be
approaching for battle. This is one of
the most remarkable depictions in all
music of that peculiar sensation known
as mob-emotion.
Conflict Depicted
"Chovantchina," which was suggest
ed to Moussourgsky by the celebrated
Russian critic, Vladimir Stassov, has
to do with the conflict between old and
new Russia at the end of the seven
teenth century. The Prelude, which
portrays the cold gray dawn over the
Kremlin in Moscow, has been com
mented on by Rosa Newmarch in "The
Russian Opera": "Nothing in Russian
music is more intensely or touchingly
national in feeling. The curtain opens
upon the Red Square in the Kremlin,
just as the rising sun catches the
domes of the churches, and the bells
ring for early matins."
Liszt's Symphonic Poem, "The
Preludes," carries the idea that life
is a series of preludes "to the un
known song of which the first solemn
note is struck by death." Love, storm,
sweet memory, and strife, with the
love theme triumphant, have their part
in the preludes, and the piece ends in
contained, serene majesty.
