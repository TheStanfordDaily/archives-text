## 
### 
The exhibition of landscapes done
in pastel by Jane Rehnstrand which
was opened at the Stanford Art Gal
lery last Tuesday afternoon shows re
markable crispness and brilliance of
color.
Miss Rehnstrand, who is a pupil in
Pedro Lemos' Art School this summer,
uses tone paper in a variety of shades
for background, and traces her out
lines with a Wolf pencil. This is a
black carbon paper pencil similar to a
black carbon paper pencil similar to
crayon but more chalky in consistency.
By this method she is able to get her
effects with a limited application of
pastel.
Her work is naturalistic with a
decorative trend given by the dark
pencil outlines. The uniformly high
quality is exceptional for such a large
number of pictures.
The subjects are varied, including
trees, water, rocks, and houses, the
trees being treated most pleasingly.
The pictures are unnamed, but .there
is one of a grove of slim aspens which
is delightful. Another showing the pat
tern of light and shadow made by the
afternoon sun shining through trees
011 a hillside is very successful. Miss
Rehnstrand follows the modern trend
of using a great deal of rich blue in
many of her pictures.
The pastels now on exhibition are
for sale.
