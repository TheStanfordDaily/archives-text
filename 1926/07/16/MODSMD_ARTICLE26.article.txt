# CONTRAST OF HUMAN, ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE IS LECTURE SUBJECT
## 
### 
Walter S. Hunter, professor of Gen
etic Phychology at Clark University,
will lecture in the Little Theatre, Mon
day, July 19, at 4:15 o'clock, on "Hu
man vs. Animal Intelligence."
Dr. Hunter, who is in southern Cali
fornia this summer, is the inventor of
the delayed action experiment, by
means of which the powers of orienta
tion in animals and infants may be
determined. An object that the child
desires is shown him, then, while he
is watching, it is placed in one of
several similar containers. After an
interval of time passes, the child is
permitted to try to get the thing he
wanted, and by observing the length
of time and accuracy of movement
used in fulfilling his desire, the rela
tive intelligence of the small child as
compared with animals that have un
dergone the same experiment, may be
determined.
Professor Hunter will speak on the
work that has been done in this field
in determining different levels of in
telligence. -
