### 
Mrs. Katharine Vander Roest Clarke,
in her recital at the Stanford Assem
bly Hall at eight o'clock last Tuesday
evening, gave a clean-cut interpreta
tion of the numbers on her program.
Her technique shows improvement
since last summer when she appeared
for the first time before a Stanford
audience.
After the assurance gained through
her first piece, the "Sonata in E Flat"
by Beethoven, she was able to put
herself more fully into the Chopin
division of the program which included
"The Etude," "Ballade in G Minor,"
"Nocturne in F Sharp Major," and
"Prelude in F Major." The "Nocturne"
was particularly pleasing. For an en
core she gave Chopin's "Etude in C
Minor."
The third part of the program con
tained the playful "March of the
Wooden Soldiers" and "The Punch and
Judy Show," by Goossens. The latter
was so well received that Mrs. Clarke
repeated it to the delight of the audi
ence. The last number was Ravel's
"Alborada del Gracioso." For her en
core Mrs. Clarke played the "Musical
Snuff Box" by Leodoff.
