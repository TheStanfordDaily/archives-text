# RYAN TO EXPERIMENT THIS SUMMER WITH POWER TRANSMISSION
## Electrical Companies Give Laboratory for High Voltage Tests 
### 
The Harris J. Ryan Laboratory, re
cently erected for research in high
voltage transmission, is a gift of sev
eral electrical concerns, presented in
recognition of the contributions of
Doctor Ryan and of Stanford Univer
sity to the electrical industry. The
huge building stands in the little val
ley beside "Frenchman's Dam," that
fragmentary relic of Peter Coutt's
elaborate water project.
Although the building is completed,
there is much work yet to be done in
finishing the installations, and making
necessary connections. A remarkable
feature of the structure is that in spite
of its large dimensions it is con
structed so that it can be made ab
solutely light-proof, complete dark
ness being required for some of the
work which is to be done. Experiments
will be started before the summer is
over.
While all the apparatus has been
given by electrical companies, a
2,000,000-volt transformer set contri
buted by the General Electric Company
is especially notable. This volt-testing
set is the largest ever made and will
operate at the highest voltage ever
produced.
All the problems of the laboratory
revolve around the fact that electrical
power is equal to the current multi
plied by the voltage. Thus either the
voltage or the current must be high.
When the voltage is high then heavy
insulation is needed. When the cur
rent is large, then thick and therefore
heavy wires must be used to .transmit
the power. Thick wires involve high
expense and large power losses, and
have been abandoned. So it is seen
that the question of insulation is of
paramount importance.
The experiments to be conducted
may find a solution of many of the
problems connected with high voltage
transmission, which must be solved
before the immense mileage of power
transmission, necessary to meet the
demands of the future, can be brought
to realization.
