# FIRE THREATENS LAND ON WEST OF CAMPUS; ENDANGERS HOSPITAL
## 
### 
Fire, originating from a match or
cigarette thrown by a passing motorist
last Tuesday morning, menaced Drex
ler Hall hospital for crippled children,
and the ranches of K. Touri, Webb,
and Doioka, on the county road about
two miles west of the campus.
Miss Isabel W. Gregory, superintend
ent of the hospital, telephoned the
alarm to the University and Menlo
lire departments. In six minutes Chief
Dugan and the University apparatus
were on the ground. Sufficient water
was not available for operating the
pump engine, but the two 'chemical
trucks, and twenty odd farm hands and
student volunteers armed with wet
sacks, succeeded in preventing the fire
from jumping the road and reaching
the children's infirmary. When this
danger was passed, the fence was cut
and the small apparatus run over the
burned area to the point where the
Touri, Webb, and Doioka ranches were
endangered.
Later, hose was run around the
edges of the fire and the parts which
had not been stopped by the men fight
ing with sacks were put out. The
prompt action of the fire-fighters pre
vented property damage beyond the
loss of several acres of fine hay on
Stanford land, and the possible killing
of a few large oaks.
