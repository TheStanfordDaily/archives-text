# TOYON CLUB READY TO GIVE ITS FIRST DANCE OF SUMMER
## 
### 
Plans for the first Toyon dance, to
be held in the lobby of that hall to
morrow night, are now completed, ac
cording to an announcement, by Victor
Walker, chairman of the committee in
charge, Indications are that the affair
will be the opening of a social season
just as successful as the one experi
enced during the summer quarter a
year ago. Music for the occasion will
be furnished by Ev Young's dance
orchestra.
It is probable, says J. Trombetta,
manager of the club, that students who
have neglected to purchase their tick
ets will be able to secure them as the
door opens at 9 o'clock for the regular
price of $2.
Hosts tomorrow evening will in
clude Mr. John A. Sellards, Professor
and Mrs. Harold Shepherd, Professor
and Mrs. Chester G. Vernier, and Pro
fessor and Mrs. Harl Roy Douglass.
The decorations for the dance are
to consist mainly of a unique coloring
of the lights which, added to the na
tural attractiveness of the lobby, is
expected to result in one of the most
delightful settings possible for an oc
casion of this kind.
According to the committee, if the
dance is as successful as it is hoped
to be, it will be followed by others.
Already plans are being laid for one
during the first week of August and
another one toward the end of the
second half of the quarter.
