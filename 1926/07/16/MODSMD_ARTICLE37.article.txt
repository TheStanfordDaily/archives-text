# TEXTBOOK EXHIBIT IS USED BY PROFESSORS IN EDUCATION COURSE
## 
### 
Junior high school texts are being
featured in the Annual Textbook Ex
hibit being held in Room 300 this
week. Lack of suitable textbooks has
been one of the obstacles in the way
of the junior high school movement,
but the publishers now feel that they
have produced books that will encour
age instead of discourage this reor
ganization.
Several professors are requiring
their classes to attend the exhibit. In
some cases the students are directed
to select the text they think most
suitable for a particular course, and
then are asked to defend their selec
tion before the class. Those in charge
of the exhibit report a larger attend
ance and greater interest than for any
previous year.
That publishers are quick to take
advantage of every new idea is shown
by the fact that one company is dis
playing cross-word puzzle books in
French, German, and Spanish. Another
company is featuring a Social Arith
metic in which the child is shown the
place of arithmetic in every day life.
The first chapter deals with the topic,
"How Boys and Girls in the City Earn
Money." Two books by Dr. David Starr
Jordan, dealing with the geography of
Europe and America, are receiving a
good deal of attention. That each visi
tor has some special interest or prob
lem is shown by the careful way in
which the books are being examined.
