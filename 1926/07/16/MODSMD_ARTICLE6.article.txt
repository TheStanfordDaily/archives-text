# CURTAIN TO RAISE TONIGHT ON FIRST SUMMER PLAY
## Production Tonight May Be Greatest of Stanford Stage Successes 
### 
Promptly at 8:20 tonight in the As
sembly Hall, the curtain will rise on
the greatest dramatic production ever
attempted at Stanford, "Hamlet," in
modern dress. With Lester Vail (Les
Seib, '22), an actor of repute on Broad
way, in the leading role, and an excep
tionally talented cast, this play prom
ises to be the finest piece of the
theatre ever staged here.
In the difficult role of the Queen, is
Miss Anna Mae Price, Director of Dra
matics at the San Mateo Junior Col
lege. Velma Randall, an old campus
favorite, is doing excellent, work as
Ophelia. Several other names familiar
to patrons of Stanford dramatics are
to be found in the cast of characters,
fs Difficult Play
"Hamlet" is perhaps the most diffi
cult English play to interpret. The
staging of this masterpiece of Shakes
peare presents an equally intricate
problem. Costumes, lighting, and set
tings are all executed in a strictly
modern manner, not for the sake of
presenting the play in a startlingly
new form, but to enable its rendition
in a fashion which is believed by some
to be the ideal method of doing
Shakespearian Drama.
Gordon Davis, Director of Dramatics,
believes that the presentation of
"Hamlet" in the clothing of the con
temporary age, will make the play a
more real, more tangible and human
drama. He expresses an abhorrence of
employing modern costuming and
technical devices merely to create a
sensation. Presenting a stunt is the
last thing which this rendition of the
play intends. It seeks rather, to re
move the great piece of dramatic art
from the shelf of the classics vene
rated as such, and to present the
drama in a humanized form. This pre
sentation seeks to present Hamlet as
a character, not as the interpretation
of a particular actor.
Settings Are Modern
For this production Kiler has de
signed a series of exceptionally origi
nal settings. There are sixteen changes
of scene, each of which presents a
setting which is peculiarly adapted to
the modernized version of the play.
Lighting and scenic features have
been embodied in the designs to cre
ate a balance which will give the pro
duction a tone of modernity as well as
of actual reality.
Stanford dramatics for the past sev
eral years has been presenting at fre
quent intervals, plays of a more seri
ous nature. "Macbeth" was given last
year with astounding success; Greek
drama has been presented for the past
two summers with equally gratifying
results; now "Hamlet," with the intri
cate difficulty of characterization and
staging, is to be added to the list of
successful Stanford plays. If, with the
splendid material present in the cast
and the strikingly original technical
work, this play is produced with rea
sonable facility, it will be Stanford's
greatest dramatic triumph.
