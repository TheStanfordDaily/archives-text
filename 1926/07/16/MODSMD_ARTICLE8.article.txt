# DR. JORDAN TELLS OF MATTERHORN ASCENT MADE WITH FRIENDS
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan spoke last
night at the regular Thursday evening
conference on "An Ascent of the Mat
terhorn." In 1881, while Dr. Jordan and
his friends were in the Alps, they
reached the conclusion that, although
mountain lovers, they had never done
anything great among the mountains,
and thus arrived at the decision to
climb the Matterhorn, which the
speaker characterized as the most
dangerous of the mountain peaks. The
hazards of the ascent were those of
insecure footholds and of falling
stones, by which one man was injured.
The party was fortunate in having
competent guides, who not only knew
the trail, but were cautious. They ad
vised the climbers to stop looking at
the sunrise and glaciers and watch
their steps, and by the time they had
reached the point where a former
group had fallen, they were glad to
obey.
Summit Reached Without Accident
The summit was reached and Dr.
Jordan had the satisfaction of carry
ing away a fragment of the peak of
the mountain, which the guide had
chopped off with his axe.
Speaking of the guide, "John the
Baptist," Dr. Jordan pointed out that
he refused to talk of people who had
met their deaths on the Matterhorn,
saying that he was not there then. In
a letter written afterwards to Dr. Jor
dan, he mentioned that he was looking
forward to continuing his work as a
Euide for many years.
