# WARNER TO HAVE FAST AND HEAVY LINE FOR AUTUMN
## Four Former Cardinal Stars In Backfield; '29 Team Gives Three Men MILLAGE WILL RETURN Nevers' Absence Requires New Arrangement of Backfield Positions 
### 
Despite the loss of Ernie Nevers,
Stanford will put a powerful football
team on the field when the season
rolls around next fall. In addition to
a fast and heavy line, Warner, the
Cardinal coach, will have one of the
most imposing arrays of backfield stars
ever seen on a Stanford squad.
Most of the men who helped to put
over a victory against both the Uni
versity of Southern California and
California will be on hand, in addition
to a number from the 1929 freshman
squad, not a man from which was lost
througH scholarship.
The Cardinal lineup will have in
men of at least one year varsity ex
perience: Dic.k Hyland, George Bogue,
Mike Murphy, and Don Hill, and from
the freshmen, Simms, Wilton, and
Wolf. The approaching season will see
the return of Millage, the backfield
-sensation of the freshman team.
Millage was remarkable for his con
sistent reliability throughout the sea
son as a fullback; he is not only ex
ceptional as a line-plunger, but very
fleet of foot. His kicking always keeps
an opponent at a disadvantage, and he
was able to pull his team out of more
than one hole. He was kept off the
varsity squad throughout last season
by an injury.
One halfback whose true ability was
given little opportunity to show itself
last year is Hyland. Hyland was held
out of the major portion of the games
last year, yet whenever he saw action
lie gave a sensational performance.
He is without doubt the fastest,
trickiest, headiest open field runner
in the West. It was his great defensive
work that checked the passing game
of the Trojans in the second half of
the Stanford-U.S.C. game a year ago.
He passes with great accuracy, and
the Hyland-to-Hill combination was
always a threat when the two got
together in a game. He is also a kicker
of fair ability.
One of the big problems before
Warner is the development of a quar
terback. Ed Walker, who has been
shifted between halfback and end on
the Stanford team during last season,
shows promise of developing into a
pilot of merit, and may solve the
problem.
