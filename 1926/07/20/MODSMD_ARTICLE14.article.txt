# The 						Milkman vs. the "College Student"
## 
### 
Another opportunity has been given the San Francisco papers to scream
in headlines the fact that a Stanford student was in an automobile accident.
Simultaneous with the collision that made that particular bit of news came
also the opportunity for those papers to scream the fact that another milk
man was in an automobile accident.
The newspapers in question availed themselves of the first opportunity,
thereby pandering to the public's general conception of the "reckless col
lege boy." By that choice the papers again joined in the vicious circle by
strengthening the public's misconception of college students. Millionaires,
actresses, and college students are almost invariably damned by the pre
judices of the public and its press.
A milkman, unlike his brother under the skin, the iceman, goes his way
unhampered by the marked publicity of 48-point headlines. Together
with the pedestrian he figures, for the main part, in the story and then only
of necessity because it takes two objects to make an accident.
The blame for this condition is to be placed on both newspapers and
the public, the one giving what the other wants and thereby strengthening
the latter's desire for more. It is as impossible to prevent automobile ac
cidents as it is to keep people from falling down stairs and it is almost as
impossible to keep the phrase "College Student" out of the headlines.
The emphasis placed by newspapers upon college students who un
willingly play a part in accidents is unjust to the mass of the thoughtful
young men and women in the universities.
