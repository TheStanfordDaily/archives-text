# Classics, But New Books, Too
## 
### 
While the Stanford Library keeps up with the latest sceintific writings,
there appears to be a great dearth of contemporary fiction on its shelves.
It seems a condition to he greatly regretted. The situation has been re
marked upon by several exchange professors, and a large number of stu
dents who wonder why such an institution as ours does not keep a larger
selection of rent books, especially novels.
The yearly book appropriation amounts to about $25,000. This money
is apportioned among the various departments of the University and they
order such books as they need. There is, however, a small general fund
outside the departmental allotments. This is largely used in buying books
to fill out sets already started in the library, and for works of general
value not ordered by any department.
In ordering fiction, the policy seems to be to wait until a book has es
tablished itself as literature. But should there not be a place for writing
done in the latest manner also? We do not allude to the school of cheap
fiction turned out by the yard rather than by the thought. Surely some
contemporary authors are writing good works. And they cost so little.
Perhaps they are not all real literature, but do they not show the literary
trend of the day? Would it not be well to give us a few books of contem
porary fiction so that we may keep up with the writings of the time?
