# Aren't We Highbrow?

### 
Stanford may be justly proud of many tilings, and without Chanti
cleerian conceit. We have just witnessed a performance of "Hamlet" i
worthy of an adjective more forceful than excellent. It was a well patron
ized presentation, 'and it was rather generally enjoyed.
Therein lies a fact of which Stanford should he proud. We can pre
sent here dramas which in many localities are called highbrow. Our plays
are presented not as tours de force hut as entertainments for enjoyment
and appreciation. And they are well attended, thus demonstrating that
they arc appreciated.
'Twas not ever thus. As short a span as three years ago, we attempted
to present classical drama with qualms of fear regarding an unpatronized
flop. But through gradual uplifting of play standards we have come to
appreciate the tine pieces of the theatre.
It may be correctly said, that no other university in the country can
"get away" as it were, with the Stanford dramatic repertory.
