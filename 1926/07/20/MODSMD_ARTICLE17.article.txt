# SUMMER SQUASHES

Dear Dutch:
By the way, old chap, isn't there an
appalling waste of water going on from
the fountain in that place they call
the Union Court?
It struck me that way the other day
when I was toddling around the place,
and especially when every bally thing,
and place, round here is so horribly
dry. You know a tremendous amount
of nature's best seems to be just
c-hucked away every hour or so. Rather
a shame, isn't it?
But mind you, I realize that mere
destructive criticism is awfully boring,
and useless, and what not, so I am
going to propose two priceless schemes
by which the whole wretched situa
tion could be simply rolled over.
Why not connect that jolly little
sparkling jewel to the two swimming
tanks? You see that would get out of
the difficulty of throwing water away
without using it.
Or why not rig up some contraption
to circulate the water in the beastly
fountain itself? The idea is that the
aqua pura would gush out and gargle
in, going round and round; I'm pretty
sure no one would have the ghost of
an idea that it's the same water all the
time.
I don't suppose either scheme would
be frightfully expensive, would it?
Hope I haven't bothered you with
these trifles, but I'm a bit of an in
ventive genius and if either of these
two does turn out all right I'd be only
too glad to help you with any other
little thing that pops up.
Cheerio, Yours,
De Gardner.
P.S.: It might be a fruity wheeze
to put a squad of goldfish in the outfit;
they could drink the water and save
quite a bit of waste, eh?

BODY STILL UNIDENTIFIED
A co-ed entering Stanford for the
first time this quarter is rumored to
have said upon being kissed by a '28
man, "We're engaged now, aren't we?"
