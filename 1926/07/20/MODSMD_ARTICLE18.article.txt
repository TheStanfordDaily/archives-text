# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
We don't mind change if' it means
progress. The oval lawn is gone, there
are benches in the arboretum. Bobbed
heads and short skirts, golf outfits for
classroom wear —these are all good if
you like them. We can even stand the
automobiles.
But what some of us old-timers do
object to is the indiscriminate throw
ing overboard of good ideas and excel
lent customs just because they are
known as traditions. Smoking 011 the
-Quad was never tolerated in the good
old days. Books and lunches perched
in the windows used to be as safe as
though in a safe deposit vault. Pipes
on the Inner Quad and match scratch
ing on the Assembly Hall door may
mean progress, though we doubt it.
But book-stealing and hat-appropriat
ing certainly are not.
It is time to get down to funda
mentals in personal conduct when re
wards have to be offered for informa
tion leading to the conviction of
thieves —our fellow students!
—An Old-Timer.
