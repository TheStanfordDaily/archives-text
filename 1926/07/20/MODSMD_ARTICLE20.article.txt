# PROFESSOR HARRISON IS EXPERIMENTING IN SPECTROSCOPIC WORK
## 
### 
The three principal branches of re
search in the Physics Department at
Stanford are in X-rays under the di
rection of Professor Webster, in At- (
mospherie Electricity under Professor
Brown, and in Spectroscopic research
es under Professor Harrison.
Professor Harrison is at present
making intensity measurements of
line spectra; a field of work in which
very little has been accomplished. Only
in Utrecht, Holland, are similar inves
tigations being made, and this is the
first time that accurate measurements
of line intensities have been deter
mined. The results of the experiments
are being watched with interest by
various physicists throughout the
world, because the latter need the data
discovered in order to continue with
their respective works. The ultimate
goal at which all these investigations
aim is the determination of the struc
tures of atoms; the outstanding un
solved problem in Modern Physics. So
far, the structures of the atoms of
only a few of the simple elements are
known.
Experimental Proceedure
The proceedure, briefly, of Professor
Harrison's experiments is, firstly, the
taking of photographs of the spectra
of the elements chosen for experi
mentation; and secondly, the measur
ing of the densities of the lines on the
photo plates by the use of a densito
meter. From these measurements can
be found the line intensities, which
are functions of their densities on the
photo plates.
A vital part of the apparatus, the
dencitometer, is largely Professor Har
rison's own invention, and was con
structed entirely under his guidance.
An idea of some of the experimental
difficulties encountered may be .gath
ered from the fact that when this
work is extended to the far ultra
violet range of the spectra, it will be
necessary to have the entire photo
graphic apparatus in a high vacuum,
because ultra violet light is absorbed
by air.
Spirit of Co-operation
Doctor Harrison remarked on the
"helpful spirit of co-operation" which
exists among the scientists in his field,
who are ready to disclose any results
they may achieve to a fellow scientist.
In this way much delay, and unneces
sary work is avoided; thus one experi
menter. receiving the necessary data
from another, is enabled to continue
own work without having to engage
in preliminary research. "Therefore,"
cautioned Professor Harrison, "care
should be taken before too much praise
is attributed to one man, who arrives
at valuable results, achieve
ments might not have been possible
without the co-operation of others."
