Seymour P. Smith, '26, in a letter
to Dean Culver, tells an interesting
story of the work he is doing in Alaska
this summer. As an employee of the
Bureau of Fisheries, United States De
partment of Commerce, he has been
engaged in work with both trout and
f-almon.
Smith's first station was at Afognak
Island, thirty miles from Kodiak,
where he learned the technique of fish
culture. One of the largest pieces of
work done at the Afognak hatchery
was the collection of two million steel
head trout eggs for shipment to the
United States,
Another important activity was the
catching of several thousands of Dolly
Varden trout in seine bawls, as these
fish were destroying the salmon eggs
of that region.
Recently Smith has been assisting
Dr. Willis H. Rich, '09. in the marking
of thirteen thousand salmon by cut
ting certain fins, which are not neces
sary to the fishes' well-being. The pur
pose of this performance is to learn
more of the habits and range of the
subjects. These operations are being
conducted on the Karluk River, the
greatest red salmon river in the world.
Fifty thousand fish will be marked
before the end of the season.
