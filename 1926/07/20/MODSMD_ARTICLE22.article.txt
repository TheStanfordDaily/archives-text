"The point dipped in venom!"
—MEOW —"then venom to its
work!"—MEOW—
"Where's that damned cat?" Gor
don Davis and all the stage hands
started up and down the wings
in frantic pursuit of the hapless
quadruped who suddenly found
himself playing an important role
in the last act of Mr. Shakes
peare's tragedy, "Hamlet."
"I am more an antique Roman
than a Dane" —MEOW —"Give me
the cup"—MEOW!! The play
went on, on the stage. In the
wings, men's minds were filled
with horror —would the audience
hear?
"I die, Horatio"—YOWWW— *
someone had it by the tail, and
a last ungodly shriek was emit
ted. "The rest is silence," said
Hamlet.
