# OXFORD STUDENTS VISIT
## 
### 
Thirty Oxford undergraduates sailed
on the Leviathan from England last
week to visit American universities
and principal cities. This is the first
organized party from the university to
visit the United States.

Isn't it too bad that Saturday is the
day chosen to close Encina Pool? That
is the only free day in the week for
many of us.
