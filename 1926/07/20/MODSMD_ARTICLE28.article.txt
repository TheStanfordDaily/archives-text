# Dr. Jordan Speaks to Roble Club on Stanford Traditions
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan spoke to the women of
Roble Hall last night on Stanford and
Stanford traditions. He told his audi
ence about the early history of Stan
ford and the origin of some of its cus
toms. He also spoke of the origin of
Roble in what is now Sequoia Hall.
In talking of the early years, Dr.
Jordan stressed the work of Mrs.
Stanford, and her attitude toward wo
men in the university. The Stanfords
were anxious that co-education be
come successful at the University, and
the five hundred limit was set only
because it was feared that women
might outnumber the men. At that
time this number represented about
half the student body.
