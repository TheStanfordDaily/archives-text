# MODERN CLOTHES MAKE PRINCE HAMLET HUMAN
## 
### 
"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," was
brought down from its classic niche;
it was humanized and made more un
derstandable in Friday night's pre
sentation. Although not a highly pol
ished production, the acting was on
the whole convincing, in fact remark
able, considering the short time in
which the play was put forth.
Lester Vail gave a striking and ex
cellent interpretation of the character
of Hamlet. He seems admirably fitted
by temperament as well as by train
ing to play such a part. He put his
whole personality into the "Prince of
Denmark" and made the "melancholy
Dane" live for his audience. He por
trayed the inner struggle of Hamlet
and in the "whirlwind of his passion—
acquired and begat a temperance that
gave it smoothness." He did not rant
and rave about the stage as so many
actors do when playing Shakespeare,
but acted, fancied, thought as an ear
nest youth torn by great emotions and
fears.
Soliloquy Excellent
Perhaps Vail's greatest triumph was
his rendition of the soliloquy in the

first scene of the third act. He came
quietly upon the stage, lit a cigarette
and lounged upon a bench. He mused.
"To be or not to be," he could not
decide. Was he a coward to sit quietly
and let Claudius rule his kingdom and
love his mother? He wondered if it
were better to "die, to sleep, perchance
to dream." "Aye, there was the rub."
He pondered, could reach no conclu
sion, no peace; his brain whirled.
Ophelia came out of an Inner room.
All Hamlet's pent-up emotion broke
upon her and left her bewildered,
weeping, and hurt by his cruel words
and shaken reason. She left the stage,
not dramatically, but full of sorrow,
unable to understand the once gay
Hamlet.
Velma Randall portrayed the char
acter of Ophelia to perfection. This is
one of the most difficult parts in the
play and Miss Randall's rendition is
worthy of note. She played the obe
dient, sheltered daughter of Polonius
and the liorror-maddened, pitiful crea
ture after her father's death with a
great deal of sympathy and under
