# MODERN CLOTHES MAKE PRINCE HAMLET HUMAN
## 
### 
"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," was
brought down from its classic niche;
it was humanized and made more un
derstandable in Friday night's pre
sentation. Although not a highly pol
ished production, the acting was on
the whole convincing, in fact remark
able, considering the short time in
which the play was put forth.
Lester Vail gave a striking and ex
cellent interpretation of the character
of Hamlet. He seems admirably fitted
by temperament as well as by train
ing to play such a part. He put his
whole personality into the "Prince of
Denmark" and made the "melancholy
Dane" live for his audience. He por
trayed the inner struggle of Hamlet
and in the "whirlwind of his passionâ€”
acquired and begat a temperance that
gave it smoothness." He did not rant
and rave about the stage as so many
actors do when playing Shakespeare,
but acted, fancied, thought as an ear
nest youth torn by great emotions and
fears.
Soliloquy Excellent
Perhaps Vail's greatest triumph was
his rendition of the soliloquy in the

first scene of the third act. He came
quietly upon the stage, lit a cigarette
and lounged upon a bench. He mused.
"To be or not to be," he could not
decide. Was he a coward to sit quietly
and let Claudius rule his kingdom and
love his mother? He wondered if it
were better to "die, to sleep, perchance
to dream." "Aye, there was the rub."
He pondered, could reach no conclu
sion, no peace; his brain whirled.
Ophelia came out of an Inner room.
All Hamlet's pent-up emotion broke
upon her and left her bewildered,
weeping, and hurt by his cruel words
and shaken reason. She left the stage,
not dramatically, but full of sorrow,
unable to understand the once gay
Hamlet.
Velma Randall portrayed the char
acter of Ophelia to perfection. This is
one of the most difficult parts in the
play and Miss Randall's rendition is
worthy of note. She played the obe
dient, sheltered daughter of Polonius
and the liorror-maddened, pitiful crea
ture after her father's death with a
great deal of sympathy and under
standing. She did her best acting as
the mad Ophelia.
Du Prau Scores
Norris James did excellent work in
the part of Horatio, friend of Hamlet.
Boyd Newborn, as Laertes, was not
quite convincing. He seemed to be
"play acting" rather than living his
part.
Anna May Price as Gertrude, mother
of Hamlet, did passibly well. Gert
rude, as conceived by Shakespeare,
was a wanton, thoroughly bad, but
not weak.
James Du Prau handled the part of
Claudius with considerable skill.
William Thornton portrayed the ab
surd character of Polonius, managing
the statesman and his silly puns to
perfection.
Thomas Nevitt was exceptional as
the leader of the wandering players,
and Barbara Eubanks did extremely
well as the Player Queen.
John Trueman and Guy Holliday, as
the grave-diggers, were amusing. True
man used his voice to perfection in
portraying the stupid old clown who
thought himself a logician. Felton
Kaufman did well in his presentation
of the effeminate, silly Osric.
Marvin Park as Rosencrant/ and
Jack Wilson as Guildenstern, enacted
their parts fairly well.
Cast in minor roles were: Byron
Harvey as Francisco, and later as
Lucianus, Philip Brooks as Bernardo,
Robert Sears as Marcellus, Morris
Doyle as the Ghost of Hamlet's father,
Joy Harris as the Second Player, Carl
Meyer as the Third Player, Frederick
Zitkowski as the Player King, Charles
Binkley as the priest, and Leslie Gor
don as a Bervant.
Settings Brilliant
The settings for "Hamlet" were the
best Leslie Kiler has done. They con
tributed a large part to the success of
the production. The sets were ren
dered in a strictly modern manner,
but were in keeping with the dignity
of the play. The use of lights, espe
cially in the terrace scene in Act I,
were effective.
Undoubtedly the presentation of
Hamlet in modern dress is among
Stanford's great dramatic successes.
The play seems to have lost nothing
with the modernization of costume and
manner. Great credit is due Gordon
Davis, the director, and the members
of his cast. The production marks a
real achievement in campus dramatics.
