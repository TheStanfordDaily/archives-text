The stretch of highway from Palm
Drive to the S.P. tracks in Palo Alto
has been mentioned along with the
San Francisquito Creek bridge road as
being in need of repair. The reason
no work has been done on the former
is that the Palo Alto planning commis
sion hopes not only to smooth but to
widen this part of University Avenue,
and work done on the street before
this can be accomplished would incur
undesirable expenditure.
