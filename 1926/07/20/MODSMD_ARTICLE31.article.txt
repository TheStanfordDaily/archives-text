## 
### 
Miss Jane Rhenstranrt, whose exhi- i
bition of pastel landscapes is now 1
being shown at the Stanford Art Gal- i
lery, is director of art at the State |
Normal School of Superior, Wisconsin, j
These studies were made in the open j
during the past year and are direct j
impressions of northeastern land
scapes around Lake Superior. The !
pictures were made at different sea- j
sons of the year and show the green j
spring coloring, particularly pleasing j
in the birches of the East, and also .
the brilliant lire-color autumnal foli-1
age, as well as some winter land- 1
scapes. I
The subjects are taken from around |
Bayfield, Duluth, Superior,., and other I
sections in Northern Wisconsin, while !
a few are sketched in Isle Royale, j
Michigan, at the head of Lake Super-!
ior.
Miss Rhenstrand is well known for
V 1
her outdoor sketches made in this !
country and in Europe, and is at pres- j
ent in California sketching material
for exhibition in the East. She is a
pupil at Pedro Lemos' art school which
he has opened for the summer in Palo
Alto. The artist is identified promi- j
nently with art education in her state j
and is giving her attention especially
to the training of art teachers for 1
school work.
This collection by Miss Rhenstrand I
shows versatility of method and sure- j
ness of medium. Tone paper is used .
to a remarkable extent in securing !
color background and the artist ap- j
plies her pastello with grace and deli- i
cacy.
