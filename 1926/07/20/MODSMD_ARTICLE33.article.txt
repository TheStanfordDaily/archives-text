# ABUSIVE FIGHT ENDS FINAL STANFORD GAME
## 
### 
Because the players and supporters
of the semi-professional Daimai Club
baseball team were chagrined at the
superiority of their American oppon
ents, the final game in the Stanford
varsity baseball team's tour of Japan
last Tuesday ended in an abusive row
that brought a corps of police to the
scene to preserve order.
The resentment of the Japanese was
aroused over umpire's decisions. Un
til the Stanford team had ventured
outside of collegiate ranks in its final
contest, it received courteous and
sportsmanlike treatment in all its
games.
Japan Is Baseball Wild
According to a letter from King, a
player, published in the San Francisco
Chronicle, the Japanese have gone
crazy over the American national
game, and all of Stanford's games
with Waseda University and Meiji
University were well attended. At
some of the games people were turned
away, and the grandstand will accom
modate 28,000.
Baseball was introduced into Japan
but a few years ago. The widespread
popularity of the game has produced
good teams, even in so short a time,
as witness the Japanese universities'
victories over Stanford. The Stanford
men look like giants alongside the
oriental players, but the latter do not
seem to be handicapped by their
diminutiveness.
The letter in the Chronicle tells of
the remarkable sportsmanship and
hospitality of both the Waseda and
the Maiji universities. It was only
when the Americans ventured into the
semi-professional field that things did
not go smoothly.
