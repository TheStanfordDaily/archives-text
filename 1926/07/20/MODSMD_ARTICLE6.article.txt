# SPEAKER FROM WALES UNIVERSITY TO TALK ON TWO DEMOCRACIES
## Attitude Toward Politics in The United States and England Compared 
### 
"Democracy in America and Great
Britain: a Personal Impression," is
the subject of the lecture to be given
by Sydney Herbert in the Little Thea
tre at 4:30 Wednesday.
The obvious distinction between the
two democracies is that in England
the centralized power is in Parliament,
which is responsible only to the peo
ple, while in America, governmental
control is divided between the execu
tive, legislative, and judiciary
branches. According to Mr. Herbert,
another difference is caused by the
fact that America has more social
democracy. The political struggles in
this country are within tlie parties,
rather than between parties. In Eng
land the contrary is true, since exist
ing social conditions divide the British
people into definite classes, whose in
terests are often opposed.
The men that are prominent in Eng
lish politics are those who have been
trained in methods of diplomacy. In
America, a kind of frontier spirit is in
evidence; leaders are pushed to the
foreground, or ruined by a single dis
astrous political campaign.
Mr. Herbert is lecturer to the Wil
son Chair of International Politics,
University of Wales.
