# MERRILL TO SPEAK ON INTELLIGENCE TESTING
## 
### 
Dr. Maud Merrill, assistant profes
sor of Psychology at Stanford, will
speak on "The Intelligence Test as a
Measure of School Success," at the
meeting of the Mothers' Club at three
o'clock this afternoon in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Dr. Merrill believes that the intelli
gence test is the best single means
for determining the mental ability of
individuals, and she will show how it
has been used in the public schools as
a means for securing better grading
of children.
The discussion will include an ex
planation of mental adaptability, and
the Thorndyke and individual tests.
According to Dr. Merrill, the entrance
tests given at Stanford have rarely
failed to predict college success or
failure correctly,* although in all cases
outside factors must be considered.
