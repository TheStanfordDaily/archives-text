# REFORM IN TEACHER PAY PLAN URGED BY PROFESSOR ALMACK
## 
### 
"Most schools have no scientific
method for determining how much a
teacher should be paid for her ser
vices," Dr. John Almack declared in
his talk at the Thursday luncheon of
the Education Club. "Teachers them
serves," he said, "have hazy ideas
about what they should receive as is
disclosed by a study of the probable
worth of a teacher as compared with
the value she places on her services."
He went on to show that, according
to studies made, there is no correla
tion between salaries actually received
by teachers and the amount of their
training, experience, cost of living, or
teaching load. He made a plea for a
scientifically determined salary sched
ule that would take into consideration
cost of living, cost of training for the
profession, experience, systematic self
improvement, teaching load, and merit.
"I believe the money will be forth
coming," he stated, "when we can
show that the schedule has been cal
culated on a just and scientific basis."
Mr. Lloyd Elliott, chairman of the
day and representing the Arizona
group, called on members of his dele
gation for a song that had been writ
ten for the occasion. One representa
tive read headlines from a Douglas,
Arizona, paper which expressed fear
that Los Angeles, through the help of
Aimee McPherson, was trying to start
a campaign for the annexation of the
Arizona city.
Dean E. L. Shirrell, of the Univer
sity of Arizona, gave a brief talk on
"Arizona, the Last Frontier." He de
scribed his state as a country of vast
distances and undeveloped resources
and told of the efforts of his univer
sity in preparing men and women to
meet the problems of frontier life.

Be careful about throwing lighted
matches and cigarettes aside. The fire
hazard is tremendous at this time of
year.
