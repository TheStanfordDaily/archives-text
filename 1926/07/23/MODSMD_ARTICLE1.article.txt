# UPPER DIVISION AND GRADUATE STUDENT LIMITS TO BE MADE
## Professor W. B. Owens Says Increased Enrollment Cause of Change MUST REMOVE PRESSURE Numerical Limit to Vary According to Existing Attendance Figure

Stanford University will no longer
guarantee admission to all who apply
for upper division or graduate stand
ing. This was disclosed by Professor
W. B. Owens, a member of the com
mittee on admission, in a recent
speech before the Rotary Club of Palo
Alto. Pressure which has formerly
been concentrated upon lower division
registration has now been transferred
to the upper division and graduate en
rollment, Professor Owens said.

Heretofore all applicants who met
the minimum requirements for admis
sion in advanced standing were as
sured of acceptance, but increased ap
plication has necessitated some sort
of limitation on the number who are
to be admitted.

Unlike the selection of candidates
for the lower division which has defi-
Tiite numerical limits, the new method
must be able to vary according to the
existing conditions. No definite plan
has as yet been arranged.
Owens mentioned the plan now in
operation for the selection of those
eligible for admission to the lower
division. Applicants are graded on a
basis of ten points, three points on
the candidate's high school record,
three points on the intelligence and
aptitude test, and four points on char
acter recommendations.
A similar plan must be devised for
testing the ability of those who apply
for advanced standing, said Owens.
