# DATE OF "HAY FEVER" POSTPONED A WEEK; SET FOR AUGUST 7
## Illness of Principal Causes Change; "Aren't We All" Stays as Planned 
### 
Noel Coward's "Hay Fever," origi- 1
nally announced for next Friday eve
ning, will not be produced until Sat
urday, August 7. The necessity for
postponement arises from the illness
of one of the pr rincipals. The date for
"Aren't We All" will remain the same.
"Hay Fever" is the second success
ful play of the talented English au
thor. Coward has come to fame
through his creation of "The Vortex,"
a drama which had tremendously suc
cessful runs in New York and London
and which has received popular ac
claim from a multitude of critics.
"Hay Fever" is full of the nettles of
Mr. Coward's swift, pricking repartee.
It revels in drolleries, of situations as
rollicking as relaxing.
Treated with the same knack of pho
tographic characterization which has
[made the American George Kelly pop
ular, Coward's play offers an excep
! tional combination of dialogue and
! characterization.
j The plot treats the activities and
idiosyncrasies of the family Bliss.
These Blisses are all show-offs. They
give a week-end party, the members
of which are the boy friend of Mrs.
Bliss (who is by the way, a retired
actress) her daughter's suito, a walk
ing stick from the foreign office, her
son's mature vampire, and the blond
ingenue of the head of the family.
The aberrations of the principal char
acter soon reduce the guests to mis
ery, and in a scene fraught with much
cunning, they creep out and make
their way to London while the actress
and her family eat with indifference a
theatrical breakfast.

The versatility of this talented Eng
lishman who is both a composer and
author, has created in "Hay Fever,"
a mirth-provoking drama of the high
est order.
This play, differing to the greatest
possible extent from the recent Dra
matic Council production of "Hamlet,"
provides a variety to the repertoire
of summer quarter plays which is re
freshing. Coward's plays carry with
them a reputation for amusing enter
tainment which indicate a production
which will please patrons of Stanford
dramatics.
