Campus from July 26 to 31. At least
one hundred and twenty-five secre
taries from all over the West will
gather at the University on Sunday to
attend the courses to be given during
the week.
The School is a truly western insti
tution controlled and conducted by
the commercial secretaries of the
eleven Far Western States, assisted by
the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States and Stanford University.
Since the Western Division was
formed six years ago, and the school
established at Stanford, it has grown
steadily both in organization and in
school attendance.
Prominent Instructors
Emphasis has been laid on the se
lection of courses to be given rather
than on the number, and that a high
standard has been reached is proved
by the names of the instructors in
the schedule of the courses published
[elsewhere. Also there is outlined a
series of lectures to be delivered at
every luncheon and dinner meeting.
Prominent men, leaders in various
fields of business, will speak on sub
jects especially interesting and help- j
ful to organization officers.
