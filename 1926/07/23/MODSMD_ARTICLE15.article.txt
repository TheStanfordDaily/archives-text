# Where East and West May Meet

The Arizona delegation on the campus recently held a picnic, doubt
less for the purpose of promoting solidarity and better feeling among
Arizonans. Such affairs are valuable for renewing old friendships and
for developing local pride. Many universities sponsor them.
There are distinct advantages to be gained, however, by enlarging the
group to include representatives from other places. Why not give a
picnic and invite a New Yorker or two, perhaps a Pennsylvanian, even a
man from Texas?
Stanford, especially in summer quarter, is a cosmopolitan school.
People come from all parts of the world for various reasons and exchange
their ideas and ways of doing things. Not only students but professors
too are drawn from many regions and help make our cosmopolitanism
more complete.
In a session such as this, fully as much is to be gained from outside
contacts and friendships as from actual class work. A man may pick up
views of which he was unaware and may thus greatly enlarge his range
of vision.
1 f we are to gather in groups, let us have an affair in which all sec
tions are represented.
