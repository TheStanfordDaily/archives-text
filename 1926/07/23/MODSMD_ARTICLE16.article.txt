# Professorial Politeness
## 
### 
The professor is more than a pedagogue. He is a friend and an exam
ple. His conduct is as important as his teaching. The ideal professor is
above all a gentleman.
Gone are the days of the ferrule, of dictatorial domination, of non
chalant nastiness on the part of professors. Forgotten are the days of
bitter back-biting and hateful haranguing on the part of the student.
The professor is a friend and advisor.
No more in the classroom does a student fear to say, "I beg your
pardon, I didn't hear your question." No longer does a professor react
to such an excuse with a look which one would scarcely confer upon the
filthiest of curs. Instead, he treats the student with common decency,
treats him with the same consideration he would a person with whom he
was engaged in conversation, and repeats the question.
That is. perhaps he does. Most professors do. Those who do not are
conspicuous excepti on s.

THE WOMEN 1 OF STANFORD have built and paid for their Club
house. Many people thought that this was an impossible task. They
have shown real ability in planning a building that is adequate to meet the
needs of the women of the University, in successfully carrying out a
financing campaign over a long period of years, and in extending their
original purposes so that the Clubhouse has grown into a community
center. For sixteen years they have carried on quietly and without osten
tation and now their tenacity of purpose has achieved a victory.
