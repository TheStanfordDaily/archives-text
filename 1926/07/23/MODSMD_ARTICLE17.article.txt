A clay last spring, Gregory Oliver walked into his fraternity house
with the bouquet of wildflowers he had gathered in one of the green, slop
ing fields which ljorder the County Road out beyond the rickety bridge.
Gregory loved flowers. J lis room, though comfortable, had. very little
of natural beauty save the glorious flood of sunlight which poured through
the two windows throughout almost the entire day. So he decided to add
a touch of warmth and beauty to his happy but unimaginative surround
ings. That is why he walked into his house a day last spring with a
bouquet of wildflowers.
Scarcely had Gregory crossed the threshold when Tim King came out
of the billiard room and, noticing his floral display, stopped and questioned,
"Why the corsage, Buddy?"
"Thought I'd stick them in the room. They might not hurt the looks,"
Oliver answered.
Tim commenced to ra/.z him. Others of the brothers joined and lent
their talents to the chiding . . . Oliver finally escaped upstairs.
Arrived in hs room, Olver looked at the flowers, lie was silent for a
moment. Then he sad, "Oh Hell," and dropped them in a waste basket.
, . . lie never brought flowers into his house again.
