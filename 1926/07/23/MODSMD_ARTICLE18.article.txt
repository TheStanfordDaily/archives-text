SONNET
Upon the presentation to a "fair ladye"
of some Hawaiian Jam
I
Thou rare exotic jam of my delight!
0 glowing golden tropic marmalade!
1 swear that thou art magically made,
Not of strange fruits alone, but of the
light
Of moons that gleam in Oriental night,
Flavored with mystery of East! Dis
mayed
For lack of words, I pray the Muse to
aid
Me in my praise of thee. Thou art a
sight
Potent to rouse me to high ecstacy
Such as the monarchs of an olden day
Felt for the spices which their gal
leans sought
Across uncharted seas in far Cathay;
Yet thou art treasure greater than was
brought
To regal gourmets waiting eagerly,
II
When great Ulysses sailed from fallen
Troy
And came, adventure-weary, to the isle
That Circe ruled, that proud queen's
every wile
Was powerless to move him. To decoy
His child-like mariners was easy; to
destroy
Such frail resistance there sufficed a
smile.
But still their king, impervious to
guile,
Made vain the subtle arts she could
employ.
One last resource remained within her
skill
That might avail to bring beneath her
sway
The yet-unconquered one. She brought
a plate
Of guava jam to tempt his iron will.
Mythology still blushes to portray
The swinish gluttony with which he
ate!
"A FAIRE LADYE"

SCRIBES SCORE SCOOP
Daily Palo Alto reporters were the
first on the ground last Tuesday to get
the dirtiest story of the year when,
after closely following Chief Dugan's
fire engine pup, they were forced into
service to fight a fire which threatened
to char some of the best gopher hole
land on the Stanford Estate.
The Chief was attired in a neat suit
of denim by Can't Bust 'Em of Paris.
Campus sportsmen and thrill-chasers
who hurried to the scene were nicely
dressed in the latest mode in after
noon wear. Color was lent to the oc
casion by the tasty pink frock of bro
caded crepe de chine worn by Daily's
star adjective writer.
