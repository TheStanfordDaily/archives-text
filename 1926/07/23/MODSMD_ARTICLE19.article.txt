# PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY HEARS PROF. TATLOCK EXPLAIN CONCORDANCE
## Similar Work Contemplated By Ewald Flugel Says Visiting Speaker 
### 
Dr. John S. P. Tatlock of Harvard,
former head of Stanford's English De
partment, spoke before the members
of the University Philological Associa
tion in the Women's Clubhouse yes
terday afternoon on the Chaucer Con
cordance.
Dr. Tatlock told the society of the
need for a work of this nature to fill a
gap in English philology, saying,
"Geoffrey Chaucer is the only great
English poet to whose works there is
no concordance."
Tatlock, Kennedy Edit
He also told the group that a similar
work had been contemplated by Ewald
Flugel, who before his death was a
professor here. Flugel conceived the
idea of creating a combined dictionary
and concordance. Since his death it
has been found possible to separate
the two works. Dr. Tatlock and Pro
fessor A. G. Kennedy of the English
Department are editing the concor
dance, while the dictionary is being
prepared by a group of Cornell philolo
gists under the direction of Professor
Northrup of that University.
Guidance of Carnegie Institute
The Concordance is being prepared
under the guidance of the Carnegie
Institute, Dr. Tatlock told the society.
Work was begun in 1919 and copy was
finished four years later. The work
went to press in 1924 and is still being
printed. There are approximately
13,000 pages of proof which wil levolve
into a volume of nearly 1100 quarto
pages. The copyreading of almost four
fifths of the proof has been completed.
Dr. Tatlock expressed his hope that
the work will be completed before the
end of this year.

The summer quarter is like the rest
of the year after all! Students are still
buying textbooks at the Bookstore.
