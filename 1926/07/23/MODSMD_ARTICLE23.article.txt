# INTELLIGENCE TESTS SUBJECT OF TALK BY DR. MAUD A. MERRILL
## 
### 
Doctor Maud A. Merrill, Assistant
Professor of Psychology at Stanford,
spoke before the Mothers' Club of
Stanford University last Tuesday aft
ernoon on "The Intelligence Test as a
Measure of School Success."

Quoting the old English proverb,
"An ounce of mother wit is worth a
pound of clergy," Doctor Merrill ex
plained that in an ordinary school ex
amination it is difficult to differenti
ate between "mother wit" or intelli
gence, and "clergy" or information
gained in the classroom. It is the ob
ject of the intelligence test to measure
this native "wit" by making a scien
tific experiment with conditions con
trolled just as a chemist controls the
conditions under which he performs
tests.
Doctor Merrill spoke of the intelli
gence test as a foot-rule by which the
ability to apply old knowledge to a
new situation is measured, but said
that science must be cautious about
imputing undue accuracy to this foot
rule, since it has not yet reached per
fection. She explained the Binet type
of test, in which the use of language
is required, and the performance type,
which does not involve the use of
language in the child being tested, and
showed same examples of material
used in this latter kind of test.
â€¢Brightness a Relative Matter
"Brightness is a relative term, like
tallness or shortness," said Professor
Merrill, and went on to show how
children could be graded according to
brightness just as they can by height.
Research has proved that geniuses
were not stupid in their youth, and
the tradition that some individual
genius was dull as a child is based on
misconception or misinterpretation of
his actions.
The Tuesday meeting was the last
to be held by the Mothers Club this
summer. It will not meet again until
the third Tuesday of next October.
