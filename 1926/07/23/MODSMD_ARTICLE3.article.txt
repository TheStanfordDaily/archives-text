# LIZZIE LOSES LEGS; VULTURES PREY ON HER DECAYING BODY

### 
When a car is left outside the Union
it slowly begins to disintegrate. Why?
Is it because of the weather, this gor
geous California weather? No, no, it
can't be. Then perhaps the junk man
makes his rounds periodically to
gather from this apparent junk pile
what he needs. Ah! There, perchance
we have it —all those who need a
sundry part simply tootle around and
gather.

Lizzie has now one leg propped upon
a log, her front foot rests shoeless
upon the ground, her seat coverings
have rotted away—in fact it can be
vaguely seen that this was once a
Ford. A burial ground for Fords is
advocated where their bones may be
picked by vultures who desire spare
parts for their dying mounts.
