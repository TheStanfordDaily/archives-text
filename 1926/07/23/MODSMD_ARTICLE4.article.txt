# PROFESSOR ESPINOSA DESCRIBES MOORISH INFLUENCES IN SPAIN
## Views Show Architecture of Alhambra and Mosques In Southern Cities 
### 
"The Moors used no human or ani
mal figures in their architecture, but
confined ornamental work to geomet
rical characters," said Professor Aure
lio M. Espinosa, acting head of the
Department of Romanic Languages, in
his illustrated lecture, "Some Pictur
esque Cities of Southern Spain," given
last Tuesday evening in the Little
Theatre.
Arabs Cause Change
He said that the present day orchi
tecture of southern Spain shows much
of the Moorish influence, and sketched
the history of the art and architec
ture of the country from the pre-Chris
tian era. The Arabs, who invaded <
southern Spain in the sixth century,
had 110 civilization of their own and
developed a characteristic architec
ture. The Mosque at Cordova is one
of their first efforts, and shows the
rich interior decoration in red tile and
white stone, which is characteristic
of all the Arabic architecture. The
columns of this mosque were not made
by the Arabs, but collected from old
Carthaginian and Roman ruins. When
St. Ferdinand came into Spain, he
destroyed one-fourth of this beautiful
mosque and built a cathedral on the
ruins. This cathedral tower is some
times considered a part of the mosque
but it is really of a later architectural
period.
"Red City" of Granada
Professor Espinosa showed numer
ous views of the beautiful Alhambra,
or "Red City," built above Granada by
the Moorish kings between 1248 and
1354. On one of the towers the Moors
kept a torch continually burning and
when the Catholic Kings took the city
in 1492 a white cross was planted in
its place.
The views of Seville showed that the
architecture there is an earlier de
velopment than that of Granada. In
the 14th century the city was captured
by the Christians and the buildings
were done over. This combination of
Moorish and Christian architecture,
known as Mudijar, is most seen in
southern Spain.
