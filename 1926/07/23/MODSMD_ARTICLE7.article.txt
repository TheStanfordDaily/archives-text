# ENGLISH-U.S. IDEALS DIFFERENCE DUE TO PURITANS
## Sydney Herbert Claims That Puritanism Is Opposed To Liberalism 
### 
The predominance of Puritanism in
the United States was given by Sydney
Herbert as the fundamental reason for
the differences in the political thought
of the United States and England,
when he spoke in the Little 'lheatre
Monday afternoon. His subject was,
"Democracy in America and Great
Britain: A Personal Impression."

This Puritanism which has become
so much a part of the American form
of thought is directly opposed to liber
alism in that it is based on the theory
that man is essentially bad and must
be forced into goodness. For this rea
son Americans permit much more po
litical regulation of their personal
tastes, morals, and habits than the
English would tolerate. The liberal
theory of England, based directly on
ihe aristocracy which never had a
touch of Puritanism, takes for granted
that "man is a good animal and will
behave himself if he is let alone."
Great Differences Shown
Mr. Herbert pointed out that, where
as England has a sovereign parliament
uncontrolled by anything but the vote
of the people, the United States gov
ernment is based on the theory of the
separation of powers. Neither execu
tive, judiciary, or legislature is su
preme. This system, said the lecturer,
is based on a principle of suspicion,
the American philosophy of govern
ment being that no man can be trusted
with power. The British reaction to
this system is that it is very undemo
cratic and that it produces irresponsi
, bility since each department may
"pass the buck" to another. The
American reaction to the British sys
tem is that it is dangerous to the
I liberty of the people to give such ab
! solute power to one division of govern
! m ent.
Democracy Not Intentional
Mr. Herbert said that the founders
of the American government had not
the slightest intention of forming a
democracy, but were intent only upon
preventing arbitrary government, since
they had suffered from the arbitrary
and irresponsible rule of the colonial
governors. In their zeal to protect the
new nation from such executives they
formed a constitution which, if it func
tioned according to plan, would assure
a complete state of quiescence in the
government.
