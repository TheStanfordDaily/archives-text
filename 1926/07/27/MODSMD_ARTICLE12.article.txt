# STEVENSON, WILLIAMS TO ENTER MILE SWIM HELD AT LONG BEACH
## 
### 
Carl Stevenson, Stanford swimming
star, will enter the open mile swim to
be held by the Long Beach Junior
Chamber of Commerce at Long Beach
on August 1. Bob Williams, also of
Stanford, will compete in the same
race.
Stevenson won the Healdsburg mile
swim held on July 5 in the Russian
River for the second year in succes
sion, while Williams placed fourth.
The competition at Long Beach is
likely to be very keen, and although
Stevenson is expected to win, it seems
that he will have a hard race against
Pierce of Seattle who is going South
for the meet. Williams, always a good
competitive swimmer, may surprise
the critics by taking a second or third
place.
Stevenson intends to make every ef
fort during the coming year to keep
in training for the mile, because he
hopes to win the Healdsburg mile
for the third successive year and so
retain the magnificent trophy cup pre
sented to the victor.
