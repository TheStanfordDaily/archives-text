## 
### 
There are three types of characters
found in the story of the Good Samari
tan which may well be said to repre
sent the people and nations of the
world, said Rev. Charles R. Brown,
D.D., Dean of Yale University Divinity
School, in his sermon in the Memorial
Church, Sunday' morning.

Doctor Brown pointed out in the
world of today, examples of the thieves
who prey upon humanity, the Priests
and Levites who pass by on the other
side of the road, and the Good Samari
tans.

He asked in which of these groups
the poople of the United States should
be classified. "Are we going to hold
aloof, passing by the nations of the
world who are in distress, or shall we
follow in the footstepo of the Good
Samaritan?" was the question put by
the speaker.
