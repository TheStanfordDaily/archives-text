# AUSTRIA'S POLITICAL STATUS BEFORE WAR IS LECTURE SUBJECT
## Dr. A. F. Pribram of Vienna University Is Intimate With Discussion Topics TO TREAT ALL PHASES Reciprocal Influences Will Be Shown of Internal And External Events 
### 
"Austria on the Eve of the Great
War," will be the subject of the lec
ture by Dr. Alfred Francis Pribram
to be delivered at 8 o'clock tonight
in the Little Theatre. The public is
invited to hear Dr. Pribram, who has
for a number of years been connected
with the University of Vienna, and is
an Acting Professor of History at
Stanford for the summer.
The first topic to be discussed will
be the reciprocal influences of ex
terior politics and interior policies in
Austria-Hungary before the war. Dr.
Pribram will endeavor to show how
relations with Germany, Russia, and
the Balkans have definitely shaped
the international political phenomena
in modern times.
Domestic Conditions
An analysis will then be made of
domestic conditions during the period
from 1908 to 1914. Character sketches
of Emperor Francis Joseph I and the
heir, Franz Ferdinand, will be pre
sented by way of demonstrating the
personal side of the situation.

Dr. Pribram will then touch on the
development of the Austrian foreign
policy up to 1914 dealing in a sketchy
fashion with the approximate causes
for the war. The murder of Franz
Ferdinand will be briefly discussed.
In conclusion, some conception of
the results of the World War will be
presented.
Known as an impartial historian,
Dr. Pribram has lectured since the
war to university audiences in Eng
land, France, Czecho-Slovakia. and in
the United States. It is believed that
Dr. Pribram will throw an entirely
new and searching light on conditions
prior to the war, because of his inti
mate contact with the situations dis
cussed and his open-minded point of
view on historical matters. An inter
esting fact is that Dr. Pribram was
born in Londou.

The Doctor expresses himself as
being delighted with this country and
would like to be able to bottle some
California health to take back to
Vienna with him in the fall.
