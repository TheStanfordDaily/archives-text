# "Cars"
## 
### 
There has been much agitation in the past to do away with automo
biles on the Stanford campus. In the spring of 1924 a student body
vote was taken on the subject of not allowing lower division students to
operate cars on the campus and the vote was overwhelmingly in favor
of permitting automobiles to remain. Since then the problem has
slipped into the limbo of forgotten things and automobiles are increas
ingly evident. The administration has tacitly accepted the situation and
has provided various parking spaces for the growing number of cars.
There is little doubt that the automobile has come to stay at Stanford.
The University of Illinois finds that student ownership of automobiles
bears a direct relationship to subnormal scholastic standing, and for this
reason it has passed a regulation prohibiting students from owning or
operating automobiles during the school year.
Whether automobiles on college campuses are desirable or not is a
question in the minds of some, but it would seem that when an individual
is old enough and wise enough to attend college he is responsible enough
to have his own car and to use it with a fitting degree of common sense.
If college is a boarding school where irresponsible youngsters are sent
to be nursed through that difficult age called adolescence, then perhaps
they should be forced to forego the dangerous pleasure of owning an
automobile.
However, the principle of college class work is one of "Ho it, or flunk
out." Basically then, college seeks to put students on their own re
sources, to make them evaluate their time, in a word, to make them self
reliant. It likewise prepares them to a certain extent to meet the world
and its vicissitudes and temptations. To do so it must reconstruct as far
as possible a community that embodies the highest and most advanced
ideas. The college is not a monastery nor is it a kindergarten to protect
children.

STANFORD IS PLAYING host to civic secretaries representing
eleven Far Western states. These men are here attending the annual meet
ing of the Western School for Commercial Secretaries for the purj>ose of
obtaining specific information for the betterment of their communities.
The University is glad to be able to offer housing and recreational facili
ties as well as personnel, and extends a hearty welcome to the school.
