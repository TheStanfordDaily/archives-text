# Mental Recreation
## 
### 
Our ideas of summer are closely connected with our notions of vaca
tion Outings; long, lazy days when we may stretch our limbs beyond the
bounds of office etiquette, farther than professional or vocational walls,
permit. But why not stretch our minds as well and get them out of the
ruts through which they guide us in our accustomed modes of life? In
vacation the doctor may "look at literature," the engineer read French;
the philosopher may study science, and the scientist philosophize.
This extricating the mind from the windings of its accustomed paths,
amounts to intellectual recreation. Summer school students have an un
usually good opportunity to recreate their intellects. Varied fields of learn
ing are open before them and men' from everywhere are here to guide
them in their browsing.
Perhaps some students have come to Stanford this summer for the
sole purpose of advancing along the particular lines which are to consti
tute their life work. Would it not be well for these people to set their
driving purposes aside for a time and let their minds floats outside the
course of their ambitions?
Minds are peculiar spone-like things into which all manner of facts,
ideas and thoughts are taken. Even if many of these are outside the main
trends of our lives, they are valuable not only because they afford mental
recreation in the present but also because they may brighten us in future
when we turn the light of reflection upon them.

NO ONE HAS YET ANSWERED the question put forth by the
Daily Palo Alto as to why the back county road bridge over San Fran
cisquito Creek has not been repaired. It seems to us that this is worthy of
consideration by the powers, whoever they may l>e. Just who is respon
sible for the condition of the bridge and why is this responsibility taken
.so lightly ?
