# ROTH LEASES BASALT QUARRY TO OAKLAND CONTRACTOR'S FIRM
## 
### 
Comptroller Roth, acting for the
Stanford Board of Trustees, has leased
.the valuable quarry property at the
extreme southwest corner of the Uni
versity lands to Hutchinson and Com
pany of Oakland. According to the
royalty provision of the contract, an
income of from $3500 to $12,000 a year
will arise from this source.

The deposit is of the best quality
Basalt rock, useful in road work and
the making of concrete. A well has
been driven to depth of seven hundred
feet and it is estimated that the sup
ply of useful material amounts to be
tween ten and fifteen million cubic
yards.
Construction work involved will in
clude a railway spur track taking off
from the Mayfleld-Los Gatos line, and
the building of a crushing plant with
a capacity of a thousand tons per day.

The small quarry now operated by
the University near Frenchman's cut
will be abandoned when the new one
is completed. The Oakland concern
has agreed to supply local needs at
cost.
