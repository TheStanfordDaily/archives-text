# ART WORK OF JAPAN AND CHINA EXHIBITED IN STANFORD MUSEUM
## Ikeda Collection, Including Ceramics, Embroidery, And Metal Shown 
### 
A delicate peach blow vase of the
Kangshi Period (1662-1722) is one of
the most noteworthy exhibits in the
Chinese and Japanese gallery at the
Stanford Museum. This flat, bottle
shaped vase is rare both for its tints
and because it is a peach blow. The
discoverer of th 6 peculiar glaze and
coloring never disclosed his secret, and
since his death no one has been able
to reproduce it successfully.
The exhibition contains the best
pieces from the private collection of
S. Ikeda, one of Japan's greatest art
connoisseurs, and includes objects in
Ceramics, ivory, metal, embroidery,
wood, and painted silks. Some of the
pieces are priceless family heirlooms.
Bought by Mrs. Stanford
Ikeda had no superior as a judge of
porcelain and kindred wares. After his
death, his widow and son planned to
send this collection to the British
Museum and give the proceeds to the
Emperor to aid the war fund, in mem
ory of the collector. While the son
was in the United States he visited
Mrs. Stanford at her San Francisco
home. She became interested in the
story.of the memorial and, after see
ing the collection, purchased it for the
Stanford Museum.
Japanese Pottery Displayed
Satsuma, Kyoto, Imari, and Bizen
ware are included in the pottery ex
hibits. A figure of a fox dressed as
a man, done in 1650 A.D. by Nonomura
Ninsei, the greatest of all Japanese
potters, illustrates the great beauty of
his method of combining various kinds
of glaze. As an example of Japanese
Bizen ware there is shown a figure of
a hermit seated on a carp. This is one
of the rarest productions of the Bizen
kilns and was one of Ikeda's favorites.
The cheerfully supercilious expression
on the hermit's face is a work of high
art.
Keibun Silk Painting
The paintings on silk are done in
the direct style demanded by the ma
terials used. A stroke of India ink on
silk cannot be altered, and for this
reason a Japanese artist must know
his subject thoroughly before he
paints. Keibun's picture of bamboo and
a sparrow, shown in the exhibit, was
probably done in an hour's time, but
with consummate ability and skill.
Keibun was a pupil of the Okyo School
in 1843.

was in the United States he visited
Mrs. Stanford at her San Francisco
home. She became interested in the
story.of the memorial and, after see
ing the collection, purchased it for the
Stanford Museum.
Japanese Pottery Displayed
Satsuma, Kyoto, Imari, and Bizen
ware are included in the pottery ex
hibits. A figure of a fox dressed as
a man, done in 1650 A.D. by Nonomura
Ninsei, the greatest of all Japanese
potters, illustrates the great beauty of
his method of combining various kinds
of glaze. As an example of Japanese
Bizen ware there is shown a figure of
a hermit seated on a carp. This is one
of the rarest productions of the Bizen
kilns and was one of Ikeda's favorites.
The cheerfully supercilious expression
on the hermit's face is a work of high
art.
Keibun Silk Painting
The paintings on silk are done in
the direct style demanded by the ma
terials used. A stroke of India ink on
silk cannot be altered, and for this
reason a Japanese artist must know
his subject thoroughly before he
paints. Keibun's picture of bamboo and
a sparrow, shown in the exhibit, was
probably done in an hour's time, but
with consummate ability and skill.
Keibun was a pupil of the Okyo School
in 1843.
