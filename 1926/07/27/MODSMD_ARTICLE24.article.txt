# HOFFMAN IS RIVAL OF HAROLD OSBORNE FOR TITLE IN DECATHLON
## 
### 
Clifford Hoffman, Stanford weight
star, has developed into an all-round
athlete of note and is to be considered
a serious contender in future decath
lon championships. This is proved by
his demonstration of a week ago when
he annexed 6348 points in the ten
event contest, in which he was com
peting for the first time, to finish
third to two recognized champions,
and break the existing decathlon shot
put record.

Such authorities as Hunter of the
Olympic Club track team, and Os
borne, who hold the decathlon title,
hail Hoffman as a serious contender
for the all-round championship next
year. The decathlon is held annually
at the National A.A.U. championships
at Philadelphia, and includes such
events as the high jump, pole vault,
shot put, discus, hurdles, sprints, and
middle-distance runs.

Hoffman entered the event this year
with no knowledge of the high jump
or the pole vault, and no experience in
distance running. He was forced to
rely on his prowess in the weight
tossing events to bring up his average,
and his final performance was remark
able. Since the Philadelphia test Hoff
man has learned to vault and jump.
These were the two events in which
he was weakest this year.

Hoffman intends to train next spring
and enter the championships again
next year under Templeton, the Stan
ford track coach, and there is every
reason to expect great improvement
in his showing.
