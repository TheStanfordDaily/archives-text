## 
### 
Dr. Jordan, in considering the prob
lem of preventing malaria and other
dangerous diseases, proposes the in
troduction of the mosquito-fish to
clean up mosquito-infested waters. He
is the greatest living authority on fish
in the world and has given much at
tention to the success of this specie
of fish in the Hawaiian Islands.
Successful in Islands and Abroad
The Mosquito fish or (Gambusia
patruelis) was found by .-Alvin Seale
near Galveston, Texas. The city of
Honolulu, in 1904, sent a draft of
$1500 to Dr. Jordan, asking him to dis
cover and send to the Islands a mo
squito-eating fish. Dr. Jordan sent
Seale, then a senior at Stanford, to
find them.
Mr. Seale took the fish to Honolulu
where numerous experiments proved
them to be an effective destroyer of
mosquitoes. The "Gumbusia" has lived
and multiplied in all available waters
in Hawaii. It does not migrate to the
sea, and It does not attack other fish.
Whole World Sees It
From Honolulu the fish has been
taken to Formosa, from where it has
gone to Luzon. It is now in Southern
Japan and China, and will eventually
migrate the world over. Dr. Jordan
has received correspondence asking
for the fish from Argentina, London,
Paris, Berlin, Macedonia, Rome, Flo
rence, Singapore, and many other lo
calities. V
