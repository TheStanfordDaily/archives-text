# PLANT DISEASE STUDY IN BOTANICAL GARDEN
## 
### 
Tucked away in the corner of two
roads to the west of the Quad is a
small garden containing several glass
and lath houses. It is so inconspicuous
and hemmed in by hedges that ordi
narily the passerby does not notice
it. It is, however, the botanical garden.

Small though the garden may be, its
importance is none the less dimin
ished, for it fills both a practical and
theoretical need. Nearly every plant
disease common to this region can be
found flourishing on the plants and
flowers which are used by Professor
J. I. W. McMurphy in supplying his
classes with material. The variety
ranges from desert cactus to the most
fragile house plant. Experiments in
disease control are studied on these
plants.

Several kinds of wild and cultivated
snapdragons are grown each season in
this same garden by L. A. Waitzinger
for his study in genetics. He is also
assisting Dr. L. L. Burlingame in an
extensive research into heredity and
genetics with several varieties of
Clarkia.
