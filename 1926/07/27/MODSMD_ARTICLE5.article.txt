### 
Dr. Hardin Craig will speak on the
subject, "Scholarship and Its Rivals,"
in the Little Theatre, at 4:30 p.m.,
Wednesday. This topic has proved to
be a favorite with the audiences of
the popular lecturer, because of its
universal interest to academic groups.

The Philological Quarterly, "A Jour
nal Devoted to Scholarly Investigation
in Classical and Modern Languages
and Literature," is edited by Dr. Craig,
who is head of the English Depart
ment at the University of lowa. Dr.
Craig was educated at Centre, Chi
cago, and Princeton, receiving a Ph.D.
degree from the latter institution. He
has been connected with the faculties
of the University of Minnesota and of
Princeton, as well as that of lowa.
During his professorial career he has
edited a number of the classics and
contributed to many magazines and
periodicals.
Dr. Craig thus comes as a man of
high scholastic attainments and wide
experience, as well as holding the
reputation of being an exceedingly
fine speaker. His association with
many of our universities qualifies him
to discuss the rivals of scholarship
with breadth of vision.
