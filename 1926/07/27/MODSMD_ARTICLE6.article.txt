# O. CARRINGTON SINGS, DR. CUBBERLEY TALKS AT WEEKLY MEETING
## 
### 
A special feature at the Thursday
luncheon of the Education Club was
the singing by Otis Carrington, who
is the music instructor of the Sequoia
Union High School, Redwood City. He
is not only a talented singer, but is
also the author of a number of popular
operettas.
The attendance continues to grow
and over a hundred men listened to
Dr. Ellwood P. Cubberley, Dean of
the School of Education, describe the
difficulties under which the Riverside
Series of Educational Texts had been
produced. As editor of the series, he
said his aim had been to produce
books that would contribute to the
advancement of education by organiz
ing the various fields into convenient
teaching units. It is peculiarly difficult,
he stated, to find men who can do this
type of work. Many people, however,
can teach a course after it has been
organized. He feels that this has been
the great contribution of his series
which today is the largest published
in any country and, the publishers
claim, the best.

Dr. Fred Ayer, Professor of Educa
tion, University of Washington, will
be the principal speaker next Thurs
day.
