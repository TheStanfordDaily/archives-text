# JORDAN TO GIVE SERIES OF EVOLUTION TALKS BEGINS THURSDAY
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan will give
the first of a series of talks on the
subject of evolution on Thursday at
4:15 p.m. in the Little Theatre. The
topic of the lecture will be, "The
Truth of Transformism."

The use of the term "Transformism"
will be recommended by Dr. Jordan as
a substitute for the more popular
"Evolution" on the grounds that the
latter does not express the thought
to be conveyed. The word "transform
ism" breaks away from the conota
tion of unfolding something which has
formerly been confounded. The oppo
sition to the teaching of evolution,
and the stands of certain unreasoning
radicals and conservatives will be dis
cussed.
Dr. Jordan asks that any questions
which members of his audience wish
to present be handed to him in written
form at the close of the lecture. He
will answer them the following Thurs
day.
The succeeding topics will be, "Fac
tors in Organic Evolution," and "Philo
sophy of Evolution."
