# SATURDAY EXCURSION LED BY ART TEACHER HAS UNIQUE FEATURE
## Exclusive Peninsula Estates And Golden Gate Park Will Be Visited 
### 
. The Zoological exhibits in Golden
Gate Park, San Francisco, will be
.among the features of interest on next
Saturday's automobile excursion which
will be conducted by Professor Arthur
B. Clark of the Stanford Art Depart
ment. Professor Clark says the Park
aquarium, which contains a remark
able assortment of brilliantly colored
and unusually shaped fish, is equal in
Â«very respect to the famous aquarium
in Holland.
The Grant estate and the George
Newhall place have been added to the
list of peninsula beauty spots which
will be visited on the way to the City.
The Flood estate, in Menlo Park, and
the Templeton Crocker and George
Pope estates of Burlingame will also
be seen by the excursionists.
To those particularly interested in
the tine arts, the visit to the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor, built
in the French Renaissance style of
the period of Louis XVI, and patterned
after the French art gallery of the
same name, will be the high point of
the day. A view of this great white
building, standing in Lincoln Park
on the summit of a hill overlooking
the Golden Gate is an inspiration in
itself. It was built by Adolph B.
Spreckels, in memory of the California
Soldiers Fallen in the Great War, and
was opened early last year with an
exhibition of priceless French art,
mostly from the Luxembourg collec
tion, sent over by the French Govern
ment.
The automobiles for the trip will be
furnished by the Fortune Yellow Cab
Company which sends its most reliable
drivers on these excursions. The party
will leave from in front of the Stanford
Union at 9 a.m. tomorrow and will re
turn about 4 p.m. The price for the
trip is $3.00.
