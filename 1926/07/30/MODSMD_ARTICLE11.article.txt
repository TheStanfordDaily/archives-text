### 
The players in the rollicking com
edy, "Hay Fever," present an unusual
array of seasoned talent and tempera
mental fitness for their roles.
Miss Patrice Nauman will play the
part of Judith Bliss in place of Miss
Dorothea Wilson whose illness pre
vents her appearance. Miss Nauman
is a well-known campus actress, hav
ing starred in "Ace High," "Fashion,"
and "Meet the Wife." Her type of act
ing is well suited to bring out the
comic possibilities in the character of
Judith Bliss, the perpetual actress.
The rather self-admiring writer and
feminine psychologist, David Bliss, is
being portrayed in an attractive fash
ion by J. S. Doron.
Jackie Coryton, the engenue friend
of David Bliss, is presented in a new
light, totally different from the pseudo
sophisticated flapper manner. Miss
Enid Wall instills her own personality
into the part and adds a touch of wist
fulness which is quite original.
The role of Myra Arundel, ultra
siren, is being played by Miss Lucie
Bentley of "Ride a Cock-Horse" and
"Dear Brutus" fame.
Miss Norma Seib is developing the
rather difficult character of the intelli
gent though wilful young modern,
Sorel Bliss.
The part of Simon Bliss, who is
quite as headstrong and ingenius as
his sister, Sorel, is portrayed by Byron
Harvey. Harvey's dancing in previous
campus productions has attracted con
siderable attention. This is his first at
tempt at a dramatic role.
The acting of Raymond Haizlip as
Richard Greatham, "the walking stick
from the Foreign Office," shows a
great deal of promise.
The setting for "Hay Fever" is a
hall in an English country house. It
has been very cleverly executed by
Leslie Kiler and his staff and em
bodies the latest developments in
scene technique.
The play should be one of the most
intriguing comedies ever presented at
Stanford. It moves and scintillates
around the members of the Bliss fam
ily whose amusing eccentricities re
call the Sangers in "The Constant
Nymph."
