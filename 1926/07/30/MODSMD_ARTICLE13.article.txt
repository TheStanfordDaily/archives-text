# AUSTRIA'S STATUS PRIOR WORLD WAR LECTURE SUBJECT
## Balance of Power Changed; Britain, France, Italy Can Hold Power 
### 
"International policies of the Au
stria-Hungarian monarchy prior to'the
Great War can be understood only
through a knowledge of internal con
ditions," according to the statement
made by Dr. A. F. Pribram, visiting
professor from the University of
Vienna, in his lecture last Tuesday
evening on the subject of "Austria
BeforS the World War."
Dr. Pribram enumerated in logical
sequence the events both external and
internal prior to the war, giving the
subject life through his characteriza
tion of the commanding figures made
possible by' first-hand contacts with
them.
Emperor Franz Joseph, according to
Dr. Pribram, is "known to most people
through the shadow he cast on his
torical events rather than as a per
sonality. The emperor was described
as a man of common sense, wit, pleas
ing personality, dignity, and conserva
tive taste in the arts, but singularly
lacking in imagination. In the later
years of his life he enjoyed great re
spect through his age, accomplish
ments, and personal charm.
Composite Character
The composite character of the peo
ple of the dual monarchy including
Slavs, Poles, Czechs, and others, al
ways presented a problem of main
taining internal peace; and at the
same time necessitated great care in
the international policies, where revo
lution was feared if a strong growth
within the nation sided with opposing
powers with whom it had racial ties.
The effects of this factor were shown
through a resume of the international
treaties and the Balkan wars.
Dr. Pribram explained his refrain
ing from a discussion of the causes
of the Great War on the basis that
they were too many and too deep to
be satisfactorily handled, depending
on colonial policies, commercial jeal
ousies, and territorial differences. His
only conclusive statements on the sub
ject were that the Austria-Hungarian
people were not responsible for their
nation entering the conflict, and that
the government "could not tolerate
the threatening attitude of the Serbs."
Results of War
In treating the results of the war,
Dr. Pribram stated that the balance
of power has been greatly changed
through the elimination of three great
powers, the Dual Monarchy being out
of the consideration permanently
while Russia and Germany are tem
porarily not to be considered. He feels
that Great Biitain, France, and United
Italy will hold the power as long as
they stay together.
The conclusion drawn from the re
cent course of European history is
that no one nation will ever be able
to master the situation. Dr. Pribram
holds forth the hope that the "League
of Nations is leading the way to a
real golden age on earth" and that we
should follow the maxim of Carlisle,
"Work and Don't Despair."
