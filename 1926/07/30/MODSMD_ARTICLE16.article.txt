A telephone without an operator is a useless thing. Stanford dormi
tory 'phones have no operators froni 9:30 in the evening to 9 o'clock the
next morning. Switchboard operators at the halls generally take an
hour or so off at meal time which still further reduces service.
Under these conditions students living in dormitories are deprived of
telephonic communication with the "outside world" for a large portion of
the day.
(Don't expect telegrams at night.)
The Union does not even have a telephone from which calls can be
sent out during the late hours of the night and at the times when the
switchboard operator is doing something else.
(Hours for sudden sickness should be arranged when the telephone is
available to call a doctor.)
There may be but few instances during the course of a year when ab
solute need for telephone service would arise but even one imperative hurry
call is sufficient to warrant all-night, all-time service.
(Don't set fire to the hall at night and then try to get the fire depart
ment by telephone.)
Most long distance calls are put through at night because there is
greater chance then of the desired one being found, as well as opportunity
for better connection.
(At the very hours when all the students are in the halls there is
no service.)
The students are paying for the service which as it is at present
wholly inadequate to meet needs that might arise.
(Don't try to get the police station from the Union at night.)
Telephone service to be of worth should be efficient, prompt, and
courteous. The 'phone has taken too great a place in every-day life to
become an instrument of chance.
(An attempt was made to get "P.A. 2900" to verify the hours in which
there is no telephone service. Neither Toyon nor the Union could be
reached by 'phone.)
