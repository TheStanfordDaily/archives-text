# "Sacred Cows" on the Campus
## 
### 
An exchange professor at the University of California has recently
condemned the rank and lile of college newspapers for their uncritical at
titude toward student activities and educational objectives. He asserts
there are too many "Sacred Cows" on every campus; too many people
and traditions which the student does not dare to criticise. He further
advocates a "regular campus satirist" who will turn a critical eye on his
college and bring its foibles and pretensions before his fellows.
Untrammeled expression of opinion and criticism is essential to any
progressive newspaper, but even more indispensible to progressive college
students, too many of whom suffer because strict faculty regulation and
campus taboos establish a deadline beyond which opinion is unwelcome.
Radicalism, even revolt are superior to a meek subservience.
If universities do not allow freedom of thought and expression among
their students, they simply strive to destroy the forces which created
them. All modern thought and learning has developed out of a certain
skeptical attitude of mind, an unwillingness to accept old traditions and
dgomas. If a college seeks to smother all opinions disagreeable to its
"Sacred Cows," does it not tend to check its own advance?
Leadership is sought among the ranks of college men and it is never
found in blind followers of accepted doctrines. If university men are to
be leaders, they must be allowed to lead.
