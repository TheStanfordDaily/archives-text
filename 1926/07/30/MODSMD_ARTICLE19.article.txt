Today's Travelogue—The Cactus
Gardens
Located approximately 78 fathoms
to the north of Palm Drive and bear
ing NNE 162 ells from the museum, a
region remarkable for its flora and
fauna can be readily found. Discovery
of this region is credited to a man by
the name of Muggs, although unofficial
reports have been circulated that it
was first entered by a mariner who
mistook the Big Dipper for the Great
Horned Spoon. After hunting for dia
mond bracelets in the sand for several
nights without any satisfaction he
gave up the ghost and died of starva
tion, or vice versa. For this reason no
word of him has ever been heard.
Partially educated men wearing soft
collars still go there in small cars of
a popular make to pray for his soul.
They seldom go alone.

"Honey," said the co-ed, "you have
never been kissed before, have you?"
"No, dear, never!"
"Are you sure I am the only girl you
have ever kissed, sweetheart?"
"Yes, dear, and not only that but
you are the best kisser!"

Define a Co-ed
The Secretaries the other day esti
mated the capacity of the stadium in
terms of the diameter of Mr. Ray
Smith. This gives us the idea of estab
lishing new units of measurement for
other campus features.
Why not for instance compile li
brary statistics in terms of the lengths
of chewed pencils left on the desks?
Or refer to the species of cactus in
the gardens of that name by the num
ber of lockouts given? Remember
Toyon rooms according to the hours
of card-playing in each. Number the
houses on the Row according to the
number of empty bottles found within.
AND, indeed, define a co-ed in the
. (How would you fill
this?)

A great mob was gathered in front
ol' the building. From all sides, slowly
and silently, more came to join the
throng and all stood together subdued,
as if in anticipation of some dread
event. What was it that had thus si
lenced them and made them appear as
ghostly spectators awaiting the last
judgment?
Suddenly a door was opened and
a tremor of animation ran through
the assemblage. Then, as if answer
ing the call of the Pied Piper, the
women broke loose and, rushing
through the entrance, disappeared.
The men were left alone, standing
forsaken on the steps of Roble. It was
lockout time.
Fordsign—Don't call me Aimee just
because I'm missing.

Look on the bright things of life!
Just imagine mosquitos were to go
about humming the latest songs. Yes—
we have no —you know.

Sword duels have gone out of date
but we suggest that baseballs-at-fifty
feet will make an excellent substitute.

The original hard-boiled-man re
marked to people gathered around
the body of a man who had fallen
from the room of a 15-story building,
"Kick him and see if he grunts."

A great mob was gathered in front

Today's Travelogue—The Cactus
Gardens
Located approximately 78 fathoms
to the north of Palm Drive and bear
ing NNE 162 ells from the museum, a
region remarkable for its flora and
fauna can be readily found. Discovery
of this region is credited to a man by
the name of Muggs, although unofficial
reports have been circulated that it
was first entered by a mariner who
mistook the Big Dipper for the Great
Horned Spoon. After hunting for dia
