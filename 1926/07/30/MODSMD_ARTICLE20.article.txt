The Editor, Sir—
I am glad to see the Daily take up
the matter of roads on the campus.
Beside the road mentioned in a pre
vious issue there are many other
roads that need repair. Why can't the
roads in back of Toyon and Branner
Halls be made of something besides
just gravel which is extremely dusty
in dry weather, and muddy and full
of ruts in wet weather.
Comptroller Roth has leased the
quarry to a company which is inter
ested in road-building. 1 wonder if he
has in mind using some of the output
of this contract to improve the campus
loads. I hope so. —H. D. Towers.
