### 
Grades for students enrolled for the
first half of the summer quarter will
be mailed to them at the end of the
quarter if a self-addressed stamped
envelope is left at the Registrar's of
fice. Envelopes may be procured at the
window for five cents, the profits of
the sale going to the Stanford Home
for Convalescent Children.
