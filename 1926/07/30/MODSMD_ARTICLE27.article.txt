# HARDIN CRAIG SHOWS PREVALENT FAULTS IN SCHOLARSHIP SYSTEM
## 
### 
Professor Hardin Craig, of the Eng
lish Department of the University of
lowa, in his lecture in the Little
Theatre Wednesday afternoon, de
nounced the scholarship credit system
in modern American universities as
one of the "Rivals of Scholarship."
He says that credits are not a mea
sure of achievement but of time spent.
He asked why a certain degree of pro
ficiency instead of a certain number
of hours should not be the standard
for a major. As a remedy for the pres
ent condition he advocates the ap
pointment of an examining board,
which he says will also solve another
difficulty facing scholarship, namely
; the quarrel between men who publish
and men who don't. At present, accord
ing to Professor Craig, while the in
structors have the absurd task of ex
amining their own pupils, there is no
measure of teaching ability or schol
arly accomplishment except the num
ber of works published. Accordingly,
men who wish to let their ideas ma
ture and to spend their time implant
i ing them in the minds of the under
graduates, are underrated.
Scholarship Aims
The aims of scholarship, according
to the speaker, are to discover new
facts and new meanings in old facts,
j and to sponsor scientific truth, giving
! out what the scholar thinks is true
and not what he thinks the people
want. He asserted that the scholar is
an instructor and was never meant to
be an entertainer, yet, he complains,
professors are frequently judged by
their popularity with, the students in
stead of by the value of their teaching.

Literature Commercialized
In speaking further of the rivals of
scholarship Professor Craig discussed
; the relation between scholarship and
| literature. He said that literature of
the present day is commercialized, for
malized, and terribly confused in its
purpose. It has, he stated, discovered
that life is bewildering, and has be
come, itself, bewildered. As an exam
; pie he cited Menken, of whom he ob
served that wherever he starts, he
meets himself coming back. Professor
Craig declared that more scholarship
Is needed in literature, to teach writers
that life today is not much more com
j plicated than it has been in the past.
!He said that there is no such thing
las a man coming from the plow to
write books. To write well, a man must
be what he called "book-minded."
Professor Craig concluded by say
| ing that he is not afraid of the "Jazz
! Age" and the young people have never
frightened him, but he feels that what
lis needed is for teaching, research,
i and literature to be united for the in
-1 crease and dissemination of knowl-
I edge.
