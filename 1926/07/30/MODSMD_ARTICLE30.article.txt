# SPORTS OF 1926
## Cinder-Path Fighters 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The appearance in the New York State amateur boxing tournament re
cently of Willie Sullivan, a former member of Georgetown University's record
breaking two-mile relay team, brings to mind other cinder-path stars who
were also fighters. Joie Ray's ambitions to star in the ring, both as an ama
teur an da professional, are well known, but Joie proved a much better runner
than a fighter.
But there was another track star, a sprinter who competed at the same
time as the Kankakee flyer, whose success with his fists in impromptu battles
led him seriously to consider a ring career.
After running only a few inches behind Charley Paddock in the Olympic
100-meter dash at Antwerp in 1920, and running anchor on the record-breaking
400-meter relay team, Morris Kirksey felt that he had convinced the world as
to his ability as a sprinter and looked about for an opportunity to show what
he could do with his fists. The opportunity was not long in coming.
When the time came to give out the prizes, Morris went around to the
stadium to get his two medals. A little thing like forgetting his competitor's
ticket didn't bother him at all, and he tried to crash the gate with the aid of
doughboy French, cigar coupons, and a cigarette or two. But the two guards
wouldn't let him in, and when he tried to force his way between them, they
barred his progress with their guns. Morris merely grabbed the weapons and
looked down the nozzle of each, and laughingly started through the gate.
Then a battle royal started, in which reserves from the police and fire
departments had to be called, and in which Morris was finally subdued by a
crack on the head with a rifle butt. Bob Weaver and other Olympic officials
soon had Kirksey released from the local bastile, and when, in the presence
of the American ambassador, he was asked if he wanted an apology from the
stadium officials, he replied that all he wished was to finish his little argument
with those two gendarmes who had first barred his way.
But they, alas, were quite hors du combat!
