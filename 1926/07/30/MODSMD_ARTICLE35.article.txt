# SAN MATEO COUNTY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR BRIDGE
## 
### 
The San Mateo County supervisors
are held responsible for the failure
to erect a new bridge on the County
Koad in a recent article by D. E.
O'Keefe, a member of a local pioneer
family who is intimately familiar with
local history. Santa Clara County, ac
cording to O'Keefe, has made appro
priations for the construction of a new
bridge and road, but the northern
county has repeatedly refused to act.
The original County Road was that
which leads past Sequoia Hall out to
the Stock Farm and past the old Mon
ohan property which was recently pur
chased by the University. O'Keefe,
whose article appears in the Redwood
City Times Gazette says, "In 1875 the
course of the road running past the
Monohan property was changed. A
short detour was made to meet a nar
row span of the creek over which a
bridge was constructed. A short de
tour was made to meet a narrow span
of the creek over which a bridge was
constructed. This was used for a num
ber of years. It ran through to May
field. When the University was erected
the course of the road ran through the
campus. Leland Stanford went before
the supervisors of this county |San
Mateo j and asked that the road be
abandoned, agreeing to construct a
similar thoroughfare to the rear of
the stock farm and a quarter of a mile
up from the old road. The proposition

was accepted. The new thoroughfare
was accepted and the old road aban
doned. A wooden bridge was con
structed over the creek just below the
Meyer estate. A similar proceeding
was had by the Santa Clara County
supervisors.
"Subsequent boards of supervisors
have held that the proceedings by the
former board were irregular and not
binding, and so, for over twenty years
a controversy has existed between the
board of supervisors of this county
and the supervisors of Santa Clara
county. The wooden bridge built by
Senator Stanford is in a dilapidated
condition not safe for travel. The
supervisors of Santa Clara want a new
span and have appropriated funds for
that purpose, but the supervisors of
this county will do nothing, claiming
that the bridge should be erected on
the old road. The impasse cannot be
overcome although every angle has
been tried to do so.
"It is hinted now that inasmuch as
the University owns the land on near
ly all sides of the bridge, it will take
the matter out of the hands of the
county officials and will build at its
own expense a new concrete span to
cost $10,000."

whose article appears in the Redwood
City Times Gazette says, "In 1875 the
course of the road running past the
Monohan property was changed. A
short detour was made to meet a nar
row span of the creek over which a
bridge was constructed. A short de
tour was made to meet a narrow span
of the creek over which a bridge was
constructed. This was used for a num

abandoned, agreeing to construct a
similar thoroughfare to the rear of
the stock farm and a quarter of a mile
up from the old road. The proposition

was accepted. The new thoroughfare
was accepted and the old road aban

Meyer estate. A similar proceeding
was had by the Santa Clara County
supervisors.

The San Mateo County supervisors
are held responsible for the failure
to erect a new bridge on the County
Koad in a recent article by D. E.
O'Keefe, a member of a local pioneer
family who is intimately familiar with
local history. Santa Clara County, ac
cording to O'Keefe, has made appro
priations for the construction of a new
bridge and road, but the northern
county has repeatedly refused to act.
The original County Road was that
which leads past Sequoia Hall out to
the Stock Farm and past the old Mon
ohan property which was recently pur
chased by the University. O'Keefe,
