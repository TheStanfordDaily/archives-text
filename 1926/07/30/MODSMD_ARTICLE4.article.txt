# SECRETARIES ISSUE "GOOD MORNING"â€”A SPORTING DIPLOMAT
## 
### 
"Good Morning," official publi
cation of the Western School of
Commercial Secretaries, is even
more diplomatic in its presenta
tion of news than the Daily Palo
Alto is said to be. Tuesday after
noon, the champion baseball team
of 1925 defended its title against
a newly organized team called
the "Challengers."
Account printed on green sport
ing page included the line-up and
one substitute. Human elements
of the game were furnished by
references to pop bottles and seat
cushions. Detailed story of the
game was told, and not only each
play, but the reason for it, the
umpire's decision concerning it,
and the crowd's reaction to it.
The only points of the game
omitted were those not important
to an organization in good-fellow
ship. The score, and mention of
which side won, were left out.
