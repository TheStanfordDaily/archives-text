# ROAD IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE COMPLETED
## 
### 
Among campus improvements listed
on this year's program are the surfac
ing of the road that passes Branner
and Toyon Halls, and the building of a
sidewalk from Encina to the gymna
sium. Preparatory work on both enter
prises has been completed. Last year,
the Branner Road was widened, grad
ed, and rocked. It will be completed
in the fall. The ground on which the
sidewalk is to be built has been filled
so that it may settle before cementing.
