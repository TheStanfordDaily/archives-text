# JORDAN GIVES FIRST OF EVOLUTION TALKS
## 
### 
:
Dr. Jordan gave the first of a series j
of talks on evolution in the Little 1
Theatre yesterday afternoon. His sub- j
ject was "The Truth of Transform-1
ism."
The use of this term was recom-i
I
mended as a substitute for the word j
"Evolution," on the grounds that the !
latter does not express the thought to |
be conveyed. "Transformism" breaks I
away from the connotation of unfold- j
ing something which has previously j
been folded.
Dr. Jordan also discussed the oppo- j
sition to the teaching of evolution, and I
the stands of certain unreasoning radi- J
cals and conservatives.
