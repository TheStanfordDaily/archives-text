"Europe is beginning to realize that
education is a prerequisite to demo
cracy," said Viscount Astor in an in
terview when he visited the Univer
sity last Tuesday. "Spain, Portugal,
and Russia are beginning to realize
that democratic government will fail
without proper educational back
ground. The tremendous progress of
education in the United States is a
thing which interests me very much,"
he added.
Viscount Astor, who has made nu
merous trips to this country, remarked
on the great progress of the United
States in all lines.
However, he finds one thing lacking,
that being any marked spirit of neigh
borly friendliness. He said, "I was
brought up to love God and my neigh
bor," but he noticed that that philoso
phy was not widespread here. He ex
plained that he applied this principle
to international amity, and when asked
if he had in mind the debt situation,
replied that he only referred to inter
national friendship.
In referring to the prohibition situa
tion, Lord Astor said, "Alcohol is a
substitute for a good performance."
He also declared that liquor was at
the bottom of political corruption, say
ing that the big liquor interests ex
erted tremendous influence upon the
masses.
The British peer was actively inter
| ested in athletics while a student at
Oxford, but he declined to make any
comparisons or contrasts between Eng
[ lish and American athletics, excusing
himself on the grounds that he was
not sufficiently familiar with Ameri
can- athletics.
When asked to express an opinion
about Stanford, Lord Astor protested
that he had been here only a few
moments and was not prepared to give
an impression save that he was very
pleased to have the opportunity to
visit the institution.
