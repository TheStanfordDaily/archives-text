Decay of "Youth Movement"
In his talk tomorrow he will ex
plain the difficult position of young
German.- who returned from the Great
War and faced the task of rehabilitat
ing a nation plunged into political and
economic chaos.
The leading tendencies of Germany
immediately following the war were
centered around the "Youth Move
ment" which had a great influence be
fore the conflict as a reflection of the
revolt of youth, and, with its close,
became the most important expression
of the desire to find a new and ac
ceptable outlook on life. The longing
tor an irrationalistic view of the
world i "weltanschaung") and the suc
cess of Spengler, will be discussed in
this connection.
After a consideration of the influ
ence of Dostoevsky and other writers
Doctor Geiger will give a survey of the
political tendencies of Germany from
the Bolshevistic group on the extreme
left, to the Fascistic party of the ex
treme right, and will discuss the decay
of the "Youth Movement" in late years,
caused, among other things, by the
intrusion of political parties.
