# Besides Brains, Beauty

Doctor Term An lias found in his extensive tests that children of
exceptional intelligence are above the average in physical strength. This
is encouraging for the brawny football hulks. It also starts a train of
thought that leads to refutation of the cherished illusion that beauty
correlates with "dumbness."

If strength correlates with intelligence, then, since it cannot be denied
that strength goes with physical well-being, and physical well-being is a
requisite to beauty, it is highly logical to conclude that intelligence
correlates with beauty. In that case, beauty should be a deep concern
of the University.

This opens vast vistas of yet unexplored statistical fields, and should
provide a fat subject for an original and useful Doctor's Thesis. The
correlation between physical comeliness and intelligence could be defi
nitely solved, and the problem of admitting students to the University
wotdd be enormously simplified because the time and expense of giving
and correcting intelligence tests would be eliminated. The energy and
funds now used for this prosaic purpose would be liberated for higher
and finer things—perhaps the establishment of a chair of beauty culture —
with possible results that defy phophecy.

Experts oil admission would necessarily be artists, and the whole
social structure could conceivably be revolutionized and bettered by the
placing of greater emphasis on esthetic values in life.
