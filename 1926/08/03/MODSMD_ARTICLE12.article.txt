# An Exceptional Opportunity

Members of the summer quarter faculty and student body may avail
themselves of unusually favorable conditions to visit Yosemite Valley the
week end of August 6-8.
A tour of California's famous playground, internationally known for
its beauty, with all transportation, meals, and hotel accommodations ar
ranged for at a very low figure, presents a proposition which is truly worth
while. Heads of departments have been asked to excuse persons intend
ing to make the trip from their Friday classes, thus making possible a
three-day excursion. Great educational value will be found in the geo
logical analysis which Professor Warren D. Smith, organizer of the party,
will present to all interested in that phase.
