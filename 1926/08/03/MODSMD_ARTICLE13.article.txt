# Gambler's Philosophy
## 
### 
In an address before the convention of Commercial Secretaries, the
speaker brought out forcibly the crying need for "live wires" in all
forms of endeavor. When he finished two men in the audience looked
at each other and shook their heads. As far as they were concerned the
speech was "idle bunk."
This is the typical weakling's reaction to the suggestion of strict
attention to business and hard work. It is found among stevedores and
senators; university men and union laborers.
But the weakling, in the majority of cases, is not to be pitied. The
world does not move too rapidly for him; he usually thinks he is a
little ahead of the world. He considers his intellect somewhat superior
to the endowments of his fellows and assumes, that by thinking a little
more quickly than they, he may escape considerable arduous labor. This
is a gambler's philosophy and those who practice it. may their station
in life and occupations be ever so orthodox, are simply living, more or
less, by their wits.
hewer heartaches accompany a life spent in honest endeavor than a
year spent in attempting to break a roulette bank, or a longer period in
"putting a few over on the boss" and "getting by" with a position,
whatever it may be.
