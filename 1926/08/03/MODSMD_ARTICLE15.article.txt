### de Gardner 
De Gardner's personal friend, the
Hon. Rodney Saint Clair, P.D.Q., has
just returned from Camp Lewis; part
of his memoirs will interest our read
ers who are intent on keeping healthy.
The whole family may join in.
"The outfit," drawled Rod, "re
minded me of the year 19 — when I
first became a cadet at Camp ,
that great cantonment named by Wal
ter Camp in honor of his discovery
of the Daily Dozen. As the name im
plies, these gymnastic feats were per
formed daily in eight counts: 'Hands
on hips, place! Exercise! At the count
of one, flex slowly to the right. Two,
lower the left leg. Three, oscillate
slowly on the balls of both feet. Four,
remove hats. Five, push up slowly
from the ground. Six, cover in file.
Seven, extend the fingers horizontally.
Eight, brush off seat of pants, blow
nose, and resume original position'."

Peg—"l was walking down the hall
at Roble on the way to the shower,
and ran into three men carrying a
trunk."
Phil —"Were you embarrassed?"
Peg—"No, I've seen men carrying
trunks before."

He —"I guess you've been out with
worse-looking fellows than I am,
haven't you?"
No answer.
He—"l guess you've been out with
worse-looking fellows than I am,
haven't you?"
She —"I heard you the first time. I
was just trying to think."

The musical saw is assuming a
prominent place among jazz instru
ments. It is especially effective if
drawn from left to right across a
ukelele.

Today's Travelogue—Encina Pool
Not far from the scene of activity
reclines the Encina Pool, sunning
ground for countless brown-skinned
blonds. This collection of sand-piles
and bleachers, closely grouped around
a water hole, is carefully managed by
the local swimming trust. By unerring
logic Encina Pool, and Roble pool
likewise, are closed as if by common
consent on Saturdays and Sundays in
order that Faculty and students having
amphibian tendencies may pass
through the Searsville gate and enjoy
the well-known Searsville water. As
visitors to Encina Pool (ladies in air
planes, gentlemen on foot) you will
no doubt notice the guileless style of
costuming which prevails here. It is
rumored that a member of the fac
ulty while bathing (in the sun) too
close to the edge was unfortunate
enough to fall in. When removed from
the water he was found to be entirely
damp.
