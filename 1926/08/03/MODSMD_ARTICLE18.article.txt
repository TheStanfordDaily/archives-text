"The young people of today are
afraid to be different, they are con
formists fearing to strike out for
themselves," said Rev. W. W. VVillard
of Beloit, Wisconsin, in his sermon in
Memorial Church, Sunday.

Each of us is confronted with three
ways which are stretched out before
us, and the choice of which one to take
rests with us alone, the speaker added.
Some souls take the high way, some
the low, and the rest drift to and fro
in the flats between, not knowing
which way to turn. How many are
today living along this middle path in
a two dementional universe, and doing
nothing to help ourselves?

There is the same difference be
tween the creative and non-creative
ways of living as there is between
life and non-life. "In him was life and
the life was the light of men," are
the words of the Bible. In creating, we
follow Christ and it is only in doing
this that we may ever hope to see the
light he meant us to see.
