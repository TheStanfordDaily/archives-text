An unruly car driven by Felton

wall, and into the bedroom of a house
in San Bruno, last Saturday. Kauf
mann was ordered to appear before
the police judge of San Bruno on Au
gust 17 to answer charges of reckless
driving.
According to witnesses, Kaufmann's
view of the roadway became obscured
when an occupant of the rear seat
leaned forward to secure a light from,
his cigarette. The car hit a lighter
machine and then left the road.
Kaufmann has taken part in several
campus dramatic prdouctions, and in
the summer performance of "Hamlet"
