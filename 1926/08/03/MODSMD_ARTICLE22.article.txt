# EUROPEAN REACTIONS TO U.S. TENDENCIES, HERBERT DISCUSSION
## 
### 
Stressing the point that frank talk
and criticism is the best method of
creating international amity, Sydney
Herbert, lecturer to the Wilson Chair
of Political Science at the University
of Wales, spoke last Thursday before
a luncheon gathering of the Western
School for Commercial Secretaries.
Herbert expressed his own opinions
and those which he believes to be gen
eral views of the United States taken
by Europeans. He said: "A half cen
tury ago the United States was re
garded as a great and shining example
of democratic government. You held
great prestige but you no longer enjoy
that prestige. Now no European coun
try would dream of reproducing the
American form of government," he
added.
In referring to the seeming irrita
bility of present-day Europe, Herbert
said, "We are all getting out of shell
shock resulting from the great war. we
are sick and irritable and do not enjoy
good advice from our candid friend
across the waters.
"Please do not feed the European
animals good advice," he continued.
"Our problem is different from yours.
We do not want to be contented and
happy in the same way you are.
"You have been very lucky," said
Herbert, as he spoke of the great
virgin continent and natural resources
possessed by this country, "and we
wonder if you had been through the
same things we have, whether you
would have succeeded any better."
Herbert mentioned the immigration
restrictions of the United States as
entites which do not foster the good
will of the European countries which
are directly affected by them. Expres
sing England's attitude, he said, "We
don't care if you close your doors, for
we want our people to go to our own
dominions. No one in Europe criticizes
you for your restrictions, but for your
discriminations." Herbert referred to
the admission of thousands of Mexi
cans annually while Europeans are
greatly restricted.
The debt situation is another prob
lem which received attention in Her
bert's speech. He criticized the United
States for expecting payment when
we have created the highest tariff in
the history of the country, thus prac
tically nullifying European attempts
to make repayment through income
derived from commerce. "But," he
said, "when I return to England, I am
going to advise my countrymen to pay
up and shut up."

American interference into Euro
pean affairs is resented, according to
Herbert, who says, "There is a grow
ing sentiment in Europe which would
rather see the United States oirt of the
League of Nations than in it. We have
given official recognition to your Mon
roe Doctrine, why should you not cease
to interfere in European affairs. We
do not want your senators interfering
in European affairs. They have a
knowledge of American institutions,
but they do not know Europe. We do
not trust them."
