### 
What is regarded by the director of |
i the summer quarter as the high spot;
j in the series of musical programs of- [
j fered by the University is the con- j
cert of Victor de Gomez, the eminent !
! 'cellist who will play in the Assembly j
1 Hall on August 10.
! Mr. de Gomez is the principal 'cellist
of the Cleveland Orchestra and direc
j tor of the department of the Violon-
I cello at the Cleveland Institute of
Music. He has achieved the position
as soloist of rank in all parts of the j
j country and has been associated with
I the following prominent musical or
ganizations: The San Francisco Sym-j
i phony and Philharmonic Orchestras, 1
I the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leo- i
pold Stokowski, the Daniel McQuarre j
Trio, and the Andre McQuarre Sextet, j
Says the Musical Review, San Fran- j
| cisco: "We have heard many of the!
world's foremost exponents of this ;
difficult instrument but we have hardly j
j heard any who possess that limpidity j
and flexibility of tone which Victor de
Gomez draws. Then, too, his phrasing
jis exceptionally intelligent and en
dowed with fine taste, lie possesses j
'that rare faculty of imparting his own J
j artistic conceptions of a work to his j
hearers in such a manner that they ;
| easily grasp the beauties of a musical- j
poetic idea. This, supplemented by an >
| accurate intonation, correct rhythm, i
and dainty tone coloring, assembles in |
[ Mr. de Gomez all the elements of a |
i true artist."
Mr. de Gomez will be accompanied !
!
by Arthur Shepherd, assistant conduc- j
I tor of the Cleveland Orchestra and j
I known as a prominent American com-
I poser.
