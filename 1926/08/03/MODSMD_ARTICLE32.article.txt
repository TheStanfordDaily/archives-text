Dr. F. C. Ayer, of the University of
Washington, discussed the position the
school man should take in reference i
to the topic of evolution. He declared

should be no conflict between science \ ;
and religion and said the interpreta- j
tion given the facts by various fac- j'
tions was causing the trouble. Their
differences in interpretation of the 1
facts, he declared, were caused by dif- j'
ferences in point of view.
