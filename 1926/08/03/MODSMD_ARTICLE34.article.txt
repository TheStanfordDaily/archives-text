# 250 STUDENTS LEAVE
## 
### 
About 250 students dropped out of
the summer quarter at the end of the
first half, according to the estimate of
the Registrar's Office. The number
who are continuing work until the end
of the full quarter is about 930. A few
more than that registered for the
whole term, but possibly a dozen of
them have applied for the privilege of
withdrawing at this time.
