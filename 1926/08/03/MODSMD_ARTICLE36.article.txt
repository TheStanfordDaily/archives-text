# CANINE HERO LEFT BARKING REVENGE AT INGRATE KITTEN
## 
### 
A kitten not more than a few weeks
old fell into a mud puddle on Haw
thorne street in Palo Alto, Wednes
day evening. An observing dog of
large proportions and Heinz ancestry,
went to the rescue and pulled the
kitten out with his massive paw. But
the kitten wouldn't even say "thank
you." Instead it jumped to the dog's
back and clunk there like a little mud
ball while the "purp" raced all over
the neighborhood trying to get it off.
Finally the kitten jumped from its
canine mount and scrambled to a
fence, and then wondered why the dog
barked at it as though sorry he had
attempted a rescue.
