# STEVENSON DEFEATS OPPONENTS IN MILE SWIM AT LONG BEACH
## O'Connor Places Second and Williams Fifth; Struggle Against Choppy Sea 
### 
Carl Stevenson, Stanford swimming
star, won the open mile swim held by
the Long Beach Junior Chamber of
Commerce of Long Beach on Sunday
against Wallace O'Connor, Stanford
swimmer and American Olympic repre
sentative, who placed second. This
victory makes Stevenson virtually
Pacific Coast champion, in view of the
fact that he also won the Healdsburg
open mile swim.
Bob Williams, another Stanford
swimmer, placed fifth.
The swimmers at Long Beach had
to struggle against an open choppy
sea for the two laps of 880 yards. Ste
venson's time for the course was 24
minutes 47 seconds. This is only two
minutes slower than the time he made
in the calm waters of the Russian
river for the Healdsburg mile, and is
remarkable in consideration of the ad
verse conditions he encountered.
Stevenson was able to hold the lead
almost from the start, and when
prsesed at any time merely increased
his speed to draw to the front again.
As was expected, the completition was
hard against such powerful swimmers
as Wadley of Venice and Kendall of
Pasadena.
It is surprising that Williams, who
is essentially a sprinter, was able to
gain as high a place as fifth. His stroke
is not the strong pulling kind like that
of his opponents, and is not suited to
a long distance in the open sea, espe
cially in a choppy one. His perform
ances in this meet, at Healdsburg, and
in short-distance swims in the Nation
al meets, rank him with the best all
round swimmers in the country.
