# SEAT SALE STARTS TODAY FOR COMEDY, 'HAY FEVER'
## 
### 
Tickets for Hay Fever, Noel Cow
ard's clever comedy, may be purchased
at 1 o'clock today in the Old Union
and at Crandall's in Palo Alto. Prices
of seats will be seventy-five cents and
one dollar. The curtain will rise
promptly at eight-twenty Saturday
night.
The play is rapidly taking shape
and polish under the direction of Gor
don Davis. Mr. Davis believes this is
one of the most charming comedies
ever presented at Stanford and has
carefully chosen and trained his cast
to bring out all the foibles, frills, and
affectations which make up the spar
kle of the ultra-modern Bliss family.
While the plot is somewhat daring

it is not risque. The situations are
unique and the real interest in the
play lies in the clever repartee, the
best of which develops as the curtain
falls at the end of the acts.
Miss Patrice Nauman, who plays the
part of Judith Bliss, brought to fame
in London by Marie Tempest, may sur
pass any of her previous stage suc
cesses. She portrays the character of
a woman who is inclined to make her
every word and gesture dramatic, but
who occasionally drops down into the
realm of common mortals. These
transitions from the "perpetual act
ress" to the woman, Judith Bliss, are
very difficult and require considerable
understanding of the character as
well as stage training.
The acting of J. S. Doron as David
Bliss should contribute largely to the

success of the pfay. He interprets the
character of the English novelist who
understands women. He presents the
I type of the clever Englishman who
fully appreciates his own cleverness.
Splendid work is being done by
other members of the cast. Every role
| in the play is essential to its success
| and the players are making it scintil
: late in very attractive fashion.
Stanford audiences have grown to
j expect excellent stage setting and
they will not be disappointed with the
scene for "Hay Fever." The hall of
j the Manor House is rather suggestive
| of the action of the play. The set, al
| though particularly modern in design,
I contains a touch of solidity in a large

I old-English window which helps create
the impression that, despite the eccen
tricities of the members of the Bliss
family, they are still completely Eng
l lisli.
A record total for summer quarter
audiences is anticipated this season
i by Gordon Davis. Over 1300 attended
the opening play, "Hamlet," which is
a record attendance for a serious play.
The two comedies, "Hay Fever" and
"Aren't We All," which will complete
the season,, will undoubtedly draw
capacity houses. "Hay Fever" ran for
nearly a year in London and for many
months in New York. Saturday's per
formance will be the first presentation
lof the play in northern California; it
j was given by the Pasadena players
for the first time outside of New York
! City.
