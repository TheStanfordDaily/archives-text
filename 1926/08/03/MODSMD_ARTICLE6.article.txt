# "AMERICAN SENSE OF HUMOR" IS ALMACK'S SUBJECT IN LECTURE
## 
### 
Dr. John C. Almack, Associate Pro
fessor of Education, in his lecture,
"The American Sense of Humor," de
livered last night in the Women's
Clubhouse, stated that as a result of
careful investigation of over eight
thousand jokes printed in our maga
zines and college comics, 50 per cent
were found to be sadly lacking in
humor, but a redeeming feature was
seen in the fact that American quips
are of a kindly nature and are not
altogether devoid of moral purpose.
College Humor Lower
College humor was found to be on
a lower plane than the magazine va
riety. The subjects dealt with consist
ing almost entirely of petting, queen
ing, kissing, women's dress, bootleg
ging and drinking, bad classroom con
duct, and stupidity. As a whole, the
comics were rated 25 per cent lower
than ordinary humor. Moral purpose
was found only where the jokes were
i suggestive of reform in dress, prohibi
tion, and the payment of debts.
Humor generally, when classified as
to subject, presented interesting re
j suits. During the period of 1921-26
Germany was the theme of more
j jokes than any other nation, Russia
| second, with France in third place and
| showing a tendency to advance. Of the
j men joked about Coolidge was the
, most popular which, Dr. Almack re
i marked, "was extraordinary when it
: is considered that the characteristics
i of industry, thrift, and refusal to talk
j are no laughing matters."
Republicans Funniest
Republicans are evidently funnier
than Democrats, Congress and the
League of Nations get their share of
i the laughs, and peace is ten times as
| humorous as war, according to figures
J analyzed. Strangely enough, radio,
bobbed hair, and jazz are not as promi
j nent from the standpoint of wit as
! would be expected from the amount
| of editorial matter on these subjects.
A careful count of the objects of
American jects resolves them down to
1 47 themes. One of the most interest
ing results of the analysis was from
| the presentation to a group of college
professors and students of a list of one
j hundred jokes picked at random, with
| instructions to double check items
which were considered very funny,
! single check moderately humorous se
| lections, and mark those entirely with
j out wit zero. Five per cent received
! the double check, 45 per cent single
j check, and 50 per cent were given
zero. But one joke was found to be
I lacking in humor by all, and this
i proved to have been written by a Stan
lord man.
Judges Grade Selves
Those marking the jokes were
| asked to indicate what they considered
i to be their own capabilities as judges
! of humor, with the marks A, B, C, D,
iand E; A being the highest grade. The
i professors invariably graded tliem
j selves A and the women students
| proved more modest in their self-esti
mates than the men.

A careful count of the objects of
American jects resolves them down to
1 47 themes. One of the most interest
ing results of the analysis was from
| the presentation to a group of college
professors and students of a list of one
j hundred jokes picked at random, with
| instructions to double check items
which were considered very funny,
! single check moderately humorous se
| lections, and mark those entirely with
j out wit zero. Five per cent received
! the double check, 45 per cent single
j check, and 50 per cent were given
zero. But one joke was found to be
I lacking in humor by all, and this
i proved to have been written by a Stan
lord man.
Judges Grade Selves
Those marking the jokes were
| asked to indicate what they considered
i to be their own capabilities as judges
! of humor, with the marks A, B, C, D,
iand E; A being the highest grade. The
i professors invariably graded tliem
j selves A and the women students
| proved more modest in their self-esti
mates than the men.
Dr. John C. Almack, Associate Pro
fessor of Education, in his lecture,
"The American Sense of Humor," de
livered last night in the Women's
Clubhouse, stated that as a result of
careful investigation of over eight
thousand jokes printed in our maga
zines and college comics, 50 per cent
were found to be sadly lacking in
humor, but a redeeming feature was
seen in the fact that American quips
are of a kindly nature and are not
altogether devoid of moral purpose.
College Humor Lower
College humor was found to be on
a lower plane than the magazine va
riety. The subjects dealt with consist
ing almost entirely of petting, queen
ing, kissing, women's dress, bootleg
ging and drinking, bad classroom con
duct, and stupidity. As a whole, the
comics were rated 25 per cent lower
than ordinary humor. Moral purpose
was found only where the jokes were
i suggestive of reform in dress, prohibi
tion, and the payment of debts.
Humor generally, when classified as
to subject, presented interesting re
j suits. During the period of 1921-26
Germany was the theme of more
j jokes than any other nation, Russia
| second, with France in third place and
| showing a tendency to advance. Of the
j men joked about Coolidge was the
, most popular which, Dr. Almack re
i marked, "was extraordinary when it
: is considered that the characteristics
i of industry, thrift, and refusal to talk
j are no laughing matters."
Republicans Funniest
Republicans are evidently funnier
than Democrats, Congress and the
League of Nations get their share of
i the laughs, and peace is ten times as
| humorous as war, according to figures
J analyzed. Strangely enough, radio,
bobbed hair, and jazz are not as promi
j nent from the standpoint of wit as
! would be expected from the amount
| of editorial matter on these subjects.
