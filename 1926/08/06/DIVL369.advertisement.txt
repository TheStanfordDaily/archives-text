New Students — Read This — It's Worth While
It's the Rebate--that Counts
TEN PER CENT REBATE is a good-sized
amount, don't you think? That's what the
Bookstore has averaged for the past few years.
Money in your pocket when you buy from this
co-operative store. Mighty convenient, too.
Come in on your way to the Library.
