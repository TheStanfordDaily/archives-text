# EMINENT 'CELLIST IS TO PRESENT PROGRAM HERE ON AUGUST 10
## Victor de Gomez Praised by Critics as Distinctly American Artist 
### 
Victor de Gomez, American 'cellist,
who will play here August 10, deserves
his title not only because he is Ameri
ran born, but because his art is entire
ly the product of study and association
with the foremost teachers in America.
The eminent musician was born in
Auburn, California, of Spanish-Ameri
can parentage and showed the first
evidence of a violoncellist career at
the age of six years, receiving his first
lessons under the direction of his
father, and later with various teachers
throughout the West. In his early
twenties, having already experienced
great success as a soloist and ensem
ble player on the Pacific Coast, he left
for New York where he continued his
studies with William Willeke.
Mr. de Gomez, who will play at
•Santa Barbara before coming to Stan
ford. is the principal 'cellist of the
Cleveland Orchestra and director of
the department of violoncello at the
Cleveland Institute of Music. He has
achieved the position of a soloist of
rank in all parts of the country and
has been associated in the past with
many of the leading musical organiza
tions of the United States.
Prominent critics in many cities
have united to acclaim him as one of
the greatest American 'cellists. Cyril
Arthur Player, the eminent musical
■critic, says:
"Mr. de Gomez has long ago won his
virtuoso wreaths. He is one of the
few men capable of making that lovely
instrument, the violoncello, seem capa
ble of solo work. I was impressed
here, as at Cincinnati, and as in De
troit on several occasions, with the
added touch of completeness a con
certo acquires when the solo instru
ment is from the orchestra itself. The
Soloist's mastery here of elaborate
figuration was never at the expense
of a warm, vibrant quality and in the
third variation he almost achieved a
pure violin voice with a 'cello under
tone Here, as elsewhere, the
fine solidity of the ensemble provided
majestic moments, such as Tschaikow
sky must have dreamed of when he
wrote the music."
