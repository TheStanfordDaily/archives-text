# The 						Changing Trend of Education
## 
### 
In the early clays, the work of a university was to preserve and hand on
the accumulated knowledge of the ages. Now. a university is looked upon
as an institution whose main purpose is to enlarge the confines of human
knowledge. In the old times, the man who had memorized the works of
the ancient masters was the respected man. Today those are honored
most who, through the experimental method, have brought new truth to
light. This shift in emphasis has changed the conception of a scholar, i
No longer is he that dogmatic individual who proves his assertions by J
amassing the opinions of the authorities. Instead he is thought of as the
energetic searcher into the mysteries of the future.
Of course both types are with us yet among the students as well as
among the professors. The trend is very definite, however, even toward
the experimental discovery of old truth. This method not only builds up
a technique that later may be useful in independent investigation, but it
also gives more vitality to the truth presented and a better mastery to the
student who is learning. The newer methods recognize that to memorize
is not always to apprehend and to rely upon authorities may blind one to
new truth.
