# Thieving

This column has from time to time made mention of certain things
which are hard to understand. And here is another.

Petty thievery exists on this campus. And it is not so petty at that,
for automobile tires, and even engines, we think, may he said to fall into
the category of articles which are more than petty. Who is responsible
for this looting is not known. The blame has occasionally been placed
upon the shoulders of ragamuffins from the surrounding communities,
and it has been proved just in certain instances. But. these young repro
bates cannot be held responsible for stealing in Roble, in the men's dormi
tories, in the locker rooms, and in fraternity houses.
Apparently, despite the barriers which Stanford puts up, some un
desirables step past.
