# The 						"Get-byer"
## 
### 
The paradox of the "get-byer*' offers an interesting contemplation of
some sort of "ism" or subnormal or abnormal psychology. This creature
is one who spends his quarters doing nothing and who is glorified by mem
bers of a group who form a petty "hypocrisy" in any institution of learn
ing. ile does some work, but minimizes it by loud talk about cutting
classes and never looking at books.
Time upon time does one hear the boast of the petty after-ex braggart.
"I cut at least twenty times and never turned a leaf in the text. Didn't
ktiow a thing, but 1 slung a line a mile wide and probably passed the
course."
What is there to be proud of in an accomplishment of that sort? Pres
ence at a university implies a desire to learn. People of the "get-byer"
type are too smart and are wasting their time securing a college education.

THANKS TO THE KIND PERSON responsible for the trimming
of trees and overhanging shrubbery along the sidewalks and road of
Lasuen. There will now be no more hair to comb or car tops to sew tip
from this sort of nuisance.
