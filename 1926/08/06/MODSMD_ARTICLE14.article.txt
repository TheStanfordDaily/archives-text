The Postoffice
The U. S. Government has been
kind enough to construct, alter, and
re-alter a building labeled "Postoffice,"
which serves as a meeting place, dog
park, bank, and laundry depot for the
social, hound-loving, spending, and
cleanly; respectively and reading from
left to right. Here, at almost any time
of the day or night, amateur safe
openers and lock-pickers can be seen
plying their trades, some standing on
their tip-toes opening boxes far above
their heads, others stooping nearly to
the ground in attempts to find the
right combination. Something under
twenty men and boys are employed by
the postmistress to sort the students'
weekly letters. Finding this work in
sufficient to keep it occupied, the force
manages to handle the mail several
times by putting it in the wrong boxes,
occasionally, and occasionally oftener
than occasionally.
