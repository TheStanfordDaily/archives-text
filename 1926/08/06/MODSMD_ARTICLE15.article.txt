# OVERFELT VICTORIOUS IN COUNTY NET PLAY
## 
### 
Harold Overfelt, '25, former Stan
ford tennis captain and star, won the
men's singles championship of Santa
Clara county in the sixteenth annual
county championship matches held
last Tuesday on the courts of the San
Jose Tennis Club at the Hotel Ven
dome. Overfelt was holder of the title
in 1924, but last year was defeated in
the final round.

Lawrence Hall, of the 1929 freshman
tennis team, lost the junior title in the
final round to Wilbur Cox at 6-1, 6-2.
Cox has won three county titles within
a week, and his shots proved too
much for the Stanford player.
