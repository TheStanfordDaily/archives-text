The Editor, Sir:
Finally we receive, at your hands,
information regarding the bridge over
San Francisquito Creek. Your editorial
on that subject in an early summer
edition has raised a feeling of resent
ment in many people that such a con
dition exists. The accident to Mr. Mc-
Allister and Miss Page is only a recent
revival, which impresses upon our
minds the seriousness of this situation
by bringing back recollections of the
numerous disastrous results that have
happened because of the deplorable
condition of that bridge.
In the article quoting Mr. O'Keefe,
the fault is laid to San Mateo County.
This community of Stanford Univer
sity is quite an important taxpayer in
that county. But there are others who
would benefit by the greatly-needed
bridge.
Is it possible that there are some
people who, suffering temporary loss
by the change in route of the road, are
so self-centered and non-public-spirited
as to exert efforts which have tied the
political machine so as to keep it from
repairing this menace to public life
and property? —A Senior.
