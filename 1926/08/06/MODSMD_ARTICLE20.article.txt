# THORNHILL CONCEDES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 1926 FOOTBALL EDGE
## 
### 
The football team that defeats U.S.C.
■will win the 1926 Pacific Coast Con
ference title, according to indications
pointed out by Coach Tiny Thornhill.
Chances of Stanford, California, and
Washington are about equal, for each
roust rebuild the backfield.

Last year most of Stanford's offense
centered around Nevers, and so far
there is no solution to the problem of
filling either his place, or that of the
quarterback, Mitchell. During spring
practice five main fullback possibili
ties were tried out. Of these, Ed
Walker and Seraphim Post looked
best. Bogue, halfback, who played full
back on the freshman team two years
ago, is a good line-plunger, but can not

pass or kick. Hank Millage, also a star
of the '27 freshman team, is excellent
on the defensive, a fair kicker, runs
excellent interference, and is a good
line-bucker. Fleishacker's inexperience
makes him a fullback of questionable
ability, but he is hard-working, and has
a chance.
The four halfbacks, Murphy, Bogue,
Hill, and Hyland, will all be eligible
again. Hill and Hyland are coming up
fast, and Murphy is expected to rival
I)rury of U.S.C. as the best halfback
on the coast this year.
At quarterback, Eli Post, Swan, Mil
lage, Walker, and Lawrence Lewis
have been tried.
The line is practically intact. Three
of the four men who alternated at
tackle during the 1925 season are
eligible. Of these —Harris, Poulson,
and Freeman —Poulson is outstanding.
Ray Tandy, considered the best lines
man on the freshman team, and Cor
win Artman are also out for this posi
tion.

Walker and Shipkey, ends, will have
Harder, best freshman end prospect;
Greiser, sub varsity end last year;
Davidson, and Dennis, as their chief
rivals. To take the place of Armour at
guard, Doyle and Robesky are possi-

bilities.
California lost the famous halfbacks,
Tmlay and Dixon, and the regular quar
terback, Carlson, through graduation.
Dana Cary, guard, will be ineligible
next season.
The loss of the Tesreau-Wilson com
bination to Washington can be esti
mated when it is remembered that in
the Washington-Alabama game at
Pasadena on New Year's Day, Wash
ington scored its three touchdowns
while Wilson was in the game, and
Alabama its three winning touchdowns
during the quarter Wilson was out.

ago, is a good line-plunger, but can not

pass or kick. Hank Millage, also a star
of the '27 freshman team, is excellent
on the defensive, a fair kicker, runs
excellent interference, and is a good
line-bucker. Fleishacker's inexperience
makes him a fullback of questionable
ability, but he is hard-working, and has
a chance.
The four halfbacks, Murphy, Bogue,
Hill, and Hyland, will all be eligible
again. Hill and Hyland are coming up
fast, and Murphy is expected to rival
I)rury of U.S.C. as the best halfback
on the coast this year.
At quarterback, Eli Post, Swan, Mil
lage, Walker, and Lawrence Lewis
have been tried.
The line is practically intact. Three
of the four men who alternated at
tackle during the 1925 season are
eligible. Of these —Harris, Poulson,
and Freeman —Poulson is outstanding.
Ray Tandy, considered the best lines
man on the freshman team, and Cor
win Artman are also out for this posi
tion.

Walker and Shipkey, ends, will have
Harder, best freshman end prospect;
Greiser, sub varsity end last year;
Davidson, and Dennis, as their chief
rivals. To take the place of Armour at
guard, Doyle and Robesky are possi-

bilities.
California lost the famous halfbacks,
Tmlay and Dixon, and the regular quar
terback, Carlson, through graduation.
Dana Cary, guard, will be ineligible
next season.
The loss of the Tesreau-Wilson com
bination to Washington can be esti
mated when it is remembered that in
the Washington-Alabama game at
Pasadena on New Year's Day, Wash
ington scored its three touchdowns
while Wilson was in the game, and
Alabama its three winning touchdowns
during the quarter Wilson was out.

The football team that defeats U.S.C.
■will win the 1926 Pacific Coast Con
ference title, according to indications
pointed out by Coach Tiny Thornhill.
Chances of Stanford, California, and
Washington are about equal, for each
roust rebuild the backfield.

Last year most of Stanford's offense
centered around Nevers, and so far
there is no solution to the problem of
filling either his place, or that of the
quarterback, Mitchell. During spring
practice five main fullback possibili
ties were tried out. Of these, Ed
Walker and Seraphim Post looked
best. Bogue, halfback, who played full
back on the freshman team two years
ago, is a good line-plunger, but can not

pass or kick. Hank Millage, also a star
of the '27 freshman team, is excellent
on the defensive, a fair kicker, runs
excellent interference, and is a good
line-bucker. Fleishacker's inexperience
makes him a fullback of questionable
ability, but he is hard-working, and has
