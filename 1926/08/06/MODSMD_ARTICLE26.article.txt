# BOLTON LECTURES ON CULTURE AND HOMES OF ANCIENT PUEBLOS
## 
### 
"There is no section of the United
States that holds more historic and
romantic interest than the Southwest,"
declared Professor Herbert E. Bolton,
Chairman of the Department of His
tory of the University of California,
before a large audience which gath
ered Tuesday evening in the Little
Theatre to hear his illustrated lecture
on "Pueblos and Cliff Dwellers."
"It is in this country," he said,
"that we find three cultures, the In
dian, the Spanish, and the Anglo-
American, which seem to blend and
yet remain curiously distinct."
Slides used throughout the lecture
were illustrative of the scenic gran
deur of Arizona, New Mexico, and
parts of Utah and Colorado, and of the
pueblos and cliff dwellings found there
wliic hstill stand as they were built,
usually in a cleft on the face of an
almost insurmountable cliff. The peo
ple who inhabited them were probably
the ancestors of the Navajo Indians.

The Pueblo civilization dates back
at least 2000 years. Parts of it were
still flourishing when the Spaniards
first visited the country. The search
for the Seven Cities in the Southwest
was a contributing factor in the ex
plorations of Coronado and his fol
lowers. The pueblos look today as they
looked hundreds of years ago, with
the exception of doors and windows,
which the Spanish culture introduced.
The structures are often seven or
eight stories high.
The Arizonans are doing a credit
able thing in their adaptation of the
pueblo form of architecture, much as
the Californians have adapted the mis
sion type.
In closing, Dr. Bolton warmly en
couraged his hearers to choose the
Southwest as their next vacation
ground.
