### 
Dr. Jordan, in his lecture before the
Education Men's Luncheon Club yes
terday, quoted William James' maxim,
"Know a good man when you see him,"
as the basis of his theory of training
students to form their own opinions.

Speaking of their educational tradi
tions of Stanford, Dr. Jordan said that
the end toward which the University
is working is to make independent
thinkers of those who come to learn.
The object is not to cram one's self full
ot information that may easily be for
gotten, but to acquire knowledge as a
training—to make a background for
future judgments. He affirmed that the
opinion given the student can not be
as valuable to him as the ability given
him to form his own opinion.
Dr. Jordan believes the main factor
is to get down to business-like inten
tions, with as few distractions as pos
sible.

A flood light on the front of the
Memorial Church would add to the
attractivenesß of the campus at night.
