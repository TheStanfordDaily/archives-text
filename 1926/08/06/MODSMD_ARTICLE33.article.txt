# MALONEY PICKS GENE TUNNEY TO WIN FROM DEMPSEY IN TITLE GO
## 
### 
Harry W. Maloney, Stanford's box
ing coach and director of other minor
sports, has expressed the opinion that
Gene Tunney will whip Jack Dempsey
in their proposed title bout for the
heavyweight championship of the
world. Although the principals have
not signed 011 the dotted line, indica
tions point to this long-discussed con
test being held sometime in Septem
ber.
While acting as a director at the
Inter-Allied Games held in Paris in
1918, Maloney was one of the men who
trained Tunney to win the army light
heavyweight championship. He is thus
well qualified to estimate the fighter's
prowess.
Maloney, who was once the cham
pion boxer of the British Army in his
weight, believes Tunney to be superior
to Dempsey botli physically and men
tally, and is of the opinion that his
decisive victories over Carpentier and
Gibbons stamp him as the logical man
to meet and defeat the present title
holder.
. According to Maloney, Gene Tunney
is in the pink of condition, and has
been making special preparations for
Dempsey for many months. A careful
study of Dempsey's form by means of
slow motion pictures has been one of
Tunney's training stunts which should
prove to be of value.
