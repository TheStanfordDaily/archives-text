# COMPTROLLER ROTH RETURNS
## 
### 
Almon E. Roth, University Comp
troller, is spending his vacation with
his family at their summer home in
the Santa Cruz mountains. He has
just completed a log cabin, of un
usual and personal construction, which
he built entirely alone. It is finished
with sugar shakes inside and out.
Mr. Roth will return to Stanford
from time to time to attend to busi
ness which requires his attention.
