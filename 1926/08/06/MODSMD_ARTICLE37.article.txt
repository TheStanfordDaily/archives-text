# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY RECEIVES RARE BOOK
## 
### 
Russian revolutionary opinion of
the middle of the last century found
expression in the foreign publication,
"The Bell," a complete bound volume
of which was received recently by the
Hoover War Library. The periodical
was published irregularly at London
and Geneva by Alexander Herzen, and
was smuggled into Russia despite the
attempts of the authorities to prevent
its entrance and to suppress it after
ward. It found its way mysteriously
to the Czar's desk every time it came
out, but never was it discovered who
put it there.
The bound volume covers the years
1857 to 1867. Only one other copy is
quoted in the booksellers' announce
ment, and that is listed close to $1200.

The Hoover library last week placed
in its exhibit case a new portion of
its nineteenth century French collec
tion, a placard directory of Paris of
about 1850. This announcement gives
the schedules of the royal mails, of
trains, stage-coaches, and steam pack
ets, tells where officials of the city
and the country may be found and
when they may be interviewed, states
the location and hours of museums,
parks, libraries, and other public in
stitutions, advertises theatre produc
tions, and comprises in addition a
tabulation of the money rates of
France and other countries, and of
postal charges.

The placard was printed by the firm
of A. Firmin Didot, and states at the
bottom that all rights are reserved
by the owner, M. Biuet, for whom it
was printed.
