# KERR TO LEAVE SOON; WILL COACH AT W & J

### 
Andy Kerr, former Stanford assist
ant football coach, leaves August 10
for the East where he will take up his
duties as head football coach at Wash
ington and Jefferson University. When
asked what he thought of Stanford's
chances in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence next year, Kerr expressed the
optimistic opinion that prospects were
hardly less favorable than usual.

"The vacancy left by Nevers will be
hard to fill," Kerr said, "and the pres
ent greatest weakness is the lack of a
quarterback, but the proper man will
doubtless be found for this position.
Walker, Millage, Moore, Lewis, Post,
Smalley, and Swan have all been tried,
and found promising. Next fall will
see an average bunch turn out, and
with an average bunch Pop Warner
can always turn out a strong team."
