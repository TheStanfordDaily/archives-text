# GEIGER DESCRIBES YOUTH MOVEMENTS IN GERMANY
## 
### 
"Never in modern life has a genera
tion of people met such unfortunate
conditions as did the young Germans
who came home from the Great War,"
said Doctor Mor-

its Geiger, visit
ing professor
from the Univer
sity of Gdttin
gen,/Germany, in
his opening lec
ture on "Intel
lectual Tenden
cies in Post-War
Germany" last
Wednesday aft
ernoon.
After the war
the best men of
the younger gen
eration gathered
in the so-called
"Youth move
ment," which
had begun in
the 90's of the
last century, in
an effort to re
build themselves
and, in this way.

to rebuild Germany. They were inter
ested not in science and in reason, but
in the finding of an irrat'onalistic
view of life ("Welanschauung"). They
believed that the natural sciences de
stroyed ideals, and looked to art, his- j
tory, and metaphysics as a basis for
their new "Weltanschauung."
These young people looked upon the
older generation as a group of weak

lings who had enjoyed material com
forts while the young men fought the
war. They hated them and believed
that the old generation differed from
the young "as

entirely as cats
and dogs differ
from one an
other," so they
felt that they
must have an
entirely differ
ent culture, and
tried in their
way to rebuild
Germany with
out consulting
the older gener
ation.
The young
Germans did not
want art for
art's sake, and
they felt that art
should express
their "Weltan
schauung." Art
ists tried to sug
gest unreal
things by cub-

ism and various forms of expression
ism. The "Youth Movement" was at
its height in 1921* and 1922 and died
away for various reasons. Chief among
these was that it had no content, that
is, these young Germans were face to
face with the question, "How shaLl we
rebuild Germany?" and they had no
constructive answer Another reaaon
was that these young people were
themselves growing older and becom
ing part "of that awful, and that hated,
older generation," and were finding
that it was not so bad after all.
Where the young men of twenty
had no answer for Germany's prob
lems, the politicians, being men of
great experience, did have an answer,
and so the unity of the young people
was destroyed by the introduction of
differing political tendencies.
Four Political Groups
These tendencies were of four kinds,
those of the Socialists, of the liberal
its and democrats, of the Nationalis
tic party; and finally of the members
of the Fascist movement who looked
forward to new times when the nation
would have one culture and one
thought.
With the passing of the youth move
ment there has come a different type
of young person in Germany. Men
who are twenty-three now were ten
years old at the time of the war. They
know nothing of the struggle for ideals
which motivated the "Youth Move
ment." They saw only the material
sorrows of the war, hunger and the
inflation of currency. They have never
had a good time, and they have no
time to think of ideals. "They have
had only to work, and work, and
work." This young generation is seri
ous and tenacious, with no time for
philosophy or "Weltanschauung,", they
are matter of fact men, and from them
will come no great works of art, no
great scientific discoveries, but they
will do good things in politics. "They
are industrious and serious as no peo
ple have been before," said the emi
nent speaker," and it is this genera
tion that will rebuild Germany.
