# CARICATURE AND COMEDY FEATURE PLAY SATURDAY
## 
### 
j Noel Coward, especially in "Hay
i Fever," seems to have created a new
tone for English dramatic writing. It
j may almost be said that he has caught
i considerable of the American spirit
| typified in such plays as "Love 'Em
j and Leave 'Em" and "The Show-Off."
j Mr. Coward came to New York a few
I years ago and since has produced
I three plays which have been acclaimed
: on Broadway.
"Hay Fever" is a play of English
I mannerisms treated through the me
i dium of caricature rather than by the
older method of satire. The lines are
indicative of "Young England" since
the war. Their disregard for staid
forms and customs are novel and re
freshing.
j An entirely original characteriza
tion of the ingenue, Jackie Coryton,
appears in the acting of Miss Enid
Wall. She interprets her role with a
charming naivete. Instead of the con

ventional flapper manner, she carries
a sort of "poor little rich girl" air
which helps to make her one of the
most likeable characters in the play.
Raymond Haizlip is admirably play
ing the part of Richard Greatham, the
young English diplomat who is more
or less imbued with the sober dignity
of his station. Greatham is not a dis
tinct type; he represents a whole
class of Englishmen, far different from
the Bliss family. Haizlip played in
"Hamlet" last summer with Nance
O'Neal.
Patrice Nauman as Judith, and J. S.
Doron as David Bliss form the plot
center around which all the action
moves.
Two members of the cast who have
never played before, are required to
render piano selections. The two ac
tors are taking special musical in
struction in preparation for their roles.
The seat sales so far are well above
the average for summer productions.
However, good seats may still be had.
