# JORDAN'S LECTURE SHEDS SIDELIGHTS ON TRANSFORMS
## Evolution Factors Include Variation with Heredity And Segregation RELATIONSHIP IS SEEN Manufacture of Protoplasm By Laboratory Method Held Impossible 
### 
Variation and heredity, two internal
phenomena coupled with isolation and
segregation, two external factors, are
responsible for the process of evolu
tion, according to statements made by
Dr. David Starr Jordan in his lecture
last Tuesday afternoon.
The fact that evolution is in the
air is no argument in favor of it, said
Dr. Jordan, for the air is full of such
ideas as "apes slipped back from high
er types," which notion certain funda
mentalists use to explain the similar
ity between man and the apes. Nor
are apes our ancestors, as some un
informed people suppose, but rather,
our "country cousins."

The statement that "Transformism"
is a better word than evolution, which
idea Dr. Jordan has brought forth pre
viously in his books and lectures, was
impressed upon the audience.
That vertebrates all come from a
common stock can be seen from the
similarities of construction. The bones
of the head in all animals, for exam
ple, are modified vertebrae, he ex
plained.

An interesting side-light thrown on
the subject was the remark that the
inside of an animal tells what he is,
while the outside tells where he has
been. Dr. Jordan went on to say that
the stomach is on the outside of the
body, which is a good thing when we
consider some of the things we put
into our stomachs. External similarity,
known as analogy, does not prove re
lationship, as in the case of the toad
stool and the umbrella. It is the con
struction details that count.

All plants and animals are made up
of cells, the important constituent of
