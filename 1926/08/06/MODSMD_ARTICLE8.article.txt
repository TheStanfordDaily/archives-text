# JORDAN'S LECTURE SHEDS SIDELIGHTS ON TRANSFORMS
## Evolution Factors Include Variation with Heredity And Segregation RELATIONSHIP IS SEEN Manufacture of Protoplasm By Laboratory Method Held Impossible 
### 
Variation and heredity, two internal
phenomena coupled with isolation and
segregation, two external factors, are
responsible for the process of evolu
tion, according to statements made by
Dr. David Starr Jordan in his lecture
last Tuesday afternoon.
The fact that evolution is in the
air is no argument in favor of it, said
Dr. Jordan, for the air is full of such
ideas as "apes slipped back from high
er types," which notion certain funda
mentalists use to explain the similar
ity between man and the apes. Nor
are apes our ancestors, as some un
informed people suppose, but rather,
our "country cousins."

The statement that "Transformism"
is a better word than evolution, which
idea Dr. Jordan has brought forth pre
viously in his books and lectures, was
impressed upon the audience.
That vertebrates all come from a
common stock can be seen from the
similarities of construction. The bones
of the head in all animals, for exam
ple, are modified vertebrae, he ex
plained.

An interesting side-light thrown on
the subject was the remark that the
inside of an animal tells what he is,
while the outside tells where he has
been. Dr. Jordan went on to say that
the stomach is on the outside of the
body, which is a good thing when we
consider some of the things we put
into our stomachs. External similarity,
known as analogy, does not prove re
lationship, as in the case of the toad
stool and the umbrella. It is the con
struction details that count.

All plants and animals are made up
of cells, the important constituent of
which is protoplasm, a product of or
ganization. Experiments have been
made to make protoplasm, but without
avail, for although it can Tie duplicated
chemically, the spark of life is lacking.
The fact that all plants and animals
are built in the same way proves that
they have a common origin, the im
mense number of varieties notwith
standing. Over 13,000 kinds of fish
have been identified and more are
being found every year.
That fittest strains survive can be
seen from the truism that no living
thing today ever lost an ancestor in
infancy. War operates against evolu
tion for the best men are sent to be
slaughtered, while the worst are saved
to have offspring.
Dr. Jordan believes that no new
species can be made indoors. Thus
Burbank'a products can not be said to
be new species until they have "run
the gauntlet of life."
Hereditability of acquired charac
teristics has never been proved to Dr.
Jordan's satisfaction.

similarities of construction. The bones
of the head in all animals, for exam
ple, are modified vertebrae, he ex

An interesting side-light thrown on
the subject was the remark that the
inside of an animal tells what he is,
while the outside tells where he has
been. Dr. Jordan went on to say that
the stomach is on the outside of the
body, which is a good thing when we
consider some of the things we put
into our stomachs. External similarity,
known as analogy, does not prove re
lationship, as in the case of the toad
stool and the umbrella. It is the con
struction details that count.

All plants and animals are made up
of cells, the important constituent of
which is protoplasm, a product of or
ganization. Experiments have been
made to make protoplasm, but without
avail, for although it can Tie duplicated
chemically, the spark of life is lacking.
The fact that all plants and animals
are built in the same way proves that
they have a common origin, the im
mense number of varieties notwith
standing. Over 13,000 kinds of fish
have been identified and more are
being found every year.
That fittest strains survive can be
seen from the truism that no living
thing today ever lost an ancestor in
infancy. War operates against evolu
tion for the best men are sent to be
slaughtered, while the worst are saved
to have offspring.
Dr. Jordan believes that no new
species can be made indoors. Thus
Burbank'a products can not be said to
be new species until they have "run
the gauntlet of life."
Hereditability of acquired charac
teristics has never been proved to Dr.
Jordan's satisfaction.
Variation and heredity, two internal
phenomena coupled with isolation and
segregation, two external factors, are
responsible for the process of evolu
tion, according to statements made by
Dr. David Starr Jordan in his lecture
last Tuesday afternoon.
The fact that evolution is in the
air is no argument in favor of it, said
Dr. Jordan, for the air is full of such
ideas as "apes slipped back from high
er types," which notion certain funda
mentalists use to explain the similar
ity between man and the apes. Nor
are apes our ancestors, as some un
informed people suppose, but rather,
our "country cousins."

The statement that "Transformism"
is a better word than evolution, which
idea Dr. Jordan has brought forth pre
viously in his books and lectures, was
impressed upon the audience.
That vertebrates all come from a
common stock can be seen from the
similarities of construction. The bones
