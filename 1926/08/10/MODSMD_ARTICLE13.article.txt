# The 						Rights of Roughs
## 
### 
Despite rumors that the sole remaining Stanford tradition is the
tradition tradition, the word "rough is still occasionally drawn from the
reservoirs of campus philology and furbished up for the occasion of a
"jolly up." There has tieen handed down no ukase exterminating the
"rough" from the campus; so let him live.
Now, as always, the Stanford "rough" is essentially and thoroughly
a gentleman, and as such, is deserving of the elementary considerations
of social intercourse. If he is not a gentleman he is not a rough, but a
roughneckâ€”so call the police.
But the rough, though he should with meticulous care avoid trampling
upon the number twelves of those engaging in terpsichorean revels, those
cash customers of the festivities should, with equal care, avoid treading
upon the toes of the gentlemen looking in from the outside. Roughs
should not occupy all the available seats so artistically arranged about the
sides of the floor, nor should they make caustic comments, no matter
how deserved, concerning the performers.
Nevertheless, the rough has the inalienable privilege, right, and fran
chice to "bum" dances from anyone who needs relief or who cares to
surrender his partner. He has as well, the privilege to stand inside doors
as long as he does not impede the progress of the weltering mass of
humanity which makes ingress and egress from the scene of the revels.
Under no circumstances should an officious bouncer attempt to conspicu
ously collar a successful rough in the act of dancing.
