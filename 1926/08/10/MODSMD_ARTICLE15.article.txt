The Stanford campus has for many years presented the same problems
to the newcomer that an uncharted sea does to a mariner. 1 f street signs
ever did exist in this locality they have long since passed over the Great
Divide. Unfortunately, no mention is made in the I 'mvcrsity Bulletin,
sent to future campus residents, of the need for maps a»d compasses, and
thus many come unprepared. A new arrival, unless he is willing to impose
continually on the good nature of residents of longer standing, must secure
a map and surveying instruments in order to locate Salvatierra, Alvarado,
Dolores, or Santa Ynez. Few who have lived here for several years recog
nize Portola, Palo Alto Avenue, Lomita, Cabrillo, or Mirada, when they
are walking these streets day hy day. From outward appearances no one
would ever guess that these streets ever had names. Perhaps some day an
altruistic individual will contribute some white paint and his services to
the cause of convenience and general enlightenment.
