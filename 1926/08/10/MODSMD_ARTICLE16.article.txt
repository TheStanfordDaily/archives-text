# SUMMER SQUASHES
## TODAY'S TRAVELOGUE The 						Assembly Hall 
### de Gardner 
The Assembly Hall is so called be
cause it is used for everything but
assemblies. At one time in the Uni
versity's history the student body did
meet here. Whenever these meetings
occurred women students were re
quested to sit in the gallery. For this
reason the gallery was built in the
form of a horseshoe, to typify the good
luck of the ladies in not having to be
any nearer to the men during the
singing of songs. Under ordinary cir
cumstances the hall is used for the
purpose of teaching young actors new
words which should prove of great aid
in changing tires. After a few weeks
of this sort of training a group of
citizens of Palo Alto and neighboring
towns are induced into buying tickets
which entitle them to the pleasure of
spending an evening in tlie Assembly
Hall, while something or other is per
formed on the stage.

Dear Sirs:
It appears that Comptroller Roth, to
whom I addressed an urgent communi
cation in re the waste of water from
the Union Fountain, after avoiding me
in divers and sundry manners, finally
fled to the confinement of the country.
Nevertheless, ever being mindful of
| the public weal, I laid the problem
before some of the engineering
geniuses and mechanical prodigies of
this world-famed country.
Professor H. J. Ryan (of the famous
Ryan Laboratory) turned his mind for
a few moments to this abstruse prob
lem. Never had he been confronted
with a more absorbing enigma. Al
though he was not then able to point
to a way of preventing the waste of
water, yet he stated that during the
coming months, when he will be ex
perimenting in his laboratory, there
will be juice excessive for his needs.
Some of this liquid, I presume, could
undoubtedly be turned into the Foun
tain. I was not able fully to compre
hend all his Americanisms, but I sin
cerely believe that he has formed the
embryo of a valuable solution.
Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Kiler, noted
scene designers, having studied the
situation from all angles, arrived at
a pricelessly practical answer. They
are willing to plan a stage setting
with full lighting effects for the Union
Court. This will, don't you see, dis
pense with water altogether, and yet
ensure the pleasant sight of an ap
parently gushing fountain.
Fire Captain Dugan will be only too
willing to let his best machine serve
its part in beautifying the University.
(He remarked that he is anxious at
some time actually to pump water
through this machine.) When it is not
in its more definite use it could pump
water through the fountain to the re
quired height; the water would then
fall back into the fount basin from
which it could be drained into a reser
voir serving as the supply for the
machine. Thus, you observe, a never
ending circle, and no waste whatso
ever.
At present I am impatient for re
plies from Ford, Edison, the Westing
house, and the General Electric. I hope
also to receive suggestions from many
students here who have an inventive
turn of mind.
Believing, dear sirs, these extraor
dinary ideas should receive your due
consideration, I remain,
Helpfully yours,
De Gardner.

Dear Sirs:
It appears that Comptroller Roth, to
whom I addressed an urgent communi
cation in re the waste of water from
the Union Fountain, after avoiding me
in divers and sundry manners, finally
fled to the confinement of the country.
Nevertheless, ever being mindful of
| the public weal, I laid the problem
before some of the engineering
geniuses and mechanical prodigies of
this world-famed country.
Professor H. J. Ryan (of the famous
Ryan Laboratory) turned his mind for
a few moments to this abstruse prob
lem. Never had he been confronted
with a more absorbing enigma. Al
though he was not then able to point
to a way of preventing the waste of
water, yet he stated that during the
coming months, when he will be ex
perimenting in his laboratory, there
will be juice excessive for his needs.
Some of this liquid, I presume, could
undoubtedly be turned into the Foun
tain. I was not able fully to compre
hend all his Americanisms, but I sin
cerely believe that he has formed the
embryo of a valuable solution.
Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Kiler, noted
scene designers, having studied the
situation from all angles, arrived at
a pricelessly practical answer. They
are willing to plan a stage setting
with full lighting effects for the Union
Court. This will, don't you see, dis
pense with water altogether, and yet
ensure the pleasant sight of an ap
parently gushing fountain.
Fire Captain Dugan will be only too
willing to let his best machine serve
its part in beautifying the University.
(He remarked that he is anxious at
some time actually to pump water
through this machine.) When it is not
in its more definite use it could pump
water through the fountain to the re
quired height; the water would then
fall back into the fount basin from
which it could be drained into a reser
voir serving as the supply for the
machine. Thus, you observe, a never
ending circle, and no waste whatso
ever.
At present I am impatient for re
plies from Ford, Edison, the Westing
house, and the General Electric. I hope
also to receive suggestions from many
students here who have an inventive
turn of mind.
Believing, dear sirs, these extraor
dinary ideas should receive your due
consideration, I remain,
Helpfully yours,
De Gardner.

reason the gallery was built in the
form of a horseshoe, to typify the good
luck of the ladies in not having to be
