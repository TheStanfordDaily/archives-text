Monkeys may be just as interesting
as subjects in the study of psycho
logical behavior as are human beings.
This will be the conclusion of one
who visits the inmates of a new mon
key cage between Sequoia Hall and
the Botanical Gardens, erected under
the supervision of Professor Calvin P.
Stone, Associated in Psychology, who
is observing the good-natured anthro
poids to determine sexual reactions
and other characteristics. The popula
tion of the cage is one male and four
females.
Within the same building that con
tains the monkeys is a cage which
houses a considerable number of rab
bits. These animals are under the ob
servation and supervision of Mr. Hao
Kao, a graduate student in Psychology.
