# PARKING PROBLEM IS BIG PALO ALTO ISSUE
## 
### 
Palo Alto merchants, unsatisfied
■with the present system of parallel
parking employed in their city, have
framed an ordinance, and are circu
lating a petition for its passage, which
would involve the adoption of diagonal
parking- on University Avenue from
the Circle to Cowper street.
Desire to make the change is ex
plained by the argument that a com
paratively small number of cars can
be parked in front of places of busi
ness under the present system. A
further contention is that many driv
ers find difficulty in bringing their
cars to the curb where parallel park
ing is the rule.
Opponents of the change claim that
University Avenue is too narrow to
have diagonal parking and still ac
commodate general traffic which, it is
maintained, is the principal purpose
of a street.
