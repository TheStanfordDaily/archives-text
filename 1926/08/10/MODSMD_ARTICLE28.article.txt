# COMING GRID SEASON NO CAUSE FOR OVERCONFIDENCEâ€”SWAN
## 
### 
"We must look out for overconfi
denee. The days are past when one
football team Is head and shoulders
above any other on the coast." This
is Captain Fred Swan's warning to
football fans.
The Stanford grid team was the big
gest surprise of the 1925 season but it
was not a "wonder team" because such
a phenomenon is possible only when
a university has a football squad far
superior to any of its competitors.
Stanford will hardly attain this height
this year because all the Pacific Coast
Conference teams are almost evenly
matched.
The Cardinals are conceded pros
pects fully as bright as any team on

the Coast for the coming season. But
they will have to fight just as hard as
they did"last year.
No definite "dope" is yet available
on the teams that will play this fall,
but theories and rumors are beginning
10 buzz. The Oregon Aggies are ex
pected to contend powerfully for con
ference honors; Washington, although
not as strong as last year, will be
well up in the running; California,
under the leadership of Bert Griffin,
will try to stage a comeback, and
U.S.C.'s "Thundering Herd" is ex
pected to offer all the competition
any of its rivals need.
