# Phil Brooks Injures Hand As Motorcycle Turns Over
## 
### 
Phil Brooks, '27, returning to the
campus about 11:30 Thursday morn
ing, narrowly escaped serious injury
as the front tire on his motorcycle
blew out and, coming off the wheel,
locked in the spokes, throwing the
machine on its side. Brooks was
dragged for a distance of sixty feet
before the motor finally stopped at
the side of the road.
His left leg was badly bruised and
the palm of his left hand severly cut
and lacerated. As soon as possible, he
secured relief at a nearby farmhouse
where first aid was given to his hand
until he could get to a doctor. One of
his fraternity brothers, who was called
to the scene of the accident, took him
to the hospital in Palo Alto for treat
ment.
