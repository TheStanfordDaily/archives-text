# Books Discussed at Last Meeting of English Club
## 
### 
The monthly meeting of the English
Review Club was held last evening at
the residence of Professor A. G. Ken
nedy. 435 Coleridge Avenue, Palo Alto.
The discussion was conducted, ac
cording to custom, by the graduate
students who were present, almost all
of whom had prepared questions and
answers on the most recent literary
productions. This lack of definite pro
gram allows the greatest freedom in
%
the consideration of the works of note
worthy contemporary writers.
Aside from the slight possibility of
there being a special meeting within
a week or two, there will be no more
gatherings of the club during the sum
mer quarter.
