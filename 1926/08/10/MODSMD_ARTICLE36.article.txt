# BOXING CHAMPION TO QUIT RING FOR BOOKS
## 
### 
Fidel Laßarba, flyweight boxing
champion of the world, plans to for
sake the squared circle for the Stan
ford classroom, and will hit the books
instead of the solar plexus beginning
with the fall quarter 1927, according
to Associated Press reports.
The champion, who is the only pres
ent wearer of a boxing crown to work
up from amateur ranks, says that he
first turned professional in order to
earn money for his college education.
According to reports, Laßarba desires
to be a boxing instructor, and to enter
the business school where he will
study for the bond business. In an
other year he believes he will be able
to quit the ring and carry out his
plans. He is not yet 21.
Laßarba has chosen Stanford be
cause he is an ardent football fan, and
likes the Cardinal's prospects. The
king of the flyweights is now training
for his fight with Emil Paluso of Salt
Lake City to be held in Chicago on
August 13. This is to be a series of
appearances east of the Rockies. His
next contest will probably be with
"Newsboy" Brown.
