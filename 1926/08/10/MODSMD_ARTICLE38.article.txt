# MELBOURNE ZOOLOGY PROFESSOR CAMPUS GUEST YESTERDAY
## 
### 
Doctor W. E. Agar, Professor of
Zoology at the University of Mel
bourne. Australia, spent yesterday vis
iting the Stanford Zoology department.
Dr. Frank Mace McFarland, professor
of histology, acted as his host. Profes
sor Agar is on his way from England
to Australia and has been in the
United Statos for five weeks. He spent
part of last week at the Hopkins
Marine Station in Pacific Grove in
specting the work that is being done
there. Thursday night he talked there
at an informal gathering on the sub
ject of pests, which were originally
introduced into Australia for construc
tive purposes, and, in time, over-ran
the country and became seemingly in
eradicable.
The Australian professor mentioned
especially rabbits, foxes, dingo dogs,
and prickly-pear cactus, saying that
separate commissions have been ap
pointed to deal with each of these
pests. Members of the commissions
have gone to the uttermost ends of
the earth seeking parasites which will
combat the evils, but so far have
found nothing effective.
Professor Agar is recognized as an
authority on cell-structure, and has
published, besides numerous papers, a
book, "Cytology."
