Four of the bachelor members of
the Stanford Faculty are building a
new residence next to Serra House,
Dr.Jordan's home. The house will be
ready for occupancy in September and
will be the home of John A. Sellards,
Director of the Summer Quarter and
Endowment Secretary; Alonzo E. Tay
lor, Director and Executive Secretary,
Food Research Institute; Frank A.
Colder, Professor of History; and
Ralph Lutz, Director of the Hoover
War Library. Mr. Lutz is now in Eu
rope. The place will probably be called
the "Casa de los Cuatro," although the
name has not been Anally decided
upon.
The designers of the building are
Bakewell and Brown, architects, who
have done a number of buildings in
cluding the Library and Toyon Hall.
It is a four-apartment house and will,
when finished, have complete living
arrangements for each apartment.
There are two upper and two lower
suites, each containing six rooms and
two baths.
Adjoining the place will be a two
story structure with garage space for
eight cars, and on the second floor,
living quarters for servants.
If the Delaware Foreign Study plan,
now being considered by University of
California authorities, is adopted, stu
dents of special ability will be given
credit for study at the Sorbonne,
Paris.
