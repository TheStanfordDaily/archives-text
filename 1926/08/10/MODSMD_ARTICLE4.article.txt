# LONSDALE COMEDY "AREN'T WE ALL" NEXT PRODUCTION
## Seat Sale Commences Today In the Old Union and At Crandall's Gordon Davis to Play Lead Supported by a Cast With Experience 
### 
The delightful comedy, "Aren't We
All," will be presented in the Assem
bly Hall, Friday night. The play was
written by Frederick Lonsdale, master
ot' intriguing situations and sparkling
dialogue, who created the charming
stage success, "Spring Cleaning."
The seat sale for "Aren't We AH"
will begin at one o'clock today at the
Old Union and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto. Prices will be seventy-five cents
and one dollar.
The play is one of the best Mr.
Lonsdale has produced. It enjoyed a
long run in London, and played to
capacity houses in New York with
Cyril Maude as the character lead.
Behind the rollicking laughter in the
lines there is a deeper plot in the play
which brings out the much-discussed
double standard of conduct for men
and women.
Plot of the Play
The Honorable Willie Tatham re
turns to England to find his wife in
another's arms. The drama develops
around this situation. A worldly-wise
widower. Lord Grenham, takes upon
himself the difficult task of smoothing
out all troubles and misunderstand
ings. His watchword is to "lie like a
gentleman," but the truth finally
comes out and solves the situation.
Lord Grenham, meanwhile, is pursued
by the majestic, "stylish-sout," Lady
Kitty Lake. He finally enmeshes him
self inextricably in her toils and mar
ries her.
The play presents a charming vein
of English life, somewhat more lei
surely than the ultra-modernism por
trayed by the family Bliss in "Hay
Fever."
Davis to Play Lead
Gordon Davis plays the part of Lord
Grenham, enacted in New York by
Cyril Maude. Mr. Davis has an en
viable place in American dramatics,
both for his acting and his stage direc
tion. As Lord Grenham, he portrays
the wily, sophisticated widower, who
thoroughly enjoys his freedom but is
unable to avoid the snares of the "de
signing woman," Kitty Lake.
The juvenile lead, Hon. Willie Tat
ham, is played by Wayne Newcomb,
who will be remembered for his excel
lent acting in "Hell Bent fer Heaven,"
and "Meet the Wife."
Adelaide Kelly, who has been promi
nent in campus dramatics for some
time, plays the role of Lady Kitty
Lake.
Lady Frinton is enacted by Eliza
beth Wilbur, star in "Agamemnon."
The character of the Rev. Ernest
Lvnton is portrayed by Reidar Torjus
sen, of "In the Next Room" fame.
All the members of the cast are very
well chosen and are excellently de
