# OFFICE INVESTIGATES EFFECTS OF OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES ON STUDIES
## 
### 
Stanford's Personnel Research Office
is attempting to ascertain definitely
the effects of money, cars, and extra
curricular activities on scholarship. To
Insure the success of the project, it
will be necessary to gain the co-opera
tion of several hundred students,
whose work varies from the best to
the poorest.
Questionnaires have been sent to
freshman and sophomore men, and are
to be answered on the basis of spring
quarter conditions. Two groups are
represented: those who did less than
C work, and those who made better
than B. The purpose of the experiment
is to find significant differences be
tween the two.
Queries inquire closely into living
and financial conditions. Study habits
of the individual, and even the habits
of his roommates are considered. Re
garding recreation and social activity,
some of the questions are: "Did you
own a car? If not, did you have ready
access to one? Where did you spend
most of your recreation time? What
recreation do you find most enjoy
able?" It is asked how much time was
required each week for extra curricu
lar activities, and whether or not. a
definite study schedule was followed.
The final question is, "What do you
consider to be the principal causes of
unsatisfactory work among students?"
All information is to be held in strict
confidence, and is not for the use of
any scholarship, disciplinary, or other
committee. It will not appear on stu
dents' record cards.
