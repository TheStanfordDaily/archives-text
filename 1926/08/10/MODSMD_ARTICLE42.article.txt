# Stanford Men and Women In Various Summer Jobs
## 
### 
Proof that Stanford men and women
are capable and willing to do every
type of which may present itself,
is found in the summer employment
data of the University Appointment
Office.
Students will be found in all parts
of the West, surveying, doing life
guard duty, "hashing," selling every
thing from tooth-brushes to real es
tate, driving sight-seeing busses in the
national parks, clerking in all kinds
of stores, and playing in orchestras.
Others are serving as traveling com
panions, tutors, stenographers, golf
teachers, gardeners, gas station men,
librarians, camp advisors, nursemaids,
governesses, and draftsmen.
