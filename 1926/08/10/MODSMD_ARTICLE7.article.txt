# EXCELLENT RENDITION OF COWARD'S COMEDY ENTERTAINS AUDIENCE
## COMEDY IS ROLLICKING Characters Particularly Well Cast in Second Play Of Summer 
### 
Saturday evening was presented the
cleverest comedy that has been offered
at Stanford in many a day. Noel Cow
ard, the author of this subtle and scin
tillating bit, "Hay Fever," is deserving
of the most favorable adjectives which
may be drawn from the resources of
critical jargon. But it was not Noel
Coward alone who made last Friday's
production the evening of merriment
and entertainment that it proved to
be. The acting of the principals was of
such quality that it is difficult to place
the laurel upon the brow of any par
ticular individual. Miss Patrice Nau
man, Miss Enid Wall, and J. S. Doron
divide the honors for especially bril
liant interpretations.
Three Members Star
Miss Nauman, an actress of previous
fame here, continued the splendid
work which made her popular in
"Fashion," "Meet the Wife," and other
campus productions. She enacted the
role of Madame Bliss with rare inter
pretative genius, for that part was
most difficult of portrayal. Mr. Doron
played the part of Mr. Bliss in the
manner that one would have it pre
sented. Besides clever interpretation,
Mr. Doran succeeded in making him
self convincingly a man of fifty or
thereabouts. So often the inevitable
juvenile comes to the surface when
the part of an older man is attempted
by college students; consequently Mr.
Doron's work was refreshing in its
reality.
Miss Wall, playing her first part on
the Stanford stage, enacted Jackie
Coryton with delightfully ludicrous
naivete. She has the knack of pre
senting the character of the too-bash
ful young lady, without overdoing.
Second Act Best
The second act, the test of all con
temporary plays, though it might eas
ily have been dropped without destroy
ing the continuity, was contrary to the
usual run of comedies in that it was
the high spot of the comedic element
in "Hay Fever." Although scarcely a
highly artistic device, the insertion of
the ridiculously melodramatic scene
from "Love's Whirlwing," Mrs. Bliss'
former success, gave the audience its
largest chuckle, and made the second
act the most laughable of the play.
A distinctive feature of this produc
tion was the general excellence of act
ing of all the cast. Miss Norma Seib,
playing the role of Sorel Bliss, did
very good work, especially in the
farcical scenes interpolated from Mrs.
Bliss' previous dramatic repertoire.
Byron Harvey, although he lacked
what may be called a "stage voice,"
pantomined his part with facility. Lucy
Bentley did a splendid bit of charac
terization in portraying Myra Arundel,
the sophisticated lady with the varn
pireish proclivities.
Ray Haizlip played a fine Richard
Greatham and Alberta Yearian played
Clara in a humorous fashion, FYederick
Zitkowski, despite the fact that he
was slightly miscast, carried the part
of Sandy Tyrell with finesse.
The technical staff of this produc
tion deserves much credit for the suc
cess of the play. Leslie Kiler designed
an effective drawing-room set which
served as a harmonious background
for the scintillations of the play. The
assistant technical direction was in
the hands of Miss Lucie Bentley, and
lighting was directed by Harold Todd.
"Stop slandering our young people,"
says a London professor. Well, you
make them stop slandering us.
