# SIX-YEAR COURSE IN AERONAUTIC ENGINEERING MADE POSSIBLE BY DANIEL GUGGENHEIM FUND
## 
### 
Stanford University, with the aid of
the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the
Promotion of Aeronautics, will expand
its present work in aeronautics into a
complete and well-rounded six-year
course for the training of young men
in aerodynamics and aeronautic en
gineering. An immediate grant of
$45,000 by the Guggenheim Fund, to
gether with an assurance of financial
support over a period of ten years
representing the interest on a capital
sum of $300,000 will enable the Uni
versity to reorganize this work at
once, as a division of the School of
Engineering.
The first four years of the course
will be occupied largely with broad
engineering and general training, ,
while the last two will be devoted
wholly to intensive work in the field
of aerodynamics and aeronautic engi
neering.
The present aerodynamics labora
tory, in which experiments have been
conducted for ten years, especially in
testing propeller models, will be de
veloped and improved through the ad
dition of equipment for tests of other
parts of planes, and will be housed in
a permanent and commodious brick
and concrete structure, to take the
place of the present temporary wooden
building.
Three Divisions of Work
The work at Stanford will be organ
ized along three general lines, cover
ing the whole field, and each headed
by an expert—(l) aerodynamics, (2)
structural design and construction,
and (3) laboratory research. The men
in charge of the first two divisions are
yet to be appointed. The laboratory
will be directed by Professor E. P.
Lesley, who has for a decade been
associated with Dr. W. F. Durand in
the work of the present laboratory,
spending a year of that time in the
Aerodynamic Laboratory of the Na
tional Advisory Committee for Avia
tion at Langley Field, Va. Dr. Durand
is a member of this committee.
Guggenheim Experimental Laboratory
Aeronautic engineering, especially

iin its research and experimental as
jpects, is no new subject at Stanford.
' In 1916 the first wind tunnel was built,
i to be followed two years later by a
! larger and more effective installation,
! and during the ten years of this
period, experimental researches, espe
cially related to the air propeller and
its reaction with the airplane struc
ture, have been continuously and ac
tively carried on by Dr. Durand and
Professor Lesley in collaboration.
In honor of the donor whose gift
| has made possible the organization of
j this course in practical and theoretical
! aeronautics, the Stanford authorities
; plan to name the laboratory The Dan
i iel Guggenheim Experimental Labora
| tory of Aeronautics and Aeronautic
Engineering.
Space for Flying Field
The Stanford campus is peculiarly
suited for the establishment of a
school of aeronautics through the
large amount of available land for a
| fiying field for experimental use with
full-sized planes, and an adequate plot
| of ground has been held in reserve for
: this purpose. Furthermore, the loca
tion of the campus within a short dis
tanfce of San Francisco Bay will make
