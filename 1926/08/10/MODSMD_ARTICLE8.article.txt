# SIX-YEAR COURSE IN AERONAUTIC ENGINEERING MADE POSSIBLE BY DANIEL GUGGENHEIM FUND
## 
### 
Stanford University, with the aid of
the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the
Promotion of Aeronautics, will expand
its present work in aeronautics into a
complete and well-rounded six-year
course for the training of young men
in aerodynamics and aeronautic en
gineering. An immediate grant of
$45,000 by the Guggenheim Fund, to
gether with an assurance of financial
support over a period of ten years
representing the interest on a capital
sum of $300,000 will enable the Uni
versity to reorganize this work at
once, as a division of the School of
Engineering.
The first four years of the course
will be occupied largely with broad
engineering and general training, ,
while the last two will be devoted
wholly to intensive work in the field
of aerodynamics and aeronautic engi
neering.
The present aerodynamics labora
tory, in which experiments have been
conducted for ten years, especially in
testing propeller models, will be de
veloped and improved through the ad
dition of equipment for tests of other
parts of planes, and will be housed in
a permanent and commodious brick
and concrete structure, to take the
place of the present temporary wooden
building.
Three Divisions of Work
The work at Stanford will be organ
ized along three general lines, cover
ing the whole field, and each headed
by an expert—(l) aerodynamics, (2)
structural design and construction,
and (3) laboratory research. The men
in charge of the first two divisions are
yet to be appointed. The laboratory
will be directed by Professor E. P.
Lesley, who has for a decade been
associated with Dr. W. F. Durand in
the work of the present laboratory,
spending a year of that time in the
Aerodynamic Laboratory of the Na
tional Advisory Committee for Avia
tion at Langley Field, Va. Dr. Durand
is a member of this committee.
Guggenheim Experimental Laboratory
Aeronautic engineering, especially

iin its research and experimental as
jpects, is no new subject at Stanford.
' In 1916 the first wind tunnel was built,
i to be followed two years later by a
! larger and more effective installation,
! and during the ten years of this
period, experimental researches, espe
cially related to the air propeller and
its reaction with the airplane struc
ture, have been continuously and ac
tively carried on by Dr. Durand and
Professor Lesley in collaboration.
In honor of the donor whose gift
| has made possible the organization of
j this course in practical and theoretical
! aeronautics, the Stanford authorities
; plan to name the laboratory The Dan
i iel Guggenheim Experimental Labora
| tory of Aeronautics and Aeronautic
Engineering.
Space for Flying Field
The Stanford campus is peculiarly
suited for the establishment of a
school of aeronautics through the
large amount of available land for a
| fiying field for experimental use with
full-sized planes, and an adequate plot
| of ground has been held in reserve for
: this purpose. Furthermore, the loca
tion of the campus within a short dis
tanfce of San Francisco Bay will make
possible the development of a hydro
plane station and landing plane when
ever conditions make that desirable.
These developments will place at
Stanford facilities for research and
practical demonstration in all types of
forms of flying craft, both land and
marine, and in both model and full
scale size.
Appropriate for Stanford
In speakiug of this donation and
the possibilities which it will afford
at Stanford University, Dr. W. F.
I Durand says: "No purpose, as we well
i know lay nearer to the hearts of the
J founders of Stanford University than
j that of furnishing means for the train
ing of the youth of our country for
'lives of useful service; and from con
versation with the generous donor of
j the Guggenheim Fund for the Promo
i tion of Aeronautics, I fell justified in
! saying that no purpose perhaps now
: lies nearer the heart of Mr. Daniel
Guggenheim than that of the training
of young men for lives of useful ser
vice in fields related to the design,
I construction, and use of aircraft.
"It therefore seems peculiarly appro*
i priate that these opportunities for spe-
I cial training in aeronautic engineer
ing should thus have been made pos
sible here at Stanford through the
splendid gifts of Mr. Guggenheim,
placed where students may have the
advantage of the broad technical and
general training made possible by the
earlier gifts of Governor and Mrs.
Stanford. Thus are the generous pur
| poses and the high ideals of both the
| Stanfords and of Mr. Guggenheim the
I more fully and more perfectly rea
lized."
Research Work to Be Done
Aerodynamics furnishes the means
for determining the air conditions
which the structures must fulfil in
order to realize desired ends. Struc
tural design and construction deals
with the realization of these condi
tions in actual structural materials. In
both of these lines of work, problems
requiring laboratory research are con
tinually arising and a well-equipped
laboratory is a vital necessity not only
as a basis for instruction but as a
means for continued progress in both
the science and the art of airplane de
sign and construction.
It is expected that special attention
will be given to research and the ex
perimental study of problems con
nected with aeronautic engineering,
and for these lines of work the labora
tory with its enlarged facilities will be
peculiarly well adapted. Building upon
its past work of fourteen important
investigations, the reports of which
have been published by the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
a further series of investigations is
now contemplated dealing among
other subjects with a further study of
the reaction between the airplane
structure and the propeller, its char
acter and amount, and the most ef
fective dispositions for rendering such
interference a minimum.
Present Problems in Flying
It is expected that funds will be
found for a limited number of research
fellowships, thus furnishing financial
aid to specially qualified students
while continuing their studies along
research and advanced lines.
At the present time the major prob
lems in aeronautic engineering are
those which center around elements
which determine the safety, reliability,
and economic efficiency of aircraft in
operation. In particular, there is need
for the development of characteristics
which will permit of rising from and
landing in relatively restricted areas
and also give elements of stability
and inherent control in the air in the
absence of the usual control by the
pilot. All of this means the study of
new aerodynamic characteristics for
the elements of aircraft and their com
bination in such manner as to pro
duce the ends desired. And this means
the study by models in wind tunnel
and study of full-scale construction in
the air.
Year-Round Work
For the intensive study of develop
ments along these various lines, the
equable climatic conditions of Cali
fornia, permitting as they do work in
the air the year around, render this
state peculiarly well-suited, and these

new opportunities for scientific study i
and technical training combined with
the splendid start which the industry
has made, promise to make of the )
Pacific Coast a leading section in the
new developments in air transport
which seem to be so full of promise
for a near future.
It will be recalled that Mr. Guggen
heim something more than a year ago
gave a large endowment to New York
University to found there a school of
aeronautic engineering, and now this
gift is followed on the Pacific Coast 1
by an award of funds to two California 1
institutions, Stanford University and
the California Institute of Technology, |
at both of which new developments in
courses of instruction and in facilities
for research are thus assured.

Guggenheim Experimental Laboratory
Aeronautic engineering, especially

iin its research and experimental as
jpects, is no new subject at Stanford.
' In 1916 the first wind tunnel was built,
i to be followed two years later by a
! larger and more effective installation,
! and during the ten years of this
period, experimental researches, espe
cially related to the air propeller and
its reaction with the airplane struc
ture, have been continuously and ac
tively carried on by Dr. Durand and
Professor Lesley in collaboration.
In honor of the donor whose gift
| has made possible the organization of
j this course in practical and theoretical
! aeronautics, the Stanford authorities
; plan to name the laboratory The Dan
i iel Guggenheim Experimental Labora
| tory of Aeronautics and Aeronautic
Engineering.
Space for Flying Field
The Stanford campus is peculiarly
suited for the establishment of a
school of aeronautics through the
large amount of available land for a
| fiying field for experimental use with
full-sized planes, and an adequate plot
| of ground has been held in reserve for
: this purpose. Furthermore, the loca
tion of the campus within a short dis
tanfce of San Francisco Bay will make
possible the development of a hydro
plane station and landing plane when
ever conditions make that desirable.
These developments will place at
Stanford facilities for research and
practical demonstration in all types of
forms of flying craft, both land and
marine, and in both model and full
scale size.
Appropriate for Stanford
In speakiug of this donation and
the possibilities which it will afford
at Stanford University, Dr. W. F.
I Durand says: "No purpose, as we well
i know lay nearer to the hearts of the
J founders of Stanford University than
j that of furnishing means for the train
ing of the youth of our country for
'lives of useful service; and from con
versation with the generous donor of
j the Guggenheim Fund for the Promo
i tion of Aeronautics, I fell justified in
! saying that no purpose perhaps now
: lies nearer the heart of Mr. Daniel
Guggenheim than that of the training
of young men for lives of useful ser
vice in fields related to the design,
I construction, and use of aircraft.
"It therefore seems peculiarly appro*
i priate that these opportunities for spe-
I cial training in aeronautic engineer
ing should thus have been made pos
sible here at Stanford through the
splendid gifts of Mr. Guggenheim,
placed where students may have the
advantage of the broad technical and
general training made possible by the
earlier gifts of Governor and Mrs.
Stanford. Thus are the generous pur
| poses and the high ideals of both the
| Stanfords and of Mr. Guggenheim the
I more fully and more perfectly rea
lized."
Research Work to Be Done
Aerodynamics furnishes the means
for determining the air conditions
which the structures must fulfil in
order to realize desired ends. Struc
tural design and construction deals
with the realization of these condi
tions in actual structural materials. In
both of these lines of work, problems
requiring laboratory research are con
tinually arising and a well-equipped
laboratory is a vital necessity not only
as a basis for instruction but as a
means for continued progress in both
the science and the art of airplane de
sign and construction.
It is expected that special attention
will be given to research and the ex
perimental study of problems con
nected with aeronautic engineering,
and for these lines of work the labora
tory with its enlarged facilities will be
peculiarly well adapted. Building upon
its past work of fourteen important
investigations, the reports of which
have been published by the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
a further series of investigations is
now contemplated dealing among
other subjects with a further study of
the reaction between the airplane
structure and the propeller, its char
acter and amount, and the most ef
fective dispositions for rendering such
interference a minimum.
Present Problems in Flying
It is expected that funds will be
found for a limited number of research
fellowships, thus furnishing financial
aid to specially qualified students
while continuing their studies along
research and advanced lines.
At the present time the major prob
lems in aeronautic engineering are
those which center around elements
which determine the safety, reliability,
and economic efficiency of aircraft in
operation. In particular, there is need
for the development of characteristics
which will permit of rising from and
landing in relatively restricted areas
and also give elements of stability
and inherent control in the air in the
absence of the usual control by the
pilot. All of this means the study of
new aerodynamic characteristics for
the elements of aircraft and their com
bination in such manner as to pro
duce the ends desired. And this means
the study by models in wind tunnel
and study of full-scale construction in
the air.
Year-Round Work
For the intensive study of develop
ments along these various lines, the
equable climatic conditions of Cali
fornia, permitting as they do work in
the air the year around, render this
state peculiarly well-suited, and these

new opportunities for scientific study i
and technical training combined with
the splendid start which the industry
has made, promise to make of the )
Pacific Coast a leading section in the
new developments in air transport
which seem to be so full of promise
for a near future.
It will be recalled that Mr. Guggen
heim something more than a year ago
gave a large endowment to New York
University to found there a school of
aeronautic engineering, and now this
gift is followed on the Pacific Coast 1
by an award of funds to two California 1
institutions, Stanford University and
the California Institute of Technology, |
at both of which new developments in
courses of instruction and in facilities
for research are thus assured.
Stanford University, with the aid of
the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the
Promotion of Aeronautics, will expand
its present work in aeronautics into a
complete and well-rounded six-year
course for the training of young men
in aerodynamics and aeronautic en
gineering. An immediate grant of
$45,000 by the Guggenheim Fund, to
gether with an assurance of financial
support over a period of ten years
representing the interest on a capital
sum of $300,000 will enable the Uni
versity to reorganize this work at
once, as a division of the School of
Engineering.
The first four years of the course
will be occupied largely with broad
engineering and general training, ,
while the last two will be devoted
wholly to intensive work in the field
of aerodynamics and aeronautic engi
neering.
The present aerodynamics labora
tory, in which experiments have been
conducted for ten years, especially in
testing propeller models, will be de
veloped and improved through the ad
dition of equipment for tests of other
parts of planes, and will be housed in
a permanent and commodious brick
and concrete structure, to take the
place of the present temporary wooden
building.
Three Divisions of Work
The work at Stanford will be organ
ized along three general lines, cover
ing the whole field, and each headed
by an expert—(l) aerodynamics, (2)
structural design and construction,
and (3) laboratory research. The men
in charge of the first two divisions are
yet to be appointed. The laboratory
will be directed by Professor E. P.
Lesley, who has for a decade been
associated with Dr. W. F. Durand in
the work of the present laboratory,
spending a year of that time in the
Aerodynamic Laboratory of the Na

Research Work to Be Done
Aerodynamics furnishes the means
for determining the air conditions
which the structures must fulfil in
order to realize desired ends. Struc
tural design and construction deals
with the realization of these condi
tions in actual structural materials. In
both of these lines of work, problems
requiring laboratory research are con
tinually arising and a well-equipped
laboratory is a vital necessity not only
as a basis for instruction but as a
means for continued progress in both
the science and the art of airplane de
sign and construction.
It is expected that special attention
will be given to research and the ex
perimental study of problems con
nected with aeronautic engineering,
and for these lines of work the labora
tory with its enlarged facilities will be
peculiarly well adapted. Building upon
its past work of fourteen important
investigations, the reports of which
have been published by the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
a further series of investigations is
now contemplated dealing among
other subjects with a further study of
the reaction between the airplane
structure and the propeller, its char
acter and amount, and the most ef
fective dispositions for rendering such
interference a minimum.
Present Problems in Flying
It is expected that funds will be
found for a limited number of research
fellowships, thus furnishing financial
aid to specially qualified students
while continuing their studies along
research and advanced lines.
At the present time the major prob
lems in aeronautic engineering are
those which center around elements
which determine the safety, reliability,
and economic efficiency of aircraft in
operation. In particular, there is need
for the development of characteristics
which will permit of rising from and
landing in relatively restricted areas
and also give elements of stability
and inherent control in the air in the
absence of the usual control by the
pilot. All of this means the study of
new aerodynamic characteristics for
the elements of aircraft and their com
bination in such manner as to pro
duce the ends desired. And this means
the study by models in wind tunnel
and study of full-scale construction in
the air.
Year-Round Work
For the intensive study of develop
ments along these various lines, the
equable climatic conditions of Cali
fornia, permitting as they do work in
the air the year around, render this
state peculiarly well-suited, and these

new opportunities for scientific study i
and technical training combined with
the splendid start which the industry
has made, promise to make of the )
Pacific Coast a leading section in the
new developments in air transport
which seem to be so full of promise
for a near future.
It will be recalled that Mr. Guggen
heim something more than a year ago
gave a large endowment to New York
University to found there a school of
aeronautic engineering, and now this
gift is followed on the Pacific Coast 1
by an award of funds to two California 1
institutions, Stanford University and
the California Institute of Technology, |
at both of which new developments in
courses of instruction and in facilities
for research are thus assured.
Stanford University, with the aid of
the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the
Promotion of Aeronautics, will expand
its present work in aeronautics into a
complete and well-rounded six-year
course for the training of young men
in aerodynamics and aeronautic en
gineering. An immediate grant of
$45,000 by the Guggenheim Fund, to
gether with an assurance of financial
support over a period of ten years
representing the interest on a capital
sum of $300,000 will enable the Uni
versity to reorganize this work at
once, as a division of the School of
Engineering.
The first four years of the course
will be occupied largely with broad
engineering and general training, ,
while the last two will be devoted
wholly to intensive work in the field
of aerodynamics and aeronautic engi
neering.
The present aerodynamics labora
tory, in which experiments have been
conducted for ten years, especially in
testing propeller models, will be de
veloped and improved through the ad
dition of equipment for tests of other
parts of planes, and will be housed in
a permanent and commodious brick
and concrete structure, to take the
place of the present temporary wooden
building.
Three Divisions of Work
The work at Stanford will be organ
ized along three general lines, cover
ing the whole field, and each headed
by an expert—(l) aerodynamics, (2)
structural design and construction,
and (3) laboratory research. The men
in charge of the first two divisions are
yet to be appointed. The laboratory
will be directed by Professor E. P.
Lesley, who has for a decade been
associated with Dr. W. F. Durand in
the work of the present laboratory,
spending a year of that time in the
Aerodynamic Laboratory of the Na
tional Advisory Committee for Avia

school of aeronautics through the
large amount of available land for a

full-sized planes, and an adequate plot

tion of the campus within a short dis
tanfce of San Francisco Bay will make
possible the development of a hydro
plane station and landing plane when

These developments will place at
Stanford facilities for research and
practical demonstration in all types of
forms of flying craft, both land and
marine, and in both model and full

tory with its enlarged facilities will be
peculiarly well adapted. Building upon
its past work of fourteen important
investigations, the reports of which
have been published by the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
a further series of investigations is
now contemplated dealing among
other subjects with a further study of
the reaction between the airplane
structure and the propeller, its char
acter and amount, and the most ef
fective dispositions for rendering such
interference a minimum.
Present Problems in Flying
It is expected that funds will be
found for a limited number of research
fellowships, thus furnishing financial
aid to specially qualified students
while continuing their studies along
research and advanced lines.
At the present time the major prob
lems in aeronautic engineering are
those which center around elements
which determine the safety, reliability,
and economic efficiency of aircraft in
operation. In particular, there is need
for the development of characteristics
which will permit of rising from and
landing in relatively restricted areas
and also give elements of stability
and inherent control in the air in the
absence of the usual control by the
pilot. All of this means the study of
new aerodynamic characteristics for
the elements of aircraft and their com
bination in such manner as to pro
duce the ends desired. And this means
the study by models in wind tunnel
and study of full-scale construction in
the air.
Year-Round Work
For the intensive study of develop
ments along these various lines, the
equable climatic conditions of Cali
fornia, permitting as they do work in
the air the year around, render this
state peculiarly well-suited, and these

new opportunities for scientific study i
and technical training combined with
the splendid start which the industry
has made, promise to make of the )
Pacific Coast a leading section in the
new developments in air transport
which seem to be so full of promise
for a near future.
It will be recalled that Mr. Guggen
heim something more than a year ago
gave a large endowment to New York
University to found there a school of
aeronautic engineering, and now this
gift is followed on the Pacific Coast 1
by an award of funds to two California 1
institutions, Stanford University and
the California Institute of Technology, |
at both of which new developments in
courses of instruction and in facilities
for research are thus assured.
Stanford University, with the aid of
the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the
Promotion of Aeronautics, will expand
its present work in aeronautics into a
complete and well-rounded six-year
course for the training of young men
in aerodynamics and aeronautic en
gineering. An immediate grant of
$45,000 by the Guggenheim Fund, to
gether with an assurance of financial
support over a period of ten years
representing the interest on a capital
sum of $300,000 will enable the Uni
versity to reorganize this work at
once, as a division of the School of
Engineering.
The first four years of the course
will be occupied largely with broad
engineering and general training, ,
while the last two will be devoted
wholly to intensive work in the field
of aerodynamics and aeronautic engi
neering.
The present aerodynamics labora
tory, in which experiments have been
conducted for ten years, especially in
testing propeller models, will be de
veloped and improved through the ad
dition of equipment for tests of other
parts of planes, and will be housed in
a permanent and commodious brick
and concrete structure, to take the
place of the present temporary wooden
building.
Three Divisions of Work
The work at Stanford will be organ
ized along three general lines, cover
ing the whole field, and each headed
by an expert—(l) aerodynamics, (2)
structural design and construction,
and (3) laboratory research. The men
in charge of the first two divisions are
yet to be appointed. The laboratory
will be directed by Professor E. P.
Lesley, who has for a decade been
associated with Dr. W. F. Durand in
the work of the present laboratory,
spending a year of that time in the
Aerodynamic Laboratory of the Na
tional Advisory Committee for Avia
tion at Langley Field, Va. Dr. Durand
is a member of this committee.
Guggenheim Experimental Laboratory
Aeronautic engineering, especially

iin its research and experimental as
jpects, is no new subject at Stanford.
' In 1916 the first wind tunnel was built,
i to be followed two years later by a
! larger and more effective installation,
! and during the ten years of this
period, experimental researches, espe
cially related to the air propeller and
its reaction with the airplane struc
ture, have been continuously and ac
tively carried on by Dr. Durand and
Professor Lesley in collaboration.
In honor of the donor whose gift
| has made possible the organization of
j this course in practical and theoretical
! aeronautics, the Stanford authorities
; plan to name the laboratory The Dan
i iel Guggenheim Experimental Labora
| tory of Aeronautics and Aeronautic
Engineering.
Space for Flying Field
The Stanford campus is peculiarly
suited for the establishment of a
school of aeronautics through the
large amount of available land for a
| fiying field for experimental use with
full-sized planes, and an adequate plot
| of ground has been held in reserve for
: this purpose. Furthermore, the loca
tion of the campus within a short dis
tanfce of San Francisco Bay will make
possible the development of a hydro
plane station and landing plane when
ever conditions make that desirable.
These developments will place at
Stanford facilities for research and
practical demonstration in all types of
forms of flying craft, both land and
marine, and in both model and full
scale size.
Appropriate for Stanford
In speakiug of this donation and
the possibilities which it will afford
at Stanford University, Dr. W. F.
I Durand says: "No purpose, as we well
i know lay nearer to the hearts of the
J founders of Stanford University than
j that of furnishing means for the train
ing of the youth of our country for
'lives of useful service; and from con
versation with the generous donor of
j the Guggenheim Fund for the Promo
i tion of Aeronautics, I fell justified in
! saying that no purpose perhaps now
: lies nearer the heart of Mr. Daniel
Guggenheim than that of the training
of young men for lives of useful ser
vice in fields related to the design,
I construction, and use of aircraft.
"It therefore seems peculiarly appro*
i priate that these opportunities for spe-
I cial training in aeronautic engineer
ing should thus have been made pos
sible here at Stanford through the
splendid gifts of Mr. Guggenheim,
placed where students may have the
advantage of the broad technical and
general training made possible by the
earlier gifts of Governor and Mrs.
Stanford. Thus are the generous pur
| poses and the high ideals of both the
| Stanfords and of Mr. Guggenheim the
I more fully and more perfectly rea
lized."
Research Work to Be Done
Aerodynamics furnishes the means
for determining the air conditions
which the structures must fulfil in
order to realize desired ends. Struc
tural design and construction deals
with the realization of these condi
tions in actual structural materials. In
both of these lines of work, problems
requiring laboratory research are con
tinually arising and a well-equipped
laboratory is a vital necessity not only
as a basis for instruction but as a
means for continued progress in both
the science and the art of airplane de
sign and construction.
It is expected that special attention
will be given to research and the ex
perimental study of problems con
nected with aeronautic engineering,
and for these lines of work the labora
tory with its enlarged facilities will be
peculiarly well adapted. Building upon
its past work of fourteen important
investigations, the reports of which
have been published by the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
a further series of investigations is
now contemplated dealing among
other subjects with a further study of
the reaction between the airplane
structure and the propeller, its char
acter and amount, and the most ef
fective dispositions for rendering such
interference a minimum.
