# A 						Loss to Stanford
## 
### 
With the beginning of next autumn quarter, secretarial training will
be discontinued as a course of study in the University. The exigencies of
a too-small budget force the Department of Economics to drop typewrit
ing, shorthand, and the study of business forms and practices from its
curriculum.
These courses have been an important part of the University program
and their absence will be keenly felt. It is not likely that they will be dis
continued permanently, but so long as they are not given it will be impos
sible for commercial teachers to complete the work for their degrees here.
From a more personal point of view, the privilege of learning typing
and shorthand in the University has given many self-supporting students
the means of working their way through college, and has equipped recently
graduated students for taking secretarial positions. The ability to type is
necessary to the best success in many lines of work at tbe present time,
and discontinuing these courses will work a hardship on a large group of
students. It is disappointing that the University should cut off one of its
already too few contacts with everyday life in the outside world.
Not only is the loss of this opportunity to learn something that is use
ful regretted, but the many students who have benefited by his work are
sorry to see Nathaniel Sanders, Instructor of Secretarial Training, leave
the University. He has served their interests faith fully for eight years
and bis departure will leave a vacancy that cannot easily be filled.
