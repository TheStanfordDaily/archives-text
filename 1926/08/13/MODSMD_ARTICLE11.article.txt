# Musicians and the Student
## 
### 
Pennies were gathered from everywhere to help pay for the Women's
Clubhouse. I look store coupons, personal donations and other methods
were employed to assist in making money to pay for the building. Among
these other methods was the renting of a group of "soundproof practice
rooms" located in the Clubhouse, to musicians, embryo and otherwise.
. . . . The Women's Clubhouse is new paid for. but the practicing still
continues. Incidentally those practice rooms are not strictly soundproof.
Students residing in the Inion are distracted throughout the entire
dav by leakages of piano and vocal renditions from these rooms. It wonld
be rather a shame to have to request that musical talent should be denied
a place for cultivation, but is equally unfortunate that students who live in
the Union should nyt have every.possible favorable condition for study. A
solution may be found in the creation of practice rooms that are really
soundproof.
