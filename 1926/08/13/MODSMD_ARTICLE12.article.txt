Sarah Soupladle just cried her eyes
out that night for her beloved Marcus
Maplenut had left for the University
of Palo Alto to study during the sum
mer. There were three reasons why
she cried so copiously, first she was
afraid of Edward Eggplant, the ice
man's helper, without the protection
of Marcus; secon'd, she feared that
Mazola McMolar, the college vamp,
would steal Marcus, and third, she had
been peeling onions just before going
to bed.

Mark had peddled all day and when
night fell lie was sold out. When he
woke up the next morning he raised
his head from the curb and nudged
the man whom he saw sleeping nearby.
"Where are we, kind sir?" quoth Mar
cus, "and can you tell me how to get
to the University of Palo Alto?"
"Certainly," replied his companion
in a tone of voice, "this is none other
than San Jose, and I will be glad,
begad, to show you the way to the
University, as I am a Student there
meself."
Three weeks had passed and Marcus
Maplenut had risen to great heights,
for he had become an athlete of note,
playing pawn on the varsity chess
team. He was idol of the live hundred,
but he had not met Mazola McMolar,
although he had seen her singing in
the choir.
One afternoon as he rode down Palm
Drive on his scarlet bicycle, a grey
Packard roadster loomed out of the
haze. Once more he woke up, finding
his head on the curb. But over him
leaned Mazola. Marcus was stunned in
more ways than one. Like the true
Amazon she was, Mazola picked him
up and threw him tenderly on the run
ning board, where she held him on by
the hair with one hand as she drove
toward Palo Alto.
