# TODAY'S TRAVELOGUE
## The
						Library 
### 
You will do well to visit the Library
before the quarter is over just to see
what it is like. Its habitues are worthy
of attention for there are three groups
of quite distinct natures: the Phi
Betes, the Librarians, and the students
who went minus during spring quar
ter. A room is provided downstairs
with individual desks for those who
have difficulty for various and sundry
reasons in concentrating at the eight
passenger tables of the main reading
room. Another place to notice is the
Hoover War Library, where there are
enough papers, which can not be
opened for fifty years, to indicate who
won the war. Capable hikers, being
careful to take along enough food for
several days, may hit the trail to the
fifth floor, where students from Colo
rado and others liking high altitudes
may study in thin air.
