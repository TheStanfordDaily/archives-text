# Second Excursion to Lick Observatory Will Be Made
## 
### 
Because of the popularity of the
excursion to Lick Observatory, a sec
ond trip will be made to Mount Ham
ilton next Saturday. According to Mr.
Sellards, all available cars were used
last time, and even these accommoda
tions were insufficient. This second
excursion will enable those who were
disappointed before, to go.
The telescope at the observatory is
one of the most powerful in the world,
and conditions of the night sky are
such that many planets and stars may
be seen. Saturn is generally the one
of greatest interest to lay observers,
because of its many rings and sate
lites.
The party will leave the campus at
4 o'clock, and return about midnight.
