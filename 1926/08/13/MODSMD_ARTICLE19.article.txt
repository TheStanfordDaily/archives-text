# SANDERS FINDS PLACE IN EUREKA AS COURSE HERE IS DISCONTINUED
## 
### 
Nathaniel Sanders, Instructor in
Secretarial Training in the Depart
ment of Economics at Stanford for the
past eight years, is leaving next
Thursday to take charge of the com
mercial departments of the Eureka
High and Junior High schools. In his
new location Mr. Sanders will also
have a place in the administrative
office where he will be at the head of
the placement bureau and will have
charge of the high school funds.
This change is made necessary for
the Instructor of Secretarial Training
because the Department of Economics
has been forced, on account of lack
of funds, to discontinue the secretarial
training courses.
Mr. Sanders came to Stanford in the
summer of 191S and says he is very
sorry to be leaving the University. He
is a staunch advocate of vocational
schooling and believes that the Depart
ment of Education here will include
that branch before many years have
passed, and that secretarial training
will be restored.
The discontinuance of these courses
makes it impossible for education ma
jors to get commercial subjects in the
University, and it also removes the
privilege enjoyed by many other stu
dents of getting university credit for
learning typing and shorthand. '
