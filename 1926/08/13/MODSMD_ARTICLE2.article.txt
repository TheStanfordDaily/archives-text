# ELECTION OF FREE TO CONGRESS, URGED BY HERBERT HOOVER, '95
## Letter to President Wilbur Shows Government Needs Constant Personnel 
### 
Herbert Hoover, '95, lias written a
letter to President Wilbur, urging the
re-election of Arthur M. Free, '01, to
Congress from this district, on the
score of past accomplishments and of
the advantage which his experience
gives him over any new man. Presi
dent Wilbur has forwarded the letter
to Congressman Free. It follows:
"1 notice that there have been a num
ber of entries against Arthur Free in
our congressional district. I am sorry
to see this, simply from the point of
view of the interest of the state of
California and the country generally.
"Free has shown himself to be one
of the ablest men that California has
in Congress. Not only has he been
most zealous in the support of every
California matter, but he has created
such a measure of esteem in Congress
generally as to give him a very wide
influence, and already he has gained a
ranking position on several of the most
important committees such as could
not be replaced except by years of
service from anyone else.
"One reason why many localities in
the United States apparently dominate
Congress is because they have learned
that continuous service of good men
places these men in a strategic posi-
tion and gives them experience and
skill in public affairs which result in
enormous advantage to their districts
and to their states and the country at
large. It would be a great pity for our
district and for California to lose the
groat gain in this direction that Free
has accomplished. Changing good men
to Congress every two or four years
absolutely negatives their possible ser
vice. It requires at least two or three
years of apprenticeship for them to
learn their way about in the govern
ment departments and in Congress
itself, as well as in the understanding
of national problems, all of which is
purely wasted by constantly shifting
personnel.
"I have no doubt that Mr. Free's op
ponents are good men but if the dis
trict and California wish service and
if they wish to contribute to national
service as well, they should maintain
skilled and experienced and continu
ous service just the same as any busi
ness concern would do.
(Signed): "Herbert Hoover."
