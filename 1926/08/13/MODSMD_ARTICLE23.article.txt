# STANFORD MARINE RESEARCH STATION SUGGESTED BY HOPKINS' FOREIGN TOUR
## 
### 
The Hopkins Marine Station of Stan
ford University, situated at Pacific
Grove, on the southern side of Monte
rey Bay, is the direct result of a trip
which Mr. Timothy Hopkins, member
of the Board of Trustees of Stanford,
took to Europe in the early days of
the University. Mr. Hopkins was so
filled with enthusiasm by the marine
station at Naples that he decided there
should be one on the Pacific Coast.
Accordingly, he gave

his support to Doc
tor Jordan who, in
1891 appointed Profes
sors Charles H. Gilbert
and Oliver Peebles
Jenkins as a faculty
committee to make
plans for the new sta
tion.
Through the gener
ous co-operation of
Mr. Hopkins and the
Pacific Improvement
Company, a suitable
site and a sum of
money sufficient to
erect the first build
ing were donated. A
plain two-story frame
structure was erected
on Point Aulon, or
"Lover's Point," and
the first classes were
held in the summer of
1892.
During the first
twenty-five years of
its existence the labo
ratory, while nominal-

ly a part of the University, and freely
using its library and apparatus, was
dependent for upkeep and extension
chiefly upon student fees and private
gifts, the latter mainly through the
constant interest of Mr. Hopkins.
Since 1916 the University has ac
quired by exchange and purchase
about eleven acres on Cabrillo Point
approximately a half mile east of the
old site. This new situation insures
complete control of the coast line of

the point, including an excellent shel
tered landing-place and harbor for
boats of considerable size, and gives
room for expansion.
Upon this site the first building of
the new Station was erected in 1917.
It is of reinforced concrete construc
tion, forty feet by eighty-three feet
over all, and is three stories in height.
The first floor provides a physiological
laboratory, a storage' room for boats

and collecting apparatus, and space
; for sorting of collections. It also con
| tains a furnace room, a photographic
| dark room, and two research rooms.
| The second floor is devoted to the
; general laboratories, and the third
| story consists of a large library and
I private laboratories for investigators.
Originally the Hopkins Marine sta
tion was open to students only during
i the summer quarter, but two years
j ago it was opened for two quarters,

1 and beginning next year classes will
be held there during nine months of
the year. Spring and summer quarters
will accommodate elementary students
in the biological sciences, but the win
! ter quarter will, in a large measure,
be devoted to advanced students.
Professor Waller K. Fisher has been,
director of the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion since 1916, when it was moved
from its old location. Besides Profes-

; sor Fislier, there are two permanent
j resident professors at the station, Doc
tors Harold Heath and Tage Skogs
berg. The staff for this summer in
! eludes twelve men and this number
| will be increased with the erection of
! the new Jacques Loeb Laboratory next
j year.
The present enrollment includes be
' tween 35 and 40 students who are
i studying medicine or are students in
1 the biological sciences.

room for expansion.
Upon this site the first building of
the new Station was erected in 1917.
It is of reinforced concrete construc
tion, forty feet by eighty-three feet
over all, and is three stories in height.
The first floor provides a physiological
laboratory, a storage' room for boats

and collecting apparatus, and space
; for sorting of collections. It also con
| tains a furnace room, a photographic
| dark room, and two research rooms.
| The second floor is devoted to the
; general laboratories, and the third
| story consists of a large library and
I private laboratories for investigators.
Originally the Hopkins Marine sta
tion was open to students only during
i the summer quarter, but two years
j ago it was opened for two quarters,

1 and beginning next year classes will
be held there during nine months of
the year. Spring and summer quarters
will accommodate elementary students
in the biological sciences, but the win
! ter quarter will, in a large measure,
be devoted to advanced students.
Professor Waller K. Fisher has been,
director of the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion since 1916, when it was moved
from its old location. Besides Profes-

; sor Fislier, there are two permanent
j resident professors at the station, Doc
tors Harold Heath and Tage Skogs
berg. The staff for this summer in
! eludes twelve men and this number
| will be increased with the erection of
! the new Jacques Loeb Laboratory next
j year.
The present enrollment includes be
' tween 35 and 40 students who are
i studying medicine or are students in
1 the biological sciences.


HOPKINS MARINE STATION AT LOW TIDE
The Hopkins Marine Station of Stan
ford University, situated at Pacific
Grove, on the southern side of Monte
rey Bay, is the direct result of a trip
which Mr. Timothy Hopkins, member
of the Board of Trustees of Stanford,
took to Europe in the early days of
the University. Mr. Hopkins was so
filled with enthusiasm by the marine
station at Naples that he decided there
should be one on the Pacific Coast.
Accordingly, he gave

his support to Doc
tor Jordan who, in
1891 appointed Profes
sors Charles H. Gilbert
and Oliver Peebles
Jenkins as a faculty
committee to make
plans for the new sta
tion.
Through the gener
ous co-operation of
Mr. Hopkins and the
Pacific Improvement
Company, a suitable
site and a sum of
money sufficient to
erect the first build
ing were donated. A
plain two-story frame
structure was erected
on Point Aulon, or
"Lover's Point," and
the first classes were
held in the summer of
1892.
During the first
twenty-five years of
its existence the labo
ratory, while nominal-

ly a part of the University, and freely
using its library and apparatus, was
dependent for upkeep and extension
chiefly upon student fees and private
gifts, the latter mainly through the
constant interest of Mr. Hopkins.
Since 1916 the University has ac
quired by exchange and purchase
about eleven acres on Cabrillo Point
approximately a half mile east of the
old site. This new situation insures
complete control of the coast line of

the point, including an excellent shel
tered landing-place and harbor for
boats of considerable size, and gives
room for expansion.
