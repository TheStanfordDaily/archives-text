# DR. CARRE DISCUSSES PAUL VERLAINE'S LIFE, WORK, AND INFLUENCE
## Says They Are Inseparable; Poetry Shows Emotions And Experiences 
### 
j Jean-Marie Carr6, professor at the
I University of Lyons, lectured Wednes
day in the Little Theatre, on "Le podte
Paul Verlaine."
The chief contribution of Verlaine
was to take French poetry away from
its eighteenth century formality, and
to give it nuance, music, and liberty.
He was a symbolist, and all his poetry
was sincere in its expression.
Poetry Reflects Life
Dr. Carr6 showed that the life and
work of the poet were inseparable.
His childhood in the north of France
reflected itself in all his verses. No
brilliant color and sunshine are found,
but shading, vagueness, and tinting
suggestive of the fog-drenched coun
try in which he lived, are used.
Verlaine attended the Sorbonne,
where Tie was considered a dreamer
and a mediocre student. At the caf6s
in Paris, which were the meeting
places of students and would-be gen
iuses, he fell in with the Parnassien
school of writers, who believed that
all work should be conventionalized in
form, and to a great extent in content,
i Verlaine's "Saturnien Poems" show
j this influence; they are impersonal,!
passionless, classic.
Dr. Garr6 said that his second group
of poems, "Les Fetes Gallantes,"
i which depicts eighteenth century life,
still shows the effect of the Parnassien
! group. It was not until he wrote "La
! Bonne Chanson," that he became |
really great.
Domestic Troubles Inspire Verse
Romance and domestic troubles i
were the inspirations of some of his
most beautiful work. Dr. Carr6 dis- ;
cussed his poems of reconciliation to i
his wife, and his verses of despair
; when she divorced him. Two years in j
jail, as a result of shooting his friend, :
! Rimbaud, produced poems of exquisite |
j sadness, that had his over-emphasized
I emotions and prison incidents as their ;
subjects.
During the latter part of Verlaine's j
life, he was converted to Catholicism, 1
but his last days were spent in pov- j
erty and drunkenness, in Paris.
