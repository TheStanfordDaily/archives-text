# COMEDY "AREN'T WE ALL?" ENDS THEATRICAL SEASON
## 
### 
"Aren't We All?" tonight's play in
the Assembly Hall, is one of the
cleverest comedies ever staged at
Stanford. Again, it is English, but not
the English of "Hay Fever."
Frederick Lonsdale deals with far
more sophisticated characters than
Noel Coward but he treats their so
phistication with a sort of tolerance,
with a keenness and a bantering hu-

mor quite different from Coward's
caricature which holds a bit of Eng
lish life up rather as a cartoon.
The lines in "Aren't We All?" fairly
flash with charming wit which raises
them above mere comedy. Beneath
this there is a tone of tolerance, al
most philosophy, running through the
play, in the light of which the brilliant
repartee seems to be more delightful
and the characters more real and like
able.

The character lead, Lord Grenliam,
is played by Gordon Davis, who also
directs the play. Mr. Davis was promi
! nent in campus dramatics here in
| 1915, '16, and '17. Since then he has
won distinction in such plays as Alfred
! Noise's "Sherwood," Galsworthy's
! "Justice," the "Yellow Jacket," "The
; Dover Road," etc. Recently he has
j played in "The Importance of Being

[ Earnest" and "Hell Bent Fer Heaven."
J He received his stage training from
Grace George, internationally known
I actress.
As Lord Grenham, Davis is surpass
ing. He portrays the Completely so
phisticated English gentleman who has
] devoted his life to "agriculture and
women" and to polishing his unusual
wit. Despite his cleverness he finally
! falls a prey to Lady Mary Frinton.

Wayne Newcomb plays the juvenile,
Hon. Willie Tatham, a role for which
he is admirably suited. As young Tat
ham he has not reached the age of
even slight discretion. Margot, his
wife, returns from Egypt to find him
in the act of kissing the beautiful
Kitty Lake. He cannot explain, is tor
mented almost out of his wits, and is
not enough of a philosopher to await
events but tries to cut his way through
his troubles. This is the most difficult
part Newcomb has essayed and his
rendition of it is well worthy of note.
Margot Tatham, the leading femi
nine role, is taken by Miss Sarah Mar
garet Burns. She seems to have caught
a tone different from the general run
of college acting. She presents her
part with a sincerity which makes
it live and adds greatly to its charm.
There is something decidedly superior
about Miss Burns' treatment of Mar
got.
The rather "gushing" Lady Mary
Frinton is played very delightfully by
Miss Elizabeth Wilbur. Lady Frinton
is the leading comic figure of the play
and Miss Wilbur seems to be develop
ing all the possibilities in her role
without overdoing them.
Miss Claore Dawes' portrayal of the
Hon. Mrs. Ernest Lynton is very well
done and Reidar Torjussen is doing
excellent work as the Rev. Ernest
Lynton.
The other members of the cast have
attractively developed their roles and
have kept the atmosphere of the play
throughout.
On the whole "Aren't We All" bids
fair to be the most delightful comedy
so far presented here. Its remarkable
wit and deeper current of fine humor
have made it acclaimed by many
American audiences and its rendition
tonight will be well up to Stanford's
high dramatic standard.
