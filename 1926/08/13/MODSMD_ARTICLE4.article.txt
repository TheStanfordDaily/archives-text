# COMEDY "AREN'T WE ALL?" ENDS THEATRICAL SEASON
## 
### 
"Aren't We All?" tonight's play in
the Assembly Hall, is one of the
cleverest comedies ever staged at
Stanford. Again, it is English, but not
the English of "Hay Fever."
Frederick Lonsdale deals with far
more sophisticated characters than
Noel Coward but he treats their so
phistication with a sort of tolerance,
with a keenness and a bantering hu-

mor quite different from Coward's
caricature which holds a bit of Eng
lish life up rather as a cartoon.
The lines in "Aren't We All?" fairly
flash with charming wit which raises
them above mere comedy. Beneath
this there is a tone of tolerance, al
most philosophy, running through the
play, in the light of which the brilliant
repartee seems to be more delightful
and the characters more real and like
able.

The character lead, Lord Grenliam,
is played by Gordon Davis, who also
directs the play. Mr. Davis was promi
! nent in campus dramatics here in
| 1915, '16, and '17. Since then he has
won distinction in such plays as Alfred
! Noise's "Sherwood," Galsworthy's
! "Justice," the "Yellow Jacket," "The
; Dover Road," etc. Recently he has
j played in "The Importance of Being

[ Earnest" and "Hell Bent Fer Heaven."
J He received his stage training from
Grace George, internationally known
I actress.
As Lord Grenham, Davis is surpass
ing. He portrays the Completely so
phisticated English gentleman who has
] devoted his life to "agriculture and
women" and to polishing his unusual
wit. Despite his cleverness he finally
! falls a prey to Lady Mary Frinton.
