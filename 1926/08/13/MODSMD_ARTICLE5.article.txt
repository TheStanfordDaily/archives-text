# ROCKFELLER ENDOWMENT ASSURES NEW LABORATORY.
## 
### 
Stanford University will take a great
step forward in its program of re
search in the biological sciences and
will provide additional teaching facili
ties at the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove with the erection there
next year of a second laboratory build
ing made possible by a $100,000 grant
given recently by the Rockefeller
Foundation for the furtherance of Ma
rine Physiological Research.
This gift to Stanford University is
a recognition of the value of biological
research And is a tacit acknowledge
ment of the superiority of the location
of the Hopkins Marine Station over
other sites examined by the Rocke
feller Foundation, for investigations
of this kind.
Stanford to Provide Income
The original Marine Station was a
gift of Mr. Timothy Hopkins, the only
man who has been on the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University since
its beginning, and it was named the
Hopkins Seaside Laboratory in his
honor. In 1917 the name was changed
to the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University. Professor Walter
K. Fisher, a Stanford graduate, has
been Director of the station since that
time.

The Rockefeller Foundation is mak
ing this graut of $100,000 with the
stipulation that Stanford University
provide a yearly income from a like
amount to be used in carrying on the
research work. This income has been
guaranteed by the University until an
endowment fund for the purpose can
be raised.
The new unit of the Hopkins Marine
Station will be a two-story concrete
structure and will contain chemical,
bacteriological, physiological, and
microtechnique laboratories, as well
as four dark rooms for spectroscopic
and photometric work and a thermo
stat room containing eight large ther
mostats.
Jacques Loeb Laboratory
It will be called the Jacques Loeb
Laboratory for Marine Physiology in
honor of Jacques Loeb, who a few
years ago made his startling experi
ments and discoveries in artificial
parthenogenesis near the place where
the new laboratory is to be erected.
This additional unit to the Hopkins
Marine Station will be primarily de
voted to experimental phases of bio
logical work, but ultimately there will
be facilities for research in pertinent
fields of physics and chemistry.
The present three-story building is
not suitable for physiological work
and, furthermore, is badly over-crowd
ed during the summer quarter, and
the new unit will provide the greater
working space and larger variety of
specialized equipment essential to
handling the wealth of experimental
material to be had at the Station.
Building Has Two Wings
Messrs. Bakewell and Brown, the
architects who did the Stanford Union
and other campus buildings, are pre
paring plans for the structure which
will consist of a central portion of two
stories, on either side of which will
be two L-shaped wings of one story,
enclosing a front courtyard to be used
as a small botanical garden. One wing
will be devoted more particularly to
