# ROCKFELLER ENDOWMENT ASSURES NEW LABORATORY.
## 
### 
Stanford University will take a great
step forward in its program of re
search in the biological sciences and
will provide additional teaching facili
ties at the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove with the erection there
next year of a second laboratory build
ing made possible by a $100,000 grant
given recently by the Rockefeller
Foundation for the furtherance of Ma
rine Physiological Research.
This gift to Stanford University is
a recognition of the value of biological
research And is a tacit acknowledge
ment of the superiority of the location
of the Hopkins Marine Station over
other sites examined by the Rocke
feller Foundation, for investigations
of this kind.
Stanford to Provide Income
The original Marine Station was a
gift of Mr. Timothy Hopkins, the only
man who has been on the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University since
its beginning, and it was named the
Hopkins Seaside Laboratory in his
honor. In 1917 the name was changed
to the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University. Professor Walter
K. Fisher, a Stanford graduate, has
been Director of the station since that
time.

The Rockefeller Foundation is mak
ing this graut of $100,000 with the
stipulation that Stanford University
provide a yearly income from a like
amount to be used in carrying on the
research work. This income has been
guaranteed by the University until an
endowment fund for the purpose can
be raised.
The new unit of the Hopkins Marine
Station will be a two-story concrete
structure and will contain chemical,
bacteriological, physiological, and
microtechnique laboratories, as well
as four dark rooms for spectroscopic
and photometric work and a thermo
stat room containing eight large ther
mostats.
Jacques Loeb Laboratory
It will be called the Jacques Loeb
Laboratory for Marine Physiology in
honor of Jacques Loeb, who a few
years ago made his startling experi
ments and discoveries in artificial
parthenogenesis near the place where
the new laboratory is to be erected.
This additional unit to the Hopkins
Marine Station will be primarily de
voted to experimental phases of bio
logical work, but ultimately there will
be facilities for research in pertinent
fields of physics and chemistry.
The present three-story building is
not suitable for physiological work
and, furthermore, is badly over-crowd
ed during the summer quarter, and
the new unit will provide the greater
working space and larger variety of
specialized equipment essential to
handling the wealth of experimental
material to be had at the Station.
Building Has Two Wings
Messrs. Bakewell and Brown, the
architects who did the Stanford Union
and other campus buildings, are pre
paring plans for the structure which
will consist of a central portion of two
stories, on either side of which will
be two L-shaped wings of one story,
enclosing a front courtyard to be used
as a small botanical garden. One wing
will be devoted more particularly to
research, for which the specialized
rooms and apparatus already men
tioned will be available. The other
wing will be given over to laboratories
for instruction and to private labora
tories for individual investigators,
some of which will be placed at the
disposal of visiting scientists. A ma
chine shop will be provided, and the
second story of the building will be
used for the library and seminar
rooms.
The long axis of the building will be
about 150 feet; the length of either
flanking wing, at right angles to this,
will be about 90 feet.
New Salt-Water Aquaria
The new laboratory will be supplied
with salt water for aquaria, for which
the construction of a new salt-water
system will be necessary. Very prob
ably, according to Professor Fisher, a
large outside storage tank will be con
structed on the highest part of the
point on which the Station is located
and which is sufficiently elevated to
supply the new building, and the sec
ond story of the present building, by
gravity.
Professors Ernest Gale Martin,
Frank W. Weymouth, and James P.
Baumberger will carry on research in
the new laboratory and will also use
the new building for their summer
courses in physiology which have been
given since-1918.
| All the men associated with the Hop
kins Marine Station work on research
problems of their own aside from their
teaching activities.
Research Important
The research in physiology will be
under the general direction of Profes
sor L. B. Becking, who will be in resi
dence at the Hopkins Marine Station
after his return from Europe. Studies
in bio-chemistry will be carried on by
Doctor Laurence Irving who took his
Ph.D. degree at Stanford and is now a
National Research Council fellow in
Germany studying bio-chemistry at
Professor Embden's laboratory at
Frankfurt. Professor C. V. Taylor will
carry on other phases of biological
research and instruction. During the
summer quarters the Station will have
a valuable associate in Doctor Arthur
Russell Moore, the new head of the
Department of Zoology, University of
Oregon, who is for the current quarter
Acting Professor of Physiology, in col
laboration with Doctor Weymouth, at
the Marine Station.
Men in the biology department of
the University of California utilize the
work done at the Stanford Marine
Station at Pacific Grove and carry on
research work there. Doctor Charles
A. Kofoid, Professor of Zoology at
California, has been teaching there,
and Doctor Tage Skogsberg, who has
been associated with him both at Cali
fornia and at Pacific Grove, is now
permanently attached to the staff of
the Hopkins Marine Station.
Co-operation Planned
It is the intention of the University
that the work of the Hopkins Marine
Station with its new facilities for re
search shall co-operate with that of
Doctor T. Wayland Vaughan and his
staff at the Scripps Institute for
Oceanography at La Jolla, and with
the Coastal Laboratory of the Carnegie
Institution at Carmel, under Doctor H.
A. Spoehr, who is at present making
significant progress in his experiments
with photosynthesis, or the process by
which green plants utilize solar energy
in the manufacture of sugars.
The regiftn about the south point of
Monterey Bay has long been recog
nized as supporting an extraordinarily
rich fauna and flora between high and
low tide levels. The situation was
chosen in 1891 after careful considera
tion by Doctors O. P. Jenkins and
Charles H. Gilbert of the Stanford
Zoology Department as the site for
the old Hopkins Seaside Laboratory.
The wisdom of the choice of this early
committee has become increasingly
evident as the years have passed, and
the Station is now entering upon the
most promising period of its existence
of twenty-four years.

Have you ever noticed that the pro
fessor who reads the manuscript of his
new book to his class and asks for
criticisms Is always sore when h»
gets them?

Co-operation Planned
It is the intention of the University
that the work of the Hopkins Marine
Station with its new facilities for re
search shall co-operate with that of
Doctor T. Wayland Vaughan and his
staff at the Scripps Institute for
Oceanography at La Jolla, and with
the Coastal Laboratory of the Carnegie
Institution at Carmel, under Doctor H.
A. Spoehr, who is at present making
significant progress in his experiments
with photosynthesis, or the process by
which green plants utilize solar energy
in the manufacture of sugars.
The regiftn about the south point of
Monterey Bay has long been recog
nized as supporting an extraordinarily
rich fauna and flora between high and
low tide levels. The situation was
chosen in 1891 after careful considera
tion by Doctors O. P. Jenkins and
Charles H. Gilbert of the Stanford
Zoology Department as the site for
the old Hopkins Seaside Laboratory.
The wisdom of the choice of this early
committee has become increasingly
evident as the years have passed, and
the Station is now entering upon the
most promising period of its existence
of twenty-four years.

Stanford University will take a great
step forward in its program of re
search in the biological sciences and
will provide additional teaching facili
ties at the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove with the erection there
next year of a second laboratory build
ing made possible by a $100,000 grant
given recently by the Rockefeller
Foundation for the furtherance of Ma
rine Physiological Research.
This gift to Stanford University is
a recognition of the value of biological
research And is a tacit acknowledge
ment of the superiority of the location
of the Hopkins Marine Station over
other sites examined by the Rocke
feller Foundation, for investigations
of this kind.
Stanford to Provide Income
The original Marine Station was a
gift of Mr. Timothy Hopkins, the only
man who has been on the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University since
its beginning, and it was named the
Hopkins Seaside Laboratory in his
honor. In 1917 the name was changed
to the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University. Professor Walter
K. Fisher, a Stanford graduate, has
been Director of the station since that
time.

The Rockefeller Foundation is mak
ing this graut of $100,000 with the
stipulation that Stanford University
provide a yearly income from a like
amount to be used in carrying on the
research work. This income has been
guaranteed by the University until an
endowment fund for the purpose can
be raised.
The new unit of the Hopkins Marine
Station will be a two-story concrete
structure and will contain chemical,
bacteriological, physiological, and
microtechnique laboratories, as well
as four dark rooms for spectroscopic
and photometric work and a thermo
stat room containing eight large ther
mostats.
Jacques Loeb Laboratory
It will be called the Jacques Loeb
Laboratory for Marine Physiology in
honor of Jacques Loeb, who a few
years ago made his startling experi
ments and discoveries in artificial
parthenogenesis near the place where
the new laboratory is to be erected.
This additional unit to the Hopkins
Marine Station will be primarily de
voted to experimental phases of bio
logical work, but ultimately there will
be facilities for research in pertinent
fields of physics and chemistry.
The present three-story building is
not suitable for physiological work
and, furthermore, is badly over-crowd
ed during the summer quarter, and
the new unit will provide the greater
working space and larger variety of
specialized equipment essential to
handling the wealth of experimental
material to be had at the Station.
Building Has Two Wings
Messrs. Bakewell and Brown, the
architects who did the Stanford Union
and other campus buildings, are pre
paring plans for the structure which
will consist of a central portion of two
stories, on either side of which will
be two L-shaped wings of one story,
enclosing a front courtyard to be used
as a small botanical garden. One wing
will be devoted more particularly to
research, for which the specialized
rooms and apparatus already men
tioned will be available. The other
wing will be given over to laboratories
for instruction and to private labora
tories for individual investigators,
some of which will be placed at the
disposal of visiting scientists. A ma
chine shop will be provided, and the
second story of the building will be
used for the library and seminar
rooms.
The long axis of the building will be
about 150 feet; the length of either
flanking wing, at right angles to this,
will be about 90 feet.
New Salt-Water Aquaria
The new laboratory will be supplied
with salt water for aquaria, for which
the construction of a new salt-water
system will be necessary. Very prob
ably, according to Professor Fisher, a
large outside storage tank will be con
structed on the highest part of the
point on which the Station is located
and which is sufficiently elevated to
supply the new building, and the sec
ond story of the present building, by
gravity.
Professors Ernest Gale Martin,
Frank W. Weymouth, and James P.
Baumberger will carry on research in
the new laboratory and will also use
the new building for their summer
courses in physiology which have been
given since-1918.
| All the men associated with the Hop
kins Marine Station work on research
problems of their own aside from their
teaching activities.
Research Important
The research in physiology will be
under the general direction of Profes
sor L. B. Becking, who will be in resi
dence at the Hopkins Marine Station
after his return from Europe. Studies
in bio-chemistry will be carried on by
Doctor Laurence Irving who took his
Ph.D. degree at Stanford and is now a
National Research Council fellow in
Germany studying bio-chemistry at
Professor Embden's laboratory at
Frankfurt. Professor C. V. Taylor will
carry on other phases of biological
research and instruction. During the
summer quarters the Station will have
a valuable associate in Doctor Arthur
Russell Moore, the new head of the
Department of Zoology, University of
Oregon, who is for the current quarter
Acting Professor of Physiology, in col
laboration with Doctor Weymouth, at
the Marine Station.
Men in the biology department of
the University of California utilize the

the new building for their summer
courses in physiology which have been
given since-1918.

Research Important
The research in physiology will be
under the general direction of Profes
sor L. B. Becking, who will be in resi
dence at the Hopkins Marine Station
after his return from Europe. Studies
in bio-chemistry will be carried on by
Doctor Laurence Irving who took his
Ph.D. degree at Stanford and is now a
National Research Council fellow in
Germany studying bio-chemistry at
Professor Embden's laboratory at
Frankfurt. Professor C. V. Taylor will
carry on other phases of biological
research and instruction. During the
summer quarters the Station will have
a valuable associate in Doctor Arthur
Russell Moore, the new head of the
Department of Zoology, University of
Oregon, who is for the current quarter
Acting Professor of Physiology, in col
laboration with Doctor Weymouth, at
the Marine Station.
Men in the biology department of
the University of California utilize the
work done at the Stanford Marine
Station at Pacific Grove and carry on
research work there. Doctor Charles
A. Kofoid, Professor of Zoology at
California, has been teaching there,
and Doctor Tage Skogsberg, who has
been associated with him both at Cali
fornia and at Pacific Grove, is now
permanently attached to the staff of
the Hopkins Marine Station.
Co-operation Planned
It is the intention of the University
that the work of the Hopkins Marine
Station with its new facilities for re
search shall co-operate with that of
Doctor T. Wayland Vaughan and his
staff at the Scripps Institute for
Oceanography at La Jolla, and with
the Coastal Laboratory of the Carnegie
Institution at Carmel, under Doctor H.
A. Spoehr, who is at present making
significant progress in his experiments
with photosynthesis, or the process by
which green plants utilize solar energy
in the manufacture of sugars.
The regiftn about the south point of
Monterey Bay has long been recog
nized as supporting an extraordinarily
rich fauna and flora between high and
low tide levels. The situation was
chosen in 1891 after careful considera
tion by Doctors O. P. Jenkins and
Charles H. Gilbert of the Stanford
Zoology Department as the site for
the old Hopkins Seaside Laboratory.
The wisdom of the choice of this early
committee has become increasingly
evident as the years have passed, and
the Station is now entering upon the
most promising period of its existence
of twenty-four years.

Stanford University will take a great
step forward in its program of re
search in the biological sciences and
will provide additional teaching facili
ties at the Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove with the erection there
next year of a second laboratory build
ing made possible by a $100,000 grant
given recently by the Rockefeller
Foundation for the furtherance of Ma
rine Physiological Research.
This gift to Stanford University is
a recognition of the value of biological
research And is a tacit acknowledge
ment of the superiority of the location
of the Hopkins Marine Station over
other sites examined by the Rocke
feller Foundation, for investigations
of this kind.
Stanford to Provide Income
The original Marine Station was a
gift of Mr. Timothy Hopkins, the only
man who has been on the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University since
its beginning, and it was named the
Hopkins Seaside Laboratory in his
honor. In 1917 the name was changed
to the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University. Professor Walter
K. Fisher, a Stanford graduate, has
been Director of the station since that
time.

The Rockefeller Foundation is mak
ing this graut of $100,000 with the
stipulation that Stanford University
provide a yearly income from a like
amount to be used in carrying on the
research work. This income has been
guaranteed by the University until an
endowment fund for the purpose can
be raised.
The new unit of the Hopkins Marine
Station will be a two-story concrete
structure and will contain chemical,
bacteriological, physiological, and
microtechnique laboratories, as well
as four dark rooms for spectroscopic
and photometric work and a thermo
stat room containing eight large ther
mostats.
Jacques Loeb Laboratory
It will be called the Jacques Loeb
Laboratory for Marine Physiology in
honor of Jacques Loeb, who a few
years ago made his startling experi
ments and discoveries in artificial
parthenogenesis near the place where
the new laboratory is to be erected.
This additional unit to the Hopkins
Marine Station will be primarily de
voted to experimental phases of bio
logical work, but ultimately there will
be facilities for research in pertinent
fields of physics and chemistry.
The present three-story building is
not suitable for physiological work
and, furthermore, is badly over-crowd
ed during the summer quarter, and
the new unit will provide the greater
working space and larger variety of
specialized equipment essential to
handling the wealth of experimental
material to be had at the Station.
Building Has Two Wings
Messrs. Bakewell and Brown, the
architects who did the Stanford Union
and other campus buildings, are pre
paring plans for the structure which
will consist of a central portion of two
stories, on either side of which will
be two L-shaped wings of one story,
enclosing a front courtyard to be used
as a small botanical garden. One wing
will be devoted more particularly to
research, for which the specialized
rooms and apparatus already men
tioned will be available. The other
wing will be given over to laboratories
for instruction and to private labora
tories for individual investigators,
some of which will be placed at the
disposal of visiting scientists. A ma
chine shop will be provided, and the
second story of the building will be
used for the library and seminar
rooms.
The long axis of the building will be
about 150 feet; the length of either
flanking wing, at right angles to this,
will be about 90 feet.
New Salt-Water Aquaria
The new laboratory will be supplied
with salt water for aquaria, for which
the construction of a new salt-water
system will be necessary. Very prob
ably, according to Professor Fisher, a
large outside storage tank will be con
structed on the highest part of the
point on which the Station is located
and which is sufficiently elevated to
supply the new building, and the sec
ond story of the present building, by
gravity.
Professors Ernest Gale Martin,
Frank W. Weymouth, and James P.
Baumberger will carry on research in
the new laboratory and will also use
