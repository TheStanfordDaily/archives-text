# DOUGLASS DISCUSSES CHANGED CURRICULUM OF MODERN EDUCATION
## Traditional Organizations Undergo Processes of Experimentation 
### 
Addresses by Harl Roy Douglass,
i Acting Associate Professor of Educa
tion, and William G. Hale, Acting Pro
fessor of Law, were the features of the
regular session of the Education Men's
j puncheon Club, held yesterday noon
in the Union Dining Hall under the
| chairmanship of Mr. Frank Baunian.
Professor Douglass chose for his
j topic, "Some Phases of Curriculum
: Organization." He pointed out that
! since the time of the old grammar
school down to the present day, the
curriculum of the American High
School has undergone constant change.
Never yet has anyone outlined a plan
of study capable of successfully en
during the test of time. This is be
cause heretofore all revisions have
been made as a result of the opinions
of the uninformed public or of those
of prejudiced school authorities and
self-styled experts, and not according
to the disclosures of scientific investi
gation.
Pleads for Scientific View
"There is a point," said Professor
Douglass, "beyond which law opinion
and that of the 'school expert' cannot
go in determining school curriculum.
We have now reached that poijt. The
plans of the future must be raid on
the grounds of scientific investigation.
We must learn what it is the student
most needs and discover how to se
cure it for him."

Hale Touches Democracy

Professor Hale, in his treatment of
"Democratic Ideas in the Administra
tion of Justice," dwelt 011 three points
where the public assumes to play a
prominent role in our legal system.
These are the development and opera
tion of the jury, the selection of judges
and fixing their tenure of office, and
the determination of rules of proce
dure.
"Too much emphasis," asserted Pro
fessor Hale, "is laid on government by
the people and not enough 011 govern
ment for the people. Under an ultra
democracy, all people think that they
must do all things. It would be much
wiser to delegate authority and power
to those who, as a result of training

and experience, are competent to
wield them; these delegates could
then be held strictly to account for
action which would concern the peo
ple.

"The futility of lay participation in
trial," said the speaker, "is seen in
the manner that we make jurors, often
ignorant of important legal principles,
act not only as fact-finders but as law
interpreters. For the brief time that
the trial is in process the judge is
expected to act as an unbiased instruc
tor so that the jury may cast an intel
ligent decision, often in cases which
should rightfully involve profound
legal training.
"Another condition which demands
remedy," continued the speaker, "is
that which permits a state judge to
receive his judicial office as a result
of direct popular vote. This places the
judgeship in politics and frequently
the truly qualified man, who is usually
the least spectacular, never becomes
a judge.
"The determination of the rules of
procedure is customarily the task of
the state legislature, a body whose
members, taken as a whole, are in
competent through lack of training to
fulfil such a function. If this power
were taken from the legislature and
vested in the supreme court or a judi
cial council consisting of qualified
members, greater efficiency and cen
tralization of responsibility would re
sult."
Graduates Talk
The meeting also listened to a few
remarks from P. C. Super
intendent of Schols at Echo, Oregon,
and Victor Sether, of the faculty of
Medford High School, Medford, Ore
gon. Both of these men are at present
taking graduate work in the Stanford
School of Education.
All of the speakers were from Ore
gon. This state is the home residence
of more than 2f> of the summer stu
dents in Education at Stanford.

to those who, as a result of training

and experience, are competent to
wield them; these delegates could
then be held strictly to account for
action which would concern the peo
ple.

"The futility of lay participation in
trial," said the speaker, "is seen in
the manner that we make jurors, often
ignorant of important legal principles,
act not only as fact-finders but as law
interpreters. For the brief time that
the trial is in process the judge is
expected to act as an unbiased instruc
tor so that the jury may cast an intel
ligent decision, often in cases which
should rightfully involve profound
legal training.
"Another condition which demands
remedy," continued the speaker, "is
that which permits a state judge to
receive his judicial office as a result
of direct popular vote. This places the
judgeship in politics and frequently
the truly qualified man, who is usually
the least spectacular, never becomes
a judge.
"The determination of the rules of
procedure is customarily the task of
the state legislature, a body whose
members, taken as a whole, are in
competent through lack of training to
fulfil such a function. If this power
were taken from the legislature and
vested in the supreme court or a judi
cial council consisting of qualified
members, greater efficiency and cen
tralization of responsibility would re
sult."
Graduates Talk
The meeting also listened to a few
remarks from P. C. Super
intendent of Schols at Echo, Oregon,
and Victor Sether, of the faculty of
Medford High School, Medford, Ore
gon. Both of these men are at present
taking graduate work in the Stanford
School of Education.
All of the speakers were from Ore
gon. This state is the home residence
of more than 2f> of the summer stu
dents in Education at Stanford.
Addresses by Harl Roy Douglass,
i Acting Associate Professor of Educa
tion, and William G. Hale, Acting Pro
fessor of Law, were the features of the
regular session of the Education Men's
j puncheon Club, held yesterday noon
in the Union Dining Hall under the
| chairmanship of Mr. Frank Baunian.
Professor Douglass chose for his
j topic, "Some Phases of Curriculum
: Organization." He pointed out that
! since the time of the old grammar
school down to the present day, the
curriculum of the American High
School has undergone constant change.
Never yet has anyone outlined a plan
of study capable of successfully en
during the test of time. This is be
cause heretofore all revisions have
been made as a result of the opinions
of the uninformed public or of those
of prejudiced school authorities and
self-styled experts, and not according
to the disclosures of scientific investi
gation.
Pleads for Scientific View
"There is a point," said Professor
Douglass, "beyond which law opinion
and that of the 'school expert' cannot
go in determining school curriculum.
We have now reached that poijt. The
plans of the future must be raid on
the grounds of scientific investigation.
We must learn what it is the student
most needs and discover how to se
cure it for him."

Hale Touches Democracy

Professor Hale, in his treatment of
"Democratic Ideas in the Administra
tion of Justice," dwelt 011 three points
where the public assumes to play a
prominent role in our legal system.
These are the development and opera
tion of the jury, the selection of judges
and fixing their tenure of office, and
the determination of rules of proce
dure.
"Too much emphasis," asserted Pro
fessor Hale, "is laid on government by
the people and not enough 011 govern
ment for the people. Under an ultra
democracy, all people think that they
must do all things. It would be much
wiser to delegate authority and power
to those who, as a result of training

and experience, are competent to
wield them; these delegates could
then be held strictly to account for
action which would concern the peo
ple.
