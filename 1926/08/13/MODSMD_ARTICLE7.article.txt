# TUITION AND FEES TO BE EQUALIZED BY CHANGED RULE
## Graduate Student Expenses Increased to Rate Paid By Undergraduates $10 "COMMUNITY FEE" New Regulations Effective In January for Those Entering Stanford 
### 
Undergraduate students at Stanford
University will hereafter pay $85 a
quarter tuition instead of $75, as at
present, without its costing them any
more money. Graduate students will
also pay the same $85 tuition fee, but
it will take more money out of their
pockets, since they have hitherto been
charged only $50 tuition and have been
exempt from the fee collected by the
University for the support of student
enterprises and social and health
agencies.
Uniformity Sought
The change in the regulations of tui
tion fees, President Wilbur explains
in announcing the decision of the
Board of Trustees, is to secure uni

has arisen through having a variety of
fees for different kinds of students.

; Up to this tiipe undergraduates have
I paid $75 and an "incidental fee" of $20,
| which was instituted by Mrs. Stanford
j in the early years of the University.
| This fee included a variety of special
j charges, and also the $10 which the
| University collects on behalf of the
! Associated Students and other com
i mon student enterprises. The "inci
; dental fee" will be abolished through
' combination with the tuition fee, and
j the students' $10 will be known as
, the "community fee." The net result
j will be that the undergraduates will
, pay the same $95 as formerly, but
there will be less confusion as to what
I it is all about.
Community Fee
This "community fee" will hereafter
j be collected from graduate students,
who have hitherto been exempt, and
they will automatically become full
