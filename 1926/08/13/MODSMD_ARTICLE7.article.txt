# TUITION AND FEES TO BE EQUALIZED BY CHANGED RULE
## Graduate Student Expenses Increased to Rate Paid By Undergraduates $10 "COMMUNITY FEE" New Regulations Effective In January for Those Entering Stanford 
### 
Undergraduate students at Stanford
University will hereafter pay $85 a
quarter tuition instead of $75, as at
present, without its costing them any
more money. Graduate students will
also pay the same $85 tuition fee, but
it will take more money out of their
pockets, since they have hitherto been
charged only $50 tuition and have been
exempt from the fee collected by the
University for the support of student
enterprises and social and health
agencies.
Uniformity Sought
The change in the regulations of tui
tion fees, President Wilbur explains
in announcing the decision of the
Board of Trustees, is to secure uni
formity and avoid the confusion that
has arisen through having a variety of
fees for different kinds of students.

; Up to this tiipe undergraduates have
I paid $75 and an "incidental fee" of $20,
| which was instituted by Mrs. Stanford
j in the early years of the University.
| This fee included a variety of special
j charges, and also the $10 which the
| University collects on behalf of the
! Associated Students and other com
i mon student enterprises. The "inci
; dental fee" will be abolished through
' combination with the tuition fee, and
j the students' $10 will be known as
, the "community fee." The net result
j will be that the undergraduates will
, pay the same $95 as formerly, but
there will be less confusion as to what
I it is all about.
Community Fee
This "community fee" will hereafter
j be collected from graduate students,
who have hitherto been exempt, and
they will automatically become full
| members of the student body with all
the rights of that membership, which
up to this time they could obtain only
by individual payment of the required
l'ees. For graduate students hereafter,
(he full payment will be $95 as it has
been for undergraduates.

The new regulations go into effect
January 1, 1927, for all undergraduates
and for graduate students registering
at Stanford for the first time. The new
rules will apply to all students regis
tering in the graduate school after
September 1, 1927, whether they have
previously been students at Stanford
or not.
At the Hopkins Marine Station of
the University at Pacific Grove, the
new 585 tuition fee will replace the
present $75 fee on September 1, 1927,
but the "community fee" will not be
required there.
The fee of the Graduate School of
Business will remain unchanged at
$125 a quarter, and students in that
school will not be required to pay the
community fee.' '

Uniformity Sought
The change in the regulations of tui
tion fees, President Wilbur explains
in announcing the decision of the
Board of Trustees, is to secure uni
formity and avoid the confusion that
has arisen through having a variety of
fees for different kinds of students.

; Up to this tiipe undergraduates have
I paid $75 and an "incidental fee" of $20,
| which was instituted by Mrs. Stanford
j in the early years of the University.
| This fee included a variety of special
j charges, and also the $10 which the
| University collects on behalf of the
! Associated Students and other com
i mon student enterprises. The "inci
; dental fee" will be abolished through
' combination with the tuition fee, and
j the students' $10 will be known as
, the "community fee." The net result
j will be that the undergraduates will
, pay the same $95 as formerly, but
there will be less confusion as to what
I it is all about.
Community Fee
This "community fee" will hereafter
j be collected from graduate students,
who have hitherto been exempt, and
they will automatically become full
| members of the student body with all
the rights of that membership, which
up to this time they could obtain only
by individual payment of the required
l'ees. For graduate students hereafter,
(he full payment will be $95 as it has
been for undergraduates.

The new regulations go into effect
January 1, 1927, for all undergraduates
and for graduate students registering
at Stanford for the first time. The new
rules will apply to all students regis
tering in the graduate school after
September 1, 1927, whether they have
previously been students at Stanford
or not.
At the Hopkins Marine Station of
the University at Pacific Grove, the
new 585 tuition fee will replace the
present $75 fee on September 1, 1927,
but the "community fee" will not be
required there.
The fee of the Graduate School of
Business will remain unchanged at
$125 a quarter, and students in that
school will not be required to pay the
community fee.' '
Undergraduate students at Stanford
University will hereafter pay $85 a
quarter tuition instead of $75, as at
present, without its costing them any
more money. Graduate students will
also pay the same $85 tuition fee, but
it will take more money out of their
pockets, since they have hitherto been
charged only $50 tuition and have been
exempt from the fee collected by the
University for the support of student
enterprises and social and health
agencies.
