Stanford University is rapidly becoming a highly specialized institu
tion. It affords facilities for all sorts of research work, two branches of
which are receiving aid from the Rockefeller and Guggenheim Endow
ment funds.
The Hopkins Experimental Station at Pacific Grove for Marine Phy
siological Research has received funds for the erection of a new building
from the Rockefeller fund. This is in recognition of the value of the re
searches being carried on at the Station, and also a tribute to its location.
With the aid of the Guggenheim Endowment complete courses in aero
dynamics and aeronautic engineering will be developed. The University is
very fortunate in having a sufficiently large campus to accommodate a
flying field where actual tests in aeronautics may be made.
Largely due to Mr. Hoover's efforts, a department of food research
has been established here which is the orjly bureau of its kind in the United
States for the study of food production, trade and consumption problems.
The Ryan laboratory for high voltage tests, whose backers are headed
by the General Electric Company, is one of the best equipped electrical
experiment plants in the country.
Much attention has been attracted by the work of the Department of
Botany. We have a climate well suited for botanical work and space
enough for extensive gardens.
The Hoover War Library is already famous for its collection of ma
terials bearing on the great war. which permit research in varied fields.
The University is advancing in many branches of special study. It is
a significant fact that these are attracting attention of such people as the
directors of the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations and large elec
trical companies. The West has long needed an institution with facilities
for all sorts of research work and Stanford bids fair to become this insti
tution.
