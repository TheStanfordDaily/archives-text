"FINE MANNERS"
A pre-release showing of the new Gloria
Swanson Picture you have heard so
much about. Gloria as the slangy, viva
cious chorus girl who is put through a
course in fine manners to make her a
lady. Fun! Loads of it!
EUGENE O'BRIEN

greatest of all Swanson Productions.
Friday and Saturday, Aug. 20-21
Don't ever fool your wife! For a real
fun-fest don't fail to see Laura LaPlant

"POKER FACES"
Believe it or not, an old worn-out rug
