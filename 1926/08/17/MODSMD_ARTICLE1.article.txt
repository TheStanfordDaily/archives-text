# GUY M. WHIPPLE WILL LECTURE ON MUSICAL GENIUSES
## A 						New Method of Analyzing The Style of Eminent Players Is Topic IS MICHIGAN PROFESSOR Psychologist Will Talk on How to Train Pupils For Studying 
### 
Guy M. Whipple, professor of Ex
perimental Education at the Univer
sity of Michigan, will give two lec
tures Wednesday, August 18, at 4:15,
in the Assembly Hall, and at 8 o'clock
in the Little Theatre. His afternoon
subject is "Measuring Musical Inter
pretation: A New Method of Analyz
ing the Style of Eminent Players."
By Dr. Whipple's method, he is able
to take the style of eminent musicians
such as Paderewski and Hoffman, and
tell wherein they are characteristic,
and differ from interpretations other
artists might use in playing a given
musical composition. To illustrate,
Professor Whipple will use a Duo-Art
piano, with special rolls made in con
nection with this study, ana lantern
slides. i
In psychology, measures of individu
ality in physical and mental traits are
common, but these experiments have
opened the field for measures of artis
tic traits. The lecture is the only one
of its sort to be given in the Bay
Region, and has been made possible
through the Psychology Department of
Stanford.
Dr. Whipple will also speak at 8
o'clock in the Little Theatre, on "Ex
periments on Training Pupils to Study
Effectively." He is noted as the au
thor of the book, "How to Study." Ac
cording to Dr. Walter Richard Miles,
Professor of Experimental Psychology,
courses based on the Whipple plan
are now quite general throughout col
leges and universities in the United
States.
The course is generally required dur
ing the freshman year. In one institu
tion where the subject was an elec
tive, tabulated figures showed that
fifty per cent of the class took the
course. Of those who did, only half as
many flunked at mid-years, as those
from the raminder of the class, and
at finals, only one fifth as many. Yet
the students who took the course aver
aged slightly lower in intelligence than
those who did not.
Methods of study, note-taking, and
the preparation of papers will be dis
cussed by Dr. Whipple.
