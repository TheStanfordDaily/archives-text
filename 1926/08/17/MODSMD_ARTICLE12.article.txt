# LOCAL FACULTY MEN OFFERED MEMBERSHIP BY LONGFELLOW CLUB
## 
### 
The Tall Men's Association has
made it known that it wishes to add
the yardage of two Stanford profes
sors to its already extended member
ship. Professors Murray S. Wildman
and Harold Heath have been declared
eligible to affiliation with this associa
tion of which Benjamin J. Ostlind, of
Marshfield, Oregon, 6 feet 4 inches
tall, is president and founder.
The association is democratic, being
limited only as to length. Anyone
under six feet hasn't a chance; those
just six feet manage to squeeze in.
but seven- and eight-footers are wel
comed and looked up to.
The Tall Men's Association has
"fourteen points." Its members are
"relentlessly and internationally" op
posed not only to low awnings,
cramped theatre seats, short-tailed
shirts, short Pullman berths, small
automobiles, low tables, ceilings, and
mirrors, but also to short bathtubs,
short operating tables, short cells, and
short socks.
Members insist that it was not a
tall poet who wrote, "Man wants but
little here below, nor wants that little
long."
The association was formed a few
years ago when Mr. Ostlind returned
home from a business trip a "com
plete wreck." The only chance he had
had to stretch was when he was out
in the open air. He told his troubles
to other tall fellows and about thirty
of them joined him in forming the
original chapter of the Longfellow
Club. The association is now busily
forming Fellowship Clubs. In stating
the purpose of the association, Mr.
Ostlind said, "If it is the dead man's
due to be carefully straightened out
and arranged for the final lodging, it
might not be unreasonable for living
tall men to ask some of the same con
sideration during consciousness."
The solemn oath of membership to
this association includes, "I believe
that Christopher Columbus, the dis
coverer of this country, was seventy
four inches tall; that George Wash
ington, the father of this country, was
seventy-seven inches tall; that Abra
ham Lincoln, the saviour of this coun
try, was seventy-six inches tall.
"I, too, am modeled lengthwise and
in their physical image and hope ever
to attain their lofty purposes.
"Therefore, 1 resolve with all other
Long Fellows, that by blending of
these conditions, this country belongs
to us by right of discovery, fatherhood,
and salvation."
