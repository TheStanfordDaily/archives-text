# Memorial Church Advertising

### 
Clever advertisers have developed their art to a high degree of perfec
tion. They have used every device, motto, and emblem except the Ameri
can flag to suggest and promote the sale of their wares. The Palo Alto
Tree has long served the world of commerce and now pictures of the
Memorial Church, done in garrish colors, help to make known the
excellency of automobile tires.
The Memorial Church is the most beautiful thing we have. Its
mosaics are universally admired and we are justly proud of them.
Furthermore, the chapel was N built by Mrs. Stanford as a memorial to
her husband. It is rather sacred to us both for its beauty and for the asso
ciations which cluster about it. Is it not rather cheapening to see it por
trayed on gaudy stickers and nondescript tire covers? Apart from our
personal feelings toward the church, we fail to see the congruity between
suoli a building and commercial advertising.
Many universities prohibit the use, by outsiders for commercial pur
poses, of any name, motto, picture, or anything belonging to the university.
There is no necessity for such a drastic measure here at Stanford but it
might be well to keep some of our most cherished things out of the marts
of trade.
