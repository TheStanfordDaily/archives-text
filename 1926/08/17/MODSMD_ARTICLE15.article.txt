# New Examination Schedule Needed
## 
### 
The attempt to compress all final examinations into a period of three
days has resulted in unnecessary and unfortunate confusion.
The principal deficiency in the time schedule is the omission of a
specified time for any afternoon classes save those given at 1:05. In one
class, which occurs at 3 o'clock, there is no time at which all members of
the class can assemble without conflicting with other examinations.
A very worthy suggestion has been offered for remedying this
an fortunate situation. It is, the beginning of the final examination
period on Wednesday, August 25 .and having the period extend over four
days. If this plan were adopted 8 and 1 o'clock classes would take
examinations on Wednesday morning and afternoon respectively; 9 and
2 o'clock classes on Thursday morning and afternoon; 10 and 3 o'clock
classes on Friday; and 11 and 4 o'clock classes on Saturday. This system
would include all classes and cause no conflicts over examination hours.
