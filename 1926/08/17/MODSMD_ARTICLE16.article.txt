# Colors in the Oval
## 
### 
Visitors approaching - the University from Palm Drive find their eyes
distracted from the beauty of the Quad by the inharmonius color scheme
of the landscape gardening of the oval.
When the University abandoned the grass oval in 1924 the new
plans called for red and white blossoming shrubs, that would be attrac
tive. The clashing assortment of different shades of red in the oval
now is not.
If the shrubs are to grow together into a thick mass of foliage which
will beautify the main approach to the University, plants of a uniform
color should be set out at once. Otherwise the oval will become a
glorification of a colored mammy's aesthetic taste.
