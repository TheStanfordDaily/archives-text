# Hidden Books
## 
### 
There are times when a student needs a book from the library and
needs it badly. When a member of the faculty draws a volume from the
stacks, there is virtually no limit to the length of time he may keep it.
Students who desire the same volume have little choice but to wait until
the professor returns it, for the librarian customarily refuses to disclose
the identity of the borrower. Otherwise, a personal request to the
professor would be possible.
Frequently the professor would be very glad to let the student use
the book. Could not a slight change in the rules make this convenience
possible ?
