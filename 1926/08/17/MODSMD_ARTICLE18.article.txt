# Stanford Citizenship
## 
### 
The University has taken a wise step in including its graduate students
with the rest of the student body in payment of the community fee which
goes toward the support of student enterprises.
Before the new plan was adopted, the undergraduates were the chief
supporters of these things since the graduates had the privilege of
paying or not paying incidental fees. Only part of the Stanford citizens
were paying taxes.
