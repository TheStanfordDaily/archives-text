A DIASTER IN THREE BEAMS
WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
Marcus Maplenut has sallied forth to The
University of Palo Alto, leaving behind
Sarah Soupladle, who dwells in fear of Ed
ward Eggplant, the ice man's helper. Marcus,
now the cynosure of all eyes, is run down
by Mazola McMolar, the vampus campfire,
and taken toward Palo Alto.
Now proceed with the narrative:
BEAM II t
The chilly breezes soon revived Mar
cus, who said, straining the syllables
through his teeth, "Where are we,
kind sir? And can you tell me the
way to the University of Stanford?"
"You earthworm," vouched Mazola,
"this is Palm Drive, and you are in
my power ful car," she added with
discretion, deftly bringing the machine
to a halt. Not knowing the dangers he
was braving, Marcus jumped in beside
her. Before long they were engaged
in amicable conversation.

Meanwhile at Morey's newsstand,
Sarah Soupladle eagerly scanned the
pages of the Comical to see if Dorothy
Dix had printed an answer to her
pathetic letter. She HAD to see Mar
cus, and in between day dreams of
what villians ice-men's helpers are,
she prayed that the guiding voice of
Dorothy would reach her in time.
Fumbling, disappointed hands drop
ped the sheet, and just as she, too,
was about to fall to the pavement, the
grey Packard driven by Mazola drew
nigh. Marcus jumped from the vehicle,
wrenching his arm in the act, and
dashed to Sarah's rescue, just in time
to catch her flying elbow with his eye.
Unconscious of what else to do, he
carried her into the Block S Barber
Shop, asking the barber to cut "her
hair until further notice, for he had
seen Mazola's car circumnavigated by
a horde of ferocious bootleggers, who
recognized the car as theirs.
Scarcely had he reached the gutter,
when the bootleggers, having over
powered Miss McMolar, disappeared
in a cloud of dust. After chasing the
cloud for several blocks, Mark gave up
the pursuit, and sat down on the S.E.
traffic wart, at the intersection of
Waverley street and University ave
nue.
