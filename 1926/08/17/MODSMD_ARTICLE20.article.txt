## 
### 
The newly-completed artificial pond
on the Kingscote grounds, besides be
| ing a beautiful addition to the gar
den, has an astounding history.
A year ago, when Mrs. B. E. Howard
was in Turkey, she acquired and
brought home with her two tiles from
| the tomb of the favorite wife of the
Sultan Sulimen. These two tiles now
I overlook the pond. Sultan Sulimen was
i the only Turk to have made a mosque
all Turkish in architecture. The only
1 thing that was foreign were the win
dows designed by a Hebrew named
Abraham. The Hebrew was bribed by
the Greeks to put a Christian cross In
one of the windows. Sultan Sulimen
discovered it and had Abraham's eyes
put out. but the cross is still in the
window today.
The Kingscote pond 1b overshadowed
by trees and is accessible by little
stone paths. The architecture is Japa
nese and Italian. The bridge is of
Japanese motif, while the fountain,
and Betting of cypress, is Italian. An
Interesting additional fact is that the
pond is stocked with some of Dr. Jor
dan'* mosquito fish.
