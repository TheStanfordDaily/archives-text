# MARY YOST, DEAN OF WOMEN, ACTIVE FOR ACQUAINTANCE POLICY
## 
### 
Mary Yost, Dean of Women, is per- J
petually active in the execution of her
policy of pleasant individual contact
with the women students of the Uni
versity.
From first date of acceptance the
prospective student is placed in touch
with the Dean's office through the
agency of carefully prepared literature
dealing with the ideals and standards
which must be met by members of
the Stanford Community. The Y.W.
C.A., Womens' Athletic Association,
and Pan Hellenic information hand
books are mailed, as well as a bul
letin concerning Roble Hall and a
room application blank.
Parents Also Considered
Not only the future undergraduate,
but her parents as well, are considered
by Miss Yost. A letter dealing with
the University ideals with regard to
women and the ways in which the
parents can co-operate to attain them
is an important feature in the execu- j
tion of the Dean's policy. Throughout j
the daughter's college career a close
harmony of purpose is thus main
tained.
Entrance Problem Difficult
One of the most difficult problems
which concerns the Dean of Women is
that of acting on entrance applica
tions. This duty has assumed formida-,
ble proportions recently as it has de- i
veloped into a matter of choosing the
fortunate candidate rather than ar
riving at the desired end through
elimination. Fall quarter applicants
this year with all scholarship require
ments fulfilled number seven to one
over the places open.
On Registration Day, or as soon j
thereafter as is convenient, each new- 1
ly entering woman is asked to call on
Miss Yost for a get together inter- j
view. By consistently carrying out this
policy of acquaintance from the first,
individual contact is maintained with
each woman student in the Univer
sity.
