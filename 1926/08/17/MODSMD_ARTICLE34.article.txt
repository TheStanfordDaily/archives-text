# GEIGER GIVES VIEWS ON REVOLT OF YOUTH AS UNVERSAL FACTOR
## Man Follows Biological Law Which Governs Animals Says Philosopher 
### 
"The revolt of youth is not peculiar
to man alone, if you understand it
rightly; it is a biological fact, which
also causes young birds to fly from
their nests," says Doctor Moritz Gei
ger, visiting professor of Philosophy
from Gottingen, Germany. "Some of
the young birds are lost," he adds,
"but, on the whole, it is best that
they should all fly.
"Of course," Dr. Geiger remarks,
"before this time, when they are very
young, they take their surroundings
for granted and question nothing.
Young birds stay in their nests, and
puppies and calves remain where their
mothers leave them. But, when these
young animals reach a stage in de
velopment which will permit them to
take care of themselves, there comes
a biological urge to quit the parental
roof-tree and venture forth into the
world. It is the same with man.
Skepticism Found in Youth
"In man this natural biological urge
often gets a psychical expression that
young men feel discontented with ex
isting conditions. Usually, they cannot
understand the urge, but it is irre
sistable, nevertheless. Young working
men obey it by going into trades dif
ferent from those followed by their
fathers, or by moving to different
cities or even to new countries. Among
more highly educated people the 're
volt of youth' takes the form of skep
ticism or doubt of the value of ac
cepted social and political conven
tions.
"But later on there is a recreation,
again," Dr. Geiger points out. The
natural thing for all animals as they
grow older is to become settled in
their ways. Lower animals cling to
familiar fields; men usually settle
down, forget their doubt, and become
dogmatic again, like their parents.
That does not mean, however, that
they return entirely to the past. "This
revolt of each younger generation has
brought culture to a different stage of
development," says Doctor Geiger.
Three Types of Men
The eminent philosopher went on
to say that all men do not go through
the three stages of faithful attachment
to parents in childhood, revolt of
adolescence, and the new dogmatism
of grown-up people. Some individuals
realize only the first stage; others at
tain to the second and remain in it
all their lives. They are always in
revolt, and in politics are the men of
eternal opposition, even when their
own former views have gained the
victory. Neither of these types is the
best.
The normal man goes through all
three stages. His revolt in adolescence
makes for progress, and as he grows
older he settles down and leaves the
field clear for the new youth.
Geiger Quotes Proverb
While the revolt of adolescents
against the established order may
seem to older people a sign that they
are "going to the dogs," and while
some of them do wreck themselves in
the process of growing up, it is a fact
that in order to be of any use to the
world or to themselves, all young
people must go through this stage of
doubt and skepticism. This truth is
well expressed in the German aca
demic proverb, "Man muss Yiiunglinge
wagen damit Manner Werden" (You
have to risk adolescence that there
may be men.)
