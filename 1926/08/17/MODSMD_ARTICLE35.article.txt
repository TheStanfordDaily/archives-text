# SPRINTER WILL REGISTER
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track squad
will benefit considerably by the pres
ence of Harry Larsen, champion
"prep" school sprinter of the State of
Wisconsin. He visited the campus last
week to see about his registration.
Due to the fall quota being filled he
is applying for entrance in January
and, having a good scholastic record,
he stands more than an even chance
of being admitted.

At no time in the history of Cali
fornia has the number of women In
the state equalled the number of men,
according to statistics issued by the
state board of health.
