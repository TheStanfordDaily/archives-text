# NEW HOME BUILT FOR HUNGER STRIKE SNAKE
## 
### 
Rattlesnakes must have a balanced
diet if they are to remain in a state
of poison-producing health. This is
the discovery of members of the De
partment of Physiology who have
been conducting experiments with
venom extracted from the fangs of a
snake which heretofore has been kept
on the second floor of the Physiology
building.
The reptile has consistently refused,
while in its artificial habitat, to con
sume the foods which result in the
production of poison. It has been de
cided, therefore, to remove it, to the
botanical gardens, where surroundings
are more natural.
A spot has been prepared for the
new cage which is to house the rattler.
This is to be a double one, to protect
caretakers and observers from the
fangs of the snake.

Thanks to the kind person who cut
the low branch off of the tree in the
parking space opposite the Psychology
corner.
