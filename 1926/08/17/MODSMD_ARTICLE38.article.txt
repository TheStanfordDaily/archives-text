# STEVENSON MAY WIN NATIONAL TITLE FOR SWIMMING NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
Carl Stevenson's three victories, the
Silver Gate Swim and the mile swims
at Long Beach and Healdsburg, vir
tually make him the Pacific Coast
champion for his distance.
He has had to compete with the
best swimmers on the coast and has
found no difficulty in always pulling
a little faster than his nearest com
petitor.
Wallace O'Connor, Stanford and
Olympic Games swimmer, now a mem
ber of the Venice Plunge Club, who
won the 600-yard swim last year was
not able to lead Stevenson in this
race, as the critics had foretold, or in
the Long Beach mile.
Short distances have never been in
, the latter's favor, but it seems that he
is able to use a kind of a sprint pace
which he can keep up for half a mile.
If he can increase this distance to a
mile at the same speed he will be
well in the running for a national title.
A week from Sunday Stevenson in
tends to enter the open 220-yard swim
to be held at the Olympic Club. Later
he will enter the Pacific Coast cham
pionships, and the P.A.A. champion
ships. Also if he is able to do any
training in cold water, he will enter
the Golden Gate swim.
One trophy cup Stevenson hopes to
add to his collection is that presented
to him at Healdsburg. This magnifi
cent silver cup standing about three
and a half feet high will go to the
winner of three of the open mile swims
in the Russian river. The trophy pre
sented for the Silver Gate swim was
a tall silver cup; the perpetual trophy
is a silver plaque, bearing the annual
winner's name.
