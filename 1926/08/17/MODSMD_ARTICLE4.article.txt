# RECENT FIGURES SAY NEW STUDENTS'AGES ARE BECOMING LOWER
## Freshmen of 1924 Are Year And One-Half Younger Than Those of 1901 
### 
Figures obtained from the regis
trar's office indicate the average age
of matriculates is steadily becoming
lower. During the past quarter of a
century there has been a lowering of
approximately a year and half from
the ages of new students.
In the years 1901-1902, the average
age of matriculants was 20.10 years.
The most recent figures which have
been compiled are for the years 1924-
1925. In this year the age of entering
freshmen averaged 18.68 —a difference
of 1.42 years.
The highest age average was found
to be in the years 1910-1911, when new
students had the average age of 21.50
years. The lowest average age appears
in the years 1921-1922, when the fig
ures were 18.47. The difference be
tween high and low average ages is
1.63 years.
The lowering has been slowly going
on since 1901 but no satisfactory ex
planation of the cause of this has as
yet been offered. It has been sug
gested, however, that in former years
it was often deemed advisable to take
out a year or two between the high
school and college courses, whereas at
present the tendency appears to be to
continue without interruption. Also in
former days, many men students found
it expedient to work before coing to
college, whereas nowadays, most men
support themselves while attending
the University.
