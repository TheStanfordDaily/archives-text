# NEW HARRIS J. RYAN LABORATORY NEARLY READY FOR TRIAL RUN
## 
### 
The new Ryan High Voltage Labora
tory is now having its final installa
tions made, and the first trial run will
probably be made within two weeks'
time.
Allan B. Hendricks, an electrical en
gineer for the General Electric Com
pany, who perfected the making of
coils forhigh voltage transformers, has
been assisting Professor H. J. Ryan
in the designing of the apparatus and
the installation of the transformers.
The wiring for the switchboard 'con
trolling the various parts of the whole
is yet to be completed. This will prob
ably take about fourteen days to do,
when the first trials will be made.
Remarkable features of construction
are many in this laboratory. The doors
are the largest in the world, and meas
ure 42 by 4*5 feet, but in spite of their
great size and heavy steel construc
tion, they may be opened by one man
without the aid of a motor. All the
doors can be made light-proof when
so desired, the result being that the
interior is the largest dark room which
has ever ben constructed, its dimen
sions being 17f>x69x67 feet.
The transformers, weighing many
tons, are supported by cylinders of
shellaced paper, the sides of which
are but three-fourths of an inch thick.
These principally are the obvious and
non-technical items of interest con
cerning the building.
