# "AREN'T WE ALL?" DISTINCT SUCCESS FOR DAVIS, CAST
## 
### 
Gordon Davis and the entire cast
achieved a most striking dramatic suc
cess in "Aren't We All?" Friday eve
ning. The characters they created will
be remembered perhaps even longer
than the thoroughly good lines of the
Play.

Davis, himself, as Lord Grenham, !
was remarkably clever. His every
word and gesture was strictly in keep
ing with the character he portrayed
which actually "lived," the mature
"beau" whose life was devoted to
"agriculture and women." His lines, j
the best in the play, were brought out

j excellently and were fully appreciated
by his audience.
Grenham's son, Willie Tatham, was
! well done by Wayne Newcomb. The
juvenile lead was a difficult one and
Newcomb carried it with intelligence
! and understanding.

Honors are due Miss Sarah Marga-
J ret Burns for her vivid portrayal of
| Margot Tatham, the wronged wife,
| who, herself, perhaps lived in a "glass
house." Miss Burns played bits of
[emotional stress convincingly; she
had many opportunities to overact, of
which, happily, she did not avail her
self.
Sob Scene With No Sob
The young Australian, Willcocks,
was played by Jack McGuire. He will
be remembered for his polish, excel
lent voice and the fact that he did a
"sob scene" in the third act without
a sob. 4
Miss Elizabeth Wilbur carried off
the role of the good-natured "woman
with a purpose," Lady Mary Frinton,
unusually well.
Of course, the vicar, Rev. Ernest
| Lynton, was a travesty rather than a
real character, but Reidar Torjussen
kept in the part as written for him.
Claire Dawes, as Mrs. Lynton, was

a little polished for her role but her
scenes were well done and moved ad
mirably.
Kitty Lake, the actress and sophisti
cated English society woman, was,
unfortunately, given just a touch of
American flapperism.
