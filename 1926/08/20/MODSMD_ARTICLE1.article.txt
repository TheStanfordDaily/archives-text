# STANFORD BUILT LIKE IDEAL GARDEN CITIES SAYS LEONARD SMITH
## Fifty Thousand Should Be Population Limit Set For Model Town 
### 
Professor Leonard Smith, of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, who gave an il
lustrated lecture in the Little Theatre
Tuesday evening on "The Menace of
Great Cities and a Remedyâ€”the Gar
den City," remarked that "Stanford
is the only University in America built
from the ground up."
Plans in Advance
By this statement he meant that
Stanford is built on the same basis
as the ideal garden city. The plans
are made for years in advance, so
that it is known what the University,
or the city, is growing into. Mere
haphazard building, and "crowding to
the last ounce" is a grave danger.
The garden city should be one-third
city and two-thirds garden. Never
should the population be above 50,000.
The government would have certain
restrictions over the conditions of the
houses, rented for 999 years, and over
the large areas of vegetables and
flowers. Proper housing would be pro
vided for the working man, the "back
bone of the country." Almost an Uto
pian picture was painted of the life
in such a town.
Big City Problems
Professor Smith dwelt at length on
the problems and squalor of the great
modern industrial centers, favorably
comparing the garden city to them.
He finished his lecture by discussing
various lantern slides showing the
hideous conditions in big cities, con
trasted by* the beauty of his remedy.
