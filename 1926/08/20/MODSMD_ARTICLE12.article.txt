# INTERPRETATIONS OF PIANISTS ANALYZED IN LECTURE BY WHIPPLE
## Modern Reproducing Pianos Give All Details of the Artist's Rendition 
### 
"The differences in rendition of two
players depends entirely upon when
they play a note and how long they
hold it, how loud they play it, and
whther they use the pedal or not. All
of these things ?re recorded on the
music roll of a modern reproducing
piano," said Professor Guy M. Whip
ple, Professor of Experimental Educa
tion at the University of Michigan, in
his lecture, "Measuring Musical Inter
pretation: A New Method of Analyz
ing the Style of Eminent Players," in
the Assembly Hall, Wednesday after
noon.

"By this method," he continued,
"hard-headed scientists have reduced
the 'singing tones' and 'sparkling runs'
of great artists to mere holes in a
strip of paper."
Mr. Whipple explained that the
modern mechanical pianos have been
improved so that they can reproduce
exactly the performance of an artist.
The temporal relations of the notes,
the intensity, and the pedaling are all
controlled by perforations on the roil
and are consequently independent of
the operator of the instrument. Out
side of these three variable factors
the reproduced music must be the
same for all musicians.

i First, records of Chopin's Nocturne,
i opus 15 No. 2, made by four different
l pianists, were played, in order to show
• that differences in their interpreta
! tions could be faithfully portrayed.
! Then a few measures from Liszt's
Hungarian Rhapsody No. 10 as played
by Friedheim, and by Paderewski,
were analyzed in detail to show ex
actly wherein lay the differences in
j the style of the two pianists. Professor
Whipple pointed out, first, that the
'roll showed a difference in the in
j tensity, so he played the same meas-
I ures combining Friedheim's playing
with Paderewski's dynamics. Still the
result was different from PadereNvski's
own playing. Then the lecturer demon
strated differences in pedaling in the
same way. Lastly he showed lantern
slides of the same measures as they
appeared on the piano roll, illustrating
the different time values given to the
notes by the two musicians and point
ed out the changes these made in the
phrasing of the two measures and in
the general effects of the two inter
| pretations.
i By selecting and analyzing a selec-
I tion that is typical of a certain artist,
Professor Whipple is able to deter
mine exactly to what the player owes
his distinctive style.

"The differences in rendition of two
players depends entirely upon when
they play a note and how long they
hold it, how loud they play it, and
whther they use the pedal or not. All
of these things ?re recorded on the
music roll of a modern reproducing
piano," said Professor Guy M. Whip
ple, Professor of Experimental Educa
tion at the University of Michigan, in
his lecture, "Measuring Musical Inter
pretation: A New Method of Analyz
ing the Style of Eminent Players," in
the Assembly Hall, Wednesday after
noon.
Artistic Reproduction
"By this method," he continued,
"hard-headed scientists have reduced
the 'singing tones' and 'sparkling runs'
of great artists to mere holes in a
strip of paper."
Mr. Whipple explained that the
modern mechanical pianos have been
improved so that they can reproduce
exactly the performance of an artist.
The temporal relations of the notes,
the intensity, and the pedaling are all
controlled by perforations on the roil
and are consequently independent of
the operator of the instrument. Out
side of these three variable factors
the reproduced music must be the
same for all musicians.

Shows Slides

i First, records of Chopin's Nocturne,
i opus 15 No. 2, made by four different
l pianists, were played, in order to show
• that differences in their interpreta
! tions could be faithfully portrayed.
! Then a few measures from Liszt's
Hungarian Rhapsody No. 10 as played
by Friedheim, and by Paderewski,
were analyzed in detail to show ex
actly wherein lay the differences in
j the style of the two pianists. Professor
Whipple pointed out, first, that the
'roll showed a difference in the in
j tensity, so he played the same meas-
I ures combining Friedheim's playing
with Paderewski's dynamics. Still the
result was different from PadereNvski's
own playing. Then the lecturer demon
strated differences in pedaling in the
same way. Lastly he showed lantern
slides of the same measures as they
appeared on the piano roll, illustrating
the different time values given to the
notes by the two musicians and point
ed out the changes these made in the
phrasing of the two measures and in
the general effects of the two inter
| pretations.
