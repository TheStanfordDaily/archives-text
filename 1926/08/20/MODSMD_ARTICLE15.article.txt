The speech on "Experiments in Training Pupils to Study 'Effect
ively,' " by Guy M. Whipple, professor of experimental education at the
University of Michigan was presented at a most opportune time.
We, who have reached a stage beyond "pupils" and who have reached
that period of the quarter when we MUST "study effectively" if we
are to pursue our studies further, are resolving to do three months' work
within a week. We must purchase textbooks; fight at the library for
volumes in demand by many of our fellows; and lal>or far into the night,
cramming for examinations.
We will probably be so burdened with toil that we will vow never
again to get behind in our studies and let them mount up and overwhelm
us, but we will forget that we have made similar resolves in the past and
will probably make them at the close of each succeeding quarter.
Human nature asserts itself even in what Leacock calls the "educa
tional steeplechase." University students do learn but they prefer to
acquire knowledge in their own peculiar ways, which are often highly
inefficient, but have the advantage of not being systematized.
