# Arrows
## 
### 
There is a too-much-quoted couplet regarding a gentleman who shot
an arrow into the air and who remained in ignorance of the spot at which
the arrow returned to earth. The editorial arrows of the summer edition
of The Daily Palo Alto may not have scored direct hits, but they have at
least directed attention to the sources of those things toward which they
have been aimed.
Three main editorial attempts have been made this summer. The first
was toward uncovering the reasons for the deplorable condition of the
bridge and adjacent stretch of the county road. The responsibility has
l>een shown to rest upon the board of supervisors of San Mateo county.
Our* second attack was upon the "telephone service" which is alleged to
exist in the men's dormitories. The situation was disclosed and a remedy
was suggested. Our most recent campaign for the revision of the exami
nation schedule has met with success..
The burden for securing action upon the road and telephone situation
rests upon the shoulders of those concerned.
