# To Our Athletes
## 
### 
During the Summer (Quarter at Stanford there is relatively little
participation in athletics, and yet many Stanford men are out on the
sport fields in these few months.
Here and there in the news columns one sees mention of Stanford
athletes who have played their respective games with varying results.
These reports come not only from all parts of America hut from the
world over.
Recently our athletes have been consistent winners or near winners;
hut victory is hy no means the most important end. Everywhere, these
men. who play in such a sporting way and hehave in such a gentlemanly
manner, give an excellent impression of the University they represent.
Therefore we should do more than congratulate them; we should
thank them.
