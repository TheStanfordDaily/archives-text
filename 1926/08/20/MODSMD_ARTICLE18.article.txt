# Au Revoir
## 
### 
Now comes the time for the conventional farewell but it is with regret
that we bid adieu. The staff of The Daily Palo Alto hopes that your
pleasure in reading this paper has been as great as ours in the composition
of it. We have tried to present the news, to interest and amuse our read
ers. We have, at least, succeeded in enjoying our own part in this enter
prise.
Soon will come the day when many of us will leave. Some of us will
begin to.earn our livelihoods, some will spend the month relaxing in an
ticipation of return to college, and some will remain hen?. We hope that
you may keep with you after this quarter has concluded, memories of a
pleasant summer. And we wish you unbound success and happiness.
