A Diaster in Three Beams

Mazola McMolar, a dashing Amazon
with possibilities after dark, is our
campfire, and is affected by Marcus
Maplenut, a daring brunette of 4 feet
10 inches, our hero who registers him
self enamoured of Sarah Soupladle, a
milkmaid of the first water, who is our
faire ladye, and who walks in fear of
Edward Eggplant, an iceman who is
our hissing snake.
Continue with present plans:
BEAM 111
Realizing that Sarah had been
shaven and shorn for the last three
days, Marcus Maplenut yumped up
from the traffic wart and tore back to
the Block S Barbershop, where he
found a barber, obviously from the
Barbery Coast, still working on Sarah.
"And I'll have at thee in a moment,
for a shave, sir?" ventured the ton
sorial artist.
"Stay thy hand," quoth Mark, at
the same time trying to recall where
he had heard that voice before. "Ah,
ha! Edward Eggplant, I know you
now, you sleepless-enemy of peace, it's
a disguised shaver" you grow up to be,
maybe, eh?"
(Smack)
They fought long and ferociously.
Then the noon whistle blew and they
quit for lunch. Sharply at one they
resumed, but Mark during the inter
vening hour had looked up his boxing
syllabus, and hurled Edward for the
count.
As Edward trailed through the air
he gurgled, "You dog-faced villain!"
"How now, you wasp without a
sting?" countered Mark, never at a
loss in his repertoire, "Castor Oil, old
bean!"
So saying, he seized Sarah in one
hand, and a bottle of hair restorer in
the other, and dashed madly out in
search of our missing link. As he
dashed he applied the herpicide (not
an adv.) to Sarah's head. With a hop,
skip, and a yump he gloamed the P. A.
Intersuburban electric car, and wrang
led out to the Campus.
When he arrived at the cactus gar
dens with Sarah he was startled by a
gurgle, or perhaps it was a bat, and
looking into the thickets growth of
the desert vegeation he saw —Mazola
sitting on the heads of the five boot
leggers! !!
"Throw that blonde goddess to the
four winds," she yoicked,* "I will
marry you."
"You said it, Mazola, you said it,"
retorted our hero. At those envenomed
words, the pent-up woman in Sarah
burst into all its fury. After some am
biguous handings out, not loud enough
to be boisterous but resonant enough
to be understood above the uproar,
she fell into a paroxysm of unbridled
rigididity. So Sarah died with the
boots on, so what t'ell, Ed, what fell.
That evening the lovers left for
Half Moon Bay and plighted their
troth, under the constellation of Scor
pio.
And as they returned a little dog by
the wayside laughed to see such sport,
as the cow jumped over the moon.

meaning to shriek, scream, or cry out.
