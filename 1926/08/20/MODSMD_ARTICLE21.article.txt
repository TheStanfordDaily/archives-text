# EFFECTIVE HABITS OF STUDY CAN BE MADE SAYS G. M. WHIPPLE
## 
### 
In a lecture primarily of interest to
high school teachers, given in the
Little Theatre last Wednesday eve
ning, Guy M. Whipple, Professor of
Experimental Education in the Uni
versity of Michigan, brought out the
fact that exercises subsidiary to the
theoretical knowledge of how to study
effectively are necessary in order to
get the best results with students.
The question has been asked, said
Professor Whipple, if studying how
to study is of any avail, since good
students concentrate and do not waste
time anyway, and poor students will
not do these things, even if they are
showed how. His conclusion is that
the rules formed into habits help the
good and the poor students somewhat,
and are a great help to the average
student .
Professor Whipple, who spoke with
unusual charm and humor, described
his efforts to get improved methods of
study into the schools. It is not
enough to merely have the schools,
and convinced his audience that it is
not enough to merely have the pupils
learn certain rules regarding scien
tific methods of study, but they must
put those rules into practice.
He told in detail how an experiment
•was carried on in a small Michigan
high school, using an experimental
group and a control group. The control
group developed an insurrection be
cause it felt that it was being treated
unfairly and either bought or borrowed
copies of Doctor Whipple's book, "How
to Study Effectively," and studied it.
The principal of the school was forced
to beg them not to learn how to study
effectively, in order to effect the ex
periment.
In this and in other experiments the
pupils gave valuable suggestions that
had not occurred to the teachers as
means of making study more effective,
and there was rapid and obvious im
provement in spelling and reading.
Certain achievement tests were given
which proved that a remarkable im
provement had been made during the
course of the experiment.
