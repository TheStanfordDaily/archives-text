# BOYS OF COMMUNITY TAUGHT TO SWIM AT STANFORD GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
The ole swimmin' hole that meant
so much to the childhood days of our
fathers has been made a reality for
the children of the Stanford com
munity. Clothes may no longer be
hung on a "No Swimming Allowed"
sign, and white tiles may have re
placed the uneven, rocky bottom, and
muddy bank, but swimming is taught
by a competent instructor instead of
cruel experience and numberless duck
ings.
Three mornings each week during
summer months, twenty-five boys
between the ages of eight and fifteen,
have gathered at the completely
equipped swimming tank in
Gymnasium and, under the careful
supervision of C. W. Davis, director of
Intramural Sports, work, play, and are
scientifically taught to swim and dive.
Now, after two months, eleven boys—
none of whom had previously been
able to swim—have passed the Red
Cross Beginner's Test. Out of all the
boys registered this summer, only two
have not learned to swim. Both are
only eight years old.

The system of teaching the boys to
swim is scientifically arranged, com
mencing with elementary exercises to
overcome fear, and finally advancing
to the introduction of the competitive
idea as an incentive for greater skill
and better performance. This morning
at 0 o'clock an exhibition will be given
which may be attended by parents and
others interested in the project. There
will be both swimming and diving
events. The races include: one width
of the tank for beginners, and two
races each one length of the tank, one
for boys of from ten to twelve years,
and one for boys over twelve; various
diving contests; and finally, a relay
and a medley relay to wind up the
program. In the medley relay each
boy in his turn swimu with a different
stroke, such as the breast stroke, the
back stroke, and the crawl.
The boys' swimming class was
founded at Stanford over seventeen
years ago, and since that time has
served to teach countless numbers of
boys to swim in good form. Harry W.
Maloney, now Director of Minor Sports
at Stanford, was one of the originators
of the class.
