# REVEREND BIG CHIEF WHITE HORSE EAGLE HAS WEIRD HISTORY
## 
### 
The Reverend Big Chief White
Horse Eagle, dressed in full war re
galia, visited the campus Tuesday.
While referring to himself, the Chief
mentioned that he is the world's most
famous lecturer and advisor on Indian
lore; the "Rosetta Stone of America"
on Indian and Egyptian paintings.
His autographed photographs, he
said, might be obtained from his secre
tary for the nominal price of one dol
lar.
In his palaver to a breathless audi
ence in the Memorial Court, the fol
lowing facts were revealed:
He will be 105 his next birthday.
A "Chief of Chiefs," he was born on
Black Rock two hundred feet above
the earth's surface, in South Dakota,
in January of 1822.
He was graduated from Yale in 1871,
and has been a Presbyterian minister
for 85 years.
He is the major of the four great
chiefs now living, who are known in
Oklahoma as the "Big Four." He has
smoked the pipe of peace with every
president from Lincoln to Coolidge.
At present his income is in the
neighborhood of $16,000 a day.
He is touring the country, accom
panied by his secretary, a sombreroed
lady with a beaded band about her
brow.
The Reverend Horse Eagle is on his
way to Philadelphia, where he will
present a series of Indian dances in
which a thousand of his braves will
participate.
