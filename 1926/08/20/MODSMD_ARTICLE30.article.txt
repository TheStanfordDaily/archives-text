# IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE IN UNION STORE
## 
### 
Installation of an entirely new back
bar which will provide for the enclos
ing of all food under glass is the most
important feature of the annual recon
ditioning in September of the Union
Store, according to W. P.. Gunther,
manager.
Additional counter room, more
shakers, enlarged toasting facilities,
and the general improvement of the
fountain, along with revarnishing and
repainting the interior of the store
constitute the program of getting
ready for fall business.
"The present Rough's Roost with
its armless rocking chairs and other
damage wrought by the students will
be a changed place when they return,"
says Gunther.
General improvements will also be
made in the Encina store, but no defi
nite plans have as yet been deter
mined.
The Union Store will be open dur
ing the month of; September with the
exception of a few days when paint
will be allowed to dry.
