# WILD LOCAL DENIZEN SIGHTED BY STUDENT
## 
### 
Wild life on the campus is not ex
tinct. Last week a student who was
strolling near Sequoia Hall was star
tled to see a frightened oppossum
scampering into the foliage near the
residence of Dr. Jordan. The positive
identificatio nof this animal was made
possible as it had been captured in
the latter days of the spring quarter
by John W. Gillespie, a graduate stu
dent in Botany, who had seized it as
it was prowling in the vicinity of the
Bookstore. Gillespie made a cage for
the prisoner by utilizing two waste
baskets and kept it on observation for
some days until compassion forced
him to return it to its beloved haunts
near the Quad.
