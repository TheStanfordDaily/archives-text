# SUMMER THEATRICAL SEASON SHOWS GAIN, REGISTERS SUCCESSES
## "Hamlet," "Hay Fever," and "Aren't We All?" Hailed As Dramatic Winners 
### 
Stanford's brilliant summer theatri
cal season ended on Friday night,
showing a substantial profit. This is
the first time summer dramatics have
been financially successful, but equally
interesting is the campus theatre's
repertoire.
"Hamlet," presented in modern
dress, the first play of the season,
was a daring and successful work, a
great credit to its cast and director,
I Gordon Davis. The criticisms of it are
I no higher in number or acidity than
| may be heard of the more noted
j Shakespearian companies, because
I nearly everyone seems to have his own
i conception of the character of Hamlet.
In speaking of the play, Charles G.
Norris remarked that its campus ren
dition was as well done as any he has
1 seen by professionals.
"Hamlet"
Lester Vail (Les Seib) is to be re-
J membered, not only for his surpassing
1 work in the role of Hamlet, but also
! becaijse he returned and placed his
| talent at the disposal of his Univer
; sity. He is now rehearsing a play to be
' presented this fall on Broadway under
j the direction of Thos. Hopkins.
"Hay Fever," the second play, was
as enjoyable a piece of glorified "slap
stick" as any presented before a cam
! pus audience. The cast was well cho
sen and the players both understood
and developed their parts in masterly
fashion. A new type of acting was
brought forth in the characterization
j of Jackie*Coryton by Miss Enid "Wa.ll.
She made Jackie a ludicrously unso
phisticated ingenue, quite refreshing
I after the traditional stage flapper.
"Aren't We Ail?"
The best comedy of the season was
I unquestionably "Aren't We All?" the
last play. Gordon Davis distinguished
I himself as Lord Grenham and Miss
Sarah Margaret Burns made an en
i viable reputation in her portrayal of
Margot Tatham. There is something of
the professional actress in her work
and undoubtedly she will star in fu
' tura productions.
"Hay Fever" and "Aren't We All?"
will be the first productions in Fall
| Quarter. They should be even more
highly polished then than they were
j this summer.
