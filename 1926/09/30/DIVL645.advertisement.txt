At 4:10 P. M. yesterday I took off in
y my Yackey plane from Checkerboard
/field. When I reached an altitude of
3000 feet I leaned over the side and
/ dropped a Parker Over-size Duofold
✓ Pen. A few minutes later I made a
/' landing near my starting point, and a
crowd was examining the same Parker
/ Duofold pen, which had landed on
ii hard ground. To my great surprise,
' the pen had not been damaged in the
/ slightest by its 3000 feet drop.
/ Signed with the Parker that
/ dropped 3000 feet.
