# HONOR PLEDGE NOW ASKED OF ALL STUDENTS
## Plan Recommended Last Spring After Council's Investigation SIGN AT REGISTRATION "Not Knowing" No Excuse Says President Wilbur Of Suggestion 
### 
All students registering this quarter
-will be required to sign an honor sys
tem pledge which is included in the
Matriculation Book. After this quarter
every new student must sign the
pledge when making application for
admission.
The pledge reads as follows: "I
agree to live up to the letter and spirit
of the student honor system by hon
esty in all my personal conduct and
by neither giving nor receiving un
permitted aid in examinations, class
-exercises, reports, or any other work
that is to be used by the instructor as
a basis of grading.
"If I violate this pledge, I agree to
withdraw from the University."
Last spring this pledge was worked
out by the Men's and Women's Coun
cils. Stanley A. Weigel states that
""after considerable investigation we
decided some sort of a pledge would
be the best way to let every student
realize what the honor system is. The
general impression seemed to be that
cheating in examinations was the only
violation, so we felt that all students
should read and sign some pledge stat
ing the exact scope of the system."
President Wilbur, when approached
on the subject, stated that "The Men's
and Women's Councils left the pledge
with the administration this spring,
and during the summer it was decided
to put it into the Matriculation Book
so that every student would have the
■opportunity of understanding the
bonor system. We believe it will do
away with prolonged Men's Council
trials because the student will have no
opportunity of defending himself on
the score of 'not knowing'."
In explanation the Matriculation
Book has a paragraph in regard to the
pledge, which reads: "The very first
qualification expected of Stanford men
and women consists in those attributes
of sound character essential to good
citizenship. Honesty in academic work
and personal conduct is taken as a
matter of course. The University has
manifested this confidence in the in
tegrity of its students by placing the
responsibility for these matters en
tirely in their own hands under the
Stanford honor system. In keeping
with this duty and as a means of more
•effectively carrying it out, Stanford
students require of each other the
following pledge which is intended to
explain the essential elements of the
"honor system and to provide for self
•elimination of unworthy students."
