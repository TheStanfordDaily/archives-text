# â€˜EXTRAS' INCREASE GRADUATE STUDENT REGISTRATION FEE
## $11 RAISE IS IN EFFECT Further Addition in January To Make Tuition Same As Undergraduates 
### 
Graduate students beginning this
quarter will pay a $10 "community
fee" and $1 pavilion fee in addition to
their regular fee of $50 as a result of
a number of changes made in the col
lection of fees for tuition and inci
dentals by President Wilbur and the
Board of Trustees. This will apply to
graduate students in all schools, ex
cepting that in the School of Business,
the existing $125 charge has been re
duced to $115 in order that the present
fee will not increase.
Graduate students will pay exactly
the same tuition and incidental fee as
undergraduates after next January.
Undergraduates will pay an $85 in
stead of a $75 tuition fee as hereto
fore, but the $20 "incidental fee" has
been abolished by combining most of
its items with the tuition fee. The re
maining $10 will be known as the
"community fee." This will tend to
abolish the confusion that has existed
in regard to the division of the quar
terly fee, although the actual payment
will be the same.
Graduate students will automatic
ally become full members of the stu
dent body with all privileges which
were obtained before only by special
payment of the A.S.S.U. fees. This will
hold good after January 1, 1927, and
applies to all.
At the Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University at Pacific Grove
the iipw $85 tuition will take the place
of the former $75 charge after Sep
tember 1, 1927, but the "community
fee" will not be required there.
The $125 per quarter tuition charge
of the Graduate School of Business
will remain unchanged and students
there will not be required to pay the
"community fee."
