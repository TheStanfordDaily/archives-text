# UNIVERSITY PROPOSES TO CARRY ON WORK OF LUTHER BURBANK
## Sebastopol Farm to Be Sold To Stanford if Plans Are Followed 
### 
Stanford University proposes, if a
sufficient endowment is raised, to or
ganize the Luther Burbank Founda
tion to continue the work of the emi
nent experimenter on his properties at
Sebastopol and Santa Rosa. To carry
on this work upon the broad scientific
principles suited to the task and on i
the basis laid by Mr. Burbank will
require approximately a million dol
lars.
In undertaking this work the Uni
versity will be carrying out the wish i
of Mr. Burbank expressed before his
death, that Stanford take up and carry
on his plant studies, and Mrs. Bur
bank has already expressed her inten
tion of contributing to the Founda
tion in her late husband's memory, by
turning over the Sebastopol farm at a
price which will in effect constitute
a gift of $50,000 to the Foundation.
Speaking of the proposal, President;
Wilbur said:
"Before his death Luther Burbank
said that he wanted Stanford Univer- i
sity to carry on his studies of plant
life. His service over a period of years
contributed immeasurably to the wel- i
fare of mankind. On his Sebastopol I
farm and in his gardens at Santa
Rosa there are thousands of orchard
seedlings, berries, nuts, vegetables,
cereals, and ornamental plants, as well
as many plants introduced from other
countries. At the time of his death
thousands of experiments were going
forward.
"It is of unique importance that
these experiments, some of them rep
resenting years of labor, be carried
! forward. The whole safety of the hu
i man race depends upon plant life. The
control of plant life has given man his
civilization. The future of man de
pends upon studies of all sorts con
cerning plants. The proper use of
' various soils in various climates de
j pends upon our control of plants. The
| conquest of the desert depends upon
study of plants as well as upon the
development of water. Our history is
full of revolutionary achievements in
this field.
"Mr. Burbank remade the plum in
dustry in California. The development
of long-fibred cotton has changed the
! whole tire problem for automobiles.
New forms of wheat that are resistant
to cold and drought have opened up a
new empire in western Canada. Raw
materials and food supplies of all sorts
have become the chief concerns of
modern nations.
"Stanford University proposes, if
adequate assistance is given it, to or
! ganize the Luther Burbank Founda
tion upon broad scientific principles in
order to further the knowledge of
plant life, and more especially to work
upon the breeding, testing, and accli
matization of useful plants.
"With the unique collections avail
able and with the favorable conditions
i offered by California, the Luther Bur
bank Foundation should take a lead
ing position in science and in the ser
' vice of man."
