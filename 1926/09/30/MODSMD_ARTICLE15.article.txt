# EARLY SEASON FORM SHOWS CARD STRENGTH
## Fullback and Quarterback Positions Causing Most Difficulty 47 MEN ON MAIN SQUAD Warner Well Satisfied With Development of Squad; Predicts Upsets 
### Jim Adams 
There is every indication greeting
returning students that the 1926 Stan
ford football team will be a good team
but the conception of what the term
good implies varies with one's optim
ism. Glimpses of power in the Red
machine were shown in the double
header Saturday in which the Cards
won a 44-7 victory from the Fresno
State Teachers College and took a 13-7
win from a fighting eleven from Caltec
but it was evident that all the parts
in this machine were not yet assem
bled. The game with Occidental Col
lege Saturday will not only bring out
the degree of development that the
team has made but will furnish a
means of comparing the Cards with
the conference favorites, U.S.C., when
Oxy tackles the latter squad two
weeks later.
Coach "Pop" Warner has his biggest
task in developing a fullback and a
quarterback. For all the other posi
tions there is good material to fit in.
A "Never-less" backfield means that
"Pop" must find a capable punter, an
accurate passer, to say nothing of the
other great qualities that last year's
captain possessed. The signal calling
position should be easier to fill.
Warner Satisfied
Giving this problem due considera
tion, "Pop" reluctantly admits that he
will have a good team but hastens to
add that with the high standard of
competition which prevails in the con
ference football race this year it will
be a "miracle" if Stanford goes
through the season without a few up
sets. "I am well satisfied with the de
velopment of the team and believe wo
are further along than we were a year
ago," Warner stated.
Notwithstanding the somewhat con
[ servative attitude of Coach Warner
there is a feeling among Stanford sup
porters that if the Cards are good
: enough to topple over the Trojans
| again this year they can about handle
any other team on the schedule. Foot
ball critics have picked the Trojans as
the favorites for the conference title,
! with Stanford as the greatest threat to
their ambitions. There are few who
| will narrow the race down to these
two, most of them including Califor
nia, Washington, and Oregon Aggies
: as other leading contenders.
I The Stanford squad has been busy
morning and afternoon since Septem
i ber 15 absorbing as much football as
possible from "Pop" and his assist
-1 ants, Tiny Thornhill and "Chuck"
Winterburn. Mornings have been de
! voted to kicking, passing, dummy
work, and other fundamental drill,
! while in the afternoon signal drill and
an occasional scrimmage finished the
day. From the turnout of eighty-five j
men Warner recently cut his squad to
forty-seven, with indications that it j
would be further reduced in a short
while. For the last week the varsity |
has been working behind closed gates ■
and will probably continue to do so.
No First String
Warner has not picked a first string i
and has been shifting his men around
in so many various combinations that
the first eleven in the end will scarce
ly coincide with anyone's wildest !
guess. Walker has moved back from
end to the fullback berth which posi
tion he held perhaps more than the ,
other candidates .until Biff Hoffman
carried the ball 22 times for a total
of 124 yards in the double-header Sat
urday and consequently brought him
self in for serious consideration as the
man to fill Nevers' place.
Another surprise shift was that of
Eli Post from guard to quarter where
he seems to be about on even terms
with Hank Millage for the signal call
ing berth. Price was moved from cen
ter out to end but Harder seems to i
have the call over the other aspirants
for Walker's one-time position. Shifts
of Bogue from half to full, of Fleish
acker from guard to full, of Young
from full to quarter have also fur- j
nished a few mild surprises.
The left side of the line with Ship- j
key, Poulson, and Captain Swan have
the best claims for permanency of!
position. McCreery at center and Ro
besky at right guard also look like
permanent fixtures. There is a wealth
of material in the tackle department
and, besides Harris and Freeman,
"Pop" has Artman and Sellman mak
ing strong bids to get in the line-up.
Halfbacks a Problem
Just what half-back combination
Warner will select for his first eleven 1
is also a matter of conjecture. Last j
year Murphy and Bogue played to
gether while Hill and Hyland were 1
running mates. In addition to these
two pairs "Pop" has another capable
combination in Wilton and Sims from
last year's freshman team. It is prob
abl ethat Warner will shift his backs
frequently to meet various types of
play both on offense and defense.
A good many close followers of the \
Card eleven believe that Warner isn't j
through shifting his men yet and so
it will be interesting to watch changes
he may make in Saturday's game with
Occidental.
What might be termed the third
string eleven scrimmaged with Husky !
Hunt's freshmen last night while the
so-called first and second teams en
gaged in signal practice.
The personnel of the squad is as

follows: ends —Shipkey, Harder, Vin
centi, Davidson, Worden, Preston,
Price, Greisser; halfbacks —Murphy,
Hyland, Hill, Sims, Wilton, Work,
Leistner, Gartliwaite, Trombetta,
Graves; centers —McCreery, Graham,
Natcher, Vermilya; guards—Captain
Swan, Robesky, Symonds, Kazanjian,
Sholes, Doyle, Seraphim Post; tackles
—Poulson, Harris, Freeman, Artman,
Moomaw, Everett, Gifford, Sellman;
fullbacks —Walker, Patchett, Hoffman,
Joseph, Fleisliacker; quarterbacks —
Eli Post, Millage, Lewis, Young.
