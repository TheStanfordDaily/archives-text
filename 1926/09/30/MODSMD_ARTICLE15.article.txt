# EARLY SEASON FORM SHOWS CARD STRENGTH
## Fullback and Quarterback Positions Causing Most Difficulty 47 MEN ON MAIN SQUAD Warner Well Satisfied With Development of Squad; Predicts Upsets 
### Jim Adams 
There is every indication greeting
returning students that the 1926 Stan
ford football team will be a good team
but the conception of what the term
good implies varies with one's optim
ism. Glimpses of power in the Red
machine were shown in the double
header Saturday in which the Cards
won a 44-7 victory from the Fresno
State Teachers College and took a 13-7
win from a fighting eleven from Caltec
but it was evident that all the parts
in this machine were not yet assem
bled. The game with Occidental Col
lege Saturday will not only bring out
the degree of development that the
team has made but will furnish a
means of comparing the Cards with
the conference favorites, U.S.C., when
Oxy tackles the latter squad two
weeks later.
Coach "Pop" Warner has his biggest
task in developing a fullback and a
quarterback. For all the other posi
tions there is good material to fit in.
A "Never-less" backfield means that
"Pop" must find a capable punter, an
accurate passer, to say nothing of the
other great qualities that last year's
captain possessed. The signal calling
position should be easier to fill.
Warner Satisfied
Giving this problem due considera
tion, "Pop" reluctantly admits that he
will have a good team but hastens to
add that with the high standard of
competition which prevails in the con
ference football race this year it will
be a "miracle" if Stanford goes
through the season without a few up
sets. "I am well satisfied with the de
velopment of the team and believe wo
are further along than we were a year
ago," Warner stated.
Notwithstanding the somewhat con
[ servative attitude of Coach Warner
there is a feeling among Stanford sup
porters that if the Cards are good
: enough to topple over the Trojans
| again this year they can about handle
any other team on the schedule. Foot
ball critics have picked the Trojans as
the favorites for the conference title,
! with Stanford as the greatest threat to
their ambitions. There are few who
| will narrow the race down to these
two, most of them including Califor
nia, Washington, and Oregon Aggies
: as other leading contenders.
I The Stanford squad has been busy
morning and afternoon since Septem
i ber 15 absorbing as much football as
possible from "Pop" and his assist
-1 ants, Tiny Thornhill and "Chuck"
Winterburn. Mornings have been de
! voted to kicking, passing, dummy
work, and other fundamental drill,

an occasional scrimmage finished the
