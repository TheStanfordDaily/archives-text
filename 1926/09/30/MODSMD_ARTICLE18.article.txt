# Pledging Your Honor
## 
### 
Today and tomorrow every student registering in the University must
sign a pledge agreeing to live up to the letter and spirit of the Honor
System. The final statement in the blank reads: "If 1 violate this pledge,
1 agree to withdraw from the University."
Signing pledges as a rule is a very annoying practice but in this case
the student should not be misled. The real significance of this pledge is
that the person of the attached signature acknowledges a specific under
standing of just what constitutes the Honor System. An acknowledgment
of this kind from the student takes considerable burden from the shoul
ders of the student councils.
In past years freshmen have had the details of the system explained
to them through various means, but even then, many have been left in
ignorance. Many are under the false impression that the honor system
applies only to cheating in examinations, but according to the letter and
spirit of the plan—giving or receiving aid, on any work which is used by
the professor as a basis of grading, constitutes a violation.
When the uninformed student is brought before the council, that body
is hesitant in passing severe judgment. Utit in the future every student
will have made a signed acknowledgment indicating an understanding of
just what the honor system is. This pledge can be produced. Thus, the
council puts the matter up to the individual and rids itself of an unjust
burden. This in itself will be an excellent character developer.
