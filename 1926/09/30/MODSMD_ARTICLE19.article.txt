# New Staff Executives
## 
### 
The first issue of The Stanford Daily sees a new set of executives
in charge of publication, a group composed of staff members whose work
in the past years has been of such caliber as to merit promotion.
Work done by Aileen Brown has always been marked by industry and
sincerity. This term, as Women's Editor, she will have complete charge
of the women's staff, and will be responsible for its organization and the
work it accomplishes. She is the outstanding woman on the staff and is
excellently prepared for the position both on a basis of experience and of
ability.
Wilbur Adams assumes the position of Managing Editor. Two years'
experience on the staff as reporter and executive has given him a good
working knowledge of the Daily, and should assure his ability to manage
the paper. He leaves his position of Sports Editor to assume his new
role.
Dudley Ross has served the Daily faithfully in all departments and
now steps from the rank of desk editor to become an Associate Editor.
His thorough knowledge of gathering and handling the news gives all the
advantages and qualifications necessary to handle the news force.
By combining the knowledge obtained from three years' work and as
a writer, organizer, and director, Alfred Post should prove an excellent
man for handling the mechanical end of the paper. He today takes over
his duties as an Associate Editor which finds him responsible for the
make-up and appearance of the paper.
Three of last year's top-ranking reporters today find themselves night
editors. These men, Frank Baker, Herbert Klein, and Francis Mosher,
have done particularly good work and merit their promotions.
