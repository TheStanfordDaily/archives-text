# Good Morning, Folks!
## 
### 
For the first time your daily newspaper greets you early in the morn
ing. You may take him to breakfast.
The Daily Palo Alto is gone forever. The "Dippy," as it was fondly
nicknamed by those who knew it, passed away at the end of last quarter,
never to be with us again.
Five minutes past two this morning The Stanford DaiCy was born
to take the place of the deceased. In this age, new methods and modern
conveniences are necessitating the replacement of old systems. In keeping
with this the Daily showed improvement a year ago when it increased
from a six- to a seven-column paper, and the change to a morning paper
leads off the improvements of this year.
But the old must pass to make room for the new, and while there is
a tear in the eyes of those who loved the Daily Palo Alto, there is a
smile on their faces as they welcome Tiie Stanford Daily.
The Stanford Daily weighed eight pages at birth, and last-minute
reports indicate that the paper is doing well in its home, which has been
remodeled during the summer in anticipation of this great event.
