# THE BULL SESSION

### 
WE MAKE A DEBUT
At the top of this column appears a
name familiar to all Stanford students,
but unfamiliar to the readers as the
cognomen for the said column. We
expect to remedy this situation as soon
as possible by decorating this name
with a very cagey little illustration
which we have planned with that fer
tile mind of ours.
The name "Bull Session" suggests
the nature of the material with which
we expect this column to be filled. In
other words, we expect to bring to
light here all of those interesting and
oftentimes entertaining things that
are said in Roble after the lights go,
off, those really worthwhile remarks
that make up the conversation of any
number of pajama-clad groups that
congregate on the campus every night.
In other words, this column is to be
come what someone else won a five
hundred-dollar pri7e for labeling the
"sophomoric salon."
To quote that go-getting advertising
fellow, "Watch this space!"

HOKUM IN LIMBO
Observed today the first freshman
of Fall wearing a dink, and it started
a train of thought, to-wit:
That it must be a source of genuine
disappointment to a freshman, versed
(as all freshmen are versed) in the
J»
college literature of the last decade,
to find, upon entering Stanford, that he
is not to be maltreated, and further
more that he is not going to be forced
to wear a ludicrous hat, nor be sub

jected to the discomfort of nocturnal
cold baths.
When we think back upon the
period immediately preceding our
entry into college, it is with difficulty
that we remember talking or thinking
of any phase of college life saving
only that sophomoric and romantic
hokum in which paddles and tubs
played such a predominating part.
From the outside, Stanford, and all
other universities today, present rela
tively the same appearance that they
always presented. This condition is
attributable to the fact that, from the
outside, impressions of universities
are gained largely through the distort
ing medium" of discredited novels and
so-called college "humor" magazines.
Thus, the freshman comes to Stanford,
in too many cases primed with an
impression of college which owes its
origin to the effort of a second-rate
novelist to describe a college in such
a fashion that an unimaginative editor
would buy his yarn.
Thus we have freshmen who wear
dinks, freshmen who decorate their
rooms with pennants. They will quit
doing this, of course, in a few weeks —
just as soon, in fact, as the class of
1930 learns what it is all about. That
the freshmen will neglect the more
artificial of Stanford's traditions is a
foregone conclusion. No one should
weep about it. It is a perfectly natural
circumstance, and is characteristic
tendency developed by all college men
in recent years, a healthy tendency to
devote less time and thought to ho
i kum.
