# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## SUGGESTS PICTORIAL SYMBOL FOR STANFORD 
### 
Editor, Sir:
Every year at this time Cartoonist Jack
Lustig of the Examiner gets restive and
surly. With the best heart in the world,
he just can't represent Stanford ade
quately in a football cartoon, because
Stanford has no symbol that works up
into a snappy drawing. Since Lustig and
I share the same office, this becomes of
direct personal concern to myself, and I
am strongly of the opinion that Stanford
ought to adopt a good pictorial symbol.
Washington has its "Huskies," Cali
fornia its "Bear," U.S.C. its "Trojan"
(not so good), and so on. They call Stan
ford the "Cardinals," and you can't car
toon that; they call them the "Cards,4*
and playing-cards (while doubtless not
unknown on the Farm) do not work into
good cartoons. The result is a certain loss
of effective publicity.
At times Stanford has been called the
"Red-Shirts," and on this I respectfully
base a suggestion. The original red-shirt
was the pioneer California miner of the
days of '49. Senator Stanford was a pio
neer and at one time a red-shirt him
self. Stanford University is the direct
product of the pioneer era of California
—the pioneer mining days that led to the
pioneer transcontinental railroad, the pio
neer millionaires that came out of that
railroad, the pioneer educators who de
veloped modern technological education
in mining and engineering particularly.
That name, "Pioneers," reeks of Califor
nia and the West; it fits a headline, it
can be cartooned, it lends itself to bleach
er stunts, it ties in with the redwood
which is Stanford's seal and with the
museum which is better known than
many Stanford men realize; and besides
all that, there's something about the name
that fits the Stanford character and the
Stanford spirit. It seems straneg to me
that, although that good red-shirted name
has been lying around for years, no West
ern college has grabbed it yet. It has its
merits.
Only the test of actual experiment can

determine whether or not a name will
"stick." Stanford tried "Indians" a few
years ago, and it didn't stick. It wasn't a
"natural," for the California Indian was
a poor scrub at the best. I have consid
ered "Forty-Niners" instead, but it seems
artificial and forced. "Pioneers"
isn't bad at all.
But in any case, please adopt some
that can be drawn in a football cartoon.
The Jack Lustig situation is serious.
Yours truly,

Washington has its "Huskies," Cali
fornia its "Bear," U.S.C. its "Trojan"
(not so good), and so on. They call Stan
ford the "Cardinals," and you can't car
toon that; they call them the "Cards,4*
and playing-cards (while doubtless not
unknown on the Farm) do not work into
good cartoons. The result is a certain loss
of effective publicity.
At times Stanford has been called the
"Red-Shirts," and on this I respectfully
base a suggestion. The original red-shirt
was the pioneer California miner of the
days of '49. Senator Stanford was a pio
neer and at one time a red-shirt him
self. Stanford University is the direct
product of the pioneer era of California
—the pioneer mining days that led to the
pioneer transcontinental railroad, the pio
neer millionaires that came out of that
railroad, the pioneer educators who de
veloped modern technological education
in mining and engineering particularly.
That name, "Pioneers," reeks of Califor
nia and the West; it fits a headline, it
can be cartooned, it lends itself to bleach
er stunts, it ties in with the redwood
which is Stanford's seal and with the
museum which is better known than
many Stanford men realize; and besides
all that, there's something about the name
that fits the Stanford character and the
Stanford spirit. It seems straneg to me
that, although that good red-shirted name
has been lying around for years, no West
ern college has grabbed it yet. It has its
merits.
Only the test of actual experiment can

determine whether or not a name will
"stick." Stanford tried "Indians" a few
years ago, and it didn't stick. It wasn't a
"natural," for the California Indian was
a poor scrub at the best. I have consid
ered "Forty-Niners" instead, but it seems
artificial and forced. "Pioneers"
isn't bad at all.
But in any case, please adopt some
that can be drawn in a football cartoon.
The Jack Lustig situation is serious.

Editor, Sir:
Every year at this time Cartoonist Jack
Lustig of the Examiner gets restive and
surly. With the best heart in the world,
he just can't represent Stanford ade
quately in a football cartoon, because
Stanford has no symbol that works up
into a snappy drawing. Since Lustig and
I share the same office, this becomes of
direct personal concern to myself, and I
am strongly of the opinion that Stanford
ought to adopt a good pictorial symbol.
