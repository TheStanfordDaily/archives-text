# PALO ALTO IN THE OLDEN DAYS
## 
### 
One of the most historic places
in Palo Alto today is the green
front cafe known as Larkins, and
situated on the corner of University
Avenue and the Circle. The stores
on the Circle were the first built
in Palo Alto, and first among those
was Larkins Cafe.
There was a small clubroom in
the rear where all the roughs would
congregate around the big fireplace
for their strenuous bull sessions.
The tables were carved with promi
nent initials. These old table tops
still remain but because of altera
tions the clubroom is gone.
But the old spirit around Larkins
still remains. The fellows drop in
there and while eating there are
always papers and magazines to
read and the other boys to talk to.
The food is of excellent quality, and
the prices are right. You can save
money by buying a five dollar and
fifty cent meal ticket there for five
dollars.
