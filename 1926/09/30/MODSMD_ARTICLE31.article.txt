# ENGINEERING BUILDING IS REMODELED FOR AERONAUTIC PROJECT
## Guggenheim Fund Makes Gift of $300,000 to Foster Study of Aircraft 
### 
Plana are practically completed for j
the remodeling of the building now ;
occupied by the Pattern Shop and the
R.O.T.C. Ordnance Unit into the aero-!
nautics laboratory, made possible by
a $300,000 gift from the Guggenheim
Fund for the promotion of aeronautics. :
According to Professor E. P. Lesley,
who is actively in charge of the work,
the building is ideally suited for the
purpose of an experimental laboratory, i
and with a little alteration can be ar
ranged to house the huge air tunnel j
•which is to be constructed.
In addition to making available new '
■equipment, the fund will make possi-!
ble the securing of at least two more ;
instructors, one in the theoretical end j
of mathematical physics, and another '
in design and construction of aircraft. :
With a ten-year assurance of ade-!
quate financial aid, the University has j
made plans to organize the work into j
a six-year course. The first four years i
of this course will be occupied largely \
with broad engineering and general I
training, while the last two will be |
devoted wholly to intensive work in
the field of aerodynamics and aeronau-!
tic engineering.
Some of the efforts of the new
school will be devoted to research into
problems which center around and
determine the safety, reliability, and
economic efficiency of aircraft in oper- j
ation. Immediate plans call for the j
testing of a large number of models of |
propellers.
As some of the work will require !
actual flying, it is possible that a fly- ,
ing field will be established on the i
campus at some time in the future, j
A large amount of land is available :
for a flying field for experimental use j
with full-sized planes, and the proxi- j
mity of the campus to the bay will j
also make possible study with hydro- j
planes.
