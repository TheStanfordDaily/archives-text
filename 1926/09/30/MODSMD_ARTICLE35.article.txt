BERKELEY, Sept. 29. â€”Jack Mac-
Kenzie, assistant graduate manager,
has ordered the California Memorial
Stadium to be honeycombed with tele
phones to facilitate the handling of the
crowds during the 1926 football sea
son.
A central station has been installed
in the western rim of the bowl from
which the crowds can be viewed. Sta
tioned at each gate is a corps of re
serves and a telephone order can send
them to any point of the bowl in less
than three minutes.
