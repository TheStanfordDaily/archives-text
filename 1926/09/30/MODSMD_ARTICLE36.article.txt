# ALUMNI EXECUTIVES NAME FRANK TAYLOR EDITOR OF "REVIEW"
## Mrs. May Smith Succeeded By Former Member of "Sunset" Board 
### 
Frank J. Taylor was elected editor
of the Stanford Illustrated Review to
succeed Mrs. May Hurlburt Smith,
editor for the past three years. The
Executive Committee of the Alumni
Association of the Illustrated Review
during the summer selected Mr. Tay
lor and passed a resolution expressing
appreciation of the things Mrs. Smith
has accomplished for the alumni maga
zine during her editorship.
Taylor was one of the founders of
the Illustrated Review in 1916, then
an undergraduate publication which
later gave its name to the alumni
magazine when the two were merged.
He was also on the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto and of the Stanford Quad.
He is at present advertising manager
of the Yosemite Valley and Camp
Curry Company and was formerly as
sociate editor of the Sunset Magazine.
Taylor was elected editor of the
Daily Palo Alto but left college at the
end of the year to go with an ambu
lance unit which he helped organize
among Stanford journalists for service
in France. Following this he was cor
respondent for the United Press and
later helped build up its morning news
service. He was one of a group of
Stanford men on the New York Globe
and later managing editorial director
of the Scripps-Howard Newspaper
League.
The Illustrated Review Executive
Committee announces its policy as
being opposed to having an editor con
nected with the University faculty.
This was decided upon because of the
possibilities of controversies that
might arise between alumni and fac
ulty.
Taylor will live at the home of Pro
fessor Henry Judson Hall in Los Altos.
His office is in San Francisco.
