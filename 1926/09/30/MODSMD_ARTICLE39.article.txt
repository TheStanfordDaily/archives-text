# SCHOOL OF LETTERS FOR UPPER DIVISION STUDENTS IS BEGUN
## 
### 
A School of Letters and a School of
Physical Sciences, to both of which
third-year students are eligible, are
open this quarter, following a deci
sion reached this summer by the
Board of Trustees, acting upon advice
from President Wilbur, and several
department heads.
The School of Letters is to include
all the departments of languages and
literature, while the School of Physical
Science is comprised by the depart
ments of astronomy, chemistry, geo
logy, mathematics, physics, and such
others as may seem to be directly re
lated to these.
The new schools were formed with
the idea in mind of discouraging un
dergraduates from too early specializa
tion. It is now possible to plan a
lower division course to lead into one
of several fields, assuming that the
student is not sure what work he
wishes to do in his last two years or
during his graduate period.
