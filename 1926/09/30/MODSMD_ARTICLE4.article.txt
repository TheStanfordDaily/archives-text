Encina Gym will have a new direc
tor with the beginning of winter quar
ter, when Thomas Andrew Storey, '96,
will return to Stanford as Professor
I of Hygiene and Physical Education for
j Men, and Director of Encina Gymna
| sium. Dr. Barrow will remain in the
j capacity of Medical Advisor to Men,
and Coach E. P. Hunt will assume the
work of Director until Storey arrives
in January. The present staff will
otherwise remain intact.
Since 1906 Dr. Storey has been at
the College of the City of New York
as Professor and Director of Hygiene,
where, during his term of service, he
has built up what is considered the
first rounded-®ut department of hy
giene in the country. His organization
| there has served as a model for both
universities and public school systems.
Dr. Storey's active and varied career
has made him a recognized authority
on health conservation and promotion,
j and on hygiene arc"' hygiene methods
j in educational institutions. In 1596 he
J graduated in History from Stanford,
j As a result of his activity and interest
I in physical education he was put in
j charge Of directing the work here in
! the old gymnasium where he served
; until 1906 after receiving his M.A. in
1900, and Ph.D. in 1902 from the Hop
kins Marine Laboratory, Pacific Grove,
j His interest by this time had turned
definitely from history to hygiene, and
after carrying on his studies in physi
ology at Michigan and the Boston
I Long Island Hospital, he received, the
i degree of M.D. at Harvard in 1905.
At Stanford his work was of a
i pioneering nature. At the time when
he served, there was no organized or
required system of physical training.
Only about 300 students elected to
take the courses given, and "Tom"
Storey, as he was then called, and a
few student assistants, composed the
. staff of directors.
After leaving Stanford he continued
his work at the New York College,
where he was given complete power.
When he began there, no organized
department was in existence, but the
i system he has developed has served
as a model for the nation.
During the World War Dr. Storey
was the directing executive of the
United States Interdepartmental So
cial Hygiene Board, which was a re
sult of the co-operative effort of the
! War, Navy, and Treasury departments.
Millions of dollars were expended
every year in this department's work,
and a large personnel was involved.
The work included educational and
scientific research and development.
Summer camps for boys under a
system of military discipline were es
tablished in 1916 by the state of New
York, and Dr. Storey was appointed
one of the three administrative com
missioners. His services in this capa
city have warranted his reappointment
year after year. He was Secretary-
General of the Fourth International
| Conference on School Hygiene, and
editor of its proceedings; fellow of the
A.A.A.S.; a member of the American
! Physiological Society, Biology and
| Medicine Society, and Life Extension
League, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma
Xi; and has been secretary of the
Stanford Club of« New York.
He has written exclusively on physi
ology, hygiene, physical education and
1 related subjects, and is the author of
the New York State Program and
Syllabus on Physical Training.
