# REAL ESTATE PROFIT IN SWEDEN ENRICHES COMMUNITY COFFERS
## 
### 
When land becomes valuable in
America, the profits go to the real
estate sub-divider, but in Sweden the
profits enrich the community. This is
the observation made by John Leighly,
Associate in Geography at the Uni
versity of California, who has just re
turned from a year spent in Sweden
studying the geography of towns.
"In America all profits are saved for
the realtor, and the laws protect and
favor the individual rather than the
community," says Leighly. "In Swe
den, however, everything is directed
toward making things easier for the
small property holder and the con
sumer."
By the Swedish system, Hie town
itself buys up property which gives
indication of an increase in value. This
property is then held by the town and
is leased or sold at a price far lower
than the speculator's to individuals
or corporations who will develop it.
The profits derived from the transac
tion are turned back into the com
munity in the form of public buildings
or public enterprises. A large building
fund also is provided which makes it
possible for individuals of limited
means to build homes on money bor
rowed from the town at a low interest
on long-time loans.
