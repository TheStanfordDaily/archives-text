# TROJAN COACH FACES TOUGH SEASON WITH EXPERIENCED SQUAD
## Notre Dame vs. U.S.C. Clash Only Post-Season Game On Schedule List 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29—Can
Coach Howard Jones, using football
knowledge gained through 18 years of
mentorship at some of the great uni
versities in the country, mould from
perhaps the most promising all
around material in the West a team
which will go undefeated through the
University of Southern California's
most strenuous football season?
That is the question which, not only
Trojan students and alumni, but fans
throughout the entire Pacific Coast
Conference are asking. And Coach
Jones is pondering just as deeply as
any over the answer to that question.
Although the Southern California
team has always been a dangerous
quantity in conference ranks during
the past five seasons, not until the
present season lias it been conceded
the most probable winner of the cham
pionship race. Admitted to the con
ference in 1921, the Trojans have al
ways been well up near the front at
the close of each program but the
pennant has yet to be hung on South
ern California walls.
Face Stiff Schedule
On one side of this question is the
Trojan schedule; on the other stands
the list of material for the 1926 team.
That the program is a tough one is
generally admitted. No team which
meets Whittier, Santa Clara, Washing
ton State, and Occidental in the first
four weeks of play, then jumps imme
diately to the task of beating Cali
fornia and Stanford on succeeding
Saturdays, and next faces three hard
conference games with the Oregon
Aggies, Idaho, and Montana, can be
said to have an easy pathway toward
the championship. When on top of
this there comes a final game with
Notre Dame, the prospects of finish
ing an unbeaten season are none too
strong.
While pointing out that Washington
State, Oregon Aggies, Idaho, and Mon
tana have practically the 1925 squads
back, that Occidental and Santa Clara
with Albert Exendine and Adam
Walsh as respective coaches are ex
ceedingly dangerous, and that Cali
fornia and Stanford loom as probable
champs with plenty of material, Coach
Jones admits that he has a splendid
crop of men from which to harvest
success this season.
His flank positions will be well
taken care of. The two regulars will
undoubtedly be A1 Behrendt and Mor
ris Badgro, both playing their third
seasons. Behrendt captained the 1923
Coast Championship freshman squad
and Badgro was developing into the
pass-receiving sensation of the Coast
when his arm was broken last year.
To assist these men there will be
Gene Dorsey, letter man of 1923 and
1924 who was not eligible last fall, and
Jim Moser, 1925 letter man. Other
end candidates are Ferd Manlove, Ted
Coffman and Hugh Edwards, of last
year's squad; and Larry Diehl, How
ard Failor, Leslie Lavelle, Karl Krei
ger, and Maynard Taylor, freshmen a
year ago.
Letter Men Back
At tackles, five letter men return in
the persons of Kenenth Cox, Bill
Friend, A1 Scheving, Clarke De Groote,
and Don Cruickshank, as well as Jack
Wescott, Sam Yocum, and Henry
Oudermelen, members of the 1925
squad. Jesse Hibbs, captain of the
frosh last year, looks capable of be
coming a regular, while Gene Beatie,
Marion Morrison, Bill Bradbury, Stan
ley Rex, and Hilton McCabe, all for
mer freshmen, will be available.
Brice Taylor, all-Coast running
guard who has done the 100 in 9.9
seconds, and Ted Gorrell, 210-pound
standing guard, will play their third
seasons this fall. They were in 620 and
599 minutes respectively without in
juries last year. Lloyd Hershberger,
injured early last season, is the only
other returning varsity guard. From
the freshman team Coach Jones re
ceives Oliver White, the best-appear
ing candidate, and Howard Bell, Clay
ton Phillips, and A1 Schaub.
Cravath Is Threat
Most of the center duties will be
handled by Captain Jeff Cravath, all-
Coast man who is slated as an All-
American this fall, John Fox, frosh
star, and Lyle Baldridge, a varsity
letter man, will relieve Cravath.
The quarterback situation presents
a problem but Don Williams, from the
1924 frosh team, will probably get
first call. He is a wonderful prospect,
running the team well and being a
good ball-carrier, punter, and passer.
Howard Elliott, letter man of last sea
son, and Vic Orsatti, 1925 varsity man,
will see action, as will Lowry, McCas
lin, and "Bud" Elliott, sophomores.
Manuel Laraneta looks to be a cinch
at fullback, with Bob Lee as second
choice. Both have made two previous
varsity letters. Charles Galindo, var
sity man last year, ranks as third best

taken care of. The two regulars will
undoubtedly be A1 Behrendt and Mor
ris Badgro, both playing their third
seasons. Behrendt captained the 1923
Coast Championship freshman squad
and Badgro was developing into the
pass-receiving sensation of the Coast
when his arm was broken last year.
To assist these men there will be
Gene Dorsey, letter man of 1923 and
1924 who was not eligible last fall, and
Jim Moser, 1925 letter man. Other
end candidates are Ferd Manlove, Ted
Coffman and Hugh Edwards, of last
year's squad; and Larry Diehl, How
ard Failor, Leslie Lavelle, Karl Krei
ger, and Maynard Taylor, freshmen a
year ago.
Letter Men Back
At tackles, five letter men return in
the persons of Kenenth Cox, Bill
Friend, A1 Scheving, Clarke De Groote,
and Don Cruickshank, as well as Jack
Wescott, Sam Yocum, and Henry
Oudermelen, members of the 1925
squad. Jesse Hibbs, captain of the
frosh last year, looks capable of be
coming a regular, while Gene Beatie,
Marion Morrison, Bill Bradbury, Stan
ley Rex, and Hilton McCabe, all for
mer freshmen, will be available.
Brice Taylor, all-Coast running
guard who has done the 100 in 9.9
seconds, and Ted Gorrell, 210-pound
standing guard, will play their third
seasons this fall. They were in 620 and
599 minutes respectively without in
juries last year. Lloyd Hershberger,
injured early last season, is the only
other returning varsity guard. From
the freshman team Coach Jones re
ceives Oliver White, the best-appear
ing candidate, and Howard Bell, Clay
ton Phillips, and A1 Schaub.
Cravath Is Threat
Most of the center duties will be
handled by Captain Jeff Cravath, all-
Coast man who is slated as an All-
American this fall, John Fox, frosh
star, and Lyle Baldridge, a varsity
letter man, will relieve Cravath.
The quarterback situation presents
a problem but Don Williams, from the
1924 frosh team, will probably get
first call. He is a wonderful prospect,
running the team well and being a
good ball-carrier, punter, and passer.
Howard Elliott, letter man of last sea
son, and Vic Orsatti, 1925 varsity man,
will see action, as will Lowry, McCas
lin, and "Bud" Elliott, sophomores.
Manuel Laraneta looks to be a cinch
at fullback, with Bob Lee as second
choice. Both have made two previous
varsity letters. Charles Galindo, var
sity man last year, ranks as third best
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29—Can
Coach Howard Jones, using football
knowledge gained through 18 years of
mentorship at some of the great uni
versities in the country, mould from
perhaps the most promising all
around material in the West a team
which will go undefeated through the
University of Southern California's
most strenuous football season?
That is the question which, not only
Trojan students and alumni, but fans
throughout the entire Pacific Coast
Conference are asking. And Coach
Jones is pondering just as deeply as
any over the answer to that question.
Although the Southern California
team has always been a dangerous
quantity in conference ranks during
the past five seasons, not until the
present season lias it been conceded
the most probable winner of the cham
pionship race. Admitted to the con
ference in 1921, the Trojans have al
ways been well up near the front at
the close of each program but the
pennant has yet to be hung on South
ern California walls.
Face Stiff Schedule
On one side of this question is the
Trojan schedule; on the other stands
the list of material for the 1926 team.
That the program is a tough one is
generally admitted. No team which
meets Whittier, Santa Clara, Washing
ton State, and Occidental in the first
four weeks of play, then jumps imme
diately to the task of beating Cali
fornia and Stanford on succeeding
Saturdays, and next faces three hard
conference games with the Oregon
Aggies, Idaho, and Montana, can be
said to have an easy pathway toward
the championship. When on top of
this there comes a final game with
Notre Dame, the prospects of finish
ing an unbeaten season are none too
strong.
While pointing out that Washington
State, Oregon Aggies, Idaho, and Mon
tana have practically the 1925 squads
back, that Occidental and Santa Clara
with Albert Exendine and Adam
Walsh as respective coaches are ex
ceedingly dangerous, and that Cali
fornia and Stanford loom as probable
champs with plenty of material, Coach
Jones admits that he has a splendid
crop of men from which to harvest
success this season.

first call. He is a wonderful prospect,
running the team well and being a
good ball-carrier, punter, and passer.
Howard Elliott, letter man of last sea
son, and Vic Orsatti, 1925 varsity man,
will see action, as will Lowry, McCas
lin, and "Bud" Elliott, sophomores.
Manuel Laraneta looks to be a cinch
at fullback, with Bob Lee as second
choice. Both have made two previous
varsity letters. Charles Galindo, var
sity man last year, ranks as third best
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29—Can
Coach Howard Jones, using football
knowledge gained through 18 years of
mentorship at some of the great uni
versities in the country, mould from
perhaps the most promising all
around material in the West a team
which will go undefeated through the
University of Southern California's
most strenuous football season?
That is the question which, not only
Trojan students and alumni, but fans
throughout the entire Pacific Coast
Conference are asking. And Coach
Jones is pondering just as deeply as
any over the answer to that question.
Although the Southern California
team has always been a dangerous
quantity in conference ranks during
the past five seasons, not until the
present season lias it been conceded
the most probable winner of the cham
pionship race. Admitted to the con
ference in 1921, the Trojans have al
ways been well up near the front at
the close of each program but the
pennant has yet to be hung on South
ern California walls.
Face Stiff Schedule
On one side of this question is the
Trojan schedule; on the other stands
the list of material for the 1926 team.
That the program is a tough one is
generally admitted. No team which
meets Whittier, Santa Clara, Washing
ton State, and Occidental in the first
four weeks of play, then jumps imme
diately to the task of beating Cali
fornia and Stanford on succeeding
Saturdays, and next faces three hard
conference games with the Oregon
Aggies, Idaho, and Montana, can be
said to have an easy pathway toward
the championship. When on top of
this there comes a final game with
Notre Dame, the prospects of finish
ing an unbeaten season are none too
strong.
While pointing out that Washington
State, Oregon Aggies, Idaho, and Mon
tana have practically the 1925 squads
back, that Occidental and Santa Clara
with Albert Exendine and Adam
Walsh as respective coaches are ex
ceedingly dangerous, and that Cali
fornia and Stanford loom as probable
champs with plenty of material, Coach
Jones admits that he has a splendid
crop of men from which to harvest
success this season.
His flank positions will be well
taken care of. The two regulars will
undoubtedly be A1 Behrendt and Mor
ris Badgro, both playing their third
seasons. Behrendt captained the 1923
Coast Championship freshman squad
and Badgro was developing into the
pass-receiving sensation of the Coast
when his arm was broken last year.
To assist these men there will be
Gene Dorsey, letter man of 1923 and
1924 who was not eligible last fall, and
Jim Moser, 1925 letter man. Other
end candidates are Ferd Manlove, Ted
Coffman and Hugh Edwards, of last
year's squad; and Larry Diehl, How
ard Failor, Leslie Lavelle, Karl Krei
ger, and Maynard Taylor, freshmen a
year ago.
Letter Men Back
At tackles, five letter men return in
the persons of Kenenth Cox, Bill
Friend, A1 Scheving, Clarke De Groote,
and Don Cruickshank, as well as Jack
Wescott, Sam Yocum, and Henry
Oudermelen, members of the 1925
squad. Jesse Hibbs, captain of the
frosh last year, looks capable of be
coming a regular, while Gene Beatie,
Marion Morrison, Bill Bradbury, Stan
ley Rex, and Hilton McCabe, all for
mer freshmen, will be available.
Brice Taylor, all-Coast running
guard who has done the 100 in 9.9
seconds, and Ted Gorrell, 210-pound
standing guard, will play their third
seasons this fall. They were in 620 and
599 minutes respectively without in
juries last year. Lloyd Hershberger,
injured early last season, is the only
other returning varsity guard. From
the freshman team Coach Jones re
ceives Oliver White, the best-appear
ing candidate, and Howard Bell, Clay
ton Phillips, and A1 Schaub.
Cravath Is Threat
Most of the center duties will be
handled by Captain Jeff Cravath, all-
Coast man who is slated as an All-
American this fall, John Fox, frosh
star, and Lyle Baldridge, a varsity
letter man, will relieve Cravath.
The quarterback situation presents
a problem but Don Williams, from the
1924 frosh team, will probably get
first call. He is a wonderful prospect,
running the team well and being a
good ball-carrier, punter, and passer.
Howard Elliott, letter man of last sea
son, and Vic Orsatti, 1925 varsity man,
will see action, as will Lowry, McCas
lin, and "Bud" Elliott, sophomores.
