# U.C. RESEARCH BOAT RETURNS FROM TRIP FOR STUDY SAMPLES
## 
### 
The University of California's
ocean-going launch, used for scientific
purposes and stationed at Scripps In
stitution of Oceanography at La Jolla,
has just returned from a ten-day
cruise with approximately 550 study
samples on board, gathered at various
places along the route from San Diego
to Pt. Concepcion.
The institution boat is one of the
very few ocean-going vessels owned
and operated by a university for scien
tific purposes in the world. It is
gasoline-driven, 60< feet in length, 15
feet in beam, and draws 6 to 8 feet
of water. It was recently given a coat
of blue and go\d paint.
In gathering material for study,
members of the crew, professors of the
university and visiting scientists took
samples of water, or organisms, and
of the bottom, every five miles or so
during the trip. Water samples and
plankton samples were taken in many
cases with patent closing bottles,
which open and shut at certain depths,
allowing detailed study of the ocean
levels. Bottom samples were obtained
by means of a miniature clam-shell
dredge a few inches in diameter,
which is lowered by a cable and shut
with a snap by means of a spring and
release.
Dr. Trask, a visiting scientist and
one of the crew, is particularly inter
ested in source beds of petroleum
which may or may not be in process
of formation on the floor of the ocean
at the present time. Dr. E. G. Moberg
was in charge. James Ross, chief
mechanician, Mr. Lewis, and Mr.
Bailey completed the personnel.
