# STEVENSON SCORES VICTORIES IN SUMMER SWIMMING CONTESTS
## 
### 
Carl Stevenson, Coach Ernst Brand
sten's stellar middle and long distance
swimmer, spent a large part of the
summer winning first places in im
portant aquatic competition here and
in Southern California. Stevenson won
four notable victories against the pick
of the swimming talent of the state:
the mile swim in the Russian River
at Healdsburg, the open water mile
in the ocean at Long Beach, the Silver
Gate classic at San Diego, and lastly,
the Golden Gate swim, in which he set
a record that is expected to stand for
some time.
Dave Fall, captain of last year's
swimming team, won second in the
national A.A.U. diving championship
held in Philadelphia July 31. Fall fin
ished less than one point, in a total
of one hundred behind Pete Dejardins,
representing Miami, Florida. By tak
ing second single-handed, Fall placed
Stanford in fifth position among ath
letic clubs and swimming associations
of the country. It is reported that Des
jardins hopes to enter Stanford during
the coming year.
On July 9 Stevenson outstripped a
field of thirty-two swimmers in the
Russian River at Healdsburg, and for
the second time won the annual mile
swim in the time of 22 minutes 31 3-5
seconds. If he wins it again next year
he will become the permanent pos
sessor of a magnificent silver cup of
fered to the first three-times winner
of the event. Art Hargreaves of the
Olympic Club led Stevenson for the
first quarter mile but he was unable
to match the pace set by the Cardinal
star at the finish. Bob Williams, Stan
ford 50- and 100-yard star, gained an
easy fourth place.
A choppy sea handicapped the field
of paddlers in the open water mile at
Long Beach, but did not prevent
Stevenson from defeating such ex
perienced ocean swimmers as his own
teammate, Wally O'Connor, Wadley
of Venice, and Kendall of Pasadena.
The time was 24 minutes 47 seconds,
only two minutes slower than that
made in the smooth water at Healds
burg. O'Connor finished in second
place about ten yards behind.
Stevenson again led O'Connor in the
Silver Gate Swim across the famous
000-yard stretch at San Diego. A field
of over one hundred started in this
race. O'Connor having won the swim
before was picked by many to repeat,
but he again was yards behind the
diminutive Card flash. Stevenson has
increased his speed over the middle
distances considerably, and as a re
sult of these three victories can be
considered Pacific Coast champion at
the half and the mile.
Leo Purcell's record for the Golden
Gate was shattered by 11 minutes
when Stevenson won the Chronicle's
trophy for first place across the San
Francisco channel. The former record

was 44 minutes, six seconds, which
Stevenson reduced to 33 minutes 23
seconds. He was over 300 yards ahead
of his nearest competitor, Purcell. One
hundred and twenty-seven swimmers
completed the course. Stevenson won
the Chronicle plaque as well as the
first-place prize.
