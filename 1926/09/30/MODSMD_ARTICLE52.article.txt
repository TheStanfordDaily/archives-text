# PLAN OF STANFORD CAMPUS PRAISED BY MID-WEST PROFESSOR
## 
### 
"Stanford is the only University in
America built from the ground up,"
said Professor Leonard Smith of the
University of Wisconsin, an authority
on city planning and metropolitan
housing problems, who lectured in the
Little Theatre during the summer ses
sion on the subject, "The Menace of
Great Cities and a Remedyâ€”the Gar
den City."
Professor Smith pointed out that
Stanford had been built on the same
system as that worked out for the
modern garden city, with everything
planned for years ahead and all build
ing activity tending in a definite direc
tion. Haphazard building, or crowding
to the last ounce, is a grave danger.
The garden city is designed to re
lieve the squalor and confusion of
modern industrial metropolises which
have grown up unplanned and un
regulated. The garden city should be
one-third city and two-thirds garden.
Population should never rise over
50,000. The government could have
certain powers to regulate housing
conditions and the leasing of land for
farming and gardening.
