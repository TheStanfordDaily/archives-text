# Last Clubhouse Payment Met by Stanford Women
## 
### 
Money to meet final payment upon
the $45,000 Stanford Women's Club
house was raised this summer, accord
ing to Mrs. Ellwood P. Cubberley,
treasurer of the club.
Since 1910 the Stanford women have
been working on the plan for com
munity center. It was first planned to
erect a clubhouse in some spot out
under the oaks, but with the Hoover
donation for a men's Union the plan
was changed to join in erecting the
present clubhouse quadrangle. The
building was completed in 1915, and
has operated ever since as one of the
most useful structures on the campus.
