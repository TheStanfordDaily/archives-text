# WOLTER'S TEAM WINS THIRTEEN, LOSES NINE CONTESTS IN ORIENT
## Steve Collins Is Named to Captain 1927 Varsity Baseball Squad 
### 
Twenty-three games were played by
the Stanford baseball team on its
three months' tour of the Orient and
Hawaii. Of these, thirteen were vic
tories for the Cards and nine were
lost to various Japanese, Manchurian,
and Hawaiian teams met on the way.
The percentage of games won in
creased toward the end of the trip
although the first dozen contests
resulted largely in Cardinal defeats.
Of the last ten contests the Redshirt
players won eight, and these against
the crack nines of Manchuria and the
Hawaiian Islands. Steve Collins, one
of the varsity's best pitchers, was
elected next season's captain on the
return voyage just before the boat
docked at San Francisco.
No stop-over was made by the partv
at the Hawaiian Islands on the trip
across the Pacific. Most of me
took their final examinations on the
boat. Upon arrival in Japan on June
24 the squad went immediately to
Tokio where a series of games was
played with Waseda and Maje uni
versity teams. Of the first eight games
played in Japan, seven resulted in
defeats for the Cards, one solitary
victory over Maje being the only re
lief.
A victory was scored over the crack
Tomone Club, made up of some of the
best players of Japan, after which the
team went to Osaka for a stay lasting
from July 7 to July 17, Four contests
were held there. The Cards triumphed
over the Daimi club, rated the best
semi-pro outfit on the Nipponese
islands. A double-header with the
Osaka town team was split and the
fourth game, with Waseda University
again, gave another victory to the
Japanes? college men.
According to Coach Harry Wolter
and members of the squad, the party
was royally entertained along the
way, and was extended every courtesy
by the Japanese government as well
as by rival teams.
The party which left San Francisco
on June 8 was composed of Coach
Harry Wolter, Mrs. Wolter, Tom
Quinn, manager; Steve Collins, John
Sobieski, Tod Oviatt, pitchers; Bill
Maguire, first baseman; James Gari
baldi, second baseman; Jimmy Busch,
shortstop; Captain Murray Cuddeback,
third baseman; Tex Weaver, Gene
Nissen, Bill Clark. Hal King, and
Jerry Stewart, fielders; Paddy Draper,
first baseman; and Clarence Sypher,
catcher.
The trip was under the auspices of
Waseda University of Japan whose
ball team met the Cards in several
games.
The squad went by boat from Kobe
to Dairen on the Manchurian main
land. There they began to fare better
than they had earlier on the trip.
Three victories were scored out of the
four games played. The Manchurian
Railroad nine and the Business Men's
team each played the Cards twice.
Although the Business Men's team
â€¢were Manchurian champious it was
the Railroaders that gave the Cardinal
its single defeat.
No further games were played until
the team reached Hawaii. There they
went in great style and nabbed five of
the six games played. With the excep
tion of the Braves, who proved too
good for Harry Wolter's men, all the
island teams were trounced, including
the Navy, the Elks, the All-Chinese,
and the Asahis.
