# TWO MILLION VOLT SPARK ATTAINED BY RYAN ELECTRICIANS
## Opening of High Voltage Laboratory Sees Record Current Achieved 
### 
When Dr. Harris J. Ryan threw the
switch that sent two million volts of
electricity crashing in a ribbon of
flame over twenty feet long at the
opening of the new High Voltage labo
ratory on the Stanford campus, the
event presaged a possible new era of
electrical power, according to scien
tists and engineers who witnessed the
event September 17. The voltage was
the highest ever attained by man.
The Ryan laboratory, erected by
Stanford University with the aid of a
number of the large electrical con
cerns of the nation to enable I)r. Ryan
to continue his research work, is lo
cated on the - campus just outside of
Mayfield and replaces the outgrown
present laboratory. A strip of land
one hundred yards wide and seven
miles long has been reserved by the
University for an experimental high
voltage transmission line to carry new
super power.
The new laboratory boasts also of
three enormous doors, each forty
seven feet high and forty feet wide,
entirely of metal, but so mounted that
one man can swing them. The huge
building can be made absolutely light
proof.
Among the problems which Stanford
faculty and engineering students will
work on this year in connection with
the new power plant will be discovery
of insulating oils or other material to
stop the losses of current encountered
when a high voltage is sent over wires
of present construction.
The significance of the experiments
being conducted in the Stanford labo
ratory is important, say engineers, as
sixty per cent of the available water
power of the United States is located
on the Pacific Coast. Interconnection
of the metropolitan areas with the
huge water power reserves will re
quire far greater transmission dis
tances than those heretofore accom
plished.
