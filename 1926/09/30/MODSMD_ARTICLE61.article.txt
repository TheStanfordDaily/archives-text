# DRAMATIC SUCCESSES OF SUMMER QUARTER WILL BE PRODUCED
## 
### 
"Hay Fever" and "Aren't We All?"
two of the plays that made this sum
mer quarter the most successful of all
summer quarters in the history of
Stanford dramatics, will be presented
during the fall, according to a recent
announcement by Gordon Davis.
Both plays drew large houses at the
summer presentation. Both are come
dies, and aim to entertain rather than
edify the audience.
"Hamlet," which was presented in
modern clothes during the summer,
will not be repeated, according to
present plans, although critics praised
it highly. Charles G. Norris, who saw
the performance of "Hamlet," claimed
that it compared favorably with sev
eral professional performances that he
had attended. Lester Vail (Les Seib),
Stanford alumnus, now prominent in
professional New York dramatic cir
cles, returned during the summer quar
ter to take the part of Hamlet.
"Aren't We All?" will probably be
the first production of the fall quarter.
Its humor is more subtle than that of
"Hay Fever." In the summer presenta
tion, "Aren't We All?" was distin-1
guished by the performance of Gordon 1
Davis as Lord Grenham.
