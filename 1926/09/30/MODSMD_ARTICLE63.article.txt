## 
### 
The menagerie is said to be the
biggest and best assorted under can
vas. Included are the three famous
herds of elephants, dozens of cages of
"jungle-bred man killers," and other
beasts, as well as hundreds of horses,
while a vast army of employes and
performers are required to give the
programs and keep the show moving.
Not all the money taken in here
will be carried away by the show. In
fact it is stated that the expenditures

' for food supplies for humans and ani
mals will run far into four figures.
Supplies of equipment and repair bills
and other items it has been found are
necessary in nearly every town the
show visits.
The usual spectacle will open the
program and the full strength of the
organization is necessary for this. The
"spec" this season is a masterpiece
and of course affords the opportunity
for a display of gorgeousness and won
! derful costuming. The prima donnas

' and a singing dancing chorus of sev
â–  eral hundred girls are used.
Patrons are given the assurance
that the Sells-Floto circus from side
show to after-show is clean. In fact
I the owners pride themselves that this
big circus is known as "the cleanest
in every way" on the road.
The ticket is scheduled to open at
!) a.m., Friday, at Martin's Music Store.
Prices will be the same as on the
grounds. Performances are set for 2
, and 8 p.m.
