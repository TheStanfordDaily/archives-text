### 
C. T. Kesselmyer, Stanford '24, who
entered the Testing Department of the
General Electric Company upon gradu
ation, is a member of the first class to
graduate from the Company's Ad
vanced Engineering course, directed
by R. E. Doherty, consulting engineer.
The course includes a three-year
schedule of which the first-year class
contains about thirty students that
have met the satisfactory require
ments and from five to ten of these
thirty are selected to go on with work
through the second and third years.
Those that are not successful take
positions in the engineering depart
ment.
Study in the first year is devoted to

I the application of the fundamental
laws to the solution of engineering
problems in mechanics, hydraulics,
thermo-dynamics, electricity, and mag
netism. In the second and third years
jthe course is divided among the
studies of practical engineering work
in different designing departments,
i manufacturing processes, and actual
field experience as members of a dis-
I trict engineering staff.
In all three years lectures are given
each week on the company's time
where problems are presented by the
students who have to spend between
| five and fifteen hours on home work
solving assigned problems and prepar
ing news ones for presentation to the
class.
Upon the completion of the ad
vanced course each graduate takes up
a responsible position in one of the
engineering departments of the com
pany.
