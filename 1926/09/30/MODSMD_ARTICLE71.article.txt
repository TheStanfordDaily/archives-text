# STANFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL ACTIVITIES TOLD IN PAMPHLET
## 
### 
An insight into the many fields of
activity engaged in by the research de
partments of the Stanford Medical
School is given in an issue of "Con
cerning Stanford," which appeared
during the early part of the summer.
Another issue of the pamphlet, which
appears from time to time to describe
In detail the work carried by the vari
ous branches of the University is
shortly to come off the press.
All of the teaching staff of the
Medical Shcool devote a part of their
time to research and investigation.
This group has published an average
of eighty scientific papers annually,
covering all phases of medical science.
The Department of Anatomy is in
vestigating questions of structure and
development from a number of angles
and employing a variety of animal
forms. The role of heredity in relation
to structural expression is being
studied in reference to anemia, adi
posity, and the production of monsters
and teratomata.
The study of natural infection and
artificial immunization offers an inex
haustible field for research in the De
partment of Bacteriology and Experi
mental Pathology. Serum treatment,
■which has already been proven for a
number of diseases, has yet to be suc
cessfully applied in some of the more
common diseases like tuberculosis.
Judging from previous investigations,
much can be expected in the future
for the development of important
means of prevention and cure.
At the request of the American
Medical Association and other agen
cies, a number of very important re
searches have been conducted into the
merits of new and proprietary reme
dies exploited before the medical pro
fession and the public. Another vital
branch of the work which has been
most consistently followed is the study
of food poisoning.
