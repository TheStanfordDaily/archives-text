# San Francisco-Palo Alto Railroad Fares Reduced
## 
### 
Long-waited-for reductions in penin
j sula railroad fares, particularly to San
; Francisco, were realized recently with
the announcement of the Southern
Pacific of rate cuts in round-trip one
day excursions between all stations,
San Francisco and San Jose inclusive.
The new round-trip fare between
Palo Alto and San Francisco will be
$1.20' for any day and honored for re
turn on any train leaving prior to mid
night of the same day. Other exam
ples of the new round-trip rate are:
Palo Alto to San Jose, seventy cents,
to Redwood City, twenty cents, to San
Mateo, fifty cents, and to Burlingame,
sixty cents.
The blanket ruling of the Interstate
Commerce Commission requiring a
fare of three cents a mile has pre
vented better rates on the peninsula
railroads, but by making one-day
round-trip fares the ruling is null.
