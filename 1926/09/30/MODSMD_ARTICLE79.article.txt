# CARDINAL FRESHMEN PROMISE HEAVY SET OF LIVE CANDIDATES
## 
### 
One of the heaviest freshman teams in
years will represent Stanford this season.
A line averaging from 180 to 190 pounds
and a backfield approaching the 170-pound
mark now makes up the team which last
Saturday downed the St. Mary's frosh
and which will take the field Saturday
afternoon against California Poly in the
second practice game of the year.
More than 100 men reported to Coach
Hunt on September 15, the opening day
of practice, but that number has now been
cut to about 50. The team does not look
like an aggregation of veterans yet, but
a decided improvement over the work in
the first game has been shown in the last
few nights' practice. Being so heavy, the
team looks a little slow at present, and
plays do not seem to be timed just right.
1 hese faults, due to lack of playing to
gether, will doubtless be wiped out by
another week's work.
Templeman Looks Good
Tcmpleman looks like the best bet for
center, while Forrester and Speers have
been holding down the guard berths on
the first string the last few nights. Rotto
and Lyman have been playing tackles, and
Rush, Albertson, Lienhardt, and Stien
beck have seen the most action as ends.
Bush played a great game against St.
Mary's Saturday, showing plenty of speed
in getting down under punts.
Heinecke has shown up well as quar
terback, while both Simpkins and Hobde
look good as fullbacks. The latter two are
both heavy, good ball carriers, and good
kickers. Hobde seemed to have the edge
for a while, but he is now laid up with
a bad knee and Simpkins is holding down
the fullback position. Laird, May, Jack
Murphy, Dowling, and Fenthrop form a
quintet of capable halfbacks from which
Hunt can take his pick. May made several
sensational runs Saturday, and Fenthrop
looked good as a kicker.
Following the California Poly game,
the frosh will meet San Mateo junior
college and Sacramento junior college on
successive Saturdays. They will rest the
week of the Stanford-Oregon game and
then take on the U.S.C. freshmen here
October 30.
