# FAMOUS ARTISTS TO PRESENT SERIES OF STANFORD CONCERTS
## Support Assured for Five Recitals, Season Rate For Students 
### 
Stanford University will be the scene
of a series of five notable concerts by a
group of the world's greatest solo artists
and musical organizations during the
coming year, as a result of the realization
of plans for the Associated Students Con
cert Series under the leadership of \V il
frid Davis, concert manager. This news
comes as a surprise to most of the student
body, who left the campus at the end of
the last spring quarter, when it was still
an open question whether sufficient student
support had been assured by the season
ticket pledge cards circulated for the pur
pose of sounding the situation.
The entire series of five concerts to be
held in the Stanford Basketball Pavilion,
will be available to all members of the
student body and faculty for the low
season price of $3.00, an average of only
sixty cents a concert. It is impossible to
secure a satisfactory seat for the San
Francisco recitals of any one of these
artists for less than $1.50 or $2.00, aside
from the expense of the trip to and from
the city, so the Stanford Concert Series
will put the finest in music within easy
reach of the student body for the first
time. The Series is entirely a student
body enterprise, promoted, managed, and
supervised Ify Stanford student body
members.
Famous Artists Billed
The list of artists is made up of three
famous singers, a world-famous string
quartette, and one of the finest symphony
orchestras in the country, giving a well
balanced and contrasting program. The
artists with dates of the campus appear
ances are as follows: Louis Graveure,
distinguished Belgian baritone, Thursday
night, October 28, 1926; Mischa Elman,
noted violin virtuoso, with his newly or
ganized string quartette, Tuesday night,
November 16; the complete San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, with its popu
lar leader Dr. Alfred Hertz conducting,
Wednesday night, December 8; Rosa
Ponselle, one of the finest soprano singers
on either operatic or concert stage, Thurs
day night, March 3; and Tito Scbipa, of
the Metropolitan Opera and concert fame,
Thursday night, March 31.
Dr. Hertz made the statement last year
that he believed the basketball pavilion
to be excellently suited, acoustically, for
the presentation of orchestral and solo
concerts. It will be possible to seat be
tween four and five thousand people with
in easy hearing and seeing distance, with
out any disturbing echoes or any masonry
to obstruct the view.
Incoming freshmen, registering in the
University for the first time, will be j
granted the privilege of getting the season j
tickets at the student rate of $3.00. It is
expected that a large percentage of the
class of '30 will take advantage of the
opportunity offered by this Stanford en
terprise.
