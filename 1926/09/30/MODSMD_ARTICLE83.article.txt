# Paving Not Yet Started On New Tennis Courts
## 
### 
Gymnasium tennis classes will be
crowded again this year, for the eleven
new tennis courts, promised for this
fall, are still far from completed. The
ground has been leveled, and several
piles of gravel heaped about, but no
actual paving has been done.
The new courts include three which
will be used for tournament and exhi
bition purposes, around which bleach
ers seating nearly 4000 persons will be
placed. The other eight courts, which
will be placed adjacent in harmony
with the preconceived architectural
plan of the campus, will give Stanford
a total of twenty-four, which does not
include the faculty courts.
The estimated cost of the addition
is $30,000.
