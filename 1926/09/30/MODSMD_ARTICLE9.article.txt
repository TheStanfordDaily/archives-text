# NEW STANFORD DAILY ADDS TWO FEATURES TO IMPROVE PAPER
## 
### 
With this morning's issue of The
Stanford Daily, two more stops for
ward will ite noticed by readers of the
former paper, The Daily Palo Alto.
Last year the paper added another
column to its size and lias since been
a seven-column sheet. A new name
and new hour of publication are this
year's contributions. Starting with the
present issue the official student organ
of Stanford University will be The
Stanford Daily. It will be distributed
every morning to the living groups
and in the halls.
The thirty-three-year development
of the paper is interesting in that it
tells the tale of the development of
the University. Research through the
old files shows gradual but undeniable
advancement of the Daily from a
four-column edition to a seven-column.
A daily paper was the outgrowth of
a magazine known as the Palo Alto.
This publication was founded in 1891
simultaneously with the opening of
the University. Holbrook Blinn, the
actor, famous for his interpretation of
"The Bad Man," was the first editor.
During the same year, the Palo Alto
joined with (he University of Califor
nia publication, but the union became
so objectionable that it was discon
tinued.
The Daily was started in the fall of
1892 against much opposition as it
was argued there was no demand for
it, but the demand soon developed.
The page was no longer a magazine,
though it closely resembled one. There
was not attention given to top col
umns, no conception of newspaper
makeup. In 1899, the first double
column was used and a step upward
in the heads was reached. In the 1905
editions we find the first regard to
the makeup of the paper. A great step
was taken in 1914 when the paper
was increased to a five-column sheet.
In 1920 came the sixth column, and
last year another was added.
