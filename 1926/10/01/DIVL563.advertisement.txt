Visit the Young China Cafe
»v
I. jJHU :
Last night witnessed the opening of the most
unique cafe in Palo Alto.
Managed by Mr. H. N. Chui, for seventeen years
personal chef to President Wilbur, the cafe offers
a delightful variety of Chinese and American
dishes. The policy is to approach the ideal in both
cuisine and service.
The series of beautiful dining halls, situated on
the second floor of the building next to the First
National Bank, are attractively decorated in mural
paintings upon a rich orange background trimmed
in ebony black. These paintings are of the garden
spot of China, the West Lake Gardens outside of
Cosmopolitan Shanghai.
A special banquet room is provided for private
dinner parties. This room may be reserved by en
gagement.
