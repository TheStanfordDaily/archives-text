UNIVERSITY MEN
|
' University men have a
keen sense of judgment
of clothes. To recognize
a well-tailored garment
is a part of their school
ing. The trail of a needle
plied by an expert hand
is as evident to them as
it is to a custom tailor.
C^p
There is no mistaking
the amount of hand'
tailoring that has been
put into the clothes we
are now featuring for
university men. The
quality of their fabrics
and workmanship is just
as obvious as their out
standing value.
