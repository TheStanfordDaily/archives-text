# ONLY TWO ELEVENS MEET SATURDAY FOR CONFERENCE GAMES
## 
### 
Montana and the Oregon Aggies will
meet Saturday at Montana in the first
conference game of the year while all
the remaining teams spend another Sat- j
urday in practice encounters. Every team
in the conference will be in action, with
Washington State, Idaho, and Montana
making their initial appearance.
Outside the Montana-Oregon Aggie
encounter, the games that will be watched
j with most interest are the California
| Olympic Club, U.S.C.-Santa Clara, and
| the Stanford-Occidental battles. Consid-
I erable attention will be centered on the
; U.S.C.-Santa Clara game as the rela
-1 tivc strength of U.S.C. and California
' can be determined, to a certain extent,
j when the outcome is known. Last Satur
! day California defeated the Broncs 13 to
6, and with but one week's time between
! the two games, a fair comparison of both
! teams should be possible.
California doubtless has a hard battle
j ahead in the Olympic Club game. Last
year the club team gaVc the Bears a stiff
battle and will doubtless do the same this
year. Occidental, rated with Southern
: Branch as the probable contenders for
the Southern Conference title, will meet
j Stanford here.
Oregon will meet the College of the
j Pacific, Idaho will tackle Montana State,
Washington will play Willamette, and
\ Washington State will meet Idaho Col
lege in the remaining games of the
