# OCCIDKNTAL GAME LOOMS AS VARSITY'S FIRST REAL TEST
## Exendine Bringing Veteran Team North to Battle Cardinals HOLD CONFERENCE TITLE Warner Taking No Chances; Selects Strong Starting Combination 
### Jim Adams 
The Occidental Tigers, last year South
ern California Conference champions,
and coached by A. A. Exendine, a for
mer Indian player under Pop Warner at
Carlisle, will furnish the Card eleven
their first real test of the season when
the two teams come together tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in the stadium.
Last Saturday's double-header was
more of a tryout of individuals, while the
fracas tomorrow will give a fair esti
mate of the potentiality of the Stanford
team. Oxy took a 28-0 beating at the
hands of the Red Shirts last year but,
confident in the ability of their new
coach, the Tigers present a different as
pect than before. Their line-up includes
a list of veterans with several Southern
Conference stars among the number.
If Caltcc gave the Cards a close game
Saturday, fans can figure out for them
selves what Oxy might do when they
are rated down south as the unanimous
choice for taking the conference title
again. Exendine is a Warner pupil, not
only knowing the Warner system but
employing it himself. It would be the
delight of his life for the pupil to beat
the master at his own game.
Regulars Will Start
But Pop Warner is not taking the game
lightly. He has selected a starting line
up and will no doubt keep the lirst eleven
almost intact throughout the game. Hoff
man has been chosen to start at full and
his playing will be closely watched to
see if Stanford has or has not a fullback.
Hill and Murphy will start at the half
back berths, which change compromises
a different combination than usual but
which should prove the most formidable
of all. Post will start at quarter but
Millage will very likely see action also.
Hill may he kept out of the lineup due
to an infection in his arm, but if he is
in shape Warner will start him with
Murphy. In case Hill is kept out it is
probable that Bogue will answer the
opening whistle.
Pop has not changed his line and the
i three veterans, Captain Swan, Poulson,
j and Shipkey, will hold down the left
division with Robesky, Harris, and Har
der on the other side. McCreery will
| start at center.
Occidental has several players that
will bear watching. Godet and Teachout,
| ends, covered punts like hawks last year
| and any slip by the Stanford safety man
' may mean disaster with this pair on the
! job. Captain Vic Conde is a 200-pound
j tackle whose presence will be most no
ticeable before the game is over. Mishkin
j is the class of the backtield and the most
| consistent ground gainer, although Clayes
j and Buxton are fast enough to be dan
j gerous if they ever get away. The former
! is a ten flat man and a very shifty back.
Gives Line on U.S.C.
The game tomorrow will have a bear
l ing on the Pacific Coast football title
inasmuch as it will furnish a comparison
for the two most likely contenders for the
title. Two weeks after taking on the
Red Shirts. Oxy will battle the Trojans
and the showing of the two conference
elevens against the Tigers will be closely
watched. This will be the best opportun
ity offered of sizing up the relative
strength of the two teams.
