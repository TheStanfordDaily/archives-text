# The 						Conference Race
## 
### 
Nine conference football teams are on their marks for the start of
the 1926 grid race. In a trial start last Saturday which amounted to
nothing- more than a warming up, Stanford got out of the holes in good
style. The Cards are strong contestants for the title this season, with
practically the same lineup as last year when they took second place. But
Stanford has some of the best squads on the coast on its race, meeting
U.S.C., Washington, Oregon, Oregon State, and California.
Washington has suffered since last year, and they are not predicted
to break the tape again as conference winner.
The Trojan from U.S.C. is doped, by those who spend their time
doping, as a slight favorite in this football event. Veteran men and a
clever coach are largely responsible for this attitude. But to offset these
advantages, the Trojan is said to have a mental complex. They have
never won a conference race. In featured matches with such teams as Cali
fornia and Stanford the Southern California team has been badly off
form.
Oregon State, as the Aggies prefer to be called, have something up
their sleeve. They are smiling at the outcome of the present season.
Their neighbors, Oregon University, are always dangerous competitors,
and it will be recalled how they defeated the Huskies from Seattle two
years ago and how they almost repeated last season. Idaho has Charley
Erb, formerly of the California "wonder team," as its new mentor, and
they are confident. Montana is running in the role of the dark horse.
Our friends the Bears from Berkeley are not to be left out of the
race. They have a new team, which promises to be a good one by the
time the starting gun sounds.
Judges and timers, ready.
