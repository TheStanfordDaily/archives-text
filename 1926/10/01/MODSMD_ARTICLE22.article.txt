# A 						Pictorial Symbol

The need for a pictorial symbol for Stanford is constantly becoming
more pressing, from the cartoonist's standpoint, but whether or not the
name "Pioneers" should be adopted is a matter for thoughtful discussion.
As the viewpoint in yesterday's issue from Ernest Hopkins, ex-'ll, stated
—"they call Stanford the Cardinals, and you can't cartoon that; they
call them the cards and playing cards do not work into good cartoons."
On the other hand, is it necessary that the present nickname be
changed or remodeled? When an attempt to label "Indians" to the
Stanford teams a few years ago was made the whole thing failed miser
ably. The city papers refused to recognize the change, and after much
hard work and wasted energy the idea passed on to the resting place of
all other failures.
However, if a change is advisable—the name "Pioneers'' links up
with many phases of Stanford life and traditions and is a Hunch that
should be well taken. It is not improbable that someone may burst forth
with a name exactly fitting.
