With the opening of this quarter the graduate students arc being
charged the $10 community fee for the first time. It is mainly a question
of paying for the privileges which they have received in years past, and
the Associated Students are well justified in having this fee required of
graduates.
Among the things covered in the fee arc tickets to all the games and
subscription to the Daily. Formerly the graduates had no trouble in
borrowing a student body card to use at the game or in getting the paper.
Thus it is only fair and just that they should be charged for all the
advantages which go with membership in the student body.
