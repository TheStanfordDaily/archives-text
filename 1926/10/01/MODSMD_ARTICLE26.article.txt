# THE 						BULL SESSION

### 
Consider now the honor system
pledge. What, if anything, is its signifi
cance? We are told that the idea of
asking all entering students to sign
a statement that they understood the
honor system was inaugurated be
cause of the difficulty arising out of
the fact that potential criminals
brought before the student councils
offered the defense that they did not
know what the honor system meant.
If one reads the plan of the honor
system is becomes apparent immedi
ately that in the entire plan very
little consideration is taken of honor.
As a matter of fact, the honor system
merely means that the student body
assumes the responsibility of catching
its own violators, lifting this odious
burden off the shoulders of a faculty
already overloaded with unpleasant
tasks.
To date, the system has worked per
fectly whenever there were enough
students watching each other. In ex
aminations, very few students cheat.
It is almost impossible, and the faculty
knows it. Outside of the classroom,
however, there is no way of really
checking up on this honor business,
and suspicion is oftentimes rife that
someone's work is not as original as
it might be.
As a result, we have this farcical
pledge, to the effect that if a man
violates the honor system, he will ad
minister the boot to himself. Neat,

isn't it? Like shaving the back of
your own neck.

Why not a little frankness? Why
not admit that honor is a deep and
fundamental quality, and that a man
or woman either has it or hasn't it,
depending, largely, upon the environ
ment of the individual.
As a matter of fact there is a large
degree of honor visible in the way in
which Stanford men and women con
duct their classwork. This is not at
tributable to any "system" however
good the intentions of that system's
originators. Instead, this happy state
of affairs is attributable to the fact
that we have a limited enrollment at
Stanford, and a large list of appli
cants. Consequently it is possible to
choose the upper crust of prep school
graduates, those who are interested in
their work, and who are not likely to
cheat. Furthermore, Stanford men and
women, as a rule, come from good
families, the older families with alum
ni in them, and the families in which
interest in culture and education runs
high enough to result in sending the
children to college.
All of this is a far cry from "sys
tems" and signed pledges. It would be
interesting to see the real value of this
"system." May we propose that it be
tested upon a selected crew of Fed
eral Prohibition Agents or United
States Senators? —S. O'D.
