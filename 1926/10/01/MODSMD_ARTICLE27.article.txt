# U.S.C.-SANTA CLARA PLAY TOMORROW ON LOS ANGELES FIELD
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30.â€”1t will be
the Thundering Herd against the Buck
ing Broncos here in the Coliseum tomor
row.
Having stampeded to a 74 to 0 victory
over Whittier in its first game of the
season, Southern California's varsity will
attempt to subdue the broncos from
Santa Clara. If news irom the north is
authentic, this is going to be quite some
task for the Trojans as the ambitious
Santa Clara team nearly defeated the
Goiden licar last Saturday.
Adam Walsh brings a veteran squad
south this year, a squad that is playing
its second year under his brilliant tute
lage. Although the Trojans defeated the
Broncos 28 to 9 last season, Coach Jones
says that Santa Clara had one of the
strongest teams on the S.C. schedule.
The Trojans will gain much experience
of the Notre Dame type of play from
the Broncos. Against the Bears, the
Santa Clara attack was both highly col
orful and dangerous. Short, snappy
passes, quick kicks, and deceptive run
ning formations kept the Bears in a quan
dary all during the second half. South
ern California will be better prepared
to defend the prestige of the West
against Notre Dame here on December
4 as a result of this game.
Coach Howard Jones is planning to
send in his strongest aggregation against
Santa Clara. Several changes in last
Saturday's lineup are certain to come.
Johnny Fox, the giant sophomore, will
probably be seen at tackle instead of
Kenneth Cox. Fox has been substituting
for Cravath at center, but his defensive
play is so strong that he can't be kept
on the bench. James Mosier will prob
ably play end instead of A1 Behrendt.
The big Trojan wingman was injured
against Whittier.
