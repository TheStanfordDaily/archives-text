# CALIFORNIA WORKS ON DEFENSE FROM AIR LINE ATTACKS

### 
BERKELEY, Sept. 30.—Development
of a defense for forward passes and more
secure protection for the kicker were
outstanding accomplishments of the Uni
versity of California football practice
the early part of the week.
Coach "Nibs" Price put his men
through light scrimmages to bring out
and emphasize the many faults that were
so evident in the Santa Clara contest.
The first team backtield, composed of
Captain Griffin, fullback, Jabs and Per
rin, halfbacks, and Blewett, quarter, were
put through signal practice with Marcus
and Clymer alternating for Blewett and
Perrin.
Saturday's game versus the Olympic
Club will see the Bruin varsity fortified
with a more varied attack and several
probable changes in the first eleven. The
playing of the wingmen in the initial tilt
of the season was far from satisfactory,
according to Price's way of thinking, and
means to correct faults in the play are
being sought by the Bruin coach.
