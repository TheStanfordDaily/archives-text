## 
### 
More than twenty candidates reported
for the initial tryout period according to
Professor Whitney Martin, director of
the Stanford Rand, at the conclusion of
the first meeting Thursday afternoon.
The tryout period will be continued bri
day afternoon from 1 to S p.m. and Sat
urday morning from ( > to 12. After the
Saturday meeting prospective bandmen
may try out for the band by making an
appointment with Professor Martin. All
of the- tryouts will be conducted in the
bandhouse, which is located on Arguello
avenue near the Military Department.
Practice will commence Tuesday after
noon at 4:15 and will continue as last
year on Thursdays and Tuesdays. This
year the band will practice in one body
during football season so that a part of
the time can be spent in drilling prepara
tory to appearances at games. Later in
the year the band will be divided as last
year into an afternoon and evening band
to facilitate instruction.
Professor Martin plans to greatly en
large the reed section of the band. This
will be noticed principally in the clarinet
section, which was composed of eighteen
members last year and this year will be
enlarged to thirty members. "The size of
the band this year will depend largely
upon the number of reeds available,"
said Professor Martin. "We plan to
have a band of ninety-six men if possible,
but not unless we can get a reed section
of the proper size."
Freshmen and transfers who play band
instruments of «any kind are urged to
attend the tryout period Friday and Sat
urday so that practice may begin prompt
ly on Tuesday afternoon. Clarinets are
particularly needed.
