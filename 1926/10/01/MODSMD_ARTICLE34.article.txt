# Self-Supporting Students May Borrow Free Books
## 
### 
Free texts and reference books for the
use of students earning their own ex
penses may now be obtained from the
Robert F. Stever Memorial Library in
the Appointment Office. A large variety
of books is available and no definite limit
is set on the time for which they may be
borrowed.
The loan library, which now contains
671 volumes, was established by Robert
F. Stever, a self-supporting Stanford stu
dent, who had himself felt the need of
such an institution. The first book do
nated, which was one designed to help
discouraged boys, was a gift of the
founder.
Last year 526 books were lent by the
library. As even greater demands are
expected this year, all students having
text books which they are willing to give
to the library are asked to get in touch
with the Appointment Office as soon as
possible.
