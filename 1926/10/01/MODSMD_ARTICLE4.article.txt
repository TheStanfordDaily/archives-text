# MALONEY BACK TO RESUME DIRECTION OF MINOR SPORTS
## Coach Spends Year's Leave Studying Therapy at San Francisco 
### 
Harry W. Maluney, Director of Minor
Sports, who was absent last year on
leave, assumed his duties here again to- j
day. Maloney spent the past year as a |
special worker in the Department of
Physical Therapy at the Stanford Hospi
tal in San Francisco urider the super
vision of Dr. Harry Lartgnecker, associ
ate clinical professor of orthopedic sur
gery.
Maloney was re-elected president of
the Pacific Athletic Association of the
A.A.U. last week in San Francisco. This \
association is the largest athletic organi- j
zation in the West and during Maloney's j
term of office enjoyed a most progres- j
sive year.
According to Maloney it is now the!
intention of his department to install a!
course in orthopedic gymnastics. This!
course would include the study of the
cases of fallen arches, curvatures, and j
slight cases of general paralysis that fre-;
quently come to the attention of the de- j
partment among the students. Such a I
course would make it possible for af- I
dieted Stanford students to be treated!
at school.
This year's minor sport program will
be one of the most extensive in Stan
ford's history, according to Maloney.
Soccer is now foremost on the program,
with three varsity games scheduled with j
California as well as many others. The j
last game will be played 011 the morning
of the Big Game while the freshmen will j
tangle with the Bruin babes on the morn-!
ing of the Little Big Game.
The boxing program will include the j
Far Western Amateur Boxing Contest j
to be held in San Francisco on November |
1 and 2, and includes also Northern and j
Southern California, Washington, Ore
gon, and Nevada. It will be held under
the auspices of the A.A.U.
