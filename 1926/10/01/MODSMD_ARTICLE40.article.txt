# WARREN D.ALLEN TO GIVE FIRST CONCERT SUNDAY AFTERNOON
## University Organist Will Present Initial Fall Quarter Program 
### Herb Klein 
Warren D. Allen, Stanford University
organist, will give the first recital of the
quarter in the Memorial Church, Sunday
afternoon at 4:00 o'clock. Mr. Allen has
returned from an extended tour of Eng
land and the continent, during which he
gave a number of concerts on several of
Europe's noted organs.
The program for Sunday is identical
with one played by Mr. Allen at St. Mar
garet's in Westminster, London, on July
17. It is noteworthy for its wide selec
tion of numbers, representing the best
organ composers of the classical, roman
tic, and modern schools. Three choral
preludes are included from the works of
John Sebastian Bach, greatest master of
the polyphonic style of music and the
father of modern organ playing. These
are musical settings of hymns of t.ie
German Lutheran church, of which Bach
was a devout member, and for which he
wrote some of his most exalted music.
The three chosen for Sunday are: "Re
joice Now," "Adorn Thyself, My Soul,
with Gladness," and "In Thee Is Joy."
"Fantasia in D Flat, Opus 101" is from
the pen of Camille Saint-Saens, one of
the most distinguished of recent French
composers. Like all the music of this
composer, the Fantasia exhibits the Gallic
feeling for form and a certain deftness
and elegance in handling. Edward Shipen
Barnes, a modern composer, is repre
sented by "Scherzo," from his "Sympho
nic, Opus 18."
No musician ever had a finer flow of
melodic inspiration than Franz Schubert,
whose "Litany" will be one of the final
numbers. Louis Vierne, at present the
noted organist of Notre Dame Cathedral
in Paris, is the composer of the "Ca
rillon" or "Bell Song" which will close
the program. This number is taken from
an opus, "Four Pieces in Free Style," by
Vierne, who numbers among his teachers
of organ two of the greatest masters of
the art, Charles Marie Widor and Cesar
F ranck.
There will be no further organ recitals
in the Memorial Church until a week
from Sunday. Following this, the regu
lar schedule of Tuesday, Thursday, and
Sunday afternoon recitals will be started
by Mr. Allen.

land and the continent, during which he
gave a number of concerts on several of
Europe's noted organs.
The program for Sunday is identical
with one played by Mr. Allen at St. Mar
garet's in Westminster, London, on July
17. It is noteworthy for its wide selec
tion of numbers, representing the best
organ composers of the classical, roman
tic, and modern schools. Three choral
preludes are included from the works of
John Sebastian Bach, greatest master of
the polyphonic style of music and the
father of modern organ playing. These
are musical settings of hymns of t.ie
German Lutheran church, of which Bach
was a devout member, and for which he
wrote some of his most exalted music.
The three chosen for Sunday are: "Re
joice Now," "Adorn Thyself, My Soul,
with Gladness," and "In Thee Is Joy."
"Fantasia in D Flat, Opus 101" is from
the pen of Camille Saint-Saens, one of
the most distinguished of recent French
composers. Like all the music of this
composer, the Fantasia exhibits the Gallic
feeling for form and a certain deftness
and elegance in handling. Edward Shipen
Barnes, a modern composer, is repre
sented by "Scherzo," from his "Sympho
nic, Opus 18."
No musician ever had a finer flow of
melodic inspiration than Franz Schubert,
whose "Litany" will be one of the final
numbers. Louis Vierne, at present the
noted organist of Notre Dame Cathedral
in Paris, is the composer of the "Ca
rillon" or "Bell Song" which will close
the program. This number is taken from
an opus, "Four Pieces in Free Style," by
Vierne, who numbers among his teachers
of organ two of the greatest masters of
the art, Charles Marie Widor and Cesar
F ranck.
There will be no further organ recitals
in the Memorial Church until a week
from Sunday. Following this, the regu
lar schedule of Tuesday, Thursday, and
Sunday afternoon recitals will be started
by Mr. Allen.
