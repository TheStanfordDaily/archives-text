# TICKET ORDERS FOR STANFORD CONCERT SERIES POURING IN
## Graveure, Stanford Favorite, To Give First Recital On October 28 
### Herb Klein 
Orders for season tickets for the Stan
ford Concert Series are pouring in on
Wilfrid Davis, student manager of the
series. Music lovers of Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, and all towns up and down the
Peninsula are taking advantage of the
chance to hear the five concerts during
the coming year to he given by soloists
and instrumental groups of international
fame. Stanford students and faculty are
able to get the $4.00 season tickets at the
special rate of $3.00. All students who
signed the pledge cards at the end of the
last spring quarter are urged to mail
checks in to Davis, Box 1151, as soon as
the call comes out.
As far as it has been possible to de
termine, the Stanford Concert Series will
be the most notable venture of its kind
ever planned by a university. Other col
leges have had artist series, but none
have had such a distinguished group of
musicians as that which will appear in
the Stanford Basketball Pavilion at vari
ous dates during the coming year. The
complete success of the concerts this year
is essential in order that the series may
become an annual feature, to the greater
glory of Stanford.
On October 28, Louis Graveure, bari
tone, who has been universally given the
title "distinguished," will open the series.
Ever since his appearance several years
ago in the title role of Mendelssohn's
oratorio "Elijah," as given by Stanford
in the Stadium, Graveure has been popu
lar here, and his appearance will be!
looked forward to. He has a repertoire
of over 500 songs in French, Italian,
German, and English. Graveure is above
all a singer of intelligence and feeling
disciplined by the finest artistry.
Other events are: the Mischa Elman
String Quartette on Tuesday, November
16; the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, Wednesday, December 18; Rosa
Ponsclle, eminent soprano, Thursday
night, March .3; and Tito Schipa, famous
tenor, Thursday night, March 31.
Satisfaction has been expressed all
over the University that the concerts arc I
to become an actuality, and that they j
will he presented by and for the Associ
ated Students. Stanford has at times in
the past been charged with a lack of
appreciation for the better things. An
annual series of musical events of this
caliber would go far toward disproving
such a statement.

Ever since his appearance several years
ago in the title role of Mendelssohn's
oratorio "Elijah," as given by Stanford
in the Stadium, Graveure has been popu
lar here, and his appearance will be!
looked forward to. He has a repertoire
of over 500 songs in French, Italian,
German, and English. Graveure is above
all a singer of intelligence and feeling
disciplined by the finest artistry.
Other events are: the Mischa Elman
String Quartette on Tuesday, November
16; the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, Wednesday, December 18; Rosa
Ponsclle, eminent soprano, Thursday
night, March .3; and Tito Schipa, famous
tenor, Thursday night, March 31.
Satisfaction has been expressed all
over the University that the concerts arc I
to become an actuality, and that they j
will he presented by and for the Associ
ated Students. Stanford has at times in
the past been charged with a lack of
appreciation for the better things. An
annual series of musical events of this
caliber would go far toward disproving
such a statement.
Orders for season tickets for the Stan
ford Concert Series are pouring in on
Wilfrid Davis, student manager of the
series. Music lovers of Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, and all towns up and down the
Peninsula are taking advantage of the
chance to hear the five concerts during
the coming year to he given by soloists
and instrumental groups of international
fame. Stanford students and faculty are
able to get the $4.00 season tickets at the
special rate of $3.00. All students who
signed the pledge cards at the end of the
last spring quarter are urged to mail
checks in to Davis, Box 1151, as soon as
the call comes out.
As far as it has been possible to de
termine, the Stanford Concert Series will
be the most notable venture of its kind
ever planned by a university. Other col
leges have had artist series, but none
have had such a distinguished group of
musicians as that which will appear in
the Stanford Basketball Pavilion at vari
ous dates during the coming year. The
complete success of the concerts this year
is essential in order that the series may
become an annual feature, to the greater
glory of Stanford.
