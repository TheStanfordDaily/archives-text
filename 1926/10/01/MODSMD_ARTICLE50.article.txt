# Sophomores Eligible for 1927 Yearbook Competition
## 
### 
Tryoutees for managerial positions on
the 1927 Quad, Stanford's yearbook, are
urged to sign up immediately in the
1 rophy Room, Old Union. All members
of the sophomore class, women as well
as men, are urged to try out by Robert
Paradise, Quad manager for the coming
year.
Four salaried positions are open and
will be filled at the end of the year from
those who have tried out. The point
system is used entirely in ranking the
tryoutees. No previous experience is
necessary, according to the manager.
All tryoutees will be on an equal basis
as the Quad's work is just beginning.
