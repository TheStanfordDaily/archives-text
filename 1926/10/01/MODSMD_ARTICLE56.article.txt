Evolutionists are agog over the
giant saurians recently captured and
brought to New York by a special
scientific expedition. Eight feet in
length, covered with alligator skin,
armed with heavy claws, carniverous
by nature, and able to assume upright
posture with ease, they are thought to
be the original model for the famous
Chinese dragon, which they so closely
resemble.
