# BLUE AND GOLD TEAM LOOKS STRONG IN FIRST PRACTICES
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Sept. 30.—California has
the makings of one of the best freshman
football teams to represent the university
in years.
Coach "Clint" Evans is literally over
whelmed with material. His principal
work is sorting it out, giving each man
a chance in the lineup and determining
the best backfield combination.
Football fans had their first look at
the yearlings Saturday when they downed
San Bernardino High 40-0 in the prelimi
nary to the Varsity-Santa Clara game.
San Bernardino was not as weak as
might be judged from the score, but they
had a hard-hitting, well-coached team,
who were helpless against the tricky
freshman backs.
Eisan, Lom, Pito, and Thornton start
ed behind the line for the frosh but their
positions are by no means assured. Rice,
Bruno, Chandler, and Allan all showed
up well and the starting eleven against
the Mare Island Sailors next Saturday
may include one or more of these men.
The Cubs will have an opportunity to
test their strength against some real op
position Wednesday afternoon at the first
bleacher rally, where they are scheduled
to scrimmage with the varsity.
