# COACH E.P. HUNT TO DIVIDE SQUAD TOR GRID GAMES
## Polytechnic to Meet First Babe Aggregation in Saturday's Game 
### Joe Carroll 
Tomorrow morning Coach Husky
Hunt will divide his freshman football
squad into two outfits. What will be
called the first freshman team will
battle the California Polytechnic
eleven at 12:30 as a preliminary to the
Varsity-Occidental College encounter.
The second team will meet the war
riors from the Cogswell High School
on the practice field at 10 a.m.
The Polytechnic organization comes
up from San Luis Obispo with what
is reputed to be a strong aggregation
of football players. Last year the Stan
ford Grays played this team a tie
game. Coach Hunt is expecting a lot
of opposition during the early part of
tomorrow afternoon, when the men
who have been chosen to play on the
first freshman eleven meet the boys
from the South. The game should be
fast and hard-fought.
After practice last night Hunt said
that no one could expect any set of
men schooled in different types of
football to start functioning smoothly
at the beginning of the season. "But,"
he added, "the boys are certainly will
ing to work hard."
Commencing with the two combats
Saturday, the second freshman squad
will have a separate schedule. They
are to meet the Cogswell and Mo
desto high schools on successive Sat
urday mornings, and other games will
be arranged as the season progresses.
After the smoke of the battle has
cleared away from the various grid
irons and Coach Hunt has had a sec
ond* opportunity to see how all of his
men perform under fire, cuts and
changes may be expected. However,
in case the men play the sort of game
that will serve to vindicate Hunt's
judgment, the coach will go ahead
rapidly in developing a greater amount
of teamwork and co-operation in the
men who are to represent the fresh
man class against the Bruin Cubs.

for the first squad freshmen:

Tomorrow morning Coach Husky
Hunt will divide his freshman football
squad into two outfits. What will be
called the first freshman team will
battle the California Polytechnic
eleven at 12:30 as a preliminary to the
Varsity-Occidental College encounter.
The second team will meet the war
riors from the Cogswell High School
on the practice field at 10 a.m.
The Polytechnic organization comes
up from San Luis Obispo with what
is reputed to be a strong aggregation
of football players. Last year the Stan
ford Grays played this team a tie
game. Coach Hunt is expecting a lot
of opposition during the early part of
tomorrow afternoon, when the men
who have been chosen to play on the
first freshman eleven meet the boys
from the South. The game should be
fast and hard-fought.
After practice last night Hunt said
that no one could expect any set of
men schooled in different types of
football to start functioning smoothly
at the beginning of the season. "But,"
he added, "the boys are certainly will
ing to work hard."
Commencing with the two combats
Saturday, the second freshman squad
will have a separate schedule. They
are to meet the Cogswell and Mo
desto high schools on successive Sat
urday mornings, and other games will
be arranged as the season progresses.
After the smoke of the battle has
cleared away from the various grid
irons and Coach Hunt has had a sec
ond* opportunity to see how all of his
men perform under fire, cuts and
changes may be expected. However,
in case the men play the sort of game
that will serve to vindicate Hunt's
judgment, the coach will go ahead
rapidly in developing a greater amount
of teamwork and co-operation in the
men who are to represent the fresh
man class against the Bruin Cubs.
