# TIME FOR CHANGING COURSES SHORTENED
## 
### 
Students will do well to settle
their courses at the earliest pos
sible date, because the period in
which study programs may be
changed without petition or fee
has been shortened from three
weeks to two.
Hereafter also a fee of $2 will
be charged without petition or fee
has been shortened from three
weeks to two.
Hereafter also a fee of $2 will
be charged for dropping a course
as well as the fee of $2 hitherto
imposed for taking up a new
course. Thus a change from one
course to another after the two
week period will cost the student
a total of $4 .
