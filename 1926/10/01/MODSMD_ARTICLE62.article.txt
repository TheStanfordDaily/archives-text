# TROPIC HEAT ALTERS WHITE MAN'S BLOOD SAYS U.C. PROFESSOR
## 
### 
Following intermitten investigations
carried on in the coastal tropic belt of
New Queensland, Australia, during the
past six years, E. S. Sundstroem, As
sistant Professor of Biochemistry at
the University of California, has pub
lished a treatise tending to demon
strate that hot climates bring about
important changes in the physiological
makeup of the white man.
These findings contradict opinions
formerly advanced that disease and
faulty diet are the only obstacles to
tropical settlement by the white man.
Professor Sundstroem says, in speak- 1
ing of his work:
"
"Some of these data, collected as
they were with all possible care, bear |
evidence that the climatic factor must
be reckoned with in the determina
tion of the welfare of the white race
in the tropics, although the writer
harbors 110 illusions regarding the
finality of his conclusions."
1
The effect of heat is indirect, accord- J
ing to Professor Sundstroem. That is,
the cooling power of the white man
is not sufficient to keep his body at
normal temperature. As a result, adap
tation and adjustment take place. The
body taxes one heat dissipating sys
tem, perspiration, to the limit, drain
ing the water resources of the body.
"It is conceivable that in conse
quence of this profuse perspiration the !
burden and the risk of breakdown will |
only be shifted from the regulation of j
heat to that of water. The writer feels I
confident that important phases of
tropical adaptation will become intel
ligible when once the now obscure
question of water regulation is cleared
up."
Most of the work Professor Sund
stroem did in the field was accom
plished in 1920-22 in Townsville, Au
stralia. He measured, among other
physiological changes in man, the
growth of body, fingernails, and hair, i
the sugar, phosphorus, and liquid con-'
stituents of the blood, and many other
phenomena. Later he checked up on |
the results by observing the physiolo
gical changes in rats subjected to
artificial tropic conditions. These sec
ond results corroborated the first as
far as the experiment went.
