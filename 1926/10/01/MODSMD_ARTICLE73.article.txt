# DON'TS TO REDUCE FIRE HAZARD LISTED BY CHIEF R.E. DUGAN
## Marshal Warns Students Against Carelessness; Gives Four Rules 
### 
Four "don'ts" for fire prevention were
given to the Stanford Daily last night
by Fire Chief R. E. Dugan in order to
keep down the fire hazard in the Uni
versity. They are:
"Don't throw away lighted cigarette
stubs on the waste lands of the campus.
Most fires start because somebody was
not sure.
"Don't leave useless paper or waste
material in rooms. That is tempting fire.
"Don't throw lighted matches or smok
ing stubs on the tloor. Be courteous. It
pays as well as helping to prevent fires.
"Don't use more than one double socket
with an electric light connection and then
have the janction of the proper authori
ties. Wires that cannot stand the load
can start a fire in any part of a building."
Continuing he said that most fires arc
caused by carelessness, especially on the
part of those who smoke in casting away
their smoking stubs and ashes, be it on
the campus or in their own rooms.
"Many fellows lay their lighted cigar
ettes on the edge of the table and uncon
sciously push them off into the waste
paper basket that may be directly be
neath and, of course, the result is only
too apparent. The remedy for this is to
have a definite container for smoking
that is absolutely fireproof.
"Another fire hazard is the connecting
of more double sockets to an electric
light connection than the wires can carry,
and if the load is too great the wires
will burn out, thus causing a fire. The
proper authorities should be consulted
before any attempt is made to hook up
more connections than are already to
be found, and then if it is all right a
qualified electrician should do the work.
"I personally request that all house
mnagers pay special attention that all
waste paper and waste material be
cleared up as soon as possible and some
time next week I will inspect all houses
to sec that this is done. This should also
apply to everyone rooming in the various
halls."
Concluding, Fire Marshal Dugan said,
"Most people are willing to co-operate
to fight the fire hazard, but carelessness
and lack of common courtesy still cause
most of the fires."
