# LAWRENCE C. PERRY INSPECTS STANFORD FOOTBALL MATERIAL
## 
### 
Pop Warner is the greatest football
coach in the country in the opinion of
Lawrence C. Perry, national gridiron
critic, who visited Stanford yesterday !
afternoon on his annual fall inspection
trip of American college football teams. !
"Warner," stated Mr. Perry, "has done j
more than any other coach to develop the j
offensive side of the game. His origi- j
nality and initiative are remarkable. Sev- j
eral times during my present journey j
different coaches have very obligingly
but guardedly described to me as new
plays which Warner not only first
plucked from the bag, but which he dis
carded seasons ago in favor of his more
modern developments.
"In the matter of tricks," continued
the Associated Press representative, "Pop
is a past master. In fact, his strategy has
necessitated most of the present legisla
tion on this matter. His famous hidden
ball hoax on Harvard, in which one of
his Indians concealed the ball in the back
of his sweater, thus scoring the only
points of the day, is one of the classical
football jokes on that famous college.
"The following year Warner appeared
on the field with an imitation football
sewed to the shirt of every member of
his team. This time Houghton, famous
Crimson coach, was equal to the emer
gency. 'Take those things off your
sweaters, Warner,' he said, 'or I will
paint the ball red.' "
Football teams of first-class universi
ties show little difference in ability sec
tionally, according to Mr. Perry. East
ern colleges receive more carefully
trained material, but the superior Coast
climate, combined with the larger size
of the men, seems to equalize matters.
Stanford is but one of the numerous
universities lying on Mr. Perry's itiner
ary. Leaving New York early in Septem
ber, he first visited extensively in the
Missouri Valley, going thence to the
Rocky Mountain region. For the last
week he has been ruminating in Califor
nia, leaving tomorrow for Oregon,
Washington, and then east through Mon
tana, Minnesota, and Illinois, returning
to New York October 15.
