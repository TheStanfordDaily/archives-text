# 1930 TO MEET SOPHOMORES IN MUD STRUGGLE
## Rival Classes to Fight on Lake Bottom Wednesday At 3:30 O'clock STRICT RULES IN FORCE Sponsors, Block "S" Men to Police Field, Enforce Regulations 
### 
Sophomores and freshmen will of
ficially give vent to the spirit of
rivalry which pervades the two groups
of lowerclass men at the opening of
the year when they mix next Wednes
day afternoon in the annual mud fight.
The event will take place at 3:30
o'clock in the burr-infested bottom of
Lake Lagunita, south of Roble Hall.
Charles Dickenson heads a commit
tee of Block "S" men and senior spon
sors who will police the field and en
force the rules of the contest. Dicken
son will outline the eight command
ments governing the fight at an as
sembly of the freshmen in the lobby
of Encina Hall tonight. Ward Hill,
Mickey Hobro, and Merrill Armour are
the committeemen.
The rules this year are more strin
gent than those which were used for
merly. The chief departure is the
stipulation by the committee that no
foreign matter shall be introduced into
either of the mud pits. This will pre
vent the unpleasantness of the prac
tice of contaminating the pure mud
with oils and greases. Infraction
against this rule will result in for
feiture by the offending side.
The pits will be located about 75
•yards apart and will probably be of
the usual size, 10 by 20 feet, with a
depth of about three feet. A special
arena is to be roped off for the recep
tion of the victims after they undergo
immersion. The sophomores will as
semble in front of the north pit and
the freshmen in front of the south,
and at the starting signal each side
will advance and attempt to duck its
opponents in the pit from which the
opponents started.
The complete rules, as they will be
outlined to the freshmen tonight, are
.as follows:
1. The fight shall begin promptly at
3:30 o'clock, October 6, at Lake Lagu
nita .
2. The sophomores and freshmen
shall assemble en masse in front of
their respective pits—the sophomores
taking the north pit and the freshmen
the south.
3. At the starting signal each side
shall endeavor to throw the opposi
tion into the mud pit from which the
opposition started —i.e., the men are
