## 
### 
Sophomores will not raid En
cina Hall on the eve of the mud
fight, as has been a custom for
the past few years, as a result of
a recent ruling by the administra
tion and the Men's Council. This
fact was stressed last night by
Stanley Weigel, president of the
A.S.S.U., when he announced the
rules for the fight which will be
held Wednesday afternoon.

Last year considerable wreck
age was left in the wake of the
raiders, and it was decided to do
away with this unnecessary loss
by damage to the interior of the
hall. The sponsors in the hall
have been instructed to watch for
any kind of an invasion and are
to report any infractions of this
rule to the Men's Council.

There is a serious possibility
that the mud fight may be can
celled if the rules are violated,
according to Weigel.
