### 
Declaring that the modern Junior
- College is essential in preparing the
student for university life, President
j Wilbur opened a two-day state con
ference of the state department of
j education in Berkeley Friday.
President Wilbur told the educators
that "today's younger generation rip
i ens much earlier than those of former
years, and that it should be allowed
l to become mature at home, in junior
colleges, rather than in larger institu
tions.
j "The underclassmen of the univer
: sity today are engaged in preparing
themselves for advanced work, and
; getting a perspective on themselves
and their surroundings," stated Presi
dent Wilbur. "It is this work that the
i junior college should undertake, and
the university should not have to con
cern itself with these elementary col
| legiate problems.
"Another purpose of the junior col
lege is to serve a vocational guidance
I function, and to take care of high
school pupils who have not been
recommended," continued Dr. Wilbur.
In conclusion, he stated that "the
junior college is the only educational
: machine fitted to meet present-day
social and educational forces, and that
California junior college should be
kept open to students from other
states to maintain our national scope
in that field."
W. W. Campbell, president of the
j University of California, also ad-
I dressed the body, discussing the ten
dency of the junior colleges to expand

:E. P. Clarke of the state board of
