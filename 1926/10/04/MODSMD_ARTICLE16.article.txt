# ROOTERS WORRY AS BALL HOVERS NEAR OXY FIVE-YARD LINE
## Grandstand Critics Unjustly Blame Hank Millage for Poor Generalship 
### Steve O'Donnell 
A football field is one hundred yards i
long. It takes a team but a few short j
minutes to cover ninety-five of them, j
but it takes years to do that last five
yards. Ask any rooter for any college
varsity in the country. He will tell
you that men have grown grey while
a quarterback stood under the shadow
of his opponents' goal posts and
scratched his head.
From this, it is easy to deduce that
the last five yards in a march to the
goal are of paramount importance. As
the smart advertising man would say,
"a touchdown should be made with- j
out them."
Saturday, when Stanford met, and [
defeated, Occidental, it was this mat
ter of the last five yards that kept
Cardinal rooters (and it is safe to
guess, Cardinal Coaches) anxious.
Stanford could gain almost at will in !
midfield. And while Hoffman was in, i
could apparently gain at the goal. But
on two separate occasions, Stanford j
got inside the five-yard line, and failed !
to score.
In one instance, the grandstand j
quarterbacks were inclined to blame ;
Hank Millage for hitting the line. This
is not fair to Millage. Consider that j
Occidental has two ends that compare j
favorably with any on the Coast, and !
you have a pretty fair idea of !
reaction to the self-propounded sug
gestion to run the ends. Remember
that the ball was on the three-yard
line, and that a pass would have gone
over the goal line, whence, if incom- ;
plete, it would have come out twenty j
yards. It is one thing to lose the ball i
on downs, and quite another to lose |
twenty yards to boot.
On the other occasion, Patchett I
failed by inches to score. Granted that'
a complete rest for the half-dozen
the Occidental line, which had enjoyed
preceding plays, stiffened at this criti
cal juncture, it is still a regrettable
matter that Patchett failed by inches
i to put the ball where it. belongedâ€”
: which was over the goal line.
No one could say that the showing
! made Saturday was unsatisfactory, in j
view of the three scores made. At the
same time, one can hardly write home ,
about a Stanford varsity that is held
\ twice in the % same afternoon within
i easy scoring distance of an Occidental
goal line.
| The fault is probably attributable to
j the fact that the season is yet young,
1 and that Warner teams are known to
, develop slowly. In the past, this sys
j tem has brought good results, and has
j enabled "Pop" to defeat teams that
j made whirlwind early-season starts.
In these early-season games, how
: ever, this lack of a scoring punch can- !
not help but bring out cold sweat on
the brow of many a staunch Stanford
i rooter.
