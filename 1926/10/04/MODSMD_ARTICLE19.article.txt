### Jim Adams 
The Stanford-Occidental game last
Saturday afternoon was featured by
; fumbles, a 95-yard run by Tom Work,
a 60-yard sprint by Dick Hyland, and
a well-acted part of a fullback by Biff
Hoffman. The power of the Redshirts
was more visionary than real, but its
future existence is undeniable if
properly harnessed. The final score
I was 19 to 0.
Stanford earned two touchdowns,
the first being scored by Hoffman fol
lowing an exchange of fumbles four
: minutes after the game started, and
I the second by Walker after Sims had
gained 40 yards by a pass from Hyland
and a subsequent 25-yard run. The
third was handed to them in the form
I of an intercepted pass after Oxy had
1 advanced half the length of the field to
112 the 7-yard line where Work grabbed
the ball from the waiting arms of
Teachout and ran 95 yards to his
j goal line. Patchett failed by six inches
! from making another touchdown and
j two more were lost by fumbles and
penalties on which charges Stanford
: was guilty six times on each count.
Hoffman came through in good style,
making some nice gains with the aid
;of the line which was opening large
holes. He backed the line well and
performed all around in promising
manner except for his punts which did
i not average 35 yards and were too
I low.
Sims reeled off some long runs and
j in general turned in a good game at
i half for a sdphomore. He played near
-1 lv three quarters, Hill being out with
' an infected arm and Bogue nursing a
bad leg. Hylaijd brought the crowd to
its feet when he caught the ball on
the kick-off at the opening of the
second half and sprinted straight
down the side lines for 60 yards. Mur
phy's playing was strong and consist
ent except for a little mishandling of
the ball.
Post and Millage ran the team with
about equal ability with the latter
doing a little more effective work on
the ends and tackles. Walker looked
better at end than he did at full where
he moved when Patchett was relieved
from the position in the
third quarter. The line allowed Oxy
very little ground to advance upon
and ripped open large holes when
called upon, Captain Swan, Harris,
and Shipkey figuring prominently in
the work of the forward wall.
Teachout, Godet, and Captain Conde
figured largely in the playing of the
Tigers, with Clayes, who played on
the Stanford frosh team three years
ago, and the Schwiezer brothers also
making their presenec known.
