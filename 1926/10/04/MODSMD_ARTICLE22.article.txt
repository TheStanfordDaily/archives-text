The highway crossing at the entrance of Palm Drive is constantly
becoming more of a menace to human welfare and the personal appear
ance of automobile fenders. The situation has been partially remedied
by the inauguration of a boulevard stop on the Palo Alto side of the
highway, but as yet there has been no regulation placed on the other
side of the intersection. Where is the logic of stopping on 1 one side of
a road and not on the other?
Obviously, one reason for the peculiar situation is that Palo Alto has
adopted the safety system throughout the city, and this includes only
one side of the crossing under discussion. The other side, which is
on University property, was not affected by the Palo Alto ruling.
And this unprotected side is the greater menace of the two —the walls
and shrubbery on both sides of the entrance make it practically im
possible for autoists leaving the campus to see cars approaching from
either direction on the highway. Without a doubt any driver would be
more than glad to observe a sign asking cars to stop; for the majority
are careful, but they need some incentive when it comes to stopping at
an intersection.
The time lost in this manner seldom amounts to more than twenty
seconds, and surely this can mean nothing considering that an untimely
dash across the highway may result in anything from a short rest in
the hospital to an unending reposee in a rather confining wooden box.
The University could easily remedy this situation with a little paint
and labor. It certainly must be a matter that has been unintentionally
overlooked.
