# The 						Sophomore Raid Passes
## 
### 
Last year witnessed the passing of the Sophomore raid on Encina
Hall—it was too costly. A flood of enthusiastic second-year men had
surged through the corridors leaving considerable wreckage in its wake,
and as a result the invading class is still wondering how it is going to
pay the debt.
But the mere worry over finances will not always keep a class of
sophomores in a conservative train of thought, so the Men's Council
has decided to be one jump ahead this year by issuing a warning that
raiders will be severely dealt with. Furthermore, the interesting infor
mation is also added that all sponsors will be armed with pencil and
paper in order to jot down the name 3 of anyone taking part in a raid-
Thus, it appears that the sophomores will have to suppress their
desire to wreak havoc on the persons and spirits of the class of 1930.
This, because it is obviously ridiculous to walk into trouble of whose
existence one is perfectly well aware. There is no point in the sophomore's
flying in the face of a nice, gentlemanly warning from the Men's Council.
Consequently, it looks as though both classes will get a good night's
sleep, and a lot of rest for the brawl Wednesday afternoon. Another thing
has been done to make the fight better this year—no foreign matter can
be thrown in the mud-pit. A fine improvement—nice, clean mud.
