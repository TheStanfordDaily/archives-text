# Rushing!
## 
### 
Fraternity rules for this year are the same as those issued last season.
They arc very plain and easily understood. They merely say, "There
shall be no rushing of any kind during the fall or winter quarter."
What could be simpler?
Past experiences show that these rules, even though they are easily
understood, are not always obeyed. It is as much the part of the fresh
men as it is of the fraternity men to help observe the strict laws that
have been laid down by the Interfraternity Council. A little co-operation
between the Row men and the first-year men would help the matter out,
and not burden the Council with cases of violation.
Transfers are forbidden from associating with fraternity men until
a list of eligible transfers has been printed and distributed among the
various houses. No new students are allowed *to visit fraternity groups
until the list is issued, and violations of these rules will be handled in
the same way as in the case of freshmen. —W.F.A.
