# THE 						BULL SESSION

### 
"We have been lax with the fresh
men to see what kind of spirit they
had. From now on freshman hats are
going to be worn by all freshmen of
both semesters. This is final.
"RED DALES,
"President Trojan Knights."
* * *
The above gem is taken, verbatim,
from the celebrated Daily Trojan (so
called because the Trojans were an
ancient people who had nothing to do
with a university in Los Angeles).
It is easy to see that Mister Dales is
properly indignant. And can you blame
him? Here he has given the freshmen
a chance, to see, as he puts it, "what
kind of spirit they had." And he has
made the discovery, both alarming and
distressing, that they were woefully
lacking in an instinctive urge to wear
a silly-looking hat. Mister Dales can
remember when it was the highest aim
of every "Trojan" freshman to wear
a dumb chapeaux. What, Mr. Dales
would like to know, is the matter with
this younger generation?
* * *
Now, just what is the trouble with
Mister Dale, who is, obviously enough,
in deadly earnest. His trouble is a
lack of perspective. This unfortunate
circumstance is not of Mister Dale's
own making.
Mister Dales' sense of perspective
(like that of every other sophomore in
the old school) has never been the

same since that far-off day in his
freshman year when he received a
severe blow with a paddle. This per
manently warped Mister Dale's out
look, to the extent that he always
awarded a predominant place in his
mind to those ideals of freshman
"spirit" for which he was told he had
been paddled.
♦ * *
Now, the manner in which Red
Dales has cherished those ideals has
borne fruit. Is he not president of the
Trojan Knights (the title suggests an
august individual wearing an opera
hat and a pair of cast-iron B.V.D.'s)?
In his official capacity, he is going to
put the fear of God into the hearts
of the freshmen in a manner which
belies every precept of the laws of
anatomy and religion.

The freshman who is thus-' most
thoroughly impressed will probably,
some day, fall heir to the office now
graced by our Mister Dales, and the
thing will be repeated in a viscious
circle.
What can we do about it? The an
swer is, nothing. Except, perhaps, to
be thankful that such things are
gradually becoming pass 6 at Stanford
and that we are getting an oppor
tunity to concentrate on something
besides these shenanigans, which lost
their sole excuse for existence when
they ceased to be diverting, which was
several years ago. —S. O'D.

What can we do about it? The an

be thankful that such things are
gradually becoming pass 6 at Stanford
and that we are getting an oppor
tunity to concentrate on something

their sole excuse for existence when
they ceased to be diverting, which was
several years ago. —S. O'D.

"RED DALES,
"President Trojan Knights."
* * *
The above gem is taken, verbatim,
from the celebrated Daily Trojan (so
called because the Trojans were an
ancient people who had nothing to do
with a university in Los Angeles).
It is easy to see that Mister Dales is
properly indignant. And can you blame
him? Here he has given the freshmen
a chance, to see, as he puts it, "what
kind of spirit they had." And he has
made the discovery, both alarming and
distressing, that they were woefully
lacking in an instinctive urge to wear
a silly-looking hat. Mister Dales can
remember when it was the highest aim
of every "Trojan" freshman to wear
a dumb chapeaux. What, Mr. Dales
would like to know, is the matter with
this younger generation?
* * *
Now, just what is the trouble with
Mister Dale, who is, obviously enough,
in deadly earnest. His trouble is a
lack of perspective. This unfortunate
circumstance is not of Mister Dale's
own making.
Mister Dales' sense of perspective
(like that of every other sophomore in
the old school) has never been the

same since that far-off day in his
freshman year when he received a
severe blow with a paddle. This per
manently warped Mister Dale's out
look, to the extent that he always
awarded a predominant place in his
mind to those ideals of freshman
"spirit" for which he was told he had
been paddled.
♦ * *
Now, the manner in which Red
Dales has cherished those ideals has
borne fruit. Is he not president of the
Trojan Knights (the title suggests an
august individual wearing an opera
hat and a pair of cast-iron B.V.D.'s)?
In his official capacity, he is going to
put the fear of God into the hearts
of the freshmen in a manner which
belies every precept of the laws of
anatomy and religion.

thoroughly impressed will probably,
some day, fall heir to the office now
