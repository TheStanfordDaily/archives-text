# NO MORE DATES AT P.A. 1471; QUEENS CHANGE THEIR LINE
## 
### 
Telephone booth information
which universally informs the
campus queener that "1471" is
the number to call if one would
speak to his campus queen is now
obsolete.
Palo Alto 3100 is the new num
ber assigned to Roble by the
telephone company. Information
is withheld whether or not there
is any significance in the re
versed digits of the first half of
the number.
Many pessimistically believe
that a corresponding decrease in
campus dates may be expected
as a result of the inability of
campus sliieks to remember the
changed number.
