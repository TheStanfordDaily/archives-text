# GORDON DAVIS HAS SOPHISTICATED LEAD IN "ARENTWEALL?"
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, who has gained na
tional reputation for his work in Stan
ford dramatics, will take the leading
part in "Aren't We All?" Arthur Lons
dale's sparkling comedy, which is to
be presented in the University As
sembly Hall on Friday night, Octo
ber 8.
Davis, who will be remembered for
his work in "Hell Bent fer Heaven"
and"The Importance of Being Ear
nest," is admirably suited for the part
of Lord Grenham. Lonsdale intended
that the character should possess a
large degree of worldliness and polish.
Davis himself is a sophisticate and
gives Grenham's lines life and color.
Elizabeth Wilbur plays opposite
Davis as the breezy and likeable Lady
Frinton. She took the part during an
earlier presentation, in the summer
season, and endowed it with a charm
ing vivaciousness.
Sarah Margart Burns, a newcomer
to the Stanford stage, will play Mar
garet Tatham. In rehearsals, she has
shown great promise, and Gordon
Davis expects much of her. She plays
opposite Wayne Newcomb, who takes
the part of Hon. Willie Tatham. The
strange tangle of the Tatliam's marital
affairs furnishes the background for
the plot. Both Margaret and Willie
Tatham suffer a weak moment, the
former when she succumbs to a magic
oriental night and to the manly charm
of John Willocks, a young Australian
(played by Jack McGuire), and the
latter when he becomes fascinated by
the dashing Kitty Lake, whose part
will be taken by Jean Wakefield.
