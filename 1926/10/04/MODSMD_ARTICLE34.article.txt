# SOPHS MAY STILL SECURE PLACES ON YEARBOOK STAFF
## 
### 
All sophomores are reminded that
there is still time to enroll as try
outees for the Stanford Quad. The
managerial work involved in putting
out the yearbook is of a practical
nature, both in advertising and busi
ness activity.
No previous experience is necessary
for those who wish to try out. All
those enrolling will start on an even
footing, and selections for the salaried
positions which are awarded at the
end of the year are made entirely on
the basis of points earned by the try
outees in their work.
The tryout period lasts until next
spring and work of the most varied
sort is done by the tryoutees. Each
man is given an opportunity to solicit
ads, sell Quads, and all the other
activities of the work.
Fraternity and sorority houses are
urged to have at least one representa
tive each in the tryouts. All those
sophomores who have not yet signed
up may do so in the Trophy Room,
Old Union.
