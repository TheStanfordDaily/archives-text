# FRESHMAN SQUADS PROMISE STRENGTH; DEFEAT TWO TEAMS
## Yearling First String Backs Have Fast Offensive Against Opponents 
### 
Showing continued improvement,
the two freshman football teams won
both of the games played Saturday.
The first string displayed a world of
power when they overwhelmed the
California Polytechnic outfit from San
Luis Obispo 46 to 0, while the reserves
were hard pressed to win from Cogs
well High School of San Francisco 13
to 0.
The-freshman first squad played
their game with Cal Poly as a pre
liminary to the Varsity-Occidental
game. They functioned well together
during most of the fray, but fumbled
occasionally. However, they showed
plenty of offensive and defensive abil
ity. Several of the backfield men dis
played some good football.
Frentrup scored three touchdowns.
He looks like an almost sure bet at
one half. But Nellie Smith of Palo
Alto captured a small amount of glory
for himself when he did a Red Grange
through the entire Cal Poly team. He
went off tackle, reversed the field, and
advanced the ball over sixty yards for
a touchdown.
Hobdy, May, and Albertson also
broke into the point-making column
with a touchdown apiece. Hobdy
bucked the oval across the line in
good style. He looks nice at full, but
so did Simpkins.
The reserves looked rather ragged
and dead on their feet when the Cogs
well high school team, although out
weighed ten pounds to the man, held
them to two touchdowns. They started
off with a bang, and Dowling, aided
by the work of the other ten players,
gathered seven points for the babes
in the first few minutes. Then Cogs
well stiffened, or the reserves weak
ened, and no further scores were made
until late in the fourth quarter when
a Cogswell punt was blocked. This led
directly to the touchdown that gave
the game to the reserves.
Following are the lineups for both
games:
First Freshmen (46) Cal Poly (0)
