# PROMINENT STANFORD MEN FAVOR INDIANS AS SYMBOL
## 
### Fred Speers 
Following the publication in Thurs
day's Daily of a letter from Ernest J. i
Hopkins, ex-Stanford '11, suggesting 1
tliat. Stanford adopt Pioneers as its '
symbol, several students prominent in
activities have been interviewed on
the communication, and generally ex
press the opinion that Indians is a
better suggestion.
Stanford has felt the need of some
sort of symbol, comparable to that of
the Hears of California, the Trojans
of U.S.C., the Huskies of Washington,
and others too numerous to mention.
Such a symbol, if adopted, would lend
itself readily to cartoons, new yells,
and the various pictorial devices by
which publicity is attended.
Hopkins pointed out in his letter
that Pioneers, to a certain extent,
characterized Stanford University in
its early days. Senator Stanford was
somewhat of a pioneer himself —in
education circles, at least. The sug
gestion also goes well with the pres-;
ent term "Redshirts."
To quote Hopkins, "Stanford Uni-

I versity is the direct product of the

pioneer era—the pioneer mining days
I that led to the pioneer transconti
nental railroad, the pioneer million
' aires that came out of v that railroad,
1 the pioneer educators who developed
modern technological education in
mining and engineering particularly."
On the other side of the shield is
the fact that an occasional university,
Harvard, for example, has gotten
along quite weil without any such
symbol.
The interviews brought out a slight,
favoring of the Indian symbol which
; experienced a burst of publicity in
Stanford affairs some years ago. The
Indian idea died a sudden death when
a change of student opinion compelled
the removal from some football blan
kets of felt Indian heads which had
been placed there in accordance with
the then new idea.
Stanley Weigel, president of the
A.S.S.U., favors the gradual adoption
of the old Indian symbol, saying that
it lends itself better to publicity and
