# DAILY TRYOUTS START TODAY AT 1 O'CLOCK
## Practical Newspaper Work Given Aspirants for Staff Positions FRESHMEN URGED TO TRY Sophomores, Upperclassmen Have Opportunity for Advancement 
### 
Tryoutees for the editorial staff of
the Stanford Daily will meet in the
Daily office next to the Phess building
at 1 o'clock this afternoon for the first
time to receive instructtions for work
on the paper.
Freshmen are particularly urged to
turn out for the tryouts. Nevertheless,
sophomores and upperclassmen will
have an opportunity to prove their
worth. Students interested in special
types of writing such as editorial and
feature work also have an opportunity.
Tryoutees will have an actual part
in publishing the paper. Work will in
clude covering campus beats, writing
stories, rewrite work, and reading
proof. Definite assignments of news
beats will be given to tryoutees who
will be put on their own responsibility
to secure and write up the desired
details.
Those who make the staff will be
advanced on the staff according to the
quality of work done and the interest
shown in the welfare of the paper.
Promotion from the reportorial staff
progresses through copy editors to
night editors and the other higher
positions on the editorial staff.
Since tryoutees will have an oppor
tunity to learn the work from the
ground up, previous experience in
journalistic work such as that done
on high school or junior college pub
lications is not necessary.
