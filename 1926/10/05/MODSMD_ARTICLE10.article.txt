# PRESIDENT URGES NEW STUDENTS TO BETTER STANFORD
## Wilbur Outlines Progress of University During Recent Years 
### 
"Make yourself and Stanford broad in
contacts and humanity" is the advice
given new students by President Wilbur
in the first University assembly of the
year held yesterday.
"J hope you have come here to better
the University. If you have a better idea
than we have, try it, but if you must
use a hammer, build something," said
Wilbur.
In speaking of favoritism, Wilbur
warned the new students to avoid asking
for favors. "To much of the world
moves by favoritism. We try in our ad
mission of students to give you exactly
what you are entitled to. You are meas
ured by exactly what you are and what
Jtou do. Make what you start go. Drift
ing, getting behind, and having a low
standard of achievement causes most fail
ures. Keeping one's work up to date is
essential," declared Wilbur.
In speaking of the relationship of a
student to himself, Wilbur asserted that
new students usually lack vision in per
sonal conduct, forgetting that they must
live with themselves, not only today and
tomorrow, but ten years hence.
"Since every hour during the college is
worth $10, it is necessary that each stu
dent make the most of his time. Self
improvement pays cash dividends.
"Stanford's student self-government
works admirably, and although students
many times make mistakes in handling
their problems of government, in the long
run we are well satisfied with the system
as worked out by the students."
Referring to the present assimilation
of old and new students, President Wil
bur reminded the freshmen that in think
ing of sophomores they should remember
the saying found in the Talmud, dated
22 8.C., "Judge not thy fellow man until
thou be similarly situated."
In surveying the problem of higher
education at the present time Wilbur indi
cated the increase in professional train
ing periods such as those required by law,
medicine, and teaching courses. Advan
tages of the junior college together with
its relationship to the development of
Stanford were outlined by the president.
Among the recent developments of the
University, President Wilbur explained
the progress in the various schools such
as the School of Letters and the School
of Engineering, which are organized to
give the student a greater opportunity to
get a broader field than with department
limitations.

for favors. "To much of the world
moves by favoritism. We try in our ad
mission of students to give you exactly
what you are entitled to. You are meas
ured by exactly what you are and what
Jtou do. Make what you start go. Drift
ing, getting behind, and having a low
standard of achievement causes most fail
ures. Keeping one's work up to date is
essential," declared Wilbur.
In speaking of the relationship of a
student to himself, Wilbur asserted that
new students usually lack vision in per
sonal conduct, forgetting that they must
live with themselves, not only today and
tomorrow, but ten years hence.
"Since every hour during the college is
worth $10, it is necessary that each stu
dent make the most of his time. Self
improvement pays cash dividends.
"Stanford's student self-government
works admirably, and although students
many times make mistakes in handling
their problems of government, in the long
run we are well satisfied with the system
as worked out by the students."
Referring to the present assimilation
of old and new students, President Wil
bur reminded the freshmen that in think
ing of sophomores they should remember
the saying found in the Talmud, dated
22 8.C., "Judge not thy fellow man until
thou be similarly situated."
In surveying the problem of higher
education at the present time Wilbur indi
cated the increase in professional train
ing periods such as those required by law,
medicine, and teaching courses. Advan
tages of the junior college together with
its relationship to the development of
Stanford were outlined by the president.
Among the recent developments of the
University, President Wilbur explained
the progress in the various schools such
as the School of Letters and the School
of Engineering, which are organized to
give the student a greater opportunity to
get a broader field than with department
limitations.
