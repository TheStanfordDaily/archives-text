Sarah Margaret Burns should at
tract most of the attention among the
newcomers. In rehearsals, she has
shown up remarkably well.
Promptly at 1 o'clock this afternoon
in the Old Union and at CrandaU's
in Palo Alto seats go on sale for
"Aren't We All?" which is to be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall on Fri
day, October 8.
Gordon Davis takes the leading part
as Lord Grenham, and it is principally
for this reason that Bob Cecil, dra
matic manager, anticipates a large
house .In "Aren't We All?" Davis is
at his best. The part of Lord Grenham
—sophisticated and worldly Lord
Grenham—suits him admirably.
He gives to Lonsdale's lines a spar
kle and brilliance of his owil. Grenham
liimslef lives as he pleases, in brazen
disregard of the conventions. How
ever, he permits himself the privilege
of comment, witty and sarcastic com
ment, on the indiscretions of others.
In this particular regard, he has
plenty of opportuniites. In the course
of the play Margaret Tatham (played
by Sarah Margaret Burns) allows her
self, temporarily, to fall in love with
a dashing young Australian, John Wil
locks (played by Jack McGuire).
Grenham also offers sage comments
when Willie Tatham, whose part is
taken by Wayne Newcomb, becomes

1 fascinated by the dashing Kitty Lake.
Jean Wakefield, wluf took part in the
"Fotball Frolics" of last year, plays
Kitty Lake.
Elizabeth Wilbur plays opposite Gor
don Davis as the ingienous Lady
Frinton, who snares Grenham's heart
as much to his own surprise as to that
j of anyone else.
Carl Meyer and Leonard Wilbur play
the parts of two butlers who, appear
in the course of the play; respectively,
they are Morton and Roberts.
Reidar Torjussen plays the part of
the meticulous cleric, the Rev. Ernest
: Lynton. Opposite him is Eleanor
j Davidson as the Hon. Mrs. Ernest
Lynton. The Rev. Lynton is a hypo
( crite of the first water and one cannot
help but be amused by him.
The entire cast is of especial in
terest to Stanford students, because
i it consists of both old and new actors
and actresses on the Stanford stage.
| Gordon Davis is the chief old favo
| rite, while Elizabeth Wilbur, and Elea
nor Davidson and Jean Wakefield have,
both appeared in previous productions.
