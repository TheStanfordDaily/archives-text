Another Record
One of the largest assemblies in recent years met yesterday morning
to hear President Wilbur welcome the freshmen, and to hear him tell
of Stanford's plans for this year and for the future. It is just this
response to University assemblies that will encourage their continuance
and frequency, for many of these gatherings are planned for the year.
Assemblies afford the students their only opportunity to get together,
other than when they meet in the rooting section at games and at rallies.
They offer the students some ideas which they do not receive in the |
classrooms —and usually these ideas are good ones.
Last year the number of assemblies was cut down at the suggestion
of some of the professors who maintained that it was practically impos
sible to conduct a course in the proper manner when one of the lecture
periods was suddenly eliminated. These objecting professors should !
remember that there is usually a good speaker ready to offer new ideas. ;
While the lecturer may not be as good as the professor—he may be of ;
some value.
