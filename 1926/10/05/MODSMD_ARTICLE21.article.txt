# Midnight Oil
## 
### 
Speaking of midnight oil, the campus gas station has decided to
remain open from six to nine o'clock at night to accommodte the students
who drive their own. But this plan is only on trial. If the experiment
proves a success, the student will no longer have to walk to Palo Alto
and back with a can under his arm.
During the day this service station receives plenty of patronage, and
now, due to continued requests, a test is being made to see if there is
sufficient patronage to warrant the later closing hour. The University
operates the station, and the officials have announced that the price of
the standard gasolines will be one cent cheaper than the cost of fuel in
Palo Alto.
