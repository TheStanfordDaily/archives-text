# For Feature Writers
## 
### 
Frank J. Taylor, a Stanford graduate and recently appointed editor
of the Illustrated Review, has agreed to meet students interested in
writing special features which can be sold to mgazines that use material
of the type that can be found here.
There is an immense amount of material that can be obtained in a
place like Stanford University, although the articles need not necessarily
be confined to Stanford subjects. Taylor will help writers to make their
work more professional and adapted to the desires and requirements of
editors, lie should be very capable of this, having followed this line
successfully since his graduation here.
