# DR. JORDAN BRANDS NEW KIPLING POETRY AS "PURELY TRASH"
## English Poet's Attack on U.S. War Entrance Criticized 
### 
"Purely trash, worthy of a con- \
tributor to a poor country paper." j
Such is the way Dr. Jordan yesterday
characterized the recent poem of Rud
yard Kipling on the American partici
pation in the World War.
"Kipling has produced no poetry
really worth while since the Reces
sional," declared Dr. Jordan, "and
this latest outburst isn't even worth
reading."
The poem in question is a veiled
attack of bitterness for America's late
entry in the struggle, its compara
tively slight losses in men, and the
position taken by this country in re- i
gard to debt payments. The poem,
which has caused much comment and
resentment in the United States, is
entitled "The Vineyard." "The inept
and unmelodious bit of prevarication,"
as the magazine, Time, regards it, was
included in Kipling's new book, "Deb
its and Credits," published simultane
ously two weeks ago in England and
the United States. A part of the poem
follows:
"At the eleventh hour he came,
But his wages wore the same
As ours who all day long had trod
The wine-press of the Wrath of God.
Since his back had felt no load,
Virtue still in him abode;

So he swiftly made his own
Those last spoils we had not won.
We went home, delivered thence,
Grudging him no recompense
Till he portioned praise or blame
To our works before he came.
Till he showed us for our good—
Deaf to mirth and blind to scorn—
How we might have best withstood
Burdens that he has not borne!"
