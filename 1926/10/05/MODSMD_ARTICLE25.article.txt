# THE 						BULL SESSION

### 
Invaluable to the business of pur
suing knowledge is the spark of youth
ful enthusiasm. This is a truism which
loses nothing in light of the fact that
youthful enthusiasm is often mis
guided.
Be it known that there is now, in
America, a cult of the younger literati.
Its prophets are contemporary writers,
as the prophets of all cults of the
younger literati must necessarily be
contemporary writers.
At the risk of incurring the wrath
of the younger literati themselves, we j
make bold to submit that James
Branch Cabell, H. L. Mencken, Don
Byrne, Arthur Machen, and their con
freres are the majorr prophets.
* * *
It is of minor importance to argue
that the works of Cabell are the works
of a disappointed sentimentalist, that
H. L. Mencken is a destructive critic.
It is of vast importance that there 1
exists a group of young people who
read the works of these men avidly,
and who would read them even more

if they had access to the books of the
authors in question.
* * *
This brings us to the point of our
argument, whiih is that the Stanford
Library boasts a beautiful building
and a lovely reputation, and that it is
sadly lacking in those books in which
the active intellects on the campus
are interested. In short, the Stanford
Library is about twenty years behind
the times.
This shortcoming is not the pecoliar
property of the Stanford Library. Near
ly every public library in the country
is in the same state
It is the plain duty of the Stanford
librarians to ascertain just which of
Cabell's many books have attracted
universal comment in critical circles.
And the same with those other au
thors mentioned.
Possibly, we are simply annoyed at
being unable to locate our own favo
rites on the shelves of the library. If
so, comment, adverse and otherwise,
is welcomed.
