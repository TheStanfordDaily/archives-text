# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It was with the sensation of per
forming a very disagreeable, though
necessary duty that I signed the so
called honor system pledges inserted
this year in the Registration Books.
Necessary, because enrollment in the
University seems to require that it be
signed, and disagreeable because it
seemed an insult to self-respect and
integrity.
If the Honor System should mean
anything in this University, it should
mean an arrangement by which each
member of the student body is to be
trusted as a gentleman, on his honor,
and not obliged to attach his signa
ture to a fallacious, high-sounding,
and meaningless oath.
If absolute, airtight assurance is re
quired, why not have several notary
publics stationed in the Administration
Building on Registration Day and
oblige the otherwise responsible Stan
ford men and women to be sworn
solemnly and legally to uphold the
system? Then any violators would
not only have to remove themselves
from the University, but also might
be held legally liable for perjury.
Form a mental picture of a student
I catching himself in the act of running
through his notes while outside on a
mid-examination smoke. Seizing him
self by the scruff of his neck, he
drags himself off to his room, packs
his trunk, leaves the University at
once —or, after putting in thirty-six
hours working at Convalescent Home.
For minor breaches a conscience fund
might be established to which contri
butions would be sent by the wrong
doers.
Sarcasm aside, woujd it not be
equally satisfactory and infinitely
more sensible and worthy of an in
stitution of higher learning, to have
all new students provide with a brief
and explicit explanation of what the
System means, what it allows in the
way of personal freedom, and what it
expects, namely personal integrity? To
satisfy the student government a sig
nature might be asked to certify that
the pledge had been read and was
understood. But, nothing more, for to
attempt to compel honesty and ethical
conduct with sworn pledges is a
ridiculously naive conception. The
man who is not troubled with con
scientious scruples will not be de
terred in the slightest degree by such
an enforced pledge, and the rest, who
believe that honesty is worth while
for itself, not merely as a means of
Rtaying in the University, will feel de
graded each time they are obliged to
sign.
Honor and honesty cannot be forced,
threatened, or cajoled. The Men's
Council already has ample authority
to expel from Stanford anyone whose
offense they believe merits such ex

treme punishments. A statement that
the Honor System has been under
stood would be ample to do away with
the plea of ignorance, and even that
should be required only once from
students—and not three times annu
ally.
Stanford has been and still is re
markably free from such examples of
bunk and sophomoric attitude I re
spectfully urge that the pledge be
withdrawn, and that at once.

scientious scruples will not be de
terred in the slightest degree by such
an enforced pledge, and the rest, who
believe that honesty is worth while
for itself, not merely as a means of
Rtaying in the University, will feel de
graded each time they are obliged to
sign.
Honor and honesty cannot be forced,
threatened, or cajoled. The Men's
Council already has ample authority
to expel from Stanford anyone whose
offense they believe merits such ex

treme punishments. A statement that
the Honor System has been under
stood would be ample to do away with
the plea of ignorance, and even that
should be required only once from
students—and not three times annu
ally.
Stanford has been and still is re
markably free from such examples of
bunk and sophomoric attitude I re
spectfully urge that the pledge be
withdrawn, and that at once.

The Editor, Sir:
It was with the sensation of per
forming a very disagreeable, though
necessary duty that I signed the so
called honor system pledges inserted
this year in the Registration Books.
Necessary, because enrollment in the
University seems to require that it be
signed, and disagreeable because it
seemed an insult to self-respect and
integrity.
If the Honor System should mean
anything in this University, it should
mean an arrangement by which each
member of the student body is to be
trusted as a gentleman, on his honor,
and not obliged to attach his signa
ture to a fallacious, high-sounding,
and meaningless oath.
If absolute, airtight assurance is re
quired, why not have several notary
publics stationed in the Administration
Building on Registration Day and
oblige the otherwise responsible Stan
ford men and women to be sworn
solemnly and legally to uphold the
system? Then any violators would
not only have to remove themselves
from the University, but also might
be held legally liable for perjury.
Form a mental picture of a student
I catching himself in the act of running
through his notes while outside on a
mid-examination smoke. Seizing him
self by the scruff of his neck, he
drags himself off to his room, packs
his trunk, leaves the University at
once —or, after putting in thirty-six
hours working at Convalescent Home.
For minor breaches a conscience fund
might be established to which contri
butions would be sent by the wrong
doers.
Sarcasm aside, woujd it not be
equally satisfactory and infinitely
more sensible and worthy of an in
stitution of higher learning, to have
all new students provide with a brief
and explicit explanation of what the
System means, what it allows in the
way of personal freedom, and what it
expects, namely personal integrity? To
satisfy the student government a sig
nature might be asked to certify that
the pledge had been read and was
understood. But, nothing more, for to
attempt to compel honesty and ethical
conduct with sworn pledges is a
ridiculously naive conception. The
man who is not troubled with con
scientious scruples will not be de
terred in the slightest degree by such
an enforced pledge, and the rest, who
believe that honesty is worth while
for itself, not merely as a means of
Rtaying in the University, will feel de
graded each time they are obliged to
