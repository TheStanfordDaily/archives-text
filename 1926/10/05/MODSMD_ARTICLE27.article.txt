Editor, Sir:
With a suavity worthy of a more
smoothly working bureaucracy than
the Men's Council has ever shown
itself to be, a new page was slipped
into the Matriculation books this
quarter designed as a permanent fea
ture.
Professedly the innovation is an
"Honor System Pledge" whose pur
pose is "to provide for self-elimina
tion of unworthy students." Since the
Men's Council couldn't get determina
tion enough last spring and turned
the dirty work over to the adminis
tration this summer, which, of course,
approved the pledge, the thing is done,
and there is little use objecting.
But it so obviously adds one more
hypocrisy to an already burdened sys
tem. No one, however optimistic,
would expect any student to cheat in
a quizz and immediately manifest his
virile qualities of manhood by depart
ing from these halls forever. The
pledge is only good if the offender is
caught. Doubtless it will then facili
tate booting the unfortunate one out
of school. And thus, in another in
stance, is the boasted honor system
reduced to the uninspired and juvenile
makeshift it inherently is.
