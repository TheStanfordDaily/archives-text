# Last Postoffice Boxes Will Be Sold This Morning
## 
### 
The last 150 boxes available for the
fall quarter in the University post
office will go on sale at 8 o'clock this
morning, according to Mrs. Marilyn
Main Thomas, postmaster. At the cor
responding sale last year it was a case
of late-comers going without, as a line
of purchasers extended into the street
before 7 o'clock. Five hundred addi
tional boxes were put in this year to
care for the increasing demand, but
nearly all have already been sold.
Because there is no delivery from
the campus postoffice, students should
seen that their mail is addressed
feitt • ic h. box number or General
Vj very t>- carefully as to a street
ajoress, T «arns Mrs. Thomas.
Students moving to fraternity or
sorority houses should leave written
notification of the change at the post
office. Only through co-operation in
this will these students be certain of
receiving their mail.
