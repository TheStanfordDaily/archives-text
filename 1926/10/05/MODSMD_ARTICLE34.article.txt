# ORGANIST W.D. ALLEN RETURNS TO CAMPUS FROM FOREIGN TOUR
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen returned yesterday
from an extensive tour of the East and
Europe. During the first month of his
trip he gave recitals in many of the
large eastern cities.
On June 20 Mr. and Mrs. Allen
sailed for Europe, where five weeks
were spent visiting the historic cathe
drals of England. The organist paid
especial attention to the cathedral or
gans and was much interested in the
choral work presented in the various
cathedrals. While in London he was
invited to play at St. Margaret's cathe
dral.
In Paris, Warren D. Allen met his
old masters, Charles Marie Vidor, of
St. Sulpice, and also Marcel Dupre, one
of France's foremost organists. The
Aliens attended the annual Wagnerian
Opera Festival at Munich. Returning
to England they heard the Three
Choirs Festival at Worcester.
Mrs. Allen, who sang in many of
the English churches where her hus
band played, remained in the East to
visit with friends and relatives.
Mr. Allen stated, "I have my head
full of new projects for choral work.
The Three Choirs Festival was a great
inspiration, especially in the works
conducted by Sir Edward Elgar. I
hope we can do one of his great ora
torios here some day.
"Stanford can accomplish much in
the West toward developing interest
in choral music. One must go to Eng
land to understand what it can mean
in community life."
