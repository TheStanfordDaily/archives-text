# WOMEN PLAN DEBATE FOR END OF QUARTER
## 
### 
The Women's Debating Society will
meet on Thursday evening at 7:15
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse in
stead of tomorrow as had been pre
viously arranged. The change in the
day was made so that the club meet
ing should not interfere with the Con
ference party tomorrow evening.
Plans for a triangle debate to be
held some time near the end of No
vember, between Stanford, the Uni
versity of California, and Mills Col
lege, will be formed. The question
chosen for the debate is, "Resolved,
That insanity as a defense in criminal
cases be abolished."
Tryouts for the coming debate will
not take place tomorrow evening but
will be held later. All Stanford women
who are interested in debating are
urged to attend. Freshman and new
women are especially invited to come,
and anyone who has had previous ex
perience in debating will find excellent
opportunity for showing her ability.
