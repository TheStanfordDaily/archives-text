# Class in Choir, Oratorio Being Formed by Allen
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, urges all students interested in
choral work to report to him any day
this week for enrollment in choir and
oratorio.
Allen will be in Room 84, Inner
Quad, from 8:30 to 12 and from 2:30
to 4 each afternoon this week to
register interested students.
An interesting choral season is in
prospect, with most of the old mem
bers of the last year's choir again in
the University and several notable
works in prospect for production.
There is room in the organization
at present for sopranos, altos, tenors,
or basses.
The first rehearsal of the choir will
be held Thursday evening at 7:30
o'clock in the Memorial Church. Last
March the choir, directed by Warren
D. Allen, University organist, pre
sented the oratorio "Stabat Mater" by
Dvorak, in the Memorial Chapel. The
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
accompanied the choir.
