# WALKER USED AT PIVOT POSITION IN STIFF SCRIMMAGE
## Bogue Back at Half After Short Lay-off; Hoffman Pleases Warner 
### Jim Adams 
j Warner put his varsity squad through
a stiff scrimmage yesterday afternoon,
keeping them hard at work until the
ghost ball was almost in order.
| Bogue, Hill, and Artman reported for
! pr'ttgttey but the latter two were kept out
of tile 1 play. Ed Walker was back at his i
j old position at end, which was the only j
| change in the lineup of the so-called first |
j string. Bogue was back at right half j
| after a layoff for a few days.
| Hoffman, Murphy, Sims, and Fleish- J
j hacker furnished he most action in the
j backfields, with Everett, Vermilya, Mc
j Creery, and Walker showing the most
j class on the line.
Warner appears to be satisfied with the;
j work of Huffman at full, and is confident,
| enough to put Walker back at his Hank j
j job where his experience makes him a;
| very capable end. Harder will no doubt
i keep the former 011 his toes all season, i
i for the sophomore has been playing aj
■ brand of ball that will make it hard for ;
him to be kept off the lineup.
The showing of Sims in the Oxy game |
: makes the race for the halfback positions ,
all the closer and more uncertain. War- i
i ner is developing a«pood sextet of lialfs !
J and the two that land the berths will I
; have to keep going at a fast pace all |
I season in order to stay there.
