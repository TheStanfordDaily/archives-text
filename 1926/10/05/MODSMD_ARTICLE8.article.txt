# SOPHOMORE LEADER URGES BIG TURNOUT FOR MUD STRUGGLE
## 
### 
Plans were made for the coming
mud fracas between the first- and sec
ond-year men when the class of '29
met for the first time this year yes
terday afternoon in the Little Theatre, I
Robert Syer, clgss president, urged
all able-bodied men of the sophomore
class to turn out tomorrow afternoon
for the annual mud fight, which will be
held at 3:30 in the bottom of Lagunita.
It was decided by those present to
wear shirts instead of the customary
grease coating, because of the burrs i
on the lake bottom.
Warning was also given at this time
that any infraction of the rule pro-!
hibiting raiding of Encina Hall would
result in unconditionally calling off
the fight. Syer pointed out that the
class of *2!) is already in debt from
damage done in Encina during last
year, and that any further debts would
ho heavily burden the class that future
activities would be endangered. Indi
vidual violators found in the hall will i
be dealt with separately.
Another new ruling that will go into
effect is the one forbidding the sopho
mores to print any kind of poster
threatening the yearlings with punish
ment. If this rule is violated, the mud
fight will not take place, and the guilty
ones will be responsible to the men's
council.
