# CHARLESTON IS PARIS MENACE SAYS LECTURER
## TELLS OF FAMED SALONS American Dance Is Foreign Inroad in French Life Today—Champion 
### 
Describing the Charleston as a highly
gymnastic dance, Edouard Champion, who
spoke on "Paris of 1926" in the Little
Theater last evening, declares it to be
menacing the Paris of 1926.
Although the Charleston is one, of the
lighter indications of foreign influence in
French social life, it is illustrative of the
more serious foreign inroads. The well
known cosmopolitan spirit of Paris ac
cording to Champion is shown by the
groups representing all nationalities which
gather on the boulevards to "make great
plans to reform the world."
Champion spoke of the open-air life
along the boulevards and in the cafes,
mentioning especially the atmosphere of
the Russian cafe, where nearly all the
•entertainers are exiled nobles, princes, and
princesses.
In speaking of the famous salons in
Paris where the intellectually elite meet
to exchange ideas, Champion referred to
several noted authors such as Marcel
Prouse and Paul Morand, who received
much of their literary inspiration there.
"Actresses are the queens of Paris,"
said Champion who explained that the
theater is, as it has always been, an im
portant part of French life.
Referring tu the Sorbonne, Champion
said, "The university still maintains its
dignity in the midst of the nervous ardor
of Paris. Pervaded by a spirit of age, the
Sorbonne has none of the modern spirit
of an American university."
Illustrating his lecture with slides of
portraits and photographs of Anatole
France and other contemporary authors,
Champion gave brief sketches of the lives
of the writers. Slides of manuscripts of
Anatole France, Marcel Proust, and oth
ers were shown.
Champion is at present head of the
famous French publishing house, the Li
brarie Champion, and is also editor of
several literary reviews. Devoting his life
to learning, Champion is in constant touch
with the most distinguished authors of
France.
