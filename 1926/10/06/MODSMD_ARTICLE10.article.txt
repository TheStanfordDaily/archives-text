# SUZZALLO OUSTED FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CHAIR
## Students Parade to Protest Regent's Removal of Ex-Stanford Man 
### 
Dr. Henry Suzzallo, president of the
University of Washington for the past
11 years and a graduate and former
assistant professor of education at
Stanford, was yesterday ousted from
his office by action of the Board of
Regents. Political troubles between
the educator and Governor Roland W.
Hartley are said to be the cause of his
removal.
When Dr. Suzzallo was requested to
resign, he refused to, on the ground
that no reasons had been given for
his dismissal and that he had been
accorded no hearing on the subject.
The regents immediately gave him
leave of absence, and appointed David
Thomson, dean of the college of liberal
art and dean of faculties, as acting
president.
Pour thousand students, in protest
against the removal, held a torchlight
procession through the campus, de
manding a student strike. Dr. Suzzallo
asked that no such action be taken.
Throughout the trouble with the gov
ernor, he has refrained from replying
to attacks made by Hartley's friends.
Difficulties are said to have first arisen
during the war in connection with
labor suggestions made by Dr. Suz
zallo, in opposition to the governor.
An unsigned pledge appeared on the
doors of fraternity houses in the vi
cinity of the campus shortly after the
announcement, asking that the mem
bers of the fraternity stay away from
classes, not In a spirit of revolt, but
in a spirit of appreciation to Dr. Suz
zallo.
Graduating from Stanford in 1899,
and immediately afterward accepting
an assistantship in the school of edu
cation, the ex-president of Washington
has devoted his life to academic work
in Stanford, Columbia, Yale, and Cali
fornia universities
