## 
### 
Tryouts lor the coming Stanford-
California debate will be held in the
Little Theatre Tuesday afternoon,
October 12, at 1 o'clock, according to
Robert Littler, who has charge of the
tryouts.
The debate, which is to be held in
San Francisco November IG, is on the
question, "Resolved, That San Fran
cisco should favor the abandonment
of the American Plan." This question,
involving as it does a discussion of
the open shop, is of particular interest
in the bay city at this time, on ac
count of the violence which has fol
lowed the use of non-union men in at
tempts to break the carpenters' and
musicians' strikes.
Three men will be chosen at the
tryouts. Tryoutees may speak on
either side of the question which is to
be debated, each man being allowed
two appearances, with six minutes for
constructive argument and 3 minutes
for rebuttal.
