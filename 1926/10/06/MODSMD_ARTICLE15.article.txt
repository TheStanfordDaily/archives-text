# ALL APPLICATIONS FOR U.S.C. GAME ARE DUE ON FRIDAY
## 
### 
Applications for rooters' tick
ets and extra seats for the U.S.C.
game must be mailed to the
Board of Athletic Control not
later than Friday, October 8. This
is the information given out by
both the Rally Committee and
the office of the Graduate Man
ager.
It is absolutely necessary that
student applications be mailed in
early in order that the public
sale of tickets may be carried on.
This is the first time that such
an early closing date has been
set, but the public has made
such a demand for seats that
Stanford students, if they desire
either rooters' tickets or other
accommodations, must have their
applications in the mail not later
than Friday. The original closing
date was October 23.
