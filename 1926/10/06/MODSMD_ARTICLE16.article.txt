# BRANDSTEN TO PLAN SWIMMING POOLS FOR 1928 OLYMPIC GAMES
## More Efficient Facilities for Trials, Practice Is Sought by Coach 
### 
Receiving recognition from the offi
cials of the 1932 Olympic Games which
will be held in Los Angeles, Ernie
Brandsten, Stanford swimming coach,
will submit plans for the pools and
tentative suggestions for the handling
of the entrants In regard to question
of practice space.
The matter of correct arrangement
of the pools to insure the best results
from the entrants, and a system
whereby the swimmers would have
sufficient practice opportunity has
been troubling Olympic officials since
the beginning of the games.
Along with submitting the plans to
the Los Angeles officials, Coach
Brandsten is sending a duplicate of his
plans to the officials of the Olympic
Games to be held in Amsterdam in
1928.
According to Dave Fall, who is
handling the correspondence for the
coach, the plans call for three pools
with a length over all of 100 meters
with all of them 100 yards wide. A
pool for diving is 15 feet deep, and
the swimming and water polo pools
are five to six feet deep. A suggestion
from Fall calls for a pool with gutters
three feet from the bottom which can
be closed up, to be used for a chil
dren's pool, as the Amsterdam Games'
grounds are to be left as a permanent
playground.
That the plans will be accepted al
most entirely as they stand is the
opinion expressed by Dave Fall.
Brandsten, in his twelve years of
coaching at the University, has gained
national reputation from the material
he has developed for the local teams
which have always ranked with the
best water teams in the country.
