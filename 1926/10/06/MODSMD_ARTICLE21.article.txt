# SOPHOMORES-FRESHMEN SET FOR ANNUAL BATTLE IN MUD
## TIME CALLED FOR 3:30 Pits in Lagunita Prepared By First-Year Men for Afternoon's Tussle 
### 
Sophomores last night indulged
in a demonstration in front of
Encina Hall but the action was
not in the nature of a "raid" and
the mud fight will be held as
scheduled. About 250 sophomores
were in the crowd that congre
gated before the dormitory. Spon
sors kept the first-year men from
going out of the hall.
With the sophomore horde led by
the Scalpers Society and the freshman
battlers appearing stripped to the
waist and daubed with red paint, this
afternoon's mud fight in the bottom
of Lake Lagunita should re-create, in
the imaginations of the onlookers at
least, the primitive Indian orgies of
an earlier day. The annual battle be
tween the underclassmen is scheduled
for ,!:30 o'clock, and a large repre
sentation from the rest of the student
body is expected to be on the side
lines.
Gangs of freshmen will this morn
ing prepare the pits to be filled with
the mud early this afternoon. Both
classes will attempt to secure a thick
mixture of sediment owing to the ban
against the introduction of oils and
greases. Yesterday evening a gang of
fifty freshmen, assisted by the officers
of the sophomore class, worked until
a late hour constructing the "bull
pens" where the victims are detained
after immersion
Freshmen will assemble at 2:30
o'clock today in front of Encina Hall
and. shouting their battle-cries, will
march in a body to the pits. H. D.
Krenz was elected at a rally last night
in lobby to lead the men in
the struggle. Robert Crowl, Edward
Valentine, George Thompson, and
I homas Koster are to be Krenz's lieu
tenants.
