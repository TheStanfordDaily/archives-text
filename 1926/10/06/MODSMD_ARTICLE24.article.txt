"Smaller and worse" rather than "bigger and better" characterizes
this year's freshman handbook published jointly by the Y.M.C.A. and
Y.W.C.A. These organizations promised a "bigger and better" publica
tion last spring when they asked the Associated Students for an increase
in subsidy in order to carry out their plans for the 1927 book. Their
finished product and their promises show no comparison—in every de
partment the new publication is worse.
In the past the student body has annually contributed to the Y.M.C.A.
$100 toward the publication of a handbook, because under section XII,
article IV, of the constitution it is required that each year the A.S.S.U.
publish such a book containing a copy of the constitution.
In return for this subsidization the Y.M.C.A. agreed to publish a
more complete book than the A.S.S.U. would be capable of producing,
limited as they are financially.
For this year's publication the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. expressed
their desire to combine their efforts and put out a much "bigger and
better" book provided the subsidy was increased to $150. The associated
students trusted the integrity of these organizations and granted the
increase. The finished product is a disgrace to their promises!
An investigation shows that this 1927 book instead of being bigger
and better is nothing short of a farce in comparison with the former
publications.
It is sixty-eight pages less than last year. It makes no reference to
Stanford traditions. It contains no previous athletic records nor does
it contain a compilation of former Stanford-California intercollegiate
contests such as the big games and big meets. And the binding is one
of the cheapest.
The reduction in the number of pages is not so important if
all the desired information were contained in the book, but, as has been
mentioned, much has been eliminated.
When a handbook is sent out to incoming students it should most
of all contain some mention of Stanford traditions. Every entering stu
dent is interested to know what is expected of him by the older students.
How could a freshman become better acquainted with Stanford his
tory than to be well informed upon Stanford-California records and the
results of clashes between the two institutions?
In the past the book has always been well bound and usually an imi
tation leather has been used for the cover, but this year sees the book
which represents Stanford bound in one of the cheapest kinds of covers
—cardboard.
There would be no unusual interest shown in the publication this
year—no matter how poor the book was—if the Y.M.C.A. and the
Y.W.C.A. had not asked the A.S.S.U. for an increased subsidy on the
grounds that the book would be increased and made more interesting
and advantageous in every department.
Practically the same amount of advertising was obtained for the book
this year so the income from that department should have been almost
identical under good management. But why was the additional $50
required to publish the book? Where did the money go?

Y.W.C.A. had not asked the A.S.S.U. for an increased subsidy on the
grounds that the book would be increased and made more interesting
and advantageous in every department.
Practically the same amount of advertising was obtained for the book
this year so the income from that department should have been almost
identical under good management. But why was the additional $50
required to publish the book? Where did the money go?
"Smaller and worse" rather than "bigger and better" characterizes
this year's freshman handbook published jointly by the Y.M.C.A. and
Y.W.C.A. These organizations promised a "bigger and better" publica
tion last spring when they asked the Associated Students for an increase
in subsidy in order to carry out their plans for the 1927 book. Their
finished product and their promises show no comparison—in every de
partment the new publication is worse.
In the past the student body has annually contributed to the Y.M.C.A.
$100 toward the publication of a handbook, because under section XII,
article IV, of the constitution it is required that each year the A.S.S.U.
publish such a book containing a copy of the constitution.
In return for this subsidization the Y.M.C.A. agreed to publish a
more complete book than the A.S.S.U. would be capable of producing,
limited as they are financially.
For this year's publication the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. expressed
their desire to combine their efforts and put out a much "bigger and
better" book provided the subsidy was increased to $150. The associated
students trusted the integrity of these organizations and granted the
increase. The finished product is a disgrace to their promises!
An investigation shows that this 1927 book instead of being bigger
and better is nothing short of a farce in comparison with the former
publications.
It is sixty-eight pages less than last year. It makes no reference to
Stanford traditions. It contains no previous athletic records nor does
it contain a compilation of former Stanford-California intercollegiate
contests such as the big games and big meets. And the binding is one
of the cheapest.
The reduction in the number of pages is not so important if
all the desired information were contained in the book, but, as has been
mentioned, much has been eliminated.
When a handbook is sent out to incoming students it should most
of all contain some mention of Stanford traditions. Every entering stu
dent is interested to know what is expected of him by the older students.
How could a freshman become better acquainted with Stanford his
tory than to be well informed upon Stanford-California records and the
results of clashes between the two institutions?
In the past the book has always been well bound and usually an imi
tation leather has been used for the cover, but this year sees the book
which represents Stanford bound in one of the cheapest kinds of covers
—cardboard.
There would be no unusual interest shown in the publication this
year—no matter how poor the book was—if the Y.M.C.A. and the
Y.W.C.A. had not asked the A.S.S.U. for an increased subsidy on the
grounds that the book would be increased and made more interesting
