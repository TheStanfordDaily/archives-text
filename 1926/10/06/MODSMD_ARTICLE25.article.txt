# Ticket Applications
## 
### 
Friday is the last day to mail applications for tickets to the U.S.C.
game at Los Angeles. Tliis is the only chance that students will have
an opportunity to purchase rooters' tickets and extra pasteboards for
this contest.
The turnout for the game in the South should he as big as ever.
There should be as large a rooting section as possible so that the Rally
Committee can make arrangements for a good showing against the
U.S.C. backers.
With Friday the last day students must decide early to get their
tickets. There can be no hesitation; so mail those ticket applications
before Friday.
