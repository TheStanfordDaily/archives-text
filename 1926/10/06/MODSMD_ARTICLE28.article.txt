# THE 						BULL SESSION

"Editor, Bull Session, Stanford Daily:
"In answer to Mr. O'D's blah in the
Bull Session the other day, concern
ing the viscious attitude of the Trojan
Knights in general and Mr. Red Dales
in particular toward all erring frosh at
U.S.C., I would like to add a few
words. Strangely enough, the Trojan
Knights is a senior, not a sophomore, :
institution, organized to help the en
tering classes at U.S.C., which duty it
performs commendably. In my humble
opinion Mr. O'D. is quite all wet when
he scorns Mr. Dales' ideals concern
ing the methods of introducing frosh
to college life. He should remember
that, strange as it may seem, not all
the crude methods of frosh subjuga
tion are yet done away with even at
our own benign institution. A dink is
occasionally seen on the Stanford
campus. Furthermore Mr. O'D. must
realize that the incentive to disregard
certain rather inane traditions has i
arisen in the past, not from dignified
superiors, but from the freshmen them- i
selves.
"I honestly do not believe that our
sponsor system is a bit superior to
U.S.C.'s Trojan Knights, and this
opinion has led to the above emission.
We of Stanford, who are not yet quite
out of the mire ourselves, are not in
a position of openly scorning another
school's institutions
"Jack Dales, cousin of the infamous
'Red'."

My Dear Jack:
How were we to know that "Red"
Dales had a member of his family
registered here? And if we had known,
certainly we were not to assume that
he would reach the column. No col
umnist does this. As a matter of fact,
we were only using "Red" Dales as a
symbol, a symbol of sophomorism.
This brings us to the point of our
letter, which is to tell you that your
cousin, in a broad sense of the word,
is a sophomore, and likewise that the
"Trojan Knights," while comprised of
seniors, is nevertheless a sophomoric
institution.

Let us bring in WeDster to bear us
out in this statement. According to
the dictionary definition, the word
sophomore comes from the term soph
ister, a second-year student at the
University of Cambridge, and from
the Greek word moros, meaning fool
ish. The adjective which is taken from
the same stem (we have in mind the
word sophomoric) is defined as "per
taining to or characteristic of a sopho
more; hence, opprobriously marked by
a shallow assumption of learning, or
by empty grandiloquence, immature."
Now, Jack, it was not our intention
to persecute "Red" Dales. Instead, we
intended to lambaste the particular
sort of idiocy which he represents as
President of the Trojan Knights. It
was merely a coincidence that he
should have happened to have publish
his ultimatum to the freshmen of
IT.S.C. when tTlis column was three
days old, and when we had already
touched upon this topic.
We hold that when a society of any
kind takes it upon itself to test the
spirit of other men upon the basis of
such an irrelevant matter as the com
parative willingness or unwillingness
of those men to wear a ridiculous hat,
the members of that society are
marked by "a shallow assumption of
learning." We likewise feel that when
the president of that society publishes
an ultimatum on the matter, he is
guilty of "empty grandiloquence."
Likewise, that the entire operation
smacks of immaturity. So much for
that.
For the rest of your argument, you
are quite right in stating that we are
not yet out of the mire at Stanford,
and it is our sincere hope that we
haven't created the impression that
we are However, tell "Red" not to re
sign if he is having any fun, and don't
go in off the deep end yourself.
Editor, The Bull Session (note:
you have accomplished one thing.
We are going to quit signing our
initials to this column. It makes
it sound as if we were trying to
start a feud).
and P.S. Jack —we are prejudiced. We

live in Los Angeles, and have an
j annual opportunity to see newspaper
photographs of the austere "Trojan
Knights" wearing terrifying facial ex
pressions the while they chase fresh
men, clad in barrels.
We don't do this at Stanford!

My Dear Jack:
How were we to know that "Red"
Dales had a member of his family
registered here? And if we had known,
certainly we were not to assume that
he would reach the column. No col
umnist does this. As a matter of fact,
we were only using "Red" Dales as a
symbol, a symbol of sophomorism.
This brings us to the point of our
letter, which is to tell you that your
cousin, in a broad sense of the word,
is a sophomore, and likewise that the
"Trojan Knights," while comprised of
seniors, is nevertheless a sophomoric
institution.

Let us bring in WeDster to bear us
out in this statement. According to
the dictionary definition, the word
sophomore comes from the term soph
ister, a second-year student at the
University of Cambridge, and from
the Greek word moros, meaning fool
ish. The adjective which is taken from
the same stem (we have in mind the
word sophomoric) is defined as "per
taining to or characteristic of a sopho
more; hence, opprobriously marked by
a shallow assumption of learning, or
by empty grandiloquence, immature."
Now, Jack, it was not our intention
to persecute "Red" Dales. Instead, we
intended to lambaste the particular
sort of idiocy which he represents as
President of the Trojan Knights. It
was merely a coincidence that he
should have happened to have publish
his ultimatum to the freshmen of
IT.S.C. when tTlis column was three
days old, and when we had already
touched upon this topic.
We hold that when a society of any
kind takes it upon itself to test the
spirit of other men upon the basis of
such an irrelevant matter as the com
parative willingness or unwillingness
of those men to wear a ridiculous hat,
the members of that society are
marked by "a shallow assumption of
learning." We likewise feel that when
the president of that society publishes
an ultimatum on the matter, he is
guilty of "empty grandiloquence."
Likewise, that the entire operation
smacks of immaturity. So much for
that.
For the rest of your argument, you
are quite right in stating that we are
not yet out of the mire at Stanford,
and it is our sincere hope that we
haven't created the impression that
we are However, tell "Red" not to re
sign if he is having any fun, and don't
go in off the deep end yourself.

campus. Furthermore Mr. O'D. must
realize that the incentive to disregard
certain rather inane traditions has i
arisen in the past, not from dignified
superiors, but from the freshmen them- i
selves.
"I honestly do not believe that our
sponsor system is a bit superior to
U.S.C.'s Trojan Knights, and this
opinion has led to the above emission.
We of Stanford, who are not yet quite
out of the mire ourselves, are not in
a position of openly scorning another
school's institutions
"Jack Dales, cousin of the infamous
'Red'."

My Dear Jack:
How were we to know that "Red"
Dales had a member of his family
registered here? And if we had known,
certainly we were not to assume that
he would reach the column. No col
umnist does this. As a matter of fact,
we were only using "Red" Dales as a
symbol, a symbol of sophomorism.
This brings us to the point of our
letter, which is to tell you that your
cousin, in a broad sense of the word,
is a sophomore, and likewise that the
"Trojan Knights," while comprised of
seniors, is nevertheless a sophomoric
institution.

Let us bring in WeDster to bear us
out in this statement. According to
the dictionary definition, the word
sophomore comes from the term soph
ister, a second-year student at the
University of Cambridge, and from
the Greek word moros, meaning fool
ish. The adjective which is taken from
the same stem (we have in mind the
word sophomoric) is defined as "per
taining to or characteristic of a sopho
more; hence, opprobriously marked by
a shallow assumption of learning, or
by empty grandiloquence, immature."
Now, Jack, it was not our intention
to persecute "Red" Dales. Instead, we
intended to lambaste the particular
sort of idiocy which he represents as
President of the Trojan Knights. It
was merely a coincidence that he
should have happened to have publish
his ultimatum to the freshmen of
IT.S.C. when tTlis column was three
days old, and when we had already
touched upon this topic.
We hold that when a society of any
kind takes it upon itself to test the
spirit of other men upon the basis of
such an irrelevant matter as the com
parative willingness or unwillingness
of those men to wear a ridiculous hat,
the members of that society are
marked by "a shallow assumption of
learning." We likewise feel that when
the president of that society publishes
an ultimatum on the matter, he is
guilty of "empty grandiloquence."
Likewise, that the entire operation
smacks of immaturity. So much for
that.
For the rest of your argument, you
are quite right in stating that we are
not yet out of the mire at Stanford,
and it is our sincere hope that we
haven't created the impression that
we are However, tell "Red" not to re
sign if he is having any fun, and don't
go in off the deep end yourself.
Editor, The Bull Session (note:
you have accomplished one thing.
We are going to quit signing our
initials to this column. It makes
it sound as if we were trying to
start a feud).
and P.S. Jack —we are prejudiced. We

live in Los Angeles, and have an
j annual opportunity to see newspaper
photographs of the austere "Trojan
Knights" wearing terrifying facial ex
pressions the while they chase fresh
men, clad in barrels.
We don't do this at Stanford!
