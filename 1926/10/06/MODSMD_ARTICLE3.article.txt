# INTERVIEWERS FIND MANY FAVOR STANFORD SYMBOL
## 
### 
| Neither "Pioneers" nor "Indians"
! appeals to the majority of student
' body members interviewed by the
Daily in an effort to get an opinion
on the recently raised question of a
new symbol for Stanford athletic
teams However, practically all of
| those stating their views believe that
there should be some new name that
â–  could be represented by a symbol.
"Symbol, symbol, who's got the sym
bol?" was the remark greeting one
staff interviewer yesterday afternoon.
| But from the discussion it is to be
, drawn that a large number of the
| student body members are thinking
! seriously about this new problem. Del
; mer Daves, last year's senior class
i president, says; "I think the name of
j 'Indians' is very appropriate because
i it is associated with the color of red,
j and with redskins in general. How-
I ever, I beliece that to call a Stanford
| man an 'Indian' would be to imply
j that he was a sort of a scrubby fellow.
| Pioneers bring to mind red, sunburnt
i men, and to call ourselves such would
be entirely in keeping with the spirit
of the University."
Steve Collins, of the varsity base
ball team and member of the Men's
Council, takes just the opposite view
from that of Daves. He says:"I be
lieve that the name 'Cardinal' fits the
i purpose, while neither 'Indians' nor
I 'Pioneers' would. I am not in favor
! of having any official symbol."
Lawrence Babcock goes back to the
| other side, and is in favor of either
I name in preference to being without
a symbol of some kind. Members of
the Chi Psi Lodge were asked at ran
dom what they thought of the names

I and, in answering, Van King, member
of Ram's Head and Art Editor of
Chaparral last year, said neither was
j appropriate and that he hoped for some
' name which would better characterize
Stanford. Fletcher Walker agreed with
King. Terrence Clyne, a transfer from
Amherst College, says:"From the
' ideas I have gained before and on
1 coming to Stanford, I believe the name
Indian would be very appropriate."
Most of those in favor of one of the
two names suggested like "Indians"
the best. Stan Natcher, varsity center,
states: "Feg Murray's cartoon of the
Indian as the symbol of the University
greatly appeals to me, and I would be
heartily in favor of changing to this
name."
Stanley Weigel, A.SS.U. president;
Vic Greisser, Senior Class president;
Mike Murphy, varsity halfback; and
Nelson David, captain-elect of the bas
ketball team, all side with the group
in favor of "Indians." This group is
second to the one not in favor of
either of the new names, but which
desires some name allowing a good
publicity symbol.
Though in the minority, the side
favoring no change at all has a power
ful argument in the fact that Harvard
has no symbol and has evidently not
i needed one for publicity's sake. This
group claims that Stanford does not
need a symbol, that it is better that
Stanford be given what publicity it is
given, under the name "Stanford."
Eli Post, guard on the varsity squad,
says:"I think that the word 'Stan
| ford' in itself is enough of a symbol
! considering all that the name stands
j for."
