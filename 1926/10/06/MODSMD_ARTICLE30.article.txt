# CONFERENCE TEAMS MEET IN IMPORTANT CLASHES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Next Saturday the eyes of the foot
ball fans of the Northwest will be
centered on the new Multnomah Civic
Stadium at Portland, for it is there
that last year's conference champions,
the Washington Huskies, and Oregon
will meet "in their first Conference
clashes of the year.
According to the dope, the Huskies,
who are rated as one of the five
leading teams on the coast, are favo
rites. Oregon, however, always plays
exceptional football against its old
rival, Washington, and followers of the
game are looking forward to a hard
struggle.
After Washington had practically
cinched the conference title last sea
son, the Lemon Yellow eleven almost
ruined its chance. As it was, Bag
shaw's men won, 15 to 14, so next
Saturday's contest will see not only
the dedication of the new stadium, but
also the clashing of two old rivals in
the first conference game of the year
for each.
Oregon Tightens Up
Washington won its practice games
from Willamette and the College of
Puget Sound in easy style, while Ore
gon disposed of Willamette but was
held to a scoreless tie by Pacific Uni
versity. Pacific U„ however, always
points for the Oregon game. The fact
that it was was held by Pacific has
increased Oregon's chances in the
minds of some of the experts, inas
much as it will serve to put the Web
feet on edge for Saturday's game. An
easy victory over Pacific might have
given the Oregonians cause to let up
a bit, but such is not the case now.
Another game in the North which is
drawing its share of attention is the
Montana-Idaho contest slated for Mis
soula Saturday. Montana was snowed
under by the fast and powerful attack
of the Oregon Aggies last Saturday,
but Coach Milburn, who is piloting
the Grizzlies for the first time, is not
discouraged. He has hopes of making
a much better showing Saturday
against Charley Erb and his Idaho var
sity
Milburn started the season, minus
the services of Russell Sweet, now
with the Olympic Club, "Wild Bill"
Kelly, All-Coast man, and Chief Ill
man, and without this backfield trio
he was practically without a team, for
it was the work of these three that
kept up the interest in the Montana
squad.
Very few reports, and most of those
meager ones, have come from Idaho.
About all that Erb has promised is a
team of fighters. What else they can
do will be demonstrated Saturday.
The other Conference game of the
day will feature Washington State and
the Trojans at Los Angeles. It looks
like another victory for the Southern
ers, for Babe Hollingberry, former
Olympic Club mentor and now director
of the Cougars, had very few veteran
linemen answer his call, and while
his backs have, for the most part, had
experience, it is hardly possible that
they will be able to match Howard
Jones' squad of ball carriers and for
wards. Last year the Cougars won
when they were not given an outside
chance.

The other three conference teams,
namely Stanford, California, and the
Oregon Aggies, will not play Confer
ence teams Saturday. Stanford enter
tains the Olympic Club, California
meets the Fighting Irishmen from St.
Mary's, and the Aggies face Pacific
University.
St. Mary's Determined
Stanford looks to be well ahead of
the Olympics and should come through
unscratched, as should the Aggies, but
Nibs Price has his work cut out for
him to score a win over St. Mary's.
"Slip" Madigan has his heart set on a
victory over the Bears after having
come so close to beating them last
season, and from advance informa
tion he has a good chance of being
satisfied. N
Although the Bruins looked much
better against the Olympic Club last
Saturday, they are meeting a real
football machine this week and they
will be called on to display some first
class work to beat the Irishmen.
Getting back to the conference race,
it is generally thought that there are
five teams in the race for the title.
Of the five, only two, the University
of Southern California and Washing
ton, play Conference rivals Saturday.
If Oregon should win from the Hus
kies there would be only four, U.S.C.,
Stanford, California, and the Oregon
Aggies left in the running.
Bears Not Dangerous
Of this quartet the Bears appear to
be the weakest, so, if the race is
narrowed to three teams it seems that
the logical trio would be made up of
the Cards, the Trojans, and the
Aggies.
Opinions are about evenly divided
on these three, with Southern Califor
nia ruling a slight favorite over the
other two. Luckily, the Trojans are
scheduled to meet both of these close
rivals, thus making it possible for all
such differences of opinion to be set
tled beyond question.

Jones' squad of ball carriers and for
wards. Last year the Cougars won
when they were not given an outside
chance.

The other three conference teams,
namely Stanford, California, and the
Oregon Aggies, will not play Confer
ence teams Saturday. Stanford enter
tains the Olympic Club, California
meets the Fighting Irishmen from St.
Mary's, and the Aggies face Pacific
University.
St. Mary's Determined
Stanford looks to be well ahead of
the Olympics and should come through
unscratched, as should the Aggies, but
Nibs Price has his work cut out for
him to score a win over St. Mary's.
"Slip" Madigan has his heart set on a
victory over the Bears after having
come so close to beating them last
season, and from advance informa
tion he has a good chance of being
satisfied. N
Although the Bruins looked much
better against the Olympic Club last
Saturday, they are meeting a real
football machine this week and they
will be called on to display some first
class work to beat the Irishmen.
Getting back to the conference race,
it is generally thought that there are
five teams in the race for the title.
Of the five, only two, the University
of Southern California and Washing
ton, play Conference rivals Saturday.
If Oregon should win from the Hus
kies there would be only four, U.S.C.,
Stanford, California, and the Oregon
Aggies left in the running.
Bears Not Dangerous
Of this quartet the Bears appear to
be the weakest, so, if the race is
narrowed to three teams it seems that
the logical trio would be made up of
the Cards, the Trojans, and the
Aggies.
Opinions are about evenly divided
on these three, with Southern Califor
nia ruling a slight favorite over the
other two. Luckily, the Trojans are
scheduled to meet both of these close
rivals, thus making it possible for all
such differences of opinion to be set
tled beyond question.
Next Saturday the eyes of the foot
ball fans of the Northwest will be
centered on the new Multnomah Civic
Stadium at Portland, for it is there
that last year's conference champions,
the Washington Huskies, and Oregon
will meet "in their first Conference
clashes of the year.
According to the dope, the Huskies,
who are rated as one of the five
leading teams on the coast, are favo
rites. Oregon, however, always plays
exceptional football against its old
rival, Washington, and followers of the
game are looking forward to a hard
struggle.
After Washington had practically
cinched the conference title last sea
son, the Lemon Yellow eleven almost
ruined its chance. As it was, Bag
shaw's men won, 15 to 14, so next
Saturday's contest will see not only
the dedication of the new stadium, but
also the clashing of two old rivals in
the first conference game of the year
for each.
Oregon Tightens Up
Washington won its practice games
from Willamette and the College of
Puget Sound in easy style, while Ore
gon disposed of Willamette but was
held to a scoreless tie by Pacific Uni
versity. Pacific U„ however, always
points for the Oregon game. The fact
that it was was held by Pacific has
increased Oregon's chances in the
minds of some of the experts, inas
much as it will serve to put the Web
feet on edge for Saturday's game. An
easy victory over Pacific might have
given the Oregonians cause to let up
a bit, but such is not the case now.
Another game in the North which is
drawing its share of attention is the
Montana-Idaho contest slated for Mis
soula Saturday. Montana was snowed
under by the fast and powerful attack
of the Oregon Aggies last Saturday,
but Coach Milburn, who is piloting
the Grizzlies for the first time, is not
discouraged. He has hopes of making
a much better showing Saturday
against Charley Erb and his Idaho var
sity
Milburn started the season, minus
the services of Russell Sweet, now
with the Olympic Club, "Wild Bill"
Kelly, All-Coast man, and Chief Ill
man, and without this backfield trio
he was practically without a team, for
it was the work of these three that
kept up the interest in the Montana
squad.
Very few reports, and most of those
meager ones, have come from Idaho.
About all that Erb has promised is a
team of fighters. What else they can
do will be demonstrated Saturday.
The other Conference game of the
day will feature Washington State and
the Trojans at Los Angeles. It looks
like another victory for the Southern
ers, for Babe Hollingberry, former
Olympic Club mentor and now director
of the Cougars, had very few veteran
linemen answer his call, and while
his backs have, for the most part, had
experience, it is hardly possible that
they will be able to match Howard
Jones' squad of ball carriers and for
wards. Last year the Cougars won
when they were not given an outside

Oregon Tightens Up
Washington won its practice games
from Willamette and the College of
Puget Sound in easy style, while Ore
gon disposed of Willamette but was
held to a scoreless tie by Pacific Uni
versity. Pacific U„ however, always
points for the Oregon game. The fact
that it was was held by Pacific has
increased Oregon's chances in the
minds of some of the experts, inas
much as it will serve to put the Web
feet on edge for Saturday's game. An
easy victory over Pacific might have
given the Oregonians cause to let up
a bit, but such is not the case now.
Another game in the North which is
drawing its share of attention is the
Montana-Idaho contest slated for Mis
soula Saturday. Montana was snowed
under by the fast and powerful attack
of the Oregon Aggies last Saturday,
but Coach Milburn, who is piloting
the Grizzlies for the first time, is not
discouraged. He has hopes of making
a much better showing Saturday
against Charley Erb and his Idaho var
sity
Milburn started the season, minus
the services of Russell Sweet, now
with the Olympic Club, "Wild Bill"
Kelly, All-Coast man, and Chief Ill
man, and without this backfield trio
he was practically without a team, for
it was the work of these three that
kept up the interest in the Montana
squad.
Very few reports, and most of those
meager ones, have come from Idaho.
About all that Erb has promised is a
team of fighters. What else they can
do will be demonstrated Saturday.
The other Conference game of the
day will feature Washington State and
the Trojans at Los Angeles. It looks
like another victory for the Southern
ers, for Babe Hollingberry, former
Olympic Club mentor and now director
of the Cougars, had very few veteran
linemen answer his call, and while
his backs have, for the most part, had
experience, it is hardly possible that
they will be able to match Howard
Jones' squad of ball carriers and for
wards. Last year the Cougars won
when they were not given an outside
chance.

The other three conference teams,
namely Stanford, California, and the
Oregon Aggies, will not play Confer
ence teams Saturday. Stanford enter
tains the Olympic Club, California
meets the Fighting Irishmen from St.
Mary's, and the Aggies face Pacific
University.
St. Mary's Determined
Stanford looks to be well ahead of
the Olympics and should come through
unscratched, as should the Aggies, but
Nibs Price has his work cut out for
him to score a win over St. Mary's.
"Slip" Madigan has his heart set on a
victory over the Bears after having
come so close to beating them last
season, and from advance informa
tion he has a good chance of being
satisfied. N
Although the Bruins looked much
better against the Olympic Club last
Saturday, they are meeting a real
football machine this week and they
will be called on to display some first
class work to beat the Irishmen.
Getting back to the conference race,
it is generally thought that there are
five teams in the race for the title.
Of the five, only two, the University
of Southern California and Washing
ton, play Conference rivals Saturday.
If Oregon should win from the Hus
kies there would be only four, U.S.C.,
Stanford, California, and the Oregon
Aggies left in the running.
Bears Not Dangerous
Of this quartet the Bears appear to
be the weakest, so, if the race is
narrowed to three teams it seems that
the logical trio would be made up of
the Cards, the Trojans, and the
Aggies.
Opinions are about evenly divided
on these three, with Southern Califor
nia ruling a slight favorite over the
other two. Luckily, the Trojans are
scheduled to meet both of these close
rivals, thus making it possible for all
such differences of opinion to be set
tled beyond question.
Next Saturday the eyes of the foot
ball fans of the Northwest will be
centered on the new Multnomah Civic
Stadium at Portland, for it is there
that last year's conference champions,
the Washington Huskies, and Oregon
will meet "in their first Conference
clashes of the year.
According to the dope, the Huskies,
who are rated as one of the five
leading teams on the coast, are favo
rites. Oregon, however, always plays
exceptional football against its old
rival, Washington, and followers of the
game are looking forward to a hard
struggle.
After Washington had practically
cinched the conference title last sea
son, the Lemon Yellow eleven almost
ruined its chance. As it was, Bag
shaw's men won, 15 to 14, so next
Saturday's contest will see not only
the dedication of the new stadium, but
also the clashing of two old rivals in
the first conference game of the year
for each.
