# New Shell Species Added To Museum by Oldroyds
## 
### 
Approximately 500 new species of
shells collected by Mrs. Oldroyd are
to be added to the present conchologi
cal collection of the University at the
geological museum,
Mrs. Oldroyd, curator of the mu
seum, has just returned from an ex
tended tour of Europe with her hus
band, where they studied the shell
collections of the large museums and
assembled the many new species to be
added to the present collection.
"The New York Museum has the
finest collection of shells that I have
ever seen," stated Mrs. Oldroyd. "It
is larger than the one at the British
Museum."
During the trip Mrs. Oldroyd visited
the museums of the universities of
'Copenhagen and Stockholm. She plans
to exchange specimens of Pacific
Coast shells with these museums for
specimens peculiar to their locality.
On her return, while in Los Angeles,
the curator was given a banquet by
the Los Angeles County Conchological
Club.
