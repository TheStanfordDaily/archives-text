### 
Foreign as well as American visit
ing professors were members of the
summer quarter faculty, which was
the first to include visiting foreign in
structors. Forty-one visiting profes
sors, the largest number in the his
tory of Stanford, were included in the
summer faculty, according to John A.
Sellards, Director of the Summer
Quarter.
The number of students enrolled
this summer quarter reached 1200,
over half of which were graduate stu
dents. Sixty-six per cent were resi
dents of California, the remainder
representing thirty-five states and
fourteen foreign countries.
One of the features of the summer
was a series of popular lectures open
to everyone. Three Fectures on evolu
tion were delivered by Dr. Jordan.
The list of foreign visiting profes
sors includes such well-known names
as Dr. Alfred F. Pribran of the Uni
versity of Vienna, Dr. Moritz Geiger of
the University of Gottingen,, and Dr.
Jean-Marie Carr6 of the University of
Lyons. Among visiting American pro
fessors were Charles Jesse Bullock of
Harvard and Edwin Corwin of Prince
ton.
"Plans are well under way for the
summer of 1927. The policy of bring
ing in European visiting professors
will be continued, and we hope to
offer the most interesting program
Stanford has yet offered for under
graduate as well as graduate stu
dents," stated Sellards.
