# PEACE CONFERENCE CATALOGUE ISSUED BY HOOVER LIBRARY
## Pamphlet Lists Propaganda Efforts of Delegations At Paris in 1919 
### 
"The Catalogue of Paris Peace Con
ference Delegation Propaganda in
1919" in the Hoover War Library col
lection, recently issued, is the first
number of an intended bibliographical
series to cover all the titles in that
library. The collection, which was
gathered between May and October,
1919, in Paris, by Dr. Ephraim D.
Adams of the History department, con
tains documents authenticated by the
delegations, as well as some titles
classed as "unauthenticated." Dr.
Adams visited the delegations himself
to ask for a list of publications and
manuscripts for which each would
stand sponsor. This precaution was
taken because it was found that in
the collection made at the Hotel Cril
lon for the use of the American Dele
gation there appeared many publica
tions that no nation would acknowl
edge. In a few cases publications were
ascribed on their title-pages to dele
gations that disowned them and be
lieved them to be the work of rival
delegations.
The collection is not complete.
When Dr. Adams reached Paris some
of the smaller delegations had already
left, and also the stocks of some of
the publications were exhausted. Great
Britain, Belgium, and the United
States officially issued no propaganda
France did the same, but a list of
French titles was taken from the pub
lications distributed by a French gov
ernmental agency, the Maison de
Presse.
A small number of Japanese publi
cations is included. These, however,
are not really propaganda, but rather
official explanations.
The German titles listed are publi
cations that were distributed in Paris,
but which the German War Office
authenticated to Dr. Adams when he
visited Berlin in August, 1919.
The items are classed in three divi
sions. Two are authenticated, the
documents and publications "present
ed" to the Conference, many of which
were not "received," since a number
of the delegations were unacknowl
edged by the Conference, and the docu
ments distributed for effect on the
Conference. The unauthenticated divi
sion includes items that reached Dr.
Adams indirectly.
Of the items, about 1300 are au
thenticated. Jugoslavia leads the na
tions in the number of items listed in
this, with over 200. France has almost
150. Poland is third, followed by Bul
garia, Germany, Italy, and others in
diminishing numbers.

lon for the use of the American Dele
gation there appeared many publica
tions that no nation would acknowl
edge. In a few cases publications were
ascribed on their title-pages to dele
gations that disowned them and be
lieved them to be the work of rival
delegations.
The collection is not complete.
When Dr. Adams reached Paris some
of the smaller delegations had already
left, and also the stocks of some of
the publications were exhausted. Great
Britain, Belgium, and the United
States officially issued no propaganda
France did the same, but a list of
French titles was taken from the pub
lications distributed by a French gov
ernmental agency, the Maison de
Presse.
A small number of Japanese publi
cations is included. These, however,
are not really propaganda, but rather
official explanations.
The German titles listed are publi
cations that were distributed in Paris,
but which the German War Office
authenticated to Dr. Adams when he
visited Berlin in August, 1919.
The items are classed in three divi
sions. Two are authenticated, the
documents and publications "present
ed" to the Conference, many of which
were not "received," since a number
of the delegations were unacknowl
edged by the Conference, and the docu
ments distributed for effect on the
Conference. The unauthenticated divi
sion includes items that reached Dr.
Adams indirectly.
Of the items, about 1300 are au
thenticated. Jugoslavia leads the na
tions in the number of items listed in
this, with over 200. France has almost
150. Poland is third, followed by Bul
garia, Germany, Italy, and others in
diminishing numbers.

"The Catalogue of Paris Peace Con
ference Delegation Propaganda in
1919" in the Hoover War Library col
lection, recently issued, is the first
number of an intended bibliographical
series to cover all the titles in that
library. The collection, which was
gathered between May and October,
1919, in Paris, by Dr. Ephraim D.
Adams of the History department, con
tains documents authenticated by the
delegations, as well as some titles
classed as "unauthenticated." Dr.
Adams visited the delegations himself
to ask for a list of publications and
manuscripts for which each would
stand sponsor. This precaution was
taken because it was found that in
the collection made at the Hotel Cril
lon for the use of the American Dele
gation there appeared many publica
tions that no nation would acknowl
edge. In a few cases publications were
ascribed on their title-pages to dele
