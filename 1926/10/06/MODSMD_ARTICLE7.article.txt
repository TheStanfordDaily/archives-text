# REGISTRATION MAY EXCEED 3300 FOR AUTUMN QUARTER
## 
### 
There is a possibility that the regis-
I ration of students in the University
will pass the 3300 mark this quarter,
I as indicated by figures compiled last
; night. Up to that time 3179 had com
pleted registration, while 3253 had
started the process. Figures taken at
this time last year show a total of
3073 students who had completed
registration, with 3089 started.
The final total for the quarter was
3138 or over sixty more than had
completed registration by the first
Monday. If the present quarter shows
the same increase, which is highly
probable, the autumn quarter registra
tion for 1926 will be over 3300, or an
I increase of approximately 200 over
last year.
For some years past there has been
! an increase of, roughly, 200 students
registered each year, this increase
being almost entirely among the upper
division and graduate students. In
| crease in the lower division is prac
tically impossible because of the fact
I that the number of new men of lower
division standing is absolutely limited
! to 450 for each autumn quarter.
