# CARDINAL – CLUB GAME TO GIVE BIG GAME DOPE
## Weakened Olympic Club to Face Stanford Eleven Saturday O.C. STAR END QUITS Ex – Stanford Players Will Oppose 1926 Varsity; Patrick Is Coach 
### 
The Olympic Club-Stanford game
next Saturday will serve as the first
means of throwing light on the rela
tive strength of the Card and Bear j
elevens. After rough going in the first 1
half of the game the California team
broke through the clubmen's defense j
and ran up a total of 32 points before
the game ended.
Rumors are current that Captain !
Avery has withdrawn from the Olym-!
pic Club squad and if they prove true i
Coach Patrick will be without a first
class end. Avery, although just out of
high school, played a high-class game ,
of ball Saturday against the Bears. j
The Olympic Club has one of the
weakest teams in the last few years
and are far from the same eleven that
handed Stanford a 9-0 beating last
year. Nevertheless, the Bears had
their back to the wall during the first
part of the fray last Saturday and
only great defensive work on the part
of their line held the Olympians from
rushing over their goal line on two
separate occasions. After that first
spurt the club team lost its fire and
California began running up the score, j
If Coach Jack Patrick, former Stan
ford football captain, can keep his
men going at the pace they started
for a longer period Stanford may be »
in for a tougher game than the Cardi
nals expect. By next Saturday the
clubmen should be better organized
and be in better shape.
The line-up is composed largely of
former Stanford players. In the back
field are Wright at full, Kirwan at
quarter, and Campbell at half. Middle
ton is holding down the left flank job
with Raffetto at his side as left tackle.
Flood is playing center.
Sweet is the outstanding star of the
backfield. This flashy half played for
Montana last year and was one of the
best halfbacks in the conference. He
is a constant threat and a dangerous
man to be allowed to get in the open.
Three tough scrimmages have been
dealt out to the varsity this week.
"Warner has used the same line-up
every day and it appears as if Hoff
man at full and Walker at end are
more or less permanent. Bogue has
been at right half. By the end of the
week the Cards should show a very
improved game over the Oxy exhibi
tion. Better timed plays, less fumbling,
and in general a smoother running
machine should be the results of the
lard scrimmages.

their back to the wall during the first
part of the fray last Saturday and
only great defensive work on the part
of their line held the Olympians from
rushing over their goal line on two
separate occasions. After that first
spurt the club team lost its fire and
California began running up the score, j
If Coach Jack Patrick, former Stan
ford football captain, can keep his
men going at the pace they started
for a longer period Stanford may be »
in for a tougher game than the Cardi
nals expect. By next Saturday the
clubmen should be better organized
and be in better shape.
The line-up is composed largely of
former Stanford players. In the back
field are Wright at full, Kirwan at
quarter, and Campbell at half. Middle
ton is holding down the left flank job
with Raffetto at his side as left tackle.
Flood is playing center.
Sweet is the outstanding star of the
backfield. This flashy half played for
Montana last year and was one of the
best halfbacks in the conference. He
is a constant threat and a dangerous
man to be allowed to get in the open.
Three tough scrimmages have been
dealt out to the varsity this week.
"Warner has used the same line-up
every day and it appears as if Hoff
man at full and Walker at end are
more or less permanent. Bogue has
been at right half. By the end of the
week the Cards should show a very
improved game over the Oxy exhibi
tion. Better timed plays, less fumbling,
and in general a smoother running
machine should be the results of the
lard scrimmages.
The Olympic Club-Stanford game
next Saturday will serve as the first
means of throwing light on the rela
tive strength of the Card and Bear j
elevens. After rough going in the first 1
half of the game the California team
broke through the clubmen's defense j
and ran up a total of 32 points before
the game ended.
Rumors are current that Captain !
Avery has withdrawn from the Olym-!
pic Club squad and if they prove true i
Coach Patrick will be without a first
class end. Avery, although just out of
high school, played a high-class game ,
of ball Saturday against the Bears. j
The Olympic Club has one of the
weakest teams in the last few years
and are far from the same eleven that
handed Stanford a 9-0 beating last
year. Nevertheless, the Bears had
their back to the wall during the first
part of the fray last Saturday and
only great defensive work on the part
of their line held the Olympians from
rushing over their goal line on two
separate occasions. After that first
