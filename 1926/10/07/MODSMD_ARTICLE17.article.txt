# FORTY-TWO REPORT FOR STANFORD GRAY AGGREGATION POSTS
## Goof Aggregation Has Five Games Scheduled for Grid Season 
### 
With forty-two men fighting for po
sitions, Coach Hal Davis is working j
daily with his Stanford Gray squad in
preparation for their first game of the
season with the St. Mary's Reserves
on October 16th. The goofs have a
five-game schedule this year and
Coach Davis has a wealth of material
from which to choose a winning team.
Last night's scrimmage with Husky
Hunt's freshman team gave promise
of a powerful squad. Burton, fullback
of the 1928 freshman team two years !
ago, and who has returned to school
after a year's absence, looks good at
the same berth, while Baldwin, quar
terback on the 1927 freshman team
who has also been absent, is making
a strong bid for his old position.
Coach Davis has several halfbacks
worthy of the call. Wolf gives promise
of developing into a clever back. He
has plenty of weight and speed and
hits the line hard as well as kicking
and passing remarkably well. Baxter,
at full, is also showing up well.
With such men as Antonnell, cap
tain of last year's team, at one of the
ends, Reynolds at tackle, Claybaugh
at guard, and Cook at center, Coach
Davis need not worry about experi
ence. All these men are seasoned
players and know the game.
Scrimmage with the freshman team
each night furnishes the team with
plenty of good competition while next
week scrimmage with the varsity will
furnish the incentive for the men to
work
