# 1929 CARRIES OFF HONORS IN MUD STRUGGLE
## Freshmen Outnumber Second-Year Men During First of Fight DAILY'S VERDICT GIVEN Sponsor's Clothing Damaged in Fracas; No Serious Casualties 
### Frank Baker 
Following the yearly custom, the
sophomores are awarded the honors in
yesterday afternoon's mud fight be
tween their class and the freshman
class. However, the laurels go to them
not merely for sentimental reasons,
but because there was not one clean
freshman visible at the end of the
fray; and there was one sophomore.
He was on crutches and unable to be
in the conflict at all.
"We're depending on the Dippy,"
came the cry of one sophomore, fol
lowing in the wake of the hirsute Mr.
Hawley, who was leading his lambs
to the slaughter. This nearly lost the
sophomores the fight, but being broad
minded, the Daily staff decided this
second-year man had merely forgotten
the name of the paper had been
changed, so, to repeat, the sophomores
win the mud fight.
"I didn't raise my boy to be a poli
tician!" one fond mother was heard to
exclaim, when she saw all the mud
slinging that was taking place. But
what worried the writer most was a
freshman spotlessly clad in white,
white sox, white shoes, white shirt,
and white pants. That's all This
youth was watched most assiduously,
but as he was only a little fellow —
about 80 pounds little, to be exact —he
was lost sight of. He was a constant
worry until, while examining the
bathers at the big hose, the writer
found him again. Spotless white, oh,
dear, dear, dear, what would his
mother have said? Tired, torn, tat
tered, spattered, sopped, but triumph
| ant and tremendously happy, lie await
| ed his turn at the purifying waters.
In the early stage 3 of the encounter
there, seemed to be nothing but "30"
men on the field. The sophomore presi
dent was tackled and enveloped so
quickly that no one could tell what
happened to him. For several minutes
it looked as if the yearly tradition
would have to be abandoned, but the
sophomores gradually worked their
way through the surrounding cloud of
yearlings, and the tables were turned,
the tide was stemmed. Finally the
lily-wliites of the freshmen became
but muddy sights, and they one by
one succumbed before the superior
ability of the sophomores. We say
"superior ability" advisedly, for we be
lieve the freshmen will admit they
are going to be better next year. Even
now they feel confident they will win
in the next fight, scheduled for a year
hence.
"O-o-00-ooh, look, girls. See the big
fellow over there with only swimming
trunks on." This, in a loud whisper,
was overheard in a group of Stanford
women. Turning, the writer blushed to
see a dozen girls craning their necks
and tripping over one another in an
effort to better see the conquering
sophomores marching down the field.
Queeners at the fight were much cha
grined to find themselves shoved into
the background and looking over the
shoulders of the queened.
We must hurry over the cuts, bruis
es, abrasions, mud, slime, and grime,
with only a word, as 'twas truly a gory
affair. But it must be chalked up
against the freshmen that they were
not content with putting the sopho
mores in once, they put the same men
in time after time, failing to find new
ones. In fact, they put some in so
often that the sophomores got tired
climbing out and stayed in the hole.
Outside of many limps, several
bloody noses, and much damage to the i
sponsors' clothing, there have been no 1
serious casualties reported. It is an- j
nounced that the pools will be dragged j
to be sure there were no bodies over-1
looked.

happened to him. For several minutes
it looked as if the yearly tradition
would have to be abandoned, but the
sophomores gradually worked their
way through the surrounding cloud of
yearlings, and the tables were turned,
the tide was stemmed. Finally the
lily-wliites of the freshmen became
but muddy sights, and they one by
one succumbed before the superior
ability of the sophomores. We say
"superior ability" advisedly, for we be
lieve the freshmen will admit they
are going to be better next year. Even
now they feel confident they will win
in the next fight, scheduled for a year
hence.
"O-o-00-ooh, look, girls. See the big
fellow over there with only swimming
trunks on." This, in a loud whisper,
was overheard in a group of Stanford
women. Turning, the writer blushed to
see a dozen girls craning their necks
and tripping over one another in an
effort to better see the conquering
sophomores marching down the field.
Queeners at the fight were much cha
grined to find themselves shoved into
the background and looking over the
shoulders of the queened.
We must hurry over the cuts, bruis
es, abrasions, mud, slime, and grime,
with only a word, as 'twas truly a gory
affair. But it must be chalked up
against the freshmen that they were
not content with putting the sopho
mores in once, they put the same men
in time after time, failing to find new
ones. In fact, they put some in so
often that the sophomores got tired
climbing out and stayed in the hole.
Outside of many limps, several
bloody noses, and much damage to the i
sponsors' clothing, there have been no 1
serious casualties reported. It is an- j
nounced that the pools will be dragged j
to be sure there were no bodies over-1
looked.
Following the yearly custom, the
sophomores are awarded the honors in
yesterday afternoon's mud fight be
tween their class and the freshman
class. However, the laurels go to them
not merely for sentimental reasons,
but because there was not one clean
freshman visible at the end of the
fray; and there was one sophomore.
He was on crutches and unable to be
in the conflict at all.
"We're depending on the Dippy,"
came the cry of one sophomore, fol
lowing in the wake of the hirsute Mr.
Hawley, who was leading his lambs
to the slaughter. This nearly lost the
sophomores the fight, but being broad
minded, the Daily staff decided this
second-year man had merely forgotten
the name of the paper had been
changed, so, to repeat, the sophomores
win the mud fight.
"I didn't raise my boy to be a poli
tician!" one fond mother was heard to
exclaim, when she saw all the mud
slinging that was taking place. But
what worried the writer most was a
freshman spotlessly clad in white,
white sox, white shoes, white shirt,
and white pants. That's all This
youth was watched most assiduously,
but as he was only a little fellow —
about 80 pounds little, to be exact —he
was lost sight of. He was a constant
worry until, while examining the
bathers at the big hose, the writer
found him again. Spotless white, oh,
dear, dear, dear, what would his
mother have said? Tired, torn, tat
tered, spattered, sopped, but triumph
| ant and tremendously happy, lie await
| ed his turn at the purifying waters.
In the early stage 3 of the encounter
there, seemed to be nothing but "30"
men on the field. The sophomore presi
dent was tackled and enveloped so
quickly that no one could tell what
happened to him. For several minutes
it looked as if the yearly tradition
would have to be abandoned, but the
sophomores gradually worked their
way through the surrounding cloud of
yearlings, and the tables were turned,
