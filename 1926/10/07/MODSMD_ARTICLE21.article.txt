# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL SQUAD PLAYS DOUBLE HEADER SATURDAY
## 
### Joe Carroll 
Again the freshman football squad wilt
face two elevens determined to drag the
Cardinal Babes down to defeat. As a
preliminary to the Varsity-Olympic Club
clash, the first freshman team will oppose
the San Mateo Junior College outfit at
12:30 Saturday. The frosh reserves will
meet Modesto High School at 10 a.m. on
the practice field.
The first string is going to be in for a
large afternoon, as the San Mateo organi
zation has shown a lot of class. Last
Saturday they vanquished the St. Mary's
freshmen by an overwhelming score. It
will be remembered that the Catholic
squad held the Babes to a 6-2 score in
the first game of the season.
The frosh reserves are playing through
a regular schedule, so that the game with
Modesto should give Coach Hunt and his
assistants a line upon the capabilities of
the second string men. The team looked
listless in the game with Coggswell High.
