Painting of walks, buildings, trees, and telephone polls is one sopho
moric pastime in which Stanford men do not indulge. This is stated as a
matter of information, and is especially directed at the freshmen. If
there was any good reason for smearing amounts of red or green paint
all over the campus, everyone would be all for it, but at the outset it is
unreasonably destructive.
If the newcomers get a particular thrill out of wielding a paintbrush
they should ask some of the old-timers where to find a pipe, and follow
up by taking some course in the art department.
After the letters 1930 have been painted upon the road known as
Palm Drive—what has been accomplished? Yes, a nice big set of
numerals is in plain view of all who enter our gates. Below this are
a few directions for the sophomore class. If this is an example of
aesthetic beauty, go ahead and paint everything in sight.
But first of all, use good common sense. It's not good stuff and it is
dangerous. One painter encourages other painters and other painters will
cost the University a lot of money. Just as soon as students turn sotne
thing green or red the University must send someone around to remove
the unnecessary decorations. Be reasonable!
