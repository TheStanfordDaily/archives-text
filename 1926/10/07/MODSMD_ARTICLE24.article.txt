# Victory
## 
### 
Congratulations, sophomores. We hear that you won the mud fight
yesterday. Well, anyway, 1930, and the sponsors, and the Block "S" men
won a moral victory.
The only remaining freshman-sophomore fight has not passed away
like the rest of the Stanford traditions. It is still alive and kicking. The
turnout yesterday both by the first year men and by the sophisticated
second termers proved that Stanford is not ready to become a tradition
less place where young men and women come for studies alone.
The two classes observed the rules yesterday afternoon, and fought
hard for the honor of their numerals. Throwing mud was allowed and
both classes did their share. The sophomores won because they possessed
the technicque and the experience. The only consolation that we offer the
Class of 1930 is that next year they will be sophomores and have the
technique and experience.
We again congratulate the sophomores. They at least have learned
something since they entered Stanford one year agoâ€”not to expose their
brawny chest minus shirt. Keep at it, 1929; you are learning fast.
W. F. A.
