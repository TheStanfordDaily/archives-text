# Gangway! Fire!

### 
Its plenty exciting to see some good old house burned to the ground,
but the owner perhaps may not feel the same keen sense of enjoyment.
Therefore, we have a campus fire department. It is the dutv of this
organization to rush to a fire and try to save the building. But above all
they must get to the scene of conflagration as soon as possible ana in
order to increase the speed of this latter operation they have no time to
stop for traffic.
Hut several times yesterday it looked as though the fire truck would
stop, and with a few Fords ground beneath its mighty wheels. Yours may
be the fifth if a crash does come, so in the future listen closely for the
siren and when you hear itâ€”pull to one side and wait for the thundering
engine to roar past. Then on to the fire.
