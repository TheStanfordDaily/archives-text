# "AREN'T WE ALL" TICKET SALES REACH HIGH MARK
## 
### 
Seats for "Aren't We All ?" are going
fast, and according to latest reports from
the box office, the house will be soon sold
out. The play is a comedy in three acts,
and is to be presented in the Assembly
Hall on Friday, October 8.
Gordon Davis, who takes the lead, is
supported by an excellent cast, comprised
of both new and old talent, and the first
dramatic production of the autumn quar
ter gives every indication of being X tre
mendous success.
Les Kiler is giving special attention to
the stage settings. His work will be well
remembered by those who saw "R.U.R." !
This production will offer particular op- !
portunity to Kiler's genius. Unlike |
"R.U.R.," in which the setting was fan- j
tastic and decidedly futuristic, "Aren't
We All?" calls for sumptuous, somber j
house furnishings, distinctly modern in â– 
every way.
The entire action of the play takes

place in two different rooms. The first j
scene is a room in the Hon. Willie Tat
ham's home in Mayfair. The last two
acts are played in a room at Grenham
Court. In both sets, Chesterfield lounges
and luxurious rugs will furnish the at
mosphere of the day.
The plays of Frederick Lonsdale, au
thor of "Aren't We All?," are well
known in the east.
On the We.it Coast we are more ac
customed to plays of a serious nature,
but it is more rare for the light comedies
to reach this coast.
"Aren't We All ?" is a very clever play,
and is of a type not generally presented,
even by professionals, on the West Coast.
As this play has never been given in i
either Los Angeles or San Francisco, I
there is no basis for comparing it with ;
other productions given in those cities. J
It promises to be of interest to all col
lege audiences and especially to a Stan- j
ford group.
