# THE 						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
"The Bull; Sir—All this campaign in
your column against the good old sopho
tnoric customs seems a little like hitting
a man when he is down, hut perhaps it
is necessary to carry on the struggle
until the last shovelful of dirt has been
thrown in the adversary's grave. What
ever, 1 wonder if you have stopped to
think what the real reason back of all
this disgusting foolishness is. You say
yourself that the excuse of testing the
freshman spirit is no reason at all, and
you are undeniably right—nevertheless
I wonder if you actually admire the
frosh who will come out of a tub raging
with anger and planning to leave the
school as much as the one who will
laugh and look forward to another year.
But the reason 1 was going to offer is
that something is necessary to infuse a
little excitement and interest into the life
of the lower-classmen, who are not yet
over the stage of life when dullness is a
torture. Most of our upper-classmen
have accumulated enough conceit to keep
themselves interested; those who haven't,
to quote yourself, are sophomores in the
broad sense of the word.
However, the sophomoric spirit at
Stanford is dead, as it will soon be every
where. There is a reason for this de
mise, and it is because of the reason, and
not because the death of the ancient
customs, that I am in mourning. It is
that about half of the freshmen come
clothed in the conceit formerly attributed
only to juniors and seniors, and most of
the rest of them are dryballs, who will

do nearly anything to avoid excitement.
And there is nothing to be done about
it."
JIM TUCKER, '28

This is more like it. Thanks, Jim.
We do not approve of the freshman
who comes out of the tub with black
revenge in his heart. As a matter of fact,
we were thrown in a tub on only one
occasion. In this instance, we came up
out of the briny with an expression that
resembled a smile. This, partially be
cause our face, when in repose, has a
benign and cherubic expression. Did this
rate a cheer from the upperclassmen ?
It did not! On the contrary, the only
comment made was "the !!!?/*!! is
back there grinning. Let's throw him in
again."
It appears, Jim, that I was not properly
impressed with the gravity of the opera
tion, which may be defined briefly as
"alteration of character by suffocation."
I had the satisfaction of knowing that
some of our more eminent psychologists
would have grinned, too, if they had been
there.

Here is a laugh. We have it on good
authority that a law major had his A.B.
held up despite the fact that he had 180
hours, because lie lacked those courses
which were intended to "broaden" him.
He had been all over the world on the
bridge of Mister Dollar's freighters and
held master's papers for any craft afloat.
This is defined as inelasticity, and is
a quality often associated with red tape.

themselves interested; those who haven't,
to quote yourself, are sophomores in the
broad sense of the word.
However, the sophomoric spirit at
Stanford is dead, as it will soon be every
where. There is a reason for this de
mise, and it is because of the reason, and
not because the death of the ancient
customs, that I am in mourning. It is
that about half of the freshmen come
clothed in the conceit formerly attributed
only to juniors and seniors, and most of
the rest of them are dryballs, who will

do nearly anything to avoid excitement.
And there is nothing to be done about
it."

This is more like it. Thanks, Jim.
We do not approve of the freshman
who comes out of the tub with black
revenge in his heart. As a matter of fact,
we were thrown in a tub on only one
occasion. In this instance, we came up
out of the briny with an expression that
resembled a smile. This, partially be
cause our face, when in repose, has a
benign and cherubic expression. Did this
rate a cheer from the upperclassmen ?
It did not! On the contrary, the only
comment made was "the !!!?/*!! is
back there grinning. Let's throw him in
again."
It appears, Jim, that I was not properly
impressed with the gravity of the opera
tion, which may be defined briefly as
"alteration of character by suffocation."
I had the satisfaction of knowing that
some of our more eminent psychologists
would have grinned, too, if they had been
there.

Here is a laugh. We have it on good
authority that a law major had his A.B.
held up despite the fact that he had 180
hours, because lie lacked those courses
which were intended to "broaden" him.
He had been all over the world on the
bridge of Mister Dollar's freighters and
held master's papers for any craft afloat.
This is defined as inelasticity, and is
a quality often associated with red tape.
"The Bull; Sir—All this campaign in
your column against the good old sopho
tnoric customs seems a little like hitting
a man when he is down, hut perhaps it
is necessary to carry on the struggle
until the last shovelful of dirt has been
thrown in the adversary's grave. What
ever, 1 wonder if you have stopped to
think what the real reason back of all
this disgusting foolishness is. You say
yourself that the excuse of testing the
freshman spirit is no reason at all, and
you are undeniably right—nevertheless
I wonder if you actually admire the
frosh who will come out of a tub raging
with anger and planning to leave the
school as much as the one who will
laugh and look forward to another year.
But the reason 1 was going to offer is
that something is necessary to infuse a
little excitement and interest into the life
of the lower-classmen, who are not yet
over the stage of life when dullness is a
torture. Most of our upper-classmen
have accumulated enough conceit to keep
themselves interested; those who haven't,
to quote yourself, are sophomores in the
broad sense of the word.
