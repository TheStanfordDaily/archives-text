### 
Editor, Sir:
In reply to your editorial about the New
Student Handbook:
1. You are misinformed about former
publications : four out of the last six books
have been issued in paper bindings, only
the last two in fabricoid.
2. Last year's book was published with
a deficit of over $60, made up by the
Y.M.C.A. This year's costs figure slightly
less than last year's (including shipment) ;
the advertising is practically the same;
additional $50 asked from the Associated
Students will not more than meet the cost.
3. Last year's book was published in
Greenfield, Indiana, by a specialty firm
that, through a patented proccss, turns the
edges of a light weight fabricoid, to give
a binding high grade in appearance. This
year certain merchants of Palo Alto not
only refused to advertise in the handbook
if it went to an out-of-town firm, but
threatened, through the Merchants' Asso
ciation, to refuse the right to solicit ads
in Palo Alto. The lowest local bidder, the
University Press, submitted a bid about
$25 higher than the out-of-town firm,
not including shipping charges, which last
year amounted to $27.50.
4. This year's decrease in size comes
mainly from the omission of 40 pages of
"diary," which we discovered, on investi
gation, was not used last year by the
students.

5. This year's increase in costs comes
from an increase in the number of books
—from 1300 to 1500. Last year's supply
ran short during the fall quarter, so that
none of the new students of the winter and
spring quarters received books.
6. This year the entire book, with the
Handbook, was thought through with
great care, and the whole re-written, with
much useless, archaic, and fictitious infor
mation about frosh with corn-cob pipes,
ctc., omitted. Docs the editor object to
treating our new students like college
men? Does he object to setting forth
before each new man and woman the op
portunities for broadening activities and
influences in University life? If so, the
information is "worse" than that of pre
ceding years.
7. Opinions differ on this, and as to
whether athletic rivalry is the summum
bonum of a university's traditions. We
tried to interpret what we thought were
the finest traditions we have—spiritual
and intellectual culture. We thought, and
still think, that Doctor Jordan's story
of the early ideals of Stanford, and his
interpretation of its governing purposes.
is a finer and more complete introduction
to the Stanford that will live, than the
listing of athletic scores, even though
they be with California. If this be trea
son, make the most of it!

2. Last year's book was published with
a deficit of over $60, made up by the
Y.M.C.A. This year's costs figure slightly
less than last year's (including shipment) ;
the advertising is practically the same;
additional $50 asked from the Associated
Students will not more than meet the cost.
3. Last year's book was published in
Greenfield, Indiana, by a specialty firm
that, through a patented proccss, turns the
edges of a light weight fabricoid, to give
a binding high grade in appearance. This
year certain merchants of Palo Alto not
only refused to advertise in the handbook
if it went to an out-of-town firm, but
threatened, through the Merchants' Asso
ciation, to refuse the right to solicit ads
in Palo Alto. The lowest local bidder, the
University Press, submitted a bid about
$25 higher than the out-of-town firm,
not including shipping charges, which last
year amounted to $27.50.
4. This year's decrease in size comes
mainly from the omission of 40 pages of
"diary," which we discovered, on investi
gation, was not used last year by the
students.

5. This year's increase in costs comes
from an increase in the number of books
—from 1300 to 1500. Last year's supply
ran short during the fall quarter, so that
none of the new students of the winter and
spring quarters received books.
6. This year the entire book, with the
Handbook, was thought through with
great care, and the whole re-written, with
much useless, archaic, and fictitious infor
mation about frosh with corn-cob pipes,
ctc., omitted. Docs the editor object to
treating our new students like college
men? Does he object to setting forth
before each new man and woman the op
portunities for broadening activities and
influences in University life? If so, the
information is "worse" than that of pre
ceding years.
7. Opinions differ on this, and as to
whether athletic rivalry is the summum
bonum of a university's traditions. We
tried to interpret what we thought were
the finest traditions we have—spiritual
and intellectual culture. We thought, and
still think, that Doctor Jordan's story
of the early ideals of Stanford, and his
interpretation of its governing purposes.
is a finer and more complete introduction
to the Stanford that will live, than the
listing of athletic scores, even though
they be with California. If this be trea
son, make the most of it!

publications : four out of the last six books
have been issued in paper bindings, only
the last two in fabricoid.
