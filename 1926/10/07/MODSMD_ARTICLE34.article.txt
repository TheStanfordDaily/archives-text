# FRITTS ISSUES CALL FOR MORE GRID MEN
## 
### 
Don E. Fritts, manager of the senior
football team, requests that more men
turn out for the class team. Holdovers
as well as seniors are eligible to play.
To date, although enough men have
turned out to complete one team, there
Is not a sufficient number of subs to
make as strong a combination as
Fritts desires.
Under the direction of "Nip" Mc-
Hose, member of last year's senior
football team, and captain of the var
sity basketball team three years ago,
practice has been held for the past
few days. The men are looking for
ward to a successful season this year.
