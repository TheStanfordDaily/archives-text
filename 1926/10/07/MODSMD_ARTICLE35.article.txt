## 
### 
Prospects for the 1926 military polo
[ team representing the Stanford R.O.T.C.
unit were given a boost last week at
the first turnout, when Fred E. Trotter,
j ci'itain '••"! •> <• roup of ten veteran play
ers, which forms the nucleus for the
squad, reported to Coach Charles S. Whit
more, according to Major John Keliher,
I of the Military Science department.
Dates for the season's matches have not
yet been set, but a tentative schedule, ac
cording to Major Keliher, includes intcr-
I collegiate engagements with Oregon Agri
! cultural College, University of Arizona,
j and possibly with the University of Utah.
Actual playing will get under way Oc
tober 23 with a practice game with the
Thirtieth Infantry quartet of San Fran
cisco. Another service match will bring
the Cards and the Seventy-sixth Field Ar
j tillery four into play later in the season,
[ and arrangements are hanging fire for an
j engagement with the Aptos Polo Club.
Although Captain Trotter is out of play
for at least six weeks with a broken
arm, he is counted upon to hold down
number 4 position this season. E. H. Post,
Jr., a transfer, comes to Stanford with
a record which has landed him number 2
berth, while Brown and Thompson, vet
erans of last year's team, are booked for
: number 1 and number 3 respectively. Giv
! ens, Rothroc, Weymouth, Connolly, Ev
| ans, and Austin complete the first squad
' named by Major Keliher.
The Stanford quartet does not play in
' any conference, but plans are now under
! consideration for the Cardinals to enter
! the Del Monte tournament in February,
i Oregon Agricultural College is the only
[ other member of the Pacific Coast Con
i ference to support polo.
