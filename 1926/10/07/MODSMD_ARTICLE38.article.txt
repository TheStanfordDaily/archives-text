# THUNDERING HERD OF U.S.C. SHOWS STRONG OFFENSIVE STRENGTH
## Drury Pilots Trojans to Smashing Victory Over Santa Clara 
### 
With only three weeks remaining
before the game with Stanford,
U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd is fast be
coming a finished team. In the game
with Santa Clara Saturday, the Tro
jans showed a world of improvement /
and ran their opponents ragged in a?,
42 to 0 victory. The tremendous powei
of U.S.C. can be seen by comparing
this score to the one in which Cali
fornia defeated Santa Clara 13 to G.
Morley Drury, stellar halfback for
the Trojans, was the outstanding fig
ure in the game. After Morton Kaei
had been injured in the first quarter,
Drury was transferred to quarter, and
from then on he proved himself to be
the best signal caller since diet Dol
ley played for the Southernors. Up to
the time Drury went into the game,
only one touchdown had been scored,
but the heavy back soon turned a
close game into a farce by his smash
ing, savage, attacks and runs, which
demolished the strong Santa Clara
line. From Santa Clara's 35-yard line,
Drury piloted his team for a touch
down in seven plays, five times carry
ing the ball himself. He was never !
once thrown back, and his plunges and
runs from punt formation were not to
be denied.
Laraneta, speedy halfback, also
shared honors with Drury, and tore
away time and again for long gains.
With the game safely tucked away,
Jones placed Williams at quarter, and
then Elliott. Both men ran the team
excellently and made large gains
Lloyd and Max Thomas, Lee, and Hei
ser also showed up well, especially on
passes. Williams to Dorsey seemed to
be the best passing combination, and
one forty-yard pass was completed.
On the line, Cravath, Hibbs, Gorrell,
and Cox starred for U.S.C., although
the ends seemed weak.
Figures show the difference between
the teams better than words. Santa
Clara made only 2 first downs, U.S.C.
19. Out of 8 passes attempted, San f n
Clara completed 6 for 38 yards, and
had 2 intercepted; while U.S.C. com
pleted 9 out of 12 attempts for 124
yards, and had none intercepted.
In yards made, Drury made 88,
Laraneta 69, Williams 57, and Kaer
21. It appears that Drury will be
Jones' best bet in the game with
Stanford, for the former Long Beach
star not only can carry the ball, but
is U.S C.'s best interference man, and
the only consistent kicker in the back
field. The U.S.C. backfleld is complete,
but the line is not as strong as Jones
would like, and it seems to be his only
problem.
Under the present system, the Tro
jans depend chiefly on line and end
plays for their games; and waiting
for the breaks on punting.
