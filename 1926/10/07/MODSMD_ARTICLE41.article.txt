# ENGLISH CHEMIST TO JOIN DEPARTMENT AT STANFORD IN JANUARY
## 
### 
Dr. James W. Mcßain, noted re
search worker in the field of colloid
chemistry, has joined the chemistry
staff of this University, where he will
resume his investigations upon join
ing the faculty in January. Dr. Mc-
Bain comes to Stanford from the Uni
versity of Bristol, England.
Dr. Mcßain is a comparatively young
man, a Canadian hy birth, and a gradu
ate of the University of Toronto in

sity of California.

Dr. Laing is the only English woman
who ever received the Ellen Richards
Prize of $1000 in chemistry, founded
as a recognition of scientific distinc
tion in research by women It has been
awarded only three times in the last
three years, twice in America.
Dr. Mcßain, now Leverhulme Pro
fessor of Physical Science at Bristol,
is the world's acknowledged leader in
his specialty of colloids. He has been
eagerly sought by many of the prin
cipal universities both in Europe and
in America, but will take up his work
at Stanford in January, being on
leave for the first quarter of this year.
With him will come also his two
chief aids at Bristol. Dr Mary Evelyn
Laing, a research associate, and Miss
Mabel Harriett Norris, research as
sistant. They will join the Stanford
faculty, enabling Dr. Mcßain to con
tinue without interruption more than
a score of investigations he now has
