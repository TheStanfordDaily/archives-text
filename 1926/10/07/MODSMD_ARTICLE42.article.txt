"Don't make the mistake a high school
j teacher made during summer school and
j try to mail letters in the deceptive green
garbage can near the University post- j
office," advises Mrs. Marilyn Main Thom-j
as, postmaster. There is no post box on
the campus other than that in the campus j
station.
On week days five incoming deliveries j
bring campus mail between the first at {
7 :30 a.m. and the final at 5 :30 p.m. Mail
deposited in the campus station is collected
to go out on outgoing trains five times |
during the day between 6 a.m. and 4:30
in the afternoon.
If the student finds nothing in his box!
by 10:30 Sunday morning there is no;
use looking until next day as there is only
one incoming Sunday mail. Letters de-1
posited after 7:45 Sunday morning arc j
not sent out until Monday.
In case of emergency letters for air |
mail dispatch and points north and south j
may be taken to the Southern Pacific
depot and mailed on the 6:08 evening!
train. Air mail leaves San Francisco;
every day at 5:30 a.m. and letters in- 1
tended for it must be in the San Fran-I
cisco postoflicc several hours before that \
time.
