ber 25.
! This constitutes the fourth annual
'exhibition of the Institute, and is the
first time that the "Fifty Books of
j the Year" have been brought to this
community. The showing of the books
here was arranged by Professor W. H.
Davis, editor of the Stanford Univer
sity Press, and Pedro J. Leinos, di
rector of the Art Gallery.
j The exhibit is made up from books
submitted to the Institute in competi
tion, and is intended to illustrate the
work done by printers and book
! makers of the United States. The
volumes chosen by the committee are
not necessarily the fifty best-designed
books of the year, the Institute points
' out, but are offered as reoresentative
1 books of high standard, illustrating
as far as possible the various prob
lems of printing and bookmaking as
they are being met in different sec
tions of the country.
In making the selection literary con
' tent is not considered; the books are
judged solely upon their appeal to the
eye. The fifty books represent the
work of thirty-seven publishers; the
lowest-priced book is fifty cents, and
â–  the highest, $75.

In tlie week preceding the Stanford
, display the books will he shown in
