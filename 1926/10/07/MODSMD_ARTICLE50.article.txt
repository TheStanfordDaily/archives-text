# EASTERN TEAMS NOT SUPERIOR, DECLARES COACH L.C. BOLES
##

| "The idea of the superiority of eastern
j football teams is mostly propaganda. The '
; East Coast's best would meet the Pacific j
! champions on equal terms if the clash j
were in neutral territory as far as cli
: matic difficulties are concerned."
"The best football in the country is j
I played in the Big Ten conference which
the far East thinks of as western."
These statements are made by a stu- i
dent of the gridiron game who, for years, I
has watched the playing of elevens from
J all sections. He is L. C. Boles, director
jof athletics at YVooster College, Wooster, j
jOhio, who is visiting Stanford to study I
[the fundamentals of Coach Warner's sys-j
tem which he hopes to successfully intro-'
i duce in Ohio.
Coach Rockne of Notre Dame is still
feeling the loss of his "four horsemen" J
'who rode to national fame two years ago, I
j Boles believes. "But the early season !
i scores rolled up by Notre Dame won't be
la reliable indication of the strength the j
Catholics will bring to the coast against
i Southern California in December," he
says. "Rockne's favorite strategem is to
I smother weaker schools at the first of the
I season under overwhelming scores before
j they can combat his backfield shift."
Boles is taking a year's leave of absence
I from his college and attending football
practice here daily. Wooster College is
about fifty miles south of Cleveland, Ohio,
and near the home of Nip McHose, for-
mer Cardinal basketball captain.
