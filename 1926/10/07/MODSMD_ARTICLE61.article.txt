# PALO ALTO TIMES FAVORS "PIONEERS" AS STANFORD SYMBOL
## 
### 
The "Palo Alto Times," in favoring
I
the adoption of the name "Pioneers"
for Stanford in its issue of Tuesday
through the editorial columns, says:
"The suggestion has its merits.
Stanford has never been "represented"
by anything except itself, to be sure,
and has struggled along fairly suc
cessfully, even though the newspaper
cartoonists and the sports writers
have been handicapped in their ac
tivities by the lack of a name.
"There was an earnest attempt to
present the Cardinal hosts as mem
bers of the aboriginal race of the
country, but 'Indians' somehow didn't
catch anybody's heartfelt enthusiasm.
Indians never did amount to very
much and are dea dones now. There
was some talk once of setting forth
the Stanford spirit under the guise of
a red devil, but that didn't get very
far either.
"So the Stanford athletes have been
presented as 'redshirts' or 'cards' or
presented as "redshirts" or "cards"
or anything else that the hard-worked
fancy of those in need of symbolic
names could work up.
"Hopkins takes advantage of the
fairly widespread designation, "red
shirt,' and particularizes it by utiliz
ing the hardy pioneer of the early
West with his red flannel shirt,
"If Stanford students would adopt
not merely the outward appearance of
this character who knit himself into
the history and development of the
state, but his inward character of in
dependence and initiative as well for
their ideal, a great deal of good might
flow out of this courtedus attempt to
make life easier the workmen on the
sports sections of the metropolitan
dailies.
"The willingness to 'try anything
once,' is the essence of the spirit of
adventuresome yuoth which is the
spirit that really keeps the world
moving. If Stanford students could
foster this spirit of independence and
have it as an antidote fro the curi
ously contradictory characteristic of
extreme conservatism which, by a
strange anomaly, also characterizes
undergraduates when they act as a
body, it would do much to keep fresh
and vigorous the characteristic spirit
of the institution which is responsible
for the fact that Stanford has pio
neered in so many directions. Stanford
has been a leader because it retained
its youthful spirit. Continuing the
spirit will continue the leadership.
