# TENNIS MEN RETURN WITH NEW TROPHIES FOR COMING SEASON
## 
### 
Stanford tennis prospects look good
for the coming varsity season with Cap
tain Cranston Holman, exCaptain Tubby
Ogden, Alan Herrington, and Ralph Mc-
Elvenny back on the squad. Paul Fair
child was the only veteran to graduate.
With this veteran material, Coach Hal
Davis says he expects a repetition of
last year's victory over California, when
the Cardinal squad defeated the Bruins
for the first time in fourteen years.
California will be handicapped in the
future by the loss of Bud Chandler,
intercollegiate champion.
During the summer vacation Captain
Holman and former Captain Ogden went
e'ist to represent Stanford in the inter
collegiates. Holman was runner-up for
tue singles title, and in the doubles he
and his team-mate Ogden were not elimi
nated until the final rounds of compe
tition. Their showing was said to be
excellent considering their lack of prac
tice on turf courts.
Herrington, who is second ranking
varsity man, added the Los Angeles
county and Oregon state singles titles
to his list of conquests for the summer.
The inter-mountain and Colorado state
singles titles were captured by Ralph
McElvenny, two-year varsity man.
