# EUROPEAN POLITICAL LEADER TO LECTURE TODAY ON GERMANY
## 
### 
Dr. Erich Koch, eminent German I
statesman, will speak in the Little Theater :
this afternoon at 3 o'clock, instead of j
Wednesday, as was erroneously stated in j
yesterday's issue, on"The German Con- j
stitution." The lecture will be delivered j
in German.
In Dr. Koch the University has the i
privilege of meeting one of Germany's '
political leaders. Particularly during the i
reconstruction period, which was one of j
the most critical in German history, he !
held important offices in the national gov- '
crnmcnt, and was instrumental in the \
framing of the new German constitution. l
Previously he held various city and state I
offices. At present he is a member of the |
German Reichstag.
As a student of economics and political \
science, Dr. Koch wrote several articles I
during the war on the food supply of j
Germany and the housing situation, and;
subsequently two important treatises on ;
reconstruction.
As a friend of the American people
and an admirer of their institutions, Dr.
Koch is utilizing his six weeks' vacation '
tour of the United States and Canada in j
familiarizing himself with conditions in
these countries. Contrary to current ru-!
i mors, he is not here to study the subject
} of German immigration.
