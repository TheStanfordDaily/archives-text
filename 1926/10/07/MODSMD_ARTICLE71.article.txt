# TROJAN TILT CUBS' HARD TEST BEFORE "LITTLE BIG GAME"
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 7.â€”lmproving their
football tactics at each practice, Coach
Clint Evans' freshman charges are pre
paring for their first real test this season
when they meet the U.S.C. first year men
at Los Angeles on October 16. Aside
from the "Little Big Game," with Stan
ford, the Trojan tilt is the most impor
tant game on the Babe schedule.
Coach Evans will have his final chance
to see his men in action before the U.S.C.
game, this Saturday, when they take on
the Alumni Athletic Club of San Jose.
The club is not as dangerous as the
southerners, but should give the fresh
men a chance to work on plays they will
use the following Saturday on the Red
shirts.
The freshman squad has displayed
some real football this season as evi
denced by the scores run up against San
Bernardino High and the Mare Island
Hospital Corps. The lineup used against
the sailors last week worked like a vet
eran team and will undergo but few
changes in the coming events. With a
good pair of ends and a husky, power
ful line between them, the backs should
have plenty of good holes to slip through,
and any opposition will find a formidable
squad to encounter.
