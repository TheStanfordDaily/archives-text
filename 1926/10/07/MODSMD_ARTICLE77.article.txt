# RUTH HITS 3 HOMERS AS N.Y. YANKEES WIN
## 
### 
Babe Ruth, American League home run i
king, hit circuit clouts in the first, third, j
and sixth innings yesterday in the fourth ;
game of the world's series. The Yankees;
made it two games when they beat the '
St. Louis Cardinals by a 10 to 5 score.
Every member of the New York team
made one or more hits with the exception
of Waite Hoyt, youthful pitcher. Mana
ger Hornsby used five hurlcrs in a vain
attempt to stop the Yankee batsmen who i
scored four runs in the fifth inning.
With only three games remaining to be
played, a win tomorrow for the Hugmen
wiu give them the edge.
