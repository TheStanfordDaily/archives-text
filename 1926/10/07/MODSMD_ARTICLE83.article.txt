## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 7 — Bart Cock's
injury, incurred in the Olympic Club
j game Saturday, has necessitated seve
-1 »al changes in the California Varsity
line-up. Instead of slipping in a second
string tackle in Cock's place "Nibs"
has switched Fred Coltrin back to
i tackle and Giddings is holding down
j Coltrin's former post at guard. He will
I be on the sidelines this Saturday and
; probably during the O.A C, game two
weeks hence.
There is no doubt but that Coltrin
can handle the tackle berth as he was
one of the outstanding tackles in the
Conference last fall.
Giddings has shown up well in
scrimmage and in the first two games
so Cock's enforced idleness will not
wreak the havoc with the Bruin line
j that was first expected.
j During the past two weeks there
, serves have been absorbing the funda
mentals of the Notre Dame system as
played by Saint Marys, and frequent
scrimmages with the varsity will en
able "Nibs" to perfect the team's de
fense against the expected onslaught
of the "Fighting Irish."
Practice has taken on a more secre
tive aspect and the varsity have
moved from Hilgard Field to the Me
morial Stadium where a strict watch
is kept and only those with official
passes are permitted to watch the j
workouts. Practice sessions will ex
tend into the late hours as in other
years as soon as the arc lights are
installed on the rim of the stadium.
Walter Mills, a fullback, was ad
vanced from the reserve squad and i
given a varsity suit. He brings the 1
squad personnel to thirty-two men. i
