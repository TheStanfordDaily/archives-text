# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The clan of Jones seems to be at
j least a jump ahead of the clan of
| Smith in the World of Sports. While
j the latter can boast of such stars as
Mac Donald Smith, the golfer; "Oil"
, Smith, and "Sherry" Smith, ballplay
lers; and speaks reverently of the late
i Andy Smith, the famous football
coach; the Joneses seem to be per
petually cheering for a Bobby, a Sam,
or some other great athlete who wears
I the famous cognomen.
On the same day that Arnold Jones
j was giving Bill Tilden a run for his
I money at Forest Hills, and Bobbie
i Jones was trimming his friend Dick
Jones at Baltusrol, and "Sad Sam" j
Jones of the Yankees was helping to
beat the Indians in Cleveland, two j
famous brothers of the clan were put
ting their charges through the open
ing practice of the football season at
widely separated campuses. I refer to
Tad Jones, of Yale, and Howard Jones,
j of the University of Southern Califor
! nia, who collectively are as famous in
112 the fields of drop-kicks as the w. k.
Smith brothers are in the fields of i
I cough drops.
Personally, I can't help but feel sure
I that Howard Jones is a better football
coach than Tad Jones is. And that is
I not because he has, at U.S.C., the best |
| material to work with in the Avhole

United States. When Howard was !
coaching at lowa,"in 1922, he took his j
husky eleven to the Yale bowl and
trimmed his brother's team nicely. \
It's too bad that Howard's "Thunder- i
ing Herd" isn't to meet Tad's "Bull- i
dogs" this year. It would be a game I
worth going miles to see. Last year, in
his first season at the Trojan institu- '
tion, Jones' men lost two games, one
to Stanford and one to Washington
State, but ran up the prodigious num
ber of 456 points to their opponents''
55. At Yale, the team coached by the
other Jones lost to Pennsylvania and
to Princeton, and couldn't beat Har
vard, and scored 204 points while their
adversaries were scoring 76.
The Jones brothers were both foot- I
ball and baseball stars at Yale, in the
class of '08. In 1909, Howard coached
Ted Coy's team, which beat Harvard,
and in 1916, Tad coached "Cupid"
Clack's eleven, which also beat the
Crimson. These were the only two
Yale teams to defeat Harvard in thir
teen years.

ball and baseball stars at Yale, in the
class of '08. In 1909, Howard coached
Ted Coy's team, which beat Harvard,
and in 1916, Tad coached "Cupid"
Clack's eleven, which also beat the
Crimson. These were the only two
Yale teams to defeat Harvard in thir
teen years.


Those Famous Joneses
The clan of Jones seems to be at
j least a jump ahead of the clan of
| Smith in the World of Sports. While
j the latter can boast of such stars as
Mac Donald Smith, the golfer; "Oil"
, Smith, and "Sherry" Smith, ballplay
lers; and speaks reverently of the late
i Andy Smith, the famous football
coach; the Joneses seem to be per
petually cheering for a Bobby, a Sam,
or some other great athlete who wears
I the famous cognomen.
On the same day that Arnold Jones
j was giving Bill Tilden a run for his
I money at Forest Hills, and Bobbie
i Jones was trimming his friend Dick
Jones at Baltusrol, and "Sad Sam" j
Jones of the Yankees was helping to
beat the Indians in Cleveland, two j
famous brothers of the clan were put
ting their charges through the open
ing practice of the football season at
widely separated campuses. I refer to
Tad Jones, of Yale, and Howard Jones,
j of the University of Southern Califor
! nia, who collectively are as famous in
112 the fields of drop-kicks as the w. k.
Smith brothers are in the fields of i
I cough drops.
Personally, I can't help but feel sure
I that Howard Jones is a better football
coach than Tad Jones is. And that is
I not because he has, at U.S.C., the best |
| material to work with in the Avhole

United States. When Howard was !
coaching at lowa,"in 1922, he took his j
husky eleven to the Yale bowl and
trimmed his brother's team nicely. \
It's too bad that Howard's "Thunder- i
ing Herd" isn't to meet Tad's "Bull- i
dogs" this year. It would be a game I
worth going miles to see. Last year, in
his first season at the Trojan institu- '
tion, Jones' men lost two games, one
to Stanford and one to Washington
State, but ran up the prodigious num
ber of 456 points to their opponents''
55. At Yale, the team coached by the
other Jones lost to Pennsylvania and
to Princeton, and couldn't beat Har
vard, and scored 204 points while their
adversaries were scoring 76.
The Jones brothers were both foot- I
ball and baseball stars at Yale, in the
class of '08. In 1909, Howard coached
Ted Coy's team, which beat Harvard,
and in 1916, Tad coached "Cupid"
Clack's eleven, which also beat the
