### Astrid Arnoldson 
Gowns from the shops of Lanvin
and Jenny, in Paris, have been lent
to the Dramatic Council by the Em
porium for the production of Frederick
Lonsdale's comedy, "Aren't We All?"
in the Assembly Hall at 8:20 o'clock
this evening. The gowns for this pre
sentation of the play are entirely new
and different from those used in the
production this summer, with the ex
ception of one rose-colored dress.
Those lent for tonight are valued at
around $2500.
Arrangements had been made with
another firm for the clothes to be worn
by the women in the summer quarter,
but were discovered to be impracti
cable shortly before the day of the
play. Through the courtesy of Mr.
•Charles Levy of the Emporium, the
costumes for the women were ob
tained from that firm within a few
'hours of the rising of the curtain.
The play for which all these cob
tumes are being secured has in itself
•considerable promise of success, ac
cording to Gordon Davis, who not only
has directed the production, but plays
the leading part, that of Lord Gren
.ham.
Grenham is a man who, while living
in a very unconventional fashion, still
considers himself eligible to decide
what is or is not seemly in the be
havior of other people. He finds plenty
of material for his brilliant caustic
comment in the course of the play,
-offering his opinion as to the adven
ture of Margot Tatham, played by
Sarah Margaret Burns, and John Wil
locks, the young hero from Australia,
who is portrayed by Jack McGuire.
Grenham, on the other hand, has a
great deal to say on the subject of
the alienation of the affections of the
Hon. Willie Tatham, Margot's hus
band, by Kitty Lake. Jean Wakefield
has the part of Kitty, with Wayne
Newcomb playing the husband.
In spite of all his witty jabs at the
other people about him, Grenham,
however, proves not impervious to the
charms of Lady Frinton, and to his
amazement finds that she has been
ingenuous enough to capture his heart.
This clever lady is played by Eliza
beth Wilbur
The hypocrisy of the Rev. Mr. Er
nest Lynton, a part which lleidar Tor
jussen takes, adds to the complica
tions in the play. Eleanor Davidson,
who has appeared in several campus
plays, acts the part of his wife.
