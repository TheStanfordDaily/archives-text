# GERMANS RIPE FOR PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY
## Dr. Erich Koch Beliees Teuton Republic Can Stand Stréss CLAIMS MONARCHY DEAD State Constitution Embodies Self-Determination For Nations

(The Stanford Daily is indebted to
Dr. Karl G. Rendtdorff of the German
i department for the following report
of Dr. Erich Koch's lecture in German
at the Little Theatre yesterday.)
"The events of the last seven years
are a proof that the German people
were ripe for a democracy," declared
Dr. Erich Koch, former secretary of
| the interior and one of the most in
| fluential statesmen of the German
; Republic, in his lecture yesterday
! afternoon. C. D. Marx, professor emeri
tus of engineering, introduced Dr.
Koch in German.
Dr. Koch had for his subject the
; Constitution of the German Republic
of August 11, 1918, which he himself
helped to frame. This constitution
came into existence at a most critical
period of Germany's history, the Ger
man army had been defeated, the
; Revolution called by Dr. Koch a "mili
< tary revolution" had broken out, and
Bolshevism threatened from the East.
A constitution made under such con
ditions could not be the result of calm
deliberation but had to be made rap
idly. Yet it has served as the founda
tion on which the structure of the
new German Republic has been erect
ed which has stood the stress of the
last seven years.
I The speaker then discussed the re
lation of the several states to the cen
! tral government. This question is
especially difficult as in the old Ger
man Empire the several states, now
republics, had formed sovereign king
doms and principalities. Germany, like
the U.S.A., has a federal form of gov
ernment, not a unitary, as has France.
Too strong centralization, it was
thought, might produce indifference
on the •■part of the states, too much
t power left to the states might lead to
I steps taken by an individual state
| harmful to the nation at large.
Discusses Church
Dr. Koch discussed the position of
the church in the new republic.
Church and State are now separated,
but the State subsidizes the Church
to some extent. The speaker thought
that through independence from the
I state the Church would gain in vital
| ity.
Stress was laid on the fact that the
Constitution is singular in
that it accepts International Law as
* effective and binding.
| Dr. Koch then pointed out that the
L German Constitution embodied the
principle of self-determination of small
nations, which means that Germany
1 has given up any intention of adding
| to its territory by wars of conquest.
Republic Will Last
The speaker finally took up the
question anxiously discussed during
] the last years: "Will the German Re-
I public last?" The speaker answered
this question with an emphatic "Yes,
Germany is going to continue on the
road which she has entered upon."
The monarchy has outlived itself in
Germany. A monarch's strength does
not consist in the power which he has,
but in the faith in this power held by
himself and held by those over whom
he rules. This faith in monarchial
power is gone. The events of the war
and the years that have passed since
then, have been too strong not to de
stroy the illusion under which the
Germans may have labored regarding
the divine right of kings and the value
of monarchism.
If the new Republic should succeed
in permeating the state with a genuine
I spirit of democracy and imbue the
people with the spirit of the responsi
bility of the individual to the state,
then the stability of the German Re
public will be assured and in this
; spirit the German Constitution was
conceived.

; spirit the German Constitution was
conceived.
(The Stanford Daily is indebted to
Dr. Karl G. Rendtdorff of the German
i department for the following report
of Dr. Erich Koch's lecture in German
at the Little Theatre yesterday.)
"The events of the last seven years
are a proof that the German people
were ripe for a democracy," declared
Dr. Erich Koch, former secretary of
| the interior and one of the most in
| fluential statesmen of the German
; Republic, in his lecture yesterday
! afternoon. C. D. Marx, professor emeri
tus of engineering, introduced Dr.
Koch in German.
Dr. Koch had for his subject the
; Constitution of the German Republic
of August 11, 1918, which he himself
helped to frame. This constitution
came into existence at a most critical
period of Germany's history, the Ger
man army had been defeated, the
; Revolution called by Dr. Koch a "mili
< tary revolution" had broken out, and
Bolshevism threatened from the East.
A constitution made under such con
ditions could not be the result of calm
deliberation but had to be made rap
idly. Yet it has served as the founda
tion on which the structure of the
new German Republic has been erect
ed which has stood the stress of the
last seven years.
I The speaker then discussed the re
lation of the several states to the cen
! tral government. This question is
especially difficult as in the old Ger
man Empire the several states, now
republics, had formed sovereign king
doms and principalities. Germany, like
the U.S.A., has a federal form of gov
ernment, not a unitary, as has France.
Too strong centralization, it was
thought, might produce indifference
on the •■part of the states, too much
t power left to the states might lead to
I steps taken by an individual state
| harmful to the nation at large.
Discusses Church
Dr. Koch discussed the position of
the church in the new republic.
Church and State are now separated,
but the State subsidizes the Church
to some extent. The speaker thought
that through independence from the
I state the Church would gain in vital
| ity.
Stress was laid on the fact that the
Constitution is singular in
that it accepts International Law as
* effective and binding.
| Dr. Koch then pointed out that the
L German Constitution embodied the
principle of self-determination of small
nations, which means that Germany
1 has given up any intention of adding
| to its territory by wars of conquest.
Republic Will Last
The speaker finally took up the
question anxiously discussed during
] the last years: "Will the German Re-
I public last?" The speaker answered
this question with an emphatic "Yes,
Germany is going to continue on the
road which she has entered upon."
The monarchy has outlived itself in
Germany. A monarch's strength does
not consist in the power which he has,
but in the faith in this power held by
himself and held by those over whom
he rules. This faith in monarchial
power is gone. The events of the war
and the years that have passed since
then, have been too strong not to de
stroy the illusion under which the
Germans may have labored regarding
the divine right of kings and the value
of monarchism.
If the new Republic should succeed
in permeating the state with a genuine
I spirit of democracy and imbue the
people with the spirit of the responsi
bility of the individual to the state,
then the stability of the German Re
public will be assured and in this
; spirit the German Constitution was
conceived.
