Dr. Karl G. Rendtdorff of the German

of Dr. Erich Koch's lecture in German
at the Little Theatre yesterday.)
"The events of the last seven years
are a proof that the German people
were ripe for a democracy," declared
Dr. Erich Koch, former secretary of
| the interior and one of the most in

; Republic, in his lecture yesterday
! afternoon. C. D. Marx, professor emeri
tus of engineering, introduced Dr.
Koch in German.
Dr. Koch had for his subject the
; Constitution of the German Republic
of August 11, 1918, which he himself
helped to frame. This constitution

Bolshevism threatened from the East.
A constitution made under such con
ditions could not be the result of calm
deliberation but had to be made rap
idly. Yet it has served as the founda
tion on which the structure of the
new German Republic has been erect
ed which has stood the stress of the
last seven years.

especially difficult as in the old Ger
man Empire the several states, now
republics, had formed sovereign king
