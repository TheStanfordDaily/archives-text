# EMERSON BELIEVES DEBATE ACTIVITIES ENJOYING NEW ERA
## Intellectuals Exhibit New Interest in Campus Forensic Work 
### 
A dccidcd renaissance now going on in
Stanford forensic activities was noted
by Professor James G. Emerson, faculty
adviser of debating, in an address last
night before the members of Euphronia
Debating Society and a representation of
freshmen, in the interest of whom the
meeting was held.
"There is a growing boldness on the
part of intellectually minded students in
asserting their proclivities, with a result
ant revival of interest in what after all
the University stands for," he said.
Stanford Aims Change
The aims of Stanford debaters have
changed from winning at any cost to pre
senting clear and sincere arguments, de
veloped after an honest search for the
facts, Professor Emerson asserted. He
commended in particular the Euphronia
tradition of independence of thought, a
tradition which coincides with the new
philosophy of debating being accepted
.today in American colleges.
Stanley Weigel, president of the
A.S.S.U., spoke briefly on the value of
debating and the pleasant associations
made in participating in the activity.
Freshmen Try Out
Approximately forty were present last
night, a large proportion of this number
being first year men. Most of these will
try out for membership at a meeting
of the organization next Thursday. The
entrance requirement will be the satis
factory delivery of a five minute speech.
"A coherent noise is all that is expected
of you," President H. W. Peterson told
| the freshmen.
Theodore Bacr, last year's debate man
! ager, told of the early days of intercol
legiate forcnsics and the "knock-down,
drag-out" style of the 'nineties.
