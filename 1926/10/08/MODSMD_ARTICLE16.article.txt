# CHILD ECONOMIC UNIT OF SOCIETY STATES PRESIDENT WILBUR
## Stanford Executive Speaker At Banker's Conclave In Los Angeles 
### 
"In human society the great eco
nomic unit is not the dollar, but the
child," declared President Wilbur in
an address on "Knowing How and
Why," delivered before the convention
of the American Bankers' Association
Tuesday in Los Angeles. Wilbur as
sumed his duties here yesterday after
giving several talks in the South. #
"Upon the character, education, and
other qualities of the child depend the
stability of our economic structure,"
said Wilbur. "With the masked in
crease in our fund of human knowl
edge, with the greater use of the high
grade expert, if society should fail to
proddce a sufficient number of compe
tently trained experts our structure
would stagger and perhaps fall. There
cannot be too much knowledge, too
much education, too much informa
tion in the type of civilization which
we have developed."
"Our public utilities andtaoinshrdlu
The speaker went on to say, "To me
the most significant fact in this coun
try at the present time is the crowd
ing into our institutions of higher
learning of large numbers of students,
literally hundreds of thousands, seek
ing further training. This means not
only the capacity of the race to set
free its youthful members for further
development but the ambition of our
young people not only to keep step,
but to lead.
"By the training given in these uni
versities there is the opportunity of
developing the leaders that are requi
site for our race. Whether we like it or
not, we have the herd instinct, we are
of the follow-the-leader type, and our
safety depends .upon the quality of
our leadership. Leadership now must
have the background of sound infor
mation if it is to be secure. Our gov
ernment is constructed on the basis
of majority control. The majority, if
uneducated and untrained, can make
mistakes of such a character that they
would be practically irreparaole.
"Education, as our forefathers saw, '
is the protector of our democracy. Edu
cation is preparation for the future.
It needs to be fresh, enterprising, and
willing to try new things. It needs to
have in it that spirit that we associ
ate with religion. It needs a sound
moral basis and it must enhance in the
individual the sense of his responsi
bility to his neighbor and the need of
contributing his share to the general
welfare."
While in the South President Wil
; bur spoke at a luncheon given by the
Stanford Club of Los Angeles. In his
talk to the alumni he discussed Stan
j ford affairs and outlined the Univer
sity's problems in view of the rapid
! development of Junior Colleges
| throughout the state.
He told the alumn that it is inevi
! table that, in time, the ground covered
; by the present lower division in the
; universities will become a part of the
| public education system and be com
bined with the last two years of the
present high school course. The ques
tion confronting Stanford is to de
termine what it will do in the face of
this inevitable situation.
The President's address before the
University, which was meeting in an
other room in the same building, was
on the subject of "New Forces in the
Pacific."

the most significant fact in this coun

learning of large numbers of students,

only the capacity of the race to set
free its youthful members for further
development but the ambition of our
young people not only to keep step,
but to lead.
"By the training given in these uni

developing the leaders that are requi

not, we have the herd instinct, we are
of the follow-the-leader type, and our
safety depends .upon the quality of
our leadership. Leadership now must
have the background of sound infor

moral basis and it must enhance in the

While in the South President Wil
; bur spoke at a luncheon given by the
Stanford Club of Los Angeles. In his
talk to the alumni he discussed Stan
j ford affairs and outlined the Univer
sity's problems in view of the rapid
! development of Junior Colleges
| throughout the state.
He told the alumn that it is inevi
! table that, in time, the ground covered
; by the present lower division in the
; universities will become a part of the
| public education system and be com
bined with the last two years of the
present high school course. The ques
tion confronting Stanford is to de
termine what it will do in the face of
this inevitable situation.
The President's address before the
University, which was meeting in an
other room in the same building, was
on the subject of "New Forces in the
Pacific."
"In human society the great eco
nomic unit is not the dollar, but the
child," declared President Wilbur in
an address on "Knowing How and
Why," delivered before the convention
of the American Bankers' Association
Tuesday in Los Angeles. Wilbur as
sumed his duties here yesterday after
giving several talks in the South. #

other qualities of the child depend the
stability of our economic structure,"
