# CARDINAL ELEVEN PREPARED FOR OLYMPIC CLUB CONTEST
## Coach Warner May Change Starting Lineup in Backfield ALUMNI BATTLE CARDS Olympians "Het Up" After Humiliating Defeat By California 
### Jim Adams 
After a week of hard drill the Stanford
j eleven will take the field tomorrow after
noon at 2 :30 o'clock against the Olympic
I Club team in a game that will be inter
j esting regardless of the closeness because
| of the comparison it will afford of the
relative strength of the Card and Hear
elevens. There is good reason to doubt,
however, that the Cardinals will run up
a score as large as California piled up
last Saturday.
One reason lies in the fact that the
Olympians are all "bet up" about their
humiliating defeat last week and have
! spent a week of determined practice with
i the view of redeeming themselves against
! Stanford. Another reason is that Warner
will not play his first team for a very
long period if a sufficient lead can be
gained. He still has a few men to test
and will probably use this opportunity to
do so.
Stars in Lineup
Vigorous denials have met the rumors
that the Olympic Club's two stars, Cap
tain Avery and Russell Sweet, will be
out of the lineup, so the Olympians will
present their full strength. The former
I Stanford players in the lineup and Coach
! Patrick are well versed in what to expect
, from the Cards and should be fairly well
preared to cope with what the Red Shirts
I have to offer.
Although "Popp" has used a backfield
in scrimmage this week composed of
, Hoffman, Murphy, Bogue, and Post, it
would not be surprising for him to start
an entirely different combination Satur
day. Bogue might be tried at full and a
! new backfield combination may also be
introduced. No definite lineup has been
iannounced.
The Olympic Club team will be about
> the same as that which started against
| the Bears. Middleton and Captain Avery
will be at the right and left +anks re
j spectively with Kuhn and Raffeto in the
1 same order at taelsckles. Gridley at right
guard, Daley at left and Flood at center
compose the remainder of the forward
wall. Kirwan will call signals with Sweet
and either Clarke or Campbell at halfs.
! Wright will play full.
