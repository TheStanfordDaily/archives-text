# Sport Hour

Good morning, folks, station TSD broadcasting. The Stanford-
Olympic Club football game will be on the air tomorrow afternoon at
2:00 o'clock.
The contest tomorrow will give dopesters their first opportunity to
get a line on the Big Game, California having met and defeated the club
team last Saturday to the tune of 32-0. (Static static.) To make the dope
more unreliable, it must be remembered that the Cards have one week
more practice than the Bears had when they encountered the Winged "O"
eleven. (Static static.)
The Olympic Club team is the closest thing that we have to a
Stanford alumni aggregation. In the lineup are Middleton, '25 ; Wright,
'25; Kirwan, '26; Raffetto, '27; Flood, '25; Campbell, '24; Dorcey, 28.
The. team is coached by Tat rick, '22.
Although the club eleven scored a 9-0 victory over the Stanford team
last season, even the most pessimistic Cardinal rooter does not predict
that the score will be particularly close tomorrow. Professional football
promoters lured many of the stars from the club team after the season
was over last year.
We predict that the game tomorrow will be interesting, and well
worth seeing. The fact that Stanford plays its first Conference game in
two weeks should add to the interest in the contest tomorrow in the
stadium. (Static static.)
We will now broadcast the usual morning stock and bond quotations—
—W. F. A.
