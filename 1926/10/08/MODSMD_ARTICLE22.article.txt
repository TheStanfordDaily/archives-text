A letter will be distributed tomorrow to the presidency of all living
groups concerning the A.S.S.U. concert pledges that were made last
spring. The presidents are asked to read the letter, and then collect the
pledges so that the money can be mailed to the committee on Monday.
The series of concerts that has been planned is a treat that the lovers
of music cannot afford to miss. Louis Graveure, baritone, will be the
first singer on the year's program. Other events that are included on
the musical list are the Mischa Elman String Quartet, the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, Rosa PonseHe, eminent soprano, and Tito Schipa,
famous tenor.
The price that is asked for this series of concerts is so small that it
will not even be mentioned here. It is a modern example of Madame
Opportunity knocking at your door. Will you allow her to cuter?
