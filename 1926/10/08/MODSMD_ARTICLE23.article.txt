# Open Season
## 
### 
It is now open Season on roaring cutouts. For the past few days the
motor cops have been warning auto owners on the campus to keep all
mufflers closed. But henceforth, according to an announcement made by
Fred I'relic yesterday, a summons will be the only answer to students
who leave open the cutouts of their machines.
In or out of class hours, near the Quad or on Palm Drive, open
mufflers can only be a nuisance on the campus. At any rate the hunting
season has begun in earnest, and a trip to San Jose may reward unwary
offenders.
