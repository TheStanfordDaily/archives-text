# THE
						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
President Wilbur, in a recent ad
dress before the Student Body, called
attention to the fact that he had never
relinquished to the student govern
ment the censorship of campus pub
lications. Furthermore, the president
said, he still had the power to punish
those who violated the precepts of
decency.
The test for indecency in publica
tions was to be simple, he said. There
must be nothing published that one
would not send home for his sixteen
year-old sister to read.

The president's meaning is clear,
much clearer, in fact, than the cri
terion he has designated. In this day,
the amount «112 indecency which is ad
visable for the perusal of sixteen-year
old sisters is a debatable quantity.
* * *
This fact does not alter the issue,
which is simply that the administra
tion strongly disapproves of indecency
in any form whatsoever, and fully in
tends to keep it out of those publica
tions which represent Stanford to t the
outside world.
There are those who have asked, in
the brief time which has elapsed since

this dictum was laid down, why the
president shouldn't assume responsi
bility for this phase of campus moral
ity any more than for others.
It is well to pause at this juncture
and contemplate the situation. In the
last analysis, whatever odious impres
sion of Stanford gets abroad, what
ever wild-eyed notion of college itn
morality finds its way into the lurid
imagination of the hoi-poloi, President
Wilbur is the man who must answer
j to the parents of undergraduates and
to alumni. It is for this reason that
he maintains the prerogative of mak
ing the external appearance of Stan
ford a true representation of the Uni
versity as he sees it.
* * ♦
Only one issue remains unsettled. It
is still questionable whether or not it
is worth while to cater to those who
get their impressions of a university
i from the college comic magazines and
\ the Sunday supplements. In short, one
may still doubt that it is of any im
portance whatsoever that, to the read
ers of college comics, the average uni
versity student furnishes the stimulus
for the founding of all young ladies'
| hiking societies.
