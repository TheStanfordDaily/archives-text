Editor Stanford Daily:
Dear Sir:
Upper Division students are reminded
that tht* Independent Study Plan was in
augurated at Stanford in January, 1926,
and remains in force.
Under this plan, students of exceptional
promise may work ahead in thei rchosen
field, without being hindered by certain
formal requirements. Two facts, however,
must be emphasized: that th elndependent

Study Plan offers an opportunity to work
harder, and not the reverse; and that it
.applies to the method of study, not to the
aims, which remain the same as with the
j usual system.
The plan is administered through the
j schools aud departments, and all students
! interested are requested to confer at the
earliest possible time with their depart
mental advisers.
ALBERT GUERARD,
Chairman, I.S.P. Committee
