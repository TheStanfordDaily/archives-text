# FRESHMAN GRIDIRON MEN OPPOSE TWO TEAMS TOMORROW
## San Mateo Junior College, Modesto High School, Will Play Babes 
### 
Tomorrow the freshman football squads
I play two games. The first string outfit
meets the San Mateo Junior College at
| 12:30 as a ctM'tain-raiser to the Varsity-
Olympic Club contest. The second team
entertains the Modesto High Sschool on!
| the practice field at 10 :30.
"If the team keeps up the rate of!
1 growth that it has shown during the past
week," said Coach Husky Hunt, "they j
will have an even chance of defeating the!
great Bruin Cub team, a team that held j
the California varsity to two touchdowns j
in forty minutes of scrimmage last week. ]
They say that this year's California fresh-j
man team is the best that that institution
has had in the last ten years. But our
boys are willing and we will be ready for j
the Little Big Game.
Chances Look Bright
[ Chances for a victory Saturday and a!
continued successful season took on a!
; brighter hue as the result of the show
ing that the freshmen made in scrimmage
last night against the Grays. The Babes
scored two touchdowns and held the
Grays in the middle of the field.
The freshmen looked good <on both
offense and defense. The Grays were un-1
able to make any consistent gains either
through the line or around the tackles. 1
Albcrtson, Steinbeck, and Hcineke were I
: brilliant in defensive work for the year-!
lings Rehrig, at end. and Snyder, play- j
ing guard, for the Grays, smeared sev-,
eral freshman plays.
When it came to carrying the ball, a
freshman named Frentrup distinguished
himself. This young man can run the
'ends or go inside tackle with equal fa
cility. He is also a consistent punter and
passer. Murphy, May, and Smith looked
we 1,1 at half. Hobdy and Simpkins took
care of fullback. Hulen, Templeman,
and Linley were brilliant in line work.
This scrimmage served to test the
strength and development of the yearling
squad and gave Coach Hunt an idea of
the way his men are learning to co
operate.
