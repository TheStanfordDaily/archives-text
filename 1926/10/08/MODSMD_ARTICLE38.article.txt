# PAVILION HAS NEW LIGHTING SYSTEM
## 
### 
New twelve-foot candle intensity
lights, costing approximately $2700,
have been tested and installed in the
basketball pavilion. University Elec
trical Engineer Walter Mac Donald
drew up the technical plans of the
lighting system and was assisted by
A. L. Roth, comptroller, and A. R.
Masters, graduate manager.
In Wednesday night's test the new
lights showed a great improvement
over the old system which was of two
foot candle intensity. Statistics from
the research laboratory of the Elec
trical Engineering department show
that from eight- to ten-foot candle
intensity light is considered good
lighting for indoor games and for some
conditions six- to eight-foot candle in
tensity is sufficient. The test in the
pavilion showed a little better than
twelve feet candle light intensity.
The new system affords an excellnnt
playing light for games and eye-strain
for both players and spectators will
be considerably lessened than under
the old semi-indirect lighting arrange
ment. Another advantage is that the
new plan allows greater variety of
novel lighting effects for dances and
entertainments
