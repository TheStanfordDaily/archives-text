# CALIFORNIA NAVAL R.O.T.C. WILL WEAR TAILORED UNIFORM
## 
### 
Specially tailored blue uniforms with
long trousers and double-breasted coats
with gold buttons, and caps which can
be made either blue or white, depending
upon weather condtions, will adorn the
personnel of the University of California
naval R.O.T.C. unit before the end of
this month, Commander C. W. Nimitz,
chairman of the department of naval
science and tactics, announced yesterday.
The complete equipment will include
white working clothes, leggings, gloves,
and a black necktie, in addition to the
regular blue uniform.
The insignia of the unit will be com
posed of an anchor in combination with
the letters "U.S.N." and "R.0.T.C."
These will be worked out in gold and
when placed against the blue material of
the coat will form the University's colors
as well as those of the naval academy.
The uniform in general will closely re
semble that worn by midshipmen at An
napolis.
The course as outlined for the sixty
freshmen enrolled in the unit, will in
clude, besides regular classroom nstruc
tion and field drills on the campus, an
nual summer cruises aboard a man-of
war of the United States fleet.
"It is probable that three of these
trips, each of fifteen days' duration, will
be held during the summer for the ac
commodation of the students, since it is
expected that a choice of cruises will be
granted," Commander Nimitz said.
Upon the completion of the four-year
course the student will be commissioned
as an ensign in the Naval Reserves,
which is equivalent to the rank of second
lieutenant in the army reserves.
