# WHITE ANT INVASION FACES U.S., STATES CALIFORNIA FXPERTS
## 
### 
Fears that an invasion of termites,
wood-devouring "white ants," is facing
the United States have been discred
ited by Professor Sol F. Light of the
University of California zoology de
partment.
Speciments from the droves that
are attacking the wooden structures of
Pasadena which had been sent to
Professor Light by Walter Putnam,
building inspector of that city, have
been found to be members of a do
mestic variety and not immigrants
from the Hawaiian Islands.
With Honolulu, where the pest is a
real danger, only a few days' trip
away, he is afraid that the destructive
insects may yet make their way across
the Pacific and give rise to nation
wide threat.
The termites in Pasadena, however,
have been definitely proved to be the
type commonly found on the Pacific
Coast, and this decision makes an im
mediate danger improbable, Professor
Light declares.
"Apparently the damage they are
causing there will have to be curbed
by termite-proof construction of build
ings," he said. "But the danger from
this variety is not so acute as it would
be if the Oriental species should find
its way here."
Professor, Light has spent fifteen
years in the Orient, and has made ter
mites and anti-termite contrivances
his principal study. A shield to exclude
the insects from buildings has been
invented by the zoology professor, who
expects' to return soon to the Orient
to continue his experiments and in
vestigations.
