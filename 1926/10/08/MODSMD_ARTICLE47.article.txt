# FENCING PROSPECTS BRIGHT; THIRTY-TWO MEN OUT FOR SQUAD
## 
### 
With thirty-two men signed up for
the squad, including last year's cap
tain and last year's University cham
pion, fencing prospects this season are
unusually bright.
Gaeton Zucco, 1925 University cham
pion, and Ted Criley, captain of last
year's team, are the two men on whom
Coach Elwynn Bugge is basing most
of his hopes for a winning outfit.
Three others are needed to complete
the team, but with such a wealth of
material this should be comparatively
easy. Of the new men, many are show
ing much promise, Bugge stated last
night.
H. C. Adams, a freshman, and there
fore not eligible for varsity competi
tion now, should be the mainstay of
the 1930 team. He fenced with the
Olympic Club two years before com
ing to Stanford.
Although the intercollegiate season
does not start until January, several
matches with clubs have been sched
uled for the present quarter. The
regular season will open with matches
with California, Southern Branch, and
probably U.S.C. The Trojans were not
met last season, but both California
and Southern Branch were downed by
the Stanford foil-wielders.
