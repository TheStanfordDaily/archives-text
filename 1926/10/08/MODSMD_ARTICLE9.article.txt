# GUESSERS FAVOR CARDS TO BEAT WINGED O'S
## 
### 
Stanford is decidedly favored to win
tomorrow's grid battle against the
Olympic Club if the football score
contest, which is posted in Jim's Bar
ber Shop in the New Union, can be
taken as an indicator. Scores ranging
all the way from 40-0' to 10-0 have
' been picked by seventy-eight Univer
sity students and professors. No one
of the seventy-eight favors the Club
to win.
The score contest is open to all stu
dents and professors in Stanford and
the one guessing closest to the right
score of each Cardinal game will re
ceive the award of $2. The contest
closes Saturday at noon and the win
ner will be announced Monday. The
will be continued throughout
the football, basketball, and track sea
sons.
