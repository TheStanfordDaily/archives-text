The Last Week j
OF OUR I
21st Anniversary j
Sale j
I The last week of what we consider to be a very successful
sale is about to end. This is indeed an opportunity for
I every one who wishes to cut down their budgets for
winter necessities. When you know in advance that you
will need certain things during the next few months, it is
very unwise to not take advantage of the savings we are
offering this week. The ten-per-cent discount which we
give on everything in the store that is not already reduced
!more should be an inducement to the thrifty housewife.
And the extraordinary special bargains throughout the
entire store where costs and profits have been forgotten
should be a real inspiration to the bargain-seeker.
We remind you—take heed—act now, while the door to
economy is still wide open, for next week will be too late.
