High Praise is given by the London
Times to the late President John C.
Branner's translation of Herculano's
"History of the Origin and Establish
ment of the Inquisition in Portugal."
Nearly a column is devoted to the re
view.
The book, written by one of the
most distinguished historians of mod
ern times, has been constantly re
printed, since it first appeared in 1552,
in Portuguese.
"It has never before been translated
into English," says The Times, "yet
it was a work well worth doing, and
has now been done exceedingly well.
There is scarcely a sentence anywhere
which reads at all stiffly, as a transla
tion is apt to do; yet the rendering
is strictly accurate throughout, and
the sense has been carefully and fully
kept."
