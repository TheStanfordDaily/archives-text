# THREE AUTOS FIGURE IN WEEK-END SMASH
## 
### 
Three autos figured and were dis
figured in an accident which occurred
at the intersection of the county road
and Santa Ynez street Saturday noon.
Charles E. Beardsley, president of
the student body two years ago, was
coming down Santa Ynez at the same
time a Jordan car driven by Lionel
Schroeder of Menlo Park, was ap
proaching the crossing from Mayfleld.
The two autos crashed and slid across
the street into the car of Dr. Alvin
Cox of Palo Alto, whose machine was
parked next to the grammar school.
Dr. Cox's daughter was thrown out of
the rear seat but escaped with minor
bruises.
Neither Beardsley nor Schroeder
were injured, but all three cars were
badly smashed up. According to Fred
W. Frehe, foreman of outside proper
ties on the campus, the accident might
have been averted had the cars ap
proached the crossing with less speed.
