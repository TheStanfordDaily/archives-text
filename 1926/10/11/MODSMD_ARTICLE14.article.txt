# CONFERENCE TILTS CONCEDE NO TEAM EDGE FOR HONORS
## Washington State, Montana, Oregon Occupy Cellar Positions 
### G.W. Story 
Oregon and Washington State joined
Montana in the list of Pacific Coast
Conference teams to fall by the way
side as a result of their defeats at the
hands of Washington and TI.S.C., re
spectively, Saturday afternoon. Mon
tana dropped deeper into the cellar
by losing to Idaho.
Judging from Saturday's showings,
there is little to choose between the
Conference squad? still in the running.
Washington and the Oregon Aggies
showed more than any of the other
leaders, but their victories were none
too overwhelming.
Washington defeated Oregon 23 to
9 at Portland, after allowing the Web
feet to lead 9 to 7 at the end of the
half. In the final quarters, however,
the Huskies opened an attack that
completely subdued the Lemon-Yellow
aggregation and showed the fans that
even without George Wilson and El
mer Tesreau they are in the race.
Washington Strong
The new Washington backfield, fea
turing Guttormsen, Patton, and Louis
Tesreau, ripped the Oregon line to
shreds in the last half and the Seattle
forwards stopped everything Oregon
had to offer. This game showed that
either Washington is much stronger
or Oregon much weaker than early
season dope gave fans reason to be
lieve.
The Aggies won from Gonzaga 26
to 6 and looked good while doing It.
Their line outcharged the Bulldogs,
their forward passes fooled Clipper
Smith's men, and their backs carried
the ball for consistent gains. When
these Aggies play California at Berke
ley next Saturday they are very likely
to hand the Bears their first Confer
ence setback.
Howard Jones' Trojans won from
Washington State, but there, too,
something went wrong. The score was
a mere 16 to 7, and for some reason
the Thundering Herd failed to boom.
Either Babe Hollingbery has worked
wonders with the Cougars or the
U.S.C. warriors are not quite what
their early-season victories pointed
them out to be. Perhaps they just had
an "off day" such as they experienced
when the Cougars invaded their camp
last season.
Charley Erb's Idaho squad showed
a good variety of plays to win from
Montana 27 to 12. True, Montana is
none too strong, but Idaho was not
rated much better, if as good. Idaho
plays Washington next Saturday and
after that game it will be easier to
tell just what to expect from Erb's
charges.
California, as was expected, met de
feat at the hands of St. Mary's in a
non-conference game, but a very im
portant one. For several seasons the
Fighting Irish have been trying to win
from the Bears, and at last their am
bition has been realized. The Bears
did not show much except Paul Cly
mer, a real punter.
Card Victory Hollow
Stanford's showing did not thrill the
fans who saw the game the Cards put
up against the Olympic Club, and al
though the Redshirts won, their vic
tory was hollow. The Cards just could
not get their attack started, and pen
alties kept them fighting for 25 yards
instead of 10 to make first down as a
result of setbacks for holding. The
Redshirts suffered the loss of about
150 yards as a result of penalties.
If comparative scores mean any
thing, which they fortunately do not,
Washington and the Oregon Aggies
have the edge over their rivals, but
scores signify nothing as to a team's
power, so it seems, so the Conference
title still belongs to any one of the
six unbeaten teams.

side as a result of their defeats at the
hands of Washington and TI.S.C., re
spectively, Saturday afternoon. Mon
tana dropped deeper into the cellar
by losing to Idaho.
Judging from Saturday's showings,
there is little to choose between the
Conference squad? still in the running.
Washington and the Oregon Aggies
showed more than any of the other
leaders, but their victories were none
too overwhelming.
Washington defeated Oregon 23 to
9 at Portland, after allowing the Web
feet to lead 9 to 7 at the end of the
half. In the final quarters, however,
the Huskies opened an attack that
completely subdued the Lemon-Yellow
aggregation and showed the fans that
even without George Wilson and El
mer Tesreau they are in the race.
Washington Strong
The new Washington backfield, fea
turing Guttormsen, Patton, and Louis
Tesreau, ripped the Oregon line to
shreds in the last half and the Seattle
forwards stopped everything Oregon
had to offer. This game showed that
either Washington is much stronger
or Oregon much weaker than early
season dope gave fans reason to be
lieve.
The Aggies won from Gonzaga 26
to 6 and looked good while doing It.
Their line outcharged the Bulldogs,
their forward passes fooled Clipper
Smith's men, and their backs carried
the ball for consistent gains. When
these Aggies play California at Berke
ley next Saturday they are very likely
to hand the Bears their first Confer
ence setback.
Howard Jones' Trojans won from
Washington State, but there, too,
something went wrong. The score was
a mere 16 to 7, and for some reason
the Thundering Herd failed to boom.
Either Babe Hollingbery has worked
wonders with the Cougars or the
U.S.C. warriors are not quite what
their early-season victories pointed
them out to be. Perhaps they just had
an "off day" such as they experienced
when the Cougars invaded their camp
last season.
Charley Erb's Idaho squad showed
a good variety of plays to win from
Montana 27 to 12. True, Montana is
none too strong, but Idaho was not
rated much better, if as good. Idaho
plays Washington next Saturday and
after that game it will be easier to
tell just what to expect from Erb's
charges.
California, as was expected, met de
feat at the hands of St. Mary's in a
non-conference game, but a very im
portant one. For several seasons the
Fighting Irish have been trying to win
from the Bears, and at last their am
bition has been realized. The Bears
did not show much except Paul Cly
mer, a real punter.
Card Victory Hollow
Stanford's showing did not thrill the
fans who saw the game the Cards put
up against the Olympic Club, and al
though the Redshirts won, their vic
tory was hollow. The Cards just could
not get their attack started, and pen
alties kept them fighting for 25 yards
instead of 10 to make first down as a
result of setbacks for holding. The
Redshirts suffered the loss of about
150 yards as a result of penalties.
If comparative scores mean any
thing, which they fortunately do not,
Washington and the Oregon Aggies
have the edge over their rivals, but
scores signify nothing as to a team's
power, so it seems, so the Conference
title still belongs to any one of the
six unbeaten teams.
Oregon and Washington State joined
Montana in the list of Pacific Coast
Conference teams to fall by the way
