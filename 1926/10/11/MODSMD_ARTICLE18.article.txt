Tso Yan Wang, who has been in the
United States for about three and a
half years studying American educa
tional methods, will lecture on"The
Chinese Youth Movement" in the Lit
tle Theatre at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
night.
The speaker is a graduate of the
Peking National Teachers College,
which is financed by the Chinese Gov
ernment. During Dr. John Dewey's
lecture tour in the province of Shan
tung, Wang served as the lecturer's
end of the tally, partly because they
ed with him as assistant in courses
given by Dewey at the Peking Nation
al Teachers College.
While serving as Chinese secretary
to Dr. Paul Monroe, Director of the
International Institute in Columbia
University, Wang visited all the Chi
nese schools in seven coast provinces
and three interior provinces in China.
From his own observations and per
sonal research Wang wrote his book,
"A General Survey of Chinese Educa
tion." He is also the author of "The
Educational and Social Significance
of the Chinese New Year Fair in
Peking."
Wang is intimately acquainted with
the new educational tendencies in
China, manifested in the Mass-Educa
tion Movement and its various
branches. He sees in such movements
as this China's chief hope for readjust
ment, and the re-establishing of her
national dignity and security.
Following his lecture-tour of the
summer and fall, Wang will leave for
Europe, where he will continue his
research in the field of education,
eventually returning to China. He has
lectured this summer at State Teach
ers' Colleges in New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Minnesota, Colo
rado, and Kansas.
