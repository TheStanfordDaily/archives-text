# RAGGED PLAY NEARLY COSTS CARD VICTORY
## Olympians Fight Stanford Eleven to Standstill Part of Game BOGUE SHIFTED TO HALF Defensive Work, Passing, Punting Improved By Hoffman 
### 
Penalties and listless, ragged play
ing nearly cost Stanford a humiliating
defeat at the hands of the supposedly
weak Olympic Club team Saturday and
even the 7 to 3 victory of the Cards
does very little to eradicate the bad
taste the day's exhibition left with
the 6000 spectators who saw the Red
shirts beaten by a three-point margin
until they finally got organized enough
to send Sims over for a touchdown
three minutes before the game was
over.
Cards Face Defeat
After having nearly every sally on
the Olympic goal balked by a'penalty
the Cards were face to face with de
feat as the game drew to a close. After
Hoffman's 60-yard pass went over the
goal line the clubmen took the ball
and were forced to kick to Murphy
who was downed on the 45-yard line.
Following a four-yard gain by Sims
and Murphy the Club was penalized
15 yards for coaching on the side line,
putting the. ball on the 26-yard line.
Hoffman's pass was incomplete and
on the next play Murphy broke away
around right end for 22 yards which
put the Cards on the four-yard line.
Amid much beseeching on the part
of the stands Sims fought his way
