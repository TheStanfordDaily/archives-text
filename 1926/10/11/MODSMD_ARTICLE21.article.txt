# RAGGED PLAY NEARLY COSTS CARD VICTORY
## Olympians Fight Stanford Eleven to Standstill Part of Game BOGUE SHIFTED TO HALF Defensive Work, Passing, Punting Improved By Hoffman 
### 
Penalties and listless, ragged play
ing nearly cost Stanford a humiliating
defeat at the hands of the supposedly
weak Olympic Club team Saturday and
even the 7 to 3 victory of the Cards
does very little to eradicate the bad
taste the day's exhibition left with
the 6000 spectators who saw the Red
shirts beaten by a three-point margin
until they finally got organized enough
to send Sims over for a touchdown
three minutes before the game was
over.
Cards Face Defeat
After having nearly every sally on
the Olympic goal balked by a'penalty
the Cards were face to face with de
feat as the game drew to a close. After
Hoffman's 60-yard pass went over the
goal line the clubmen took the ball
and were forced to kick to Murphy
who was downed on the 45-yard line.
Following a four-yard gain by Sims
and Murphy the Club was penalized
15 yards for coaching on the side line,
putting the. ball on the 26-yard line.
Hoffman's pass was incomplete and
on the next play Murphy broke away
around right end for 22 yards which
put the Cards on the four-yard line.
Amid much beseeching on the part
of the stands Sims fought his way
' over the line. After Murphy kicked
1 goal, the Olympians opened an aerial
attack, but the game ended.
The Stanford eleven was lucky to
come out with a win, for the Winged
"O" had fought them to a standstill
L until the last quarter. The Olympians
, took their three-point lead late in the
second quarter after four men had
blocked Hoffman's punt and Kuhn re
. covered the ball on the 12-yard line.
Clarke and Fratt in three attempts
advanced only 5 yards and "Scotchy"
Campbell was called in for a place
kick. His boot from the 13-yard line
went true and from then until the
last few minutes tha Olympic Club
held the small but dangerous three
point margin.
Line Holds Well
The Stanford line held well during
the contest but it was the kind of
holding that brought 15-yard penalties.
Seven of them were tallied up for a
total of 105 yards. In the last half
runs by Hyland and Bogue started the
Redshirts on several advances down
the field, only to be set back by a
penalty.
Shipkey snagged some beautiful
passes in the last half that ordinarily
would have carried the-ball far enough
for the Cards to get within striking
distance, but each time they were
penalized. Hoffman shot him a pass
in lite third period which netted 30
yards and Hyland tossed another to
him for 13. A 5-yard penalty followed
a 1-vard loss by Hoffman. Hyland set
things going again by a run
around end and then Stanford was
penalized. The Cards lost the ball
when Dorsey intercepted Hoffman's
pass.
Kirwan Interferes
The Redshirts lost another chance
to score in the fourth quarter after
they had advanced 35 yards when
Kirwan interfered with Shipkey on a
lond pass from Hoffman. Gains by
Hoffman and Sims and a 5-yard pen
alty took the ball to the 18-yard line.
Three plays netted 7 yards and then
Murphy and Millage were seut in and
the former attempted a place kick
which failed. Bogue missed another
place kick from the 35-yard line in the
first quarter, and Campbell failed on
another for the Olympians in the
third.
Hyland missed a long pass from
Hoffman by six inches in the third
frame, that would have resulted in a
certain score.
Bogue Shifted
Bogue was nil as a fullback but
when shifted to half he looked more
at home. The assorted backfield, with
Bogue at full, Graves and Sims at
halves, and Millage at quarter wasn't
very effective and in the second quar
ter Hoffman took the place of Bogue,
who relieved Sims at half. Murphy
i replaced Graves.
The Cardinal forward wall didn't
look much like a veteran line. Two
times the clubmen broke through to
block Hoffman's punts and one paved
| the way for the Olympians' score.
Hoffman Goes Well
Hoffman furnished the only conso
lation for the afternoon's exhibition.
His punting was greatly improved
j over the preceding week, he shot some
nice passes, backed the line in great
style, and was responsible for several
good gains.
Undoubtedly the Olympians were
underrated and the Cards thought
they could loaf through the game
until the fourth quarter when they
really got down to business. Patrick's
men put up a fighting game and with
Stanford losing all the opportunities
to score as they did the Winged "O"

deserved victory.
Warner wasn't present to experience
the scare, being down at the U.S.C.-
Washington State game| Thornhill
was also away at the Oregon-Wash
ington game, leaving Winterburn in
charge of the squad.
