# SOCCER SQUAD TIES MARIN COUNTY TEAM IN INITIAL CONTEST
## 
### 
In a drizzling rain, and a strong
wind, the Stanford soccer team played
a 0-0 tie in their first game of tho
season against the Marin County
eleven at Golden Gate Park Saturday.
The two aggregations were evenly
matched, with Stanford on the offen
sive most of the time, but the Cards
lacked the necessary punch and drive
to score when the chance was offered.
Because the season has been open only
three days, the squad showed lack of
practice in such fundamentals as drib
bling and passing, so necessary for a
successful team.
Last year the Marin County eleven
in a hard-fought contest beat Stanford
1-0. Marin County always plays an
aggressive game.
As a whole the Stanford squad
played very well Saturday, according
; to Coach Maloney and Captain Bob
Bailard who were entirely satisfied
with the team showing. Against the
Teutonic Club next week they expect
to show in old form.
The Stanford lineup was: 0.L.,
Coleman; 1.L., Strowger; C., Gibbs;
1.R., Bailard; 0.R., Farewell; R.H.,
Newland; C.H., Sprolley, L.11., Can
non; R.F., Holmes; L.F., Evans; G.,
