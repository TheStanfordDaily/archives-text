# Encina vs. Jail
## 
### 
The freshmen's latest pleasure consist of bombarding the Palo Alto
street cars as they pass Encina Hall. One day last week-end, a peach pit
was thrown with such good aim that it broke a window in the car and
scattered glass on one of the passengers. Wanton destruction of property
is bad enough pastime for first-year men, but when they start endanger
ing the very lives of men and women, the deed ceases to be anything less
than a crime.
Most of the freshmen's pranks have been passed over with the com
ment that boys will be boys, but some things can not be tolerated even
at college "where we pay less for our crimes," than we will when we
get out in the world. The young man that threw the missile would not
have thought of throwing a pit at a passing trolley car from a hotel
window in a city. Then why should he lose his idea of right and wrong
when he is living in Encina Hall. Such acts as these may explain why
the name "collegiate" is so grating on the ears of an outsider.
It may be of interest to the freshmen to know that if the act is
repeated, the Palo Alto officials will take the matter in their own hands,
and the jail in the above-mentioned city is far less homelike than
Encina Hall. W.F.A.
