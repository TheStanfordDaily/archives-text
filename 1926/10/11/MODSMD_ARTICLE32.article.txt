# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
In Friday's issue of the Daily we
saw,that the Scalpers Society of the
sophomore class had issued an "edict"
requiring the freshmen to wear
"dinks" and to carry matches (for
whom was not stipulated). We also saw
that a "vigilance committee" was
planned to enforce the order.
It recalls to mind President Wil
bur's comment on sophomores, doesn't
it?
Evidently some have forgotten a few
things: Stanford has a sponsor system
for guiding the freshmen. That system
is still here, and the sophomore vic
tory Wednesday has not changed it
one whit. Stanford has done away
with Sophomore Miscontrol, and all
the mud fights in the world could not
bring it back —in whole or in part.
It is, therefore, up to the freshmen —
not the sophomores—whether or not
the class of '30' shall wear "dinks," or
carry matches for anything other than

I their own use.
If the Scalper "edict" is the con
census of sophomore opinion, the
Class of '29 has changed its spots.
Last year we took our perogative, as
citizens of a community, to decide our
own affairs, and we did away with
such obnoxious "traditions" as carry
ing matches and smoking corn-cobs.
Even the "dink" had disappeared by
Christmas. Why, then, should we now
attempt to knock down what we spent
a year in building? And, as to the
freshmen, are they going to let us put
over on them what we would not let
others put over on us? If they do, they
have less spunk than one would think.
By the formation of the "vigilance
committee," it seems that the Scalpers
would set up a Men's Council of their
own —perhaps to practice the famous
"sophomore judgment." But what
could one expect?— Even sophomores
are only freshmen one year removed.
—James T. Watkins, '29.
