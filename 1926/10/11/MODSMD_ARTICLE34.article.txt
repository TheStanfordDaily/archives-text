UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CAL
IFORNIA, Oct. 10. —Fraternity and so
rority rushing procedure on the local
campus is being attacked on all fronts,
even by the main parties interested.
Following some pointed criticisms by
George Jordan, editor of the Trojan,
the Pan-Hellenic council met and it
was disclosed that a majority of the
sororities were not following the rush
ing rules to the letter. The Inter-Fra
ternity council was to meet to devise
a set of rushing rules.
Of the two systems now in vogue,
that of the men seems to function
better. Although following no specific
rules, there is a spirit of co-operation
that is noticeable, and about the only
law that has been deemed necessary
was that regarding the breaking of a
pledgeship so that no man doing this
| would be eligible for another frater
| nity for a full semester following the
one in which he was pledged.
