# Trojan Faculty Declare Honor System Is Failure

### 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CAL
IFORNIA, Oct. 10. â€”The Honor Sys
tem has been declared a failure by
several of the prominent faculty mem
bers and at present student and fac
ulty committees are hard at work on
the problem. The main flaw observed
has been the difficulty in getting stu
dents to report violations of the code.
The faculty, on the other hand, does
not greatly relish the idea of going
back to police work.
