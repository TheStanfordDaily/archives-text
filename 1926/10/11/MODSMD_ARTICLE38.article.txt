## All Veterans Except Smith, O'Connor Return to University 
### Henry Clock 
Swimming and water polo practice
will get under way today at the Encina
pool under the direction of Coach
Ernest Brandsten. With the greatest
number of lettermen in years return
ing, the prospects for this season are
extremely bright, according to Brand
sten.
Wa'ly O'Connor and Colin Smith
are the only members of last year's
team who are not registered, but both
will probably be back next quarter. In
the sprints there will be Bob Williams,
Bob Harris, Karl Doerr, Dutch Fletch
er, Allen Christenson, Phil Brooks,
Carlsmith, and Webster. All eight will
be trying for both the 50- and 100-yard
events.
Stevenson Returns
Stanford will be almost unbeatable,
Brandsten predicts, in the 220- and
440-yard events, for Carl Stevenson,
winner of both the Golden and Silver
Gate races this summer, will be back.
Van den Akker, Ward, and Burns will
also be in these races, and O'Connor
will swim in them if he returns.
More good material will be out for
the breast stroke this year than in
some time. Cecil West, Warren Little
field, Ted Smith, George Kimball, Andy
Cole, Clarence Ophuls, and Wagner
will all be trying to make this event.
Veteran Backstrokes
The backstroke will be represented
by Ted Smith, Phil Brooks, Carl Ste
venson, Dutch Fletchcr, Clif Moore,
and Arden Allen. All are men of con
siderable experience.
Dave Fall, champion diver, will
again be eligible and will represent
Stanford in that event. Walter Mills,
John Kenney, Ted Smith, Fonda, and
Klotz are others who will be out for
diving.
The medley is one of the hardest
events, but six good men are out for
it this year. Ted Smith, Allen Chris
tenson, Bob Williams, Cecil West,
Dutch Fletcher, and Phil Brooks are
the ones who will enter the event
which calls for breast stroke, back
stroke, and crawl.
Plunge Discontinued
An important change in the events
with California has been made this
year. Instead of the old plunge for
distance, which will be discontinued,
the 220- and 440-yard swims and the
relay have been added. The relay
team will be chosen from men in dif
ferent events.
In the water polo line, Brandsten
also has a wealth of material. Seven
good men will fight it out for the three
forward positions. They are Williams,
Van den Akker, Stewart, Harris,
Burns, Strong, and Brooks. For backs,
there will be Thurlow, Ken Graham,
Christenson, Maltby, Allen, McGetti
gan, Ward, Ted Smith, Kline, and An
drews. The goal guards will be chosen
from Poulsen, Bill Hinkle, and Bock.
Besides the men mentioned there
will be many new ones out for the

ferent events.
In the water polo line, Brandsten
also has a wealth of material. Seven
good men will fight it out for the three
forward positions. They are Williams,
Van den Akker, Stewart, Harris,
Burns, Strong, and Brooks. For backs,
there will be Thurlow, Ken Graham,
Christenson, Maltby, Allen, McGetti
gan, Ward, Ted Smith, Kline, and An
drews. The goal guards will be chosen
from Poulsen, Bill Hinkle, and Bock.
Besides the men mentioned there
will be many new ones out for the
squad. Practice will start now and
continue until the California meet.
Swimming and water polo practice
will get under way today at the Encina
pool under the direction of Coach
Ernest Brandsten. With the greatest
number of lettermen in years return
ing, the prospects for this season are
extremely bright, according to Brand
sten.
Wa'ly O'Connor and Colin Smith
are the only members of last year's
team who are not registered, but both
will probably be back next quarter. In
the sprints there will be Bob Williams,
Bob Harris, Karl Doerr, Dutch Fletch
er, Allen Christenson, Phil Brooks,
Carlsmith, and Webster. All eight will
be trying for both the 50- and 100-yard
events.
Stevenson Returns
Stanford will be almost unbeatable,
Brandsten predicts, in the 220- and
440-yard events, for Carl Stevenson,
winner of both the Golden and Silver
Gate races this summer, will be back.
Van den Akker, Ward, and Burns will
also be in these races, and O'Connor
will swim in them if he returns.
More good material will be out for
the breast stroke this year than in
some time. Cecil West, Warren Little
field, Ted Smith, George Kimball, Andy
Cole, Clarence Ophuls, and Wagner
will all be trying to make this event.
Veteran Backstrokes
The backstroke will be represented
by Ted Smith, Phil Brooks, Carl Ste
venson, Dutch Fletchcr, Clif Moore,
and Arden Allen. All are men of con
siderable experience.
Dave Fall, champion diver, will
again be eligible and will represent
Stanford in that event. Walter Mills,
John Kenney, Ted Smith, Fonda, and
Klotz are others who will be out for
diving.
The medley is one of the hardest
events, but six good men are out for
it this year. Ted Smith, Allen Chris
tenson, Bob Williams, Cecil West,
Dutch Fletcher, and Phil Brooks are
the ones who will enter the event
which calls for breast stroke, back
stroke, and crawl.
Plunge Discontinued
An important change in the events
with California has been made this
year. Instead of the old plunge for
distance, which will be discontinued,
the 220- and 440-yard swims and the
relay have been added. The relay
team will be chosen from men in dif
ferent events.
