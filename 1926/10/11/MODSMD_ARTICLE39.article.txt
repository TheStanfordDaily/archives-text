# RYAN LABORATORY TO HOUSE RADIO STATION
## 
### 
Dismantling of the Stanford broad
casting station, 6XBM, which for the
past two years has been the testing
center for the wave lengths of the
broadcasting stations in the western
part of the United States, is actively
under way. The plant, which has been
located adjacent to the old High Volt
age Laboratory, will be moved to the
Ryan Laboratory.
The testing work was carried on
with the co-operation of the Bureau of
Standards, and was intended to keep
broadcasting stations operating within
their assigned wave lengths. Check-up
on the radio sending sets was neces
sary to prevent overlapping and con
sequent poor reception. Improved
transmitting equipment has now elimi
nated the necessity of this service.
In the early days of radio broadcast
ing, this station, then known as
KFGH, held some experiments in prac
tical transmission.
Programs were sent out at varying
Intervals and consisted of phono
graphic music, readings, and an
nouncements of the outcome of foot
ball games. Lack of funds prevented
a more pretentious undertaking along
these lines
