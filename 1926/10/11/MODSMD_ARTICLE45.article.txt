# "AREN'T WE ALL" ACTORS UNDERSTAND REAL SATIRE
## 
### Frank Baker 
Witty, humorous, and thoroughly
amusing can be said of Gordon Davis'
production of "Aren't We All?" in the
Assembly Hall last Friday night. The
play was an English comedy by Fred
erick Lonsdale, whose satire and light
cynicism was well understood by the
actors —except some of the minor ones
—in their presentation of the various
parts.
Three people, Gordon Davis, Eliza
beth Wilbur, and Jack McGuire, must
be credited with the stellar perform
ances. Davis dominated the entire
show with a ready wit and brilliant
English repartee as Lord Grenham,
an elderly British peer with a refined
rabelaisian attitude toward life and
women. His presence saved several
situations which might otherwise have
been tedious.
Miss Wilbur Excels
Miss Wilbur was the best middle
aged divorcee the writer has seen on
the campus. Her work would have
done credit to many a professional
presentation. The kittenish vivacity
and womanly intelligence with which
she ogled the honorable Grenham was
much above the par of amateur acting.
McGuire, in the part of the suave,
polished gentleman, was intelligent
enough not to over-act his part, and
had the audience with him whole
heartedly during his short time on the
stage in the third act. His voice was
one of McGuire's best points, being a
decided relief after the many flat and
uninteresting voices one hears in most
shows.
Acting Weak
Sarah Margaret Burns and Wayne
Newcomb, while having splendid stage
presences, were neither of them quite
as convincing in either their anger or
their love as might be expected. Miss
Burns' best scene was her initial ap
pearance when she discovered her
Willie kissing the clever Kitty Lake. |
During the rest she made no distinct
impression. Tatham, the writer ex
pected, would come into his own when
he discovered his wife's shortcomings, !
but Newcomb failed to come through
with enough to allow anyone to say
that his portrayal was strong. When
the show was over one felt that it
wouldn't have made much difference if
he had lost his Margot.
Eleanor Davidson was very much
the prim wife of a village vicar, who
had been passed by when the thrill
sower had scattered his seeds. The
writer had a hard time disassociating
Reidar Torjussen as the Vicar Lyton,
from the butler parts he had taken.
Torjussen has his own way of doing
a part and that way is hard to change; i
and, worse luck, he gave a satisfying
representation of the burlesqued Eng
lish preacher.
Jean Wakefield was slightly miscast.
She would be splendid in the role of

i the quiet young married woman, or
the shy debutante, but it was difficult
to realize that she was a "woman of
the world" with a past. She was very
pleasing, however, and had the sym
pathy of her listeners when her en
croachments on Mrs. Tatham's hus
band were discovered.
The minor characters in the play
must be classed as commonplace with
very little to recommend them.
Davis Direcia Well
Considering the inexperience of the
j minor characters, and a few faults al
ready mentioned, the directing of Gor
don Davis is the more to be praised,
for it is obvious that he had many
difficulties to overcome. The comedy
can be pronounced another distinct
success for Stanford's dramatic coach.
The writer only wishes that the play
j could have stopped at the humorous
] situation when Lord Grenham and
Lady Frinton were bantering on the
settee, Grenham telling the Lady his
big reason for liking her was that she
made him laugh. This was easily the
cleverest scene in the show, both in !
point of view of lines, and of the act
ing of the principals.
