# WOMEN TO MAKE LAST CLUBHOUSE PAYMENT
## 
### 
Final payment on the Women's
Clubhouse will be made this quarter
through the efforts of the Clubhouse
board and the Resident Alumnae As-,
sociation.
The original cost of the building
was $45,000' but interest, ground-rent,
and taxes have increased that sum to
a large extent. Twelve years ago the
Resident Alumnae Association began
to hold their weekly Wednesday teas, !
the proceeds of which have gone to
ward improving and paying for the
building.
Considerable revenue during the last
few years has been derived from the
receipts placed in the Women's Club
house building fund box in the Book
i store.
