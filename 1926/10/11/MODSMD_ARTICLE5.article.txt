# FRESHMEN WIN TWO HARD-EARNED GAMES FUNCTION POORLY
## First Team Headwork Bad; Reserves Show Need of New Quarterback 
### 
Two more games have been won by
the Stanford freshman football teams,
the first squad defeating San Mateo
Junior College 13 to 7, and the re
serves scoring a win over Modesto
High School 14 to 0. Both outfits were
hard pressed to come out on the long
end of the tally, partly because they
were not functioning properly and
partly because their opponents played
some nice football.
Frentrup made a touchdown for the
first freshmen in the opening quarter.
This gave the babes a lead that San
Mateo overcame early in the second
quarter, when Schlichtling crossed the
goal line to tie the count. May won
the game by dashing forty-five yards
through the center of the San Mateo
line for the winning touchdown. The
yearlings did not work as well as they
did against California Poly last week.
Frentrup was again the star, while
May and Simpkins also looked good in
the backfield. Albertson, Templeman,
and Forster did some nice work in
the line.
The frosh reserves were inside of
Modesto's ten-yard line five times and
failed to score. Only once did they
buck the ball up the field and shove
it over. The other touchdown was
made when "Nellie" Smith ran a punt
back seventy yards through the entire
Modesto team. He was aided by some
good interference and some poor tack
ling on the part of the Modesto outfit.
The game showed that the freshmen
need a good quarter, because part of
their lack of punch was due to poor
headwork when the ball was in scor
ing distance.
