# WOMEN ELECT HELEN HUNEKE TO COUNCIL
## Vacancy Made by Failure of Anne Bancroft to Return For Fall Quarter WINS BY WIDE MARGIN Candidate Was Actively Engaged in Sports and Women's Activities 
### 
Helen Huneke was named junior mem
ber of Women's Council at a special elec
tion held in the women's living groups
last evening. The vacancy was caused
when Anne Bancroft, who was elected to
the office last spring, failed to return to
the campus this year.
Miss Huneke won by a large majority
over Winifred Huntington and Aileen
Brown, the other two candidates. The
women nominated for the< office last
spring by the living groups were declared
eligible for the position, but through the
declinations of several of the nominees
the race was between the above three.
Miss Huneke, who is a sponsor at
Roble, has given much time to Y.W.C.A.
work. She has also been prominent in
â– women's athletics, and has held office in
Roble Club.
Other members of Women's Council
are Lharlotte Lovekin, president; Bar
bara Perkins, vice-president; Kathreen
Clock, senior representative; and Eleanor
Davidson, secretary.
In the election next spring, either Miss
Davidson or Miss Huneke, the two jun
ior representatives on the council, must
be re-elected to the council to serve for
another year.
