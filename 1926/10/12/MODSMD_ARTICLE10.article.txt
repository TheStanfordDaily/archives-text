# TRYOUTS FOR SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY SET FOR TONIGHT
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Sword and
Sandals play, to be presented No
vember 5, will be held in the
Assembly llall from 3 to 5 o'clock
this afternoon, and from 7 to 9
o'clock this evening. This play,
which is under the direction of
Gordon Davis, should be of spe
cial interest as it is the only
production to be given this quar
ter in which the entire student
body will be eligible for partici
pation.
It has been announced by
Sword and Sandals that a num
ber of new members will be cho
sen from the cast. According to
Gordon Davis, possibilities for
ihe introduction of new talent
into dramatic circles have never
been so opportune as at the pres
ent time.
Although the name of the play
has not yet been disclosed, it is
known that it will be of a more
erious tone than the various light
comedy productions included in
the fall dramatic program. It was
recently presented in New York,
and was accorded an enthusiastic
reception during its run there.
