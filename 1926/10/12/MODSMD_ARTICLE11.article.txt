## 
### 
Comparatively modern organ compo
sitions will form the bulk of the pro
gram to be given by Warren D. Allen,
University organist, at 4:15 this after
noon.
Mr. Allen will begin the concert with
"Heroic Piece," a composition of Ros
setter G. Cole, a famous living American
musician. The second number will be
Ralph Vaughan Williams' Prelude on a
Welsh hymn-tune ("Lovely"). Williams
is one of the greatest liv-ing Fnglish or
ganists, and has gained fame by setting
to music several of Walt Whitman's
poems.
"In Autumn," one of Fdward Mac-
Dowell's works, written in the usual style
of that composer, and the idyl "From the
South," by James R. Gillette, are the
next two numbers on the program.
The last number to be played is the
Finale from the Grand Piece Sympho
nicjtie of Cesar Franck. The composition
is .typical of the extraordinarily lofty,
noble, and rich style of its author, who
is regarded as the founder of the modern
French school of music.
