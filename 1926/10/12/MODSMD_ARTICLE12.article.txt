# SENIORS ORGANIZING STRONG GRID TEAM FOR COMING TILTS
## 
### 
Seniors who have had a little fobtball
experience are urged to sign up for the
coming interclass gridiron clash. Ac
cording to Manager Don Fritts there is
plenty of room for more candidates in
order that scrimmage can be held. The
team has been practicing regularly every
afternoon.
There are several shining lights on the
team who are expected to show to great
advantage. Wilbur Adams, a fast and
hard-hitting halfback, is the big threat in
the senior backfield. Gregory, a transfer
from Occidental, looks good at quarter
back. Stockbridge and Brownie are like
wise expected to prove impregnable in
the wing positions.
Under the able coaching of "Nip" Mc-
Hose and Merrill Armour, the upper
classmen expect to weld together an ag
gregation which will make the going
tough for their rivals.
