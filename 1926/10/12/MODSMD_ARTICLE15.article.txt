# BIFF HOFFMAN, FRED SWAN ON INJURED LIST
## Warner Moves Up Several Second-String Players To Varsity Lineup HARD WORKOUTS AHEAD Don Hill and Chris Freeman Still on Sidelines With Injuries 
### 
Biff Hoffman and Fred Swan were not
in uniform yesterday afternoon when the
varsity reported for practice. Swan is in
the hospital for a few days with an in
fected ankle, while Hoffman is laid up
with bruises received in last Saturday's
game.
Hoffman was standing on the side lines
watching practice last night with Don
Hill, who is still out with an infected
arm, and Chris Freeman, who nurses a
cut over his eye besides a dislocated elbow
and a broken blood vessel. All of which
is a small but very serious hospital list,
as it keeps these men out of practice at
a time when the team must move forward
fast if they are to be prepared for the
Trojans in three weeks.
Carrying out his threat made in the
student body assembly yesterday morn
ing, Warner made several changes in the
first strin,g lineup in scrimmage last
night. Of what significance the changes
might be is not known, but a large num
ber of heretofore second string players
were given opportunity to show what
claims they might have to permanent
berths.
The line from left end to right was
composed of Price, Artrnan, Kazanjian,
Vermilya, Symonds, Sellman, and David
son, respectively. Sims and Murphy were
halves, Post, quarter, and Patchett, full.
From all appearances the Cardinal
squad is in for one good hard week of
drill with the race for all positions an
open affair.
