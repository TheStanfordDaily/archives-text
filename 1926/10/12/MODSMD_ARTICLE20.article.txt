# UNIVERSITY TO PLANT NEW BORDER OF OAKS ALONG PALM DRIVE
## Palms Unsuited to Climate In This Part of State Face Destruction 
### 
Palm Drive will ultimately become
xn unfitting name for the main thor
ughfare leading from Palo Alto to the
University Quadrangle, for eventually
this road will be lined with massive
)aks, supplanting the now old un
sightly palms. These California live
>aks, 125 in number, will be planted
next spring in a row secondary to the
palms, where they will be allowed to
;row for a number of years until they
lecome large enough to form the main
border of the avenue, which will prob
ibly require twenty-five years.
The palms, being unsuitable to this
•limate, are slowly dying, and it is
nly a matter of time when all of them
will have to be removed. It was this
"act which led University authorities
to make plans for the planting of the
oaks, and the eventual removal of the
palms.
The oaks will not be planted in the
■ trip of ground between the paths and
he boulevard, but will be planted
along the sides of the paths farthest
from the road, thus widening the ave
nue and giving a better vista of the
Quad and hills. The inner strip, in
stead of having trees, will be covered
by two varieties of shrubs. Already
COOO plants of one of the varieties have
been raised to be planted in this area.
Both oaks and shrubs are the prod
uct of seedlings grown at the Univer
sity nursery. The oaks have been lifted
from the ground in which they have
been growing and have been boxed,
o await spring, when they will be
danted.
Plans have been made for extensive
improvements and arrangements of
dant life on the campus of which
f .he improvement of Palm Drive is but
one part. Gardener Daley with the co
operation of Professor Leßoy Abrams,
•irofessor of Botany, and John Mc-
Laren of Golden Gate Park made the
dans.
