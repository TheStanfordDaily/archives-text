### 
The Stanford Lit is opening a cir
culation campaign this week with a
house-to-house canvas of all campus
halls, living groups, and houses. One
fhird of the quota necessary to insure
the financial future of the magazine
has been reached at present, accord
ing to Gertrude Baker, manager of
the Lit.
Editorial as well as managerial try
outees will canvas for subscriptions.
Several positions on both managerial
and editorial staffs are open yet.
Each tryoutee who sells subscrip
tions to the magazine will be given
an assigned territory to cover. The
first cut in the managerial tryout list
will occur in two weeks.
