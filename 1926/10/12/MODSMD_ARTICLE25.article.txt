# Australia Tomorrow
## 
### 
While the Sydney University debating trio clashes with the University
of California team at Berkeley tonight, the Stanford varsity forensic
team will today complete its case and polish off its argument in prepara
tion for tomorrow night's encounter with the Australians in the As
sembly Ilall.
Philosophy, prediction, and even flights of the imagination will be
brought into play in the discussion of the resolution "That we have more
to fear than to hope for from Science." The Sydney representatives are
men of maturity and some experience in public affairs. One of the visi
tors is himself a Master of Surgery and a member of the staff of St.
Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, and his interpretation of what is to be
feared from science wili be looked for with especial interest.
The debaters are planning to use the Oxford style of address rather
than the formal argument and rebuttal which has been so prevalent. This
should have the effect of lifting the subject from the depths of dullness
and dryness to a plane where it can be readily appreciated. Informality
in the manner of address and a little humor added should attract to the
interest of the evening.
An interesting sidelight on the debate is the fact that the discussion
of this subject of fear and hope from science has been largely inspired
by two books recently appearing in England. One, "Dedalus," from the
pen of J. B. S. Haldane, sets forth the author's hopes from science. The.
other, "iccrus," by Bertrand Russell, presents the dangers forthcoming
from this great power in life.
