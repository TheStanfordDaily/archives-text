# The 						Far East
## 
### 
Progress is ever pushing modern civilization westward. Authorities
are practically unanimous in declaring'that the Pacific will be the future
center of the bulk of the world's trade and commerce. The Pacific Coast
on the one side and China and Japan on the other are likely to occupy
the place now held by the countries bordering on the Atlantic.
It is thus increasingly important that the westerner should know
more of the Far Eastern countries in order to cope with situations which
are arising more and more often. Interpretation of the thought and
feeling of China and Japan is necessary. Intellectual and social move
ments of these two nations arc attracting increased attention.
An opportunity is given tonight to hear Tso Van Wang, director of
the commission of education from Manchuria, interpret the vital move
ments for national betterment in China. In his talk on "J he Chinese
Youth Movement" he will tell of the meaning and hopes of China's
struggle for improvement in educational and social conditions.
