# THE 						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
In a news item dated October 10, it is
announced that several prominent faculty
members at U.S.C. have reported that the
Honor System there is a failure.
* * *
We mention this, not by way of cast
ing the harpoon in a rival already sunk
(look over that metaphor) but simply in
order to prove a contention we have
already made to the effect that Honor
Systems mean nothing, but that honor
is a matter of character. And that, fur
thermore, character has a direct relation
to intelligence.
For the obvious reason that the en
trance requirements are not as strict, the
average of intelligence at U.S.C. is prob
ably not as high as it is at Stanford.
Furthermore, lacking the age, standing,
and limited enrollment of Stanford,
U.S.C. is not in a position to choose its

students with the same meticulous care
that marks the choice of Stanford fresh
men. Added to this, the University of
Southern California does not occupy the
isolated position enjoyed by the Stan
ford campus, and hence the student body
is constantly in contact with influences
beyond the supervision of the university
authorities.
The "system" there is very much like
the one here. The students are inclined
to be different. Once before, when this
column first saw the light of day, we sug
gested that the merits of the Stanford
Honor "System" be tested on a miscel
laneous group of federal prohibition ag
ents, or United States Senators.
We did not dare hope that the experi
ment would prove such a howling success
when tried on material which (or whose)
honor was not altogether a matter of
doubt, as in our hypothetical case.
