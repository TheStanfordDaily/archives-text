The Editor, Sir:
Well, well, well! so the Scalpers are on
the warpath! And freshmen must wear
dinks and carry matches! Interesting, if
true, but also rather irritating when one
considers that through the columns of the
valued Bull Session we were just now
complimented and assured of our superi
ority to U.S.C. in regard to just such
childish goings-on. The difference prob
ably lies in the fact that at the southern
institution the Trojan Knights are ex
pected to do just that sort of thing, while
at Stanford we had, presumably, dis
carded such trash.
I would like to ask the Scalpers, col
lectively, just how many times did all
of them, taken together, wear dinks dur
ing their freshman year ? It's a safe bet
that the figure would take no more than
two digits, and those small. Did they
ever carry matches, except for the pur
pose of using for themselves ? They
know quite well they neither wore^dinks
after they had been "wised up" nor car
ried "fire sticks" for upperclassmen's
benefit. Neither did the rest of the class
of '29, of which they are supposed to be
the selected and honored representatives.
And yet Scalpers has the courage to
make itself comical by announcing blat
antly that measures will be taken against
all freshmen who do not act as though
this were the Stanford of six years ago,
instead of the Stanford of today. I sup
pose perfectly useless Honor Societies

j will be with us for some time for the
I purpose of affording satisfaction to their
1 members and others of the same general
type whom their members will select to
[ succeed them and carry on the comedy.
They have a picture "in the Quad, and it
means an extra name in the senior record
for each. Which is quite all right if they
care for that sort of thing. No harm is
' done anyone, except the few who felt
disappointed at not being made members
i of the elect—and they find their loss was
| far more apparent than real, when they
j realize who some of the chosen are. Ex
! cept by themselves, Honor Societies are
j not taken seriously here. But to attempt
j to assume the prerogative of actively en
j forcing traditions is a ridiculous gesture,
I even for Scalpers, the sophomore Honor
I Society.
No need to worry; no more dinks will
be seen now than before the grandiloquent
manifesto was launched upon the campus
—the freshmen are not gullible or naive
enough for that. But do Scalpers actually
take themselves seriously, or was the
whole thing a bit of humorous publicity
for the otherwise inactive and unnoticed
group of '29 supermen ? Iwould prefer
to believe the latter. At other universities
let them take such grammar school high
jinks to heart. At Stanford let them con
tinue to be regarded with the tongue in
the cheek. Naturally sophomores will be
Sophomoric.
