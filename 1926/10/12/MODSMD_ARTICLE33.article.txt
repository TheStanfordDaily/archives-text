The Shanghai Gesture: A play, by John
Colton. Bony and Liveright, Nezv
York, 1926.
For those who are always about to take
up reading plays and never begin, "The
Shanghai Gesture" presents itself as an
excellent starting point.
The plot is truly fascinating, and fol
lowing the best accepted New York style
is laid in a Chinese dive of rather the
better class, the house of the Gallery of
the Laughing Dolls.
The central figure is the inscrutable
Mother God Damn (who for the naughty
name itself had to thank the rough humor
of the foreign sailors—witty fellows who
for many years taught ignorant China
girls that "God damn" meant "I love
you"), the Manchu princess, the cast-off
love of the English nobleman, Sir Guy
Charteris, the ruler and despot of the
half-world of Shanghai.
The play is in part a story of her life
—a drama of a struggle that carried her
as a slave girl through the misery and
hell of the China coast, through political
intrigue, to become finally the mysterious
power behind the shifting scenes of
Shanghai and China—the one "who has
the underneath" on all China matters.
Who never in her life has parted with a
secret for the joy of telling. That is why
she is necessary to the government. That
is why the police use her—protect her—
and dread her!"
"Chinese New Year very sacred time.
Time to make good feeling with the gods.
All China people pay of New Year's—no
pay—all year bad luck." Pay, pay, is the
cry which echoes throughout the entire
book. All arc forced to pay—and to lose,
in the ruthless storm of events that first
heed the direction of Mother God Damn
and then rise beyond her to crush her.
The setting lies in the full glitter of
China; it is the embodiment of splendor
and squalor, of tender emotion and stark
reality. The action moves swiftly from
one dramatic triumph to another, and on,
almost blindly, to the unforgettable end
where Mother God Damn utters the im
memorial truth:
"Feye!—Manchu and English—they do
not mix! In one body—four things tight
—two minds—two souls—l knew it was
the law ! But I would not have it so! —1
thought my hands the law! Hut 1 would
not have it so!—I thought my bands were
strong—l took fate into them and tried to
deal it out —but though 1 ran—the gods
faster—and tonight they caught me!"
For those who arc not moralists, and
who like a well-written piece of work
with a good plot, "The Shanghai Ges
ture" is recommended as a first-class two;
hours' diversion.
