# GAMBLERS RECEIVE RECOGNITION FROM CHAPPIE EDITORS
## 
### 
Full recognition will be given the
patrons of a world vice ranking next to
"Wine, Women, and Song" in the No
vember issue of Chaparral, announces the
Old Boy, filled with enthusiasm over his
•latest brain-child—the Gamblers' Number
of the Stanford comic.
Absolutely every form and style of the
motley collection of games of chance will
be featured, from the infantile pastime
of playing jacks, to the epitome of Lady
Luck as typified in Big Game hazards,
World Series results, and Dempsey-Tun
ney tea-fights. The day of the Gamblers
is here, avows the Ancient One while
swinging his silver hammer.
Thursday, October 14, has been set as
the deadline date for the receiving of
copy for the Gamblers' Number, all art
work and other material being due on this
date. Copy may be mailed to Box 15,
Campus, or left at the Chaparral olfices
in the Press building. Special copy in
fitting with the Gamblers' Number is
particularly desired, although all contri
butions will be accepted for consideration.
