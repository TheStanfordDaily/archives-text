# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
1 lie other day I discussed tlie longest forward pass on record. Here are
lour other football marks that are down in the book as the longest of their
kind: two kicks and two runs.
C. S. McCaa, of Lafayette, shares wtih Bennie Boynton, of Williams, the
honor of making the longest run in football history. McCaa took the ball from
scrimmage and dashed the length of the field against Swartlimore on October
15, 1909, about a year before the distance was shortened to an even one hun
dred yards. Boynton's run was made after catching a punt ten yards behind
his own goal line.
1 here are in all twenty-six other "Famous Runs" of one hundred yards
or more made from 1873 to 1926, one of the most sensational of which was
that of the Indian, Dillon, against Harvard, with the ball hidden under the
back of his jersey. It is generally understood that that bit of trickery won
the game for Carlisle, but Pop Warner told me once that that was not the case.
Another sensational dash, this time to a winning touchdown, was made by
the great Arthur Poe, of Princeton, against Yale in 1898. It is classed as a
run from a fumble, but Poe really wrenched the ball from the arms of an
opponent.
The field-goal record, 1873 to 1926, credits J. T. Haxall, of Princeton, with
the longest of all place-kicks, one of sixty-five yards against Yale on November
30, 1882. Mark Payne, of Dakota Wesleyan, kicked the record drop-kick when
he booted one between the goal posts from sixty-three yards away on October
16, 1915. Strangely enough, the record field-goal for high-school players was
made on the very same afternoon, by Orson Wilcox, of Mansfield (Pa.) Normal
School, against Wyoming Seminary. His kick was fifty-five yards to the goal
posts.
Pat O'Dea, of Wisconsin, and George Gipp, of Notre Dame, each kicked
sixty-two-yard drop-kicks in intercollegiate games, while O'Dea, in May 1898,
made an exhibition drop-kick of sixty-three yards, eleven inches. One Chad
wick is supposed to have made a place-kick of sixty-six yards, two feet, eight
inches at Exeter, N.H., on November 29, 1887, but the record is not generally
accepted.
