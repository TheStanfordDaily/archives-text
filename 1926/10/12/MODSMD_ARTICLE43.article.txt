# STANFORD ORDNANCE DEPARTMENT SHOWS FIELD REPAIR TRUCK
## Complete Machine Shop on Wheels Acquired by R.O.T.C. Unit 
### 
A complete machine shop on wheels
is the artillery repair truck for mak
ing minor repairs in the field now on
display in the ordnance department of
the Stanford R.O.T.C. The truck
chassis is known as the FWD, the
letters standing for four-wheel drive.
The arrangement of the truck is the
height of compactness and efficiency.
\ series of drawers at the back of the
truck contains every tool requisite to
'! fully equipped machine shop. The
drawers are systematically numbered
iiid their contents listed, which facili
tates greatly their use. Among the
tools in the drawers are gauges of
all types and sizes, inside and outside
calipers, all sizes of drills from small
est to largest, reamers, dies, pipe
cutters, an electrical hand* drill, a
breast drill, and electrical repair ma
terials.
Generates Own Electricity
The truck has in its center a small
gasoline engine which supplies power
to a small generator. The generator
develops electrical energy for a power
lathe, a tool grinder, an air compres
sor for a pneumatic hammer, a sta-
Monary drill, and electric lights for
night work on the truck.
Chemistry majors should be inter
ested in the work of this department
as it has much to do with high ex
plosives, the chemical end of warfare.
Students of metallurgy and those in
terested in mechanical lines will find
much of great value along their line of
endeavor in the work of this depart
ment.
The electrical equipment of the
chronograph arrived a short time ago,
and will be set up for use during the
quarter. The chronograph is an instru
ment used to measure the muzzle ve
locity of projectiles of all calibers.
