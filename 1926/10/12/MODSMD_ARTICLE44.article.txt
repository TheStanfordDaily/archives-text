# EX COMMITTEE WILL NAME STUDENT BODY SECRETARY TONIGHT
## 
### 
Appointment to the post of secre
tary of the A.S.S.U. will be made at
the meeting of the Executive Commit
tee this evening. Members of the com
mittee have been charged to submit
names of persons thought suitable for
: the position. The appointment method
I has been held by the Executive Com
! mittee more suitable under the cir
cumstances and less expensive than
j the usual procedure of holding a spe
cial election.
Robert E. Lewis, student manager,
will present the first draft of a plan
| inaugurating a tryoutee system for the
j managership of the Concert Series.
This plan will be installed next year,
providing the concerts prove success
! ful this season.
The problem of diiecting the series
this year was handled by the appoint
ment of a manager who receives a
stipulated amount per concert for his
services. The work has been too heavy
for one person to handle, however,
according to a check made by Lewis,
j and the substitution of a manager and
I assistants working for the reward of
! managership is deemed necessary in
the event of future A.S.S.U. musical
! series.
Should the pi, -in presented by Lewis
| prove acceptable to the committee, it
will probably be put into effect at
once and a call will be issued for try
ontees to serve for the remainder of
j tho year.
Tlie meeting is cnllod for 7:15 p.m.,
the permanent starting hour decided
upon at the last meeting, and will take
place in the A.S.S.U. office in the Old
J Union.
