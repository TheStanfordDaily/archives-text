# PROFESSOR LUTZ SAYS POLISH SYSTEM FAULTY
## 
### 
Lack of economic organization,
rather than dearth of capital, is the
seat of Polish monetary difficulties,
according to Dr. Ilarley L. Lutz, pro
fessor of economics, who returned
Friday from Poland where he served
as a member of the American Eco
nomic Commission engaged by the
Polish government to reorganize the
financial system of that country.
"Poland is a rich country with a big
producing capacity, but the people
there do not understand how to make
the greatest use of their resources."
said Professor Lutz upon his return.
"They think their handicap is lack of
capital. Put as a matter of fact, there
is an abundance of money there. It
would be impossible to tell how many
millions of dollars in United States
currency are in Poland, having ac
cumulated there as a result of the
remittances from this country made
by generations of Polish emigrants."
An example of the lack of financial
organization of the country, accord
ing to the professor, may be seen in
the grain situation. "Poland is a won
derful grain country," ho said, "and
it is in grain that its future lies; yet
there are not more than half a dozen
grain elevators or warehouses there,
and as a result the farmer must sell
his grain wherever he can and for
whatever he can get at the time."
Another factor in Polish conditions
that is a handicap to the development
of the state, according to Professor
Lutz, is the lack of a middle class. On
one hand are the aristocratic people,
who possess wealth and education,
while a vast peasant population is on
the other. Few commercial and profes
sional Poles are between the two
classes. Merchandising is chiefly in
the hands of Jews and as a result is
despised by the Poles. There are few
professional men in the country.
The salvation of the Polish people,
Professor Lutz says, lies in the capa
city of the people to learn. In the
fact that the government has engaged
a commission of experts to make sug
gestions, however, the economist sees
hope. "If they continue to look for
expert advice and to act upon it, the
country will make headway," is Pro
fessor Lutz's analysis of the situa
tion.

In regard to the governmental situa
. tion Professor Lutz would give no
j opinion. "Things have changed too
[ rapidly since we left there," he said.
"At the time we left Poland Josef
Pilsudski seemed to be fading out of
I the picture; he seemed to be getting
| increasingly less important and less
essential, but during our voyage home
J we got the wireless news that Pilsud
j ski had made himself prime minister."
The report made by the commission
] of which Professor Lutz was a mem
| ber has been completed and delivered
; to the Polish ministry of finance. The
j commission was composed of the fol
j lowing seven members, each an ex
pert in his line; Professor E. W. Kem
j merer, economist of Princeton Univer
| sity, chairman, his field being the
stabilization of currency; Professor
'Lutz, taxation; Wallale Clark of New
j York, industrial engineer; Frank Eble
, of the United States Customs Service,
; Berlin, customs; J. T. Byrne of New
York, accountant; J. C. Broderick,
< vice-president of the National Bank of
i Commerce of New York, banking;
j Professor F. D. Graham of Princeton
University, secretary.
Professor Lutz will speak Wednes
day night at the Congregational
church in Palo Alto on his Polish ex

there do not understand how to make
the greatest use of their resources."
said Professor Lutz upon his return.
"They think their handicap is lack of
capital. Put as a matter of fact, there
is an abundance of money there. It
would be impossible to tell how many
millions of dollars in United States
currency are in Poland, having ac
cumulated there as a result of the
remittances from this country made
by generations of Polish emigrants."
An example of the lack of financial
organization of the country, accord
ing to the professor, may be seen in
the grain situation. "Poland is a won
derful grain country," ho said, "and
it is in grain that its future lies; yet
there are not more than half a dozen
grain elevators or warehouses there,
and as a result the farmer must sell
his grain wherever he can and for
whatever he can get at the time."
Another factor in Polish conditions
that is a handicap to the development
of the state, according to Professor
Lutz, is the lack of a middle class. On
one hand are the aristocratic people,
who possess wealth and education,
while a vast peasant population is on
the other. Few commercial and profes
sional Poles are between the two
classes. Merchandising is chiefly in
the hands of Jews and as a result is
despised by the Poles. There are few
professional men in the country.
The salvation of the Polish people,
Professor Lutz says, lies in the capa
city of the people to learn. In the
fact that the government has engaged
a commission of experts to make sug
gestions, however, the economist sees
hope. "If they continue to look for
expert advice and to act upon it, the
country will make headway," is Pro
fessor Lutz's analysis of the situa
tion.

In regard to the governmental situa
. tion Professor Lutz would give no
j opinion. "Things have changed too
[ rapidly since we left there," he said.
"At the time we left Poland Josef
Pilsudski seemed to be fading out of
I the picture; he seemed to be getting
| increasingly less important and less
essential, but during our voyage home
J we got the wireless news that Pilsud
j ski had made himself prime minister."
The report made by the commission
] of which Professor Lutz was a mem
| ber has been completed and delivered
; to the Polish ministry of finance. The
j commission was composed of the fol
j lowing seven members, each an ex
pert in his line; Professor E. W. Kem

stabilization of currency; Professor
'Lutz, taxation; Wallale Clark of New

Lack of economic organization,
