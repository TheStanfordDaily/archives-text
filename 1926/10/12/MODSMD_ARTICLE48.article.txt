# U.C. STUDENT HEAD ASKS STANFORD TO SUPPORT FUND BILL
## 
### 
Co-operation was the principle pur
pose of the student body assembly
held yesterday morning. Stanley Wei
gel introduced Robert McCarthy, the
student body president of California.
McCarthy called attention to the fact
that the University of California had
given Stanford her support a few years
ago when there was a bill before the
people for the taxation of endowed
universities. He requested Stanford's
support in an amendment which is to
come up soon. This amendment will
make possible an addition to the
Berkeley campus and will also supply
building funds for the Southern
Branch. He spoke also of the good
feeling which had always existed be
tween Stanford and California.
Charlotte Lovekin, the women's stu
dent body president, urged all women
(o go out for some activities. She em
phasized the desirability of the sup
port of the men. Harry M. Bennett,
(he editor of The Stanford Daily also
stressed activities for both men and
women. The next speaker, Glenn S.
Warner, varsity football coach, asked
the student body to support athletics
not only by attending the games but
by going out for them, also. He gave
over-confidence as tlie cause of the
poor showing of the football team.
Stanley Weigel closed the assembly
with a speech urging co-operation with
California and constant consideration
for the interests of our own Univer
sity.
