# ESPERANTO FOSTERS INTERNATIONAL SPIRIT ASSERTS E.A. ROGERS
## European Youth Movement Now Working to Form World Union 
### 
"Esperanto is the leavening factor in
creating good will among all European
youth," declared E. A. Rogers, principal
of the Montezuma Mountain School for
Boys, who spoke on "Trailing European
Youth Movements" in a lecture before
the Cosmopolitan Club last evening.
"The international spirit is fostered
through this medium; the leading pro
fessors in European universities are sup
porting this international means of com
munication in order to bring about a
world union.
"Undoubtedly the war awoke youth to
the possibilities of internationalism, for
the youth revolted after the struggle be
cause they had been pushed into war.
They suffered so much that they desired
to start any movement wherein youth
might have a hand, and Esperanto is one
of the channels of expression."
During the agitation following the war
the European youth has discovered that
war must cease and that secret diplomacy
is detrimental; that economic conditions
demand international arrangements, that
the mingling of races brings international
health problems before us, that there is a
demand for education to deal with labor
problems, and that travel and communi
cation demand world interest.
General plans of the youth movement
include working upon international re
ligious, social, educational, and political
movements, and study of international
problems in general.
"The youth movement needs first of all
a common cause big enough to attract the
assistance of adults," declared Rogers. "It
must be international enough to overcome
racial and other prejudices and must be
interesting and exciting enough to chal
lenge youth to make sacrifices for its
cause."
"Youth movements have progressed less
in the United States than in any European
country. The American younger genera
tion has not yet awakened to the necessity
of promoting international movements,"
asserted the speaker.
"While in Europe I was impressed by
the fact that young people there arc more
democratic than arc those of America.
They are more democratic in tecling,
desires, and ideals."
