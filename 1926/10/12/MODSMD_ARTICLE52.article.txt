### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
Oct. 11.â€”Following the advent of the
largest freshman class in the history of
Washington, faculty leaders are pointing
out the importance of early emphasis
being laid on the part the Honor Code
plays in Washington scholastic life.
There is no probability of change from
the status of the Code last year. To live
up to the Honor Pledge is declared to be
a privilege as well as a duty.
