# TELEGRAPH ON WANE AS MEANS OF MODERN TRAIN DISPATCHING

That the telephone Is gradually sup- i
planting the telegraph as a means of |
.lain dispatching was developed in a
port submitted to the annual con- j
vention of the Telephone and Tele- 1
graph Section of the American Rail- J
way Association, meeting at Swamp
cott, Mass.
Prior to 11)08, the telegraph was '
tactically the only means of com- !
iunication for control of train move
lents. Since then there has been a
airly rapid and steady development
the telephone service. Today, not
•nly are a majority of the orders i
egulating train movement handled by
dephone, but also a great volume of
general communications.
Less training is required to handle
the telephone efficiently and there is'
ass physical and mental strain on the
perators. In event of emergencies,
rst-hand information can be given
ore intelligently, and with less ex
itement and less time than with the
lograph.
Where the telegraph still remains, |
tomatio appliances are being in- i
stalled that not only save time, but
e more accurate. Experiments are
being conducted to determine the prac
ticability of maintaining constant
adio communication between both
nds of a long train. These are not
t a success.
