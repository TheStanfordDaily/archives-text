The half hundred dogs of all sizes

ment live together in peace, but that's
because they're well-fed, admits Pro
! fessor E. W. Schultz, associate profes
sor of bacteriology, who brings the
following story back from his recent
travels in the Far East.
The surplus of dogs became a prob
lenx in Constantinople not so long
and something had to be done to re
j duce the number. But the police had
kind-hearted scruples against doing
wholesale murder and there would
have been difficulty disposing of the
! bodies. So all the dogs in Coustanti
| nople were collected and given a
boat-ride to a barren island in the bay.
j Here thousands of them lived hap
pily for a while, the big dogs eating
i the little ones and the little ones
being relieved of the cares of this
life in progressively increasing sizes
as the supply began to run short.
Finally the population dwindled to one
' great battle-scarred veteran who fin
| ished off his last rival and starved to
death.
