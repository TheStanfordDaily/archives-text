# STANFORD STUDENTS URGED TO CONSIDER INDEPENDENT STUDY
## Assembly Speakers Urge Student Co-operation In All Activities 
### 
Upper Division students were yes
| terday reminded by Professor Albert
Guerard that the Independent Study
Plan which was inaugurated at Stan
ford in January, 1926, still remains in
I
force. Under this Plan, students of ex
ptional promise may work ahead in
i their chosen field, without being hin
j ac. Ed by certain formal requirements.
According to Professor Guerard two
j.ai.s, however, must be emphasized:
that the Independent Study Plan of
ic.s an opportunity to work harder
and not the reverse; and that it ap
plies to the method of study, not to the
which remains the same as with
usual system. The plan is admin
t eil through the Schools and De
. . nts, and all students interested
a.e requested to confer at the earliest
; p ; sible time with tlieir departmental
advisors.
The purpose of the Plan is to give
.. students an opportunity to exer-
I (ise their own initiative in their uni
v isity work and to go ahead as fast
as they desire. According to Professor
Terman, of the Psychology depart
ment, it is now recognized' that our
system of mass education tends to
4 om entrate on the average to the ne
glect of those of exceptional ability.
\he gifted, because they are not en
c.. uraged to forge ahead, are rarely re
i quired to exert themselevs, and often
I, hy degrees, into an intellectual
slump.
Various methods of reform have
lri> d out, but the independent
system is the one that has found
vor. This scheme, in one form
< another, has been widely adopted,
s now in operation in Harvard,
wu, Barnard, Yale, Vassar, and a
o; e of other institutions throughout
ountry.
