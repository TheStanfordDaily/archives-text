# FOOTBALL SHOW WILL SUPPLANT RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY BURLESQUE
## Female Impersonation Ban Compels Society's Use Of Old Policy DAVES NEW PRESIDENT Comic, Original Writings Desired by Club for Shows in Future 
### 
Ram's Head show is no more. In
stead of the traditional burlesque of
the winter quarter, the society will in
the future assume full sponsorship of
the Football Show. Ram's Head will
ttike active steps to encourage and fos
ter all kinds of creative work in writ
ing, acting, and producing for the
humorous stage. Such was the deci
sion reached at a meeting of the so
ciety held last night, following official
confirmation of the banning of female
impersonation from campus shows.
This change in procedure, according
to Delmer Daves, newly elected presi
dent of the organization, is not a to
tally new step but rather a return to
Hie original purpose for which the so
ciety was formed many years ago: the
development of original writing and
•acting for the Stanford stage. The pro
duction of shows featuring female im
personation, with which Ram's Head
has become associated, has been an
outgrowth of the last several years,
and does not represent the true aims
of the founders.
Five Activities Promoted
Five specific fields of activity will
be promoted and will be the future
basis of selection for membership in
the society. They are: writing original
music, writing original acts, dancing,
acting, and stage designing. Every ef
fort will be made to draw campus tal
ent into action for the production of
the annual Football Shows. As in the
past the membership of Ram's Head
will be strictly limited to men.
The night before the Big Game, re
gardless of the place the game is to
be played, was permanently selected
as the date for the show. Gordon Davis
is to assume the general direction of
the affair,
The decision to drop the regular
Ram's Head Show was unanimously
adopted by the members of the society
present at last night's meeting. It was
held that a change into staging skits
with women's parts would bring too
much competition into the field
against the Football Show and the
Junior Opera. Another point favoring
the abandoning of the traditional show
was tiie constant difficulty which has
been experienced in arranging a date
which would not conflict with basket
-1 ball games.
Founded in 1911
Ram's Head Society, founded at
Stanford September 13, 1911, has held
a long and active sway in campus dra
matics, and has been the starting
ground for a large number of men who
have become successful in the theatri
cal arts. The names of Lester Vail,
now a star on Broadway, Dixon Mor
gan, manager of the Wilkes produc
tions, Lewis McDermott, stage man
ager of the American Theatre in Chi
cago, Tom Carskadone, dramatic critic,
as well as Gordon Davis, well-known
actor and director of the Stanford
stage, can be found on the roster of
the society. Julian Eltinge and Charles
Field, both of national fame, are hon
orary professional members.
Davis Comments
Commenting on the change, Gordon
Davis stiid, "1 feel that this is the one
Irig chance for Ram's Head to retain
its original purpose, that of invigorat
ing creative composition at Stanford."
• " ; i'l Evans, '20, one of the former
heads of the organization, expressed
himself as favoring the new order. "I
always foil," tie in speaking of
female impersonation, "that the female
impersonation in the Ram's Head
shows was a growth rather than the
original purpose of the society. It is
my opinion that the change means
much for the fillure of the society."
The announcement of the plans now
under consideration for the coming
Football Show will be made within a
few days, according to Del Daves. An
organization of the writing groups on
the campus is projected for the pur
pose of attaining a nucleus for writ
ing the skits. A general call will fol
low for all capable of doing any sort
of creative work in amateur theatri
cals.
Del Daves and Byron Harvey were
tary respectively of the organization
last night elected president and secre
for the ensuing year.
