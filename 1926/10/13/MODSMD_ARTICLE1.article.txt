# FOOTBALL SHOW WILL SUPPLANT RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY BURLESQUE
## Female Impersonation Ban Compels Society's Use Of Old Policy DAVES NEW PRESIDENT Comic, Original Writings Desired by Club for Shows in Future 
### 
Ram's Head show is no more. In
stead of the traditional burlesque of
the winter quarter, the society will in
the future assume full sponsorship of

music, writing original acts, dancing,
acting, and stage designing. Every ef
fort will be made to draw campus tal

the annual Football Shows. As in the
past the membership of Ram's Head
will be strictly limited to men.

be played, was permanently selected
as the date for the show. Gordon Davis
is to assume the general direction of

The decision to drop the regular
Ram's Head Show was unanimously
adopted by the members of the society
present at last night's meeting. It was
held that a change into staging skits

much competition into the field
against the Football Show and the
