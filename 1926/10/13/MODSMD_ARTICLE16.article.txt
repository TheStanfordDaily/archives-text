# CHINESE SEEK OWN SOLUTION, ASK NO AID, STATES WANG
## Students Realize Education Needed as Solution For Difficulties

"Although America is our best
riend, we are expecting nothing from
for fair play and an opportunity to
her in sympathy or help. We ask only
to work out our solution," asserted
i so Yan Wang in his lecture on"The
'hincse Youth Movement" in the Lit
le Theatre last evening.
"Chinese conditions today are ex
ictly like a scrambled egg," said
Wang. "Chinese students realize that
if they do not rise to save China,
Jure will be no China in another
generation.
"Starting on the theory that all
jvils in the Chinese situation are due
o corrupt government, the youth
started a political reform movement
some twenty or thirty years ago.
"Although one political party feeling
that the Chinese people were not
ready for a drastic change advocated
a monarchy, the party favoring a re
publican form of government was suc
cessful in instituting a republic.
China Not Republic
"China is everything and anything
but a republic, and we made a mis
take in adopting a republican form of
government because the people were
not yet ready for it. Finding that it
was not possible to remedy the evil
by just changing the name of the gov
ernment, the policy of education was
adopted," Wang said.
Following the Chinese-Japanese war
a new system of education was estab
lished providing for innovations in
methods of instruction and a curricu
lum not based on classics. Surveys of
education to determine the inefficiency
of the system have also been formed
during the last few years.
Many Illiterates
Two million illiterates have learned
the fundamentals of reading and writ
ing as a result of the mass education
movement started in China a few
years ago.
One of the most important move
ments in China is the nationalist
movement whose purpose is to restore
to the Chinese the power which has
been taken from them by foreign in
vasion and exploitation.
Chinese Out of Work
The fears of China are both external
md internal. Internally her govern
ment is unstable, and the country is
nvolved in civil wars. Economically
China is undergoing an industrial
revolutio which throws out of work
many people who either become ban
dits or soldiers.
China's moral fear is caused by the
fact that not the best but the worst
of western civilization has been intro
duced. Her psychological fear arises
because the mass of the people are
indifferent to existing situations.
China is also confronted with the
peril of exploitation by outside power
ful nations.
