A majority of the money necessary to insure the coming series of
musical concerts has already been paid in to the manager in charge.
However, this does not mean that it is unnecessary for the remainder of
those who signed pledges to make remittances.
If one member of each living group would volunteer to collect the
money of all the pledges in his group, it would greatly facilitate the col
lection of the money. Naturally, those getting the money in first have
the opi>ortunity to be allotted the best seats.
The section set aside for the students includes the most desirable
seats, and it has been arranged so that any two wishing to sit together
may do so by indicating that fact when making the remittance.
As far as it has been possible to determine, the Stanford concert
series will be the most notable venture of its kind ever ventured, by a
university. Other colleges have had artist series, but none has had such
a distinguished group of musicians as that which will appear at the
basketball pavilion at various dates during the coming year.
The financial success of the undertaking this year is necessary in
order that these series may become an annual feature.
Satisfaction is being expressed about the campus over the fact that
the concerts are to become, an actuality, and that they will be presented
by and for the Associated Students. Sta- .'ord has at times in the past
been charged with a lack of appreciation for the better things. An
annual series of musical events of this caliber would go far toward
disproving such a statement.
