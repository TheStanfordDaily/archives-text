# Ram's Head
## 
### 
Rani's Head Society, which in the past has presented a yearly bur
lesque show, will give the Football Gaities before the Big Game this
season. The burlesque has been one of the best attended of the year's
dramatic productions in yars gone by.
It has been the one show that the "rough" could go to expecting an
evening of farce, and come away from the Assembly Hall completely
satisfied. Stanford theatregoers will miss an evening of "good clean
fun," if we may be allowed to use a phrase of last year's vintage.
But maybe it is all for the best, for campus dramatics are not only
for the amusement of the audience, but arc also to train the, Stanford
student along dramatic lines. Female impersonation will be of very
little value to a young man after he has completed his college course.
The burlesque has gone the way of many other beloved traditions—
but it offers a good vaudeville show as a substitute. Ram's Head has
sponsored many excellent affairs in the past few years and undoubtedly
they will continue with their successes. Also, the Football Gaieties is
now in capable hands.
