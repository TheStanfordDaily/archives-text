# THE 						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
At the University of California is a
young man whose editorial ambition
has been aroused recently by the news
that certain of Stanford's Student
Body, spurred on by a San Francisco
sport cartoonist, are contemplating
the adoption of a symbol.
It apparently does not trouble the
young man whether we elect to call
ourselves "Indians" or "Pioneers."
What we need, he says, is a totem
such as California's "Golden Bear."
In concluding, he relieves himself
of the following pronounciamento:
"The all-important thing is not the
symbol itself, but what it conveys to
the mind of the observer."
* * * ,
Let us see what symbols do con
vey to the mind of the observer. The
Golden Bear itself suggests to the
loyal California router that particular
emotional force which welds into a
co-ordinate and animated whole the
teams and the student body of the
University; in short, the "California
Spirit."
To less partial observers, the Golden
Bear contains no suggestion other
than that Mr. Rockefeller's Zerolene

is a paragon among motor oils, a veri
table automobiles' ambrosia.

Consider Stanford herself as a sym
bol. To certain members of the fac
ulty she is an institution dedicated
solely to the pursuit of knowledge, to
certain of the alumni she is a place
for the rooting section to spend its
time on the 364 days of (he year when
there is no Big Game. Very different
impressions, indeed, but one can find
each represented in one of two ex
treme groups.
* * *
To the young man at California, we
have only one thing to say. We do
not need symbols at Stanford, that
they may convey something or other
to the minds of the observer. We need
to develop Stanford to the point
where she embodies an ideal so co
herently as to convoy itself, and we
need to develop the minds of the ob
servers to the point where they would
be capable of comprehending such an
ideal once it were formulated.
To the first of these two matters,
we are doing our utmost to attend,
here at Stanford.
