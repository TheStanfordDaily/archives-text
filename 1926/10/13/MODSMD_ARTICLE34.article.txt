# SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY TRYOUTS DRAW MANY IN FIRST NIGHT
## 
### 
Answering the opening call for the
1926-27 Stanford dramatic season, more
than two hundred students tried out for
parts in the annual Sword and Sandals
play yesterday under the direction of
Gordon Davis. Of these, ninety-six arc
asked to report today either from 3 to 5
o'clock in the Assembly Hall, or from 7
to 9 o'clock in the Little Theater.
The large number of under-classmen
interested in activity in this line as shown
by the opening tryout is particularly en
couraging, stated Davis, as the major
part of the dramatic talent of last year
will be absent because of graduation and
withdrawal from school.
The necessary elimination of all but a
very few of those trying out for the
opening play of the year should in no
way cause students to drop interest in
the many other productions of the next
two quarters, urges Davis, as equally de
sirable opportunities for parts in the
Football Gaieties of 1926, to be produced
under the direction of Ram's Head, and
for the plays of the winter quarter in
particular are offered.
The following, having successfully
passed the first tryouts, are requested to
report as stated above, in addition to
others who were unable to be present
yesterday: Rupert Adams, Harlow Ala
baster, Sid Badcoms, Joe Bitterlin, Albert

Answering the opening call for the
1926-27 Stanford dramatic season, more
than two hundred students tried out for
parts in the annual Sword and Sandals
play yesterday under the direction of
Gordon Davis. Of these, ninety-six arc
asked to report today either from 3 to 5
o'clock in the Assembly Hall, or from 7
to 9 o'clock in the Little Theater.
The large number of under-classmen
interested in activity in this line as shown
by the opening tryout is particularly en
couraging, stated Davis, as the major
part of the dramatic talent of last year
will be absent because of graduation and
withdrawal from school.
The necessary elimination of all but a
very few of those trying out for the
opening play of the year should in no
way cause students to drop interest in
the many other productions of the next
two quarters, urges Davis, as equally de
sirable opportunities for parts in the
Football Gaieties of 1926, to be produced
under the direction of Ram's Head, and
for the plays of the winter quarter in
