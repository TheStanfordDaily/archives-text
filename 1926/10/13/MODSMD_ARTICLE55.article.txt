## Gridiron Oddities 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Almost "anything can happen" in fooiball ;is well as golf, as will be seen
aoni a perusal of the following incidents. Even though the gridiron is regu
lated in its dimensions, nature often gums up man's plans, as well as his
est efforts to keep the playing surface in even fair condiiton.
In the Northwestern-Michigan game last November, tae conditions were
probably worse than in any football game played in recent years. Each and
avery player was coated with mud in the first few minutes of play, and a
Michigan man looked just the same as a Northwestern man. It was no
vonder, then, that Captain Tim Lowry, of Northwestern, the man whose
strategy later in the game in ordering a safety probably prevented a Michigan
•ictory, tackled one of his own teammates who had grabbed a Wolverine
fumble and was spashing on to a touchdown.
As for Bemis Pierce, he knew that he was attacking an opponent from
Yale all right; the only trouble was that the giant Indian was not in the game
at the time, having been put out for repeated violations of the rules. This
was back in the days before Pop Warner went to Carlisle as coach, and the
Indians didn't know much about football, but oh, boy, how rough they could
! Pi rce thought of nothing but that a Yale man was dashing along the
side-lines with the ball, so he jumped back into the fray to execute a
beautiful but surprising tackle.
Another one for the book occurred in a high-school game last year,
between Fairview and Farmington, in West Virginia. On the second play after
t'ie kick-off a youth in civilian clothes waiked up to the Fairview center and
emanded the ball, the Farmington team thinking him an official about to
nalize teir opponents.. ITe started pacing towards the Farmington goal
'ine, and after passing the safety man, suddenly ran the remainder of the
distance with the ball. He was Fairview's captain in disguise, and he thus
ade the only score of the, game. Tricky, what?
