## 
### 
Traveling over five thousand miles
through eight states, geology majors at
the University of Kansas completed a
forty-two-day field trip during the sum
mer. Transportation was provided by a
truck, and the men cooked their own
meals. Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, Wyoming, and Nebraska were
among the states visited by the geology
group.
