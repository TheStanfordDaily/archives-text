THERE'S no other sport on the calendar to
compare with smoking a jimmy-pipe packed
with P. A. Indoors and out. Any season. You
win even when you draw, if you get what we
mean. And how you will draw, once you know
the wonderful taste of Prince Albert!
Cool as an over-cut notice from the dean.
Sweet as the thoughts of a holiday. Fragrant as
woodland flowers after a spring shower. P. A.
never bites your tongue or parches your throat. I'dy'Jj tinlf^^TJidhJ?.

Come out for this major sport. Get yourself >h ' f TOCe "-
