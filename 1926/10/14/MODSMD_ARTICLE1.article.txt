# COACH WARNER GIVES CHARGES HARD WORKOUT
## Redshirts Will Face Heavy Line in Wolfpack from Nevada FREEMAN BACK IN GAME Cardinal Gridders Hold Strenuous Drill With Grays 
### 
Tf hard work will make any difference
(he Card team ought to he a better eleven
next Saturday when it tackles the Nevada
Wolf pack. Warner gave his men no let
down last night, winding up an afternoon
of strenuous drill with a scrimmage be
tween the Grays and a team largely
composed of former second or third
string players.
Swan is still out with a bad foot and
Hoffman was watching practice as a spec
tator. Chris Freeman was in suit yester
-day for the first time since he was hurt
-early last week, and worked with the
so-called first string on p£ss formations.
Ordinarily the Red Shirts would be
in for a fairly easy game against the
Nevadans, Saturday, but being behind
about two weeks in their development the
Cards will probably have a tough job
•downing the fighting Wolfpack.
Coach "Buck" Shaw has a team which
is every bit as heavy as the Cards and
which is well versed in the Notre Dame
style of play. Captain Max Allen has
the reputation of being a hard-hitting
fullback and an all-around star. Bailey
and Frost, veterans of last year, are half
backs, the former being a triple threat
man. Lawson, quarterback, is also a
veteran. Five linesmen played on last
year's team, namely, Fairbrother, center;
Anderson, guard; Hansen and Newton,
tackles; and Bream, end. Lawlor, tackle,
and Peirce, end, are playing their first
year on the varsity.
Last Saturday the Nevadans defeated
Fresno State Teachers' 27-6. Although
the Cards beat the same team in the first
fame of the year 44-7, the Teachers are
an improved eleven since they met Stan
ford but as much can hardly be said for
the Cardinals, judging by their last per
formance.
