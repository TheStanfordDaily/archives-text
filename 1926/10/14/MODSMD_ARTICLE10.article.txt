# CONFERENCE GAMES NEXTSATURDAY WILL ELIMINATE TWO TEAMS
## Only Four Squads Will Be in Running After Trio of Games Are Over 
### 
After the smoke of next Saturday's
Pacific Coast Conference football bat
tles has cleared there will be only
four undefeated squads in the race,
which means that two of the present
six unbeaten aggregations will have
slipped down a peg.
One of the elevens to be lowered a
notch will be either Idaho or Washing
ton, for the schedule calls for these
squads to meet and only one can be
returned winner. The other conference
, game Saturday will feature Washing
j ton State College against Montana.
| Stanford, U.S.C., and Oregon do not
' meet Conference rivals.
Of the trio of games which will
j count in the standings, the one at
I Berkeley between the Golden Bears
i and the Oregon Aggies is attracting
most of the attention, for much de
pends on the outcome of that strug
gle. If the Aggies win, as many predict
they will, they have a very good
chance of making a place for them
selves near the top of the ladder, but
if they lose they can be counted as
practically out of the running.
The orange-clad warriors from the
j North are coming down with a fine
early-season record, having piled up
j more than 125 points in three games,
j They are regarded as the strongest
I team in their section, and if they are
able to turn in a victory it looks as
though the only team which could
I challenge their right to the title is
i U.S.C., inasmuch as the Aggies have
neither Stanford nor Washington on
their schedule.
The Aggies, as a result of their im-
pressive start, rule favorites over the
Beurs. Coach Schissler's team is made
up of veterans both on the line and
in the backfield. His main threat is
VVes Schulmerich, 200-pound fullback,
who was one of the best ground-gain
ers on the Pacific Coast last year, but
in Luby, Jarvis, Edwards, Maples, Ed
wards, and Denman he has enough
ball-carriers to satisfy any needs that
might arise.
Washington rules a heavy favorite
over Idaho. The Huskies displayed
real offensive power in defeating Ore
gon 23 to 9 last Saturday, and while
Idaho won its game from Montana
27 to 12, it is doubtful indeed whether
Charley Erb's squad will be able to
withstand the powerful attacks of the
Washington backs.
The other conference attraction, the
one between Montana and Washing
ton State, brings together two of the
teams which have already been forced
(o admit defeat. Of the two, the Cou
gars appear much stronger as a result
of their good showing against the Tro
jans last Saturday. Montana is prob
ably the weakest team in the Confer
ence.
U.S.C. meets Occidental in a game
that may prove a basis for comparing
Stanford and the Trojans. Stanford
defeated Oxy 19 to 0 and what the
Trojans do against them may show
how these two rivals line up. It will
also show whether U.S.C. just had an
"off day" against the Cougars or not.
Nevada comes to compete against
Stanford. Nevada's strength is little
known, but it is probable that their
team is none too strong. In this game
Coach Warner will have a chance to
test his men and plays once more
before he sends his team into the
Conference fight against Oregon at
Eugene on October 23. Oregon is also
free from Conference work Saturday,
which gives Captain McEwan an op
portunity to make a few changes in
his squad before the Stanford game.
