# CHINESE STUDENTS CRITICS OF GOVERNMENT---WANG
## 
### 
"As part of their political program
students in China organize the con
duct of officials," said Tso Yan Wang,
in an interview yesterday. Wang, who
! is the Director of the Commission of
Education from Manchuria, spoke on
"The Chinese Youth Movement" in
the Little Theatre Tuesday evening.
"Students not only discuss political
affairs but they publish their reports,
issue handbills, ilistribute pamphlets,
i and hold parades and demonstrations
' in an effort to promote their party,
which for the majority of students *s
the nationalist party."
Many of the Chinese youth are at
tending Schools of Politics and Law
where prospective national leaders are
training, according to Wang.
Engineering and education courses
;ire the most important branches of
the universities because China is in
need of educators to educate the mass,
and engineers are necessary to de
velop the national resources and to
better living conditions .
While contrasting American educa
tion with that in other countries, Wang

said, "American universities are the
best in the world, their students seem
to be less bound by prejudices and
have a more international outlook than
do those of other countries."
In speaking of the power of the
press in China, Wang pointed out that
the newspapers in Shanghai have a
progressive influence, although in (he
smaller cities they have little effect.
"The anti-Christian movement in
( hina is not a protest against mis
sionaries and has nothing to do with
the principles of Christianity but is a
reaction caused by the unChristianly
acts of aggression of powerful nations
who are exploiting China," declared
Wang.
"Despite the fact that Confuscianism
is characterized as a religion of super
stition, it is no more superstitious In
character than are the principles of
Christianity. Just as Americans be
lieve that China should learn about
Christianity, we believe that America
should study Confuscianism. The Euro
pean wars show the weakness of
Christianity.
"Although internally China wishes
to solve her own problems, interna
tionally China is looking to America
for moral aid. The Chinese students
of today expect America to play fair
with China by abolishing all unequal
treaties between the two nations and
by revising the relations between the
two countries on the principle of reci
procity.
"China hopes that America will dis
entangle herself from other world
powers in dealing with her."
Wang, who is at present touring
America, is lecturing on such subjects
as "The Chinese Youth Movement,"
"The Analysis of Anti-Christian Move
ment in China," "Spirit of Chinese
People," "Chinese Marriage and Home
Life," "Chinese Language, Literature,
and Art." Choosing as his topic,
"What Ts the Matter with China,"
Wang lectured before the Century
Club in San Francisco today.
"I am giving these lectures in order
to know more about America so that
when I go back to China I shall have
something to tell them of the best
side of the United States. I also wish
to tell America what the real condi
tions and culture of China are," said
Wang.
