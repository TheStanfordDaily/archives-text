# CAST TO REPEAT SUMMER SUCCESS OF COWARD FARCE
## Play Depicts Sophisticated Modern Life; Humorous Situations Abound 
### Walter Walsh 
"Hay Fever," a tomedy by Noel
Coward, author of "Vortex," is to be
presented by the Dramatic Council in
the Assembly Hall on October 22,
under the direction of Gordon Davis.
The cast, which is practically the
same as that of the summer quarter,
when "Hay Fever" was presented for
the first time in the West, has already
been chosen.
The characters are Judith Bliss, an
actress, to be played by Patrice Nau
man; David Bliss, a novelist, her hus
band, played by J. S. Doron; the two
children, Sorel and Simon, who will
be portrayed by Norma Seib and Byron
Harvey; Clara, the maid, played by
Alberta Yearian, and the week-end
guestsâ€”Myra Arundel, Richard Great
ham, Jackie Coryton, and Sandy Igiell,
to be played by Lucie Bentley, Ray
Haislip, Enid Wahl, and Frederick Zit
kowski, respectively.
"Hay Fever" is a scintillating com
edy of sophisticated modern life. The
action takes place in the Bliss home
at Cockrham, England, in June, and
covers a period of one day, Saturday
afternoon, Saturday evening, and Sun
day morning. Les Kiler, whose ability
in arranging scenes, needs no intro
duction to campus dramatic lovers,
will handle the sets.
The plot of "Hay Fever" is full of
funny situations. David Bliss has re
tired to his home to write novels ac
companied by a round of teas and
bridge parties. Both he and his wife,
Judith, are more interested in their
respective careers than in their chil
dren, Sorel and Simon, who are left
more or less to themselves.
On the particular week-end in which
the play takes place David Bliss has
invited a woman admirer of his to
help him with his novel. Likewise,
Judith, has invited her favorite fol
lower to spend the week-end at the
Bliss home. To round out matters
Sorel and Simon have each asked
their respective friends. There fol
lows a series of humorous complica
tions wherein the four couples are
continually trying to extricate them
selves from various embarrassing en
tanglements.
"Hay Fever" is light comedy, but is
of sufficient quality to afford refresh
ing entertainment from start to finish.
