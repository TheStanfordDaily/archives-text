# WIT MASKS DISCUSSION OF HOPES, FEARS FROM SCIENCE
## Audience Decision on Merits Of Question Given to Stanford's Side FUTURE HELD HOPEFUL Godsall, Criswell Shine for Australian, Stanford Debate Squads 
### 
In a shower of wit and subtlety,
tempered with a well-planned course
of argument, the Australian style of
debating was exemplified for the first
time before a Stanford audience last
night in the encounter between the
Sydney University forensic trio and
the Stanford varsity team.
Upholding admittedly the difficult
side of the question, "Resolved, That
we have more to fear than to hope
for from science," the Australians, led
by Dr. John R. Godsall, in a well,-con
structed case, brought out the dangers
likely to result from applied science,
particularly when directed toward the
improvement of methods of warfare.
Overpopulation and war were the
two chief evils ascribed by the affirma
tive to science. These contentions
were effectively introduced by the
Australian team in the midst of ban
ter directed good-naturedly at the
Stanford representatives. Sydney H.
lleathwood, in particular, amused the
audience, which numbered fully one
thousand, with sally after sally of wit.
John C. Duniway, the Stanford lead
er, was particularly brilliant in the
attack on the question. His conten
tion that science is not mere knowl
edge, but that like art and religion it
enters into the human spirit, was a
strong point in the favor of the nega
tive. Theodore F. Baer, speaking sec
ond for the varsity, developed the
contention that science is but a tool
of mankind and that any misuse of its
power is the fault of man and not of
science itself.
Noel D. Mcintosh, for Sydney, and
H. B. Criswell, Stanford, each gave
perhaps among the most substantial
and meaty arguments of the evening.
Criswell showed excellent style and
promises to be a useful member of
this year's teams. He comes a trans
fer from Cornell University.
The audience decision, made on
the merits of the question after the
debate, was announced by Dr. Robert
E. Swain, presiding chairman, as be
ing 126 favoring the affirmative and
278 the negative of the question.
