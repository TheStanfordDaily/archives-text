# Why at U. S. C.

### 
Stanford's football team this fall makes two trips. The absence of
the squad at Oregon and U.S.C. on two successive week-ends, and the
playing - of the Big Game at the California stadium leave only the Wash
ington game as a high-light in the home schedule.
This arrangement, which has given rise to much wonder, is caused
by the difficulty in arranging a Conference schedule which will fit into
the plans and needs of all the nine teams. Besides convenience to the
rooters of each university financial practicability must be considered in
arranging contests.
Under the original plans of the Conference, no games would have
been played in the bay region with Stanford away at Oregon, and
California at U.S.C. the same Saturday. On the next week-end the
Cardinals and Bears would have been occupied with U.S.C. and Oregon
respectively, when both games would have drawn against each other.
As this schedule was bad from all points of view, a change by either
California or Stanford was necessary. After considerable discussion and
hesitation the Stanford representatives at the Conference meeting decided
to make the change instead of Berkeley.
When the Big Game is at California, Stanford does not get as much
returns from the seat sale. Here all sales over 65,000 go to the Board
of Athletic Control, and the state university has the same-privilege when
it has the contest. Thus, financially, it was better for Stanford to play
at both Los Angeles and Oregon. An additional consideration was that
the Cardinals had previously refused to make two northern journeys in
the same season. This would have been the lot of the Bears, as they
had this year to travel to Washington.
With Stanford giving way this year, it will be unnecessary fo make
two such trips, as to Oregon and Los Angeles, again. Rooters are
assured of a good home schedule in the future.
