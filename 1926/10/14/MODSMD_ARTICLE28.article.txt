# NELLIE BALLOU'S BOOK EXPOSES GUM CHEWERS ENTERING FRESHMEN HANDED INSIDE INFORMATION COLLEGIATE "LOW DOWN" PRINTED AT LAST
## 
### 
"Etiquette at College," a recent book
by Nellie Ballou which is published
by the Handy Book Corporation, con
tains a wealth of valuable information
for serious-minded students, especially
freshmen.
As the title indicates, the book dis
cusses those problems of etiquette
which particularly affect the college
student. Every question of "What to
do" and "How to do it" is handled
plainly and simply by Nellie Ballou.
Several chapters are primarily for
the entering freshman. Some of their
titles are: "A Good Start," "First Im
pressions," "Little Things That Go
a Long Way," and "Good Looks."
Other chapters are more general in
their discussion. The following quota
tions are from a chapter headed "Eti
quette of Sports."
In» regard to choosing swimming
caps—"Caps are plain and most often
of pure rubber in its natural color.
Red rubber, however, is a practical
choice. It shows the location of swim
mers, plainly preventing collisions by
beginners, and makes the amateur
easier to see if she accidentally goes
down in water that is not .very clear."
Later we read —"Before entering the
pool, one takes a cold shower to ac
custom the body to a sudden change
in temperature. Then without delay
one should plunge in without linger
ing."
Another useful item is the following
on gymnasium manners —"Before sit
ting down, one should make sure that
one's seat is safe. The folding chairs
used in many gyms are easily broken.
It causes a disturbance when a chair
breaks under some excited rooter at
a crisis in a game, leaving neither
room to sit nor stand. A sound chair
at the beginning, however, can be de
pended upon to stand all strain, and if
it can be kept from folding up it is all
right."
While the next bit of etiquette might
prove'useful at the Big Game —"Chew-
ing gum at games is very common.
Some think it calms excitement. In

j anxiety, however, the phenomenon of
a row of a dozen friends all chewing
! gum in dead earnest, is too funny to
mention in detail. Toothpicks are not
j worn between the teeth of thoughtful
| spectators."
Here is an excerpt from a chapter
on dancing—"People who do not dance
well should not inflict themselves on
others at a dance. It is better not to
dance at all, and to make one's self
agreeable in some other way than to
leave a trail of partners feeling one
j is hopeless."
Advice to girls—"A girl owes it to
! her partner to look just as attractive
| as she can, and to be a model of per
fect and charming behavior, so that he
I will be proud of her."
And this next choice sentence is to
aid in the selection of a partner for
the Prom —"Practically every girl in
college is good-looking, well-dressed,
and vivacious."
On the choice of a masquerade cos
l tume —"If a girl is slender and goes
[as a shepherd youth or a page, she is
reminiscent of 'As You Like It' and
'Twelfth Night,' and the poetic thought
helps her along, but she had better
| get an honest appraisal from her
friends (and enemies) before attempt
: ing public appearance. Legs slightly
{ bowed or knock-knees can utterly spoil
j the most beautiful fancy. Even funny
■ feet are fatal, no matter how lovely
; the face is."
All of us, practically, need assistance
in table manners. The next paragraph
I quote from Nellie Ballou's book,
| "Etiquette at College," should prove
j especially pertinent.
Eating corn on the cob —"Go at it
frankly and as conservatively as pos
sible in the natural manner. Butter
should not be put on in a quantity to
baste the chin of the eater. An ear
broken in two and held in one hand
is less greedy. The fingers remain best
well held toward the ends of the ear,
supporting it firmly. Needless to say,
engaged with corn on the cob
nothing else should be attempted, ges
tures or conversation."

"Etiquette at College," a recent book
by Nellie Ballou which is published
by the Handy Book Corporation, con
tains a wealth of valuable information
for serious-minded students, especially
freshmen.
As the title indicates, the book dis
cusses those problems of etiquette
which particularly affect the college
student. Every question of "What to
do" and "How to do it" is handled
plainly and simply by Nellie Ballou.
Several chapters are primarily for
the entering freshman. Some of their
titles are: "A Good Start," "First Im
pressions," "Little Things That Go
a Long Way," and "Good Looks."
Other chapters are more general in
their discussion. The following quota
tions are from a chapter headed "Eti
quette of Sports."
In» regard to choosing swimming
caps—"Caps are plain and most often
of pure rubber in its natural color.
Red rubber, however, is a practical
choice. It shows the location of swim
mers, plainly preventing collisions by
beginners, and makes the amateur
easier to see if she accidentally goes
down in water that is not .very clear."
Later we read —"Before entering the
pool, one takes a cold shower to ac
custom the body to a sudden change
in temperature. Then without delay
one should plunge in without linger
ing."
Another useful item is the following
on gymnasium manners —"Before sit
ting down, one should make sure that
one's seat is safe. The folding chairs
used in many gyms are easily broken.
It causes a disturbance when a chair
breaks under some excited rooter at
a crisis in a game, leaving neither
room to sit nor stand. A sound chair
at the beginning, however, can be de
pended upon to stand all strain, and if
it can be kept from folding up it is all
right."
While the next bit of etiquette might
prove'useful at the Big Game —"Chew-
ing gum at games is very common.
Some think it calms excitement. In

j anxiety, however, the phenomenon of
a row of a dozen friends all chewing
! gum in dead earnest, is too funny to
mention in detail. Toothpicks are not
j worn between the teeth of thoughtful
| spectators."
Here is an excerpt from a chapter
on dancing—"People who do not dance
well should not inflict themselves on
others at a dance. It is better not to
dance at all, and to make one's self
agreeable in some other way than to
leave a trail of partners feeling one
j is hopeless."
Advice to girls—"A girl owes it to
! her partner to look just as attractive
| as she can, and to be a model of per
fect and charming behavior, so that he
I will be proud of her."
And this next choice sentence is to
aid in the selection of a partner for
the Prom —"Practically every girl in
college is good-looking, well-dressed,
and vivacious."
On the choice of a masquerade cos
l tume —"If a girl is slender and goes
[as a shepherd youth or a page, she is
reminiscent of 'As You Like It' and
'Twelfth Night,' and the poetic thought
helps her along, but she had better
| get an honest appraisal from her
friends (and enemies) before attempt
