# COST OF REGISTRATION LOWEST AT TEXAS U.
## 
### 
Statistics have been compiled by I
the University of Texas giving a state
ment of the fees charged in the sev- i
eral state universities. The figures as
compiled from the catalogues of the
various institutions are for a nine
month session.
An accurate comparison of the vari-'
oua fees is difficult because of the ah
sence of uniformity in applying the
fees. The fees range from $75 for the
University of Texas as the average
low to $lno for the University of
Maine as the average high.
