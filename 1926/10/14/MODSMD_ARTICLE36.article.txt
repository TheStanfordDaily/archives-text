# BERESFORD COUNTRY CLUB WILL BE SITE FOR GOLF TOURNEY
## 
### 
Through the courtesy of its officers,
the Beresford Country Club, located
about one mile this side of San Mateo
on the state highway, has been se
cured for play between Monday, Octo
ber 18, and Friday, October 22, dur
ing which time the University golf
tournament will be run off. This is
open to all students who have signed
up for the tourney and they may play
off their rounds any time between the
two dates with the exception of Wed
nesday morning, October 20.
Entrants must turn in their score
cards immediately after the rounds,
which will consist of 36 holes, medal
play. There will be someone in charge
every day after 1 o'clock to whom
cards may be handed. It is understood
that no student will be allowed the use
of the clubhouse.
The entrants in the tournament will
be divided into three or four groups,
depending on the number of men who
turn out. Each group will be arranged
according to the handicap of the play
ers and prizes will be awarded to the
winner and runner-up of each group
besides the winner of the low gross
and his runner-up in the entire tour
ney.
This tournament is expected to give
a good line on the relative merits of
the University rnashie-wielders and
the winner will be the University 1
champion for the coming year. This is •
especially true of the frosh golfers
about whom little is now known and
those who have not played in Univer- i
sity matches before.
Arrangement for caddies must be :
made by the individual as the supply j
at the Beresford links will be insuf- ;
ficient to accommodate each golfer. !
However, a caddy is not required and j
many of the players will not use them. ■
