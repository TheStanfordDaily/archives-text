, i It was a great day for the sport
I writers of Manchuria when the Stan
) ford baseball team landed in the Far
- East for the three months of duels
- with Chinese nines. Here was oppor
- j tunity to use the racy language of the
112 i diamond, the lingo of the Great Ameri
i can Game. So they did.
[ As the Manchuria Daily News, which
r announces itself as the "only English
s Daily in South Manchuria," idiomati
cally |cally remarked. "How the Manchu
! Club would redeem its honor whittled
• | people's curiosity and the spectators
, ; were in larger crowds, than on the
[ preceding occasion."
i j The account limped a little at times,
however. In the play by play report:
"Stewart went forth by safer between
S.S. and base 3 and forestalled be
tween bases 1 and 2." In the same
game there was a "foul fly by catcher,"
an ingenuous description American
| fans would envy.
One game was called because
j "naughty weather" interfered. "Sacri-
I lice bunds" were frequent. A classi
cally educated reporter interviewed
i coach Wolter and ascertained the fol
lowing: "We hear that none of the
freshmen, juniors, or seniors are al
lowed to take part in the four major
sports." Also this: "The Stanfords
are now extinct after the death of Mr.
I and Mrs. Leland Stanford.".
"When hoped that the visitors would j
give the local teams their very best, j
Mr. Wolter assured our representative '
that they would hold back nothing." j
These quotations are actual excerps 1

i possesion of Tom Quinn, manager of i
the ball team on the tour.
