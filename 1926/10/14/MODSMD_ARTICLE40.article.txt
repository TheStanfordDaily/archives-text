## 
### 
An experimental college plan will
be tried out by the University of
Wisconsin next fall, 250 Wisconsin
students being used as the laboratory.
The present elective system will be
discarded and a relatively fixed se
quence of study planned out by the
professors.
Dr. Glen Frank, youthful president
of the University of Wisconsin, in con
ference with President Coffman and
Dean J. B. Johnston of the University
of Minnesota, stated that the proper
procedure would in two years give the
student an amount of education com
parable to what he now receives in
four. He believes there is too much
tendency to "Fordize" higher educa
tion and that this system is develop
ing microscopic minds. "We are all
the citizens of a runaway world," says
Dr. Frank.
"Student interest in football is
high," he said. "Departmentalize foot
ball like an academic subject, and in
terest would cease. What spectator
would enjoy an exhibition of The For
ward Pass on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday? Or the Art of Punting on
Tuesday and Thursday?
