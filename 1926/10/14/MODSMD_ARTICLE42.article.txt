# GRAVEURE WILLOPEN CONCERT SERIES; HAS HAD VERSATILE LIFE

Louis Graveure, noted baritone, who
will sing in the Stanford Concert
Series on October 28, did not seriously
devote his efforts to singing until com
paratively late in life. He started life
as a student of sculpture; later he
turned his attention to painting,
architecture, and even to building con
struction. His whole life has been
filled with unusual experiences.
Born in Belgium, of Belgian par
ents, Graveure was taken to England
at an early age, and there received his
education. His early attention was
turned to sculpture and architecture,
but it was soon discovered that he
had an exceptionally good basso voice.
However, his career as a singer was
delayed by an illness which destroyed
his voice. He then made a health trip
to Africa where he financed and took
part in an expedition in quest of gold
deposits. But he lost money on this
trip and soon left for Canada.
The trip proved fruitful. Gradually
his voice came back to him, and he
eagerly set about to improve it. By
some queer trick of nature his new
voice was a baritone instead of a
basso as it had formerly been before
his illness. Soon Craveure's extraor
dinary career as a singer of unusual
talent commenced.
In 1915 he first came to the United
States, and since then his name has
been linked with the finest type of j
artistic singing, until at present he is
world-renowned.
