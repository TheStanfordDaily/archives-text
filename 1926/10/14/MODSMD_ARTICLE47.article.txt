# ERNIE NEVERS ENTERS SPORT WRITING FIELD
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers, captain of last year's
football varsity and sporting critics'
choice for all-American fullback, has
entered the field of sport-story writing.
His first of a series of twelve arti-j
cles, written for the NEA Service, ap
peared in yesterday's Palo Alto Times, ;
and in it Nevers denied the myth that j
Pacific Coast football differs greatly .
from the brand played in the eastern |
section of the country. To prove his (
point Nevers quotes the fact that all ;
the leading Pacific Coast football
coaches, including Glenn Warner of
Stanford, received their early training
in the East, and that coaches invar- 1
iably teach football the way they know
it best.
Nevers has just finished the season
playing professional baseball with the
St. Louis Browns of the American
League.
