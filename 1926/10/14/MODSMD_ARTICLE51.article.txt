# COTTRELL OPPOSES DIAGONAL PARKING IN PALO ALTO DISTRICT
## 
### 
"Diagonal parking is not used in any
first-class city on streets as narrow as
i University avenue," asserts E. A. Cot
trcll, professor of Political Science at
Stanford and councilman of Palo Alto,
in objecting to the initiative circulated
among the people of Palo Alto which
requested the city council to install diago
nal instead of parallel parking and which
was approved Monday night by the coun
cil. '
The petition according tc( the city
charter would either have to be acceptcd
by the council or else be put up to a vote
before the people, whose acceptance would
make the law part of the charter and
necessitate if its removal was desired
later a new election.
Professor Cottrell enumerated the cri
ticisms of such a system. In the first
place, diagonal parking requires the driver
to back out in a live stream of traffic
which he cannot see; while if the reverse
system is used, that is, backing the car
into the parking space, the bumper ex
tends into the street and in case of a
rear bumper it extends over the side
walk.
Center parking, another alternative, is
possible in a wide street of a small town,
hut is not practical on a street as small
as University avenue.
Most cities, he says, which have made a
study of the problem are either freeing
their business section entirely from park
ing, as in the eastern cities, or else are
regulating the hours of parking to corre
spond with the hours of heavy traffic, as
in Los Angeles, and he believes in two
years the business men of Palo Alto will
ask to have no parking on University
avenue.
He bases his belief on the experience
of business men in other cities, who have
found that shoppers who come in cars
avoid the congested areas and will either
shop at the newer business centers or
they will park their cars in some garage
or parking space and then will walk to
the stores. This condition is further
shown by the fact that stores in many
of the larger towns furnish lots in which
their patrons may park their cars.
Also business associations have found
that parking in front of stores causes a
financial loss to the stores whose front is
thus blocked, and that these associations
are urging private open landing spaces
before all business houses, such as the
theaters and hotels now have, or abolition
of all parking in such districts.

i University avenue," asserts E. A. Cot
trcll, professor of Political Science at
Stanford and councilman of Palo Alto,
in objecting to the initiative circulated
among the people of Palo Alto which
requested the city council to install diago
nal instead of parallel parking and which
was approved Monday night by the coun
cil. '
The petition according tc( the city
charter would either have to be acceptcd
by the council or else be put up to a vote
before the people, whose acceptance would
make the law part of the charter and
necessitate if its removal was desired
later a new election.
Professor Cottrell enumerated the cri
ticisms of such a system. In the first
place, diagonal parking requires the driver
to back out in a live stream of traffic
which he cannot see; while if the reverse
system is used, that is, backing the car
into the parking space, the bumper ex
tends into the street and in case of a
rear bumper it extends over the side
walk.
Center parking, another alternative, is
possible in a wide street of a small town,
hut is not practical on a street as small
as University avenue.
Most cities, he says, which have made a
study of the problem are either freeing
their business section entirely from park
ing, as in the eastern cities, or else are
regulating the hours of parking to corre
spond with the hours of heavy traffic, as
in Los Angeles, and he believes in two
years the business men of Palo Alto will
ask to have no parking on University
avenue.
He bases his belief on the experience
of business men in other cities, who have
found that shoppers who come in cars
avoid the congested areas and will either
shop at the newer business centers or
they will park their cars in some garage
or parking space and then will walk to
the stores. This condition is further
shown by the fact that stores in many
of the larger towns furnish lots in which
their patrons may park their cars.
Also business associations have found
that parking in front of stores causes a
financial loss to the stores whose front is
thus blocked, and that these associations
are urging private open landing spaces
before all business houses, such as the
theaters and hotels now have, or abolition
of all parking in such districts.
