freshman football team will play but

squad and will work with this set of
men. No further cuts arc contemplated.
The work of the men in Saturday's
game will be watched with interest by
those who arc following freshman foot
hall, as Little Big Game is to be played
in three weeks, on November 5.
The squad has been somewhat handi
capped by injuries this last week. Ralph
Frentrup, star halfback, is at present in
the Palo Alto Hospital. He has water
on the knee, and it is regarded as very
doubtful as to whether or not lie will
J be able to enter the game Saturday at any
time. His absence will be keenly felt, as
he is the most dependable back on the
frshman squad. Laird or Bobdy will be
used in his phice.
Big Hill Burke, tackle, has an ankle
that is slightly out of joint, but this in
jury should not stop him very much Sat
urday. Bush, end, who is also suffering
from a minor injury, is expected to play.
