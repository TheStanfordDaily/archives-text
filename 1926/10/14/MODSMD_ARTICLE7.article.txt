"Discussion among representatives of
forty-five nations concerning the United
States' reservations to its entry into the
World Court was the most interesting
event of my six weeks' stay in Europe
this summer," said Professor Graham H.
Stuart, who recently returned from
abroad, where he served as a member of
the European conference for American
professors of international relations.

The'debate was held during a special
conference in the International Labor j
office just before the meeting of the I
League of Nations.
Professor Stuart was one of the fifty j
American university professors who were I
chosen from all over the United States
to attend this European conference as j
guests of the Carnegie Endowment for j
International Peace. The purpose of the i
conference was to bring the professors of j
international relations into personal touch
with the officials charged with the actual
conduct of international affairs, and the j
cities of Paris, The Hague, and Geneva |
were visited because they are the centers j
of numerous international organizations, i
The attitude of the representatives of j
the members of the World Court was j
friendly, says Professor Stuart, and the j
debate was merely an attempt to find out |
what the United States meant by its five !
reservations. The fifth reservation, ac-!
cording to the Stanford professor, was |
the only one debated at length, and that:
was in regard to the clause which stated j
that the World Court could not hand:
down an advisory opinion on any subject |
in which the United States had or claimed i
an interest. As the Canadian delegate j
put it, "Might not the whole system of I
granting advisory opinions be subject to j
a veto of the United States Senate, and,;
considering the fact that the Senate is j
not in session constantly and works rather {
slowly at times, would it not completely j
handicap this very useful function of the j
World Court ?"
"But even so," says Professor Stuart,
"the reservations were accepted complete
ly in principle, the only restriction being
a proviso that if it was found that the
effectiveness of the Court was weakened
by the entrance of the United States
under these concjitions, the members re
served the right to withdraw their ac
ceptance by a two-thirds vote. This was
the more legitimate in that the United
States reserved the right to withdraw
from the Court at any time."
With regard to Germany's entrance to
the League, Professor Stuart says the
representatives of the various nations
were most cordial in their assent to her
entrance and the vote was unanimous to
admit her.
