# TWO RECEIVE LIGHT SENTENCES; END OF LENIENT PENALTIES
## 
### 
At a special meeting of the Men's
Council held yesterday afternoon to con- i
sider violations of the Honor Code in
the final examinations last spring, two!
sentences were given covering dismissal |
from the University for one quarter or
an alternative of fifteen hours' work at
the Convalescent Home. Both of the men
convicted chose the work.
Merril Armour, chairman of the coun-'
I
cil, stated last night that this is the last!
time such a decision will be made in
regard to violations of the Honor Code.
The leniency given to the two men in
this case was because their offenses were j
committed prior to the adoption of the i
pledge.
"Under the plan adopted this year,"!
Armour said, quoting the unanimous opin
ion of the council, "those found guilty
of breaking their pledges will be dropped
from Stanford without recourse."
