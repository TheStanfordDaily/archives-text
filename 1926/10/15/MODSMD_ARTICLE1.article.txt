# PEACE CANNOT BE KEPT WITH ARMED FORCE
## League Must Be Place for Adjustments Claims Doctor Jordan DR. ELIOT COMMENDED Says Harvard Ex-President Was Greatest Man of This Generation 
### 
"The League of Nations must give
up the idea of trying to keep peace with
armed force," said L)r. Jordan at his
first Thursday Evening Conference last
night. "In the future the League must
be a place for adjustments, much as the
Supreme Court of the United States is
now."
In his discussion of "Hope at Ge
neva," Dr. Jordan continued by saying
that "the League is beginning to realize
that it has to give up hope of putting
■"teeth' into its decisions. This was one
•of the most significant developments of
the Geneva Conference."
Cannot Enforce Peace
Commenting on this idea, Dr. Jordan
believes that "peace was never enforced
in any country. It never has been en
forced and never can be enforced."
"Peace can be maintained," continued
Dr. Jordan, "only if the countries them
selves want it, and in the long run the
teachers of the world will do more good
in the interests of peace than the League
of Nations can.
"After 1922 people began to realize
that they couldn't live on hate and en
mity. They found that the war atroci
ties were largely lies formulated by pro
fessional patriots." According to Dr.
Jordan the results of the Geneva Con
ference show a continued growth of that
■desire for universal peace.
Lauds Dr. Eliot
In his lecture Dr. Jordan also gave his
personal reminiscences of the life of the
late Dr. Eliot of Harvard University,
•characterizing him as "the greatest man
•of the United States in our generation."
Discussing Dr. Eliot's early work at
Harvard, Dr. Jordan continued, "He rev
olutionized the curriculum of Harvard
University, abolishing practically all re
quired subjects and allowing the stu
dents to choose their own courses."
In conclusion Dr. Jordan said, "Dr.
Eliot was a really great man who gave
liis attentions to the welfare of the
whole world."
