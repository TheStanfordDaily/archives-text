# STARVING STANFORD STUDENTS SUCCORED BY SALE OF SINKERS
## 
### 
Doughnuts! Doughnuts! Dough
nuts! Theta Sigma Phi, women
journalists, will help the campus
eradicate that empty between
class feeling when today at 8
o'clock, thirty dozen sizzling
sinkers, powdered and plain, will
go on sale in front of the Wo
men's Clubhouse. According to
the custom they will sell for a
nickel apiece, the hole thrown in.
These sales stand as the last
Stanford tradition that has never
been questioned by Scalpers, or
freshmen. Today is the first op
portunity of the year the campus
has had to support it! The hot
test ones sell first! Dough nut
fail to be there!
