# IDEAS ON FOOTBALL SHOW SOLICITED BY GENERAL COMMITTEE
## Plans for Sketches, Songs Will Be Submitted at Meeting Next Week 
### 
Those who have sketches, songs, or
dances, or ideas for sketches, songs, or
dances, or who have suggestions of any
sort applicable for a vaudeville show,
are asked by Delmer Daves, president,
to meet in the Assembly Hall with the
general committee of the coming Foot
ball Show between 3 and 5 o'clock next
Wednesday and Thursday, October 20
and 21.
"The Football Show is the most rep
resentative show of the year," said Gor
don Davis at a meeting of the show
committee last night, "and it is essential
that all who have any possible talent for
the production of a show of this sort
make themselves heard next Wednesday
and Thursday afternoons."
Short Skits Planned
It was decided by the committee, com
posed of members of Ram's Head So
ciety and representatives from dramatic
and publications organizations, that in
general this year's show will use as a
model that of last year. A series of
short skits, without any particular at
tempt at continuity, are planned.
A number of individuals have already
signified their intention of working up
acts to submit in the competition for
final selection. Two jazz orchestras have
offered their services, as well as a num
ber of stars from former shows. Letters
are being prepared asking suggestions
from alumni prominent for their interest
in campus dramatics.
G. Hall Directs Music
Gordon Hall, assistant musical direc
tor of Ram's Head Show last winter,
was selected by the committee to direct
the musical side of the show. Hall is
beginning by collecting the necessary
original music, and asks that all who
are musically inclined get in touch with
him at once at Palo Alto 1102. Senti
mental and comic songs, and a feature
football song, as well as arrangements
of incidental popular music, are particu
larly wanted by Hall.
Satirical one-act plays, skits, sketches,
dialogue acts, and specialty numbers are
wanted by the committee. These are not
to exceed twenty minutes staging time.
People having an idea for any sort of a
clever number are requested to put it in
written form and hand it to any mem
ber of the committee or leave it with
Gordon Davis, Room 203, English Build
ing. Dancing numbers are included in
this request.
New Talent Sought
Participation in the Football Show is
open to everybody except freshmen
women, and does not keep those who
take part from appearing in another Fall
Quarter poduction. Freshmen men and
transfers are urged to tun out and bring
ideas that have worked successfully in
other schools, as well as original sugges
tions.
"Last year's Football Show was the
best vaudeville show I have ever seen,"
said Gordon Davis. "We have an op
portunity in the available talent on the
campus to make it even better this year."
