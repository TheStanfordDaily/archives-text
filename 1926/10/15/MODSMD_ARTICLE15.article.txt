# REVIEW SETS FORTH PROBLEM OF LOWER DIVISION ELIMINATION
## President Wilbur Gives His Views on Subject of Undergraduate Ban 
### 
Discussion of the advisability of
eliminating underclassmen from the
University is the main feature of the
October issue of the Stanford Illus
trated Review, which will appear on
the campus Monday morning.
President Wilbur has contributed an
article giving his views on the subject.
He contends that evolution in educa
tion is making it necessary for the
universities of the country to con
centrate on higher instruction, and
that the elimination of underclassmen
would be a progressive step if Stan
ford wishes to develop with the rest
of the world.
The report from the Board of Direc
tors of the Alumni Association by
Hubert H. Hall, '04, retiring president
of the organization, is in the nature of
a plea to keep the underclassmen at
Stanford. It is a summary of the atti
tude of the Stanford alumni compiled
from answers to a questionnaire sent
out to all organized alumni groups.
An added feature of this issue is
the announcement of a $25 prize to
be offered each month by the manage
ment of the magazine for any article
by any student or alumnus on any
subject of interest to Stanford people
which is submitted and printed.
"No other alumni magazine has ever
done anything like this to foster writ
ing among students and alumni," says J
Professor E. W. Smith. "I consider it |
a splendid idea and a precedent which I
might well be followed by similar
publications."
Articles on the experiments made
by Dr. Harris J. Ryan in the recently
established high voltage laboratory,
and on the Rurbank Foundation, for
which $1,000,000 must be raised, re
veal the splendid achievements of and i
possibilities for scientific research in !
the University.
Republication is also made of an
article from the Theatre Magazine dis- ;
cussing at considerable length and in
very praiseworthy terms the accom
plishments of Gordon Davis in Stan- ;
ford Dramatics.
"New Faces in the Faculty" and an
article on football by Fred Speers,
night editor of the Stanford Daily,
complete the literary contributions to
the October issue of the Review.
