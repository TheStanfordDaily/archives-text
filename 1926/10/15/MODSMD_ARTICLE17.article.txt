# PACK COAST GRIDIRON FANS TRAIN EVES ON NEVADA CONTEST
## Hoffman Still on Injured List, Probably Will Not Play NEW LINEMEN WILL START Wolf Pack Composed of Veterans Anxious to Beat Cards 
### Jim Adams 
FofW)wers of coast football will all
have their eyes trained on the Stan
ford stadium tomorrow afternoon when
the Cards meet the Wolfpack from
Nevada, to see whether Pop Warner's
football team has recovered from its
slump or not. Warner will endeavor to
put the Redshirts back in stride by
starting a revised lineup.
New Men Start
From the left guard to the right
tackle a new set of linemen will start
their first varsity game. Kazanjian
will replace Captain Swan who is still
laid up with a bad foot, Yermilya will
be at center, Symonds and Sellman
will fill the right guard and tackle
positions, respectively.
Hoffman is still on the injured list
and probably will not play at all.
Patchett will start at the fullback
berth. Hyland and Sims are the halves
that Warner has selected and Post
will call signals. This combination of
halfbacks will be something new, but
on the showing of each in practice and
in the last game, the two ought to
make a good pair of ground-gainers.
Hyland got away for seme good runs
in the Olymuic Club game, while Sims
played a steady all around game and
put over the touchdown that won the
contest.
No Loafing Tomorrow
At the first appearance of any one
loafing tomorrow Warner will undoubt
edly send in someone to relieve him.
Four former substitutes have their
opportunity on the line to break into
the first-string lineup and it can be
expected that they will put up a good
fight to meet the qualifications. The
other three regulars will in turn have
to be on their toes for Pop has just
as many substitutes on the bench who
will be seeking a like chance for a
permanent berth.
One week of hard practice should
have ironed out the raggedness and
listlessness of last week's exhibition.
A smoother offense, better interfer
ence, less penalties and a fighting lino
are the improvements that can be
expected of tomorrow's eleven.
No Set-Up
The Cardinals will have no set-up
in Nevada because the Wolfpack is
a well-coached team, composed largely
of veterans. In weight the two elevens
are on a par. Nevada has won every
game this season and comes south
with the hope of catching Stanford in
a slump and to continue their list of
victories.
