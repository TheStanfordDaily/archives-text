# "Hashing"
## 
### 
For about the sixth time in as many years the unpleasant question
of whether freshmen should hash in fraternity houses is being discussed.
The Interfraternity Board of Control expects to make a final and
definite decision on the problem at its next meeting.
Many freshmen come to the University forced to secure work of
some kind and the most convenient is hashing. To one way of thinking
it seems unfair that any job that a first-year man could handle should be
withheld for older men. Jobs are much harder to find when a man is
new to the campus.
But on the other hand "freshman hashing" is unfair to the idea
behind the present rushing rules. No one denies that having freshmen
at the house three times a day is not a great aid to the fraternity when
the season opens in the spring. The house is not allowed to choose the
freshman they want under the present circumstances; it must take the
one the appointment office sends. A year ago there were six first-year
men hashing in fraternity houses, and out of the six only two pledged
the houses in which they were working.
There is a possibility, that if the freshman waiter keeps his eyes open
during his period in the house, he will never think of "going" that house.
It is sometimes hard to make a good impression on a smart freshman
even during the short dinner date that is allotted to rushing in the spring.
Think how much more difficult it would be for a fraternity to have to
be on good behavior for two whole quarters.
Looking at the other side of the question, the fraternity's one idea
in having freshman hashers is to try to later take the men into the house;
that is, if-they are suitable. The majority of the houses that hire the
yearlings send several of their own members out to hash elsewhere. It
would certainly be much more simple if the fraternity men would wait on
their own tables, and let the freshmen have the jobs that the fraternity
men now hold.
One sure thing is no matter what action is finally taken, everyone
can't be satisfied. Either the alumni, the fraternity that hirps freshmen,
the fraternity that does not hire freshmen, or the freshmen, are going
to be disappointed.
