# Last Chance
## 
### 
Today a sign might well be hung tip down by Encina gym reading:
"Last Chance Today—Start Howling Tomorrow." A final edict issued
by the Board of Athletic Control notifies all interested that after this
date no one will be able to file applications for Big Game tickets.
Every ticket for the event is sold and there are some applications
from the public that will never be filled. But the Board is waiting until
the student applications are all in before tickets will be issued. Conse
quently, there is not a chance of buying a pasteboard, especially rooters'
tickets, after five this afternoon.
It is a matter for speculation—just how long it will be before someone
finds that he is without a ticket and proceeds to sob around about it.
