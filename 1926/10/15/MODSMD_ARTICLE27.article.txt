# SPORTS OF 1926
## Tomorrow's Titbits 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
To the football fan —and who isn't a football fan these days?—tomorrow
brings with it a most attractive assortment of interesting and exciting games.
October 16 is the first date of the season when a whole flock of big battles
are scheduled, and tickets are at a premium for at least half a dozen of the
contests listed above.
Chief interest usually centers on intersectional games, but although the
Ohio State-Columbia, Penn-Chicago, and Penn State-Notre Dame battles have
aroused the neighbors' children to a state closely approaching insanity, in
some ways the Yale-Dartmouth game will be the most important of all. These
two schools, it will be recalled, met in 1924 and a 14 to 14 tie resulted, many
claiming that Dartmouth failed to win because Eddie Dooley tried to carry
the ball over the line himself after calling someone else's signal. At any rate,
Dooley will have a chance to redeem himself this year, and Yale will be
fighting to regain the prestige she lost in 1925. Dartmouth hasn't lost a game
since Cornell beat her in 1923.
Ohio State beat Columbia 9 to 0 in their game last year, and now Coach
Wilce brings his team to New York to try to make it two in a row. The
work of Marty Karow, the Ohio State star, will be watched with great interest
in this contest.
in 1925, Notre Dame and Penn State played a scoreless tie. Anything
may happen when two such gridiron magicians as Knute Rockne and Hugo
Bezdek match wits. Pennsylvania beat a rather weak Chicago team 7 to 0
last year, and this time Stagg's men should make a better showing. Princeton
is out to sink the Navy for having the nerve to tie Old Nassau in their last
game. The Army and Syracuse did not meet in 1925.
In the Big Ten Conference, Minnesota and Michigan, and Northwestern
and Indiana play the first of their "double-headers." The Illinois-lowa game
is once more a battle of wits between Coach Zuppke and his former pupil,
Bert Ingwersen. There is no far western game that will worry the "Big Four"
of the Pacific Coast Conference much, but in the South two of the most
important teams meet when Alabama battles Georgia Tech., with last year's
stars, Hubert and Wycoff, both missing.
