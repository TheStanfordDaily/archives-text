# Institute Formulates New Rainfall Prediction Law
## 
### 
A law whereby the seasonal rain
fall can be predicted from studying
ocean temperatures has been formu
lated by the University of California
Scripps Institute of Oceanography at
La Jolla. It has been found that in
seven out of nine cases a summer sea
son of low water temperatures was
followed by a winter of heavy rainfall.
This discovery is particularly im
portant to power companies and irriga
tions interests throughout the state,
and it is also of vital importance to
farmers.
