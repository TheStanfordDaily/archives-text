# BABE SOCCER SQUAD PLAYS RAGGEDLY TO TIE PESCADERO HIGH
## 
### 
Displaying a ragged offense, marked
only by the brilliant playing of ex
perienced individuals, the Stanford
freshman soccer team played through
to a scoreless tie yesterday afternoon
with Pescadero high school's prep
kickers.
Though teamwork on the part of
the yearling players was never at a
very high standard, the work of the
forwards during the first half of the
game put the Cards in position for
several unsuccessful attempts to score.
Wong, speedy center forward, and
Borden, inside left, took the ball down
for a tally early in the game, but the
count was not allowed by Coach Harry
Maloney, referee, because Stanford
bad too many men on the field.
Pescadero Forces Play
Pescadero forced the play of the
second period, and it was only through
the consistent goal work of Robinson,
tender, that the coast-side aggregation
was held scoreless. The defensive tac
tics of Christenson, left full, and of
Lemmon, right full, was commended
by varsity players watching the con
test.
The injury of two Pescadero for
wards lightened momentarily the work
of the yearling backs, but it was only
occasionally that the halves were able
to carry the offensive play into Pesca
dero territory for the linemen. The
frosh eleven took slight advance of
the high school players' lack of de
fense in the second half in advancing
the ball goalward, but again the lack
of teamwork broke up the scoring.
The lineup of the '30 squad: Wilson,
0.1.; Borden, i.1.; Wong, c.; O'Donnell,
1.r.; Jennings, 0.r.; Springer, 1.h.; W.
Smith, c.s.; Mayer, r.m.; Christenson,
1.f.; Lemmon, r.f.; Robinson, g. Sub
stitutions: Keefe, Adler, Hartzell, Mul
lin, Frost.
