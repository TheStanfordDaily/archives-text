# INJURIES HANDICAP FRESHMEN IN GAME WITH SACRAMENTO
## Nearly Every Man on First String Is Affected by Series of Hurts 
### Joe Carroll 
Tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 o'clock
the Stanford freshman football team
will play the Sacramento Junior Col
lege outfit as a preliminary to the
Varsity-Nevada struggle. The babes
will enter the game seriously handi
capped by injuries to nearly every
member of the first-string lineup. The
real problem that faces Coach Husky
Hunt is the shifting of his backfield so
that he will be able to get the most
possible power from any combination
"iat he is able to use.
With the Little Big Game only three
weeks in the future, the men are due
for some intensive work. But this
work is limited because so many men
are under doctor's care, and also be
cause the freshmen are scrimmaging
with the varsity in an attempt to aid
the varsity to find itself for the sea
son. If the freshman squad was in a
position to continue its improvement
in the next three weeks as they have
since the beginning of the season, a
really great yearling football team
may be looked for. But injuries have
kept the men practically at a stand
still for the past week.
Creditable Showing
When the record of the freshmen so
far this season is looked into closely,
it must be realized that they have
turned in a very creditable showing.
They have played some tough games
and have won them all. St. Marys
freshmen and San Mateo Junior Col
lege are both good teams.
Ralph Frentrup, halfback, may not
be in the game Saturday, because of
a bad knee. In case Coach Hunt is not
able to use him, he will have to vary
his backfield combination. If Hodby
starts at full, Laird will go to half. If
Simpkins plays full, Dowling will play
half. Hodby or Dowling will do the
punting.
Coach Hunt said that he did not
know of a single man on the first
string who is not at present handi
capped by some injury. He adds that
there has been no opportunity in the
past week for any development, but
that he hopes to be able to do some
intensive training next week.
