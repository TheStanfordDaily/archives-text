Clever cuts —fine quality pure wool mixtures—woven
into plaids, checks, and small unconventional patterns.
Just the colors one likes for Fall such as browns, blues, "
and other dark mixed colors that are best for service.
And yet in these coats nothing has been sacrificed that
would take from the style or quality. Wolf and fox
collars make them ideal for all-round wear for street
or machine. The price is absolutely right at $29.50 ea.
