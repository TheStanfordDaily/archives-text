# STANFORD TO DEVELOP NEW AIR RESEARCH
## Professor Lesley Named Aerodynamics Head On Campus AIR TUNNEL PLANNED University Will Receive $300,000 Annually For 10 Years 
### 
World leadership in aeronautical ex
periments will be undertaken by Stan
ford University when the aerodynam
icc laboratory is established in a new
concrete structure to be completed be
fore the end of the present year. The
new laboratory, which will operate
under a Stanley Guggenheim endow
ment fund of $45,000 plus the income
on $300,000 for ten years, will expand
its airplane research to include every
field of experiment within the range
of laboratory work.
Lesley Heads Experts
Professor Everett P. Lesley, former
head of the mechanical engineering
department at Stanford, has been ap
pointed head of the new laboratory.
He will be assisted by two other ex
perts to be appointed by the first of
the year. They will co-operate in con
ducting the experiments, as will Dr.
William F. Durand, member of the
President's Air Board.
Work will start immediately on the
installation of the present equipment
in the new buildiug, a large concrete
structure formerly housing the Pat
tern ship. A giant air tunnel, carrying
wind capacity equal to a tornado, is to
be erected on the floor of the labora
tory, so that tests can be made of all
types of propellers, airplane structure
and motor power.
Propeller Tests Begun
Early this year the Stanford labora
tory began a series of tests to deter
mine the efficiency of various types of
airplane propellers for the Federal
government. Investigations along these
lines have brought world recognition
to local men.
Other centers of airplane research
work are at New York University, the
Massachusetts Institute of Techno
logy, the University of Michigan,
Langley Field, Virginia, and the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology. The
latter school was also given a Gug
genheim endowment recently.
