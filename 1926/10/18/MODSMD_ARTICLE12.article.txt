# PROFESSOR STUART TO DISCUSS RECENT DIPLOMATIC CHANGES
## American Professors Attend League Assembly, All Council Sessions 
### 
Professor Graham H. Stuart of the
Political Science department will lec
ture on "Recent Developments at
Geneva" in the Little Theatre at 7:30
o'clock tomorrow night. He recently
returned from a six weeks' stay in
Europe where he was sent as a mem
ber of the European conference for
American professors of International
Relationn.
During a recent interview while
speaking of the conduct of the ses
sions of tne council and assembly of
the League of Nations, Professor
Stuart, who was admitted to every
meeting of the forty-first council and
to each session of the seventh assem
bly, says that the fact that each speech
made by a League member is immedi
ately translated tends to cut down on
oratory, eliminating "hot air" speak
ing.
Four conferences were given while
the American professors were on the
boat going to Europe, Professor Stuart
conducting a conference on the Secre
tariat of the League. Professor Stuart
also delivered an answering address
to a speech of welcome given to the
American professors by the President
of the University of Leyden in Hol
land. Leyden is the site from which
American pilgrims started on their
journey first to England and then to
America.
"The Department of International
Labor Legislation does one of the big
gest things of the League, cooperation
is good, and the Labor branch is more
international than the League," de- j
clared Professor Stuart.
The Labor Legislation Building at
Geneva, where the League meets, is
the first international building. The
League of Nations recently opened
competition for plans for a two and a
half million dollar structure.
