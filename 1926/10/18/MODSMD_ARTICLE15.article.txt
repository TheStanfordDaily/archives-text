# FOUR TEAMS REMAIN IN COMPETITION FOR CONFERENCE HONORS
## Idaho, California Pushed Out of Grid Lead Saturday 
### 
Two more Pacific Coast Conference
| football teams allowed themselves to
! be pushed out of the race Saturday
: afternoon, and there are only four un
beaten squads in the league. These
! four are Washington, U.S.C., 0.A.C.,
I and Stanford. The Aggies and Wash
j ington have two conference victories
| each, U.S.C. has one, and the Cardinals
I have played only non-conference teams
to date, so their record is clear on
both sides.
Washington, the Aggies, and Wash
ington State turned in conference vic
tories Saturday. The Huskies downed
Charlie Erb's Idaho squad by a 26 to
0 score, the Beavers walloped Cali
fornia 27 to 7, and the Cougars nosed
out Montana 14 to 6. Stanford beat
Nevada 33 to 9, and the Trojans won
from Occidental 28 to 6 in non-confer
ence games, and Oregon, the ninth
member of the circuit, was idle.
For sensational football it is doubt
ful if there was a better game no the
coast than the one staged in the
California Memorial Stadium between
the Bruins and a mighty aggregation
of Oregon Aggies. The northerners
came down regarded as one of the
strongest teams in the Northwest and
showed a brilliant running attack that
I made it easy for the fans to see why
they were rated among the leaders.
Schulmerich Stars
Big Wes Schulmerich, the stellar
performer in the Aggie backfield, was
not in the best of shape so he was
not called on to carry the ball very
much, but Maple, Luby, and Jarvis
packed the pigskin up and down the
field like All-Coast men. The Aggie
line outcharged the Bears, and, all in
all, the warriors from Corvallis looked
as though they were in line for a very
successful season. The Bears, on the
other hand, did not show any too
much power, and it appears that they
are in for two or three more beatings
before the season ends.
Washington Powerful
Washington was too big and power
ful for Idaho. The Huskies made 305
yards from sorimmage against the
Vandals, Harold Patton leading the
attack with a total of 108 yards to his
credit. He scored two of the touch
downs made by his team. Idaho was
unable to make any long gains against
last year's champs and went through
for only two first downs during the
matinee.
Washington State carried too much
power for Montana and won by a mar
gin of one touchdown. Wild Bill Kelly, I
of course, made the lone score for the
Grizzlies, thus saving them from being
whitewashed.
Stanford Revives
Stanford seemed to come to life in
the second half of the game against
Nevada, and after trailing at half time, (
the Cards opened a speedy attack that
swept the invaders before it. The team
played poorly in the first half, very j
poorly in fact, but the final quarters 1
saw them getting back into their old
form; from now on it may be a dif
ferent story. At least, it looks as
though the boys have found them-1
selves.
The Trojans, by beating Oxy by a
three-touchdown margin, did the same
as Stanford against them. The Cards
won from them two weeks ago by a
score of 19 to 0, while U.S.C. beat 1
them 28 to 6.
Next Saturday's conference calls for j
Stanford to meet Oregon at Eugene,
U.S.C. to play the Bears at Berkeley,
and Washington State to lock horns
with Washington at Seattle. The Ag- :
gies, Montana, and Idaho do not play
conference rivals that afternoon.
