# CARDS PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL TO DEFEAT NEVADA VARSITY
## Wolfpack Loses Game When Cardinals Rally, Wrest Victory Away HYLAND GOES THROUGH Reno Team Gives Way To Determined Pounding Of Redshirts 
### Jim Adams 
In a sixty-minute game the Cards
played thirty minutes of good enough
football to roll Nevada under a 33-9
j score Saturday in the Stanford sta
dium. In the first half the Wolfpack
took advantage of the Redshirts* mis
, cues and took a 9-0 lead. Between
halves Warner said a few words and
; the Cards came back to the field to
I play football, which they did to the
i satisfaction of every Stanford spec
| tator.
Five touchdowns and three subse
! quent field goals was the total the
Cardinals hung up in the last half.
Stanford started the game out with a
i punch that promised much. They made
; two threatening advances into the
Wolfpack's territory. The first ended
when they failed to make downs on
j the - 30-yard line and the second wound
| U P with Murphy failing to kick a field
goal from the 34-yard line.
Nevada Scores Safety
Nevada took the ball and advanced
by well-executed runs and deceptive
i passes to Stanford's 5-yard line where
j Hill stopped their march by intercept
! 'ng Lawson's pass. On the next play
I McCreery passed the ball over Mur
| phy's head when the latter was at
tempting to punt from behind his goal
I line and Murphy recovered for a
[ 2-point credit to Nevada on a safety.
Murphy dropped the ball in the sec
ond quarter on a pass from Patchett
on a criss-cross play and Pierce
scooped it up to race 50 yards for a
touchdown after Murphy had dived
and missed him by inches. Hyland
fumbled a punt a little later which
was recovered by Anderson on the
Card 15-yard line, but Poulson inter
cepted a pass as the half ended and
nothing disastrous resulted.
The second half was a very differ
ent story. It was all Stanford. Hyland
started the first parade by returning
the kickoff 35 yards. Then runs by
Hill and Hyland followed and the
Cards advanced to the 26-yard line
aided by a penalty when Shipkey was
interfered with while receiving a pass.
Another similar penalty was bestowed
a few plays later on Hyland's pass
to Shipkey over the goal line and the
referee gave the ball to the Cards on
the 1-yard line where Joseph bucked
it over.
Hyland Breaks Loose
Then touchdown followed touchdown
instead of fumble following fumble.
Hyland broke loose for the second,
four minutes later after McCreery had
recovered Lawson's fumble of a punt
on the 23-yard line. This time Hyland
converted to give the Cards a 13-9
lead at the end of the third quarter.
Nevada tired under the heavy
pounding and Warner sent in fresh
men to keep the assault going. Ship
key went over for the third touchdown
at the start of the last quarter on an
end around play after runs by Sims
and Hyland had put the ball on the
13-yard line. Sims missed goal.
Bogue, who relieved Joseph at full
back, made the next score following a
25-yard run by Sims. A pass, Bogue to
Price, and runs by Sims and Wilton,
advanced the ball to the 14-yard line.
A 5-yard penalty and another end
around play with Price carrying the
ball put the Cards on the 1-yard line
where Bogue bucked it over for the
fifth touchdown. As the game ended
Stanford was still headed toward an
other touchdown.
Cards Stop Fumbling
The start of the second half may be
the turning point in the career of the
Cardinal eleven. They stopped fum
bling and executed their plays as they
should be executed.
Why the first period was not so
fruitful might be answered in the one
word "fumbles." Stanford opened the
game with the same punch they
showed in the second half but fumbles
soon took all the wind out of their
sails. It is enough to dishearten any
team to work the ball, down the field
and then fumble.
The second half proved what Stan
ford can do if they just play football.
The steam is there ready to drive the
steam roller unless someone prema
turely opens the safety valve with a
fumble. The line was strong and ag
gressive. Poulson was on his toes,
fighting every minute, and the two
guards, Captain Swan, and Robesky,
played the high-class ball of which
they are capable. Shipkey was himself
at end, which speaks well enough for
him.
Hyland, Sims, and Hill played sensa
tional football. The former was a
streak every time he had hold of the
ball and well portrayed his nickname,
"Tricky Dick." As for Sims and Hill,

they both played hard, driving foot
ball. Hill was especially strong on the
defense and Sims showed unexpected
shiftiness in an open field. Post played
the best defensive game he has played
this year.
Nevada had a well-coached, fighting
team, but they couldn't stand up under
the heavy fire of the Cards. Captain
Allen was all he was claimed to be
and his punts averaged well around
50 yards. On the line Pierce and An
derson played aggressive ball follow
ing the ball closely to take advantage
of all the Cards' fumbles.
