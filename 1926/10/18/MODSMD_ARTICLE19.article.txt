# Three Houses Give Teas For New Stanford Women
## 
### 
Kappa Alpha Theta, Alpha Phi, and
Sigma Kappa were at home to all new
women yesterday afternoon from 4 to
6. In order to avoid confusion, groups
were formed at Roble, and followed
a definite order of progression.
This is the first of a series of teas
to be given this quarter by the soror
ity houses in honor of the new women.
