# The 						Lodge

### 
This week sees the beginning of a series of projects to raise money
for the proposed Stanford Women's Lodge. This building, as yet an
aircastle, promises to take on a more definite structure before the end
of the year if the united efforts of the women students under the leader
ship of the Women's Athletic Association are successful.
This lodge is purposed to serve as a center for the physical activities
and recreation of the women here. The need for some such place is
acute in the absence of adequate gymnasium buildings and athletic fields.
The first financial enterprise to be launched is the selling of subscrip
tions to the Illustrated Review on the campus, the women receiving a
generous share of the subscription price. This magazine, commonly
thought of as for alumni only, will bear investigation. Students will find
it of general interest containing well-written, generously-illustrated arti
cles on University affairs such are are found in no other publication on
the campus at the present time. News notes of graduates and former
students are frequently of as much interest to students as to alumni.
All this goes to prove that the Illustrated Review deserves a campus
circulation. But, most of all, the Stanford women deserve aid in their
worthy enterprise. A subscription will help. â€”A.M.B.
