# An Opportunity
## 
### 
The general committee in charge of producing the 1926 Football Show
meets Wednesday to hear any suggestions for staging the show that
anybody would care to make. Nothing is formal about the meeting, no
finished acts will go on the stage, nothing is wanted by the committee
but ideas and clever, stageable suggestions.
Regardless in what stage of development your idea is, bring it
around and be heard. Gordon Davis, who will direct the show, is of
the opinion that an unusually fine crop of talent, capable T)f writing and
producing a first-class vaudeville show, is on the campus this year. As
the Football Show is the most truly representative production of the
year in that it offers an opportunity for expression in several branches of
theatrical art, it is particularly essential that the work receive the atten
tion of many rather than a few.
Freshmen and transfers will find work in the show a highly interest
ing way to start their activities on the campus. This opportunity was
never better than it is this year with the show under the direction of
Ram's Head Society.
The committee meets Wednesday and Thursday between 3 and 5
o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
