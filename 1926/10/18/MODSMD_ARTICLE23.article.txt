# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
After having wandered over the
campus at various times in vain ef
forts to find certain streets, I have
decided to take this opportunity to
suggest that some spublic-spirited or
ganization take it upon itself to place
big, secure signs, the kind that Encina
residents can't remove, at all inter
sections on the Stanford campus. At
the same time I would suggest that
all houses be numbered conspicuously.
Being but a mere freshman I have
not yet learned the combination of
the street system here and know that

112 there are many other new students
here equally as unenlightened. Scores
of visitors are on the campus every
day and unless they are supplied with
a. map they, too, have a hard time
finding any definite place but just
have to wander around until they find
the gymnasium, Roble Hall, Encina
I Hall, or any other place they may be
hunting.
It's a mighty one-horse kind of a
, town that doesn't have its streets
i named so people can find out where
they are. Why should we have any
small town characteristics on our
| campus? â€”R.S.S.
