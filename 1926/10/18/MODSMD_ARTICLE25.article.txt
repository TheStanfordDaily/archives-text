"BUTTON, BUTTON, WHO'S GOT
THE BUTTON"
If a freshman at the University of
Southern California is caught break
ing any campus tradition, the Trojan
Knights dab the offender's nose with
indigo ink. When juniors or seniors
see this mark, which denotes insubor
dination, they are privileged to yell
"button." The freshman immediately
drops whatever he is holding and puts
his left hand to the top of his head
and his right hand to the small of his
back, executing a profound bow.

Last Saturday, just a few minutes
before the whistle announced that
Stanford had thoroughly and efficient
ly humbled the University of Nevada,
a student rooter arose and endeavored
to make his way out of the stadium.
Immediately, the air was rent with
bellows of hoi polloi. Theats of torture
and death were mingled with asper
sions upon the personal character of
the traitor. A member of the Rally
Committee stepped into the aisle in
front of the departing student who,
by this time, was red with embarrass
ment. Timidly, the arch criminal
pulled a watch out of his pocket, and
appeared to be explaining that his
presence elsewhere was imperative.
Was the wrath of the masses
abated? It was not. The tumult and
the shouting did anything but die. It
increased and the stigma of "faker"
was added to the insults that had
already been heaped upon the man
who would leave a varsity game before
it was over.
At this critical juncture, the time
keeper fired his gun, utterly crabbing
a prospective lynching bee.

Do you think we are going to de

fend the right of that man to leave
the game whenever he pleased? We
are not. That right is self-evident.
And do you also think that we are
about to belay those raucous indi
viduals who would have meted out
physical punishment to a man who
was simply exercising his rights as
an independent individual? We are
not. #
As a matter of fact, the incident wa3
a manifestation of a strange madness,
the thought of which never fails to
give us an odd, inward glow. It is
called "college spirit"—this strange
madness. And men are inclined to take
it for granted. They are inclined to
dismiss it, upon occasion, as a trivial
thing. Upon the lips of campus politi
cians, it becomes what so many other
fine things have become, upon the lips
of politicians—a hollow phrase. It is
more than this, however —a great deal
more.
It is really good to think, that with
two thousand men and women there
to furnish the varsity more than a
sufficiency of vocal assistance for the
battle that was going on in the dull
heat at the bottom of the stadium,
nearly all of those two thousand be
grudged the loss of a single cheer.
Hardly any of those Stanford rooters
stopped to consider the silliness of the
thing. Hardly anyone stopped to think
that necessity demand that the man
leave.
Instead, each was outraged at the
thought that any Stanford man could
quit before the game was over. Each
was there to police the matter. Each
was there to see that Stanford was
fighting, one hundred per cent, until
the end of the game.
Futile? Of course. Futile, and silly—
even mad. But a fine thing, it was —
the sort of thing that gives to Stan
ford its color and its life.
