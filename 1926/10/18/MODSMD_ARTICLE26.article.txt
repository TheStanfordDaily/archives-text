UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Oct. 14. —An intercollegiate baseball
league to consist of eight university
and college teams in California, is
practically assured for the ensuing
season, according to Coach Carl Zam
loch, University of California diamond
mentor.
The proposed league will consist of
a northern and southern section; with
St. Mary's, Stanford, Santa Clara, and
California competing for the northern
championship, and Occidental, Po
mona, the University of Southern
California, and the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles composing the
southern section. Zamloch further
added that a championship series with
the winners of each section competing
would climax the season's games.
The Bruin coach pointed out that in
the past, college baseball has suffered
due to -the fact that they have been
forced to meet semi-professional and
professional nines, and it is with this
in mind that the proposed league is
being worked out.
The proposition was first brought to
light when Coach Zamloch placed his
plans before the Athletic Council at
the Berkeley institution; which in
turn is to be followed by a meeting
of delegates from all schools included
in the conference, to be held some
time in the near future.
Providing the plans meet with the
approval of the other universities, the
league will be inaugurated during the
1927 season.
