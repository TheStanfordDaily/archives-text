# "HAY FEVER" CAST COMES FROM THROUGHOUT STATE
## 
### 
Assembled again from residences in
all sections of the state, the cast mem
bers of "Hay Fever" will tonight begin
rehearsals for the production of Noel
Coward's light comedy, which will be
presented Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall under the direction of Gor
don Davis.
Tickets for the production, played
for the first time in the West last
summer quarter, will be placed on sale
tomorrow at 1 o'clock at the A.S.S.U.
ticket office in the Old Union, or at
Crandall's in Palo Alto.
Miss Enid Wall, now a student at
the Southern Branch, University of
California, is the latest arrival to com
plete the cast of characters, having
come yesterday from Los Angeles for
the week of rehearsals and the per
formance Friday evening. Miss Wall's
interpretation of the ingenue, Jackie
Coryton, week-end guest at the home
of David Bliss, was one of the most
original and oustanding features of
the summer quarter presentation in
the opinion of San Jose and San Fran
cisco critics.
Patrice Nauman, as Judith Bliss,
the perpetual actress and wife of
David Bliss, a novelist, is again cast
in a part well suited to bring out her
ability as previously shown in "Ace
High," "Fashion," and "Meet the
Wife," Stanford productions of the
past two years. Bliss, although the
father of two children, Simon and

| Sorel, is wholly wrapped up in his
| career, and has retired to his home
in Cockrham, England. There, with
aid of vast quantities of tea, he is
; studying the actions of a modern flap
j per, who is a potential character in
his new novel. J. S. Doron is cast as
the novelist, while Miss Wall will por
; tray the latter role.
Mrs. Bliss also has invited a week
end guest to the Bliss home in the
person of Sandy Tyrrell, a boxer,
played by Frederick Zitkowsky, and
the two children, shifting as usual
without the consent or knowledge of
; their parents, have each invited a
j companion. Miss Norma Seib and
Byron Harvey are cast as the Bliss
J children, with Miss Lucie Bentley of
i "Ride a Cock Horse" and "Dear
Brutus" fame and Raymond Haizlip as
, the two guests. Miss Alberta Yearian
; plays the part of Clara, the maid.
Full opportunity is afforded Coward
■ for the swift pricking repartees and
drolleries with which he excels. The
i life of the eight principal characters
j is soon made miserable and the actress
; and her family are finally left alone
at breakfast as the others return in
| secret to London.
The action for "Hay Fever" takes
1 place in a hall of the Bliss home, a
typical English country house. Leslie
Kiler and his staff have executed the
set, which embodies the latest develop
ments in scene technique.

Miss Enid Wall, now a student at
the Southern Branch, University of
California, is the latest arrival to com
plete the cast of characters, having
come yesterday from Los Angeles for
the week of rehearsals and the per
formance Friday evening. Miss Wall's
interpretation of the ingenue, Jackie
Coryton, week-end guest at the home
of David Bliss, was one of the most
original and oustanding features of
the summer quarter presentation in
the opinion of San Jose and San Fran
cisco critics.
Patrice Nauman, as Judith Bliss,
the perpetual actress and wife of
David Bliss, a novelist, is again cast
in a part well suited to bring out her
ability as previously shown in "Ace
High," "Fashion," and "Meet the
Wife," Stanford productions of the
past two years. Bliss, although the
father of two children, Simon and

| Sorel, is wholly wrapped up in his
| career, and has retired to his home
in Cockrham, England. There, with
aid of vast quantities of tea, he is
; studying the actions of a modern flap
j per, who is a potential character in
his new novel. J. S. Doron is cast as
the novelist, while Miss Wall will por
; tray the latter role.
Mrs. Bliss also has invited a week
end guest to the Bliss home in the
person of Sandy Tyrrell, a boxer,
played by Frederick Zitkowsky, and
the two children, shifting as usual
without the consent or knowledge of
; their parents, have each invited a
j companion. Miss Norma Seib and
Byron Harvey are cast as the Bliss
J children, with Miss Lucie Bentley of
i "Ride a Cock Horse" and "Dear
Brutus" fame and Raymond Haizlip as
, the two guests. Miss Alberta Yearian
; plays the part of Clara, the maid.
Full opportunity is afforded Coward
■ for the swift pricking repartees and
drolleries with which he excels. The
i life of the eight principal characters
j is soon made miserable and the actress
; and her family are finally left alone
at breakfast as the others return in
| secret to London.
The action for "Hay Fever" takes
1 place in a hall of the Bliss home, a
typical English country house. Leslie
Kiler and his staff have executed the
set, which embodies the latest develop
ments in scene technique.
Assembled again from residences in
all sections of the state, the cast mem
bers of "Hay Fever" will tonight begin
rehearsals for the production of Noel
Coward's light comedy, which will be
presented Friday night in the Assem
bly Hall under the direction of Gor
don Davis.
Tickets for the production, played
for the first time in the West last
summer quarter, will be placed on sale
tomorrow at 1 o'clock at the A.S.S.U.
