# Tulane Wakes Interest in Weekly's Advertisements
## 
### 
As a stimulus to the reading of ad
vertisements, "The Tulane Hullaba
loo," the weekly publication at Tulane
University, is offering a five dollar
prize to the student, faculty member,
or alumnus who hands in a complete
list of all the misspelled words in the
advertisements on a certain page of
the paper. *
