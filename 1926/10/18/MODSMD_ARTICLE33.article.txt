# STANFORD GRAYS DECISIVELY DEFEAT SAINTS' RESERVES
## Fumbled Punts, Bonehead Plays Spoil Chances In First Half 
### Bob Sears 
Like the varsity, Coach Hal Davis*
Stanford Grays played rather ragged
football in the first half of their game
Saturday morning with the St. Marys
reserves, but came back in the second
half to score a decisive 25 to 6 victory
in the second period.
Numerous fumbled punts and bone
head plays characterized the Grays'
playing in the first half, one of which
nearly led to a St. Marys score and
another then spoiled all chance of one
almost certain touchdown for Stan
ford. During the half time, though,
Davis gave his speech and the team
looked like a different eleven in the
second period. Coach Pop Warner was
on the sidelines, and perhaps the
realization that he was sizing many
of the men up as next year's varsity
possibilities helped to bring about the
change. At any rate, four touchdowns
were rolled up in short order.
Burton Scores
The first came as a result of a pass
from Burton to Wolfe which placed
the ball on the St. Marys 1-yard line.
Burton took the ball over on the next
play, but Riese failed to convert.
Riese was responsible for the next
touchdown in the most spectacular
play of the game. On the kickoff he
received the ball on his own two-yard
line and dashed 98 yards through the
entire St. Marys team. He was aided
by good interference, but showed
great ability as an open field runner.
He also dashed off several other long
gains during the encounter.
Substitutes Used
Shortly after the second touchdown
Davis began to give his substitutes a
chance and nearly every man on the
squad got into the fray. Reynolds
played a good game in the line at
left tackle, nailing St. Marys' backs
for losses on several occasions. Bur
ton played consistently in the fullback
berth.
The lineup is as follows:
St. Marys Stanford
Buckley LE Antonell
Ackerman LT Reynolds
Sullivan LG Youd
Segetel C Cook
Razetto RG Macabee
Martin RT Stein
Illia RE Relirig
Segunda Q Goodcell
