# "STANFORD FOREVER" MARCH IS PUBLISHED BY STANFORD BAND
## 
### 
Copies of the new Stanford march,
"Stanford Forever," composed by E.
R. Flint, '01, will be placed on sale at
the end of the month. One thousand
copies of the composition have been
published, giving the complete instru
mentation for a full band.
The band purchased the piece last
May, and made a record of it for the
Victor Talking Machine Company.
There are thirty-two clarinets in the
Stanford band this quarter, which,
Professor E. W. Martin, band direc
tor, says, is unusual for a college
organization of this kind. A wealth of
material, he says, was found in the
freshman class, which enabled him
to cut the brass section and add to the
reeds.
Donald G. Marquis is manager of the
organization this year. He has ap
pointed Dan T. Smith assistant man
ager, Lloyd M. Smith, librarian, and
David M. Ehrsam, property man. John
M. Willits is the student leader and
associate director.
