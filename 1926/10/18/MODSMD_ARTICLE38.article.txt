UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Oct. 17. â€”Lee Eisan, mainstay of the
University of California freshman foot
ball squad, was unanimously elected
captain of the yearling squad last
week.
The election of the fighting quarter
back was not a surprise for he easily
has been the outstanding figure for
the first-year men in every contest
they have played. Eisan learned his
football under the tutelage of Coach
Cox, Polytechnic High School, San
Francisco. He was a member of the
Olympic Club team in 1924 and 1925
under Babe Hollingsberry.
