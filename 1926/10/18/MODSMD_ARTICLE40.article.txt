# OIL MARINE SCENES PLANNED FOR NEXT ART GALLERY EXHIBIT
## 
### 
A collection of oil marines by George
S. Colman is to be exhibited at the
Art Gallery commencing next Sunday
and continuing until the end of the
month. This is the first time his work
has appeared in this part of the coun
try.
Colman, a southern Californian, has
spent most of his time painting the
coasts around Newport and Balboa.
Being himself an ardent boatman and
devotee of sea life, he has specialized
in marine studies.
His range of subjects is wide, how
ever, running from the more somber
aspects of the sea to her brighter
moods; and his method of handling
color also shows variety. The misty
gray and gray-blue effects of some of
his works form a well-balanced con
trast to that part of his exhibit in
which the delicate blendings of greens
and mauves predominate.
His studies of old boats and ship
wrecks have received high praise, for
in these works he has caught the
mysterious, wistful quality of his sub
ject. Some of his paintings depict
vessels so shrouded in fog and mist
that they appear dimly like wraitli
ships behind their veils.
Others of his boats, falling to pieces
with age, are densely covered with an
orange rust, which, reflected in the
water below, looks like the end of a
ffaming sunset.
One of the pictures to be exhibited
is his "Mariner," a boat belonging to
John Barrymore which took part in
the Honolulu Regatta.
Another is entitled "Old Slaver."
This ship, originally known as the
"Fremont," was used for the transpor
tation of slaves in the early '50's, was
later consigned to service on this
coast, and eventually went to pieces
off Balboa.
There will also be seen a painting
of the model of "Old Constitution,"
which was recently being "shot" for
the movies in the South. This picture
is popularly called "The Phantom
Ship" because of its misty quality and
huge gray sails.
Mr. Colman, who is staying with his
sister, Mrs. Crandall of Palo Alto, ex
pects to spend several months in this
region, and then continue up the coast,
painting as he goes. A brother, Roy
Colman, also an artist, exhibited his
works at Stanford about a year ago.

gray and gray-blue effects of some of
his works form a well-balanced con
trast to that part of his exhibit in
which the delicate blendings of greens
and mauves predominate.
His studies of old boats and ship
wrecks have received high praise, for
in these works he has caught the
mysterious, wistful quality of his sub
ject. Some of his paintings depict
vessels so shrouded in fog and mist
that they appear dimly like wraitli
ships behind their veils.
Others of his boats, falling to pieces
with age, are densely covered with an
orange rust, which, reflected in the
water below, looks like the end of a
ffaming sunset.
One of the pictures to be exhibited
is his "Mariner," a boat belonging to
John Barrymore which took part in
the Honolulu Regatta.
Another is entitled "Old Slaver."
This ship, originally known as the
"Fremont," was used for the transpor
tation of slaves in the early '50's, was
later consigned to service on this
coast, and eventually went to pieces
off Balboa.
There will also be seen a painting
of the model of "Old Constitution,"
which was recently being "shot" for
the movies in the South. This picture
is popularly called "The Phantom
Ship" because of its misty quality and
huge gray sails.
Mr. Colman, who is staying with his
sister, Mrs. Crandall of Palo Alto, ex
pects to spend several months in this
region, and then continue up the coast,
painting as he goes. A brother, Roy
Colman, also an artist, exhibited his
works at Stanford about a year ago.
