# ART GALLERY WILL EXHIBIT COMMERCE PRINTING SAMPLES
## 
### 
"Printing for Commerce," an ex
hibit assembled and arranged by the
American Institute of Graphic Arts,
will be shown in the Stanford Art
Gallery during the week of October 25
in conjunction with the "Fifty Books
of 1926" exhibit also made up by the
Institute.
This second display of printing other
than bookwork will be brought here
to supplement the "Fifty Books" ex
hibit by showing samples of commer
cial printing of high quality. Presses
whose work appears among the "Fifty
Books" are also represented in the
"Printing for Commerce" display.
These include the Grabhorn press and
Taylor & Taylor of San Francisco,
Bruce Rogers, F. W. Goudy, the Merry
mount Press, and others. The Zeller
bach Paper Company is another San
Francisco press represented in the
commercial display.
Posters, display cards, advertising
booklets, circulars, and other exam
ples of commercial printing make up
the "Printing for Commerce" exhibi
tion, which, with the "Fifty Books of
1926," is intended to illustrate the
renewed interest in fine printing dis
played by American presses in recent
years.
Both exhibitions have been brought
to Stanford through the joint efforts
of Professor Davis, editor of the Stan
ford University Press, and Pedro J.
Lemos, director of the Art Gallery.
