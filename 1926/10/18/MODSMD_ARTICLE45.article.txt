UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, Oct. 14.—(P.I.P.)Adop
tion of the English tutor system for
living groups on the campus is being
considered by Dean Karl T. Waugb
and President von KleinSmid. Their
plan is to secure a number of build-!
ings adjacent to the campus housing I
groups of men each under the super- '
vision of some instructor. The scheme |
involved is about the same as that :
now being used at Oxford where there
are twelve such colleges with the |
same studies going on in each of the
twelve. An integral part of this plan I
is the New Student Union which is to !
form a central organization and meet
ing place.
Lindenmeyer, ail-American tackle of
the University of Missouri, has been
switched to end this year.
