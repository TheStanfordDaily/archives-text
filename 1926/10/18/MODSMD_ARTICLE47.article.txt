# LIBRARY GETS BOOK BY HEAD OF PIONEER STANFORD TRUSTEES
## 
### 
Judge Lorenzo Sawyer, president of
the first Stanford Board of Trustees,
is the ajjthor of "Way Sketches Con
taining Incidents of Travel across the
Plains from St. Joseph to California
in 1850," a large paper copy of which
was received by the Library this
week. The book is one of thirty-five
copies printed on paper with wide mar
gins before actual publication of the
general edition.
Sawyer made the trip from Wiscon
sin to California in seventy-two days,
then an unusually short time for the
crossing, and sent his notes on the
journey back to the East, where they
were printed in the Ohio "Observer."
The editor of the book, E. Eberstadt
of New York, says that although he
couhl not find a file of the "Observer,"
he did find a file of the "Family
Visitor," which was mentioned by H.
11. Wagner in his "The Plains and the
Rockies" as containing the diary. It
is from this source that the book is
compiled.
Sawyer was president of the Board
of Trustees at the time the corner
stone was laid, May 14, 1887, making
on that occasion his last public speech.
He died September 7, 1891, just before
the opening of the University.
Judge Sawyer was descended from
an English family that came to Amer
ica in 1636, according to an account
of his life in the "Resources of Cali
fornia" for September, 1886, which is
devoted principally to the plans for
Stanford University. His family was
one of pioneers, each generation mov
ing westward. He was himself born in
Le Roy, Jefferson County, New York,
May 23, 1820, when the western part
of that state was considered almost
as frontier country.
