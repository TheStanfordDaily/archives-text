"If Poland is permitted to work out
its own destiny," said Professor Har
l'ey L. Lutz, of the Economics depart
ment, while speaking before the mem
bers of the Congregational Church
Wednesday night on his experiences
in Poland as a member of the Ameri
can Committee of Economists and
Bankers, ".she will eventually become
one of the most powerful nations of
Europe.
"My first impression," continued
Professor Lutz, "was of the extremely
friendly and cordial treatment we re
ceived from the Poles. This friendly
attitude is manifested toward all
Americans. It is due for the most part
to gratitude. The Poles will never for
get the part played by America in the
achievement of Polish independence
as outlined by President Wilson in one
of his famous Fourteen Points. Poland
also feels that she can rely upon us
rather than some European power, for
the impartial settlement of her vari
ous economic problems. Thus she turns
freely and without fear to America
for advice."
One evidence given by Professor
Lutz of Polish friendliness to America
was the celebration of the Fourth of
July in the city of Warsaw. "This
celebration, at which we were guests
of honor," Professor Lutz went on to
say, "was given with great feeling
and sincerity. It was attended by many
high Polish officials, including the
President of the Republic. Gorgeous
pomp and ceremony characterized the
celebration, producing a splendid ex
ample of the genuine feeling and spir
itual kinship for America,"
