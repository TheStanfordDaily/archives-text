# JAPANESE STUDENTS REGARD EXAMINATION RESULTS SERIOUSLY
## 
### 
So disappointed are the students
who fail to pass the competitive ex
aminations for entrance "into the Japa
nese Government school of higher
commercial learning, that it is not
uncommon for them to throw them
selves before a fast-moving train or
into the crater of Mt. Asama, a vol
cano, according to L. B. Raisty, of
Texas University, a former instructor
in Nagasaki.
Of the 1200 students who take the
examination only 200 are admitted
and many of the unsuccessful are- so
eager to continue their training that
life loses its interest for them when
they fail.
Although the Japanese school sys
tem was first laid out by Americans,
it was later modeled after the German
system. The schools are now divided
into four groups with the student
doing six years in the primary grades,
six years in the high school, three
years in a higher school corresponding
to the American junior college, and
three years in the university.
A unique feature of Japanese school
ing is the important part in the work
of excursions. Even small children in
the primary grades are taken to see
warships, industrial plants, and places
of historical interest. Both students
and teachers are given a twenty per
cent discount on all excursion trips
taken.
Classes in Japanese schools are
about the same size as those of Ameri
can schools, having about forty-five
members. Pupils are taught English
from the primary grades up.
