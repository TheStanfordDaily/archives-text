Phrases such as "mighty force in character building," "Maker of Men,"
"the finest product of American Athletics," "lovely personality and rugged
character," are so often used in connection with the name Alonzo S"tagg that
many people are wont to forget that besides being a splendid gentleman, he
is also a darn good football coach. While it is true that Alonzo A. Stagg
would rather help to develop the young men he comes in contact with on the
University of Chicago campus into tine, clean, upright athletes, he also gets
quite a kick out of moulding them into a powerful football team that can
beat its opponents in fair battle, and he does this very thing surprisingly well
and surprisingly often, when you consider the material that he gets.
And there are other sides to the "Old Man's" career too. Let's not forget
how, in spite of working his way through Yale, sometimes living on as little
as twenty-five cents a day, he became the most famous athlete of his time.
When Stagg was graduated in 1888, he had the reputation of being an
unbeatable pitcher and a fine track athlete, and Walter Camp chose him as
end on his first All-American team.
Young Alonzo Stagg started out to be a minister, being graduated from
the International Y.M.C.A. College in 1892. He has been coach at the
University of Chicago ever since then, and has four times been one of the
coaches of the United States Olympic track team. In 1912, Stagg was a
Presidential elector of the Progressive party. Besides all that, he is a very
good golfer, though sixty-four years old, and was one of the chief founders
of the largest golf club in the world, the Olympia Fields Club, near Chicago.
