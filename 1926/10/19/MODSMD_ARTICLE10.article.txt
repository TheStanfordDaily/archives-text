# GRID SQUAD TO GO NORTH WITH FULL STRENGTH
## Captain of Oregon Team Watches Stanford Play Nevada TWENTY-FIVE MAKE TRIP Patchett Is Only Member of Team Not in Suit for Signal Drill

Thursday afternoon at 5:19 o'clock
twenty-five Stanford football players,
accompanied by the coaching staff and

1926 season.
Pop Warner put the boys through a
long signal workout yesterday after
noon and also gave them a "black

squad, with the exception of Ernie
Patchett, was in uniform. Patcliett has
a torn ligament in his ankle and was
on crutches yesterday, but he will be
allowed to hobble about without them
today, and it is possible, but hardly
probable, that he will be ready for
the game Saturday.
Hoffman at Work Again
Biff Hoffman was able to take his
place with the regulars in yesterday's
workout. The backfleld combination
which performed Monday afternoon
included Post at quarter, Hill and
Murphy at halves, and Hoffman at
full.
The game Saturday will, in all proba
bility, be one in which open play will
predominate. The Cardinals, with
their many reverse and double reverse
plays, always give the fans a few
thrills, and Oregon is playing more
or less the same kind of football this
year.
Oregon Captain Watches Game
Captain McEwan, the boss of the
Lemon-Yellow squad, was a spectator

urday, and with him were Gene Vidol
and Harry Ellinger, his two chief
assistants.
He went back to Eugene with a fair
idea of what to expect from the Red-
