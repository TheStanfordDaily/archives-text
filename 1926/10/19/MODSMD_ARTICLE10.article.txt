# GRID SQUAD TO GO NORTH WITH FULL STRENGTH
## Captain of Oregon Team Watches Stanford Play Nevada TWENTY-FIVE MAKE TRIP Patchett Is Only Member of Team Not in Suit for Signal Drill 
### 
Thursday afternoon at 5:19 o'clock
twenty-five Stanford football players,
accompanied by the coaching staff and
other athletic officials, will board the
train for Eugene, where they play the
University of Oregon eleven Saturday
in their first conference game of the
1926 season.
Pop Warner put the boys through a
long signal workout yesterday after
noon and also gave them a "black
board" talk. Every member of the
squad, with the exception of Ernie
Patchett, was in uniform. Patcliett has
a torn ligament in his ankle and was
on crutches yesterday, but he will be
allowed to hobble about without them
today, and it is possible, but hardly
probable, that he will be ready for
the game Saturday.
Hoffman at Work Again
Biff Hoffman was able to take his
place with the regulars in yesterday's
workout. The backfleld combination
which performed Monday afternoon
included Post at quarter, Hill and
Murphy at halves, and Hoffman at
full.
The game Saturday will, in all proba
bility, be one in which open play will
predominate. The Cardinals, with
their many reverse and double reverse
plays, always give the fans a few
thrills, and Oregon is playing more
or less the same kind of football this
year.
Oregon Captain Watches Game
Captain McEwan, the boss of the
Lemon-Yellow squad, was a spectator
at the Stanford-Nevada game last Sat
urday, and with him were Gene Vidol
and Harry Ellinger, his two chief
assistants.
He went back to Eugene with a fair
idea of what to expect from the Red-
shirts and most of this week will be
spent developing a defense for the
Stanford attack. The Oregon offense
does not need the attention that the
defense does.
The Webfeet did not play a game
last Saturday and, as a result, their
cripples have had two weeks' rest
since the Washington game. This
should put them in tip-top shape for
the invasion from the South.
Woodie at Quarter
Ira Woodie will hark signals for the
Northerners, Vic Wetzel and either
Art Ord or Otto Vitus will be the
halves, and Lynn Jones will be in at
fullback. The line will be made up of
veterans from one end to the other
and may prove tougher than is ex
pected.
Many experts who saw the Oregon-
Washington game were of the opinion
that the Huskies should have won by
not more than one touchdown which,
if true, boosts Oregon's stock not a
little.
Warner will not announce the squad
which will make the trip until Thurs
day mroning.
