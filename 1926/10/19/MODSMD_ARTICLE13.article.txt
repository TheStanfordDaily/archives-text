# PROMISING SKETCHES SUBMITTED FOR 1926 FOOTBALL GAIETIES
## Suggestions for Acts Will Be Heard by Committee At Meeting 
### 
"Judging from the great evidence
of interest which has reached me,
there is no doubt that Ram's Head will
be thoroughly satisfied with taking
over the sponsorship of the 1926 Foot
ball Show. We expect everybody who
is interested in any part of this show
to be at the meeting tomorrow and
Thursday afternoon. Ideas need not
be in finished form as members of the
committee will be able to produce a
finished product."
Such was the expression of Delmer
Daves, president of Ram's Head So
ciety and chairman of the show com
mittee, in regard to plans for this
year's Football Show.
Musical Numbers
Among the acts which are definitely
under way at this time is a musical
number in which will be featured the
Brooks-Worthington orchestra. Mem
bers of the orchestra are working the
details into form for an early re
hearsal.
Another group has agreed to submit
a sketch in which professors are
shown to have a great weakness for
blondes. It is said that the act, if
accepted, will prove a serious drain on
the number of blondes available on
the campus.
Designs for distinctive scenery will
be called for as soon as the acts reach
the rehearsal stage.
The first meeting is scheduled for
tomorrow at 3 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall. Those who are unable to be pres
ent are asked to come on Thursday at
the same time or get in touch with
the committee through Gordon Davis'
office, Room 203, English building.
Committee Meeting
Delmer Daves requests the show
committee to be present in Room 200
at 5 o'clock this afternoon for a short
discussion.
