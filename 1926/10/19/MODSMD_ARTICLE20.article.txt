### 
Seats for "Hay Fever," comedy suc
cess of the â€¢summer quarter, will go
on sale at 1 o'clock this afternoon at
the A.S.S.U. ticket office in the Old

Noel Coward, in writing "Hay
Fever," has set a new tone for English
dramatic writing. He has caught in his
lines much of the American spirit that
has been best typified in such plays
as "Love 'Em and Leave "Em" and
"The Show-Off."
New Style of Play
In "Hay Fever," with its delightful
disregard for staid form and custom,
Mr.'Coward has made himself indica
tive of the new set of writers in Eng
land since the war. But a few years
in this country, Mr. Coward has pro
duced three Broadway successes.
The play is a clever take-off on Eng
lish mannerisms, with the insertion
of much high comedy. Coward has
succeeded in assembling a prize col
lection of conflicting personalities for
a week-end in an old English manor.
There are present an ingenue, a novel
ist, a boxer, the actress wife of the
novelist, a flapper daughter and a
sporting son, and a young diplomat.
The action moves rapidly through a
series of perplexing difficulties.
"Hay Fever" was acclaimed an out
standing success of the summer quar
ter by the critics. The same cast, all
with individual records of previous
dramatic successes, is reassembled for
the second showing Friday night.
