# Ye Ancient Bridge
## 
### 
In the good old year of 1888, there was built a stately bridge across
San Francisquito creek where the county road meets the University
property at the southwest entrance to the campus. A few years later
the University was founded, and the students would take an afternoon
off to drive out in their horse and buggy to view the structure —for at
that time it was one of the wonders of the University.
But even the greatest of engineering feats gradually wear out.
Thirty-eight winters have done their work on the old bridge, and today
it is again one of the wonder scenes,of the campus. The wonder is:
how does it support the auto traffic that passes over it. For over the
bridge the Stanford students must pass in order to reach Woodside, and
all that the Woodside district offers—in the way of scenery.
The bridge is not only unpleasant to view, but it is also unsafe. The
protruding nails in the floor, the loose boards, the doubtful sound
structure of the bridge itself, and the sharp turn on the east side, all
are factors which may cause a serious accident at any time. In fact, a
life was lost last spring when a car plunged through the fence near
one approach.
With this tragedy climaxing the situation many students and the
University itself have been investigating the cause. In a recent state
ment to a Redwood newspaper, the County of San Mateo has been held
responsible. But so far there has been no action. The feeble old wooden
span is still there —a veritable death-trap—waiting to take an additional
toll of lives.
