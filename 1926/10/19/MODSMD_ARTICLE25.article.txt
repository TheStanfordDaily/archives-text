With the establishment of a new aerodynamics laboratory under the
Guggenheim foundation, Stanford will attain supremacy in still another
field of learning and scientific activity. It will parallel in aeronautics
the pioneering of Professor Ryan in electricity.
Stanford has become well known for its research work. And it is
now bidding fair to extend and enlarge upon its reputation.
The University is extremely fortunate in having two such men as
Dr. Durand and Professor Lesley, whose work has caused the awarding
of the Guggenheim endowment fund. By their efforts, despite the lack
of complete equipment and an adequate force of assistants, highly im
portant aeronautical research has been carried on. With the funds made
available through the generosity of the Guggenheim fund, much more
is possible. —D-1 .R.
