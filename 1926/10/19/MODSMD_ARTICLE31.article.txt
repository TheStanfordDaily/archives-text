# THE 						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Several years ago, when Stanford!
adopted the sponsor system, there was !
weeping and wailing on every hand. |
Furthermore, there was a great deal
of derogatory comment from the out- j
side. Other institutions were inclined 1
to look with scorn upon the idea of J
helping rather than beating new men. [
* * *
Now, most of those institutions are
following Stanford's lead. At Montana,
the system of underclass punishment
has languished and died. At Lake
Forest College, Illinois, an editorial
campaign is being carried on to the
end that a new attitude may be adopt
ed toward entering students. And at
Wooster College, Ohio, a student edi
tor recently wrote, "How ironical it
is to use such methods (class fights)
to introduce freshmen to higher edu
cation in America. Half naked and

grovelling in the dirt, they begin their
novitiate —sore and sweaty they are
introduced to the cultural life of our
country."
Everywhere, the tendency is to drop
the militant attitude toward freshmen
in favor of one of helpfulness. It was
worth the criticism to have Stanford
lead this really worth-while reform.

Not to change the subject, but Clar
ence van Hauden King, Chaparral's
handsome art editor, has drawn a very,
very cagey masthead for this colyum.
At this moment, it is in the hands of
the engraver, but we shall release
it upon an anxious public in a few
days. When we do, we expect a shower
of comments upon the implication it
contains, as regards the attitude of
your author. Watch for it! Watch for
it!
