—Curran: This play was adopted from
the book of the same name by Anita
i Loos. Miss Loos' book gained immense
! popularity largely because of the
clever first-person narrative in diary
style of the trials and tribulations of
Lorelei Lee, a hopelessly dumb follies
I girl. The attempt to dramatize the
book is met with difficulties at the
| outset, because putting the lines in
actors' mouths takes away much of
the charm. And as a result the humor
of the play falls somewhat short of
I that in the book.
However, eRa Martin in the role of
Dorothy Shaw, the traveling compan
ion, and Joan Marion as Lorelei Lee,
the little girl from Little Rock who is
being "educated," are quite successful
in giving their audiences an evening's
entertainment. Miss Martin carries the
j comedy and the show is saved through
| her clever interpretation of the Broad-
I way-wise follies girl. She plays the
j "hard boiled" type to perfection.
Lorelei Lee is unbeatable as a gold
diggr. It takes a beautiful blonde with
I an absolutely bland face to get away
; with it. Miss Marion does it so well
; that when she gets $5000 away from a
| married Englishman you are tempted
| to believe that gentlemen do prefer
| blondes. This is just a step in her
j blind attempt to reach the culmination
|of her desire. Miss Marion goes
, through a series of "a girl must pro-
I tect herself" episodes so well that
i she reminds us of that blind date we
| had last week.
| William Courneen has the male lead,
| appearing as Henry Spoffard, the
Philadelphia millionaire, who is count
' ed the "Big Catch" by all of the Gold
j Digger Clique. In depicting the char-
I acter of a much-sought-after man who
| has learned to shun women, he almost
! approaches the fetichist.
I A bit of comedy is provided by
Edouard La Roche and Martin Wolf
l son, as two French lawyers, acting as
| the Englishman's wife's solicitors in
recovering the $5000 from Lorelei.
These two actors are superb in their
I interpretation of affectionate, vocifer
! ous Frenchmen.
A number of minor parts are par
ticularly well taken. Altogether twen
j ty-one characters are in the play, and
every one of them is well fitted for
j his part.

—Curran: This play was adopted from
the book of the same name by Anita
i Loos. Miss Loos' book gained immense
! popularity largely because of the
clever first-person narrative in diary
style of the trials and tribulations of
Lorelei Lee, a hopelessly dumb follies
I girl. The attempt to dramatize the
book is met with difficulties at the
| outset, because putting the lines in
actors' mouths takes away much of
the charm. And as a result the humor
of the play falls somewhat short of
I that in the book.
However, eRa Martin in the role of
Dorothy Shaw, the traveling compan
ion, and Joan Marion as Lorelei Lee,
the little girl from Little Rock who is
being "educated," are quite successful
in giving their audiences an evening's
entertainment. Miss Martin carries the
j comedy and the show is saved through
| her clever interpretation of the Broad-
I way-wise follies girl. She plays the
j "hard boiled" type to perfection.
Lorelei Lee is unbeatable as a gold
diggr. It takes a beautiful blonde with
I an absolutely bland face to get away
; with it. Miss Marion does it so well
; that when she gets $5000 away from a
| married Englishman you are tempted
| to believe that gentlemen do prefer
| blondes. This is just a step in her
j blind attempt to reach the culmination
|of her desire. Miss Marion goes
, through a series of "a girl must pro-
I tect herself" episodes so well that
i she reminds us of that blind date we
| had last week.
| William Courneen has the male lead,
| appearing as Henry Spoffard, the
Philadelphia millionaire, who is count
' ed the "Big Catch" by all of the Gold
j Digger Clique. In depicting the char-
I acter of a much-sought-after man who
| has learned to shun women, he almost
! approaches the fetichist.
I A bit of comedy is provided by
Edouard La Roche and Martin Wolf
l son, as two French lawyers, acting as
| the Englishman's wife's solicitors in
recovering the $5000 from Lorelei.
These two actors are superb in their
I interpretation of affectionate, vocifer
! ous Frenchmen.
A number of minor parts are par
ticularly well taken. Altogether twen
j ty-one characters are in the play, and
every one of them is well fitted for
j his part.
