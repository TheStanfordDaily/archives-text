# SENIORS HAVE LAST CHANCE THIS WEEK TO PURCHASE QUADS
## 
### 
Seniors desiring Quads will have
their last opportunity to purchase
them during the forthcoming week,
according to Robert Paradise, business
manager of the Quad. Twenty-five
tryoutees have been sent out to get
in touch with those seniors who have
not yet procured their Quads. The Quad
may be purchased outright for seven
dollars, or reserved for three dollars,!
the balance falling due later in the
year.
The urgence for seniors buying their
books now is due to the fact that the
photographer will be on the campus
for only a short time longer. People
who fail to have their photographs
taken while the photographer is here
will have to go to the studio in San
Francisco to get them. Quads may be
obtained direct at the business office
in the Old Union.
Proofs of pictures taken a week ago
for the Quad are available now in the
Trophy Room of the Old Union. Any
Itoble or sorority woman can have her
picture taken for the Quad. Tryouts j
for the editorial staff are still open
for men.
