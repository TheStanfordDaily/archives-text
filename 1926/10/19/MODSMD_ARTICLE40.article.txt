Davis, director of intramural athletics,
announced yesterday. Both classes
boast of heavy, fast teams, and dope
sters have predicted that the winner
of Thursday's game will be the win

Cliff Hey, former varsity fullback, is
coaching the juniors, while Nip Mc-

have been practicing for the past
week and the seniors have held scrim

The Class of 1927 won the interclass

Under Hey, however, the juniors
have developed a strong team which
may put the skids under the fourth
year men. Stockbridge, one of the out
standing players among the interclass
teams last year, is at fullback once
more, while such men as Barnett,
Abbot, and Craig are in the line. Jay
red, of basketball fame, and Brown
