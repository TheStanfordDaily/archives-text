# SAN MATEO COUNTY HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR BRIDGE
## 
### 
The San Mateo County supervisors
are held responsible for the failure to
erect a new bridge on the County
Road in a recent article by D. E.
O'Keefe, a member of a local pioneer
family who is intimately familiar with
local history. Santa Clara County, ac
cording to O'Keefe, has made appro
priations for the construction of a new
bridge and road, but the northern
county has repeatedly refused to act.
The original County Road was that
which leads past Sequoia Hall out to
the Stock Farm and past the old Mono
han property which was recently pur
chased by the University. O'Keefe,
whose article appears in the Redwood
City Times-Gazette, says: "In 1875 the
course of the road running past the
Monohan property was changed. A
short detour was made to meet a nar
row span of the creek over which a
bridge was constructed. This was used
for a number of years. It ran through
to Mayfield.
"When the University was erected
the course of the road ran through
the campus. Leland Stanford went be
fore the supervisors of this county
(San Mateo) and asked that the road |
be abandoned, agreeing to construct
a similar thoroughfare to the rear of ;
the stock farm and a quarter of a mile
up from the old road. The proposition j
was accepted. The new thoroughfare

was accepted and the old road aban
doned. A wooden bridge was con
structed over the creek just below the
Meyer estate. A similar proceeding
was had by the Santa Clara County
supervisors.
"Subsequent boards of supervisors
have held that proceedings by the for
mer board were irregular and not bind
ing, and so, for over twenty years a
controversy has existed between the
board of supervisors of this county
and the supervisors of Santa Clara
county. The wooden bridge built by
Senator Stanford is in a dilapidated
condition not fit for travel. The super
visors of Santa Clara want a new span
and have appropriated funds for that
purpose, but the supervisors of this
county will do nothing, claiming that
the bridge should be erected on the
old road. The impasse can not be
overcome although every angle has
been tried to do so.
"It is hinted now that inasmuch as
the University owns the land on near
ly all sides of the bridge, it will take
the matter out of the hands of the
county officials and will build at its
own expense a new concrete span to
cost $10,000."
University officials declare, how
ever, that University funds cannot be
devoted to the financing of enterprises
which are the obligation of the county.
