# SHORT SKIRTS, ROUGE FOREGONE BY WOMEN STUDENTS IN EUROPE
## 
### 
Bobbed liair, short skirts, and rouge
are feminine pleasures which must be
foregone by women students in the
girls' schools of central Europe, ac
cording to Edgar H. Yolland of the
University of Budapest, who is organ
izing material for the Hoover War Li
brary and taking a special course in
economics at Stanford.
Yolland, who has been a student
in the universities of Budapest, Ham
burg, Vienna, and Geneva, is an honor
ary representative of the Hungarian
Internaiional Student Movement. He
will lecture on the progress of this
movement in his country in the Little
Theatre early in November.
Among the noticeable differences he
lias noted here is the attitude toward
university students in America as com
pared with that in Europe. Here a
college man or woman is considered
commonplace, while in the Old World
countries such a person receives the
utmost respect and consideration.
Student publications in Europe dif
fer from those in this country in that
they take an active interest in national
politics. They enter controversies 011
national defe√üse and other political
questions. Student discipline is also
stressed by the papers there.
The International Student Movement
is doing a great deal, Yolland
states, to foster a more cordial spirit
among the scholars of the various
nations. English and American stu
dents are received with great cor
diality and favor at the Hungarian
universities.
According to Yolland the schools
in his country are anxious to bring
about an exchange of students with
the colleges in the United States.
"Graduate students in medicine, lan
guage, and music will find excellent
opportunities there," he says.
