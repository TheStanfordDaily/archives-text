# GRAVEURE WAS ONCE MEMBER OF DIAMOND HUNTING EXPEDITION
## 
### 
Louis Graveure, the internationally
famous baritone who will open the
Associated Students' Concert Series
with his recital on the night of Octo
ber 28, was not always a singer. His
last job before he took up a musical
career was that of a diamond pros
pector in South Africa.
Mr. Graveure had planned a tour,
but an attack of illness had destroyed
his voice, which was at that time a
deep bass. To forget his disappoint
ment the singer went to South Africa.
While there he met a man bent on
discovering the source of the small
diamonds which are being continually
washed down to the sea in the beds
of small streams and rivers. Mr. Gra
veure was finally prevailed upon to
finance and to be a member of an ex
pedition to the sources of such rivers.
The party was chiefly successful in
finding adventure. Mr. Graveure was
stranded in the hinterland and forced
to work his way back to Johannesburg
by hiring out as a farm hand. He had,
fortunately, invested a little money
before he started, and had enough to
pay for his passage back to Europe.
On the journey home Graveure's
voice returned to him, in better qual
ity than it had been before, but
changed to a rich baritone. A few
months sufficed to put it into perfect
trim, but it was necessary for the
artist to develop a new method of
practice, because he had previously
used strained his voice unmercifully.
Mr. Graveure's perfect present art is
proof enough that the temporary loss
of his voice was not entirely a dis
aster.
