# M'DOWELL RELATES STANFORD CAREER OF HARDY L. DRUMM
## 
### 
Hardy L. Drumm, ex-'95, who
will be a speaker at the Oregon
Send-Off Rally Thursday after
noon, will be a guest of J. E.
McDowell, alumni secretary,
while on the campus.
In an interview yesterday Mc-
Dowell told of Drumm's career
at Stanford. He was an intimate
associate of President Wilbur
and Herbert Hoover. Drumm's
constant industry in extra-cur
ricular activities proved too great
a burden, and he flunked out in
his junior year. Because of his
industrious nature his associates
called him affectionately "Boom."
According to reports received
yesterday from Drumm, the ship
upon which he Is proceeding from
the Orient will arrive in San
Francisco Thursday noon, and he
will be escorted to the campus
by automobile to appear in time
for the rally.
