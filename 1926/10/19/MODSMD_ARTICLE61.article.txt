# CO-OPERATIVE STORE DIRECTORS TO DECIDE REBATE AMOUNT SOON
## 
### 
The amount of the rebate to be dis
tributed by the Stanford Co-operative
Bookstore will be decided at the first
meeting of the directors to be held
soon.
If the store is as prosperous as last
year it is probable that every ten
dollars' worth of purchase coupons
will be worth one dollar return to the
student who presents them when the
rebate is announced.
The increased volume of business
done by the Bookstore this fall will
not, however, be reflected in the re
bate percentage. The profits to be di
vided are those for the year which
ended last August. That the Book
store is a thriving enterprise is indi
cated by the fact that last year it sold
over $70,000 worth of textbooks in ad
dition to thousands of dollars "Worth
of other supplies
In spite of the students' apparent
disregard for coupons indicating a sale
of less than a quarter, the slips be
tween fifty and sixty per cent of the
total business are kept by the pur
chasers and presented annually, ac
cording to the Bookstore management.
