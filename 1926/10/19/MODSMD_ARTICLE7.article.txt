# POLO TEAM MEETS NINTH CORPS AREA FOUR IN FIRST GAME
## Veteran Players of Army Aggregation Should Furnish Thrills 
### 
Stanford polo starts tomorrow when
the strong Ninth Corps Area team
comes down from San Francisco to
meet the Cardinal squad at the varsity
polo field on the highway at 3 o'clock.
The Stanford team has suffered but
one loss by graduation, that of Lyall
Vanderburgh, who held down Number
3 position last season. This will be
filled by E. H. Post, transfer from
New Mexico Military Institute.
The Corps Area team is rated as
among the best in the West. It is
composed of two members of the crack
Thirtieth Infantry squad, now dis
banded, and two members of the old
Corps Area headquarters team, both
of San Francisco. Captains Scott and
Derking of the Thirtieth, and Major
Rucker and Lieutenant Snyder of the
headquarters are past masters at the
game and should furnish some real
thrills in the game tomorrow. Stanford
does not expect to win, regarding the
contest as a practice tilt rather than
a scheduled game of importance.
