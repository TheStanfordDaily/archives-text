# IDEAS FOR ROOTING STUNTS WANTED BY RALLY COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Ideas for rooting section stunts and
field tricks to be employed at the
Washington, U.S.C., or California
games this season are sought by the
Rally Committee in accordance with
its usual custom of offering for com
petition the perpetual trophy cup
awarded each year to the student sub
mitting the best suggestion for stunts
carried out at the major football
games.
"No idea is too small or too large,"
Calvin C. Conron, chairman of the
Rally Committee, said last night. "The
suggestion should be clear and simple
to grasp and symbolical of Stanford or
of the opposing institution."
The ideas should be roughly out
lined or sketched and mailed to the
Rally Committee, Box 577, as soon as
formulated. Only the bare suggestions
are wanted, as the committee will
work out the details of the plans.
The name of the winner in the com
petition, which includes the three
games, is to be engraved on the trophy
cup. Last year the suggestion for the
locomotive stunt took first place,
while in 1924 George Copeland was
awarded first for his suggestion of
the four-ace card stunt.
