# U.S RELATION TO LEAGUE SHOWN BY G.H. STUART
## America Forbidding Merely For Political Effect Declares Speaker SECRETARIAT IMPORTANT Disputes Settled Through Presentation of Facts, Information 
### 
"Much of the forbidding on the part
of the United States in reference to
the League is purely for political ef
fect in as much as we have official
representatives on all important inter
national commissions, and in many of
the offices directly connected with the
League, such as the League librarian
who is an American," declared Profes
sor Graham H. Stuart, who spoke on
"Recent Developments at Geneva" in
the Little Theatre last night.
U.S. Co-operates
"Although the International Bureau
of Hygiene is not under the direction
of the League because the United
States will not allow it, there is much
co-operation between the Bureau of
Hygiene at Geneva and the Interna
tional Bureau of Hygiene where many
American officials are working.
"Settling many disputes without re
ferring them to the council or court
merely by presenting to the conflicting
powers the facts relative to their dis
pute is one of the most important
functions of the Secretariat," says
Stuart.
"Although it receives little public
attention, the Secretariat is one of
the most important branches of the
League functioning throughout the
entire year in collecting and cata
loguing information of an international
character. The Secretariat has a legal
department which prevents much fric
tion by interpreting many facts of
law.
"The personnel of the Secretariat
is composed of men of remarkable
ability who are not political ap
pointees. All the men have a broad
international outlook.
Germany Enters
"Entrance of Germany into the
League is one of the most important
steps taken since the inauguration of
the League, because it provides secur
ity for the operation of the Locarno
and Rhineland pacts. One of the im
portant results of Germany's entrance
was the calling by France and Ger
many of a conference on economic
affairs.
"An essential difference in the
treatment of news concerning the
League by the press in Europe and in
America is the fact that in the Euro
pean countries the newspapers give
great importance to this news which
receives little attention in the United
States," asserts Stuart.
