# OVER 1800 TICKETS PURCHASED TO DATE FOR CONCERT SERIES
## 
### 
More than 1800 tickets for the Con
cert Series being sponsored by the
Associated Students have been sold up
to date, according to a statement made
yesterday by Wilfred L. Davis, man
ager of the series.
While the sale of 1800 seats has
brought in cash to the amount of
$0400, $8000 is needed before the un
dertaking can come out even finan
cially. Although all seats are reserved
there is a large number of good ones
left, according to Davis, and with the
pavilion having room for 3340 places,
there is no possibility of its being
overcrowded.
Tickets for the first concert of the
series, that by Louis Graveure, the
famous Belgian baritone, will be given
out in a few days. Seats for each of
the recitals will be given out separate
ly in the lobby of the Old Union, so
that there will bo no trouble caused by
students who might lose their tickets
in the intervals between the concerts.
Davis stressed that it will be neces
sary for those who are going to attend
the series to send in their remittances
before the end of the week in order
that they may be sure of good places
in the hall. The last regular group of
seats will be given out Sunday.
Checks for tickets should be sent to
Wilfrid Davis at Box 1151, Stanford
University, or they may be turned in
at the lobby of the Old Union. Rates
for the five concerts are $3 for stu
dents registered in the University, $4
for outsiders.
