team will not enter the Stanford
or California games with black
make-up on their faces. This fact
was established last night in a
long distance telephone report
from Captain Jeff Cravath of the
University of Southern California
varsity.
A rumor to this effect has been
prevalent in the northern part of
the state for the past few days,
supported by the fact that Krice
Taylor, colored guard, is key
man for several of Coach Jones'
new trick plays. It was stated
that after the huddle Taylor went
to the side of the line through
which the play was to go.
Because he is colored, he sup
posedly exposed to the opposing
team just where the play was to
go. Consequently, according to
the rumor, the rest of the team
was to be disguised in order that
Taylor might not be identified so
readily. However, Cravath's state
ment last night has put a tem
porary stop to the rumor.
