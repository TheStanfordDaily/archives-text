# BRANDSTEN PREDICTS CARD SWIMMERS TO BE TITLE MATERIAL
## Stanford Will Point Toward National Meet at Iowa During Spring 1927 
### 
"With a better team this year than
Stanford ever had in the history of
the school we should cop the National
Intercollegiate Swimming Champion
ships to be held at Ames, lowa, in
1927, hands down," is the way Ernie
Brandsten expressed himself at the
start of his thirteenth season as coach
of the Stanford mermen. Brandsten
has been engaged as a coach or parti
cipant in swimming affairs for more
than two decades.
Since 1915, under his tutelage, the
Cardinal swimming teams have lost
but two contests, one a varsity affair,
anrl one a freshman meet, and no
water polo games have been lost since
that date â€”a record that has made
him a national figure in collegiate
athletics, and has put the name of
Stanford in great esteem among fans.
In 1922 he sent his team to the first
Intercollegiate Swimming Champion
ships, to take a second to Yale; in
1924, nine Stanford men and one Stan
ford woman helped win the swimming
and water polo events for the United
States, with Brandsten as the aquatic
coach for the United States; in 1925,
his Stanford team took another sec
ond at the National Intercollegiate
Swimming Championships, this time
to the great Navy squad.
Victory This Year?
But Brandsten is certain that this
year will tell a different story and
that his teams will reach the pinnacle
of yearly fame.
While coaching here, he has turned
out some of the greatest divers of all
time. A 1 White, who won the Olympic
diving championships in 1920 and who
holds numerous other intercollegiate
championships; Clarence Pinkston,
winner of the Olympic diving cham
pionships in 1924 and holder of fancy
high diving medals from all over the
country; Dave Fall, who placed sec
ond to Pinkston in 1924; and Clarita
Hunsberger, who won the women's
Olympic diving championship of 1921,
were all developed by Brandsten.
Carl Stevenson and Bob Williams,
newly elected captains of the swim
ming and water polo teams respective
ly, Wallie O'Connor, Austin, and Cur
lett are some of the prominent swim
mers that have been trained by
Brandsten.
