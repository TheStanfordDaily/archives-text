## 
### 
The Sigma Kappa girls of O.A.C. are
; testing the familiar old rhyme:
"Jack Spratt could eat no fat;
His wife could eat no lean."
In striving for trimmer figures they
think they have found a solution.
Those who wish to add weight sit on
one side of the table and those who
wish to lose weight, on the other.
Thus, fattening foods are spurned by
one group and gladly accepted by the
other. Sigma Kappas are checking
their weights, but have not as yet
announced the results.
