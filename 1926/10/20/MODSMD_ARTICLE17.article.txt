# FAST PRACTICE PASSED OUT TO VARSITY TEAM
## Warner Not Anxious to Take Chances on Injuries Of Biff Hoffman PATCHETT ON CRUTCHES Weather Conditions May Be Important in Results Of Oregon Game 
### 
Fast signal practice for the first
string and scrimmage for the remain
der of the squad composed the main
part of Warner's efforts yesterday
afternoon to whip the varsity into
shape for their first conference game
against Oregon, Saturday, at Eugene.
From present indications every regu
lar will be fit for use in the game with
the exception of Patchett, who is still
on crutches with torn ligaments in his
ankle. This may present a problem as
to whom to start at full as Warner
may want to take no chances with
playing Hoffman although the latter
seems to have recovered from his re
cent injuries. If Hoffman does not
start either Joseph or Bogue will prob
ably be used. Artman wrenched some
back muscles in scrimmage but the
seriousness of his injury is not known.
Weather conditions may play a part
in Saturday's contest as a rainy day
would be a distinct advantage to the
Webfooters, especially on their saw
dust field. Two years ago the Stanford
varsity met Idaho at Portland on a
muddy field and barely emerged vic
torious after the mud fight with a 3-0
win.
Today will be the last chance that
Warner will have to give his men a
hard drill as Thursday will probably
be devoted only to a light workout,
the men leaving on the 5:19 train for
the North. The team will arrive in
Oregon too late for a practice.
