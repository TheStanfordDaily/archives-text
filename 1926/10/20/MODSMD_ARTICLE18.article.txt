# ALMACK ADDRESSES EDUCATION CLUB ON SUPERSTITIOUS FOLK
## 
### 
"We still have a hundred persons
who are superstitious to one who is
scientific, in spite of the stress laid
on scientific studies in recent years,"
asserted Dr. Almack, Dean of the
School of Education, in an address on
"Science and Superstition" given be
fore a meeting of the Education Club
Monday night.
Results of a test quoted by Dr. Al
mack showed that in a group of people
chosen at random ninety-five per cent
confessed themselves to be influenced
by one or more common superstitions,
five per cent stated that their conduct
was not affected by these beliefs. In
discussing the idea that women are
more superstitious than men, the
speaker expressed the opinion that
this was not the case. "Women are
simply more truthful on the subject,"
he said.
Dr. Almack holds the school curricu
lum partly to blame for the prevalence
of superstition even among educated
people. Children are taught supersti
tions — tales of fairies, giants, and
brownies. Latin and Greek are given
over to the escapades of these people,
he explained. To remedy this situation
the speaker recommended that magic
and superstition be eliminated from
the subjects taught in the schools and
that more informational material be
given. He urged extension of the scien
tific attitude.
"We must reach the stage of greater
self-reliance. Success follows our own
efforts and is not due to luck; we
must cease using the 'medicine man
method,'" Dr. Almack concluded.
