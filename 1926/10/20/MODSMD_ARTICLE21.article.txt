# Send Band South!
## 
### 
Fifteen hundred dollars has been appropriated to send a fifty-four
piece band to the University of Southern California. The railroad fare
is expected to be sixteen dollars per man, making the total expenditure
for this item eight hundred and sixty-four dollars. This leaves a balance
of six hundred and thirty-six dollars to be spent for Pullman berths,
food, and lodging in Los Angeles.
According to a sentiment expressed by members of the band last
night, the entire organization is willing to pay these latter expenses if
the fifteen hundred dollars appropriated by the Board of Athletic Control
and the A.S.S.U. will be spent solely for transportation. This would
mean that practically all of the band could be sent to Los Angeles.
However, it is understood that the Board of Athletic Control objects
to this on the grounds that if the band is to be sent to the game the
entire expenses of each member should be paid, and that the cost would
be too great if the entire outfit were sent.
But if the individual members of the band are willing to make a
small financial sacrifice in order that all the members may go—there is
no reason why the appropriated money should not be devoted exclusively
to transportation.
When the Executive Committee offered to contribute three hundred
dollars last night they were almost unanimously in favor of bringing all
possible pressure to bear, to see that the entire band received transporta
tion.
The Stanford student body wants to see a ninety-six piece band on
the field the day of the game—a band that we will all be proud of. The
organization wants to see every member make the trip. They are willing
to share the expenses. Give them all transportation.
