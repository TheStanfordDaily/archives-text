The San Francisco Call last night carried a startling exposure of a
fox stunt originated and planned by Howard Jones of the U.S.C. 1 rojans.
According to the Call Jones has been having difficulty concealing his
plays. Brice Taylor, colored guard, has been the first man out of the
huddle and whichever side of the line he went to indicated which way
the play was to go, and gave the opponents a chance to shift to meet it.
At least that is what the Call says.
In order to get around this difficulty, Jones decided to conceal J aylor.
But since he is black that was found rather difficult. Hence, Jones hit
upon the idea of blackening the face of every member of the Trojan
varsity. And then nobody was to know who Taylor was or whether he
was playing on the long side of the line or not. Of course Jones would
have to cut a hand off all of his players to make the deception complete,
but the Call writer didn't think of that. Anyway, the Stanford Daily
decided the whole matter was worth investigating and spent some of the
students' good money calling Jeff Cravath over the long distance tele
phone to find out. When the question was propounded to him he wasn t
sure whether he was the victim of an election bet pay-off or what. \\ hen
he finally got the drift he denied ever having heard of the matter.
The whole point to this is that there is good and bad journalism.
It is very easy to make something startling and sensational out of a mere
rumor. And when the rumor is once put into type it is a difficult matter
to put the public rightâ€”most of the readerj still believe everything they
see in print. However, it's a good idea for a minstrel success, but
scarcely the thing for a football team or a metropolitan sport page.
