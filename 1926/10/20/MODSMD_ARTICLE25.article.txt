# THE
						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
A sport writer for a San Francisco
paper would have us believe that How
ard Jones, coach of the U.S.C. varsity,
is planning to blacken the faces of his
men to the end that opponents may
not be able to predict his plays from
the place taken in the line by Bryce
Taylor, dusky all-coast guard.

Assuming, in the interests of wise
cracking, that there is any truth in
the story, we may be able to see the
following on the gridiron, after the
approved fashion among minstrels:
Quarterback —Who was dat gen-mun
I seen yo all wit last play?
End (man) —Dat was no gen'mun.
Dat was Bill Cook.
(Laughter.)

We're sorry, honestly we are.

Once again, a stranger has come to

the campus, boldly approached a fra-1
ternity house, slipped the brothers the
mystic duke, and has been welcomed
as one of the elect, only to be found
out as an impostor. And once again,
the bogus bro. has been unceremoni
ously hurled into the local cooler.
Ah, me! What a disappointmeut it '
must be to feel one's heart glow with
warm fraternal fervor, only to learn
that the emotion has been wasted I
upon an ingrate.
It all goes to prove something or I
other, although we don't know just
what. Probably the irony in the situa
tion may be traced to the fact that
all chapters of all fraternities have a
laboured process for segregating the
fit from the unfit, and when it is all
over, a stranger who knows the grip
cannot be told from the rest of the
boys.
