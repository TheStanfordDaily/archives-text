# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Having heard several undergradu
ates on the Stanford campus openly
declaring that Hardy L. Drumm, '95,
does not exist on this globe and is
merely a brainchild of the Rally Com
mittee, I earnestly hope that you will
print this communication in "The Stan
ford Daily" to correct this current
slander.
While traveling in South Africa dur
ing the summer of 1920 I met Mr.
Drumm in Southern Rhodesia. He of
fered his services as guide for my
hunting party and was immediately
accepted.
Not only was Mr. Drumm a promi

| nent "activicist" and athlete while at
j tending this University, but he has
distinguished himself through his
natural history studies of African big
game. It seems to me that Stanford
men should be mighty particular about
the way they discuss alumni.
More respect for the real "pioneers"
j who were responsible for the glorious
i early development of Stanford ideals
and activities. J. E. McDowell, alumni
secretary, should be complimented for
his statement in this morning's Daily
| in which he declared that "Boom" was
I a great fellow. He certainly is one
I alumnus that all Stanford men ought
to be proud of. â€”'19.
