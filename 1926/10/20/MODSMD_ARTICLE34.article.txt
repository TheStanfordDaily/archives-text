# DR. BARROW FINDS COLDS NOT DUE TO SLEEPING PORCHES
## Investigations Accepted by Journal of American Medical Society 
### 
Students sleeping on sleeping
porches, in well-ventilated rooms, or
in poorly-ventilated rooms, are equally
susceptible to colds, according to in
vestigations made by William H. Bar
row, M.D., medical advisor of men and
member of the medical school faculty
of Stanford, who published his findings
In the Journal of the American Medi
cal Association of September 18. That
the American Medical Association ac
cepts his conclusions is evidenced by
the fact that the Journal for October
J) contains editorial comment on Dr.
Barrow's work.
"It may be a disappointment to
those given to offhand pronouncements
to read that whether the students use
sleeping porches, well-ventilated bed
rooms, or poorly-ventilated bedrooms
does not materially affect the suscepti
bility grouping," comments the Jour
nal, and continues, "Only by facing
the statistical facts squarely without
commitment to any approved .hypothe
sis can it be hoped to make real pro
gress in mastery over the common 1
cold."
Climate Not Important
Dr. Barrow also concluded that cli
matic conditions do not play a signifi
cant part in the cause of colds, and on
this point the Journal says, "The Sta
tistical comparison recently reported
by Barrow indicates, however, that the
incidence of "colds" at Stanford Uni
versity in California, in a notably
agreeable climate, is about the same
as among comparable groups of per
sons at Cornell University at Ithaca,
New York, Wellesley College, and Har
vard University."
"It would be rash," says the Journal,
"to assert that any theory of the
actual or exciting causes can be suc
cessfully defended at the present
time; but many indications point to a
bacterial factor as the most frequent
probable agent." Drafts and chillings
are not specific causes of colds, ac
cording to the Journal, but tend to
lower the resistance and thus predis
pose the body to infection.
Dr. D. F. Smiley of Cornell Univer
sity carried on a questionnaire inves
tigation in 1924, covering the factors
of smoking, exercise, cold baths, hours
of sleep, draft over the beds, kind of
underwear worn, kind of footwear
worn in wet weather, perspiration
after exertion, constipation, exposure
to dust or gas, mouth breathing, nose
and throat operations, and family his
tory in regard to colds. His general
conclusion was that none of these was
a real major factor in the cause of
colds. The greatest susceptibility was
found among students who wore
woolen underwear, but this might
have been because they wore it to
avoid colds to which they had learned
they were susceptible.
Uses Infection Theory
This report, says Dr. Barrow, sug
gested to him an investigation of the
same sort concerning other possible
factors. Working on the theory that
the individual is made susceptible to
colds, or upper respiratory tract in
fections, by the effect of sudden
changes in temperature and humidity
of the air, he sent out questionnaires
to 2500 Stanford students living on or
near the campus to determine the re
lation between the number of colds
they had and the methods of heating
their rooms; the percentage of colds
and the kind of sleeping quarters,
whether well or poorly ventilated bed
rooms or sleeping porches; and the
relation between the percentage of
colds and the combination of methods
of heating and ventilation.
Tabulations of the replicas to these
questionnaires show that the incidence
of colds is not markedly influenced by
the various systems of heating used
in the studies or living rooms of the
students, although those using wood
or coal show slightly less susceptibil
ity than those using steam or other
methods of heating. Ventilation of
sleeping rooms did not make enough
difference to warrant any definite con
clusions, although students using
sleeping porches reported slightly
more colds than those using well-ven
tilated bedrooms.
On the effect of climate as a cause

of colds, Dr. Barrow says, "Men and j
women react in about the same way ;
to the change from home and other
climatic conditions to college environ-!
ment, SO per cent reporting the same
number of attacks or loss as compared
with the number experienced at
home."
The investigations at Stanford and j
at Cornell both showed women to be
less susceptible to colds than men and
Dr. Barrow concludes his article: "In!
fact, sex is apparently a greater fac-!
tor in the susceptibility to this type j
of infection than is any other factor I
thus far considered."
