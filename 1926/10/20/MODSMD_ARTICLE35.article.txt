# CAMPUS NURSERY RAISES MANY VALUABLE PLANTS
## 
### 
Plants worth thousands of dollars
are being raised by the University
nursery. There are to be planted
around the palms on Palm Drive GOOO'
plants which could not be obtained
from an outside firm for less than five
or six thousand dollars. Also the nur
sery has, waiting to be planted, about
1800 plants of a particular variety of
dwarfed shrub, each being worth a
dollar or more, according to its size.
Plants for Grounds
The nursery, however, is maintained
primarily to propagate new plants for
the University grounds. For instance
125 oaks have been raised to plant
along Palm Drive. The bushes and
shrubs which now decorate the dormi
tories of Toyon and Branner were
grown from seedlings in the nursery.
At present numerous winter and
spring plants are ready to take the
place of those plants which will die
during this autumn, and 10,000' gerani
ums will be ready for the grounds
next year.
The nursery also grows flowers and
shrubs for campus assemblages. One
of the greenhouses is devoted exclu
sively to growing and maintaining
such plants. Ferns, palms, shrubs, and
flowering plants of all kinds are to
be seen waiting until they are needed
to change the stage in the auditorium
to a garden, for the Memorial Chapel,
or for a dance. More than 500 poin
settias are now being grown for the
Christmas holidays.
Cut Flowers Raised
Large beds of cut flowers are also
raised at the nursery. Chrysanthe
mums from such a bed will appear
next month.
Besides the one in which plants are
raised for decoration purposes, the
nursery has a greenhouse as a hos
pital for those plants which are not
faring well, and another used as a
propagating house. In this building
are large beds of sand in which cut
tings from different plants are placed.
After these cuttings have taken root
they are transferred to small pots.
They are placed later in larger pots,
and eventually are planted on the cam
pus. As soon as one lot of cuttings
has rooted and been removed from the
room, another lot takes its place so
that at all times the room is full of
seedlings.
The propagating room contains
plants not commonly found in this
region. One specimen is a new lily
from Northern China, sent to Stanford
by the United States government. Its j
stems grow more than five feet high, I
each one having sometimes as many
as fifteen or twenty blooms.
The flower itself resembles the com
mon Easter lily but is more delicate.
This lily has been found to grow well
in this country.
A rare specimen of a dwarfed cactus
not more than five inches high also
occupies a place in the propagation
room. This plant, a native of South
Africa, has a bark resembling some
what the skin of a snake, and a blos-

sora resembling a star. The blossom
is brightly colored.
Among the specimens in the nursery
are also seedlings of the oldest and
largest plant known, the Giant Se
quoia. At present these seedlings are
only about two inches high.
The nursery has in its employment
a man who has been at the Stanford
farm for over forty years, during this
time working for the University and
for Senator Stanford. He recalls the
time when the old nursery used to be
where the old convalescent home is
now; he remembers that the plot of
ground upon which the University
buildings are now raised used to be
alfalfa fields; and he also can picture
the arboretum when it was newly laiu

spring plants are ready to take the
place of those plants which will die
during this autumn, and 10,000' gerani
ums will be ready for the grounds
next year.
The nursery also grows flowers and
shrubs for campus assemblages. One
of the greenhouses is devoted exclu
sively to growing and maintaining
such plants. Ferns, palms, shrubs, and
flowering plants of all kinds are to
be seen waiting until they are needed
to change the stage in the auditorium
to a garden, for the Memorial Chapel,
or for a dance. More than 500 poin
settias are now being grown for the
Christmas holidays.
Cut Flowers Raised
Large beds of cut flowers are also
raised at the nursery. Chrysanthe
mums from such a bed will appear
next month.
Besides the one in which plants are
raised for decoration purposes, the
nursery has a greenhouse as a hos
pital for those plants which are not
faring well, and another used as a
propagating house. In this building
are large beds of sand in which cut
tings from different plants are placed.
After these cuttings have taken root
they are transferred to small pots.
They are placed later in larger pots,
and eventually are planted on the cam
pus. As soon as one lot of cuttings
has rooted and been removed from the
room, another lot takes its place so
that at all times the room is full of
seedlings.
The propagating room contains
plants not commonly found in this
region. One specimen is a new lily
from Northern China, sent to Stanford
by the United States government. Its j
stems grow more than five feet high, I
each one having sometimes as many
as fifteen or twenty blooms.
The flower itself resembles the com
mon Easter lily but is more delicate.
This lily has been found to grow well
in this country.
A rare specimen of a dwarfed cactus
not more than five inches high also
occupies a place in the propagation
room. This plant, a native of South
Africa, has a bark resembling some
what the skin of a snake, and a blos-

sora resembling a star. The blossom
is brightly colored.
Among the specimens in the nursery
are also seedlings of the oldest and
largest plant known, the Giant Se
quoia. At present these seedlings are
only about two inches high.
The nursery has in its employment
a man who has been at the Stanford
farm for over forty years, during this
time working for the University and
for Senator Stanford. He recalls the
time when the old nursery used to be
where the old convalescent home is
now; he remembers that the plot of
ground upon which the University
buildings are now raised used to be
alfalfa fields; and he also can picture
the arboretum when it was newly laiu
Plants worth thousands of dollars
are being raised by the University
nursery. There are to be planted
around the palms on Palm Drive GOOO'
plants which could not be obtained
from an outside firm for less than five
or six thousand dollars. Also the nur
sery has, waiting to be planted, about
1800 plants of a particular variety of
dwarfed shrub, each being worth a
dollar or more, according to its size.
Plants for Grounds
The nursery, however, is maintained
primarily to propagate new plants for
the University grounds. For instance
125 oaks have been raised to plant
along Palm Drive. The bushes and
shrubs which now decorate the dormi
tories of Toyon and Branner were
grown from seedlings in the nursery.
At present numerous winter and
spring plants are ready to take the
place of those plants which will die
during this autumn, and 10,000' gerani
ums will be ready for the grounds
next year.
