# U. of C. Rooters Will Pay For Big Game Tickets Only
## 
### 
Inaugurating a new policy, the Uni
versity of California will charge stu
dents for rooters' tickets to the Big
Game only. Student body cards will
entitle the holders to admission to
all other conference and non-confer
ence games, including the U.S.C. game.
The price of the A.S.U.C. cards is
$10, and they cover admission to all
athletic contests, except those with
Stanford, subscription to the Daily
Californian, and a right to vote in
student body elections.
Previously a nominal charge was
made for tickets to conference games,
although the practice tilts were free
to A.S.U.C. card holders.
