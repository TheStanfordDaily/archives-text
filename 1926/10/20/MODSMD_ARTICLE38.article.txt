# Improvements Planned by Brandsten at Searsvile
## 
### 
Ernie Brandsten, Stanford swim
ming coach, announces that several
improvements at Searsville Lake are
being made this fall. A new road is
being constructed on the left of the
creek, running from the bridge up to
the dam. The beaches are being lev
eled off and covered with sand drawn
from the lake bottom, while the dense
growth of willows and underbrush by
the Portola drive is being cleared
away.
