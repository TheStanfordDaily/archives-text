# "HAY FEVER" CAST BRINGS NEW TALENT TO CAMPUS
## 
### 
"Hay Fever," Friday night's comedy
farce, to be tu v-sented by the Dramatic
Council under the direction of Gordon
Davis, will offer followers of campus
dramatics a new cast of student talent,
six of the nine characters in the pro
duction making their initial appear
ance before Stanford audiences of the
regular dramatic season.
Making his first appearance in an
important part, although well-known
for stunts and dances such as in the
"Green Goddess," is Byron Harvey,
cast as Simon Bliss, the headstrong
and ingenious son of David Bliss, nov
elist. Football shows, track shows,
Ram's Head plays, and productions of
a more serious nature, have hereto
fore offered Harvey little opportunity
in a character role.
Patrice Naurnan, remembered as the
grown-up "Dulcy" in "Meet the Wife,"
the 192G Senior Farce, will be making
her last appearance, as Mrs. Bliss,
actress-mother who, because of her
peculiar temperament, dramatizes the
incidents of her every-day life. The
part was created by the London favo
rite, Marie Tempest, and was received
with highest praise in the summer
quarter production.
Lucie Bentley, as Myra Arundel, Fri
day night will recall the siren of "Ride
a Cock Horse" and her acting in other
plays. Raymond Haizlip, cast as Rich
ard Greatham of the British foreign

office, returns to the stage after an
absence of several years. Haizlip
played in "Hamlet" last summer with
Nance O'Neal.
J. S. Doran, '26, now teaching in an
Arizona high school, will arrive Thurs
day in order to repeat his interpreta
tion of David Bliss, novelist and figura
tive head of the Bliss family. His act
ing in the summer production was of
such high quality that the Dramatic
Council has incurred the expense of
the trip in order to round out the
"Hay Fever" cast. His appearance will
be his first at Stanford.
Miss Norma Seib, arriving from Los
Angeles, takes the part of Sorel Bliss,
the fourth member of the family. Al
| though Miss Seib has never before
taken a part at Stanford, the name
will appear familiar as that of her
brother, Lester, a former Stanford
1 favorite and now prominent in dra
j matics in the East as Lester Vail. He
j took the lead in the production of
| "Hamlet" in modern dress produced
i at Stanford this summer quarter.
Miss Enid Wall as Jackie Coryton,
Frederick Zitkowski as Sandy Tyrell,
and Miss Alberta Yearian as Clara
complete the series of new faces, and
round out a cast which was as highly
received by critics representing San
Francisco, San Jose, and Palo Alto
newspapers as any in the long history
of Stanford productions.

J. S. Doran, '26, now teaching in an
Arizona high school, will arrive Thurs
day in order to repeat his interpreta
tion of David Bliss, novelist and figura
tive head of the Bliss family. His act
ing in the summer production was of
such high quality that the Dramatic
Council has incurred the expense of
the trip in order to round out the
"Hay Fever" cast. His appearance will
be his first at Stanford.
Miss Norma Seib, arriving from Los
Angeles, takes the part of Sorel Bliss,
the fourth member of the family. Al
| though Miss Seib has never before
taken a part at Stanford, the name
will appear familiar as that of her
brother, Lester, a former Stanford
1 favorite and now prominent in dra
j matics in the East as Lester Vail. He
j took the lead in the production of
| "Hamlet" in modern dress produced
i at Stanford this summer quarter.
Miss Enid Wall as Jackie Coryton,
Frederick Zitkowski as Sandy Tyrell,
and Miss Alberta Yearian as Clara
complete the series of new faces, and
round out a cast which was as highly
received by critics representing San
Francisco, San Jose, and Palo Alto
newspapers as any in the long history
of Stanford productions.
"Hay Fever," Friday night's comedy
farce, to be tu v-sented by the Dramatic
Council under the direction of Gordon
Davis, will offer followers of campus
dramatics a new cast of student talent,
six of the nine characters in the pro
duction making their initial appear
ance before Stanford audiences of the
regular dramatic season.
Making his first appearance in an
important part, although well-known
for stunts and dances such as in the
"Green Goddess," is Byron Harvey,
cast as Simon Bliss, the headstrong
and ingenious son of David Bliss, nov
elist. Football shows, track shows,
Ram's Head plays, and productions of
a more serious nature, have hereto
fore offered Harvey little opportunity
in a character role.
Patrice Naurnan, remembered as the
grown-up "Dulcy" in "Meet the Wife,"
the 192G Senior Farce, will be making
her last appearance, as Mrs. Bliss,
actress-mother who, because of her
peculiar temperament, dramatizes the
incidents of her every-day life. The
part was created by the London favo
rite, Marie Tempest, and was received
with highest praise in the summer
quarter production.
Lucie Bentley, as Myra Arundel, Fri
day night will recall the siren of "Ride
a Cock Horse" and her acting in other
plays. Raymond Haizlip, cast as Rich
ard Greatham of the British foreign

office, returns to the stage after an
absence of several years. Haizlip
played in "Hamlet" last summer with
Nance O'Neal.
