While pledging a group of freshmen,
members of Sigma Tau fraternity of
U.S.C. were confronted by a conflagra

spite of personal risk, the pledging
was carried through and completed by
the time the fire engines arrived. This
is the third fraternity house to burn
this year during an initiation, the
other two being Zeta Kappa Epsilon
and Delta Phi Delta.
