# "OLDEST ALUMNUS" DRIFTING HELPLESS AT SEAâ€”WIRELESS
## 
### 
S.S. Saxafonia, the steamer on
which "Boom" Drumm is sailing
for San Francisco, was yesterday
reported drifting helplessly in
mid-ocean as a result of a broken
rudder. According to word re
ceived by wireless from Vance's
airport near Colma, a hydroplane
left there late last night to pick
up "Boom" and return him to
San Francisco in order that he
might be on the campus tomor
row in time for the rally.
No word has been received on
the campus as to any difficulties
encountered by Drumm. This is
thought to be because of his un
willingness to let anyone believe
that he will not arrive on sched
uled time.
