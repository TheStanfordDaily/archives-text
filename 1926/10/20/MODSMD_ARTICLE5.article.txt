# STANFORD POLOISTS WILL TANGLE WITH NINTH CORPS SQUAD
## Crack Western Army Team Is Considered Among Best on Coast 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Polo enthusiasts are given their first
opportunity to see Stanford in action
this afternoon at 3 o'clock when the
varsity four meets the fast veteran
Ninth Corps Area team from San Fran
cisco on the Highway field. No admis
sion charge will be made for the con
test.
Although the varsity squad has been
holding practices since early in the
quarter, no really effective playing
strategy has been developed, and so
the contest this afternoon is regarded
in the light of an opportunity for prac
tice with a team well grounded in
horsemanship and all around speed
and execution of polo strategy.
Visitors Strong
The Area team has been formed
lately from two crack squads of San
Francisco, the Thirtieth Infantry and
the Headquarters squads. Two men
from each squad play, and each man
is a star in his position. Opposing
them will be a Stanford team made up
of three former varsity players and a
transfer from New Mexico Military
Institute.
Krohn, a veteran at No. 1, is a
clever rider and hitter, and is expected
to show form on offense. Thompson at
No. 2, an excellent rider and all around
fast man on the ball, is also a member
of last year's squad, where he did good
work. His abilities are most apparent
when carrying the ball on long field
I runs.
Post to Play
Post, at No. 3, is a transfer from
New Mexico Military Institute, where
he held down the corresponding posi
tion in face of strong competition. His
riding is aided by familiarity with his
horses, for he brings his own string
with him from the southwestern
school. Although ho is off his best
form at present, he is capable of ex
cellent polo.
Brown, at No. 4, has been trans
ferred from No. 1, where he played
during last year. He is a sure rider,
and when in be√üt shape can be counted
on for good guarding and general
utility at goal. At present, however,
he is slightly off form with a cold.
Captain Trotter, regular No. 4, is out
on account of an operation on liis arm.
Weymouth, playing substitute No. 1,
is a close second to Krohn in ability,
but has not had quite the experience
of the latter. Austin, Connolly, and
Evans, another New Mexico transfer,
are all possibilities in today's game.
Another contest with the same team
will be played on the same field Sat
urday afternoon.
