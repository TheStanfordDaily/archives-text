# EUPHRONIA FORUM SPEAKERS TO CITE AIMEE'S RELIGION
## Society Seeks to Introduce College Man's Point of View on Subject 
### 
Airaee Semple McPherson, now fam
ous evangelist leader of the Four
Square Gospel Church, will probably
be the center of a warm discussion at
Euphronia Society's open forum to
night in the Old Union, on the subject
of "Religion by Personality vs. Reli
gion by an Established Creed."
Mrs. McPherson is probably the best
living example of a religious leader
who depends upon personality. It is
not known which side will use her as
an example.
Religion by personality seems to be
the trend of modern religions enter
prise, while the old religious organiza
tions tend to honor custom, tradition,
and creed. Euphronia seeks to intro
duce the college man's viewpoint on
this topic, and thereby make the topic
doubly interesting.
The fifteen new members of the
society which were chosen after an
elimination contest are expected to
furnish many new ideas on the sub
ject. All the members of the society
are especially requested to be present,
while the public is invited to attend.
