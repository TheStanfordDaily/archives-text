# EUPHRONIA FORUM HELD ON WORK OF NOTED EVANGELIST
## Emotional Appeal Is Chief Factor of Religion By Personality 
### 
"Religion by Personality versus Relig

at the Open Forum meeting of Euphronia
last night in the Old Union. W. H.
Peterson, the president, opened the meet

personality and speaking ability of its
leader, Mrs. McPherson, with emotional
appeal as its moving factor.

both upholding it and criticizing it nega

Mrs. McPherson's power over her con
gregation, is due entirely to her ability
to appeal so strongly to the emotions.
Cases were cited of her philanthropies
and immediately an equal number of in
stances were given telling of the harm
she had directly or indirectly done.
One of the favorable cases cited was
the paving of a Los Angeles street
through the efforts of Mrs. McPherson.
Peterson followed this with the sugges
