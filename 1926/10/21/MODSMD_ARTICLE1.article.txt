# EUPHRONIA FORUM HELD ON WORK OF NOTED EVANGELIST
## Emotional Appeal Is Chief Factor of Religion By Personality 
### 
"Religion by Personality versus Relig
ion by Creed" was the topic of discussion
at the Open Forum meeting of Euphronia
last night in the Old Union. W. H.
Peterson, the president, opened the meet
ing by stating its general purpose was
that of bringing together opinions and
viewpoints on the subject.
He said, "The movement of religion by
personality has a representative in the
Angeles Temple religion of Mrs. Aimee
Semple McPherson. It is the movement
and not the promoter of the movement
which we shall discuss this evening, All
we know is that Aimee dove into the
ocean and came up in the desert; we shall
leave that aspect of the subject there."
The majority of speakers made it a
point to first carefully inform the au
dience that adherence or belief in the
movement was not their attitude. The
discussion centered more on the religion
by personality side of the question, with
Mrs. McPherson as the object of criti
cism, than it did on the religion by creed
side.
Resume of Movement
Robert M. C. Littler at the beginning
of the meeting gave a brief resume of the
Angeles Temple movement, adding his
personal opinion on the question. His re
port in short described the Angeles Tem
ple movement as fundamentalist in the
extreme, and a religion built around the
personality and speaking ability of its
leader, Mrs. McPherson, with emotional
appeal as its moving factor.
Religion Defined
Much time was spent defining religion,
telling its early manifestations in primi
tive man, tracing its development, and
both upholding it and criticizing it nega
tively. It was the general opinion that
Mrs. McPherson's power over her con
gregation, is due entirely to her ability
to appeal so strongly to the emotions.
Cases were cited of her philanthropies
and immediately an equal number of in
stances were given telling of the harm
she had directly or indirectly done.
One of the favorable cases cited was
the paving of a Los Angeles street
through the efforts of Mrs. McPherson.
Peterson followed this with the sugges
| tion that an evangelist be brought to
I Palo Alto to insure the construction of a
good pavement on a certain street that
would benefit the University.
Fakirs' Cure Explained
| A gentleman from India requested that
in discussing this movement and its lead
! er, the background, the past activity of
j Mrs. McPherson be brought to light as
1 is done in the case of other promoters
of mv religions. He further said, "Fakirs
j in India go to a hundred sick children in
one night and sprinkle ashes on their
foreheads. If five of the hundred are
; well the next morning, the fakirs would
j gain many people as their followers,
j These people only think of the few cures,
[ which could have happened by nature
anyway, and overlook the remaining ma
; jority of uncured children."
John Duniway, an Englishman, was
| asked to give his opinion as to whether
such a movement would find adherents in
j any other country to the degree that it
does in America. Duniway responded,
! "Any people is susceptible to a religion
of personality, but the reaction varies
: according to the temperament of the peo
; pie. Englishmen meet at a corner in
1 London every Sunday and carry on an
; extensive open forum. I have seen six
. teen or seventeen different speakers hold
ing small groups of people at one time
in one of these open forums. In passing
from group to group I found many sects
and religions being propounded by the
i various speakers."
