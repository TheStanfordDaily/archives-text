# TRADITIONS, HISTORY OF HARVARD RELATED BY H.R. FAIRCLOUGH
##

"The general atmosphere of Harvard
University, and the cities of Boston and
Cambridge is distinctly intellectual, with
out being offensive," said Professor Hen
ry R. Fairclough, of the Classical Litera
ture Department, in his talk before Chi
Nu Kappa, Honorary Classical Frater
nity, last night at the Women's Club
house.
"The many historical and literary as
sociations of the country are responsible
for this attitude," continued Professor
Fairclough. "Many of the greatest names
in American literature still live in Bos
ton and Cambridge, in the living descend
ants of these men. Colonial beginnings
had their root in this part of America."
"This intellectualism is felt in the Uni
versity circles, as well. Although the
students of the University take some in
terest in athletics, there is a much greater
indifference shown toward these events
than in our Western universities. This
attitude is a trifle unwholesome, leading
one to believe that they have gone to an
extreme in this view," stated Professor
Fairclough.
"I left Harvard, after my year as vis
iting professor in Latin and Greek, with
a great respect for that institution, for its
history, traditions, and system of organ
ization of the present day," concluded
Professor Fairclough, who returned to
Stanford this quarter.
Newly elected officers of Chi Nu Kap
pa are: Almon Manspeaker, president;
Wilma Fenner, vice-president; Joseph
Hall, secretary-treasurer; and Frances
Gooden and Charles Edson, members of
the executive board. Refreshments were
served after the business meeting and
program.
