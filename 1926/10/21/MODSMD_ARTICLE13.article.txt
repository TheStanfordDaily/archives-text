# CARD SQUAD LEAVES TONIGHT FOR EUGENE TO MEET WEBFOOTS
## Twenty-Six Men Compose Stanford's Squad for Conference Game 
### 
Twenty-six Stanford University foot
ball players, accompanied by the
coaching staff and athletic officials of
the school, will board the 5:19 o'clock
train at the Palo Alto depot this after
noon and start their journey north to
meet the University of Oregon in their
first conference game of the year.
After practice last night Pop War
ner announced that the squad which
would invade the north would include
Captain Swan, Hyland, Robesky, Poul
son, Millage, Price, Harris, Freeman,
Hill, Murphy, Harder, Shipkey, Mc-
Creery, Lewis, E. Post, Sims, Bogue,
Symonds, Walker, Graham, Wilton,
Natcher, Hoffman, Sholes, Sellman,
and Joseph.
The players will arrive in San Fran
cisco in time for dinner and will then
go to the Oakland Mole, where they
will board the Shasta Limited, which
will pull into Eugene at 6:05 o'clock
Friday night. While in Eugene the
athletes will stay at the Osburn Hotel.
They will leave Eugene about 12:30
o'clock Sunday and will arrive back
on the campus Monday afternoon.
Practice Last Night
In last night's practice the varsity
scrimmaged against Husky Hunt's
frosh for about twenty minutes and
then ran signals for about forty/five
minutes. George Bogue, halfback,
stopped a stray -shoe with his right
eye and as a result had to quit scrim
mage before time was called, but aside
from a black eye and a headache he
was none the worse for the experi
ence.
The remainder of the squad came
through the last workout in fine style
and most of them are in excellent
condition for the game Saturday. Biff
Hoffman did not scrimmage yesterday
and it is hardly probable that he will
be in the starting lineup Saturday.
Sam Joseph, who will replace him,
looked good against the yearlings last
night, packing the ball through the
frosh lino for several substantial gains.
The remainder of the backfield was
made up of Post, quarter, and Hill
and Murphy, halves. This combination
is expected to take the field against
the Webfeet.
The line probably will be composed
of Walker and Shipkey, ends; Harris
and Poulson, tackles; Captain Swan
and Robesky, guards; and McCreery,
center.
Cards Have Fight Ahead
Realizing that they must win the
game from Oregon to stay in the run
ning for the Pacific Coast Conference
championship, the Cardinals are pre
pared for a hard fight at Eugene and
intend to bring back a victory. The
Oregonians rested last Saturday, so it
has been two weeks since they have
seen action. All their injured men are
back in the lineup and they appear
stronger than they have at any time
this year.
Add to this the fact that they will be
playing before a Homecoming crowd
with hundreds of "old grads" in the
stands and it is not hard to see why
the Redshirts expect a struggle.

Realizing that they must win the
game from Oregon to stay in the run
ning for the Pacific Coast Conference
championship, the Cardinals are pre
pared for a hard fight at Eugene and
intend to bring back a victory. The
Oregonians rested last Saturday, so it
has been two weeks since they have
seen action. All their injured men are
back in the lineup and they appear
stronger than they have at any time
this year.
Add to this the fact that they will be
playing before a Homecoming crowd
with hundreds of "old grads" in the
stands and it is not hard to see why
the Redshirts expect a struggle.
Twenty-six Stanford University foot
ball players, accompanied by the
coaching staff and athletic officials of
the school, will board the 5:19 o'clock
train at the Palo Alto depot this after
noon and start their journey north to
meet the University of Oregon in their
first conference game of the year.
After practice last night Pop War
ner announced that the squad which
would invade the north would include
Captain Swan, Hyland, Robesky, Poul
son, Millage, Price, Harris, Freeman,
Hill, Murphy, Harder, Shipkey, Mc-
Creery, Lewis, E. Post, Sims, Bogue,
Symonds, Walker, Graham, Wilton,
Natcher, Hoffman, Sholes, Sellman,
and Joseph.
The players will arrive in San Fran
cisco in time for dinner and will then
go to the Oakland Mole, where they
will board the Shasta Limited, which
will pull into Eugene at 6:05 o'clock
Friday night. While in Eugene the
athletes will stay at the Osburn Hotel.
They will leave Eugene about 12:30
o'clock Sunday and will arrive back
on the campus Monday afternoon.
Practice Last Night
In last night's practice the varsity
scrimmaged against Husky Hunt's
frosh for about twenty minutes and
then ran signals for about forty/five
minutes. George Bogue, halfback,
stopped a stray -shoe with his right
eye and as a result had to quit scrim
mage before time was called, but aside
from a black eye and a headache he
was none the worse for the experi
ence.
The remainder of the squad came
through the last workout in fine style
and most of them are in excellent
condition for the game Saturday. Biff
Hoffman did not scrimmage yesterday
and it is hardly probable that he will
be in the starting lineup Saturday.
Sam Joseph, who will replace him,
looked good against the yearlings last
night, packing the ball through the
frosh lino for several substantial gains.
The remainder of the backfield was
made up of Post, quarter, and Hill
and Murphy, halves. This combination
is expected to take the field against
the Webfeet.
The line probably will be composed
of Walker and Shipkey, ends; Harris
and Poulson, tackles; Captain Swan
and Robesky, guards; and McCreery,
center.
