# "MENACE OF SCIENCE" SUBJECT FOR JORDAN CONFERENCE TONIGHT
## 
### 
"The Menace of Science" is the topic
which Dr. Jordan will discuss at the
Thursday Evening Conference this
evening at his home. The question for
discussion is whether or not science
has overstepped its proper bounds in
many cases and has not become as
bigoted and dictatorial as the theology
it is fighting.
Dr. Jordan will also discuss the
problems that science has failed to
meet face to face, including those of
medical frauds and the outlawing of
war.
Dr. Jordan is eminently fitted to
discuss these problems, not onjy
through his practical training in
science, but also because of his broad
grasp of the principles of theology.
He has had opportunity to note the
operation of the scientific method in
his years of teaching, research, and
executive work. In addition, he has
observed the influence of religion in
his years as an educator.
The discussion should be of particu
lar interest at this time, following as
it does the Australia-Stanford debate
on the same subject.
As Dr. Jordan makes it a point to
conclude his lectures by 8:30 all stu
dents interested in the subject may
attend and still have time after the
meeting for study.
