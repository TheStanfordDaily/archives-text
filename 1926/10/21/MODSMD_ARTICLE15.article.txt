ON BOARD SS. SAXAFONIA,
Oct. 20.— (Flash) —"I'll be there—
Boom."
This was the last message that
Hardy L. Drumm asked to be sent
to the Stanford Rally Committee
when he dove from the side of the
ship early this morning. He swam
100 yards to the waiting hydro
plane where he climbed aboard and
started roaring on his way to
Stanford where he is to speak be
fore a rally tomorrow afternoon.
ISLE OF BURP, Oct. 20.—(Spe
cial) —A strange hydroplane was
sighted passing overhead late to
night, headed toward San Fran
cisco.
With A 1 Cass leading a troupe of
five players who will present the skit,
"Pyle's Peerless Performing Profes
sionals," final preparations for the
Oregon Send-Off Rally this afternoon
were effected in a rollicking rehearsal
yesterday. The rally is to take place
at 3:45 o'clock this afternoon at the
Engineering Corner.
A departure from the former custom
of parading to Palo Alto on foot will
be inaugurated at this rally with the
formation of an automobile caravan
tu follow the band to the station. The
Rally Committee desires that all who
attend park their cars near the corner
in order to make a speedy trip to town
in the wake of the band, which will
ride on open trucks.
Phil Brooks' orchestra will play dur
ing the presentation of the skit. Ted
Criley and Stephen O'Donnell wrote
the piece, Ilock Chalmers is directing
it, and final word has come to the
Rally Committee that Hardy L.
"Boom" Drumm will be on hand to top
it off with a rousing rally speech.
"Boom" will head the procession to
the Southern Pacific station. The team
embarks at 5:19 o'clock.
A truly remarkable cast has been
assembled for today's production.
Even the directors were convulsed at
last night's rehearsal. The actors in
clude some of (he Ram's Head stars of
past years, and their impersonations
of "Cash-and-Carry's" former simon
pures are sure to make a big hit.
