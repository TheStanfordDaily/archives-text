UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eugene,
Oct. 10. â€”Captain John J. McEwan,
former Army coach, is making every
effort to place an experienced and
powerful eleven on the gridiron
against Stanford in the Homecoming
game here, October 23.
Flaws in offense and defense play
revealed in the Washington game are
being ironed out by Coach McEwan
and his staff of assistants. The for
ward pass attack which proved disas
trous to Washington in the first half
is being perfected by End Coach Bob
Mautz, former Oregon all-coast end.
Old and new pass formations are be
ing drilled into ends and backs during
every practice.
Backfield, Line Practice
The line and backs are not being
neglected. In a recent scrimmage with
the freshman squad, the first-string
backs were given plenty of practice
at tackling the ball-carriers. The Web
foot secondary defense has been slow
and inaccurate in dropping opponents.
This fault accounted for one Husky
touchdown last week. Gene Vidal,
backfield coach, is working up two
sets of offensive backs, those for fast
open play; the other with Lynn Jones,
fullback, as mainspring of the power
plays.
Harry Ellinger, line coach, has
spent the week hammering the for
wards through intensive "live tack
ling," blocking, and quick charging.
In scrimmage they were kept under
sharp surveillance for offside errors,
as these penalties have in previous
samos nullified opportunities to score, ,
The approximate weight of the Ore- j
gon team is ISO pounds, the line tip
ping the beam at 187 and the backs
at 1(55. Homer Dixon, right tackle, is '
Hie heaviest man on the squad, weigh- i
ing 210; Art Ord, halfback, being the :
lightest at 135.
Men injured in the Washington con- 1
test have recuperated rapidly, and all
with the probable exception of Sherm
Smith, two-year veteran, right end,
will be in the starting lineup against j
the Cardinals.
Capt. Sinclair Plays Tackle
Captain Albert Sinclair and Homer
Dixon will have first call on the tackle
berths. Both of these men are experi- j
onced linesmen and will probably re-1
main in the game until they are car- j
ried out. Ellsworth Morten, Bob Bying- 1
ton, and John Warren will be ready
to take the regulars' places if neces- j
sary. Warren has been an understudy
for Sinclair.
Beryl Hodgen, who was shifted from
fullback to guard, will be on the line i
with Bert Kerns. Harold Mangum, Hal j
Harden, Irving Flegel, Cal DeMott
are substitutes for these positions, j
Both Mangum and Harden are experi- \
onced players, while DeMott and Fie-j
gel were freshman stars last year.
Carl Klippel, of last year's freshman ;
squad, has been holding his own with j
Nick Carter and Carl Johnson, both
regular centers. All three men are of
such an equal caliber that McEwan ;
may send any one of them in to face
the Cards. Johnson is the lightest cen
ter in the coast conference, weighing
only 100 pounds.
Should Sherm Smith, two-stripe vet- j
eran end, and Edgar Slauson, ex- ;
freshman, be prevented from starting j
the game due to injuries, Frank Riggs, :
sub-varsity wing of last year, Ted j
Pope, Tony Greer, or Chet Jamison,
playing their first varsity season, may
replace them. Smith and Slauson are
accurate pass receivers and good de
fensive men.
Woodie Clever at Quarter
In the backfield Ira Woodie, 165-
i pound quarterback, will have first
choice as signal-caller. He is playing
his first year on the varsity and his j
bullet-like passes frightened Washing- \
ton not a little. He is swift and elu
sive on running plays and has a clever
variety of plays at his commond.
Vic Wetzel, Oregon's 185-pound
triple-threat left halfback, is one of ;
the heavy artillery of the offense. !
Wetzel's punting has steadied this i
year, averaging 45 yards, some of his j
kicks sailing for over 50'. His weight J
adds to his ability as a line-plunger, I
and he is flashy at skirting the ends, j
He is equally valuable both as a passer
and receiver, and should cause Stan-!
ford the trouble of two ordinary backs, i
Art Ord, pocket-edition Grange, will
be at right half. He is wriggly as an
eel on tackle slants and end sweeps,
and a sure pass receiver. Otto Vitus, i
a regular for two years, will alternate

with Ord, and Ge >rge Burnell, who is
fast and heavy, and Milton Green will
j be substitutes.
"Locomotive" Lynn Jones, weighing
j in at 198, will be in at fullback. Jones
j has been hitting the line with his
! characteristic ferocity and ripping
through for big gains. Cotter Gould
j or Merle Hagan, both heavy and hard
I hitters, may replace him as substitutes
| if necessary.
