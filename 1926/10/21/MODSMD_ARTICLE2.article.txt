# SOCCER LOOP PLANS SUCCEED; COLLEGE LEAGUE IS FORMED
## 
### 
Plans for the intercollegiate soccer
league, submitted recently by Harry W.
Maloney, director of minor sports at
Stanford University, have materialized
to the extent that the athletic directors
of San Jose Teachers' College and San
Mateo Junior College have fallen in line
with Luther A. Nichols, graduate mana
ger of the University of California, in
the formation of the new soccer federa
tion, whose 1926 schedule will become
operative October 30.
With Coach Maloney of Stanford as
president, and S. A. Francis, San Mateo
Junior College secretary-treasurer, the
formation of the loop fulfills plans of
the organizer to bring freshman teams
of California and Stanford into a strictly
intercollegiate league with the junior col
leges of the bay region, it was announced
by Maloney.
Heretofore, Stanford Frosh kickers
have had to resort to club and high school
competition, and the 1930 squad is now
entered in the Peninsula Soccer League,
pending the opening of the intercollegiate
organization. Coach Maloney mentions
that an additional advantage of the plan
is accomplished by bringing the second
varsity team into regular competition by
playing out the Freshman schedule in the
peninsula schedule.
A lone hitch in the 1926 program is in
the limitation of the U.C. financial bud
get, which will prevent the California
Freshman squad from taking part this
year. * +
