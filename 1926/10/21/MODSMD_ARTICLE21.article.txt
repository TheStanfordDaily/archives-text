# Motor to Rally!
## 
### 
Mounted on R.O.T.C. motor trucks, the Stanford Band will lead an
automobile parade of rooters from the rally to the depot this afternoon
to bid the varsity squad farewell. This idea of everyone being trans
ported by auto is a brand new hunch, and the Rally Committee thought
of it all by itselt. Previously, half of the rooters walked to the railroad
station, one-fourth drove, one-eighth went home, and the other eighth
went into the library to study.
Remember that today everyone wants a ride. Fill up your car with
all the humanity that you can find, and follow the band. And as to the
rooters that have no means of transportation—climb aboard the first car
you see. Climax the rally with plenty of cheers at the depot.
A preview yesterday afternoon of the Rally entertainment—a skit
by two eminent campus authors—foretold the many wonders in store for
the rooters today when "Pyle's Peerless Performing Professionals" take
the stage. Do not miss it!
