Amendment numbered 10, on the ballot of November 2, provides a
bond issue of eight and a half millions, for state university buildings and
state office buildings. Two and a half millions is to be used for office
buildings and six millions will be used for university buildings. Half
of the latter will be spent in Berkeley and the rest is for the new
Southern Branch campus.
Students here have many friends, relatives, and other personal con
tacts all over the state. A few favorable words to each of them would
mean much toward the success of this amendment which has been
referred to the people by the State Legislature.
Students who are eligible to vote —got to the polls on November 2,
and meanwhile spread the word to all the voters you know. Tell them
how imperative it is that this measure pass!
At Berkeley, the buildings are badly needed. Out of a total of
seventy-five academic buildings located there, only thirteen are permanent
structures; many of the temporary structures are no better than shacks.
For example the university infirmary, the campus hospital which ad
ministers to the health of the ten ten thousand students on the campus,
and in which many students are confined to bed during the course of the
year, is a wooden building that has been characterized as a veritable
fire-trap.
At Los Angeles, the Southern Branch buildings provided for by
Amendment 10 are just as badly needed. The six thousand students
now in attendance there are being taken care of in buildings designed
for less than half that number.
Do your part and return the aid that California gave Stanford Univer
sity years ago—talk up Amendment 10 to all the voters you know.
