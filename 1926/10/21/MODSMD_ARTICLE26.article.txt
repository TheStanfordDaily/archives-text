# GOLF PLAYERS HAVE TWO DAYS TO FINISH TOURNEY PLAYOFF
## 
### 
With only forty-six men having com
pleted their first round in the medal
play golf tournament on the Beresford
Country Club course at San Mateo,
H. W. Hindry, golf manager, last night
urged that all other contestants play
their 3G holes before the tournament
closes Friday night.
Less than half of the one hundred
men, who signed up for the play, have
turned out thus far.
Four prizes are up for the winners.
Two will go to the first and second
gross scores, and two will go to the
first and second net scores. Playing
under handicap, many of the golfers
have a fine chance to win a prize.
From this group of players the var
sity and freshman squads of six play
ers each will be chosen. The varsity
material shows promise as there are
several members of last year's squad
back, aided by members of last year's
freshman team.
"The freshman team prospects for
this year are poor," said Hindry, "as
but ten men have turned up so far and
none have shown any exceptional
promise."
Some of the best scores turned in
yet are as follows: Richard Lang,
77-78; Albert Purkiss, 87-81; E. E.
Combs, 83; Edwin Meyberg, 84; R. T.
Paine, 85; and Neil Miller, 89.
