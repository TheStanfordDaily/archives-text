# HOSPITAL FUND FOR EMERGENCY SICKNESS ORGANIZED BY GUILD
## 
### 
A reserve fund has been created by the
Students' Guild for those who are sud
denly taken ill or suffer some serious
injury so that he need not be over
whelmed with the unusual financial bur
den. This fund makes the expense in
curred by a student in a hospital no more
than what he would ordinarily pay for his
board outside.
This Students' Hospital Fund is a
form of health insurance to which each
student pays two dollars a quarter, this
amount being included in the community
fee. The Guild does not assist in any
but hospital cases; the assessment on the
students is so small that minor illnesses
which do not need hospital attention can
not be handled.
When a student returns from a period
in a hospital four dollars a day of the
usual five' dollar ward hospital charge
for the first seven days is paid from the
fund. As most of the students admitted
to the hospital are there for less than a
week, the average student is protected
from the usual severe expense of illness.
The fund also provides for the cost of
the physician's routine visits for that
week, which may not exceed ten visits for
not more than one dollar and a half
apiece; twenty-five per cent of the sur
geon's fee for an operation, which amount
is not to exceed twenty-five dollars; fees
for the use of X-ray, the operating room
and anaesthetics, and for the application
of casts.
. All charges other than those mentioned
must be paid by the students themselves.
The expenses are paid only in case the
student is admitted to a hospital, on the
6rder of the Medical Advisor or of a
local physician.
