# "HAY FEVER" WILL ADD FINAL TOUCHES TONIGHT
## 
### 
With only the final dress rehearsal this
evening before the moment of the curtain
raising at Btomorrow evening in the
Assembly Hall, the cast of ''Hay Fever"
is rapidly bringing to a close the long
preparation for the Noel Coward comedy
farce.
The play is fast taking shape and
polish under the direction of Gordon
Davis, who believes that "Hay Fever" is
one of the most charming comedies ever

presented at Stanford. With the action
centering around activities of the Bliss
family, each member enjoying the com
pany of a week-end guest at their home
at Cockham, England, full opportunity is
offered the author of "The Vortex" for
his caricatures on English mannerisms.
The lines are indicative of post-war Eng
land, with a novel and refreshing disre
gard for staid forms and customs.

The difficult part of David Bliss, a
! clever novelist and interpreter of femi
j nine character, who fully appreciates his
I own cleverness, falls to J. S. Doron, late
|of Stanford and now a teacher in an
i Arizona high school. Middle-aged parts
i have long proved difficult for young
i actors, but an exception is obvious in the
; light of criticism following Doron's per
formance this summer.
Two character.-, which are exceptionally

interesting are Jackie Coryton and Rich
ard Greatham, played by Miss Enid Wall
and Raymojid Haizlip. The former, a
flapper, and yet an unusual one because
of her extreme bashfulness, is a part ad
mirably suited for over-acting, but Miss
Wall portrays the character in a most
convincing manner. Greatham is one
who typifies the average American's con-
ception of an Englishman, one who is
wrapped up in his own importance and
whose efforts to stoop to the level of oth
ers arc ludicrous.
' The actress-mother, Mrs. Bliss, who
turns every day occurrences into dram
atic situations, will be portrayed by Pat
rice Nauman. Miss Nauman is especial
ly well remembered for her work in
"Meet the Wife," the 1926 Senior farce.
Myra Arundel will be personified by
Lucie Bentley, who made a hit in the
production of "Ride a Cock Horse"
some time ago.
A familiar name masking a new face is
that of Norma Seib, who will make her
iirst appearance on the Stanford stage
as Sorcl Bliss. Miss Seib's brother, Les
ter, is well remembered as Hamlet in the
recent modern dress presentations. Miss
Seil) is arriving tomorrow from Los An
geles.
Byron Harvey will have his first im
portant role in "Ilay Fever," although
he is well known on the campus for his
work in stunts and dances of a less ser
ious nature. As Simon Bliss, the clever
and willful sou of David Bliss, Harvey
gets his first chance at real characteriza
tion.
Completing the cast are Frederick Zit
owski and Alberta Yearian, the former
taking the part of Sandy Tyrell, and the
latter that of Clara. As a whole the cast
■chosen by Davis for this production! 1
equals any yet seen in a campus produc
tion, according to dramatic authorities in
aiearby cities.

offered the author of "The Vortex" for
his caricatures on English mannerisms.
The lines are indicative of post-war Eng
land, with a novel and refreshing disre
gard for staid forms and customs.

The difficult part of David Bliss, a
! clever novelist and interpreter of femi
j nine character, who fully appreciates his
I own cleverness, falls to J. S. Doron, late
|of Stanford and now a teacher in an
i Arizona high school. Middle-aged parts
i have long proved difficult for young
i actors, but an exception is obvious in the
; light of criticism following Doron's per
formance this summer.
Two character.-, which are exceptionally

interesting are Jackie Coryton and Rich
ard Greatham, played by Miss Enid Wall
and Raymojid Haizlip. The former, a
flapper, and yet an unusual one because
of her extreme bashfulness, is a part ad
mirably suited for over-acting, but Miss
Wall portrays the character in a most
convincing manner. Greatham is one
who typifies the average American's con-
ception of an Englishman, one who is
wrapped up in his own importance and
whose efforts to stoop to the level of oth
ers arc ludicrous.
' The actress-mother, Mrs. Bliss, who
turns every day occurrences into dram
atic situations, will be portrayed by Pat
rice Nauman. Miss Nauman is especial
ly well remembered for her work in
"Meet the Wife," the 1926 Senior farce.
Myra Arundel will be personified by
Lucie Bentley, who made a hit in the
production of "Ride a Cock Horse"
some time ago.
A familiar name masking a new face is
that of Norma Seib, who will make her
iirst appearance on the Stanford stage
as Sorcl Bliss. Miss Seib's brother, Les
ter, is well remembered as Hamlet in the
recent modern dress presentations. Miss
Seil) is arriving tomorrow from Los An
geles.
Byron Harvey will have his first im
portant role in "Ilay Fever," although
he is well known on the campus for his
work in stunts and dances of a less ser
ious nature. As Simon Bliss, the clever
and willful sou of David Bliss, Harvey
gets his first chance at real characteriza
tion.
Completing the cast are Frederick Zit
owski and Alberta Yearian, the former
taking the part of Sandy Tyrell, and the
latter that of Clara. As a whole the cast
■chosen by Davis for this production! 1
equals any yet seen in a campus produc
tion, according to dramatic authorities in
aiearby cities.
With only the final dress rehearsal this
evening before the moment of the curtain
raising at Btomorrow evening in the
Assembly Hall, the cast of ''Hay Fever"
is rapidly bringing to a close the long
preparation for the Noel Coward comedy
farce.
The play is fast taking shape and
polish under the direction of Gordon
Davis, who believes that "Hay Fever" is
one of the most charming comedies ever

presented at Stanford. With the action
centering around activities of the Bliss
family, each member enjoying the com
pany of a week-end guest at their home
at Cockham, England, full opportunity is
offered the author of "The Vortex" for
his caricatures on English mannerisms.
