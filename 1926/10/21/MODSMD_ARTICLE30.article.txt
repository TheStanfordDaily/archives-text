# JUNIORS TO TACKLE SENIORS TODAY IN INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
Intcrclass football season will officially
open this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock on
the varsity practicc field when the junior
and senior elevens meet in what will
probably be the crucial game of the en
tire series.
Dopesters have predicted that the sen
iors will carry off the title again this
year, but the 1928 men have shown such
a decided improvement in the past few
days that today's game is bound to be a
close affair, and the juniors may even
succeed in putting the seniors out of the
title race.
Teams Have Practiced
Both teams have been practicing daily
and each boasts a strong, heavy eleven.
Stars of last year's series and former
freshmen lettermen will be in evidence
on both sides.
Under the coaching of Cliff Hey, for
mer varsity star, the juniors have de
veloped a team which is now rated as a
possible championship contender, due to
the increased turnout of men during the
past week. No definite starting lineup
has been announced by Hey, and the ma
jority of men out will probably get into
the game. Newcomb or Leveson will
start at center, and Mann, Smith, Bia
ginna, and Jardine will start in guard
and tackle positions. Garabaldi, Dyer,
or Ray will open the game at ends.
Juniors Have Letter Men
In the backfield will be Pabst or Clark,
quarterbacks, and Ogden, Rupe, Watson,
or McGuire will start as halves. Clark,
Pabst, and McGuire were all lettermen
on the 1928 freshman eleven, and their
presence in the junior lineup has raised
the 1928 chances considerably. Cypher
or Hannak will complete the lineup at
fullback.
Stockbridge and Brown will start at
ends for the seniors, with Aranstein in
reserve. Walker and Green, and Steven
son and Barnett will open the game as
tackles and guards respectively, and
Wentz will hold the pivot position.
Gregory will start at quarterback, Fer
guson at fullback, and Jay red and
Schwartz at halves. McHose, Barnes,
and Liederman will be held in reserve.
Gregory, senior quarterback, held the
same position at Occidental for two
years, while Brown, Stockbridge, and
McHose are all holdovers from the sen
ior team last year. Green, Aranstein,
Wentz, Jay red, and Schwartz were all
members of the 1927 team last year.
The second game of the interclass se
ries willTje held Friday afternoon at 4:15
o'clock, when the freshmen and sopho
mores tangle. The freshmen showed
considerable strength last night in scrim
mage with the Palo Alto High School
eleven, and are favored to down the sec
! ond-year men.

ries willTje held Friday afternoon at 4:15
o'clock, when the freshmen and sopho

Intcrclass football season will officially
open this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock on
the varsity practicc field when the junior
and senior elevens meet in what will
probably be the crucial game of the en
tire series.
Dopesters have predicted that the sen
iors will carry off the title again this
year, but the 1928 men have shown such
a decided improvement in the past few
days that today's game is bound to be a
close affair, and the juniors may even
succeed in putting the seniors out of the
title race.
Teams Have Practiced
Both teams have been practicing daily
and each boasts a strong, heavy eleven.
Stars of last year's series and former
freshmen lettermen will be in evidence
on both sides.
Under the coaching of Cliff Hey, for
mer varsity star, the juniors have de
veloped a team which is now rated as a
possible championship contender, due to
the increased turnout of men during the
past week. No definite starting lineup
has been announced by Hey, and the ma
jority of men out will probably get into
the game. Newcomb or Leveson will
start at center, and Mann, Smith, Bia
ginna, and Jardine will start in guard
and tackle positions. Garabaldi, Dyer,
or Ray will open the game at ends.
Juniors Have Letter Men
In the backfield will be Pabst or Clark,
quarterbacks, and Ogden, Rupe, Watson,
or McGuire will start as halves. Clark,
Pabst, and McGuire were all lettermen
on the 1928 freshman eleven, and their
presence in the junior lineup has raised
the 1928 chances considerably. Cypher
or Hannak will complete the lineup at
fullback.
Stockbridge and Brown will start at
ends for the seniors, with Aranstein in
reserve. Walker and Green, and Steven
son and Barnett will open the game as
tackles and guards respectively, and
Wentz will hold the pivot position.
Gregory will start at quarterback, Fer
guson at fullback, and Jay red and
Schwartz at halves. McHose, Barnes,
and Liederman will be held in reserve.
