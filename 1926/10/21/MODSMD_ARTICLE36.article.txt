# VARSITY POLO FOUR LOSES ARMY GAME DESPITE STRENGTH
## Crack Ninth Corps Team Wins Meet 9-4; Return Match Saturday 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Unexpected strength and promise
were revealed in the playing of the
Stanford varsity polo four yesterday
afternoon, although not enough to
boat the crack Ninth Corps Area
squad which ran away with the game
in the last two chukkers and finished
on the long side of a 9 to 4 score. Cap
tains Dierking and Scott for the Array,
and Post, Brown, and Thompson for
the varsity, shared the honors of the
day.
Brown, playing No. 4, showed ex
cellent defensive qualities, stopping
drive after drive with well-executed
back-shots. Post, at No. 3, shared with
Thompson the high-scoring honors for
the Cardinals, each tallying twice. He
was fast on turns and recoveries, and
started many drives that menaced the
green-shirted Array players' goal. Tak
ing the ball from the throw-in, he car
ried it singly down the field for the
first score, after 20 seconds of play.
First Chukker Fast
The first chukker was fast, the
three goals being tallied within a half
minute of each other. The score was
tied at two all when, coming back with
extra punch in the next period, the
Army four blanketed the Redshirts,
scoring twice. In the fourth period,
this courtesy was returned, Thompson
and Post eluding the visitors to boost
the tally two more.
Captain Dierking of the Ninth Corps
team played most spectacular polo,
often seemingly off his horse on hard
shots, and regularly stopped Stanford
rallies with clever nigh-side backhand
tries.
Stanford's main difficulty was on
offensive. No co-ordinating attack
could be launched without it being
easily broken up by the San Francisco
team. Scores for the Cardinal usually
followed long individual runs for the
length of the field. Defense showed
remarkable tightness, for no less than
four goals were prevented by fast
blocking by Brown and Post at the
goal line.
Visitors' Play Smooth
The visitors showed smoother play
ing due to their playing their own
private strings. Post's showing de
pended a great deal on his horse's
speed, also.
A complete let-down in the last two
periods spelled decisive defeat for the
varsity. Runs by Snyder, Scott, and
Dierking kept the ball on the edge of
the goal territory, and they pushed it
over four more times before the final
bell.
A second contest with the same
team will be staged Saturday after
noon at 3 o'clock, on the Highway
field.
The line-ups were as follows:
Stanford —No. 1, Weymouth, Krohn;
No. 2, Thompson (2); No. 3, Post (2);
No. 4, Brown.
Array—No. 1, Major Rucker (1),
Captain Jacobs; No. 2, Captain Dierk
ing (4); No. 3, Captain Scott (3),
Lieutenant Snyder; No. 4, Lieutenant
Snyder (1), Captain Scott.
Referee—Lieutenant O. P. Marriot,
Field Artillery, A. C. Larsen, scorer.
