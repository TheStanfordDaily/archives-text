# Marysville Cancels Grid Tilt With Grays
## 
### 
Coach Hal Davis' Stanford grays will
not play a preliminary to the Freshmen-
Mare Island Base Hospital game Satur
day unless a team can be lined up today |
or tomorrow. The Marysville American
Legion-eleven was scheduled to take on I
Davis' charges but word from the north
ern town yesterday cancelled the game.
The week's layoff will be more or less
welcome to Davis as Burton, first string
fullback, is laid up with a bad shoulder,
and Rehrig, right halfback, is now nurs
ing a broken nose.
