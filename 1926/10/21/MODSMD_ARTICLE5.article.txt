# "BIG GAME GAIETIES" SELECTED AS NAME FOR FOOTBALL SHOW
## Many Good Skits Turned In; New Jokes, Plans for Acts Still Needed 
### 
The meeting of the football show
committee will be held at two
o'clock today, instead of three, in
order that those participating may
have an opportunity to go to the
send-off rally for the Oregon game.
"Big Game Gaities" has been se
lected as the name for the 1926 foot
ball show by the Ram's Head commit
tee in charge of the show.
At the "ideas meeting" of the com
mittee yesterday afternoon in the As
sembly Hall a large number of plans
for skits were given a first hearing.
In the opinion of Delmer Daves, presi
dent of Ram's Head Society, the ma
terial presented gave full promise of
a highly original and successful per
formance.
While it is too early to remark speci
fically upon the acts submitted, those
turned in included a collegiate take-off
on Hamlet, a disguised Greek tragedy,
a dancing act, and several short skits.
The meeting today will still be open
to suggestions, and those who were
unable to be present yesterday are re
quested by Daves to appear at the
stated hour of two o'clock. Three or
four acts are expected to go on the
stage for preliminary review.
As the time remaining before the
show must go into the rehearsal stage,
Daves asks that all ideas be put into
writing in order they may be more
easily judged by the committee.
Jokes that may be easily and clever
ly worked out are wanted for short
skits by the committee. Music selec
tions must be in the hands of Gordon
Hall by the end of this week.
