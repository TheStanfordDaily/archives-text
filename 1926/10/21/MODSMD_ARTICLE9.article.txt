# PAVILION WILL BE TRANSFORMED FOR CONCERT PROGRAM
## Three Thousand Temporary Seats, Platform Under Construction 
### 
The Basketball Pavilion will present
yn appearance quite different from its
usual aspect when Louis Graveurc, the
famous Belgian baritone, makes his ap
pearance here the night of October 28 in
the first concert of the series which is
being sponsored by the A.S.S.U.
On the iloor of the pavilion will be
placed approximately 30U0 temporary
seats, while a large platform upon which
the artists will appear will be erected at
the west end of the building. The plat
form will be high enough so that it will
he possible to see the artists distinctly
from every seat in the building.
Sounding Board Planned
A large sounding board, which is to be
built behind the platform will rellect the
sounds from the platform to every seat.
Although the basketball pavilion was
not designed with the thought in mind
that it might at some time be used as a
concert hall, its accoustics are very good,
according to Alfred Hertz, director of
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
who is to appear in one concert here with
his orchestra later in the season. Hertz
declared that the construction of the hall
with its freedom from obstructing pillars
and sound-absorbing passages makes it
entirely suitable for any sort of musical
event.
Seats for the concert may still be ob
tained either at the lobby of the Old)
Union or from Wilfrid Davis, Box 1151,
Stanford University. Rates for students
registered in the University for the five
concerts are $3, for outsiders $4.
