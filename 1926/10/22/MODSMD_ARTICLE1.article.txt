# 1930 FOOTBALL TEAM OPPOSES NAVy HOSPITAL
## Last Preliminary Contest Before U.S.C., California Freshman Games HUSKY HUNT HAS TASK Trojan Babes, Bruin Cubs, Preparing for Battles With Card Yearlings 
### Joe Carroll 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 the
Stanford freshman football squad
under Coach Husky Hunt will enter
tain the U. S. Naval Hospital team
from Mare Island in the stadium. This
game is the culminating contest of a
successful preliminary season, for in
the next two weeks comes the tests
of the fall's work. The babes meet the
Trojan yearlings next week and play
the Bruin cubs in the Little Big Game
the Saturday after that struggle.
As the varsity is playing Oregon at
Eugene, and no game has been sched
uled for the Grays, the freshman
game is the only gridiron contest that
will be offered to Stanford rooters
this week-end, especially those who
are not journeying across the Bay to
view the U.S.C.-California struggle at
Berkeley.
Freshmen Undefeated
The freshmen have come undefeated
through a hard series of preliminary
contests. With victories over really
good football teams, such as the St.
Marys freshmen, the San Mateo Junior
College, and the Sacramento Junior
College, the squad will face the service
men tomorrow with a confidence that
comes from winning games. They will
endeavor to keep their slate clean, but
are up against a team that is due to
cause them considerable worrying be
fore the afternoon is over.
This year's freshman squad has
-worked with a will. The men reported
at the campus on September 15, and
began work on the fundamentals.
Since that time they have improved
j immeasurably and are now a smoothly
i working outfit.
"Only those who saw the freshmen
, during the first few days of practice
| can appreciate the improvement they
j have shown since that time," says
Coach Hunt. "They have become a
| football team now that has a fair
i chance to defeat the Bruin cubs."
Hunt, as freshman coach, has a hard
! job every year. He has a host of ma
' terial on hand about which he knows
practically nothing. He must take
these men and not only weld them
into a winning team, but also teach
them the fundamentals so that they
will be ready for Pop Warner when
he needs new material for his varsity
squad. Yet, in spite of the handicap
of a short training season, his teams
I have won two games out of three from
the Bruin cubs, and bid fair to capture
another victory this year.
Trojan Babes Strong
The Trojan freshmen defeated the
' Bruin cubs by a 21 to 7 score. This
was after the Trojan team had been
hit by injuries and ineligibilities. Both
teams are now pointing for the Red
shirted babes. U.S.C. looks particu
larly strong in view of the win over
California. Clint Evans, freshman
coach at U.C., is building up his sub
stitute list in an attempt to conquer
the Cardinal yearlings by means of
superior reserve strength.
Necessary work on smoothing out
rough spots in team play has been
delayed at various times during the
season because of the numerous in
juries suffered by members of the
squad. At one time every man on the
first string was under doctor's orders.
; This last week A1 Forster, tackle, has
not been in a suit because of a weak
ankle. Bill Burke has worn a suit, but
has seen no rough work recently. How
ever, most of the other men are now
in good condition. "Lud" Frentrup,
halfback, is about ready to go again,
and will probably see action Saturday.
Right here is a good place to praise
the work of the various linemen and
backs who have been playing the game
all season, but whose work has not
been mentioned when the team has
been discussed. It is due mostly to
them, however, that the freshmen have
functioned as they have in the past,
and they must keep up their part if
the team is to continue its so far
successful season.
