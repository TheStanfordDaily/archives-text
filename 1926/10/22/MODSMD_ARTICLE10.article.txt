# POPULAR PLAY TO BE STAGED TONIGHT BY SUMMER CAST
## Critics Herald "Hay Fever" As Great Satire in New York, London 
### 
Bringing to a close rehearsals
which have extended over an inter
mittent period of four monthc, the nine
members of the "Hay Fever" cast will
tonight assemble for the final occasion,
as the curtain rises at 8:20 in the
Assembly Hall for the Dramatic Coun
cil's production of the comedy-farce
by Noel Coward.
Announcement of the cast personnel
was first made during July, allowing
some three weeks before the perform
ance of the summer quarter. The cast,
scattered following the last examina
tion of the quarter, have returned to
Stanford for the production tonight
from residences throughout California,
with J. S. Doran, playing the leading
role of David Bliss, traveling from Ari
zona in order to attend the week of
rehearsals and performance.
"Hay Fever," written by the tal
ented English author whose first play,
"The Vortex," received popular ac
claim from a multitude of critics dur
ing long runs in London and New
York, is full of his nettles of swift,
piercing repartee. The plot deals with
the activities and peculiarities of the
Bliss family of four. Week-end guests
have been invited to the family home
in Cockham, England, each of the
Blisses acting independently in the
matter of invitations.
The acceptance of these invitations
assembles: David Bliss (J. S. Doran),
a novelist and nominal head of the
Bliss family; Judith Bliss (Miss Pa
trice Nauman), a retired actress and
wife of the novelist; Simon Bliss
(Byron Harvey), their headstrong, in
genious, and romantic son; Sorel Bliss
(Miss Norma Seib), their equally head
strong, ingenious and romantic daugh
ter; Richard Greatham (Raymond
Haizlip), of the foreign office, and
guest of Sorel; Myra Arundel (Miss
Lucie Bentley), mature vampire and
guest of Simon; Sandy Tyrell (Frede
rick Zitkowski), Mrs. Bliss' young boy
friend; Jackie Coryton (Miss Enid
Wall), bashful flapper and potential
character in a David Bliss novel-to-be.
Miss Alberta Yearian is cast as Clara,
Mrs. Bliss' maid.
The above characters are thorough
ly shuffled, mixed, paired, and made
