# ONLY FEW STUDENTS AT U.C.WILL RECEIVE BIG GAME TICKETS
## 
### 
Only seniors, graduates, and 167
juniors at the University of California
will be allotted extra family tickets for
the Big Game this year, according to a
story printed in the Daily Californian
this week. No sophomores or fresh
men will get any of the tickets, except
ing those for their rooters' seats.
The large demand for seats by the
preferred classifications made this
move necessary. Sixty-one thousand
applications have been filed with the
Memorial Stadium office, while Cali
fornia was allotted only 49,035 seats,
including those in the extra bleachers.
There are thus 11,065 more applica
tions than there are seats available.
Two thousand three hundred and five
checks were mailed out last week,
leaving 8760 more applications upon
which money is to be sent back to
those applying.
Student extra family tickets are
next in line to be refunded, and the
8760 extra applications are being re
turned from this classification, begin
ning with the freshmen.
Seniors and graduates made 334.1
applications under classification five,
leaving 334 tickets to be given out.
These will go to the juniors in the
order in which members of that class
filed their applications. Each applica
tion calls for two tickets, so that 167
juniors will receive their seats.
The ticket department of the Stan
ford Board of Athletic Control Is so
rushed with the work of preparing the
tickets for the Stanford-University of
Southern California game for mailing
that they are unable to give out any
information as to whether or not Stan
ford students will receive their two
extra seats.
