# JUNIORS HOLD 1927 GRIDSTERS TO TIE IN INTERCLASS BATTLE
## Defence of Third-Year Men Halts Opponents' March For Winning Score 
### 
Junior and senior grid teams bat
tled four quarters to a scoreless tie
yesterday afternoon in the first game
of the interclass series, and thus, from
the start, tangled the league so that a
play-off game may have to be held to
determine the title-winner.
Although playing was ragged on
both sides, both elevens showed strong
defenses, and it is doubtful whether
either the freshman or sophomore out
fits can down either of the upperclass
teams in the coming games of the
schedule. The showing of the juniors
last night rather upset the dope as
the 1927 men had been favored to win.
Although held scoreless, the seniors
showed the greater offensive power,
carrying the ball within scoring dis
tance on several occasions only to
lose it when the junior defense stif
fened. During the first half, they
marched down the field to the juniors'
one-yard line, but there lost the ball
on downs.
In the third quarter, the seniors
again started a march down the field
and were within twenty yards of the
line when Moore intercepted a pass
and ruined their chances of tallying in
that period. In the fourth quarter, the
1927 team took the ball to the fifteen
yard line, making first downs four
times in succession. The junior line
stiffened here, and McHose attempted
a drop-kick which was blocked. The
game ended with the seniors again in
possession of the ball and waging a
desperate passing attack.
This afternoon, the second game of
the interclass series will be held be
tween the freshmen and sophomores.
Both teams are rather light, but make
up in speed what they lack in size.
The freshmen have had several work
outs during the past week, and have
scrimmaged twice with the Palo Alto
high school eleven.
Following is the lineup of yester
day's game.

Junior and senior grid teams bat
tled four quarters to a scoreless tie
yesterday afternoon in the first game
of the interclass series, and thus, from
the start, tangled the league so that a
play-off game may have to be held to
determine the title-winner.
Although playing was ragged on
both sides, both elevens showed strong
defenses, and it is doubtful whether
either the freshman or sophomore out
fits can down either of the upperclass
teams in the coming games of the
schedule. The showing of the juniors
last night rather upset the dope as
the 1927 men had been favored to win.
Although held scoreless, the seniors
showed the greater offensive power,
carrying the ball within scoring dis
tance on several occasions only to
lose it when the junior defense stif
fened. During the first half, they
marched down the field to the juniors'
one-yard line, but there lost the ball
on downs.
In the third quarter, the seniors
again started a march down the field
and were within twenty yards of the
line when Moore intercepted a pass
and ruined their chances of tallying in
that period. In the fourth quarter, the
1927 team took the ball to the fifteen
yard line, making first downs four
times in succession. The junior line
stiffened here, and McHose attempted
a drop-kick which was blocked. The
game ended with the seniors again in
possession of the ball and waging a
desperate passing attack.
This afternoon, the second game of
the interclass series will be held be
tween the freshmen and sophomores.
Both teams are rather light, but make
up in speed what they lack in size.
The freshmen have had several work
outs during the past week, and have
scrimmaged twice with the Palo Alto
high school eleven.

day's game.
