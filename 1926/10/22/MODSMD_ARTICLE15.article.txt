ON BOARD SHASTA LIMITED,
Davis Junction, 10:30 p.b., October
21, 1926.— Members of the Stan
ford football team exhibited ex
cellent spirits during the first lap
of their trip north, spending most
of the evening in talking over the
coming contest with Oregon. Sev
eral of the gridders diverted their
minds by playing cards, while
other more industrious members
studied for their next week's
classes.
Coaches Winterburn and War
ner kept to themselves and seemed
to be discussing the plan of action
for Saturday's game. Trainer
Denny was busy relating his ex
periences when at Carlisle to a
group of spell-bound listeners.
Coach Pop Warner's Cardinals meet
their first conference opponents to
morrow afternoon at Eugene, Oregon,
when they tackle the University of
Oregon eleven in a game that should
tell the Pacific Coast football world
at large just what place Stanford
should take in the race for the title.
After a spirited send-off rally yester
day afternoon by 1500 students, twen
ty-six players, accompanied by coaches
and managers, boarded the train at
5:19 bound for Eugene.
Oregon Dangerous
The Redshirts are still the unknown
quantity in conference football. Wheth
er they really hit their stride in the
second half of the Nevada game can
be told by the pace they set tomorrow.
