# CARDINALS BATTLE OREGON IN FIRST CONFERENCE TITLE OF 1926
## Team Sent Off Yesterday Afternoon by Student Rally of 1500 QUALITY STILL UNKNOWN Game Will Show Fans What Stanford's Chances Are for Title

ON BOARD SHASTA LIMITED,
Davis Junction, 10:30 p.b., October
21, 1926.â€” Members of the Stan
ford football team exhibited ex
cellent spirits during the first lap
of their trip north, spending most
of the evening in talking over the
coming contest with Oregon. Sev
eral of the gridders diverted their
minds by playing cards, while
other more industrious members
studied for their next week's
classes.
Coaches Winterburn and War
ner kept to themselves and seemed
to be discussing the plan of action
for Saturday's game. Trainer
Denny was busy relating his ex
periences when at Carlisle to a
group of spell-bound listeners.
Coach Pop Warner's Cardinals meet
their first conference opponents to
morrow afternoon at Eugene, Oregon,
when they tackle the University of
Oregon eleven in a game that should
tell the Pacific Coast football world
at large just what place Stanford
should take in the race for the title.
After a spirited send-off rally yester
day afternoon by 1500 students, twen
ty-six players, accompanied by coaches
and managers, boarded the train at
5:19 bound for Eugene.
Oregon Dangerous
The Redshirts are still the unknown
quantity in conference football. Wheth
er they really hit their stride in the
second half of the Nevada game can
be told by the pace they set tomorrow.
In the Webfooters Stanford will meet
a team with an unimpressive record
so far, but there are indications that
Captain McEwan is likely to turn out
a dangerous team before the season is
over and, tomorrow being "Itomecom
ing Day," may be the time they will
hang out the red flag.
Warner has drilled his charges hard
this week and is taking no chances of
letting the Cards be caught napping.
Every regular except Hoffman is in
shape for the game and Biff can play
if it is necessary. If Stanford can con
tinue playing the brand of ball they
started last Saturday they should gain
a sufficient lead to allow Warner to
use his second string so as to save
the regulars as much as possible from
injuries which will handicap them in
the game with the Trojans the follow
ing week.
Lineup Unknown
Just what lineup the Stanford coach
will start has not been announced but
it is expected that the opening whistle
will find Shipkey, Poulson, Captain
Swan, McCreery, Robesky, Harris, and
Walker on the line. Post will probably
start at quarter, and either Hill, Sims,
or Bogue at left half, Murphy at right
half, and Hoffman or Bogue at full.
