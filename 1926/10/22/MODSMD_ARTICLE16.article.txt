# ILLUSTRATED REVIEW TO GIVE PRIZE FOR BEST CONTRIBUTION
## 
### 
The Stanford Illustrated Review is
unique among alumni publications in that
it is offering a prize of $25 for the most
interesting article submitted each month
by a student, former student or alumnus,
for publication in the magazine.
A number of students are at present
busying themselves in an effort to win
the money, but J. E. McDowell, alumni
secretary, believes, it is probable that
alumni are not yet aware of the oppor
tunity as the notice announcing the prize
was buried away in the last paragraph of
a small editorial of the October issue of
the Review, the first issue to be put out
by the new editor, Frank J. Taylor, Stan
ford '18.
Assurance that the prize will be award
ed in cash each month comes from both
J. E. McDowell, '00, the business mana
ger, and from Frank J. Taylor, '18, the
editor of the magazine, who say they
hope the prize will furnish an incentive
for more of the alumni to contribute ar
ticles about Stanford, or about Stanford
men and women and their work on or off
the campus. "The articles can be long or
short, serious or in lighter vein. Photo
graphs are desired. Poets may roll their
own verse," says the editor.
