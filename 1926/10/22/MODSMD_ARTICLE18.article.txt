# Stanford Starts Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford will break into the percentage column in the Pacific Coast
football rating after tomorrow's game with Oregon. Every other coast
eleven has already stepped off, either with the right foot or with the
wrong one, and coast fans are watching to see the start that Pop War
ner's varsity makes.
University of Washington has already taken the measure of the Web
footers from Eugene, but the close score indicates that Oregon is not to
be beaten without a fight. The contest tomorrow being played on a
foreign field puts Stanford at a disadvantage, and especially as the strange
field may be disguised with a coat of mud. But the Red machine is just
starting to roll. Stanford is said to be through with fumbling for the
year, and from now on, football will be played for the entire contest and
not for a few minutes now and then.
Pacific Coast football enthusiasts will only be able to watch the
Stanford-Oregon match out of the corner of their eyes, for their main
attention will be on the game at Berkeley tomorrow. California and
U.S.C. meet in the Memorial Stadium in what appears to be the main
event for the week-end. The Bears are only a shadow of their former
selves, and the Trojans are touted as being stronger than ever before.
Notwithstanding the way the dope points, the stadium will be packed
with people who actually expect to see California win. Some of these
fans remember how the inferior Berkeley eleven defeated U.S.C. the
last time they played two years ago. In any case there will be a closely
contested game in the East Bay region tomorrow.
The only other conference match scheduled for tomorrow is between
Washington University and Washington State College—the traditional
rivals in the northlands. The spirit runs high in Seattle over this game,
although for the past few years the State College has been completely
outclassed by Bagshaw's super-eleven.
If you cannot listen in over a radio on the Stanford-Oregon game,
the next best bet is to travel to Berkeley and be a neutral spectator at
that contest. Take a good look at the Trojans for you will see them
again next week in the Coliseum at Los Angeles. —W.F.A.
