The athletic events of this week well illustrate the University's plan
along the lines of physical education for men. A chosen few are playing
football with the varsity at Oregon, the freshman eleven meets the Mare
Island Navy Corps, the Reserves had a game scheduled with Marysville
American Legion (cancelled by Marysville), four interclass football
squads engaged in something similar to football this week-end.
Intramural athletes meet on the handball court for the first event of
the intramural season. A golf tournament open to all Stanford is being
conducted. The varsity soccer team, meets the Mercury Club, and the
freshman eleven plays some outside squad. A polo game is scheduled,
and so on.
All this goes to show that there is a sport activity for everyone, if he
will but tryout. Every undergraduate at Stanford should be able to
make some kind of a team. The University plans to have everyone out
in the open developing his body rather than sitting in a smoky room
developing his ability at cards. Physical education should be as much a
part of the University's training as the mental development, for the
mind, without the body, is practically worthless. Stanford University
realizes this. —W.F.A.
