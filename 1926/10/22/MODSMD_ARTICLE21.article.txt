Above, you see the picture drawn by
Van King, the advent of which has
been heralded in glowing terms. For
fear of destroying what is now a meek
and humble mien, we will refrain from
adding to last Tuesday's laudatory
comments any further praise of the
artist himself, but shall content our
selves with a profound bow and a
sincere thanks.
Â» * *
In the event that some of our read
ers would like to know why Van drew
this particular picture, let us explain.
The design of an intrepid young man,
armed only with a fountain pen, calm
ly waiting to combat a vicious, charg
ing bull, was selected because it was
thought to be symbolic of the follow
ing ideas, principles, desires, inten
tions, and resolutions, to-wit:
There is, abroad in the world, a
harmful beast, known variously as
Hypocrisy, Hokum, Bunk, or Bull. Be
cause this beast, in any of the first
three of these forms named, is hard
to visualize, it has been represented
here, in the form immediately sug
gested to the imagination by its latter
title.
Know now that it is the peculiar
nature of this beast not to be vulner
able to ordinary weapons, but, rather,
to be affected by a verbal attack.
Hence, the doughty fellow who would
combat the beast is equipped with a
fountain pen.
Excepting only the possibility that
the human frailties of the author oc
casionally preclude absolute fearless

| ness, it shall be the policy of this
, column to abate, in whatever degree
is possible, this nuisance, Bull.

Today, twenty-odd men and a car
; load of sweat-stained uniforms left
j the campus for a four-day excursion,
the prime object of which is to test
the relative strength, in terms of foot
ball, of the University of Oregon, and
our own Stanford.
Last week, the President of the
J University left for the Orient, on a
! more extensive trip, with the- end in
mind of attending a convention, the
i object of which is to improve inter
| national relations on the Pacific.
In order that the importance of the
first event might be properly im
pressed upon the minds of men, a
series of committee meetings were
held, a program was presented, and
finally, two thousand men and women
got together and shouted for an hour
and a half with but little interruption.
The latter departure was marked by
1 the utmost simplicity, and was notable
i for the entire absence of any except
the principals in the affair, and a few
close friends.
Is the contrast between these two
events to be interpreted to mean that
the student body is composed of a lot
of silly, adolescent, uncivilized fat
heads? Not necessarily. It simply im
! plies that, since the beginning of time,
there has been little or no relation be
tween the amount of shouting attend
ant upon any event, and the import
ance of that event to civilization.
