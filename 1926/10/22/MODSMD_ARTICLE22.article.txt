Concert of the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, Curran Theater
Dr. Alfred Hertz and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra presented three
rather unfamiliar numbers in their first
Sunday concert in the Curran Theater.
Interesting numbers, all of them, but the
program suffered from the absence of
well-known and singable melodies to bft
whistled on the way home.
On the other hand there was novelty.
The recent Italian number, "The Pines
of Rome," by Respighi, was not only
given its San Francisco premier, but in
troduced to the audience a new instru
ment, the phonograph.
Schumann's First Symphony, associated
with "longing for spring," was typical in
feeling of the great composer of the ro
mantic school who never quite mastered
the technique of composing for the or
chestra as well as he did that of the
piano.
"Swan of Tunela," by Jan Sibelius,
the most prominent of living Scandi
navian composers, was interesting enough
to make the listener wish that the whole
of the suite from which it was taken
formed the program. It is to be hoped
'that its companion numbers will be played
this season.
There is no doubt, after the presenta
tion of the two symphonic suites, "The
Fountains of Rome," and now "The Pines
of Rome," that their composer, Respighi,

is a figure of importance among con
temporary musicians. Whether or not
one is moved by his somewhat indefinite
melodies and broad harmonies, there must
be recognition of Respighi's extraordi
nary command of instrumentations and
orchestral effects. In the "Pines" he fol
lows the novel and, on the whole, very
satisfactory plan of depicting the sounds,
atmosphere, and inspiration of various
spots in and around the city on the Tiber.
Here he meditates successively near the
pines of the Villa Borghese, the Cata
combs, the Janiculum, and the Appian
Way. He does for Roman scenes some
thing similar to what the American, Em
erson Whitthorne, has done for New
York with his modernistic piano sketches.
The contrast in moods is quite remark
able. Near the pines of the Catacombs
one is conscious of a mournfully mystic
chant, that of the early persecuted Chris
ties, which slowly develops. Along the
Appian Way, the composer seems to have
had a clairvoyant vision of the glory and
pomp of ancient Rome, mistress of the
world. The trumpets of the legions of
the Caesars ring through the confused
and impressive welter of orchestral
sounds; a tremendously gripping, march
ing rhythm surges in the music; one is
compelled to feel the power, pomp and
ruthlessness of the days when the Ap
pian Way was the path of men of blood
and strength. Unfortunately Dr. Hertz
took undue advantage of the brilliance
and volume of the brasses. The music
assaulted the ear too vigorously at times.

given its San Francisco premier, but in
troduced to the audience a new instru
ment, the phonograph.
Schumann's First Symphony, associated
with "longing for spring," was typical in
feeling of the great composer of the ro
mantic school who never quite mastered
the technique of composing for the or
chestra as well as he did that of the
piano.
"Swan of Tunela," by Jan Sibelius,
the most prominent of living Scandi
navian composers, was interesting enough
to make the listener wish that the whole
of the suite from which it was taken
formed the program. It is to be hoped
'that its companion numbers will be played
this season.
There is no doubt, after the presenta
tion of the two symphonic suites, "The
Fountains of Rome," and now "The Pines
of Rome," that their composer, Respighi,

is a figure of importance among con
temporary musicians. Whether or not
one is moved by his somewhat indefinite
melodies and broad harmonies, there must
be recognition of Respighi's extraordi
nary command of instrumentations and
orchestral effects. In the "Pines" he fol
lows the novel and, on the whole, very
satisfactory plan of depicting the sounds,
atmosphere, and inspiration of various
spots in and around the city on the Tiber.
Here he meditates successively near the
pines of the Villa Borghese, the Cata
combs, the Janiculum, and the Appian
Way. He does for Roman scenes some
thing similar to what the American, Em
erson Whitthorne, has done for New
York with his modernistic piano sketches.
The contrast in moods is quite remark
able. Near the pines of the Catacombs
one is conscious of a mournfully mystic
chant, that of the early persecuted Chris
ties, which slowly develops. Along the
Appian Way, the composer seems to have
had a clairvoyant vision of the glory and
pomp of ancient Rome, mistress of the
world. The trumpets of the legions of
the Caesars ring through the confused
and impressive welter of orchestral
sounds; a tremendously gripping, march
ing rhythm surges in the music; one is
compelled to feel the power, pomp and
ruthlessness of the days when the Ap
pian Way was the path of men of blood
and strength. Unfortunately Dr. Hertz
took undue advantage of the brilliance
and volume of the brasses. The music
assaulted the ear too vigorously at times.

Concert of the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, Curran Theater
Dr. Alfred Hertz and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra presented three
rather unfamiliar numbers in their first
Sunday concert in the Curran Theater.
Interesting numbers, all of them, but the
program suffered from the absence of
well-known and singable melodies to bft
whistled on the way home.
On the other hand there was novelty.
The recent Italian number, "The Pines
of Rome," by Respighi, was not only
given its San Francisco premier, but in
troduced to the audience a new instru
