# FOOTBALL VETERANS AT OREGON U HAVE VARIETY OF COACHES
## McEwan, Maddock, Smith, Have Directed Destinies Of Webfoot Team 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Oct.
21.—(Special.)—Men who are playing
their last year on the varsity have had
the unusual experience of being taught
the grid game by three different coaches.
Captain Albert Sinclair, tackle, is the
only man on the present squad who played
under Shy Huntington four years ago.
When the 1923 season closed Hunting
ton resigned and his place was filled by
Joe Maddock and Richard Shore Smith,
who tutored the team for only a year
each. The season under Maddock was
rated as a fairly successful one. Oregon
won her last conference game under his
coaching. Washington was unexpectedly
toppled, 7-3; Washington State held to
a 7-7 tie, and the traditional homecoming
game with O.A.C. also ended in a victory
for the lemon-yellow.
The securing of Captain John J. Mc-
Ewan under a five year contract marks
a new epoch in Oregon athletic history.
This is the first time in recent years that
a coach has been signed for longer than
one season.
Capt. McEwan comes here with an en
viable reputation, both as a player and as
a coach. From 1923 until last year he was
head coach at West Point, and his cadet
teams won 18 games, played six ties, and
lost only five encounters during that
period. In the traditional games with the
Navy, he succeeded in gaining two vic
tories and one tie.
McEwan's career as a player is no less
brilliant. His first college football was
played under Doc Williams at Minnesota
in 1911, and at West Point he played
three seasons, being captain of the squad
his final year. Walter Camp selected him
as all-American center in 1914.
However, McEwan is not the only
bright star on the Webfoot coaching staff.
Gene Vidal and Harry Ellinger, former
West Point gridsters, and more recently
assistant coaches, were chosen by Mc-
Ewan to aid him here.
Ellinger was once a mainstay of the
Army line at guard, and now has the
responsibility of building up a strong
Webfoot forward wall. Gene Vidal, stel
lar halfback at West Point, is tutoring
the backfield under McEwan's eye. Vidal
liad the distinction of being chosen the
second best aH-around American army
athlete in the Inter-allied games held in
Paris after the war.

a coach has been signed for longer than
one season.
Capt. McEwan comes here with an en
viable reputation, both as a player and as
a coach. From 1923 until last year he was
head coach at West Point, and his cadet
teams won 18 games, played six ties, and
lost only five encounters during that
period. In the traditional games with the
Navy, he succeeded in gaining two vic
tories and one tie.
McEwan's career as a player is no less
brilliant. His first college football was
played under Doc Williams at Minnesota
in 1911, and at West Point he played
three seasons, being captain of the squad
his final year. Walter Camp selected him
as all-American center in 1914.
However, McEwan is not the only
bright star on the Webfoot coaching staff.
Gene Vidal and Harry Ellinger, former
West Point gridsters, and more recently
assistant coaches, were chosen by Mc-
Ewan to aid him here.
Ellinger was once a mainstay of the
Army line at guard, and now has the
responsibility of building up a strong
Webfoot forward wall. Gene Vidal, stel
lar halfback at West Point, is tutoring
the backfield under McEwan's eye. Vidal
liad the distinction of being chosen the
second best aH-around American army
athlete in the Inter-allied games held in
Paris after the war.
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Oct.
21.—(Special.)—Men who are playing
their last year on the varsity have had
the unusual experience of being taught
the grid game by three different coaches.
Captain Albert Sinclair, tackle, is the
only man on the present squad who played
under Shy Huntington four years ago.
When the 1923 season closed Hunting
ton resigned and his place was filled by
Joe Maddock and Richard Shore Smith,
who tutored the team for only a year
each. The season under Maddock was
rated as a fairly successful one. Oregon
won her last conference game under his
coaching. Washington was unexpectedly
toppled, 7-3; Washington State held to
a 7-7 tie, and the traditional homecoming
game with O.A.C. also ended in a victory
for the lemon-yellow.
The securing of Captain John J. Mc-
Ewan under a five year contract marks
a new epoch in Oregon athletic history.
This is the first time in recent years that
a coach has been signed for longer than
one season.
