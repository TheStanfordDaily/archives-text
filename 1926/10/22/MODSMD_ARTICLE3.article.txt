# TUNNEY GLAD OF FAITH SHOWN BY OLD BUDDIES
## Stanford Coach Wins Cravats By Backing Assertions Of Champion's Skill 
### 
Harry Maloney, Esq.,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Harry:
Your letter of September 30th
was read a couple of days ago with
great interest. It is very gratify
ing to know that you, with a few
other buddies of war-time days,
had confidence in me. Personally,
I never doubted that I would be
victorious.
It will give me a great deal of
pleasure to visit you at Stanford
on my next trip to California.
With many thanks for your kind
interest, and with warmest per
sonal regards, believe me
Ever sincerely,
Gene Tunney.
Possibility that Gene Tunney, heavy
weight boxing champion, will visit Stan
ford soon developed yesterday following
receipt of the above letter by Harry Ma
loney, Varsity boxing coach, from the
champion. The heavyweight king has as
yet no known plans for a western tour,
but when he doe* come to California and
the campus, it is expected he will give

an exhibition here.
Maloney was a war-time friend of Tun
ney and from the beginning of his friend
ship had been impressed with the ma
rine's ability as a fighter. Before the
recent title match in the Philadelphia
stadium when Dempsey lost the crown,
| Maloney wrote two exclusive articles for
I the San Francisco Examiner, in which
jhe unqualifiedly and unreservedly pre
i dieted a decisive Tunney victory and said,
I moreover, that the present champion's
J straight punches would turn the trick,
j The Stanford coach was practically alone
among sport critics in anticipating a win
by the challenger.
Maloney is spending most of his time
this week collecting the fifty or more
neckties which he won as a result of bets
on the fight. After publication of his
prognostications,, numerous friends "call
i ed" him on his rashness. He refused to
| stake money on the battle, but he did
venture to promise a necktie to each of
his friends if Dempsey won.
