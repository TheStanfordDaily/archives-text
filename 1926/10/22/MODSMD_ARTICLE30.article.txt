# DO FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL MIX?
## 
### FEG MURRAY 
It has long been a debated question
whether or not football and baseball mix
to advantage, and this writer stands
strongly on the affirmative side of the
case. Those who claim that successful
participation in both sports is not possi
ble to the majority of athletes usually cite
the case of Jim Thorpe as proof, and
seem to think that because one of the
greatest football players of all time was
a flop in the majors, and,various lesser
gridiron stars have also failed on the dia
mond, that the debate is won.

I But for every Thorpe, Killinger,
Haines, Workman, Harley, Mohardt,
1 Castner, and Uteritz who shone in col
lege football and who failed to shine in
Big League baseball, you can name a
Mathewson, an Overall, a Frisch, a Col
lins, a Ccohrane, a Gehrig, a Sewell, or
| a French who made good in the majors
j after a successful career as a gridiron
star. And, friends, that is only half of it,
for there is also a host of others, includ
ing men like Alonzo Stagg, Tad Jones.
Ted Coy, and Mack Aldrich, of Yale;

Jim Cooney and Sam White, of Prince
ton ; Sam Felton, Eddie Mahan, "Tack"
Hardwick and George Owen of Har
vard ; and Charlie Barrett of Cornell —
all of whom starred in both sports and \
never went 011 into pro baseball after
■ graduation, even though they surely
I could have made good if they had wanted
| to try it.
Then there are men like Hugo Bez
! dek, Neale, Charlie Moran, and Ernie
Quigley, who successfully have combined
i football and baseball; Bezdek as coach

of the one and manager of the other,
Neale as a star ballplayer and later a
football coach, Moran as an umpire and
coach, and Quigley as a baseball umpire
and football official.
Usually, I think, the reason that many
football heroes flop when they get into
major league baseball, is because they are
either signed up mostly on their football
reputation, or else the wear and tear of
the gridiron has incapacitated them for
real diamond usage.
Other famous ball-players who also
played intercollegiate football are Chief
Bender, of Carlisle and the Athletics;
Carl Lundgren, of Illinois and the Cubs;
Dave Fultz, of Brown and the Phillies;
Ralph Glaze, of Dartmouth and the Red
Sox; Garland Stahl, of Illinois and the
Red Sox; Riggs Stephenson, of Alabama
and the Indians; Mike Gazella, of Lafay
ette and the Yankees; Henry Vick, of
Michigan and the Cardinals; Ernie Nev
ers, of Stanford and the Browns; and
Paul Florence and Andy Cohen, of the
Giants, who came from Georgetown and
Alabama, respectively.
