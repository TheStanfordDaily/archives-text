# TENNIS COURTS NEAR ENCINA GYM TO OPEN LATE IN NOVEMBER
## 
### 
Work on the new unit of tennis courts
beyond Encina Gym is nearing comple
tion, according to A1 Masters, Graduate
Manager. It is hoped that they will be
open the last of November, when tennis
stars may be brought here for their
initial use.
The courts were to be opened the morn
ing of the Stanford-Washington game,
but due to the necessity of a fill in the
ground of the end section, construction
on the whole unit had to wait for the
settling of the ground.
There are eleven courts, the three near
est the bleachers being for the Varsity,
and eight for general use, all to be sur
rounded by a twelve-foot screen. The
present bleachers arc to be dropped 19
inches and lattice work is to cover the
back, the whole being finished with a coat
of paint. Landscape gardeners will soon
begin work on the grounds around the
courts. Thirty thousand dollars, from the
general fund, is being expended on the
entire project,
A layer of five inches of basalt from
the Stanford Quarries has been com
pressed into four inches to form the
foundation. Above this is two inches sub
surface of Layco mulsified asphalt and
clay, covered by a top-surface of finer
Layco. Work on the sub-surface is new
well on its way.
Because of the care taken in filling and
settling the ground before any construc
tion was begun, there is 110 probability of
the courts cracking or caving in. The
filled section was covered with water
most of the summer. Any possible crack
ing tendencies on the part of the courts
will be checked by the fact that there
arc three layers of differnt matrials, in
stead of the usual single layer of asphalt
or concrete.
