# CAREER TESTS NOW GIVEN BY PERSONNEL OF RESEARCH STAFF
## Vocation Manuals on Hand; Help Students to Choose Occupations 
### 
Interest Classification tests and vo
cational information manuals are now
available at the Personnel Research
Division of the Registrar's Office for
those students who are anxious to ob
tain the advantages offered from ex
tensive research work held in order to
help the student to choose in later life
that field of endeavor in which his
interest is the highest.
Pre-engineering students can now
take special tests which are useful in
estimating the extent to which the
student is ready to enter a general
engineering course. These tests are
given at a minimum charge to pay for
the costs. Those interested should see
Dr. Karl M. Cowdery, Assistant Regis
trar.
Pamphlet Aids Choice
The Vocational Information pamph
let contains a summary of the oppor
tunities and qualifications necessary
for a large number of occupations. It
was prepared by the faculty commit
tee on Vocational Guidance, which
was assisted by experts in each of the
lines represented.
The purpose of the bulletin is: (1)
to help the high school student to
decide whether he will continue his
education in the University; (2) to
enable the student who enters the
University to make an intelligent
choice of vocation; (3) to assist the
University student in planning his
work and outlining his course of study
to the best advantage; and, (4) to
indicate to the University graduate
ways of getting established in his
chosen vocation without loss of time.
Student's Interests Determined
The interest Classification Service
test is prepared for the same purpose,
to help the student choose an occupa
tion in which he is highly interested.
To take the test the individual is
given an Interest Report Blank which
contains the names of 84 occupations,
7S types of people, 34 sports and
amusements, 6 kinds of pets, 13 repre
sentative kinds of reading, 23 miscel
laneous activities, and 25 school sub
jects. Each item listed has following
it the letters LID around one of
which the student should draw a circle
according to whether he likes, is indif
ferent to, or dislikes respectively the
item. When this is done his score
is compared with the scores of those
men who have been successful in some
occupation, and his interests will be
graded accordingly.
Data so far accumulated by Dr.
Cowdery and Dr. E. K. Strong, Jr.,
professor in the Department of Psy
chology and Graduate School of Busi
ness, indicate in a tentative way that
the findings of this test have signifi
cance. But, as stated in an explana
tory statement by the originators of
the test, research has not been pur
sued far enough to warrant guarantee
ing the results as final and adequate
for a sole basis in selecting a profes
sion. The test is available at a charge
of fifty cents per occupation rating,
with a minimum fee of $1.
Professional Differences Found
Tests of this type which have been
given, according to Dr. Cowdery's
pamphlet on "Measurements of Pro
fessional Attitudes," indicate that doc
tors, lawyers, and engineers have dif
ferent interests. Doctors rank high in
their attitude to express an obligation
to serve others. The attitude of the
engineers has been characterized as
one of relative dislike for social, cul
tural, and abstract intellectual situa
tions, and includes a comparatively
narrow set of positive interests in
situations involving the use of mechan
ical principles and manipulations,
while lawyers like situations involv
ing social contacts, verbal activity,
and its direct influence upon other
people, coupled with a comparative
dislike for the use of mechanical tools
and principles.
By special appointment the series
of tests for engineering students ar
ranged by Professor L. L. Thurston of
Chicago University can be had, one
of the series being designed to de
termine the mechanical ability of a
student, four being subject matter
tests, and one being on techn cal in
formation. The mechanical test is
given for fifty cents, while the other
five together are given for $1.25.
The standards for these tests are
established by the ratings attained by
freshmen in the eastern engineering
schools and the tentative standards
found for the new Upper Division s!u
dents in the Stanford Engineering
School.
