# HARVARD LAW ALUMNI SENT PAMPHLETS ON SCHOOL'S PROBLEMS
## 
### 
Ten thousand Harvard Law School
alumni in all parts ol the world have been
mailed during the past week a printed
pamphlet on the school's history, develop
ment and future, written by Dean Roscoe
Pound.
Harvard alumni in Stanford Univer
sity, to receive the pamphlet are, Garrett
Henry Elmore, James Gordon Emerson,
Professor Marion Rice Kirkwood,
George Edward Osborne and Clarke
Butler Whittier.
The pamphlet sets forth the reasons
why Harvard Law School men have or
ganized a campaign to raise $5,000,000
for endowment, which is needed for two
major purposes: to maintain the tra
ditional high standards of legal educa
tion at the Harvard Law School, and to
provide means for practical legal research
designed to adapt our laws and their ad
ministration to the ever increasing com
plexities of modern life.
In regard to the future of the school,
Dean Pound takes up in detail the meth
ods to be pursued in maintaining the tra
ditional high standards of professional
training and then turns to the need of in
creased provisions for practical legal re
search. Of this he says:"The present
generation finds scant opportunity for
research and for writing at a time when
they are much needed. The stress of busi
ness in the courts of today compels the
judges to work rapidly, with a minimum
of deliberation, without the elaborate
argument of a century ago. Thus, at a
time when constructive work of the high
est order is called for, the very circum
stances of judicial administration tend to
preclude it.
"Yet more difficult questions are aris
ing than any with which American judges
had to deal in our classical constructive
periodâ€”the period from the Revolution to
the Civil War. Hence, it is not likely that
American courts will much longer be
able to do more than give authoritative
form to what has been worked out and
formulated by others.' '
In surveying the entire field calling for
practical legal research, Dean Pound re
marks that: "Criminal law and procedure
call for the best efforts of thoroughly
trained common-law lawyers."
As a paramount need, he writes:
"Above all, however, the development of
an urban, industrial society in place of
the rural, agricultural society for which
our legal institutions were given shape,
raises new problems of legislation, of the
application and enforcement of the many
and varied legal precepts required by a
complex social and economic order, and
of preventive justice, each of which calls
for the best in the way of juristic creative
power and inventive resource which our
law schools can develop."
