# UPPERCLASSMEN ONLY OWN CARS AT MICHIGAN
## 
### 
Only upperclassmen whose scholas
tic record is such as to enable them to
take part in extra-curricular activities
are permitted to maintain automobiles
at the University of Michigan.
All student-owned or operated cars
are required to be registered in the
office of the Dean of Students, and
any student owning or operating a car
without a certificate of registration
issued from this office is liable to
discipline. A written statement assum
ing responsibility for any accident or
trouble arising through the use of an
automobile must be filed by the parent
or guardian of each student owning a
car before the latter is entitled to this
certificate of registration.
The adoption of this new rule, which
has just gone into effect this semester,
was largely induced by the great num
ber of accidents occurring during the
last two years. Four students were
killed in automobile accidents during
the past year, and three the year
before.
The following statement with refer
ence to the question has been issued
from the office of the President:
"The possession of cars by students
too often leads to a serious waste of
lime, to the growth of many forms of
extravagance, and to an increase in
practices which, besides distracting
the students from the purposes for
which they came to the university, in
volves moral risk. Moreover, serious
accidents resulting at times in the
death of students compel us to give
heed to this matter."
