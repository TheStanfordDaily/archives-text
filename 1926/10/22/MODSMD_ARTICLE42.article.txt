# SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL LAUNCH ENTIRE STRENGTHSATURDAY
## Drury, Cravath Both Slated To Be in Usual Places At Opening Gun 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.—With old
injuries healing rapidly and no new ones
cropping forth, it is probable that the
entire strength of the University of
Southern California will be presented
against the Golden Bears of California,
Saturday afternoon. Neither Jeff Cra
vath, center, nor Morley Drury, half, were
used against Occidental because of bad
leg injuries. Brice Taylor, Kenneth Cox,
and Morton Kaer, who were on the hos
pital list, got into the fray and the rough
and tumble failed to aggravate their in
juries.
Coast Jones had his regular starting
line-up together now and has done away
with the temporary shifts to which he had
to resort in the past two games. A1 Beh
t-endt is back at right end after a period
at guard. Brice Taylor will probably
start at running guard after being on the
bench at the start of every game to date,
while A1 Schaub was being tried out.
Ted Gorrell is a fixture at standing
guard. Morris Badgro, although severely
hurt in snagging passes against Occi
dental, will be back at left end. It ap
pears that the tackle duties will fall to
Ken Cox and Jesse Hibbs. starters in
every game to date.
The back field is a little unsettled in
the quarter-back position. Manuel Lar
aneta will play full-back. Bert Heiser
is to be stationed at inside half. These
two gridsters went through practically
every minute of the Oxy game last Sat
urday without an injury. Morley Drury
starts at outside half and will call sig
nals as he has done in nearly every game
this season and several contests last year.
The quarter-back will be either Don Wil
liams or Morten Kaer, with the former
the favorite.
With this line-up, the Trojans have
been going through hard scrimmage every
evening this week. Jones brought a num
ber of California tactics south with him
and spent an entire afternoon tutoring
the reserves in these plays and methods.
He then turned the Spartans loose against
the regulars and paled as the scrubs ram
bled up and down the field with the Bear
plays. The varsity was seemingly unable
to stop the advances.
The Trojan team leaves Thursday eve
ning for Berkeley. The following men
make the trip: Heiser, Drury, Laranta,
Thompson, Orsatti, Lee, Behrendt, Cra
vath, Friend, Hibbs, Cox, Hershbcrger.
Gorrell..Schaub, Dorsey, Taylor, Fox, M.
Thomas, White, Elliott, L. Thomas,
Beattie, Moser, Morrison, Williams, Mc-
Caslin, DeGroote, Kaer, Baldridge, Bad
gro, Wheeler, Lavelle, Scheving, Bonham,
Ford and Cruickshank.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.—With old
injuries healing rapidly and no new ones
cropping forth, it is probable that the
entire strength of the University of
Southern California will be presented
against the Golden Bears of California,
Saturday afternoon. Neither Jeff Cra
vath, center, nor Morley Drury, half, were
used against Occidental because of bad
leg injuries. Brice Taylor, Kenneth Cox,
and Morton Kaer, who were on the hos
pital list, got into the fray and the rough
and tumble failed to aggravate their in
juries.
Coast Jones had his regular starting
line-up together now and has done away
with the temporary shifts to which he had
to resort in the past two games. A1 Beh
t-endt is back at right end after a period
at guard. Brice Taylor will probably
start at running guard after being on the
bench at the start of every game to date,
while A1 Schaub was being tried out.
Ted Gorrell is a fixture at standing
guard. Morris Badgro, although severely
hurt in snagging passes against Occi
dental, will be back at left end. It ap
pears that the tackle duties will fall to
Ken Cox and Jesse Hibbs. starters in
every game to date.
The back field is a little unsettled in
the quarter-back position. Manuel Lar
aneta will play full-back. Bert Heiser
is to be stationed at inside half. These
two gridsters went through practically
every minute of the Oxy game last Sat
urday without an injury. Morley Drury
starts at outside half and will call sig
nals as he has done in nearly every game
this season and several contests last year.
The quarter-back will be either Don Wil
liams or Morten Kaer, with the former
the favorite.
With this line-up, the Trojans have
been going through hard scrimmage every
evening this week. Jones brought a num
ber of California tactics south with him
and spent an entire afternoon tutoring
the reserves in these plays and methods.
He then turned the Spartans loose against
the regulars and paled as the scrubs ram
bled up and down the field with the Bear
plays. The varsity was seemingly unable
to stop the advances.
The Trojan team leaves Thursday eve
ning for Berkeley. The following men
make the trip: Heiser, Drury, Laranta,
Thompson, Orsatti, Lee, Behrendt, Cra
vath, Friend, Hibbs, Cox, Hershbcrger.
Gorrell..Schaub, Dorsey, Taylor, Fox, M.
Thomas, White, Elliott, L. Thomas,
Beattie, Moser, Morrison, Williams, Mc-
Caslin, DeGroote, Kaer, Baldridge, Bad
gro, Wheeler, Lavelle, Scheving, Bonham,
