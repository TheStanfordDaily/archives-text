# ICE CREAM FACTORY OPENED BY STANFORD UNION LAST MONDAY
## 
### 
The Stanford Union, under the di
rection of Miss Handy, opened Mon
day an ice cream plant for the service
of Stanford organizations. Fresh fruits
and real juices only will be used in
making the creams so that orange ice
cream will taste like orange ice cream
and not suggest artificial flavoring.
All the machinery has been in
stalled. The freezer is of the finest
type and will hold ten gallons at a
time. When the cream is frozen it has
the consistency of taffy syrup and it
•is then poured out into cans. The re
serve cream in the tray above the
freezing barrel is then let down into
.the machine.
Brine maintains the right tempera
ture within the freezer. A new noise
less machine to operate the brine tank
has been installed.
Large Output Expected
The cream before it has been fla
vored and frozen is kept in a room at
30 degrees above zero. Frozen cream
is kept in a room at zero degrees tem
perature. This room has a capacity of
holding 100 gallons, which is expected
to be the daily output.
It has been estimated that 2000 gal
lons of i>p oream is used by the dining
halls of campus organizations in a
month. The creams will be sold to
these nearly at cost. The Union hopes
to save the dining halls money by this
plan.
New Cream Developed
A new cream has been developed
which contains bananas and the juices
of oranges and lemons. The cream has
not yet been given a Stanford name
and plans are being made for a con
test in which names will be suggested.
Fancy molds for the caterers to the
social doings are being planned. Fancy
bricks will be made in the near future.
This plant will be for the service
of the campus trade only, although it
may be able to serve the faculty and
residents of the campus at a later
time.
