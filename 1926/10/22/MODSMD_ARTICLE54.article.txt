Human Element Important
The human element must be given
its proper place in the development of
industry and this will come about
through the education and training of
industrial leaders, said Dean Hotch
kiss in his speech yesterday. "While
the Pacific Coast has not yet gone
very far on the road to industrial
civilization, there are signs of a swing
toward industry in the offing and our
sons and daughters will have to face
the problems which industry always
brings in its train," he said. "This de
velopment is bound to come relatively
soon, and the fact is of great moment
in our educational planning," he con
tinued.
.... .
If in some way we can dilute the
emotions that industrial situations en
gender with a spirit of science we
sjiall have gone far toward solution of
many human problems," said Dr.
Hotchkiss, and added that "we must
learn how to seek out our likenesses,
our common interests, instead of mag
nifying our differences." He said that,
the greatest obstacles in the way of
thoughtfully considering the human
element in our plans when we' go
about a further upbuilding of Pacific
Coast industry, are prejudice, strong
emotions, rhetoric, and politics.
The speaker discussed the unem
ployment problem at length and con
cluded that stability is the only base
upon which satisfactory human rela
tions can be built in any enterprise.

sity of Oregon, spoke yesterday on
"The Pioneer Stage in the History of
the University of Oregon, 1572-1855."
Human Element Important
The human element must be given
its proper place in the development of
industry and this will come about
through the education and training of
industrial leaders, said Dean Hotch
kiss in his speech yesterday. "While
the Pacific Coast has not yet gone
very far on the road to industrial
civilization, there are signs of a swing
toward industry in the offing and our
sons and daughters will have to face
the problems which industry always
brings in its train," he said. "This de
velopment is bound to come relatively
soon, and the fact is of great moment
in our educational planning," he con
tinued.
.... .
If in some way we can dilute the
emotions that industrial situations en
gender with a spirit of science we
sjiall have gone far toward solution of
many human problems," said Dr.
Hotchkiss, and added that "we must
learn how to seek out our likenesses,
our common interests, instead of mag
nifying our differences." He said that,
the greatest obstacles in the way of
thoughtfully considering the human
element in our plans when we' go
about a further upbuilding of Pacific
Coast industry, are prejudice, strong
emotions, rhetoric, and politics.
The speaker discussed the unem
ployment problem at length and con
cluded that stability is the only base
upon which satisfactory human rela
tions can be built in any enterprise.
