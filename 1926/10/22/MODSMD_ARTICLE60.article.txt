### 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, Oct. 21.
—P.l.P.) —The Honor System has been
unofficially dropped as an institution at
Southern California, [fending further in
vestigation in its behalf by the joint ef
forts of student welfare and administra
tion committees. As a matter of fact,
the old regime of faculty vigilance re
sumed its former role this week with the
advent of the mid-term examinations, and
unheralded by protests of any sort. About
the only conclusion so far determined is
that the faculty will continue to conduct
"business as usual."
