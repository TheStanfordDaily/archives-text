# GRAVEURE, BARITONE, IS CLAIMED AS MOST VERSATILE ARTIST
## 
### 
Louis Graveure, the eminent baritone
who will sing here October 28 in the
opening recital of the A.S.S.U. concert
series is said by those who know him to
be the most versatile singer ever known
to the concert stage.
In saying this these people do not refer
to the fact that Mr. Graveure sings in
many languages, or that his programs in
clude operatic selections, folk songs,
classical songs and even humorous songs.
Mr. Graveure's versatility is expressed
best by himselfâ€”"l am a jack-of-all
trades and, I sincerely hope, a master of
one."
The experiences and education of most
singers is one-sided because their fac
ulties are discovered early and they spend
the rest of their time in singing and
nothing else. Mr. Graveure was given a
thorough education and was preparing
for a life work in sculpture when a series
of events occurred.
His voice slid down gradually from
the treble of childhood to what was vir
tually a basso profundo. He was ap
proaching early manhood when, at the
insistence of his friends that his voice
was the best of his natural gifts, he left
England, where he had been studying,
to take up voice training in France and
Germany.
Mr. Graveure was just on the point of
starting his first concert tour as a bass
baritone when he was stricken with diph
theria. When he came out of a long
convalescence his voice was gone. For
months after this disaster he did nothing.
Then, feeling that he would grow mad if
he stayed in civilized centers and listened
to other singers much longer, he struck
out for foreign parts.
After many adventures in all parts of
the world, Graveure decided to come to
Canada. On the trip over from the old
country his voice returned, and after
careful training by a method of his own
the singer was able to finally succeed in
his desire and go on the concert stage.
In 1915 in America he began his suc
cessful career which has made a name
for him in the musical circles of the
world.
