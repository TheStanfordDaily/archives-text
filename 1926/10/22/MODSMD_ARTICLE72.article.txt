# STANFORD POLOISTS TO PLAY ARMY MEN IN RETURN CONTEST
## Cardinal Squad Determined To Defeat Ninth Corps Areans Tomorrow 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
Meeting the Ninth Corps Area polo
squad in a second game tomorrow at 3
o'clock, the Stanford poloists will attempt
to even the series. The last game, won
by the Army, 9-4, was close during most
of the first half.
Followers of Stanford polo were both
surprised and pleased with the showing
of the varsity squad. Their playing was
brilliant in spots, and with practice and
concentration on offense, the team should
develop into a fast, hard-riding, winning
aggregation. Meeting a team considered
to be among the best this side of the
Rockies is a hard barrier for even an ex
perienced squad to overcome, and the re
sult of Wednesday's contest is bright
promise for the future.
With the advantages gained from
knowing the style of play of the visitors,
the squad should come forth with an even
more creditable showing tomorrow. Dur
ing the first half of the last game, the
Redshirts held the Army men nearly even,
staging drive after drive down the field
in flashes of clever riding and shooting.
It was the last two chukkers which
spelled a decisive defeat for the homL Y
team, for they seemed to slump into
mediocrity, with no apparent excuse.
Post, the transfer from New Mexico
Military Institute, was the most active
man on the field, working smoothly on
offense, and showing remarkable defen
sive cleverness. His talents would seem
to point to more effectiveness at No. 2.
although Thompson now seems certain of
the berth. The latter's showing Wednes
day was jerky and uneven, hut his good
moments were very good. Consistency
will make him invaluable, for his riding
is above par now. >
Brown, lately shifted to No. 4 from
No. 1, where he ■ alternated with Krohn
last year, played a stellar game at goal.
His blocking and recovery shots were
well timed. Many prospective Army
scores were broken up with the ball
inches from the goal line by Brown's
speedy rushes.
Weymouth, at No. 1, although not mak
ing an impressive showing, has plenty of
promise. He is starting in the position
Saturday and may be looked to for better
work. His riding is daring, and he fol
lows his man like a hawk, often riding
him off out of the play. Krohn, who
went in during the latter part of the con
test, is also good at No. 1, where he
usually started last year. He showed
plenty of fight while in.
Austin, Connolly, Rothrock, and Evans,
substitutes, are well qualified to step into
the shoes of nearly any man on the squad.
Their only fault at present is inexperi
ence. Evans, another transfer, is rather
an unknown quantity on the field, but his
showing in practice has been good.

ing an impressive showing, has plenty of
promise. He is starting in the position
Saturday and may be looked to for better
work. His riding is daring, and he fol
lows his man like a hawk, often riding
him off out of the play. Krohn, who
went in during the latter part of the con
test, is also good at No. 1, where he
usually started last year. He showed
plenty of fight while in.
Austin, Connolly, Rothrock, and Evans,
substitutes, are well qualified to step into
the shoes of nearly any man on the squad.
Their only fault at present is inexperi
ence. Evans, another transfer, is rather
an unknown quantity on the field, but his
showing in practice has been good.
Meeting the Ninth Corps Area polo
squad in a second game tomorrow at 3
o'clock, the Stanford poloists will attempt
to even the series. The last game, won
by the Army, 9-4, was close during most
of the first half.
Followers of Stanford polo were both
surprised and pleased with the showing
of the varsity squad. Their playing was
brilliant in spots, and with practice and
concentration on offense, the team should
develop into a fast, hard-riding, winning
aggregation. Meeting a team considered
to be among the best this side of the
Rockies is a hard barrier for even an ex
perienced squad to overcome, and the re
sult of Wednesday's contest is bright
promise for the future.
With the advantages gained from
knowing the style of play of the visitors,
the squad should come forth with an even
more creditable showing tomorrow. Dur
ing the first half of the last game, the
Redshirts held the Army men nearly even,
staging drive after drive down the field
in flashes of clever riding and shooting.
It was the last two chukkers which
spelled a decisive defeat for the homL Y
team, for they seemed to slump into
mediocrity, with no apparent excuse.
Post, the transfer from New Mexico
Military Institute, was the most active
man on the field, working smoothly on
offense, and showing remarkable defen
sive cleverness. His talents would seem
to point to more effectiveness at No. 2.
although Thompson now seems certain of
the berth. The latter's showing Wednes
day was jerky and uneven, hut his good
moments were very good. Consistency
will make him invaluable, for his riding
is above par now. >
Brown, lately shifted to No. 4 from
No. 1, where he ■ alternated with Krohn
last year, played a stellar game at goal.
His blocking and recovery shots were
well timed. Many prospective Army
scores were broken up with the ball
inches from the goal line by Brown's
speedy rushes.
Weymouth, at No. 1, although not mak
ing an impressive showing, has plenty of
promise. He is starting in the position
Saturday and may be looked to for better
work. His riding is daring, and he fol
lows his man like a hawk, often riding
