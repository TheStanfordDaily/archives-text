# HISTORICAL RESEARCH DISCUSSED IN TALK BY FRANK A. GOLDER
## Real Issues Must Be Defined; Initiative Necessary to Uncover Facts 
### 
I"The student engaged in the work of
j historical research," said Dr. Frank A.
, Golder last night in his lecture before
! the first meeting of the History Club, "is
j in reality a prospector in search of gold.
He is constantly seeking the unknown,
and digging out the hidden facts—a life
work which is at once enticing and
worthwhile.
"Research calls for distinctive quali
ties without which the student may
j flounder hopelessly, losing sight of the
real issue. The most important of these
qualities is initiative—the ability to work
alone without the teacher's guidance.
"And, having once uncovered the
facts, the student must have the ability
ito interpret them, subjectively not ob
jectively. Herein lies the most important
: work of all, and the most difficult. It is
upon this interpretation that the real
J value of research work depends. It is
one thing to uncover the facts; but it is
still another to read between the lines
and seek out the truth."
Dr. Golder urged those students who
| felt that they lacked the required quali
j ties necessary for research work, to go
[into other equally productive fields of
j work, such as teaching or writing. He
warned the mthat the student who, unfit
for research, persists in that field, will
find his work dull and uninteresting, be
sides denying himself the chance to ex
cel in some line of work for which he is
better fitted.
"Social science workers," continued
Dr. Golder, "must never allow them
selves to lose contact with the rest of the
world. History deals with human beings
and to properly understand the events of
the past it is imperative that the research
worker have a thorough knowledge of
human nature. It is necessary that the
student be a great reader, not in his own
fields, but others—poetry, prose, econ
omics, or any such broadening subject.
"Now is the time to read, while yet a
student. For later the worker in research
will find his time too fully occupied.
This broadening will help him at a later
time in his teaching, or writing. Irre
spective of the amount of work at hand
at the present time, the worker must
find time somewhere to broaden his
knowledge of other fields."
Among other things, Golder suggested
that the worker refrain from taking his
problems to his teacher unless absolutely
necessary, as the teacher himself is usu
ally busy with research work and other
matters of his, own, while the student by
working out his own problems will ulti
mately develop his initiative to a far
greater extent.
Following Dr. Golder's address, an in
formal discussion was held in which the
members presented questions.
