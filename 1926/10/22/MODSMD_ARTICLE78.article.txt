"From all indications, the 1927 var
sity tennis team will be the strongest
in the history of the college," said Hal
Davis, tennis coach, yesterday.
"In previous years," he continued,
"we have had individual stars of great
ability, but never before have we had
such a large number of really high
class players. In addition four of the
five members of the team which last
year defeated California for the first
time in fourteen years are back
again."
Captain-elect Cranston Holman,
eighth ranking national player, heads
the varsity team, with Alan Herring
ton, Oregon State and Southern Cali
fornia singles champion, next. Lionel
Ogden, former captain and co-holder
with Holman of many doubles honors
won in the East last summer, holds
third place, followed by Ralph Mc-
Elvenny, Intermountain and Colorado
State titleholder.
To bulwark this combination there
is fine material available in Gomer
Thomas, Frank Dunn, John Wheatley,
Ernest Renzel, and David Robb.
Thomas and Dunn ranked sixth and
seventh respectively on the squad last
year, and with hard practice may dis
lodge any of the veterans. Wheatley,
Renzel, and Robb, all from the '29
freshman team which won a v'.ctory
over the Bruin babes, complete the
strong reserve.
