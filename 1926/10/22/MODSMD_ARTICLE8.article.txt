# SCIENCE FURTHERS HAPPINESS, STATES JORDAN IN LECTURE
## Fundamental Opposition for War Declared Belief Of Most Savants

"Although a great deal of the work
of science has been prosituted in war
fever, it is only a trifle of what science
has done compared with the inestima

with a shot in him was worth about
as much as a coin with a hole in it.
Now scientists have turned to help
physicians save the lives of wounded
soldiers who would have been deserted
by the roadside to die in Napoleon's
era."

Continuing, Dr. Jordan said, "Chem
istry as a part of medicine has done
