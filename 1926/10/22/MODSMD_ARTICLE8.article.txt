# SCIENCE FURTHERS HAPPINESS, STATES JORDAN IN LECTURE
## Fundamental Opposition for War Declared Belief Of Most Savants 
### 
"Although a great deal of the work
of science has been prosituted in war
fever, it is only a trifle of what science
has done compared with the inestima
ble go'>d it has achieved in the fur
therance of human happiness," said
Dr. Jordan in his lecture last night in
discussing the "Menace to Science."
"Practically all scientists," declared
Dr. Jordan, "are opposed to war. In
fact, the world is full of scientific men
who would suffer punishment rather
than manufacture implements of war."
In refuting the argument advanced
by many people that science is a men
ace, Dr. Jordan gave a summary of the
good work done by science in other
fields.
"In the time of Napoleon," said Dr.
Jordan, discussing the accomplish
ments of medical science, "a soldier
with a shot in him was worth about
as much as a coin with a hole in it.
Now scientists have turned to help
physicians save the lives of wounded
soldiers who would have been deserted
by the roadside to die in Napoleon's
era."

Continuing, Dr. Jordan said, "Chem
istry as a part of medicine has done
much in preventing the spread and
facilitating the cure of such infectious
diseases as smallpox, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, and typhoid. It would be
impossible for Stanford to exist today
without vaccination requirements.
There was a time when the old uni
versities of Europe would not admit
students who had not had smallpox,
because it was impossible to prevent
its spread even in college communi
ties."
Answering the question, "Is science
taking away the poetry of life?" Dr.
Jordan declared, "It is not fair to say
' that science has caused a decline in
poetry or art. There is not a poet in
the world who could have been pre
vented from being one by either sci
ence or scientists.
Scientists Versatile
"Although some scientists such as
Darwin lost all taste for literature, art,
and music, it was because they de
voted all their interest to one great
subject. On the other hand, there were
men such as Goethe who were both
scientists and poets," added Dr. Jor
dan.
Another question discussed by Dr.
Jordan was, "Is science destroying re
ligious beliefs?" In reply to this, Dr.
Jordan said, "I do not think science
has destroyed any fundamental beliefs
of true religion. The many so-called
religious beliefs that it has displaced
were not worth believing, anyhow."
Concluding his talk, Dr. Jordan
stated, "All we know of right and
wrong comes from science. The wick
edest things man ever did were done
with a clear conscience, because a
conscience is not worth much until it
is trained and set in order, and when
that is done we won't feel morally free
to burn witches and torture heretics."

facilitating the cure of such infectious
diseases as smallpox, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, and typhoid. It would be
impossible for Stanford to exist today
without vaccination requirements.
There was a time when the old uni
versities of Europe would not admit
students who had not had smallpox,
because it was impossible to prevent
its spread even in college communi
ties."
Answering the question, "Is science
taking away the poetry of life?" Dr.
Jordan declared, "It is not fair to say
' that science has caused a decline in
poetry or art. There is not a poet in
the world who could have been pre
vented from being one by either sci
ence or scientists.
Scientists Versatile
"Although some scientists such as
Darwin lost all taste for literature, art,
and music, it was because they de
voted all their interest to one great
subject. On the other hand, there were
men such as Goethe who were both
scientists and poets," added Dr. Jor
dan.
Another question discussed by Dr.
Jordan was, "Is science destroying re
ligious beliefs?" In reply to this, Dr.
Jordan said, "I do not think science
has destroyed any fundamental beliefs
of true religion. The many so-called
religious beliefs that it has displaced
were not worth believing, anyhow."
Concluding his talk, Dr. Jordan
stated, "All we know of right and
wrong comes from science. The wick
edest things man ever did were done
with a clear conscience, because a
conscience is not worth much until it
is trained and set in order, and when
that is done we won't feel morally free
to burn witches and torture heretics."

"Although a great deal of the work
of science has been prosituted in war
fever, it is only a trifle of what science
has done compared with the inestima
ble go'>d it has achieved in the fur
therance of human happiness," said
Dr. Jordan in his lecture last night in
discussing the "Menace to Science."
"Practically all scientists," declared
Dr. Jordan, "are opposed to war. In
fact, the world is full of scientific men
who would suffer punishment rather
than manufacture implements of war."
In refuting the argument advanced
by many people that science is a men
ace, Dr. Jordan gave a summary of the
good work done by science in other
fields.
"In the time of Napoleon," said Dr.
Jordan, discussing the accomplish
ments of medical science, "a soldier
with a shot in him was worth about
as much as a coin with a hole in it.
Now scientists have turned to help
physicians save the lives of wounded
soldiers who would have been deserted
by the roadside to die in Napoleon's
era."
Chemistry Valuable
Continuing, Dr. Jordan said, "Chem
istry as a part of medicine has done
much in preventing the spread and
facilitating the cure of such infectious
diseases as smallpox, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, and typhoid. It would be
impossible for Stanford to exist today
without vaccination requirements.
