# RALLY SENDS VARSITY OFF TO OREGON SMILING O'DONNELL-CRILEY SKIT CONVULSES LARGE CROWD HARDY L. "BOOM" DRUMM RECALLS OLD TIMES
## 
### 
The varsity left for Oregon yester
day afternoon with a smile on "each
and every" face, for the twenty-six
gridders making the trip were cheered
to the last echo of the puffing engine
as it steamed away. Nearly half the
atudent body thronged about the Palo
Alto station as the local train drew up
at 5-J 9, and a great roar arose as
Stanford's best boarded the rear car.
It all began at the Engineering Cor
ner at 3:45 o'clock. The O'Donnell-
Criley skit, "Pyle's Peerless Perform
ing Professionals," convulsed men, wo
men, and children, with Hock Chal
mers, A1 Cass, and Delmer Daves
:sbaring honors in the rendition of the
lines. Chalmers as "Cash and Carry"
kept the. show always moving with his
-spiel as interlocutor.
A1 Cass was called upon for a ver
satile performance and succeeded well
in impersonating Rodney St. Clair,
"world's champion pole-finder," Red
Grange, the Wheaton ice man, Gene
Tunney, Grover Cleveland Alexander,
and Professor Grapefruit, "all-Ameri
can Mr. America," pronounced by Ber
narr McFadden and Aimee Semple Mc-
Pherson America's most perfect male
specimen.
"Boom" Drumm was on hand, too.
I

) The venerable alumnus was whisked
up from Palo Alto in a taxi, accom-
I panied by J. E. McDowell, alumni
j secretary, who introduced him.
j "Boom" proved to be a trinity, for in
addition to being himself he was Del
mer Daves as a speaking likeness of
Theodore Roosevelt. Every one of his
gags crashed through for a laugh, and
the assemblage broke up with a cheer
for the intrepid huntsman who flew,
| swam, sailed, and otherwise made his
j way across the seven seas to spur on
j his Alma Mater.
Fully 2000 must have seen the skit
at the Engineering Corner. Nearly all
jof the crowd followed "Boom" and
| the band to the station for the send
, off. While the rooters were waiting
; there for the train to come in, Pop
Warner ascended the mail truck and
spoke a few gloomy words for the
team.
"They haven't played football yet,"
Pop said. "When they turn loose they
will be seen to be a good team, but
; l hey have shown no real strength yet."
Fred Swan predicted that the squad
would bring home the bacon next
Monday. That was all he would say,
except that he reaffirmed Warner's
sentiment.
Bob Fraser, Cass, and Bob Frazee I
kept the air well-filled with yells and j
songs. Fraser accompanied the team j
on its northern trip.

for the intrepid huntsman who flew,

j way across the seven seas to spur on

Fully 2000 must have seen the skit
at the Engineering Corner. Nearly all
jof the crowd followed "Boom" and

, off. While the rooters were waiting
; there for the train to come in, Pop
Warner ascended the mail truck and
spoke a few gloomy words for the
team.
"They haven't played football yet,"
Pop said. "When they turn loose they
will be seen to be a good team, but
; l hey have shown no real strength yet."
Fred Swan predicted that the squad
would bring home the bacon next
Monday. That was all he would say,
except that he reaffirmed Warner's
sentiment.
Bob Fraser, Cass, and Bob Frazee I
kept the air well-filled with yells and j
songs. Fraser accompanied the team j
on its northern trip.
The varsity left for Oregon yester
day afternoon with a smile on "each
and every" face, for the twenty-six
gridders making the trip were cheered
to the last echo of the puffing engine
as it steamed away. Nearly half the
atudent body thronged about the Palo
Alto station as the local train drew up
at 5-J 9, and a great roar arose as
Stanford's best boarded the rear car.
It all began at the Engineering Cor
ner at 3:45 o'clock. The O'Donnell-
Criley skit, "Pyle's Peerless Perform
ing Professionals," convulsed men, wo
men, and children, with Hock Chal
mers, A1 Cass, and Delmer Daves
:sbaring honors in the rendition of the
lines. Chalmers as "Cash and Carry"
kept the. show always moving with his
-spiel as interlocutor.
A1 Cass was called upon for a ver
satile performance and succeeded well
in impersonating Rodney St. Clair,
"world's champion pole-finder," Red
Grange, the Wheaton ice man, Gene
Tunney, Grover Cleveland Alexander,
and Professor Grapefruit, "all-Ameri
can Mr. America," pronounced by Ber
narr McFadden and Aimee Semple Mc-
Pherson America's most perfect male
specimen.
