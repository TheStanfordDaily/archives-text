# CASTING, REHEARSALS FOR FOOTBALL SHOW TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Acts submitted for the football show
yesterday and Wednesday have been
more than enough to insure an extremely
versatile and original production, declare
members of the show committee. A full
quota of long acts has been received
but a few more short skits arc wanted
by Delmer Daves before the hnal selec
tion is made next week.
Rehearsals and casting of the large
number of people who will lie needed for
the show will begin by the middle of next
week. All ideas for acts or dances are to
lie in completed form by next Monday
afternoon.
Jack Ross has been chosen assistant
musical director. Gordon Hall, director,
stated last night that more than enough
music had been turned in. The numbers
submitted have proved to be above the
committee's expectations, and at this
time it seems probable that one or two
first-class hits will have to be held for
later shows.
Rehearsal tryouts will be announced
next week.
