"TROUBLE AHEAD, TROJANS!" Every man that can
beg or borrow a ride should be in the Coliseum at the
kick-off. From that minute until the final gun let "Pop's"
gang know that you are depending on them to bring north
the bacon. And they'll do it!
NOTE: Wideman's have the suits and
topcoats that will make you as proud of
yourself as you are of the team! Banff

new tones. Come in early this week.
