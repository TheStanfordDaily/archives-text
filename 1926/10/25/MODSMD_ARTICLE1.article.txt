# CARD POLOISTS DOWN ARMY IN RETURN MATCH
## Both Teams Play Smoother Game Than in Contest Wednesday REDSHIRTS RIDE HARD Airtight Defense Feature of Game During Fifth, Sixth Chukkers 
### F.W. M 
Playing much smoother polo than
they exhibited Wednesday, the Stan
ford poloists met the Ninth Corps
Area four Saturday afternoon in a
return game and emerged on the long
end of a 6 to 4 score.
Both teams played a much faster
game than they did in the first game
of the series, bumping their opponents
hard and frequently. The first half
was all Army, and the Redshirts were
riding hard to keep the officers' scores
down to three.
Army Scores Three
Two goals were scored by Lieuten
ant Snyder while Captain Dierking
made the third score. The first half
ended with Stanford ahead, four to
three, since the Presidio aggregation
has a four-goal handicap team by the
American Polo Association ruling.
The Cardinals started the fourth
chukker with a rush down the field by
Post and Thompson, followed by a goal
made by Thompson. In another whirl
wind attack, Captain Scott of the
Army sent the ball over his own
goal-line for a safety. Post took the
free shot and drove the ball through
the entire Army team for Stanford's
second tally.
Defense Good
Air-tight defense by both teams was
the outstanding feature of the fifth
and sixth chukkers. One goal was
made in the sixth by Lieutenant Sny
der. After the game, Major Rucker
congratulated the Redshirts on their
clean sportsmanship and rough-and
ready style of polo. Considering the
mounts used by Stanford, he marveled
at the ability shown by the team.
Major Rucker said that he was very
pleased at the cordial feeling between
the officers and students and is eager
for more games either to be played
here or at the Presidio field, San Fran
cisco.
