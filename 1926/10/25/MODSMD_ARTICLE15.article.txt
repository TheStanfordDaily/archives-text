# CONFERENCE WINNERS FALL BEFORE RIVALS IN IMPORTANT UPSET
## Trojans Tear Through Bears On All Types of Play, Passes Succeed 
### Jim Adams 
As one of the many football upsets 1
over the country at large, the Univer-1
sity of Washington, 1925 Pacific Coast
Champions, fell before their tradition
al rivals, Washington State, Saturday,
by a 9 to 6 score, thereby narrowing
the undefeated coast conference teams
down to three, Stanford, U.S.C., and 1
the Oregon Aggies. The former two
elevens kept Oregon University and
California, respectively, at the bottom •
of the percentage column, while the
Oregon Aggies drew a bye.
Butch Meeker Stars
The fall of last year's
before the Cougars came as a big sur- j
prise, although Coach Hollingsberry'
has been heralded as doing great j
things with the eleven that first came ,
into the limelight last year by beating
the highly touted Trojans. The victory |
of Washington State was in no small
way attributable to one individual,
Butch Meeker, the same man who was
the nemesis of U.S.C. in their defeat.
Meeker ran, passed, and kicked his
way in leading the Cougars to victory.
By its achievement on Saturday,
Washington State wins the reputation
of being the best "surprise-springing"
eleven in the Conference.
As was expected, the Trojans took
sweet revenge on the Bears for a pre
vious long list of California victories
by running up a 27 to 0 score on the
helpless Blue and Gold team. In the
first half California put up a gallant
defense and held their superior oppon
ents to one touchdown. The Bears
weakened, however, in the last half
before the sweeping end runs and suc
cessful passes of the Trojans and the
men from the South ran up the score
with a vengeance.
U.S.C. Needs Bucker
Southern California showed clearly
that they have no line-bucker when
the Bears held them on the 3-yard line
for four downs. The Trojan signal
caller showed poor judgment on the
above occasion but learned his lesson
and the next approach to the goal line
i was finished off by an end run. U.S.C.
