# CONFERENCE WINNERS FALL BEFORE RIVALS IN IMPORTANT UPSET
## Trojans Tear Through Bears On All Types of Play, Passes Succeed 
### Jim Adams 
As one of the many football upsets 1
over the country at large, the Univer-1
sity of Washington, 1925 Pacific Coast
Champions, fell before their tradition
al rivals, Washington State, Saturday,
by a 9 to 6 score, thereby narrowing
the undefeated coast conference teams
down to three, Stanford, U.S.C., and 1
the Oregon Aggies. The former two
elevens kept Oregon University and
California, respectively, at the bottom •
of the percentage column, while the
Oregon Aggies drew a bye.
Butch Meeker Stars
The fall of last year's
before the Cougars came as a big sur- j
prise, although Coach Hollingsberry'
has been heralded as doing great j
things with the eleven that first came ,
into the limelight last year by beating
the highly touted Trojans. The victory |
of Washington State was in no small
way attributable to one individual,
Butch Meeker, the same man who was
the nemesis of U.S.C. in their defeat.
Meeker ran, passed, and kicked his
way in leading the Cougars to victory.
By its achievement on Saturday,
Washington State wins the reputation
of being the best "surprise-springing"
eleven in the Conference.
As was expected, the Trojans took
sweet revenge on the Bears for a pre
vious long list of California victories
by running up a 27 to 0 score on the
helpless Blue and Gold team. In the
first half California put up a gallant
defense and held their superior oppon
ents to one touchdown. The Bears
weakened, however, in the last half
before the sweeping end runs and suc
cessful passes of the Trojans and the
men from the South ran up the score
with a vengeance.
U.S.C. Needs Bucker
Southern California showed clearly
that they have no line-bucker when
the Bears held them on the 3-yard line
for four downs. The Trojan signal
caller showed poor judgment on the
above occasion but learned his lesson
and the next approach to the goal line
i was finished off by an end run. U.S.C.
completed 15 forward passes from!
various combinations which California j
seemed powerless to combat. Even the j
old Statue of Liberty play was called
into action and resulted in several
long runs by the Trojan backs. Cali
fornia played defensive ball through
out but in spite of splendid work on
the part of their two young ends, Ban
croft and Phillips, U.S.C., gained con- !
sistently by sweeping flank plays with
interference in surplus. Kaer and j
Laraneta were the chief yardage gain-!
ers for the victors and Badgro looked
good on the receiving end of a number
of passes. Drury, star halfback, was
out of the game with a twisted knee
cap.
Cards Slow to Start
In a none too-impressive showing
the Cards beat Oregon, 29 to 12, after
the Webfooters held a 12 to 9 lead
on them at the half time. Warner's
men as usual were slow starting but
came back in the second half to make
three touchdowns. Hoffman was the
star of the game, turning in 107 yards
for individual distance gained.
Montana did not play a conference I
game but succeeded in beating an old 1
rival, Montana State, 27 to 0. Idaho
also beat a non-conference team, the i
College of Idaho, 30 to 0.

way in leading the Cougars to victory.
By its achievement on Saturday,
Washington State wins the reputation
of being the best "surprise-springing"
eleven in the Conference.
As was expected, the Trojans took
sweet revenge on the Bears for a pre
vious long list of California victories
by running up a 27 to 0 score on the
helpless Blue and Gold team. In the
first half California put up a gallant
defense and held their superior oppon
ents to one touchdown. The Bears
weakened, however, in the last half
before the sweeping end runs and suc
cessful passes of the Trojans and the
men from the South ran up the score
with a vengeance.
U.S.C. Needs Bucker
Southern California showed clearly
that they have no line-bucker when
the Bears held them on the 3-yard line
for four downs. The Trojan signal
caller showed poor judgment on the
above occasion but learned his lesson
and the next approach to the goal line
i was finished off by an end run. U.S.C.
completed 15 forward passes from!
various combinations which California j
seemed powerless to combat. Even the j
old Statue of Liberty play was called
into action and resulted in several
long runs by the Trojan backs. Cali
fornia played defensive ball through
out but in spite of splendid work on
the part of their two young ends, Ban
croft and Phillips, U.S.C., gained con- !
sistently by sweeping flank plays with
interference in surplus. Kaer and j
Laraneta were the chief yardage gain-!
ers for the victors and Badgro looked
good on the receiving end of a number
of passes. Drury, star halfback, was
out of the game with a twisted knee
cap.
Cards Slow to Start
In a none too-impressive showing
the Cards beat Oregon, 29 to 12, after
the Webfooters held a 12 to 9 lead
on them at the half time. Warner's
men as usual were slow starting but
came back in the second half to make
three touchdowns. Hoffman was the
star of the game, turning in 107 yards
for individual distance gained.
Montana did not play a conference I
game but succeeded in beating an old 1
rival, Montana State, 27 to 0. Idaho
also beat a non-conference team, the i
College of Idaho, 30 to 0.
As one of the many football upsets 1
over the country at large, the Univer-1
sity of Washington, 1925 Pacific Coast
Champions, fell before their tradition
al rivals, Washington State, Saturday,
by a 9 to 6 score, thereby narrowing
the undefeated coast conference teams
down to three, Stanford, U.S.C., and 1
the Oregon Aggies. The former two
elevens kept Oregon University and
California, respectively, at the bottom •
of the percentage column, while the
Oregon Aggies drew a bye.
Butch Meeker Stars
The fall of last year's
before the Cougars came as a big sur- j
prise, although Coach Hollingsberry'
has been heralded as doing great j
things with the eleven that first came ,
into the limelight last year by beating
the highly touted Trojans. The victory |
of Washington State was in no small
way attributable to one individual,
Butch Meeker, the same man who was
the nemesis of U.S.C. in their defeat.
Meeker ran, passed, and kicked his
way in leading the Cougars to victory.
