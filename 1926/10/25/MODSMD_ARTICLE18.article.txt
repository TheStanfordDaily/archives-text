UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eu
gene, Oct. 23. —On the short end of a
12 to 9 score at the end of the first
half, the Stanford varsity came hack
in the third and fourth quarters of the
Oregon Homecoming game on Hay
ward field, Saturday afternoon, and
defeated the Oregon eleven by a score
of 29 to 12, piling up 20 markers in
the second half and holding the Web
feet scoreless during the same period
of time.
The Cardinals played none too well
in the first half. Twice they dropped
forward passes when the field to a
touchdown was clear, and they al
lowed Oregon to throw passes over
their heads for steady gains.
Then, in the second half, just as
they did against Nevada, they found
themselves. Three touchdowns and
two successful tries for the extra point
mounted their total to 29 units, and
gave them the game in fairly easy
style.
Oregon Scores
Oregon tallied first. After a scoreless
first period the Lemon-Yellow squad
pushed over a touchdown one minute
after the opening of the second
stanza. A series of forward passes,
with Woodie on the throwing end and
Slauson, Ord, and Wetzel doing the
receiving, put the ball on Stanford's
three-yard line when the gun ended
