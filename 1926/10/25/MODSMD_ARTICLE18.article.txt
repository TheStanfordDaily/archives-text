UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eu
gene, Oct. 23. —On the short end of a
12 to 9 score at the end of the first
half, the Stanford varsity came hack
in the third and fourth quarters of the
Oregon Homecoming game on Hay
ward field, Saturday afternoon, and
defeated the Oregon eleven by a score
of 29 to 12, piling up 20 markers in
the second half and holding the Web
feet scoreless during the same period
of time.
The Cardinals played none too well
in the first half. Twice they dropped
forward passes when the field to a
touchdown was clear, and they al
lowed Oregon to throw passes over
their heads for steady gains.
Then, in the second half, just as
they did against Nevada, they found
themselves. Three touchdowns and
two successful tries for the extra point
mounted their total to 29 units, and
gave them the game in fairly easy
style.
Oregon Scores
Oregon tallied first. After a scoreless
first period the Lemon-Yellow squad
pushed over a touchdown one minute
after the opening of the second
stanza. A series of forward passes,
with Woodie on the throwing end and
Slauson, Ord, and Wetzel doing the
receiving, put the ball on Stanford's
three-yard line when the gun ended
the quarter. Lynn Jones, fullback, 1
j plunged over for six points on the
second play of the next period but the
! try for the extra point failed.
Stanford came back, and, aided by ,
numerous penalties, took the ball to
within scoring distance, and Hoffman '
smashed through for a touchdown..
Murphy kicked goal and Stanford was
leading 7 to 6.
On the ensuing kiclcoff Stanford
added two more markers to its credit, j
Hoffman booted the ball to Wetzel,
who took it on his own one-yard line.
He dropped it, however, and it rolled i
: across the gdai line. He, thinking it 1
was a toucliback, picked it up and !
j stood behind the goal line while Swan ;
I and Shipkey tackled him, giving the
Cardinals a safety and two points, [
j making the count 9 to 6.
I
Cards Weaken
Oregon, however, opened another
I overhead attack when they came into
; possesion of the ball shortly before
! the half ended, and the march resulted
| in a touchdown, Wetzel crossing the
; goal line after grabbing a pass from
Woodie. The kick again failed and
the Oregonians held a 12 to 9 lead at I
| half time.
Starting the second half with Hy- j
land and Bogue at the halfback berths, '
i the Stanford team came to life, as it I
seems to have a habit of doing in the
i second half of its games, and before i
; half of the third quarter had passed
1 Bogue and Hyland had each crossed
1 the goal line once. Bogue had kicked
one of the two goals and Warner's
| pupils were on the long end of a 22 to
12 score.
I
Hoffman Stars
! In the fourth quarter Hoffman drove
i his way through to another touch
j down and Bogue converted, making
the count 29 to 12, where it remained
during the closing minutes of the !
game.
Oregon did not have the ball more
j than six minutes during the second
j half, and in that tim» they ran only |

16 plays, most of which were either
punts or forward passes. In the same
length of time Stanford ran more than
60 plays.
Big Biff Hoffman was the star of
the game. He made 107 yards from
scrimmage, threw many accurate for
ward passes, punted well, and backed
up the line in great style. Hyland and
Bogue also featured on the offense,
and Shipkey, McCreery, and Harris
played good defensive games.
For Oregon, Wetzel and Jones did
good work in the backfleld and Hod
gen and Dixon were the strongest of
the linemen. The forward wall of the
Oregon machine was badly battered
in the second half and many substitu
tions were necessary.
The Stanford varsity will return to
the campus Monday afternoon. None
of the boys should be noticing any
major ailments, for they all came
through the game without serious in
juries. Warner was pleased with what
they showed. He expects them to make
a real fight against the Trojans next
Saturday at Los Angeles in what he
considers their acid test.
