# Meet Them Half Way
## 
### 
Leland "Dee" Tallman, president of the Associated Students of the
University of Southern California will speak at a men's assembly to
morrow morning' at 9 o'clock. Tallman's main object in talking 1 before a
Stanford meeting is to endeavor to promote a more friendly feeling
between the two institutions. No better time could be chosen for such
a campaign than this week—just four days before the two universities
meet on the gridiron.
Good sportsmanship was demonstrated in the Berkeley stadium Sat
urday, both by the losing .California eleven and their rooters, and by the
victorious Trojan team, and their supporters. It is hard to lose a game
and not to alibi; yet California was able to do this. It is even more
difficult to win a game and not to brag; and U.S.C. accomplished this
act, Saturday.
A large number of Cardinal students are planning to make the trip
to the South this week-end, for the purpose of seeing a game of clean
football. And if the team does its part to keep the contest untainted, it
is up to the rooters to do as much. No one objects to plenty of rivalry,
as long as it goes no further than supporting the team, but in the past
incidents have occurred that have tended to injure America's greatest
college sport.
Tomorrow Tallman is acting in the capacity of host. He is going
to invite the Stanford students to Los Angeles, and he promises them the
best of treatment. It is our duty to accept and behave ourselves in the
Southland as befits guests. —W.F.A.
