# Children Must Play
## 
### 
An audience that might have been taken for a group of high school
kids watched the campus version of "Hay Fever" Friday night in the
Assembly Hall. It must have been gratifying to the actors and actresses
to hear the crowd go into convulsions over even the weakest puns that
were sprung during the evening.
Don't misunderstand, we are not saying the show was not good, be
cause it was 1 most entertaining. All we are trying to point out is that
the action of the play was slowed up greatly by the audience's readiness
to*laugh and cheer, at every word that the characters uttered. The play
was supposed to move swiftly from one situation to another. Instead,
the actors were forced to stop after each speech, and allow the crowd to
quiet down, before going on with the next bit of humor.
Between acts the children—we mean college men—came to the
front and did their very best to entertain the audience by sailing paper
aeroplanes about the Assembly Hall. Even though this was rather
undignified, we must admit that one of these paper ships made a beautiful
flight, and completely circled the whole room before it finally landed in a
lady's hairnet.
The worst deed of the whole evening was the making of the gurgling
sound by one of the clever roughs when coffee was poured by "Mr.
Greatham" during the breakfast in the last act. These clever persons are
wasting their talents; they are depriving the world of their humor.
What's to be done? —W.F.A.
