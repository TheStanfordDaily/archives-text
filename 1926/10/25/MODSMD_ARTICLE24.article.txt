# Hit-and-Run

### 
In the ordinary course of events tragedies tliat appear in print seem
but far distant and something entirely foreign to the rather narrow and
restricted life that makes up the campus. Crime usually does not touch
the University; it seems to belong to a world apart from the usual run
at college.
Thus it is the exception when it breaks through the smoothness of
college existence and touches the students as it did last Friday night when
a hit-run driver severely injured a Stanford student.
This peculiarity, the fear of being haled before the judge in answer
for his recklessness, is what makes the danger from the hit-run driver so
terrible. lie docs not stop even to render what aid lie can, but steps 011
the gas to get away. No human feelings save those of fear and utter
recklessness seem to sway him.
And the worst of it all is that little can be done. In a flash lie is gone,
and unless someone can make speedy identification of the car, it is a
stupendous task for the police to track down the guilty driver. Obviously,
it is impossible for the law to be ever-present 011 the highways.
In all probability the hit-run driver is with us to stay. Jt is regrettable
that the most abject of all human qualities can cause so much havoc, and
can so rule motorists that they neglect even the most ordinary human
decency. —D.T.R.
