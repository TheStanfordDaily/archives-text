And now we have a new bunch of
earthquake yarns. We'll tell one, but
we wish to warn Professor Hulme that
it is copyright, and must not be used
as a quarterly lecture gag, along with
that bromo about admiration in the'
concrete.

There is the one about the freshman
who had passed through the Santa
Barbara quake without a scratch.
When the recent tremor shook Encina
Hall he ran from his room and made
a mad dash down the stairs. The dis
turbance having temporarily inter
rupted the electric light service, he
stumbled and broke arm.
Don't tell us that Isn't comical.
* * *
Of course, this story of the earth-1
quake cannot compare, in point of j

humor, with that related by the east
ern papers.
* * *
This is being written on Sunday,
just now, the press building was shak
en by a slight quake. Speak of the
devil, etcetera ....

A PERSONAL MATTER.
It comes to our ears that the tender
hearted residents of a campus sorority
house wept, and threatened to call the
police, when they heard cries of an
guish emitted by the neophytes whose
souls were being purged preparatory
to the honor of membership (hat was
soon to be bestowed upon them by the
fraternity next door.
It is as though one should organize
a rescue party to save a lady who was
having her face lifted.
