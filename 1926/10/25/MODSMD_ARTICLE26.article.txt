The Editor, Sir:
Two very bad pieces of advertising
for Stanford are being presented to
the public eye. The most glaringly bad
bit is the commercialization of the
name "Stanford" by several big oil
companies who are distributing "Stan
ford" stickers to all who ask. It was
my misfortune to meet a car filled
with drunken Mexican fishermen in
Monterey, the other day, well plas
tered with the name of our beloved
college—courtesy of certain big oil
companies.
The less flagrant bit of bad adver

! tising is the use of the number 1 on
(lie football sweater of Fred Swan this
year. Last year that number was set
aside to the memory of Ernie Nevers,
and Stanford loyalty is not to be meas
ured by such quick and shallow for
; getfulness.
And I am also wondering if the old
I rickety bridge on the old county road
has been repaired. The blame was
1 definitely laid at the feet of San Mateo
, county officials this summer, and now
| that the student body is assembled,
; action should be forthcoming.
Very truly yours, An Alumnus.
