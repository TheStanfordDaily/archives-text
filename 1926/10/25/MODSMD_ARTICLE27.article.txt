# BABES DOWN NAVAL TEAM BY SUPERIOR OFFENSIVE ATTACK
## 
### 
By a score of 27 to 0, the Stanford ;
freshman football team defeated the !
U.S. Naval Hospital squad from Mare j
Island last Saturday. Superior off en- 1
sive power on the part of the Cardinal
babes was directly responsible for the
decisive victory.
The California freshmen played the
Navy team earlier this season, and
beat them by as large a score as the I
one run up by the Cardinal babes. The '
players on the Hospital sqaud, how
ever, say that the Stanford team
played a better game of ball than that
displayed by the Bear Cubs. Still, the
Cubs last Saturday swamped the Sac
ramento Junior College under an ava
lanche of touchdowns to beat them
34 to 0, while the Redshirted yearlings
were hard pressed to win from that
same outfit 6 to 0 the previous Satur
day.
Frentrup again ran wild when he
dashed through the Navy team seven-!
ty-five yards for a touchdown.
Coach Husky Hunt used practically
the entire squad in the game, with '
the exception of one or two of the men ;
who are out on account of injuries. A 1
Forster, tackle, may not play any more I
this season. His place was filled by j
Hodby, who was formerly a tackle but 1
who has been used at full this year.
The following lineup startod: ends,
Albertson and Bush; tackles, Linley
and Hodby; guards, Driscoll and Hu
lon; center, Templeman; quarter, 5
