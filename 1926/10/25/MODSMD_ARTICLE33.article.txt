# SOCCER TEAMS LOSE TWO HARD GAMES TO STRONG OPPONENTS
## 
### 
Stanford varsity soccer teams were
downed in two games Saturday, but
it took the spectacular team play of
the Mercury Club kickers of San Fran
cisco to defeat the Cardinal first team
2 to 1 in the afternoon contest, while
the second varsity went down in de
feat to San Mateo Junior College by
the same score in the morning en
counter. A practice affair arranged ex
temporaneously between pick-up
elevens from the freshman squad com
pleted the day's soccer card as the
afternoon preliminary go.
The Russian Mercury outfit played
a strong offense which held the play
in Card territory for the greater part
of the first half and which continually
threatened to break through the stiff
defense thrown out by Evans and New
lands, fullbacks, and Forrest, goal
tender.
The Stanford forwards came back at
half time to carry the brunt of the
contest into Mercury territory, despite
the powerful defense of the invading
eleven in kicking the ball into safe
territory and in the use of headwork,
but Farwell, playing outside right for
the Cards, passed in from his corner,
and Coleman, outside left, broke up a
close-in dribble to score Stanford's
lone tally.
The second varsity was overcome
by an early lead in the morning battle
when Todaro, inside right for San
Mateo Junior College, kicked in a long
pass off the goal post, but Zipfel, for
the Redshirts, was not long in retaliat
ing with a brilliant piece of individual
work which carried the ball into the
danger zone and through the goal on
a short shot.
