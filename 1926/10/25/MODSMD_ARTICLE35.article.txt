# GRAVEURE CONCERT TICKETS AVAILABLE
## 
### 
Tickets for the first concert of the
A.S.S.U. series will be distributed this
afternoon at 1 o'clock in the lobby of
the Old Union. All students who sub
scribed may get their tickets at this
time. Since so many tickets have been
lost in the past, individual tickets for
each concert will be given out before
the event in place of season tickets.
For those who have not yet procured
their tickets, there are a few left.
These may be gotten by personal ap
plications at the ticket office, or by
writing Wilfred Davis, Box 1151, Cam
pus.
Louis Graveure is giving the first
concert.
