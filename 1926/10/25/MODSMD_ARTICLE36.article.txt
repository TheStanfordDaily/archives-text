# Roble Club Purchases New Electric Victrola
## 
### 
Roble Club purchased a new electric
Victrola Saturday to replace the older
machine now in use. The Electrola,
with its five volume controls, will be
used largely for dancing. Until de
livery on the new machine can be
made, an Orthophonic Victrola will be
installed.
