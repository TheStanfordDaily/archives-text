# STANFORD ROOTERS NEGLECT TO CHEER FOOTBALL TRAINER
## 
### 
The Varsity left for the University
of Oregon and the student body gave
them a good send-off, with cheers and
skyrockets. But there is one man
who went with them who does not get
any of the cheering or the publicity,
yet who is just as important in the
winning of the game as anyone con
nected with the team.
He is Wallace Denny, Coach Pop
Warner's trainer. He is on the job
every day at the training quarters,
taking the kinks out of the men, and
patching them up for the next day's
practice; and every Saturday he is on
the sidelines, waiting for any emer
gency, and ready to rush to the aid
of any injured player. Denny is the
mechanic who keeps the team run
ning at its highest efficiency.
Denny was coached by Warner at
Carlisle University, and was later
chosen by Pop for his trainer. He has
worked under Warner at nine univer
sities.
During his youth, Dqnny was not
only proficient at football, but also won
over a score of medals in track events.
And today, he plays tennis with the
best of them. His excellent physical
condition is proof of how a man who
abstains from tobacco and liquor, and
leads a clean life, can keep fit.
When asked how long a man can
play football without suffering under
the severe strain, he said that it all
depended on the length of time a
player kept in training. If a man keeps
his physical condition in top form, he
can play a good, hard game for sev
eral years. Of course, if a player
breaks training and doesn't observe
the rules, he loses his vitality, and
must suffer the consequences.
