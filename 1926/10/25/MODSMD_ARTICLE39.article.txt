Upholding his claim as Stanford's
champion football rooter, D. A. Ray
bould, San Mateo realtor, left with
the Varsity to watch the Oregon
game Saturday at Eugene.
In 1925 Raybould traveled 5000
miles in order to cheer the Stan
ford eleven, it being necessary for
him to make two trips to Los An
geles and one to Seattle to main
tain his perfect record. He will
