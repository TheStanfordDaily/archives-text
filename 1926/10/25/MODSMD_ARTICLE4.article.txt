# COWARD PLAY CHARMING AS WHOLE; ACTION WHIRLS
## 
### Leonard Schwartz 
"Noel Coward, Gordon Davis, Leslie
Kiler, the technical staff, and the cast
of the Dramatic Council production,
'Hay Fever," co-operated to present an
evening of well-rounded entertainment
in the Stanford Assembly Hall last
Saturday evening."
In the aggregate, the performance
can best be recalled as a series of
delightful scenes, little choice morsels
of bubbling repartee, and several
striking character portrayals. ,
Action Whirls
The action fairly whirled about the
ultra-modern, ultra-emotional, ultra
dramatic, sort-of-English mother of the
ultra-modern, ultra-emotional, and
sort-of-English family of Bliss. At
home by themselves at the opening of
the first act, this family merely
amused with their preparations for
their week-end guests, and the tone
of the laugh response of the audience
indicated that perhaps there was
nothing decidedly unique in the lack
of harmony in the desires of the vari
ous Blisses. However, with the arrival
of the ill-fated guests, and the hot
and-cold receptions, the interest of the
audience became personal, and they
"bore with" the much-abused week
enders throughout the play, many on
lookers packing their grips and crawl
ing out with those guests near the
end of the last act.
Smoothness Lacking
The disappointing feature of the
comedy was the lack of smoothness
of change from one situation to an
other which usually characterizes a
Gordon Davis production. The action
went in spurts; at times tempting one
to cheer aloud for its color and na
turalness, only to lapse almost to bore
someness at others.

I uoruon uavis scoreu neavuy as
usual with his superb casting. Patrice I
Nauman without a doubt had the most
difficult part as Sarah Bliss, there
; tired actress mother of the family, and j
manipulated the numerous changes of
I expression and emotion with almost ;
professional ease. Norma Seib was
most welcomely natural as Sorel
Bliss, her acting never becoming
forced, and her presence being par-.
ticularly pleasing.
Wall, Doron Good
More facial animation would have
added more color to Byron Harvey's
j interpretation of Simon Bliss, the
blas6 son of the family. Enid Wall,
who with J. S. Doran made a special
trip to the campus to appear in this I
production, was delightful as the droll
I but shy flapper. Her handling of the
! scene with Raymond Haizlip in the
first act was one of the outstanding
J features of the play. In fact, both she
and Haizlip exhibited perfect tech
' nique in their appreciation of the situ
ation. Doron supplied capably and ade
quately the necessary maturits for his
part as the novelist father Bliss, and
was also well-teamed with Lucie Bent
ley in their scene in the second act,
1 when they sparred about with each
, other on the Bliss davenport.
Kiler Set Realistic
Zitkowski as the athletic English
youth was a bit hard to visualize in
the prize ring. Alberta Yearian tried
a bit too hard to be the overworked
domestic, but her exits always drew
laughs.
Leslie Kiler gave the cast a solid,
; realistic setting in which to perform
its antics, and the breakfast table
scene was relieved of many of its
difficulties of execution by well
j appointed properties.

manipulated the numerous changes of
I expression and emotion with almost ;
professional ease. Norma Seib was
most welcomely natural as Sorel
Bliss, her acting never becoming
forced, and her presence being par-.
ticularly pleasing.
Wall, Doron Good
More facial animation would have
added more color to Byron Harvey's
j interpretation of Simon Bliss, the
blas6 son of the family. Enid Wall,
who with J. S. Doran made a special
trip to the campus to appear in this I
production, was delightful as the droll
I but shy flapper. Her handling of the
! scene with Raymond Haizlip in the
first act was one of the outstanding
J features of the play. In fact, both she
and Haizlip exhibited perfect tech
' nique in their appreciation of the situ
ation. Doron supplied capably and ade
quately the necessary maturits for his
part as the novelist father Bliss, and
was also well-teamed with Lucie Bent
ley in their scene in the second act,
1 when they sparred about with each
, other on the Bliss davenport.
Kiler Set Realistic
Zitkowski as the athletic English
youth was a bit hard to visualize in
the prize ring. Alberta Yearian tried
a bit too hard to be the overworked
domestic, but her exits always drew
laughs.
Leslie Kiler gave the cast a solid,
; realistic setting in which to perform
its antics, and the breakfast table
scene was relieved of many of its
difficulties of execution by well
j appointed properties.
"Noel Coward, Gordon Davis, Leslie
Kiler, the technical staff, and the cast
of the Dramatic Council production,
'Hay Fever," co-operated to present an
evening of well-rounded entertainment
in the Stanford Assembly Hall last
Saturday evening."
In the aggregate, the performance
can best be recalled as a series of
delightful scenes, little choice morsels
of bubbling repartee, and several
striking character portrayals. ,
Action Whirls
The action fairly whirled about the
ultra-modern, ultra-emotional, ultra
dramatic, sort-of-English mother of the
ultra-modern, ultra-emotional, and
sort-of-English family of Bliss. At
home by themselves at the opening of
the first act, this family merely
amused with their preparations for
their week-end guests, and the tone
of the laugh response of the audience
indicated that perhaps there was
nothing decidedly unique in the lack
of harmony in the desires of the vari
ous Blisses. However, with the arrival
of the ill-fated guests, and the hot
and-cold receptions, the interest of the
audience became personal, and they
"bore with" the much-abused week
enders throughout the play, many on
lookers packing their grips and crawl
ing out with those guests near the
end of the last act.
Smoothness Lacking
The disappointing feature of the
comedy was the lack of smoothness
of change from one situation to an
other which usually characterizes a
Gordon Davis production. The action
went in spurts; at times tempting one
to cheer aloud for its color and na
turalness, only to lapse almost to bore
someness at others.

I uoruon uavis scoreu neavuy as
usual with his superb casting. Patrice I
Nauman without a doubt had the most
difficult part as Sarah Bliss, there
; tired actress mother of the family, and j
manipulated the numerous changes of
I expression and emotion with almost ;
professional ease. Norma Seib was
most welcomely natural as Sorel
Bliss, her acting never becoming
forced, and her presence being par-.
