# SQUAD RETURNS IN GOOD SHAPE FOR U.S.C.TILT
## Team Will Have Four Days Of Practice Before Going South HOPEFUL OF VICTORY Bogue, Hyland Make Good Showing; Will Probably Start Saturday 
### 
And now comes U.S.C. and the real
test of Stanford's gridiron strength.
Pop Warner and his squad of twen-!
ty-six football players returned to the j
campus yesterday afternoon from j
Eugene, Oregon, where they defeated j
the University of Oregon eleven 23 to j
12 Saturday in their first conference j
appearance of the year, and Warner ,
immediately put the boys to work.
They ran signals for about an hour j
yesterday.
Aside from Eli Post, whose knee is j
giving him some trouble, the warriors |
are in good shape for Saturday's '
classic against the Trojans, and War- J
ner has hopes of a victory, despite !
the fact that his team is considered j
Tiy the experts to be the short-ender !
in the betting.
Good Showing Second Half
In the second half of the Oregon j
game the athletes stepped out and j
played first-class football, holding the |
ball almost the entire last two periods '
and keeping it in Webfoot territory i
throughout.
Because of their great showing in ;
the second half of last Saturday's j
game George Bogue and Dick Hyland
probably will be started at the half-!
back berths in the U.S.C. game. Hyland j
was the talk of Eugene because of his 1
sensational runs, and Bogue's hard
running on the off-tackle plays was
exceptional. .
Biff Hoffman showed that he is him- ]
self once again by the way he ripped j
the Oregon line to pieces, and his j
kicking and passing, too, were up to j
his usual standard.
Many Penalties
The line outcharged the Oregon line- j
men both on the offense and defense j
after the first few minutes of play, j
when the only criticism which could
be offered regarding their play would
be one regarding the many times they i
drew penalties. The Redshirts were'
set back 175 yards due to infractions j
of the rules, several of them coming j
at critical times.
On the voyage back to Stanford the
team was in good spirits, and every
member of the squad is looking for
ward to a victory Saturday. Practice
sessions will be held Tuesday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday, and Thursday
night the athletes will board the train
to Los Angeles, where they face the
Thundering Herd in a game that may
determine the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championship.
