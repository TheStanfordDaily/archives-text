# JUNIORS MAKE PLANS FOR YEAR ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
Plans for a continuation of the jolly
ups, so successful for the last two
years, a big all-day picnic and hayride,
and an extensive program for Junior
Week are among the social activities
now being planned for the coming year
by the class of '28. Although no defi
nite dates have been set, a committee
consisting of Graeme Doane, chair
man, Hallie Keating, Nancy Farmer,
Frederick Zitkowski. and Edward
Grannis, has been appointed and is
working out some ideas.
