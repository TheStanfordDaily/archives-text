## 
### 
To assist the University of Califor
na in supporting Amendment 10, the
Stanford Band, representing the Uni
versity, will participate in a public
demonstration in San Francisco Wed
nesday night. Amendment 10 will ap
propriate funds for the construction
of new buildings at the University of
California to replace some of the
dilapidated ones now in use.
The Stanford Band in conjunction
with the University of California Band
will parade from the Ferry Building,to
the Civic Auditorium, where a mass
meeting of voters is to be held. The
parade will begin at 7:30 p.m.
Three special busses of the Penin
sula Rapid Transit Company will take
the band from the bandhouse to the
Ferry building in San Francisco, and
will be at the end of the line of march
to return the band to the campus. Dr.
E. W. Martin, director of the band, is
requiring the attendance of all band
mombers; so a ninety-six-piece baud
will represent the University.
Besides helping the University of
California, the appearance of the band
in San Francisco will be a good pub
licity stunt for the alma mater.
