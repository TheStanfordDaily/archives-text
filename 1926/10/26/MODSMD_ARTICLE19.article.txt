# CHAPPIE STICKERS HURL THREAT AT THUNDERING HERD
## 
### 
" Trouble Ahead Trojans" read
the bright red letters on the pro
phetic posters to be distributed
by the Chaparral tomorrow for
ornamentation of campus wind
shields.
A coffin is traced in red around
the edges of the stickers, and the
mighty Stanford ax is present in
the background.
The symbolic posters are simi
lar to those printed two years
ago when the Trojan game was
called off at the last minute and
are the work of Elizabeth Roper-
Jordan. â€¢
