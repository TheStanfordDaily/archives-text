# PAVILION ACOUSTICS ARE BEING PERFECTED FOR CONCERT SERIES
## Tickets on Sale Today for Concert by Graveure Thursday Evening 
### H.A. Klein 
Dr. Alfred Hertz, leader of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, visit
ed the campus yesterday for the pur
pose of examining the basketball pa
vilion and passing judgment upon its
acoustic qualities as the site of the
coming Stanford Concert Series to be
opened Thursday night by Louis
Graveure, famous Belgian baritone.
Dr. Hertz conferred with Wilfrid
Davis, manager of the series, and
made a number of suggestions for
fitting the pavilion with drops and
curtains to perfect audibility.
Acoustics Good
It was the opinion of the well-known
conductor, who is one of the foremost
authorities on acoustics of the West,
that the pavilion will be eminently
suitable for the concerts when all ar
rangements are completed. The fact
that he lias consented to conduct his
orchestra in the pavilion is proof of
his belief in the possibilities of the
place, for he is always very exacting
in his demands for satisfactory acous
tics in halls where his concerts are
given, believing that a large part of
the enjoyment of the audience depends
on the freedom from disturbing echoes
and distortion.
Large Repertoire
The program of numbers that Gra
veure will sing next Thursday has
been received and contains some of
the baritone's most popular numbers.
Graveure has a repertoire of about
two hundred numbers, one of the larg
est of any singers on the concert
stage. He is able to build a program
that is varied and interesting. Thurs
day night's recital has been planned
with a view of offering those composi
tions that the singer believes will be
the most attractive here. Songs will
be given in English, French, and Ger
man, grouped according to language.
Mr. Graveure has been especially re
quested to sing "Sylvia," by Speaks,
one of his most characteristic and
popular numbers.
Ticket distribution will continue in
the lobby of the Old Union this after
noon, beginning at 1 o'clock. All stu
dents who subscribed for season tick
ets are advised by Manager Wilfrid
Davis that this Will be the last oppor
tunity to get the pasteboards.
