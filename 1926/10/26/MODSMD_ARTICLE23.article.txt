# Diseased Trees Being Removed From Arboretum
## 
### 
On the recommendation of Profes
sor McMurphy, of the Biology depart
ment, all diseased trees and plants in
the arboretHm are being removed.
Most of these diseased trees and
plants are of the fast-growing type and
were originally planted on the grounds
to make a screen until the slower trees
and plants had made a suitable
growth.
While the diseased plants are being
destroyed the workers are at the same
time pruning and trimming up the
other plants, so that in a short time
the arboretum will look much im
proved.
