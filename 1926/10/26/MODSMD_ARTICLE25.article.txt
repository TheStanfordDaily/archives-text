For the first and in all probability the last time this year the Stanford
men will get together to discuss matters that are of no particular interest
to the women. Now all the fellows who have a hankering for sitting in
the balcony seats of the Assembly Hall will now be able to satisfy their
desire to look down on the speakers for an hour.
Opening the program there will be Leland Tallman, president of
the Associated Students of the University of Southern California. With
a spirit of co-operation and an idea to inaugurate an era of friendly
relations between U.S.C. and Stanford, he will tell the men students of
the Trojan desire to establish closer connections.
Then comes a chance to get a lot of inside dope on who is going to
win the 1926 Conference Football Title. Dink Templeton has been in
close contact with Warner and the team all year, and after watching some
off-campus games should have the right dope. Within the last few days,
almost every student has formulated the conviction that Stanford is going
to hand the Trojans a trimming. Now here is the opportunity to get
the right information to back up your dope.
Also we have upon our right and leftâ€”Stanley Weigel, Bob Lewis,
and Dan Evans. Evans is one of the old-timers who was a "big gun"
on the campus while here. lie is going to give his views as to how
worthwhile are extra curricular activities.
