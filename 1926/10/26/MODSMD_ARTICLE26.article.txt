# Sing the Trojan Hoarse
## 
### 
The Trojan Horse Song that appeared in The Stanford Daily yes
terday morning is to be sung in the Coliseum in Los Angeles by the
Stanford rooting section this week-end. At any rate, that is the plan.
But the trouble with this plan is that the song must be learned in the
few days that are left before Saturday.
If the song is to be a success the living groups on the campus will
have to get organized and practice the music at meal times. Or, even
better, gather around the piano after dinner and practice with some real
music. For nothing falls so flat as a half-learned song, sung by a college
rooting section, where volume is substituted for harmony.
The tune is not new to Stanford students, for the band has been
playing it for the last two years. This music was chosen because it was
familiar to the Cardinal rooters, and because there was not time left in
which to learn a new tune. Now all the students have to do is to learn
the words, and as there are only about sixty-eight of them, the brighter
members of the student body should be able to conquer this task by
Saturday. Those that can not possibly learn the words can at least hum
the tune.
Starting today at all living groups, start singing the Trojan Horse
Song to the gurgle of the soup, and throughout the meat course, and let
it rage on until the dessert is dragged from the table. Then the student
will be unable to get up and walk to class without softly humming the
tune to himself as he strides down the street. â€”W.F.A.
