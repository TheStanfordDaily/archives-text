# Minor Desecration

Peculiarly prominent places about the Quad have l>een reserved as
billboards for campus people and activities. The spots passed by the
majority of students at least once during the day, such as the Engineering
corner, the English corner, the Postoftice, and others, are well supplied
with space for advertising purposes.
With such equipment for catching the eyes of the students it is too
bad that spare posts, telegraph poles, and such-like are pressed into
service to ballyhoo this and that.
Whether in ignorance of the executive committee ruling or in sheer
disregard of good taste, several organizations have recently taken it upon
themselves to. use unsanctioned places for their advertising. Concen
trated publicity would in all probability produce as good results.
