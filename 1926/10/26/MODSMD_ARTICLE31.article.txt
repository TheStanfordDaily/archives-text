The Editor. The Stanford Daily:
The write-up of the Stanford-Oregon
game from the pen of Franklin B.
Morse runs true to form. Having pre-,
pared the way on the preceding day by
an article depicting about all of the
Oregon team as "hors de combat" from
various and sundry injuries, so that
nobody will be left but, as he says,
"the water-boy and the janitor," to
oppose the Cardinals, he finishes his
jaundiced and jumbled description of !
the actual combat in the expected
Morsian style. According to this "For
mer Princeton and Ail-American Half-,
back, etc., etc.," Oregon's team was
worse than one from the fabled |
"Pumpkin Center" village of song and
story. Just no team at all, in short.
Oregon papers please copy. Then he
romps into good old Stanford.
He iterates and reiterates the palpa
ble fact that the score was no indica
tion of the game—"Stanford won but
, looked bad doing it, etc., etc., etc."
; And he tells us many times over that
Stanford will get the soundest kind of
a licking from U.S.C. Whereat we haz
ard the wild guess that Morse will be

| duly delighted.
From those who actually witnessed
the game. Morse's sizzling and wither
j ing denunciation of Stanford seems—
well, what? You name it. It appears
j that Stanford came within an ace of
making two additional touchdowns,
through two all but completed forward
passes. These Morse had failed to
note. Also the score ought to count
j for something, Alorse to the contrary,
notwithstanding.
One thing is certain, if Morse does
the reporting for The Chronicle at the
, U.S.C. game, and if Stanford wins, it
will be by accident or through flukes.
| If the game is a tie, then Stanford did
mighty well to stave off impending
j defeat. And if U.S.C. is the victor, it
was just as predicted, only the score
should have been twice as large.
Morse's mind just runs that way, and
1 when anyone wishes to read a real
I
i honest-to-goodness account of the
game, he had best get the Los Angeles
Times/Yod won't get it in The Chron
icle if "The All-American Princeton,
etc., etc., has the tale to tell you.
Thank you. —John C. Silliman.
