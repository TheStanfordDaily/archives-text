# DR. PAUL F. CADMAN, U.C. ASSOCIATE DEAN, DISCUSSES TEACHING
## 
### 
The world is slow to see that there
are things the matter with the teach
ing profession, Dr. Paul F. Cadman,
associate dean of men at the Univer
sity of California, told a group of Oak
lam] teachers recently when they met
in the Civic Auditorium in Oakland. ]
"The world is slower to admit what
they have seen and slowest of all to j
correct the faults in the teaching pro- j
fession," he continued.
"It remained for Bernard Shaw, in 1
discussing the curses or modern edu- 1
cation, to summarize the whole mat
ter," Dean Cadman explained as he
quoted Shaw's epigram—
" 'Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.' "
In c< miming his address, Dean Cad-1
man said:
"Four motives, in the main, have 1
made teachers of men and women.
There are many among us who 'went!
into' teaching for the love of it. Many
go in as a stop-gap between college or
normal and marriage; some, perhaps;
many, for the money there is in it; ■
and some in painful admission of Mr.
Shaw's thrust, because they can't do
anything else.
"Many shrink from competition and
teaching is a non-competitive profes- 1
sion. Suppose there were twenty men i
and women eager, ready, waiting for a j
chance at our job. How many would
survive? The teaching profession has
long been a haven into which the timid
the frightened and the non-competitive |
escape. All they have to do is to be-;
hgve. Work up a course or a set of !
problems and repeat them to classes ,
of 40 for 40 years until old age and
pensions close the cycle. And because
there is no competition, many stand
still.
"There are those who say we are
badly paid, from $1000 to $3000 in the
schools where the child is in the most
plastic state; $1500 to $3600 in high
schools, and $2400 to $5000 in colleges.
I agree. I would gladly subscribe to a
system which would discover and pay
a teacher all he or she is worth. But
it is a painful fact that manv are paid
I
at a low scale because their initiative, j
ability and personality are not worth
any more and could not bring as much j
in competitive industry.
"Competition has its evils. It is '
often expensive, but in the long run it
weeds out the idle and ineffective. We I
have no such process. But someone '
says that if salaries were higher, bet- 1
ter men and women would go in. Yes, i
and many ineffectives would perish, j
but the new and efficient would have j
to be specially endowed to resist the
degenerating influence of a sinecure. I
The fact remains that we have built
up a mountain of methodology and
have lost sight of content.
