# PENN STATE COLLEGE SERVES FIFTY CITIES
## 
### 
"If you can't come to college, the
college will come to you," is the slogan {
of the Educational Extension depart
ment of the Pennsylvania State Col
lege. This department has served over
seven thousand teachers since its or
ganization a few years ago.
Classes are held in more than fifty j
cities, those in Pittsburgh being the
! largest with more than a thousand j
students enrolled. National boundaries j
do not limit the instruction, as even j
in Japan correspondence courses are [
being studied.
There is a greatly increased demand 1
for academic as well as professional
courses. One of the recently added
j subjects is "Current Tendencies in
; American Public Education." This is
I a substitute for the course previously I
! given at the State Teacher's Institute.
