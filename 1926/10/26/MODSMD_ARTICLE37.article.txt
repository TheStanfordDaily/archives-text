# FIRE DESTROYS FOUR BUILDINGS AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Four buildings were burned and six
students injured in a fire which threat
ened to sweep the entire University
of Santa Clara campus yesterday. It
is estimated that the loss from the
flames will reach $250,000. Students
and university fathers aided four fire
department companies to combat the
fire. Besides the old mission, the din
ing room, infirmary, and kitchen were
destroyed. Patients in the infirmary
were carried to safety by students be
fore the flames spread to that struc
ture.
Defective wiring in the old church
is believed to have started the blaze,
about 7 o'clock in the morning, a few
minutes after the conclusion of mass.
Being built of wood, the old landmark
was aflame in a very short time, and
serious risks were taken in an en
deavor to save some of the old relics
the mission contained. Many of these
were brought from the Old World, and
it is doubtful whether the original
mission bills, brought to thi.s country
in 1777 from Spain, will be recovered
from the ruins.
Bodies of a number of famous Jesuit
fathers, including that of Father Magin
Catala, founder of the original Mis
sion Santa Clara, were buried in a
crypt of the mission.
Only a few volumes were saved from
the church library.
Warren Aheart, right tackle on the
Santa Clara eleven, was the outstand
ing hero of the fire, when he saved
Hugh Clark, a sophomore, from falling
off the roof of a three-story dormitory
structure, from which place students
were playing water on the chapel.
Clark, who lost his footing and was
rolling toward the edge of the roof,
was dramatically saved when Aheart
made a flying leap and caught him a
few inches from the edge.
