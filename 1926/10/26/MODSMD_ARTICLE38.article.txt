It. is imperative that all prospective
teachers, experienced as well as in
experienced, should register person
ally with the Appointment Office not
later than January 1 in order to re
ceive the most efficient service from
that bureau, according to Elizabeth B.
Snell, Appointment Secretary, who
spoke before a group of teachers yes
terday afternoon in the Education
building.
Citing emergency cases in which the
work of the bureau had been seriously
delayed by the lack of adequate infor
mation regarding applicants, Mrs.
Snell emphasized the advantages of
students enrolling with the office im
mediately upon graduation even if no
immediate need of employment is an
ticipated.
Oversupply of Teachers
"This year, with an oversupply of
teachers and an undersupply of posi
tions, it is particularly necessary that
prospective teachers co-operate with
the Appointment Office in every de
tail," Mrs. Snell said. She explained
the importance of applicants submit
ting representative references, good
photographs, and accurate informa
tion where they can be located at all
times.
"If you want the best results, be on
hand and be business-like with the
office," Mrs. Snell urged.
"History and English is the least de
sirable teaching combination you can
pick out," Mrs. Snell said, in speaking
of teaching demands. "There is, how
ever, a great demand for Home Eco
nomics, Physical Education, and Voca
tional teachers."
