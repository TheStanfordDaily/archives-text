# STREET LIGHTS NOT GOOD STARS AT U.C.

### 
Street illumination may be a help
to city pedestrians, but electric globes
can shed no light on the study of
astronomy, nor can they be used as
stray comets; in fact, they are a
handicap in the vicinity of observa
tories, according to Professor A. O.
Leuschner, Director of the Student
Observatory on the University of Cali
fornia campus.
Civilization has spread so rapidly in
Berkeley, Professor Leuschner com
plains, that the old observatory, which
in ISSS was the highest building in the
vicinity, has now been surrounded by
homes, and the entire slope of the hill
above covered with lights.
"As a result of this natural progress
in building, our view of the sky near
the liorrzon is just a series of eclipses
and unclassified electric light stars set
in between tree tops," Professor
Leuschner says. "Unless we can get
a more adequate observatory on a
more suitable site on the campus,
where lights and passing street cars
will not interrupt our work, the stand
ing which the University has achieved
as the leading graduate school of as
tronomy in the United States is bound
to suffer, without mentioning the ob
vious handicap to the students."
