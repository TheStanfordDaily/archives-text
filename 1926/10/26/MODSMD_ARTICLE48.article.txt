# Women Plan Rifle Club; Matches by Telegraph
## 
### 
Plans for a Women's Rifle Club are
now being materialized. No experience
is necessary, the club guaranteed i
that its members will soon learn to
hit something.
Matches with 17.5.C., the Oregon
schools, and some eastern schools are
in prospect. Telegraph will be the ;
medium.
This club will not be in connection
with gymnasium work.
