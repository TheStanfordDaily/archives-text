### 
"Printing for Commerce," an* exhibit
assembled and arranged by the Ameri
can Institute of Graphic Arts, which
was scheduled to be shown at the
Stanford Art Gallery this week, has
been delayed in the mail, and will
probably not go on display until the j
latter part of this week. Posters, dis- !
play cards, advertising booklets, cir- j
culars, and other examples of commer- j
cial printing will make up the exhibi- j
tion, which will demonstrate the re
newed interest in fine printing dis- .
played by American presses in recent i
years.
The collection of marine paintings, j
by George C. Colman, of Balboa, will ;
remain on display until October 31. J
A majority of Mr. Colman's seascapes
are of scenes along the Pacific Coast. ;
Among the most interesting of the can
vases are "Homeward Bound," "Gray j
Dawn," "The Slaver," and"The Phan- '
torn Ship."
"Homeward Bound" shows the first
type of square-rigger to be used on '
this coast during the gold rush. These j
boats were called "Cape Homers." ;
"Gray Dawn" pictures the v French
ship "El Capitan" with a load of salt- [
peter being landed at San Francisco i
during the World War.
"The Slaver" is a painting of a fam- j
ous vessel, built in Maine about ISSO |
and used in the Blackbird trade be- j
tween Africa and Charleston before I
the Civil War. It carried contraband |
during the war, later turned pirate, J
and was finally captured and run as a !
merchant ship to the Hawaiian Is
lands. It was finally sold to the moving
picture corporations and lost on the
Newport bar in 1918.
