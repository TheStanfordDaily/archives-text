# BUSINESS OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN PEACE DECLARES EXECUTIVE
## Chamber of Commerce Head Justifies Modern Ways In Business Life 
### 
"Not only has Dusiness a great re
sponsibility and obligation for world
peace but commercialism is the only
hope for world peace," declared Rob
ert N. Lynch, executive manager of
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce, who spoke before the Cosmo
politan Club in the Women's Club
house last night.
"Commercialism is just as capable
of idealism and uplifting as any other
sphere of society. The phrase 'Business
is business' which is taken by many
as a sort of justification for unethical
action is one of the most false notions
of today," said Lynch.
Age of Commercialism
"We are living in an age of com
mercialism, having passed beyond the
age of ecclesiastical superstition and
military force. Commerce has more
effect on human life and happiness
than any other category."
"It is to the interest of commerce to
have peace inasmuch as the economic
losses of war must be distributed over
the territory affected, thereby upset
ting commercial stability.
"Since business of today is working
along international lines, it is good
for peace. The international business
man must be the leader for peace, and
in fact, that is what is happening, for
although it is difficult to co-operate
on international political affairs, we
find international plans of business,
such as the Dawes plan, working.
"Business leaders of the Pacific
Coast have taken the lead in adjusting
relations with the Orient. Such leader
ship has not been sought but has been
undertaken because commerce is in
terested in peace."
