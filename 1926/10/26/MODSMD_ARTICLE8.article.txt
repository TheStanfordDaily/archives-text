# "JOHN FERGUSON" PORTRAYS SERIOUS SIDE OF HUMANITY
## Play Depicting Struggles of Irish Peasant Family English Success 
### 
After the depressing dearth of ave
rage plays, "John Ferguson," the
Sword and Sandals production for the
night of November 5, will come as a
rediscovery of the fact that human
nature and human problems are suffi
ciently serious and dignified to justify
serious treatment.
The play is of the type that will
bring forth as truly a dramatic master
piece as can be produced on a college
stage. In writing "John Ferguson," St.
John Ervine has advanced the theory
that a sincerely-written play, bearing
a clear and indisputable relationship
to human life, will gain the full inter
est of the public. The reception given
to this play in America and England
has completely supported this view.
Ervine has depicted the struggles
of an Irish peasant family, maintaining
throughout a tone of perfect natural
ness and vitality of personalities. The
characters are powerfully drawn, and
a deep emotional interest is aroused
through the skilful contrasting of their
characteristics.
