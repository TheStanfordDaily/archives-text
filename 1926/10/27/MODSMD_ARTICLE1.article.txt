# CARD-TROJANS SPIRIT BETTER SAYS TALLMAN
## U.S.C. Student Body Head Talks at Assembly for Men Yesterday URGES LESS PREJUDICE Campus Activities Discussed By Dan Evans, Former A.S.S.U. President 
### 
"Football and athletic relationships
between Stanford and the University
*)f Southern California are not uncon
trolled things," said Dee Tallman,
president of the Trojan student body,
speaking before the Men's Assembly
yesterday; "we must control them in
the light of student intelligence.
"For years the two schools have en
gaged in contests, and sometimes, due
to an over-intense desire to win, preju
dice has crept in and a bitter feeling
has been very pronounced. But today
sets the dawn of a new era. The stu
dents of the two universities are es
sentially alike, and their intelligence
demands that enthusiasm be tempered
by courtesy. Let the dead past bury
its dead; we must live in the future —
Southern California greets Stanford
on this basis."
Tallman also made a plea against
sectionalism, holding it unworthy of a
person with college training, and lay
ing blame on the newspapers for pro
moting intercollegiate discord on a
regional basis.
Alumnus on Activities
Looking back on college activities
In the light of several years of ex
perience in the business world, Dan
Evans, one-time student body presi
dent at Stanford, urged that campus
activities be taken for what they are
worth to the individual.
"The reaction of the average alum
nus to activities," said Evans, might
be summed up in the expression: we
j had a good time —let it go at that.
1 Some of the alumni regret that they
tried to do too much; others feel
badly that they did not better learn
to mix. Activities can, however, be
carried very definitely over into busi
ness. Trade clubs, chambers of com
merce, and all kinds of social and
business organization snap up the col
lege 'activity men* and find any num
ber of things for them to do."
Activities should be taken for the
happiness they bring, said Evans, and
not for the mere glory. The danger of
becoming over-balanced and failing in
scholarship was held one of the strong
est limitations on participation in
campus work.
U.S.C. Passes Peak?
I That the game last Saturday with
the University of California repre
sented the psychological peak of the
season for the Southern California
varsity, was the opinion expressed by
Dink Templeton in considering the
prospects for a Stanford victory at
Los Angeles.
"The Stanford schedule this fall."
said Templeton, "has been laid with
I the idea of building up the team
through easy stages till it reaches its
i highest point in next Saturday's game,
j This team is fully determined to win."
Coach Templeton sketched the his
j tory of the games between the two
i schools, and found that Stanford had
1 lost badly when playing after its peak
game with California. He had the
highest praise for the abilities of the
1 varsity players this season, and cred
ited much of Stanford's strength to its
J excellent reserve strength.
Plea for Traditions
j Robert Lewis, student manager,
made a plea for the preservation of

some of the Stanford traditions, par- ;
ticularly the "hello" tradition, which >
he declared in danger of passing.
"We are likely to go too far in i
abolishing traditions just because they (
come over from the past and destroy
some things which are absolutely de
sirable."
Lewis found the spirit of the school j
tending to an oversophistication, and
urged that true enthusiasm be mani
fested in Stanford and Stanford activi
i ties.
Stanley Weigel, president of the 1
A.S.S.U., was chairman of the assem- i
bly.

"Football and athletic relationships
between Stanford and the University
*)f Southern California are not uncon
trolled things," said Dee Tallman,
president of the Trojan student body,
speaking before the Men's Assembly
yesterday; "we must control them in
the light of student intelligence.
"For years the two schools have en
gaged in contests, and sometimes, due
to an over-intense desire to win, preju
dice has crept in and a bitter feeling
has been very pronounced. But today
sets the dawn of a new era. The stu
dents of the two universities are es
sentially alike, and their intelligence
demands that enthusiasm be tempered
by courtesy. Let the dead past bury
its dead; we must live in the future —
Southern California greets Stanford
on this basis."
Tallman also made a plea against
sectionalism, holding it unworthy of a
person with college training, and lay
ing blame on the newspapers for pro
moting intercollegiate discord on a
regional basis.
Alumnus on Activities
Looking back on college activities
In the light of several years of ex
perience in the business world, Dan
Evans, one-time student body presi
dent at Stanford, urged that campus
activities be taken for what they are
worth to the individual.
"The reaction of the average alum
nus to activities," said Evans, might
be summed up in the expression: we
j had a good time —let it go at that.
1 Some of the alumni regret that they
tried to do too much; others feel
badly that they did not better learn
to mix. Activities can, however, be
carried very definitely over into busi
ness. Trade clubs, chambers of com
merce, and all kinds of social and
business organization snap up the col
lege 'activity men* and find any num
ber of things for them to do."
Activities should be taken for the
happiness they bring, said Evans, and
not for the mere glory. The danger of
becoming over-balanced and failing in
scholarship was held one of the strong
est limitations on participation in
campus work.
U.S.C. Passes Peak?
I That the game last Saturday with
the University of California repre
sented the psychological peak of the
season for the Southern California
varsity, was the opinion expressed by
Dink Templeton in considering the
prospects for a Stanford victory at
Los Angeles.
"The Stanford schedule this fall."
said Templeton, "has been laid with
I the idea of building up the team
through easy stages till it reaches its
i highest point in next Saturday's game,
j This team is fully determined to win."
Coach Templeton sketched the his
j tory of the games between the two
i schools, and found that Stanford had
1 lost badly when playing after its peak
game with California. He had the
highest praise for the abilities of the
1 varsity players this season, and cred
ited much of Stanford's strength to its
J excellent reserve strength.
Plea for Traditions
j Robert Lewis, student manager,
made a plea for the preservation of

some of the Stanford traditions, par- ;
ticularly the "hello" tradition, which >
he declared in danger of passing.
"We are likely to go too far in i
abolishing traditions just because they (
come over from the past and destroy
some things which are absolutely de
sirable."
Lewis found the spirit of the school j
tending to an oversophistication, and
urged that true enthusiasm be mani
fested in Stanford and Stanford activi
i ties.
