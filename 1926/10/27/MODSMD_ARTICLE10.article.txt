# WARNER TRAINS VARSITY TEAMS ON U.S.C. PLAYS
## Hard Scrimmage Handed Out to Cardinal Men By Head Coach THREE TEAMS PRACTICE Patchett, Post Not in Form Yet for Regular Work On Grid Field 
### 
Sam Joseph, substitute fullback
on the varsity, will play no more
football this season. This is due to
the fact that the tendon of his
right thumb was severed in an
accident sustained Monday eve
ning. A glass soap container broke
while Sam was leaning upon it,
and the glass cut the tendon.
Corwin Artman, substitute
tackle, suffered a broken nose in
scrimmage last night. He will
probably be out of practice for at
least two weeks.
There were three Stanford football
teams on the practice field yesterday
afternoon and each had a different
mission to perform. The varsity did its
work running signals and the second
team worked out against the third
squad.
Hard work started early in the
afternoon when Warner called for the
second and third elevens to scrim- j
mage. He gave the ball to the third-1
string men and told them to use as j
many of the U.S.C. plays as possible. !
This they did, and, by using what j
they had learned of the Trojan attack 1
by seeing the game between the Thun-1
dering Herd and California Saturday, I
they gave the second team linemen i
plenty of plays to try to si op.
U.S.C. Plays Used
Finally Pop took the ball away from
the third team and gave it to the
second-string team to run awhile, but
before he dismissed the two squads
for the afternoon he had tlie squad try
its hand at executing some more of
the famous U.S.C. plays.
Then, as dusk was beginning to fall,
the varsity was called forth to run
signals. The lineup which Warner
used as his first squad yesterday in
cluded Walker and Shipkey, ends;
Harris and Poulson, tackles; Captain
Swan and Robesky, guards; McCreery,
center; Millage, quarterback; Bogue
and Hyland, halves; and Hoffman, full
back.
Post Not in Uniform
Eli Post was not in uniform. Warner
thinks it better to give the quarter
back's knee a rest, so Post probably
will not be in a suit before Thursday
afternoon's workout.
However, Ernie Patchett appeared,
and although he did not take part in
scrimmage, he showed Pop that his
injured ankle is ready for some real
work.
Warner is working hard for this
game and is pointing the players for
it. If they are able to get over the
high hurdle at Los Angeles Saturday
they will have a good chance of finish
ing the season unbeaten, and by so
doing annex the conference title.
After the U.S.C. game the varsity
meets Santa Clara and then Washing
ton, both games to be played in the
stadium. Then comes the Big Game.
But there is work to be done before
these contests are to be considered,

lots of it, and Warner and his staff of
assistants are spending every minute
of their time thinking about U.S.C.
right now.

of their time thinking about U.S.C.
right now.
Sam Joseph, substitute fullback
on the varsity, will play no more
football this season. This is due to
the fact that the tendon of his
right thumb was severed in an
accident sustained Monday eve
ning. A glass soap container broke
while Sam was leaning upon it,
and the glass cut the tendon.
Corwin Artman, substitute
tackle, suffered a broken nose in
scrimmage last night. He will
probably be out of practice for at
least two weeks.
There were three Stanford football
teams on the practice field yesterday
afternoon and each had a different
mission to perform. The varsity did its
work running signals and the second
team worked out against the third
squad.
Hard work started early in the
afternoon when Warner called for the
second and third elevens to scrim- j
mage. He gave the ball to the third-1
string men and told them to use as j
many of the U.S.C. plays as possible. !
This they did, and, by using what j
they had learned of the Trojan attack 1
by seeing the game between the Thun-1
dering Herd and California Saturday, I
they gave the second team linemen i
plenty of plays to try to si op.
U.S.C. Plays Used
Finally Pop took the ball away from
the third team and gave it to the
second-string team to run awhile, but
before he dismissed the two squads
for the afternoon he had tlie squad try
its hand at executing some more of
the famous U.S.C. plays.
Then, as dusk was beginning to fall,
the varsity was called forth to run
signals. The lineup which Warner
used as his first squad yesterday in
cluded Walker and Shipkey, ends;
Harris and Poulson, tackles; Captain
Swan and Robesky, guards; McCreery,
center; Millage, quarterback; Bogue
and Hyland, halves; and Hoffman, full
back.
Post Not in Uniform
Eli Post was not in uniform. Warner
thinks it better to give the quarter
back's knee a rest, so Post probably
will not be in a suit before Thursday
afternoon's workout.
However, Ernie Patchett appeared,
and although he did not take part in
scrimmage, he showed Pop that his
injured ankle is ready for some real
work.
Warner is working hard for this
game and is pointing the players for
it. If they are able to get over the
high hurdle at Los Angeles Saturday
they will have a good chance of finish
ing the season unbeaten, and by so
doing annex the conference title.
After the U.S.C. game the varsity
meets Santa Clara and then Washing
ton, both games to be played in the
stadium. Then comes the Big Game.
But there is work to be done before
these contests are to be considered,

lots of it, and Warner and his staff of
assistants are spending every minute
of their time thinking about U.S.C.
right now.
