# WARNER TRAINS VARSITY TEAMS ON U.S.C. PLAYS
## Hard Scrimmage Handed Out to Cardinal Men By Head Coach THREE TEAMS PRACTICE Patchett, Post Not in Form Yet for Regular Work On Grid Field

Sam Joseph, substitute fullback
on the varsity, will play no more
football this season. This is due to
the fact that the tendon of his
right thumb was severed in an

and the glass cut the tendon.
Corwin Artman, substitute
tackle, suffered a broken nose in
scrimmage last night. He will
probably be out of practice for at
least two weeks.

teams on the practice field yesterday

work running signals and the second
team worked out against the third
squad.

afternoon when Warner called for the
second and third elevens to scrim- j

string men and told them to use as j
many of the U.S.C. plays as possible. !
