# BOLSHEVIKS ARE SET TO STAY IN RUSSIA---ROWELL
## Communism Is Now Passed Into State Capitalism Says Journalist BUSINESS MAY "FORDIZE" Russians Adopt Education For Propaganda Use in Creating "Reds" 
### 
"Although Russia is under a com
munistic system, its policy is that of
state capitalism, and the political gov
ernment of bolshevism is there to
stay," declared Chester Rowell in his
lecture last night in the Assembly
Hall.
"The economic phase of communism
has failed, giving rise to state capital
ism. Although private business is tol
erated, it must be small, and all con
cerns employing more than twenty
persons are owned by great public
trusts, which, however, are run exact
ly the same as our private enterprises.

"Russian business is now entering a
stage in which it finds its hereditary
source of capital exhausted, and it is
now considering prospective Ameri
canizing and Fordizing by American
and other outside capital."
Speaking of the educational situa
tion in Russia. Rowell said: "The pur
pose of Russian education is to make
good communists out of the people
through propaganda. An attempt is
made to raise a new set of minds ad
justed to communism. As a short cut
in initiating this movement, radio sta
tions have been set up to educate the
people by telling them the news and
facts which will make good commun
ists."
It is Rowell's belief that most of
(he Russian peasant class will be im
mune to this propaganda due to their
background of illiteracy.
Theory or Facts?
"The future of Russia depends oti
whether or not the facts or the theo
ries win. In theory the government is
communistic, and it is this idea that
Russia is trying to instill into the
minds of the peasants. However, Rus
sia is not communistic because the
peasants through passive resistance
have prevented the communizatiou of
the land."
In referring to the religious situa
tion, Rowell declares that although
the communistic leaders, in accord
ance with the anti-religious govern
ment, are atheists, the vast majority
of peasants are devout churchgoers,
despite the fact that the Russian of
ficials have abolished the central con
trol of the church. The danger is that
Russia will go on intellectually and
that religion may not keep pace with
other advances.
