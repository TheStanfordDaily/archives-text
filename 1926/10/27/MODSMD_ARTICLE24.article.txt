# Here's to 1930!

A letter received a few days ago severely reprimanded the members ;
of the Class of 1930 for their lack of spirit. The class has been considered '
by some as a bunch of sophisticated "do-nothings." The freshmen j
rather object to all these harsh criticisms, and rightly too. The truth |
of the matter is that the class's activities have not been duly realized
and appreciated by the rest of the University.
Take for instance, the sign to vote for California's Amendment 10
which is viewed by thousands of motorists as they pass the entrance i
to Palm Drive. The idea was original with the freshmen and came out;
of their own young heads without a suggestion from anyone, not even !
by the Scalpers Society. And the scheme was put over by the Class of
l l >3o. The money was raised from the members of the class itself, and
the canvas was hung by the athletic members of Encina Hall.
The whole affair was done with an ease and directness which could
well be an example to some of our campus officials and public-spirited
enthusiasts. For that matter, the work was done so quietly, and with so
little talk, that most of the campus did not even realize that the sign was
the work of the ingenious freshmen.
The way in which the freshmen have turned out for activities of j
all kinds shows that the class is far from dead and without spirit. It is
quite natural that the sophomores and others should criticize the new
comers to Stanford—it's a tradition.
We congratulate the freshman class on its fine start, and the only
word of advice that we offer is to warn them to be careful and not to
slow down before the year is over. The finish is far more important
than the start. —W.F.A.
