# Another Football Rule
## 
### 
W. W. Roper, head coach of Princeton University, received a letter
last week written by one Ivy L. Lee, Princeton '98, which is in part as
follows:
"I want to congratulate yon on making that agreement with Yale
prohibiting scouting. That is a fine sportsmanlike step forward and
should improve athletic conditions very much indeed. I have another
suggestion: Form a rule which would provide that from the moment
the whistle blows at the beginning of the game until the final gun, there
shall be no coaching whatever of either team other than by the actual
players themselves."
Can you imagine the P>ig Game in 1950 between Stanford and
Cailfornia with Stanford penalized 15 yards at the start of the contest,
because the coach had listened to the California-U.S.C. game over the
radio the week before?
If we add a few more regulations to the present football rule book,
we will have to have a hired translator at all games along with a referee,
an umpire, and a head-linesman. He might sit on a raised platform
above the field with the volumes of the rules. After each play the referee
could wireless up to a man in the stand, and ask his opinion on the last
play.
Football is alright the way it is now; why try to burden the game
with superficial regulations? Mr. Lee from Princeton prints a paper
called "Information," and maybe Mr. Lee is dickering for the contract
to print the new rule books that would have to be issued weekly if the
football reformers had their way. W.F.A.
