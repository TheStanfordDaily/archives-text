A very interesting "Another Viewpoint" was received yesterday by
the editor, but because it was signed "A Disappointed Frosh" instead of
by the disillusioned yearling's name, the literary bit had to be left out of
the paper. Once again we will quote the rule that holds sway in concern
to the viewpoint column :
The Stanford Daily will print any letter of reasonable length (that
your^sister could read) that is properly signed by the writer. If the
contributor does not care to see his, or her, name in print, the signature
■will be omitted at the request of the writer.
Now we suggest that if the disappointed one wishes to have his letter
printed, that he will send the article in once again with the proper
signature. —W.F.A.
