In yesterday's issue of the Daily
appears an ad inserted by the Wright
Act Repeal Association, a body headed
by Matt I. Sullivan, former Chief Jus
tice of the State Supreme Court.
The Association hopes by this, and
similar publicity, to convince the hon
est citizenry of California that Amend
ment No. i) should be passed at the
forthcoming election. By passing
Amendment No. 9, the Wright Act Re
peal Association holds that the voting
body will release a multitude of state
and local officers from the entertain
ing pastime of playing "find the bot
tle," and enable this same multitude
of officers to turn their attention to
the appropriate business of enforcing
state and municipal laws.

The Association has gathered any
number of high-powered statistics
which would seem to show, beyond a
doubt, that the Prohibition Amend
j ment, and its attendant nuisance, the
Wright Act, are largely responsible
, for the noticeable and regrettable ten
! den'cy of the country to go to hell.
As yet, Justice Sullivan and his as-
I sociates are modest in their aims.
They have not yet come out definitely
|as opposing the national prohibition
amendment. In fact, it appears to them
!to be a matter of little moment
whether or not we have a Prohibition
Amendment. What they object to is
enforcing the damned thing.
Need we say that we are for Matt
I. Sullivan.
