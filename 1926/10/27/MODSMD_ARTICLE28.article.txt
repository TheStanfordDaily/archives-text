The Editor, Sir:
Tired of swallowing the current
humbug as to Russia's government and
people two very well-known Califor
nians, Chester Rowell and Tully
Kpoles, went there to see for them
selves real conditions. IJoth have re
turned much impressed with the fact
that we Americans have been fooled
by scandalous lying propaganda. Says
Rowell, "The first thing to learn about
Russia is that the things you know
about Russia are not so. No such thing
as the nationalization of women was
ever thought of or proposed in Rus- [
sia." Moreover, "there are no illegiti
mate children in Russia —all children
are recognized as legal under the law."
True justice would everywhere insist
that no child should be born and lie
under a ban through life because of
r.iisdeeds of its progenitors. "For the !
most part Russian home life goes on
as i. did in the past. . . . Five years I
ago the communist party publicly gave ;

| up communism and adopted state capi- J:
talism. . . . The return of Russia to <
the family of nations is inevitable."
Tully Knoles, President of the Col
lege of the Pacific, after his sojourn
in Russia, came to a similar conclu
sion.
Our United States government pro
fesses unbounded devotion to the Mon
roe Doctrine, framed to keep our New i
World free from the European System
of Militarism. That same "doctrine"
(his message of 1823) includes equally
mandatory advice "to recognize all de
! facto governments." Why do we delay
to follow Monroe? Is anything gained
by our endeavor to make Russia a
pariah and outcast among peoples?
Ave our own politicians always such
entirely spotless souls that can afford
to throw stones at their rival states-1
! men in Russia? Why not lend a help- 1
ing hand instead? Who profits by our
I prolonged Political Pharisaics?
Edward Berwick.
