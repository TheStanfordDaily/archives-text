### 
Every day is moving day with Dr. J
Willis L. Jepson, Professor of Botany [
at the University of California and i
world traveler. Dr. Jepson, who recent
ly returned to the university after
spending some months in the Holy !
Land and in Egypt, has compiled valu- j
able botanical data from all parts of
the world. This information is in sixty j
priceless notebooks, many of which he j
refers to each day. Because the old
Botany building of the university is
considered a firetrap, Dr. Jepson has
to store the books in a great fireproof
cabinet each night.
As he starts his work each morning I
these books and specimen sheets,
many of which could not be duplicated,
must be moved from the cabinet to his
table. Valuable time, which Dr. Jepson
prefers to spend carrying on his work J
with forago plants, is consumed in
moving each day.
Forage plants which he found grow
ing in the arid regions of the Holy
Land are to be introduced into Cali-1
fornia if Dr. Jepson's experiments are
successful. Places in Southern Cali
fornia where the rainfall is not suffi-1
cient to support the two common crops !
of the state will be ideal for the crops
of the Palestine region, the botanist
believes.
"The two forage plants of California
were originally imported," Dr. Jepson
explains. "If we can import still others i
it will be of inestimable value to
cattlemen."
