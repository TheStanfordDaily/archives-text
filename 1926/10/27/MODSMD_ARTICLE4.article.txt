# TROJANS FLY HUGE BATTLE BANNER TO HONOR GRID TEAM
## 
### 
Battle flags of Troy are flying
at the University of Southern
California this week.
The gentlemen at that institu
tion of learning have hit upon the
novel plan of raising a flag—a
gold Trojan head upon a cardinal
background—to celebrate a foot
ball victory. This week it is flying
the death knell of California.
Likewise said Trojans have
magnanimously agreed to lower
their emblem in case of their own
defeat, thereby displaying true
sportsmanship, but incidentally
endangering the continued reign
of the above-mentioned flag.
Will it be flying after Satur
day's game?
