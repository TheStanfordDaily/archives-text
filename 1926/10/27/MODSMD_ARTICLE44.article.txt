# "Serenading a la Victrola" Is Failure at Willamette
## 
### 
Modern mechanical evolution at last j
entered the field of serenading one
night last week when an enterprising
young man at Willamette College went;
on a serenading tour of the sorority ,
houses armed only with a Victrola.
From the results obtained by the |
poor collegian, however, it seems that I
"serenades a la Victrola" will be heard '
no more at Willamette. Nowhere was
lie invited in to eat, or even presented
with a box of candy.
