After three piano numbers by his
accompanist, Bryceson Treharne, who
will play Rhapsody in B Minor, by
Brahms, Pastorale, by Scarlatti, and :
"Spoon River," by the popular Percy ■
Grainger, Graveure will conclude his i
program by giving the French selec- j
tions, "La C'aravane," by Chausson, j
i "II Neige," by Bemberg, "La Cloche," j
by Saint-Saens, and by singing the ;
English and American songs, "Time's
Garden," by Goring-Thomas, "The
Bird's Courting Song" from"The Hills
of Vermont," by Myrra-Clutsam, and
; "The Drinking Song," by Richard
Hammond.
Tickets for both the evening's per
! formance and the performances of the
j season have been selling rapidly. The
j $8000 has nearly been raised. Tickets
; will continue to be issued and sold!
' between now and the first concert, and
will be available at the box office that
j night. Since quite a few people have
! reported at the window in the Old
i Union building to obtain tickets al
ready paid for only to find that through
' some mistake they have no tickets ,
j c redited to their name, the manager, j
i Wilfrid Davis, requests that all people i
1 apply for tickets or give complaints
I before Thursday so as to relieve diffi
culties at the box office Thursday'
' night.
Alfred Hertz, conductor of the San
! Francisco Symphony Orchestra, was
on the campus yesterday to make sug- i
1 gestions for the arrangement of the [
• pavilion in order to better the acoustic j
properties of the building. Upon his ;
suggestion two great curtains will
cover the windows at either end of
I the hall, and two curtains each 150 ; i
feet long will cover the sides. A stage i
approximately 20 feet square has been
j constructed for Thursday evening, but
when the orchestra will give their
program later in the season this stage
will be enlarged to 33 by 45 feet.
