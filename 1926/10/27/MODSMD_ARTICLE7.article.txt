which is an annual event preceding the
U.S.C. game, will march up the Row
and over to Roble where yells will be
given, and back to the pavilion for
the rally. In order that all freshmen
will have time to prepare for the
pajamarino, dinner will be served at
Encina at 6 o'clock.
Both Squads Present
Both the varsity and freshman
squads will be present at the rally.
A new idea for the rally this year
is being planned by the Rally Com
mittee, in that there will be only one
act of vaudeville and the rally will be
held for its own sake.
Music, provided by Hugh Berner's
Cardinals, will be the only vaudeville
act. This orchestra plays regularly at
the Cardinal Hotel.
In order to help out with the songs,
the Glee Club will be present. With
the aid of the Glee Club and the music
the Rally Committee expects to put
plenty of pep into the rally.
Hunt to Speak
Coach Husky Hunt has been ob
tained as the principal speaker of the
rally. Prospects for both the varsity
game ,and the freshman game to be
played here, will be discussed. Other
speakers will be on the program.
The committee in charge of the rally
consists of Jimmy Farr, Hal Woolf,
John Levi, Hal Blazier, and Ewing
Sibbet.
Due to illness caused by over-excite
ment when Stanford won from Ore
gon Saturday, Boom Drumm will be
unable to speak or appear tomorrow
night, but he will be present at the
game at U.S.C.
Announcement of the rally to be
held when the team leaves on the
train will be made at the rally to
night. Yells will be given by Bob
Fraser, head yell-leader, and the as
sistants, Bob Frazee and A 1 Cass.
