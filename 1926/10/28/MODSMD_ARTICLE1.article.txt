# CARDS DRILLED AGAINST U.S.C FAST OFFENSE
## Searchlights, Ghost Ball Aid Varsity to Work After Dusk TEAM LEAVES TONIGHT "Pop" May Use Fleishhacker At Fullback Part Of Contest 
### 
With one more practice this after
noon, Pop Warner will add the finish
ing touches to a preliminary season
of preparation for the first and biggest
hurdle the Stanford varsity must take
if it hopes to remain in the conference
race, and that stands in the form of
"U.S.C.'s "Thundering Herd." After this
last workout and a hasty meal the
entire squad, accompanied by coaches
and managers, will board the "Lark"
about 9 o'clock and head for the Walls
of Troy.
Since the start of the year Warner
has had the Trojan game in view and
as a result has brought his team along
so as to be prepared for this contest.
The varsity has been drilled from the
first with a large number of plays cal
culated to sufficiently equip them for
the Southerners. The Cards were slow
in mastering their advance plans but
have recently taken faster strides so
that Saturday should find them with
their weapons sharpened and ready
for action.
Earnest Atmosphere
Ten large searchlights and the
ghost ball has aided the varsity the
last two nights to carry out their
preparations late after dusk. Whether
they are at the stage that they would
have been had they played football in
their earlier games is doubtful, but
the powc that has so far been only
faintly exhibited is about due to be
unleashed. There has been at atmos
phere of earnestness about the prac
tice field this week that promises
much.
Warner's chief problems have been
offense of Coach Jones' outfit and fig
curing a method of stopping the pass
ing attack similar to that which was
showered on the Bears. Besides this
Warner figures on the Cards doing a
little scoring themselves and his of
fense needed smoothing out. He appar
ently has decided on Bogue and Hy
land to aid Hoffman in this end. Post
was still on crutches last night but
it is probable that he will be in shape
Saturday. Millage has been used in
his place and is about of equal ability,
although Post has been showing much
improvement lately on the defense.
There is also a strong possibility
that Pop may use Fleishhacker some
of the time at full. This big player
who tips the scales over the 200-pound
mark has the makings of a first-class
fullback. In case Hoffman is injured
Fleishhacker will probably get his
chance. Patchett is out in suit but his
ankle is still weak and may keep him
out of the rough going, certain against
U.S.C. Joseph is also out, probably for
the rest of the season, with an injured
thumb. This about completes the list
of reserve fullbacks as Bogue has hit
his stride at half and is too valuable
there to switch to full. Warner has
been saving Fleishhacker, but if the
necessity arises he will undoubtedly
use him.
Power Plays Ready
Stanford will rely mainly on power
plays to carry the ball down the field
With Hoffman bucking the line and
Bogue and Hyland driving off tackle
it will take an exceedingly strong line
that will not give a little to such an
assault. Murphy and Hill will be ready
to enter to carry on the attack and
will not slow up the offense with any
noticeable difference.
Drury Out
Reports from the South claim that
Morley Drury, star Trojan half, will
not appear against the Redshirts, but
the chances are that the big fellow
will be there in his triple-threat capa
city. Kaer will be figured on for most
of the Herd's advances, but should the
Card forward wall stop the Trojan
backs, U.S.C. will take to the air. Be
sides Kaer. Jones has Williams, Thom
as, Laranetta, and Elliot, other speedy
backs that he can throw into the game
to harass the Cardinals. Captain-Crav
nth, Hibbs, Taylor, and Badgro are the
outstanding performers in the line
Most of the U.S.C. team are veterans
and they are all still smarting from
the unexpected defeat Stanford gave
them last year. They realize overconfi
dence largely contributed to theii
downfall this year.

backs that he can throw into the game
to harass the Cardinals. Captain-Crav
nth, Hibbs, Taylor, and Badgro are the
outstanding performers in the line
Most of the U.S.C. team are veterans
and they are all still smarting from
the unexpected defeat Stanford gave
them last year. They realize overconfi
dence largely contributed to theii
downfall this year.
With one more practice this after
noon, Pop Warner will add the finish
ing touches to a preliminary season
of preparation for the first and biggest
hurdle the Stanford varsity must take
if it hopes to remain in the conference
race, and that stands in the form of
"U.S.C.'s "Thundering Herd." After this
last workout and a hasty meal the
entire squad, accompanied by coaches
and managers, will board the "Lark"
about 9 o'clock and head for the Walls
of Troy.
Since the start of the year Warner
has had the Trojan game in view and
as a result has brought his team along
so as to be prepared for this contest.
The varsity has been drilled from the
first with a large number of plays cal
culated to sufficiently equip them for
the Southerners. The Cards were slow
in mastering their advance plans but
have recently taken faster strides so
that Saturday should find them with
their weapons sharpened and ready
for action.
Earnest Atmosphere
Ten large searchlights and the
ghost ball has aided the varsity the
last two nights to carry out their
preparations late after dusk. Whether
they are at the stage that they would
have been had they played football in
their earlier games is doubtful, but
the powc that has so far been only
faintly exhibited is about due to be
unleashed. There has been at atmos
phere of earnestness about the prac
tice field this week that promises
much.
Warner's chief problems have been
offense of Coach Jones' outfit and fig
curing a method of stopping the pass
ing attack similar to that which was
showered on the Bears. Besides this
Warner figures on the Cards doing a
little scoring themselves and his of
fense needed smoothing out. He appar
ently has decided on Bogue and Hy
land to aid Hoffman in this end. Post
was still on crutches last night but
it is probable that he will be in shape
Saturday. Millage has been used in
his place and is about of equal ability,
although Post has been showing much
improvement lately on the defense.
There is also a strong possibility
that Pop may use Fleishhacker some
of the time at full. This big player
who tips the scales over the 200-pound
mark has the makings of a first-class
fullback. In case Hoffman is injured
Fleishhacker will probably get his
chance. Patchett is out in suit but his
ankle is still weak and may keep him
out of the rough going, certain against
U.S.C. Joseph is also out, probably for
the rest of the season, with an injured
thumb. This about completes the list
of reserve fullbacks as Bogue has hit
his stride at half and is too valuable
there to switch to full. Warner has
been saving Fleishhacker, but if the
necessity arises he will undoubtedly
use him.
Power Plays Ready
Stanford will rely mainly on power
plays to carry the ball down the field
With Hoffman bucking the line and
Bogue and Hyland driving off tackle
it will take an exceedingly strong line
that will not give a little to such an
assault. Murphy and Hill will be ready
to enter to carry on the attack and
will not slow up the offense with any
noticeable difference.
Drury Out
Reports from the South claim that
Morley Drury, star Trojan half, will
not appear against the Redshirts, but
the chances are that the big fellow
will be there in his triple-threat capa
city. Kaer will be figured on for most
of the Herd's advances, but should the
Card forward wall stop the Trojan
backs, U.S.C. will take to the air. Be
sides Kaer. Jones has Williams, Thom
as, Laranetta, and Elliot, other speedy
backs that he can throw into the game
to harass the Cardinals. Captain-Crav
