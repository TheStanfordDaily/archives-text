### 
Roble, the Row, and the Pavilion
comprised the itinerary which 250
frenzied, pa jama-clad freshmen fol
lowed last nigbt at the U.S.C. rally.
The rally celebration was the first
event of the season in which freshmen
have had a prominent part, and the
Encinans were virtually the whole
show.
Student Body President Stanley A.
Weigel made a short talk on Stanford's
prospects in Saturday's game and com
pared the complexion of the varsity's
record this season to the ugly duck
ling of the fairy tale which eventually
made a decided change of feathers.
Weigel Leaves
Weigel leaves with the team Thurs
day night for Los Angeles. He will be
a guest speaker of the U.S.C. student
body at its rally Friday night, recipro
cating the compliment paid by U.S.C.
when the Associated Students of the
southern institution sent Leland "Dee"
TaUman to speak in assembly liefe
last Tuesday.
Hunt Speaks
Coach "Husky" Hunt articulated a
few words amid the general clamor in
the pavilion, speaking in encouraging
terms apropos the freshman squad,
which were cheered to the echo by
1930. Husky believes the varsity will
come out on top next Saturday and
inferred that the '30 squad would give
1 a good account of itself in the game
with the Trojan yearlings here. About
thirty members of the freshman team
were on hand at the rally.
Glee Club Leads
The Glee Club introduced the new
Trojan Horse song to the students and
was wildly cheered. They also took the
initiative in the singing of the other
Cardinal favorites. Yelling and singing
both were of an enthusiastic nature.
