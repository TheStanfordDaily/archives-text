# SATURDAY TILTS WILL ELIMINATE ONE COAST TEAM
## Idaho Faces O.A.C. Eleven, Bears Meet Oregon, Cards Battle Troy 
### George Story 
All three of the undefeated Pacific
Coast Conference football teams have
games scheduled for Saturday after
noon, and, inasmuch as two of these
squads do battle against each other,
it is a certainty, barring a tie score,
that there will be only two elevens
j having the right to answer "Here"
j Sunday morning when the roll of the
j unbeaten aggregations is called.
The most important game, of course,
! is the Stanford-U.S.C. tilt at Los An-
I geles, in which a claim to half of the
top rung in the conference ladder will
be decided. Should Idaho beat the
Oregon Aggies at Portland Saturday
the winner of the game in the Los
| Angeles Coliseum would have a clear
claim to first place, but it is hardly
possible that the Aggies will fall be
fore Charlie Erb's Vandals.
The other conference game features
Oregon against California in the Me
morial Stadium. Neither of these
teams has been able to break into the
win column since the conference sea
son started, but one's bad luck streak
is bound to be broken Saturday.
Huskies Play Whitman
Washington plays Whitman in a
| non-conference game and neither Mon
| tana nor W.S.C. has a game scheduled
j which will count in the percentages.
Each of these three teams has played
three conference games, one more
than the other members of the circuit
and two more than the Cardinals.
To try to pick a winner in the game
i at Los Angeles is useless. Practically
every one of the experts has made his
guess and most of them agree that, al
i though the Thundering Herd holds the
upper hand due to its great showing
against the Bears last Saturday, the
Redsliirts have a fighting chance.
Aggies Favored
The Aggies are favored to defeat
Idaho by a safe margin. They have
not played a game since they met the
Bruins two weeks ago, and, as a
result, every member of the squad is
in good condition for the fray. If the
Aggies play the brand of ball they are
capable of playing they should not
have a great deal of trouble annexing
their third conference victory.
Oregon is favored to beat California,
mainly due to the fact that the Golden
Bear is in very poor shape to present
much opposition.
