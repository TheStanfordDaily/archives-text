# LOUIS GRAVEURE WILL OPEN STUDENTS' CONCERT SERIES
## Belgian Baritone to Offer Variety of Lyrics, Sings Tenderly PAVILION IS REMODELED Sang on Campus in 1923 as Prophet Elijah in Oratorio 
### Herb Klein 
\V hen Louis Graveure, distinguished
Belgian-American baritone, steps on
the stage of the pavilion tonight at
8:15 o'clock, the Associated Students
Concert Series, the latest and one of
the most ambitious of Stanford's stu
dent projects will be officially opened.
According to present indications the
pavilion will be almost completely
filled.
The pavilion will be entirely trans
formed with a platform for the artists,
sound-reflecting curtain, and special
seats covering the basketball floor.
Tonight's program contains songs in
five languages: German, Bohemian
and Hungarian, French, and English,
testifying to Mr. Graveure's wide re
pertoire and linguistic attainments.
The German songs are compositions
of the three famous composers, Schu
bert, Schumann, and Brahms. Among
the Hungarian and Bohemian folk
songs one entitled "Shepherd, See Thy
Horse's Flowing Mane," is one of the
singer's finest dramatic efforts.
Bryceson Traherne, accompanist for
Graveure, will play a group of piano
numbers which will include Brahm's
"Rhapsody in B Minor." "II neige,"
one of the group of French songs, is
notable for its delicacy and grace.
