# VOCATIONAL RATINGS INCREASED IN NUMBER BY PSYCHOLOGISTS
## 
### 
Sixteen occupational ratings are
available in the Interest Classification
Service tests, instead of three, as a
result of the efforts of Dr. Karl M.
Cowder.v, Assistant Registrar, and Dr.
Edward K. Strong, Jr., Professor of
tlie Psychology department and the
Graduate School of Business. Occupa
tional ratings for author, advertising
agency, artist, banker, office
certified public accountant, executive,
minister, personnel manager, school
teacher, life insurance salesman, re
tail salesman, and Fuller brush sales
man, have been added to the three
ratings given last year for physician,
engineer, and lawyer.
Ratings by Letters
The ratings are by letters. A rating
of A means that one has the interest
of the occupation; a rating of C means
that one does not have the interest of
that profession; a rating of B is in
termediate. Some very successful men
rate only B in their profession, ac
cording to Dr. Cowdery and Dr.
Strong. Some men rate B in an occu
pation in which they are not engaged.
Dr. Cowdery and Dr. Strong com
ment upon their work that the data
accumulated so far indicate in a ten
tative way that the findings of this
test have significance, but they main
tain that research has not been pur
sued far enough to warrant guarantee
ing the results as final and adequate
as a sole basis for selecting a profes
sion.
