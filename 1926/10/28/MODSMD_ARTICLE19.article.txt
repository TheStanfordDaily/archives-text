# UNDEFEATED BABES MEET SPARTANS IN STADIUM SATURDAY
## Whole Yearling Season One Of Injuries, Accidents, Tough Breaks 
### Joe Carroll 
Only three more days and the Stan
ford freshman football team faces the
stiffest competition that they have met
so far this year, when they entertain :
j the University of Southern California
i yearlings in the stadium. This game
! will be the feature event of Saturday
| afternoon for those who do not travel
] south to the Stanford-U.S.C. clash. !
The freshmen have come through
| their entire schedule undefeated. They )
! meet another undefeated team in the I
! Spartans, as the Trojan yearlings are I
j called. The Spartans hold a 21. to 7 i
! victory over the California freshmen,
iin addition to having run up some
; large scores on the other teams that
i they have beaten. I
Spartans Strong ;
In last Saturday's game, when the
yearlings won from the U.S. Naval
j Hospital team of Mare Island 27 to 0,
j the Cardinal babes showed a type of
j teamwork that promises to provide
! the Spartans with a great deal of
trouble. They worked together well,
despite the fact that they were liandi-;
capped with injuries. The whole sea
son has been one of injuries, accidents, I
and men out for weeks or for the
season. But Coach Husky Hunt has to
have a team ready for the Little Big
Game, so he and the men who could
hobble have had to muddle through as
best they could.
Fetzer Good
Fetzer looked like a good guard last
week-end, not only in the line, but
also when it came to kicking off: i
Hodby, who has been playing fullback,
was shifted to tackle, because A 1
Forster will be out the rest of the sea
son on account of an injured leg.
hodby can kick, pass, and buck the |
line, so that his absence will be felt
keenly. However, Simpkins should be
able to take over his duties.
Laird plays well at half, but hasn't
the stamina to play an entire game.
He may not start Saturday, but he j
will surely see action before the after-1
noon is over. May is another half who
did some nice work against the sailors.
| Clark turned in some good headwork
| at quarter.
