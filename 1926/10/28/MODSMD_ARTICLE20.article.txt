# Special English 2A Class Is Planned for Freshmen
## 
### 
In the winter quarter a special sec
tion of English 2a will be Riven at 11,
MVVF, for freshmen who are probable;
English majors, and who have some
intention of writing. The section will
enable the students to remove the ele- !
mentary composition requirement in
the freshman year, and thereby give
them a chance to enter advanced
courses sooner.
All students who desire to enter this
section in the winter quarter should
turn in their specimens of their prose
writings to the secretary of the Eng
lish department, Room 207 A, before!
November 20, 1926.
