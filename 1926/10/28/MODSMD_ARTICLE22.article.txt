Tonight Louis Graveure, noted baritone, opens the concert series to
be held under the auspices of the Associated Students. Stanford is to be
congratulated on having the interest and initiative to carry through a
plan which will bring among the best of contemporary singers and
musicians to the campus.
No better argument could be advanced against the theory held by
many that university students as a whole occupy themselves with ath
letics, activities, and jazz to the exclusion of all that is generally sup
posed to be cultural. The number of tickets taken for the entire series
is evidence enough to disprove such a contention.
1 he student body responded well to the appeal that the opportunity
to have the six concerts should not have to be dropped. The sum
necessary to insure financial success to the undertaking is all but raised
in advance, so that continuance of the concerts in the future seems fairly
well assured.
With the arrangement of the pavilion under Alfred Hertz, the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra conductor, the acoustic properties of the
building will be as good as can be had.
And tonight Graveure will present a program of interesting and
appealing songs. lie was well received in a previous appearance before
the campus, and should provide an altogether pleasing and fit opening
to the A.S.S.U. concert series. —D.T.R.
