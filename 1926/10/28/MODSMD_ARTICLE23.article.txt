# U.S.C. Rooters' Tickets
## 
### 
At the start of this quarter the Graduate Manager's Office sent out
envelopes with elaborate instructions enclosed, which told exactly how
to apply for tickets for the U.S.C. game. To secure one rooters' ticket
and six general admission tickets the student would have to apply for
them before a certain date. Yesterday—three days before the U.S.C.
game—the envelopes containing the cardboards were sent out to many,
minus the rooters's tickets.
The only excuse the office offered for leaving the rooters ticket out
is that the deadline for applications was changed and an announcement
of the fact was printed in a small article in The Stanford Daily. If
the original instructions were issued by mail the changes in instructions
should also have been sent out in the mail. It is too much to expect the
Stanford students to read the paper so thoroughly that they will observe
every small article.
I he date of the U.S.C. game has been known since last winter, and
it seems queer that the ticket department could not have arranged the
distribution of the cardboards so as to avoid these last-minute changes
which result in disappointments for the students.
Another bit of poor management was demonstrated on the part of the
officials in regard to the band situation. The whole band was promised
to be taken to the South, and consequently the band members did not
apply for rooters' tickets. Now thirty members of the band are not to be
taken to Los Angeles and they arc without tickets. In other words, they
are just out of luck.
Kvery year it's the same old story. There is always a mix-up with
football tickets. 11 purely business methods were applied to the allotment
of tickets some of the difficulties might be eliminated. —W.F.A.
