# Congratulation from Oregon
## 
### 
The following message was received yesterday from the Southern
Oregon Stanford Club:
"The Stanford Club of Southern Oregon extends their heartiest
congratulations to the team for its wonderful showing and we know
it will keep up its good work. Pass our feelings along to the men
on the team and tell them we are with them every minute.
"J. H. Partridge, '12."
Every year when the team goes north the members of the Southern
Oregon Club, who are at Med ford, come down to the train and greet
the squad, and load them up with fruit. At Grant's Pass, just above
JVledford, another group of alumni does the same thing. Last week the
two clubs met the varsity going to Eugene, and again when the team
passed through on their way back to Stanford.
True Stanford spirit!
