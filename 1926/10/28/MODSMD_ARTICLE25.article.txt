Feeling that recent rallies have too
closely resembled vaudeville perfor
mances, the Rally Committee decided,
early in the week, to give the U.S.C.
game rally purely "for its own sake."
In doing this, the committee, as we
understand it, felt that it was adopt
ing a daring policy. Some fear was
expressed in the committee meeting
that a rally "for its own sake" would
not be properly attended. Let us look
for the reason bohind this perfectly
justified fear. Why is it that the stu
dent body does not support rallies in
the "good old fashion" unless a spe
cial inducement is offered in the form
of entertainment?
* * *
Time was when it was the particu
lar delight of the sons of Stanford to
parade down the row, for no reason
at all, offending the oral faculties of
the community with ribald song and
raucous shout. Given a reasonable
stimulus, such as the approach of an
important game, and they would top
matters off by beating upon tinpans
and by discharging whatever firearms
were available.
From time to time various morally
minded persons took it upon them
selves to protest against some of the
more attractive forms of diversion
which went to make up these parades
and rallies, i.e.. After the Washing
ton's Day Parade affair drastic meas
ures were taken to discourage crude,
frank, and smutty floats, skits, and
the like. At an earlier date, the sub
ject of ragging and manhandling pro
fessors had been thoroughly threshed
out with the result that this sort of
thing also had been banned.

I With the coming of these reforms,
interest in rallies gradually declined,
until it became necessary to resort to
the artificial stimulus of entertainment
of one sort or another. When the en
tertainment was poor, or when none
was available, it was (and is) the
| policy for yell leaders and Rally Com
| mitteemen to tell the student that
there is a moral obligation incumbent
upon him to come out and yell for a
' couple of hours at some time set for
the event.

Now, when one looks at the thing
from a clear, unbiased standpoint it is
sheer and unadulterated nonsense.
Yelling, of the type associated with
games is a form of expression. It
calls for an emotional stimulus. Any
normal, intelligent human being may
be expected to shout exhortations to a
player upon the field, or to reward a
I good play with a larnyx-rending bel
low.
However that may be, it is unrea
sonable to expect a man to march
| about the campus for two hours, yell
-1 ing at the top of his voice, with noth
ing to yell about. Granted that it is
a harmless diversion and perfectly al
j lowable for those who enjoy it, it is
nevertheless unreasonable to test a
man's loyalty to Stanford on a basis of
his willingness or unwillingness to
J engage in this sort of thing.
Now that the stimulus for rally at
! tendance has been removed, the Rally
! Committee doubts that the student
| body will attend a rally "for its own
sake." Possibly so, but what of it?
It simply means that certain of the
students have decided that it is an un
.
I necessary nuisance.
