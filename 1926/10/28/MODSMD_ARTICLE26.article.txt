What's the matter with our yell
leaders? I'm not one to find fault, but
when our yell leaders are too lazy to
get up and turn around to give a yell
for a player coming off the field, there
is something radically wrong. How
many noticed this at the Nevada game,
I don't know, but a great many re
marked about it later. It certainly
looks fine to have a player come off
the field after playing hard for Stan
ford and the yell leaders not budge
from their seats.
Another thing—Where's our rooting
section gone? When the yell leaders
do get up ambition enough to lead a
yell there are only a paltry few to
lead. Where's the old Stanford spirit?
At every Cal game this season an or
ganized rooting section has been pres
ent in full force. Every man that
comes off the field is given the yell
he deserves. Even bleacher stunts
have been pulled at the Cal games.
Can we say the same for Stanford? No.
Anyone who saw the California-
U.S.C. game certainly was impressed
by the spirit shown not only on the
field but in the stands. At Stanford,
we criticize our team, but no team will
work as hard as it would if the root
ing section and yell leaders were be
hind it. Also, at the California-U.S.C.
game U.S.C. yells and songs certainly
boomed out. The reason for this was
because each rooter had a small mega

phone. This is a good point, I think,
and it would do us good to adopt it.
Come on, Stanford, get on the boat
and show that you've got a little
spirit in you. Very truly yours,
A Disappointed Frosh.
