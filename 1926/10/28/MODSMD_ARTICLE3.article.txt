# SEARSVILLE LAKE COVERS PIONEER LUMBERING TOWN
## 
### 
By Margaret Cummings
j Somewhere beneath the lurking
i waters that bear its name, lies the
l town of Seursville, San Mateo county's
I pioneer settlement.
; Searsville 75 years ago was the cen
i ter of social and industrial life on the
| peninsula. Hundreds of mill hands j
were employed in its lumber industry, j
stages and fashionable carriages j
dashed up to its hotel hitching-posts,
there were sports and horse-racing on j
Sundays, $1000 stakes in poker games
I were common occurrences.
Founded 1850
j William Brown of San Francisco j
: founded the town in 1850, when he
i purchased a portion of the Coppinger
Mexican grant and called it "Mountain
| Home Ranch." This is now the Hooper
! property, a part of which adjoins the
I present Searsville Reservoir. In 1852 I
i came John Smith, and a year later
! August Ikerenketter established a 1
i store and hotel. Another hotel was !
opened in 1853 by John Sears, for
whom the town was named.
i One of the most dramatic chapters
in the history of Searsville was the
I career of Dennis Martin, who held the
i center of the stage for 30 years or
more. Martin came to Searsville about
i 1855 to become chief lumber operator
1 on the peninsula. Great wealth came
i to this lceen-visioned Irishman, and ;
his estate was widely known for its j
! hospitality. He built and furnished St.
Dennis' Catholic Church, and gave the J
land adjoining it for a cemetery —a j
| cemetery in which he now lies, un- |
| honored even by a tombstone.
Mills Fail
:* Overconfidence in those who called
! themselves his friends led to Martin's
downfall. He died a pauper and was j

buried in an unmarked grave in St.
Dennis' cemetery. Following his death,
evil days fell upon Searsville. The '
hillsides, leveled and bare, no longer
supported the mills. Complete extinc
tion came, when in 1887 Senator Stan
ford joined with the Manzanita Water
Company and the Spring Valley Water
Works in purchasing the townsite,
razing it, and converting it into a
reservoir.
Dam Constructed
Senator Stanford obtained the rights
of the Manzanita Company, and an
arrangement was made whereby the
Spring Valley Company should control
the reservoir, and should"furnish the
Stanford estate with all needed water.
Following these plans a dam was con
structed across Corte Madero creek,
pipes were laid for irrigation, and
Lagunita was made into a reservoir.
This provided for the overflow in the
rainy season, part of the water being
diverted into San Francisquito creek,
and part into Lagunita.
Rights Purchased
This agreement was reversed in 1919
when Stanford University secured pos
session of all the water rights, and a
title ot the dam, promising to supply
the Spring Valley Company with a
stipulated amount of water.
In 1921 the University purchased
more land, and raised the dam four
and one-half feet. This increased the
content of the reservoir to such an ex
tent that it overflowed the Portola
road, necessitating the raising of the
road bed.
At the present time plans are being
negotiated for the construction of a
Stanford Women's lodge on the side
of Searsville Lake opposite the Hooper
property.

downfall. He died a pauper and was j

buried in an unmarked grave in St.
Dennis' cemetery. Following his death,
evil days fell upon Searsville. The '
hillsides, leveled and bare, no longer
supported the mills. Complete extinc
tion came, when in 1887 Senator Stan
ford joined with the Manzanita Water
Company and the Spring Valley Water
Works in purchasing the townsite,
razing it, and converting it into a
reservoir.
Dam Constructed
Senator Stanford obtained the rights
of the Manzanita Company, and an
arrangement was made whereby the
Spring Valley Company should control
the reservoir, and should"furnish the
Stanford estate with all needed water.
Following these plans a dam was con
structed across Corte Madero creek,
pipes were laid for irrigation, and
Lagunita was made into a reservoir.
This provided for the overflow in the
rainy season, part of the water being
diverted into San Francisquito creek,
and part into Lagunita.
Rights Purchased
This agreement was reversed in 1919
when Stanford University secured pos
session of all the water rights, and a
title ot the dam, promising to supply
the Spring Valley Company with a
stipulated amount of water.
In 1921 the University purchased
more land, and raised the dam four
and one-half feet. This increased the
content of the reservoir to such an ex
tent that it overflowed the Portola
road, necessitating the raising of the
road bed.
At the present time plans are being
negotiated for the construction of a
Stanford Women's lodge on the side
of Searsville Lake opposite the Hooper
property.
