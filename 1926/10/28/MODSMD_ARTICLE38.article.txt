All students writing words for the
"Stanford Forever" march should have
their verses mailed to Box 143, Cam
pus, by Tuesday, November 2, accord
ing to Professor E. W. Martin, director
of the University band. With a ten
dollar prize as an incentive, a number
of students have already turned in
words, but more attempts will be wel
