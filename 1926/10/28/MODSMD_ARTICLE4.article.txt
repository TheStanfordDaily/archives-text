# THUNDERING HERD EQUAL TO CARDINAL TEAM DECLARES U.S.C.
## Veteran Outfits to Battle Again in Important Title Game 
### 
LOS ANGELES, October 27.â€”1t took
Southern California eleven long years !
to realize a victory over the Golden j
Bear of California, but the Trojans j
aren't spending that many minutes in j
celebration.
"We meet Stanford Saturday. If;
you want to celebrate go out and beat j
those Cards," said Coach Howard |
Jones to the "Thundering Herd" Mon-1
day when the team met for the first i
practice after the game with the
Bears.
Cards Bulk Large
The Cardinal machine bulks too
large on the horizon. Anyway you look
at it, the Cards and the Trojans will
go into the game on even terms. The
two elevens, with one or two excep
tions, are practically the same out
fits that battled in Los Angeles last
year. Stanford won that game, 13 to 9,
but the fight that the two teams put I
up will bring out a capacity crowd of
76,500 people to the Coliseum Satur
day. Every reserved scat is now sold
out. Twenty thousand general admis
sions remain to be sold.
Trojans Strong
The Trojans looked like one of the
strongest teams in the country against'
California. They may appear to be one i
of the weakest against Stanford.
Stanford's line is the enigma of the |
comparison of the two teams. If the j
Cardinal forward wall is as strong as
it is claimed to be, the "Thundering j
Herd" may find itself smothered.
Perhaps Southern California can
beat Stanford with mid-field plays, but j
Coach Howard Jones is trying to j
build up the line-bucking department j
this week.
