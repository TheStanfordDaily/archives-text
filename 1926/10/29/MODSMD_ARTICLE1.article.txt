# TROJAN-YEARLING BATTLE LOOMS AS ACID TEST FOR BABE ELEVEN
## Spartans Fresh from Victory Over Bear Cubs Bring Powerful Machine PLAY GAME TOMORROW Husky's Men to Encounter Famous Shift Play of Thundering Herd 
### Joe Carroll 
Tomorrow afternoon the Stanford i
freshman football squafl encounters
the University of Southern California
Spartans in the stiffest game the year
lings have had this season. With the
varsity playing the Trojans at; Los
Angeles, Coach Husky Hunt and the
followers of freshman football hope
that every person left on the campus
will be in the stadium at 2:30.
This struggle promises to be one of
the hardest of the season, for the
Spartans, as the Trojan freshmen are
called, have a strong team with a clear
record. Their impressive 21 to 7 vic
tory over the California Cubs is a j
decided indication of their ability. Last
week they played no game, but instead
took a rest in preparation for the
Cardinal game.
Spartans Use Shift
The Spartans use the same style of j
shift play that the Trojan varsity has
used so effectively. This shifting of the i
men in the line into play just before
the ball is snapped has worked well j
for both U.S.C. teams this season. I
Coach Hunt faces the same problem
that confronts Pop Warner —the build-!
ing of a defense that will stop this
method of attack. The freshman team
has been watching the varsity third
team executing some of these Trojan
plays, and has a fair conception of
the kind of offense it will have to
buck. Undoubtedly both the varsity
and the freshmen will have a special (
defease for the Southern California i
teams.
