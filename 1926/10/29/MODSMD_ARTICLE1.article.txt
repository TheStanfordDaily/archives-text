# TROJAN-YEARLING BATTLE LOOMS AS ACID TEST FOR BABE ELEVEN
## Spartans Fresh from Victory Over Bear Cubs Bring Powerful Machine PLAY GAME TOMORROW Husky's Men to Encounter Famous Shift Play of Thundering Herd 
### Joe Carroll 
Tomorrow afternoon the Stanford i
freshman football squafl encounters
the University of Southern California
Spartans in the stiffest game the year
lings have had this season. With the
varsity playing the Trojans at; Los
Angeles, Coach Husky Hunt and the
followers of freshman football hope
that every person left on the campus
will be in the stadium at 2:30.
This struggle promises to be one of
the hardest of the season, for the
Spartans, as the Trojan freshmen are
called, have a strong team with a clear
record. Their impressive 21 to 7 vic
tory over the California Cubs is a j
decided indication of their ability. Last
week they played no game, but instead
took a rest in preparation for the
Cardinal game.
Spartans Use Shift
The Spartans use the same style of j
shift play that the Trojan varsity has
used so effectively. This shifting of the i
men in the line into play just before
the ball is snapped has worked well j
for both U.S.C. teams this season. I
Coach Hunt faces the same problem
that confronts Pop Warner â€”the build-!
ing of a defense that will stop this
method of attack. The freshman team
has been watching the varsity third
team executing some of these Trojan
plays, and has a fair conception of
the kind of offense it will have to
buck. Undoubtedly both the varsity
and the freshmen will have a special (
defease for the Southern California i
teams.
the kind of football lie did against '
Oregon at Eugene last week he will!
cause the U.S.C. warriors not a little i
worry.
If there is a line on the coast better '
than the Cardinal forward wall, the i
Trojans have it, but it is indeed a
question as to whether there is one |
superior to the Redshirt band. Walker
and Shipkey, the ends, are veterans, !
and it is certain that the southern
backs will not run around them as
they did around the California wings
last Saturday.
Harris, Poulson Able
Harris and Poulson are good tackles,
and are well able to take care of their
duties. Captain Swan, an All-Coast
man last season, and Robeskv, a
mighty hard man to *keep out of the
plays, are equal, or very nearly equal, i
to the U.S.C. guards, and McCreery is !
playing the best ball of his career.
The reserves, too, are capable. War- j
ner has a man to fill in at every posi- j
tion and none of these would seriously i
weaken the Stanford chances.
Arriving in Gleiulale this morning, |
the varsity will go to the Huntington j
Hotel in Pasadena, where they will i
rest in the morning. In the afternoon ;
they are scheduled to go through a ,
light workout in the Tournament of L
Roses bowl and then back to the hotel
to rest for the game.
