# FACTOR DETERMINING CHRISTIANS POINTED OUT BY DR. JORDAN
## Says Scientists All Have God But Must Choose Own Religion 
### 
"What is the chief factor in deter
mining a Christian nation or a Chris
tian man? Is it church organization,
or creed, or ceremonies, or prayer, or
is it. after all, primarily the adherence
to the highest ideals of Jesus and an
effort to live in the light of His teach
ings?" This was the main question
raised by Dr. Jordan at his Thursday
Evening Conference last night.
Although he refused to commit him
self on any issue, Dr. Jordan outlined
the various elements to be considered
in deciding what constitutes a true
Christian.
Church Not Necessary
Dr. Jordan showed that there is a
doubt as to whether a man must even
be associated with a church to be a
Christian. He gave as examples, Lin
coln, Emerson, and Burbank. "Lin
coln," said Dr. Jordan, "as far as
churches were concerned, was like a
wandering maverick cal 1 12. Emerson
was in the same position; while Bur
hank claimed right up to the time of
his death that he was an atheist."
Continuing, Dr. Jordan said, "Every
scientific man I know believes in a
God, but he insists 011 defining that
God for himself. The systematic regu
larity and orderliness of the Universe
convince me that there is some sort
of a super guiding consciousness."
Dr. Jordan then traced the historical
growth of Christian organizations and
the development of theological dogma
as they changed with the progress of
mental thought. Throughout his lec
ture he emphasized the necessity of
tolerance in religion.
"Intolerance," he said, "is one of
the wickedest associates of religion.
The Pilgrims, for instance, came to
America to worship as they pleased.
Then they proceeded to make every
one believe as they did."
Concluding, Dr. Jordan made the re
mark. "It's better to be tolerant than
to be right. It's far better to be find
ing out the truth for yourself than to
have it fed to you."
