# STANFORD CONCERT SERIES PROVES A SUCCESS
## Louis Graveure Meets With Enthusiasm; Acoustics Found Satisfactory 
### Herb Klein 
Louis Graveure opened the first
Stanford Concert Series with a bril
liant recital last night before an audi
ence which packed the basketball pa
vilion and did not hesitate to show its
appreciation of the distinguished bari
tone's talent.
The concert was a highly successful
opening of the series of five which are
to be given during the coming year.
The pavilion, converted for the first
time to cultural uses, proved its acous
tic suitability, the most pianissimo
passages in Graveure's inimitable fal
setto style being faithfully transmit
ted to all parts of the house. In the
more dramatic passages the singer's
voice rang out full and clear without
disturbing echoes. Thus the last doubt
of the success of the series was . re
moved, for financially the series has
already assured itself.
Is Dramatist
There probably are baritones whose
voices are richer over the entire range
than that of Graveure, but it is to be
doubted if there are any who know
how to use their gifts so well. Gra
veure uses his mental as well as his
vocal powers in delivering a song. He
takes full advantage of the oppor
tunities each separate work affords
and never slights dramatic values.
The program opened with a series
of German songs. Following a slightly
heavy composition by Brahm's came
"Der Neuierige," a typical Schubert
number in its appealing melody. Here
was heard the flawlessness of Gra
veure's higher tones. He might be
called a finer tenor than baritone for
his upper register, especially in soft
renditions, was exquisite.
Some of the most typical Graveure
numbers were given as encores by re
quest. Such is the fate of a singer
who is knowu to render a song supei'-
latively WelL Dvorak's "Songs My
Mother Taught Me," "The Pretty Lit
tle Creature," a humorous old English
piece, and "Sylvia," given twice, were
among the numbers given in response
to the liberal applause at the close
of each group.
Piano Solos
A group of piano solos was rendered
by Bryceson Trehearne, Graveure's
accompanist. His technique was fin
ished, but there was practically no
feeling or emotional irregularity to
make them alive. Tiie effect was
rather wooden, though note for note,
the execution was doubtless as writ
ten.
