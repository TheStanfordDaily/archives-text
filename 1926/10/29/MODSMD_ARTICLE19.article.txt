Under the auspices of Des

Radio Rally will be broadcasted

Willitts of the band, and Stanford

When the first section of the Lark
stopped at Palo Alto last night, forty
nine members of the Stanford varsity,
accompanied by the coaches and ath
letic managers, climbed aboard. The
whistle tooted, the train started, and
the Cardinals were on their way to
their biggest test of the year, the
game with the Trojans of the Univer
sity of Southern California, scheduled
to be played in the Los Angeles Coli
seum tomorrow afternoon.
Warner put the squarl through a
long workout yesterday afternoon,
spending the first part of the time
running signals and the last and
major portion of the session giving
individual instruction to the members
of the squad as to what they were
expected to do on each play the
Thundering Herd started.
The squad is in good shape for the
game and should make a real fight.
E!i Post worked out with the first
string yesterday afternoon and, al
though his injured still causes
him a little trouble, it is almost cer
tain that he will be in the starting
lineup.
Backfield Named
The remainder of the starting back
field will undoubtedly consist of Hoff
man at fullback and Bogue and Hy
land at halves. Bogue has a sprained
wrist, but it is not bothering him to
any great extent and will not hinder
his playing against the Trojans.
Dick Hyland is going at top rate and
may show the Sons of Troy a little
more in the way of speed. He is as
fast as Morton Kaer or Don Williams
or any of the others, and if he plays
Numerous injuries have prevented
the freshmen from having scrimmage
this week, but signal practice and
work on defense lias been keeping
them going all week.
Devine Spartan Coach
The Spartans are being coached by
Aubrey Devine, former All-American
quarterback at lowa, who lias devel
oped a hard-charging line as well as a
shifty backfield. Tappan of Los An
geles High and Stepenovitcli of Ingle-1
wood, who were both high school cap- J
tains, are the U.S.C. ends. Komp at
quarterback; Wilcox and Saunders,
halfbacks; and Edelson or Barrager,
fullback, make up a dangerous back- '
field combination. Komp is a triple- j
threat man, who punts, kicks field
goals, carries the ball, passes, and di
rects the team satisfactorily. The 1
Spartans have two stellar line-plungers j
in Edelson and Barrager. In the line !
there is excellent material in several :
high school stars.
Despite the handicaps imposed by ;
injuries, the Cardinal babes have J
made an excellent record. They have j
won every game this season, defeat- j
ing some good teams in keeping their !
record clean.
