Under the auspices of Des
mond's Clothing Store, a Stanford
Radio Rally will be broadcasted
tonight over Radio KNX from 7
to 8 o'clock. Stanley Weigel and
Dee Tallman, Cardinal and Trojan
student heads, and several promi
nent southern alumni, will give
short speeches, while selections
from the Stanford band and the
Glee Club double quartet are also
included on the rally program.
Guitar solos by Neil Miller of the
Glee Club, cornet solos by Jack
Willitts of the band, and Stanford
yells by the band ensemble com
plete the program, which will be
closed with the singing of the
Hymn.

When the first section of the Lark

whistle tooted, the train started, and
the Cardinals were on their way to
their biggest test of the year, the
game with the Trojans of the Univer

to be played in the Los Angeles Coli
seum tomorrow afternoon.
Warner put the squarl through a
long workout yesterday afternoon,
spending the first part of the time
running signals and the last and
major portion of the session giving
individual instruction to the members
of the squad as to what they were
expected to do on each play the
Thundering Herd started.
The squad is in good shape for the
game and should make a real fight.
E!i Post worked out with the first
string yesterday afternoon and, al
though his injured still causes
him a little trouble, it is almost cer
tain that he will be in the starting
lineup.
Backfield Named
The remainder of the starting back
field will undoubtedly consist of Hoff
man at fullback and Bogue and Hy
land at halves. Bogue has a sprained
wrist, but it is not bothering him to
any great extent and will not hinder
his playing against the Trojans.
Dick Hyland is going at top rate and
may show the Sons of Troy a little
more in the way of speed. He is as
fast as Morton Kaer or Don Williams
or any of the others, and if he plays
