NIGHT EDITOR—FRANK BAKER
Beat U. S. C.
Tomorrow will lie football's clay. Nothing else will have a look-in,
or can command any interest on the clay of the U.S.C. game. At the final
whistle one of the teams will he eliminated from the roll of undefeated
teams. With less ballyhoo, but in as hard-fought a game, the Stanford
freshmen and the I'.S.C. yearlings will battle it out here in the stadium.
By tonight most of Stanford will be on its way South, and nothing but
absolute financial debility will keep the rest away from the game at Los
Angeles. Two thousan drooters will be on hand to encourage the varsity-
It will be a great game; win or lose, it will be the game of the year, but
it will be still greater with Captain Swan's men as victors. And Stanford
will have the fight to'win.
U.S.C. will come on the field the favorite, but it is more than likely ;
to be a different story at the close of the game. To be sure, its "Thundering
Herd" has run wild over most of their opponents and rolled up a big;
score against the Bears last Saturday. But past records will mean little
when it comes to a decision in the Coliseum tomorrow afternoon.
From a slow start the Cardinal varsity has progressed in each game.
Last week after a mediocre first half, it played real football to win easily
over the Webfooters of Oregon. This week there will be football from
the start, and real fotoball all the way through will spell a victory.
