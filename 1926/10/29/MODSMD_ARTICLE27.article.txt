# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The spirit which rebuilt the Big
Game bonfire in thirty-six hours last
year stilk exists in the hearts of Stan
ford men. It is an ever-present factor
in the local atmosphere, but it needs
leadership to make it an activating
factor. At the time of the event I men
tion the rally committee and the yell
leader had the punch and initiative to
make the best of a bad bargain and
turn a disappointing incident into an
event which brought honor to the
name of Stanford.
At the U.S.C. rally it was announced
that because of the shortness of the
time it would be impossible to learn
the new Trojan Horse Song. That
smacks of a crying lack of that fight
ing spirit in the hearts of those who

are entrusted with the responsibility
of leading us. A whole evening to learn
a song and we are not even given the
opportunity of trying it.
The above discussion may have a
destructive sound but it is leading up
to a suggestion. We are lacing another
bad bargain and once again we can
I (urn it to our glory. Why can't the
Rally Committee give out copies of
1 the song on the rooters' special and
i have practices in each car. Then a
copy could be given to each man in the
rooting section. As the rooting section
| is seated before the crowd is there, it
I would be possible to practice the song
I a few times before the game starts,
| with the aid of the band.
The day of calling for the students
to get behind their leader is gone.
|We are crying for leadership. â€”'27.
