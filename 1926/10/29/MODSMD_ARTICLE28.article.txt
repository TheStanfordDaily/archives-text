# BEARS LIMPING INTO FORM FOR CONTEST WITH OREGON TEAM
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 28.—With Marcus
out for the season along with Perrin
and Cockburn just barely able ot get
about on his sprained ankle. Coach
Nibs Price is having his troubles try
ing to get together a backfield com
bination to cope with Oregon when
they invade Berkeley Saturday for
their game with the California varsity.
Harold Breckenridge has moved into
Brick Marcus' place for the present
and will probably hold his place 011
the first team until Cockburn is again
fit to play. "Bretky" is the lightest and
fastest back on the squad and knows
how to utilize his interference. During
the few minutes he played in the
U.S.C. game Breckenridge showed up
exceptionally well on the defense and
perhaps Nibs wished he had been in
there sooner.
Andy Miller and Fred Coltrin rested
up the first part of the week. Miller's
ankle is still lame and Coltrin took
r ■ ;)11 ,round beating last Saturday.
Only tv. o centers are carried on the
va.-'ity squ .d so Miller's injury neces
; led converting Bert Schwarze, a
substitute guard, into a center to work
with the second team.
Both Clymer and Blewett were re
tained on the first team early in the
week, with Blewett calling signals and
Clymer in the halfback position he
played Saturday. Jim Dougherty, al
though he sat 011 the bench during the
entire U.S.C. game, is alternating at
the short side end with Steve Ban
croft. •
"Smoke" Francis, tackle on the Cali
fornia varsity reserves, was moved up
to the varsity squad by Coach Price
Monday night at practice. Francis was
a member of the varsity football squad
last year, playing end, but has worked
at tackle this season. He is a letter
man in track.
