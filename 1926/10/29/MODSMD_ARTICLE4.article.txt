# CARD BOXERS WILL VIE FOR FAR WEST RING CHAMPIONSHIP
## Coach Harry Maloney Takes Seven Men to Contest At Dreamland 
### 
Seven of Stanford's best boxers will
travel to San Francisco Monday night
in an attempt to bring the Far-Western
Amateur Boxing Championship to this
campus. Headed by Coach Harry Ma
loney and Captain Charles Miron, in
tercollegiate featherweight titleholder,
the team will enter the first round of
the Far Western Amateur tournament
which opens Monday evening in the
Dreamland ring in San Francisco.
Besides Miron, the men who will
represent Stanford are Alec Ross,
featherweight; Thomas Treamer, light
weight; Kenneth Lloyd and Lloyd Sul
livan, welterweights; Strant Hanna
and Miron Schall, middleweights. Les
ter Cowan and Norman Fain had been
entered in the featherweight and light
heavyweight divisions, respectively,
but the former recently developed, an
infected toe, while Fain has been in
the hospital with influenza until a day
or two ago.
Team Working Hard
The team has been working hard in
preparation for the tournament and
during the last week has been work
ing under the personal supervision of
Maloney. Tryouts were held Wednes
day in which each man boxed three
three-minute rounds, the length of
tournament bouts, and the result of
individual attention was very notice
able. Every man showed more ac
curacy in his punching, and each dis
played a strong offense. None of the
men are going south to the U.S.C.
football game, but will remain here
for'work under Maloney and his as
sistant, Ike Harwood.
Chances Bright
Of Stanford's chances for the title
in any division, Maloney last night
said, "The team is in good shape and
each man entered will render a good
account of himself. Miron, Schall,
Hanna, and Sullivan, with their ex
perience, should go far in the tourna
ment and I would not be surprised to
see a championship in one of the divi
sions coming to Stanford. The experi
ence gained from competition in such
a tournament will be of great value to
the entire Stanford team."
This fistic event will be the largest
amateur event of its kind ever held in
San Francisco. Up to date there are
eighty-five entries, and the advance
seat sale for the opening night has
passed the 3500 mark. Entrants will
come from all over the West, includ
ing Oregon, Washington, and Nevada,
and will come from as far south as
San Diego. Bouts will be three rounds
to a decision.
