# MRS. EDMUND HELLER TELLS ZOOLOGY CLUB OF SOUTH AMERICA
## Hardships Encountered in Collecting Specimens Vividly Described 
### 
Returning from an expedition into
the South American wilds, Mrs. Ed
mund Heller spoke of her trip at the
meeting of the Zoology Club Wednes
day evening. Mrs. Heller accompanied
her husband, a famous collector of
tropical mammals, on the trip.
"The work of the collector is very
poorly paid," Mrs. Heller told the club,
"but when one once embarks on such
a profession, it is almost impossible
to give it up. The dangers are many,
the concrete results are few, and yet,
in spite of all these disadvantages, the
life of a tropical collector is one that
is of utmost importance to science and
to the man himself."
Mrs. Heller emphasized thp hard
ships and dangers that a tropical ex
plorer must endure. Outstanding is
the deadly fever, which seems to come
to every white man who stays in the
jungle for any length of time. Long
trips are thus made dangerous as well
as tiresome.
Natives Fear Sick
Many of the natives are supersti
tious regarding sick or dead people,
and they will never touch a sick per
son in any way. It is therefore ex
tremely risky for one white man to
travel with a group of natives, for, as
Mrs. Heller said, "It is far from pleas
ant for a man nearly delirious with
fever to hear the natives discussing
how his belongings will be divided
after his death."
The tropical collector must be well
versed in science. He must know the
value of practical medicine, how to
equip a party, the conditions of the
country, as well as the language and
customs of the people.
Among the thrilling experiences that
Mrs. Heller encountered was the ex
ploration of some unknown caves in
the Andes Mountains. As the party
entered one of these caves they found
<1 savage ocelot within which immedi
ately attacked the explorers. The oce
lot was soon killed with the aid of a
machete and some bird-shot.
