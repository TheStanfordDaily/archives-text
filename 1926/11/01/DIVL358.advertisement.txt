Congratulations to Pop and his "Cowboys"!
That round-up of the Thundering Herd will never be forgotten at Stanford . . .
nor at U. S.«C.! If there was ever a gamer fight—we'd like to be cor

In other words, are you looking for a
good place to invest the extra funds
received from Stanford's victory?
Here's a suggestion. Get a pair
of those new, golden tan
brogues that have just ar

to pay twelve . . .
they cost but ten
