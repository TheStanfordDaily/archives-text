# CARD YEARLINGS OVERWHELM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BABES
## Freshmen Use Clever Plays To Trounce Spartans All the Way SIMKINS, MURPHY STAR Team Displays Great Power And Speed in Attack; Defense Strong 
### 
Twenty-seven points was the margin
by which the Stanford freshmen
downed the LT.S.C. yearlings, who
couldn't even score, Saturday after
noon in the Stanford stadium.
Outplaying their woefully weak op
ponents in every department of the
game, the Stanford babes presented
one of the smoothest-working combina
tions seen on the coast this yeaf. They
played brainy football. Although two
fumbles were made, which were both
recovered by Stanford, they came as
a result of hard tackling by U.S.C. and
not from inaccuracy on the part of the
Redshirts. Aside from that, Stanford's
play was flawless.
U.S.C. made no glaring errors in
play or generalship, but they didn't
have the power to combat the Cardinal
babes, who have a hard-hitting back
field and a potent line. Templeman
and Hullen showed particularly well
in the line, breaking through time and
again to smear the Spartans for
losses before they got started. Sim
kins was a consistent ground-gainer
at fullback for the team, making three
touchdowns, and Murphy at half was
much in evidence, the last touchdown
being credited to him. Steinbeck
played a sterling gatae at end, both on
the defense and as a receiver of
JFlodby's long passes. May also showed
up well at half. Wilcox and Kemp did
some good kicking for U.S.C. but that
was the only department of the game
in which they excelled.
Two minutes after the kick-off, Sim
kins shoved over a touchdown by'
pounding the Spartan line. During the j
"
rest of the first quarter, U.S.C. rarely
| got hold of the ball, and when they
did it was to lose it on downs. The
Babes, with the aid of Frentrup, Mur
phy, and Simkins, made another toucli-
J down just before the quarter
Score: Stanford 14, U.S.C. 0.
Much Punting
In the first play of the second quar
ter Bush made 9 yards around right
; end, and Simkins made it first down.
1 Frentrup made a huge gain through
| the line, only to fumble, but Burke re
-1 covered for good yardage. A 5-yard
I penalty for offside put the freshmen
| back and they failed to make their
i downs. Laird was substituted for
j Frentrup and May for Murphy. U.S.C.
! also failed to make first down and
I punted to Stanford's 20-yard line.
! Here the babes were stopped in their
! tracks and again forced to punt. U.S.C.
j returned the favor, and Stanford again
kicked, but this time from behind its
own goal line. From here Stanford
j advanced the ball by a combined line
plunging and forward-passing attack,
| culminating in a beautiful pass from
1 Hobdy to Steinbeck, who ran to
I U S.C.'s four-yard line before he was
; downed.
( Here the Spartans held for no gain
until the fourth down, when Simkins
j crashed over the line. Templeman was
hurt on the play and Lawshe was sub
-1 stituted in his place. Driscoll went in
! lor Laird. Just as the half ended Dris
coll blocked a U.S.C. punt streaked
away with the ball, only to be stopped
on the one-yard line as the whistle
blew.
Smith Spectacular
Smith came in at half at the begin
ning of the third quarter and gave
the customers a treat with his spec
tacular running back of punts. Sim

kins amassed a lot of yardage to his '
credit by delayed bucks through the |
line. U.S.C. stiffened and made a first
down this quarter by completing a
beautiful pass, but "Nellie" Smith in
terrupted proceedings by intercepting
one of their passes and not being
downed until he got to the 34-yard
line. The Spartans held again and
Stanford failed to capitalize on the
break.
During the fourth quarter Coach
Husky Hunt substituted everyone but
the water boy, and there was a con
stant stream of traffic on and off the
field. U.S.C. opened up .a desperate
forward passing attack in a last-min
ute bid for fame, but their attempt
was at first useless. The Cardinal
babes shoved over another touchdown
in this period, Murphy going over the
line. Just before the game ended a
completed forward pass to Chambers
netted U.S.C. a big gain, and they
followed up by hitting the babe line
for consistent yardage. The gun ended
the game with the ball on Stanford's
3-yard line and the Spartans* going
strong. â€¢
