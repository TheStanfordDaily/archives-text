# CARD YEARLINGS OVERWHELM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BABES
## Freshmen Use Clever Plays To Trounce Spartans All the Way SIMKINS, MURPHY STAR Team Displays Great Power And Speed in Attack; Defense Strong

Twenty-seven points was the margin
by which the Stanford freshmen
downed the LT.S.C. yearlings, who

and Hullen showed particularly well
in the line, breaking through time and

at fullback for the team, making three
touchdowns, and Murphy at half was

JFlodby's long passes. May also showed
up well at half. Wilcox and Kemp did
some good kicking for U.S.C. but that
was the only department of the game
in which they excelled.
Two minutes after the kick-off, Sim
kins shoved over a touchdown by'
pounding the Spartan line. During the j
