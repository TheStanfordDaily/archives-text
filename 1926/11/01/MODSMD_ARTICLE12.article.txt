# SAN MATEO DEFEATS 1930 SOCCER ELEVEN
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman soccer team
was defeated 3-0 Saturday morning at
San Mateo by the San Mateo Junior
College eleven in a contest which was
the junior collegians' all the way.
The 1930 aggregation, under Coach
Harry Maloney, got off to a poor start,
and found itself under a 2-0 count at
half time. The San Mateo kickers con
tinued their aggressive offense action
into the second period and forced an
other ball through the freshman net.
The game was the first played under
the auspices of the Collegiate Soccer
League, recently organized between
teams from San Mateo Junior College,
San Jose Teachers College, University
of California freshmen, and yearlings
of Stanford University.
