# DELICATE MACHINE WILL HELP TRACE QUAKE VIBRATIONS
## Seismometric Observatory Under Construction On Campus 
### 
Earthquake tremors, visiting Stan
ford after the first of the year, will be
recorded and located by the new seis
mometric station now being construct
ed on the hill back of the Lathrop
residence. The station is to be one of
four in the bay region, the others
being located at the University of
California, Lick Observatory on Mt.
Hamilton, and the California Academy
of Sciences at Golden Ciate Park in
San Francisco.
Funds Pledged
Funds to the amount of $25,000 for
' the stations were pledged last year by
San Francisco and Oakland organi
zations interested in the earthquake
problem, but work did not start until
this fall. The construction is under
the supervision of a committee from
the Seismological Society of America,
including Professor Bailey Willis and
Sidney Dean Townley of Stanford.
Maintenance and records of the Stan
ford station will be taken care of by
the University.
The instruments, now in the process
of construction at Pasadena, are to
be of the type invented by Dr. H. O.
Wood, the seismologist, and Dr. J. A.
Anderson, the physicist, at the insti
gation of the Carnegie institution and
installed in the Mt. Wilson Observa
tory laboratories.
The seismometer at the Mt. Wilson
laboratories regularly picked up the
starting of an electric car three miles
away by recording the vibrations
which the movement sent through the
elastic rocks to the foundations of the
building in which it was installed. It
consists of a fine wire stretched by a
weight, with a bit of copper wire
fastened to one side of it, and a mirror
attached to the copper. The first wire
is the thickness of the finest spider
web, is about six inches long, and is
