# DELICATE MACHINE WILL HELP TRACE QUAKE VIBRATIONS
## Seismometric Observatory Under Construction On Campus 
### 
Earthquake tremors, visiting Stan
ford after the first of the year, will be
recorded and located by the new seis
mometric station now being construct
ed on the hill back of the Lathrop
residence. The station is to be one of
four in the bay region, the others
being located at the University of
California, Lick Observatory on Mt.
Hamilton, and the California Academy
of Sciences at Golden Ciate Park in
San Francisco.
Funds Pledged
Funds to the amount of $25,000 for
' the stations were pledged last year by
San Francisco and Oakland organi
zations interested in the earthquake
problem, but work did not start until
this fall. The construction is under
the supervision of a committee from
the Seismological Society of America,
including Professor Bailey Willis and
Sidney Dean Townley of Stanford.
Maintenance and records of the Stan
ford station will be taken care of by
the University.
The instruments, now in the process
of construction at Pasadena, are to
be of the type invented by Dr. H. O.
Wood, the seismologist, and Dr. J. A.
Anderson, the physicist, at the insti
gation of the Carnegie institution and
installed in the Mt. Wilson Observa
tory laboratories.
The seismometer at the Mt. Wilson
laboratories regularly picked up the
starting of an electric car three miles
away by recording the vibrations
which the movement sent through the
elastic rocks to the foundations of the
building in which it was installed. It
consists of a fine wire stretched by a
weight, with a bit of copper wire
fastened to one side of it, and a mirror
attached to the copper. The first wire
is the thickness of the finest spider
web, is about six inches long, and is
made of tungsten steel. The bit of
copper wire is a half inch long aiul
about a tenth of an inch in diameter.
The latter being placed on the side of
the steel wire causes it to twist when
disturbed and the instrument is called,
•
therefore, a tortion seismometer.
Mirror Used
The record is made by the mirror,
attached to the copper wire, which
concentrates a beam of light on a ro
tating drum covered with photographic
paper on which the point of light
traces a record. As long as there is no
disturbance, the line is straight, but
upon disturbance a sharp zig-zag fig
ure is made by the vibrations of the
wire.
Origins Determined
These instruments are installed at
the stations, which are known dis
tances apart. When an earthquake
shock starts from a center within
sixty miles of these stations, it will
be registered by them. Since the pre
liminary shock, coming directly from
the origin through the rock to the
station, travels at the rate of 3.5 miles
per second, while the surface shock,
traveling along the surface of the
earth, moves at a rate of two miles
per second, there is an interval be
tween the arrival of the first and sec
ond shock which is registered on the
machine'.
Distances Measured
By computations from this it can be
determined how far the origin is from
the station. By a similar process, dis
tances from the other stations can be
measured, and the location of the
center determined.

tances from the other stations can be
measured, and the location of the
center determined.
Earthquake tremors, visiting Stan
ford after the first of the year, will be
recorded and located by the new seis
mometric station now being construct
ed on the hill back of the Lathrop
residence. The station is to be one of
four in the bay region, the others
being located at the University of
California, Lick Observatory on Mt.
Hamilton, and the California Academy
of Sciences at Golden Ciate Park in
San Francisco.
Funds Pledged
Funds to the amount of $25,000 for
' the stations were pledged last year by
San Francisco and Oakland organi
zations interested in the earthquake
problem, but work did not start until
this fall. The construction is under
the supervision of a committee from
the Seismological Society of America,
including Professor Bailey Willis and
Sidney Dean Townley of Stanford.
Maintenance and records of the Stan
ford station will be taken care of by
the University.
The instruments, now in the process
of construction at Pasadena, are to
be of the type invented by Dr. H. O.
Wood, the seismologist, and Dr. J. A.
Anderson, the physicist, at the insti
gation of the Carnegie institution and
installed in the Mt. Wilson Observa
tory laboratories.
The seismometer at the Mt. Wilson
laboratories regularly picked up the
starting of an electric car three miles
away by recording the vibrations
which the movement sent through the
elastic rocks to the foundations of the
building in which it was installed. It
consists of a fine wire stretched by a
weight, with a bit of copper wire
fastened to one side of it, and a mirror
attached to the copper. The first wire
is the thickness of the finest spider
web, is about six inches long, and is
made of tungsten steel. The bit of
copper wire is a half inch long aiul
about a tenth of an inch in diameter.
The latter being placed on the side of
the steel wire causes it to twist when
disturbed and the instrument is called,
•
therefore, a tortion seismometer.
Mirror Used
The record is made by the mirror,
attached to the copper wire, which
concentrates a beam of light on a ro
tating drum covered with photographic
paper on which the point of light
traces a record. As long as there is no
disturbance, the line is straight, but
upon disturbance a sharp zig-zag fig
ure is made by the vibrations of the
wire.
Origins Determined
These instruments are installed at
the stations, which are known dis
tances apart. When an earthquake
shock starts from a center within
sixty miles of these stations, it will
be registered by them. Since the pre
liminary shock, coming directly from
the origin through the rock to the
station, travels at the rate of 3.5 miles
per second, while the surface shock,
traveling along the surface of the
earth, moves at a rate of two miles
per second, there is an interval be
tween the arrival of the first and sec
ond shock which is registered on the
machine'.
Distances Measured
By computations from this it can be
determined how far the origin is from
the station. By a similar process, dis
tances from the other stations can be
measured, and the location of the
center determined.
