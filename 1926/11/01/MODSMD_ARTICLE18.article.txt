# DR. A.H. REINHARDT ADVOCATES CHANGE IN COLLEGE YEARS
## Looks Forward to Abolition Of Lower Division's Curricula 
### 
That the now educational institution
called junior college is compelling the
United States to redefine all its edu
cational institutions, and especially to
restate the real and the ideal purpose
of university education, is the opinion
of Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, presi
dent of Mills College.
Dr. Reinhardt looks forward to a
plan requiring six years of elementary
education, six years of secondary edu
cation, and three years in a university?
the last year to be for a degree with
the value of a present master's, per
haps. The lower division work now
given in colleges and universities will
be compressed into high school or
junior college curricula.
"Europeans do not understand our i
system of 'required units,' " she smiled, j
"'You have 124 units?' they will ask i
an American graduate. 'No compre-!
hende! What is a unit?' The lower
division college prerequisites are com
pleted in secondary institutions; in |
the high school, the lycee, or the gym- j
nasium. Their university years are |
spent in research in a special field and
in professional study. In the United j
States the course of study through the j
University takes two years more
time than in Europe and then finds us
a year less advanced. Most of our;
graduates must study three years be- j
fore being granted a master's degree j
across the Atlantic. It seems to me !
unless our educators develop some'
such system, we will never be able
to bridge this gap in training. The |
older countries both save time and in- 1
crease attainment."
"Imagine how different your under- ]
graduate years would be if they were
dominated by the idea that at the end ;
of yonr training you would be exam-1
ined in your major subject. Would
your work not be more carefully and
comprehensively planned?" she ques
tioned. "You will live to see this
change take place, I am sure."
