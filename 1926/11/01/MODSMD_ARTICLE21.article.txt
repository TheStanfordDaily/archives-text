By a score of 13-12 the plucky Stan
ford eleven defeated the University of
Southern California in the Los Angeles
| Coliseum Saturday before a crowd of
nearly 80,000 people, the largest at
| tendance that has ever packed the
great bowl.
U.S.C. Leads
The "Thundering Herd" took an
early lead on the first play of the
second quarter when Lrtranrfta broke
■ around Walker's end for a score after
Hie Trojans had advanced by means of
a long pass to Hibbs, who was downed
jon Stanford's 22-yard line. Laraneta
failed to convert but nothing was
! thought of this, as Coach Jones' team
looked as though they would make
, more scores before the afternoon was
I over.
Things looked darker when later
in the same period Thomas scooped up
a fumble by Hoffman and raced fifty
yards to a touchdown behind the in
terference of Heiser, who held off Hill*
the only Card player between the run
ner and goal line. Again Laraneta's
kick was blocked.
Stanford Aroused
Stanford's ire was aroused and they
fought their way to a touchdown short
ly before the half ended. *Hill took the
ball on the kickoff and returned it to
Stanford's 48-yard line. Then Bogue
replaced him and runs by the former
and bucks by Hoffman and a pass,
j Hoffman to Shipkey, advanced the ball
' to the 21-yard line. The Cards had
seven yards to make on the last down
I when Bogue stepped back to pass and
found his receiver covered. He decided
to run. He dashed past the prostrated
| forms of the U.S.C. players to the five-
I yard liue where he was downed. Hoff
man plunged over n>ur players for a
touchdown Bogue's kick hit the up
right nad bounded back.
Stanford scored again in the quarter
[ following the feature play of the
| game, a forty-one-yard pass from Hoff
-1 man to Hyland and a subsequent fif
! teen-yard run by the latter for a touch
down. It was an accurate pass and
Tricky Dick took the ball over his
shoulder at a full gallop, eluding the
Trojan half at his heels. This time
Bogue converted and the one point
turned out to be the deciding factor in
the contest.
Trojans Smeared
Stanford played heady defensive ball
the rest of the game and kept the des
perate Trojans in check. Many of
U.S.C.'s passes were smeared before
they were thrown, and many of those
that were not smeared were inter
cepted, at which game McCreery took
all honors. As the contest progressed,
the Cards.improved, and although they
had trouble in figuring the tricky shift
of the Trojans at the start, at the end
they charged fast and assumed the
position of master of the situation.
Ilyland, Bogue, and Hoffman were
the star performers in the Card back
field. Hyland was sure at safety and
got off some punts. Bogue's individual
efforts were deserving of much com
mendation. Hoffman responded when
called on for yai'dage, and his long
passes provided thrills for the spec
tators.
Captain Swan and McCreery were
the outstanding players on the line
along with Shipkey and Walker.

! Trojan backfield and Cravath, Hibbs,
I and Taylor performed well on the line.

failed to convert but nothing was
! thought of this, as Coach Jones' team
looked as though they would make
, more scores before the afternoon was
I over.
Things looked darker when later
in the same period Thomas scooped up
a fumble by Hoffman and raced fifty
yards to a touchdown behind the in
terference of Heiser, who held off Hill*
the only Card player between the run
ner and goal line. Again Laraneta's
kick was blocked.
Stanford Aroused
Stanford's ire was aroused and they
fought their way to a touchdown short
ly before the half ended. *Hill took the
ball on the kickoff and returned it to
Stanford's 48-yard line. Then Bogue
replaced him and runs by the former
and bucks by Hoffman and a pass,
j Hoffman to Shipkey, advanced the ball
' to the 21-yard line. The Cards had
seven yards to make on the last down
I when Bogue stepped back to pass and
found his receiver covered. He decided
to run. He dashed past the prostrated
| forms of the U.S.C. players to the five-
I yard liue where he was downed. Hoff
man plunged over n>ur players for a
touchdown Bogue's kick hit the up
right nad bounded back.
Stanford scored again in the quarter
[ following the feature play of the
| game, a forty-one-yard pass from Hoff
-1 man to Hyland and a subsequent fif
! teen-yard run by the latter for a touch
down. It was an accurate pass and
Tricky Dick took the ball over his
shoulder at a full gallop, eluding the
Trojan half at his heels. This time
Bogue converted and the one point
turned out to be the deciding factor in
the contest.
Trojans Smeared
Stanford played heady defensive ball
the rest of the game and kept the des
perate Trojans in check. Many of
U.S.C.'s passes were smeared before
they were thrown, and many of those
that were not smeared were inter
cepted, at which game McCreery took
all honors. As the contest progressed,
the Cards.improved, and although they
had trouble in figuring the tricky shift
of the Trojans at the start, at the end
they charged fast and assumed the
position of master of the situation.
Ilyland, Bogue, and Hoffman were
the star performers in the Card back
field. Hyland was sure at safety and
got off some punts. Bogue's individual
efforts were deserving of much com
mendation. Hoffman responded when
called on for yai'dage, and his long
passes provided thrills for the spec
tators.
Captain Swan and McCreery were
the outstanding players on the line
along with Shipkey and Walker.
lvaer was the individual star of the
! Trojan backfield and Cravath, Hibbs,
I and Taylor performed well on the line.
By a score of 13-12 the plucky Stan

nearly 80,000 people, the largest at
