# On Second Thought

Then (he Indians gathered out where the rolling foothills rise—and
in small groups they talked of the hunt. A smile of satisfaction spread
over the Redskins' faces as they watched the Herd-stomp within the
small confines of the corral.
The storm is over and what little thunder there was —can no longer
be heard. The sky is Crimson!
So it is after the Stanford-Southern California game. A review of
the week-end brings memories of the sportsmanship that was shown
by the team, the rooters, and the spectators.
After the game the two captains had nothing but praise for the good,
hard, clean game played by all concerned. Southern sports writers
•lid yesterday that the game was the hardest fought of the season. Yet
not once was there anything but clean playing.
The rooting section could not be held in check. They yelled when
they wanted to and because they wanted to. Never once did the yell
leaders have to encourage the section as has at past times been necssary
according to their thought. Both sections were yelling and fighting for
the men on the field—but through it all both groups radiated sportsman
ship.
And as for the spectators, they felt the spirit and followed. The
sport critics made no attempt to excuse anyone and they did justice to
the game from both points of view when they told the general public
what had happened and how it happened.
\\ ith all this in mind the days of severed relations and mud-slinging
between Stanford and Southern California seem far in the dim distant
past.
Last week Dee Tallman, president of the Associated Students of the
University of Southern California, spoke to the Stanford men in an
assembly and urged a closer relationship between the two institutions.
He was well received. No better indication of the spirit of the two
institutions could have been expressed than the results of the week-end.
