# A 						Complete Victory
## 
### 
Th football game between Stanford and the University of Southern
California Saturday resulted in a complete victory for the Redslrirts. It
was a victory for the Stanford team, a victory for the Stanford rooters,
and a victory for Pop Warner. To say nothing of how Husky Hunt and
his yearlings triumphed over the Trojan freshmen.
Stanford had traveled from Oregon to Palo Alto, and then on again
to Los Angeles with hardly a breathing spell in between the two trips.
The team had hardly regained their land legs before the whistle blew
Saturday. Stanford had something lacking in their make-up, according to
the football experts on the coast. The Cardinals hardly had a chance
against the powerful Trojan eleven which had swept everything before
her u]) to last week-end. The odds were all against the Cardinals.
Stanford was the underdog.
Then Stanford went into the game and won a complete victory.
Although the score was close—one small point separated the winning
Stanford team from the beaten U.S.C. eleven —everyone that saw the
game admits it was all Stanford.
On the substitute benches, Saturday, sat two of the greatest coaches
in the country, but one of these two proved he was a little greater than
the other. Pop Warner is just too clever for Jones. Maybe Jones gets
an inferior complex when his team is playing a Warner's eleven, but at
any rate Jones has never been able to beat Warner. As one sport writer
said after the game, "it will teach those that bet on football never to
feci confident when they have placed money against Warner." The
situation never gets so dark as to get out of Pop's control.
Where the main credit lies is with the team —the team that played
all the harder when twelve points were against them. Stanford realized
at the start of the game that they were up against eleven football men
who were, at least, as good as themselves. Some of these Trojans had
been mentioned as Ail-American prospects, and all of them rated as the
Coast's best. But the Redshirts decided to test these men out, and see
if they were as good as they were cracked" up to be. Stanford still has
plenty of respect for their ability, but the Trojans also acquired some
respect for the Stanford football men.
The Stanford freshman football eleven is not to be overlooked. While
their big brothers were beating the Trojans in the South, the 1930 team
was handing the U.S.C. freshmen a trouncing right here in our stadium.
The freshmen, like the varsity, were doped to lose mainly because the
Trojan team had so decidedly beaten the California freshmen one week
ago.
Stanford freshmen won 27 to 0 and the seventy-five rooters that sat
in the rooting section serpentined the stadium, and staged an impromptu
rally in the gymnasium.

Stanford had traveled from Oregon to Palo Alto, and then on again
to Los Angeles with hardly a breathing spell in between the two trips.
The team had hardly regained their land legs before the whistle blew
Saturday. Stanford had something lacking in their make-up, according to
the football experts on the coast. The Cardinals hardly had a chance
against the powerful Trojan eleven which had swept everything before
her u]) to last week-end. The odds were all against the Cardinals.
Stanford was the underdog.
Then Stanford went into the game and won a complete victory.
Although the score was close—one small point separated the winning
Stanford team from the beaten U.S.C. eleven —everyone that saw the
game admits it was all Stanford.
On the substitute benches, Saturday, sat two of the greatest coaches
in the country, but one of these two proved he was a little greater than
the other. Pop Warner is just too clever for Jones. Maybe Jones gets
an inferior complex when his team is playing a Warner's eleven, but at
any rate Jones has never been able to beat Warner. As one sport writer
said after the game, "it will teach those that bet on football never to
feci confident when they have placed money against Warner." The
situation never gets so dark as to get out of Pop's control.
Where the main credit lies is with the team —the team that played
all the harder when twelve points were against them. Stanford realized
at the start of the game that they were up against eleven football men
who were, at least, as good as themselves. Some of these Trojans had
been mentioned as Ail-American prospects, and all of them rated as the
Coast's best. But the Redshirts decided to test these men out, and see
if they were as good as they were cracked" up to be. Stanford still has
plenty of respect for their ability, but the Trojans also acquired some
respect for the Stanford football men.
The Stanford freshman football eleven is not to be overlooked. While
their big brothers were beating the Trojans in the South, the 1930 team
was handing the U.S.C. freshmen a trouncing right here in our stadium.
The freshmen, like the varsity, were doped to lose mainly because the
Trojan team had so decidedly beaten the California freshmen one week
ago.
Stanford freshmen won 27 to 0 and the seventy-five rooters that sat
in the rooting section serpentined the stadium, and staged an impromptu
rally in the gymnasium.
Yes, it was a complete victory! —W.F.A.
Th football game between Stanford and the University of Southern
California Saturday resulted in a complete victory for the Redslrirts. It
was a victory for the Stanford team, a victory for the Stanford rooters,
and a victory for Pop Warner. To say nothing of how Husky Hunt and
his yearlings triumphed over the Trojan freshmen.
