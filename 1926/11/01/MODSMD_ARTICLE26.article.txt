For the benefit of our readers who
have sent in clippings from several
college newspapers anent the perpetu
ation of antiquated forms of "rah
rahism," let it be here noted that these
clippings have been duly received and
carefully noted. Only the fact that we
were afraid of kicking a fallen oppo
nent kept us from printing all ef them.
It is encouraging to know that there
are those who feel the same way we
do about the whole business. And it
is more encouraging still to have those
sympathizers go out of their various
ways to send us material.

Opinions vs. Personalities
It comes to our ears that members
of the Trojan Knights, senior honor
society of the University of Southern
California, would like to know whether
or not we bear them any personal
grudge.
The answer is no. It merely hap

pened that at the moment when we
were about to direct our wrath against
6ophomorlc shenanigans in general,
our eyes fell upon an item from the
Daily Trojan which related a particu
lar case of pseudo-comical hazing per
petrated by the Trojan Knights.
Some other organization might have
been used as the specific case in point
or else the Trojan Knigths, at the
moment wherv their activities drew
our attention, might have been be
having themselves in such a manner
as to draw from our typewriter words
of praise.
As a matter of fact, whenever some
honor society other than the Trojan
Knights does something particularly
ridiculous, we shall be only too glad
to comment upon that fact. In the
same way, whenever the Trojan
Knights perform some unsually meri
torious service we shall not hesitate
to throw a few bouquets.
