# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford today is celebrating a most
joyous occasion. Her alumni are pat
ting themselves on the pocketbook,
and complimenting our team. Stanford
spirit is at a pitch.
There is only one thing that has
happened to date that has marred the
spirit in my estimation. That is a small
matter about the Hymn. At the U.S.C. j
assembly a short time ago, the yell
leader concluded the meeting by lead-,
ing the fellows in singing the Hymn.
Toward the end of the verse, Bob
thought that the song was lagging and
he increased the tempo at which he j
was leading. Not getting the desired
result by gesture alone, he stamped ,
his feet! I didn't sing any more. Then j
I decided that he didn't think of the
effect he produced on myself, and
others, so I dismissed it from my mind.
The night of the Pajamarino he did
the same thing. I began to wonder!
whether Stanford men wanted to hear i
someone's heels hitting the floor in
time to their Hymn. It seems to me
that if there is ANY SONG at Stanford
that should be sung as our hearts dic
tate, it should be "Hail, Stanford,
Hail!" —Bull Pen.
The Editor, Sir:
The students and friends of Stanford
University were presented with a glar- j
ing advertisement in Tuesday's \
"Daily." In large type were the start
ling words, "Repeal the Wright Act — {
Vote "Yes" on No. 9," and below three j
reasons were given for such a vote:
first, "a 'yes' vote on No. 9 gives your -
views to Congress on modification of
prohibition"; secondly, "reduce taxes |
and eliminate graft"; and" thirdly, "per
mit police to devote all time to real
crime."
Will the readers of the "Stanford
Daily" note two or three facts and
compare them with the statements
made in the political advertisement?
1. The repeal of tbe Wright Act
would not modify prohibition. We

tnust admit that enforcement of the
Eighteenth Amendment in California |
is not perfect, but the repeal of the
Wright Act would leave the enforce- !
ment of this law to two federal courts
and seventy-five federal enforcement
officers. If bootlegging is difficult to
control now, what would happen if
we remove all of our state enforce
ment officers? Instead of modifying
constitutional prohibition, we will
open the way for lawlessness and cor
ruption in our "Golden State."
2. Facts show that liquor criminals,
through fines, pay the cost of their
own detection, prosecution, and im
prisonment.
3. Crime means a violation of the
law. Regardless of our own legisla
tive measures, the refusal on the part
of any citizen to obey the Constitution
of the United States certainly is a
criminal offense. What more could be
included in the term "real crime"?
At the close of the advertisement*
were the words: "Every Liberty-Lov
ing Citizen Will Vote 'Yes* on No. 9."
"Liberty-loving" must mean "anarchy
loving." Rather let us say: "Every
true American who loves the funda
mental law of this country, who loves
peace and progress, who- loves pros
perity in business, who loves high
moral standards will vote 'No' on No.
9."
Dr. David Starr Jordan has written
the argument against the withdrawal
of the Wright Act, which will appear
on every ballot. He closes his argu
ment by saying: "The proposed repeal
of tlie Wright Law is in no sense a
referendum on the liquor question.
The chief issue involved is respect for
law!"
As students of Stanford University,
let us work to keep the Wright Act
on our statutes and favor law and
order in this state!
