# ANDY KERR MAKING FINE RECORD WITH W. & J. GRID TEAM
## 
### 
Undefeated until Saturday's game
with the strong Lafayette team, Coach
Andy Kerr's Washington and Jefferson
warriors have met with marked suc
cess during the former Stanford
coach's first season as football mentor
at the eastern institution. Piling up
104 points to their opponents' 43, the
W. & J. men defeated some of the
strongest elevens of their section and
only lost to Lafayette through a last
minute rally, 16-10.
By comparative scores the W. & J.
team ranks as one of the best in the

country, having defeated the Carnegie
Tech team 17 to G before its defeat of
Pittsburgh. Other victories were:
Fordham, 28-13; Rutgers, 19-6; Buck-
Waynesburg, 130.
Coach Kerr, formerly Glenn War
ner's assistant at Pittsburgh, was
head football coach at Stanford the
two years before "Pop" took charge
himself, when Kerr was made assist
ant football coach and head basketball
coach, which positions he held until
last spring when he accepted a three
year contract with Washington and
Jefferson University as head football
and basketball coach.
"Andy" probably feels right at home
winning games at W. & J., as he spent
most of his life in Pennsylvania, a
good part of it winning football con
tests there. He was a basketball and
football star first at Carlisle high
school and then at Dickinson College
in his home town of Carlisle.
His athletic prowess won him a
coaching position at Johnstown high
school, which he held for six years.
Next he became coach at Central high
in Pittsburgh, and from the fall of
1905 until 1914 his teams developed a
national reputation. In 1914 Pop War
ner brought him to the University of
Pittsburgh where he was freshman
football coach and varsity basketball
and track coach until the fall of 1922
when he came to Stanford. Last year
Kerr expressed his intention of re
turning to the coast when his eastern
contract expires.
