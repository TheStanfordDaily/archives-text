# CHINESE TROUBLES TRACED TO SOURCE BY U.C. INSTRUCTOR

"What is the matter with China? j
Why is such misgovernment and mili- j
tarism possible.
These are questions that N. Wing [
Mali, Chinese instructor in political
science at the University of California,
has answered in the University of Cal- !
ifornia "Chronicle," as follows:
"Politically disorganized China is
the inevitable outcome of an ancient
land and its people trying to transform
itself into a modern state, and at the
outset making a poor attempt at it. It
is the direct result of Western powers
dragging a medieval China, virtually
against her will, into the Western
dominated circle of nations. These
powers required nearly a hundred j
years to inducer to look favorably j
upon the suggestion to become one of !
themselves.
"In this age of International compe- j
tition in commerce and industry, in.j
which the demand for raw materials |
is ever pressing, and where markets j
for finished products are everywhere
eagerly sought, no portion of the
world will be left undisturbed if it j
meets either or both of these condi- i
tions. And China fulfills them admir- j
ably. If international peace and good-'
will among nations do not motivate
and guide the policy of interested pow- J
ers in dealing with the Far Eastern
question, the world will be faced with
the constant fear and suspense of the j
repetition, perhaps in greater magni- â€¢
tude, of the conflagration of 1914-18.
"The Chinese revolution of 1911 was
but a milestone in the Westernization
of China. The youth of China, the new
intelligentsia, is the fiery spirit and I
living force that is coming to domi-1
nate China. Their activities have been |
both destructive and constructive. For |
the latter they have as yet to produce
tangible results. Stability and prog- j
ress will come when the Chinese na
tion becomes conscious enough to
break away from the old habit of being
only remotely interested in political
affairs."
