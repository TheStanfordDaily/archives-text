Seven hundred and fifty MeGill
University sport fans demolished a
plate glass showcase in the MeGill
Union in their rush last Saturday to
secure copies of the MeGill Daily's first
extra edition, which gave a complete
scoop of intercollegiate games played
during the day.
The crowd gathered several hours
beore the paper was out, and when
the college sheet came out ahead of
all the city papers with football, ten
uis, and golf scores, the crowd went
right through a showcase in their en
thusiasm.
