# Local Students Work Hard Oregon Professor Praises Athletics Do Not Dominate
## 
### 
That Stanford students work much
harder than Oregon students was the
opinion expressed by Dr. Warren D.
Smith, head of the geological depart
ment in the University of Oregon, on
liis return to the Oregon University
after doing teaching and research
work at Stanford during the summer
quarter. He was also impressed by the
general high standard of scholarship,
and the fact that athletics and fra
ternities, while important, were not
allowed to dominate.
In Dr. Smith's estimation, he de
clared, the Inner Quadrangle at Stan
ford is the finest thing of its kind in
America, though hardly more beauti
ful than the rest of the buildings and
grounds on the campus.
