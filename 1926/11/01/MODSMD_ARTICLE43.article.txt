Commenting on the new rule in
force at Ohio Northern University ab
solutely banning dancing of any sort
on the campus and providing immedi
ate expulsion from the college as a
penalty for breaking it, Dean Mary
Yost says:
"I can't see why dancing under
proper conditions isn't a very sane
and wholesome method of entertain
ment. However, I do think it's too bad
that it seems to be the only form of
amusement which young people in
dulge in at the present time, as it
leaves out the percentage who can't
dance but who can do other things
well.
"What Ohio Northern University lias
done # is to merely put dancing off the
campus. It is infinitely better to allow
it at university functions because it
is much easier to regulate action on
the campus than off-campus.
Of course, there are some dances
which lend themselves to bad dancing
more than others, hut when we have
a student body whose interest is in
doing the decent thing, as at Stanford,
we can safely say that dancing is de
sirable. The only trouble we ever had
at Stanford about dancing was about
four years ago when the "Chicago"
struck "The campus like the measles. It

! was a good thing that the attack was
violent because it brought immediate
action. It was obvious that the student
body wouldn't stand for v it. After the
Sophomore Cotillion, the Men's Coun
cil and Women's Council immediately
passed resolutions against the dance,
and the Men's Honor Society and all
: other campus organizations of like
nature concurred In their opinion.
There has never been any trouble
about dancing since then, and we
don't expect any."
Miss Yost believes that Ted Shawn,
world-famous dancer, is correct in his
statement that "there is no such thing
as a bad or immoral dance â€”only bad
I or immoral dancers." In this connec
tion she says: "If chairmen of dances
and the dance committee will be care
ful to suppress individual bad dancers,
dancing is something we ought to en
courage rather than prohibit."
With reference to the same ques
tion, Dean George Culver comments
as follows:
"So far as the situation at Stanford
is concerned, I wouldn't like to see
dancing banished. I consider it a part
of the social training at the Univer
sity. Of course, it should be regulated
as it is now. I do think, however, that
one o'clock dances are a little too
long. The last hour passes too slowly."
