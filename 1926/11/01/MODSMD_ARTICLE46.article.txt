# California Equips Band With Uniforms Rather Than Washington Trip
## 
### 
Believing that having a band equip
ped with uniforms comparable to those
of Stanford and other universities was
more important than to be represented
at the Washington game, the execu
tive committee of the University of
California has revoked its decision to
send the A.S.U.C. band to the game
and granted the minstead an appro
priation of $2380 for uniforms.
The appearance of the band at the
U.S.C. game in a variety of uniforms

led the executive committee to grant
the players' desire for new uniforms
rather than to spend $2550 sending
them to Seattle since there was not
enough to do both things.
