By George W. Story
Oregon Aggies and Stanford head
the list in the Pacific Coast Conference
football race, which today swings into
the last month of the season.
Until Saturday there wore three un
beaten teams in the fight, but the
Cardinals pushed U.S.C. down among
the other "also rans" by defeating
them 13 to 12 in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. The Aggies kept their rec
ord clean by defeating Idaho 3 to 0
at Portland in a game in which the
Sandals almost blasted O.A.C.'s hopes
of the championship.
In the other conference battle Ore
gon piled up enough points in the first
half to beat California 21 to 13 in the
California Memorial Stadium.
Washington won a non-conference
game from Whitman 44 to 0 and Gon
zaga beat Montana 10 to 6 in another.
Before the Stanford game the Thun
dering Herd was a 10 to 6 favorite,
and in the early part of the second
quarter, when Howard Jones' men
amassed a 12 to 0 lead, it looked as
though a U.S.C. victory was a certain
ty. But the Redshirts had different
ideas on the subject.
Cards Behind at Half
Immediately after the second Tro
jan score the Cardinals opened an
unstoppable attack and crossed the
goal line, but at the end of the half
they were on the short end of a 12 to
G score. Hoffman to Hyland tells the
story of the other Stanford touchdown,
which came in the third period, and
then George Bogue won the game by
booting the ball for the extra point,
which proved to be the margin sepa
rating the two teams when the final
gun sounded.
As a result of the game Stanford
