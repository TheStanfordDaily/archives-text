By George W. Story
Oregon Aggies and Stanford head
the list in the Pacific Coast Conference
football race, which today swings into
the last month of the season.
Until Saturday there wore three un
beaten teams in the fight, but the
Cardinals pushed U.S.C. down among
the other "also rans" by defeating
them 13 to 12 in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. The Aggies kept their rec
ord clean by defeating Idaho 3 to 0
at Portland in a game in which the
Sandals almost blasted O.A.C.'s hopes
of the championship.
In the other conference battle Ore
gon piled up enough points in the first
half to beat California 21 to 13 in the
California Memorial Stadium.
Washington won a non-conference
game from Whitman 44 to 0 and Gon
zaga beat Montana 10 to 6 in another.
Before the Stanford game the Thun
dering Herd was a 10 to 6 favorite,
and in the early part of the second
quarter, when Howard Jones' men
amassed a 12 to 0 lead, it looked as
though a U.S.C. victory was a certain
ty. But the Redshirts had different
ideas on the subject.
Cards Behind at Half
Immediately after the second Tro
jan score the Cardinals opened an
unstoppable attack and crossed the
goal line, but at the end of the half
they were on the short end of a 12 to
G score. Hoffman to Hyland tells the
story of the other Stanford touchdown,
which came in the third period, and
then George Bogue won the game by
booting the ball for the extra point,
which proved to be the margin sepa
rating the two teams when the final
gun sounded.
As a result of the game Stanford
; has an excellent chance of copping
the championship. With only Wash
ington and California between them
and an unbroken string of conference
wins, the Reds have a much better
opportunity than have the Aggies of |
Oregon, who must meet the Trojans !
and Oregon. !
I If Saturday's score against Idaho
means anything the Aggies are going ;
to have a real tussle on their hands I
when they do battle against U.S.C. in
Portland on Armistice Day. A victory
for the Thundering Herd will leave
Stanford the only team without a de- j
feat charged against it, and the Herd ,
is very liable to get that victory.
O.A.C. ana Oregon Win
Wesley ScMilmerich saved the Ag
gies Saturday by kicking a field goal
in the closing minutes of play, after
Idaho had outfought and outgained the
Orangemen throughout the matinee.
Oregon had little trouble scoring!
against California in the first half
and was leading 21 to 0 at the end of
the second quarter, but in the-third ;
period the Bears came to life and,
without the aid of a first down, made ;
two touchdowns and converted one
try for point. One of the touchdowns I
was the result of a blocked punt and j
the other came when Evans inter- j
cepted a forward pass and ran 50 |
yards to the goal line.
