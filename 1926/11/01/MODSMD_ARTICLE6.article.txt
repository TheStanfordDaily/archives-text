# TRIASSIC COLLECTION OF GEOLOGY DIVISION LARGEST IN AMERICA
## 
### 
Housed in the Geology building at
I Stanford is the largest collection in
the United States of marine inverte
brates of the Triassic period, including
several times the number of specimens
' to be found in all other American col
lections put together, according to
James Perrin Smith, professor of pale-
I ontology.
The collection is practically com*
: plete, containing nearly all of the sev*
' eral hundred species known, and is
( taken from all over the world, though
i most of the specimens are from the
| United States and Alaska. The greater
j part of the collection is the work of
; Professor Smith, who has published
three monographs on it and is prepar
. ing a fourth.
Stanford is known the world over
for its work with the Triassic inverte
brates, which has been a specialty
here. The vertebrate forms, which are
much fewer in number than the inver
tebrates, are not represented in the
Stanford collection.
Professor C. L. Camp of the Uni
versity of California is at present
doing much work with the vertebrates,
having discovered Triassic deposits in
the Painted Desert region of Arizona
and Mexico very similar to the ones
found by Professor Smith in Shasta
county from which many of the Stan
ford specimens came.
