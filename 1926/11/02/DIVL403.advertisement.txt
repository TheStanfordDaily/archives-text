The Otis Elevator must accept a great deal of the responsibility for the crowd
ing of New York's sidewalks in the congested district. This seems fanciful but
nevertheless it is true. Newspapers and magazines continually deplore the in
creasingly over-crowded condition of these sidewalks, due to the ever-increasing I
height of buildings. If it were not for the developments in the elevator industry
made by the Otis Elevator Company as a pioneer, it would not have been pos- I
sible to erect buildings of the stupendous heights which arc now in vogue. It is I
the high speed Gcarlcss Elevator, now culminating in the 800 ft. speed auto
matic signal control elevator, which has made the fiftieth floor almost as avail
able in point of time as the twentieth floor, and that has, therefore, made it
• feasible to pile office on office high into the air. I
