Save Your Furnace
Bills This Fall
Why use furnace heat this Fall when the
marvelous new gas-heating principle,
Radiantfire, will go to work for you for a
few cents an hour? Radiantfire will warm
a room for hours at the cost of a shovel
ful of coal . . . You can't turn burning
coal off when there's a quick warm spell,
but you can turn Radiantfire off—and the
heating costs with it.
Radiantfire is efficient, modern heat. It
sends 90% of its radiant, sun-like ray 3
into the room, not up the chimney. As
cheery as a log fire—but many times
warmer. Cheaper, cleaner, better than
coal. Odorless, ashless, noiseless, instant.
Saves carrying, sweeping, bending, and
temper. Models from $15 up. Investigate
today. Let us show you the beautiful
selection of models we have.
