Missouri Former Holders
The All-American college and uni
versity cup for the past year has been
in the possession of the Savitar, Uni
versity of Missouri yearbook.
All-American honor ratings which
are given to all books which have
made the most of their opportunities
in the production of their books were
accorded to six universities. Two coast
universities, Stanford and the Univer
sity of Washington, won places in the
list of All-American leaders. They are
in order of their standing: Stanford
Quad; Javhawker, University of Kan
sas; Tyee, University of Washington;
Arbutus, University of Indiana; Go
pher, University of Minnesota; and
the Pedagog, Southwest- Texas State
Teachers College.
The Sixth National All-American
contest was judged by the most com
prehensive score ever devised for such
purposes, according to The Scholastic
Editor. Each book entered in the con
test was painstakingly reviewed and
analyzed. The purpose of the contest
is to encourage the desire in each
school to raise its individual standing
and to maintain a high standard.
