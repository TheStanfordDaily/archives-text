# FRESHMAN GRIDDERS PREPARING FOR TILT WITH U.C. YEARLINGS
## First-Year Men Beat Good Team in Trojan Babes Says Husky Hunt 
### 
With a victory over the University
of Southren California freshmen safe
ly tucked away, the Stanford freshman
football squad has set to work with a
will to prepare for the Little Big Game
that will be played next Saturday. A
win over the Bear Cubs would climax
a successful season for the yearlings
as they have Avon every game played
this year.
"I think the freshmen defeated a
good football team last week-end,"
said Coach Husky Hunt last night.
"They were more closely matched
than the score shows, for Stanford
made fourteen first downs to Southern
California's twelve. The team looked
good against the U.S.C. freshmen, but
they will need to take on a little polish
this week if we are to defeat Cali
fornia."
Minor Injuries
Although the freshmen won the
game by a large score, the members
of the squad were battered to quite
an extent. Heincke, quarter, has a bad
shoulder, which the doctors have not
been able to decide is due to a
cracked collar bone or merely a
bruise. He will not be able to play
until Saturday, at the earliest. Temple
man, center, has a stiff neck which
will probably respond to treatment.
May, Burke, and others on the squad
are also nursing minor injuries.
Although the Little Big Game is now
the object being kept in mind, the
victory over the U.S.C. freshmen is
one of which the freshmen can be
proud. The team played heads-up foot
ball all during the game. They made
their first score almost before the
Southern California freshmen knew
that they were playing in a game. And
they kept scoring, taking advantage
of breaks, making their own breaks
when necessary, and playing a kind of
football that would not be denied.
Although they made only one touch
down in the second half, part of this
was due to the fact that the U.S.C.
team had tightened up to a consider
able extent, and part was due to the
number of substitutions made by
Coach Hunt.
The U.S.C. and Stanford freshman
teams were well matched, and the
yearlings won because they followed
the ball and had the punch when
punch was needed. If they polish off a
few rough edges in this next week,
they will have more than an even
chance to defeat the California Cubs.
They will take on the required polish,
too, if they keep up the display of pep
that they put into their practice last
night under the flood lights.

ly tucked away, the Stanford freshman
football squad has set to work with a
will to prepare for the Little Big Game
that will be played next Saturday. A
win over the Bear Cubs would climax
a successful season for the yearlings
as they have Avon every game played
this year.
"I think the freshmen defeated a
good football team last week-end,"
said Coach Husky Hunt last night.
"They were more closely matched
than the score shows, for Stanford
made fourteen first downs to Southern
California's twelve. The team looked
good against the U.S.C. freshmen, but
they will need to take on a little polish
this week if we are to defeat Cali
fornia."
Minor Injuries
Although the freshmen won the
game by a large score, the members
of the squad were battered to quite
an extent. Heincke, quarter, has a bad
shoulder, which the doctors have not
been able to decide is due to a
cracked collar bone or merely a
bruise. He will not be able to play
until Saturday, at the earliest. Temple
man, center, has a stiff neck which
will probably respond to treatment.
May, Burke, and others on the squad
are also nursing minor injuries.
Although the Little Big Game is now
the object being kept in mind, the
victory over the U.S.C. freshmen is
one of which the freshmen can be
proud. The team played heads-up foot
ball all during the game. They made
their first score almost before the
Southern California freshmen knew
that they were playing in a game. And
they kept scoring, taking advantage
of breaks, making their own breaks
when necessary, and playing a kind of
football that would not be denied.
Although they made only one touch
down in the second half, part of this
was due to the fact that the U.S.C.
team had tightened up to a consider
able extent, and part was due to the
number of substitutions made by
Coach Hunt.
The U.S.C. and Stanford freshman
teams were well matched, and the
yearlings won because they followed
the ball and had the punch when
punch was needed. If they polish off a
few rough edges in this next week,
they will have more than an even
chance to defeat the California Cubs.
They will take on the required polish,
too, if they keep up the display of pep
that they put into their practice last
night under the flood lights.
