# MANY FORCES CONTRIBUTE 10 CARD VICTORY
## Warner Proves Once Again That He Is a Master At Directing SQUAD TAKES DAY'S REST Every Stanford Man Helped To Win Game Against Thundering Herd 
### George W. Story 
Glenn S. "Pop" Warner, the man
who defeated U.S.C., gave his victori
ous Cardinal varsity a rest yesterday
afternoon. Pop explained that the
players needed a let-down after the
high nervous strain they had been
under for a week before the historic
game against the Trojans, so he told
them not to report for a workout yes
terday.
Stanford's brilliant victory has been
attributed to various causes. Some say
Warner did it. Others are of the
opinion that the mental attitude and
fighting spirit of the Redshirts ac
counted for their victory, and some
of those who had hoped for a U.S.C.
victory declare that the breaks did it.
But the main thing is that it was done,
and probably an intensive study of the
subject would reveal that all three of
the forces mentioned above had a part
in the downfall of the Sons of Troy.
Credit to Warner
Certainly a great amount of the
credit must be heaped on Pop Warner,
who proved once again that he is the
master of the gridiron. The Stanford
team was directed almost perfectly
and it was Warner who did that di
recting.
And then the team must get its
share of the glory. No Stanford team
ever fought harder than that band of
Redshirts did against the Thundering
Herd Saturday, and no Stanford team
was ever more determined to win.
And no Stanford team ever did win a
more glorious victory.
In the first quarter things looked
very gloomy for Stanford. The Tro
jans made nine first downs in that
length of time and the Cardinals were
unable to make yardage on a single
occasion. But they would not be
stopped, even though they were not
gaining with the machine-like preci
sion of their enemies.
Every Man Had Share
Every Stanford man had a share in
the victory. Hyland's sensational run
ning back of kicks, which totaled 109
yards, Poulson's and Swan's brilliant
charging, McCreery's great defensive
work, Hoffman's steady line-plunging,
and, perhaps meat important of all be
cause it won the game, George Bogue's
kicking of the goal that supplied the
exlra unit necessary for victory, were
perhaps the features of the Cardinals'
win, but every man did his share, else
there would have been no victory.
The Trojans outgained the Redmen
on running plays by a margin of 187
yards to 129, but Stanford's ability
to return kicks and their forward
passes carried them through. Warner's
men returned kicks 175 yards while
the Herd was able ♦o carry ♦hem back
only Tl2 yards. Stanford gained 70
yards from passes to 50 for Uie losers.
And one thing more, the Trojans
lost 44 yards from scrimmage to only
14 for Stanford, which again brings
out the fact that the Cardinal line
was outcharging the foe.
But Pop Warner's work is not fin
ished for the season. Far from it. It
is only half finished. Pop must prepare
his team for two more conference
games, one with Washington in the
stadium on November 13, and (he
other, ♦he Big Game.
The Cardinals will go back to work
this afternoon, for they meet Santa
Clara next Saturday and the Broncos
are not to lie <aken too lightly, for
♦ hey have a real football team, as ♦he
fact that they drubbed Nevada 25 to 0
Saturday shows.
