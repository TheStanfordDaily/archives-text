# Poor Management

### 
Despite the fact that Stanford completely overwhelmed the Trojans
last week-end, there was plenty of cause for discussion over the way the
arrangements for the game were handled. From start to finish the
entire situation was a mess. No one directly was at fault—it was lack of
internal co-operation and foresight in the bodies charged with the re
sponsibility of handling the rooters and the preparations for them. The
co-operation between these bodies was likewise sadly missing.
In the hrst place, last Monday the Rally Committee burst out with
a new song which was to have been sung at Southern California con
tests exclusively. Then, by the time the rally came around on Wednesday
night this organization decided that there was not enough time to learn
the song. All of which shows an utter lack of organization and determina
tion.
With any small amount of encouragement the entire campus would
gladly have spent enough time during some meal hour to learn the words
and tune. But no—the song was given display and encouragement in
the Daily and the Rally Committee let it go at that. Then, when caught
in a hole —sought the easiest way out —postponed the whole thing.
Next, the rally—no attempt was made to give the team a big send-off
at the train because of the musical concert the night of departure.
Instead, a call was issued for rooters the evening before. No outside
speaker, none of the usual entertainment, and no football team. A few
members of the varsity did drift down to the pavilion, but no attempt
was made to get them there in an organized body. Result —little en
thusiasm.
Then, at the game—direction cards for the stunts w r ere laid out over
seats that had been sold to the general public. Consequently, all down
the left side of the section were rows of men, women, and children—
throwing the stunts off balance.
Upon previous encouragement from members of the Rally Committee,
Stanford students crowded into the rooting section irregardless of the
seat number on their tickets. Consequently, many students with rooters'
tickets were forced to sit in the aisles —while general admission tickets
grabbed the preferred scats.
The Board of Athletic Control also shares in the fault of the over
crowded section because of the fact that it moved up the date for filing
applications for rooters' tickets. The deadline date was announced as
one time on the application and a week after the forms were passed out
the date was moved ahead. Some missed the notice and likewise missed
the cliance to get rooters' tickets.
Then again, none of the tickets sent out were stamped rooters' tickets
so no one can be blamed for crowding over into the section if they had
a white shirt and a cap.
The good old varsity was kind enough to step up and save the
deplorable situation by trouncing the Trojans. Even so, the effects were
keenly felt.
A mess like this happens once by accident, but there should be no
repetition of the atrocity.

The Board of Athletic Control also shares in the fault of the over
crowded section because of the fact that it moved up the date for filing
applications for rooters' tickets. The deadline date was announced as
one time on the application and a week after the forms were passed out
the date was moved ahead. Some missed the notice and likewise missed
the cliance to get rooters' tickets.
Then again, none of the tickets sent out were stamped rooters' tickets
so no one can be blamed for crowding over into the section if they had
a white shirt and a cap.
The good old varsity was kind enough to step up and save the
deplorable situation by trouncing the Trojans. Even so, the effects were
keenly felt.
A mess like this happens once by accident, but there should be no
repetition of the atrocity.
Despite the fact that Stanford completely overwhelmed the Trojans
last week-end, there was plenty of cause for discussion over the way the
arrangements for the game were handled. From start to finish the
entire situation was a mess. No one directly was at fault—it was lack of
internal co-operation and foresight in the bodies charged with the re
sponsibility of handling the rooters and the preparations for them. The
co-operation between these bodies was likewise sadly missing.
In the hrst place, last Monday the Rally Committee burst out with
a new song which was to have been sung at Southern California con
tests exclusively. Then, by the time the rally came around on Wednesday
night this organization decided that there was not enough time to learn
the song. All of which shows an utter lack of organization and determina
tion.
With any small amount of encouragement the entire campus would
gladly have spent enough time during some meal hour to learn the words
and tune. But no—the song was given display and encouragement in
the Daily and the Rally Committee let it go at that. Then, when caught
in a hole —sought the easiest way out —postponed the whole thing.
Next, the rally—no attempt was made to give the team a big send-off
at the train because of the musical concert the night of departure.
Instead, a call was issued for rooters the evening before. No outside
speaker, none of the usual entertainment, and no football team. A few
members of the varsity did drift down to the pavilion, but no attempt
was made to get them there in an organized body. Result —little en
thusiasm.
Then, at the game—direction cards for the stunts w r ere laid out over
seats that had been sold to the general public. Consequently, all down
the left side of the section were rows of men, women, and children—
throwing the stunts off balance.
Upon previous encouragement from members of the Rally Committee,
Stanford students crowded into the rooting section irregardless of the
seat number on their tickets. Consequently, many students with rooters'
tickets were forced to sit in the aisles —while general admission tickets
grabbed the preferred scats.
