# He Said, "Darn"!

We seen where the captain of the Western Teachers' College of Illi
nois football was suspended by Coach Ray Hanson because the star
tackle indulged in a few short words of profanity. It is certainly a
rather hard situation when a great big football man can't cuss a little
when he is kicked in the nose by the opposing center.
Elliott, of University of Southern California, who was an All-
American prospect until the Stanford game last year, was asked to leave
the field when he lost his temper in practice two weeks ago. He was
put off of the squad for what was willed insubordination. Since that
time, Elliott realized his error and was taken back on the team after lie
made fitting apologies and promised not to "get mad" again.
To cite another similar case, one of the stars of this year's Idaho
team was expelled for the season a short time ago. Coach Charley Erb,
of the California "Wonder" team, told the young man to trot around the
field ten times, and when the player decided he was too tired to so exert
himself, he was told to hand in his suit â€”which he did. The suit has since
been issued to a new man, who is not much of a football player but
one who knows how to obey rules.
Coach Bagshaw of the University of Washington had the same
trouble with the outstanding player on this season's 1 lusky varsity, and
the coach did not hesitate to suspend the man.
These little instances go to demonstrate how coaches feel towards
discipline. There must be the strictest obedience of the rules if there is
to be a football team. Eleven men must work as one man, if the team
is to win gams. A football is much like a complicated piece of machinery.
If one wheel, or one cog, goes wrong, the machine stops; and if one
player enters an important grid match with the wrong mental attitude,
the team, as a whole, stops.
