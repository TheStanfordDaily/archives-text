Our ears are burning. If the gentle |
reader will glance at today's Campus
Opinion he will discover the reason. 1
We wish to thank Dean Yost; sin
cerely, for a tribute which we can
only hope is merited. She has given
us something to think about in the 1
matter of faculty attitude toward the
expression of student opinion.
Compare her letter with that written
by Bob Lewis. The latter correspond- i
ent, one will note, would have us
throttled for not thinking his way. !
Dean Yost, on the other hand, is con
tent to congratulate us on having done
some clear thinking, despite the fact j
that some of that thinking did not
coincide entirely with certain of the
policies sponsored by her office.
We hope this comparison will serve
the purpose of discouraging an opinion
current in local undergraduate circles
to the effect that the administration
acts as self-appointed censor of stu
dent thought. Such is not the case.
If it were, the administration would (
be in the same position as a pretzel j

| salesman at a convention of the Anti-
Saloon League.

We presume that it is our bounden
duty to answer the gentleman whose
self-admitted passion for writing non-
I sense is amply demonstrated by the
apt manner in which he writes it.
His whole attitude may be summed
up in the statement that he is a senti
mentalist. He follows his illusions
rather than his intellect. The facts are
that there is a decreasing interest in
rallies which is proportionate to the
decrease in the amount of entertain
ment offered at them. The fact is that
j rooters turn out to see a football game
because they enjoy it, rather than out
of a sense of duty to the University.
All this is quite as it should be. It
is simply not as this sentimentalist
would have it. He would like to be
lieve all these catch phrases about
! "giving one's all."
We'll bet he clapped out of a genu
ine belief that by so doing he would
I help Sir James Barrie's Tinkerbell to
i live.
