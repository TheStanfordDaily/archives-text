"The Bull Session"
STANFORD DAILY
Stanford University
Gentlemen:
I thought the "Bull Session" would
be interested and amused to see how
its theme of several days ago found
expression in the "Vassar Miscellany"
which 1 received yesterday. Evidently
the rebellion against mass action
which has little or no purpose is wide
spread.
Please let me take this occasion to
congratulate the "Daily" on its edi
torials and on the articles in the "Bull
Session." I think there is more clear
thinking, good writing, and willingness
to face facts honestly and frankly in
the paper this year than I have seen in
it since I have been at Stanford.
All strength to your pen!
Cordially yours,
(Signed) Mary Yost,
Dean of Women.

(From Vassar "Miscellany"
Collegiate or not collegiate, that Is
the question!
Whether 'tis wiser in the legs to
suffer
The cold and stiffness due to watching
hockey
Or in the Libe to end them? To read!
To think!
To live!!! Afar to contemplate with
scorn
Those childish, hoarse, unindividual
yells
That are collegiate! To rise above
The mob!! Perhaps be cut!!! Gosh,
there's the rub!
For even in that superior state, the
chance
Of making daisy chain or president
Can't be forgotten! These fond hopes
Still make me shake for hours, cold,
collegiat'e!!

The Editor, Sir:
Please, Mr. Editor, can't you do
something to throttle or otherwise in
capacitate the budding young genius
editing the column rather appropri
ately called The Bull Session?

This young man is making a rather
pitiful and obvious attempt to be radi
cal and oh, so different. But while he
is making this puerile effort to show
individuality, there is a danger that
some students, possibly freshmen,
might take him seriously. Within fair
ly recent history, two editors of the
Daily Palo Alto (names furnished upon
request) have done incalculable harm
by their editorial "radicalisms." There
is a certain influence even to our Stan
ford Daily, and it seems to me, there
fore, that there exists a certain con
comitant responsibility.
This avatar of sophistication in col
lege spirit calls rallies an unnecessary
nuisance. Please hold him in check
lest he suddenly becomes logical and
consistent and points out the utter
futility of our Big Game Rally. He
doesn't engage in athletics; neither
do I, but if he will interrogate any
member of the football team I imagine
he will be informed that there is a
certain satisfaction rendered to one
who is giving everything he has to
Stanford to feel that the student body
is behind him and the team and isn't
backward about saying it with yells.
"Nothing to yell about?" What sort of
man is this?
Let the team be the judge. Let the
team feel that the campus as a whole
looks upon a rally as "sheer and un
adulterated nonsense," and possibly
some little spark that drives them to a
somewhat greater effort and a will to
do will be lacking. What a shock it
would be to the members to feel that
they were upholding (he honor of an
institution inhabited by sophists such
as ye editor of ye "bull session!" And
he calls others sophomoric!
Again, Mr. Editor, if you can't put
this offender out of the way, give him
the book review department until the
football season is over. For I repeat,
some students, possibly freshmen,
might take him seriously.
