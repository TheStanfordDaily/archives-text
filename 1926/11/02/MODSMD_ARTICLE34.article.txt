# ART GALLERY SHOWS BLOCK PRINT DISPLAY BY CANADIAN ARTIST
## Work of Walter J. Phillips Shows Talent in Wood Color Printing 
### 
An exhibit of twenty-five block
prints by Walter J. Phillips was placed
on display at the Art Gallery yester
day. Mr. Phillips, a Canadian, is a
painter and wood block engraver of
exceptional talent. His prints not only
depict the Northern Canadian country
with all the individual charm and deli
cate color found in his paintings and
watercolors, but they reveal an under
standing and technical mastery of the
medium of wood block engraving
which make him an outstanding figure
among the workers in this medium.
Block for Each Tint
Artistic expression finds an easy
and spontaneous outlet in the wood
cut, whether in black-and-white, or in
color. The latter form employs several
blocks, usually one for each tint, al
though additional tints producing a
variety of atmospheric qualities may
be effected by the printing of one
color over another. The impressions
are obtained by letter press, or raised
surface printing, as opposed to the
intaglio style used for etchings or en
gravings.
Three Operations
There are three distinct operations
in the production of an original wood
block print. After the artist has con
ceived an idea, he must be capable of
drawing upon the block itself. The
second step is the cutting of the block,
or a series of blocks, if the work is to
be in color. The last steps, and by no
means the least important, is the print
ing, which becomes a fine art in itself.
Mr. Phillips excels as a color printer,
and Canada has shown its apprecia
tion of him by placing a complete set
of his proofs in the National Museum.
"Norman Bay, Number Two" is one
of his best-known prints. It was award
ed first honors at the International
Print Show, which was held in Los
Angeles, in 1924. All of the prints in
the exhibit have been most carefully
done and a superb blending of colors
has brought out a very dainty and
realistic effect.
