## 
### 
October 30th meant the date
of the U.S.C. game to most of
the campus, but to some it meant
Hallowe'en —witches, jack-o'-lan
terns, and black cats. There was
a real party that included not
only ice cream, but balloons, im
promptu costumes, and guessing
contests, with no entries barred.
The old Stanford dining room
was particularly colorful with
crayon jack-o'-lanterns that had,
besides shaded eye-sockets, noses
that would have done credit to
Leonarda Vinci himself.
