# "JOHN FERGUSON" SEAT SALE THIS AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Tickets for "John Ferguson" will be
on sale this afternoon at 1 o'clock at
a special desk in front of the Women's
Clubhouse. Contrary to announce
! ments, the booth from the Board of
I Athletic Control which was placed in
1 front of the Union yesterday will not
J be used.
In arranging for the sale of tickets
j from the outside desk, Robert Cecil,
i dramatic manager, has planned to fa
cilitate the sale and save time for the
purchasers. The idea of the booth was
| abandoned when the University au-
I thorities reached the opinion that the
| booth too much resembled a left-over
from a Hallowe'en prank, and was
1 therefore not calculated to add to the
! beauty of the campus.
Depicts Irish Life
That "John Ferguson" will go down
as a high-water mark in Stanford dra
matics, is the opinion of those who
have been following the rehearsals.
The play is a realistic presentation of
Irish life from the pen of St. John
Ervine, distinguished Ulster play

wright and novelist.
Ervine has drawn the picture of an
Irish patriarch attempting to match
his faith and gentleness toward man
kind with the most ironical circum
stances. Misfortunes crowd in on him,
striking at his family and possessions,
but he still drives bitterness away
from his mind and begs for peace and
observance of the law. This faith al
most carries him through—until he is
faced with the loss of his son.
New Actors
The cast is a mixture of the old and
the new on the Stanford stage. The
very difficult part of John Ferguson
is carried by Delmer Daves, veteran
of many Stanford productions. Helen
Cooper and Ruth Minskey appear for
the first time in parts scarcely less
difficult. Rehearsals thus far have in
dicated that they, and other members
of the cast, represent a new and prom
ising generation for the campus stage.
There will be no advance of prices
; for "John Ferguson," tickets selling
| for seventy-five cents and one dollar.
