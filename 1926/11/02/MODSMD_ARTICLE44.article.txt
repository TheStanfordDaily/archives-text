# DAILY SEEKS FUNDS FOR EXCHANGE LIST
## 
### 
! Acting upon the suggestion of The
Stanford Daily, the Ex Committee at
its meeting tonight will consider ap
propriating funds for sending copies
of the Daily to the larger high schools
of the state. While this is ordinarily
a function of the paper, the expense
incurred in the undertaking exceeds
the available funds of the Daily.
The Associated Students office in
the Old Union is closed for a few
days while undergoing a general reno
vation. The floor is receiving a new
surface, the walls are being painted a
lighter color, and new curtains are
being made.
