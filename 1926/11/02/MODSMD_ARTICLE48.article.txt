# Collegiates Admire Cather Sophistication the Vogue Favorite Fiction Is Revealed

Sophisticated novels are favorites
with students of the Oregon Agricul
tural College, according to an analysis
of the reading done by a class in the
contemporary American novel given
in the northern university.
The most popular writer was Willa
Cather, particularly noted as author
ess of "The Lost Lady," and other
novels or' a sophisticated type. Satire
was thoroughly appreciated as shown
Ity the selection of Sinclair Lewis for
second honors, although this place
was tied for by Booth Tarkington, gen
erally considered more of a sentimen
talist.
Edith Wharton, who ranks high with
literary critics, had few admirers, as
did Sherwood Anderson, a realist of
the first degree. His greatest rival,
Theodore Dreiser, received consider
able praise for "Sister Carrie," but
only one stutlent read the two volumes
of Dreiser's latest novel, "An Ameri
can Tragedy."
Although Martha Ostenso's best sel
ler, "Wild Geese," was very popular,
public opinion does not sway the col
legiate choice, for many magazine fa
vorites, such as Joseph Hergesheimer,
received scant attention.
With a field of sixty authors given
them to choose from, only four persons
read a book the professor of the course
highly recommended. The class aver
age was eighteen novels, but the win
ner of the novel-reading contest out
distanced the field with a list of twen
ty-nine books to his credit.
