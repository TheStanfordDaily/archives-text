# STANFORD GRAYS GO TO U.C. SATURDAY; TILT ENDS SCHEDULE
## Squad Has Been Kept Busy Scrimmaging Varsity, Freshman Teams 
### 
After a two weeks' rest, the Stan- s
ford Grays will get into action once
more this Saturday when they meet'
the California reserves in the Cali
fornia stadium. The game will serve
as a preliminary to the Card-Bear j
freshman tilt.
Saturday will probably mark the !
â–  close of the Grays' grid season as far j
as games are concerned. Coach Davis j
is now trying to secure an opponent 1
for his eleven to play a preliminary \
i game to the Varsity-Washington game !
here November 13, but it is doubtful j
whether one will be secured. The ;
| Grays will not disband after this !
week's game, but will continue to
'scrimmage the varsity until after the
' 3ig Game two weeks later.
Although no games have been
1 pjayed by Davis' men for the past
two Saturdays, they have not been J
idle, but have scrimmaged with the
varsity and freshman elevens regu-'
larly. The enforced layoff has enabled
all the injured men to get into shape j
once more and all the squad will be i
I ready to enter the fray against Cali-
I fornia.
If dope holds good at all, Stanford
should down the California Grays,
j Three weeks ago Davis' men downed
; the St. Marys reserves 25 to 6, while
| the same team defeated the California
| team.
