# CAMPUS POET PENS REPLY TO WORK OF RUDYARD KIPLING'S
## 
### 
Stanford University has not allowed
Rudyaid Kipling's poem, "The Vine
yard," to go unanswered. This poem,
which has caused much comment and
resentment in the United States, is a
veiled attack of bitterness against
America's late entry in the World
War, her comparatively slight losses
in men, and the position taken by this
country in regard to debt payments.
"The inept and unmelodious bit of
prevarication" as the magazine, Time,
regards it, was included in Kipling's
new book, "Debits and Credits," pub
lished simultaneously six weeks ago
in England and the United States. A
part of the poem follows:
"At the eleventh hour he came,
But his wages were the same
As ours who all day long had trod
The wine-press of the Wrath of God.
Since his back had felt no load,
Virtue still in him abode;
So he swiftly made his own
Those last spoils he had not won.
We went home, delivered thence,
Grudging him no recompense
Till he portioned praise or blame
To our works before he came.
Till he showed us for our good—
Deaf to mirth and blind to scorn—
How he might have blest withstood
Burdens that he has not born!"
From Sutcliffe Coe, a Stanford
junior, comes the" following response
to Kipling's slur upon the part played
by the United States in the war. It is
entitled "An Answer":
"From helpless millions living there —
Half cowering, half afraid,
'Twas then the Eagle—o'er thesea —
Sped fast to lend them aid.
He sent the life-blood of his sons
Across that stormy sea of tears;
He sent them food and clothes and
guns—
The products of a hundred years!
He gave them Faith to check the tide;
His sons marched forth in ranks
And battled with them side by side;
'Twas not for pay or thanks,
'Twas only for a Holy Cause —
The love of Peace on Earth—
Which is the foremost of God's laws,
(Some dare to call it mirth).
And those who may can laugh to scorn
The Eagle's flight in No Man's Land,
For some must be again reborn,
Before they'll fully understand.
Then he showed them, best he could,
How the love of man had flown
From those battlefields of blood,
Like a dove, by north winds blown.
And to help them even more,
In their pain and misery,
the Savior did of yore,
He proved the cost of victory.
