# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is Bob Zuppke, one of the
smartest of all gridiron mentors and
"Chuck" Kassel, one of the smartest
wing-men in the country today. This
pair, as coach and captain of the Illi
nois football team, were much in the
limelight this Saturday when the Illi
nois-Michigan game took place at Ann
Arbor.
Perhaps the many thousands assem
bled there for that game were treated
to one of the trickiest trick plays I
ever saw. This play, as diagramed
above, was just invented by Zuppke
when he coached at Oak Park High
School, Chicago. He used it, with
slight variations, against Chicago in
1923 and 1924, and against Penn in
1925. I saw all three exhibitions, and
marveled at the clock-work precision
with which the difficult triple-pass
was run off. It is an unusual play be
cause the forward pass precedes the
backward pass. "Chuck" Kassel, as
left end of the fighting Illinois team
that ran riot on muddy Franklin field

; a year ago, had a lot to do with the
smooth way in which this play was
J worked against Penn.
In brief, it was Illinois' ball on
i Penn's 25-yard line. The Westerners
lined up in place-kick formation, with
Britton evidently ready to boot the
ball which was to be held by the
kneeling Grange. The pigskin was
snapped to the famous iceman, who
handed it to Britton. Earl then threw
a looping pass to Kassel, who had
come around behind the line of scrim
mage, and "Chuck" tossed it out to
Grange, who had gotten up and was
dashing around towards the right side
of the field. Result —Illinois' fourth
touchdown.
Bob Zuppke, who was too small to
make the football team when he went
to Wisconsin, also developed the
screen pass in 1906 and the "huddle
system" in 1921. He is always uncon
ventional, a great kidder, a daring
| strategist, and a remarkable student
I
iof psychology. Aside from his foot
| ball, he is a first-class marine painter.

; a year ago, had a lot to do with the
smooth way in which this play was
J worked against Penn.
In brief, it was Illinois' ball on
i Penn's 25-yard line. The Westerners
lined up in place-kick formation, with
Britton evidently ready to boot the
ball which was to be held by the
kneeling Grange. The pigskin was
snapped to the famous iceman, who
handed it to Britton. Earl then threw
a looping pass to Kassel, who had
come around behind the line of scrim
mage, and "Chuck" tossed it out to
Grange, who had gotten up and was
dashing around towards the right side
of the field. Result —Illinois' fourth
touchdown.
Bob Zuppke, who was too small to
make the football team when he went
to Wisconsin, also developed the
screen pass in 1906 and the "huddle
system" in 1921. He is always uncon
ventional, a great kidder, a daring
| strategist, and a remarkable student
I
iof psychology. Aside from his foot
| ball, he is a first-class marine painter.
