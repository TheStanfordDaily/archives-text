# FINAL CHOICE MADE FOR CHORUS OF 1926 FOOTBALL GAIETIES
## Specialty Act Tryouts Start This Afternoon; Jazz Singers in Demand 
### 
Chrysella Dunker Kiler, director of
the chorus work for the Big Game
Gaieties, announces the final selec
tion of the women's chorus to include
Marjorie Robinson, Elizabeth Crebs,
Frances Sanford, Margaret Waite, Fay
Hamilton, Katherine Kamm, Alice May
Edwards, Catherine Harroun, Nancy
Farmer, and Dorothy Kimberlin.
Rehearsals for the chorus acts will
begin at once, according to Mrs. Kiler,
and the above women are requested to
meet in the Old Union at 7 o'clock
tonight. No men's chorus will be used
in this year's show.
Tryouts for Special Acts
Tryouts for special acts will begin
in the Assembly Hall at 4 o'clock this
afternoon. Gordon Hall, musical di
rector, particularly wants one- and
two-man acts of a specialty nature.
Specialty dances are also needed, and
Hall wishes everybody with talent
along such lines to appear today. A
second Marian Harris could fit in well
with the scheme of the show, and
feminine jazz singers are asked to
report.
Kathleen Fitz, Carol Lasater, Rose
Taft, Julia North, and Olga Spiritio
will report to Gordon Hall at today's
rehearsals.
All the music and all of the full acts
are in the hands of the general com
mittee at this time.
