# ABILITY TO TEACH HELD DEPENDENT ON INHERENT QUALITIES
## 
### 
That the ability of a woman to teach
: depends on certain inherent qualities
] and is not influenced by the fact that
she may or may not be married was
the opinion expressed by the majority
jof speakers who discussed the ques
' tion, "Should Married Women Be Em
ployed in the Schools?"'at a meeting
of the Education Club in the Women's
| Clubhouse last night.
Statistics quoted by speakers for
the affirmative side of the question
showed that sixty per cent of school
superintendents questioned on the sub
ject reported that married women
were as efficient as unmarried teach
■ ers and forty per cent found them
more efficient. On the other hand
eighty per cent of the employers show
i preference for unmarried teachers.
This fact could only be accounted for
| by the speaker on the grounds of a
! superstition lacking any reasonable
basis.
Lack of incentive and enthusiasm in
married teachers were points stressed
on the negative side of the question.
Disadvantages from the economic
viewpoint were also brought out, due
to the fact that married women will
often accept a low salary, thus cut
ting out the opportunity for those who
must make a living wage.
The next meeting of the Education
Club will be held on November 1. A
joint meeting of Pi Lambda Theta,
I'hi Delta Kappa, and tin* Education
Club is scheduled for December 3.
