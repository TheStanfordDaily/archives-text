# VARSITY RESTS BEFORE WHIG AT NEXT GAME
## Second-String Men Get in Trim for Clash Saturday BRONCOS LACE NEVADA Cardinal Squad Seen to Be In Excellent Physical Shape for Play 
### 
Still another day's layoff from prac
tice was given the sixteen men who
battled the Thundering Herd last Sat
urday. It was the second and third
squads that yesterday afternoon were
getting in shape for the game against
the Santa Clara eleven slated for next
Saturday in the stadium. Today, how
ever, will see the entire Redshirt
squad forgetting the glory of last week
and looking forward to putting the
Broncos out of the way.
For Santa Clara will not be an easy
matter. Stanford defeated Nevada 33
to 9, and four days ago the same
Nevada team went down before the
Broncos 25 to 0. The mountaineers
scored twice against Stanford, but
failed in the Santa Clara game be
cause of the stout defense displayed
by the Broncs. Thus the Cards should
get plenty of opportunity to play a
stiff game with little loafing.
Practice last evening was held on
the informal plan, with Dick Hyland
and Biff Hoffman watching the reserve
strength from the sidelines. Passing,
punting, and running with the ball
from safety position occupied the time
until Pop Warner showed up. The fine
physical condition of the men was
especially noticed in the easy charac
ter of the play and the general smooth
ness of activity.
Teams for signal practice were
chosen by Thornhill and took close
watching by Warner, Avho later put
each squad through a fast period with
the scrimmage machine.
Lewis was quarter in the backfield
that had Murphy and Wilton at halves
and Patchett at full. This combina
tion worked well together to execute
a fast march up and down the field
behind the second-string line. At the
same time the third squad was run
ning a fast workout with the machine.
The coaches and the squad are. not
taking next Saturday's game lightly.
The circumstances that combined to
win from the Trojans took since the
first of the season to build up, and
now that the great obstacle has been
safely passed, the inevitable reaction
would be for the team to fall from
the heights. But Washington and Cali
fornia are looming up larger and
larger as the days roll by, with the
Broncos as the lone "practice game,"
though it does not seem as such at all.
Warner is losing no time to keep
the strength of his men intact.

Saturday in the stadium. Today, how
ever, will see the entire Redshirt
squad forgetting the glory of last week
and looking forward to putting the
Broncos out of the way.
For Santa Clara will not be an easy
matter. Stanford defeated Nevada 33
to 9, and four days ago the same
Nevada team went down before the
Broncos 25 to 0. The mountaineers
scored twice against Stanford, but
failed in the Santa Clara game be
cause of the stout defense displayed
by the Broncs. Thus the Cards should
get plenty of opportunity to play a
stiff game with little loafing.
Practice last evening was held on
the informal plan, with Dick Hyland
and Biff Hoffman watching the reserve
strength from the sidelines. Passing,
punting, and running with the ball
from safety position occupied the time
until Pop Warner showed up. The fine
physical condition of the men was
especially noticed in the easy charac
ter of the play and the general smooth
ness of activity.
Teams for signal practice were
chosen by Thornhill and took close
watching by Warner, Avho later put
each squad through a fast period with
the scrimmage machine.
Lewis was quarter in the backfield
that had Murphy and Wilton at halves
and Patchett at full. This combina
tion worked well together to execute
a fast march up and down the field
behind the second-string line. At the
same time the third squad was run
ning a fast workout with the machine.
The coaches and the squad are. not
taking next Saturday's game lightly.
The circumstances that combined to
win from the Trojans took since the
first of the season to build up, and
now that the great obstacle has been
safely passed, the inevitable reaction
would be for the team to fall from
the heights. But Washington and Cali
fornia are looming up larger and
larger as the days roll by, with the
Broncos as the lone "practice game,"
though it does not seem as such at all.
Warner is losing no time to keep
the strength of his men intact.
