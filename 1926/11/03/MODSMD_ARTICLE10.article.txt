# FRESHMAN CLASS BEGINS WORK ON BONEIRE
## Careful Guarding Promised To Prevent Recurrence Of 1925 Episode MILLIGAN NAMED HEAD Usual Efforts to Make Pyre "Largest Ever" Planned By Class of '30 
### 
Actual construction of the Big Game
bonfire will start this afternoon, ac
cording to an announcement of Ken
neth Milligan, chairman of the bonfire
committee, who was elected last night
by the members of the freshman class.
Every possible effort will be put for
ward by members of the class to make
| this bonfire the largest ever. Above all
they plan to faithfully guard their
structure during the last week from
any firebugs, so there will not be a
chance to burn the pyre as was done
last year two days before the rally.
Wood Desired
All means possible will be used by
the freshmen to obtain wood for their
pyre. The people of Palo AJto, who
wish to help out with the construction,
have been requested to place their
wood in backyards so that it may be
hauled to the scene of the fire.
Within the next few days the cam
pus will be scoured for spare wood by
the freshman patrols. Any fraternity
or sorority houses having wood are
asked to leave it in accessible places.
The fire will be built this year at the
same place as the other freshman bon
fires, near the powerhouse. Guard duty
will start as soon as the structure
reaches a large size.

Don D. Flickinger, chairman of last
year's committee, told the class mem
bers last night at their meeting how
the actual construction is done and
how the work is apportioned. Every
member of the class is expected to put
in fifteen hours of work and punish
ment is threatened by the class for
any failures to fulfill this duty. Robert
Syer, sophomore president, gave a
short talk and stressed the fact that
the building of the bonfire, whether it
is a success or not, is how the rest
of the students judge the freshman
class.
Several piles of lumber have already
been found and Chairman Milligan
urges that all freshmen who have no
classes this afternoon turn out so that
a good start can be made. Last year's
construction started almost a week
previous to this one.
