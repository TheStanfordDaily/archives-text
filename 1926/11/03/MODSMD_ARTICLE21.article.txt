# RELIGION ONLY HOPE OF INDIAN SAYS SPEAKER
## Indians Look Upon Ritual Dances as Sacred in Their Beliefs TELLS OF MESA LANDS Christianity Prescription Is Claimed to Be Never Quite Successful 
### 
That the heart of the Indian prob
lem lies within the field of religion is
the opinion of Mrs. May K. Sedgwick,
who gave an illustrated lecture on
"To Mesa Land and Some Indian
Pueblos" in the Little Theatre last
night.
1 he Indian ritual dances to which
every year more Americans are flock
ing in the same spirit in which they
go to a circus, are to the Indian as
serious and as holy as is any church
sacrament to us, according to Mrs.
Sedgwick.
Dances Religious
"To him they have never been
dances as we interpret the word, and
the inevitable effect upon the younger
Indians trained in reservation schools
is to coarsen them and to cultivate
an irreverence for all ancestral tradi
tion, making them unfilial to their
elders. To the American Indian, danc
ing has always been a form of praying
to 'those above' that they will send
the rain which brings fertility to
grain, to beasts, and even to the
human being whose blood is called
'the water of life.'
"There can bo no question but the
Indian gets pleasure and amusement
trom the periodic ceremonials, but it
has to be insisted upon that lie never
does anything primarily for fun. Every
act of the day throughout his life has
its esoteric significance, its underlying
current of religious emotion, bred from
fear of this difficult and treacherous
universe.
Christianity No Aid
"The Christian prescription has
never seemed to the Indian better
than his ancestral one, whether in
gain to crops, or in a more healthful
growth of cattle, or of human beings.
It is, therefore, but a thin veneer of
Christianity that is superimposed
upon the old faith, and I, for one, am
not at all sure but what we would have
J been a less adroit dissembler, and n
happier creature, had we left him tc
his ancient tradition," said Mrs. Sedg
wick.
In speaking of the Pueblo Indians as
contrasted with the type of Indian
who roamed at large, Mrs. Sedgwick
pointed out that early Spaniards who
invaded the Indian territory found
these Pueblos maintaining well organ
ized republics of few or many clans
as the case happened to be, each in
variably independent of every other.
Women Work
Describing life and customs of
Acoma, which is an example of the
Pueblo situated on plateaus, Mrs.
Sedgwick remarked, "There is no such
thing as communal existence here.
Each household is a separate entity,
in truth we are told that the indiffer
ence of these people to all but their
kindred of clans is extraordinary. To
the woman belongs the house and all
that therein is; her husband has no
rights to anything but iiis blanket, his
weapons, or farm implements. The
women build the houses, all save the
heavy limber work, and constantly
have to repair the adobe walls," said
Mrs. Hedgwick.
The three types of habitations of
iie PTtf'blos, including those dwellings
on cliffs, those on river banks, and
those homes on plateaus, were de
scribed by Mrs. Sedgwick and illus
ralrd by slides.

act of the day throughout his life has
its esoteric significance, its underlying
current of religious emotion, bred from
fear of this difficult and treacherous
universe.
Christianity No Aid
"The Christian prescription has
never seemed to the Indian better
than his ancestral one, whether in
gain to crops, or in a more healthful
growth of cattle, or of human beings.
It is, therefore, but a thin veneer of
Christianity that is superimposed
upon the old faith, and I, for one, am
not at all sure but what we would have
J been a less adroit dissembler, and n
happier creature, had we left him tc
his ancient tradition," said Mrs. Sedg
wick.
In speaking of the Pueblo Indians as
contrasted with the type of Indian
who roamed at large, Mrs. Sedgwick
pointed out that early Spaniards who
invaded the Indian territory found
these Pueblos maintaining well organ
ized republics of few or many clans
as the case happened to be, each in
variably independent of every other.
Women Work
Describing life and customs of
Acoma, which is an example of the
Pueblo situated on plateaus, Mrs.
Sedgwick remarked, "There is no such
thing as communal existence here.
Each household is a separate entity,
in truth we are told that the indiffer
ence of these people to all but their
kindred of clans is extraordinary. To
the woman belongs the house and all
that therein is; her husband has no
rights to anything but iiis blanket, his
weapons, or farm implements. The
women build the houses, all save the
heavy limber work, and constantly
have to repair the adobe walls," said
Mrs. Hedgwick.
The three types of habitations of
iie PTtf'blos, including those dwellings
on cliffs, those on river banks, and
those homes on plateaus, were de
scribed by Mrs. Sedgwick and illus
ralrd by slides.
That the heart of the Indian prob
lem lies within the field of religion is
the opinion of Mrs. May K. Sedgwick,
who gave an illustrated lecture on
"To Mesa Land and Some Indian
Pueblos" in the Little Theatre last
night.
1 he Indian ritual dances to which
every year more Americans are flock
ing in the same spirit in which they
go to a circus, are to the Indian as
serious and as holy as is any church
sacrament to us, according to Mrs.
Sedgwick.
Dances Religious
"To him they have never been
dances as we interpret the word, and
the inevitable effect upon the younger
Indians trained in reservation schools
is to coarsen them and to cultivate
an irreverence for all ancestral tradi
tion, making them unfilial to their
elders. To the American Indian, danc
ing has always been a form of praying
to 'those above' that they will send
the rain which brings fertility to
grain, to beasts, and even to the
human being whose blood is called
'the water of life.'
"There can bo no question but the
Indian gets pleasure and amusement
trom the periodic ceremonials, but it
has to be insisted upon that lie never
does anything primarily for fun. Every
act of the day throughout his life has
its esoteric significance, its underlying
current of religious emotion, bred from
fear of this difficult and treacherous
universe.
