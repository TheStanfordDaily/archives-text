# RELIGION ONLY HOPE OF INDIAN SAYS SPEAKER
## Indians Look Upon Ritual Dances as Sacred in Their Beliefs TELLS OF MESA LANDS Christianity Prescription Is Claimed to Be Never Quite Successful

That the heart of the Indian prob

the opinion of Mrs. May K. Sedgwick,
who gave an illustrated lecture on
"To Mesa Land and Some Indian
Pueblos" in the Little Theatre last

Dances Religious
"To him they have never been

the rain which brings fertility to
grain, to beasts, and even to the
human being whose blood is called
'the water of life.'

has to be insisted upon that lie never
does anything primarily for fun. Every
act of the day throughout his life has
its esoteric significance, its underlying
current of religious emotion, bred from
fear of this difficult and treacherous
universe.
Christianity No Aid

never seemed to the Indian better
than his ancestral one, whether in
gain to crops, or in a more healthful
growth of cattle, or of human beings.
It is, therefore, but a thin veneer of
Christianity that is superimposed
