# Chaparral Subscribers Get Copies in Morning Mail
## 
### 
Chaparral has shown a change in
its circulation policy as evidenced by
the rapidity with which copies of the
last edition reached subscribers. The
morning mail, both in Palo Alto and
on the campus, brought the magazine
to its subscribers, thus getting it to
them as soon as it could be purchased
on the Quad, instead of the subscribers
getting their copies in the afternoon.
Seven numbers will be published
yet during the year. Readers of the
magazine should insure themselves of
getting these seven copies by sub
scribing immediately. There are only
a limited number sold on the Quad.
Besides the assurance of getting a
copy each time, the subscription price
is less expensive than that charged
for individual copies. The seven re
maining numbers may be subscribed
for by mailing a check for $1.70 to the
Chaparral, Box 15, Campus.
