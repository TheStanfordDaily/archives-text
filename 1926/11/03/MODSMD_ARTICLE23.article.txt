## 
### 
Beginning what is hoped to be an
other successful year, the Radio Club
has already met several times and has
made plans for the future operation of
its amateur sending station. The trans
mitting set, using a twenty-five watt
tube and operating on forty meters,
has been heard as far south as Chile,
and has worked many other countries.
Harley lams, now president of the
organization, Gordon Kimball, vice
president. and Marshall Nunlist, sec
retary-treasurer, are asking that all
men who are interested in amateur
radio-transmitting attend the next
meeting of the club. These meetings
ire held regularly every Wednesday
night at 8 o'clock in the radio house
in the corporation yard.
