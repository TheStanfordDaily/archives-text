Now that the Board of Athletic Control has abandoned the idea of
holding a general sale of rooters' tickets, students must rely upon getting
their pasteboards by mail application. For the last game some of the
ticket envelopes were returned without a rooter's ticket enclosed. This is
explained by the fact that these particular applications were sent to the
Board of Athletic Control after the closing date.
November 6 has been set as the deadline date for filing Washington
Game applications. In other words, if the students desire rooters' tickets
they should draw a big red circle around this date on their calendar, and
get their applications in by then.
If there is as big a demand for tickets for the Washington game as the
present conditions seem to indicate—it will be necessary to know well in
advance the exact space required by the rooting section. The application
date must be adhered to rigidly, for after this section is plotted the remain
ing seats in this part of the stadium must be given to other divisional
groups.
If by chance a rooter has a reserved seat NOT in the rooting section
and at the time of the game tries to crowd into that area he will be forcing
out someone who has taken the trouble and forethought to purchase the
regular section ticket. This will cause a re-occurrance of the situation
that existed at the U.S.C. game last Saturday. Many people with rooters'
tickets were forced to sit in the aisles.
In the case of a continuation of this condition the Board of Athletic
Control threatens to force every rooter to occupy the seat designated on
his ticket. In other words the entire rooting section would be reserved.
This system would have so many disadvantages that it would be hard to
work out satisfactorily, but if it was put through there would be a great
unnecessary furore.
Avoid a last-minute jam—get your application in early. Let peace
and contentment reign.
