# Fire Up
## 
### 
The freshmen will start rounding up all spare firewood today in
preparation of tlie largest bonfire that has ever lit up the Stanford campus.
All available and out-of-date fences in the vicinity, all drygoods boxes,
all signs that the freshmen haven't already put up in their Encina rooms,
or, in short, everything that will burn, will be scraped together and heaped
into a great pile opposite the gymnasium. The Golden Bear is in for a
real roasting this year, on the Wednesday preceding the Big Game, as
well as on Saturday, November 20, if the freshmen's plans are carried out.
The present plans call for but one bonfire this year, as it was declared
to be too strenuous to build two piles in the same week as we did last
season. For that matter the freshmen are to start guarding the pile as soon
as it takes on the form of a bonfire. The guards will be instructed to use
force on early morning intruders, even if they do wear red caps. This J
year's rules call for no fake bombs to be found in the timber the night j
before the match is to be set to the pile. Just a nice, warm, cheery bonfire j
is all we are asking for this season.
The yearlings will receive help in planning their blaze from last year's
freshman fire chairman, and also from several upperclassmen. Each fresh
man class plans to build a fire that is a little bigger than the pile that was
raised the previous year, and while this spirit of competition is admirable
in itself, there must be a limit set somewhere. Too much valuable time can j
not be wasted on collecting wood when midterms are hovering,over the!
University like a storm cloud. The freshmen's advisors will see that the fire
is not too big this year.
Anyway, freshmen, get to work and your reward will be in the form
of a great red blaze. In case any of the first-year men have any dinks
hanging in their closets the Scalpers Society may allow them to toss their
traditional headgears on the fire that eventful night.
