A REGULAR FELLOW—
From"The Mauve Decade" an un
usually good book by one Thomas
Beer which has recently made its ap
pearance upon the shelves of the Stan
ford Library, the following lined are
taken. They are set down here for the
reason that they give a good idea of
one side at least of the character of
Senator Stanford, and of the charac
ter of the young men who now enjoy
his bounty:
"He tossed gold coins to newsboys
on the streets of Washington; his din
ners were royal; his stable thrilled
sportsmen; he had given to the state
a complete university in memory of
his only child, and after that criti
cism swooned to a mere mutter.
"But no kindness awoke in the being
of Mrs. Ida Channing Walker. With
every flag in San Francisco flying at
half mast for Stanford, this militant
lady wrote a desecration of the Sena
tor, not the financier but the 'wine
bibber, atheist, and horse-racer.' When
the Chronicle wailed to print the arti
cle, she was disuaded, not without
difficulty, from attending the funeral
and calling vocal attention to Stan
ford's defects.*
"She took the train for Chicago, and
Stanford was buried in peace ....
"He lies with his wife and son in a
temple of slick gray stone under the

patronage of a superb oak tree. The
tomb is guarded before by two male
sphinxes of Semitic aspect and at the
rear by two female sphinxes wearing
Florentine necklaces. The right-hand
sphinx is obviously insane and her
i eyes glare furiously at a barrier of
1 foliage as if it hid some enemy. Be
| yond this silent corner of the park,
lads with hair bleached by perpetual
; sunshine swirl in fast motors and
| flaunt jerseys of cardinal red, as
; though death and judgment did not
matter much."
* * *
We have taken the trouble to in
vestigate thkt matter of the mad
sphinx, and have found the informa
tion to be accurate. Because of this
veracity in detail, we choose to believe
that Thomas Beer has probably given
an accurate description of Senator
Stanford's character and the manner
in which that character stood out in
I bold relief against the sloppy, superfi-
I cial morality of such fatuous females
| as Mrs. Walker.
In short, we believe that Senator
Stanford, whom we are apt to forget
here at Stanford in his University de
; serves a place in the minds and hearts
j of all Stanford men, because he had
j so much in common with us lads to
whom death and judgment do not
| matter much.

half mast for Stanford, this militant
lady wrote a desecration of the Sena
tor, not the financier but the 'wine
bibber, atheist, and horse-racer.' When
the Chronicle wailed to print the arti
cle, she was disuaded, not without
difficulty, from attending the funeral
and calling vocal attention to Stan
ford's defects.*
"She took the train for Chicago, and
Stanford was buried in peace ....
"He lies with his wife and son in a
temple of slick gray stone under the

patronage of a superb oak tree. The
tomb is guarded before by two male
sphinxes of Semitic aspect and at the
rear by two female sphinxes wearing
Florentine necklaces. The right-hand
sphinx is obviously insane and her
i eyes glare furiously at a barrier of

lads with hair bleached by perpetual
; sunshine swirl in fast motors and

; though death and judgment did not
matter much."

We have taken the trouble to in
vestigate thkt matter of the mad
sphinx, and have found the informa
tion to be accurate. Because of this
veracity in detail, we choose to believe
that Thomas Beer has probably given
an accurate description of Senator
Stanford's character and the manner
in which that character stood out in
I bold relief against the sloppy, superfi-
I cial morality of such fatuous females
| as Mrs. Walker.
In short, we believe that Senator
Stanford, whom we are apt to forget
here at Stanford in his University de
; serves a place in the minds and hearts
j of all Stanford men, because he had
j so much in common with us lads to
whom death and judgment do not
| matter much.
A REGULAR FELLOW—
From"The Mauve Decade" an un
usually good book by one Thomas
Beer which has recently made its ap
pearance upon the shelves of the Stan
ford Library, the following lined are
taken. They are set down here for the
reason that they give a good idea of
one side at least of the character of
Senator Stanford, and of the charac
ter of the young men who now enjoy
his bounty:
"He tossed gold coins to newsboys
on the streets of Washington; his din
ners were royal; his stable thrilled
sportsmen; he had given to the state
a complete university in memory of
his only child, and after that criti
cism swooned to a mere mutter.
"But no kindness awoke in the being
of Mrs. Ida Channing Walker. With
every flag in San Francisco flying at
half mast for Stanford, this militant
lady wrote a desecration of the Sena
tor, not the financier but the 'wine
bibber, atheist, and horse-racer.' When
the Chronicle wailed to print the arti
cle, she was disuaded, not without
difficulty, from attending the funeral
