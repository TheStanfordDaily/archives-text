### 
A collection of water color paintings,
by famous English artists, has been
put on exhibition at the Art Gallery.
It is generally conceded that England
has some of the best water color art
ists in the world, and this fact is well
demonstrated in the pictures compris
ing the display. The technique of
every painting is exceptionally well
handled, although the subject matters
are not always extremely appealing.
The scenes include a variety of set
tings typical of European countries,
ranging from storm-tossed seas to
rural views depicting the lives of the
peasants. An Egyptian desert scene is i
especially picturesque, and in this the j
artist has achieved a very beautiful
effect by means of his sky colorings.
"Venice," by W. Sands, is an un
usually interesting picture, with the
water reflections of the gondolas well
portrayed. Among the fishing scenes
deserving of praise is "Tucking the
Seine," by the same artist.
The collection has been loaned to
the Ait Gallery by Edward J. Walker,
and will remain on display for two
weeks.
