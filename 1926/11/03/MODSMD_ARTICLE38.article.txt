"Life at Stanford was much freer
in the early days of the University
! than it is now," declared Professor
Edward M. Hulme to members of His
tory 10 class when he recently related
;i series of reminiscences of early days.
"When I came here," he said, "the
only buildings which were standing
were the Inner Quad, the power-house,
the clock tower, and some of the en
gineering buildings. Vast fields of
wheat covered the site of Toyon and
Branner halls.
Everyone Acquainted
"The University was so small that
all the students and professors were
acquainted with one another and met
every day in the Quad. A class of
thirty-five or forty was considered re
markably large.
"Stanford was considered a literary
center, and much of the poetry from
the Sequoia, a campus literary publica
tion, was reprinted in the magazines
I of the day," declared Hulme. "William

| and Wallace Irwin were two noted
! men who contributed to the Sequoia."
Archeology Mentioned
' Brainard D. Spooner was another of
the early students mentioned by Pro
fessor Hulme, who said of him: "He
1 was a handsome, studious youth who
majored in Greek but afterwards be
came an authority in archeology and
Sanskrit. In India he discovered the
bones of Buddha which the natives
themselves had been unable to find.
Spooner is now professor of Sanskrit
at the University of Delhi, India."
Two other brothers that Hulme told
,of were the "health and religion"
j brothers who were the constant butt of
practical jokes because of their in
veterate hymn-playing on an old hand
organ which they possessed.
In speaking of transportation on the
I campus, Hulme said that only one stu
dent had a horse and buggy, and that
bicycles were the principal means of
conveyance between Palo Alto and the
I campus.
