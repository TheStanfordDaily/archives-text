# EX COMMITTEE GIVES FUNDS TO PUT DAILY ON EXCHANGE LISTS
## Fifty High Schools of State Will Receive Copies of Stanford Paper 
### 
Approximately fifty of the larger
California High Schools will receive
copies of the Stanford Daily through
out the remainder of the school year
as a result of the action taken by the
Ex Committee last night in appro
priating $150 for financing the move.
The committee deemed the expendi
ture worthy on the basis of good pub
licity for the Associated Students and
the University.
The minutes of the meeting are as
follows:
M.S.C. That $150 be appropriated to
The Stanford Daily to finance the
sending of fifty papers per day to a
selected group of California high
schools during the year 1926-1927.
M.S.C. That the closed date granted
the Dramatic Council for January 22
be changed to February 18, and that
the Glee Club be granted a date, not
closed, for January 22.
M.S.C. That the California Scholastic
Journalists' Convention be granted a
date for an informal dance to be held
in the Stanford Union November G,
with the understanding that no Uni
versity students except those directly
concerned with the entertainment of
the delegates be allowd to attend the
dance.
