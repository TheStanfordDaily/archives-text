### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Of all the field goal records avail-!
able, the most interesting and the
I
most remarkable to me is "Frosty I
Peters' feat of kicking seventeen drop
lucks between the goal posts in one
game. The word "feat" is not used in j
a spirit of levity, although "Frosty's"
feet were certainly well educated on
that particular • day, even though it
was only in a contest with a high
school team. Peters is starring for
dear old Illinois now, and some of the
"experts" have gone so far as to label
him "A Second Red Grange." Poor
"Frosty"!
E. C. Robertson, the Purdue player !
who kicked seven goals from place- |
ment in an intercollegiate game, boot
ed them all over from distances of
between 25 and 35 yards. That must j
have been the year that the expres
sion "And Stagg fears Purdue" started.
Three players have made five field
goals in an intercollegiate game. They
are, B. W. Trafford of Harvard

(against Cornell in 1890), Walter Eck
ersall of Chicago (once against Illi
nois, in 1905, and once against Ne
braska, in 1906), and Charley Brickley
of Harvard (against Yale in 1913).
Brickley, it is said, used to impress
his uncanny goal-kicking ability upon
his opponents before the game began,
by taking up a position on the 30-yard
line at one side of the field, and kick
ing drop-kicks through the goal posts
all along that line until he reached the
other side of the gridiron. All angles
looked alike to Brickley.
The Interscholastic record for num
ber of field goals in a single game is
fifteen, all place-kicks, made by Alfred
Griggs, of Exeter (Cal.) High School,
against Hanford High School, Novem
ber G, 1915.
"Red" Weaver of Centre College,
kicked 30' successive goals after touch
down, and the famous "Paddy" Driscoll
once booted a drop-kick over from 55
yards away while out of his head!
