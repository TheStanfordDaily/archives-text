# STANFORD BABES POINT TO COMING CLASH WITH BEARS
## GRID LAURELS AT STAKE Coach Hunt Predicts Real Struggle in Closing Football Game 
### 
Next Saturday afternoon is the Lit
tle Big Game and the Stanford fresh
man football team is getting ready for
I the battle that will take place when
the Cardinal yearlings meet the Uni
versity of California Cub squad. The
game will decide the championship
among the freshman teams of Stan
ford, U.S.C., and U.C.
If the Redshirts win, they will gain
the.series, while a defeat by California
would make a triple tie. U.S.C. beat
| California, Stanford beat U.S.C., and
i now comes the final clash, which will
decide not only the championship be
tween the three colleges, but will also
settle the feeling between California
and Stanford frshmen.
Struggle Looms
That the game Saturday will be a
real struggle, at least in the estima
| tion of Coach Husky Hunt, is proven
j by the amount of practice that has
been handed out to the squad the last
two days. Monday the boys ran signals
until the floodlights had to be used.
Last night the varsity signal practice
machine was used for a short time,
after which plays were run through on
the freshman field. A chalk talk kept
the men busy during the early part of
the evening.
The California freshmen will prob
ably prove to be a much harder team
|to defeat than the U.S.C. freshmen
: were, although the Stanford freshmen
deserve much credit for their decisive
victory. California men were affected
by the Southern California heat when
they played down South. Since that
; time they have kept on improving, and
will go into the game Saturday with
everything to win and nothing to lose.
The only game the Bruin Cubs have
lost is the one with U.S.C. In Captain
Eisan, Rice, and Lom, Coach Clint
Evans has a set of backs that will
bother the Stanford line considerably.
Forster Better
A1 Forster is off of crutches now and
may get in the affair Saturday. This
will permit Hobdy to play at full,
where his kicking and passing will
show to good advantage. Captain-elect
! Simkins, however, played an excellent
game last Saturday, and will undoubt
i edly see plenty of action against the
j Bear Cubs. The other men who have
i been slightly incapacitated are coming
j along rapidly. Heineke was out in a
j uniform running signals, and his
! shoulder does not bother him any
more.
