# "JOHN FERGUSON" DRAMA OF PEASANT LIFE IN IRELAND
## Dr. Jordan Favors Play as Different from Usual Type of Show 
### 
"John Ferguson," to be given in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow night, pre
sents a drama of people whose lives
are entirely different from our own.
Dr. Jordan, in commenting on the
production, said: "'John Ferguson' is
very good because it deals with life as
we do not live it. We do not have to
go very far from our doors to find the
'shirt-front' type of show, but the other
kind is hard to find."
The scene of this play, in which
chance, irony, and character portrayal
are skilfully mixed with realism, is
placed in North Ireland among the
Protestant peasantry. There, far re
moved from the so-called complexities
of modern life and in simplicity and
dignity, a small family is found faced
with intensely human problems.
St. John Ervine, the author, in at
tempting to produce "John Ferguson,"
is said to have sought to disprove the
popular notion that a serious play
could not meet with success in compe
tition with the lighter productions
current on the American and English
stages. The reception accorded the
work in this country and abroad has
fully substantiated the author's theory.
The play had a long run at the Theater
Guild in New York, and has been
given elsewhere in the country.
"St. John Ervine's 'John Ferguson',"
comments The Nation, "rediscovers
the glorious fact that human nature
and human problems are sufficiently
serious and dignified to justify serious
and dignified treatment."
