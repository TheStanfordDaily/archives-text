# GRAYS TO MEET BEAR GOOFS IN PRELIMINARY TO FRESHMAN GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's Gray gridders will travel
to Berkeley Saturday to meet the Cali
fornia reserves in a preliminary to
the California-Stanford freshman en
counter, which will start at 12:30
o'clock.
Practically every man on the Grays
squad is in good shape, and Coach Hal
Davis will he able to put his strongest
lineup on the field. Bob Miller, tackle,
injured a blood vessel in his leg while
scrimmaging with the varsity Tuesday
night, but will probably be able to
play Saturday. Reynolds and Rehrig
are now back in the lineup once more.
Saturday's game will probably be a
low-score affair as neither the Cali
fornia nor Stanford elevens have
shown much scoring power this sea
son. Davis' men downed the St. Marys
reserves 25 to 6 three weeks ago, but
all the tallies came in the last half
after the small St. Marys squad was
pretty well tired. California was de
feated by the same team, so dope
points toward a Card victory.
Tlie California game will mark the
official close of the Grays' season, but
the team will not disband. Efforts are
now being made to secure an opponent
to meet the team in a preliminary to
the Varsity-Washington game. Wheth
er one is secured or not, the Grays
will continue to scrimmage with the
varsity until after the Big Game.
