# SATURDAY'S GAMES LEAVE CONFERENCE RATING UNCHANGED
## U.C.-Washington, Idaho-W.S.C. Only Conference Games on Schedule 
### George W. Story 
Neither Stanford nor the Oregon
Aggies, the only two undefeated teams
in the Pacific Coast Conference foot
ball race, has a conference game
scheduled for Saturday afternoon.
Stanford plays Santa Clara in the
stadium and the Aggies are idle, rest

Portland on Armistice Day.
Two conference games will be
played Saturday, California meeting
Washington at Seattle in one, and
Washington State clashing with Idaho
at Moscow in the other. The remaining
teams do not play games that will
have any bearing on their conference
standing.
The (iilifornia-Washington contest
looks like a victory for the Huskies,
and if it is, it will mark the Boars'
fifth setback in as many weeks, and
their fourth straight conference de
feat. California seems doomed to rest
at the bottom of the list this season,
without a victory over any conference
team to its credit.
Washington, on the other hand, is
not out of the running as yet. If the
Thundering Herd beats the Aggies
and Washington is able to win from
Stanford on November 13, the Hus
kies will be as high as any of the rest
of them. It is with this in view that
the Northerners take the field against
the Bruins Saturday, and, judging from

they mean business from now until the
season ends.
