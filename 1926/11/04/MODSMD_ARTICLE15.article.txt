# SATURDAY'S GAMES LEAVE CONFERENCE RATING UNCHANGED
## U.C.-Washington, Idaho-W.S.C. Only Conference Games on Schedule 
### George W. Story 
Neither Stanford nor the Oregon
Aggies, the only two undefeated teams
in the Pacific Coast Conference foot
ball race, has a conference game
scheduled for Saturday afternoon.
Stanford plays Santa Clara in the
stadium and the Aggies are idle, rest
ing for their game with U.S.C. in
Portland on Armistice Day.
Two conference games will be
played Saturday, California meeting
Washington at Seattle in one, and
Washington State clashing with Idaho
at Moscow in the other. The remaining
teams do not play games that will
have any bearing on their conference
standing.
The (iilifornia-Washington contest
looks like a victory for the Huskies,
and if it is, it will mark the Boars'
fifth setback in as many weeks, and
their fourth straight conference de
feat. California seems doomed to rest
at the bottom of the list this season,
without a victory over any conference
team to its credit.
Washington, on the other hand, is
not out of the running as yet. If the
Thundering Herd beats the Aggies
and Washington is able to win from
Stanford on November 13, the Hus
kies will be as high as any of the rest
of them. It is with this in view that
the Northerners take the field against
the Bruins Saturday, and, judging from
the fact that they walloped Whitman
44 to 0 last week, it seems as though
they mean business from now until the
season ends.
Washington State College, one of
the big surprises of the year, has won
two conference games and lost only
one, and it appears as though they
will add another victory to their credit
Saturday at the expense of Idaho. The
Vandals are somewhat crippled as a
result of their game against the Ore
gon Aggies, while W.S.C. is in the
best of condition, having had a vaca
j tion last Saturday,
Idaho made a great fight against
0.A.C., but in so doing several of
i Coach Charley Erb's best men were
| bruised and battered and it is doubt
ful if they will be able to present their
i full strength against the Cougars,
j St. Mary's has left for the Inland
| Empire and will meet Gonzaga at Spo
| kane Saturday. This will be the Saints'
| last hard game until they meet Santa
Clara, but Coach Madigan expects
them to come out of the game with
their record clear. Gonzaga has been
weakened for the game because Full
back Luce has been dropped from the
Bulldog squad.
The only other important contest on
| the coast features Santa Clara and
the Cardinals in the Stanford stadium.
Santa Clara has been pointing for this
game and Coach Adam Walsh, former
All-American center and captain of
; the Notre Dame squad which defeated
! Stanford at Pasadena two years ago,
believes that his team has a fighting
I chance against the Redshirts, although
j they are not granted much of an op
portunity by the close followers of
j the game.
j Paul Schissler's Aggies of Oregon
and Howard Jones' Trojans of South
ern California will pay for their Sat
urday's rest by playing a game next
Thursday. This should be one of the
j biggest games of the year, and if the
j Aggies are able to mount the barrier
the Thundering Herd will present,
they will have an excellent chance of
finishing the season without a defeat,
j This will assure them of at least a tie
1 for first place.

of them. It is with this in view that
the Northerners take the field against
the Bruins Saturday, and, judging from
the fact that they walloped Whitman
44 to 0 last week, it seems as though
they mean business from now until the
season ends.
Washington State College, one of
the big surprises of the year, has won
two conference games and lost only
one, and it appears as though they
will add another victory to their credit
Saturday at the expense of Idaho. The
Vandals are somewhat crippled as a
result of their game against the Ore
gon Aggies, while W.S.C. is in the
best of condition, having had a vaca
j tion last Saturday,
Idaho made a great fight against
0.A.C., but in so doing several of
i Coach Charley Erb's best men were
| bruised and battered and it is doubt
ful if they will be able to present their
i full strength against the Cougars,
j St. Mary's has left for the Inland
| Empire and will meet Gonzaga at Spo
| kane Saturday. This will be the Saints'
| last hard game until they meet Santa
Clara, but Coach Madigan expects
them to come out of the game with
their record clear. Gonzaga has been
weakened for the game because Full
back Luce has been dropped from the
Bulldog squad.
The only other important contest on
| the coast features Santa Clara and
the Cardinals in the Stanford stadium.
Santa Clara has been pointing for this
game and Coach Adam Walsh, former
All-American center and captain of
; the Notre Dame squad which defeated
! Stanford at Pasadena two years ago,
believes that his team has a fighting
I chance against the Redshirts, although
j they are not granted much of an op
portunity by the close followers of
j the game.
j Paul Schissler's Aggies of Oregon
and Howard Jones' Trojans of South
ern California will pay for their Sat
urday's rest by playing a game next
Thursday. This should be one of the
j biggest games of the year, and if the
j Aggies are able to mount the barrier
the Thundering Herd will present,
they will have an excellent chance of
finishing the season without a defeat,
j This will assure them of at least a tie
1 for first place.
Neither Stanford nor the Oregon
Aggies, the only two undefeated teams
in the Pacific Coast Conference foot
ball race, has a conference game
scheduled for Saturday afternoon.
Stanford plays Santa Clara in the
stadium and the Aggies are idle, rest
ing for their game with U.S.C. in
Portland on Armistice Day.
Two conference games will be
played Saturday, California meeting
Washington at Seattle in one, and
Washington State clashing with Idaho
at Moscow in the other. The remaining
teams do not play games that will
have any bearing on their conference
standing.
The (iilifornia-Washington contest
looks like a victory for the Huskies,
and if it is, it will mark the Boars'
fifth setback in as many weeks, and
their fourth straight conference de
feat. California seems doomed to rest
at the bottom of the list this season,
without a victory over any conference
team to its credit.
Washington, on the other hand, is
not out of the running as yet. If the
Thundering Herd beats the Aggies
and Washington is able to win from
Stanford on November 13, the Hus
kies will be as high as any of the rest
of them. It is with this in view that
the Northerners take the field against
the Bruins Saturday, and, judging from
