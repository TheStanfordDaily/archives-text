Many of the delegates to the California Scholastic Press Association
are without a place to sleep!!!
1 his is by no means an expose of the home conditions of the high
school students of the State of California. It may sound like a rather
startling situation and an appeal for housing facilities for a homeless
tribe, but the truth of the matter is—there is going to be a high school
press convention on the campus this week-end and many of them are
still in need of a place to sleep tomorrow night.
Many of the houses and halls have crashed through most admirably
with spare beds and guest rooms, but it is too much to ask for three
people to sleep in the same cot all night—even if they do come from the
same high school. Consequently the committee is still hot on the trail
of beds, cots, mattresses, and hay stacks.
One quarter of the expected three hundred delegates will be faculty
advisors and chaperones for the students. This leaves an excellent open
ing for an early solution to a grave and difficult problem. Many of the
professors and more conservative campus residents who do not relish the
idea of having the younger generation tromping around the house are
offered the opportunity of being host to these faculty advisors and
chaperones.
But even so, more housing space is needed for the younger delegates.
Houses and halls are asked to co-operate even to a greater extent if
possible.
The housing headquarters is on the end of Palo Alto 1074. Give it
a ring!
