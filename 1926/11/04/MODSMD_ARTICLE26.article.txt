# "Rating"
## 
### 
It has often been brought to our notice that of all our unjust social
customs, nothing is so unfair as the fact that certain persons "simply
do not rate.'*
When we say that someone "simply does not rate" we mean that we
cannot point to any good reason why we should not want to associate
with them, that we may even recognize their superiority, but that "no
one else wants to chum with them" and so we even disregard our own
feelings to exclude them from our particular social group. Public
opinion, that most fickle and unreasonable standard of judgment, has
been swayed against them, perhaps by the merest chance. Sometime
they may break through the hard shell of social indifference by the sheer
force of their personality; or wealth may solve the problem for them.
But now they don't rate!
To us the words "they don't, rate" and"I am a slave to an unreason
able social system" are synonymous in meaning. No expression so clearly
expresses our lack of real individuality, our social dishonesty. We lose
our individuality because we are following the blindly selfish crowd, a
leaderless group which lets gossip and malignant slander control its
attitudes. We show our collective dishonesty in that we are unwilling
to be fair, reasonable, or even just in our discriminations. We are not
honest to ourselves when we try to hide our slavery to social dictates by
passing the matter off with the accepted expression—"they simply don't
rate."
The objection comes, "if T disregard the social rating of individuals
I am liable to fall back into the very class which I am trying to help."
We would answer that the really "big" man would disregard this danger,
willing to stand on his own merits or sacrifice his standing in a society
which is not worthy of his presence. —U.R.C.
