News dispatches say H. L. Mencken |
is coming to California for a rest.
Why, Theodocious, I'm ashamed of
you, not to know who Mr. Mencken is. J
He is an ed-i-tor and a cri-tic. He
ed-its a green mag-a-zine and criti
cizes just lots of things.
* * *
No, Mr. Mencken's magazine is not
in the Stanford library. It is "not
considered strictly reference mate
rial." Is it in the Palo Alto library?
Yes, but on a shelf behind the desk;
"otherwise it would be stolen."
Mr. Mencken really ought to visit
Stanford. We can provide him most of
the comforts of home. The Rotary
Club is going to meet at Encina Hall.

Premier Mussolini has escaped a
sixth attempted assassination. Italy
seems to be a. nation of blfwik..skirts
and bum shots.

Roble women are planning for an
informal dance with "Cactus Garden
atmosphere."
Ouch!

An Alabama Baptist students' con
ference reports that prohibition
"would be advisable in halting ruthless
drinking, profanity, irreverence, pet
ting, cheating, snobbishness, egotism,
gambling, dancing, wild parties, non
church attendance, stealing, indecent
dress, personal immorality and cor
rupt literature."
Well, if prohibition will keep the
Alabama Baptist students from all
that, we think it "advisable" too.

District Attorney Keyes found eight
long strands of red hair in Ormiston's
trunk.
Another argument for the boyish
bob.

A fish three hundred thousand years
old has been discovered in Utah and
sent to San Francisco by express.
Probably too old to swim.

A Stanford junior has written a

poem "in reply" to Rudyard Kipling's
implied dig at the United States in i
"The Vineyard."
Nothing like giving an old man a
little competition once in a while to
make him respect the younger genera
tion!

BANDITS IN DINNER
CLOTHES ROB GARAGE
—Headline.
Probably a typographical error —
should have been BY GARAGE.

German governmental agencies are
pleading for American capital to get
the French troops out of Germany. A
while ago the French were pleading
for American capital to get the Ger
man troops out of France.
Combine the two for a definition of
international finance!
* * *
A check for $1000 was sent recently
by radio from London to New York. —
News Item.
Our idea of humor would be to
broadcast a $1000 check and not sign
it.

A San Francisco attorney campaign
ing for office went bankrupt the day
before election.

Herbert Hoover says that thei'e are
22,000,000 automobiles in the world
| and America owns 18,000,000 of them.
If he had counted what we drive that
| would have been one more for Amer
j ica.

A Philadelphia heiress, aged 19, has
| traveled 240,000 miles and says any
| prospective suitors will have to catch
up with her.
Well, we'd like a Philadelphia heir
ess as well as the next man but 240',000
miles is just too far to walk.

"Knickers and their place in the
life of the college man" was the sub
ject of a recent Euphronia debate.
There may be disagreement as to
colors, but we thought the place for
'em was settled.
