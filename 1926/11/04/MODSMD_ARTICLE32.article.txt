The Editor, Sir:
An infatuation for certain phases of
modernistic thought, distinguishable
chiefly by small outcroppings of the
notions of James Branch Cabell,
George Jean Nathan, and H. L.
Mencken, obviously has a certain auc
torially-ambitioned gentleman rather
flat on his back. Indeed, "Bull Session"
has reached the advanced stages of
delirious hero-worship.
For love of all righteous, govern
ment-hating men, Mr. Editor, give the
valiant torero a red shirt and the

whole campus for a "pen," and have
him continue his "bull-dosing."
The fellow ridicules sentimentality
with decided nicety. He talks about
J pretzel salesmen, the Anti-Saloon
League, and intellect in such manner
I as to suggest that he may actually, at
j some time or other, have turned very,
very radical and read "Clinical Notes"
and "Editorial Notes." It will be only
a matter of time, I suppose, until he

waters Rotary and Methodism with a
little vitriol.
The tradition of dink-wearing—or
was it of "hazing"?—lost its excuse
for existence when it ceased to be
diverting. Mr. Cabell is a fine writer;
him the doubtful tribute of attempt
ing to turn his work into "boned wis
dom for weak teeth."
But "Bull Session's" prattle, disillu
sioning or re-illusioning, or imitative,
is clever stuff and only infrequently
sophomoric. A certain critic's Big Ber
tha about "Bull Session's" inconsis
tency is a pitiable dud. And the same
critic's iconoclastic exclamation about
sophistry is paltry; moreover, it points
at bis own crying lack of even sophis
tication —which he would have it is
one of "Bull Session's" numerous self
damning qualities.
"Bull Session" is in a class by him
self in The Stanford Daily. He is the
local representative of a certain enter
taining tendency of contemporary
thought. Murder him not: he can
j write; and he can think —in at least
(one way. (Amen.)
Duke of Arena.
The Editor, Sir:
Is it that Bob Lewis underrates the
intelligence of the class of '30, or is it
that he overemphasizes the power of
the "bull session?"
I believe the "bull session" and
| "campus opinion" to be two of the
most vital and interesting parts of the
Daily, and after glancing at the front
page I always hit for the "bull ses
sion." Naturally there are some things
that we differ on; I wouldn't read it
if it were only a reflection of all my
views. We have graduated from the
bottle stage, let us judge for our
selves! Jack Jennison, '30.
