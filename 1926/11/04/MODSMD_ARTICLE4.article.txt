# FRESHMEN FACE BEAR CUBS IN LITTLE BIG GAME AT BERKELEY
## Hunt Will Use Same Team That Beat U.S.C. Babes Last Week 
### Joe Carroll 
Can the team with the best record
win the Little Big Game? That ques
tion will be decided Saturday when
the Stanford freshmen play the Cali
fornia Cubs. The Cardinal yearlings
will go into action with a clear rec
ord. while the Cubs have lost to U.S.C.,
and will have everything to win.
Last night the babes ran through
signal and dummy opposition practice
with a zest that promises the Califor
nia Cubs a real battle Saturday. This
afternoon is the last practice session,
and Coach Hunt will give his men only
a slight workout.
The Stanford eleven has a better
record than any freshman team in the
past few years. The Cardinal babes are
undefeated so far this season, and
have run up the largest score ever
made by any freshman team against
U.S.C. If they win Saturday they will
do something that no freshman team
has ever been able to do —defeat both
U.S.C. and California in the same
season. A win Saturday would bring to
a climax the most successful year that
any freshman team has had.
About twenty of the men will leave
the campus Friday night for Berkeley,
where they will rest up for the con
test. The other members of the squad
go to Berkeley Saturday morning.
Coach Hunt says that he will use
the same team that he has been start
ing during the last few games: Cap
tain Bill Simkins at full, Laird, Frent
rup, or Murphy at halves, Heineke and
Clark, quarters, Templeman and
Lawshe, centers, Driscoll, Fetzer, Ed
die, and Linley, guards, Hodby and
Uurke, tackles, and Albertson, Steine
beck, and Bush, ends, will probably
all see action against the Bear Cubs.
Smith, May, Rothert, and Forster, will
also get a chance.
