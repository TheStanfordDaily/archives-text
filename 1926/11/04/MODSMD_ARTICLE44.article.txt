# LIBRARY BOOKPLATE HAS HIDDEN SYMBOLISM DRAMATIC STORY OF EARLY YEARS' SACRIFICE MRS. STANFORD SOLD JEWELS TO AID FUNDS

Stanford University's bookplate,
found inside the front cover of all
volumes owned by the Library, bears
a significance which usually is un
noticed by persons not acquainted with
certain details of University history.
The average reader sees merely
Athene, goddess of learning, panoplied
in her helmet, coat of mail, and owl
escutcheoned shield, seated in a por
tico with scroll, lamp, and laurel at
her feet, accepting the gifts of Clio,
muse of history, and in return confer
ring upon her the winged statue,
wreath and balm in hand, emblem of
victory.
Symbolic Meaning
But to those who know the interest
ing story of the Jewel Fund, Clio's
gifts represent Mrs. Stanford's sacri
fices in her efforts to fulfill her hus
band's plans, while Athene's winged
statue symbolizes the ultimate victory
which finally assured the University's
continuation despite adverse circum
stances.
After Senator Leland Stanford's
death, his properties became entan
gled in litigation which at times
threatened to put an end, through
lack of funds, to his educational plans.
His wife, however, brought the young
University safely through those trying
first years by selling some of her
jewels, worth almost half a million
dollars, until it was again financially
secure.
Jewels Sold
As conditions grew steadily better,
the jewels were brought back to Cali
fornia but only to be sold again, this
time entirely; for before taking a trip
to Hawaii from which she was never
to return, Mrs. Stanford had requested
the trustees to sell the gems and from
the proceeds to form a "Jewel Fund,"
the yearly income from which, amount
ing to $20,000 a year, was to be spent
entirely on books for the Library.
In the words of Timothy Hopkins,
"It was in commemoration of these
sacrifices that the trustees, when funds
were available, set apart the Jewel
Fund for Library purposes so that the
memory of this noble woman would
be continually in the minds of the stu
dents who are enjoying and who will

| enjoy the benefits of her munificence."
Feeling the need for a Stanford
bookplate, Timothy Hopkins suggested
that the theme of the Jewel Fund
would be appropriate and at the same
time would preserve in a beautiful
form the memory of Mrs. Stanford.
He recommended that Edwin How
land Blashfield, one of America's fore
most artists and renowned for his
purity of line, classic spirit, and dig
nity of design, be approached with the
commission. Although Blashfield had
done nothing in the field of bookplates,
having gained fame principally through
his muralÂ», he was immediately inter
ested in the story back of the pro
jected plate; and, approving Mr. Hop
kins' suggestion of working out the
theme of the jewels in the persons
of Athene and Clio, in 1910 he sub
mitted a preliminary sketch which was
favorably received by the Board of
Trustees.
Blashfield's first plan had been to
make a pen and ink etching, but since
this method proved to be too harsh for
developing the artist's idea he resorted
to a photogravure made from a char
coal drawing. This treatment made
possible the soft gradations found in
the finished plate.
Stanford University's bookplate,
therefore, in the words of Edwin How
land Blashfield, is "a bit of concen
trated significance," and in the opin
ion of alumni it is the "epitome of the
spirit which maintained Stanford in
early days and still persists."
