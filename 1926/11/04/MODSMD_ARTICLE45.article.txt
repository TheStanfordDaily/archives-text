record in a nation-wide intercollegiate
selling contest, according to informa
tion given out at a banquet for campus
salesmen held in the Union last night
under the auspices of the local branch
of the company.

highest individual sales record in the
Stanford group of nineteen students,
whose summer earnings totaled over
$11,430. Stanford salesmen have led
