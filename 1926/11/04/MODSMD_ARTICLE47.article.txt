# COMMITTEE ISSUES CALL FOR BIG GAME STUNT SUGGESTIONS
## 
### 
The Rally Committee yesterday is
sued a second call for suggestions for
rooters' stunts to be used at the Wash
ington and California games. Ideas
are urgently wanted, according to Cal
Conron, chairman of the committee,
and will be accepted even in the most
rudimentary stage of development.
The committee will work up the stunt
in accordance with the size of the
rooting section and the colored cards
available.
All suggested stunts which can be
developed for use will go into compe
tition for the permanent trophy cup
offered each year by the Rally Com
mittee for the best rah-rah idea. The
only restrictions on the suggestions
are that they should symbolize one of
the competing institutions and should
be submitted at an early date to the
Rally Committee, Box 577, Campus.
