# FRESHMEN TO PLAY SENIOR GRID TEAM ON STADIUM FIELD
## 
### 
The interclass grid contest between
the first-year men and the seniors has
been switched from the morning of
the Little Big Game to tomorrow after
noon at 4:15 o'clock in order that the
freshmen may go t,o Berkeley next
Saturday afternoon to root for their
football team in its tussle against the
Hear Cubs. The junior-sophomore
game will be played as scheduled at 9
o'clock Saturday morning.
The stadium has been secured for
the senior-frosh game, while the jun
iors and sophomores will play on the
freshman field near Encina gym. No
one team has the title cinched as a
result of games already played, and
while the seniors look like the best
bet to romp off with top honors, the
frosh may spill the dope and win the
game.
