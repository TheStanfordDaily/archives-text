# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
In beginning a series on "Football
Stars of Other Years," there is no
more fitting subject for the first draw
ing and article than Walter Camp,
Vale, ISSO, known throughout the land
as "The Father of American Football."
After Walter Camp's sudden death in
New York City on March 14, 1925, the
Football Rules Committee, of which
Mr. Camp had been a member from
1879 until 1925, adopted a resolution
with the following as its closing para
graph:
"American Rugby Football has lost
its founder and its greatest champion,
but his influence on the game will en
dure as long as the game is played."
It is not my intention to write about
Walter Camp, the leader in the evolu
tion of the game of football, nor Wal
ter Camp, the great coach and director
of Yale's gridiron sti'ategy. Nor is
there space here to tell of Walter
Camp, the author, whose numerous
contributions on sports, and on auction
bridge, have been read by millions of
people. The late Walter Camp is well
' nown as the originator of "The Daily
Dozen" and the annual "All America
Teams," but it is of Walter Camp,

J the football player, that I wish to tell.
| For Walter Camp was such an out
| standing player that if he had begun
making his All-Star selections ten
years earlier, he would have been
laced with the embarrassing predica
ment of putting himself on his All-
America team! For six years (and
they were six long, lean years for Har
vard ) young Walt Camp ran riot up
and down the gridirons of the East.
Besides being a member of every var
sity team at New Haven, Camp was
halfback of the football eleven and
captain of the team for two years.
As a player, Walter Camp was.ex
ceptionally fast and strong. He was a
fine punter and place-kicker, and once
kicked a 35-yard drop-kick against
Harvard. Although Camp is credited
; with having invented interference, he
often made long sensational runs un
aided. He once caught a punt and ran
80 yards through the entire Princeton
team. But young Camp's chief char
acteristic was his ability to think
quickly during a game. His play
throughout his career was always
noted for the highest" standards of
sportsmanship.

of Yale's gridiron sti'ategy. Nor is
there space here to tell of Walter
Camp, the author, whose numerous
contributions on sports, and on auction
bridge, have been read by millions of
people. The late Walter Camp is well
' nown as the originator of "The Daily
Dozen" and the annual "All America
Teams," but it is of Walter Camp,

J the football player, that I wish to tell.
| For Walter Camp was such an out
| standing player that if he had begun
making his All-Star selections ten
years earlier, he would have been
laced with the embarrassing predica
ment of putting himself on his All-
America team! For six years (and
they were six long, lean years for Har
vard ) young Walt Camp ran riot up
and down the gridirons of the East.
Besides being a member of every var
sity team at New Haven, Camp was
halfback of the football eleven and
captain of the team for two years.
As a player, Walter Camp was.ex
ceptionally fast and strong. He was a
fine punter and place-kicker, and once
kicked a 35-yard drop-kick against
Harvard. Although Camp is credited
; with having invented interference, he
often made long sensational runs un
aided. He once caught a punt and ran
80 yards through the entire Princeton
team. But young Camp's chief char
acteristic was his ability to think
quickly during a game. His play
throughout his career was always
noted for the highest" standards of
sportsmanship.


Lest We Forget
In beginning a series on "Football
Stars of Other Years," there is no
more fitting subject for the first draw
ing and article than Walter Camp,
Vale, ISSO, known throughout the land
as "The Father of American Football."
After Walter Camp's sudden death in
New York City on March 14, 1925, the
Football Rules Committee, of which
Mr. Camp had been a member from
1879 until 1925, adopted a resolution
with the following as its closing para
graph:
"American Rugby Football has lost
its founder and its greatest champion,
but his influence on the game will en
dure as long as the game is played."
It is not my intention to write about
Walter Camp, the leader in the evolu
tion of the game of football, nor Wal
ter Camp, the great coach and director
of Yale's gridiron sti'ategy. Nor is
there space here to tell of Walter
