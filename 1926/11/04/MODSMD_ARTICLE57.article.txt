lege," was upheld by John Reid and
John Cranston, and the negative by
Arthur Angel and Louis Mercado.
Each was given ten minutes to speak
with a five-minute rebuttal.
The affirmative decried knickers as
a useless fad, a passing whim, a mere
fancy, adding with great gusto that
''oris are signs of puerility, weak-mind
edness, and reversion to childhood. It
was further stated by the affirmative
that health and the very cogs of in
dustry suffer disability at the hands of
his growing fad. Mill-workers, due to
the lessening of demand for wool, are
thrown out of work, thus is industry
effected.

citing Shakespeare, Louis XIV, the
Continental Army, and the Knicker
bockers of New York as famous wear
