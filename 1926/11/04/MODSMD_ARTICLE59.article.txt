# Leaky Bucket Causes Rush Fire Suspicioned From Drip But Man Is Only Fooling
## 
### 
One of the main characters in
Dante's Inferno came to life yesterday
in the Corporation Yard, when an
anxious-faced person was seen to make
several hasty trips with a perforated
bucket between a running hose and
the interior of a garage.
At the end of each trip, drops of
water amounting to several hundred
were agitatedly thrown inside the
door, and another trip started, during
which all seven holes in the container
poured torrents of water upon the
ankles of the carrier.
Investigation revealed that the ener
getic worker was not engaged in dous
ing a fire, as was at first surmised,
but was industriously wetting down a
section of newly-laid dirt garage floor.
Much driveway was drowned in the
process, while, after eight consequtive
trips, an area approximating only four
square feet was dewed in the garage.
