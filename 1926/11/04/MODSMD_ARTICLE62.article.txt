## 
### 
The Princeton University Band this
year might better be known as geo
metrical musicians following the meth
od of preparing for its complicated
maneuvers, in order that the first
clarinetist won't end up under the
shadow of one goal and the bass-drum
mer under the other, each man's posi
tion and the number of paces be is to
take are planned long ahead of time
and the arrangement is thoroughly
gone over and explained. To do this,
each formation is worked out in detail
on graph paper so that each musician
may get an idea of just what he is
supposed to do and also where he is
supposed to do it.
The Prince'on Band is also unique
in its method of forming letters, it
being distinguished from other college
organizations by its concert forma
tion; other college bands merely
grouping around the leader, while the
Princeton band has a set method of
marching in this formation.
