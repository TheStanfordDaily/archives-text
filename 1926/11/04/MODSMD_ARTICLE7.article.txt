# TWENTY-TWO ENTER ANNUAL INTRAMURAL CROSS-COUNTRY RUN
## Race Will Be Preliminary Event to Washington Game 
### 
Twenty-two entries have been made j
to date for the annual intramural
cross-country run which will be a pre- |
liminary to the Washington football ,
1 game on November 13. All clubs or in-;
dividuals who are planning to enter |
the event are urged by C. W. Davis, !
director of intramural athletics, to be
gin training now.
No entries have been received as j
yet from Encina Hall, so that the j
freshmen are not represented. Davis ,
asks that members of the class sign !
up immediately for the run.
The course, which is marked by red
' and blue flags, will begin with a lap i
j around the stadium, up to the Phi j
Gamma Delta house, through French
man's creek, and back around the!
Sigma Nu house, Dink Templeton's
j house, by Branner and into the sta-
I dium through the rear entrance, finish
ing in front of the Stanford rooting
, section.
Each club or fraternity may enter
I
any number of men, but the three fin
ishing in the best places will be
! counted. Los Arcos won the run last
; year with the low score of 35. Bob
Swain was the winner of the race.
On the yearly intramural scoring
plan, first place counts 15 points, sec
i ond place 10 points, third place 5
! points, fourth place 3 points, and fifth
place 1 point. Any team which has
th'ree men finish is given five points.
Davis suggests that a running shoe
with short spikes be used by those in
the race, as the country traveled over
is quite rough.
A physical examination is necessary
before any man will be allowed to par
ticipate in the event. Several of those
â€¢ expecting to enter are going over the
course every night, and any who wish
to may go with them to acquaint ;
j themselves with the course, declares j
Davis.
