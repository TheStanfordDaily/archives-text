# BRONCOS FACE REDSHIRTS ON STADIUM FIELD
## Captain Cassanova to Lead Missions Using Notre Dame Shift SANTA CLARA PREPARED Warner Fails to Announce Cardinal Starting Lineup 
### George Story 
Adam Walsh's Santa Clara Broncos
will invade the Stanford campus to
morrow afternoon to engage in a foot
ball contest with Pop Warner's Cardi
nals. Said contest will be played in
the stadium and the kick-off is sched
uled for 2: 30i o'clock.
The Redshirts worked out yesterday
afternoon, and another signal drill is
billed for today. In the practice Thurs
day Warner emphasized defense. He
gave the third team a few of the
standard Notre Dame plays used by
Saul a Clara and had them run these
plays, pointing out to the varsity the
correct method of stopping aforemen
tioned plays.
Varsity in Shape
The Stanford squad is in good shape,
considering the hard game it played
last Saturday at Los Angeles. Dick
Hyland has had to favor his injured
leg a bit and Eli Post's knee is still
causing him to limp, but aside from
these two, the men are ready for the
Broncos.
Just who will start the game War
ner has not made known, but it is
almost certain that practically all of
the first-stringers will be in the lineup,
for the Santa Clara team is not one
to be taken lightly.
Despite the fact that Stanford rules
a three-to-one favorite and is expected
to win by two touchdowns, the Mis
sion team will afford some real oppo
sition before the afternoon is over.
They lost two games early in the sea
son, but since that time they have
been steadily improving and their 25
to 0 victory over Nevada last Saturday
shows that they rank well up on the
list. Stanford defeated Nevada 33 to 9
and St. Mary's wag able to win from
them by only a 13 to 0 margin.
Have Versatile Attack
With Captain Cassanova leading the
attack, the Broncos have a set of
speedy end runs and off-tackle smash
es such as make Notre Dame famous.
They also have some deceptive for
ward passes and a real punter in
Cassanova.
Walsh has been pointing his men for
the Stanford game and they expect to
spring a surprise or two tomorrow.
