# TRIANGULAR SPORTS DAY PLANS PRAISED BY ROBLE GYM HEAD
## Majority Participation in Women's Athletics Is Recommended 
### 
Intercollegiate amletic co-operation
as a substitute for intercollegiate com
petition, which was abolished three
years ago by the international conven
tion of W.A.A., will be tested in the
first triangular Play Day participated
in by the University of California,
Mills College, and Stanford Univer
sity tomorrow at California, in the
opuiion of Mrs. Ruth Calvin, Acting
Director of Roble Gymnasium.

A tendency to train a select few
instead of giving the majority an
opportunity to participate in athletic
activities was a consideration which
actuated W.A.A. in eliminating compe
tition between women of various col
leges, believes Mrs. Calvin.
Commenting on Stanford's attitude
in the matter, Mrs. Calvin says:"I
think that the work offered by the
women's athletic department at Stan
ford is for recreation and for improved
health, and not at all to turn out stars
to make a spectacle for the public. In
intercollegiate competition, an effort
is made to help your best players and
concentrate on them in order to turn
out the best possible team. The girls
themselves feel the responsibility of
doing their best for Stanford and thus
compete whether they are physically
(It or not. Certain girls would special
ize in physical activities and some
times overdo themselves. Athletics
should be played for the sake of the
game and not for the sake of winning."
Evils Removed
Mrs. Calvin believes that the ad
vantages of intercollegiate competi
tion are obtained in the Play Day.
It enables the women to meet people
from other universities and make so
cial contacts, and to learn how the
game is played in other places and
what methods are used. You have the
fun of the game without the evils of
competition. As every squad on Sat
urday will consist of girls from each
college, Ihere will be no desperate
competition between teams.
"In our physical education activity
for women, there is a tendency to
avoid specialization by the few and
give recreation to the largest possible
| number," concludes Mrs. Calvin.
