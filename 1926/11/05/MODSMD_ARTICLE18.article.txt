# STANFORD FRESHMEN BATTLE CALIFORNIA TEAM AT BERKELEY
## Twenty-One Men Go With Coaches Today; Rest Follow Tomorrow BABES HAVE ADVANTAGE Cub Backfield Has Good Scoring Record for 1926 Season 
### Joe Carroll 
The Stanford freshman football
team faces the test of the season
when they meet the University of
California Cubs tomorrow afternoon in
the Little Big Game. The contest will
be played in the Memorial Stadium at
; Berkeley, and members of the Class
j of 1930 are pressing every available
, means of transportation into service
in order to get across the bay to
j cheer for their team.
That they have a real team to cheer
: for is proven by the fact that the
j squad has come undefeated through a
I very stiff schedule. The Cardinal babes
are given only a slight edge over the
California Cubs, however, because of
. the hard game played last Saturday
in scoring a decisive victory over the
j U.S.C. freshmen. Coach Husky Hunt
liimself says that he would give the
Stanford team a real margin if the
game were to be played at the end
j of another week, while he will be quite
I content with a win tomorrow as long
' as it is a win.
Warner Gives Advice
Coach Pop Warner gave a short talk
to the squad yesterday afternoon just
! before the men took their last light
workout. He gave them several point
ers upon defense formations against
California plays that has worked up
i during the past years for the varsity.
He told the team that their victory
over the IT.S.C. freshmen made as big
I a hit with the Stanford alumni in
j Southern California as did the var-
I sity's win over the Trojans.
Cub Team Strong
The California Cubs expect to fur
: nish the babes with plenty of oppo-
J sition before the afternoon's enter
i tainment is over. Coach Clint Evans
has several men in his backfield who
' would look pretty nice to Nibs Price
if he could use them on his California
varsity. Captain Eisan, Rice, and Lom,
all backfield men, have given oppos
; ing teams a lot of trouble. Eisan is a
good all-around football player, while
Lom was responsible for most of the
points made by the Cubs when they
defeated Sacramento Junior College 34
to 0. Sacramento held the Babes to
I a 6 to 0 score.
The following men leave for Berke
ley this afternoon: Laird, Steinbeck,
Templeman, Smith, Captain Simkins,
; Linley, Rothert, Murphy, May, T. Dris
| coll, Albertson, Bush, Hobdy, Hein
' ecke. Burke, Dowling, Fetzer, Hulen,
Frentrup, Clark, and Dietrick.
Those who are to leave Saturday
are: Rauta, Leonhardt, Musto, Mann,
Goodcell, Taylor, Crumley, Zelirback,
Dutton, Torrence, Eddie, Tompson,
Piggott, Kopp, Forster, Neill, L. Dris
coll, Tliorndson, Speers, Hoxie, Lyman,

Bob Frazee will probably act as yell
i leader tomorrow and requests that all
1930 men attend.

Bob Frazee will probably act as yell
i leader tomorrow and requests that all
1930 men attend.
The Stanford freshman football
team faces the test of the season
when they meet the University of
California Cubs tomorrow afternoon in
the Little Big Game. The contest will
be played in the Memorial Stadium at
; Berkeley, and members of the Class
j of 1930 are pressing every available
, means of transportation into service
in order to get across the bay to
j cheer for their team.
That they have a real team to cheer
: for is proven by the fact that the
j squad has come undefeated through a
I very stiff schedule. The Cardinal babes
are given only a slight edge over the
California Cubs, however, because of
. the hard game played last Saturday
in scoring a decisive victory over the
j U.S.C. freshmen. Coach Husky Hunt
liimself says that he would give the
Stanford team a real margin if the
game were to be played at the end
j of another week, while he will be quite
I content with a win tomorrow as long
' as it is a win.
Warner Gives Advice
Coach Pop Warner gave a short talk
to the squad yesterday afternoon just
! before the men took their last light
workout. He gave them several point
ers upon defense formations against
California plays that has worked up
i during the past years for the varsity.
He told the team that their victory
over the IT.S.C. freshmen made as big
I a hit with the Stanford alumni in
j Southern California as did the var-
I sity's win over the Trojans.
Cub Team Strong
The California Cubs expect to fur
: nish the babes with plenty of oppo-
J sition before the afternoon's enter
i tainment is over. Coach Clint Evans
has several men in his backfield who
' would look pretty nice to Nibs Price
if he could use them on his California
varsity. Captain Eisan, Rice, and Lom,
all backfield men, have given oppos
; ing teams a lot of trouble. Eisan is a
good all-around football player, while
Lom was responsible for most of the
points made by the Cubs when they
defeated Sacramento Junior College 34
to 0. Sacramento held the Babes to
I a 6 to 0 score.
The following men leave for Berke
ley this afternoon: Laird, Steinbeck,
Templeman, Smith, Captain Simkins,
; Linley, Rothert, Murphy, May, T. Dris
