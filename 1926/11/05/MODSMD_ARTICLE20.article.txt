# Biggest Little Game
## 
### 
Future varsity men of Stanford and California will meet each other
for the first time tomorrow when the freshman football teams from the
two institutions meet on the gridiron at Berkeley. Tomorrow is the
time of the Little Big Game, the Red Letter Day for all first-year
football men.
For the first time, as far as we can remember, the Stanford freshmen
go into the contest the favorites to win. In 1923 the Cardinals won, but
they were not conceded a chance before the game. Then the next year
the B ear Cubs were again smothered under an avalanche of red shirts,
but even the most optimistic Stanford supporters gave the Cards onl), a
fighting chance to win that day back in 1924. In this eventful year,
Stanford is actually doped to win before the whistle starts the hour of
football tomorrow.
From a poor start the Stanford freshmen have gradually gathered
momentum until last Saturday they were going at full speed, and con
sequently the Southern California babes got in the way and were run
over by a score of 27 to 0. Since last Saturday the freshmen have not
put on the brakes a notch, which was well demonstrated in practice in
the last few days.
But no California team, even a freshman eleven, is to be beaten
without a struggle, and if any of the Stanford team thinks for a minute
that they are going to have a nice easy afternoon of practice tomorrow
they had better get the idea out of their head before they go to bed
tonight. For, like their traditional symbol—the Bear —California is not
to be trusted. They fight to the end.
To Husky Hunt goes the credit for their being a championship team
on the campus this year, for looking over the roster we find hardly a
star. Instead of eleven high school stars, we find one football machine,
which can beat any number of stars. Hunt met the yearlings for the
first time on September 15, and in seven short weeks he has produced
a well-balanced team.
Pop Warner has the distinction of being the Old Fox, but Hunt
should at least have the title of the Young Fox.
