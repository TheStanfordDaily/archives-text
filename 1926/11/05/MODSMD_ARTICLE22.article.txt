# COLLEGE MEN FAIL IN BUSINESS SAYS EXECUTIVE AUTHOR

### 
"Why does the college man fail in
business?" It is either because "he
wants to get married, or, more often,
he is in debt for his college expenses." ;
states W. A. Armstrong, representing
modern Big Business, in the Atlantic
Monthly for July 1926,
"He. has developed tastes, entirely
legitimate, that call for money golf,
his Ford, his college club," continues
Mr. Armstrong.
There are executives that can make
allowances for the results of a college
education, but the great majority of
them have no tolerance for the so
called privileges of the college man. \

They refuse to make allowances for
the enthusiasm and the loyalty that
has been literally built into a univer
sity graduate during his four to six
years of college training.
The college man, likewise, has his
bone to pick with the old-fashioned
executive. "Not the least of the shocks
from which the college man must re
cover is his discovery that "business,
even Big Business, is unbusinesslike.
In many cases he is let down. In nine
cases out of ten, he finds his work
too easy."
In spHe of this distressing state of
affairs, business leadership is gradu
ally passing from the old school of
executives to the modern college man,
who will find "play for all the inven
tiveness, the courage, the endurance,
that has gone at any time into human
achievement."
