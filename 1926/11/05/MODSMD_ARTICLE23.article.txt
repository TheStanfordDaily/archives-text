At this writing it appears that the
Wright Act is not to be repealed.
We are reminded of the classic re
mark of one of those intensely inter
esting young men who came over here
from Oxford to uphold the wet side of
the prohibition question in a debate
with a Stanford team. In predicting
the failure of his side to win the vote
of the audience, he remarked dryly,
"We labor under a disadvantage. Some
of our staunchest supporters are un
able to get here to vote."
His pessimism was warranted.
While his supporters were remember
ing him by turning down an empty
glass, the ladies of Palo Alto voted
him down.

It was O. O. Mclntyre, we believe,
who stood in front of the mammoth
Wrigley sign in New York and
watched the grotesque green man of
the electric lights cavort as if in ad
vanced stages of acute indigestion.
Mclntyre could not quite understand
why people would buy chewing gum
, simply because it was associated in
j their minds with weird and apparent
ly uncomfortable automatoms.
Probably for the same reason that
motorists buy certain makes of gaso
line because they associate them with
an abortive looking cowboy, a picture
of a large chapel decorated with a
; mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount,
| and the name of a great university.
