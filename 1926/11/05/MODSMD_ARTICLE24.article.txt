# "COLD LIGHT" AMONG FISHES DISCUSSED BY DAVID STARR JORDAN
## Magazine Article Tells of Recent Investigation Made in Field 
### 
In an article appearing in last
month's Scientific American, "Cold
Lights of the Sea," Dr. David Starr
Jordan explains that due to the ex
plorations of great dredging steamers
within the last century we have
learned much hitherto unsuspected
concerning life in the depths of the
ocean.
It has been ascertained that fish
occur at all depths, even down to four
or five miles below the level of the
ocean. The surface fish are colored
blue above, like the sea, and white
below, like the sky, as a defense
aeainst birds and other fish, while the ;
fish of the tropics are bright like the '
coral reefs they stay near, but the ,
fish found at the depth of the red sea- j
weed are largely plain red. "We know
that black is the invariable color of
all fishes from about a thousand feet
down to five miles. The first fish |
from the black depths was taken in
1810, off Messina, by Constantine
Rofinesque. It was a little black crea-1
ture with big eyes. Its body was j
marked with many round white spots,
which were luminous in life, although
its discoverer did not know it," writes
Dr. Jordan.
Color Changes
More than a hundred different spe
cies of the type of this Myctophini. or
night-light, as it was called, were later
dredged, all known as "lantern-fislies" ,
because the round white spot.-; shine !
in the dark. "All of them have very I
large eyes and find way in the !
dark by the aid of the lanterns they
carry. In all cases these lanterns are
many, and are variously placed in the
different species. They are usually j
ranged in broken rows along the sides j
of the head and body. In two species
those in front are enlarged to cover
the whole front, like the headlights
of an engine.
"The luminous spots are known }
technically as pliotophores. In most
cases they are small and round, about
the size of pin-heads, either raised
above the skin or sunk into it. They
are sometimes simple, plain shining i
spots ringed with black pigment. More
often each contains a bright reflector. I
Most of the substance of the luminous
organ is granular, excreting slime,
which too may be more or less lumi-

I nous. While this light is produced by
: oxidation there is no evidence that
! any heat whatever is developed in
' connection with it," states Dr. Jordan
in his article.
Not Like Fireflies
Although the phosphorescence re
j suiting from the decay of certain sub-
I stances is said to be due to luminous
I bacteria, such is not the case with
i the fish photophores, for the light
ceases with the death of the fish. Nor
is there anything in common between
the light organs of fishes and those
of fireflies and other similar insects.
Dr. Jordan goes on to say: "It is
also evident that the five types of
phosphorescent structures found
among fishes are derived independent
ly, through the agency of a common
need, and not from common heredity."
A different type of lantern is the bait
offered by a few kinds of deep-sea
1 anglers. A projection above the mouth,
an elongation of the dorsal spine, is
provided with a fringe of tentacles in
j the center of which is a luminous
; gland. When the smaller fishes nibble
J at this bait they are engulfed.
Bacteria Make Light
The third type of lantern is to be
found in a species of grenadier or
"rat tails." It is a large gland lying in
the skin of the belly, from which,

under pressure, a slimy luminous se
cretion is poured. By the light of a
solution of this slime in water one
could read a newspaper.
, In another group luminous blotches
| on the sides of the head are infested
with light-producing bacteria. Then
i there is the "singing fish," so-called
; because of the quavering noise pro
■ duced when it crowds the air from
| one • part of the swim bladder to an
other. The light of the photophores,
| arranged like buttons along its breast
| and belly, does not appear except un
der artificial stimulation.
A fifth type of luminosity occurs in
j several deep-sea sliarklets. In these
, the whole belly is faintly luminous,
' shining with a diffuse green light, al
though no light-producing structures
have yet been discovered.
In concluding his article, Dr. Jordan
jsays: "The whole range of phenomena
of cold light under the sea is a very
j interesting one, and it still offers room
1 for much further investigation as does
also the kindred one of 'torpedo' fish,
j which yield vigorous electric shocks."

In an article appearing in last
month's Scientific American, "Cold
Lights of the Sea," Dr. David Starr
Jordan explains that due to the ex
plorations of great dredging steamers
within the last century we have
learned much hitherto unsuspected
concerning life in the depths of the
ocean.
It has been ascertained that fish
occur at all depths, even down to four
or five miles below the level of the
ocean. The surface fish are colored
blue above, like the sea, and white
below, like the sky, as a defense
aeainst birds and other fish, while the ;
fish of the tropics are bright like the '
coral reefs they stay near, but the ,
fish found at the depth of the red sea- j
weed are largely plain red. "We know
that black is the invariable color of
all fishes from about a thousand feet
down to five miles. The first fish |
from the black depths was taken in
1810, off Messina, by Constantine
Rofinesque. It was a little black crea-1
ture with big eyes. Its body was j
marked with many round white spots,
which were luminous in life, although
its discoverer did not know it," writes
Dr. Jordan.
Color Changes
More than a hundred different spe
cies of the type of this Myctophini. or
night-light, as it was called, were later
dredged, all known as "lantern-fislies" ,
because the round white spot.-; shine !
in the dark. "All of them have very I
large eyes and find way in the !
dark by the aid of the lanterns they
carry. In all cases these lanterns are
many, and are variously placed in the
different species. They are usually j
ranged in broken rows along the sides j
of the head and body. In two species
those in front are enlarged to cover
the whole front, like the headlights
of an engine.
"The luminous spots are known }
technically as pliotophores. In most
cases they are small and round, about
the size of pin-heads, either raised
above the skin or sunk into it. They
are sometimes simple, plain shining i
spots ringed with black pigment. More
often each contains a bright reflector. I
Most of the substance of the luminous
organ is granular, excreting slime,
which too may be more or less lumi-

I nous. While this light is produced by
: oxidation there is no evidence that
! any heat whatever is developed in
' connection with it," states Dr. Jordan
in his article.
Not Like Fireflies
Although the phosphorescence re
j suiting from the decay of certain sub-
I stances is said to be due to luminous
I bacteria, such is not the case with
i the fish photophores, for the light
ceases with the death of the fish. Nor
is there anything in common between
the light organs of fishes and those
of fireflies and other similar insects.
Dr. Jordan goes on to say: "It is
also evident that the five types of
phosphorescent structures found
among fishes are derived independent
ly, through the agency of a common
need, and not from common heredity."
A different type of lantern is the bait
offered by a few kinds of deep-sea
1 anglers. A projection above the mouth,
an elongation of the dorsal spine, is
provided with a fringe of tentacles in
j the center of which is a luminous
; gland. When the smaller fishes nibble
J at this bait they are engulfed.
Bacteria Make Light
The third type of lantern is to be
found in a species of grenadier or
"rat tails." It is a large gland lying in
the skin of the belly, from which,

under pressure, a slimy luminous se
cretion is poured. By the light of a
solution of this slime in water one

Dr. Jordan goes on to say: "It is

phosphorescent structures found
among fishes are derived independent

need, and not from common heredity."
A different type of lantern is the bait
offered by a few kinds of deep-sea

J at this bait they are engulfed.
Bacteria Make Light
The third type of lantern is to be
found in a species of grenadier or
"rat tails." It is a large gland lying in
the skin of the belly, from which,

under pressure, a slimy luminous se
cretion is poured. By the light of a
solution of this slime in water one
could read a newspaper.

jsays: "The whole range of phenomena

In an article appearing in last
month's Scientific American, "Cold
Lights of the Sea," Dr. David Starr
Jordan explains that due to the ex
plorations of great dredging steamers
within the last century we have
learned much hitherto unsuspected
concerning life in the depths of the
ocean.
It has been ascertained that fish
occur at all depths, even down to four
or five miles below the level of the
ocean. The surface fish are colored
blue above, like the sea, and white
below, like the sky, as a defense
aeainst birds and other fish, while the ;
fish of the tropics are bright like the '
coral reefs they stay near, but the ,
fish found at the depth of the red sea- j
weed are largely plain red. "We know
that black is the invariable color of
all fishes from about a thousand feet
down to five miles. The first fish |
from the black depths was taken in
1810, off Messina, by Constantine
Rofinesque. It was a little black crea-1
ture with big eyes. Its body was j
marked with many round white spots,
which were luminous in life, although
its discoverer did not know it," writes
Dr. Jordan.
Color Changes
More than a hundred different spe
cies of the type of this Myctophini. or
night-light, as it was called, were later
dredged, all known as "lantern-fislies" ,
because the round white spot.-; shine !
in the dark. "All of them have very I
large eyes and find way in the !
dark by the aid of the lanterns they
carry. In all cases these lanterns are
many, and are variously placed in the
different species. They are usually j
ranged in broken rows along the sides j
of the head and body. In two species
those in front are enlarged to cover
the whole front, like the headlights
of an engine.
"The luminous spots are known }
technically as pliotophores. In most
cases they are small and round, about
the size of pin-heads, either raised
above the skin or sunk into it. They
are sometimes simple, plain shining i
spots ringed with black pigment. More
often each contains a bright reflector. I
Most of the substance of the luminous
organ is granular, excreting slime,
which too may be more or less lumi-

I nous. While this light is produced by
: oxidation there is no evidence that
! any heat whatever is developed in
' connection with it," states Dr. Jordan
in his article.
Not Like Fireflies
Although the phosphorescence re
j suiting from the decay of certain sub-
I stances is said to be due to luminous
I bacteria, such is not the case with
i the fish photophores, for the light
ceases with the death of the fish. Nor
is there anything in common between
the light organs of fishes and those
of fireflies and other similar insects.
