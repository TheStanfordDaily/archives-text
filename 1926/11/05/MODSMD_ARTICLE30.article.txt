# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Among the "Football Stars of Other
Days" is one whose name is always
mentioned whenever an all-time, all
star backfield is being picked. While
some experts prefer Eddie Mahan of
Harvard, Ted Coy c.f Yale, and "lted"
Grange of Illinois, for the other three
positions, and others claim that Willie
Heston of Michigan, Walter Eckersall
of Chicago, and George Gipp of Notre
Dame, should be the ones chosen, each
and all agree that Jim Thorpe of Car
lisle was easily the greatest all-around
football player who ever trod a grid
iron.
No all-star team is complete without
the name of the wonderful Sac and
Fox Indian at halfback, for it is not
exaggerating to say that Jim Thorpe
could do everything well on a football
field. He was the "Red" Grange of his
time, and what a pity it was that he
did not shine ten or a dozen years
later, for then he could have capital
ized his remarkable athletic gifts to
so much greater extent.
"Lo the Poor Indian," is right! Jim

! lacked Red's looks and personality,
i but he had plenty of color, and he
could do many things that Grange
could not do, such as interfering, kick
ing field goals, either by drop-kicks or
from placement, and punting.
Jim Thorpe was a marvelous broken
field runner and also a great line
plunger. He tackled sure and hard,
and he could pass and receive passes
; with the best of them. His only weak
ness was that he was a little lazy and
j that he loved his "fire-water." Pop
| Warner had to slap him backwards
! over a chair in a hotel lobby once, to
make him realize that training rules
I were meant to be kept.
Jim remained a great football player
! for more than fifteen years. The win-
I
: ter of 1925 saw the passing of this
remarkable player from the gridiron
: forever. As he left the field after a
professional contest in Florida, he
| turned and waved a farewell to the
1 game he had played so long and so
well. It was dramatic, but almost un
| noticed.
