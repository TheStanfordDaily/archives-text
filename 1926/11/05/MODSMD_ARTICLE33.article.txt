# PRINCETON MAN UPHOLDS WORK OF FOOTBALL COACH
## 
### 
Exploding the theory that coaches
are overpaid and underworked, in an
article taken from the Daily Prince
tonian, Lawrence Perry in the current
issue of the Alumni Weekly discusses
the worries and vexations that those
who instruct our football teams must
endure.
"The writer is upon the closest
terms of friendship with coaches in
all sections of the country," Mr. Perry
begins, and he is ready to affirm that
of all the nerve-wracking, physically
debilitating activities, those of the
football coach transcends them all. In
deed, the writer would not wish the
position upon an enemy a hundred
fold more malignant than he may hap
pen to have. Yet there are educators
who hold that the instructor in foot
ball is receiving extravagant remuner-1
ation!
"No coach, Rockne, Roper, Warner, j
or any one else is superior to his ma- :
terial. In order to win in these days j
of keen competition the coach must i
have outstanding material if he may !
hold any hope of building an outstand

ing eleven. You will hear of coaches
who 'developed' their players. They
really did nothing of the sort. They
did mold, to be sure; but had to have
a player first.
