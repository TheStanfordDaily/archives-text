Condemning contests between uni
versity football teams in an article
entitled "Shall We Deflate Intercolle
giate Football," in the current issue
of the "Forum," Alfred Dashiell as
serts that football has become a re
ligious cult, "building stadiums in
stead of cathedrals."
Of the members of the teams, he
states: "Granted that players keep the
training rules —a debatable point with
those who know some football stars —
(here is nothing to prove that men
who play football are more pure out
of soason than the greasiest of grinds.
Famous college football stars have
also been known to figure in murder
trials, in robbery cases, and, from
some of the evidence procured in di
vorce courts, are not particularly
noted for their impeccable conduct."
Showing another side of the situa
tion, Dashiell asks: "What is to be

said of the drunks in the stands whom
the twenty-two clean-lived warriors 011
the gridiron are acording an oppor
tunity for childish exhibitions which
' should have been discarded at the end
of the sophomore year? Their chief
defense of the commercialization of
' the game, the huge stadiums, the in
-1 creased price of tickets, is the old war
I cry, 'Athletics for all!'
"Sportsmanship! Have you ever lis
tened to the conversation in the cheer
ing sections during a game? Such bits
as 'Get that son-of-a-gun! He's yellow!'
j 'Carry him out 011 a stretcher!' are not
!so infrequent as we would like to
J think."
In conclusion the article points out:
"We know we are a young civiliza
tion and inclined to overdo things. But
we can't be sophomores forever. It is
time for a sense of proportion to
enter."
