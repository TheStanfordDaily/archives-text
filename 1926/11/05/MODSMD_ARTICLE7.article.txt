"Does California want an Initiative |
and Referendum?" asked Dr. Jordan
last night while discussing "Democ
-1 racy and the Lessons of the Election." ;
He agreed with Herbert Hoover,
whom he quoted, in asserting that
; while this privilege can be a protec-j
tion, it can also be a decided detriment
when misused.
In commenting upon California's
! constitution, Dr. Jordan pointed out
that, drawn up as it was in the '80's
under the control of the Socialistic
party, it contained such obvious flaws
that California has been attempting
ever since to rectify them, and has at
present some one hundred and twenty ;
I constitutional amendments.

i Dr. Jordan discussed the evolution
of the Republican and Democratic j
| parties, with especial reference to !
| their present strength in various parts !
I of the country. "It is about as danger- j
| ous to be a Democrat in New Eng- ■
land," he said, "as to be a Republican j
jn the South."
By commending such varied person- j
alities as A 1 Smith, the Democratic;
governor of New York, and Senator
Borah, Republican, from Idaho, Dr.
Jordan displayed his usual discrimina
tion. A 1 Smith he characterized as a
man of exceptional ability; Senator j
I Borah he considers one of the most i
1 brilliant and able men in the Senate. I
