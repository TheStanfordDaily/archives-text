# NEW RULINGS AT OXFORD ANTAGONIZE FRESHMEN LOUD WAILS OF WOE ISSUE FROM OXONIANS "LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE REST OF IT" DEMANDED
## 
### 
A loud wail of woe has Rone up from i
the down-trodden undergraduates, not
this time frpm an American university,
hut from no other than that famous
institution â€”Oxford. The English uni-1
versity has issued a new set of rules
pertaining to the conduct of the fresh
men, and these self-same freshmen
have turned and now demand life, lib- !
erty, and the rest of it.
The source of discontent lies in the
difference of opinion regarding the
righteousness of the new rules, which
are quite unlike those of American
colleges. The thorn in the sides of
the young Oxonians is contained in a
booklet entitled "Memorandum on the
Conduct and Discipline of the Junior
Members of the University." Some of
the restrictions which the fiery fresh
men find most difficult to swallow are
as follows:
"It is expected undergraduates will
not loiter in public streets, at coffee
stalls, or at stage doors of theatres.
"Undergraduates may not attend
any public race meetings.
"Undergraduates may not give

dances in public rooms.
"Undergraduates are forbidden to
attend public subscription dances in
or near Oxford.
"Undergraduates are forbidden to
visit the bar of any hotel, restaurant,
or public house.
"Undergraduates may not hire a
motor vehicle for a longer period than
one hour or for a greater distance from
Oxford than five miles without special
leave of the Dean of the college.
"A woman undergraduate may not
enter the rooms of a ma* undergradu
ate either in college or in lodgings
without special leave previously ob
tained from the Principal of her so
ciety. She must have a companion
similarly approved.
"A man undergraduate may not
enter the rooms of a woman under
graduate.
"Men and women undergraduates
may not go on the river or for motor
rides together unless each woman un
dergraduate has previously obtained
leave from the Principal of her college
and there are at least two tvomen in
the party."
