## Sword and Sandals Will Produce Serious Irish Story DAVES TO TAKE LEAD New Generation of Campus Actors Make Initial Appearance 
### 
" 'John Ferguson' is the most highly
dramatic piece of work I have ever
seen on the Stanford stage. I am very
pleased with it, and with the splendid
work which has been done by the cast
in the rehearsals." Such was the com
ment made by Gordon Davis, director,
after final rehearsals yesterday.
Daves Takes Lead
The cast is a mixed group of new
and old faces. Delmer Daves, star of
numerous past productions, is playing
the lead part of John Ferguson, ag<;d
head of the poor Irish family. Ruth
Minskey and Helen Cooper, taking the
parts of the mother and the daughtor
of the family, are appearing for their
first time here. Alonzo Cass appears
for the first time in a serious role as
"Clutie" John Magrath, wandering
beggar.
Howard Wickersliam and Stanley
Mullin, with experience in dramatics
at other schools, are taking the parts
of Andrew Ferguson and James Cae
sar, characters of great contrast.
Henry Witherow, the oppressive land
lord, is recreated by Joseph Catanich,
and the two minor parts, that of Ser
geant Kernaghan and Sara Mawhinney
are done by Rupert Adams and John
Truman.
Strong Cast Selected
Davis selected the cast from an un
usually strong competitive field, and
in his opinion they will likely repre
sent a new generation of actors for
the Stanford stage.
The performance begins at 8:15
o'clock tonight. Tickets may still be
obtained in the Old Union today or at
the box office window at the Assembly
Hall tonight.
