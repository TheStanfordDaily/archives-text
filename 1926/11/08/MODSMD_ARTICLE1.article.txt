# BABE FOOTBALLERS BOW TO BEAR COBS IN HARD CONTEST
## Captain Lee Eisan, Ben Lom Star by Speed, Clever Open Field Work BERKELEY BACKS GOOD Stanford Babes Make More First Downs Than Cal Yearling Eleven 
### 
Too much speed and shifty footwork
on the part of Captain Lee Eisan and'
Benny Lom of the California Cubs
spelled defeat to the Stanford fresh
men in the Little Big Game Saturday
at Berkeley. The final score was 44
to 20, due not to any decided superi
ority of the Berkeley team as a wholo,
but traceable directly to the running
and passing of these two men and the
good work of Rice and Pitto, the other
backfield men on the California team.
Cubs Get Breaks
As a matter of cold figures, the Stan
ford babes made nearly twice as many
first downs as the Berkeley boys did.
But the long runs of Lom and Eisan,
mixed in with a few passes, a good
many breaks, and assisted by some
poor work on the part of the officials,
set these gains at naught. The Cardi
nals did make three touchdowns, and
they earned those touchdowns by
carrying the ball down the field by
main strength and good football. But
where the Cardinals worked hard for
their points, Lom, Eisan, or Rice would
garner a touchdown in one or two
plays. Rice ran a kick-off back for a
score, and got California credit for a
touchdown, although he ran out of
bounds on the play.
Lom, Eisan Star
The California freshmen led at half
time 23 to 0, due to the running of
Lom and the field generalship of
Eisan, aided by the trusty toe of Rico,
who converted two touchdowns and
booted a field goal. The Stanford
players looked rather poor on some of
the tackles that they attempted, but
the Cal backs were too good for them.
Many times a redshirted babe laid his
hands on Lom or Eisan only to have
him wriggle free, and run on down
the field. Poor officiating let the Cal
men keep on running with the ball,
even after their forward progress hud
been stopped.
The Cubs made one touchdown from
their own twenty-yard line in two
plays, Eisan running through the cen
ter of the Stanford team for twenty
six yards, and Lom carrying the ball
the rest of the way.
Frentrup Fumbles
The freshmen started down the
field from the opening kick-ofl by mak
ing four first downs in a row, mowing
down Cal players to advance the ball
consistently. Then Frentrup fumbled
on a reverse play when he was tackled,
and Handy recovered for California.
Lom made two lirst downs in a row,
and passed to Eisan for the third. He
then passed to Rice, but a Stanford
back blocked the pass, only to have
Rice scoop the ball up and make a
touchdown, which he failed to convert.
Stanford received the next kick-off,
and started out again, when a Stanford
man was offside, and the babes were
unable to make yardage. Frentrup
kicked for only twelve yards, and Lom
took the ball on the next play on a
laleral basketball pass from FJisan,
who ran outside the playing field, and
continued on for a touchdown. Rice
converted.
Stanford again began a march down
the field, but lost the ball, Hobdy
throwing a fifty-yard pass over the
goal line to give Cal a touchback and
the ball on the twenty-yard line. Then
Eisan and Lom made a touchdown in
two plays. Rice again converted. He
made a place-kick for three points in
another few minutes. That ended the
half.
Babes Start Drive
After the half Stanford began a
scoring drive that would not be denied.
They gave the ball to California on a
punt, and Lom soon returned com
pliment by a kick over the goal line.
Then Frentrup ran sixty yards to give
Stanford an opportunity to score,
which they took, May making the
touchdown and converting.
Call received, and on the second
play, Lom got away for sixty-five yards
and a touchdown, with Rice convert
ing.
Dowling and Rothert then worked
the ball down for a score, with a pass
or two mixed in. Dowling scored, and
May converted. The next touchdown
was all Laird's. He carried the ball
for the necessary yards, and crawled
over the Cal line to score. The place
kick was wide.
Runback Brings Score
Then Rice added insult to injury
and ran a kick-off for a touchdown, al
though it looked as if he ran outside
of the playing field to do it.
The Cardinal yearlings were not out
fought, and, excepting for the work
of Eisan, Lom, Rice, and Pitto, the
California backfiekl, the game would
have been closer. These men, how
ever, were just too good. Coach Nibs
Price should be glad to see them in a
varsity uniform next year. The Stan
ford line did excellent work, both in
stopping line plays, and in opening
holes. The interference on the end
plays and runs, however, swept the
babe ends off of their feet, and they

were unable to get near enough to the
runner to tackle him.
