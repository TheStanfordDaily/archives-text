# BABE FOOTBALLERS BOW TO BEAR COBS IN HARD CONTEST
## Captain Lee Eisan, Ben Lom Star by Speed, Clever Open Field Work BERKELEY BACKS GOOD Stanford Babes Make More First Downs Than Cal Yearling Eleven

Too much speed and shifty footwork
on the part of Captain Lee Eisan and'
Benny Lom of the California Cubs
spelled defeat to the Stanford fresh
men in the Little Big Game Saturday
at Berkeley. The final score was 44
to 20, due not to any decided superi

their points, Lom, Eisan, or Rice would
garner a touchdown in one or two
plays. Rice ran a kick-off back for a
score, and got California credit for a
touchdown, although he ran out of
bounds on the play.

who converted two touchdowns and
booted a field goal. The Stanford
players looked rather poor on some of
the tackles that they attempted, but
the Cal backs were too good for them.
Many times a redshirted babe laid his
hands on Lom or Eisan only to have
him wriggle free, and run on down
the field. Poor officiating let the Cal
