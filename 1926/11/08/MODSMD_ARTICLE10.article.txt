# "JOHN FERGUSON" POWERFUL DRAMA PLEASES AUDIENCE
## STARK TRAGEDY SHOWN Few Faults Overbalanced by Emotional Excellence; Daves Scores 
### Leonard K. Schwartz 
Intensely dramatic, thoroughly hu
man, startlingly realistic, "John Fer
guson," Sword and Sandals 1926 play,
presented to Stanford playgoers last
Friday evening something decidedly
different from the usual trend of cam
pus performances.
Play Realistic
From the first agreeable sensation
of realism at the raising of the cur
tain on Leslie Kiler's interior a village
hovel in Ireland, to the final drop of
the curtain after Delmer Daves' last
masterful climax with one of the best
pieces of emotional acting we have
ever witnessed on any stage, the per
formance swelled the heart with en
thusiasm. We admit, with the rest of
the audience, that we are enthusiasti
cally proud. There were several rough
spots, one glaringly so, in the inabil
ity of the players to keep certain
names straight, but considering the
complete preparation of the play in
two weeks and the difficulty of the
innovation in the character of the
play, the evening was a triumph.
"John Ferguson," the play, is the
age-old melodramatic plot slightly re
vamped. The mortgaged farm, the
aged and infirm father, the hard-heart
ed landlord, the wronged daughter,
the revengeful brother, and all the
others were very much present; but
the plot was smothered, being merely
a vehicle for the dialogue which was
so really human in its continuous half
repetition, and the admirable perform
ance of the players.
Actors Well Cast
They were all well cast, and they did
not seize the ever-present opportunity
to overact. Helen Cooper had one of
the most difficult roles ever attempted
on the Stanford stage. Her acting was
not only natural, but spirited, her in
terpretation had depth, and she never
lost her character an instant. Ruth
Minskey was the mother from curtain
to curtain. She plead as a mother for
her son, and it was a mother's wails
we heard from her in the last act.
"Jimmie" Caesar, by Howard Wick
ersham, was professionally done. He
made himself look the part, feel the
part, and talk the part. He adopted
certain mannerisms in his interpreta
tion of the character which became
his own. J. Stanley Mullen, a fresh
man, who, with Wickersham, Joseph
Catanich, who played the villain, Miss
Minskey and Miss Cooper, was a new
comer, did remarkably well. He has a
brilliant future for a successful dra
matic career at Stanford.
Cass Versatile
Alonzo Cass was under the handicap
of sort of living down for the evening
his reputation as a campus comedian,
but he slapped back at the laugh greet
ing the audience gave him on his en
trance, making evident his versatility
by very adequately portraying the
half-witted "Clutie" John Macgrath.
John Truman and Rupert Adams were
well picked for the minor parts of
postman and sergeant of police.
There is one more point on which
Gordon Davis deserves special con
gratulation. The play was not just
voice and movement. There was ex
pression! Faces gleamed and con
tracted, eyes spoke, bodies quivered,
actual tears were shed; in short, the
whole was animated! A moving pic
ture camera would have recorded as
complete a performance as a phono
graph, and that is unique for the Stan
ford play.
Audience Misbehaves
The only dark feature of the eve
ning was the audience. They enjoyed
themselves, to be sure, but it seems
a pity someone cannot stand on the
stage and instruct Stanford audiences
when to laugh and when to be still.
They are perhaps to be excused be
cause of the high nervous tension and
mood into which the players worked
them, only to snap them out with a
mixing up of names which reminded
one again it was only a play; it is
evident, however, that, these audiences
need some kind of education.
