With the present Big Game
bonfire under construction, there
is an excellent opportunity for
all fraternity, sorority, and other
campus residences to be cleaned
of all boxes, papers, and trash,
says Fire Marshal R. E. Dugan.
This material that accumulates
about the dwellings creates a dan
gerous fire hazard, Dugan adds,
and he advises that all worthless
inflamable matter be removed
and placed in the alleys and at
the edge of curbs, so that the
freshmen may have easy access
to it with their wagons.
