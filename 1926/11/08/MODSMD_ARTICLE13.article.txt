# SENIORS EMERGE AS CHAMPIONS IN CLASS FOOTBALL CONTESTS
## 1927 Men Defeat Freshmen; Third-Year Team Downed By Sophomores 
### 
I3y virtue of the unexpected 12 to 0
I defeat handed the juniors by the
' sophomores and the 28 to Oi win of the
| seniors over the freshmen in games
last Friday afternoon, the last-year
men finished the interclass football
schedule in the top position and were
given the championship and five points
toward the final rating.
The seniors have not been defeated
in three starts, having one tie game
with the juniors, and two wins.
1920 Second
â€¢ The sophomores took second place
with two wins and one defeat; the
juniors went down to third position
, with a win, a tie game, and one loss;
1 and the frosh remained lowly with no
wins and three defeats.
It was the junior-sophmore game on
the freshman field last Friday that
carried the surprise of the afternoon.
Ragged football and careless playing
i in the backfield by the third-year men
j cost them what should have been a
decisive win in their favor. In the first
quarter, by a series of line bucks and
long passes, they carried the ball to
the six-inch line, took it over for a
| touchdown, but fumbled before the
; whistle blew. A vigilant soph picked
the ball up and ran it back to his own
40-yard line before he was caught from
1 behind and downed.
Juniors Lose Power
This unexpected setback completely
; destroyed the power of the junior
team, and Colin, Smalling, and Skelton
of the sophs almost at will carried the
ball through on passes, bucks, and end
runs to their two touchdowns.
Ferguson and Jayred on the senior
team had little trouble in making four
I touchdowns against the frosh, being
I able to romp through the opposing line
almost at will for ten and fifteen yard
gains, while Jayred made a touchdown
after catching a punt and running
seventy yards behind excellent inter-
I ference.
