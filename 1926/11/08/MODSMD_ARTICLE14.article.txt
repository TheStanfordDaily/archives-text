Greek athletes twenty-five hundred
years ago had to take a solemn oath
on the altar of the gods that they
would "keep training" and obey the
"conference rules" before they could
enter the Olympic games.
"Hot Time in Old Town"
Tho return of a successful athlete
to his home town was the signal for
a general celebration that pales by
comparison the wildest "pep sessions"
of today. Enthusiasm ran so high that
it was quite customary to tear down a
portion of the city's wall to make room
for the festivities. The celebrating
crowds sang, danced, are believed to
have drunk intoxicating liquor, and
often ended by giving the Olympic
victor a free meal tic ket for life.
Games Were Religious Festivals
"The Olympic games must be pri
l marily considered as being religious
; festivals," says Prof. 11. 11. Fairclough.
J professor of classical literature. "The
city states from all Greece sent their
best representatives and victory was
upposed to bring the approval of the
gods to the town."
A committee of priests was in
charge of the games and made all tlie
rules which in time became traditional

las the Olympics wero kept up for
nearly a thousand years. Only pure
blooded Hellenes were allowed to com
pete and the winners were considered
the best national types. The priests
acted as central "conference" officials
and promoted good feeling among the
'< towns.
Hard Time for Rooters
j Travel was too expensive and diffi
! cult for "rooters" to accompany the
town squads to Olympia but hundreds
of spectators came to the games from
; the surrounding districts and often the
high officials of various of the cities
1 who improved the occasion with infor
! mal political fraternizing. The ath
letes came some time beforehand and
each was assigned training quarters
where he could freshen up after the
long trip. Each had to take an oath
to train and compete fairly, and as
the common people still believed in
the ancient and all-seeing gods, the
games were good exhibitions of sports
! manship.
All wars in progress at the season
of the games were called oil and
armies would even do such things
as leave their camps, take in the
games and attendant religious cere
monies, and then go back to fight.
