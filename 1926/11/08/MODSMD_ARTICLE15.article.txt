# SECOND, THIRD SIRING PLAYERS RUN WILD; DOWN SANTA CLARA
## Santa Clara Scoreless at Half And Totals Only Four First Downs HEAVY SCORING EARLY Hoffman Put Into Contest In Final Period, Only Regular in Game 
### Jim Adams 
Although Warner kept his regulars
on the hench the entire contest the
Stanford varsity reserves were suffi
j ciently powerful Saturday to run wild
j over the Santa Clara Broncs for a
; 33-14 victory. About 20,000 people
! watched this conglomeration of sec
ond, third, fourth, and fifth string
players triumph over the Mission team
without the aid of the regulars except
Hoffman who replaced Patchett when
the latter was injured in the fourth
quarter.
Cards Start Strong
The Cards ran up their score in the
! first half and held Walsh's men score
less for the same period. Santa Clara
did not make a first down until late
in the third quarter and only totalled
four in the whole game to Stanford's
twenty. The Bronc-s scored both their
touchdowns in the fourth quarter.
The third-string halfback combina
tion, Sims and Wilton, who were, the
best ground-gainers of the contest,
j started things off with a bang. The
I first score came on the fourth play of
j the game after the Cards had received
the kickoff and Wilton had run the
ball back to the 40-yard line. Wilton
and Patchett advanced the ball to the
50-yard line. On a double reserve Sims
; took the ball and raced around left end
| to break in the open and sprint half
j the length of the field for a touchdown.
Lewis mishandled the ball and Wilton
; did not convert.
Wilton Shifty
About four minutes later Wilton,
who is about as shifty as Dick Hyland
and as hard to tackle, broke away from
the 18-yard line and wormed his way
I to the goal line. This time he con
verted. The Cards got into Santa
Clara's territory when Sellman blocked
| Casanova's punt and Freeman recov
• ered. These two tackles proved them
