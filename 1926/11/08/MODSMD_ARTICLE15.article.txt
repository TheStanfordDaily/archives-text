# SECOND, THIRD SIRING PLAYERS RUN WILD; DOWN SANTA CLARA
## Santa Clara Scoreless at Half And Totals Only Four First Downs HEAVY SCORING EARLY Hoffman Put Into Contest In Final Period, Only Regular in Game 
### Jim Adams 
Although Warner kept his regulars
on the hench the entire contest the
Stanford varsity reserves were suffi
j ciently powerful Saturday to run wild
j over the Santa Clara Broncs for a
; 33-14 victory. About 20,000 people
! watched this conglomeration of sec
ond, third, fourth, and fifth string
players triumph over the Mission team
without the aid of the regulars except
Hoffman who replaced Patchett when
the latter was injured in the fourth
quarter.
Cards Start Strong
The Cards ran up their score in the
! first half and held Walsh's men score
less for the same period. Santa Clara
did not make a first down until late
in the third quarter and only totalled
four in the whole game to Stanford's
twenty. The Bronc-s scored both their
touchdowns in the fourth quarter.
The third-string halfback combina
tion, Sims and Wilton, who were, the
best ground-gainers of the contest,
j started things off with a bang. The
I first score came on the fourth play of
j the game after the Cards had received
the kickoff and Wilton had run the
ball back to the 40-yard line. Wilton
and Patchett advanced the ball to the
50-yard line. On a double reserve Sims
; took the ball and raced around left end
| to break in the open and sprint half
j the length of the field for a touchdown.
Lewis mishandled the ball and Wilton
; did not convert.
Wilton Shifty
About four minutes later Wilton,
who is about as shifty as Dick Hyland
and as hard to tackle, broke away from
the 18-yard line and wormed his way
I to the goal line. This time he con
verted. The Cards got into Santa
Clara's territory when Sellman blocked
| Casanova's punt and Freeman recov
• ered. These two tackles proved them
selves tough customers for the Broncs
and stopped nearly everything that
came their way.
Patchett scored the next touchdown
from the 5-yard line after Lewis had
intercepted a Santa Clara pass on
their 55-yard line. Sims slipped around
left end for fifteen yards and Wilton
and Patchett helped put the latter in
a position to score. Wilton converted.
After this clever duo of sophomore
backs had avanced the ball to the 8-
yard line early in the second quarter
Warner thought they had done enough
and sent in Work and Leistner, fourth
string backs. Patchett failed to gain
through the line and Leistner took
the ball around left end for the re
maining distance. Lewis converted.
All Card Backs Score
Lewis got a touchdown after takirc
a pass from Patchett just as the gun
popped for half time. Thus each of
the backfield that started- got their
share of touchdowns to make their day
a success. Work failed to convert.
Graves and Trombetta, fifth-string
backs, were sent in to relieve Work
and Leistner in the third quarter.
Santa Clara got their first score as
the fourth period opened, when Mil
lage fumbled one of Casanova's long
punts and Williams recovered for the
Broncs on the Cards' 30-yard line. The
Mission team advanced by line bucks
and a 10-yard pass to the 5-yard line
where on a clever, deceptive fake drop
kick Connolly passed to Casanova over
the goal line.
Late In the last period Santa Clara
made their prettiest play of the game.
With the ball on their own 26-yard
line, a nicely executed pass, Casanova
to Fawley, put the latter in the clear
and he raced 60 yards to a touchdown,
Tlk l Broncs converted on both their
tor lidowns and managed to get a lit
tle satisfaction with their 14 score for
the afternoon's tilt.
Lewis Shows Class
The Stanford play was featured by
the performance of Sims and Wilton,
who were closely followed by Lewis at
quarter. The last-named ran the team
in a very capable manner, and Post
or Millage will have to bo on the jump
to keep ahead of this promising sopho
more. Millage replaced him in the
third quarter when Lowis was hurt.
Hoffman was the only regular used
who started the U.S.C. game the pre
ceding week.
The two regular tackles, Poulson
and Harris, may find their positions
occupied by Sellman and Freeman if
the latter duo koop improving as they
have been. Harder, Davidson, and
Price did some nico work at ond. The
latter snagged a number of difficult

passes, although he dropped an equal
I number more from hard luck than
) 1 anything else.
Casanova Punts Well
i Casanova's punts were consistently
t good and he bore out his reputation of
being one of the best kickers on the J
j coast. However, Biff Hoffman booted j
j a couple himself that averaged about ]
!! 50 yards, which is an encouraging
I feat, as this is the one department in
i which the Cards have beeu weak in
, all year.
. | Warner showed little but straight
; j football, and by keeping his regulars
- on the bench prevented any injuries
• to them that would handicap the Cardi
i nals against Washington next Satur
day. The reserves' decisive defeat of
II Santa Clara takes some of the glory
; from the Trojans' 42-0 triumph over
- 1 the Broncs earlier in the season. If
the Mission team appeared as power
less against them as they did against
r the Stanford subs, U.S.C. should have
run up a larger score.
: I Captain Casanova and Connolly were
• the outstanding players in the Santa
'' Clara backfield and Chisholm, after a
' late start, played well in the line.
