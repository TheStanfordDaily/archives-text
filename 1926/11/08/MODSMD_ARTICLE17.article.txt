# CLASS OF 1930 LAYS PLANS FOR LARGEST BONFIRE IN HISTORY
## Foundation Plans Call for Structure 35x45 Feet; To Rise 70 Feet 
### 
Continuing the work started Wed
nesday afternoon, the freshmen took a
few more steps Thursday and Friday
afternoon in their foundation plans for
the Big Game bonfire. Saturday morn
ing a large crowd of freshmen turned
out and the wood-hauling started. The
freshmen are out for "the biggest and
best bonfire ever," according to Ken
Milligan, chairman of the committee.
The plans call for a structure of 35x45
feet and a total height of 70 feet.
Work Timed
The head contractors are Nason Hall
and George Thompson. The chairman
of the time-keeping committee is Tom
Murphy. According to Murphy some
dire punishment is in vogue for any
freshman who does not put in his fif
teen hours of work and eight hours
of guarding. The full amount of time
must either be spent on the pyre-build
ing and guarding or at work at the
Convalescent Home chopping wood.
The telephone company is putting
up the corner poles for the structure
and arrangements are being made with
the Peninsula Railroad Company for a
thousand ties.
Guard duty will start as soon as the
bonfire takes on some proportions so
that no premature cremation will take
place like last year.
Foundation Ready
The committee expects that rapid
strides will be made this week gather
ing faggots as the foundation is ready.
Large poles will be nailed between the
corner posts, forming a large basket
into which everything burnable and
some things unburnable will be
dumped. Thirty men will be worked
with each wagon. The wagons are
being furnished by the corporation
yard, and tours will be made of the
campus and Palo Alto. The people of
Palo Alto 'are co-operating very well,
according to the committee, and vari
ous promises have been taken up for
wood.
The complete bonfire committee is
as follows: Kenneth Milligan, chair
man; Nason Hall and Fred Olsen, as
sistants; George Thompson, head of
the construction; Tom Murphy, head
timekeeper; Chester Hadenfelt, head
of the collection committee; Edward
R. Valentine, captain of the guards.
The rest of the committee is Tioto
Bianclii, Gabriel Bisceglia, John Gray,
Robert Clarke, Merle Emery, John
Paul Jones, Harold M. Horn, Edwin
Crebs, Peter Sylvester, and James M.
Springer.
