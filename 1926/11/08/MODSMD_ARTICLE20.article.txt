President Angell of Yale has said that "the American boy lags a year
or two behind his British cousin in his educational progress because of
too little acquaintance with really hard work, too long and possibly too
many vacations devoid of study, poorly organized programs of study,"
and so on.
This statement seems somewhat contradictory in its implication of
British educational methods. As far as Cambridge and Oxford are con
cerned it is just the lack of that highly organized program of study, which
the Yale head evidently desires, that produces the recognized British
superiority in educational methods.
This freedom from the organization of study produces hard work in
some and little work in others. Freedom of study rather than the or
ganization of study is the secret of the British system. Moreover, hard
work may be forced on students by programs from without, but the only
hard work by the student that counts in his education is the hard work
that is inspired from within.
