Upon the recommendation of its department of psychology, Temple
University has abandoned all examinations upon the ground that they
are antiquated, inaccurate, and count the personal equation too heavily.
While the idea itself is far from novel, Temple is one of the first institu
tions of higher learning to apply it in practice.
This action will not work equitably in large classes of courses con
ducted by lecture. In such cases there is practically no feasible method
of determining the standard of work performed by the students other
than by examinations. It is an impossibility for a professor who instructs
a hundred undergraduates to know their accomplishments.
In courses composed solely of recitations the plan has a distinct
advantage. Study accomplished day by day alone is indicative of an
individual's true worth. This alone brings lasting knowledge which no
amount of hasty cramming of essentials can secure. Information rapidly
gained is apt to be eradicated with the passing of an examination and
counts for but little in the true education of a student. Continued and
sustained effort is of far more value than concentrated memorizing.
