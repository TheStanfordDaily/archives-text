In the space below, which is dedi
cated to the expression of public opin
ion, one may read the warning
of Mrs. Louise James, Director of the
Medical Temperance Department of
the Palo Alto branch of the Women's
Christian Temperance Union.
This is from the pamphlets to which
Mrs. James refers in her letters. Read
it. It's too good to miss.
"I know of the case of a minister's
child, with other girls expelled from
college for wild nocturnal freaks that
attracted the attention of all the fac
ulty. When the case was investigated
it was found that the girls who could
not go to the soda fountains regularly
bought the Coca-Cola syrup in bottles
and drank it until their eyes looked
wild."
This information was contributed by
an anonymous character described
Vaguely in the pamphlet as "one of

the best men of the South." Always
responsive to the dictates of propriety,
we have omitted the details which this
Flower of Dixie relates before telling
us that the girls were "all expelled,
and college and families were disgraced
—all due to Coca-Cola."
♦ * *
There is no particular point to be
gained in commenting on Mrs. James
and her work. It would not be gentle
manly to call her names, and it is a
debatable matter that any thrust more
subtle than an epithet would strike
home.
The irony of it all lies in the fact
that some day Mrs. James and her
co-workers will probably pass a law
against drinking Coca-Cola, and our
younger generation, now satislied with
this light and harmless beverage, will
be driven to the extreme of guzzling
the nerve-shattering sarsaparilla!
