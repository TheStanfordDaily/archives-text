# BOTANY PROFESSOR BELIEVES PALO ALTO TREE WILL DIE SOON

"I still believe that the Palo Alto
tree will die within a very few years,"
reiterated George J. Peirce, professor
of botany and plant physiology, when
! questioned recently as to the probable
future of the old landmark. Professor
Peirce, who two years ago predicted
the death within ten years of the five
century-old redwood which has figured
so prominently in the early history of
this region, said, "My conviction was
so strong that I advised the University
a number of years ago to plant some
young redwoods to take its place."
"One of the group of six young
redwoods in front of the physics build-
ing will ultimately become the 'Palo
Alto' tree," continued Professor Peirce,
saying that these young trees have
been planted about ten years and that
the tallest and strongest one of them
will finally be chosen by the Uni
! versity to replace the nationally-known
| tree when it dies.
Appearing on the University seal
and located by the railroad bridge
at San Francisquito creek where it
may be easily seen from the highway
and the trains, the old redwood is
known to every Stanford student and
alumnus.
.
Location Unfavorable
Its location is what is proving fatal
| to the old tree, in the opinion of Pro
fessor Peirce. The soot and sulphur
fumes from passing trains, which de
stroy the leaves, together with the
| concrete wall separating it from what
little water there is in the creek, are
what make its death inevitable, he
says.
The heavy concrete wall which sep
arates the tree from the creek pre
vents it from getting enough water
and also curtails its roots. Many relief
measures have been tried to preserve
the big redwood, but all so far have
j failed.
Tree Has History
A landmark in the days of the
earliest Spanish explorations, between
1769 and 1776, the old tree can safely
be estimated to have been a sturdy
sapling in the days when Columbus
discovered America. It is now over
150 feet high and about twenty-three
feet in circumference.
Despairing of saving it, the Native
Sons of Palo Alto, which town, by the
way, is named after the tree, have
finally decided to commemorate it by
a bronze tablet. This tablet was
laid in a nearby boulder and was
I dedicated Sunday afternoon, Novem
ber 7, with a parade culminating in
a series of dedication addresses under
the tree and in the laying of the
plate, which will contain an inscrip
tion recalling the great redwood's past
significance.
