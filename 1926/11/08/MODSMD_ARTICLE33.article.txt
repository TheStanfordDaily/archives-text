# WASHINGTON VARSITIES MAKE GOOD SHOWINGS IN SATURDAY'S GAMES
## California Loses Fifth Game, St. Mary's-Gonaga Tie, Broncos Defeated 
### George W. Story 
Both of the State of Washington's
representatives in the Pacific Coast
Conference football race turned in vic
tories Saturday afternoon in the only
two conference games of the day. The
University of Washington beat Cali
fornia 13 to 7 and Washington State
College won from Idaho by a 6 to 0
margin.
The other two games played on
coast gridirons saw Stanford drubbing
Santa Clara 33 to 14 and Gonzaga
holding St. Mary's to a scoreless tie at
Spokane.
Washington and W.S.C. each turned
in its third conference victory and
they are now tied for third place in
the standings. California lost its fifth
straight game and Idaho dropped its
third conference contest.
Field goals determined both confer
ence battles, Butch Meeker booting
two against Idaho to give the Cougars
a victory, and Gene Cook thumping
the pigskin between the uprights on
two occasions to give the Huskies
enough points to down the Golden
Bear.
Huskies May Be Dangerous
The Huskies' showing against the
Bruins was nothing to indicate that
they are going to interfere with Stan
ford's march to the championship, but
reports from the North stated that
California played much better football
than it has in the games it has played
in its stadium this year.
George Guttormeson, the captain
and quarterback of the Huskies, played
his usual good game against the Bears
and it was mainly due to his efforts
the Northerners were able to win. He
performed in the same manner he did
last season, when he was named All-
Coast quarterback on Pop Warner's
team.
The W.S.C.-Idalio game was close
and hard-fought, although the Cougars
outplayed the Vandals most of the
afternoon. The hard game Idaho
played against the Oregon Aggies last
week while Washington State was
resting told on the Vandal gridmen.
Hoffman Only First-Stringer in Game
Biff Hoffman was the only first
string player to participate in Stan
ford's victory over the Broncos. The
regulars got a rest and should be ready
for the Husky invasion next Saturday.
While the varsity was watching the
game the second- and third-team play
ers were making a good showing
against Santa Clara and showed that
Stanford undoubtedly has the finest
reserve strength in the conference.
The St. Mary's attack was stopped
five times within the Gonzaga 10-yard
line and the result was a no-score
game. The Bulldogs did not endanger
the Saints' goal line at all but their
defensive strength was enough to halt
the fast-running backs from Oakland.
This week's games will be the de
termining factors in the conference
race. U.S.C. plays the Oregon Aggies
at Portland Thursday and then Satur
day Washington plays Stanford here.
Oregon meets Washington State at
Pullman. Nevada invades the home of
the Golden Bear and Montana enter-,
tains Whitman at Missoula.

representatives in the Pacific Coast
Conference football race turned in vic
tories Saturday afternoon in the only
two conference games of the day. The
University of Washington beat Cali
fornia 13 to 7 and Washington State
College won from Idaho by a 6 to 0
margin.
The other two games played on
coast gridirons saw Stanford drubbing
Santa Clara 33 to 14 and Gonzaga
holding St. Mary's to a scoreless tie at
Spokane.
Washington and W.S.C. each turned
in its third conference victory and
they are now tied for third place in
the standings. California lost its fifth
straight game and Idaho dropped its
third conference contest.
Field goals determined both confer
ence battles, Butch Meeker booting
two against Idaho to give the Cougars
a victory, and Gene Cook thumping
the pigskin between the uprights on
two occasions to give the Huskies
enough points to down the Golden
Bear.
Huskies May Be Dangerous
The Huskies' showing against the
Bruins was nothing to indicate that
they are going to interfere with Stan
ford's march to the championship, but
reports from the North stated that
California played much better football
than it has in the games it has played
in its stadium this year.
George Guttormeson, the captain
and quarterback of the Huskies, played
his usual good game against the Bears
and it was mainly due to his efforts
the Northerners were able to win. He
performed in the same manner he did
last season, when he was named All-
Coast quarterback on Pop Warner's
team.
The W.S.C.-Idalio game was close
and hard-fought, although the Cougars
outplayed the Vandals most of the
afternoon. The hard game Idaho
played against the Oregon Aggies last
week while Washington State was
resting told on the Vandal gridmen.
Hoffman Only First-Stringer in Game
Biff Hoffman was the only first
string player to participate in Stan
ford's victory over the Broncos. The
regulars got a rest and should be ready
for the Husky invasion next Saturday.
While the varsity was watching the
game the second- and third-team play
ers were making a good showing
against Santa Clara and showed that
Stanford undoubtedly has the finest
reserve strength in the conference.
The St. Mary's attack was stopped
five times within the Gonzaga 10-yard
line and the result was a no-score
game. The Bulldogs did not endanger
the Saints' goal line at all but their
defensive strength was enough to halt
the fast-running backs from Oakland.
This week's games will be the de
termining factors in the conference
race. U.S.C. plays the Oregon Aggies
at Portland Thursday and then Satur
day Washington plays Stanford here.
Oregon meets Washington State at
Pullman. Nevada invades the home of
the Golden Bear and Montana enter-,
tains Whitman at Missoula.
