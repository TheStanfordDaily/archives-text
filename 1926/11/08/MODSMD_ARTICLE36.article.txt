# SAN FRANCISCO UNION PROBLEM IS SUBJECT FOR VARSITY DEBATE
## Cavelero, Craven, Truman to Represent Stanford in Forensic Clash 
### 
Stanford debaters will clash with
California Tuesday, November 23, in
San Francisco on the question, "Re
solved, that the American plan should
prevail in San Francisco." On account
of several conflicts, this date is not yet
absolutely definite.
Split teams are participating in the
debate. That is, Stanford will have
two men upholding the affirmative and
one the negative, and California will
have the opposite. Philip Cavelero and
C. Craven Scott will take the affirma
tive, and John Truman will speak for
thQ negative.
The American plan is construed to
mean the open shop in industry as op
posed to trade unionism. Because of
the recent trouble in San Francisco
over the labor situation, there was
some fear of violence at the debate.
For this reason the officials have guar
anteed to provide ample protection
during the evening.
The Stanford men have made a
thorough study of conditions in San
Francisco, making two trips a week to
become entirely acquainted with the
situation at first haiyJ. They have put
themselves in touch with all interested
parties.
Scott and Cavelero spoke for the
negative in the Marquette debate last
year. Cavelero was a member of the
team that went to Utah last year for
the series of debates held in that state.
Scott also participated in the Cali
fornia debate last year, upholding the
negative. In both the Marquette and
California debate, the audience de
cision was in favor of the negative, the
side taken by the Stanford debaters in
each case.
Cavelero's strength in debating lies
in his ability as an orator, whereas
Scott excels in his forcefulness and
directness. Truman is characterized
by his keen, clear thinking backed by
an ever ready sense of humor. Tru
man's experience has been confined to
high school work.
