# "DEATH RAY" THEORY EXPLODED IN LECTURE BY PROFESSOR RYAN
## Opportunity for Freshmen To Visit Laboratory Next Monday 
### 
Exploding the much-talked-of "death
ray" theory, Harris J. Ryan, professor
of electrical engineering, in a talk be
fore a group of freshmen last night in
the Encina lobby, said that it had only
accomplished a production system for
oscillation, and a poor one at that.
Professor Ryan pointed out the ab
surdity of the press stories at the
time and how at one time after he had
made a speech to a convention of elec
trical engineers in which he brought
out the findings of one of his recent
experiments, the press had printed a
story after he had told them it was
an impossible presumption.
Communication and how important
its rapidity is to the world was par
ticularly stressed. The example was
the battle of New Orleans in which
hundreds of men were killed and
wounded after peace had been signed
over a month. Professor Ryan recently
received a letter from the manager of
the Bell Telephone Company which
shows to what extent rapid communi
cation has gone. The manager is now
on his way to London to tike steps to
establish a radio-telephone exchange
between London and New York. This
system will be in operation in 1927.
During the World War, Professor
Ryan was in charge of a supersonatic
laboratory in Pasadena and he told of
his discoveries in how experiments
were taken to rid the seas of the
German submarines. The system used
was by the transmission of sound
waves under water, and the projection
of radio beams.
An opportunity for freshmen to visit
the high voltage laboratory, of which
Professor Ryan is the director, was
extended by him, and the date set
was Monday afternoon, November 15,
at 1:15, and again at 4:15. About 300
students may be accommodated at one
time in the gallery of the laboratory.
The experiment to be shown will be
what takes place when high tension
voltage is transmitted by experimental
methods.
The power industry offers a great
deal to everyone and is is a large
problem in the West as over 60 per
cent of the power available in the
country is in the Pacific Coast States
plus Idaho and Montana.
Aftffr his talk was finished Professor
Ryan answered questions for the
group which dealt principally on high
voltage transmission. The cathode ray
and cathode tube were also discussed.
The meeting was one of the regular
Sunday after dinner discussions spon
sored by the Y.M.C.A., with Wallace
Cathcart acting as chairman.
