# HOWELL SAYS JOURNALIST NEEDS COLLEGE TRAINING
## 
### 
"College is the finest training for
anyone who wishes to reach the top
of the field of journalism," said Ches
ter H. Rowell, newspaper writer and
student of world affairs, Friday night
at the banquet of the fourth annual
convention of the California Scholastic
Press Association. Rowell is a regent
of the University of California, active
columnist in many papers, and an ob
server of international events.

Rowell advised the high school stu
dents to continue their education
through college, declaring that the
training in history, economics, interna
tional politics, languages, law, and
sciences would be invaluable to them
and would aid them in reaching the
top of the profession. He said that al
though a person with a high school
education could write ordinary nows
stories, journalism today has become
a profession, international in scope
and intellectual in character, and re
quires men with a knowledge of world
affairs.
The idea that the whole of news-

I paper training could be learned in
mere routine of reporting is wrong,
stated Rowell. A man who enters the
newspaper field after graduating from
high school may rank higher than the
! college graduate after five years, and
even ten years, but the college man
will be at the head in fifteen or twenty
years, for he will have the knowledge
j and training that is necessary to in
telligently cover such events as the
League o'f Nations Assembly or the
Supreme Court.

Rowell declared that newspaper
work has a place for reporters trained
in law, in chemistry, or any profes
sional field. It requires as much pains
taking attention and study as is given
to such professions as law and medi
cine, and should be regarded as a pro
fession, rather than a business.
He stressed the value of training in
journalism for those who don't expect
to enter newspaper work. "There is
always a place in some other field for
the man properly trained in journal
ism," he said.
