# W.D.ALLEN, ORGANIST, ARGIEWICZ, VIOLINIST, IN SUNDAY'S RECITAL

### Frank Mittauer 
Johann Sebastian Bach's Adiago
from the Fifth Violin Sonata, together
with the Funeral March and Seraphic
Chant of Alexander Guilmant, featured
yesterday's organ recital given by
Warren I). Allen, University roganist,
and Artur Argiewicz, violinist, of San
Francisco and former assistant con
cert master of the Symphony Orches
tra under Hertz.
The Bach number showed fully that
great musician's mastery of composi
tion, contrasting the clear notes of
the violin against the richer back
ground of the tones from the organ at
times and at times having both in
struments follow the same theme. Both
artists gave u. noteworthy interpreta
tion of the composition.
Guilmant's Funeral March .written by
the noted French organist in honor
of his mother, was the other outstand
ing part of the recital. Starting with
a powerful march theme developed in
some detail, the composition rather
suddenly changes to the Chant which
constitutes its final section. The effect
of the two themes coming so close to
each other is striking in the extreme.
"Menuett in D," by Porpora-Kreis
ler, and "Lonely Wanderer," a com
position of Grieg, both given by the
organ and violin, are worthy of spe
cial mention, the former for its melody
and rhythm, the latter for its treat
ment of the rather pathetic theme
without recourse to doleful minors.
