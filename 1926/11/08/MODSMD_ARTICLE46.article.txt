# CARD GOOFS DEFEATED BY BERKELEY PASSING OFFENSIVE, 20 TO 6
## Jim Dixon, Former Varsity Star, Is Responsible For Bear Victory 
### Bob Sears 
Offering stiff opposition to the Cali
fornia reserves in both offensive and
defensive departments of play, but be
wildered by a passing attack of which
Jimmie Dixon, former Hear halfback,
was the main cog, Coach Hal Davis'
Stanford Grays went down to defeat
before the Berkeley eleven Saturday,
20 to 6.
Dixon Defeats Cards
Without Dixon opposing them the
Grays probably would have won, but
the passing and kicking of the three
year California varsity player was too
much for the Stanford men, and all
three California scores came as a re
sult of this successfully executed
aerial attack. Dixon has already played
his three years of varsity football, and
although there is no rule governing
the eligibility of goof players, the in
jection of a three-year varsity letter
man into the game was an act for
which the Stanford men were wholly
unprepared.
No scoring was done in the first
half, and Stanford had the ball in
California's territory most of the time.
Davis' men displayed a strong defense
against line plays, and were more
successful in advancing the ball than
were the Bear Grays. In the second
lialf, though, long passes by Dixon
from a spread formation-found Stan
ford unable to cope with the attack,
and three touchdowns were made in
the last two periods.
Grays Play Good Ball
Stanford's lone score came in the
third quarter when Montgomery re
covered a California fumble and ran
f>() yards to a touchdown. Davis used
twenty-five men in the game, giving
the majority of his squad a chance to
play, and all played good football. It
was merely a case of too much Jimmie
Dixon.
Stein and Reynolds at the two tackle
positions were the outstanding men
on (he Stanford eleven, both playing
heady football and being the only
players whom Davis kept in the fray
the entire four quarters. Reese did
good work, while Burton, at fullback,
and Soberer, who replaced him, are
deserving of credit.
Saturday's game did not mark the
close of the Grays' season as the team
will continue to scrimmage the varsity
until after the Big Game. One more
game may be played, a preliminary to
the Varsity-Washington game this Sat
urday, but no opponent has been se
cured as yet.
