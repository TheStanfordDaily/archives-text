# FORWARD PASS ARTISTS

. The "old army game" is all right in
its place, and a "navy game" comes
in handy on a day when the gridiron
is flooded, but the "air game" is the
thing today, and "Get off the earth
—if you want to score," the modern
order of things. Footballs have been
thrown forward legally now for a
score of years, but never before has
the passing attack been as prominent
as it was in 1925; and this season, in
spite of the new rule to curb the wild
and reckless heaving of long shots
that were tending to make the game a
farce, the forward pass should be as
prominent a factor as ever in the sea
son that is now under way.
There is, of course, a lot of argu
ment as to how far a football has

been successfully thrown in a game,
and there is just as much debate over
who is the greatest passer of all time ;
as to who is the greatest kicker,
broken-field runner, line-bucker, and
bo forth. It is certain, however, that j
few men could pass as far as the
mighty "Brick" Muller, ail-American
end in 1921 and 1922, and, according to
the record book, his pass in the Cali- 1
fornia-Ohio State game on New Year's 1
Day, 1921, traveled seventy yards, !
topping those of LeGendre, of Tulane, ;
and Gillis, of Alabama, both of which
sailed sixty-five yards.

In Spaulfiing's 1926 Football Guide,
the pass made by Grant Gillis in the
Alabama-Washington game last New
Year's Day, is credited to' "Pooley"
Hubert. Several sports writers got
mixed up on that at the time, too.
Gillis threw the pass to Johnny Mack
Brown and the distance was given as
anywhere from fifty to sixty-five yards.
In "Champ" Pickens' interesting book
let about that game called "The Will
to Win," it is declared that Gillis' pass
was "the longest ever thrown," but
Muller's must have been longer, as it
was thrown on a diagonal from about

i twenty yards out from the side of the
| field on California's forty-five-yard line,
j to Prodie Stephens, who caught it in
j the corner of the field on the goal line.
Anyway, I saw "Brick's" heave, and I
vote for it as being a wonder.
Bennie Friedman, of Michigan, and
; "Swede" Oberlander, of Dartmouth,
were two of the most famous passers
of recent years, and it is a pity that
they couldn't have met in a game.
Friedman is busy throwing them again
:at Ann Arbor this season, and
"Mickey" Dooley is back again at
Dartmouth to carry on where ho left
off in 1924. Friedman is down in the
record books with a heave of forty
yards last year, Oberlander with one
of forty-five, while Dooley threw the
I oval fifty yards in 1924.
Other famous passers were Dorais,
Gipp, and Mohardt, of Notre Dame;
and the mighty Red Roberts, of Cen
! tre College.

I oval fifty yards in 1924.
Other famous passers were Dorais,
Gipp, and Mohardt, of Notre Dame;
and the mighty Red Roberts, of Cen
! tre College.

. The "old army game" is all right in
its place, and a "navy game" comes
in handy on a day when the gridiron
is flooded, but the "air game" is the
thing today, and "Get off the earth
—if you want to score," the modern
order of things. Footballs have been
thrown forward legally now for a
score of years, but never before has
the passing attack been as prominent
as it was in 1925; and this season, in
spite of the new rule to curb the wild
and reckless heaving of long shots
that were tending to make the game a
farce, the forward pass should be as
prominent a factor as ever in the sea
son that is now under way.
There is, of course, a lot of argu
ment as to how far a football has

been successfully thrown in a game,
and there is just as much debate over
who is the greatest passer of all time ;
as to who is the greatest kicker,
broken-field runner, line-bucker, and
bo forth. It is certain, however, that j
few men could pass as far as the
mighty "Brick" Muller, ail-American
end in 1921 and 1922, and, according to
the record book, his pass in the Cali- 1
fornia-Ohio State game on New Year's 1
Day, 1921, traveled seventy yards, !
topping those of LeGendre, of Tulane, ;
and Gillis, of Alabama, both of which
sailed sixty-five yards.

In Spaulfiing's 1926 Football Guide,
the pass made by Grant Gillis in the
Alabama-Washington game last New
Year's Day, is credited to' "Pooley"
Hubert. Several sports writers got
mixed up on that at the time, too.
Gillis threw the pass to Johnny Mack
Brown and the distance was given as
anywhere from fifty to sixty-five yards.
In "Champ" Pickens' interesting book
let about that game called "The Will
to Win," it is declared that Gillis' pass
was "the longest ever thrown," but
Muller's must have been longer, as it
was thrown on a diagonal from about

i twenty yards out from the side of the
| field on California's forty-five-yard line,
j to Prodie Stephens, who caught it in
j the corner of the field on the goal line.
Anyway, I saw "Brick's" heave, and I
vote for it as being a wonder.
Bennie Friedman, of Michigan, and
; "Swede" Oberlander, of Dartmouth,
were two of the most famous passers
of recent years, and it is a pity that
they couldn't have met in a game.
Friedman is busy throwing them again
:at Ann Arbor this season, and
"Mickey" Dooley is back again at
Dartmouth to carry on where ho left
off in 1924. Friedman is down in the
record books with a heave of forty
yards last year, Oberlander with one
of forty-five, while Dooley threw the
I oval fifty yards in 1924.
