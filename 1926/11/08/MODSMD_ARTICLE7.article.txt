# BARE SOCCER TEAM LOSES TO CUBS IN LAST-MINUTE RUSH
## Prospects Bright for Next Game, Says Maloney; Teamwork Needed 
### 
California's babe soccer team took
the first fracas of a two-game series
Saturday on the Berkeley campus
when the Card yearling kickers drop
ped an "anybody's" affair in the clos
ing minutes of a 4 to 3 contest.
Prospects Good
With the return game set for Sat
urday morning at Stanford, the Babes
face good prospects for bringing the
series to a tie, in the estimation of
Coach Harry Maloney, Card mentor,
who feels that in their defeat the 1930
kickers did not function as well in a
unit as they are capable.
Despite the handicap of the soft turf
to which they were unaccustomed, the
Cards broke loose to an early lead
when Leslie turned in some good for
ward work at inside right, scoring the
first goal of the game. Stanford re
mained in the lead throughout the first
period.
Cubs Overcome Lead
The Cubs took matters into their
own hands at the opening of the sec
ond half, and by dint of superior team
work and steadier footing upon the
slippery greensward, managed to tally
twice before Captain Smith, playing
a spectacular game at center forward
for the Redshirts, again brought his
team to the fore by twice smashing
free kicks from California territory
into the net.
The California frosh again took
charge of the situation to tie the score
on one goal and to win the contest on
a subsequent goal that beat the final
gun by minutes.
The Stanford varsity players, who
are slated to clash with the Bears in
their first game of the series Thurs
day morning, Armistice Day, wer? in
active over the week-end. Coach Ma
loney will put his two squads through
stiff workouts this week, starting with
a varsity scrimmage this afternoon, in
an effort to brush both outfits into
their best form for California compe
tition.
