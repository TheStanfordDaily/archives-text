Pioneers
They are pioneers as surely as the men who blazed trees.
They have struck trails to new comforts for you to enjoy.
Ahead, they turn, cry out the news, point you the way.
Whatever their findings—richer-toned pianos, fadeless
fabrics, new foods—they discovered them for you. They
describe them in advertisements, relating what interests
you most.
All that hands, earth, dogged science can yield, advertise
ments offer you. Your home furnishings, your food,
clothes, car, business supplies would never have been
yours without advertisements, messages of pioneers.
Their trails climb farther each day. Do you follow?
Read the advertisements. Read them every day.
