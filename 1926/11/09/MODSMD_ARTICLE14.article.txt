# GAIETIES TO HAVE POPULAR CAST OF SPECIALTY ACTORS
## One of First Acts Completed Is Group of Dances by Boone, King, Boone 
### 
Gordon Davis, director of dramatics,
announced last night that there will
be no new tryouts for the Football
Gaieties, which will be staged Novem
ber 19, the evening before the Big
Game. Instead, the promising material
that was shown in the tryouts for the
Sword and Sandals play will be called
on for additional tryouts.
The cast of the Gaieties will be com
posed mostly of students who have
participated in campus dramatics be
fore. There are opportunities this
quarter to draw on an unusual amount
of material, and the show should be
particularly polished because of the
majority of experienced actors that
will tuke part.
Although all the acts have not yet
been cast, several of them are rapidly
rounding into shape, and need only a
lew more rehearsals to make them
smooth. One of the first to be com
pleted is the group of dances by Boone,
King, Boone, the soft-shoe artists.
This team is extremely popular on
the campus and has appeared in for
mer vaudevilles. They offer some origi
nal eccentric dances that promise to
surprise, and stage effects have been
designed that are in keeping with the
number. Frances Boone will also do a
specialty. Van King and Hal Boone
are the other members of the trio.
The Boone-Brooks orchestra of eight
pieces will accompany the dancers.
Tickets will go on sale next week.
