All Stanford women, as members of
W.A.A., will be assessed the $2 dues
in payment for the Women's Lodge if
the plan suggested by the W.A.A.
Board is passed at the open meeting

of prevention against a large number
of drives for money to finance the
lodge.
A truck will start down the Row

call for women who are attending the

enrolled for gym classes will be ex
cused to attend the gathering if they
sign up for it beforehand at Roble

the gymnasium to the site of the lodge
at Searsville lake.
W.A.A. has planned a short program
of stunts and music as well as the
business meeting*. The women will be
brought back to the campus in time
for dinner.
