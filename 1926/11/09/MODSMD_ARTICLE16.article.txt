# WOMEN'S ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION LODGE DESIGN COMPLETED
## 
### 
Horseback riding, swimming, canoe
ing, and hiking are some of the at
tractions to be held forth by the
VV.A.A. Lodge, which, according to
present plans, will be built directly
above the dam at Searsville, on the
Stanford side of the lake.
The Lodge will be a low building
built of shakes and shingles. Morgan
Stedman, a student of architecture at
Stanford, has designed tho building.
The greater part of the floor space
will be given over to a large living
room, with a natural stone fireplace
at the end. Other rooms will include
a sleeping porch, tho latter to accom
modate ten women. If this accommo
dation proves inadequate, cots for ten
more can bo placed in the living room.
The Lodge will cost $3000", of which
1 sum the University will lend $2000
after the W.A.A. raises the first $1000.
The Illustrated Review campaign
; served to start this fund. The W.A.A.
| Hoard has recommended that its mem
| hers pay dues of $2 toward raising
I lie necessary money. This, the Board
states, would do away with the neces
| sity of a number of campaigns.
Marie Manchee. president of W.A.A.,
! believes that the Lodge will be ready
I for the University women next year.
