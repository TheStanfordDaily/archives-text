# TRAVEL DIFFICULTIES IN CENTRAL AFRICA TOLD BY MRS. HELLER
## Woman Explorer Describes Method of Obtaining Transportation 
### 
"Traveling in Safari" is a great deal j
of hard labor plus a great deal of ad- j
venture and enjoyment," said Mrs.
Hilda Hempl Heller at the meeting
of the Faculty Women's Club yester
day afternoon in the Stanford Wo
men's Clubhouse.
Mrs. Heller is just back from a trip
to Africa, on a scientific expedition
under the auspices of the Field Mu
seum of Natural History in Chicago.
She also made similar trips to Peru
and Brazil.
Domestic Problems
Mrs. Heller emphasized the domes-!
tic problems arising from such expe
ditions. "One must know the country
in advance," she said, "in order to
make no costly mistakes. Certain
kinds of food will be obtainable in
one country and not in another. We
usually took luxuries with us, such
as tinned meats, cheeses, and the like,
and depended on the country for the
staples. We found these good and very
nourishing, and I, for one, never tired
of them.
"The problem of transportation was
always with us. We had to know in
advance whether we would travel with
mules or with 'boys.' The 'boys' differ
a good deal in South America and in
Africa. The African 'boy' will carry
about fifty pounds and travel about
twelve miles a day, while the South
American porter will carry perhaps
KM) pounds but will travel only six
miles per day. The South American
porter is also a very rare article.
Boys Run Away
"In Africa they are easier to get, as
they wish to earn a little money to
pay the hut tax that every malQ
African must pay on each hut he owns.
bTheir greatest fault, however, is that
they are very prone to run away.
Once, eighty-six of my 100 'boys' left
me on the eve of our start, after we
had waited six weeks to get those
100.
"Packing is very important," said
Mrs. Heller. "It is very different from
I putting things away in boxes when
you are keeping house. Then you put
all of one kind of food in one box and
anotfier in a second. But on 'Safari'
you pack some of each kind of food in
each box. This enables you to use the
contents of one box without having to
go to the time and trouble to open
any other.
Valuable Specimens
"We got some very interesting and
valuable specimens," concluded Mrs.
Heller. "While in Africa, in Uganda,
my husband was fortunate to get a
huge male gorilla. It took us nine
hours to get the carcass and skin
down the mountains three miles, with
twonty-six 'boys' on the work. One of
our tragedies occurred in connection
with this specimen—our little cur-dog
chewed off three joints on one band,
! and though we gave him hot mustard
I and water, we never got them back
! again!"

Domestic Problems
Mrs. Heller emphasized the domes-!
tic problems arising from such expe
ditions. "One must know the country
in advance," she said, "in order to
make no costly mistakes. Certain
kinds of food will be obtainable in
one country and not in another. We
usually took luxuries with us, such
as tinned meats, cheeses, and the like,
and depended on the country for the
staples. We found these good and very
nourishing, and I, for one, never tired
of them.
"The problem of transportation was
always with us. We had to know in
advance whether we would travel with
mules or with 'boys.' The 'boys' differ
a good deal in South America and in
Africa. The African 'boy' will carry
about fifty pounds and travel about
twelve miles a day, while the South
American porter will carry perhaps
KM) pounds but will travel only six
miles per day. The South American
porter is also a very rare article.
Boys Run Away
"In Africa they are easier to get, as
they wish to earn a little money to
pay the hut tax that every malQ
African must pay on each hut he owns.
bTheir greatest fault, however, is that
they are very prone to run away.
Once, eighty-six of my 100 'boys' left
me on the eve of our start, after we
had waited six weeks to get those
100.
"Packing is very important," said
Mrs. Heller. "It is very different from
I putting things away in boxes when
you are keeping house. Then you put
all of one kind of food in one box and
anotfier in a second. But on 'Safari'
you pack some of each kind of food in
each box. This enables you to use the
contents of one box without having to
go to the time and trouble to open
any other.
Valuable Specimens
"We got some very interesting and
valuable specimens," concluded Mrs.
Heller. "While in Africa, in Uganda,
my husband was fortunate to get a
huge male gorilla. It took us nine
hours to get the carcass and skin
down the mountains three miles, with
twonty-six 'boys' on the work. One of
our tragedies occurred in connection
with this specimen—our little cur-dog
chewed off three joints on one band,
! and though we gave him hot mustard
I and water, we never got them back
! again!"
"Traveling in Safari" is a great deal j
of hard labor plus a great deal of ad- j
venture and enjoyment," said Mrs.
Hilda Hempl Heller at the meeting
of the Faculty Women's Club yester
day afternoon in the Stanford Wo
men's Clubhouse.
Mrs. Heller is just back from a trip
to Africa, on a scientific expedition
under the auspices of the Field Mu
seum of Natural History in Chicago.
