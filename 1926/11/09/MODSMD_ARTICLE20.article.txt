# VARSITY SQUAD GETS READY TO MEET HUSKIES
## Lewis May Get Opportunity At Quarterback Job On Saturday FIRST STRING COMPLETE Washington Has Chance Yet To Tie for Coast Title; Shut Cards Out 
### George W. Story 
Yesterday afternoon Pop Warner
started building up fortifications to
meet an invasion from the north, for
he is expecting General Enoch Bag
shaw and his University of Washing
ton warriors to engage in a pitched
battle with his Cardinals in the Stan
ford Stadium Saturday afternoon.
This game against the Huskies will
he the only conference struggle
played on the campus this season and
will also be one of the feature con
tests of the year. It not only means
everything to Stanford as far as a
possible championship is concerned,
hut it also offers them an opportunity
to avenge the 13 to 0 setback they
suffered at Seattle last fall.
Washington Has Chance
Washington still has a chance to tie
for the coast title. If the Trojans win
from the Oregon Aggies Thursday at
Portland and the Huskies are able to
defeat Stanford the conference stand
ings will be tied, and Stanford will
NOT be one of the three teams dead
locked for the top rung of the ladder,
for a defeat will give them only a
.G67 percentage, while U.S.C., Wash
ington, and the Aggies will have a
.750 mark, providing U.S.C. and Wash
ington turn in victories.
The Redshirts are well aware of this
fact, and they fully realize that noth
ing but a defeat of Washington can
keep them in the select circle.
It was with this in mind that they
went to work last night to prepare
for Saturday's classic, the feature at
traction of Saturday's Pacific Coast
Conference schedule. The regulars,
who did not see service against Santa
Clara last week, were put through a
stiff workout.
First on the program was the prac
tice of kick-offs and their return. After
about a half an hour of this Warner
had the squads run signals until al
most 5:30 o'clock. He then allowed
those who played against Santa Clara
to call it a day, but the regulars were
asked to stay a few minutes longer to
indulge in a few setting-up exercises.
All Varsity Men Out
With two weeks' rest between the
U.S.C. game and the Washington tus
sle, every member of the squad should
be in tip-top condition for Saturday's
encounter. Dick Hyland's leg injury
is not giving him any trouble and
Harold-MoGi-ceiy was out in uniform
for practice last night. McCreery was
not in uniform last Saturday, but he
will be ready to go when the time
comes for the game against the North
erners.
Every other member of the squad,
with the exception of Spud Lewis,
is feeling fit to pull out a Husky's
tooth right now. Lewis, whose work
against Santa Clara last week left
practically nothing to be desired, suf
fered a bruised hip early in the second
half and had to leave the field. He was

not in uniform last night but he ex
pects to be able to participate in the
workout today.
Lewis May Play
If Lewis has fully recovered by Sat- !
urday it is almost certain that he will;
see service in the game, for against
the Broncos he gave as good an ex
hibition of signal barking as has been
witnessed by Cardinal followers this
year.
Stiff workouts are scheduled for
tcday. Wednesday, and Thursday, and i
then a light signal drill Friday is ex
pected to put the Redshirts on edge
for this all-important conference game !
Saturday.
