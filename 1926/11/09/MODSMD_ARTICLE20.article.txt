# VARSITY SQUAD GETS READY TO MEET HUSKIES
## Lewis May Get Opportunity At Quarterback Job On Saturday FIRST STRING COMPLETE Washington Has Chance Yet To Tie for Coast Title; Shut Cards Out 
### George W. Story 
Yesterday afternoon Pop Warner
started building up fortifications to
meet an invasion from the north, for
he is expecting General Enoch Bag
shaw and his University of Washing
ton warriors to engage in a pitched
battle with his Cardinals in the Stan
ford Stadium Saturday afternoon.
This game against the Huskies will
he the only conference struggle
played on the campus this season and
will also be one of the feature con
tests of the year. It not only means
everything to Stanford as far as a
possible championship is concerned,
hut it also offers them an opportunity
to avenge the 13 to 0 setback they
suffered at Seattle last fall.
Washington Has Chance
Washington still has a chance to tie
for the coast title. If the Trojans win
from the Oregon Aggies Thursday at
Portland and the Huskies are able to
defeat Stanford the conference stand
ings will be tied, and Stanford will
NOT be one of the three teams dead
locked for the top rung of the ladder,
for a defeat will give them only a
.G67 percentage, while U.S.C., Wash
ington, and the Aggies will have a
.750 mark, providing U.S.C. and Wash
ington turn in victories.
The Redshirts are well aware of this
fact, and they fully realize that noth
ing but a defeat of Washington can
keep them in the select circle.
