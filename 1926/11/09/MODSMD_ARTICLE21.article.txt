# FRESHMEN OFFERED 10,000 BOXES FOR BIG GAME BONFIRE
## 
### 
With a promise of ten thousand
boxes in San Jose for the freshman
bonfire, Chairman Ken Milligan of the
bonfire committee is now trying to
make arrangements to have them
hauled to the scene of the pyre. If
possible the Peninsula Railroad or
Southern Pacific will be approached
to haul these.
Over 125 men were on hand all
afternoon yesterday and fifteen loads
of wood have been brought in. The
scaffolding for the structure is about
completed. The telephone company
put up ten poles for the outside walls
and fourteen more will be added to
form the flue and strengthen the pile.
Strict time is being kept, according
to Tom Murphy, chairman of the com
mittee, and no freshman will be al
lowed to get away without putting in
his fifteen hours of bonfire work and
eight hours of guarding.
