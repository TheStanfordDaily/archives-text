# Three Dates a Week
## 
### 
Universities and colleges throughout the world are supposedly insti
tutions to prepare and train students for life work and problems, to
develop self-reliance through putting students on their own resources.
Texas University has recently passed a ruling which violates this
fundamental purpose of an institution of higher learning. An announce
ment comes from this southern university this week to the effect that
women there are limited to three social engagements a week.
According to authorities issuing this edict such action was taken in
order that a woman's time should be well balanced with the serious
things of life on one hand, and social enjoyment on the other, with not
too much of either. An admirable reason for the recent ruling in-as-much
as university life is intended to develop self-reliance and the ability to
cope with life problems! Certainly the decision as to whether or not a
woman should have three or four dates a week is a matter which she
will have to decide for herself when she is no longer at college. Restric
tion during her university career is unlikely to foster any ability to meet
this problem when she is a graduate.
In matters of classwork the student is put on his own resources. The
princple, "Do it or flunk out," operates in the classroom as a method of
training students in self-reliance. Should not the same principle be
applied in the preparation of student responsibility in matters of personal
conduct ?
Many women of university age, especially seniors, are old enough to
assume the duties of United States voters; they surely have reached the
age when they should be allowed to solve their personal problems.
Th college is not a monastery nor is it a kindergarten to protect
children.
