# Crewâ€”at O.A.C.
## 
### 
A shell, the first in history at Oregon Agricultural College, is to
sweep along the Willamette river at Corvallis now. It is the gift of
California, and its coming will mark the establishment of crew as an
interclass sport.
When the Aggie craft takes the water there on its initial trial, the
act will be the first result of more than two years of agitation since
rowing experts pronounced the river suitable to rowing.
Now varsity crew, once a remote possibility, is on the horizon for
O.A.C. Lack of funds, always a serious problem where schools are not
near large potential crowds for football games, delays consideration of
its establishment. Both that this difficulty may be reduced, and that crew
will be recognized as a varsity sport before long, is now most likely.
Washington has offered such assistance as it can by promising to
donate a shell likewise. That will help the Aggies. They must secure
another shell soon.
With two shells in action and with interclass races decided upon, it
will be only a question of time until Aggie crews will be competing with
Washington and California. Crew fans all along the coast may be glad
that O.A.C. is taking this big sports step.
