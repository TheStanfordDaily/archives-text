# MALARIA POSSIBLE TO CONTROL STATES U.C. HEALTH EXPERT

### 
"Malaria can be controlled," says
Professor William 13. Herms, specialist
in parasitology at the University of
California, in an article entitled, "Ma- j
laria-bearing Mosquitoes Live Because
of Man's Own Carelessness," printed j
in the August number of Nation's
Health magazine. This statement was
made upon completion of a detailed I
study of the malaria mosquitoes.
Results Attained
To secure quickest results, attention 1
should be concentrated on the certain
species of mosquitoes that are car
riers. Permanent results can be ob
tained by oiling water surfaces, use of
Paris green and top minnows, and by
correction and drainage of irrigation
defects. This will not only make the j
district unlivable for these particular
kinds of mosquitoes, but will keep all

j others away.
Referring to the work done in the
! Canal Zone and in Cuba, Professor
J Herms says, "With this vast back
ground of achievement it is hardly be
lievable that there could bo any hesi
tation on the part of any community
to avail itself of the opportunity to
gain certain freedom from malaria."
Death Rate Reduced
i Investigation of the present malaria
| situation in California shows that the
i death rate from this disease in this
state has been reduced very consider
ably during the last sixteen years.
| Over 1000 lives have been spared, and |
i a far greater number of cases have
i been avoided due to a more thorough
[ understanding of cause and treatment.
The death rate has fallen from 4.9
per 100,000 population in 1909 to 0.7
per 100,000 In 1921,
Beginning his study of malaria con
trol in 1910, Professor Herms has
spent much time on the work, conduct
ing campaigns in Placer county and
throughout the San Joaquin and Sac
ramento valleys.
