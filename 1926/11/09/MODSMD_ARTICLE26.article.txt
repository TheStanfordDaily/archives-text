### The King 
John Held, Jr., wants to know what
has become of the "old-fashioned girl
who used to dance with her feet."
She probably got pneumonia trying
to look like a John Held drawing.
Debates between two Canadian uni
versities are conducted in the college
newspapers. The orators mail in their
speeches, which are printed in order
ind then each has an opportunity for
rebuttal. Logically the next thing is
to conduct football games the same
way.
Think of all the excitement and
nervous strain this would save the
students and players. The third quar
ter of the "Big Game" might start with
a postcard from Warner to Berkeley:
"Line holding strong and Hoffman
making an end run. Let me know by
special delivery what you do. This
suspense is awful. —Pop."
My roommate is taking an interest
in politics. Yesterday he asked what
the Wright Act was.
Like Billy Sunday we're beginning
to have our doubts about Aimee. We
think perhaps she should consult an
evangelist.

"But," says Suuday. "Even if Aimee
is guilty, she's a wonderful woman and
j nobody can replace the work of God
she has done in saving thousands of
souls from sin."
Have you had your irony today?
Fraternity pledges may enter the
intramural cross-country run over
three miles of campus territory.
; Now if twenty-four actives will stand
on the finish tape and yell "tele
phone"—
Professor Hulme says that in the
early days of Stanford only one stu
dent had a horse and buggy. What?
Five hundred coeda and only one
buggy?
Perhaps the other four hundred and
| ninety-nine couples rode bicycles.
At one time the University was so
! small that each professor knew all the
students. What a handicap to schol
j arship—
Plans rre coming along fine for the
| Roble Hall informal dance with "Cac
tus Garden" atmosphere. Qualified
j chaperones will be on hand to see
j that nobody gets prickled.
