The Editor, Sir:
I would like to take advantage of
the opportunity offered Stanford stu
dents to express their opinions through
the "Campus Opinion" column, and
call the attention of the student body
to a good deal of criticism that has
been made by off-campus visitors con
cerning the general appearance of the
Stanford yell-leaders.
Three times this year, out-of-town
visitors to our football games have
expressed their surprise to me that a
school of the size and standing of
Stanford University should allow her
yell-leaders to conduct the rooting sec
tion without looking a little more re
spectable than a common laborer.
Although this is my first year at
Stanford, I feel that I have absorbed
enough "Stanford Spirit" to honor and
respect the University to the greatest
extent possible. And I must say that
it cuts me rather deeply to have a
representative of Stanford criticized,
no matter how small or insignificant
that individual may be. And when
matters reach a state where import
ant members of the University are
openly criticized, I feel that something
should be done.
To my mind, the climax was reached
last Saturday at the Santa Clara game.
The Bronco rooting section, although
naturally small, made an impressive
figure, and the main feature of their
good appearance was the neatness of
their yell-leaders. Although I was not
in a position to observe Stanford's
rooting section, our lone yell-leader
was all too conspicuous with his dirty
cords and sloppy appearance.
Perhaps it is considered style to
appear typically "collegiate," but I feel
that Stanford's yell-leaders should at
least appear in white, if for effect
only. This would eliminate criticism
along this line and give the University
students a representative that would
call for respect instead of ridicule.

The above criticism is not meant to
reflect on the yell-leaders as individu
als, or upon their abilities as yell
: leaders, but is directed at the yell
leaders as student representatives. I
feel that a little executive action
would cure this unnecessary evil, and
work for the good of Stanford Uni
versity. Yours respectfully,
A CRITICAL FRESHMAN.

The Editor, Sir:
I would like to take advantage of
the opportunity offered Stanford stu
dents to express their opinions through
the "Campus Opinion" column, and
call the attention of the student body
to a good deal of criticism that has
been made by off-campus visitors con
cerning the general appearance of the
Stanford yell-leaders.
Three times this year, out-of-town
visitors to our football games have
expressed their surprise to me that a
school of the size and standing of
Stanford University should allow her
yell-leaders to conduct the rooting sec
tion without looking a little more re
spectable than a common laborer.
Although this is my first year at
Stanford, I feel that I have absorbed
enough "Stanford Spirit" to honor and
respect the University to the greatest
extent possible. And I must say that
it cuts me rather deeply to have a
representative of Stanford criticized,
no matter how small or insignificant
that individual may be. And when
matters reach a state where import
ant members of the University are
openly criticized, I feel that something
should be done.
To my mind, the climax was reached
last Saturday at the Santa Clara game.
The Bronco rooting section, although
naturally small, made an impressive
figure, and the main feature of their
good appearance was the neatness of
their yell-leaders. Although I was not
in a position to observe Stanford's
rooting section, our lone yell-leader
was all too conspicuous with his dirty
cords and sloppy appearance.
Perhaps it is considered style to
appear typically "collegiate," but I feel
that Stanford's yell-leaders should at
least appear in white, if for effect
only. This would eliminate criticism
along this line and give the University
students a representative that would
call for respect instead of ridicule.

The above criticism is not meant to
reflect on the yell-leaders as individu
als, or upon their abilities as yell
: leaders, but is directed at the yell
leaders as student representatives. I
feel that a little executive action
would cure this unnecessary evil, and
work for the good of Stanford Uni
versity. Yours respectfully,
A CRITICAL FRESHMAN.
