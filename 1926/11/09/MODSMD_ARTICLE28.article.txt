The Editor, Sir:
I notice in the Bull Session, that
j clever, clever synopsis of H. L. Menck
| en's views as expressed In the previ
j ous month's American Mercury, that
] Mrs. Louise James is scalded in a
| pseudo-scathing manner. Mr. Bull Ses
i sion is too funny for words. We just
| would not have seen anything at which
to laugh had not he, with his miracu
i lous Gargantuan sense of humor, come
I to our aid.
Meanwhile, Mr. B. S. probably goes
on his merry, Pippaian way, content
with himself, and believing that his
! views are wholly his own, original
! chef d'ouevres. As a matter of fact,
| however, the American Mercury has
| lost numberless sales, as, (as I have
! said), students may read everything in
jit day by day in the Bull Session.
! My letter is not to argue about Coca-
Cola. Personally, I like neither it nor
sarsaparilla, and so I do not feel that
it is any of my affair. But T do feel
that, though I am by no means worthy
to do so, I should like to lay a wreath
j at the feet of Mr. B. S. So long an he
j continues with his awfully funny writ
ings, the University will be one long
j line of smiles—for he tells us when
to smile—how to smile—even if not
I why. —Marshall Kirby.
P.S.: I am well aware of the fact
that this will bring down a scalding
heap of humor in Mr. B.S.' U.S., but
I don't care. I'm reckless now. I just
want to laugh, laugh, laugh. He is so
| funny.
