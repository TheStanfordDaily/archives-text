# STUDENTS TO TEST FRAGMENTS OF GUN DETONATED BY SHELL
## 
### 
Fragments of a 75 mm. gun, deto
nated by a high explosive shell placed
In the bore, were recently received by
the Ordnance unit of the R.O.T.C.
These fragments are to be tested by
the Ordnance students in the course
on the Metallographic Constitution of
Steels, given by Professor Welton J.
Crook, Associate Professor of Metal
lurgy.
Guns have been made heretofore by
one of two methods; the built-up and
the wire-wrapped methods. A new
method of manufacture, known as the
autofrettage method, is now being
tried. Several 75 mm. guns have been
recently manufactured by this new
method and were taken to the Aber
deen Proving Grounds in Maryland
where they were detonated by high
explosive shells.
The fragments received at Stanford
were those of one of the guns ex
ploded at Aberdeen. Guns made by
the other two methods are subjected
to the same tests and the fragments
of the three differently made guns are
then compared and carefully ex
amined.
