# CAMPUS POSTOFFICE HAD MANY EARLY WANDERINGS
## 
### 
The present postoffice at the corner
of Lasuen has served as a combined
social center and mail address for the
Stanford student body since 1900. Pre
vious to this, however, the campus
postoffice possessed the most nomadic
history of any Stanford institution.
When the university was first estab
lished the postoffice address was sim
ply Menlo Park. Palo Alio at that time
was only a platform under some oak
trees — sometimes one train a day
stopped, often none. The mail was
brought over twice a day from Menlo
in a rickety wagon. It was distributed
first at Eneina by Mi*. Pert Fesler an '
then sent over to Roble Hall. Faculty
and students not living at Eneina wen
obliged to collect their letters by "in
quiring at the registrar's office."
After the community had begun to
grow, the address was changed tr
Palo Alto, and finally plans were made
for the erection of a campus postoffice
A news item in the Daily Palo Alto,
September 5, 1893, announced: "The
postoffice address to the world at large
is no longer Palo Alto, California, but
Stanford University, California. The
new postoffice has a money order de
partment, a long distance telephone,
a Wells F'argo express office, and a
Western Union telegraph office."
The postofTice was a small cottage
just back of tho inner Quadrangle.

! The student body at that time num
bered around GOO men and 200 women,
and the building served as much as a
social meeting place as it does today.
When the results of the Stanfords' law
suit were received, the jubilant stu
dent body, led by one of the tallest
j men on the campus, painted the whole
] thing a cardinal red.
When the room became cramped
there a new building was put up on
Lasuen —now the present postoffice.
The old cottage served as a bookstore
and drug and candy store until the
earthquake in 190G.
Arrangements were made for 1239
oeople in the beginning, but frequent
nlargements have been made so that
low a shifting community of over
1000 is provided for. The postoffice
'as progressed from third-class to one
>112 the largest of the second-class mail
iffices in the country.
An attempt was made at one time
'o merge this office with the Palo
Alto branch, and in return house de
livery was promised, but campus peo
ple rose to the cause and championed
heir community center. The project
was vigorously petitioned against and
I defeated.
So the present building has served
the campus for twenty-six years. The
' University building program includes
plans for a new postoffice on a site
| nearer tho bookstore, however.

When the results of the Stanfords' law
suit were received, the jubilant stu
dent body, led by one of the tallest
j men on the campus, painted the whole
] thing a cardinal red.
When the room became cramped
there a new building was put up on
Lasuen —now the present postoffice.
The old cottage served as a bookstore
and drug and candy store until the
earthquake in 190G.
Arrangements were made for 1239
oeople in the beginning, but frequent
nlargements have been made so that
low a shifting community of over
1000 is provided for. The postoffice
'as progressed from third-class to one
>112 the largest of the second-class mail
iffices in the country.
An attempt was made at one time
'o merge this office with the Palo
Alto branch, and in return house de
livery was promised, but campus peo
ple rose to the cause and championed
heir community center. The project
was vigorously petitioned against and
I defeated.
So the present building has served
the campus for twenty-six years. The
' University building program includes
plans for a new postoffice on a site
| nearer tho bookstore, however.
The present postoffice at the corner
of Lasuen has served as a combined
social center and mail address for the
Stanford student body since 1900. Pre
vious to this, however, the campus
postoffice possessed the most nomadic
history of any Stanford institution.
When the university was first estab
lished the postoffice address was sim
ply Menlo Park. Palo Alio at that time
was only a platform under some oak
trees — sometimes one train a day
stopped, often none. The mail was
brought over twice a day from Menlo
in a rickety wagon. It was distributed
first at Eneina by Mi*. Pert Fesler an '
then sent over to Roble Hall. Faculty
and students not living at Eneina wen
obliged to collect their letters by "in
quiring at the registrar's office."
After the community had begun to
grow, the address was changed tr
Palo Alto, and finally plans were made
for the erection of a campus postoffice
A news item in the Daily Palo Alto,
September 5, 1893, announced: "The
postoffice address to the world at large
is no longer Palo Alto, California, but
Stanford University, California. The
new postoffice has a money order de
partment, a long distance telephone,
a Wells F'argo express office, and a
Western Union telegraph office."
The postofTice was a small cottage
just back of tho inner Quadrangle.

! The student body at that time num
bered around GOO men and 200 women,
and the building served as much as a
social meeting place as it does today.
