### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
In Europe, the words "Notre Dame"
usually mean the famous Cathedral of ;
"Our Lady" in Paris, one of the most
beautiful examples of Gothic architec
ture in the world. In America, "Notre
Dame" means a little school at South
Bend, Indiana, that every year is noted
for its splendid football teams. It is
not hard to compare these two, the
Notre Dame Cathedral and the Notre
Dame football team. Standing before !
that wonderful building, you get an im
pression of beauty combined with
strength. To' see most of the Notre
Dame teams in action is to receive
the same impression.
The Cathedral has wonderful lines,
while the football team has a wonder
ful line—and a great backfield. There
is rhythm and grace and harmony to
be found in both, as well as a rugged
strength and solidity. Both are works
of art.
The Notre Dame football team is one
of the few elevens in the country this
fall that has two captains. Leave it
to Rockne to have something different
about his team. "Shock troops" in i
"silk panties" led by two captains!
As a matter of fact, Tom Hearden and
Gene Edwards were tied when the
votes were cast to elect a new leader
last December, so it was decided to
rotate the duties between the two.
Other teams have two captains, among
them the University of Missouri.
With a schedule like Notre Dame's,
it should take two leaders to pull a

team through the season undefeated.
}laving played Beloit, Minnesota, Penn
State, Northwestern, Georgia Tech.,
and Indiana, you'd think Roclcne's
Ramblers would be ready for a rest,
but here they are in New York this
week ready to tackle the Army in
what is, as usual, one of the feature
games of the year. After the Army
game, all Captains Heard en and Ed
wards have to worry about is Drake,
Carnegie Tech., and Southern Cali
fornia
Both of Notre Dame's captains are
red-headed. They're likely to be as
bald as their coach after going through
such a hard schedule.
