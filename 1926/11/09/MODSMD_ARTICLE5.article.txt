# INTERNATIONAL TRADE UNIONS IMPRACTICAL SAYS COMMISSIONER
## Views on Politics, Religion Not Changed by Labor Unions 
### 
Believing that the theory of Inter- j
national Trade Unions is a good one,
but an impractical one. Walter Mac-
Arthur, United States Shipping Com-1
missioner at San Francisco, who spoke
before the Cosmopolitan Club last j
night, said, "The theory goes by the i
board in face of a national issue.
"It is not necessary to fear that in
j disputes arising between countries,
; labor will conflict with the wishes of
1 its country. The labor movement of
every country will follow its country
in political matters.
Confined to Labor Problems
"The mere fact that a man belongs
to a labor organization does not!
i change his opinions on politics, reli- j
1 gion, and other national and personal
I issues. There is a widespread tendency
jto confine discussions of labor or- j
; ganizations to problems of labor such
as hours and wages and to forbid ex-!
pressions of political, religious, and
; other views irrelative to workmen's
questions.
"As evidenced by the lack of co-'
operation on the part of labor federa- j
â€¢ tions in this country and on .the con
j tinent with Great Britain's strikers, j
j the laborers of one nation are not
likely to aid their fellow workmen in
striking."
Strike Teaches Lesson
Referring to the miners' and general
strike in Great Britain, Mac Arthur
said, "If the lessons of the general ,
strike in Great Britain are learned by j
j the men and women there, the labor !
I movement will be able to come back
! stronger than it ever was before."
! The evening's program also included
! two violin selections by Paul Juon !
1 played by C. Bolton White, accom-!
panied by Reidar B. Torjussen on tbe 1
piano.
