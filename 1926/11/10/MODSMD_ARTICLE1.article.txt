# THREE ARTISTS GIVE PLEASING MUSIC CONCERT
## Dvorak's "Sonatina" in Excellent Manner LITTLE THEATRE FILLED Vocal Solos, Piano Numbers Are Well Received by Large Audience 
### Herbert Klein 
Given under the auspices of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, the joint
recital last night of Misses Elizabeth
Peirce, Winifred Estabrook, and Mary
Moynihan was eminently pleasing. The
audience was obviously delighted in
spite of the fact that many were un
able to find seats in the Little Theatre,
which proved too small for the event.
Violin, piano, and vocal groups gave
plenty of variety to the program.
The program proved once more the
need at Stanford for a small audi
torium intermediate in size between
(he inadequate Little Theatre and the
barn-like Assembly Hall with its in
terior acoustic properties. The inti
mate effect of a solo recital such as
this would have been wholly lost in
the Assembly Hall even though all the
audience might all have had seats.

Anton Dvorak's "Sonatina for Violin
and Piano" played by Miss Peirce, ac
companied by Miss Estabrook, as the
opening number, was characteristic of
the Bohemian composer's particular
genius in its wealth of charming yet
virile melody. The Sonatina was with
out both affectation and difficult tech
nicalities without descending to either
sentimentality or bareness.
Perhaps because we were looking
for it, there seemed a striking resem
blance between the rhythms and mod
ulations of certain, passages in this
and in the composer's familiar "New
World Symphony." The first move
ment, Allegro, which set the tone of
freshness and freedom from musical
scholasticism, contained in all the sub
sequent numbers. Parts resembled a
musical dialogue. In the slow move
ment, Larghetto, the essential spirit
of American Indian music seemed to
be evoked.
Piano Excellent
Rippling arpeggios by the piano, sug
gestive of the sparkling waterfall of
the conventional Indian, and assertive
harmonies obtained by double string
work on the violin gave a genuine at
mosphere. The brief Scherzo move
ment was like a merry folk melody.
One of the leading and most attractive
themes of the last movement seemed
to indicate that Dvorak had heard,
and liked, "When Johnny Comes
Marching Home," for it was highly
suggestive of that old favorite melody.
Miss Peirce gave a capable rendi
tion; her co-ordination of piano and
violin was excellent. The work was in
no sense a solo for .violin, almost
equal share being taken by the piano
played by Miss Moynihan.
A group of vocal solos by Miss
Estabrook showed the smoothness and
sureness of her voice production.
"Bird of the Wilderness" was dramatic
and its rendition a feat in vocal dy
namics. Three piano pieces by Florent
Schmitt were rendered by Miss Moyni
han. All were brief, almost fragment
ary, and each succeeded admirably in
producing an atmosphere. The three
artists joined in presenting three
songs with obligato at the end of the
concert. Harmonious blending of the
violin and voice was one of the
charms of the first number, a Mozart
selection, whose interest, never tlagged
in spite of its classical length and
repetition. "Tes Yeux," a French gem,
was the high watermark in the vocal
program by its graceful melody and
the real feeling put into it by Miss
Moynihan.

able to find seats in the Little Theatre,
which proved too small for the event.
Violin, piano, and vocal groups gave
plenty of variety to the program.
The program proved once more the
need at Stanford for a small audi
torium intermediate in size between
(he inadequate Little Theatre and the
barn-like Assembly Hall with its in
terior acoustic properties. The inti

this would have been wholly lost in
the Assembly Hall even though all the
audience might all have had seats.

Anton Dvorak's "Sonatina for Violin
and Piano" played by Miss Peirce, ac
companied by Miss Estabrook, as the
opening number, was characteristic of
the Bohemian composer's particular
genius in its wealth of charming yet
virile melody. The Sonatina was with
out both affectation and difficult tech
nicalities without descending to either
sentimentality or bareness.
Perhaps because we were looking
for it, there seemed a striking resem
blance between the rhythms and mod
ulations of certain, passages in this
and in the composer's familiar "New
World Symphony." The first move
ment, Allegro, which set the tone of
freshness and freedom from musical
scholasticism, contained in all the sub
sequent numbers. Parts resembled a
musical dialogue. In the slow move
ment, Larghetto, the essential spirit
of American Indian music seemed to
be evoked.
Piano Excellent
Rippling arpeggios by the piano, sug
gestive of the sparkling waterfall of
the conventional Indian, and assertive
harmonies obtained by double string
work on the violin gave a genuine at
mosphere. The brief Scherzo move
ment was like a merry folk melody.
One of the leading and most attractive
themes of the last movement seemed
to indicate that Dvorak had heard,
and liked, "When Johnny Comes
Marching Home," for it was highly
suggestive of that old favorite melody.
Miss Peirce gave a capable rendi
tion; her co-ordination of piano and
violin was excellent. The work was in
no sense a solo for .violin, almost
equal share being taken by the piano
played by Miss Moynihan.
A group of vocal solos by Miss
Estabrook showed the smoothness and
sureness of her voice production.
"Bird of the Wilderness" was dramatic
and its rendition a feat in vocal dy
namics. Three piano pieces by Florent
Schmitt were rendered by Miss Moyni
han. All were brief, almost fragment
ary, and each succeeded admirably in
producing an atmosphere. The three
artists joined in presenting three
songs with obligato at the end of the
concert. Harmonious blending of the
violin and voice was one of the
charms of the first number, a Mozart
selection, whose interest, never tlagged
in spite of its classical length and
repetition. "Tes Yeux," a French gem,
was the high watermark in the vocal
program by its graceful melody and
the real feeling put into it by Miss
Moynihan.
Given under the auspices of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, the joint
recital last night of Misses Elizabeth
Peirce, Winifred Estabrook, and Mary
Moynihan was eminently pleasing. The
audience was obviously delighted in
