# LONDON BISHOP SPEAKS IN MEMORIAL CHURCH TODAY
## 
### 
Interest in the welfare of the youth of the world has always been the
especial interest of Right Reverend Arthur .Foley Winnington-Ingram, D.D.,
Lord Bishop of London, who will speak at the assembly in Memorial Church
this morning at 10 o'clock. His talks to the students of Oxford and Cam
bridge have had deep and widespread influence throughout England.
Fostering this interest, he has been making a tour of the leading
; universities and colleges of this country since October 1 under the terms of
the Turner legacy, a gift made a few years ago to the Department of Religious
Education of the Episcopal Church to bring to this country men who could

>irivp ideas of special value to college
I and university students.
Preaches for King
In England the Bishop of London
preaches for the King and Queen, but
his democratic attitude has caused
him to be known to the East End,
where he has done years of parish
work, as the "London Bobbies Bishop."
Although Bishop Ingram is 68 years
old, he has interest in tennis, golf,
and other sports. The Bishop of Jeru
salem is said to have remarked that
the most interesting thing he saw in
London was the Bishop of London
winning at tennis.
The Bishop of London is a peer of
the realm, his predecessors having
been lords in Fulham for more than
twelve hundred years. Domesday
Book, recording a survey made in
1085 for William the Conqueror, says
the Bishop of London held forty hides
of land in Fulham, which was given
to a Bishop nearly four centuries be
fore the Conqueror came to England.

San Francisco, at 8 o'clock on the

Bishop will speak, Acting President
Swain will be Stanford's official repre
sentative. Bishop Edward Lambe Par
sons, who is Bishop of California, and
Mrs. Parsons will be hosts at a recep
tion to (he Bishop that afternoon.

partment from 1897 to 1902.
