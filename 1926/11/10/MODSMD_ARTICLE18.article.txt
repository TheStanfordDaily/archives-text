# BAGSHAW'S MEN AIM TO REPEAT LAST YEAR WIN
## Result of Game May Hinge On Reservesâ€”Stanford Seconds Strong GUTTORMSEN STAR MAN Washington Determined to Defeat League-Leading Cardinal Eleven 
### 
Coach Enoch Bagshaw of the Wash
ington Huskies will bring to Stanford
Saturday a squad of men who liavo
pointed since the beginning of the sea
son for the clash with the Cardinals.
With memories of last year's 13 to 0
victory over Stanford which gavo
them the coast conference champion
ship and the right to play Alabama in
Ihe New Year's Day game, Bagshaw's
men feel that they can repeat the act.
Coming from the north with deter
mination to topple the undefeated
league-leading Cardinals from their
position and witli both teams boasting
great scoring strength which has
placed them among the leaders in na
tional high-score ratings, it is possi
ble that the final outcome will be in
fluenced to a great extent by field
generalship and the way in which the
breaks of the game are handled. In
eight games, Washington has run up
193 points, while opponents liavo
scored only 25. Stanford is rated a
little lower, for in eight games the
Cards have scored 191 points and let
their opponents score points adding
up to G3.
Both Heavy Scorers
This scoring ability lies in the cali
bre of the individual backfield mem
bers of the two teams. Washington has
candidates for the All-Coast eleven in
Quarterback and Captain George Gut
tormsen, who with three years of var
sity experience is certain to play his
usual brilliant game. He passes, kicks,
and runs jvith the best in the game.
His mainstay in gaining yards is
Harold Patton, halfback, who has ac
counted for 48 points this year, being
a close second to the flashy Morton
Kaer of Southern California. Patton
gained invaluable experience as a
member of the Husky backfleld when
Elmer Tesreau and George Wilson
played with him for two years.
Have Drop-Kicker
Besides these two men, the Huskies
have a guard, Gene Cook, who is a
deadly drop-kicker inside the thirty
five-yard mark.
Stanford boasts of Dick Hyland,
George Bogue, and "Biff" Hoffman,
from which Cardinal power In speed,
line-bucking, punting, passing, and
open-field running is derived.
From all pre-game dope, it is pos
sible that the winner will be the team
that can stick to the fight .and last the
longest. Washington in the game Sat
urday against California, proved that
it is in fine physical condition. The
Cardinal first-string has not played
since the U.S.C. battle and has only
a few days' practice and scrimmage in
which to reach the same peak of con
dition which finally brought them vic
tory in Los Angeles.
It may be said that "Pop" Warner's
powerful reserve strength when
thrown in against the -Huskies, will
favorably turn the tide of battle to a
Redshirt victory. Warner knew what
he was doing when he gave his sec

ond- and third-string men their chance
to beat Santa Clara last Saturday, for
it may be this very bunch with its
flashy scoring power that may spell
defeat for the Huskies.
Bagshaw # and Warner will match
their wits play by play, for both are
known among the best mentors in
the country.

thrown in against the -Huskies, will
favorably turn the tide of battle to a
Redshirt victory. Warner knew what
he was doing when he gave his sec

ond- and third-string men their chance
to beat Santa Clara last Saturday, for
it may be this very bunch with its
flashy scoring power that may spell
defeat for the Huskies.
Bagshaw # and Warner will match
their wits play by play, for both are

Coach Enoch Bagshaw of the Wash
ington Huskies will bring to Stanford
Saturday a squad of men who liavo
pointed since the beginning of the sea
son for the clash with the Cardinals.
With memories of last year's 13 to 0
victory over Stanford which gavo
them the coast conference champion
ship and the right to play Alabama in
Ihe New Year's Day game, Bagshaw's
men feel that they can repeat the act.
Coming from the north with deter
mination to topple the undefeated
league-leading Cardinals from their
position and witli both teams boasting
great scoring strength which has
placed them among the leaders in na
tional high-score ratings, it is possi
ble that the final outcome will be in
fluenced to a great extent by field
generalship and the way in which the
breaks of the game are handled. In
eight games, Washington has run up
193 points, while opponents liavo
scored only 25. Stanford is rated a
little lower, for in eight games the
Cards have scored 191 points and let
their opponents score points adding
up to G3.
Both Heavy Scorers
This scoring ability lies in the cali
bre of the individual backfield mem
bers of the two teams. Washington has
candidates for the All-Coast eleven in
Quarterback and Captain George Gut
tormsen, who with three years of var
sity experience is certain to play his
usual brilliant game. He passes, kicks,
and runs jvith the best in the game.
His mainstay in gaining yards is
Harold Patton, halfback, who has ac
counted for 48 points this year, being
a close second to the flashy Morton
Kaer of Southern California. Patton
gained invaluable experience as a
member of the Husky backfleld when
Elmer Tesreau and George Wilson
played with him for two years.
Have Drop-Kicker
Besides these two men, the Huskies
have a guard, Gene Cook, who is a
deadly drop-kicker inside the thirty
five-yard mark.
Stanford boasts of Dick Hyland,
George Bogue, and "Biff" Hoffman,
from which Cardinal power In speed,
line-bucking, punting, passing, and
open-field running is derived.
From all pre-game dope, it is pos
sible that the winner will be the team
that can stick to the fight .and last the
longest. Washington in the game Sat
urday against California, proved that
it is in fine physical condition. The
Cardinal first-string has not played
since the U.S.C. battle and has only
a few days' practice and scrimmage in
which to reach the same peak of con
dition which finally brought them vic
tory in Los Angeles.
It may be said that "Pop" Warner's
powerful reserve strength when
thrown in against the -Huskies, will
favorably turn the tide of battle to a
Redshirt victory. Warner knew what
he was doing when he gave his sec

ond- and third-string men their chance
to beat Santa Clara last Saturday, for
