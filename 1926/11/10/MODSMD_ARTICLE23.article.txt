# Tomorrow Morning
## 
### 
Eight years ago tliis week America was the scene of one of the
greatest celebrations in the annals of history. The World War had
ended and America's sons were ready to return to their homes. Novem
ber 7 saw the greatest burst of enthusiasm when the Armistice was
prematurely announced, but after the authentic statement of November
11 was issued, wild demonstrations burst out anew.
After the country had satisfied its emotions—howled itself hoarse
and wearied of merriment—more serious thoughts came to its mind.
A goodly portion of America's youth had given life and limb. On every
hand were seen gold service stars.
In commemoration of these men who had sacrificed their lives for
America, November 11 has been set aside. And tomorrow morning at
11:40 o'clock all classes will be excused so that students will have the
opportunity to join in a short service.
The ability to go through life in carefree manner with few serious
thoughts is in a way an enviable thing, but now and then an injection
of sobriety is necessary to a well-balanced program. A moment of
thought and realization of what tomorrow really means would not be
amiss.
The University has offered everyone the privilege of attending to
morrow's ceremonies in the Memorial Church by excusing all classes.
Students should remember that it is in every sense a privilege and not a
duty to attend.
