# Poor Old John!
## 
### 
John Perguson is dead; lie died last Friday night after the evening
production, but he is not forgotten. For how can we ever forget the
good old man when his name appears in many-colored paint all over the
sidewalks. "John Ferguson Seat Sale" (not to the funeral) confronts us
on all sides. Besides, most of us are carrying his remains around on our
shoe soles.
No one objects strongly to the chalk announcements that have in
the past adorned our walks, because it is usually erased the day after
the event is over, but when we have to read the epitaphs of John for
weeks after, it gets rather tiresome, to say the least. The freshmen are
severely reprimanded for painting a large "30" on the street, and yet
no one says anything when seniors on the dramatic council paint all
over the campus.
\\ hen the Dramatic Council members were allowed to paint the side
walks they agreed to wash the announcement off the cement the Saturday
following the production. The dramatic tryoutees did make a feeble
attempt to do this, but did not remove the writing. When this was called
to its attention the Council promised to perform its part of the agreement
immediately. Since that time they have not raised a hand in an effort
to erase the announcement. Ihe executive committee now issues a threat
that if the signs are not removed action will be taken by that body.
Let's get rid of John Ferguson, and have no more of him, or his like.
