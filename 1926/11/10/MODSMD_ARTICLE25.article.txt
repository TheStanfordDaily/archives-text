# CURTAIN TO RAISE ON COURT SEASON AT MEETING TODAY
## 
### 
When varsity basketball candidates
meet today with Coach "Husky" Hunt,
the curtain will be raised on the 1926-
27 court season at Stanford.
Hunt, the new mentor, faces the sea
eon with most of last year's veterans
on deck. As he has coached all these
men as freshmen he is acquainted with
their styles of play and will not be
handicapped by unfamiliarity with his
squad.
Players from last year's team who
will report this season are: Captain
David, forward; Price, last year's cap
tain and forward; .Tayred, center; Vin
centi, running guard; Shlpkey, run
ning guard; Clark, forward; Crist,
forward; Hlagginni, standing guard.
Anderson is not registered this quar
ter but is expected to return.
Plenty of material is also looming
up from the 1029 squad coached by
Hunt, last year. McCandless, center, is

expected to give Jayred a battle for
liis position on the varsity this season
as lie played sensational basketball
with the yearlings. Other men who
! show lots of promise are Lewis, guard;
j Wilton, forward; Marks, guard; Crary,
forward; Worden, guard; Sexson, for
ward; und Sibbett, forward.
Of last year's squad only Mitchell
and Steele will fail to answer the roll
call at tomorrow's meeting, with the
j exception of Anderson.
Cardinal court fans are looking for
ward to a team which probably will be
a power in (he conference. It. is also
pointed out that while practically all
j of Stanford's veterans are returning,
j the California squad will report minus
practically all of last year's players.
