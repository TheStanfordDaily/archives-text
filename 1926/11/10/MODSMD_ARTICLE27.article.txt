Tomorrow Stanford will dedicate a
brief moment to those of her sons
whose heroism on European battle
fields cost them their lives but won
for the University honor and glory
eternal.
Let us be careful, in paying homage
to these brave men, lest we lose sight
of the great issue which should be
uppermost in our minds on Armistice
Day.
* * *
Young men do not trade the peace
and quiet of Stanford for the noise
and tumult of battle unless they be
lieve they are accomplishing some
good purpose in doing so. Six years
have brought home to us the fSct that
the great war accomplished no good
purpose.
The simple fact that men died in
the war is not really of such import

ance as is the manner in which they
died. When we go to the services in
the chapel tomorrow, let us remember
that gay young men left Stanford to
follow an ideal and that they were
deceived into taking part in a dirty
quarrel. And let us resolve that it
shall not happen again while we have
strength to prevent it. Let us keep in
mind the fact that, for all the beauty
of soldierly heroism and sacrifice, war
is an ugly business at best.

Read what the sage, Anatole France,
who loved all heroes, had to say on
the danger of attributing to war the
glory that belongs to its unknowing
participants:
"To love war is like loving the
croup because doctors and nurses have
died in trying to save the life of a
child."
