The Editor, Sir:
Being something of a budding statis
tician, who will probably end my i
career by computing the electric ■
power to be developed from the choc
malts drunk by Stanford students
yearly, if placed end to end and
dropped from the Woolworth Building,
etc., etc., I have wrested the follow
ing statistics from the "bawl-out." The
records of the students having com
pleted one year (three quarters) were
examined and produced the following
results, which I ask to be taken at
their worth, whatever that may be.
There are exactly thirty such stu
dents with an average of B plus or
above. Two, both of whom are men,
have a straight A average. Of the
thirty, ten are women, but in the
highest sixteen there are only three
women. Of the thirty, four live in Palo
AJto, and three off the campus and
outside of Palo Alto.
Among the twenty men, nine live in
the halls, four in Palo Alto, three in
fraternities, two elsewhere on the cam
pus, and two off the campus and out
side of Palo Alto. Five of the ten
women live in Roble, four in the
sororities, and one off the campus.
The above figures may or may not
mean anything, but at least figures
don't lie. So, draw your own conclu
sions. —WUNWHONOSE.
