The Editor, Sir:
May I make a comment on the re
cent freshman election? In the first
place it was not advertised enough to
make sure of a decent turnout. This
was not the fault of anyone but the
officers in charge of the election, but

the student body constitution is re-;
sponsible for the position of the poll- i
ing place. Placed in a spot that is not
especially a center of freshman activ
ity it did not serve the purpose of a
polling place, to be near the votes.
Why could not there have been two
polling places, one in each dormitory? '
This would have drawn out a vote of
more representative size, instead of i
less than twenty-five per cent of the 1
class that elected the officers. True, it |
was not the fault of anyone but the
members of the class itself, but take i
into consideration human nature and
I am sure that you will agree with me.
Hoping that this may serve to help
future occasions of this sort, I appeal
to you. â€”S.M., '30. ]
