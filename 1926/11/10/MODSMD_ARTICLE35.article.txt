# STANFORD VARSITY SOCCER MEN LOSE PRACTICE CONTEST
## 
### 
Lack of driving power in either of
fensive or defensive departments on
the Stanford varsity soccer team, as
faced by the dogged secondary de
fense of the opposing goal-tender,
were contributing factors to the 1 to 0
defeat of the Card kickers at the
hands of San Francisco Theological
Seminary, of San Anselmo, in a prac
tice tussle yesterday afternoon.
The Card forwards carried the play
into Seminary territory throughout
the second half in a ceaseless siege
of the opponents' net, but the defen
sive ability of Brown, their goalkeeper,
prevented the Redshirts from forcing
one of their countless close-in charges
through the net for a tie score.
The Seminary players, apparently
Inexperienced in the art of footwork,
were nevertheless speedy enough to
rnrrv the ball down in advance of the
Red defense to score the vÂ»'ianfng tally
on a floater from the toe of Dan
Peterson, playing inside right for the
victors.
Captain Rob Baillard, Collins, Can
non, and Zipfel, members of the Cardi
nal offense combination, kept the ball
well in hand outside the goal territory,
but their teamwork failed to function
as perfectly close in, and several
chances to score were lost when open
kicks were muffed.
Jack Franklin and Don McCarty,
last year's captain and manager re
spectively, and Captain Baillard will
be in charge of the varsity soccer
eleven in the absence of Maloney, who
leaves today for the East, while How
ard Smith, veteran, and George Whea
ton, soccer manager, will direct the
activities of the freshman outfit in its
practice for the second game of the
California series here Saturday.
