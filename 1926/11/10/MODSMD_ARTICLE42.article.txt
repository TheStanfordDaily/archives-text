# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
I got my first glimpse of Morton
Kaer at a high school track meet in
Los Angeles in 1923. The boy from
Red Bluff was a whole team in himself,
competing in several events, and win
ning a sizzling low-hurdle race in close
to 24 seconds. Now you hear a lot
about Mort Kaer, but not as a track
man. He's still a whole team in him
self, but it's a football team, and he's
showing more versatility and speed on
the gridiron for the University of
Southern California than he ever did
on the track for Red Bluff.
In the Southern California-Califor
nia game at Berkeley last month, Kaer
more than came into his own. U.S.C.
came into its own too, and beat its
arch-rivals from up north for the first
time since 1915, but that is another
story. An account of the game is a
repetition of sentences like this:
"Kaer runs back punt ten yards,"
"Kaer passes twenty yards to Hibbs,"
"Kaer carries ball fifteen yards,"

I "Two passes by Kaer gain fifteen
i yards, "Kaer gains twenty yards in
three plays," "Kaer runs forty-eight
yards to a touchdown." Besides that,
Kaer ran the team and did the punt
ing. Not a bad afternoon's work for
S one young man.
Coach Howard Jones has succeeded
where Coach "Gloomy Gus" Henderson
failed, and with his ace-in-the-hole,
Morley Drury, idle on the sidelines
because of injuries, he ended the Tro
jans' long quest for a victory over the
Golden Bears. With a dazzling per
former like Kaer in his backfield,
| Coach Jones will not shudder when he
j thinks of the games yej. to be played
with the Oregon Aggies, Idaho, Mon
tana, and Notre Dame. Tomorrow Kaer
will get a chance to do his stuff
against the Aggies, the team that also
scored 27 points against California. It
i will be interesting to see if these
tough farmers from the north can stop
the "Red Bluff Terror..' Have a Kaer,
i Oregon!

Coach Howard Jones has succeeded
where Coach "Gloomy Gus" Henderson
failed, and with his ace-in-the-hole,
Morley Drury, idle on the sidelines
because of injuries, he ended the Tro
jans' long quest for a victory over the
Golden Bears. With a dazzling per
former like Kaer in his backfield,
| Coach Jones will not shudder when he
j thinks of the games yej. to be played
with the Oregon Aggies, Idaho, Mon
tana, and Notre Dame. Tomorrow Kaer
will get a chance to do his stuff
against the Aggies, the team that also
scored 27 points against California. It
i will be interesting to see if these
tough farmers from the north can stop
the "Red Bluff Terror..' Have a Kaer,
i Oregon!
