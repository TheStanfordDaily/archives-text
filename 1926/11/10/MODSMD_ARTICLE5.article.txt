# JUNIORS DEFAT '29 BY NARROW MARGIN IN HOCKEY PRACTICE
## 
### 
Playing with little stellar work on
either side, the 1928 women defeated
the sophomores 3 to 2 in a practice
hockey game yesterday afternoon on
Iloble field. At the end of the first
half the juniors led 2 to 1, but in the
second period the sophomores rallied
and held the upperclass women to an
even score for tha't half. The 1929
team was threatening the junior goal
when the final whistle blew.
Fay Hamilton's speed and well
timed passing were largely responsible
for the victory of her team. A pass
from her to Helen Lease resulted in
the first score of the game, and she
herself shot the final talley for the
juniors. Carolyn Shepard made the
other goal for her team.
Handicapped by a slow start, the
sophomores were unable to overcome
the 1928 women's lead. Juanita White
scored their first goal in the initial
period of the contest, and Ruth Mason
made the second in the last-minute
rush of the 1929 team.
