# Y.M.C.A. TO SOLICIT ENTERING STUDENTS' PARENTS FOR FUNDS
## New Students May Prevent Action by Notifying 'Y' By November 20 
### 
New students must notify the Cam
pus Y.M.C.A. before Ityvember 20 if
they wish to prevent the "Y" from
soliciting their parents for money, ac
cording to R. C. Bell, general secre
tary.
Blank stamped postal cards were
inclosed with a letter sent to all stu
i dents new to the University, both
freshmen and transfers. A specific re
quest must be made on these cards
before November 20 or the finance
committee of the campus "Y" will send
letters to the parents of new students
asking them to help support the or
: ganization.
To Send Letters
Addresses will be secured from the
| records which entering students were
required by the University to make
I for the official directory and regis
j trar's office.
The card system has been used for
about eight years, says Bell. Last
year about more than a sixth of the
new students refused to allow the "Y"
; to solicit their parents. Most of these
were formal denials but many included
! explanations or opposition to the prac
tice of the "Y" in its finance campaign.
All such objections are considered, de
' clares Bell.
Aim for $11,400
With the personal letter which will
be sent to parents after November 20
will be included an explanatory pam
i phlet and an imitation red leather
i folder headed "Examples of Average
Yearly Subscriptions." These indicate
I suggested subscriptions of five, fifteen,
I and twenty-five dollars. The campus
"Y" will endeavor to raise $11,400
this year, of which it hopes to secure
$2800 chiefly from parents of new
| students.
"The budget pamphlet as it will be
' sent to parents differs from the actual
j budget,"says Bell, "as it was printed
some time ago. In the actual budget
over $2000 of the $11,400 asked for
will go to pay off a deficit in the 'Y'
treasury from the past two years."
A direct campaign to raise $1400
i from the students will be made prob
i ably in February, although a commit
tee of the Associated Students has not
yet given permission or date for the
solicitation.

Addresses will be secured from the
| records which entering students were
required by the University to make
I for the official directory and regis
j trar's office.
The card system has been used for
about eight years, says Bell. Last
year about more than a sixth of the
new students refused to allow the "Y"
; to solicit their parents. Most of these
were formal denials but many included
! explanations or opposition to the prac
tice of the "Y" in its finance campaign.
All such objections are considered, de
' clares Bell.
Aim for $11,400
With the personal letter which will
be sent to parents after November 20
will be included an explanatory pam
i phlet and an imitation red leather
i folder headed "Examples of Average
Yearly Subscriptions." These indicate
I suggested subscriptions of five, fifteen,
I and twenty-five dollars. The campus
"Y" will endeavor to raise $11,400
this year, of which it hopes to secure
$2800 chiefly from parents of new
| students.
"The budget pamphlet as it will be
' sent to parents differs from the actual
j budget,"says Bell, "as it was printed
some time ago. In the actual budget
over $2000 of the $11,400 asked for
will go to pay off a deficit in the 'Y'
treasury from the past two years."
A direct campaign to raise $1400
i from the students will be made prob
i ably in February, although a commit
tee of the Associated Students has not
yet given permission or date for the
solicitation.
