The stag at eve
THIS fellow missed out on a heavy date tonight
by the close margin of one phone-call. But
don't waste pity on him. He has his jiinmy
pipe and a tidy red tin of Prince Albert . . •
grand little pals in time of stress.
When that cool, comforting smoke comes
curling up the pipe-stem, troubles evanesce with
every puff. For P. A. is The National Joy
Smoke in fact as well as phrase. Cool as a fibredtinlffwnTZtdhJt
pound tin humid on, and
money-lender. Sweet as a check from home. JXZIZp.
And always with every bit
Fragrant as a pine-grove on a damp morning. c t i?%r%te p Aibeir p o r v £%
You'll like Prince Albert better than any
other tobacco you ever packed into a pipe.
You'll like the friendly way it treats your tongue
and throat. You'll like the way it helps you over I
the rough spots. Buy a tidy red tin today and see!
