## 
### 
Due to the lack of sufficient pres
sure, a new four-inch gas main will
; supplant the present two-inch line that
i supplies the residences of the campus,
Roy H. Button, superintendent of the
Corporation Yard, announced Satur
; day. The new main will connect at the
San Francisco highway, run through
tlie west side of the arboretum, past
the Chemistry building to the Geology
corner of the Quad, and thence to
Lasuen street to join with the present
distributing system.
Work on the laying of the new pipe
line will start this morning and Button
estimates that the work will be com
pleted within three weeks.
