"Tho Young Men's Christian Association
'ciation abandoned active efforts tc
! secure Christian converts several
! years ago at Stanford," declared R. C
Dell, general secretary, commenting
j on the sweeping criticism of the or
j ganization appearing in the Novembei
1 number of the American Mercurj
magazine. "Wo do not put primarj
emphasis on evangelism," Bell said
Y.M.C.A. activities are attacked ir
the Mercury article under the heads
' of "Service, Snooping, and Evangel
ism." "Tho truth,"it declares, is thai
"in the colleges, the Y.M.C.A. makei
no converts and attracts no members
that were not its destined silage fron
birth. That is the whole explnnatioi
of its activities, its persistence, am
its half-dead odor. The audience o
faithful souls who are a Discussioi

Group on Monday night, become, on
Tuesday, a Religious Meeting. On
Wednesday these selfsame yearners
are a Bible Class and on Thursday
i they are an Open Forum."
Scoring other activities of the 'Y'
the writer claims: "The Association,
finding much college social life ab
horrent to Christian sensibilities, un
dertakes to provide clean entertain
ment. for the student body. Ilere it
, runs on an embarrassing rock. It could
make its best headway among the
discarded or ignored undergraduates."
But "the official literature urges the
wooing of the fraternities, with a
frank admission that their prestige is
the objective.
"When a collcgo man wants to apply
to a party the lowest synonym for
dud, he calls it a 'Y-hop'," the article
. continues.
