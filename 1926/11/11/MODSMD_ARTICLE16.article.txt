Football Show, the Ram's Head com
mittee under the direction of Gordon !
Davis, is fast shaping a definite pro
gram for the production. The final
cast selections will be announced Fri- 1
day.
Acts Selected
A general idea of the program in
ensemble may be obtained from men- j
tion of a few numbers which have ;
definitely been selected. First of these
is the one-act "Hamlet" farce, written
by Dave Lamson, former wielder of
the Hammer and Coffin mallet for •
Chaparral. Peggy Randall, Delmer
Daves, and Hal Boone, all cast mem- j
hers of past Stanford productions of ;
serious or comic nature, will appear
as Hamlets, wandering professors, and
Lorelei Lees, the latter substituing
for "Ophelia," in the Lamson drama j
written in the "Nize Baby" style of
Milt Gross. Lamson has also origi
nated a unique mystery drama, known
as the "Ah Choo Mystery," -which
takes an important place on the "Gaie
ties" program.
Apotheosis of Jazz
The very epitome of jazz will be
offered in "Americana," with Byron
Harvey and Kathleen Fitz in dancing
and vocal numbers. Jean Wakefield,
mainstay of past "Gaieties" and other
Dramatic Council productions, has
composed the accompaniment for this
number, while Phil Brooks and his
orchestra will do the musical honors.
Miss Wakefield and Allan Campbell
will appear in a double piano act with
the choruses, while Peggy Randall and
A 1 Cass are working out a little act
all their own. Numbers from the
; "Music Box Review" and "Vanities,"
New York musical comedies, will also
i
be incorporated, while a novel situa-
S tion is created in a mock trial'of Man
before a jury, audience, attorneys, and
judge composed entirely and exclu
-1 sively of women.
The choruses have been working for
the past ten days under the direction
of Chrysella Kiler, allowing practically
three weeks' training for their entries.
Tickets for the "Gaieties" will be
placed on sale next week.
