Varsity soccer teams of the Univer
sity of California and Stanford meet
on the local field this afternoon at 3:30
o'clock in the first encounter of the
annual three-game intercollegiate
series, with the veteran Blue and Gold
eleven favorites at the start.
The Bears bring to the Stanford
campus this afternoon an eleven
which, by virtue of its 1-1 tie with
the powerful Olympic Club outfit last
week, leads the teams of the Univer
sity and Club Soccer League for 1926.

field in the 1925 series, augmented by
stars of last year's freshman team, will
face the Cards this afternoon.
While' entering as under-dog, the
Stanford eleven, led by Captain Bob
Bailard, is said to be primed for one
of its best performances of the year.
Admonished by Coach Harry W. Ma
loney, before his departure for the
East yesterday morning, to inject into
their play all the power they possess,
the Redshirts take their positions this
afternoon ready 1rÂ» continue the game
scrap they put up in their 1-0 1 defeat in
a practice game Tuesday.
Actual experience, too, favors to
day's invading team, whose defense
lias been its chief claim as favorite,
but a fast-charging line has main
tained as balanced offense.
The Stanford team, more or less in
experienced, embraces a tricky for
ward combination centered around
Captain Bailard at center forward and
including Rivero, Farwell, and Cole
man as its mainstays. Cannon, at left
half, specializes in offensive tactics,
too.
