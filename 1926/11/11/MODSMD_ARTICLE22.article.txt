### Frank Mittauer 
Tonight at 8:15"in the University
Assembly Hall, Marcel Grandjany,
j harpist, with Denise Daverni, soprano,
open the fifteenth annual concert
series of the Peninsula Musical Asso
ciation.
The organization has been particu
larly fortunate in securing an appear
ance of Grandjany for the opening re
cital, for hte artist, besides being one
of the few concert musicians who uso
fhe harp as a medium of expression,
is acclaimed by some critics to be
j the greatest harp virtuoso in the world
I today.
Contemporary Compositions
Grandjany's three groups of solos
! will be made up for the most part of
: contemporary French selections, al
i though a few numbers by composers
1 of the eighteenth century will also be
â–  played.
Among the modern numbers Grand
i iany's own composition, "Fairy Tale,"
is worthy of particular note, as is the
"Ballade Fantastique" of Renie, based
on Edgar Allan Poe's story, "The Tell-
Tale Heart." Another modern French
composer is represented on the pro
gram in Tr. Dubois' "Les Myrtilles."
| Dubois, best known for his organ com
positions, was, until his recent death,
I head of the Paris Conservatoire.
Debussy Represented
Claude Debussy's "Arabesque" is of
! interest as a harp number. This com
! poser is also represented on the pro
; gram by three songs which are to be
i sung by Miss Daverni in her first solo
I group. These are "Les Cloches," "Beau
Soir," and "Green."
Medieval Song Scheduled
Miss Daverni's second group is
headed by an authentic fifteenth-cen-
I tury French song, "Amour do Moi."
' "La Lettre du Jardinier" and "Claire
de Lune," are by Marcel Tournier,
whose "Feerie" will be played earlier
i in the evening by Grandjany.
Season memberships to the Penin
| sula Association Concert Series may
still be obtained at Crandall's in Palo
