# Honor Stanford's Heroes
## 
### 
Cardinal red is the color of Stanfordâ€”and cardinal red was the blood
of her heroic sons, the blood that was shed so extravagantly some six
years ago, along with that of the fighting men of all the world. Just six
years ago today came the word that the shedding of that blood had
ceased.
So it is that we gather in the Memorial Church this morning to pay
homage to those men, our predecessors, who laid down their lives in the
belief that they were making our lot better.
1 112 there be a lesson to be learned on Armistice Day from the example
of those men it is this, lhey had a high ideal, and they were willing to
do anything for that ideal, even to the point of dying for it. We are
not so unfortunate as to be faced with the prospect of dying for our
ideals. Our task is much easier. We must simply live for ours.
But we, too, can do something to contribute to the honor and glory
that is Stanford's. What little it may be let us do it well. For it is only
thus that we may be worthy of Stanford's dead, those heroes of the war.
