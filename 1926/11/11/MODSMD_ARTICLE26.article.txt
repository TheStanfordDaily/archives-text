Following his recital in tlie basketball pavilion, the opening" event
of the first annual Stanford Concert Series, Louis Graveure made some
interesting- and pertinent comments to Wilfrid Davis, originator and
manager of the series. Mr. Graveure is a veteran of the concert plat
form ; his engagements have taken him all over the country and include
many appearances before eastern college audiences, so he doubtless knows
whereof he speaks.
"Your concert series here is on a grander scale than anything
similar ever attempted elsewhere, to the best of my knowldge," was
Graveure's declaration. "I have had opportunity, not only to look over
the class of artists engaged in the comparatively few college concert
series, but to sing as an artist in most of them. Not one has an auditorium
with the seating capacity and excellent acoustics of your basketball
pavilion. In the many lectures which 1 give each year I wlil most cer
tainly point to the enterprise here at Stanford as the greatest thing of
its kind in the country."
It is, in fact, a great credit to the school as a whole that, springing
into being almost suddenly, as the series did, a program was arranged
which will bear comparison with any metropolitan artist series. There
is an almost unique absence of what is known in the parlance of musical
circles as "fillers"—relatively inferior concerts included to "pad out,"
while the one or two really worthwhile events have to carry all the rest.
Our five events are all the "real thing."
We may perhaps be excused for "pointing with pride" to what is
really a creditable undertaking—and the parent of many more similar
undertakings—the First Annual Stanford Concert Series.
