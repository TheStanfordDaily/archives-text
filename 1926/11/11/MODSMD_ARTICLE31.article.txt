### The King 
The Chinese tongs patched up a
solemn and eternal truce the other
day and then shot it full of holes after
less than twelve hours. Splendid; the
best European diplomacy could have
done no better!
* • *
Why don't the tongs get Weigel and
"Dee" Tallman as peacemakers? See
what that pair did for Stanford and
Southern California.
* * «
Why not get the Board of Athletic
Control to encourage some of those
tongmen to come here?
* * *
How quaintly satisfying it would be
to have an assistant announce that
the history midquarter would be post
poned indefinitely because the profes
sor and one of the oriental students
had gotten into an unfortunate argu
ment over the exact birthday w of Henrv
the Third.
» * *
And if everybody carried an auto
matic how much simpler and to the
point would be the discussions of
policy in faculty meetings.
♦ * *
Headlines announce the U. S. Will
Probe Charges of an Oil Trust Headed
by Standard and Shell.
You'd think after the Sinclair affair
that the government would just pick
on Italian bootleggers and foreign
radicals and not try to play rough
with the big boys.
* * *
The city of Oakland put on a Dairy

Circus of which one of the main at
tractions was $100,000 worth of cow."
Our local bull was too busy in Palo
Alto and nearby peninsula points to
attend the Oakland sessions.
* * *
Prince Nicolas of Roumania, son of
the tactful Marie, visited the Univer
sity of Washington and remarked:
"This damn American trip is getting
on my nerves."
We don't remember of even inviting
him.
* * *
California has given Oregon Aggies
a shell in which to train a racing crew.
Washington is going to give them an
other.
Such intercollegiate co-operation
seems a wonderful idea. We suggest
the Athletic Board send a football up
to Berkeley, or perhaps two.
'£ •
Tokyo professors are organizing a
new political party with a platform of
political honesty.
Those radical ideas may be all right
for Japan but they'd never work in
this country.
* * *
This is Children's Book Week.
Well, we've got a .couple of calculus
texts the children are welcome to.

FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY
Cabbages Avowed:
It's just as Damon said to Pythias,
"I know she's a clean girl, because I
saw the soap behind her ears."
