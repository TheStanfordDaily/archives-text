Many worthwhile institutions on |
this campus have been lulled by com
ments in the newspaper. The latest
attempt to kill something which is es
sential to the survival of the Stanford
Spirit is typified in the article appear
ing iust before the U.S.C. game in the
"Bull Session" on rallies. Is there any
reason why this sort of thing should
be tolerated?
Why shouldn't the student body turn
out en masse to a rally? Yelling has a
certain psychological effect on people,
which gets them in the right mental
attitude for athletic contests. Before |
the U.S.C. rally, many of us were of
the opinion that the team might not
win. After the rally we changed our
minds. We got behind them, and they
amassed just enough points to win.
At that rally the representation
among the campus men was atrocious.
The freshmen were there in full force, j
The women had the largest representa
tion to their numbers. If the older men
on the campus will not turn out for
rallies, it isn't fair to the freshmen, j

It gives them a wrong idea of Stanford
Spirit—the spirit which never lies
down and quits but achieves the goal,
despite all difficulties. Don't let it die
out! We have a crying need for it.
Don't let us get to the point of
sophistication on this campus where
we can't be bothered with such a puer
ile thing as "college spirit." Sophisti
cation seems to be the ultimate aim
of the age, and it's the worst possi
ble thing for the race. It kills original
ity and suppresses enthusiasm —two
of the essentials of progress. Why let
it permeate this campus? We don't
need it, and we don't want it!
We sincerely hope that the sophisti
cated attitude of the "Bull Session"
will have no effect on the attendance
at the Washington Rally tonight.
