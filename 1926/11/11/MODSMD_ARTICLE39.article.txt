# OREGON AGGIES PLAY U.S.C. AT PORTLAND IN CRUCIAL CONTEST
## Wins by U.S.C., Stanford Will Cinch Pacific Coast Title for Cards 
### George W. Story 
The football championship of the
Pacific Coast Conference may be de
cided in the Multnomah Civic Stadium
in Portland this afternoon when the
Trojans of Southern California lfne up
again√üt the Aggies of Oregon. Not
that these two tdams are the leading
contenders for the honors, but the
outcome of the game will go a long
way toward determining the winner
of the 1926 title.
U.S.C., Card Victories Needed
If U.S.C. wins and Stanford beats
Washington Staturday it looks as
though the Cardinals were going to

be flying the con
ference flag for the
coming year, but if
the Aggies win
they will have a
better claim to the
championship than
Stanford because
they will have
played five confer
ence games to the
Redshirts' four.
That is, if they

don't lose to Oregon, which they
should not according to comparative j
scores.
Heavy Scoring by Aggies
In five games this year Coach Paul !
Schissler's men have piled up 169 |
points to their opponents' 13. The Tro- j
jans have made 199 units and have I
had 25 tallied against them in six con- '
tests. However, neither team has met
an eleven which has formed opposi
tion for tlie other, so there is no way
to draw a definite comparison between
the two.
Roth teams lia/e had a good rest
since their last contests. The Trojans
played Stanford a week ago last Sat
urday and have been resting and point
ing to today's game ever since, and
the same holds true of the Oregonians,
except that they battled Idaho rather
than Stanford eleven days ago.
Squads Seem Equal
Man for man the rival squads seam
about equal. There is speed and de
ception in either backfield and both j
lines have plenty of power. Reports !
from the North state that Williams, j
Kaer, Drury, and Laraneta will start
in the backfield for the Southerners, i
while Maple, Jarvis, Luby, and Schul- j
merich will be the ball-carriers for the
Orangemen. These combinations ap
pear to be about evenly matched.
Cravath versus Balcom
Of especial interest to the fans will
be the battle between Captain Jeff
Cravath of U.S.C. and Lloyd Ralcom of
the Aggies. Cravath was named All-
Coast pivot man last season, but this
year Ralcom has been playing the
brand of ball that makes him a possi
bility for the honors this fall. Ralcom,
who stands G feet 5 inches tall, is
one of the most colorful centers on the
coast.
Another struggle of linesmen which
should be well worth witnessing will
be the one between Hippo Dickerson,
the 220-pound tackle of the Northern
ers, and Jess Hibbs, the sophomore
sensation of the Herd. These two ath
letes are ranked among the best on
the Pacific Slope at their position.
Trojans Under Handicap
Dope favors the Trojans today be
cause of their power shown in previ
ous games, but the fact that they are
playing on a sawdust field, which is j
over 1000 miles from their home, j
against an unbeaten team which is |
fighting to keep its record unstained,
practically offsets their advantage on
paper. It looks like an even bet, with
either team liable to win and both al
most certain to score.
