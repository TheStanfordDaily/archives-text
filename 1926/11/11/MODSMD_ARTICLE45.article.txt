# COACH BAGSHAW IS VETERAN MENTOR OF COAST CONFERENCE
## Washington Elevens Possess Good Record Made in Past Five Years 
### Henry Clock 
Coach Enoch Bagshaw, mentor of
the invading Washington football
team, is the oldest football coach in
point of service in the Pacific Coast
Conference. For five years Bagshaw
has instructed the football teams at
the University of Washington, coming
there in 1921 from Everett High
School where he turned out two sec
tional championship teams and one
American interscholastic champion
ship team. While at Washington Bag
shaw has been equally successful.
Last year he put forth a team which
Wrtrj 112 Xifi Pjj r * J'IOV.ffiK'VXCP hvi
lost a hard post-season game to Ala
bama on New Year's Day. Few teams
have defeated the Washington eleven
since Bagshaw took charge, while
teams from California and Stanford
have both lost to the Huskies.
Coached Wilson
George Wilson, ail-American half
back, was coached by Bagshaw
throughout his high school and college
careers. Elmer Tesreau, who was
placed on several ail-American teams,
was also coached by Bagshaw. This
year Guttormson and Patton, both
backfield men for Washington, are
candidates for mythical all-conference
and all-American teams.
Warner a Veteran
"Pop" Warner, having served three
years as active coach and five years
as advisory coach, is next to Bagshaw
in service on the coast. However, War
ner has coached football for thirty-one
years, having been coach at Pittsburgh
and Carlisle before coming to Stan
ford. Little needs to be said of War
ner's record or fame.
In his three years here, he has lost
but one conference game, one practice
game, and one post-season game.
Washington, Olympic Club, and Notre
Dame are the teams which have de
feated Cardinal elevens coached by
Pop.
Schissler at O.A.C.
Coach Paul Schissler, coach at Ore
gon Agricultural College, has also
served three years on the coast.
Schissler came to O.A.C. from Notre

j Dame in 1923. His teams at Oregon
have been good, and this year his team
is undefeated to date and has the
fourth highest scoring total in the
i
country.
At U.S.C. Coach Howard Jones has
had charge for two years, previously
' having coached at the University of
lowa and before that at Syracuse.
Teams coached by Jones at U.S.C.
have been the best that have ever
come from there, although they have
1 been stopped from a championship
for both years by Warner teams. At
present, U.S.C. has the highest scor
ing total of any team in the country.
Five New Coaches
The rest of the teams in the con
ference, California, Oregon, Washing
ton State, Idaho, and Montana, have
new coaches this year.
At California, "Nibs" Price is serv
' ing his first year. Taking the team
under difficult circumstances, Price is
developing a powerful eleven at Cali
fornia. Previous to his appointment as
successor to Andy Smith, Price served
for seven years as assistant coach of
football and head coach of basketball.
He came from San Diego High before
taking up coach's duty at Berkeley.
Hollingberry Good
"Babe" Hollingberry, former Olym
i pic Club player and coach, is now
engaged in his first year as coach at
Washington State College and is mak
ing an exceptional record. The team's
only defeat was at the hands of U.S.C.,
while it did the unexpected and de
feated Washington University 9 to 6
earlier in the season. Hollingberry's
development of a powerful team from
mediocre material is one of the sen
| sations of the season.
Captain J. J. McEwan, who formerly
coached the Army team at West Point,
is now head coach at Oregon. With
only fair material, McEwan has pro
duced a team which has won more
than half its games, among them being
j one with California.
Charlie Erb, former California play
er and member of the "Wonder" team,
has gone from coach at Nevada to
Idaho where he has a good team this
year. Montana was defeated in an
early game by the Vandals, and both
Washington and Washington State
have had hard games before defeating
Erb's team.
