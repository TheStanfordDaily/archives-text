# ELMAN QUARTET TO BE ATTRACTION FOR STUDENTS' CONCERT
## 
### 
Mischa Elraan's string quartet, one
of the finest organizations of its sort
i?i the musical world, will give a re
cital in the next of the Associated
Students of Stanford University Con
cert Series, to be held in the basket
ball pavilion next Tuesday, November
16.
Few string ensembles have been so
well received by critics as has this
quartet, which was organized by
Mischa Elman, himself one of the
greatest violinists of our time.
Mr. Elman's confreres in the quar
tet are Edwin Bachman, second violin;
William Schubert, viola; and Horace
Britt, 'cello. The three have been
known in the concert field as solo art
ists as well as members of noteworthy
string ensembles.
So great has been the success of
the oganization that Elman has de
cided to spend all his 192G-27 Ameri
can season in appearance with the
quartet. This being the case, Elman
will make no recital appearance here
as a soloist until 1929-30.
