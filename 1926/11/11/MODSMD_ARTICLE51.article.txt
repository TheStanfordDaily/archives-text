# STANFORD STUDENTS INTERESTED IN ARTS, DECLARES P.A. TIMES
## 
### 
That students at Stanford are tak
ing an increased interest in the cre
ative arts, such as music and good
drama, is the assertion of the Daily
Palo Alto Times in a recent editorial.
Those defending the modern colle
jgians from the attacks of outsiders,
xvho see only selfish commercialism in
present-day education, are heartened
by this unsolicited and unbiased sup
port.
In part, the Palo Alto paper says:
"The opportunities offered for creative
and interpretative artistic: expression
have been quietly increasing under
the pressure of student demand.
"Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, finds that the attendance at
organ recitals Is increasing, that there
is a growing interest m the
of music and musical culture, and that
the desire for good music is becoming
more general as well as more intense.
"This is reflected in the fact that
the students have on their own initia
tive, sponsored this year a series of
concerts by artists of the first rank.
The day has passed when Palo Alto,
with an augmentation of nearby penin
sulans, furnished the entire audience
at all University events of a 'high
brow' nature.
"Another phase of the artistic awak
ening is seen in the realm of drama.
It has become a serious pursuit,
worthy of serious study. Its result, or
its corollary, has been an amazing im
provement in the type of production
seen 011 the University stage and a
widening circle of patrons of Univer
sity plays."
Discussing the probable cause, the j
editorial suggests: "At Stanford, it'
may easily be credited to the stringent
scholarship restrictions and the ten
dency toward elimination of the lower
division, as both result in limiting the
student body lo the exceptional few."
