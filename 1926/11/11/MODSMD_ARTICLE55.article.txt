# NOVEMBER ISSUE OF ILLUSTRATE REVIEW ON CAMPUS FRIDAY
## 
### 
The November Stanford Illustrated
Review, which will be published to
morrow, corrects a misstatement con
cerning Stanford athletics made by
Coach Amos A. Stagg in the Novem
ber 6 issue of the Saturday Evening
Post. Stagg, who is football coach and
athletic director at the University of
Chicago, is publishing a series of arti
cles in the Saturday Evening Post on
the subject of football under the title
of "Touchdown," and in this particular
article says that at Stanford athletics
are run by the Associated Students
with a graduate manager as executive.
Dewlaney Has Article
In the Illustrated Review, Barbara
Dewlaney's article on "The Rosses of
the Rig Game" gives accurate informa
tion about the of n+h
letics at Stanford. It points out that
the Stanford Roard of Athletic Con
trol, which is composed of three repre
sentatives each from the faculty, the
alumni, and the students, is a co-oper
ative committee whicfc runs athletics
and provides facilities*, therefor, and
has been functioning since 1916.
Mistakes Corrected
There is 110 longer any Graduate
Manager but a General Manager, who
is the appointee of the Roard, and
functions with the treasurer of the
Roard in the administration of all
financial matters. The Director of
Physical Training is the executive of
ficer of the Roard. All actions of the
Roard are subject to the approval of
the President of the University and
the minutes of all meetings are filed
in his office.
A faculty committee on athletics
still exists but its functions consist
merely of approving the schedule of
games and certifying to the academic
eligibility of team members. It has
nothing to do with matters of finance
or employment in the control of out
side athletics.
Other Errors
Another error in Stagg's article
win is collected in the Illustrated
Review article, concerns the method
of appointment and standing of ath
letic coacues at Stanford. He says:
I"I am the athletic chief executive,
answerable to the president of the uni
versity. That state of affairs prevails
today outside of Harvard, Princeton,
Yale, California, Stanford, and a few
other colleges."
The fact is that Coach Glenn War
ner is appointed to the faculty in
exactly the same way as any other
professor in the University: by the
trustees on the recommendation of
the President. He is a member of the
Academic Council and as such is an
swerable to the President. He is as
much a member of the faculty at
Stanford as Coach Stagg is at the Uni
versity of Chicago.
