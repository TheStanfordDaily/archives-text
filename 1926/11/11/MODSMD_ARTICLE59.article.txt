# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
No Armistice Day sports drawing
would be complete without a tribute
to the many football stars who gave
up their lives for an even greater
cause than winning for their Alma
Mater.
Among the great athletes of the
i gridiron who "Went West" in the
Great War was "Hobey" Raker, of
; Princeton, captain of the 1924 Tiger
[ varsity. liobey's fame as an ice hockey
j player is so great that it overshadows
j his ability in football, and, although
: he was the most sensational rink star
who ever chased a puck for an Ameri
, can university, he was almost as great
| in football.
Hobey, besides being a dazzling
runner and kicker, was an inspiring
j leader and seemed to have that inborn
: athletic instinct which enabled him
| to do the right thing at the right time.
I Among his gridiron achievements was
: a drop-kick goal against Yale from
the 43-yard line, and a 46-yard place-

Kick against Holy Cross, both in 1913.
It is little wonder that Hobey en
j listed for service, after showing such
fighting qualities on the rink and grid
iron. Aviation appealed most to his
, sporting blood.' and he joined the
Lafayette Escadrille, later being made
I commander of the 141st aero squad
; ron. After some remarkable flying ex
: ploits over the lines during the war.
Hobey Baker was killed in an acci
dent while making a practice flight at
Toul on December 26, 191 S.
Another famous Princeton football
star who died in service was Johnnie
Poe, '95, one of Old Nassau's greatest
quarterbacks. Johnnie Poe, one of the
six Princeton Poes, was killed in ac
tion with the Black Watch near Loos
i in 1915. It is said that he met his
death while rushing forward in an at
tack and that, as he charged low over
j the ground amid the flying bullets and
bursting shrapnel, he called out his
old Princeton signal numbers!
