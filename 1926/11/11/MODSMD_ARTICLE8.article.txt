# LONDON'S BISHOP BELIEVES RELIGION IS WORLD'S HOPE
## 
### 
"It has been truly said that every
man has to be his own Columbus and
lind the continent of truth," stated
the Right Reverend Arthur Foley Win
nington-Ingram, D.D., Lord Bishop of
London, in his address to the student
; body on "Why I am a Christian" in
; Memorial Church yesterday morning.
: He stated that Christianity is the one
hope of the world today.
Bishop Ingram urged the necessity
of true Christians instilling a spirit of
love and trust in the people to re
place the hatred and spite which is so
prevalent. Only in this way can the
world be saved.
Thinks Youth the Same
Bishop Ingram does not consider
that the young people of today are
different from those of forty years
1 ago, because human nature does not
change. They need religion now as
much as they did then. The efficacy of
religious faith was proven during the
| war when the young men who stuck
to their religion came back from the
ordeal stronger than when they went
j out, while the others went under. "I
believe that our difficulties as to faith
; in God come not from any concrete

I reason, but from our wanton imagina
| tion," he said.
Giving a resume of the work of the
| church, he particularly cited the ef
| forts made in the London police
courts, and in Africa and India, where
the church was requested by those in
authority to keep up its work.
Claims Church Divinely Established
Justifying the Church and the Sacra
! ment, Bishop Ingram said: "The
' Churrh »« Integra! part c! the pfoiv
of God. People would never have heard
of Christ except for the Church. The
Church wrote and collected the Bible,
and it brings the Bible to us. The Sac
rament depends entirely on the person
i behind the Sacrament, who lends
j validity to it."
! Bishop Ingram attempted to answer
! five questions which had been pro
ponded to him by five students in the
American universities which he has
been visiting.
Religion Accepts Science
Answering the query as to whether
I or not there is any contradiction be
, tween science and religion, he said
| that there is none. Biology teaches
the science of evolution. Religion ac
cepts all that science has found ant
attempts to go where science stops
The Bible says that God gave mai
that which makes him a man. At som<
certain point in the process of evolu
tion the Divine Spirit was put iut<
the animal which became man.
The Church does not oppose labor
claims Bishop Ingram. It is independ
ent enough to. stand for justice an<
fair-dealing for all and works to thii
end.
Church Opposes War
Concerning the question of th<
Church believing in war, he declarec
that the whole Christian church is ai
firmly resolved as ever to preven
any future wars. In the last war i
joined in because national dislionoi
would be worse than war.
Doubt Is Not Wrong
"To doubt is not wrong," declarec
Bishop Ingram, in answering the las
question. "There if! nothing wrong ii
honest doubt, so long as you are reallj
trying to get rid of it. Pray for ligh
and it will be given to you."
