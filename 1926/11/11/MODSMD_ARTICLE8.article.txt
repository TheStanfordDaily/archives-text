## 
### 
"It has been truly said that every
man has to be his own Columbus and
lind the continent of truth," stated
the Right Reverend Arthur Foley Win
nington-Ingram, D.D., Lord Bishop of
London, in his address to the student
; body on "Why I am a Christian" in
; Memorial Church yesterday morning.
: He stated that Christianity is the one
hope of the world today.
Bishop Ingram urged the necessity
of true Christians instilling a spirit of
love and trust in the people to re

prevalent. Only in this way can the
world be saved.
Thinks Youth the Same
Bishop Ingram does not consider
that the young people of today are

believe that our difficulties as to faith

Giving a resume of the work of the
| church, he particularly cited the ef
| forts made in the London police
courts, and in Africa and India, where
the church was requested by those in
authority to keep up its work.
Claims Church Divinely Established

' Churrh »« Integra! part c! the pfoiv
of God. People would never have heard
of Christ except for the Church. The
Church wrote and collected the Bible,
and it brings the Bible to us. The Sac
rament depends entirely on the person
i behind the Sacrament, who lends
j validity to it."
! Bishop Ingram attempted to answer
! five questions which had been pro
ponded to him by five students in the
American universities which he has
been visiting.
Religion Accepts Science
Answering the query as to whether
I or not there is any contradiction be
, tween science and religion, he said
| that there is none. Biology teaches
