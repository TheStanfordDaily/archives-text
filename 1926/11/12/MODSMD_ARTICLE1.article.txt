# TOLERANCE TO ALL ADVOCATED BY DR. JORDAN
## Impersonal Hate Described As Most Unprofitable Of Human Thoughts DISCUSSES INQUISITION Treat Fellow Men Kindly Even if Views Differ Says Speaker 
### 
"I try to be tolerant to all—even to
those who make freshmen wear silly
looking caps when they go to a uni
versity."
With this statement, Dr. David Starr
Jordan concluded his Thursday evening
lecture last night at his home on the topic
of "Intolerance." Touching first on the
general subject of Armistice Day and
war ni general, he said, "Impersonal
hate is the most unprofitable of all hu
man thought; do not despie a hateful
man — he has enough trouble of his
own."
Discussing intolerance as a personal
characteristic, Dr. Jordan said that "it
is better to be tolerant than to be right,
because you can be right later. When a
man is sure he is right there's no hope
for him.
"Intolerance will go a long way when
it has full swing; it is only slowly that
we can get rid of it. Think as you will
about a man's policies, but do not be
intolerant toward the man himself; treat
your fellow-men kindly ewen if their
opinions differ from your own."
Religious intolerance started with the
introduction of Christianity, according to
Dr. Jordan. The early Romans tolerated
any religious beliefs; that is, they had
no official intolerance until they found it
politically useful. When Paul and Bar
nabas introduced Christianity, however,
the Romans turned their intolerance from
politics to religion and persecuted all
who dared to oppose their beliefs.
"This led," continued Dr. Jordan, "to
the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions
of the Middle Ages, whose purpose was
to purify religion by burning all heretics
and people suspected of not adhering to
the Catholic church. During this time
about 300,000 witches were destroyed in
hurope; and the spirit which moved the
church to behead such men as John
Knox and leading Anabaptists culmi
nated in the statement of one of the
Portuguese inquisitors that 'we might
as well kill them all (accused heretics)
because the Lord will know the differ
ence anyway.' I litis the whole spirit of
Christianity was lost when sects began
to argue and laziness and ignorance pre
dominated."
Beginning with Voltaire in France,
said Dr. Jordan, intolerance lessened ap
preciably; and with a general coming to
their senses, people gradually passed into
a state of milder criticism which is now
evident only in regard to such questions
as labor and the World Court.

any religious beliefs; that is, they had
no official intolerance until they found it
politically useful. When Paul and Bar
nabas introduced Christianity, however,
the Romans turned their intolerance from
politics to religion and persecuted all
who dared to oppose their beliefs.
"This led," continued Dr. Jordan, "to
the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions
of the Middle Ages, whose purpose was
to purify religion by burning all heretics
and people suspected of not adhering to
the Catholic church. During this time
about 300,000 witches were destroyed in
hurope; and the spirit which moved the
church to behead such men as John
Knox and leading Anabaptists culmi
nated in the statement of one of the
Portuguese inquisitors that 'we might
as well kill them all (accused heretics)
because the Lord will know the differ
ence anyway.' I litis the whole spirit of
Christianity was lost when sects began
to argue and laziness and ignorance pre
dominated."
Beginning with Voltaire in France,
said Dr. Jordan, intolerance lessened ap
preciably; and with a general coming to
their senses, people gradually passed into
a state of milder criticism which is now
evident only in regard to such questions
as labor and the World Court.
"I try to be tolerant to all—even to
those who make freshmen wear silly
looking caps when they go to a uni
versity."
With this statement, Dr. David Starr
Jordan concluded his Thursday evening
lecture last night at his home on the topic
of "Intolerance." Touching first on the
general subject of Armistice Day and
war ni general, he said, "Impersonal
hate is the most unprofitable of all hu
man thought; do not despie a hateful
man — he has enough trouble of his
own."
Discussing intolerance as a personal
characteristic, Dr. Jordan said that "it
is better to be tolerant than to be right,
because you can be right later. When a
man is sure he is right there's no hope
for him.
"Intolerance will go a long way when
it has full swing; it is only slowly that
we can get rid of it. Think as you will
about a man's policies, but do not be
intolerant toward the man himself; treat
your fellow-men kindly ewen if their
opinions differ from your own."
Religious intolerance started with the
introduction of Christianity, according to
Dr. Jordan. The early Romans tolerated
any religious beliefs; that is, they had
no official intolerance until they found it
politically useful. When Paul and Bar
nabas introduced Christianity, however,
the Romans turned their intolerance from
politics to religion and persecuted all
who dared to oppose their beliefs.
