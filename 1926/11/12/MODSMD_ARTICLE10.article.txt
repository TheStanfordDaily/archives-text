"Play with confidence and abandon
and don't stop to practice during the
game. In other words, don't keep on
running after you've caught your car."
In the above manner Dr. Harry P.
Reynolds, '06, advised the team how
best to play for victory in the Wash
ington game. I)r. Reynolds was the
chief speaker on the program of last
night's rally in the pavilion. About
1300 rooters swarmed over the floor
of the big gym and cheered wildly at
all such sentiments, sustaining their
enthusiasm for a full two hours, while
speakers, musicians, and yell-leaders
kept cheers and applause volleying.
The four necessary qualities of a
footbyll team were declared by Dr.
Reynolds to be: physical material, of
which Stanford has the best in years;
brains; a coach, Pop Warner and his
staff being the best this side of Meso
potamia, he says; and, finally, fighting
spirit, for in 35 years of football Stan
ford teams have fought better with
their backs, rather than their faces,
to the wall.
The highlight of the rally in the
line of entertainment was tho chalk
talk delivered by James Swinnerton,

cartoonist, of Palo Alto. The creator
of "Little Jimmy" began his act with
a drawing of a growling husky dog.
The following cftrtoon showed a little
Stanford Indian "unfurling the curl" in
the tail of a much-surprised and pained
dog. Other studies in contrast helped
to make popular the innovation in
rally entertainment.
Coach "Doc" Roles, of Wooster Uni
versity, Ohio, was on hand to give
his idea of how the varsity will play
1 Saturday. Roles has been an unoffi
j eial observer and adviser of the team
jail season. lie stressed the fact that
active support is necessary before the
varsity can emerge victorious Novem
ber 20 with the first Pacific Coast
Championship Stanford has ever had.
Cal Conron, chairman of the Rally
Committee, presided over the pro
grain and introduced the speakers and
entertainers. "Doc" Mareno's String
Serenaders made a great hit.. Sam K.
Poepoe, n new member of the trio,
sang a Hawaiian song for an encore.
Norman Larson's orchestra rendered
"Satic Struck" and "Idolizing" with
eclat, while Richard McCurdy proved
a "find" ns one of the campus' coming
hanioists.
