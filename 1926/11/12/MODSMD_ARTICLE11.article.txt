# CARDINAL ONLY TEAM LEFT UNDEFEATED IN PACIFIC CONFERENCE
## Rain Increase May Reduce Stanford's Chances to Remain at Top 
### George Story 
Stanford is the only undefeated
team in the 1926 Pacific Coast Confer
ence football race. The University of
Southern California removed the Ore
gon Aggies from the select circle yes
terday by beating them 17 to 7 at Port- |
land, so the Cardinals are now resting
alone on the top cf the percentage j
column with two wins and no losses.
The Aggies, until yesterday, had been
victorious in three contests and had
not dropped an>, but the Trojans,
much to the enjoyment of Stanford
supporters, halted their march.
The Cards, if they win from Wash- i
ington tomorrow and repeat against ;
California the following Saturday, will !
cinch the conference honors. The most |
important of these two games is the
struggle against the Huskies this j

week, for the Northerners are rated as '
stronger than the Golden Bears and
they have merited this rating by win- ;
ning from the Bruins.
Upon the Cardinals' showing tomor- j
row rests their chance of a champion- â– 
ship. On paper the Redshirts are a
better team than the Huskies and
should win. Some say they'll win by
two touchdowns, and others say by j
three.
More rain will bode ill to Pop War- j
ner's men. They are not often called
on to show their wares on a wet field, j
I while the Huskies play many of their
games on slippery gridirons and are
used to a little moisture. If there is no
more precipitation before Saturday
afternoon, however, the turf should
not be soft enough to handicap the
Redshirts.
Both teams are In good condition for
the contest. The Cardinal varsity has
had two weeks of rest since it met the
Trojans, while the Huskies, although
they played a game last Saturday, are
better off than they have been at any
time this year. They have Carroll,
flashy back from last year's frosh
team, back in the lineup. He has been
out with a broken hand for several
weeks but is ready to go again.
The other important conference
game Saturday features Washington
State and Oregon at Pullman. This
game looks like a victory for the
Cougars, and if they come through as
they are expected to they will be tied
with U.S.C. for second place.
Oregon is not pointing for the W.S.C.
g:" e but is spending its time prepar
ing to meet the Oregon Aggies a week
from tomorrow.
