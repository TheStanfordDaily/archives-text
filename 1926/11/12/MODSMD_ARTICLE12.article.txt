# FRESHMEN COMPLETE FOUNDATION WORK ON BRUIN FUNERAL PYRE
## 
### 
With the foundation of the Big
Game bonfire finished, the freshman
class yesterday started piling on ma
terial and by last night a height of
twenty-five feet had been reached. Ac
cording to Ken Milligan, chairman of
the committee, there is enough wood
on hand now at the base of the pyre
to build it to forty feet.
A carload and a half of railroad ties
were piled on for the base yesterday
and the committee has been promised
another carload today. As yet no suit
able means has been found to bring
the 10,000 boxes from San Jose. The
committee is trying to secure freight
cars to do the work.
The real tour of the campus and
countryside for faggots will start this
afternoon, according to Chester Ha
denfeldt, chairman of the collection
department. Sorority and fraternity
houses that have anything to contrib
ute are asked to leave it in an acces
sible place.
Women from Roble are co-operating
wit lithe workers and the guards who
will start tonight will be fed with
coffee awl doughnuts from 8 to 12
o'clock. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday
night they will serve all night.
The guarding will be divided up into
shifts of six hours, Edward R. Valen
tine, captain of the guards, said last
night. The freshmen are still zealous
about their statement to make this
fire the "biggest and best ever" and
the class has been turning out about
100 strong each afternoon.
