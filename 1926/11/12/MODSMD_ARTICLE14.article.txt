### JIM ADAMS 
With the Pacific Coast Conference title hinging on the results of the game, the
undc'fcated Stanford eleven will face its second crucial test of the season in the
form of the Washington Huskies tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in the
Stanford stadium. A Cardinal victory will leave only California as the final obsUicle
to overcome in Stanford's drive for the championship. If the Purple Tornado wins,
U.S.C. is virtually assured of the title on a percentage basis.

$ The Trojans' victory over Oregon
j Aggies removed the only other un
beaten team from the race and puts the
; task squarely up to the Red-Shirts to
i finish the season with a clean record by
beating first Washington, then Cali
j fornia.
Is Crucial Contest
This situation makes the contest to
morrow the most important one of the
i year for Western football. Regardless
!of the significance of the result, the
! meeting of these two powerful elevens
j bids to be a bitter tight because of
many other reasons.
Jn the first place Stanford is out to
revenge the defeat by Washington last
I year when the latter team put the Cards
; out the running l , for the jtille. The
Cardinals were about in the same po
| sition as they are this year, with a
victory over a strong Trojan outfit under
their belt and only the Huskies as a
: serious hurdle to take in order to give
them the championship. Bagshaw's men
held them last year by a 13-0 victory.
! Can they do it again tomorrow- That
is the question to which the Red-Shirts
i will endeavor to give a decisive and
i negative answer.
Then again by defeating the Cards
last season, Bagshaw did what no other
conference coach has done for three
| years. He beat a Warner coached team.
Pop Warner intends to even up the
score tomorrow.
Defeat Angers Huskies
Washington also has a few good rea
i sons for winning against the Red
j Horde. The last year's title holders
had the hammer brought down on them
this year by Washington State when
they were making another strong bid
for the championship. This defeat re
lieved them of considerable glory and
prestige and they would like nothing
better than to regain it by beating the
undefeated Cardinals.
The Huskies are fresh from a defeat
!of the Bears and are in a winning
frame of mind. Besides, Washington
always plays to win and to do this they
play hard, smashing football. Last
year they stopped Stanford's All
! American fullback when all other teams
failed. In short, they are a tough out-
J fit and don't care who knows it.
To meet this type of play Warner
; will put a team in the field who are in
j ideal condition and just as tough. The
! Cards are about at their peak. The de
j fense is playing aggressive football and
