### JIM ADAMS 
With the Pacific Coast Conference title hinging on the results of the game, the
undc'fcated Stanford eleven will face its second crucial test of the season in the
form of the Washington Huskies tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock in the
Stanford stadium. A Cardinal victory will leave only California as the final obsUicle
to overcome in Stanford's drive for the championship. If the Purple Tornado wins,
U.S.C. is virtually assured of the title on a percentage basis.

$ The Trojans' victory over Oregon
j Aggies removed the only other un
beaten team from the race and puts the
; task squarely up to the Red-Shirts to
i finish the season with a clean record by
beating first Washington, then Cali
j fornia.
Is Crucial Contest
This situation makes the contest to
morrow the most important one of the
i year for Western football. Regardless
!of the significance of the result, the
! meeting of these two powerful elevens
j bids to be a bitter tight because of
many other reasons.
Jn the first place Stanford is out to
revenge the defeat by Washington last
I year when the latter team put the Cards
; out the running l , for the jtille. The
Cardinals were about in the same po
| sition as they are this year, with a
victory over a strong Trojan outfit under
their belt and only the Huskies as a
: serious hurdle to take in order to give
them the championship. Bagshaw's men
held them last year by a 13-0 victory.
! Can they do it again tomorrow- That
is the question to which the Red-Shirts
i will endeavor to give a decisive and
i negative answer.
Then again by defeating the Cards
last season, Bagshaw did what no other
conference coach has done for three
| years. He beat a Warner coached team.
Pop Warner intends to even up the
score tomorrow.
Defeat Angers Huskies
Washington also has a few good rea
i sons for winning against the Red
j Horde. The last year's title holders
had the hammer brought down on them
this year by Washington State when
they were making another strong bid
for the championship. This defeat re
lieved them of considerable glory and
prestige and they would like nothing
better than to regain it by beating the
undefeated Cardinals.
The Huskies are fresh from a defeat
!of the Bears and are in a winning
frame of mind. Besides, Washington
always plays to win and to do this they
play hard, smashing football. Last
year they stopped Stanford's All
! American fullback when all other teams
failed. In short, they are a tough out-
J fit and don't care who knows it.
To meet this type of play Warner
; will put a team in the field who are in
j ideal condition and just as tough. The
! Cards are about at their peak. The de
j fense is playing aggressive football and
although not functioning absolutely
right, stopped the Thundering Herd, i
; All the difficulties in the offense have ;
been smoothed out and the Cards now
boast of an attack that equals any on 1
the coast.
Warner Makes Changes
Several changes in the line-up have!
been announced by Warner. By virtue
of hard vyork and brilliant performance, j
Sellman and Freeman have won the
right to answer the opening whistle, re-1
placing the veterans Poulson and Har
| ris. Lewis, the sophomore signal
1 caller, who turned in about the best i
j game at quarter seen here this year, [
! will start at the position tomorrow.
The other change will show Murphy
land Bogue filling the half back berths.
The remaining positions are tilled by
| the regulars who started the U. S. C.
'game; Shipkey and Walker at ends,
J Captain Swan and Robesky at guards,
| McCreery at center, and Hoffman at
| full.
Warner's attack will be most threat
j ening because of its diversity. Bogue
, and Murphy are the best pair for off
I tackle slants, although they are not lack
! ing much on end runs either. Hill and
Hyland, however, can be thrown in any
time to harass the ends, in addition to
being the most capable to handle an
aerial attack. Sims' and Wilton proved
their worth last Saturday and will be
J ready for call.
i Hoffman Should Gain
Hoffman ought to be good for con
j sistent yardage on line bucks and spin
| plays. The Huskies haven't Wilson
I and Elmer Tesereau to stop him like
| they had last year for Never's drives.
| The long passes of the big fullback
will also be a constant "terror to the
I Washington backs. One good feature
j of his playing lately has been his im
! provement in punting. Last Saturday
j his two kicks average about 50 yards.
The Huskies boast mostly of a strong
| defensive line which they believe is capa
' | blc of stopping the Red Horde. Their
■ I linesmen are chiefly veterans and very
' I few teams have crossed their goal line
this season. In fact, only 25 points
have been run up on the Northerners
to 160 against their opponents. Cook
is a member of the forward wall who
' may be very conspicuous tomorrow, for
against California last Saturday he was
■ called back to kick the two field goals
I which cinched the game for the Hus
! ikies.
Wilson, Tesreau Missing
i Bagshaw's offense is considerably
! weakened by the loss of his All-Amer
, ican half, George Wilson, and Elmer
: I Tesereau, 1925 captain. These two
! comprised practically the whole scoring
1 : power of the Purple eleven last season.
' | Patton, running mate of Wilson, is still
i playing, but he hardly approaches the
' ! latter as a half back. Louie Tesereau,
| brother to Elmer, is another out.->ianu.iig
: player at full, but he falls below the
I standard of his brother. The class of the
| backfield is really Captain Guttormsen,
who is slated as the best quarter-back
on the coast. Carroll is playing his first
year of varsity ball and hasn't had much
> chance to show his worth yet.
The mental attitude of the Stanford
players will be a big factor in the out

conic of the battle tomorrow. If they
tight like they did against the Trojans,
Stanford should win.
Warner gave his men a light signal
drill last night. They have not been
worked hard this week and the regu
lars have had a long lay-off since the
U. S. C. game, so they should be in
first class physical shape.
Washington is scheduled to take a
work out of the Stanford Stadium turf
tomorrow afternoon. They arrived
early this morning and are stopping at
San Jose.
