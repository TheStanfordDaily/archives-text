# Naval Academy Oarsmen Plan Duraluminum Shell
## 
### 
Nation-wide interest is being dis
played in a new type of eight-oared
1 shell which the Naval Academy oars
men are having constructed of duralu
minum, the same material used in the
framework of airships.
The Annapolis oarsmen are having
the new shell built at the Navy Yard
in Philadelphia and will give it a trial
trip this coming spring. Today, the
only types of shell that, have met with
any success are those with the paper
I and cedar wood "skins."
