The Washington Huskies are growling. They are hungry for an
other victory, and they prefer Stanford's carcass to any other on the
Pacific Coast, this year especially, because we arc rare meat.
At present the Huskies are tied up in San Jose, and they will not be
led onto the Stanford campus until a few hours before the game Satur
day. They will be allowed to run loose for a short time this afternoon
at Reed Field, just to allow them to limber up their stiff limbs after the
long trip from Seattle.
Washington is now in a four-cornered tie with Washington State,
0.A.C., and U.S.C., each having won three games and lost one. Wash
ington is determined to add Stanford to the list of teams that have met
one defeat this year. Bagshaw's band of Huskies have chased down
Idaho, Oregon, and California, but lost the scent when they started
after Washington State. The game with the boys from Pullman is the
only contest in which Washington has been the underdog, for the rest
of the matches the Huskies have demonstrated thoroughbred qualities.
The Huskies come to Stanford with the 1925 Coast Championship
pinned to their backs. This championship is a gift from the Cardinals
who presented them with the trophy after a little dispute in Seattle last
season. The championship is somewhat loose on the Huskies' backs, but
they haven't lost it yet. Should Washington win tomorrow, and then
win the rest of the games of the season, they would be tied with the
Trojans, provided they were victorious in the rest of their contests.
Stanford intends to act the "Indian giver" tomorrow and take back the
present of last year.
With the U.S.C.-O.A.C. game out of the way, the Washington-
Stanford contest is the big match on the coast this week-end. Washing
ton State plays Oregon in the only other conference match Saturday.
We intended to give Washington a real welcome, and make them
feel at home by providing a shower storm, but the dates were mixed
up somewhat and the rain came one day early.
