When Stanford students gathered in the Memorial Clutrch yesterday
morning for the Armistice Day services there was one small group
absent without choice—listening to the lecturer, taking few notes, and
moving uneasily in their chairs. Professorial absent-mindedness was
taking its toll.
One who is working hard on an hour's lecture is very apt to forget
the fact that his class is to be excused twenty minutes early. It is
regrettable that this group was unable to attend tiie services, but the
fact that their desire to be excused for the occasion caused so much
comment is significant.
Anyhow, the "absent-minded professor" assures us that he didn't
mean to do it.
