Spiritually the University seems as stairless as it is materially. It
is close to the ground of fact." Such is the brief statement of George
Marvin's opinion of Stanford student aspirations as he expresses it in
an article called "Stairless Stanford" appearing in the November 3
issue of The Outlook.
lie describes Stanford's architecture as unaspiring, saying "its growth
is lateral in one dimension, reaching out, hovering, brooding. There is
nothing high about it anywhere." Likening Stanford's physical plant
with her spiritual outlook, Marvin develops his theory that Stanford is
lacking in faith and aspirations, saying, "The buildings squat on the
Palo Alto farm and the personnel sits on the nest thus made, hatching
education."
Marvin forgets himself when he says "Stanford professes to value
quality before quantity. It pretends to regret its steadily growing
attendance and resents the impersonality of teaching which comes with
increased enrollment." The University neither "professes" nor "pre
tends" in its belief in these matters; it puts quality before quantity and
shows its regret of increasing enrollment by its strict entrance limita
tions.
Marvin's article is indeed a good example of impressionistic writing.
Nowhere in his article docs he prove that Stanford students lack aspira
tions. lie does not show that lie has talked to students to obtain their
views, in fact he shows quite clearly that he has entirely overlooked
student thought which is the only true criteria of aspirations.
