The Editor, Sir:
May I take space in your column to
protest against something contrary
to every ethical idea one would expect
to find in a university? I refer to the
con game methods of our saintly cam
pus Y.M.C.A.
I got a letter the other day saying
that if I didn't protest before a certain
date the Y.M.C.A. would ask my par
ents for a donation on the strength
of the fact that I am a student here.
I don't care so much personally —beg-
ging letters of that type generally find
a direct way to the paternal waste
basket —but 1 resent any organization
taking that liberty with-my name and
my home address, which I gave the
University for what I supposed were
official purposes.
It's just the same as if a magazine
agent demanded that I write him a
letter before a certain date or he
would send me a bill for a year's sub
scription.
Many of the fellows are working
their way through school, the parents
of many are unfamiliar with the high
nressure salesmanship of secretaries
who can devote their full time to get
ting money to pay their own salaries.
A letter from the campus Y to my
parents has the tacit assumption that
I approve of their begging and volun
tered my address. The truth may be
that I didn't know anything about it.
Notice that the Y here picks on the
new students, those who have no way
of knowing the kind of an organiza
tion it is and whose parents of course
l£now even less about it.
And, after awhile, if the secretaries
haven't raised their salaries by mail
I suppose they will come politely
around and impress the freshmen to
pledge donations to the "cause."
My older brother tells me quite in
teresting tales of the methods of the
ttVnnro w> have to
stand for them In the University too?
—A NEW STUDENT.
The Editor. Sir:
I am sure that every veteran of the
World War, resident in Stanford Uni
versity, joins me in thanking the com
mittee in charge of the Armistice Day
program for the impressive and touch
ing tribute to our comrades, paid in
the Memorial Church yesterday.
The noble hymn, the beautiful an
them, and the feeling rendering of
"taps" touched me deeply. The ex
luisite notes of that most beautiful
of all army calls recalled most vividly
to our minds the comrades who paid
the supreme sacrifice, whose torn and
broken bodies are now decaying in
foreign soil or nerrhnnr-p in more
congenial soil of our native land.
Those of us w.>o 'nate
enough to pass safely through the
ordeal are appreciative of your tribute.
Sincerely yours,

The editor, Sir:
In Thursday's "Daily," one of your
reporters quotes mc °
he typically H. L. Mcncken type of
article about the Y.M.C.A., whicn ap
pears in the "American Mercury" for
November. His quotation is partial, and
so a complete misrepresentation of my
utitudc toward the article, and that of
'llic Young Men's Christian Association
toward its task here.
What I stated to your reporter was
year ago, the Y.M.C.A. has not been
that since my arrival on the catnpus a

j interested in using old time evangelistic
methods. The officers have conceived
their task to be one of discovery and
practice of a new way of living, and as
; a search for power to live that way, as
Jesus did. They do not conceive of it in
terms of evangelism and conversion, as
the college man of today thinks of those
| words, out of the wave of Billy Sunday
ism that swept the country in his child
| hood. r lheir task is, however, evangel-
I istic in the highest and best sense of that
j word.
Mr. Dye's article in the "American
i Mercury" fails right at this point, too.
j He very evidently gathered his ideas on
the student Y.M.C.A. when he was a
I tutor in colleges some years ago, and hav
ing himself never progressed beyond the
! sophomoric stage, forgets that college
j life in general, including the Y.M.C.A.,
j is thinking in new terms. He goes to the
national year book of statistics (Imagine
| that as a real measure of the vitality of
ia movement!) and finding them still
i couched in the same terms as they were
I when he was in college, goes delightedly
jat the task of ridiculing the organiza
| tion. The very paucity of statistical re
sults should have warned him that the
national Bureau of Records of the gen
l eral Y.M.C.A. was not getting at the
| heart of the student work in its numeri-
I cal approach.
But I did not set out to answer in your
' columns Mr. Dye's article—merely to
I suggest that you instruct your reporters
to take careful notes when interviewing,
I and even on disputed points to submit
to those quoted statements they arc
| reputed to have made. There is nothing
: that so quickly discredits a newspaper
I as this sort of unreliability.

The Editor, Sir:
May I take space in your column to
protest against something contrary
to every ethical idea one would expect
to find in a university? I refer to the
con game methods of our saintly cam
pus Y.M.C.A.
I got a letter the other day saying
that if I didn't protest before a certain
date the Y.M.C.A. would ask my par
ents for a donation on the strength
of the fact that I am a student here.
I don't care so much personally —beg-
ging letters of that type generally find
a direct way to the paternal waste
basket —but 1 resent any organization
taking that liberty with-my name and
my home address, which I gave the
University for what I supposed were
official purposes.
It's just the same as if a magazine
agent demanded that I write him a
letter before a certain date or he
would send me a bill for a year's sub
scription.
Many of the fellows are working
their way through school, the parents
of many are unfamiliar with the high
nressure salesmanship of secretaries
who can devote their full time to get
ting money to pay their own salaries.
A letter from the campus Y to my
parents has the tacit assumption that
I approve of their begging and volun
tered my address. The truth may be
that I didn't know anything about it.
Notice that the Y here picks on the
new students, those who have no way
of knowing the kind of an organiza
tion it is and whose parents of course
l£now even less about it.
And, after awhile, if the secretaries
haven't raised their salaries by mail
I suppose they will come politely
around and impress the freshmen to
pledge donations to the "cause."
My older brother tells me quite in
teresting tales of the methods of the
ttVnnro w> have to
stand for them In the University too?
—A NEW STUDENT.
The Editor. Sir:
I am sure that every veteran of the
World War, resident in Stanford Uni
versity, joins me in thanking the com
mittee in charge of the Armistice Day
program for the impressive and touch
ing tribute to our comrades, paid in
the Memorial Church yesterday.
The noble hymn, the beautiful an
them, and the feeling rendering of
"taps" touched me deeply. The ex
luisite notes of that most beautiful
of all army calls recalled most vividly
to our minds the comrades who paid
the supreme sacrifice, whose torn and
broken bodies are now decaying in
foreign soil or nerrhnnr-p in more
congenial soil of our native land.
Those of us w.>o 'nate
enough to pass safely through the
ordeal are appreciative of your tribute.

their task to be one of discovery and

Jesus did. They do not conceive of it in

The editor, Sir:
In Thursday's "Daily," one of your
reporters quotes mc °
he typically H. L. Mcncken type of
article about the Y.M.C.A., whicn ap
pears in the "American Mercury" for
November. His quotation is partial, and
so a complete misrepresentation of my
utitudc toward the article, and that of
'llic Young Men's Christian Association
toward its task here.
What I stated to your reporter was
year ago, the Y.M.C.A. has not been
that since my arrival on the catnpus a

j interested in using old time evangelistic
methods. The officers have conceived
their task to be one of discovery and
practice of a new way of living, and as
; a search for power to live that way, as
Jesus did. They do not conceive of it in
terms of evangelism and conversion, as
the college man of today thinks of those
| words, out of the wave of Billy Sunday
ism that swept the country in his child
| hood. r lheir task is, however, evangel-
I istic in the highest and best sense of that
j word.
Mr. Dye's article in the "American
i Mercury" fails right at this point, too.
j He very evidently gathered his ideas on
the student Y.M.C.A. when he was a
I tutor in colleges some years ago, and hav
ing himself never progressed beyond the
! sophomoric stage, forgets that college
j life in general, including the Y.M.C.A.,
j is thinking in new terms. He goes to the
national year book of statistics (Imagine
| that as a real measure of the vitality of
ia movement!) and finding them still
i couched in the same terms as they were
I when he was in college, goes delightedly
jat the task of ridiculing the organiza
| tion. The very paucity of statistical re
sults should have warned him that the
national Bureau of Records of the gen
l eral Y.M.C.A. was not getting at the
| heart of the student work in its numeri-
I cal approach.
But I did not set out to answer in your
' columns Mr. Dye's article—merely to
I suggest that you instruct your reporters
to take careful notes when interviewing,
I and even on disputed points to submit
to those quoted statements they arc
| reputed to have made. There is nothing
: that so quickly discredits a newspaper
I as this sort of unreliability.

The Editor, Sir:
May I take space in your column to
protest against something contrary
to every ethical idea one would expect
to find in a university? I refer to the
con game methods of our saintly cam
pus Y.M.C.A.
I got a letter the other day saying
that if I didn't protest before a certain
date the Y.M.C.A. would ask my par
ents for a donation on the strength
of the fact that I am a student here.
I don't care so much personally —beg-
ging letters of that type generally find
a direct way to the paternal waste
basket —but 1 resent any organization
taking that liberty with-my name and
my home address, which I gave the
University for what I supposed were
official purposes.
It's just the same as if a magazine
agent demanded that I write him a
letter before a certain date or he
would send me a bill for a year's sub
scription.
Many of the fellows are working
their way through school, the parents
of many are unfamiliar with the high
nressure salesmanship of secretaries
who can devote their full time to get
ting money to pay their own salaries.
A letter from the campus Y to my
parents has the tacit assumption that
I approve of their begging and volun
tered my address. The truth may be
that I didn't know anything about it.
Notice that the Y here picks on the
new students, those who have no way
of knowing the kind of an organiza
tion it is and whose parents of course
l£now even less about it.
And, after awhile, if the secretaries
haven't raised their salaries by mail
I suppose they will come politely
around and impress the freshmen to
pledge donations to the "cause."
My older brother tells me quite in
teresting tales of the methods of the
ttVnnro w> have to
stand for them In the University too?
—A NEW STUDENT.
The Editor. Sir:
I am sure that every veteran of the
World War, resident in Stanford Uni
versity, joins me in thanking the com
mittee in charge of the Armistice Day
program for the impressive and touch
ing tribute to our comrades, paid in
the Memorial Church yesterday.
The noble hymn, the beautiful an
them, and the feeling rendering of
"taps" touched me deeply. The ex
luisite notes of that most beautiful
of all army calls recalled most vividly
to our minds the comrades who paid
the supreme sacrifice, whose torn and
broken bodies are now decaying in
foreign soil or nerrhnnr-p in more
congenial soil of our native land.
