# BRONCO COACH CUTS BASKETBALL SQUAD TO SEVENTEEN MEN
## 
### 
Santa Clara's basketball team was cut
to seventeen men by Coach Dykes Mon
| day, so that each man can rcceive indi
; vidual attention.
I Practice so far has been in funda
mentals and will continue in this line
I until regular scrimmage starts on Na
. vember 20. Special stress has been laid
on short shots to the basket, Coach
Dykes demanding that all men be pro
ficient in this type of shot.
At the end of football season three
more of last year's veterans will be
available, Rarsi, Valine, and Loughcry.
Coach Dykes is well satisfied with the
efforts the men are putting forth. The
! entire squad, with the exception of one
I senior and three juniors, is composed
I of sophomores and freshmen. This angle
j will give next year's team a good many
i veterans and make the coaching easier.
The only real drawback of this year's
season is the difficult schedule before the
Broncos. They will have to play Stan
ford, California, Y.M.1., and the Olym
j pic Club, in the first part of the season,
j However, basketball hopes are brighter
I than for several years. The P.roncos will
| undoubtedly have a systematized and
well unified team of real players when
| the whistle blows for the first game.
The squad is composed of the follow
| ing men: Vukota, Sherman, McNealy,
Maroney, I'rag, Devine, Regan, O'Con
nor, Connolly, Locatelli. Keititig
McKenna, Draper, Reynolds, Boland,
Phclan, Graham, Dononue, uricca, anu
Pachcco.
