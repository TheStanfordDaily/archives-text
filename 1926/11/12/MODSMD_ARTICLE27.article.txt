# RARE SNAKE SPECIMEN GOES TO U.C. MUSEUM
## 
### 
Snakes with two heads are no longer
in the disreputable class with pink ele
phants and four-legged fish since the
University of California Museum of
Veretebrate Zoology has announced
that a legitimate specimen of the two
headed variety has been donated to
the museum and carefully preserved
in a jar of alcohol for the benefit of
the skeptical and the curious.
R. A. Comalli, a Santa Rosa rancher,
found the dead reptile on his ranch.
He corresponded with Dr. Joseph Grin
nell, Director of the University Mu
seum, and Dr. Grinnell expressed the
opinion that the snake would be of
great scientific interest. Comalli
mailed the specimen to the museum.
Upon scientific investigation the snake
proved to be a very young garter
snake with two perfect heads. Its
death had been caused by some injury.
Li'ards with two, three, and even
four tails are part of the museum
collection, but this late acquisition is
one of the oddest from a scientific
standpoint, according to the Univer
sity scientist.
