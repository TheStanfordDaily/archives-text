# THREE COAST SWIM TITLES ENDANGERED AT STANFORD MEET
## Coach Brandsten Hopes to Keep Most of Titles For Cardinals 
### 
Three Pacific Association senior aqua
tic titles will be awarded at 1:0() o'clock
tomorrow afternoon in Encina pool.
Coach Ernst Brandsten, who secured the
award of the 500-yard free style, the
300-yard medley, and the pentathlon for
Stanford, hopes with victories by Cardi
nal paddicrs to be able to keep most of
the trophies here. Competition may be
expected from the Olympic Club of San
Francisco under the leadership of their
new* coach, Tom Whittaker, the Athens
Club of Oakland, the Alumni Club of
San Jose, and the University of Califor
nia swimming team.
Last year Stanford swimmers took
first place in the 500-yard free style and
narrowly missed winning the pentathlon.
This year prospects look good for three
first places. Carl Stevenson, newly
elected swimming captain and premier
middle and long distance swimmer, will
lie entered in the 500 free style. Steven
son last year defeated Frank Mooney
of the Olympic Club in a decisive man
ner. He has been going better than ever
since the beginning of the quarter. At
distances of 300 yards and over Steven
son is practically supreme on the Pacific
Coast as he proved this summer when
lie defeated a field of more than seventy
distance men in the Silver Gate swim at
San Diego. Declaring for a bi-metallic
standard, he returned to San Francisco
and copped the difficult Golden Gate clas
sic, setting a new record in doing so.
Lee Christenscn, a former star of
Utah University, will be the other Card
entry in the distance event. Phil Brooks,
Bill Danford, and Cecil West are signed
for the 300-yard medley. Frank Mooney
may enter this event, as may Willis of
San Jose Alumni club, a formidable
medley competitor.
The pentathlon is practically a swim
ming meet in itself and offers competi
tion of the most gruelling sort. Each
entrant must compete in a 500-vard free
style, low board diving, 100-yard breast
stroke. 100-yard back stroke, and 100-
yard free style, each race being run off
separately. Ted Smith, varsity diver,
and Bob Williams, sprint man and water
polo captain, may enter. Smith will
collect points in the diving and back
stroke events, with a possibility of good
place in the breast stroke. Williams
shines in the free style events.
The meet will be over in ample time
for the football gamd, according to
Brandsten.
