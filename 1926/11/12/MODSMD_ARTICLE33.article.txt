# WOMEN OF AMERICA HAPPIEST IN WORLD --BELGIAN STUDENT

"American women are the happiest
in the world."
Miss Constance Schottel, one of the
Belgian exchange students now study
ing at Stanford and the first woman
lawyer to be graduated from the Uni
versity of Liege, has formed this
opinion after only three months in
America.
"Your women have so many legal
-i IsiTi&r It "a "Belgian * woman sued for
—'heart balm', you call it? —every-
body would laugh at her!"
Miss Schottel has come to America
principally to investigate these legal
rights and to bring back to the Belgian
"suffragistes" a summary of women's
privileges in American law, with a
view toward possible adoption into the
Belgian code.
At present, according to Miss Schot
tel, Belgian women have few legal
privileges. Although there are twenty
five or thirty women lawyers now
practicing in Brussels and four or five
in Antwerp, women's rights have not
received much legal consideration. A
movement has been started, however,
by a group of "suffragistes"—in Bel
gium the word suffragette is used dis
paragingly—to fight by means of
monthly pamphlets and open meetings
for greater women's rights.
Mile. Marie Verone, head of the
movement, has written to Miss Schot
tel urging her to study the women's
suffrage si nation in America with
especial reference to Belgian condi
tions. Miss Schottel plans to spend one
or two years at Stanford in the Law
department and then return to Liege,
where she will be the first woman to
practice law in that city.
When asked why she chose Stan
ford for her graduate work, Miss
Schottel explained that it is well
known in Belgium for its law course,
and also that the American students
whom she consulted at Liege strongly
recommended this University. All
were from Stanford.
Out of a field of 200 applicants, Miss
Schottel was chosen one of the twen
ty-four Belgian students whose work
for one year in a United States uni
versity is sponsored by the American
Committee for Relief in Belgium.
Choice of a college is not restricted;
three Belgian students are now at
Berkeley and three are at Stanford.
Most of the Americans are attending
the University of Brussels, "because,"
explained Miss Schottel, "it is in a
big city, you know, with much more
excitement! But I myself like better
the University of Liege."
Miss Schottel has already found
several differences between the Bel
gian institution and Stanford. Women
at Liege study principally in the
Schools of Medicine and "Pharma
cologic" with comparatively few in the
School of Letters. Men usually choose
the mining and electrical departments,
both of which have become world-re
nowned.
Another characteristic is the great
number of foreign students. There are
almost as many foreigners as Belgians
at Liege, including Italians, Rouma
nians, Spaniards, Poles, and Ameri
cans.
Miss Schottel has found a difference
also in the curricula. At Liege the stu
dent may not select hrs professor and
usually is given no elective courses in
his chosen department but must take
all the required subjects. There are
no mid-quarter or end-quarter quizzes;
a comprehensive examination is given
at the end of the year to cover the
entire course. General subjects must
be taken during the first two years,
after which specialization in the de
partment is permitted.
