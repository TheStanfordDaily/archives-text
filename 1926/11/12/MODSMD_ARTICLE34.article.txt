# HUNT SETS MONDAY FOR HOOP PRACTICE
## 
### 
Varsity basketball practice will start
Monday at 4 p.m. in the basketball
pavilion. Practice will be held only
three times a week in order that those
who are behind in their classes may
have ample time to catch up.
Coach "Husky" Hunt, in a meeting
at the gym today, said that the first
few weeks of practice call essentially
for Individual work. Hunt ask√ü every
one who is eligible and who desires to
play to come out Monday; so that he
can pet the squad into shape.
