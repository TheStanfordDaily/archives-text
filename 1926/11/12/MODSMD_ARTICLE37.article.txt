# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
I-lere is the elusive Mr. Slagle, who
should be very much in evidence in
the Palmer Stadium at Princeton to
morrow afternoon. Statistics show
that J. W. Slagle is a halfback, play
ing with the Princeton football team;
that he is 23 years old; 5 feet, 9 inches
tall; and weighs 168 pounds; but that,
my friends, is only a small portion of
the Saga of Slagle.
For Jake Slagle, who prepped at
Cilman and who goes out into the wide
world as a graduate of Princeton next
June, is a man who accomplishes
things. Given a football, he will aston
ish you with the skill with which he
kicks it, passes it, and runs with it.
He can run into and through an oppos
ing line or around the end, or side
step, pivot, change his pace, and dart
like an eel in a broken field. On de
fense, Mr. Slagle can tackle with
steam and accuracy. A good man to
have around, you'll admit. So does
Coach Bill Roper.
In 1925, Jake was supreme in help
ing Princeton defeat both Harvard
and Yale. It was in the Yale game that
he rose to his greatest heights, and it
may be in the Yale game tomorrow

I that he will once more win the acclaim
j of over fifty thousand frenzied spec
: tators. Let me take you back once
: more to that famous run of Slagle's in
tiie Yale bowl, on November 14, 1925.
It was tho second quarter, with
Princeton holding the ball on its 22-
yard line. Yale expected a kick, as
; Princeton had the wind with her.
I Siagle took the ball from scrimmage
: and started around Yale's left end. As
I each play in football, where the ball is
carried, is a potential touchdown, the
j enemy goal-line was really Jake's ob
jective, but I doubt if he actually ex
pected to get far beyond the line of
scrimmage. He got around Yale's end,
thanks to his interference, and suc
ceeded in eluding the Blue's secondary
| defense. Two teammates took out the
| quarter, but Slagle's field was by no
i means clear. By uncanny dodging and
J side-stepping, and by weaving in and
] out just at the right minute, Prince-
I ton's "No. 7" made a run worthy of
j the famous "No. 77" of Illinois at his
j best, and traversed the remaining fifty
I yards to Yale's goal line.
It was a sight I'll never forget, and
I hope he does it again tomorrow!

| quarter, but Slagle's field was by no
i means clear. By uncanny dodging and
J side-stepping, and by weaving in and
] out just at the right minute, Prince-
I ton's "No. 7" made a run worthy of
j the famous "No. 77" of Illinois at his
j best, and traversed the remaining fifty
I yards to Yale's goal line.
It was a sight I'll never forget, and
I hope he does it again tomorrow!


Everything Is Jake
I-lere is the elusive Mr. Slagle, who
should be very much in evidence in
the Palmer Stadium at Princeton to
morrow afternoon. Statistics show
that J. W. Slagle is a halfback, play
ing with the Princeton football team;
that he is 23 years old; 5 feet, 9 inches
tall; and weighs 168 pounds; but that,
my friends, is only a small portion of
the Saga of Slagle.
For Jake Slagle, who prepped at
Cilman and who goes out into the wide
world as a graduate of Princeton next
June, is a man who accomplishes
things. Given a football, he will aston
ish you with the skill with which he
kicks it, passes it, and runs with it.
He can run into and through an oppos
ing line or around the end, or side
step, pivot, change his pace, and dart
like an eel in a broken field. On de
fense, Mr. Slagle can tackle with
steam and accuracy. A good man to
have around, you'll admit. So does
Coach Bill Roper.
In 1925, Jake was supreme in help
ing Princeton defeat both Harvard
and Yale. It was in the Yale game that
he rose to his greatest heights, and it
may be in the Yale game tomorrow

I that he will once more win the acclaim
j of over fifty thousand frenzied spec
: tators. Let me take you back once
: more to that famous run of Slagle's in
tiie Yale bowl, on November 14, 1925.
It was tho second quarter, with
Princeton holding the ball on its 22-
yard line. Yale expected a kick, as
; Princeton had the wind with her.
I Siagle took the ball from scrimmage
: and started around Yale's left end. As
I each play in football, where the ball is
carried, is a potential touchdown, the
j enemy goal-line was really Jake's ob
jective, but I doubt if he actually ex
pected to get far beyond the line of
scrimmage. He got around Yale's end,
thanks to his interference, and suc
ceeded in eluding the Blue's secondary
| defense. Two teammates took out the
| quarter, but Slagle's field was by no
i means clear. By uncanny dodging and
J side-stepping, and by weaving in and
] out just at the right minute, Prince-
I ton's "No. 7" made a run worthy of
j the famous "No. 77" of Illinois at his
j best, and traversed the remaining fifty
I yards to Yale's goal line.
