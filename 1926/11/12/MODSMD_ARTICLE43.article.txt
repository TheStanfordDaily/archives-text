# PILLAR GATEWAY AT PALM DRIVE PLANNED
## 
### 
Construction of a pillar gateway to
Stanford at the Palm Drive entrance
is one of the plans favored by some
members of the senior class as a suit
! able 1927 memorial gift. These pro
posed columns are to be raised in
place of the present sandstone arch
way base.
Previous to the great earthquake in
1906, an imposing gateway of brown
, sandstone and red tile stood facing
the highway. It was built in 1904 un
l der the supervision of C. E. Hodges,
then resident University architect, at
a cost of approximately $25,000.
The structure consisted of a series
of twelve arches built on the same
general style as the Spanish arches
jVt" the East and West entrances to the
, Inner Quadrangle On each s'de of
! the drive was a large arch with a
! peaked tile roof and flanking them
were colonnades of five smaller arches
without red tile roofs.
Perched on the outside ends of the
gateway in striking contrast to the
brown and red of the structure stood
two white marble griffins. The left
side of the gateway bore the inscrip
tion, "The Leland Stanford Junior
University, Founded A. D. 1855," and
on the right, "The Palo Alto Estate,
Acquired A. D. 1878 by Leland Stan
ford."
Following the earthquake, the arches
i and colonnades were not restored by
the University due to lack of finances.
