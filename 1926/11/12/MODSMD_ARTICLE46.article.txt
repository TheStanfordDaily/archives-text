# PRELATE COMMENTS ON UNIVERSITY LIFE IN ENGLAND, AMERICA

### 
Commenting on his observations of
American university life upon the com
pletion of his six-weeks' tour of our
colleges, Right Reverend Arthur Foley
Winnington-Ingram, D.D., Lord Bishop
of London, in an interview, made the
following comparison between British
and American institutions of higher
learning:
"American universities and British
universities differ in three important
respectsâ€”co-education, religions atti
tude, and the 'college' system as op
posed to fraternities.
Co-Education Missing
"In England the women' ail live'in"
different colleges, with principles of
their own, and never mingle with the
men. However, I believe that if every
man is a Christian gentleman and
every woman a Christian lady, co
education is feasible. Without religion
I deem it a dangerous experiment.
"The religious attitude is an integral
part of all British universities. All the
ancient colleges are permeated by re
ligious traditions of thousands of
years. Every college has a chapel.
Although chapel attendance is not
compulsory, a great majority of the
students attend regularly. The fact of
college chapel thus gives English uni
versity education a religious turn.
"The 'college' system also makes a
great difference in the universities.
All the students live in colleges, for
instance, one is known as Christ
Church, Oxford. This makes a tremen
dous difference to a university stu
dent lie is almost as proud of his col
lege as he is of his university. The
selection of a student for these col
leges is utterly beyond his control. He
cannot choose his companions, with
whom he is to live all through col
lege. This is the difference between
the English college system and the
American fraternity system."
Bishop Ingram declares that he is
pleased by his tour of twenty-one
American universities, and has enjoyed
the experience thoroughly. He has ad
dressed more than 100,000 students
during his trip. He was, head of Ox
ford House for nine years, and as such
became thoroughly acquainted with
English university students, and his
six-weeks' tour of American universi
ties has enabled him to obtain an in
sight into American college life.
