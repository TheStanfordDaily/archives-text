I the pupil of the famous Leopold Auer
jin Petrograd. How Auer regarded El

A much advertised young virtuoso
was to give a concert, and Auer was
asked for his opinion of the artist's
ability. He answered, "I have a pupil
only twelve years old who is far super
ior," and determining to back up his
\ statement, he made an opportunity for
I Elman to appear at the opening con-
I cert of the Deutsche Liedertafel—the
most important musical society of the
I city.
Auer himself was scheduled to plav.
but at the last moment sent word that
1 he was too ill to appear, and that his
youngest pupil would take his place.
Elman, a lad of twelve, played with
I such splendid success that the audi
i ence demanded a half-dozen encorcs.
1 The following day the name of Mischa
Elman was on everyone's tongue, and
from that important appearance the
| young virtuoso went from one city to

Pupil of Famous Auer
About 1904 Mischa Elman became
I the pupil of the famous Leopold Auer
jin Petrograd. How Auer regarded El
man, even at that time, is best told in
the following incident:
A much advertised young virtuoso
was to give a concert, and Auer was
asked for his opinion of the artist's
ability. He answered, "I have a pupil
only twelve years old who is far super
ior," and determining to back up his
\ statement, he made an opportunity for
I Elman to appear at the opening con-
I cert of the Deutsche Liedertafel—the
most important musical society of the
I city.
Auer himself was scheduled to plav.
but at the last moment sent word that
1 he was too ill to appear, and that his
youngest pupil would take his place.
Elman, a lad of twelve, played with
I such splendid success that the audi
i ence demanded a half-dozen encorcs.
1 The following day the name of Mischa
Elman was on everyone's tongue, and
from that important appearance the
| young virtuoso went from one city to
| another, until today he has played in
practically every country on the globe.
