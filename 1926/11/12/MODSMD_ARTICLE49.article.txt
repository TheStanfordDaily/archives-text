1 he question of whether or nut Clyde !
Griffiths actually killed Roberta Alden j
has been considered by some of the i
country's leading critics. Harry Sal- j
peter, literary critic on the New York
World, contends that "Roberta Alden
was killed with the help of a circuml
- not in Clyde's reckoning," and
that "were Clyde Griffiths tried today I
on the basis of the full testimony I doubt >
that he could be convicted in the first
degree in view of the general recognition ;
and acceptance of gradations between;
premeditated murder aided and abetted I
by a circumstance not in the 'murder's' <
mind."
On the other hand, Arthur Garfield J
Hays takes this side: "The judgments
of the law are presumably based on acts,
but the application of the law is made
by men moved by emotion. The truth
at the trial would not have avoided emo
tional condemnation. Yet Dreiser has
done this. Perhaps Darrow could have
done it."
He adds: "The novelist has presented 1
the facts. The contest means that a jury
will pass on these facts. One who is i
interested in life, morals, criminal law
and, in fact, any phase of social existence
is bound to find an interest in the con
flicting opinions which should indicate
how very careful men should be in un
dertaking to judge their fellows."
