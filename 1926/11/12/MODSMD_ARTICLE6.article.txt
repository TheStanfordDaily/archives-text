# VARSITY SOCCER ELEVEN TIES CALIFORNIA
## Cards' Powerful Defense Keeps Bears in Midfield Throughout Game GOALS NOT THREATENED Strowger, Bailard, Cannon, Star at Offensive Play For Stanford 
### Elbert G. Thomas 
Stanford's varsity soccer team fought |
its way to a scoreless tie with the Uni
versity of California eleven this after- j
noon in a midfield contest, the first of
the annual intercollegiate series.
While neither goal was threatened to
any great extent, it was the powerful j
defense of the Cardinal aggregation j
which kept the charging Bears in mid- j
field for the greater part of the contest, j
A big cog in the Red defense was Evans, j
left fullback, whose long kicks from j
deep in his own territory mme in tim"lv |
fashion to prevent the Blue and Gold
forward line irum picking up any closing |
shots.
Strowger Stars
Strowger, playing inside left for the j
Cards, and Captain Bob Bailard, in&ide j
right, played their best offensive ball of
the season. It was due to the efforts of
Strowger and of Bob Cannon, left half
back, that the Red forward line pushed
ahead aggressively in the face of a rival j
outfit which was figured to not only :
force the play, but to win, by virtue of I
previous performances this year.
As a matter of fact, the California 1
players did have possession of the ball
for the greater part of the game, but !
at no time was Forrest, playing goal- j
tender for Stanford, rushed to any great j
extent. Defense ability of the halves I
was particularly responsible for keep
ing the ball out of the danger terri- j
tory.
A return match, the second of the |
three-game series, will be played as a !
preliminary to the Big Game in the!
Un iversity of California Memorial Sta-;
dium a week from Saturday, it was '
announced directly following yester- â– 
day's game by Don McCarty, who, with j
Jack Franklin and Captain Bailard, is i
directing the varsity outfit in the ab- j
sence of Coach Harry Maloney.
