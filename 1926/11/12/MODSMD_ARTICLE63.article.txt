# MOVING PICTURES OF AMERICAN HISTORY LATE DEVELOPMENT
## 
### 
The History department of North- j
western University has been pre
sented with a set of films which is j
being used in the teaching of Ameri
can history. There will eventually be
thirty-three sets of films.
Fifteen of them have been com
pleted and have reached the Univer
sity. The pictures are authentic in
historical fact and treatment of cos
tume and detail. They treat of a num
ber of epochal American subjects, in
cluding Columbus, Jamestown, the
Pilgrims, the Puritans, Peter Stuyve-
Hant, the Declaration of Independence,
Ycrktcwn tlootjp
the Frontier Woman, Alexander Ham
ilton, and Dixie.
• The Yale University Press, from
which the films were purchased, has
issued a statement giving details of
the care used in perfecting this his
torical set. It says in part:
"Before the first turn of the camera,
certain precepts were established and
definite principles declared from
which there could be no deviation. The
first stated that every foot of film ex
posed would record nothing but what
had been proved to be absolutely au
thentic in the searching light of the
most exacting research of historical
documents and drawings. The second
commanded that every character
should be presented faithfully and ac
curately. The third required that every
incident depicted on the screen should
be truthfully revealed.
"In other words, the finished screen
work should be so perfect a recreation
of America's glorious story, that it
might well be used in any schoolroom
as a means of education by eye, there
by extending and clarifying the estab
lished course of history."
These films have proved to be very
popular when shown under the auspi
ces of the Yale University Press in
leading theatres of the country. Gradu
ally thfir importance from an educa
tional standpoint has become appar
ent, and as a result of the realization
of this value, the donor has presented
them to Northwestern University.
