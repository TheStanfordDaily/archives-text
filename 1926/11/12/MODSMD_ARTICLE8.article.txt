# AUDIENCE PLEASED BY APPEARANCE OF MARCEL GRANDIANY
## Harpist Shows Faultless Technique; Assisted by Denise Daverni 
### Frank Mittauer 
Playing his instrument with fault
les stechnique before an audience that
nearly filled the Assembly Hall, Mar
cel Grandjany, French harpist, last
night opened auspiciously the fifteenth
annual concert series of the Peninsula
Musical Association.
The artist's program, made up of
works of contemporary composers for
the most part, was interesting and
never too modernistic or heavy for
the enjoyment of everyone that at
tended the recital.
Grandjany's first solo group was fea
tured by Ottorini Resphigi's "Sicili
ana," a composition which is extreme
ly tuneful and gave the harpist ample
opportunity to show his skill. Perhaps
the most interesting rendition of the
evening, however, was the encore to
the first solo group. This number,
original, but faintly suggestive at
times of oriental themes and at other
times of church music, was well
played by Grandjany.
In Grandjany's second group, "La
Mandoline" was the outstanding offer
ing. The number, a transcription from
Parish Alvers' piano composition, lost
nothing and gained somewhat in being
interpreted on the harp.
In the harpist's final group three
numbers were of note, "Arabesques,"
by Claude Debussy, a composition of
Grandjany himself, "Fairy Tale," and
R. Renie's "Ballade Fantastique." Of
all these, however, "Arabesques," in
its firm yet delicate tracery, drew
most interest.
Denise Daverm, assisting Grandjany
in the concert, sang Bishop's familiar
"Lo, Here the Gentle Lark," and three
Debussy numbers to the harpist's ac
companiment, as"'well as three other
numbers to which Grandjany played a
piano accompaniment.
The combination of the soprano
voice with the harp was extremely
pleasing, especially in the Bishop num
ber, but Miss Daverni's voice seemed
to be more or less dampened by the
piano, although Granjany played
softly.
