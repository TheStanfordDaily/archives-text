PRINCE ALBERT stepped out into the world
nearly twenty years ago. Success was immediate
• . . and outstanding. Because P. A. measures
up to the first and greatest rule for success: It has
the goods! The school of experience has pro
duced no finer tobacco than this.
Just buy yourself a tidy red tin of P. A. and
tamp a load flush with the muzzle of your old
jimmy-pipe. Connect with a match, and let
that first wonderful drag tell you that no other PA 'j sold everywhere in
° ' tidy red tins, Pound and half
tobacco can come within a mile of this for sheer nouud crystal-glati humidors H
. with sponge-moistener top.
nine-cmamv /inJ " l^a y* * , *i h every bit
ill /' of bite and parch removed by
| | . 4 . _ the Prince Albert process.
Cool as a dormitory radiator. Sweet as an
extra cut. Fragrant as a peach-orchard. P. A.
can't bite your tongue or parch your throat
- —another important detail. Get yourself some ilw
Prince Albert today. No other tobacco can 1 1 j
bring you so much downright smoke-pleasure. * J

—no other tobacco is 'ike it!
