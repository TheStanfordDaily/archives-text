# CARDINAL DRIVE IN LAST PERIOD DOWNS HUSKIES
## Fighting Eleven Smashes Way to Victory; Avenges Former Defeat CHAMPIONSHIP IN SIGHT California Last Obstacle to Stanford Leadership Of Conference 
### Jim Adams 
Although it required about all the
steam the boiler had, the Stanford
steam-roller finally flattened out the
Huskies in the Stanford stadium Sat
urday, 29-10, after a ferocious drive in
the last quarter which netted three
touchdowns. Almost 50,000 people wit
nessed three quarters of close, nerve
shattering football with the score 10-
all at the end of that period, and then
saw a figliting-mad Stanford eleven
smash its way to a victory in the last
frame which evened up the score for
last year's defeat, and eliminated all
but California to hinder the Cards in
tneir march for the Coast champion
ship.
Cards Lose Assurance
The 10-point lead gained by Stan
ford through a touchdown by Ittike
Murphy in the first quabter and a field
goal in the third via the toe of George
Bogue, which seemed ample enough
to assure a win, lost all such assur
ance when Guttormsen intercepted a
long pass from Hoffman and raced 65
yards to a touchdown which was fol
lowed by a conversion and soon after
by a field goal which tied the score.
But it was at this stage that the
Cards shoved all the coal into the
boiler and let loose with all the power
that has been accumulating therein
this season. There is hardly a team in
the country that could have denied
Warner's fighting eleven a few touch
downs while they were in that frame
of mind. Even a fifteen-yard penalty
put them back from the 25-yard line,
where they had advanced from the
kick-off, to the 40-yard line, could not
discourage them.
Attack Refuses Denial
Bogue and Wilton in two plays took
the ball back to almost the same spot
and then Hoffman tossed a 15-yard
pass to Shipkey who evaded several
tacklers in a 10-yard run and finally
dove head-first over the goal line.
â–  Bogue's kick was blocked.
With the same not-to-be-denied atti
tude Stanford made another touchdown
soon after when Wilton intercepted
; Hanley's pass on the Huskies' 26-yard
line. He gained four yards through
: tackle and Bogue took the ball on the
i next play on a 22-yard trip to the goal
: line, following up with a conversion.
Bogue Stands Out
George Bogue was the outstanding
player on the Card team, if one man
could stand out above such a group
j as represented Stanford Saturday. Be
sides consistent long gains through the
line which always ended 5 yards fur
ther than where he was tackled, he
dropped back to his 37-yard line in the
! third quarter and booted the ball on a
place kick squarely between the up
j rights.
Warner sent Hill in to relieve Bogue
; soon after the latter made his tniirfr.
j down and the former carried on the
work by reeling off XG yards around
right end after the Cards had taken
ttlie ball on Washington's 33-yard line
i where the Huskies had lost it on
I downs. Wilton, Hill, and Hoffman add
! Ed enough to put the ball on the 2-yard
j line where Hoffman drove through left
guard for the final score. The goal
kick was blocked and Hill was injured
i on the play and was replaced by Sims.
; The injury. was not serious, however,
' and the Cards left the field with
| every man in shape for the Big Game
I next week.
Guttormsen Snags Pass
There were several feature plays,
i but the most spectacular was the long
; run of Washington's plucky captain,
j Hoffman shot the same kind of pass
to Hyland that netted a touchdown
against the Trojans, but Hyland was
way out of position and Guttormsen
had no trouble snagging the ball. He
galloped rather than ran and as he
thundered down the field he swept
past tackier after tackier until steady
going Ed Walker loomed up as the
only man between him and the goal
line. Ed made a desperate lunge at
him in an effort to knock him out of
bounds but Guttormsen kicked up his
heels and proceeded the remaining 7
yards. Shaw kicked goal. It was a
beautiful run deserving of the results
that it brought.
Douglas Hurdles
It wasn't long after that Douglas
took a 10-yard pass from Tesreau and
headed for the goal line. Hyland was
the only obstacle in the way and as
the Stanford safety man made a lunge
at Douglas the latter raised in the
air in perfect hurdling form and
cleared "Tricky Dick" by a good foot.
Although he ran on to the goal line
while the Washington stands rent the
air with shouts and the Stanford
rooters gulped in dismay, the referee
called the play back and penalized the
Huskies 15 yards for the offense.
Hyland gave Washington a scare
when he took the ball on the opening
kick-off of the second half and side
stepped his way 56 yards through the
Huskies before they knew where he
was. Guttormsen, who proved his
worth as a tackier also, nailed the

fleet-footed Card on Stanford's 46-yard
line.
'Shipkey Brings Thrill
I Shipkey contributed a couple of
' thrills besides his best game of foot
i ball for the year when he snagged a
35-yard pass from Hoffman to aid in
j the first score and when he grabbed
I another and raced over the line for a
| touchdown. His work on the defense
j was also good.
Stanford's first score was made in
I six plays from the Cards' 15-yard line
j where they took the ball following an
j exchange of punts. Bogue started it
! with a 23-yard run; Shipkey boosted
it along by catching his long pass with
ja Husky hanging on his neck; Mike
| Murphy finished it by scampering 27
I yards to the goal line. Bogue kicked
I goal.
Tesreau's Punts Excel
Tesreau's punts were about the best
seen here this year although a few
short ones cut down his average. One
sailed for a total trip of 78 yards from
toe to where it rolled.
Washington showed a powerful de
fensive line but Stanford's superiority
in offense was evidenced by the fact
j that they made 16 first downs to the
! Huskies' 6. Schuh and Cutting at ends
i were menaces to the Cards' end runs
and necessitated most of the reverses
and criss-crosses being run off tackle.
Guttormsen looked like the best sig
nal-caller on the coast while Tesreau
was handy especially for his punting.
! To pick out any players who ex
; celled on the Stanford team would be
! too pick them all. Bogue, perhaps, was
the most outstanding. Captain Swan
performed brilliantly in the forward
wall as did all the linesmen. He played
| the whole game, as did Hoffman and
Robesky.
Hoffman cannot be passed without
] giving special credit to him for con
| sistent punts, good passing, good
| yardage, and for some of the longest
kick-offs ever seen on the Stanford
| field.
