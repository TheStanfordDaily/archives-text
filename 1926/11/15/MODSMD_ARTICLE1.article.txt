# CARDINAL DRIVE IN LAST PERIOD DOWNS HUSKIES
## Fighting Eleven Smashes Way to Victory; Avenges Former Defeat CHAMPIONSHIP IN SIGHT California Last Obstacle to Stanford Leadership Of Conference 
### Jim Adams 
Although it required about all the
steam the boiler had, the Stanford
steam-roller finally flattened out the
Huskies in the Stanford stadium Sat
urday, 29-10, after a ferocious drive in
the last quarter which netted three
touchdowns. Almost 50,000 people wit
nessed three quarters of close, nerve
shattering football with the score 10-
all at the end of that period, and then
saw a figliting-mad Stanford eleven
smash its way to a victory in the last
frame which evened up the score for
last year's defeat, and eliminated all
but California to hinder the Cards in
tneir march for the Coast champion
ship.
Cards Lose Assurance
The 10-point lead gained by Stan
ford through a touchdown by Ittike
Murphy in the first quabter and a field
goal in the third via the toe of George
Bogue, which seemed ample enough
to assure a win, lost all such assur
ance when Guttormsen intercepted a
long pass from Hoffman and raced 65
yards to a touchdown which was fol
lowed by a conversion and soon after
by a field goal which tied the score.
But it was at this stage that the
Cards shoved all the coal into the
boiler and let loose with all the power
that has been accumulating therein
this season. There is hardly a team in
the country that could have denied
Warner's fighting eleven a few touch
downs while they were in that frame
of mind. Even a fifteen-yard penalty
put them back from the 25-yard line,
where they had advanced from the
kick-off, to the 40-yard line, could not
discourage them.
Attack Refuses Denial
Bogue and Wilton in two plays took
the ball back to almost the same spot
and then Hoffman tossed a 15-yard
pass to Shipkey who evaded several
tacklers in a 10-yard run and finally
dove head-first over the goal line.
