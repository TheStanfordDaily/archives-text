## 
### 
Freshman kickers of Stanford tied
the annual California-Stanford fresh
man soccer series in a 2 to 1 Cardinal
victory Saturday morning on the
i Farm.
|
On paper, it might seem as if Smith,
j the babe center forward who scored
| both of Stanford's tallies, was indi
vidually important, but it was really
"Coach" Howard Smith's secondary
defense which took the matter into
its own handstand not only eased up
the duties of Robinson, goaltender,
but aided materially in advancing the
ball into U.C. territory. Comparatively
weak wings slowed up the Card of
fense slightly.
While the Blue and Gold players
appeared to have the better drilled
forward combination, and played a
rangy game that kept the ball inside
Babe territory for the greater part of
the affair, it was the periodical ag
gressiveness and ability to beat their
opponent to the ball that accounted
for the Redshirts' success.
The Babes scored in the middle of
the first half when Lasley and Jen
nings maneuvered past Singh, Turk
ish Cub halfback, to pass the ball in
for Smith's timely kick through the
net. In the second half Borden and
Jannings dribbled down the left side
of the field and cut in toward the
center to enable Smith to complete
the score.
The Cubs forced the play continu
ally, but Sado, their outside right, was
too fast for his teammates, and usu
ally his footwork was broken up by
Christensen and Lemmon, babe full
backs, who turned in good perform
ances on hefty defense work. Sado
took a long pass late in the game and
worked it through for California's lone
score.
There will be no third game to break
the intercollegiate tie, according to
J Manager George Wheaton.
