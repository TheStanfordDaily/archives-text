# DRINK QUESTION QUAD POLL SET FOR TOMORROW
## Referendum Is Sponsored in Celleges Throughout United States CAMPUS OPINION SOUGHT Student Federation Gathers Vote as Preliminary To Conference 
### 
To drink or not to drink —in opin
ion, at least —will be decided by Stan
ford at a special referendum tomor
row. The poll is a part of a national
collegate vote which is being taken
under the direction of the National
Student Federation of America.
The ballots will indicate, first,
whether the student body favors the
present prohibition laws, modification,
or repeal, and, secondly, why the in
dividuals vote as they do. The Federa
tion expresses the hope that by col
lecting the reasons underlying the
votes it may draw up a comprehensive
report which will be more valuable
than mere straw vote figures.
The National Student Federation of
America plans to use Prohibition as a
topic for discussion in its national con
ference at the University of Michigan
next month. The Federation has di
rected this poll in all parts of the
country and in all kinds of colleges
and universities, as a preliminary to
this discussion. An attempt is also
being made, it states, to gather short
reports from faculty deans and student
leaders on the actual extent of drink
ing at the various universities.
Campus betting on the outcome of
the referendum is 2 to 1 that repeal
and modification will win by a two
thirds majority.
