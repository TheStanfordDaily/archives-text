# ROUGHS TRADITIONS UPHELD, SAYS RETIRED WATCHMAN
## 
### Douglas R. Fuller 
"They're a little more quiet now-a
days" and they "tog up a bit different,"
but at the bottom Stanford men of to
day are just the same as the Stanford
roughs of tradition, in the opinion of
Charles E. (Dad) Wooster, former En
cina nightwatchman who probably
knows more of Stanford men and tra
ditions than any man living, when
questioned Saturday as to how modern
Stanford men compare with those of
the past.
Recalls Wild Times
"We used to have some pretty wild
times here twenty years or so ago,"
said Day, and he chuckled as he added,
"and oh, we bad some great times
back in (ho OO's! They were rough, all
right, in them days," ho laughed as ho
recalled some of I lie freshmen's dismal
experiences during hazing seasons.
Dad is inclined to believe that (he
"rough" clothes of early days were
dictated by necessity rathnr than
taste, on account of the prevalence of
(he pastime of throwing water bags at
passersby. The roughs used to dress

lp frequently in the evenings, but they
ivere never safe until they were a
;ood distance away from the Encina
windows.
Games "Holy Terrors"
Recalling the football games of the
)ld days made Dad laugh again. He
•ould think of no properly descriptive
lame for them except "holy terrors."
He said that the Stanford teams were
?o rough that the "Berkeley boys" re
fused to play them for a number of
Fears.
After the games, according to Dad,
lie teams would adjourn to Menlo,
hen a thriving town of twelve or thir
een saloons. Dad favors prohibition,
)Ut he still has a soft spot in his
Heart for the Menlo wine, which was
jo good they used to ship it clear to
Prance, at thirty cents a gallon.
Dad Knew Founders
Dad, now 78 years of age, is a rather
short, jovial man, with an extremely
ndividual old hat which ho wears at
i rakish angle, and a curving whito
mustache that expresses perpetual
good humor. He came out to Califor
nia in 1869 bringing a pair of coach
horses to Senator Stanford from New
York, and has been connected with
the Stanford family or Stanford Uni
versity ever since. He took care of the
Senator's horses and drove his car
riage for him until his death in 1893,
after which he held the same position
for Mrs. Stanford.
Cared for Tomb
After Mrs. Stanford's death, he
worked around the Stanford tomb, tak
ing care of the flowers and lawn, until
finally in 1915 he became nightwatch
man at Encina hall, which position he
held until 1924, when he was pen
sioned by the University.

Some of Dad's choicest recollections
are regarding a little old one-cylinder
Victrola now residing in state at his
home in Palo Alto. He used to keep it
in. the Encina lobby, where it was
almost continually on duty. lie, chuck
led once more as he thought of the
i little phonograph. The most common
saying at Encina, he says, used to be,
; "There goes Dad's old machine
; again!"
Stanford Horses Hobby
Dad has a never-ending string of
reminiscences of the days when he
was in the service of the Stanford
family. Besides a large collection of
j photographs, he has a big scrap-book
| containing pictures, newspaper clip
i pings, and documents concerning the
Stanford horses (Dad's favorite sub
ject), the Stanford properties, and the
early days of California. Among the
curios there are, for example, a Cen
tral Pacific railroad pass to Charles
; Wooster for the year 1874 and a pic
ture of Governor Stanford's coach
horses in motion, which Dad regards
as the first moving-picture. He has re

fused a number of sizable offers for
his collection.
Perhaps Dad's greatest delight, how
ever, is in his thirty-year friendship
with Stanford students. Former and
present students are all the time drop
ping in to talk with him, but he re
grets the fact that he can no longer
be a father to everybody as in the old
days, for he has all active
duties at the University and is able
to get out here only once or twice a
week at present.

Games "Holy Terrors"
Recalling the football games of the

lame for them except "holy terrors."
He said that the Stanford teams were
?o rough that the "Berkeley boys" re
fused to play them for a number of
Fears.
After the games, according to Dad,
lie teams would adjourn to Menlo,
hen a thriving town of twelve or thir
een saloons. Dad favors prohibition,
)Ut he still has a soft spot in his
Heart for the Menlo wine, which was
jo good they used to ship it clear to

Dad Knew Founders
Dad, now 78 years of age, is a rather
short, jovial man, with an extremely
ndividual old hat which ho wears at
i rakish angle, and a curving whito
mustache that expresses perpetual
good humor. He came out to Califor
nia in 1869 bringing a pair of coach
horses to Senator Stanford from New
York, and has been connected with
the Stanford family or Stanford Uni
versity ever since. He took care of the
Senator's horses and drove his car
riage for him until his death in 1893,
after which he held the same position
for Mrs. Stanford.
Cared for Tomb
After Mrs. Stanford's death, he
worked around the Stanford tomb, tak
ing care of the flowers and lawn, until
finally in 1915 he became nightwatch
man at Encina hall, which position he
held until 1924, when he was pen
sioned by the University.

Some of Dad's choicest recollections
are regarding a little old one-cylinder
Victrola now residing in state at his
home in Palo Alto. He used to keep it
in. the Encina lobby, where it was
almost continually on duty. lie, chuck
led once more as he thought of the
i little phonograph. The most common
saying at Encina, he says, used to be,
; "There goes Dad's old machine

Stanford Horses Hobby
Dad has a never-ending string of
reminiscences of the days when he
was in the service of the Stanford
family. Besides a large collection of
j photographs, he has a big scrap-book
| containing pictures, newspaper clip
i pings, and documents concerning the
Stanford horses (Dad's favorite sub
ject), the Stanford properties, and the
early days of California. Among the
curios there are, for example, a Cen
tral Pacific railroad pass to Charles
; Wooster for the year 1874 and a pic
ture of Governor Stanford's coach
horses in motion, which Dad regards
as the first moving-picture. He has re

fused a number of sizable offers for
his collection.
Perhaps Dad's greatest delight, how
ever, is in his thirty-year friendship
with Stanford students. Former and
present students are all the time drop
ping in to talk with him, but he re
grets the fact that he can no longer
be a father to everybody as in the old
days, for he has all active
duties at the University and is able
to get out here only once or twice a
week at present.
"They're a little more quiet now-a
days" and they "tog up a bit different,"

versity ever since. He took care of the
Senator's horses and drove his car
riage for him until his death in 1893,
after which he held the same position
for Mrs. Stanford.

worked around the Stanford tomb, tak
ing care of the flowers and lawn, until
finally in 1915 he became nightwatch

Some of Dad's choicest recollections
are regarding a little old one-cylinder
Victrola now residing in state at his
home in Palo Alto. He used to keep it
in. the Encina lobby, where it was
almost continually on duty. lie, chuck
led once more as he thought of the
i little phonograph. The most common
saying at Encina, he says, used to be,
; "There goes Dad's old machine
; again!"
Stanford Horses Hobby
Dad has a never-ending string of
reminiscences of the days when he
was in the service of the Stanford
family. Besides a large collection of
j photographs, he has a big scrap-book
| containing pictures, newspaper clip
i pings, and documents concerning the
Stanford horses (Dad's favorite sub
ject), the Stanford properties, and the
early days of California. Among the
curios there are, for example, a Cen
tral Pacific railroad pass to Charles
; Wooster for the year 1874 and a pic
ture of Governor Stanford's coach
horses in motion, which Dad regards
as the first moving-picture. He has re

fused a number of sizable offers for
his collection.
Perhaps Dad's greatest delight, how
ever, is in his thirty-year friendship
with Stanford students. Former and
present students are all the time drop
ping in to talk with him, but he re
grets the fact that he can no longer
be a father to everybody as in the old
days, for he has all active
duties at the University and is able
to get out here only once or twice a
week at present.
