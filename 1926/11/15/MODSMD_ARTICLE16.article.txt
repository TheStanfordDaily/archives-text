# ROUGHS TRADITIONS UPHELD, SAYS RETIRED WATCHMAN

### Douglas R. Fuller 
"They're a little more quiet now-a
days" and they "tog up a bit different,"
but at the bottom Stanford men of to
day are just the same as the Stanford
roughs of tradition, in the opinion of
Charles E. (Dad) Wooster, former En

France, at thirty cents a gallon.
Dad Knew Founders
Dad, now 78 years of age, is a rather
short, jovial man, with an extremely
