# ROUGHS TRADITIONS UPHELD, SAYS RETIRED WATCHMAN
## 
### Douglas R. Fuller 
"They're a little more quiet now-a
days" and they "tog up a bit different,"
but at the bottom Stanford men of to
day are just the same as the Stanford
roughs of tradition, in the opinion of
Charles E. (Dad) Wooster, former En
cina nightwatchman who probably
knows more of Stanford men and tra
ditions than any man living, when
questioned Saturday as to how modern
Stanford men compare with those of
the past.
Recalls Wild Times
"We used to have some pretty wild

lame for them except "holy terrors."
He said that the Stanford teams were
?o rough that the "Berkeley boys" re
fused to play them for a number of
Fears.
After the games, according to Dad,
lie teams would adjourn to Menlo,

een saloons. Dad favors prohibition,
)Ut he still has a soft spot in his
Heart for the Menlo wine, which was
jo good they used to ship it clear to
Prance, at thirty cents a gallon.
Dad Knew Founders
Dad, now 78 years of age, is a rather
short, jovial man, with an extremely
ndividual old hat which ho wears at
i rakish angle, and a curving whito
mustache that expresses perpetual
