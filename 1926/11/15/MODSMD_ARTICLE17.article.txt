# BONFIRE BUILDING CENSURED AT MIDNIGHT CLASS MEETING
## 1930 Charged With Refusal To Work or Follow Directions CO-OPERATION LACKING Sophomores Indifferent, Fail To Supervise Labor Efficiently 
### 
With practically every man in the
freshman class gathered in the lobby
of Encina at midnight last night, a
group of upperclassmen charged the
pajama-clad first-year men with gen
eral laxity in building the bonfire.
This sudden action came as a result
of the present condition of the pyre
being prepared for the Big Game rally
Wednesday.
At the present time there is a base
for a fire about nineteen feet high con
structed of solid materials, but the
fire itself is still in the stage of plan
ning.
The causes of this are attributed to
the following facts in the opinion of
those now directing the work:
1. Tlie freshmen have refused to do
the actual labor on the construction.
2. When working I hey refuse to fol
low the directions of those in charge.
3. The sophomore class has taken
absolutely no interest in the affair.
The sophomores on the committee
have failed to function as members.
4. As a result of the last difficulty
the freshmen started off with inade
quate instructions and leadership. The
bonfire was practically remodeled this
week-end because of poor construc
tion.
5. A lack of co-operation within the
freshman class as a whole.
This time last year the pile was
close to forty feet high and by six
o'clock Tuesday morning of the pre
mature burning it was completed.
Some wood was still being added
merely because it was on hand.
Bob Titus, chairman of bonfire com
: mittees in the past and constructor of
i the emergency fire last year, is now
practically in charge of the construc
! tion work. He promises some sem
; hlance of a bonfire by Wednesday
night even if the freshmen continue
to refuse to work. It may only be a
boarded framework but he guarantees
a big blaze. If the freshmen change
their attitude it is entirely possible
that a solid bonfire can be constructed
forty feet high. The original plans
called for a sixty-foot height.
j "It is not possible to build the struc
j ture over forty feet no matter how
! much help we get," says Titus. But
j from the change in attitude evidenced
by the midnight mass meeting his
statement may be subject to correc
tion.
In the opinion of many upperclass
men the freshman committee has done
everything possible and the present
structure is due soieiy to its effort?
The present crisis is due to the fact
that it lias failed to receive the aid
of the class as a whole.
Yesterday morning thirteen fresh
men were at work. In the afternoon
nine freshmen were seen struggling
with a thirty-foot pole in an attempt
to build an approach to the thirty
foot level of the skeleton framework.
A crew of thirty men could have been
j used but it was not available.
With Titus in charge, the faulty
construction has been rectified. The
original three-foot runway to the cen
ter of the fire for carrying in timber
I has been widened ten feet. The cliim

ney-like hole down the center of the
pile about twelve by twenty-five feet
in size, intended for a flue, has been
fiilled in with solid materials. The ties
that v/ere laced loosely thirty feet up
in the air have been torn down and
the present approximate twenty feet
has been made solid. It was impossible
to change the width of the base which
is deemed entirely too big.
Motor trucks and wagons are now
available, the material is reported
spotted, and the chairman is waiting
for the labor which was promised at
the ''rn,)r\r>iV>>f mqcc "
