# BONFIRE BUILDING CENSURED AT MIDNIGHT CLASS MEETING
## 1930 Charged With Refusal To Work or Follow Directions CO-OPERATION LACKING Sophomores Indifferent, Fail To Supervise Labor Efficiently 
### 
With practically every man in the
freshman class gathered in the lobby
of Encina at midnight last night, a
group of upperclassmen charged the
pajama-clad first-year men with gen
eral laxity in building the bonfire.
This sudden action came as a result
of the present condition of the pyre
being prepared for the Big Game rally
Wednesday.
At the present time there is a base
for a fire about nineteen feet high con
structed of solid materials, but the
fire itself is still in the stage of plan
ning.
The causes of this are attributed to
the following facts in the opinion of
those now directing the work:
1. Tlie freshmen have refused to do
the actual labor on the construction.
2. When working I hey refuse to fol
low the directions of those in charge.
3. The sophomore class has taken
absolutely no interest in the affair.
The sophomores on the committee
have failed to function as members.
4. As a result of the last difficulty
the freshmen started off with inade
quate instructions and leadership. The
bonfire was practically remodeled this
week-end because of poor construc
tion.
5. A lack of co-operation within the
freshman class as a whole.
This time last year the pile was
close to forty feet high and by six
o'clock Tuesday morning of the pre
mature burning it was completed.
Some wood was still being added
merely because it was on hand.
