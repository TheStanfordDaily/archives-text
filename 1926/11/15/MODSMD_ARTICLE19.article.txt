I Struggling forward with the big
; hJack coffin containing the last de
crepit remains of the Golden Bear,
| Coach Nibs Price and a motley crew
<jf sorrowing Bruin football men will
be official pallbearers tonight at the
i Sequoia Club wake, which will leave
j the undertaking parlors at 7 o'clock
and past Roble, the Row, and on down
;to the bonfire, where the last rites
will take place and the deceased Bear
will be placed on the funeral pyre to
| join his predecessors of past years in
; a cloud of smoke at the Big Game
j rally.
The funeral procession, held annu
ally under the direction of Sequoia
Club, will be headed by a band play
ing music suitable for such a sad occa
: sion. Next in line will be the repre
sentations of the California warriors,
pulling a caisson upon which the cof
fin, adorned with a big C, will rest in
state. The rear of the wake will be
brought up by a fyand of mourners
and torchbearers from Sequoia, mourn
ing in a loud and despairing manner.
A few tearful words at the bonfire
will end the mourning, so far as Stan
ford is concerned, at least. The wake
is under the direction of Edward K.
Stimpson, and committee heads who
have prepared for the funeral are:
Donald E. Ituppe, hearse committee;
J. Burton McKim, Dudley E. Cham
