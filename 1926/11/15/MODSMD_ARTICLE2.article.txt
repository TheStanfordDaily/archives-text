In answering the proverbial ques
tion, "Is Mars Inhabited," W. W.
Campbell, president of the University
of California and director of Lick Ob
servatory, Mount Hamilton, declares,
•"I don't know whether we shall ever
solve this problem satisfactorily, but
we have been putting our best efforts
on it.
"Mars is closer to the earth now
than it will be two years hence, and
■we are taking advantage of this fact.
About two weeks ago, at its closest
position, its distance from here was a
mere forty million miles.
"Mars is too far away for us to per
ceive big buildings, if the Martians
have any, and so much more can we
fail to see any inhabitants that might i
be on the planet. Our efforts are lim- J
ited at present to determining whether !
the conditions on the sphere are such j
as to meet the requirements of life |
in the forms known to us.
"I am of the opinion that life exists
in a great many parts of the stellar
universe, perhaps wherever the condi
tions are suitable to sustain life, al
though we may never be able to prove !
this," concludes President Campbell. :
