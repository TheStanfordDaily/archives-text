'I lie Big Game rally bonfire is a tradition which attracts hundreds of
alumni and friends of Stanford to the campus each year. Responsibility j
for its success rests in the hands of the freshman class which is judged
in no small measure by the manner in which the duty is performed.
At present, the bonfire structure is far from what it should be. But
there is still time to make this year's lire as good as any if every man in
the class of '30 gives unstintingly of his time and labor during the few
hours which remain before cremation services for the Golden Bear.
lhe problem was placed squarely before the men of the freshman
class at a midnight meeting in the lobby of Encina Hall. There they were
told by a large number of upperclassmen, representing nearly every
living group on the campus, just exactly what the situation is.
There can be no question, then, but what the men of the class of 1930
know in what direction the path of duty lies. The only question is, will
they take that path?
If they do, it means personal sacrifice. It means manual labor instead
of movies. It means night guarding when nights are cold, instead of
sleep in a warm and fairly comfortable Encina cot. It means broken
appointments. It may even mean calling off a mid-week date or "queen
ing on the Quad."
Seriously, the freshmen at last night's meeting showed the right
attitude. They promised to get out and work on the pyre from now until
it assumes a size commensurate with credit to their class.
If they translate the spirit of that meeting into honest-to-goodness
work, there can be no question of ultimate success. They have a com
petent and hard-working committer to direct their efforts.
And in addition they have the advice and help of an upperclass com
mittee composed of men who have worked on more than one bonfire
and therefore know the whys and wherefors of the business.
Last year the whole student body participated in the building of one
of the greatest bonfires every lighted on the Stanford campus. They
built the fire in something like thirty-six hours and thereby spiked all
rumors as to the death of Stanford Spirit.
I lus year, bv virtue of mistakes which ought now to be forgotten,
the class of 1930 has a similar opportunity. The entire University is
banking on them to make the most of it.
