# "A Great Social Problem"
## 
### 
With an extensive campaign for the repeal of the Wright Act com
pletely shattered as a result of the recent election and the dear old topic
of conversation just about to slide down a notch or two, Stanford is
now faced with a situation which obviously should revive the subject.
Tomorrow an official, authorized, and bonafide election will be held
to determine how many students desire prohibition, partial repeal, or
total repeal.
The results of this poll should get a rise out of the local W.C.T.U.,
Anti-Saloon League, and all the other "Aunties." But nevertheless the
sentiment of the campus must be obtained to aid in securing a general
college feeling on the subject for the National Students Federation. At
its meeting in Ann Arbor next month the topic is to be threshed out
thoroughly.
Aside from this fact it will be very interesting to watch the results
tomorrow, provided everyone casts a ballot. On such a vital national
problem as this, it would be regrettable to have Stanford's opinion only
partially expressed.
During the day almost everyone passes the Law steps at least once,
but if it is not in your usual path take the few extra steps tomorrow and
register your decision.
Say what you think, and let your conscience be your guide!
