Although presenting this power
drama in seven scenes, the cast, which
included six Stanford actors, managed
through intelligent interpretation of
Franz Molner's lines to build up the
play from a slow start to an intense !
climax and Jinale. Stanford students
participating were Kenneth McDou
gall, Robert Sears, Lynn Bramkamp,
David Stollery, Reidar Torjussen, and
Garth Winslow.
"Liliom," Hungarian for "lily" and
slang for "tough," deals with the life,
death, and life after death of Liliom,
a barker for a merry-go-round in Buda
pest. His nature, and its reaction to
love, sentiment, and sympathy, is por- •
trayed with a clear insight and a deep
understanding of the psychology of
such a type. Utterly inarticulate with
respect to his innate feelings, and
covering his every act with a tough

1 bravado, Liliom swaggers through his
affair with Julie, the little servant
girl, loving her, and unable to express
that love; beating her, because "he
couldn't bear to see her weeping."
The first four scenes deal with the
affair between Liliom and Julie, cli
maxing in Liliom's death by suicide
while stealing for Julie and her ex
pected baby. The following scenes
: take the barker to heaven, through
his judgment, and back to earth for
( the single day allowed him, as set
; forth by Hungarian legends.
An original prologue was arranged
through the efforts of Margaret Shedd
Kisich, director, in which a merry-go
round and the excitement around it is
vividly portrayed in pantomine against
• a white screen, to the accompaniment
of typical merry-go-round organ music.
The production will be presented a
second time at the Woman's Club
House next Thursday night, Novem
ber 18. at S:lF> o'clock. Un
