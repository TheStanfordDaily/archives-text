The Editor, Sir:
I heartily agree with the "New Stu
dent" in last Friday's Campus Opinion
Column when he objects to the meth
ods used by the local Young Men's
Christian Association in collecting
money from the parents of Stanford
students.
I went home last summer to be
greeted with the question, "Say, son,
I've been sending money to the Stan
ford Y.M.C.A. because they sent me a
block of literature telling how invalu
able they were to campus life. Just
what good do they do you?"
Now as far as I am concerned I
don't know how they got my home
address, but I do know that they cer
tainly have never been of any use to
me here.
Nevertheless, dad was tricked into
sending them money. A fine bunch of
Christians, they are!
â€”ONE WHO AGREES.
