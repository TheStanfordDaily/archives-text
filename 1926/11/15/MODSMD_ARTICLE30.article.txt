The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford-Washington game of
last Saturday was a great game and
I certainly got my money's worth,
both from watching the contest and
also from the stunts of the rooting
section, as well as the band. I pur

posely chose a seat across the stadium
from the Stanford rooting section in
order to get a good vantage point to
see the rooting section stunts pulled
oft'. But H cost me two dollars to
fit on that side of the stadium, the
same as it would have cost on the
other side, and where I got the benefit
of a good view of the rooting section
there was one thing of interest which
I and all the other spectators on that
side of the stadium missed, and that
was the between-halves announcement
of the scores of other football games.
The announcer (there being only one)
did his best to a-ccominodate us but
as he endeavored to inform the in
terested audience of the score stand
ings, it appeared that it was then time
for the rooting section to pull a few
yells. A great many people around
where I was sitting expressed their
disappointment in not being able to
| get the football results. I would sug-
I gest as a remedy that if one announcer
has not ample time to favor the entire
audience that he be given one or two
assistants so that all may be favored
alike, or if this is impossible, why
not show courtesy to the visitors in-
I stead of being partial to the Stanford
| side of the stadium! â€”A FAN.
