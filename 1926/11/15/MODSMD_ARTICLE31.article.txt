## DRY MARTINI by JOHN THOMAS 
### 
Geo. H. Doran & Co., .$2.50
Whether dry martinis should be
mixed half gin and half vermouth or
two-thirds gin and one-third vermouth
has long been perplexing the best bar
tenders of two continents. Another
thing is the very great problem of just
how much lemon to use. So far, the
main ingredients of the attribute love,
have not been a part of the problem.
Mr. Thomas, a very dextrous and
rather sleight-of-hand drink mixer, has
taken porto flips, silver fizzes, both
kinds of love, several very attractive
ladies, a mixture of gentlemen, one
gaga, and many lumps of sugar, stir
red these elements without disturbing
their poise, and has called the result
ant concoction "Dry Martini." The
drink is not nearly as bad as it sounds.
Really quite nice. But "nice" is all we
can say about it. Not a bit stimulating
or invigorating or in fact anything
that a good, long drink should be.
Our gentle hero, a certain Willough
by Quimby, upon hearing of the arrival
of a long-lost daughter, decides to
throw over his old love, the grape,
known to him only as dry martini. Mr.
Quimby is thrown into several slightly
unpleasant affairs, imagines himself
in love on two or three occasions, tries
his best to untangle the afore-men
tioned unpleasant affairs, and dis
covers that things go on as if he were
non-existent. In fact events proceed
without touching Mr. Quimby. Even
the objects of his all-powerful love
move to other gentlemen after thank
ing him for the implied compliment.
So in the approved manner of the fa
talistsj Mr. Quimby retraces his steps
and seeks "la premier amour." One
admires this gentleman's placid na
ture, for he is seldom excited.
The numerous allusions to love and
drink and (he like will lead the reader
to suspect that the action takes place
in Paris. Need we say that such a
guess is eminently correct? And in
the manner of most novels of Anglo-
Parisian life, many places are men
tioned. Places where one sees this and
that.; places where one does this or
does not do that; and placcs where
most anything may happen or nearly
everything may be seen.
Taken in one gargantuan gulp, "Dry
Martini" is not harmful. Even the most
august, body of embryo lawmakers,
the W.C.T.U., will be hard pressed to
find the necessary percentage of kick,
in order to have the book "verboten."

However, the Watch and Ward Society
may possibly find some incriminating
situations and take proceedings to
have the book publicly burned. This
possibility, however alarming, is most
remote and need not bother either the
author or the publishers.

Whether dry martinis should be
mixed half gin and half vermouth or
two-thirds gin and one-third vermouth
has long been perplexing the best bar
tenders of two continents. Another
thing is the very great problem of just
how much lemon to use. So far, the
main ingredients of the attribute love,
have not been a part of the problem.
Mr. Thomas, a very dextrous and
rather sleight-of-hand drink mixer, has
taken porto flips, silver fizzes, both
kinds of love, several very attractive
ladies, a mixture of gentlemen, one
gaga, and many lumps of sugar, stir
red these elements without disturbing
their poise, and has called the result
ant concoction "Dry Martini." The
drink is not nearly as bad as it sounds.
Really quite nice. But "nice" is all we
can say about it. Not a bit stimulating
or invigorating or in fact anything
that a good, long drink should be.
Our gentle hero, a certain Willough
by Quimby, upon hearing of the arrival
of a long-lost daughter, decides to
throw over his old love, the grape,
known to him only as dry martini. Mr.
Quimby is thrown into several slightly
unpleasant affairs, imagines himself
in love on two or three occasions, tries
his best to untangle the afore-men
