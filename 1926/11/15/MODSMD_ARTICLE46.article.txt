"I believe young people today are
generally unhappy," said Mrs. Lucy
Jenkins Franklin, dean of women at
Boston University.

"When I hear a person say that
youth today cares only for pleasure
and thrills, I challenge the statement,"
declared Mrs. Franklin. "They are
bored with themselves because they
do not understand themselves and are
seeking release. They are groping for
something real, true, tangible in life.
Just now they are muddling through."
The Boston dean says that if youth
could be taught to consider themselves
as ethical beings and contributors to
an ethical world, they would be im
measurably helped.
"It is the young-old father and moth
er," she says, "who educate and re
educate themselves in order to under
stand their children, and keep the con
fidence of their children at whatever
cost to their prejudices, who will solve
the problem of youth's unhappiness."
