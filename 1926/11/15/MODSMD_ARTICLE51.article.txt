# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is a "star of other days," who,
it is claimed by many, including his
own coach, was the greatest football
player of all time. For Willie Ileston,
Michigan, '01-'()4, was a remarkable all
around player; and, combining as he
did great strength and weight with
tremendous speed, and aided by a
great love for the game, as well as the
determination and perserverance to
succeed, it is little wonder that he
could batter his way through the line
and run like a deer in a broken field.
Ileston did not have to contend with
the modern open game which includes
the forward pass, but Coach Fielding
11. Yost is of the opinion that Willie
would have been even greater with the
further opportunities that the game of
today offers.
Ileston, as halfback on the Wolver
ine eleven from 1901 to 1904, inclusive,
was the terror of the West, and his
slashing, tearing drives off tackle were

1 almost impossible to stop. He was
equally good on attack at either side
of the line, or in skirting the ends,
1 where his tremendous speed showed
jto great advantage. It is said that
Heston was such a fast starter that he
could defeat the famous Archie Hahn,
of Olympic fame, in a fifty-yard dash.
It was some job to tackle this 185-
pound streak of lightning, for ho used
his high knee action or his powerful
straight arm to advantage when cor
j nered and thus repulsed many an op
' ponentâ€”usually with sanguinary loss
es to the enemy. On defense, the re
doubtable Willie was equally good,
being tireless and brainy in his stop
ping of the enemy attack.
Willie Heston went to Michigan
from (he Far West, and was the sec
ond Westerner to be chosen on Wal
ter Camp's All-American teams,
ac hieving that honor in 1903 and 1904.
He is now a judge in Detroit.
