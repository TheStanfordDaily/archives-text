# AVIATION IN HANDS OF COLLEGE MEN-BYRD
## 
### 
"The future of American aviation rests
in the hands of the youth of the coun
try, especially in the hands of the college
men," stated Lieutenant - Commander
Richard Byrd, polar airman, in an inter
view printed in the Harvard Crimson.
"Fortunately," he says, "there is some
thing about flying that has captivated the
imagination of young Americans. So
long as this spirit persists, our progress
in the air will be guaranteed.
"Aviation has been prematurely ex
ploited by newspapers. Airplanes arc not
yet safe; they are not as yet commer
cially practicable. It should be generally
recognized that airplanes are undergoing
a slow evolution.
"Many people are discouraged because
America at present seems backward in
developing aviation. They must remem
ber that European aerial progress is
largely due to government subsidies. In
my mind, this sort of progress is arti
ficial and highly undesirable. Our aerial
evolution is slow but thorough."
