Tryouts to choose the two Stanford
debaters will be held at 2 o'clock, No
vember 30, in the Little Theatre. The
committee of judges will be announced
before that time.
Science Topic Chosen
The question will be, "Resolved,
That we have more to fear than to
hope from science." This was the sub
ject of the Stanford-University of Sid
ney, Australia, debate held a short
time ago. Either side of the question
may be upheld. It will also be the
subject of the proposed Yale and other
debates.
Speeches will be limited to five min
utes, with a rebuttal of three minutes.
The opposing colleges will have the
privilege of choosing the side of the
question that they wish to uphold, and
the Stanford team will take the oppo
site side. This gives the man who
wishes to prepare for either side of
the question for the tryouts an oppor
