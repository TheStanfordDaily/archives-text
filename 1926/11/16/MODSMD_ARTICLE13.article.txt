# FRESHMEN MAINTAIN ALL-NIGHT VIGIL AT PYRE FIREBUGS PREMATURELY BURN 1925 STRUCTURE SIMILAR ATTEMPTS FRUSTRATED IN OTHER YEARS
## 
### 
Special cordons of freshmen are i
maintaining an all-night guard to pre
vent a recurrence of the premature
burning of the Big Game bonfire which
took place last year for the first time
since the World War. 4
At 6:20' o'clock on the morning of
November 17, shortly after the fresh- \
j man guard had left the structure, men
in Eneina noticed flames licking ftp !
the sides of the pile. Due to the head- j
way gained by the flames it was be
lieved that attempts to extinguish
(hem would prove fruitless. An im
promptu rally was staged on the spot,
and the entire student, body immedi
' ately started work on a larger pyre
scarcely fifty feet from the smoulder
ing ruins.
In 1018, soon after the Armistice
i was signed, no unlooked-for difficul
! tics prevented the regular course of

construction and the rally was held as
scheduled. In 1020 two time bombs
placed in the structure nearly caused
its destruction, but guarding freshmen
successfully put out the blaze before
any serious damage was done.
Tn 1022 firebugs again attempted to
kindle the stack before the rally, this
time by dropping phosphorous bombs
from a low-flying airplane. The bombs,
however, fell twenty feet clear of the
bonfire, exploding harmlessly.
The following year six men seen in
a closed car were believed to have
been responsible for a frustrated at
tempt to succeed where others failed.
Oil was scattered about the base of
the pyre, a flame was started, but was
extinguished in time by a passerby.
In 1024 no attempt was made to
burn the stack before the appointed
time.
