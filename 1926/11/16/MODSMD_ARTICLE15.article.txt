# HOWARD. WEST WILL MEET IN FINALS OF 1929 NET MATCHES
## 
### 
Kenneth W. Howard and Robert P.
West advanced to the final round of
the sophomore class tennis tourna
ment yesterday with merited victories
over Horace A. Barker and John M.
Williams, respectively. The match will
be played next Wednesday on the var
sity courts at two o'clock.
Both finalists were members of the
freshman squad last year, though they
did not play against California. How
ard, a left-hander, strengthens a de
pendable backcourt game with a fast
slice service which enables him to
rush the net at critical times. West
relies on clean, deep drives, forcing
his opponent out of position before
attempting to volley.
In the junior class bracket, James
V. Mansfield gained the final round by
defeating Frank M. Dunn, sixth rank
ing varsity player, in three hard sets,
G-4, 1-6, 8-G. Mansfield now meets the
winner of the match between M.
Comer Thomas and Willard C. Sperry,
who advanced at the expense of Wil
liam Irvine and Eugene Duval, respec
tively.
The seniors have reached the semi
final round, where Leighton M. Bled
soe meets Allen D. Christensen and
Harry T. Todd plays Ned E. Wheldon
to determine the finalists.
Two freshmen, Frank B. Lee and
Ben W. James, have reached the semi
final round in the 'SO tournament, and
I are now awaiting the completion of
j other matches.
When the respective class cham
pions have been determined, an inter
class tournament will be held, the
i winner receiving a gold medal. All
letter and numeral men are barred
: from the competition.
