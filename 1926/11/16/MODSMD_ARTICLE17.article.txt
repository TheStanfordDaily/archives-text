# STUDENT BODY VOTE ON DRINK QUESTION TO BE HELD TODAY
## Law Steps Polls to Be Open From 8 to 2 O'clock For Balloting PART OF NATIONAL POLL Figures Sought by Students Federation to Serve as College Opinion 
### 
Polls will be open from 3 to 2
o'clock today at the Law steps for
voting on prohibition. Repeal of
the present laws, modification, or
continuation of the existing situa
tion are up for consideration of
student opinion.
Stanford will have an opportunity
to express its opinion on the proliibi-
I lion question today. The poll is a part
of a movement being made under the
direction of the National Student
Federation of America, an association
,of American university and college
| student bodies, to ascertain student
opinion on topics of national import
! a rice.
Chooses Yearly Topic
Last year the Federation attempted
; to secure a centralization of under
i graduate ideas on United States par
| ticipating in the World Court. Three
schools out of 250 voted against the
court. The Federation incorporated
: this vote into a resolution which was
| presented to Congress.
"This national student vote," said
, Robert E. Lewis, Stanford's delegate
: to last year's convention, "is coming
i to bear more and more significance
j in national politics. Newspapers con
j sidered the convention last year im
portant enough to have it covered by
i a large staff of reporters, and the re
| suit of the vote on the World Court
was carried in headlines in every New
York paper and given in press reports
throughout the country.
"I believe there will be even more
attention attracted by the prohibition,
vote, which will be tabulated at the
convention at Ann Arbor next month,
ft is very desirable that Stanford opin
ion be represented by a large vote
! today."
The ballots to be filled in will indi
i cate, first, whether the student body
j favors the present prohibition laws,
modification, or repeal. An important
addition to the ballot, made with the
t design to achieve something more
j than a straw vote, is a space in which
| voters are requested to state briefly
the reasons they have for voting as
j they do.
The poll will close at 2 o'clock. The
results of the referendum will be ap
proved at the Executive Committee
meeting tonight and will be printed
I in the Daily tomorrow. Stanley Weigel
' will represent Stanford at the Federa
tion convention at the University of
Michigan, December 3, and will pre
j sent the result of today's vote.
