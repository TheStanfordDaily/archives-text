# STUDENTS SCALPING BIG GAME TICKETS WARNED BY COUNCIL
## 
### 
Warning to students who intend to
scalp Big Game tickets was issued by the
Men's Council at its meeting yesterday.
Several students were promptly dropped
from school last fall when caught scalp
ing. and, according to Merrill Armour,
chairman, action on the part of this
year's committee will be equally swift.
As was the rule last year, students will
be held for violations and will forfeit
ticket privileges in the future if they, or
persons who receive their tickets, sell
the tickets for a gain.
Two alleged cases of violation of the
Honor System were heard by the Council
yesterday and dismissed for lack of evi
dence in each instance.
The Council also issued a warning to
students who persist in passing worth
less checks. This practice, which is usu
ally the result of carelessness, is a great
source of trouble to the University and
its departments, states Armour, and the
Council has adopted strict regulations on
the subject.
