# Vote as You Drink!
## 
### 
Appropriately enough, just before an anticipated celebration of a vic
tory over California the question of prohibition is brought tip for a student
body vote.
In view of the fact that the most popular indoor sport of the day among
magazine writers is the narration of the exploits alcoholic of the American
college student, it is of really vital importance that we learn just what
the collcge student does think of drinking, and of prohibition.
Today's ballot has been instigated by the National Student Federation
of America. Its intention is to find out not only what the college student
thinks of prohibition, but why he thinks as he does. This information can
be obtained only by a secret ballot, because any opinion issued by officials
of the University is almost bound to be colored by the external mpression
of student morals that the University's officials wish to make.
There are few men or women in Stanford who are not interested in
the prohibition question. It is highly desirable that they express their
opinion. It would be regrettable if the lethargic attitude that accompanies
most A.S.S.U. elections were to be allowed to intrude and prevent the
results of this poll from being regarded as an expression of the attitude
of the entire student body.
In practice, the opinion of Stanford students appears to be divided.
There are among us those who drink, and those who do not. That we have
encountered an impressive preponderance of the former may or may not
be significant. In any event, it is not particularly significant to this poll,
which is purely a theoretical affair, designed to discover what the student
thinks about drinking, not what he docs about it.
When you are on the Quad tomorrow, stop for a few moments, and let
the world know what you think.
