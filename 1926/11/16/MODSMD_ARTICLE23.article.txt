Voluntary chapel at Yale, about

was first announced, Is a success, says
the Yale Alumni Weekly.
"The campus evidently has accepted
the responsibility of inaugurating the
new plan, which in itself, is the best
augury of its success," states the
alumni magazine. "The chaplain of the
day no longer speaks from the pulpit
in Battell, far removed from his audi
ence. He meets them on more com
panionable ground by standing in
frftnt of the choir seats. Tlie daily
music is of the highest order and the
organ program is announced in ad
vance." J
