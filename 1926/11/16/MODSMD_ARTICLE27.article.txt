HERE'S HOW! !
Today is dedicated to an expression
of what we laughingly call student
opinion. In this particular instance, a
poll is being conducted to ascertain
what, if anything, the Stanford student
thinks about the Eighteenth Amend- !
ment.
Do not vote as we tell you! Vote as j
you think!
If you don't think, don't vote. If
!
you tninK tne country shuuiu remain
dry, don't vote either. If you think it i
should become wet, make believe it is
a student body presidential election i
and vote twice.
"Impartiality at any cost!" is the j
motto of this column.
Seriously, however, we would like
to see an honest expression of student
opinion on this matter. Since the ear
liest days at Stanford, the liquor ques
tion has occupied a large and import
ant place in campus discussion. Origi
nally, drinking was unhampered on the
campus. The local prohibition was im
posed on the students by action of the
administration. Menlo Park and May
field then became the centers for the
convivial gatherings of Stanford's

' sons. Later, Menlo was eliminated, and
Mayfleld became the last stronghold
of the stein-hoisters.
Then, in the mad frenzy of idealism
I and sentimentalism that accompanied
and followed the war in America, na
tional prohibition was passed.
Laboring under the misapprehension
that this political gesture would affect
| a local inconvenience, the male resi
| dents of Stanford gave vent to a flood
of tears. A short time later, the said
| flood was put to shame by a much
j more imposing affair, a deluge, liter-
I ally, of bootleg gin.

Today, the Stanford student drinks,
jHe does not drink comparatively
j harmless beer within the confines of
his fraternity house or dormitory. In
| stead, he insults his oesophagus with
that foul product which has given Mr.
Gordon of London ample grounds for a
libel suit, if only he could decide
upon whom to sue.
To our mind, there is no contending
that the local situation has improved.
The vote we cast today shall be drip
| ping wet. Furthermore, we hope the
election committee finds it necessary
| to keep the ballots in a bucket.
