The Editor, Sir:
There have been several letters recently
in your column attacking' the Y.M.C.A.
If such anonymous, destructive criticizers
would keep their eyes and ears open
more, and try to see where they could
build up rather than tear down, they
would not be subject to the pity of those
who know facts. 1 would ask our friend
"One Who Agrees" to glance over the
page in which his letter appeared and see
if his criticism that the "Y" does nothing
for students is justifiable. This is just
one instance of "Y 1 ' service and it sure
makes our friend's argument look sick.
We get just about as much out of life as
we put into it, and this holds true for the
Y.M.C.A., which, after all, is an associ
ation of students. The "Y" is all em
bracing in its activities, and offers oppor
tunity to all for service, fellowship, and
group thinking. We Stanford men are
not all Christians, as our friends "New
Student" and "One Who Agrees" must
consider themselves in order to feel justi
fied in criticizing a Christian association,
for if we were, what would be the use
in maintaining a campus Y.M.C.A.?
The Editor, Sir:
For several years, dating from about
the regime of the brothers Irwin, there
has been fostered on the Stanford cam
pus the idea that a freshman is a rational
being, to be allowed to decide for himself
what he will or will not do in regard to
matters of custom. He abandons the
lowly corncob pipe for "the more noble
cigarette, and the campus as a whole

j commends, or at least condones, his initia
j tive. He discards as a worn-out tradi-
I tion the time-honored "dink" (a small
gray skull-cap with a red button, for
! merly worn by first-year men students at
| Stanford), and we murmur, "So be it,
| for he has chosen." He "queens" on the
Quad, for so his fancy dictates.
Hence the surprise with which we learn
from Monday's "Daily" that the Class
of 1930 has been roundly censured by Ye
Editor and "a large number of upper
classmen" for its lack of enthusiasm re
garding the Bonfire. Here is inconsis
tency indeed! Why should we permit
(yea, even encourage) the frosh to de
cide for himself what he will do with the
cigarette, the "dink" (see note above),
and the Quad, and attempt to dictate to
him in this, which is after all only "an
other tradition"? Did it not occur to
the nocturnal group of upperclassmen
that perhaps the Bonfire, too, had been
weighed in the balance of first-year wis
dom and found wanting?
Do we stand for the 1930-model frosh,
| with his independence, his assurance, and
his eloquently critical contributions to
! this column, or do we stand for tradi
| tions? Whichever stand we may take, let
i us strive for more consistency than char
-1 acterizes the present incident.
