### 
Opportunity for registered students
to obtain tickets for the "Football
Gaieties of in preference to
mailed applications will be given at
the sale to be held at 1 o'clock this
afternoon in the A.S.S.U. ticket office
in the Old Union.. Twelve thousand
applications for tickets to this show,
which will be produced under the
auspices of the Dramatic Council next
Friday evening, have been mailed to
Stanford alumni, but Robert Cecil,
dramatic manager, has announced that
students will have first choice at the
sale today.
Ram's Head Society, associated in
recent years with a winter burlesque
production, has this year embarked
upon a plan to sponsor the "Gaieties"
thus embodying the five principles for
which the organization was founded;
namely, writing of original music,
writing of original acts, dancing, act
ing, and stage-designing. The "Gaie

ties" program has been constructed
with these principles in view, and is a
modification of a style employed in
several New York revues, notably
"Cherry Pie."
Four one-act plays, two from the
"Music Box Revue" and two written
by Dave Lamson, former editor of the
"Chaparral," form the body of the pro
gram, while several other numbers
such as the " A ryprirana." with jazz
exemplified to i > s highest degree, the
Boone-King-Boone dancing act, and the
A 1 Cass-Peggy Randall skit round out
the entertainment.
The chorus is being trained under
the direction of Chrysella Dunker
Kiler, while Gordon Hall is directing
the musical program. Gordon Davis,
dramatic director, is in charge of the
"Gaieties."
Characters for the program were
chosen from students with previous
experience in Stanford dramatics, no
open tryouts being held.
