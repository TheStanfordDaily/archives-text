# Louis Vierne Composition To Be Played by W.D.Allen
## 
### 
"Carillon in 15 Flat," a composition t
of Louis Vierne, will open the organ
concert to be given this afternoon at
4:15 in the Memorial Church by War
ren D. Allen, University organist. The '
number will be followed by two
sketches by Schumann, Opus 58, No. 4
in D flat, and Opus 58, No. 2 in C
major. Neither of these sketches has
ever been given before at the Univer
sity organ recitals.
Two choral preludes, one by Max
Reger and the other by J. S. Bach, i

will conclude the program. Tho differ
ence in treatment of the theme on
which both were based, the Chorale
"Schmucke dich, O Liebe Seele"
("Adorn Thyself, My Soul, with Glad
ness") shows the points of view of the
two composers.
