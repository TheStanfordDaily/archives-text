# WASHINGTON STATE WINS SECOND PLACE IN COAST STANDING
## Stanford Maintains Leading Position in Conference; Six Teams Play 
### George W. Story 
Six Pacific Coast Conference foot
ball teams played games Saturday,
four of them participating in contests
which counted in the standings and
the other two meeting non-conference
rivals. Washington State cinched sec
ond place in defeating Oregon 7 to 0.
The main headliner of the day was
the. Stanford-Washington struggle,
from which the Redshirts emerged vic
torious by a score of 29 to 10, thereby
chalking up uieir third consecutive
conference victory and tightening their
hold on the championship. The Cardi
nals have only California standing
between them and the title, and Sat
urday they will try to remove that last
obstacle from their path.
W.S.C. Wins
In the other conference game, Wash
ington State defeated Oregon 7 to 0
at Pullman, recording its fourth
straight victory in games against
league opponents. The win boosted the
Cougars into second place in the stand
ing.
After losing five contests in a row,
the Golden Bear broke the bad habit
he has acquired and turned in a 20 to
fi victory over Nevada, and the Mon
tana squad surprised Northwest fans
by winning from Whitman 57 to 7.
Two weeks ago Washington beat
Whitman 44 to 0, but Montana is by
no means in the class with the Hus
kies.
Best on Coast
The Stanford victory displayed the
fact once again that the Redshirts
have the power to score when scores
are necessary. After having piled up
a 10-point lead, the Cards allowed the
Huskies to tie the count and then pro
ceeded to amass 19 markers in the
closing period and win by a large
margin.
The Redshirts proved Saturday that
they are probably the best team on
the Pacific Coast and one of the best
in the country, ranking with Brown,
Notre Dame, Army, Navy, and the
other leaders in the East.
Cougars Place High
Washington State, under Coach Babe
Hollingbery, finished its conference
schedule by beating Oregon, and by
so doing assured itself of a place very
close to the top of the league stand
ings. The Cougars completed one of
the most successful seasons they have
enjoyed in recent years, dropping only
one game, that to U.S.C., by a score of
16 to 7.
During their march they have won
from Washington, Idaho, Montana,
and Oregon.
The game against the Lemon Yellow
rleven from Eugene last Saturday was
played on a slippery field at Pullman,
which made anything but straight foot
bnll too dangerous to attempt. The
•winners scored their lone touchdown
on line bucks and then played a safe
game. The wet field made Oregon's
overhead attack useless and the Cou
gar forwards stopped whatever line
plays the Webfeet attempted.
Bruins Win
California showed flashes of power
to beat. Nevada 20 to 6, but the Bruin
is still not in a position to worry
Stanford, and it appears as though
the Reds are destined to finish their
schedule unbeaten. Montana's over
whelming of Whitman was not ex
pected. The Grizzlies are expected to
win easily enough, but when Washing
ton beat Whitman only 44 units it was
hardly in keeping for Montana to win
by a 50> point margin.
The conference schedule for next
Saturday calls for Stanford to meet
California, Oregon to play 0.A.C., and
Idaho to invade the home of the Tro
jans. W.S.C. has finished its schedule,
Montana has no game for Saturday,
and Washington draws a rest before
its game with Nebraska in the Seattle
stadium on Thanksgiving Day.

The conference schedule for next
Saturday calls for Stanford to meet
California, Oregon to play 0.A.C., and
Idaho to invade the home of the Tro
jans. W.S.C. has finished its schedule,
Montana has no game for Saturday,
and Washington draws a rest before
its game with Nebraska in the Seattle
stadium on Thanksgiving Day.
Six Pacific Coast Conference foot
ball teams played games Saturday,
four of them participating in contests
which counted in the standings and
the other two meeting non-conference
rivals. Washington State cinched sec
ond place in defeating Oregon 7 to 0.
The main headliner of the day was
the. Stanford-Washington struggle,
from which the Redshirts emerged vic
torious by a score of 29 to 10, thereby
chalking up uieir third consecutive
conference victory and tightening their
hold on the championship. The Cardi
nals have only California standing
between them and the title, and Sat
urday they will try to remove that last
obstacle from their path.
W.S.C. Wins
In the other conference game, Wash
ington State defeated Oregon 7 to 0
at Pullman, recording its fourth
straight victory in games against
league opponents. The win boosted the
Cougars into second place in the stand
ing.
After losing five contests in a row,
the Golden Bear broke the bad habit
he has acquired and turned in a 20 to
fi victory over Nevada, and the Mon
tana squad surprised Northwest fans
by winning from Whitman 57 to 7.
Two weeks ago Washington beat
Whitman 44 to 0, but Montana is by
no means in the class with the Hus
kies.
Best on Coast
The Stanford victory displayed the
fact once again that the Redshirts
have the power to score when scores
are necessary. After having piled up
a 10-point lead, the Cards allowed the
Huskies to tie the count and then pro
ceeded to amass 19 markers in the
closing period and win by a large
margin.
The Redshirts proved Saturday that
they are probably the best team on
the Pacific Coast and one of the best
in the country, ranking with Brown,
Notre Dame, Army, Navy, and the
other leaders in the East.
Cougars Place High
Washington State, under Coach Babe
Hollingbery, finished its conference
schedule by beating Oregon, and by
so doing assured itself of a place very
close to the top of the league stand
ings. The Cougars completed one of
the most successful seasons they have
enjoyed in recent years, dropping only
one game, that to U.S.C., by a score of
16 to 7.
During their march they have won
from Washington, Idaho, Montana,
and Oregon.
The game against the Lemon Yellow
rleven from Eugene last Saturday was
played on a slippery field at Pullman,
which made anything but straight foot
bnll too dangerous to attempt. The
•winners scored their lone touchdown
on line bucks and then played a safe
game. The wet field made Oregon's
overhead attack useless and the Cou
gar forwards stopped whatever line
plays the Webfeet attempted.
Bruins Win
California showed flashes of power
to beat. Nevada 20 to 6, but the Bruin
is still not in a position to worry
Stanford, and it appears as though
the Reds are destined to finish their
schedule unbeaten. Montana's over
whelming of Whitman was not ex
pected. The Grizzlies are expected to
win easily enough, but when Washing
ton beat Whitman only 44 units it was
hardly in keeping for Montana to win
by a 50> point margin.
