# Bids to 1929 Cotillion Being Sold to Freshmen
## 
### 
An innovation in the plans for this
year's Sophomore Cotillion is the sell
ing of bids to freshmen. The yearlings
were not allowed to buy bids to the
Cotillion last year, but they are now
on saie to Encina men. This has been
made possible by the issuance of more
invitations.
Bids are going fast, announces the
Cotillion committee. More than half of
the 325 printed have been sold. Be
ginning this week they will be on sale
at the stationery counter in the Book
store, and not in the Old Union.
Programs will arrive three or four
days before the dance and will be ob
tainable by presenting bids at the j
Bookstore.
