# STANFORD CARDINALS TO SEEK SECLUSION FOLLOWING BONFIRE
## Stiff Workouts Planned for Today and Tomorrow; Rest Before Game 
### 
Stanford's Cardinals rested yesterday
afternoon following their strenuous week
end clash with the University of Wash
ington team. Stanford, thus far unde
feated in the season, has but one more
hurdle to clear if all-Coast honors arc to
be won.
Regular practice for the California
game will begin today with a stiff work
out, which menu will again be given the
squad tomorrow afternoon. Following
the bonfire rally, the team will leave for
the Mount Diablo Country Club, where
it will remain until just before taking the
field against the Blue and Gold.
While they arc away resting for the
contest the players will hold short work
outs, enough to keep them on edge for
the Bruin game. During seclusion much
time will be devoted to chalk talks and
brushing up on fine points of plays.
Every member of the team, with the
exception of Don Hill and Spud Lewis,
is in good condition for the contest. Hill
was injured late in the fourth quarter of
the Washington game, but is expected to
be in shape for playing Saturday. Lewis,
sophomore quarterback, has been troubled
with an injured hip which is not serious
and which will be entirely healed for the
Golden Bear game.
Warner will take no chances of a let
down in the morale of the squad, which
it appears might possibly be the main
danger to Stanford's chances of defeat
ing California and winning the Pacific
Coast Conference championship for the
1926 season.
