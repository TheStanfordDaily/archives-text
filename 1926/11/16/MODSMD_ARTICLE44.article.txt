# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The rest of the United States knew
that good football was played in the
South, long before little Centre College
beat Harvard in 1921 or before Vander
bilt smothered Minnesota in 1924. But
when the sun set over the Rose Bowl
at Pasadena last New Year's day, the
whole sports world woke up with a
bang to the fact that the South played
as good or even better football than
any other part of the country. For
Alabama's 20 to 19 defeat of the Uni
versity of Washington, champions of
the Pacific Coast Conference, opened
the eyes of football fans and critics to
the brilliance and variety of the South-1
erners' play. Their fierce defense, fine j
generalship, and clever use of the for-;
ward pass, made the pickers of Ail-
American teams realize that in over
looking players like Pooley Hubert, j
Mack Brown, and Buckler, they had
missed some very worthy material.
Now the University of Alabama
seems headed for a third straight
Southern Conference championship. It,
is rumored that Tennessee, another
contender which has had a harder
schedule than the Crimson Tide, will
challenge Alabama for a Dixie classic
battle if both elevens come through
the season undefeated. The Green!

Wave of Tulane, which claimed cham
pionship honors with Alabama in 1925,
when both were unbeaten, has fallen
off a lot this year, due mainly to the
loss of "Peggy" Flournoy, who last
season scored 128 points for his col
lege.
There are twenty-two schools in the
Southern Conference. The important
games yet to be played are: Alabama-
Georgia, Georgia Tech-Alabama Poly
(Auburn), Vanderbilt-Sewanee, and
Tennessee-Kentucky.
Among the prominent coaches are
Wallace Wade of Alabama, former All-
American tackle at Brown. At present
he is considered the best of the South
ern coaches. Coach Alexander, of
Georgia Tech, a user of the famous
"Heisman shift," is another former
star player now coaching successfully.
Coaches Clark Shaughnessy, of Tu
lane. and Dan McGugin, of Vanderbilt,
have likewise had great success.
Among the more prominent ball
carriers, mention must be made of
"Red" Barnes, Alabama captain and
halfback; Spears, Vanderbilt quarter
back; Helvey, Sewanee halfback; Bar
ron, Georgia Tech, another halfback
(brother of the famous "Red"); and
Rauber, Washington and Lee fullback.
