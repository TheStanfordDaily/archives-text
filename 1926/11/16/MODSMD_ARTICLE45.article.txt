## 
### 
King Albert of Belgium, the mon
arch who drives his own motorcycle,
has bought his seventh machine of
this type.
The ruler's latest mount, made here,
was displayed at the Olympia motor
cycle show and attracted a great deal
of attention. It is of unusual design,
and when making high speed it. is
almost noiseless, due to an improved
type of silencer.
The King, who is also fond of avia
tion, often makes 200 miles a day, un
accompanied, when out on a motor
cycle spin.
