# Shy Maudine Chosen Queen Now in Glare of Publicity Rules at Ohio Homecoming
## 
### 
Maudine was a shy girl, and
shunned the society of men. She liked
best to wander in green meadows and
pluck daisies and buttercups. But the
glare of publicity has blinded Mau
dine, and no longer is she the simple
creature of a few weeks ago. For she
was nominated on a ticket with ten
other popular and more sophisticated
Ohio State University girls for "Home
coming Queen" at the Michigan game
on November 13. And so powerful was
the masculine vote that she was over
whelmingly elected.
Doubtless Maudine will meet Queen
Marie, and the two royal mothers will
have a friendly chat about their chil
dren and the idiosyncrasies of their
favorite breakfast foorjs. Unfortunate
ly, Queen Maudine has neither the cul
ture nor the pearls to put her on a
social level with the Queen of Ru
mania. For Ohio Maudine Ormsby is
a thoroughbred Holstein cow.
