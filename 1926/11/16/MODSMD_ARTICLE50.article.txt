# A.W.S. of Nebraska Will Celebrate Missouri Game
## 
### 
The Associated Women Students of
the University of Nebraska, who give an
annual luncheon to foster spirit for the
Nebraska-Missouri football game, will
hold their celebration November 13.
1 oasts filled with Cornhusker spirit and
wishes for the success of the team are
given at this yearly get-together.
The meeting which set the precedent
for this tradition was held in 1911. At
that time only about 300 women were in
attendance. This year nearly 1000 women
are expected to attend the luncheon.
