hopefuls marched in effigy about the
Stanford campus last night in mourn- ]
ing for the deceased Golden Bear in
the annual Sequoia Club funeral wake.

the mourners, growing more tearful
as they advanced, proceeded past
Roble, the Row, and Encina, to the
bonfire, where a few words were said
in memory of the Bruins' past fame, j
and a short but eloquent prayer was
offered. Stops were made at Roble, to :
sing a dirge, at Encina, to collect ad- i
ditional friends of the deceased, and j
at the bonfire.

to conceal their grief under a coat I
of official dignity.

Led by Bell-Toller
Headed bv.a bell-toljer mourn
er with a fiery cross, the path of the
procession was lit up by torches burn
ing a mixture of oil and gasoline. Next
in line after the cross came the under- j
taker and the preacher, endeavoring
to conceal their grief under a coat I
of official dignity.
The band, following the undertaker
and preacher, was composed of almost
every known and unknown portable
musical instrument. Coach Price and
his warriors were worthily represented
by the hashers from the Sequoia Eat
ing Club. •
