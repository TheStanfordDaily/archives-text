# A.S.S.U. HANDBOOK PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMEN
## 
### 
An official handbook published by
lhe Associated Students will be pre
sented incoming students next year
as the result of a provision in the re
vised budget which was passed by the
Executive Committee at its meeting
last week. A sufficient sum of money
was set aside for the purpose.
The A.S.S.U. decision was the out
come of discussion and criticism of :
the arrangement by which the Chris-!
tian Associations of the campus issued |
the handbook this year.
A letter from Student Manager
Lewis to the Y.M.C.A. stated: "The
Christian Associations shall issue their
handbook according to their ideas and
without interference from us; the As
sociated Students to put out their own
handbook fun.*',''"'"c. t2>e cpnstjtnlinn.
and by-laws and what other informa- ,
tion they think should go in the book, j
This should eliminated any disagree- j
ment as to editorial policy. It seems j
to mo the only solution to a rather j
unfortunate situation."
If the Y.M.C.A. should decide to pub-1
lish an additional handbook of its own j
incoming students next year will be ]
offered two books, one published by
the Associated Students and the other
printed by the student club. "No de
cision has been made yet," says R. C.
Bell, Y Secretary, speaking for the
Y.M.C.A.
