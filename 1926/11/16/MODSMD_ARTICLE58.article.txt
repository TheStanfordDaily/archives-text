# AFRICANâ€™S CONCEIT FLATTERED BY CHRISTIANITY MOHAMMEDANISM BETTER SUITED FOR NEGRO TROPICAL FEVERS DESCRIBED BY MRS. HELLER
##

"Christianity flatters tlio African's
conceit and does not exert sufficient
moral pressure upon him, and Moham
medanism is better suited, allowing
polygamy, a fundamental institution,"
says Mrs. Edmund Heller, two years |
in central Africa. "There are more
women than men and as the burden
of labor and support is laid upon them I
it is impossible for the negro to accept
the Christian atitude."
; Tropical Fevers
"Some tropical fevers are particu
larly deadly, and greatly feared by the
natives of the African and Amazon
valley jungles," declares Mrs. Heller, j
She is an experienced bacteriologist
attending the Stanford Medical School
in order to continue her work on equa- j
torial native diseases.
From the Sudan to the Portuguese
territory on the South, the true trop
ical fever, malaria, causes both black
and white men to suffer alike. The
scourge is not as greatly dreaded in
Africa as in South America, whore the
fever specialist spent more than a year
in various parts of the Amazon region
of Brazil. "Do not go to the tropics
unless you can stand quinine," advises
the jungle explorer. "It is the only pro
tection from malaria, and if it poisons
you, stay away."
Ascribing the high mortality in the
South American forests to the general
diet which is largely vegetable and
lacking in the necessary proteins to
be secured from meat, eggs, and milk,
Mrs. Heller adds that since in Africa
the white man has the natives of the
black continent to work for him, he
can avoid the intense heat to a greater
degree and be more careful of his food
I supply.
Hookworm
Mrs. Heller claims that one
does not always die of hookworm in
the tropics and the point of view of
the victim seems to be a determining
factor. "When the Indian is infected
! he says with characteristic fatalism,
'One must die of that!' and he does so.
The German, on the other hand, says,
'One must eat a great deal,' and pro
ceeds to cure himself."
Blacks Conservative
After traveling extensively on the
South American and American contl-

I nents, for a period of over three years,
she finds the contrast between the
South American Indian and the black
man to be as interesting as it is
! marked. "The Peruvian is very re
served and phlegmatic and is in the
I main law-abiding, but is not nearly as
amenable to correction and discipline
| as the less-responsible negro. He is
shrewder and makes it a point never
to agree with the white man. If he
j agrees in the first place, there will be
no need to pay him to change his
mind!
"The African has a happier dispo
sition and stands frankly in awe of his
j white masters upon whom he is very
dependent. He has the greatest ad
miration for all mechanical contri- I
| vances," the traveler concluded.
