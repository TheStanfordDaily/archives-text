Charges that "less than ten per cent
comes back to the student body in
services rendered" by the campus
Y.M.C.A., were a recent cause for dis
cussion at Oberlin college.
"If a large amount is to be given by
all the students that a few students
may have a training ground for their
life-work in the 'Y* it is logical to con
clude that the other campus organiza
tions should be given a subsidy for
the same purpose," declared the Ober
lin Review, student newspaper.
The Oberlin Y.M.C.A. manages a
program of religious study and lay
activity—campus mixers, stages, "O"
books are managed in addition to the
religious work. The Y.M.C.A. and the
Y.W.C.A. use forty-five per cent of
the total "Student Chest" which the
entire student body subscribes for
various causes. About thirty-five per
cent of this money goes, according iu
the Review, "not for religious services,
or social events for the student body,
but for offering a small group of stu
dents the opportunity to become ex
perienced in 'Y' work."
