### 
Three string quartets, each an out
standing work of a master of chamber
j music composition, will constitute the
j program which will be given at 8:15
j o'clock tonight by Mischa Elman's
I string ensemble in the Backetball
! Pavilion. The c oncert this evening is
j the second in the series sponsored by
| the A.S.S.U.
One of the best of Haydn's eighty
! three quartet numbers, the work in D
| Minor, is the first selection which the
j ensemble will play. Haydn is regarded
: as the father of instrumental music
| and credited with bringing chamber
j music to its early perfection. The quar
| tet in 1) Minor is typical of his style
| of lucidity, moderation, and finish.
"Opus 74" Included
j Beethoven, a past master of quartet
I composition, is the writer of the sec
; ond number. This work, Opus 74 (Har
fen in Eb), is a product of Beethoven's
most brilliant year, 1809. The excel
lence of the composition is the more
remarkable when the distractions of
1809 are considered. It was in this
year that the French laid long siege
to Vienna, where Beethoven was liv
ing, the sounds of their cannonading
forcing the composer to take refuge in
a cellar.
The final selection to be given by
the quartet is the last and best of
Tschaikowsky's three quartet num
bers, that in E Minor. The composi
tion is dedicated to the memory of a
friend of Tschaikowsky's, the violinist,
Laub, one-time concertmaster of the
Berlin court band.
Quartet Co-ordi/iated
Elman's quartet is eminently fitted
for the interpretation of the numbers
to be given. It is noted for its excellent
co-ordination, a thing absolutely neces
sary in the rendition of chamber
music, in which no one instrument
carries the melody to the accompani
ment of the others, but whore the
sounds of all are integrated into one
whole.
