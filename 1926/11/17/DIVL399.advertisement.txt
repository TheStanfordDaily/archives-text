A Cut-In
| Both Can Enjoy
A Coca-Cola cut-in is
always good taste.
So shines a good drink
in a thirsty world.
IT HAD TO BE GOOD TO GET WHERE IT IS - 7 MILLION A D
BEAT THE GOLDEN BEAR!
I j "It's the Boot
that Wins"
When the score is tied and an extra
point is needed to win the game, "it's
the boot that wins."
When you're at the game or at the
dance and that extra "something" is
needed for you to look your best, "it's
the boot that wins."
When you come to buy that pair of
oxfords to wear at the Big Game, or
that pair of pumps to wear at the
dance, we will show you "the boot
that wins."
