# BIG GAME PYRE NEARS HEIGHT OF FIFTY FEET
## Slight Shortage of Material Handicaps Builders Temporarily BIG "C" PAINTED RED Careful Preparations Made For Guarding Bonfire During Night 
### 
Because of a slight shortage of ma
terial for their bonfire yesterday the
freshman class raised the Big Game
pyre over eight feet during the day
and by'an actual measurement of the
height of the solid material it was
forty-two feet at four o'clock yester
day afternoon.
Work will continue today and the
committee believes if the freshmen
will turn out this morning and after
noon the structure can go over fifty
feet. Reports from Berkeley that Stan
lord men had painted California's big
"C" red were received last night and
over 200 freshmen besides the fresh
man football squad, which had been
assigned to guard it, turned out armed
with every conceivable weapon from
pick-handles to sawed-off baseball
bats. Later reports from Berkeley,
however, were to the effect that it was
a high school trick.
Careful Guarding
Two lines of firehose were stretched
across from the power house to the
base of the fire in case any "pyro
maniacs" tried to burn the pile. A
complete wire fence was strung
around the base and eight small fires
with the guarders divided equally at
each were started up. The freshmen
are taking no chances that the fire
might be burnt down this morning,
as it was one year ago while they
were at breakfast, and will leave a
substantial guard on duty until seven
o'clock tonight, when they turn the
structure over to the care of the
â€¢"hold-overs."
Freshman girls served coffee and
sandwiches all night to the watchers.
Plenty of pep and enthusiasm showed
itself around the separate camps and
it would have boded ill for any "fire
setters" to have attempted a surprise
attack.
