# VOTE FAVORS MODIFICATION OF DRY LAWS
## Stricter Enforcement Urged By Many as Remedy for Existing Evils "TIRED OF FUSEL OIL" 420 Vote for Present Laws, 311 for Repeal, 458 For Modification 
### 
Modification of the present laws to
permit light wines and beers received
the largest number of votes of any of
the three proposals on prohibition at
the special A.S.S.U. poll yesterday. A
total of 1189 votes were cast, of which
420 favored the existing situation, 311
repeal, and 458 modification.
Tired of Fusel Oil
"I am tired of fusel oil," stated one
ardent advocate of prohibition as it
doesn't exist today. The expense of
searching out the elusive purveyor of
the cup that cheers enters into the
opinion of another, who wrote: "I
favor repeal because it would avoid
traveling to San Francisco and San
Jose."
Prohibition enforcement was lauded
with the following, "All kick will be
gone if it is not against the law." One
"Reason Why I Vote as I Do," con
signed Mr. Volstead's law to the eternal
fires and loudly clamored for "bigger
and better liquor stores."
By far the majority of the opinions,
however, represented serious thought
on the subject, as evidenced by sug
gestions that the present generation
does not represent time enough to
work out the idea. Many voted for re
tention of the present statutes, and
urged that a stricter enforcement be
applied as remedy for existing evils.
Many came out for the right of the
individual to decide in the matter.
Others argued for local option, some
for government sale of intoxicants in
regulated stores, and others wrote for
repeal on modification on the grounds
that enforcement was too expensive.
Slightly over one-third of the women
students registered an opinion. Of the
180 votes, 84 went for retention of
prohibition, 24 for repeal, and 78 for
modification.
Some of the reasons advanced by
the women for the choice of their
votes are highly humorous. One fair
voter believed that men get what they
want when they want it; so, she con
sidered, it was immensely better to
let them get the stuff fairly and
squarely. Another one thought that
modification could not make things
any worse than they now are. "I do
not believe there should be any pro
hibition at all," was clearly written
on one ballot.
Best Write-In
The best write-in of all was found
in the women's box and stated that
the voter was in favor of light wines
and beers because they were less in
toxicating than hard liquors.
The men's vote totaled 1003, of
which the largest number, 380, favored
modification. Prohibition polled 336 of
these votes and repeal 287.
The question was brought up at the
insistence of the National Student
Federation of America, which is con
ducting a national poll of the subject
with a view of attaining a centraliza
tion of American undergraduate opin
ion. It is likely that the Stanford vote,
combined with 250 other colleges and
universities, will be put before Con
gress in the form of a resolution.

votes are highly humorous. One fair
voter believed that men get what they
want when they want it; so, she con
sidered, it was immensely better to
let them get the stuff fairly and
squarely. Another one thought that
modification could not make things
any worse than they now are. "I do
not believe there should be any pro
hibition at all," was clearly written
on one ballot.
Best Write-In
The best write-in of all was found
in the women's box and stated that
the voter was in favor of light wines
and beers because they were less in
toxicating than hard liquors.
The men's vote totaled 1003, of
which the largest number, 380, favored
modification. Prohibition polled 336 of
these votes and repeal 287.
The question was brought up at the
insistence of the National Student
Federation of America, which is con
ducting a national poll of the subject
with a view of attaining a centraliza
tion of American undergraduate opin
ion. It is likely that the Stanford vote,
combined with 250 other colleges and
universities, will be put before Con
gress in the form of a resolution.
Modification of the present laws to
permit light wines and beers received
the largest number of votes of any of
the three proposals on prohibition at
the special A.S.S.U. poll yesterday. A
total of 1189 votes were cast, of which
420 favored the existing situation, 311
repeal, and 458 modification.
Tired of Fusel Oil
"I am tired of fusel oil," stated one
ardent advocate of prohibition as it
doesn't exist today. The expense of
searching out the elusive purveyor of
the cup that cheers enters into the
opinion of another, who wrote: "I
favor repeal because it would avoid
traveling to San Francisco and San
Jose."
Prohibition enforcement was lauded
with the following, "All kick will be
gone if it is not against the law." One
"Reason Why I Vote as I Do," con
signed Mr. Volstead's law to the eternal
fires and loudly clamored for "bigger
and better liquor stores."
By far the majority of the opinions,
however, represented serious thought
on the subject, as evidenced by sug
gestions that the present generation
does not represent time enough to
work out the idea. Many voted for re
tention of the present statutes, and
urged that a stricter enforcement be
applied as remedy for existing evils.
Many came out for the right of the
individual to decide in the matter.
Others argued for local option, some
for government sale of intoxicants in
regulated stores, and others wrote for
repeal on modification on the grounds
that enforcement was too expensive.
Slightly over one-third of the women
students registered an opinion. Of the
180 votes, 84 went for retention of
prohibition, 24 for repeal, and 78 for
modification.
Some of the reasons advanced by
the women for the choice of their
votes are highly humorous. One fair
voter believed that men get what they
want when they want it; so, she con
sidered, it was immensely better to
let them get the stuff fairly and
squarely. Another one thought that
