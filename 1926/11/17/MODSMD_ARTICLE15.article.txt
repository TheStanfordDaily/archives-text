# 1928 WOMEN DEFEAT SENIORS 2 TO 1 IN CLOSE HOCKEY GAME
## 
### 
Junior women forced their way to
a 2 to 1 victory over a short-handed,
desperate senior team in a bitterly
fought practice hockey game yester
day afternoon on Roble field. All the
scoring was done in the first half,
when the 1927 women were playing
up-hill. The second was a gruelling,
heart-breaking defense for the seniors,
and a keenly disappointing series of
fruitless threats for the juniors.
The contest was fairly even in the
first half, although toward the end of
the period the necessity for every
member of the 1027 team playing
more thnn just her own position, told.
The junior scores were made by Caro
lyn Shepard and Dorothy Cone, the
former carrying the ball ahead and
shooting it into a totally unguarded
goal. Astrid Arnoldson, senior fullback,
arrived just too late to intercept the
shot. Miss Cone shot the ball in from
far to the side after the ball had been
carried down the field following a
senior score of the same type by Lois
Hall man.
In the second half the ball went
from one end of the field*to the other,
meeting airtight defense work at both
' nds. Emma Pemond, junior goalguard,
and her teammate, Frances Watson,
did some excellent clearing. Three
senior backs managed to cover their
five positions well enough, with the
.assislance of Marie Manchee, center
forward, to drive back the juniors each
time as they prepared to score. Miss
Manchee nnd Harbara Fonwick, center
half, played n hard game, covering al
most the entire field themselves.
