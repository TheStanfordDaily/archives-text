# SOCCER TEAM WILL PLAY CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## 
### 
Under the direction of Don Me- j
Carty, Jack Franklin, and Captain
Hob Bailard, Stanford's varsity soccer
team is rounding into shape this week
for its second contest with the Uni
versity of California, scheduled to take j
place in the Big Game program at
Berkeley Saturday.
Fighting off a Bear eleven that was .
supposed to have been favored to win,
the Card kickers fought their Bluej
and Gold rivals to a scoreless tie in
their game Armistice Day, and the'
directorate, acting in the absence of
Coach Harry Maloney, is handling the j
squad effectively with an eye to an-!
other good performance this week.
The 1930 outfit, victors over the
Cubs, Saturday, 2 to 1, is taking ad-'
vantage of a three-day rest the earlier !
part of this week, although Howard !
Smith and Manager George Wheaton, j
who are in charge, have billed a prac
tice game for them Thursday after-;
rioon.
Meanwhile, the second varsity is
active in its daily scrimmage with the
first string and is standing by until
resumption of its Peninsula League :
soccer schedule, when it will play off
the uncompleted schedule of the babe
aggregation.
While defense has been the chief
asset of the varsity, coaches have been
drilling upon offensive tactics this
week that are planned to not only hold j
the Bears to a standstill, but also to
force the play for a possible victory, j
