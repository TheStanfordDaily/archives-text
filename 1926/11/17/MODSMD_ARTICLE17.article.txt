# TECHNICAL MASTERY OF ENSEMBLE WORK SHOWN BY QUARTET
## 
### 
Four genuine and accomplished musi- j
cians, one a famous virtuoso and the j
rest capable of fulfilling the most exact- j
ing technical demand's, make up the i
Mischa Elman String Quartet which J
played in the Basketball Pavilion last j
night as the second event of the Stanford '
Concert Series.
The program chosen was perhaps a j
trifle heavy for the audience, with the I
possible exception of the first number, a
Haydn quartet. But anything lighter j
would not have given the group such an j
opportunity to prove its mastery of the
most difficult ensemble work.
Elman has formed a remarkable organ- j
ization. The most serious criticism that i
can be made of the quartet is that Elman j
dominates to a greater extent than is I
desirable for a balanced rendition. His i
tone is brilliant, his technical ability '
almost unequaled, and he has been for
so long a famous soloist, that it is
scarcely to be wondered that at times
the effect was almost that of Elman with
violin, viola, and 'cello accompaniment ;
rather than a chamber music quartet.
The program might have served for :
an illustrated lecture on musical history i
showing the development from the classi- j
cal to the romantic school. Haydn's quar- ;
tet, in the best tradition of the classical
school, was strict in form, objective in '
treatment, and cheerful in effect—simply
music without any meaning attached.
In the Beethoven Opus 72, the classical
restraint was partially thrown off. Es
pecially in the Adagio movement the
power and depth of Beethoven in his
later stages was shown.
In Tschaikovsky's Opus 30, the ro- !
mantic school was represented in a work
typical of the great Russian composer.
Excepting for the necessarily mournful
"Andante funchre et doloroso" there was
little of the melancholia that is supposed '
to be an essential part of Tschaikovsky.
