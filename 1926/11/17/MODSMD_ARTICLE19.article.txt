## Students to Serpentine From Pavilion to Base of Bonfire CASS, CHALMERS IN SKIT Dr. C.H. Marvin, University Of Arizona, President, Will Speak 
### 
The time for the opening of the
Big Game Rally in the pavilion
tonight has been changed from
7:30 to 6:50 o'clock at the request
of Coach Pop Warner in order that
the team may leave earlier for its
place of seclusion. This will make
it necessary for living groups to
arrange to have their evening
meals at 6 o'clock, according to an
announcement made last night by
Cal Conron, chairman of the Rally
Committee.
"Down with the Gold and Blue!"
This time-honored Stanford senti
ment is hourly becoming a settled de
termination on the part of students
and alumni as the time of the Big
Game Rally and the burning of the
freshman bonfire approaches. Sons of
the Stanford Red will turn out en
masse tonight, probably in sufficient
numbers to fill the pavilion to over
flowing, with the double object of giv
ing final encouragement to the varsity
before it goes into seclusion tomorrow
and of celebrating the cremation of
the Golden Bear.
Bob Fraser is expecting a deafening
volley of yells to rock the pavilion to
night when he, A 1 Cass, and Bob
Frazee unlimber their arms to bring
forth the thunder. With the alumni to
join in the yelling and singing of some
of the old favorites, nothing short of
bedlam is expected.
Alumni Admitted Until 7:30
Alumni holding tickets will be ad
mitted to the pavilion through the east
gate until 6:50. Any seats left vacant
then will be turned over to the use
of the general public. Several thou
sand people are expected to crowd
about the bonfire some time before
the rally ends in order to see the
touching off of the stack at 8:20
o'clock.
The Rally Committee last night de
cided to inaugurate a new plan in the
conduct of the serpentining about the
base of the bonfire. Students will fall
into line outside the pavilion doors
following the rally and proceed in the
! wake of the band by way of the
Encina cutoff road to Lasuen street
and then to the site of the bonfire.
Bob Lewis, last year's A.S.S.U. presi
dent, was selected by the committee
to "strike the match" that will start
i the flames that will burn the pyre
| that the frosh built. Lewis will have
I charge of the squad of holdovers who
traditionally guard the big stack while
the rally takes place.
Marvin to Speak
Dr. C. H. Marvin, University of Ari
zona president, will speak as an alum
nus. Dr. Marvin graduated from Stan
ford with the class of 1912. Pop War
ner, Tiny Thornhill, and Captain Fred
Swan will be speakers who will inter
pret the intentions of the varsity re
garding the game. Cal Conron, Rally
Committee chairman,- will introduce
the speakers and entertainers.
Skit by Daves
"Something aesthetically correct"
was the way in which Delmer Daves
described the skit involving Stanford
football triumphs which is to be one
of the features of the entertainment.
A 1 Cass and Hock Chalmers are tc
appear in the act and the stage direc
tions call for curtains, but aside from
that nothing as to the nature of the
act can be discovered.
Other acts include A 1 Cass singing
popular song parodies and the appear
ance of Neil Miller, who will sing to
the accompaniment of his guitar. The
final contribution will be the appear
ance of Daves in "The Inauguration
of 'Boom' Drumm as President of the
j Order of Red and Screaming Eaglet:
I Who Fly by Night," being the second
meeting of the Order.
Starting at 6:20 o'clock in front of
Encina, hall men will follow the band
up Arguello street to the Theta Chi
house, turning there towards the
A.T.O. house and proceeding down the
'row, gathering rooters at each house,

! The women will join the procession at
the postoffice. Request has been made
by the Rally Committee that no stu
dent rooters ride to the pavilion in
automobiles, in order to alleviate the
; parking difficulty about the entrance
i to the pavilion.
