The time for the opening of the
Big Game Rally in the pavilion
tonight has been changed from
7:30 to 6:50 o'clock at the request
of Coach Pop Warner in order that
the team may leave earlier for its
place of seclusion. This will make
it necessary for living groups to
arrange to have their evening
meals at 6 o'clock, according to an
announcement made last night by
Cal Conron, chairman of the Rally
Committee.
"Down with the Gold and Blue!"
This time-honored Stanford senti
ment is hourly becoming a settled de
termination on the part of students
and alumni as the time of the Big
Game Rally and the burning of the
freshman bonfire approaches. Sons of
the Stanford Red will turn out en
masse tonight, probably in sufficient
numbers to fill the pavilion to over
flowing, with the double object of giv
ing final encouragement to the varsity
before it goes into seclusion tomorrow
and of celebrating the cremation of
the Golden Bear.
Bob Fraser is expecting a deafening
volley of yells to rock the pavilion to
night when he, A 1 Cass, and Bob
Frazee unlimber their arms to bring
forth the thunder. With the alumni to
join in the yelling and singing of some
of the old favorites, nothing short of
bedlam is expected.
Alumni Admitted Until 7:30
Alumni holding tickets will be ad
mitted to the pavilion through the east
gate until 6:50. Any seats left vacant
then will be turned over to the use
of the general public. Several thou
sand people are expected to crowd
about the bonfire some time before
the rally ends in order to see the
touching off of the stack at 8:20
o'clock.
The Rally Committee last night de
cided to inaugurate a new plan in the
conduct of the serpentining about the
base of the bonfire. Students will fall
into line outside the pavilion doors
