# A 						Private Battle

We have on the campus today a two dollar assessment on the Stanford
women levied by the Women's Athletic Association at an open meeting,
and we also have a big squabble among the women over this two dollar
tax. Awakened to the fact, one hundred and thirty four have signed a
petition asking for a Quad vote to sanction or repeal the ruling.
There are only five hundred women at Stanford and it seems strange
how they are not able to get along.
To review the facts briefly, it seems as though the "five hundred"
want a lodge built at Lake Searsville and to do this they must raise
nearly $3000. After careful consideration, the W.A.A. Board decided
that by assessing each woman in the University two dollars the burden
of raising the first third of the money would be evenly distributed, and
such a method would be less arduous for all concerned than a series of
drives. This plan was referred to the open meeting of W.A.A. held last
Wednesday at Searsville Lake. Notices of this meeting stating that a
vote on the two dollar assessment was to be taken were in the Stanford
Daily for three days preceding the meeting. The president and vice
president of W.A.A. made announcements to that effect in person in
every sorority and in Roble. Announcements were also made in Physical
Education classes. Transportation to Searsville was provided and more
women were present at the meeting than were at the regular Women's
Assembly.
At the meeting it was voted to assess every member of W.A.A. two
dollars to raise a Lodge fund. Ample opportunity was given women to
object, in fact women who had anything to say against the plan were
begged to do so. As no objection was forthcoming, the matter was sup
posedly settled.
It seems rather strange that the women who are now asking for a Quad
vote did not ask for a ballot vote at the time. Perhaps if they had been
interested enough in the project all of them would have attended the
meeting.
