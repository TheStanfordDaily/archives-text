# The 						Red Army

### 
By the time this issue reaches your doorstep the bonfire may be stand
ing or it may be burned, but it was certainly well guarded. Along with
darkness last night there appeared a great red army of freshmen armed
to the teeth like a true bunch of bolsheviks. Rake-handles, baseball bats,
shovels, picks, and tree trunks were the favorite weapons, and if an early
morning vegetable man sees a gray car loaded with young men streaking
for other campuses it will not be because they have just finished setting
off tlie fire.
