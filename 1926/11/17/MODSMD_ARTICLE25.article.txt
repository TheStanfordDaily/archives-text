# HOUSE MANAGERS TO DRAW UP PLAN FOR CO-OPERATIVE STORE
## 
### 
A committee has been appointed as an
outgrowth of the fraternity house man
agers' meeting in the Old Union, Monday
night, to draw up plans for an organiza
tion of house managers. This organiza
tion would operate a co-operative store
where supplies could he bought at whole
sale cost and form a unified plan by
which house managers could help one
another.
Jud Carry, a prominent member of the
alumni, suggested the orgnization in a
talk to the group and Karl Doerr, presi
dent of the inter-fraternity council, ap
pointed a committee to look into the
matter, which includes the following:
Fred Kunzell, Zeti Xi, chairman ; Arthur
Greisscr, Sigma Nu: Marcus Fret man
Theta Xi; James Habeggcr, Chi Psi, and
Willis Wolfe, Kappa Sigma.
The committee is planning to form
the organization similar to the one now
on the Oregon Agricultural College cam
pus.
The O.A.C. association was started in
1916 for the mutual benefit of the man
agers and they discussed such problems

as collecting board money, routine of
serving meals, methods used in buying.
At first this association did not work
lout so well when the fraternities bought
j their supplies through the warehouse
i from the merchants. In 1920 a full-time
I manager was appointed and the goods
were bought direct from wholesalers.
1 his proved a success and concessions
! such as furniture and hardware, fresh
vegetables, fruit, butter and eggs were
| added.
1 he actual cost of the merchandise to
the members is the wholesale price paid
by the association plus the margin added
for the expense of running the associ
ation. Last year this cost was found to
lie but 9.16 per cent of the total gross
sales.
The association not only supplies gro
l ceries and meat hut renders many other
! services of great value. One dollar to
j51.50 is saved on a cord of wood. Milk
has been contracted for and the very
best pasteurized is obtained with a sav
ing of from 10 to 25 per cent. Dinners
are Riven for the exchange of ideas and
mutual benefits. Menus and recipes are
secured for the help of managers. The
association runs an employment agency
for cooks and other help, and materially
aids its members in securing the best
assistance for their representative organi
zations.
