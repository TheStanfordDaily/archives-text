Die Luft Der Frieheit Weht!
That the campus voted as wet as
a barkeeper's towel is highly grati- 1
fying. Even more so is the reason
advanced by the majority of student
voters for administering the blow di
rect to Mister Volstead's brain child. ;
From the comments appended to the j
ballots cast yesterday, one derives
the information that Stanford men
and women resent the Eighteenth
Amendment chiefly because it entails
an infringements upon personal lib
prty.
We are moved to regret the jest
ing aspersion cast upon student opin
ion in yesterday's column. For this
sort of thing hearkens back to that
admirable love of freedom and inde

1 pendence that characterized Stanford
:of the early days. It recalls some
thing of the spirit that runs through
\ the verse written by Charley Field
I when he and the university were
i young.
Though the road to Menlo is now
no more than a means of getting to a
I small and comparatively uninteresting
town, and though the health of the
Cardinal may not be pledged legiti
mately in anything stronger than
water, this vote augurs the arrival
of a happier day.
Onr may even hope lliat the Wind
of Freedom to which the motto of
Stanford refers will develop into a
1 howling gale and sweep the country,
purging the air of the foul stench
| created by our national hypocrisy.
