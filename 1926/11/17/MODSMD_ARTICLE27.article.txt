The Editor, Sir: ,
Permit me to add a vociferous
"ditto" to "A New Student's" protest
against the solicitation of new stu
dents' parents by the Young Men's
Christian Association of this campus.
During the period of the Great War
the writer was one of the millions
over here who in the aggregate gave
scores of millions to the boys "over '
there" through the "Y." When we
learned that our gifts did not get
through the "Y" to the boys, and that
that organization had shamelessly mis
appropriated our money and were
merchandising instead of giving (sell
ing cigarettes, etc., to boys whose pay
was so irregular that most of the
time they had not the wherewithall
for any purchases) we were disheart
ened and disappointed.
The "Y" tradesmen behind the lines
might well have practiced the genuine
Christian charity displavd by a some
what cruder evangelical organization
whose loyal lassies went into the front
ranks giving corporeal and spiritual
sustenance to the boys.
It was quite un-Christian and un
charitable not to forgive the "Y" even
for the great sin of its failure even
during the critical period of the war;
but so far as the writer is informed
the "Y" has never acknowledged its
sin. —Another New Student.
