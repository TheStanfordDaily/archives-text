The Editor, Sir:
In Friday's issue of your paper and
again today there appeared letters
from new students criticizing the
methods of the Stanford Y.M.C.A. in
obtaining funds from parents of stu
dents. As one who has had something
to do with the raising of funds for
the "Y" during the last year or two,
T wish to claim the courtesy of your
columns to make one or two explana
tions. ■
To hegin with, the organization and
work of the "Y" are such that it must
call on others besides the students ,
themselves for its funds. Like any
other organization engaged in a finan-!
cial campaign, it turns to the group
most naturally interested in the work
it is trying to do, the parents of stu
dents. The University gives us the use
of its files to obtain addresses, but this
is no more than is done for any other
party having a legitimate reason for
wanting such a list. The process thus
far is no more than the obtaining of
a mailing list.
TTere we come to the difference in
method between the Y.M.C.A. and
other organizations similarly placed. I
It, realizes that many of the men here
at Stanford are earning their own
way, and that some of them have in- j
terests elsewhere, and that many par
ents are making the maximum effort
to send their sons to the University. '
Therefore it makes sure, before it ap
plies to the parents, that their sons
have no objection to such an applica
tion.
Finally, may T add just a word as to
the statements that "the 'Y* here picks j
on the new men" and that parents are j
"tricked into sending the money"? The
"Y" last year received from parents 1

iof students donations amounting to
$2795, of which $720 came from par- 1
ents of new students. When we re- j
member that over one-third of the ,
students at the University are new j
students, this is not a high propor
tion. No further appeal is made to j
parents than is made to other friends ■
of the association, but the work and j
1 aims of the association are presented
simply and frankly. The fact that par- j
ents have sons here at Stanford is j
used only for purposes of introduc- j
tion. And the reason that only new j
students received the letter to which
your correspondents object is the
\ simplest possible one —that other stu
dents have received it already, when
j they were new students.
Faithfully yours,
John C. Duniway.

The Editor, Sir:
In Friday's issue of your paper and
again today there appeared letters
from new students criticizing the
methods of the Stanford Y.M.C.A. in
obtaining funds from parents of stu
dents. As one who has had something
to do with the raising of funds for
the "Y" during the last year or two,
T wish to claim the courtesy of your
columns to make one or two explana
tions. ■
To hegin with, the organization and
work of the "Y" are such that it must
call on others besides the students ,
themselves for its funds. Like any
other organization engaged in a finan-!
cial campaign, it turns to the group
most naturally interested in the work
it is trying to do, the parents of stu
dents. The University gives us the use
of its files to obtain addresses, but this
is no more than is done for any other
party having a legitimate reason for
wanting such a list. The process thus
far is no more than the obtaining of
a mailing list.
