# EYE MOVEMENTS FOR READING CHINESE STUDIED DR. WALTER MILES WRITES ARTICLE ON SUBJECT CHARACTER ARRANGEMENT HAS LITTLE EFFECT
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that Chinese is j
a two-dimensional language and is ar- j
ranged in the vertical axis, the eye I
movements in reading it are essential- i
ly the same as for reading horizontal
languages, according to an article by
Dr. Walter R. Miles of the Psychology
department appearing in the Novem- !
her issue of "The Scientific Ameri
can."
It has long been known,. Dr. Miles
states, that in horizontal languages
the passage of the eyes along a line
of print is not a continuous move
ment, and that the pauses of the eyes,
which are of much greater duration
than the movement phases, constitute
the real times of seeing. Chinese, how
ever, is radically different from these 1
languages, being arranged in the ver- i
tical axis. Miles says of it: "Its two j
characters are all essentially perfect
squares so that it may be termed a '
two-dimensional language. Of these
the simplest form is a horizontal line, j
while other characters look like com- I
plicated windows of lattice-work and |
each character may contain more
than thirty strokes. It is quite natural
to ask whether Chinese is read with
the same sort of eye movements as
are used for English, whether the eye
stops on each character or perhaps
wanders about within complicated
ones."
Dr. Miles recently obtained the an
swer to this question. Two pages of
Chinese characters containing exactly
the same reading material wore pre- â€¢
pared, one being printed in the verti
cal (this would be read by starting at
the upper right-hand corner), the other
being printed horizontally as English ,
ts. Eleven Chinese students rpad the
selections, and the phtographod trac
ings of their eye movements were
studied.
The most successful method of re
cording eye movements, and that em
ployed by Dr. Miles here at. Stanford
In his study of Chinese, was devised
by a Wesleyan professor. The eye is '
illuminated with an arc lamp placed
at some distance from it.and this
bright light reflected in the eye shifts j
position with each eye movement, be- |
cause the cornea has a different curva-1
ture from the eyeball and protrudes
slightly. As the subject reads, bis eye
Is photographed on a continuously !
moving film which records a series of
white tracings representing the move-1
ments of the eye on each line.
Dr. Miles' experiments revealed the
fact that the average reading pauses
for both vertical and horizontal ma

I terial were practically the same. In
j the vertical selections, however, 2.3
! words per pause of the eye were aver
aged as compared with 1.9 words in
horizontal readi-ng. Though the former
text showed slightly longer reading
pauses, each pause covered a greater
number of words. In this connection,
Miles says: "Possibly this co-ordina
tion of moving the eyes along a ver
| tical line, when they are focused at
the proper distance, is the simpler
and, in the long run, less tiring."
In spite of this difference, however,
the process of reading Chinese is fun
! damentally the same as for reading
j Flnglish, according to Miles, who con
tinues: "Each line of print, whether
I in the vertical or horizontal, is cov
ered by a series of quick movements
and much longer pauses. At each
pause more than one character usually
i is read. While Chinese is a condensed
! and two-dimensional language, still the
eye moves in essentially a straight
i line and does not wander about, even
| in complex characters."
