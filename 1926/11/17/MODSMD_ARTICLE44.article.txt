great a difference in strength or rat
ing the two teams are given before
the contest, this had nothing to do
with the kind of game played. The
underdog is always a threat, and is
ready to the dope. Two vrnre
ago, California entered the Big Game
with a decided advantage due to rela
tive scores taken from the conference
games, but Stanford came through in
the last quarter to tie the game, 20
to 20.
Loss Would Be Disastrous
Stanford can not take a chance to
throw away the game Saturday, for a
loss at the time would shove the Red
shirts down to fifth place in the rat
ings.
Last Saturday California broke her
losing jinx by beating Nevada 20 to 6,
a team which Stanford had taken
down the line in a previous contest, 33
to 9, and while these relative scores
give the Redshirts somewhat of an
edge, the rapid strides taken by the
Bears to betterment would place them
in a position to be exceedingly danger
ous for the Saturday's game.
The squad members were guests of
the New Stanford Theatre last night.,
and tonight, immediately following the
rally, will depart for Mount Diablo
Country Club, where they will hold
short workouts until the last minute
when they will travel to Berkeley in
time for the game.
The squad is in the best of condi
tion with the exception of Spud Lewis
and Don Hill, both of whom Wallace
Denny, trainer, says will be ready to
play Saturday.
