# U.C., MILLS, STANFORD WOMEN CONVENE TO PLAN 1927 CONTESTS
## 
### 
As a result of the triangle women's
! sports day held on November 6 be
j tween Stanford, the University of
'California, and Mills College, a con
ference was held Monday night in San
Francisco to further plans lor similar
sports meetings. A member of the
physical education department, the
president of W.A.A., and the chairman
of the sports day from each univer
sity were present.
This year's sports day was consid
ered successful. However, it was de
cided that women who wished to par
ticipate in the future should sign up
for their sports ahead of time in order
that everyone may take part in the
event in which she is best qualified.
More major sports are planned for,
as only swimming, hockey, and tennis
were represented on the last full day.
To this list basketball and archery
will be added. This will call for an
elimination of the minor snorts and

! games.
Instead of playing off the events
singly, a number of events will be run
off together, which will enable every
body to be in action all the time. It is
anticipated that the next sports day
will be held on the Stanford campus.
Mrs. Ruth Calvin, director of Roble
Gymnasium, Marie Manchee, president
of W.A.A., and Margaret Owen, chair
| man of the sports day, represented
i Stanford at the conference.
