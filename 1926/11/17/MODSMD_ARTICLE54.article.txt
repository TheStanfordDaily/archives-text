# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The late Woodrow Wilson was com
mander-in-chief of the Army and Navy
of the U.S.A. Harry Wilson is not the
commander of the Army football team,
but he is one of the brightest back
field stars, and if he succeeds in
smearing the Navy goat in the forth
coming Army-Navy game ten days
from today, he will easily be more
popular in his branch of the service
than any commander-in-chief who ever
lived.
This year Harry seems to have
again reached the form that brought
him All-American honors in 1923. His
dazzling runs and general all-around
play has reminded those who knew
him when he was in college of the
way he tore up and down the gridiron
for Penn State under Hugo Bezdek's
watchful eye.
Harry Wilson will have to go some
in the Army-Navy game to duplicate
his performance of 1923 for the Nit
tany Lions. For one thing, Harry
scored every touchdown that Penn
State made in six games. For some
colleges that wouldn't mean a thing,
but for Penn State in 1923, it was
saying a lot.
In the Navy game, Wilson inter-

! cepted a pass and ran 55 yards to the
goal line. Not content with that, he
received the kick-off a minute later
and ran 95 yards to a touchdown. A
mere 80-yard run for a third score
completed his day's work in that
game. (The Army will probably be
satisfied if he gains half as much on
the 27th.) On the following Saturday,
Harry made two touchdowns against
We'st Virginia, and three weeks later
scored three times on Pennsylvania
with runs of 24, 48, and 45 yards.
A modest chap, is this tow-lieaded
Mercury of the gridiron, as game as
they make 'em, and with a head chuck
full of football sense. Besides being a
first-class ball-carrier, Wilson is sure
death on place kicks. He booted three
over for points after touchdowns in
j the Yale-Army game last month. But
can the Navy stop Harry Wilson?
That is one of the questions to be
{ decided later.
