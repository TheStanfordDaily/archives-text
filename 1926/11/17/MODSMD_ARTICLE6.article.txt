# WOMEN DISAGREE ON VALIDITY OF W.A A. LODGE ASSESSMENT
## 134 Have Signed Petition To Vote Upon Measure At Quad Election 
### 
Despite the fact that W.A.A. has j
passed a resolution to assess every
Stanford woman $2 for building the |
new lodge at Searsville lake, 134 wo- 1
ment have already signed a petition,
which is now being circulated, to vote
upon the validity of the assessment
at a Quad election.
The petition reads as follows:
"We, the undersigned, believe that
the question of assessing the Stanford i
women for a Stanford Women's Lodge
should be voted upon at a Quad elec-1
tion."
Grace Adams, who is circulating the 1
petition, declares that the apparent j
dissatisfaction of the women from
whom she was attempting to collect
the assessment led her to initiate the
petition. The sentiment of the women j
is behind W.A.A. but they are not in !
favor of the way in which the assess-;
ment was levied. That a question as
serious as the expenditure of $1000 or
more by the Stanford women deserves j
special consideration, and should have
the formality of a Quad election, is
the sentiment of most of the women
with whom I have talked," stated Miss
Adams. "They are in favor of the
lodge, but do not approve of the
method of levying the assessment."
On the other hand, Marie Manchee,
President of W.A.A., considers that
the assessment is valid because it was
levied by a practically unanimous vote
of the members present at the special
meeting held at Searsville lake last
week for the purpose of determining
the method of raising funds for the
lodge. She believes that W.A.A. would
be willing to have a Quad election on
the matter, but thinks that the senti
ment of the majority was expressed at
the meeting where the resolution was
passed levying the assessment.
