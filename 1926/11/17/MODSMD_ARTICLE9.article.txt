# GLEE CLUB QUARTET INCLUDED ON PROGRAM OF FOOTBALL GAIETIES
## Dance Skits, One-Act Plays, Vocal and Orchestral Numbers in Show 
### 
Variety, the key-word of the an
nual Football Show, Friday night's
production in connection with Stan
ford-California game festivities, is in
deed offered in the form of dancing
skits, one-act plays, both original and
adopted from Broadway revues, nov
elty acts, orchestral numbers, and
vocal selections forming the "Gaie
ties" program.
To this end the special quartet from
the Stanford Glee Club will entertain
in an act spectacular in costume and
atmosphere. Under the direction of
C. E. Kulman, manager, the four have
worked up an act similar to the "Rus
sian Interlude" included in last year's
"Gaieties" program, with a gypsy solo
dance by Frances Boone as one of
the features of the act.
Campbell Prepares Act
Allan Campbell, who has appeared
in pianologues and similar numbers in
several past Stanford musical shows,
will offer with Jean Wakefield a dou
ble piano duet.
A 1 Cass and Peggy Randall, with
the aid of the former's ukulele, take
full advantage of their talent in a
comic line to burlesque previous num
bers of the "Gaieties" program. Miss
Randall, remembered for her parts
in "Dulcy," "Ride a Cock-Horse" and
other productions, and Ca3S have
teamed together well in their before
curtain act, and should offer a most
successful number.
"Americana," with modern jazz em
phasized to its highest degree, in
cludes orchestral selections by the
Brooks-Worthington fourteen-piece
orchestra, dancing by Byron, and vo
cal numbers by Kathleen Fitz. Nov
elty dancing by Hal Boone, Van King,
and Frances Boone, two one-act plays
written by Dave Lampson, and a pair
lof sketches taken from the "Music
i Box Revue," complete the "Gaieties"
! program.

! ticing for the past two weeks under

: son, Elizabeth Grebs, Frances San
ford, Margaret Waite, Fay Hamilton,
Kahlerine Kamm, Alice May Edwards,
