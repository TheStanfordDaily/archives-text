# STANFORD. CALIFORNIA SQUADS LEAVE TO REST BEFORE GAME
## Coach Warner Tells Public Not to Overestimate Cards' Strength "POP" FIGHTS COCKINESS Injuries Are Few; Squads Will Be Almost Intact For Big Fracas 
### 
Following the rally and send-off
given the team last night, Coach Pop
Warner and the players left for the
Mt,. Diablo Country Club where they
will stay in seclusion until a few hours
before the game Saturday. Complete
Test and relaxation for the team is
the object of the seclusion, which is
an annual event.
Warner Warns Against Overconfidence
The California team also left for
seclusion last night, going to the
Castlewood Golf and Country Club.
While confidence of victory pervades
the Stanford campus, there is, accord
ing to Coach Warner, danger of over
confidence spelling defeat. California,
with nothing to lose and everything to
gain, will throw caution to the winds
and take every chance. The Pears
have been pointed to this game all
year, and the steady improvement of
recent weeks, may climax itself Sat
urday. If it does, and California gets
the breaks, all may not go so well
for the Cardinals.
Both Teams in Shape
Both teams will enter the game in
good shape. Perrin, who has been out
for five weeks, will not, however, start
for California. But Hill is fast recover
ing from the injury to his leg sus
tained last week, and will be in shape
to play for Stanford Saturday.
Too Much Expectedâ€”Warner
While newspapers and students have
been getting more confident of a vic
tory for Stanford each day, Pop War
ner fears that the assurance is too
great. He says, "Stanford students,
alumni, and supporters are expecting
too mu%h from the Stanford team next
Saturday. They overestimate Stan
ford's strength and I am sure they
very much underestimate the strength
of California. The latter team will be
at its best, keyed up to a very high
pitch of fighting spirit and realizing
that their defeats of the past will all
be forgotten if the team can defeat
its traditional rival."
He further said: "It must be remem
bered that the Bears have a large
proportion of their last year's team
and physically they are just as power
ful as the Stanford boys. The Stanford
team is not as good a team as that of
last year, and have had a tough time
winning from some rather weak
teams. The Redshirts played good
football in the last quarter against
Washington and that kind of football
should be good enough to beat Cali
fornia, but it is a big question whether
or not the team will duplicate that
performance. The team has been so
erratic that it is hard to figure what
may happen. Only Stanford's best ef
forts will be good enough to beat an
inspired California team on Satur
day."
The trip to the Mt. Diable Country
Club took about two hours, and 36
men made the juumay. Fallowing nre
the ones who accompanied Warner
and two assistants: Fred Swan (capt.).
