# GAIETIES SCORE IS PRAISED BY NOTED LEADER
## Songs in "Americana" Act of Vaudeville Impresses Jazz Exponent PIANOLOGUES INCLUDED Gordon Hall Is in Charge Of All Music for Pre-Game Show 
### 
Recognition by Paul Whiteman, con
sidered the foremost exponent of mod
ern dance music, of the worth of sev
eral musical numbers included in the
"Football Gaieties" program is fitting
tribute to the high standard attained
in this line for Friday evening's per
formance.
Whiteman has recently heard sev-!
eral numbers written by Jean Wake-

field which are in- '
eluded in the!
"Americana" act, j
and has not only (
been enthusiastic!
in praise, but of- j
fered to aid in pub- j
lishing the songs. J
"Mama's Goingi
Bye-Bye," the most j
striking piece of j
the act, the lyric
and music of which
is written by Miss
Wakefield, will be
sung by Kathleen
Fitz.
All the songs of'
the "Americana"!

act, formed by Gregory Williamson and
Gordon Hall, have been composed by
Miss Wakefield, who has also written
the music for the "Football Song," the
theme song of the "Gaieties." "Ameri
cana" is heralded as the last word in
jazz, combining dancing numbers by
Byron Harvey, selections by the
Brooks-Worthington orchestra, and
vocal solos by Kathleen Fitz.
"Evening Brings Me You," a melo


Jean Wakefield
die waltz duet, will be sung by Neil
Miller and Julia North. The waltz,
composed by Jack Ross, with lyric
written by Gregory Williamson, is of
the type of Kenneth Hess's "Girl of
My Dreams" which proved so suc
cessful when sung by Marjorie Allen
and Phil Urner last year in the
"Gaieties of 1925." Although Miller is
well remembered for his singing in
Glee Club shows, rallies, and many
other appearances, Miss North will
make her debut as a vocal favorite.
Hall Directs Music â€¢
Gordon Hall, .musical director of the
"Gaieties," has prepared a score of
distinct merit for the performance,
including several of the pieces by Miss
Wakefield in addition to the overture.
Pianologues by Allan Campbell and
Miss Wakefield, dancing by the Boone-
King-Boone trio, selections by the
double quartet of the Stanford Glee
Club, and novelty songs by the A 1
Cass-Peggy Randall pair complete the
musical numbers, while body is given
the program by four one-act plays,
two selected from the "Music Box
Revue" and two written by Dave Lam
son, former editor of Chaparral.
