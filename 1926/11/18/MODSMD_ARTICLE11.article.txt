# DR. JORDAN TO SPEAK ON SEARCH FOR GOD
## 
### 
Man has been searching for God
ever since Zophar, a friend of Job,
asked him the famous question, "Canst
thou by searching find out God?" Dr.
Jordan in his Thursday Evening Lec
ture tonight at his home at 7:30
o'clock will take up the various ways
that people in the past have gone
about- their quest for God.
The subject of Dr. Jordan's talk will
be: "Canst Thou by Searching?" Prom
a historical point of view, he will dis
cuss the efforts of man in different
stages of development to find the
Eternal Eather. Man is still searching
for God, and Dr. Jordan will bring his
lecture from the past right up to the
present in tracing man's efforts to
find God.
