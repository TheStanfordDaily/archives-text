## 
### 
A locked door, from which is
sued ponderous snores emitted
from the lair of the "Old Boy,"
seemed to prohibit further ad
vances by the reporter from the
"Stanford Daily," who had heard
a rumor of a "Big Game Edition"
of Chaparral. Journalistic enter
prise, however, could not he de
nied, and soon the "Old Boy,"
rudely awakened, spoke:
"NOW THAT well-known col
litch comic, THE CHAPARRAL,
offers Friday a Big Game Num
ber, which I, the Ancient Gaffer,
promise will tickle the ribs of
both the Props and The Campi.
The cover Is by Darwin Tillia,
late of the staff of "Sans Gene"
in Paris, and now imbibing knowl
edge at the fount of a Leland
Stanford Junior University, of
which you may have heard."
"There are just three things no
one can afford to miss," he
droned. "They are the Big Game,
the Ram's Head Football Show,
and the Big Game Number of
Chappie."
The snores were resumed. The
reporter had completed his mis
sion.
