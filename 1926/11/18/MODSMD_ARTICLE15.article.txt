Enough remains of ancient Pisidian
Antoicli were excavated during the ex
cavations carried on two years ago by
the University of Michigan to rebuild
complete parts of monuments and
buildings, according to Dr. David
Moore Robinson of Johns Hopkins who
spoke on "Excavations at Pisidian
Antioch" in the Little Theatre last

Robinson, who was head of the ex
pedition working at Antioch, says that
were the Turks willing, structures
might be made complete by putting
together blocks of pillars, friezes, and
sculpture work.
Excavators Trace Walls
Excavators were able 4o trace the
walls about the ancient city and to
find the square of Tiberius and the
Square of Augustus. A great Christian
cathedral, the oldest, ever discovered
was brought to light by the Michigan
expedition.
In recalling an incident nearing a
riot, Robinson told of having to halt
his excavations when the Turkish
mayor declared that work conld not
proceed unless a Turkish overseer was

secured. Although an overseer was on
his way to the site, Dr. Robinson was
not allowed to continue with his work.
Later word was received from Turkish
headquarters to the effect that the ex
cavating might be continued if the
professor of the Turkish kindergarten
department acted as overseer.
