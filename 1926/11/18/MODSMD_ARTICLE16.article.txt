"Alumni have asked me if I intend to |
hold the boys in or let them score at
will. I certainly won't hold them back,
tor 1 think it will require Stanford's
very best to win."
In such words, Coach Pop Warner an
swered at the Big Game rally last night
all the rash speculation as to the score
of the Big Game which has run rife
wherever Cardinal supporters have gath
ered since Stanford beat Washington.
California No Cinch
"I have a wholesome respect for Cali
fornia,' 'he said, "because in my experi-1
ence the underdog of two such rivals i
as Stanford and California has in the'
majority of cases, I think, come out of
the crisis victorious."
Such yelling as is seldom outdone even
at the Big Game greeted the varsity and
coaches when they filed into the pavilion :
last night at the rally, the occasion mark- ■
ing their final appearance before the !
student body until Saturday afternoon, j
The pavilion resembled the stadium itself j
in that it presented a solid mass of howl- \
ing, whistling rooters, rabid in their j
confidence Big Game victory and [
conference championship.
Pop Warner and Captain Fred Swan
were the only ones to say them nay.
Bear of a Game Due
"We stampeded a herd of straggling
cows; we tamed a half-fed, starving cur
from the big sticks up north; but we
thoroughly realize that next Saturday
we're going up against a rough old,
tough old bear," Captain Fred Swan said
calmly in speaking for the varsity.
"California has been coming right
along," he added, "and the Bears have
yet to play their best game. We know ]
they will play by all odds their best of
the season against us, but we are going
to fight to bring home the victory,!'
Daves Entertains
The entertainment arranged by Delmer
Daves' committee was received with great
enthusiasm. A 1 Cass contributed two
ukulelelogues, following which the dra
matic story of "The Shooting of Dan
McGrew" was given in tableau. Daves
himself re-enacted the historic Glee Club I
Novelties act, a second meeting of the I
Order of the Red and Screaming Fagles j
Who Fly by Night. As "Boom" Drumm !
making an inaugural speech following J
election to the presidency of the order, j
Daves scored a great hit and added an- j
other humorous success to his string.
Marvin Speaks
Dr. C. H. Marvin, Stanford 1913, pres
ident of the University of Arizona, rep-'
resented the alumni at the rally and spoke
to encourage the team.
"The alumni," he said, "hope for a
sizable score, which always looks well in
cardinal numbers."
The rally was arranged by Jim Adams, •
with Cal Conron introducing the speak-:
ers. The parade preceding the rall.v was j
directed by John C. Duniway. Practi- j
cally the entire student body followed the j
band into the pavilion after taking part J
in the procession and serpentine down the j
Row.
