# RALLY REPORTS CHOOSE CARDS AS VICTORS IN BRUIN CONTEST
## Rooters' Hearts Warmed by Flames from Huge 1930 Bonfire QUEENERS DECRY ROUGHS Pop Warner and Fred Swan Only Pessimists in Throng at Pavilion 
### Frank Baker 
According to reports from the bonfire
and bull sessions held last night, it is
understood that Stanford is going to win
the Big Game, trounce, wallop, engulf,
overwhelm, and completely smother the
Bears. In other words, they say it is
going to be a "Royal Bear Hug." Up to
press hour this morning no news could
be obtained as to what was going to be
done with the bacon.
Warner, Swan Only Wet Blankets
The only words dampening the ardor
| of the "royal eagles" who screamed last
! night were those of Pop Warner and
Fred Swan, who, being connected with
the Stanford varsity football team, claim
to know their stuff. They both drew long
faces and breaths and announced that
! Stanford rooters must not expect too
much Saturday, and that no more than
I two touchdowns apiece from the Card
; players could be counted on. "Oh, aren't
j they cards!" exclaimed a little girl on
! the sideline.
Roughs Annoy Queeners
Queeners last night said that they had
i not seen such a rough crowd at a rally
since they were roughs themselves.
Cowboys would have been the more
appropriate symbolic name for the swarm
that assailed the Pavilion attempting to
crash the gates, though it is understood
there was more than one redskin among
them panting and biting the dust in front
of the doors. And from the attempts
that were made to scalp several innocent
maids who were waiting to get in, "In
dians" might not be such an inappropri
ate name.
Once inside the hall, the crowd immedi
ately all became "Pop"-eyed, searching
for Mr. Warner and his cohorts, not to
mention the pink silk hose sitting on the
sidelines. Then, upon the scene came
Hob Fraser, brandishing his megaphone,
and asking the lusty lungers to seat them
selves. A domino-like motion ensued,
what with one line falling back on to
the other, on to the other, on to the other,
etc. During the progress of the frequent
yells and ovations, this motion was much
repeated, both backward and forward.
"Well, I Swan," quoth one shrill voice,
and the crowd craned its concerted neck
to see a group of dangerous looking indi
viduals file on to the stage led by the
Cardinal captain. Looking very much like
caged lions in that pavi-lion, with the
onlookers at the zoo huzzaing and hur
rahing, on they marched. Ah yes, and
there was Dick, the lion-hearted, and
Mike and Mac and Ted and Biff, all
ready for a Saturday afternoon of "good,
clean fun."
After the crowd filed in an orderly
parade of several hundred lines ove rto
the bonfire, the big blaze was at last
started, the blaze for which the freshmen
had given their life blood that Stanford
might maintain its motto, "When better
bonfires are built Stanford will build
them."
According to reports from the bonfire
and bull sessions held last night, it is
understood that Stanford is going to win
the Big Game, trounce, wallop, engulf,
overwhelm, and completely smother the
Bears. In other words, they say it is
going to be a "Royal Bear Hug." Up to
press hour this morning no news could
be obtained as to what was going to be

going to be a "Royal Bear Hug." Up to
press hour this morning no news could
be obtained as to what was going to be
done with the bacon.
Warner, Swan Only Wet Blankets
The only words dampening the ardor
| of the "royal eagles" who screamed last
! night were those of Pop Warner and
Fred Swan, who, being connected with
the Stanford varsity football team, claim
to know their stuff. They both drew long
faces and breaths and announced that
! Stanford rooters must not expect too
much Saturday, and that no more than
I two touchdowns apiece from the Card
; players could be counted on. "Oh, aren't
j they cards!" exclaimed a little girl on
! the sideline.
Roughs Annoy Queeners
Queeners last night said that they had
i not seen such a rough crowd at a rally
since they were roughs themselves.
Cowboys would have been the more
appropriate symbolic name for the swarm
that assailed the Pavilion attempting to
crash the gates, though it is understood
there was more than one redskin among
them panting and biting the dust in front
of the doors. And from the attempts
that were made to scalp several innocent
maids who were waiting to get in, "In
dians" might not be such an inappropri
ate name.
Once inside the hall, the crowd immedi
ately all became "Pop"-eyed, searching
for Mr. Warner and his cohorts, not to
mention the pink silk hose sitting on the
sidelines. Then, upon the scene came
Hob Fraser, brandishing his megaphone,
and asking the lusty lungers to seat them
selves. A domino-like motion ensued,
what with one line falling back on to
the other, on to the other, on to the other,
etc. During the progress of the frequent
yells and ovations, this motion was much
repeated, both backward and forward.
"Well, I Swan," quoth one shrill voice,
and the crowd craned its concerted neck
to see a group of dangerous looking indi
viduals file on to the stage led by the
Cardinal captain. Looking very much like
caged lions in that pavi-lion, with the
onlookers at the zoo huzzaing and hur
rahing, on they marched. Ah yes, and
there was Dick, the lion-hearted, and
Mike and Mac and Ted and Biff, all
ready for a Saturday afternoon of "good,
clean fun."
After the crowd filed in an orderly
parade of several hundred lines ove rto
the bonfire, the big blaze was at last
started, the blaze for which the freshmen
had given their life blood that Stanford
might maintain its motto, "When better
bonfires are built Stanford will build
them."
According to reports from the bonfire
and bull sessions held last night, it is
understood that Stanford is going to win
the Big Game, trounce, wallop, engulf,
overwhelm, and completely smother the
Bears. In other words, they say it is
going to be a "Royal Bear Hug." Up to
press hour this morning no news could
be obtained as to what was going to be
done with the bacon.
