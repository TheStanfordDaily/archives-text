Well, we had a plenty good bonfire. It was not as high as many
iri the past have been, but it was one that lit the whole campus—with
enthusiasm and with the spirit that the Cardinals were going to vanquish
the Californians without a doubt.
In fact, everyone celebrated the occasion—twenty-five thousand saw
the bonfire set off—Stanford students, alumni, and other well-wishers.
For the first time in years the first torch was not applied until everyone
was on the grounds. This is a thing that brings credit to the hold-overs
who guarded the fire. *
It was a successful venture and the campus was turned red—a fore
cast for Saturday. A red day is assured.
