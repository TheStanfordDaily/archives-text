Those who saw the three feet of flame licking venomously in the
interior of the bonfire at four o'clock yesterday afternoon had visions
of a premature rally and smouldering heap of ashes for official celebration
later in the evening. But this year the freshmen were not caught
napping—a fire hose and a little headwork saved the situation. Then
again the fire department came to the scene.
It is very unlikely that a Stanford student would be a participant in
a plot to spoil the party, and it is also unlikely if not impossible that the
phosphorus reached the top of the pile by accident. On the other hand
110 single person or group can be justly accused.
Just prior to the Big Game every year it seems the fashionable and
popular thing to burn a bonfire prematurely or discolor a large concrete
letter. Immediately the newspapers fly to the conclusion that Stanford
or California students have invaded their rivals' campus and outfoxed
them.
But after a while these accusations become monotonous and tiresome.
There are many other groups to blame but newspapers will persist.
