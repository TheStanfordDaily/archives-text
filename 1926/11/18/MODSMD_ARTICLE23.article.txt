Argument over the recent decision of some hundred and thirty
members of the W.A.A. to build a lodge for Stanford women at Sears
ville lias come about on the part of those opposing the plan and opposing
the tactics involved. The fact that a two-dollar assessment on all the
members of the organization was the result of the meeting seems to have
given point to those who are now arguing over the affirmative decision.
The opening meeting at Searsville was advertised, promulgated, an
nounced, and practically public word was passed around about the
gathering at which the question was to be decided. In fact, it received
more publicity than an ordinary W.A.A. assembly or Quad vote for
such a matter would have obtained. Automobiles were provided by
which the trip was made, gymnasium classes were excused, and every
effort was made to make it easy for the women to attend the meeting.
In view of these facts it hardly seems possible that an argument over
tlio ethics of the move to hold the meeting at Searsville can be made.
The vote at that meeting may be said to be as truly representative of
the will of the majority as would a vote at an assembly or Quad election.
Stanford wants such a lodge for its women and it is too bad that
those now arguing did not raise their objections earlier so that a more
perfect unity in backing the project might have been obtained.
