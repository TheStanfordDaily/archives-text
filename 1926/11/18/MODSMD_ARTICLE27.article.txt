The Editor, Sir:
The chief success of the usual Cam
pus Opinion seems to be that its real
meaning is hidden in a mass of verb
iage. Wlioinell wants to read a thesis
to find a single, lonesome, weakly- |
expressed idea? â€”A Seeker.
The Editor, Sir:
Hear ye! Hear ye! This is the voice ,
of many speaking. And it speaks to j
Group X for securing an orchestra that
defied the laws of rhythm. It brought'
musical chaos.
Yes, the music played at Toyon on
Friday night was bad, but that played
at Branner on Saturday was cumula
tively worse.
For the notes that filed their way
out of the saxophone, the piano, the
banjo, and several other discord-pro
ducing instruments did their best to
stay away from each other. They were
filled with a negative spirit. With this
pedal result: that the dancers hardly
knew enough to make both feet run
the same way.
Once again, Hear ye! What shall be
done? Ye truly know we stamp our
feet and say we paid two dollars to
chat with some fine girls, but when
we dance without rhythm, the whole
of one's personality is thrown askew.

Yes, a dance without rhythm is com
parable to a meal without food. And
so Group X please take note. For as a
famous statesman said it is not all the
time that many of us can be fooled
some of the time.
(Signed): The Campus Crier.
jThe Editor, Sir:
For some time the practice has pre
vailed of stretching big signs across
i Lasuen Street at the Postoffice adver
i Using various coming events. I ven
! ture to suggest that this practice
should be discontinued. Some days
ago my daughter drove down Lasuen
Street and turned at the Postoffice
corner in order to proceed along Santa
Teresa Street. As she turned the cor
ner a man who came along Santa
j Teresa Street ran into the rear fender
I of her car. The man admitted it was
J his fault, and by way of excuse, stated
I that he was looking at the illuminated
sign across Lasuen Street. Fortunately
; no one was hurt and no great damage
! resulted to either car. The area around
I the postoffice is congested and both
j drivers and pedestrians should be on
I the look-out, instead of gazing at glar
j ing signs. ~
Very sincerely yours,
Sidney D. Townley.
