"The Woman Soul," by Gino Lombroso
Gina Lombroso, the daughter of the
great Lombroso and wife of the fam
ous historian, Ferrero, has written a
voluminous book on the problems of
the woman soul. The theme is inter
esting and has involved constant ex
citement; the book has become more
interesting because of the personality
of the author.
The book is a double reflection: we
see the woman soul reflected in a
splendid woman's soul. With unparal
leled self-study and objectivity, Gina
Lombroso places before us the wo
man's spiritual world, every secret
phase of which she knows so well.
Her basic theme is: woman loves and
wishes for love. Love stimulates her
and refines her; on the other hand,
without love she fades away and de
grades herself. She does regard suc
cess, fame, and wealth as life-ambi
tion, and these only then become valu
able for her if she gains love and
gratitude by them. A woman can only
be made happy through family life,
where she can express her love to
wards those who depend upon her,
and where her love can find love and
gratitude in return.
This is all contained in the book by
Gina Lombroso, who, herself a well
known scientist, has several doctor's
degrees. She was her father's pupil
and assistant; she confesses publicly
that her knowledge and scientific sue

cess are far from having filled her
life and having brought happiness to
her. She declares war on woman
emancipation which makes woman un
happy and drives her to her loss, be
cause it distracts woman from her
mission.
Gina Lombroso's book is a valuable
and serious piece of work. Today, in
the age of the male woman, this book
performs a real mission. It reminds:
don't go further, because we lose our
values! Back to the family hearth,
where the sacred mission waits for
us, or the eternal fire will go out with
out us!
â€”Edgar H. Yolland.
