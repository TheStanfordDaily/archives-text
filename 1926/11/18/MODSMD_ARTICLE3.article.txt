# STANFORD, IF PICKED FOR NEW YEAR'S GAME, WILL CHOOSE RIVAL
## Reports of Alabama Choice Are Probably Untrue Says A1 Masters 
### 
Still adhering to his statement of
the past two days, General Manager
A 1 Masters continues to assert that
Stanford has received no invitation
from Tournament authorities to repre
sent the West in the New Year's game
at Pasadena.
Western Team Is Chosen
Since the western team is allowed
the privilege of extending the invita
tion to an eastern representative, the
report that Alabama has been asked
to play again is probably unfounded,
according to the manager's office.
The machinery used by the Tourna
ment in deciding on the teams which
will participate in the annual intersec
tional contest is to decide by invita
tion the western team, and then allow
that team the courtesy of inviting the
eastern opponent. The western team
chosen is usually sought among the
conference leaders.
Alabama Again Strong
Washington, who annexed confer
ence honors last year, was nosed out
20 to 19 by a strong Alabama team.
This year, Alabama has gone through
an undefeated season, with six out of
seven of her victories against South
ern Conference teams.
Stanford rules as favorite among
newspaper and college men for the
western choice, because of an unde
feated season so far. Even if the
Cardinal is asked, the invitation must
be passed upon by the Board of Ath
letic Control and the Faculty Athletic
Committee, stated Masters.
Stanford will insist upon sending
out her own invitation to an eastern
team, if the Pasadena people decide
to ask the Cardinal to represent the
West, is the opinion of the manager's
office.
