# WOMEN FAVOR QUAD VOTE TO DETERMINE TAX LEVY ASSESSMENT
## Petition Circulated Opposes Previous Legislation for W.A.A. Lodge 
### 
Sentiment in favor of the petition
which is being circulated among the
Stanford women to force a Quad elec
tion on the validity of the $2 assess
ment for the Stanford women's lodge
is rapidly spreading over the campus,
as indicated by the great increase in
the number of signatures obtained
yesterday.
Those in favor of a Quad election
are by far in the majority if the names
on the petition are a true index of the
sentiment. It now seems that a num
ber of those who favored the assess
ment in the vote by hands held at the
W.A.A. meeting last week have re
versed their opinion and are now in
favor of the Quad election.
The signers of the petition claim
that a matter of principle is involved.
They state that they care nothing for
the monetary consideration, but dis
approve of the manner in which the
legislation was "railroaded through,"
as the objectors express it. They be
lieve that a precedent should bo estab
lished to require Quad elections on
questions involving expenditure of
money, as in a vote conducted in any
other way the women are reluctant to
express their true sentiments.
