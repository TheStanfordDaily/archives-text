## 
### 
Professor J. J. R. Macleod, of the
University of Toronto, co-discoverer
of insulin and co-sharer of the Nobel
Prize in medicine in 1923, will offer
courses in the Department of Physi
ology at Stanford next quarter.
Me will exchange places with Pro

Professor of Physiology
Professor Macleod has been profes
sor of physiology at the University
of Toronto since 1918 and associate
dean of the faculty of medicine there.
In that capacity he co-operated with
Dr. F. C. Banting, the young medical
graduate of the university, who, in
1920, started his researches which re
sulted in tne discovery of jnnunu aixu
methods for obtaining it in the large
quantities which its usefulness in
treating diabetes demands.
Insulin Creates Interest
The discovery of insulin created
world-wide interest and resulted in the
establishment of a special laboratory
for its manufacture at the University
of Toronto, and in the establishment
of a special research chair which is
occupied at present by Dr. Banting.
Insulin offers the only treatment at
present known for combating diabetes.
It does not cure the disease, but en
ables those who are suffering from it
to live a considerable number of years,
whereas, without insulin, the disease
would be almost certainly fatal.
Scotch by Birth
Dr. Macleod was born and received
his schooling in Scotland. He has also
studied at Leipzig and at Cambridge.
He began his American teaching at
Western Reserve University in 1903,
remaining there until he went to the
University of Toronto in 1918.
He has received many honors in
America and in England, having been
made president of the American Physi
ological Society in 1922, and a fellow
of the Royal Society In 1923. Dr. Mac
leod is the author of numerous texts
and technical volumes as well as of
books and articles handling physiologi
cal problems in a popular way.
