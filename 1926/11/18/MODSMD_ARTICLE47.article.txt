## 
### 
Developments in the 1926 Stanford
varsity basketball squad are lagging
this week with the high interest in
football, but a squad that has grown
to include nearly forty candidates for
hoop berths this year is working out
under Howard "Muggs" Mitchell, as-
Bistant. and freshman mentor under
Coach "Husky" Hunt.
Veteran material, reported to have
turned out at preliminary practices,
consists only of a handful of the men
who made last year's squad, although
Coach Hunt states that Captain Nel-
Hon David and his first-string players
will be around at the first of the week
to start hoop activities on an inten
sive basis.
