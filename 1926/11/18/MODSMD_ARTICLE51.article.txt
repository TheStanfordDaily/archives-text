# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Judge Walter P. Steffen may some
day be mayor of Chicago. But just
now, as "Advisory Football Coach" at
Carnegie Institute of Technology, he
is much too busy to worry about poli
tics. Tomorrow "Wally's Warriors"
play the strong New York University
team in New York City, and Coach
Steffen has plenty on his mind.
For thirteen years Walter P. Steffen
has been gridiron boss of the college
that has its home in that beautiful set
of buildings in the Smoky City, right
burgh "Pirates" and the Pittsburgh
next door to the homes of the Pitts
"Panthers." During this time Wally
'"as built many great teams and, in so
doing, has built up for himself the
reputatio nof being one of the best
grid coaches in the East. His quarter
backs, by the way, always call signals
by letters instead of numbers. It's one
of his pet ideas.
Steffen, long before he acquired the
ivoirdupois which gives him more
dignity on the judge's bench than it
does on the football field, was a foot
ball star of the first magnitude at the
University of Chicago. He quite cap
ably filled the shoes vacated by the
great Walter Eckersall and was cho
sen as Ail-American quarterback in
190S by the late Walter Camp. Steffen j
was at Chicago, If I'm not mistaken, j
from 1906 to 1909, and was noted for
his fine open-field running. When he 1
first entered the university he had !
quite a reputation as a track man, but
managed to make the football team

the first year he ever played the game, i
It was in one of his few seasons as i
assistant coach to Alonzo Stagg, that \
the following incident took place, j
Steffen, who is a great kidder, was j
approached by the college "half-wit"
who said that he would like to try out
for the football team. When questioned |
as to what he could do, the "dumb
bell" opined that he was pretty fast, j
in fact he had often run 100 yards in I
9 seconds. Wallv said he was just the J
man he was looking for. and to come
around the next day for a try-out. ;
After watching the lad run up and
down the field, Steffen arrived at this
momentous decision. "Your left foot,"
ho said, "runs faster than your right,
but that defect can be remedied. Don't
worry."
Half an hour later, Coach Stagg, to
whom football is every a serious mat
ter, was completely overcome when,
on arriving on the field, his eyes be
held the ludicrous sight of a youth in
football attire trying to run up and
down the field with a heavy sledge
hammer tied to his left foot.


Good Morning Judge
