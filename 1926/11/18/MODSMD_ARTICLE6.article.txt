# INSTRUCTIONS FOR BIG GAME ROOTERS ISSUED BY CONRON
## 
### 
The Rally Committee, through
Cal Conron, chairman, yesterday
issued the following instructions
to Big Game rooters for their
conduct in the rooting section
Saturday:
1. White shirts, bow ties, and
rooters' caps will be required of
all rooters.
2. Those holding rooters' tickets
should be in their seats by ,?
o'clock at the latest, as a group
of card stunts are to be given
before the game starts.
Rooters will be seated in the
order of their arrival, top rows
of the section being filled first.
Twenty-three hundred seats are
being reserved for the section,
which will be just twice the size
of that at the Washington game
last Saturday.
Seven colors will be used for
card stunts. The committee urges
students to take particular care
to prevent error from creeping
in, especially on the part of those
who are color-blind. The stunts
are being organized and the
stunt instruction cards placed by
a committee under the direction
of Ellsworth Barnett.
