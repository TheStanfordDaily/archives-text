# NIBS PRICE WORKING BEARS HARD; FINAL BACKFIELD CHOSEN
## Breckenridge, Blewett, Jabs, Griffin Due to Start In Big Game 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 17.—As the day
of the Big Game draws nigh, "Nibs"
Price is driving the California varsity
in hard, long workouts. Monday after
noon the first team ran through sig
nals for an hour and watched the
second string scrimmage the Goofs,
who used Stanford plays.
Dougery Shines
Ralph Dougery at fullback stood out
on the offense, reeling off runs and
passing to Phillips for long gains.
Dougery, who was moved into the
backfield from end two weeks ago,
has already worked himself up to a
first-string substitute and, should any
thing happen to Jabs in the Big Game,
will no doubt take his place backing
up the line.
"Red" Gill is also working with the
second team, Harold Breckenridge now
holding down the safety job on the
first varsity. "Brecky" is faster and
trickier than Gill, just as dependable
on the defense, and a much more ac
curate passed. The combination of
Captain Griffin, Jabs, Blewett, and
Br-eckenridge is almost certain to start
Saturday.
It is unlikely that any of the linemen
who started against Nevada and Wash
ington will start next Saturday. Jim
Dougery and Huber on the ends have
definitely supplanted Phillips and Ban
croft, although probably both of the
latter will get into the game. Dougery
ias a slightly bruised leg, but will be
in shape before Saturday. Miller, cen
ter, Niswander and Sargent, guards,
and Coltrin and Cork at tackles will
comprise the remainder of the line.
