# Phi Beta Kappa Key Formerly Used to Wind Owner's Watch
## 
### 
In the days before 1885, students who
possessed Phi Beta Kappa keys put them
to a different use than do those of the
present day. Phi Beta keys were then
used for winding watches. The key
itself was not so highly prized as was
its utility. Watches were essential to full
enjoyment of the honorary fraternity
award.
However, there was another difficulty
to overcome. In those days before stem
winding watches, when every watchmaker
worked along original lines, no key could
be made to wind up every watch. It was
then up to the jeweler to shape the key
to fit the watch. Frequently, however, it
was necessary to fit the watch to the key.
