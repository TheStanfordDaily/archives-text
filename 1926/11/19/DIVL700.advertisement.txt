IT'S THE SPIRIT
that makes a winner
I
A CRISP TANGY DAY with just a bit of wind. The game in
the last quarter. The score tied. The fourth down. Two yards
to go. Then—it's the spirit that makes a winner!
-
THE TEAMS CROUCH TENSELY. The referee's whistle
summons the stands to silence. Signals snap out. Twenty
two players are galvanized into action. Now—it's the spirit
that will make the winner!
SUDDENLY THE MAN with the ball shoots clear of the
scrimmage. From the stadium comes a reverberating roar —
"Touchdown"—"Touchdown!" It's the spirit that's made
a winner!
WINNERS IN APPAREL and winners in football—it's the
same spirit that distinguishes the ordinary from the leader —
and carries it to the top. In Paris, one finds the world's most
fashionable women buying along the Rue de la Paix for ap
parel winners—but it takes many days in Paris to find as
many smart frocks, hats, coats, and all accessoris as Ihe
White House presents daily.
