"Kicking off" at promptly 8:15
o'clock, Ram's Head's contribution to
Big Game festivities, the "Football
Gaieties of 1926," will be staged to
night in the Assembly Hall under the
direction of Gordon Davis. From the
overture led by Gordon Hall, musical
director, to the finale, each of the acts
listed 011 the "Gaieties" program has
been so directed by Gordon Davis as
to form a compact program similar to
the intimate Broadway revues. With
the exception of two sketches from the
"Music Box Revue," the "Gaieties" is
the product of Stanford talent, Ram's
Head Society having taken over the
annual production for this purpose.
The acts have been chosen from a
large number submitted by students
and selected by the "Gaieties" com
mittee; music for most of the num
bers has been composed by Stanford
students; and an all-star cast, consist
ing of men prominent in campus
activities, notably Sidney Meeks,
A.S.S.U. vice-president, and Tom
Breeze, Chaparral editor, in addition
to most of the local dramatic figures,
has been selected.
Following the opening number, the
first of two New York sketches, will
be presentedâ€”a farcical burlesque on
the conventional murder drama. Next
is the dancing act of Frances Boone,
Van King, and Hal Boone, who have
worked out clever dancing numbers
and novel scenic effects. The second
skit from the "Music Box Revue" fol
lows, featuring Mac Lewis, Byron Har
vey, Sam Hayes, and Pat Kelley in an
act appropriately called "Cards."
