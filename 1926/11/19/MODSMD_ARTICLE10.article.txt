# CARDINAL FOOTBALL TEAM ENTERS CALIFORNIA TILT FAVORED TO WIN
## Varsity Must Fight Every Minute of Game to Defeat Bears, Says "Pop" Warner; Berkeley Has All To Gain, Nothing to Lose ALL-AMERICAN TEAM PICKERS WILL BE BUSY Event of Cardinal Victory at California Tomorrow Will Give First Conference Title to Stanford in Football History of University 
### Jim Adams 
Slated as heavy favorites, Pop Warner's undefeated Stanford eleven will meet
the badly battered California team tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock on the turf
of the California Memorial Stadium in the thirty-third annual Big Game.
A win over California will not only give Stanford the greatest satisfaction
of a football season but will in addition return the Cards as Pacific Coast Confer
ence champions, an honor which they have never enjoyed alone, having shared the
championship two years ago with the Bears. In turn another beating for California
will be a hard dose for the Bears, first because it comes from their traditional rival,
and secondly because it will add one more to the unbroken string of conference
defeats that have befallen the Blue and Gold eleven this season.
Warner has told his men, the Stanford students, and the football world at
large that unless the Cards play their best football the California team may rise
from its under position to battle over their heads and do the unexpected. It is not

'an inconceivable event, as Stanford has
proved a good many times, especially in
the last few years.
However, it is hardly expected that the
Cardinals will be laying down 011 the job
Saturday. Warner has been busy all
week with anti-toxin for any symptoms
of the poisonous over-confidence on the
Stanford squad. That powerful come
back that the Cards have exhibited in the
last half of the Nevada, Oregon, U.S.C.,
and Washington games indicates that
should the crippled Bear draw first blood
it will suffer for it dearly.
Stanford Beats Huskies
There are other factors that should
urge the Cardinals to put forth their best
football Saturday. Warner has brought
his team along so that it will be at its
peak tomorrow although the Huskies
found them not far from there last week.
Also, if the Cards do not play New
Year's, a matter which has not yet been
' decided, seven members of the eleven
! will be playing their last {>31110 for Stan
j ford and will endeavor to make that their
I best. Captain Swan, Shipkey, Poulson,
Harris, Walker, McCreery, and Bogue
will be lost to next year's team.
Selectors of mythical elevens will be
j watching a number of participants to-
I morrow to justify their selection for
j various teams.
A comparison of the relative strength
j of the two elevens leads to the undeni
able conclusion that Stanford has the
edge in all departments with the possible
exception of punting, in which Clymer
of the Bears, if he plays, will probably
1 excel. Even in this department BilT Hoff
man will give him a merry run. The
Stanford line is strong, fast charging,
and well fortified in each position by
capable substitutes. The diversified of
fense with six fleet-footed halfbacks
ready to lead the assault makes it about
the most feared on the Coast.
Bear Defense Strong
The Bears are stronger 011 defense than
offense. Injuries and only mediocre ma
i terial have handicapped Coach Price all
year in turning out an attack. Perrin, the
best ball carrier of his squad, was lost
early in the season because of a broken
ankle, and Brick Marcus, another of his
best halfbacks, has been out ever since
the U.S.C. game when he broke his leg.
The Cards will find an experienced and
hardy group of players confronting them
from tackle to tackle but the California
| flank men are only of average ability.
I These two will have a tough job 011 their
; hands stopping the reverses and double
reverses that will be directed their way
tomorrow.
Cards in Good Shape
The Cardinals are in good physical
shape. Hill and Lewis have been nursing
minor injuries this week but they will
be in condition for service. Warner has
not given his charges any heavy work
outs this week, being content to polish
up his offense and train the team against
California plays.
Both coaches have announced a tenta
tive lineup hut it is subject to changes
before the game. Poulson and Harris,
veteran tackles, will be back at their
posts tomorrow and Post is slated to
start a quarter. Hyland and Bogue will
form the halfback duet at the opening
whistle and Hoffman will be at full.
Captain Swan, Shipkey, McCreery, Ro
besky, and Walker fill out the veteran
line.
Price has selected Huber and Jim
Dougery at ends, Coltrin and Cook as
tackles, Niswander and Sargent as
guards, and Miller at center. The Bear
backficld will line up with Captain Grif
: fin at full, Blewett at quarter, and Jabs
I and Breckenbridge as halfs. The Cali
j fornia backs will be subject to many
shifts in that Red Gill has shown a great
deal of promise at times this season and
Cockburn is a strong defensive fullback.
Price may also have to send in Clymer
to put the Bears out of danger with his
long punts.
Nothing much different is expected in
W arner's offense as he has used prac
tically all his plays in games to date.
Very few teams have been able to stop
his reverse plays and it is doubtful that
the Bears can. Hoffman and Hyland
arc triple threat men# and California
will have a difficult time trying to fig
ure what's coming next with these two
in the backlield. Murphy, Hill, Wilton
and Sims will all probably get in the
game before it is over. There is also
a strong possibility that Lewis, the
sophomore signal caller who has recently
stepped into the limelight, may see
action.
Sellman and Freeman will probably
get into the game, depending 011 just
how well Poulson and Harris hold down
their jobs. Although the former two
worked their way into the first string
lineup by their playing in the U. S. C.
and Washington game both the veterans
are first class tackles when at their best
as they should be tomorrow in their
last game.

tomorrow.
Cards in Good Shape
The Cardinals are in good physical
shape. Hill and Lewis have been nursing
minor injuries this week but they will
be in condition for service. Warner has
not given his charges any heavy work
outs this week, being content to polish
up his offense and train the team against
California plays.
Both coaches have announced a tenta
tive lineup hut it is subject to changes
before the game. Poulson and Harris,
veteran tackles, will be back at their
posts tomorrow and Post is slated to
start a quarter. Hyland and Bogue will
form the halfback duet at the opening
whistle and Hoffman will be at full.
Captain Swan, Shipkey, McCreery, Ro
besky, and Walker fill out the veteran
line.
Price has selected Huber and Jim
Dougery at ends, Coltrin and Cook as
tackles, Niswander and Sargent as
guards, and Miller at center. The Bear
backficld will line up with Captain Grif
: fin at full, Blewett at quarter, and Jabs
I and Breckenbridge as halfs. The Cali
j fornia backs will be subject to many
shifts in that Red Gill has shown a great
deal of promise at times this season and
Cockburn is a strong defensive fullback.
Price may also have to send in Clymer
to put the Bears out of danger with his
long punts.
Nothing much different is expected in
W arner's offense as he has used prac
tically all his plays in games to date.
Very few teams have been able to stop
his reverse plays and it is doubtful that
the Bears can. Hoffman and Hyland
arc triple threat men# and California
will have a difficult time trying to fig
ure what's coming next with these two
in the backlield. Murphy, Hill, Wilton
and Sims will all probably get in the
game before it is over. There is also
a strong possibility that Lewis, the
sophomore signal caller who has recently
stepped into the limelight, may see
action.
Sellman and Freeman will probably
get into the game, depending 011 just
how well Poulson and Harris hold down
their jobs. Although the former two
worked their way into the first string
lineup by their playing in the U. S. C.
and Washington game both the veterans
are first class tackles when at their best
as they should be tomorrow in their
last game.
Slated as heavy favorites, Pop Warner's undefeated Stanford eleven will meet
the badly battered California team tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock on the turf
of the California Memorial Stadium in the thirty-third annual Big Game.
A win over California will not only give Stanford the greatest satisfaction
of a football season but will in addition return the Cards as Pacific Coast Confer
ence champions, an honor which they have never enjoyed alone, having shared the
championship two years ago with the Bears. In turn another beating for California
will be a hard dose for the Bears, first because it comes from their traditional rival,
and secondly because it will add one more to the unbroken string of conference
defeats that have befallen the Blue and Gold eleven this season.
Warner has told his men, the Stanford students, and the football world at
large that unless the Cards play their best football the California team may rise
from its under position to battle over their heads and do the unexpected. It is not

'an inconceivable event, as Stanford has
proved a good many times, especially in
the last few years.
However, it is hardly expected that the
Cardinals will be laying down 011 the job
Saturday. Warner has been busy all
week with anti-toxin for any symptoms
of the poisonous over-confidence on the
Stanford squad. That powerful come
back that the Cards have exhibited in the
last half of the Nevada, Oregon, U.S.C.,
and Washington games indicates that
should the crippled Bear draw first blood
it will suffer for it dearly.
Stanford Beats Huskies
There are other factors that should
urge the Cardinals to put forth their best
football Saturday. Warner has brought
his team along so that it will be at its
peak tomorrow although the Huskies
found them not far from there last week.
Also, if the Cards do not play New
Year's, a matter which has not yet been
' decided, seven members of the eleven
! will be playing their last {>31110 for Stan
j ford and will endeavor to make that their
I best. Captain Swan, Shipkey, Poulson,
Harris, Walker, McCreery, and Bogue
will be lost to next year's team.
Selectors of mythical elevens will be
j watching a number of participants to-
I morrow to justify their selection for
j various teams.
A comparison of the relative strength
j of the two elevens leads to the undeni
able conclusion that Stanford has the
edge in all departments with the possible
exception of punting, in which Clymer
of the Bears, if he plays, will probably
1 excel. Even in this department BilT Hoff
man will give him a merry run. The
Stanford line is strong, fast charging,
and well fortified in each position by
capable substitutes. The diversified of
fense with six fleet-footed halfbacks
ready to lead the assault makes it about
the most feared on the Coast.
Bear Defense Strong
The Bears are stronger 011 defense than
offense. Injuries and only mediocre ma
i terial have handicapped Coach Price all
year in turning out an attack. Perrin, the
best ball carrier of his squad, was lost
early in the season because of a broken
ankle, and Brick Marcus, another of his
best halfbacks, has been out ever since
the U.S.C. game when he broke his leg.

will be a hard dose for the Bears, first because it comes from their traditional rival,
and secondly because it will add one more to the unbroken string of conference
defeats that have befallen the Blue and Gold eleven this season.
Warner has told his men, the Stanford students, and the football world at
large that unless the Cards play their best football the California team may rise
from its under position to battle over their heads and do the unexpected. It is not

'an inconceivable event, as Stanford has
proved a good many times, especially in
the last few years.
However, it is hardly expected that the
Cardinals will be laying down 011 the job
Saturday. Warner has been busy all
week with anti-toxin for any symptoms
of the poisonous over-confidence on the
Stanford squad. That powerful come
back that the Cards have exhibited in the
last half of the Nevada, Oregon, U.S.C.,
and Washington games indicates that
should the crippled Bear draw first blood
it will suffer for it dearly.
Stanford Beats Huskies
There are other factors that should
urge the Cardinals to put forth their best
football Saturday. Warner has brought
his team along so that it will be at its
peak tomorrow although the Huskies
found them not far from there last week.
Also, if the Cards do not play New
Year's, a matter which has not yet been
' decided, seven members of the eleven
! will be playing their last {>31110 for Stan
j ford and will endeavor to make that their
I best. Captain Swan, Shipkey, Poulson,
Harris, Walker, McCreery, and Bogue
will be lost to next year's team.
Selectors of mythical elevens will be
j watching a number of participants to-
I morrow to justify their selection for
j various teams.
A comparison of the relative strength
j of the two elevens leads to the undeni
able conclusion that Stanford has the
edge in all departments with the possible
exception of punting, in which Clymer
of the Bears, if he plays, will probably
1 excel. Even in this department BilT Hoff
man will give him a merry run. The
Stanford line is strong, fast charging,
and well fortified in each position by
capable substitutes. The diversified of
fense with six fleet-footed halfbacks
ready to lead the assault makes it about
the most feared on the Coast.
Bear Defense Strong
The Bears are stronger 011 defense than
offense. Injuries and only mediocre ma
i terial have handicapped Coach Price all
year in turning out an attack. Perrin, the
best ball carrier of his squad, was lost
early in the season because of a broken
ankle, and Brick Marcus, another of his
best halfbacks, has been out ever since
the U.S.C. game when he broke his leg.
The Cards will find an experienced and
hardy group of players confronting them
from tackle to tackle but the California
| flank men are only of average ability.
I These two will have a tough job 011 their
; hands stopping the reverses and double
reverses that will be directed their way
tomorrow.
Cards in Good Shape
The Cardinals are in good physical
shape. Hill and Lewis have been nursing
minor injuries this week but they will
be in condition for service. Warner has
not given his charges any heavy work
outs this week, being content to polish
up his offense and train the team against
California plays.
Both coaches have announced a tenta
tive lineup hut it is subject to changes
before the game. Poulson and Harris,
veteran tackles, will be back at their
posts tomorrow and Post is slated to
start a quarter. Hyland and Bogue will
form the halfback duet at the opening
whistle and Hoffman will be at full.
Captain Swan, Shipkey, McCreery, Ro
besky, and Walker fill out the veteran
line.
Price has selected Huber and Jim
Dougery at ends, Coltrin and Cook as
tackles, Niswander and Sargent as
guards, and Miller at center. The Bear
backficld will line up with Captain Grif
: fin at full, Blewett at quarter, and Jabs
I and Breckenbridge as halfs. The Cali
j fornia backs will be subject to many
shifts in that Red Gill has shown a great
deal of promise at times this season and
Cockburn is a strong defensive fullback.
Price may also have to send in Clymer
to put the Bears out of danger with his
long punts.
Nothing much different is expected in
W arner's offense as he has used prac
tically all his plays in games to date.
Very few teams have been able to stop
his reverse plays and it is doubtful that
the Bears can. Hoffman and Hyland
arc triple threat men# and California
will have a difficult time trying to fig
ure what's coming next with these two
in the backlield. Murphy, Hill, Wilton
and Sims will all probably get in the
game before it is over. There is also
a strong possibility that Lewis, the
sophomore signal caller who has recently
stepped into the limelight, may see
action.
Sellman and Freeman will probably
get into the game, depending 011 just
how well Poulson and Harris hold down
their jobs. Although the former two
worked their way into the first string
lineup by their playing in the U. S. C.
and Washington game both the veterans
are first class tackles when at their best
as they should be tomorrow in their
last game.
Slated as heavy favorites, Pop Warner's undefeated Stanford eleven will meet
the badly battered California team tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock on the turf
of the California Memorial Stadium in the thirty-third annual Big Game.
A win over California will not only give Stanford the greatest satisfaction
of a football season but will in addition return the Cards as Pacific Coast Confer
ence champions, an honor which they have never enjoyed alone, having shared the
championship two years ago with the Bears. In turn another beating for California
will be a hard dose for the Bears, first because it comes from their traditional rival,
and secondly because it will add one more to the unbroken string of conference
