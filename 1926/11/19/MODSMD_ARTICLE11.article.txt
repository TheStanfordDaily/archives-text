# SENIOR WOMEN DROP FIRST HOCKEY GAME OF SEASON TO 1929
## Sophomores Upset Forecast In 2 to 1 Victory Over Upperclass Team 
### 
Reversing predictions, the sopho
more women's hockey team defeated
the seniors 2 to 1 in the first game
of the championship series yesterday
afternoon on Roble field. The seniors
played with ten women, lacking a
cfenter halfback.
1929 Scores First
The sophomores scored first, when
Juanita White, left inner, made a
clean drive which passed over the
feet of Wilma Fenner, senior goal
guard, and glanced into the goal. The
seniors scored soon after, Marie Man
chee, center forward, shooting in and
following up her own drive with a
short push into goal as three other
players disputed the ball among them
selves, fumbling badly.
White Makes Goal
For sixteen minutes the second half
was scoreless, the sophomores staying
on the senior 25-yard line most of the
time, unable to penetrate the senior
defense. The seniors stuck to defense
work in the main, occasionally carry
ing the ball down to threaten the 1929
goal.
With four minutes to play, the sen
iors were on the soghomore 25-yard
line. The inners bullied, and the ball
was sent clear toward the center of
the field. Miss White dashed for it,
took it on her stick, and pounded
down the field with the senior right
fullback close behind, but unable to
overtake her and tackle. Just inside
the scoring circle Miss White took
aim and sent the ball whizzing into the
goal, two feet away from Miss Fenner.
Seniors Defend
The seniors were able only to hold
back further sophomore attacks during
the remaining minutes of play.
This game changes the outlook of
the hockey season inasmuch as it
<rives the sophomores a fighting
hance, although the juniors are still
favorites to win the championship.
Except in the event of a tie, caused by
iio team emerging undefeated, the sen
iors are in serious danger of coming
in third or even last.
