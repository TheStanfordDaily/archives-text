There was a time when all the editor of the Daily could do the night
before the Big Game was to fill his column with accounts of the Stanford
fight, and the Stanford Spirit.
This year the task is much easier. He may speak at great length of
the fast-charging, hard-hitting Stanford line, of the fast and heavy ends,
Walker and Shipkey. He may speak at length of the veteran tackles,
Harris and Poulson, and of the way in which they must fight to beat out
their close rivals, Sellman and Freeman. He may treat upon Don
Robeskey the play-smearing guard, and of his fighting and spirited
colleague, Captain Fred Swan. He might write a paragraph about
McCreery, who has learned to pass a ball from center, and who never
had to learn how to fight.
And as for that backfield .... Hyland and Bogue will start. Dick
Hyland, whose flying legs baffle tacklers, and George Bogue, who threw
himself at Guttormsen, when the latter was about to execute the famous
Washington hard-tack(le) (pun) with the result that the latter gentle
man was carried from the field.
It is easy to write of Eli Post, master of the Warner system, and
first-class, clipping back, and of Biff Hoffman, the plunging fullback
who punts fifty yards like nobody's business, and who has passed a
football sixty yards from scrimmage.
Is it possible that writers generally have neglected a proper account
of the Stanford spirit this year because they were so busy telling of the
virtues of the Stanford varsity? It is.
AND REMEMBER THlS—that tomorrow, when all the men
and women of Stanford get together in that rooting section, and
when the Stanford varsity trots on the field, the Stanford Spirit
will be very much there. For the Stanford Spirit is a thing that
is bred deep in the mind and heart of everyone who has the
slightest thing to do with Stanford.
