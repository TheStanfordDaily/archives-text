# And Even Further

1 his morning Harry B. Smith, of the San Francisco Chronicle will
say;
1 here are rallies and rallies. I discovered as much when 1 had
an opportunity of attending the Stanford bonfire rally last Wed
nesday night. It struck me there was something lacking.
And finally an effort was made to analyze "that something
lacking."
It all resolved itself into this decision:
You can't do much rallying when you have a team posted as
good as a 5-to-l shot, for there isn't much excuse for the cheering
and getting behind the boys. That sort of thing goes over best
either when you arc pulling for a team that is presumed to be a
forlorn cause or one where the outcome of the game is nip and
tuck.
So, hereafter, I'll prefer to confine myself to rallies where
there is real cause of a fighting spirit.
Humph! Confine himself to places where there is a real cause for
fighting spirit. Stanford was never faced with a greater cause for that
old spirit. And was there a time when the campus was ever more behind
its team?
NEVER!! And tomorrow afternoon when we all desert the "Farm"
for the Berkeley campus the entire mob of rooters will be pulsating with
that intangible something that really makes a team think that there is a
result to strive for.
JUST WATCH THE SCORE PILE UP!!
And"if the rooters sit peacefully in the stadium, awaiting the efforts
of the varsity without getting interestedâ€”well, some writers should
spend more time on their thinking!
