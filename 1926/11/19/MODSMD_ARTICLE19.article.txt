# SMITH FIRST COACH AT CALIFORNIA AFTER SWITCH FROM RUGBY
## Andy Perfects System That Laid Foundation For "Wonder Teams" 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 18.â€”It was a dark
period for California football hack in
1916. A switch from rugby to American
football was being made, and with strong
opposition from alumni, the press, and
public sentiment, the California varsity
was in dire need of a coach who would
be able to place the gridiron game on a
firm foundation at the University.
Andrew L. Smith, the head coach at
Purdue, was secured as the mentor for
the Bear eleven, and it was not a light
task that was placed in his hands upon
his arrival.
Strong Opposition
Confronted with rugby material, and
strong opposition to the American game,
he realized the magnitude ot his position.
Therefore, Andy decided upon a new
system of football. It has been known
as the "Smith" system, and various other
names, but it is really a California
system.
With eight years of coaching at Penn
sylvania, and three at Purdue, Smith had
a splendid opportunity to review football
as it was played in the East and Middle
West. Besides these qualifications, Andy
played football at the University of
Pennsylvania, and during his last two
years at his Alma Mater, his playing at
tracted so much attention that he was
selected by Walter Camp as fullback on
the first All-American eleven, for two
years.
Develops New System
With an excellent background for foot
ball lore, Andy started to develop a Cali
fornia system. From the East he selected
the kicking game, and a strong defense.
The Middle West contributed a para
mount factor, hanging tenaciously onto
the ball until forced to kick. But Andy
did not intend to overdo these points.
Combined with a broad perspective as
to the way which they should be em
ployed, Smith laid the foundation of his
method. But it is necessary to remember
that three contributions from Andy were
necessary to make the system workable.
Simplicity Required
The first necessary qualification for a
football player in Andy's estimation is
that he should be a student. Then Andy
decided upon simplicity as one of the
cardinal principles of his idea. Straight
football was to be the main support, but
the value of this type of play would
lie in the perfection of execution.
Another thought incorporated in the
system was to have the material for the
next season's varsity get into the second
half of the game during the current sea
son. It would develop the men. and a
process of gradual football education
would be gradually instilled in the men.
It is not necessary to reiterate state
ments about the necessary mental require
ments for Bear gridders. The idea has
been explained so often that it is familiar
to every follower of the Golden Bear
eleven under Andy Smith.
