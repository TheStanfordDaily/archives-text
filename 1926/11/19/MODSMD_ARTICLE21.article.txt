# CALIFORNIA ELEVEN SHOWS IMPROVEMENT FOR CARDINAL GAME
## Bears Will Enter Fray as Underdogg for First Time in Years 
### 
1 lie Golden Bear of California, which
Stanford meets tomorrow afternoon in
the 1926 conference finale for both
teams, has experienced its worst sea
son in years, losing five games, four of
which counted against it in the confer
ence standings, and winning only from
the Olympic Club, Santa Clara, and
Nevada.
The Bruins were unfortunate in
drawing an extremely hard schedule
for the year. This, added to the facts
of having a new coach and a limited
amount of material, makes it easy to
see why they ran into difficulties. After
winning from Santa Clara ami the
Olympics, they started 011 the downhill
grade and lost to St. Mary's, 0.A.C.,
U.S.C., Oregon, and Washington on
successive Saturdays. Then, last Sat
urday, they regained their poise and
won from Nevada.
Tomorrow, however, the Californians
are meeting the probable coast cham
pions and it looks as though they are
in for a rough ride, with the Cardinals
at the top of their game. A Stanford
victory will mark the Bear's fifth con
ference setback and will leave them
without a win over a league team, some
thing they have not been without for
many a year.
Everything broke against California
this season, though, and Nibs Price has
had as hard an assignment as any
coach ever drew, and it was only his
first year as head mentor, too.
When the season started the pros
pects of at least a good team were
quite bright, but bad luck started to
take a liand in the affairs very early in
the fall, and when Paul Perrin went out
of the game with a broken leg Price
lost one of his best ground gainers and
his outstanding open field runner.
This injury to Perrin left Griffin and
Jabs as the only steady pigskin packers
in the backfield and both of these men
are only line plungers, so Price had to
forget about any sort of attack other
than straight football. Clymer, who
has played quarterback most of the
time, is not a good man at carrying the
oval, but his kicking made it necessary
that he be included in the lineup. Brick
Marcus had been doing well until his
leg was broken in the U.S.C. game,
thus adding more to Price's troubles.
Dick Blewett is a good defensive
back but not an offensive power.

When the season started the pros
pects of at least a good team were
quite bright, but bad luck started to
take a liand in the affairs very early in
the fall, and when Paul Perrin went out
of the game with a broken leg Price
lost one of his best ground gainers and
his outstanding open field runner.
This injury to Perrin left Griffin and
Jabs as the only steady pigskin packers
in the backfield and both of these men
are only line plungers, so Price had to
forget about any sort of attack other
than straight football. Clymer, who
has played quarterback most of the
time, is not a good man at carrying the
oval, but his kicking made it necessary
that he be included in the lineup. Brick
Marcus had been doing well until his
leg was broken in the U.S.C. game,
thus adding more to Price's troubles.
Dick Blewett is a good defensive
back but not an offensive power.
1 lie Golden Bear of California, which
Stanford meets tomorrow afternoon in
the 1926 conference finale for both
teams, has experienced its worst sea
son in years, losing five games, four of
which counted against it in the confer
ence standings, and winning only from
the Olympic Club, Santa Clara, and
Nevada.
The Bruins were unfortunate in
drawing an extremely hard schedule
for the year. This, added to the facts
of having a new coach and a limited
amount of material, makes it easy to
see why they ran into difficulties. After
winning from Santa Clara ami the
Olympics, they started 011 the downhill
grade and lost to St. Mary's, 0.A.C.,
U.S.C., Oregon, and Washington on
successive Saturdays. Then, last Sat
urday, they regained their poise and
won from Nevada.
Tomorrow, however, the Californians
are meeting the probable coast cham
pions and it looks as though they are
in for a rough ride, with the Cardinals
at the top of their game. A Stanford
victory will mark the Bear's fifth con
ference setback and will leave them
without a win over a league team, some
thing they have not been without for
many a year.
Everything broke against California
this season, though, and Nibs Price has
had as hard an assignment as any
coach ever drew, and it was only his
first year as head mentor, too.
