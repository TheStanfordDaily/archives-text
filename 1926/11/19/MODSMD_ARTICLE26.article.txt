# A 						POP AND SEVERAL OF HIS BOYS

Fred Swan, captain of the Stanford varsity, is below at the left, and Ted Shipkey appears at the right, while George Bogue is bucking
between the two men with the ball carefully tucked under his arm. These three players are in the starting lineup for Stanford—Swan at
guard, Bogue at halfback, and Shipkey at end. Swan, Bogue and Shipkey graduate this season, and their loss will be felt
when the roll is called in 1927.


Pop Warner is seen on the left thinking. He is trying to
decide upon the attack to use against the Bears tomorrow.
He might use straight football, then again he might open up
with tricks and forward passes. Unfortunately he thinks to
himself, and we will only know tomorrow afternoon
what he decided.
