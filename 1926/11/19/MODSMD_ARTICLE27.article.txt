# FRATERNITY COUNCIL PUBLISHES TENTATIVE PLANS FOR RUSHING
## Board Warns Groups About Violating Rules At Football Game 
### 
Warning has been issued by the Inter-
Fraternity Council to fraternity men
against rushing during the week-end of
the Big Game. Being in the company of
a freshman constitutes rushing and any
violations of the rule will be dealt with
by the council.
Regulations covering the 1927 rushing
season were tentatively adopted at a
meeting of the council Monday evening.
A few minor points may be altered in
the future, but the list, on the whole, will
remain as it now stands. The rules ap
proved arc as follows:
During the first two weeks of the
spring quarter there shall be no rushing.
The council interprets this to mean that
there shall be no entertaining of fresh
men at athletic contests or elsewhere on
the campus, nor shall Encina Hall be
invaded except upon urgent business, and
then only with the permission of a fra
ternity sponsor. There shall be no off
campus rushing of any sort.
Actual rushing begins on Sunday, April
10, 1927. During the first period the
houses will be divided into two groups to
be selected later.
Group one shall rush on the following
days: Sunday, April 10; Tuesday, April
12; Thursday, April 14; Monday, April
18; Wednesday, April 20.
Group two shall rush on the following
days: Monday, April 11; Wednesday,
April 13; Friday, April 15; Sunday,
April 17; Tuesday, April 19.
Rushing is forbidden on the day of the
Stanford-California track meet.
During this first period a fraternity
may have only one date with each fresh
man and throughout this period the dates
shall begin at 11 :30 a.m. and end at 2
p.m. for luncheons and shall begin at
5 :30 p.m. and end at 8 p.m. for dinners.
From Wednesday evening till Sunday
noon, April 24, there shall be no rushing.
The second period begins at noon on
Sunday, April 24, and ends Friday
night, April 29. The time allotted for
rushing during this second period is as
follows: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Sunday; 11 :30
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 8
p.m., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday; 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5 :30
p.m. to 1 a.m., Friday; 8 a.m. to 1 a.m.,
Saturday.
The final period begins on Monday,
May 3, and extends to Tuesday evening,
May 4. The time allotted for rushing
during this period is as follows: 11:30
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday. On Friday the time will be
extended to 11 p.m.

i Dates with freshmen will be made
I only by means of form cards and the
| first set of these will be given out Wed
nesday evening from 8 till 9 o'clock at
j the Old Union. Dates for giving out the
second and third sets will be announced
at Inter-Fraternity Council meetings.
These cards, which will be self-explan
atory, are to be sent to each freshman
whom the house desires to invite, with
a list of dates from which he may accept
one (either a luncheon or dinner) during
i the first period. On cards covering the
! second and third periods a freshman may
accept as many of the dates offered by
the house as he desires.
His signature in the proper place sig
| nifies his acceptance and is binding. If a
| house permits a visit by a freshman who
: has not signed for that date, it has vio
lated this rule, and it will be denied
j pledging privileges as a penalty. How
i ever, on the last evening of rushing,
Tuesday, May 4, freshmen may visit
any house or houses regardless of signa
tures on the date cards.
On Thursday night, May S, all bids
must be delivered to a clerk appointed by
j the Boards of Control, which clerk will
be at the Old Union between the hours
of 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Bids must be type
written and in alphabetical order.
Pledging will take place on Saturday,
May 12, at the Old Union where a law
yer, selected by the Board of Control,
will extend the bids.
A man who is eligible for pledging who
j is not pledged at formal bidding may not
: be rushed or pledged before 11:30 a.m.
on the following day, May 13, 1927.
General rules passed by the Board of
Control are: Those students who have
completed ninety or more units of credit,
or who are upper division students, may
be pledged before they have completed
a year's residence at the University pro
vided that notices have been sent to all
other fraternities by the secretary of the
Board of Control and they have been
previously declared eligible by the chair
man of the Board of Control. Until a
man who registers for the first time
during a given year completes ninety
units of work, he shall be considered as
a freshman for rushing purposes.
There shall be no off-campus rushing.
Freshmen shall not be allowed to ac
| cept positions as waiters in fraternities
I after the first two weeks in the winter
j quarter until after fraternity pledging.
