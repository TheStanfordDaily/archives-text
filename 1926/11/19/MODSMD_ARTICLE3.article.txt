# CARDS, BEARS CLASH FOR SOCCER HONORS AT U.C .TOMORROW
## 
### Elbert G. Thomas 
Stanford's varsity soccer team has
its big day tomorrow when it meets
the University of California kickers
on even terms in the second game of
the annual series. The teams will play
before the Big Game crowd in the
Memorial Stadium at 12 o'clock in an
attempt to break the tie resulting from
the 0-0 score of their first tussle.
Playing, in the absence of Coach
Harry W. Maloney, under the direc- j
tion of Don McCarty and Captain Rob- j
ert Ballard, the Cardinal eloven de
veloped almost overnight into a pow
erful defensive aggregation which
staved off defeat at the hands of the
supposed Bear favorites on Armistice
Day. The Blue and Gold kickers, it ;
cannot be denied, looked to be the
better team in that game, but it was I
due to the constant aggressiveness of
the Redshirts that the day was saved.
Soccer is a fust game that breaks
readily one way or the other, and the
Stanford forwards may convert one
offensive drive into the winning point,
while countless rushes of the Bears
may go by the boards under the bar
rage of the Cards' defensive backs.
The Stanford players, while not con
fident in anything but their fight and
their psychological advantage as
under-dog, go to Berkeley tomorrow
with the attitude that as long as they
lid it once, they may do it better the
next time.
Practice this week has accomplished
a lot in the way of stepping up the
team's formations, and changes in the
forward line haife made for offense
ability, a department in which the
Cards have been particularly weak this
season. Gibbs has been shifted to cen
er forward, where, flanked by Captain
Bailard and Strowger, he is the key
man in the offense attack.
While directors of the team have
not yet announced a definite starting
line-up, it is probable that they will
take the field as follows: Coleman, 0.1.,
Strowger, i.1., Gibbs, c.f., Capt. Bailard,
i.r., Farewell, or., Wright, c.h., Can
non, 1.h., Stollery, r.h., Newlands, r.f.,
Evans, 1.f., and Forrest, goaltender.
First-string men who will either do
relief work or start the game include
Butler, Hivero, Zipfel, and Hay, for
wards; Fell and Jacobson, halves, and
Turnbull, goal.
