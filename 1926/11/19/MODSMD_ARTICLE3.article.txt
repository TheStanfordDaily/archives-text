# CARDS, BEARS CLASH FOR SOCCER HONORS AT U.C .TOMORROW
## 
### Elbert G. Thomas 
Stanford's varsity soccer team has
its big day tomorrow when it meets
the University of California kickers
on even terms in the second game of
the annual series. The teams will play
before the Big Game crowd in the
Memorial Stadium at 12 o'clock in an
attempt to break the tie resulting from
the 0-0 score of their first tussle.
Playing, in the absence of Coach
Harry W. Maloney, under the direc- j
tion of Don McCarty and Captain Rob- j
ert Ballard, the Cardinal eloven de
veloped almost overnight into a pow
erful defensive aggregation which
staved off defeat at the hands of the
supposed Bear favorites on Armistice
Day. The Blue and Gold kickers, it ;
cannot be denied, looked to be the
better team in that game, but it was I
due to the constant aggressiveness of
the Redshirts that the day was saved.
Soccer is a fust game that breaks
readily one way or the other, and the
Stanford forwards may convert one
offensive drive into the winning point,
while countless rushes of the Bears
may go by the boards under the bar
rage of the Cards' defensive backs.
