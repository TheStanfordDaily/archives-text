# FOOTBALL "EVILS" ARE FEWER TODAY THAN EARLIER, DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
That the evils of football are much
fewer today than they were in 1906
when American football was abolished
at Stanford University and the Univer
sity of California, is the belief of Dr.
David Starr Jordan. "Many of the old
faults," said Dr. Jordan in a recent in
terview, "such as cheating, 'hiring' of
star players, and rough playing to pur
posely disable members of the opposing
team are largely a thing of the past."
In discussing the over-emphasis of
football, Dr. Jordan stated that "if we
have football and competitive sports at
all, they are bound to be emphasized
to the limit. The tendency to make a
public show out of an athletic game is
unfortunate, but I don't see how it can
be avoided." "It is a mistake" believes
Dr. Jordan, "for students to think that
success in football contributes much to
Lire standing ot a University. But," he
added, "I should not favor giving it up
even if it were possible."
The opinion of Dr. Jordan is that one
beneficial result of football is the de
creased tendency for football men to
drink and go on sprees, and the restrain
ing influence extended to the whole
University.
In replying to the question as to
whether or not football takes up too
much time in proportion to its benefits,
Dr. Jordan commented, "In some ways
football docs take up too much time and
interest. Long trips and too many
games arc a harmful influence, and it is
certainly unwise to work the players
so hard that they cannot do their uni
versity work."
When asked the question "What
prospects are there for the future of
footmball?" Dr. Jordan evaded giving
his veiwpoint by quoting Voltaire,
"Never foretell the future, there has
never been any."
