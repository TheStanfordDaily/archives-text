Red Gill is playing his first year of varsity football for California, but it is safe to prophesy that more will be
heard from this halfback before he receives his diploma. Although Gill is not starting tomorrow's battle, he
is bound to see action before the contest has progressed long, for he is one of the most consistent ground
gainers that Nibs Price can boast about.
