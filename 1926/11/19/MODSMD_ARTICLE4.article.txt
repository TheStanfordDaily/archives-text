# MANKIND'S GODS DESCRIBED BY DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
"No man," said Dr. Jordan discussing
at his Thursday evening conference last
night, "can deny the existence of some
supreme intelligence that is the basis for
the orderliness of the universe.
"You can find out this about God: the
universe is constantly changing. Every
change is orderly; nowhere can you find
any trace of a lack of either physical or
moral order. The natural way of things
is the only way there is; but there
wouldn't be any natural way of things
unless there were some supreme intelli
genceâ€”you can call it God if you like."
Various Gods Described
Dr. Jordan traced the history of the
many ways that man has sought for God
and the multitude of different gods that
have been created.
Dr. Jordan told of the stern, revenge
ful God or Yahweh of the Hebrews and
showed how, as their civilization ad
vanced, their idea of God changed, until
it culminated in the kindly, righteous
God upon which Christianity is based.
The Greek gods and demigods, with
their petty quarrels and mortal failings,
were also discussed by Dr. Jordan. He
compared the Norwegian gods with them
by saying, "Norwegian mythology was of
a far nobler sort than that of the Greeks.
Their gods were not so engrossed in
trivial affairs as were the Greeks'."
"All through the ages and all over
the world," said Dr. Jordan, "people have
created gods to account for the things in
nature that they couldn't understand."
In commenting on the Bible as the
chief source of knowledge of the Chris
tian God, Dr. Jordan said, "There is
nothing divine about the Bible. It is just
a book written by mortal men, and it is
unfortunate that the custom has grown
up of taking the Bible literally. A great
part of the Old Testament is purely
poetry, but many people have missed that
point.
"Most of the 'miracles' are merely fig
ures of speech intended to convey the
morals of certain legends. The Book of
Job is one of the most powerful works
ever written. What is indeed remarkable
about the Bible is that it was preserved
all through the centuries when it was
necessary to write it originally by hand
on scraps of papyrus and bone and
wood."
Dr. Jordan discussed the various con
ceptions of the Devil, saying, "Some peo
ple have always considered the Devil to
be a person. A certain lady preacher in
Los Angeles promised to name the great
est liar in that city. When she said the
greatest liar in Los Angeles was the
Devil, the newspapers immediately com
mented by saying that they didn't know
the Devil was a citizen of that city."
