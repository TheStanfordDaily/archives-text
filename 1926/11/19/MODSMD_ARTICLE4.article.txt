# MANKIND'S GODS DESCRIBED BY DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
"No man," said Dr. Jordan discussing
at his Thursday evening conference last
night, "can deny the existence of some
supreme intelligence that is the basis for
the orderliness of the universe.
"You can find out this about God: the
universe is constantly changing. Every
change is orderly; nowhere can you find
any trace of a lack of either physical or
moral order. The natural way of things
is the only way there is; but there
wouldn't be any natural way of things
unless there were some supreme intelli
gence—you can call it God if you like."
Various Gods Described
Dr. Jordan traced the history of the
many ways that man has sought for God
and the multitude of different gods that
have been created.
Dr. Jordan told of the stern, revenge
ful God or Yahweh of the Hebrews and
showed how, as their civilization ad
vanced, their idea of God changed, until
it culminated in the kindly, righteous
God upon which Christianity is based.
The Greek gods and demigods, with
their petty quarrels and mortal failings,
were also discussed by Dr. Jordan. He
compared the Norwegian gods with them
