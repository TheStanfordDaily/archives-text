# WARNER TRAINED MEN ASSIST IN DEVELOPING STANFORD GRID SQUAD
## 
### 
While at Pittsburgh Pop Warner
coached two men who now have much
to do with the smooth working and
proper functioning of Stanford's line
and backfield, Tiny Thornhill, and
Chuck Winterburn.
Tiny Thornhill, who graduated from
Pittsburgh in 1916, played tackle for
three yearsâ€”l9l4, 1915, and 1916. He
then accepted the position of coach at
Center college. Stanford adopted the
Warner system under the tutelege of
Andy Kerr in 1922 so Tiny Thornhill
was appointed line coach at Stanford
where lie has remained ever since.
Winterburn, who played half and
quarter for Pittsburgh under Warner,
came out to the Pacific Coast immedi
ately following his graduation. Win
terburn coached for a while at San
Mateo Junior College and Santa Ana
High School until he was brought to
Stanford as backfield coach this season.
In the trainer's room at the gymna
sium. out on the field with the team, is
one of Warner's favorite henchmen. To
Wallace Denny goes the credit for the
splendid physical condition of the var
sity football squad.
In this line of work Denny, who is a
full blooded Indian, has been closely
associated with Pop Warner for many
years, having worked under him at Car
lisle in 1899 as trainer. Denny first met
Pop while a student at Carlisle where
he was prominent in all branches of
sports, particularly track and baseball.
Directly after graduating from Car
lisle, Wallace Denny became Warner's
assistant. In 1918 Denny had entire
charge of the track team, and four years
later came to Stanford.
