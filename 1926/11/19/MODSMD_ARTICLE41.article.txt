# SAN JOSE TEACHERS TIE YEARLING SOCCER TEAM IN FAST PLAY
## 
### 
Freshman soccer players gave way
to the offense put up by San Jose
Teachers College yesterday afternoon
after holding onto a one-point lead
half the game, and finally found them
selves tied in a 1-1 contest which was
eventually called on account of dark
ness.
A brilliant offense featuring Jen
nings, Borden, and Captain Ward
Smith took the ball down the field in
the first half of the game, and Smith
kicked the goal on a pretty pass from
Jennings at outside left.
A slump, in which the San Jose
team did most of the offense work,
followed for the 1930 eleven, and San
Jose came back to score in the mid
dle of the second period when the
babe defense finally crashed under the
weight of a heavy charge that laid
low Christensen, fullback, and carried
the Card goaltender right into his own
net.
While they had the better of the
whole game, the frosh did not play
with the same zest which character
ized their performance against the
California freshmen. The babes had
already been defeated by San Jose
earlier in the season.
