# BIG, BUSHY HAIRED COACH LEADS IOWA STATE FARMERS ROLL UP SCORE OVER NORTHWESTERN 1895 SHOWS MAKINGS OF WARNER SYSTEM
## 
### 
One September day in the fall of 1895
eleven husky young lowa farmers, led
by a big, bushy haired coach not much
older than themselves, swooped down
upon a surprised and bewildered group
of gentlemen from Northwestern uni
versity who did not recover from their
astonishment until they found them
selves at the small end of a 36 to 0
football score.
That bushy haired young coach was
Glenn Scobie Warner, fresh from Cor
nell, and that group of eleven young
giants was "Pop's" first great football
machine.
The Chicago Tribune of September
29, 1895, featured a story under the
heading. "STRUCK BY A CY
CLONE." It said:
"Northwestern might as well
have tried to play football with an
lowa cyclone as with the lowa
team it met yesterday. At the end
of fifty minutes' play the big husky
farmers from lowa's Agricultural
college had rolled up thirty-six
points, while the fifteen-yard line
was the nearest Northwestern got
to lowa's goal,"
Tt wasn't the fashion to throw bou
quets at the coaches in those days so
the former Cornell captain on the
Hawkcyes' bench was not even men
tioned in the Tribune's "story. In an
old, queer "Bomb," lowa State's year
book, which tells of the prowess of the
great team of '95 it simply says:-
"Finally financial difficulties' were
cleared away, Warner, captain of
the Cornell team of '94, was se
cured as coach, and the team re
ceived especially efficient training."
The beginnings of the great "War
ner system" can be detected, however,
in the accounts of the games played by
the "Cyclones" as the I.S.C. teams have

ever since been called.
Farther on in the story of Northwes- !
tern's rout at the hands of the visiting
agriculturalists it reads startlingly as
though it were an account from one of
today's newspapers describing the vie- 1
tory of a Warner team.
"The lowa line is one of the
heaviest in the West, running all
the way from 220 to 170. The in
terference of the team was almost
perfect, and the Northwestern men
were hurled aside at will and great
holes made, through which the
lowa backs poured. The lowa line
was so heavy it would sometimes
push the Northwcsterns before it
right down the field. Many times
when the Evanston line got so low
it could not be pushed the lowa
backs would vault right over it."
In the "Bomb" of '96 there is a pic-1
turc of the team and its coach which,
from the more modern point of view, i
resembles the photo of a lumberjacks'
reunion rather than that of a grid squad. |
1 he suits of the players arc startling in
their lack of uniformity, each man, ap
parently, suiting his own taste as to
color design and style. Each head was j
surmounted by an immense mop of fly
ing hair and on each face is a studied
i expression of sphinxlike grimness. One
' player, standing in the top row, with
folded arms, sports a full, bristling
| beard! In the back apparently the big
gest man in the group, is Warner,
easily recognizable as the same "Pop"
who lifted the Cardinal from defeat to
the heights of victory.
Young Warner stayed at Ames only
! that one season, going next year to
Cornell, but his great Cyclone team had
left its mark and had pointed the way
to a great career and incidentally some
great Stanford football machines.

parently, suiting his own taste as to

surmounted by an immense mop of fly
ing hair and on each face is a studied
i expression of sphinxlike grimness. One
' player, standing in the top row, with
folded arms, sports a full, bristling
| beard! In the back apparently the big
gest man in the group, is Warner,
easily recognizable as the same "Pop"
who lifted the Cardinal from defeat to
the heights of victory.
Young Warner stayed at Ames only
! that one season, going next year to
Cornell, but his great Cyclone team had
left its mark and had pointed the way
to a great career and incidentally some
great Stanford football machines.
One September day in the fall of 1895
eleven husky young lowa farmers, led
by a big, bushy haired coach not much
older than themselves, swooped down
upon a surprised and bewildered group
of gentlemen from Northwestern uni
versity who did not recover from their
astonishment until they found them
selves at the small end of a 36 to 0
football score.
That bushy haired young coach was
Glenn Scobie Warner, fresh from Cor
nell, and that group of eleven young
giants was "Pop's" first great football
machine.
The Chicago Tribune of September
29, 1895, featured a story under the
heading. "STRUCK BY A CY
CLONE." It said:
"Northwestern might as well
have tried to play football with an
lowa cyclone as with the lowa
team it met yesterday. At the end
of fifty minutes' play the big husky
farmers from lowa's Agricultural
college had rolled up thirty-six
points, while the fifteen-yard line
was the nearest Northwestern got
to lowa's goal,"
Tt wasn't the fashion to throw bou
quets at the coaches in those days so
the former Cornell captain on the
Hawkcyes' bench was not even men
tioned in the Tribune's "story. In an
old, queer "Bomb," lowa State's year
book, which tells of the prowess of the
great team of '95 it simply says:-
"Finally financial difficulties' were
cleared away, Warner, captain of
the Cornell team of '94, was se
cured as coach, and the team re
ceived especially efficient training."
The beginnings of the great "War
ner system" can be detected, however,
in the accounts of the games played by
the "Cyclones" as the I.S.C. teams have

ever since been called.
Farther on in the story of Northwes- !
tern's rout at the hands of the visiting
agriculturalists it reads startlingly as
though it were an account from one of
today's newspapers describing the vie- 1
tory of a Warner team.
"The lowa line is one of the
heaviest in the West, running all
the way from 220 to 170. The in
terference of the team was almost
perfect, and the Northwestern men
were hurled aside at will and great
holes made, through which the
lowa backs poured. The lowa line
was so heavy it would sometimes
push the Northwcsterns before it
right down the field. Many times
when the Evanston line got so low
it could not be pushed the lowa
backs would vault right over it."
In the "Bomb" of '96 there is a pic-1
turc of the team and its coach which,
from the more modern point of view, i
resembles the photo of a lumberjacks'
reunion rather than that of a grid squad. |
