# Denver Grid Star Keeps Trim by Carrying Mail
## 
### 
The young stalwarts who keep in
condition for football by carrying ice,
wearing fireman's hats, or smashing
baggage have nothing on a Rocky
Mountain gridiron star who sees to it
that he walks miles and miles.
A1 Panek, halfback on the Denver
i University team, is the voluntary pedes
trian. He works his way through col
lege by being a mailman.
Panek walks his mail route from six
in the morning until noon. He goes to
classes through the early afternoon and
1 sprints into the backfield late in the day.
