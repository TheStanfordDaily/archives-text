# BIG GAME IS FIRST PRICE-WARNER TILT FOR BRUINS' MENTOR
## 
### 
Berkeley, Nov. 18.â€”The Golden Bear
and the Stanford Red will take the field
in the Memorial Stadium tomorrow
with a new man to shape the destinies
of the wearers of the Blue and Gold. A
new man in the number of years of
varsity coaching experience but an old
veteran in regards to faithfulness and
service .to the university.
Clarence "Nibs" Price, varsity coach,
came to California from San Bernardino
High School in 1910. He starred in
rugby, basketball and baseball in col
lege and upon graduating in 1914 took
over the head coaching duties at San
Diego High, where his success was
phenomenal. In 1917 he entered the
air service and returned to California in
1919 to become head freshman coach.
His work with the Babe football team
caused him to be promoted to head as
sistant in 1920 to Andy Smith. Price
was appointed head basketball coach in
1925 and with a scarcity of material
turned out an aggregation that won the
Pacific Coast Conference championship,
and last year came through again with
the title.
When Andy Smith was called by
death late in the fall of 1925, Price was
considered the logical man to take his
place.
