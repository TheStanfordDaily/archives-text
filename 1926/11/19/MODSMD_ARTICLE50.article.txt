# IN 1892 ROBLE WOMEN DOUBT PROPRIETY OF ATTENDING FIRST STANFORD-CALIFORNIA CONTEST
## 
### 
The first Big Game between Stanford and California was a
different affair from that which over seventy thousand people are in
the habit of witnessing a the present time. Somewhat out of season
with modern conceptions, the first game was played on March 19, 1892.
That was because Stanford did not know what a football team locked
like in the fall of 1891.
Excitement waxed high for this first struggle with the Bears, and
after much deliberation it was decided that the game should be staged
at the Haight Ball Grounds in San Francisco.
Women Hesitate
Then there followed a great amount of hesitation in Roble Hall
as to whether it would be proper for women to attend the game.
Finally the women students of California favored the idea, and
Stanford soon followed.
On the morning of March 19 a special train left Palo Alto, carry
ing some five hundred students. The train was gaily decorated in
Stanford colors, and when it arrived at San Francisco, special cable
cars carried the crowd to the ball grounds. These cars likewise bore
decorations, and midst prolonged cheers the huge cavalcade made its
way from the depot.
The Stanford delegation made its headquarters at the Lick house
and all during the morning throngs of Stanford and California''
students filled the streets startling the San Franciscans with their
enthusiasm.
Crowd of 5,000
That afternoon about 5,000 people saw the so-called ragged Stan
ford team defeat a far more experienced California eleven by 14 to 10.
Rooting section stunts were a thing unknown in those days, but the
din that rose when the teams came on to the field had all the quality
of a modern rooting section. Fish horns and cow bells were the
popular noise makers, and many merchants advertised their wares on
horns painted in college colors.
In view of the fact that California's team outweighed the Cardi
nals ten pounds to the man and that the Berkeley school had been
playing football for ten years while Stanford was only then entering
the game, betting was three to one far a Bruin victory. When the
red team succeeded in scoring a touchdown and kicking the goal,
however, the gamblers on the sidelines shifted the odds to two to one
for Stanford's eleven. Numerous other runs of twenty and twenty
five yards aided in giving the fans their money's worth.
Use Flying Wedge
The old V-shape formation, or flying wedge, was the forte of both
teams for offensive play, but the thrilling open field runs which
delight the grid fan of today were not entirely absent. Clemens, Stan
ford fullback, brought the crowd to its feet by leaving his inter
ference, sidestepping one tackier, viciously straight-arming another,
and dashing thirty-six yards to fall over the goal line with a Cali
fornia man clutching at his ankles.
The ball grounds were a vivid display. Flags from every civilized
nation were flying as well as many college banners.
The year 1892 saw two Big Games, for early in November the
student manager of California sent the Stanford manager a tele
gram challenging the Cardinals to another football match. Stanford
accepted and the day was set for December 17.
Up to this time Stanford had had no regular coach, and soon
telegrams were flying between Stanford and Yale. As a result Walter
Camp agreed to come out and coach Stanford after he finished the
season with Yale. He arrived about three weeks before the game,
and Stanford's stock was boosted skyward. This was the first
example of importing coaches from the East.
The second Big Game was a mammoth affair, and drew a crowd
of over 8,000. It ended in a 10 to 10 tie, but Stanford still retained
the championship. That was in the days before the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Only Five Cops
People marveled that it took only five policemen to keep the
crowd in order. Profiting by last game's experience, a high picket
fence, rimmed with barbed wire, was erected around the field to keep
spectators from interfering with the game as had been done before.
The evening after the game saw a rather unique way of celebrat
ing. It became the custom for the Stanford student body to buy out
the Stockwell theater, and thus wind up the glorious day with a
theater party. The California supporters did the same, but to prevent
6erious difficulties they bought out a different theater.
When the Big Game in 1894 attracted a crowd of over 10,000,
people stood aghast, wondering what the world was coming to when
such a multitude should take an interest in an athletic event. The
several thousand dollar gate was an astounding figure.

popular noise makers, and many merchants advertised their wares on
horns painted in college colors.
In view of the fact that California's team outweighed the Cardi
nals ten pounds to the man and that the Berkeley school had been
playing football for ten years while Stanford was only then entering
the game, betting was three to one far a Bruin victory. When the
red team succeeded in scoring a touchdown and kicking the goal,
however, the gamblers on the sidelines shifted the odds to two to one
for Stanford's eleven. Numerous other runs of twenty and twenty
five yards aided in giving the fans their money's worth.
Use Flying Wedge
The old V-shape formation, or flying wedge, was the forte of both
teams for offensive play, but the thrilling open field runs which
delight the grid fan of today were not entirely absent. Clemens, Stan
ford fullback, brought the crowd to its feet by leaving his inter
ference, sidestepping one tackier, viciously straight-arming another,
and dashing thirty-six yards to fall over the goal line with a Cali
fornia man clutching at his ankles.
The ball grounds were a vivid display. Flags from every civilized
nation were flying as well as many college banners.
The year 1892 saw two Big Games, for early in November the
student manager of California sent the Stanford manager a tele
gram challenging the Cardinals to another football match. Stanford
accepted and the day was set for December 17.
Up to this time Stanford had had no regular coach, and soon
telegrams were flying between Stanford and Yale. As a result Walter
Camp agreed to come out and coach Stanford after he finished the
season with Yale. He arrived about three weeks before the game,
and Stanford's stock was boosted skyward. This was the first
example of importing coaches from the East.
The second Big Game was a mammoth affair, and drew a crowd
of over 8,000. It ended in a 10 to 10 tie, but Stanford still retained
the championship. That was in the days before the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Only Five Cops
People marveled that it took only five policemen to keep the
crowd in order. Profiting by last game's experience, a high picket
fence, rimmed with barbed wire, was erected around the field to keep
spectators from interfering with the game as had been done before.
The evening after the game saw a rather unique way of celebrat
ing. It became the custom for the Stanford student body to buy out
the Stockwell theater, and thus wind up the glorious day with a
theater party. The California supporters did the same, but to prevent
6erious difficulties they bought out a different theater.
When the Big Game in 1894 attracted a crowd of over 10,000,
people stood aghast, wondering what the world was coming to when
such a multitude should take an interest in an athletic event. The
several thousand dollar gate was an astounding figure.
The first Big Game between Stanford and California was a
different affair from that which over seventy thousand people are in
the habit of witnessing a the present time. Somewhat out of season
with modern conceptions, the first game was played on March 19, 1892.
That was because Stanford did not know what a football team locked
like in the fall of 1891.
Excitement waxed high for this first struggle with the Bears, and
after much deliberation it was decided that the game should be staged
at the Haight Ball Grounds in San Francisco.
Women Hesitate
Then there followed a great amount of hesitation in Roble Hall
as to whether it would be proper for women to attend the game.
Finally the women students of California favored the idea, and
Stanford soon followed.
On the morning of March 19 a special train left Palo Alto, carry
ing some five hundred students. The train was gaily decorated in
Stanford colors, and when it arrived at San Francisco, special cable
cars carried the crowd to the ball grounds. These cars likewise bore
decorations, and midst prolonged cheers the huge cavalcade made its
way from the depot.
The Stanford delegation made its headquarters at the Lick house
and all during the morning throngs of Stanford and California''
students filled the streets startling the San Franciscans with their
enthusiasm.
Crowd of 5,000
That afternoon about 5,000 people saw the so-called ragged Stan
ford team defeat a far more experienced California eleven by 14 to 10.
Rooting section stunts were a thing unknown in those days, but the
din that rose when the teams came on to the field had all the quality
of a modern rooting section. Fish horns and cow bells were the
popular noise makers, and many merchants advertised their wares on

and Stanford's stock was boosted skyward. This was the first
example of importing coaches from the East.
The second Big Game was a mammoth affair, and drew a crowd
of over 8,000. It ended in a 10 to 10 tie, but Stanford still retained
the championship. That was in the days before the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Only Five Cops
People marveled that it took only five policemen to keep the
crowd in order. Profiting by last game's experience, a high picket
fence, rimmed with barbed wire, was erected around the field to keep
spectators from interfering with the game as had been done before.
The evening after the game saw a rather unique way of celebrat
ing. It became the custom for the Stanford student body to buy out
the Stockwell theater, and thus wind up the glorious day with a
theater party. The California supporters did the same, but to prevent
6erious difficulties they bought out a different theater.
When the Big Game in 1894 attracted a crowd of over 10,000,
people stood aghast, wondering what the world was coming to when
such a multitude should take an interest in an athletic event. The
several thousand dollar gate was an astounding figure.
