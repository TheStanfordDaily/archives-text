# SIX COAST TEAMS BATTLE FOR RATING
## 
### 
Two "big games" and one other conference contest hold
the center of the stage in the Pacific Coast Conference
football race tomorrow afternoon.
The biggest of the "big games," of course, is the Stan
ford-California struggle in the Memorial Stadium at Berke
ley and the other is the annual Oregon-O.A.C. meeting at
Corvallis. Idaho travels to Los Angeles to clash with U.S.C.
in the other attraction billed for the day.
The most important of the three is the Stanford-Cali
fornia game, not only because it is the Pacific Coast's major
battle each year, but also because it will, this season, decide
whether the Cardinals win the championship. Being the
only unbeaten eleven in the conference, Pop Warner's
aggregation, by taking the hide of the Goloen Bear, can
cinch the honors.
. Stanford Is Favored
And take that hide the Redshirts should, for the Bruins
have not won a conference game this year, losing to three
teams Stanford has beaten. The experts expect the Stanford
men to win by a three or four touchdown margin and, while
any team is dangerous, the Bears appear to possess as little
danger as is possible.
The Oregon-O.A.C. game this year will be one of the
best games seen in the Northwest. The Aggies, until about
a week ago, were threatening Stanford's hold on first place,
while Oregon has won only one conference game. This
should give the Orangemen a wide margin over the Lemon
Yellow, but it docs not.
Aggies Are Slipping
The Aggies seem to have reached their heights and arc
now on the downward grade. They started slipping when
they allowed Idaho to hold them to a 3 to 0 score, and
then dropped deeper by losing to U.S.C. 17 to 7.
Oregon, on the other hand, has been improving steadily
under its new coach, Captain John J. McEwan, and offers a
real challenge to what looked like an easy Aggie victory
early in the season. Captain McEwan has been holding back
for this game, and tomorrow afternoon he will open wide
the bag of tricks he brought with him from West Point
in an effort to down O.A.C.
After defeating California three weeks ago McEwan
started pointing for tomorrow's game. He gave very little
thought to the W.S.C. contest, expecting to lose it, and spent

all his time drilling the Webfeet for the Aggie fray.
The Ags have had a hard season, which, coupled with the
fact that they reached their mid-season form too soon,
leaves them none too strong for the Oregon invasion. One
hour after the Oregon game the Beavers leave for Milwau
kee to meet Marquette on Thanksgiving Day.
U.S.C. Favored
U.S.C. is favored to win over Idaho, mainly because the
Trojans are regarded as the second strongest team on the
coast while the Vandals have no outstanding claim to fame.
They have made good fights in all their games, though, and
may surprise Southern California fans to some extent.
Idaho held the Oregon Aggies to a lone field goal, actu
ally outplaying the Oregonians during the major part of the
afternoon. The next week they dropped a contest to W.S.C.
by a 6 to 0 score due to the fact that they had not had
time to recover from the hard fight they put up against the
Aggies. Charley Erb, in his first year as coach at Idaho,
lias made a real aggregation of fighters, but it is very doubt
fid if they will be able to stop the Thundering Herd's
running and passing attack.
U.S.C., then, holds a decided advantage, as does Stan
ford in its game. The Oregon-O.A.C. game is about a toss
up, with the Lemon Yellow conceded an excellent chance to
turn in a victory.
Season Closing
With the exception of one more game the Pacific
Coast Conference closes the 1926 season tomorrow. The
one remaining contest is on Thanksgiving Day at the
Univcrstiy of Montana, when the University of Southern
California Trojans meet Montana. This game will have
little bearing on the Coast standing unless Stanford loses
to California. But should California be victorious, and
U.S.C. beat Idaho tomorrow, the southern university
would probably be the winner for the year, because of the
six conference matches that the Trojans will have played.
Last year Washington won the conference without
losing a game, but this year the Huskies have met defeat
twice. Last season Stanford took second in the confer
ence suffering one defeat, and that at the hands of the
Washington eleven in Seattle. California lost to both
Washington and Stanford in 1925, while this year the
Bears have been defeated in every conference match.

Corvallis. Idaho travels to Los Angeles to clash with U.S.C.
in the other attraction billed for the day.
The most important of the three is the Stanford-Cali
fornia game, not only because it is the Pacific Coast's major
battle each year, but also because it will, this season, decide
whether the Cardinals win the championship. Being the
only unbeaten eleven in the conference, Pop Warner's
aggregation, by taking the hide of the Goloen Bear, can
cinch the honors.
. Stanford Is Favored
And take that hide the Redshirts should, for the Bruins
have not won a conference game this year, losing to three
teams Stanford has beaten. The experts expect the Stanford
men to win by a three or four touchdown margin and, while
any team is dangerous, the Bears appear to possess as little
danger as is possible.
The Oregon-O.A.C. game this year will be one of the
best games seen in the Northwest. The Aggies, until about
a week ago, were threatening Stanford's hold on first place,
while Oregon has won only one conference game. This
should give the Orangemen a wide margin over the Lemon
Yellow, but it docs not.
Aggies Are Slipping
The Aggies seem to have reached their heights and arc
now on the downward grade. They started slipping when
they allowed Idaho to hold them to a 3 to 0 score, and
then dropped deeper by losing to U.S.C. 17 to 7.
Oregon, on the other hand, has been improving steadily
under its new coach, Captain John J. McEwan, and offers a
real challenge to what looked like an easy Aggie victory
early in the season. Captain McEwan has been holding back
for this game, and tomorrow afternoon he will open wide
the bag of tricks he brought with him from West Point
in an effort to down O.A.C.
After defeating California three weeks ago McEwan
started pointing for tomorrow's game. He gave very little
thought to the W.S.C. contest, expecting to lose it, and spent

all his time drilling the Webfeet for the Aggie fray.
The Ags have had a hard season, which, coupled with the
fact that they reached their mid-season form too soon,
leaves them none too strong for the Oregon invasion. One
hour after the Oregon game the Beavers leave for Milwau
kee to meet Marquette on Thanksgiving Day.
U.S.C. Favored
U.S.C. is favored to win over Idaho, mainly because the
Trojans are regarded as the second strongest team on the
coast while the Vandals have no outstanding claim to fame.
They have made good fights in all their games, though, and
may surprise Southern California fans to some extent.
Idaho held the Oregon Aggies to a lone field goal, actu
ally outplaying the Oregonians during the major part of the
afternoon. The next week they dropped a contest to W.S.C.
by a 6 to 0 score due to the fact that they had not had
time to recover from the hard fight they put up against the
Aggies. Charley Erb, in his first year as coach at Idaho,
lias made a real aggregation of fighters, but it is very doubt
fid if they will be able to stop the Thundering Herd's
running and passing attack.
U.S.C., then, holds a decided advantage, as does Stan
ford in its game. The Oregon-O.A.C. game is about a toss
up, with the Lemon Yellow conceded an excellent chance to
turn in a victory.
Season Closing
With the exception of one more game the Pacific
Coast Conference closes the 1926 season tomorrow. The
one remaining contest is on Thanksgiving Day at the
Univcrstiy of Montana, when the University of Southern
California Trojans meet Montana. This game will have
little bearing on the Coast standing unless Stanford loses
to California. But should California be victorious, and
U.S.C. beat Idaho tomorrow, the southern university
would probably be the winner for the year, because of the
six conference matches that the Trojans will have played.
Last year Washington won the conference without
losing a game, but this year the Huskies have met defeat
twice. Last season Stanford took second in the confer
ence suffering one defeat, and that at the hands of the
Washington eleven in Seattle. California lost to both
Washington and Stanford in 1925, while this year the
Bears have been defeated in every conference match.
Two "big games" and one other conference contest hold
the center of the stage in the Pacific Coast Conference
football race tomorrow afternoon.
The biggest of the "big games," of course, is the Stan
ford-California struggle in the Memorial Stadium at Berke
ley and the other is the annual Oregon-O.A.C. meeting at

battle each year, but also because it will, this season, decide
whether the Cardinals win the championship. Being the
only unbeaten eleven in the conference, Pop Warner's
aggregation, by taking the hide of the Goloen Bear, can
cinch the honors.
. Stanford Is Favored
And take that hide the Redshirts should, for the Bruins
have not won a conference game this year, losing to three
teams Stanford has beaten. The experts expect the Stanford
men to win by a three or four touchdown margin and, while
any team is dangerous, the Bears appear to possess as little
danger as is possible.
The Oregon-O.A.C. game this year will be one of the
best games seen in the Northwest. The Aggies, until about
a week ago, were threatening Stanford's hold on first place,
while Oregon has won only one conference game. This
should give the Orangemen a wide margin over the Lemon
Yellow, but it docs not.
Aggies Are Slipping
The Aggies seem to have reached their heights and arc
now on the downward grade. They started slipping when
they allowed Idaho to hold them to a 3 to 0 score, and
then dropped deeper by losing to U.S.C. 17 to 7.
Oregon, on the other hand, has been improving steadily
under its new coach, Captain John J. McEwan, and offers a
real challenge to what looked like an easy Aggie victory
early in the season. Captain McEwan has been holding back
for this game, and tomorrow afternoon he will open wide
the bag of tricks he brought with him from West Point
in an effort to down O.A.C.
After defeating California three weeks ago McEwan
started pointing for tomorrow's game. He gave very little
thought to the W.S.C. contest, expecting to lose it, and spent

all his time drilling the Webfeet for the Aggie fray.
The Ags have had a hard season, which, coupled with the
fact that they reached their mid-season form too soon,
leaves them none too strong for the Oregon invasion. One
hour after the Oregon game the Beavers leave for Milwau
kee to meet Marquette on Thanksgiving Day.
U.S.C. Favored
U.S.C. is favored to win over Idaho, mainly because the
Trojans are regarded as the second strongest team on the
coast while the Vandals have no outstanding claim to fame.
They have made good fights in all their games, though, and
may surprise Southern California fans to some extent.
Idaho held the Oregon Aggies to a lone field goal, actu
ally outplaying the Oregonians during the major part of the
afternoon. The next week they dropped a contest to W.S.C.
by a 6 to 0 score due to the fact that they had not had
time to recover from the hard fight they put up against the
Aggies. Charley Erb, in his first year as coach at Idaho,
lias made a real aggregation of fighters, but it is very doubt
fid if they will be able to stop the Thundering Herd's
running and passing attack.
U.S.C., then, holds a decided advantage, as does Stan
ford in its game. The Oregon-O.A.C. game is about a toss
up, with the Lemon Yellow conceded an excellent chance to
turn in a victory.
Season Closing
With the exception of one more game the Pacific
Coast Conference closes the 1926 season tomorrow. The
one remaining contest is on Thanksgiving Day at the
Univcrstiy of Montana, when the University of Southern
California Trojans meet Montana. This game will have
little bearing on the Coast standing unless Stanford loses
to California. But should California be victorious, and
U.S.C. beat Idaho tomorrow, the southern university
would probably be the winner for the year, because of the
six conference matches that the Trojans will have played.
Last year Washington won the conference without
losing a game, but this year the Huskies have met defeat
twice. Last season Stanford took second in the confer
ence suffering one defeat, and that at the hands of the
Washington eleven in Seattle. California lost to both
Washington and Stanford in 1925, while this year the
Bears have been defeated in every conference match.
