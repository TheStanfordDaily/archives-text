# TEN PLACE-WINNERS IN BIG MEET MISSING FROM TRACK VARSITY
## Templeton Must Find Men To Fill Loss in Middle Distances 
### 
Ten point-winners in last year's Bigj
Meet will be missing when Coach Dink j
Tcmpleton's varsity track squad ap- j
pears on the Stanford oval this spring.;
Of this number, four won first places in
the annual struggle with California. Six
of last year's graduating stars were
high-lights on the track, and the other
four performed in the field events.
To counter-balance the loss of these
ten men the Stanford coach has a num
ber of the members of the 1926 varsity
still on hand, and this bunch will be
further strengthened by the addition of
a fairly promising squad from the 1929
freshman team.
Richardson's Loss Felt
Captain Hill Richardson's loss in the
half-mile will be keenly felt this year.
Alex McKinnon, frosh captain, Carl
smith, and Clum, are the only promis
ing men out for the 880-yard event. Tn
the quarter mile, Captain Larry Bab
cock is the only one left of the famous
trio of Miller, Story, and Babcock, who
turned in nine points for the Cardinals
in nearly every meet last year. Spen
cer, varsity hurdler, and Dales and
Moss of the freshman team, will be the
new men out for the quarter this year.
Stanford lost two men in the sprints,
Louie Gasper and Erk Coverly. Dick
Hyland and Wilbur Adams are ex
pected to make strong bids this year, as
are S> r er and Berry of the 1929 team.
In case the varsity sprinters fail to
come up to standard, it is probable that
Clarence West, star hurdler, and Fred
Zombro, freshman broad jumper, will
try out in the century and 220.
One Varsity Miler
The loss of Bill Kerr through gradu
ation leaves only one varsity miler on
hand, Ranney. Bod Gooden, freshman
four-lap star, is the only promising new
runner on the squad. Ted Criley, who
turned in such a game race in the two
mile event last year in the Big Meet,
will be the strongest bet in the eight
lap race this season.
Stanford seems to be plentifully sup
plied with fast hurdlers. Clarence West
and Ross Nichols, star runners in both
barrier events, should prove unbeatable
this year. Don Nelson, double place
winner in the frosh meet last spring is
another timber topper certain to make
a strong bid for a place on the team.
Strong in Field Events
In the field events, Stanford appears
to be especially strong. The weight
events in particular look to be sure
winners for the Cardinals. Biff Hoff
man, star weight tosser will be on hand
again this year, as will Taffy Evans,
whose intramural discus record of 145
feet rates him as a place winner. Herb
Fleishhacker, A1 Forstcr, and Ray
Tandy, of the freshman team, should
all make a place for themselves on the
.varsity. Richards is the only weight
thrower not to return this year.
In the broad jump, Templeton has
three men likely to place in any compe
tition. Sid Meeks, whose jump of 24
feet 1 inch made in the P.C.C. meet
last year, is the best mark ever turned
in by a Stanford jumper, will serve his
third year on the varsity this season.
John Lauritzen, a promising freshman,
and Fred Zombro, another 1929 star
jumper, are the best prospects among
the new jumpers. Dick Mcßae is the
only varsity broad jumper lost by
graduation.
Star High Jumpers
Stanford still has her two star high
jumpers on the team this year. Bob
King, intercollegiate champion, and
Tom Work, P.C.C. champion, are good
enough to take first and second in any j
meet. In the pole vault, Chet Ross will j
be missed, but Walt Hulsinan and |
Mainwaring from the freshman squad!
arc a couple of potential place winners.
While the loss of Chuck Harlow will
be noticeably felt, there are several jave
lin throwers that are good enough to
make a number of points for the Cardi
nals in this event. Ted Shipkey and
Tom Joaquin, of last year's squad, and
Bill Sparling and Goodccll of the frosh
team, will form a hard bunch of athletes
to beat in the spear tossing event.
Sparling is the most promising of the
new throwers, and is good for over 175
feet at any time.
Relay Quartet Gone
Stanford will be represented by only
on« of the famous record-breaking
quartet of relay runners this year. Cap
tain Babcock is the only one lap artist
remaining from the unbeatable team of

Miller, Richardson, Story, and Bab
cock. A few promising relay men, Mc-
Guire, Dales, McKinnon, and Clum,
arc the runners cxpected to step into
tlie vacated places left by the graduat
ing relay stars.

to be especially strong. The weight
events in particular look to be sure
winners for the Cardinals. Biff Hoff
man, star weight tosser will be on hand
again this year, as will Taffy Evans,
whose intramural discus record of 145
feet rates him as a place winner. Herb
Fleishhacker, A1 Forstcr, and Ray
Tandy, of the freshman team, should
all make a place for themselves on the
.varsity. Richards is the only weight
thrower not to return this year.
In the broad jump, Templeton has
three men likely to place in any compe
tition. Sid Meeks, whose jump of 24
feet 1 inch made in the P.C.C. meet
last year, is the best mark ever turned
in by a Stanford jumper, will serve his
third year on the varsity this season.
John Lauritzen, a promising freshman,
and Fred Zombro, another 1929 star
jumper, are the best prospects among
the new jumpers. Dick Mcßae is the
only varsity broad jumper lost by
graduation.
Star High Jumpers
Stanford still has her two star high
jumpers on the team this year. Bob
King, intercollegiate champion, and
Tom Work, P.C.C. champion, are good
enough to take first and second in any j
meet. In the pole vault, Chet Ross will j
be missed, but Walt Hulsinan and |
Mainwaring from the freshman squad!
arc a couple of potential place winners.
While the loss of Chuck Harlow will
be noticeably felt, there are several jave
lin throwers that are good enough to
make a number of points for the Cardi
nals in this event. Ted Shipkey and
Tom Joaquin, of last year's squad, and
Bill Sparling and Goodccll of the frosh
team, will form a hard bunch of athletes
to beat in the spear tossing event.
Sparling is the most promising of the
new throwers, and is good for over 175
feet at any time.
Relay Quartet Gone
Stanford will be represented by only
on« of the famous record-breaking
quartet of relay runners this year. Cap
tain Babcock is the only one lap artist
remaining from the unbeatable team of

Miller, Richardson, Story, and Bab
cock. A few promising relay men, Mc-
Guire, Dales, McKinnon, and Clum,
arc the runners cxpected to step into
tlie vacated places left by the graduat
ing relay stars.
Ten point-winners in last year's Bigj
Meet will be missing when Coach Dink j
Tcmpleton's varsity track squad ap- j
pears on the Stanford oval this spring.;
Of this number, four won first places in
the annual struggle with California. Six
of last year's graduating stars were
high-lights on the track, and the other
four performed in the field events.
To counter-balance the loss of these
ten men the Stanford coach has a num
ber of the members of the 1926 varsity
still on hand, and this bunch will be
further strengthened by the addition of
a fairly promising squad from the 1929
freshman team.
Richardson's Loss Felt
Captain Hill Richardson's loss in the
half-mile will be keenly felt this year.
Alex McKinnon, frosh captain, Carl
smith, and Clum, are the only promis
ing men out for the 880-yard event. Tn
the quarter mile, Captain Larry Bab
cock is the only one left of the famous
trio of Miller, Story, and Babcock, who
turned in nine points for the Cardinals
in nearly every meet last year. Spen
cer, varsity hurdler, and Dales and
Moss of the freshman team, will be the
new men out for the quarter this year.
Stanford lost two men in the sprints,
Louie Gasper and Erk Coverly. Dick
Hyland and Wilbur Adams are ex
pected to make strong bids this year, as
are S> r er and Berry of the 1929 team.
In case the varsity sprinters fail to
come up to standard, it is probable that
Clarence West, star hurdler, and Fred
Zombro, freshman broad jumper, will
try out in the century and 220.
One Varsity Miler
The loss of Bill Kerr through gradu
ation leaves only one varsity miler on
hand, Ranney. Bod Gooden, freshman
four-lap star, is the only promising new
runner on the squad. Ted Criley, who
turned in such a game race in the two
mile event last year in the Big Meet,
will be the strongest bet in the eight
lap race this season.
Stanford seems to be plentifully sup
plied with fast hurdlers. Clarence West
and Ross Nichols, star runners in both
barrier events, should prove unbeatable
this year. Don Nelson, double place
winner in the frosh meet last spring is
another timber topper certain to make
a strong bid for a place on the team.

pears on the Stanford oval this spring.;
Of this number, four won first places in
the annual struggle with California. Six
of last year's graduating stars were
high-lights on the track, and the other
four performed in the field events.
To counter-balance the loss of these
ten men the Stanford coach has a num
ber of the members of the 1926 varsity
still on hand, and this bunch will be
further strengthened by the addition of
a fairly promising squad from the 1929
freshman team.
Richardson's Loss Felt
Captain Hill Richardson's loss in the
half-mile will be keenly felt this year.
Alex McKinnon, frosh captain, Carl
smith, and Clum, are the only promis
ing men out for the 880-yard event. Tn
the quarter mile, Captain Larry Bab
cock is the only one left of the famous
trio of Miller, Story, and Babcock, who
turned in nine points for the Cardinals
in nearly every meet last year. Spen
cer, varsity hurdler, and Dales and
Moss of the freshman team, will be the
new men out for the quarter this year.
Stanford lost two men in the sprints,
Louie Gasper and Erk Coverly. Dick
Hyland and Wilbur Adams are ex
pected to make strong bids this year, as
are S> r er and Berry of the 1929 team.
In case the varsity sprinters fail to
come up to standard, it is probable that
Clarence West, star hurdler, and Fred
Zombro, freshman broad jumper, will
try out in the century and 220.
One Varsity Miler
The loss of Bill Kerr through gradu
ation leaves only one varsity miler on
hand, Ranney. Bod Gooden, freshman
four-lap star, is the only promising new
runner on the squad. Ted Criley, who
turned in such a game race in the two
mile event last year in the Big Meet,
will be the strongest bet in the eight
lap race this season.
Stanford seems to be plentifully sup
plied with fast hurdlers. Clarence West
and Ross Nichols, star runners in both
barrier events, should prove unbeatable
this year. Don Nelson, double place
winner in the frosh meet last spring is
another timber topper certain to make
a strong bid for a place on the team.
Strong in Field Events
In the field events, Stanford appears
to be especially strong. The weight
events in particular look to be sure
winners for the Cardinals. Biff Hoff
man, star weight tosser will be on hand
again this year, as will Taffy Evans,
whose intramural discus record of 145
feet rates him as a place winner. Herb
Fleishhacker, A1 Forstcr, and Ray
Tandy, of the freshman team, should
all make a place for themselves on the
.varsity. Richards is the only weight
thrower not to return this year.
In the broad jump, Templeton has
three men likely to place in any compe
tition. Sid Meeks, whose jump of 24
feet 1 inch made in the P.C.C. meet
last year, is the best mark ever turned
in by a Stanford jumper, will serve his
third year on the varsity this season.
John Lauritzen, a promising freshman,
and Fred Zombro, another 1929 star
jumper, are the best prospects among
the new jumpers. Dick Mcßae is the
only varsity broad jumper lost by
graduation.
Star High Jumpers
Stanford still has her two star high
jumpers on the team this year. Bob
King, intercollegiate champion, and
Tom Work, P.C.C. champion, are good
enough to take first and second in any j
meet. In the pole vault, Chet Ross will j
be missed, but Walt Hulsinan and |
Mainwaring from the freshman squad!
arc a couple of potential place winners.
While the loss of Chuck Harlow will
be noticeably felt, there are several jave
lin throwers that are good enough to
make a number of points for the Cardi
nals in this event. Ted Shipkey and
Tom Joaquin, of last year's squad, and
Bill Sparling and Goodccll of the frosh
team, will form a hard bunch of athletes
to beat in the spear tossing event.
Sparling is the most promising of the
new throwers, and is good for over 175
feet at any time.
Relay Quartet Gone
Stanford will be represented by only
on« of the famous record-breaking
quartet of relay runners this year. Cap
tain Babcock is the only one lap artist
remaining from the unbeatable team of

Miller, Richardson, Story, and Bab
cock. A few promising relay men, Mc-
Guire, Dales, McKinnon, and Clum,
arc the runners cxpected to step into
tlie vacated places left by the graduat
ing relay stars.
