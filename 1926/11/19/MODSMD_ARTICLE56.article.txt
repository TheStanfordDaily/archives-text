# GOOF FOOTBALL MEN DISPLAY GOOD BRAND OF BALL THIS YEAR
## Stanford Grays Play Well Despite Great Lack Of Competition 
### 
Handicapped by lack of competition,
but displaying a better brand of foot
ball than goof teams of previous years,
the Stanford Grays, coached by Hal
Davis, afforded an opportunity for
nearly fifty men to gain experience
this year which should be of value in
the formation of varsities of future
seasons.
Only two games were played, one in
which the Cards downed the St.
Mary's reserves 26 to 6 and the other
which, was won by the California re
serves, 20 to 6. Scrimmage was held
with the varsity and freshman elevens
throughout the season, though, provid
ing practice for these teams and giving
the goof players plenty of defensive
experience.
Davis Uses Subs
Of the fifty-two men who reported to
Davis October 1 for the first practice,
forty-five remained out the entire sea
son, and all were given an opportunity
at some time or another to show their
ability in the lineup, either in scrim
mage games with the varsity or in the
two outside encounters. Davis used
all but two men in the St. Mary's
game, and used twenty-five in the Cali
fornia game, thereby carrying out the
original purpose of the Grays, which
is to furnish experience for as many
men as possible.
Several members of the team this
year look good as varsity prospects for
next season. Probably the two out
standing men were Stein and Reyn
olds, tackls. Stein is a transfer from
California Tech where he made a great
record two years ago in the same posi
tion. Both of these men are heavy,
fast charging linemen and should give
Freeman and Sellman a battle for the
varsity tackle berths next year.
Guards Strong
Macabee and Youd were Davis' best
men in the guard positions this sea
son, and the former, especiallv, should
make the varsity squad in 1927. Reh
rig, Montgomery, and Guthrie showed
plenty of ability as ends, and Cook and
Ornenwpeer, the latter a transfer from
: Occidental, were Davis' best renters
| "Rudy" Reese was the outstanding
backfield man, displaying much ability
as a ball carrier on several occasions
and always playing a heady defensive
game as well. In the St. Mary's game
he provided the big thrill of the day
with a 98-yard run to a touchdown on
the kickoff.
Goodcell Plays Quarter
Burton at fullback, ami Crarv at half
both played good football and their
lack of weight is the only thing that
may keep them off the varsity squad.
Goodcell, at quarter, is of good weight
and showed good judgment in direct
ing the Grays this year. With a little
more experience he ought to make
good varsity material. Wolfe needs
only to improve his defense to become
a halfback of varsity squad caliber.

this year are: E. Antonell, P. Bald
win, A. Beeson, F. Bentzien, C. Baxter
L. Brandt, J. Burton, O. Campbell, L.
