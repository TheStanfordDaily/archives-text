# ARE YOU DRIVING TO THE FOOTBALL GAME ?

### 
The map below was prepared by the California State Automobile Association. It shows the automobile routes in the bay district leading to the California Memorial
Stadium and the main arteries in the Eastbay district and Berkeley over which traffic will be directed to parking space tomorrow for the football game between Stan
ford and California. All main routes into Berkeley have been specially signposted by the Automobile Association and a system of colored arrows corresponding to the
colors of the Big Game tickets covers Oakland and Berkeley thoroughfares for the guidance of autoists. (The shortcut from Mountain View to Alviso was recently paved.)
