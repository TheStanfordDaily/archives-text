# RALLY COMMITTEE ISSUES RULES FOR BIG GAME ROOTERS
## 
### 
With seven colors to be used
in the variety of stunts by the
Stanford rooting section in the
Big Game tomorrow, complete
conformity to the rules is neces
sary to insure the success of the
events, according to the Rally
Committee which urges that the
following instructions be com
pletely complied with in conduct
Saturday. They are as follows:
1. White shirts, bow ties, and
rooters's caps will be required of
all rooters.
2. Those holding rooters' tick
ets should be in their seats by 2
o'clock at the latest, as a group
of card stunts are to be given
before the game starts.
Twenty-three hundred seats
are being reserved for the root
ers, a section just twice the size
of that of the Washington game
last Saturday. Rooters will be
seated in the order of their ar
rival, top rows being filled first.
