# CAPTAIN FRED SWAN HAS PERFECT RECORD IN BEAR COMPETITION
## 
### 
Captain Fred Swan will enter the Big
Game tomorrow with a collegiate foot
hall record worthy of the envy of any
Stanford gridiron captain, hi his three
years of competition for the Cardinals,
as the freshman captain the first season,
and first-string guard the next two,
Stanford teams have not lost a game to
California.
He was elected to lead the freshmen
of the class of 1927 into the Bear Club
game in 1923, which was won 12 to 0.
The game was hard fought with Earl
Jabs, now playing fullback on the
Berkeley team, as the California threat.
The varsity of the following year, the
first that "Pop" Warner coached, saw
Swan down in his corner at left guard
on the team that lost its only game to
Notre Dajne in the contest in Pasadena
on January 1, 1925. The California
game was not won that year, but Stan
ford came through in an uphill battle to
tie the Bears in the last quarter, 20 to 20.
In the 1925 season, while the Cardi
nals didn't win the Conference cham
pionship, losing to Washington 13 to 0,
they trimmed California in the Stadium,
27 to 14, after which Swan was elected
captain fo rthis year.
His chances look good to come
through tomorrow's game with another
win against the rival, California, and if
such is the case, he will have finished
his career with a clean slate.
