# BASEBALL PROSPECTS GOOD; LETTER MEN RETURN TO POSITIONS
## Wolter Expects Strong Nine To Represent Stanford This Year 
### 
With only four letter men lost to
the varsity baseball team through
graduation, Coach Harry Wolter ex
pects to have one of the strongest
nines in Stanford history this year.
The loss of these four players, two of
them regulars, will not be felt very
keenly as there is a wealth of prom
ising material on hand to fill the va
cated positions.
The pitching staff seems to be the
strongest in years. Captain Steve Col
lins, John Sobieski, and Bob Philippi,
all twirlers of experience, should turn
in a number of winning performances
this season. Lewis and Kern, from
the trnahmav tmm, add further power
to the Cardinals' pitching staff. Cook
Sypher, regular varsity catcher, com
pletes the Stanford battery. Brown,
the 1929 receiver, and the best hitter
on the yearling nine, is a good catcher,
and should be a capable substitute for
Sypher.
Cuddeback Gone.
Last year's captain, Murray Cudde
back, is the only regular infielder lost
through graduation. Chuck Johnston,
varsity first baseman, is also gone this
year, but Bill Maguire held down the
first sack in a commendable manner
most of last season, so the former
Cardinal captain's place is well filled.
Neil Miller, a transfer, is eligible for
the varsity this year, and should make
a strong bid for tne first base job.
Don Garibaldi will probably retain
his second base berth with little op
position. Hartley, the 1929 second
baseman, should make a good under
study for Garibaldi. Jim Busch, whose
work around shortstop was a feature
of nearly every game last spring,
seems to be a cinch for his job again
this year. John Rogers, freshman
short fielder, is one of the best of the
new candidates, and he may get a
chance to show his ability this year.
Cuddeback's graduation leaves the
third sack position open, although Bill
Clark, regular left fielder, may be
shifted to Cuddeback's place. Harder,
freshman third sacker, may also get a
chance.
Outfield Intact
Coach Wolter's sophomore outfield
will probably hold the three garden
positions again this year. Bill Clark,
Weaver, and Gene Nisson, played
faultless ball last seasou, and with
Gerry Stewart, and Bob Sims as alter
nates, formed a very smooth-working
combination. Dick McKee, freshman
left fielder, is the only 1929 player
likely to have a chance in the outfield
this year.
Wolter's men are also good hitters.
Sypher, Maguire, Nisson, and Clark
are batsmen that can nearly always be
depended upon to deliver in the
pinches.

will probably hold the three garden
positions again this year. Bill Clark,
Weaver, and Gene Nisson, played
faultless ball last seasou, and with
Gerry Stewart, and Bob Sims as alter
nates, formed a very smooth-working
combination. Dick McKee, freshman
left fielder, is the only 1929 player
likely to have a chance in the outfield
this year.
Wolter's men are also good hitters.
Sypher, Maguire, Nisson, and Clark
are batsmen that can nearly always be
depended upon to deliver in the
pinches.
With only four letter men lost to
the varsity baseball team through
graduation, Coach Harry Wolter ex
pects to have one of the strongest
nines in Stanford history this year.
The loss of these four players, two of
them regulars, will not be felt very
keenly as there is a wealth of prom
ising material on hand to fill the va
cated positions.
The pitching staff seems to be the
strongest in years. Captain Steve Col
lins, John Sobieski, and Bob Philippi,
all twirlers of experience, should turn
in a number of winning performances
this season. Lewis and Kern, from
the trnahmav tmm, add further power
to the Cardinals' pitching staff. Cook
Sypher, regular varsity catcher, com
pletes the Stanford battery. Brown,
the 1929 receiver, and the best hitter
on the yearling nine, is a good catcher,
and should be a capable substitute for
Sypher.
Cuddeback Gone.
Last year's captain, Murray Cudde
back, is the only regular infielder lost
through graduation. Chuck Johnston,
varsity first baseman, is also gone this
year, but Bill Maguire held down the
first sack in a commendable manner
most of last season, so the former
Cardinal captain's place is well filled.
Neil Miller, a transfer, is eligible for
the varsity this year, and should make
a strong bid for tne first base job.
Don Garibaldi will probably retain
his second base berth with little op
position. Hartley, the 1929 second
baseman, should make a good under
study for Garibaldi. Jim Busch, whose
work around shortstop was a feature
of nearly every game last spring,
seems to be a cinch for his job again
this year. John Rogers, freshman
short fielder, is one of the best of the
new candidates, and he may get a
chance to show his ability this year.
Cuddeback's graduation leaves the
third sack position open, although Bill
Clark, regular left fielder, may be
shifted to Cuddeback's place. Harder,
freshman third sacker, may also get a
chance.
Outfield Intact
Coach Wolter's sophomore outfield
will probably hold the three garden
