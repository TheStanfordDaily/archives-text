# DUMMIES INVENTED BY WARNER BETTER TRAINING EQUIPMENT
## 
### 
Glenn S. Warner, who for years has
been recognized as a master of foot-j
ball strategy, earning the appellation
"the Old Fox," also shows inventive-1
ness in improving the training equip- j
ment on the varsity field.
To impress upon players the neces
sity for tackling below the waist, War
ner has patented the special tackling
dummy now in use by the team. The
dummy is a standard model, but has
suspended around its waist a large
life preserver stuffed hard with saw
dust padding. When the tackier clips
or hits this wood and rag man above
the desired spot he strikes the ring,
getting a good jolt to stimulate his
memory.
Warner's other invention acquaints
each lineman with his place in relation
to the opposing forward wall and
teaches the backfield just where the
openings will be made. Five posts,
five feet high, padded for the first
three feet, and spaced about four feet
apart, form the main line, with one
similar post a yard in the rear of
tackle. The varsity takes its regular
formation; the ball is snapped; each
lineman takes out his man, repre
sented by a certain pole; and the
backfield dives through the four post
openings.
