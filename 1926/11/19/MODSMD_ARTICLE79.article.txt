# KPO TO BROADCAST PLAY-BY-PLAY STORY FROM BEAR STADIUM
## 
### 
i Arrangements have been completed to
! have everything which happens inside of
l the California Memorial Stadium tomor-
row broadcast to radio world.
KPO, which last year gave the play-by
i play results from the Stanford stadium,
will again be 011 the air this year. Hale
Brothers and the San Francisco Chron
icle are the owners of the station, and
elaborate plans have been made for the
event tomorrow.
Skilled technicians and electricians have
arranged that evey noise, yell, announce
ment, and play-by-play results will be
i sent over the air. Broadcasting will
| begin before the kickofT and will last
until the final bleacher stunts have been
completed after the game is over.
Microphones will be placed at vantage
points in the stadium, so that all the
noise will be transmitted.
Because of the limited capacity of the
! stadium, thousands of people unable to
: gain admittance or living too far away,
I will be able to get the results of the game
as they happen, as well as hear the
, bleacher yells. It is estimated that nearly
a million people heard the results last
i year.
