# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Next Saturday will see many "Big
Games" (and most of them will be the
last contests of the year for the rival
elevens), hut none will attract as large
or as colorful a gathering as the Stan
ford-California classic 'on the Pacific
Coast. llow about the Yale-Harvard
or the Ohio State-Illinois games, you
may ask? The Yale Bowl can scat
around 80,000 at the most, and the Illi
nois Stadium 67,000, but over 100,000
persons will view the game in the Cali
fornia Memorial stadium tomorrow, 78,-
000 sitting within the enclosure and
about 25,000 more on the "ticketed" space
on the hillside above the huge bowl.
This, the "Yale-Harvard game of the
Far West," is like its big brother in the
East in that the rivalry between the
two schools involved is so intense and
so historic that the interest in the game
is just as great, even though one or both
of the contesting elevens has been pre
viously defeated. When Captains Swan
and Griffin meet with the referee in the
center of the field upon which the late
Andy Smith's ashes were scattered, no
one will care that California has ex
perienced her most disastrous season in
years, or that comparative scores show

U
j Stanford to have a far stronger team.
One of the features of the Coast's
i Big Game are the "bleacher stunts"
j executed by the rival cheering sections.
I have seen games all over this country,
except in the South, and nowhere ex
cept in California do they do these
things, which are spectacular in the ex
-1 treme. By means of colored cards,
which each rooter holds up in front of
I him, or by use of colored capes and
hoods, and white shirts, the massed
thousands of men students are able to
J build huge block letters, emblems, pic
tures, and so forth. The effect is very
startling when a great 'C" or "S" in
j gold on blue or in white on red, is
! changed instantly to blue on gold, or
! red on white, in time to music or to one
! of the college yells.
A huge silhouette of Captain Ernie
; Nevers, in a kicking pose, was made by
I the Stanford cheering section last year,
'as well as a mammoth locomotive
| which puffed out real smoke from its
I chimney in time to the famous "Loco
motive Yell." The California Bear, the
j famous axe, and the American flag, are
I other electrifying living pictures that
I have been seen at this Big Game in re
| cent years.
