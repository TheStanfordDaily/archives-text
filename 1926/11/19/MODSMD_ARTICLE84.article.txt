# BABE SQUAD OFFERS VALUABLE MATERIAL FOR FUTURE VARSITY
## Freshman Eleven Completes Season Strong Despite California Defeat 
### 
Losing the California game was the
only blot on an otherwise clean record, ,
for the Babes won <_ sry other game. !
The team walloped the U.S.C. fresh
men decisively, 27 to 0. The team may |
have unconsciously pointed for the
U.S.C. game, which would account for [
its poor showing against the Cubs.
The season is one that the Babes |
may well be proud of, always excepting !
the Little Big Game. St. Mary's Fresh
men, the California Institute of Tech
nology at San Luis Obispo, San Mateo
Junior College, Sacramento Junior Col
lege, Modesto High School, and the i
Trojan freshmen all fell down before j
the Red Shirted yearlings. The team
did earn three touchdowns against the;
Bear Cubs, but proceeded to hand the 1
California yearlings several touchdowns i
by failing lo tacklc properly after the
runner got into the secondary defense.
Coach Hunt will have some valuable
material to turn over to Warner for j
next fall. The men on the line may get
a chancc to see action next year, b'it
the backs will probably have to wait
Another season before they get a chance.
Warner Hobdy, who played fullback
until A1 Forster was injured, and was I
then shifted to tackle, looks like varsity ;
timber right now. Hobdy can punt,
pass and buck the line, from full, or
play tackle with the best. He played
tackle at a military academy on the
same team with Jesse Hibbs, now a !
star at U.S.C.
Hobdy has the build and looks of
Ernie Ncvers. Men who are competent
judges say that he tackles and blocks
as well right now as Ncvers ever could, i
He can punt as well, and pass much
further. He has thrown a football over
seventy yards.
Although Hobdy is the best looking
prospect at present, several other men (
will bear watching next fall. Lud Fren
trup, Nelson Smith, Bill Murphy, Wil
liam Laird, William Clark, Walter
cinccke, Captain Bill Simkins, and
Harlow Rothcrt, all backfield men, are

worthy of mention for work done this
fall.
Ray Hulen, Bill Burke, Harold Tem
pleman, Charles Eddie, John Linley, A1
Forster, Henry Lawshe, Kendall Al
dertson, Clarence Bush, Tom Driscoll,
Stanford Steinbeck, among others, arc
linemen who will be looking forward
to the beginning of varsity practicc.
