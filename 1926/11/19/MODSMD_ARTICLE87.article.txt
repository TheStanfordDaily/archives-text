# ANNOUNCEMENT MADE OF TEAM PERSONNEL FOR WOMEN'S DEBATE
## 
### 
Helen Carpenter and Marian Holley
have been chosen for the affirmative
and Mildred Crow and Georgia Fin
nerty will represent the negative in
the triangle women's debate between
Stanford, Mills College, and the Uni
versity of California on November 30.
The question is, "Resolved, That in
sanity as a defense in criminal cases
be abolished."
Stanford's affirmative team will
meet the negative from California at
Stanford on this date, while California
and Mills will debate on the Berkeley
campus, and Stanford's negative team
will argue the question with Mills on
the latter's campus.
Recent reforms made in the insanity
defense have caused the question to
assume public importance. In England,
reforms have taken place to such an
extent that the insanity defense has
fallen into disuse except for criminal
eases. The state commission of legal
reform of California has also found it
necessary to stop the abuses of the
insanity plea, and have recommended
a proposal separating the trial on the
charge, and the trial on the plea of
insanity. The latter is now to take
place after the regular trial.
