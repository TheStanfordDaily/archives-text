# WOMEN PLAN COLORFUL DISPLAY FOR BIG GAME
## 
### Aileen Hicks 
The women are not to be left out
of anything—not even a football game.
There will be 500 Stanford women
(the total feminine registration of the
University) at the Big Game tomor
row, arrayed in colors that the rain
bow alone can rival. Only the best is
fit for the occasion, when half a thou
sand women can proudlv display big,
white chrysanthemums blazoned with
a crimson "S" as a symbol of the fact
that their IQ is sufficient to entitle
them not merely to attend college, but
to go to Stanford.
But what would the Big Game be
without the women? Who wouldn't be
disappointed not to hear the scream
of a feminine voice when a Stanford
star gets off an end run, even if it is
for no gain? Or again when a forward
pass goes sailing through the air to
be smeared by an opposing player
on tne second down, and the feminine
contingent shrieks in anticipation of
great things accomplished. Even if
they don't understand what it's all
about, there's the thrill of the contest.
Anybody attired in a red shirt (plus
other necessary accessories) and on
that field is a hero, to be duly wor
shipped from 2:30 to 5 o'clock. End
runs and off-tackle bucks look alike
from the women's rooting section.

They do know what a punt is, but
after a good boot by either Stanford
or its opponent, duly taken care of by
the safety man, the burning question
always is, "Who's got the ball?" Every
body knows what a touchdown is.
That's one advantage. Then do the
women yell? Try to drown them out!
If .Itfpiter Pluvius should be in a
lachrymose mood tomorrow, the array
of green, purple, blue, red, and yellow
raincoats displayed by the women will
inveigle the spectators into thinking
that the Stanford rooting section is
pulling a new bleacher stunt.
And after the game, when the fes-1
tivities are under way, the lucky wo
man who dances with the hero who
made the winning touchdown will in
cur the envy of her less fortunate '
sisters. And so another Big Game will
pass into history—gone but not for
gotten.

star gets off an end run, even if it is
for no gain? Or again when a forward
pass goes sailing through the air to
be smeared by an opposing player
on tne second down, and the feminine
contingent shrieks in anticipation of
great things accomplished. Even if
they don't understand what it's all
about, there's the thrill of the contest.
Anybody attired in a red shirt (plus
other necessary accessories) and on
that field is a hero, to be duly wor
shipped from 2:30 to 5 o'clock. End
runs and off-tackle bucks look alike
from the women's rooting section.

They do know what a punt is, but
after a good boot by either Stanford
or its opponent, duly taken care of by
the safety man, the burning question
always is, "Who's got the ball?" Every
body knows what a touchdown is.
That's one advantage. Then do the
women yell? Try to drown them out!
If .Itfpiter Pluvius should be in a
lachrymose mood tomorrow, the array
of green, purple, blue, red, and yellow
raincoats displayed by the women will
inveigle the spectators into thinking
that the Stanford rooting section is
pulling a new bleacher stunt.
And after the game, when the fes-1
tivities are under way, the lucky wo
man who dances with the hero who
made the winning touchdown will in
cur the envy of her less fortunate '
sisters. And so another Big Game will
pass into history—gone but not for
gotten.
