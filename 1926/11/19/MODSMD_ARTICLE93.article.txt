# BEARS NEAR END OF WORST SEASON THEY HAVE HAD IN YEARS

Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 18.—A some
what improved but never over-confident
Golden Hear Varsity will clash with the
Stanford Cardinals Saturday in the Me
morial Stadium at Berkeley. Meeting
defeat after defeat throughout the sea
son and showing only a slight flash of
form in the game with Nevada last
week, California's eleven will neces
sarily enter the Big Game the under
dog for the first time in years.
Confronted with inexperienced men
and further hampered by serious in
juries during the season, Coach Nibs
Price has had a hard job on his hands. J
A man with less courage and fortitude
than the diminutive Bear mentor would
have shrunk from tackling such an over
whelming problem. Not so Nibs Price
—week by week and day by day he has
endeavored fo impart his knowledge to
men who are green and new at the
game.
Stanford Edge
And now the day for which the stu
dent bodies of both institutions and the
public in general has looked forward to j
is about to become a reality. The big!
question in the mind of everyone is,
naturally, what the outcome will be.
Taking all the facts into consideration,
the past scores, the material and strength
of both squads, the keen observer can
come to but one conclusion; Stanford
has a decided edge which should spell
victory at the end of the contest.
That the Bear Varsity will fight as it
has never fought before is a foregone
conclusion, and Coach Pop Warner's
eleven will certainly know what it means
to buck up against a snarling mad Gol- j
den Bear.
Bears in Good Condition
The Varsity came through the Ne-|
vada game with nothing more than a 1
few bruises and should be in tip-top
shape for Saturday. The same back-1
field combination will undoubtedly start
the Big Game, as it is the first to show I
any threat of an offense this year.
Captain Bert Griffin will be at right
half, Red Gill at left half, Dick Blewett, ,
quarter, and Earl Jabs will play full.
Captain Griffin has been under a tre- \
mendous mental strain all season and it j
has hurt his playing Now
that he has been relieved of his worries 1
as defensive fullback, the Bear leader i
is beginning to flash his old-time form. |

Bert always plays his best against the
Cardinals and his supporters are confi
dent that this year will not be an excep
tion to the rule.
Gill, while young and inexperienced,
'is a hard player and '•yrcecdingly fast ap
his feet. Jabs proved his worth in the
Washington game and his excellent
showing as defensive full has earned
him the right to start against Stanford
Blewett will call signals and his main
contribution will be his defensive work.
Strong Forward Wall
Line-coach Doc Boles has welded
together a strong forward wall, and one
which should give the Card backs plenty
to worry about. With Andy Miller at
center, Niswander and Sargent, guards,
Coltrin and Cock, tackles, and Dougery
and Huber, ends, the California line
will be at full war strength. Then there
are several capable substitutes, in Phil
lips and Bancroft, ends, Lindgren,
guard, Ned Green tackle, and Bob
Green, center.
In the backfield, Breckenridge, Cock
! burn and Clymer should all see service
I before the end of the game. The Bears
i will retire to the Mt. Diablo Country
I club Friday at noon and remain in se

elusion until time for the game Satur
day. California's student body has been
confronted with a new phenomenon
this year—that of rooting for a losing
team. The manner in which it has re
sponded in the face of loss after loss is
gratifying both to the team and to
Coach Price. Like the team on the
field, they will not quit while there is
still a minute left in which to fight.

Stanford Edge
And now the day for which the stu
dent bodies of both institutions and the
public in general has looked forward to j
is about to become a reality. The big!
question in the mind of everyone is,
naturally, what the outcome will be.
Taking all the facts into consideration,
the past scores, the material and strength
of both squads, the keen observer can
come to but one conclusion; Stanford
has a decided edge which should spell
victory at the end of the contest.
That the Bear Varsity will fight as it
has never fought before is a foregone
conclusion, and Coach Pop Warner's
eleven will certainly know what it means
to buck up against a snarling mad Gol- j
den Bear.
Bears in Good Condition
The Varsity came through the Ne-|
vada game with nothing more than a 1
few bruises and should be in tip-top
shape for Saturday. The same back-1
field combination will undoubtedly start
the Big Game, as it is the first to show I
any threat of an offense this year.
Captain Bert Griffin will be at right
half, Red Gill at left half, Dick Blewett, ,
quarter, and Earl Jabs will play full.
Captain Griffin has been under a tre- \
mendous mental strain all season and it j
has hurt his playing Now
that he has been relieved of his worries 1
as defensive fullback, the Bear leader i
is beginning to flash his old-time form. |

Bert always plays his best against the
Cardinals and his supporters are confi
dent that this year will not be an excep
tion to the rule.
Gill, while young and inexperienced,
'is a hard player and '•yrcecdingly fast ap
his feet. Jabs proved his worth in the
Washington game and his excellent
showing as defensive full has earned
him the right to start against Stanford
Blewett will call signals and his main
contribution will be his defensive work.
Strong Forward Wall
Line-coach Doc Boles has welded
together a strong forward wall, and one
which should give the Card backs plenty
to worry about. With Andy Miller at
center, Niswander and Sargent, guards,
Coltrin and Cock, tackles, and Dougery
and Huber, ends, the California line
will be at full war strength. Then there
are several capable substitutes, in Phil
lips and Bancroft, ends, Lindgren,
guard, Ned Green tackle, and Bob
Green, center.
In the backfield, Breckenridge, Cock
! burn and Clymer should all see service
I before the end of the game. The Bears
i will retire to the Mt. Diablo Country
I club Friday at noon and remain in se

elusion until time for the game Satur
day. California's student body has been
confronted with a new phenomenon
this year—that of rooting for a losing
team. The manner in which it has re
sponded in the face of loss after loss is
gratifying both to the team and to
Coach Price. Like the team on the
field, they will not quit while there is
still a minute left in which to fight.

Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 18.—A some
what improved but never over-confident
Golden Hear Varsity will clash with the
Stanford Cardinals Saturday in the Me
morial Stadium at Berkeley. Meeting
defeat after defeat throughout the sea
son and showing only a slight flash of
form in the game with Nevada last
week, California's eleven will neces
sarily enter the Big Game the under
dog for the first time in years.
Confronted with inexperienced men
and further hampered by serious in
juries during the season, Coach Nibs
Price has had a hard job on his hands. J
A man with less courage and fortitude
than the diminutive Bear mentor would
have shrunk from tackling such an over
whelming problem. Not so Nibs Price
—week by week and day by day he has
endeavored fo impart his knowledge to
men who are green and new at the
game.
