# FOOTBALL MEN RELEASED FOR HOOP PRACTICE
## Shipkey, Price, Vincenti May Join Basketball Squad at Workout Tonight MAY RETURN TO GRID Proposed New Year Contest Would Keep Players Off Court Till January 
### ELBERT G. THOMAS 
Three stars of last year's basketball
team, Fred Price, Ted Shipkey, and
Louis Vincenti, may report to Coach
Husky Hunt tonight for the first hoop
practice in the pavilion. In the event
of a post-season football game with an
eastern team to be played in Pasadena
on New Year's Day, these men will be
unable to report to Hunt until after
the Christmas holidays.
Augmented by a dependable string of
veterans, filling one deep each of the
positions on the 1926-27 Stanford quintet,
Coach Hunt steps into the job vacated by
Andy Kerr, who went East as a head
football coach last year.
Headed by Captain Nelson David, such
players as Fred "Moco" Newhouse, Wal
ly Jayred, and Ned Anderson are avail
able for berths. Members of last year's
freshman five with McCandless notable
among them, have turned out this week
in a manner that indicates a plentiful sup
ply of all the fresh material "Husky"
will need in his rebuilding program. Vet
eran basketball men now playing with the
football varsity will be handicapped by
reporting late, Coach Hunt says, so he is
not depending too much upon men like
Price, captain last year, Shipkey, or Vin
centi.
Popularity Planned
Enthusiastic plans, whereby basketball
in the West will be ultimately restored to
popularity on a scale rivalling that of
eastern colleges, where, he says, there are
to be found many capacious and well
equipped gymnasiums, many strong teams,
and an ardent following, are included in
the inaugural step to be taken by the ne
Cardinal hoop mentor.
Changes Made
Backed by the Board of Athletic Con
trol, Coach Hunt has supervised changes
in the basketball pavilion here which
make it the best on the Pacific Coast. A
newly installed lighting ystem, which cost
$3,000, furnished the most adequate il
lumination of any Western court, and
the plate glass back-boards which have
proved unsatisfactory here during the
past two years, have given way to new
regulation wooden standards. The spring
floor of the pavilion was acclaimed the
best to be had anywhere, upon its com
pletion three years ago.
