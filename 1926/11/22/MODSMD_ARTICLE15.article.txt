# BIG THINGS ARRIVE IN FOOTBALL SHOW AFTER SLOW START
## Al Cass, Velma Randall Put Big Game Gaieties on Cake of Ice 
### D. T. R 
When sometime in the early part of
! the fall it was decided that Ram's
Head would take over the production
of the annual Football Show, we ex
pected big things of it. In the Big
Game Gaieties the big things arrived,
though they took a bit of a while
arriving.
A 1 Cass and Velma Randall really
put the show on ice after "Helmet"
by Dave Lam son and E. H. Sloss had
given it a good start. Up to that point
the Gaieties seemed to lack a certain
amount of punch.
"Fair Enough" Good Gag
The skit, "Fair Enough," had a good
gag, but there was a lot of waiting
before it was pulled. Too many people
had a hand in being protagonists for
the one joke, which with about fifteen
others would have been meat for a
couple of patter artists. The Boone-
King-Boone dancing act showed obvi
ous lack of smoothness despite the
beautiful work of Frances Boone. Then
"If' Men Played Cards as Women Do"
was well enough but it took up where
the trial of man left off but one act
before. As a satire it was excellent,
but being so close to the afoiresaid
number it lacked the necessary fresh
ness. The singing of "Evening Brings
Me You" was good, but the chorus
should never have been allowed to ap
pear in white.
"Hemlet" turned out to be a well
written playlet, and then the Gaieties
scored in "Tough." A 1 Cass's own
songs with Peg Randall and himself
to put them over, provided an all
sufficient reason for anyone to see
the production. The Daves-Robertson
rooting section pulled off its stunts
without a hitch.
The second half started in a rush
with Kathleen Fitz to sing Jean Wake
field's ,song, "Mama's Coin' Bye-bye."
It was as appealing a number as has
been given in a long time, and it is
not to be wondered that Paul White
man is including it in his repertbjre.
The Brooks-Worthinifton orchestra
sisted ably in keeping up the melody.
Miss Wakefield's song should go down
in the annals. It is to be earnestly
hoped that she will compose more for
Stanford's shows in the future.
Allen Campbell's pianologue was an
other fascinating interlude. And the
scenes of the Quad's yesterday and
today were picturesque and highly in
teresting. The whole act gave to the
show a personal touch which is ex
ceedingly valuable. "Gypsy Fires," the
Glee Club offering, was well done,
while the selections were well chosen.
Lamson's "Ah-Choo Mystery" again
took too long to work up to any point
whatsoever, and the audience was not
at all mystified, alarmed, or even more
than very mildly amused by the suc
cessive dashing of various young wo
men across the stage.
Show Entertaining
But taken as a whole, the Big Game
Gaieties was highly entertaining. It is
one of the traditions of Stanford that
should never be allowed to drop. Al
though the production of campus
vaudeville is difficult and arduous, the
effort is more than worthwhile.
As a suggestion, however, it might

be well in the future to confine the
chorus to a few simple maneuvers.
Balancing on one foot and singing at
the same time is something that few
professionals even can do with ease
and poise. It takes much work to ac
complish, and two weeks or so is ob
viously too short for tlie^attempt.
