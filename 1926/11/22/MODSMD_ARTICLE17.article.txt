# CARDINALS AVENGE PAST DEFEATS IN CRUSHING VICTORY OVER BEARS
## Warner Machines 41-6 Win Evens Up Big Game Scores, Equals Record for Overwhelming Lead Made By Wonder Team in 1921 Battle STANFORD EARNS FIRST CLEAR CHAMPIONSHIP California Fighting Spirit, Battling Hard to Finish, Unable To Hold Back Inexorable Invading Host From Blue and Gold Goal 
### Jim Adams 
OTANFORD has evened up the score with California in American football!
Not only did the Cards by their crushing 41-6 defeat of the Bears Saturday
balance up California's total of nine victories but they offset the 42-7 beating
handed Stanford in 1921 by one of Andy Smith's Wonder Teams, a stigma
which has been for six years a sore spot to Cardinal students and alumni.
Inciddfi tally, as was expected, Pop Warner's undefeated eleven, by its
win over the Blue and Gold team Saturday, presented to Stanford Its first
undisputed Pacific Coast Conference Championship.
All in all, it was a great day for Stanford. Never has a Cardinal eleven
been so superior to its Bear foe before. From the time when Hyland took
the ball on the first play Stanford made and ran 48 yards to a touchdown until
the gun popped at the end there was no doubt as to the outcome of the game.
It was all Stanford except for the brave, fighting comeback of the Bears in

third period against a second
' string combination that Warner sent
1 in at the opening of the half.
Accounts Balanced
The entire Stanford team might well
be elected to Stanford's Hall of Fame
for the overwhelming victory which
balanced up accounts with California
and which was won in spite of treach
erous mud which greatly handicapped
the backfleld men and interference in
Warner's famous reverse plays. To
tell what the score might have been
on a dry field would sound like brag
ging and might be looked on as dis
' crediting California's splendid fight.
Captain Fred Swan might individu
! ally be elected to a separate Hall of
! Fame for the 60 minutes of fight he
I displayed which inspired his team-
I mates on to their achievements; for
playing a brand of football that meets
any all-American requirements; and
• for intercepting a pass, in addition to
other duties well performed through
out the contest, and running 35 yards
to a touchdown for the last Cardinal
| score.
Hyland Named to Fame
"Tricky Dick" Hyland might well be
i chosen to rest in the same Hall for
his spectacular 48-yard run on the first
play that the Cards took the ball that
resulted in Stanford's first score; for
. taking a short pass from Hoffman and
stretching his speedy legs to coyer 2-7
yards of slippery turf and carrying
i the ball over for the third touchdown;
; and for sensational long gains such
. j as running straight through the Bear
■ line for 15 yards from punt formation,
! ] some of which plays were instrumental
i in other Stanford scores.
George Hogue should also be among
; those present for lugging-the ball over
! for the second touchdown after ex
- changing long runs with Hyland to
j put the Cards within scoring distance;
for kicking five out of six placekicks
after touchdowns, one being blocked
after a slow pass from center; for
powerful off-tackle plunges that
pounded the stubborn Bears into sub
mission.
Honors for Ends
Ted Shipkey certainly rates the
same honor for playing such a flashy
game at end that All-American recog
nition can hardly be denied; for snag
ging a 20-yard pass from Hoffman and
running 10 yards for the Cards' fourth
touchdown; for taking the ball on an
end-around run on such a deceptive
play that no one knew who had the
ball, and sneaking over the fifth score.
Ed Walker at the other end deserves
like selection for blocking two of Cali
fornia's punts, unaided; for recovering
two of the Bears' fumbles in a manner
of following the ball that has hardly
been equalled hereabouts for some
time; and for playing such a whale of
a defensive game, as did his mate at
the other flank, that no play ever got
around him.
Bert Griffin Fights
Captain Bert Griffin duplicated his
work of last year's Big Game by fight
ing like a madman for California and
plowing through the line on powerful
off-tackle plays that even the strong
Cardinal line could not check. It was
through his individual efforts that the
Bears scored from Hoffman's blocked
punt and his spirit and fight were an
inspiration to the whole California |
team to put up a "hopeless battle by !
fight alone that Avon the respect of j
every spectator in the stadium.
