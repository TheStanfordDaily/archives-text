# CARDINALS AVENGE PAST DEFEATS IN CRUSHING VICTORY OVER BEARS
## Warner Machines 41-6 Win Evens Up Big Game Scores, Equals Record for Overwhelming Lead Made By Wonder Team in 1921 Battle STANFORD EARNS FIRST CLEAR CHAMPIONSHIP California Fighting Spirit, Battling Hard to Finish, Unable To Hold Back Inexorable Invading Host From Blue and Gold Goal 
### Jim Adams 
OTANFORD has evened up the score with California in American football!
Not only did the Cards by their crushing 41-6 defeat of the Bears Saturday
balance up California's total of nine victories but they offset the 42-7 beating
handed Stanford in 1921 by one of Andy Smith's Wonder Teams, a stigma
which has been for six years a sore spot to Cardinal students and alumni.
Inciddfi tally, as was expected, Pop Warner's undefeated eleven, by its
win over the Blue and Gold team Saturday, presented to Stanford Its first
undisputed Pacific Coast Conference Championship.
All in all, it was a great day for Stanford. Never has a Cardinal eleven
been so superior to its Bear foe before. From the time when Hyland took
the ball on the first play Stanford made and ran 48 yards to a touchdown until
the gun popped at the end there was no doubt as to the outcome of the game.
It was all Stanford except for the brave, fighting comeback of the Bears in

third period against a second
' string combination that Warner sent
1 in at the opening of the half.
Accounts Balanced
The entire Stanford team might well
be elected to Stanford's Hall of Fame
for the overwhelming victory which
balanced up accounts with California
and which was won in spite of treach
erous mud which greatly handicapped
the backfleld men and interference in
Warner's famous reverse plays. To
tell what the score might have been
on a dry field would sound like brag
ging and might be looked on as dis
' crediting California's splendid fight.
Captain Fred Swan might individu
! ally be elected to a separate Hall of
! Fame for the 60 minutes of fight he
I displayed which inspired his team-
I mates on to their achievements; for
playing a brand of football that meets
any all-American requirements; and
• for intercepting a pass, in addition to
other duties well performed through
out the contest, and running 35 yards
to a touchdown for the last Cardinal
| score.
Hyland Named to Fame
"Tricky Dick" Hyland might well be
i chosen to rest in the same Hall for
his spectacular 48-yard run on the first
play that the Cards took the ball that
resulted in Stanford's first score; for
. taking a short pass from Hoffman and
stretching his speedy legs to coyer 2-7
yards of slippery turf and carrying
i the ball over for the third touchdown;
; and for sensational long gains such
. j as running straight through the Bear
■ line for 15 yards from punt formation,
! ] some of which plays were instrumental
i in other Stanford scores.
George Hogue should also be among
; those present for lugging-the ball over
