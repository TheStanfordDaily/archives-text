UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
[ Seattle, Nov. 21. —Removal from the
1 hands of the freshman vigilantes of
the authority to enforce frosh tradi
tions has failed to create any great
dissension among the first-year stu
dents. A few members of tlie retiring
j vigilance committee and one of the
• class officers have voiced their disap
proval of the move.
Judging from a limited canvass of
the first-year students the average
freshman does not seem to concern
himself with the question, and little
interest has been displayed in the
change.
