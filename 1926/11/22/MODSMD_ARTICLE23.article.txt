# Another Bearskin
## 
### 
Last year we saw the varsity skin the Golden Bear—the beginning of
a new era. Since the reinstatement of American football the sons of the
Stanford Red had sat in the bleachers through two hours of agony and
had remained there while thousands of California rooters poured onto the
field to serpentine.
Twenty years seems like an immeasurable length of time for Stanford
not to beat California at the American game as we only average four
years in the University. But from 1905 to 1918 Stanford played rugby,
and in 1918 California started winning Big Games, and continued win
ning them until Warner came, and managed to get full control of the
Indians.
Saturday made two in a row for Stanford and those who saw
California dedicate the Stanford stadium in 1921 with a 42 to 7 score
could even more appreciate the 41 to 6 walloping the Indian handed the
Bear. It was interesting to hear the spirit of California expressed after
the game —"Just wait until next year."
It sounded like the Stanford men of the darker past, and there are
many in the I niversity now who have had to say that same thing year
after year. But emerging from the "dark ages" and realizing that we are
walking on a Bear rug, not for just a year, but for two years, and then
again perhaps always—it makes the world seem real.
Those football players down on a muddy field fighting for Stanford—
they deserve more individual and personal praise that can possibly be
given. A successful play means that every man has a duty to perform.
Runs through and around the line would not be possible without the work
of the linemen, and many times the unseen hero of a play is the one who
has opened up a hole or blocked the charging defense.
Back of it all is Coach Pop Warner—the man who develops the power
and brains of the players, who teaches them football, and who builds the
efficiency. To him is the praise directed.
In the memories is still a vigorous picture of the fight shown by the
California team when backed against the wall and whippped. Never
once did it falter, but fought to the final minute with desperation.
Those two long completed passes just before the closing gun is a
justification of its spirit. •
