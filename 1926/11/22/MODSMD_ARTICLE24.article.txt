# POP WARNER PAINTS PICTURES WHEN OFF FOOTBALL GRIDIRON
## 
### 
In these days of highly organized and
complicated football a football coach
would hardly be expected to do much
else except eat, sleep, and drink foot
ball. Yet, Glenn Scobie Warner, daddy
of them all, manages to find time, here
and there, to do a hit of painting, or
perhaps to work on some new type of
golf club.
Glenn Warner has always been of an
inventive frame of mind as is well il
lustrated by the extreme versatility and
trickery of his complicated plays. In
this respect, Pop Warner is usually a
season or so in advance of other
coaches. So deceptive have many of
his plays proved, that they have been
promptly barred, the following year by
the football association.
Great Generalship
However, it is in the sizing up of
rival teams on the field that Warner ex
cels. Field generalship and great con
centrative ability have combined to
make this possible. Thus hy the end of
the first half, Pop is able to construct a
suitable defense calculated to stop his
opponents, and at the same time a
stron gocensc aimed at the weak spots
in the enemy's defense.
In his younger days Glenn Warner
played a great deal of baseball, and was
extremely interested in all branches of
sport. Later he became fond of hunt
ing and fishing, particularly the latter.
Many original contraptions have been
invented by Glenn Warner. Besides
inventing special football equipment he
has worked out a golf club which is said
to produce far greater driving distance
than the average club.

[ Warner played football at Cornell
and was one of the best guards of his
i time. After captaining the team in
18904, he graduated and became coach
at Cornell. From Cornell he went to
lowa. Then Warner returned to Cor
nell, remaining there until 1899, when
he went to Carlisle Indian school. His
success at Carlisle was phcnominal.
Under Warner the Indians continually
took the measure of the highly touted
teams now composing the Big Ten.
However, in 1903, Pop again returned
. to his alma mater, Cornell, and coached
there until 1907. That same year he
came back to Carlisle, this time staying
seven years. As is typical of Warner
teams Carlisle during this period—and
notably in 1907 —was always in front.
C arlisle in those days was continually
I dangerous.
In 1914 Glenn Warner left Carlisle
and became coach at Pittsburgh where
i lie stayed until 1924. The following
: year he came to Stanford.
