## THAT BIG GAME! 
### 
And all those girls who were "young
and gay and not particularly interested
in prohibition" came from miles
around; and with them came rabid
alumni, and fond mothers, and proud
fathers, to join Stanford's tense and
eager sons; and they all found their
ways to California's great white sta
dium to watch a fighting captain lead
a great Cardinal varsity against a
Golden Bear who fought with despera
tion that comes to one whose back is
against the wall.

And when it was all over, Stanford
women went to celebrate at the hotels
on the "white list," and Stanford men
were not so fastidious in the matter of
a color scheme; and everybody raised

particular hell.

There will be those who will say
that it is not worth while, this Bis
Game. They point to the deleterious
effect of over-training upon the ath
lete, to the enormous expenditure of
money upon the whole affair, and they
will call attention to the laxity in de
corum that invariably marks the post
game celebration.
Possibly they are right. Possibly the
athletes are exploited for what they
may contribute to the rnlnr and glam
our of the game. Possibly there is a
great deal of money expended upon a
useless institution. Possibly decorum
departs to make way for pure and un
bridled joy. Possibly they are right?
Who knows?
AND WHO CARES?
