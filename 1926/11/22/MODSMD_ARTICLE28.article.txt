To the Editor:
Objection has been voiced by over
150 women students questioning the
validity of W.A.A. to assess every
woman student of the University two
dollars, by a show of hands at an
open meeting of W.A.A. board. Why
objections were not raised before is
beside the point. The question isâ€”
Does the W.A.A. have the right to
assess? No! A group of 115 girls can
vote to assess themselves but not to
assess 345 other Stanford women.
There is also a general feeling that
the W.A.A. board as an experienced
governing board has failed to be demo
cratic. Is it not an acknowledged fact
that a show of hands is an undemo
cratic method of voting? It would
seem it were beneath W.A.A. to take
a vote in such a grammar school way
to gain their point even for a good
cause.
Undoubtedly the women of Stanford
are in back of the W.A.A., but they
want to feel that their wishes are
being consulted. Especially so on a
matter of assessment. What organi
zation in this University has even
thought of taking the authority on
their shoulders to assess anybody for
anything?
Few of the students realize the po
sition they are in when they let them
selves be assessed for anything. They
are giving away one of their rights,
and no student organization is great

enough to possess that right.
