The Editor, Sir:
While you're with our tummies playing,
Your food effects are quite exciting,
Oh Encina, ah Encina!
How entrancing, how delighting,
Not to know on what we're biting
When at meals we're bravely fighting,
Ah Encina, oh Encina!
It goes without a Freshman's saying,
Oh Encina, ah Encina,
That the piper we are paying
While you're with our tummies playing.
But you've helped: you've got us pray
ing,
Ah Encina, oh Encina!
What a puzzle, and how thrilling,
Oh Encina, ah Encina,
Not to know, while we are filling,
If we're marching to our killing!
(But if this is food, we're willing,
Ah Encina, oh Encina!)
Marshall Kirby.
