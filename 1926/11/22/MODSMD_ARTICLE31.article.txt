THE STOOPING VENUS, hy Bruce
Marshall; E. P. Dutton, New York, $2.
Despite a good beginning and an
occasional flash of entertaining style,
the author does not quite succeed in
making his moral attractive enough to
compensate for its obviousness. That
moral says that it is necessary to lose
oneself to be happy.
The heroine, Louise, strives not to
lose herself, and she is unhappy. She (
marries a man whom she likes be
cause she does not believe she will
ever fall in love. Jim loves her sin
cerely, and by being reasonable and
generous and quite adoring succeeds in
making her moderately happy.
Then Louise meets a young novel
ist, who is himself unhappy, and who
of course falls in love with "golden 1
Louise" (she is a blonde). 1 She com
mits the indiscretion of letting the
affair grow until she finds herself in
love with him. She runs away with
him, only to decide at the eleventh
hour, when she finds that another
I
woman loves him and that he is rather |
fond of her, thjtf she should return to
Jim.
Jim does not forgive; he simply re
mains silent. Louise then falls in |
love with him. Finally, after Jim has I
been seriously ill and lost his eyesight, j
they come to a complete understand- j
ing of each other, and Louise loses
herself in her love for Jim.
The title comes from the statement
by Veronica, Louise's caustic artist j
friend who first introduced her to the j
novelist, that Louise is like the statue
called "The Stooping Venus," which is :
seeking something. Veronica says it i
seems not to know what it seeks, but I
she thinks it is something quite ordi- '
nary, common sense if it's philosophy,
a petticoat if it's a garment. It is com
mon sense which she savs Louise lacks.
Louise's problem is an interesting
one, but Mr. Marshall has to some ex
tent neglected to follow his own pre
scription for good writing, and that
is restraint. In places, he gushes. In
others, however, he is quite satisfying, j
The book drags in spots, but as a
whole is readable.

fond of her, thjtf she should return to
Jim.
Jim does not forgive; he simply re
mains silent. Louise then falls in |
love with him. Finally, after Jim has I
been seriously ill and lost his eyesight, j
they come to a complete understand- j
ing of each other, and Louise loses
herself in her love for Jim.
The title comes from the statement
by Veronica, Louise's caustic artist j
friend who first introduced her to the j
novelist, that Louise is like the statue
called "The Stooping Venus," which is :
seeking something. Veronica says it i
seems not to know what it seeks, but I
she thinks it is something quite ordi- '
nary, common sense if it's philosophy,
a petticoat if it's a garment. It is com
mon sense which she savs Louise lacks.
Louise's problem is an interesting
one, but Mr. Marshall has to some ex
tent neglected to follow his own pre
scription for good writing, and that
is restraint. In places, he gushes. In
others, however, he is quite satisfying, j
The book drags in spots, but as a
whole is readable.
