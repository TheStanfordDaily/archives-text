# STANFORD MEN NOW AT HARVARD PROTEST EXPULSION PROPOSAL
## 
### 
Stanford men now attending the
Harvard Graduate School of Law are
among those vigorously protesting the
action of Dean Roscoe Pound in
threatening the expulsion of one hun
dred first-year law men who cut a
Saturday class before the recent
Princeton game and for it have been
listed as "undesirable."
The action of the Harvard dean has
caused a wave of indignation, and is
characterized as "amazing and in vio
lation of tradition" by the Harvard
Crimson.
Dean Pound defends his stand by
stating that thirty-seven per cent of
the men in the law school last year
are now out, and that he does not in
tend to wait until June this year "to
weed out those who have no place in
a serious professional school." His
edict is that the work of the entire
one hundred men will be watched
closely from now on, and the slightest
deviation from the straight and nar
row path will result in a request of
withdrawal.
The former Stanford men who are
among those protesting the action are
Prank Frye, George Crocker, Wendell
Widaman, Herbert Sommer, Richard
Goldwater, Leon Brown, Douglas
Meservey, "Bud Palette, Howard Bissel.
Robert Edwards, Edward Silva, James
Mannon ,and Jack Sutro.
