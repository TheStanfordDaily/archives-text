# DASHIELL CONDEMNS INTERCOLLEGIATE FOOTBALL GAMES BARBARIC; SPORT SORDIDLY COMMERCIAL ROPER, PRINCETON COACH, DEFENDS PASTIME
## 
### 
"Shall we deflate intercollegiate foot
ball ?" is a question discussed widely in
American colleges, and the one over
which Alfred Dashiell and William Ro
per argue in the November issue of
Forum.
Intercollegiate football is a modern
Frankenstein in the opinion of Dashiell.
swelling from a friendly contest into a
barbaric Roman spectacle attended by
thousands of sentimentalists and hero
worshipers. And pervading it all is a
sordid commercialism, with its great
stadia, high-salaried coaches, extrava
gances of team management.
The time-honored defense of "athletics
for all," arising from the fact that the
football gate receipts practically support
the other college sports, most of which
do not clear expenses, is fallacious, ac
cording to Dashiell, who holds the sub
sidized athletics as prostituting the real
quality of sport, and of debatable worth
—"a whistle in the graveyard acccpted as
a call to prayer."
"So much publicity has attended football
in recent years," he writes, "that, for
most people the sole standard by which
colleges are judged is the quality of their
athletic teams. What is the result? Fur
tive professionalism, fake scholarships,
barefaced bribery, and kidnaping — ac
cording to presidents of small colleges
It it in the rear of the race for numbers
and endowments—are a few of the ac
tivities of the larger institutions.
Alumni Blamed
Alumni who return to the college
only for ihe big game and talk of their
alma mater only in terms of athletics
aie blamed by Dashiell for the present
over-development of the gridiron sport.
These enthusiasts put out fat stipends
monthly for the benefit of matriculat
ing high school stars and then win it
all back betting on their well paid-for
winning team. It is a circle expanding
every year, seemingly without limit.
"I have no uplifting sentiments to
offer on the football situation, but sug
gestions may not be amiss. To men's
colleges and co-educational institu
tions: Give the curriculum a chance.
Erect fewer buildings and hire better
teachers. Throw drones off the fac
ulty. Make the courses of study fur
nish some of the excitement.
"To alumni: Let's talk about some
thing else."
Roper for the Defense
Tn defense of the sport which he
coaches for a living, William Roper, of
Princeton, holds that football is at
least a partial solution for the prob
lem presented by the necessary sub
limation of "animal spirits, vitality,
and enthusiasm." quoting Dean Chris
tian Gauss, "For my part, I wish we
played football every Saturday during
the college year. My job during the
football season is much easier, as far
as enforcing discipline in the univer
sity goes, than at any other time."
He also advances the "Athletics for
all" argument, differing with his op

ponent on the value of the general
college athletic system, and justifies
the means—publicity, big amphithea
tres, over-paid coaches—by the end —a
large revenue, badly needed and ju
diciously budgeted.
Takes Little Time
The assertion, so often loosely
made, that football is taking up too
much of the students' time, is not
borne out by the facts. The demands
of practice and games together take
up less time than any other competi
tive sport. Last fall at Princeton foot
ball took up exactly sixty-six hours of
the players' time while the university
was in session."
Roper firmly believes healthful ath
letic training a good preparation for
good citizenship. "I am firmly con
vinced that the winning football player
is the thinking football player and
that the most vital qualification for
those who wish to excel at the game
is brains."
Twitting the more militant intellec
tuals and others who would make stu
dents of everyone, Coach Roper quotes
from an address of President Ernest
M. Hopkins of Dartmouth before the
National Collegiate Association in
New York: "It is not surprising in a
country where we strive to make a
man temperate by legislation, indus
trious by court decree, and happy by
political oratory, that we should as
sume our ability to make men scholars
bv denying them the opportunity for
indulging in any other interest."
