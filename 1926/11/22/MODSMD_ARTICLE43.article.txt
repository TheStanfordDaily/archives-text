# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is one of the outstanding back- |
field stars of the United States, who,
except for his punting, is a better all
around full-back than the great Ernie
Nevers, according to his coach, Andy
Kerr. As Andy coached the famous
Ernie at Stanford for three years be
fore going to Washington and Jeffer
son, he should know whereof he
speaks. Bill Amos is the one great
player this year in the Western Penn
sylvania district, a territory that has ;
produced so many great stars and
where, probably, the best football in
the country is played, year in and
year out.
Young William Amos learned his
football in France, for he started play
ing the game at the age of seventeen,
when he was "Over There" as a sol
dier. Without many of the advantages j
that most boys who go through school
have, he entered Kiski Prep, and then
Washington and Jefferson, the little
school at Washington, Pa., that had
tied California's "Wonder Team" at
Pasadena on New Year's day, 1921.
Soon Amos, because c? his happy
faculty of running wild on the gridiron,
was nicknamed "The Wild Bill of the
Campus." He starred throughout the
1925 season, and this year finds him a
prominent contender for All-American

honors. In the game with Carnegie
Tech., played on October 16, Captain
Bill made a spectacular 90-yard run
to a touchdown, after catching a punt
on his own ten-yard line. As he raced
through the entire Tartan team, he
guided his team-mates in taking out
the various players who were trying
to bring him down. "Wild," did I say?
Maybe, but "Cool as Ice" too —that's
Bill all over!
