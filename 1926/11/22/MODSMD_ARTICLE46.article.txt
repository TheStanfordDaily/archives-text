record of five victories, one tie, and
one defeat, and the innovation of light
weight gridiron attire has been adopt
ed by Notre Dame and numerous
other eastern elevens. Purdue hits
come through the season piling up 133
points to 36 for their opponents.
The invention of silk football pants

equipment for his lightweight squad,
and after several experiments, settled
on balloon silk.

a half as compared with the eight
pounds of the old type, and have rub
ber foam hip pads instead of leather
pads. For wet weather, Phelan uses
trousers made of material similar to
that of which slickers are made.

downed Franklin 44 to 0, Indiana State
Normal 38 to 0, Chicago 6 to 0, Wa
bash 21 to 0, and Saturday, defeated
