# WOMEN ENGAGED AS WAITRESSES, TYPISTS TO EARN EXPENSES
## Students of Early Days Took Charge of Local Homes And Children

"Waiting on tables or stenography
are probably the most reliable forms
of work among the Stanford women
who are earning their way through col
lege," said Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, ap
pointment secretary, when asked her
opinion on the most prevalent means
of self-support among Stanford women
today.
Tutoring; translating; acting as as
sistants in the library, laboratories,
and Roble gym; part-time clerking;
assisting in scoring mental tests; act
ing as correctors in departments; ca
tering and entertaining; conducting
agencies; sewing; taking care of chil
dren; acting as companions; and read
ing aloud, were the other important
sources of revenue she mentioned.
Many Teach
Many girls earn a large percentage
of their expenses by doing full-time
teaching or other work during the
summer. The total sum earned in this
way last year was $10,198.52.
An interesting contrast to the pres
ent conditions is disclosed in the Daily
Palo Alto of October 30, 1902. Twenty
seven girls were earning their way
then, whereas there are 115 who are
doing full or part-time work now.
Housework and taking care of chil
dren were the leading occupations,
over eighty per cent being engaged in
this work.
Work for Room, Board
According to Mrs. Snell, working for
board and room is little done at the
present time because living facilities
are such at Roble that a girl can live
economically and at the same time
enjoy the companionship of other girls
at the hall.
Only three girls were then engaged
in the other great standbys of today â€”
stenography and tutoring. Seven were
occupied with odd jobs such as laun
dry work and some types of office work.
Tending the Roble door bell (a relic
long since removed) was another fa
vorite job.
