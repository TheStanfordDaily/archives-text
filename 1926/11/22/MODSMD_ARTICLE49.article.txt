# ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS IN SUNSHINE SOUGHT BY MANY EUROPEANS
## 
### 
Though the ultra-violet rays in Cali
fornia sunshine do not excite Cali
fornians in the least, the peoples of
Europe are very zealous in their
search for the health-giving sunlight,
says Dr. C. L. A. Schmidt, University
of California biochemist, who recently
returned from a tour of Europe.
Dr. Schmidt found that Europeans
are compelled to get their sunlight
from sun-baths, due to a variety of un
favorable climatic conditions which
shut out the ultra-violet rays. Euro
pean bath-houses are all equipped with
sun decks which are regularly used by
persons seeking to remain in good
health.
In London the deficiency of ultra
violet rays, due to fogs, rain, and
smoke, is so great that the leading
London paper prints a daily notice of
the amount of ultra-violet light present
during the day to impress people with
the importance of the rays.
