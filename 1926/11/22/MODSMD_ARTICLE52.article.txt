# EASTERN RESEARCH PROVES MIND NOT AFFECTED BY SLEEP
## 
### 
Although the loss of two hours'
sleep nightly constitutes a heavy drain
on physical energy, it leaves no bad
effects on the mind except that it is
more difficult to concentrate after
ward. This is shown in experiments
started at Colgate University to test
the effect of partial insomnia, and the
results are published in the current
issue of Industrial Psychology, a Col
gate University department of psy
chology publication.
Mental Tests Given
Three young men were given daily
practice in mental multiplication. For
one week the men obtained eight
hours sleep each night and in the fol
lowing week only six hours. In both
periods similar problems were solved
on awakening in the morning, and
metabolism of oxygen was measured
before and after the solutions, in the
expired air of the subject. The result
was that though the mind was quicker
and more accurate in the second per
iod, from two to three times as much
oxygen was consumed in working the
problems when the men were suffer
ing from lack of sleep.
Since the "burning" of nerve tissue
could never occur in such great
a mounts as to account for such a dif
ference, the increased muscular ten
sion caused by concentration was held
responsible for this change in the
bodily ~ cost of mental work. This
proves that it is more difficult to con
centrate after a loss of sleep.
Food Poor Substitute
It was estimated that in a 48-hour
working week the calory loss would
amount to 624 calories, or about the
amount of energy supplied the body
by one heavy breakfast. It would
seem that increased food might sub
stitute for lack of sleep, but in answer
to this argument the writer states:
"The analogy of the automobile will
answer this. Using additional fuel the
car can be driven in low gear. The
distance is covered, the added cost of
gasoline is not enormous â€”but the ma
chine will not be in good condition
after many miles have been traveled."
