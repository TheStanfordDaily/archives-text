# DR. JORDAN STATES HONOR SYSTEM NOT REALLY NECESSARY
## 
### 
Declaring that he does not believe
in the honor system, Dr. Jordan, ad
dressing the freshman assembly in
Encina last night, stated that, in his
opinion, no professor should give ex
aminations in which would
be possible. Dr. Jordan intimated that
examinations in which only facts or
things learned by rote are required
are of little worth, and only examina
tions which demand a good deal of
individual thinking on the part of the
student are of any value.
Dr. Jordan first addressed the gath
ering on the topic, "The Value of a
College Education," after which ques
tions on varied subjects were an
swered.
When questioned about prohibition
and its apparent failure, Dr. Jordan
replied that the Eighteenth Amend
ment is with the people of the United
States for good. "The only possible
change that might be made," Dr. Jor
dan said, "might be in the modifica
tion of the Volstead Act." The sug
gestion that the United States enter
into the business itself, thereby legal
izing the possession of liquor, but
eliminating the saloon, was declared
improbable and undesirable. "Nine
tenths of the prohibition enforcement
officers are chosen by liquor interests
for the express purpose of making the
Eighteenth Amendment unpopular,"
he said.
