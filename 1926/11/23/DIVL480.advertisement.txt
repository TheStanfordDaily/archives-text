IN YE OLDEN DAYS the Host provided the Turkey
gathered from the wild flocks roaming in the forest.
People were more primitive and rugged. Little
attention was paid to DRESS.
IN MODERN DAYS each Host and Guest endeavor
to attire themselves in Harmony with the Season.
Thus, we see around each Bountifully Laden Table
a group of friends strikingly costumed to comple
ment the day and season, yet each individually
different.
AS IN YE OLDEN DAY they gave Thanks for a
Bountiful Harvest; so should we in Modern Times
give Thanks for the Opportunity of so easily ac
quiring those Beautiful and Comfortable acces
sories of DRESS. GOOD SHOES and GOOD
