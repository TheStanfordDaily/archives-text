# RUMORS OF NEW WARNER CONTRACT FALSE, MASTERS
## Coach's Position Same as That of Any Other Faculty Member 
### 
In last night's papers it was rumored
that Coach Glenn S. "Pop" Warner
had signed a five-year contract to re
main head coach of the University at
$20,000 a year. When asked last night
regarding this statement, Alfred R.
Masters, General Manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, said that
there was absolutely no truth in the
newspaper story.
"The story is just as erroneous as
those which appeared a few weeks
ago about Warner's leaving Stanford,"
lie remarked. "The newspapers have
played up an unauthenticated bit of
news that is based on rumor. And they
are wrong.
"Coach Warner's position at Stan
ford is the same as any other member
of the faculty. He is the Director of
Football. He has 110 contract with the
University, but is employed under the
same conditions as all the other pro
fessors. As to the amount of his salary,
that is a private matter of Warner's."
