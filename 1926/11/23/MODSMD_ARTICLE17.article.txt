"The deadest of all dead languages"
awoke from its slumbers and received
collegiate recognition this year when
a group of nine graduate students of
the University of Nebraska began the
study of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit is the earliest of the group
of "Indo-European" languages about
which scholars have any adequate
knowledge. English and all modern
tongues are later developments of this
group.
Though Sanskrit was spoken about
four thousand years ago by the peo
ples of ancient India, modern colle
gians have failed to take an interest
in it, until the organization of the
class of nine at Nebraska.
