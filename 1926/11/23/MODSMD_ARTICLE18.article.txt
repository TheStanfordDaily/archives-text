# FOOTBALL MANAGER IN 1900 WIRES TO CONGRATULATE POP
## 
### 
That the old fire over the Stan
ford-California game lives just as
strong after twenty-five years was
apparent in the words of a tele
gram received last night from
Burt C. Gildersheeve, ex-'O2,
now in Detroit, Michigan. Gilder
sheeve was student football man
ager in 1900, the year that Field
ing H. ("Hurry-up") Yost was
coach at Stanford, and the year
that California was defeated 5-0.
The telegram reads: "Had you
sat in the stands at San Francisco
in ninety-nine as I did and seen
California crush us thirty to noth
ing as I did, and had you wept
as I did you would better under
stand what joy I got the forty-odd
in Stanford's 1 score of Saturday.
Over a quarter of a century can
not kill the kick that still comes
when Stanford wins. Congratulate
Warner.
"Burt C. Gildersheeve."
