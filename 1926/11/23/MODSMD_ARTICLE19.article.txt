# JUNIOR WOMEN WIN HOCKEY GAME FROM FRESHMAN TEAM, 4-1
## 1928 Rolls Up Three Points In Opening Quarter to Defeat 1930 Squad 
### 
Piling up a safe lead in the first
quarter the junior women won a 4 to 1
victory over the freshmen in the sec
ond hockey game of the championship
series. The game was played yester
day afternoon on Roble field. After
the initial spurt of the juniors, the
freshmen rallied to hold them score
less for two quarters, and to make
the fourth quarter a 1 to 1 tie.
The first six minutes of the game
saw the juniors futiley threatening the
1930 goal. Then Carolyn Shepard got
the ball clear of the defenders and
drove it into the goal for the first
score of the game.
Juniors Score
After that score the juniors seemed
to get into their stride, and from the
bully-off they carried the ball straight
to the freshmen's scoring circle, where
Lida Rittler sent it into the goal. The
third score came almost from the
bully-off, Dorothy Cone scoring.
Freshmen Rally
The freshmen started the second
quarter with a serious threat to the
junior goal. They stayed in 1928 ter
ritory for some time, aided in part by
the numerous penalties the juniors
incurred, but were unable to score.
Then the juniors returned the ball to
freshman territory, where they failed
to push through to the goal.
In the third quarter this procedure
was reversed, the juniors threatening
first, and the freshmen clearing and
taking the ball to the 1928 goal, only
to be stopped, and to have the play
shift back to the center of the field as
the period ended.
Freshmen Score
The fourth quarter started with an
advance by the freshmen. In a colli
sion, Marian Holley, who had the ball,
was knocked over, and turned a com
plete somersault. She jumped up, how
ever, recovered the ball, and raced in
for the only freshman score of the
l game. The play see-sawed for several
minutes, and then Edith Mattson,
junior captain, made the last count of
the day on a rush for goal.
