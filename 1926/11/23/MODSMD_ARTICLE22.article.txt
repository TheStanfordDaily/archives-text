# CARDINAL DEBATERS MEET CALIFORNIA TONIGHT ON QUESTION OF OPEN SHOP
## Split Team System Will Be Used for First Time; Police Protection LABOR PROBLEMS ACUTE Cavalero Takes Affirmative Side After Surveying Labor Troubles 
### 
Some solution to San Francisco's
troublesome labor problems will be
sought for tonight by Stanford and
California debaters, meeting in the
Native Sons Hall, San Francisco, to
consider the question, "Resolved, That
the American plan should prevail in
San Francisco."
"The object of this debate," an
nounced Robert Littler, debating
coach, "is to present to the people the
actual facts on bth sides and to point
out, if possible, a solution to this labor
problem."
Philip Cavalero, who will take the
affirmative side for Stanford, lias com
pleted a careful study of the existing
situation in San Francisco, and in his
argument will advance his conclusions
as to the probable success of the
American plan, in the event it is
adopted. C. Craven Scott, also uphold
ing the open shop plan with Cavalero,
has studied the present strike with
reference to its causes and the vio
lence employed. He will outline a pro
gram designed to prevent similar out
breaks in the future.
Truman on Negative
That the American plan destroys
labor organizations will be the main
stay of John Truman's argument. Tru
man, who is taking the negative side
for Stanford, has been working on a
plan which he believes may promote
harmony between capital and labor in
San Francisco.
A solution of the matter at hand
will be the aim of both the affirmative
and negative in this debate.
For the first time in the thirty
years of debating between Stanford
and the University of California the
split-team system in a no-decision de
bate will be used. Under this system
two Stanford men and one Californian
will uphold the affirmative, while the
negative will be supported by one man
from Stanford and two from Cali
fornia.
As the feeling on the strike ques
tion is very strong in some quarters,
the officials have deemed it advisable
to provide police protection against
any possible violence that might arise.
