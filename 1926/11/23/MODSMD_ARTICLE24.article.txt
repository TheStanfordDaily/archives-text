# FIVE EASTERN TEAMS UNBEATEN, ELIGIBLE TO PLAY STANFORD
## 
### 
Only live undefeated grid teams are
eligible to meet Stanford in the East-
West New Year's contest as a result
of Saturday's games. Brown, Navy,
and Lafayette, in the East, Notre
Dame, in the Middlewest, and Alabama
in the South, have survived the season
without being tied or defeated in a
single start.
Lafayette is leading airother Ameri
can scoring machines, having scored
330 points to their opponents' 37 in a
string of nine victories. Brown is con
sidered by many critics to have con
quered Eastern teams of real strength
and would be a desirable opponent for
the Cardinals. The Iron Men have run
up 213 points to their opponents' 26.
Although winning all games, the
Midshipmen have not overwhelmed
their opponents. In beating George
town, 10-7, they defeated the second
highest scoring team in the United
States. Saturday, Annapolis turned the
tide against Loyola 35 to 13.
Notre Dame Strong
Since Notre Dame plays the Univer
sity of Southern California on Decem
ber 4, it is doubtful if the Irish from
South Bend would accept an invita
tion to meet the Western champion
ship holders. When beating Northwest
ern 6-0 and West Point 7-0, the Catho
lic institution eliminated two of the
strongest contenders for national
honors.
The "Crimson Tide" has vanquished
the Southern elevens with ease, piling
up 209 points to 14 for their opponents.
Alabama showed a strong offensive
but failed to play any important inter
sectional games during the season.
