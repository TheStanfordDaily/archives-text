"The ability to speak and write good
English is, in my opinion, ahead of
any specific vocational training for
general success in life," states Dr.
Leonard Lundgrin, principal of the San
Francisco Part-time High School, in
an address before a meeting of Phi
Delta Kappa last night.
Dr. Lundgrin places citizenship and
character training alone ahead of Eng
lish training In importance, and al
though a vocational director himself,
he feels that spetific vocational in
struction is secondary to both these
things.
