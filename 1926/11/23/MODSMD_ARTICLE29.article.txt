# Rivals Again
## 
### 
Stanford and California are rivals again tonight, but this time not in
an athletic contest, but in the Thirtieth annual debate between the two
institutions. This year two changes have been made which tend to make
the yearly affair of less interest than before.
In the first place the. debate this year will take place neither at
Stanford nor Berkeley, but instead on neutral groundsâ€”the Native Sons
Hall in San Francisco. "Resolved, That the American Plan should
prevail in San Francisco," is the'topic to be discussed. The subject is
of particular interest to the citizens of San Francisco, but a college
debate should be given where the students will be able to attend.
In the second place, there will be no decision rendered this season,
and the result will be that both teams will admit their side was the victor
in the argument. We are not denying that a debate can be a success
without a decision, but the point is that more interest will undoubtedly
be taken in the affair if one side could be acclaimed the winner after it
was over. At present records show that California has scored several
more decisions than the Cardinal team has. Will we never be able to
even up this score?
