Looking back in the musty records we find that Stanford won an
annual basketball series from the University of California in 1921. In
fact there are a few of the older graduate students that can remember
that year when, after defeating the! Bears, the Indians went on to win
the Pacific Coast Conference title. But we cannot find anyone who
remembers winning a Cal series since that time.
Of course we do not; want anyone to get the idea that Stanford is
trying to grab all the honors —but it would be a real satisfaction to win
a basketball series from the Bears once again.
It seems as though some years ago certain people were in the habit
of jesting about the possibilities of Stanford defeating Cal in football.
But now this possibility has been thoroughly substantiated by fact.
This year we have a veteran basketball team with a good squad of
first-class substitutes and plenty of excellent possibilities coming up from
last year's freshman squad. There is a new coach in charge. Coach
Husky Hunt has worked with all the men in their freshman years —he
knows them and knows their capabilities.
So the stage is all set—the possibilities are there. Another triumph
in a major sport looms.
