Once in a while there are vague stir
rings in that magnificane head of ours
to the effect that the spiritual factor
in Stanford's makeup is following the
Dodo into limbo.
Then it is, that we become morose,
and we think of Stanford, not as the
colorful center of culture which we
believe it should be, but as a drab
place lacking in warmth and person
ality. You know, we mean a university
with a great engineering school, and a
wonderiui medical school, and a mag
nificent law school, and no soul.
We were thinking something like
that on Friday night when we at
tended the Big Game Gaieties. And
then Kathleen Fitz sort of floated out
on the stage, swayed slightly, like a
soft, red flame in a gentle breeze, and
began to sing a songâ€”not an ordinary
song, mind you, but that song that
Jean Wakefield wrote, the one that has
to do with a truant "Mama."
Now certainly, we considered, there
must be something to ah institution

, that could liarbor a girl who could
write music like that, and another who
! could sing it jn the manner which it
merited.
At another time, when the stage was
very dark, until some inspired indi
| vidual threw a shaft of light upon
Velma Randall, looking very winsome
| indeed, dressed as Hollywood has
I taught us to believe the ladies dress
! on the Bowery. And then A 1 Cass,
j equipped with his remarkable ukelele,
strolled out in front of Velma, and the
two of them sang some things that A 1
wrote. The songs had to do with a
Bowery romance. But, somehow or
I other, out of that romance, there had
: been drawn something of magic, which
I had been brought there, to the Stan
| ford stage.
So we went home after it was all
i over in a vastly different mood than
the one in which we had come. For
we had something of a glimpse of a
warm personality at Stanford, and we
were immensely cheered.
