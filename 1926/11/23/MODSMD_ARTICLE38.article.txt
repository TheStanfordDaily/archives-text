The Editor, Sir:
The right of a minority of the mem
bers of an organization to arbitrarily
lay an assessment on all its members
—all of whom hold membership re
gardless of their own desire in the
matter—now wears the innocent ap
pearance of "$2 each."
On this campus the. University has
heretofore monopolized the privilege
of laying assessments on students, be-
I rause it alone has the power of col
lecting them. Recognizfng this a $20
fpe has been charged by the Univer
sity which is divided among the vari
ous student organizations to insure
their existence and activity. Beyond
this contribution it has been the cus
tom to leave it to the student to de
cide whether or not he should con
tribute to further incurred expenses
by these organizations.
Now we have the W.A.A. stepping
forward with the doubtful authority
gained by a show of hands from a
group of well-fed members—hugely en
joying an excuse from gym class —
and attempting to assess every one
of the 500" for a thing only 113 were
interested enough in—(even with the
attraction of food)—to even attend the
meeting.
Let us enjoy the luxury of a W.A.A. j
cabin provided there are enough j
W.A.A. members sufficiently inter- j
ested to voluntarily contribute and i
raise funds by the legitimate methods I
employed for other campus projects.
But if its initial payment is to con
stitute an obnoxious precedent let's
let it go.—An Automatic Member of
W.A.A.
