The Editor, Sir:
A word of comment on the so-called

.dance given after the Big Game Gaie-
I ties last Friday night.
Those in charge, laboring no doubt
i under the opinion that the excess of
j good spirit which exists the night be
i fore such an important game would
i stand for anything, had the dance in
| the pavilion. And what a dance it
| was not.
The floor of the pavilion had not
| been swept, let alone waxed, or in any
way prepared for dancing; so that
i dancing was difficult in the extreme.
1 The shuffling of the dancers on this
! sand-pile made it almost impossible
| to hear the music beyond the middle
j of the floor.
It would have been something of an
j insult to even invite anybody to dance
j under such trying conditions, but to
! charge a dollar for the privilege is
j too much.
Here's hoping that the Dramatic
j Council, Ram's Head, or whoever was
j responsible for the miserable fiasco,
; will find much use for the profits.
â€”L. S.
