"THE ROMANTIC COMEDIANS" — |
Ellen Glasgow. Doubleday, Page &
Co., $2.50.
This new book of Ellen Glasgow,
the author of "Barren Ground," is an
amusing and entertaining picture of
the conflict of the new South and the
old —the struggle between the senti
mental traditions of Southern chivalry, ;
and the modes and manners of the \
younger generation.
It is done in Miss Glasgow's inimi- '
table style, and shows in a fine way
her keen wit and rather cruel irony.
It has not the magnificent sweep of j
emotions nor the breadth of "Barren ;
Ground," but it has been, of course, i
treated in an entirely different man- j
ner. The earlier book was done In a
typically "classic" manner, while the |
"Romantic Comedians," as the name j
implies, is treated with the romantic
touch.
The book achieves, in the story of
Judge Honeywell—the Victorian gen
tleman under the heavy strain of be- |
ing both a judge and a southern gen- j
tleman —and his difficulties in his mnr- j
riage to his young wife of the twen
tieth century limited, that situation '
that is neither comedy nor tragedy, j
Perhaps the best thing about the book ;
is that it has avoided the development j
of the obvious.
When we finished the story, we |
wondered if not the most ironic touch
of all was our vagueness—did Ellen j
Glasgow mean this as another exam- I
pie of the differences between the]
Victorian era and our own age, or as j
simply the inevitable struggle of '
youth and age?
