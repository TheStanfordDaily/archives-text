# STUDENTS AT OREGON CRITICIZE UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
The absence of a positive scholastic
tradition, a lack of correlation in the
university curricula, the presence of
many undesirable students, and the
"habit of spoon-feeding" were charged
by an undergraduate committee at the
University of Oregon recently as re
sponsible for the failure of the univer
sity "atmosphere" to be, in their
opinion, "intellectually vitalizing," in
a report published by the university.
The student report suggests as reme
dies higher standards of entrance and
grading, the grading point system of
Stanford being recommended as desir
able, and a special college for all
freshmen, designed to give a broad
background and having few electives.
