# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The class in Gridiron Astronomy will
please come to order. The subject for
today's lesson is "Moon" Baker, Cap
tain of the Northwestern University
football team. A "Moon" by name, yet
withal a star of the first magnitude,
and if some Astronomers of -the Big
Ten have their say, an unstopable
comet that swoops across the turf,
leaving disaster and destruction in its
wake.
Ralph Baker, of Rockford, Illinois,
besides running with the ball, can
punt, drop-kick, forward pass, and
i back up the line with the best of them.
The reason that you haven't heard
more of him before this is that he is
one of those football players who is
followed by the jinx, and in 1924 and
1925 he was severely handicapped by
injuries. Indeed he was out nearly half

! the season last year, and so lost his
j chance to make the many mythical
! teams, the choosing of which send so
j many to the bughouse.
It was my luck to see "Moon" Baker
work against Chicago and Notre Dame
in 1924. The Purple squad, which for
years had been a door mat to most of
the conference teams, held Stagg's
men to a 3 to 0 score, and, for a while,
| led the mighty "Four Horsemen" G
to 0, thanks to two difficult field goals
kicked by Mr. Baker. "Moon" showed,
in these two contests, that he easily
ranked next to Grange as the most
valuable all-around backfield man in
the conference. It is hoped that with
the added incentive of the captaincy
and a new stadium to perform in,
"Moon" will shine this never
j before.
