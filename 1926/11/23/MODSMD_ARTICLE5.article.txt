### 
Choosing "Financial Reconstruction
of Poland" as his subject, Professor
Harley L. Lutz of the economics de
partment will give his impressions of
the economic and social conditions of
the Polish peoples in a lecture in the
Little Theatre at 7: liOi o'clock tonight.
Professor Lutz was one of a small
group of experts in financial organiza
tion which spent three months this
summer investigating conditions in
Poland at the invitation of the Polish
government.
Inequality of Wealth
Speaking of the social conditions of
the people, Lutz says that there is
much inequality of wealth resulting
in poverty for the general population.
In his lecture Dr. Lutz will touch
upon phases of the economic situation
involved in banking, the railroad sys-

tem, general resources such as agri
culture, lumbering, and mining. He
will also speak in detail of the politi
cal position of Poland brought about
! by her position between Germany and
| Russia.
Lack of Education
"Although the mass of the people
I me liuw deficient in education, plans
j are being made to provide more edu
cational opportunities for the general
public. The Polish government is at
present spending nearly twice as much
on its army as on its schools," says
Lutz.
Dr. Lutz returned to the campus yes
| terday from Philadelphia where he
attended the annual conference of the
National Tax Association. He has been
chosen as vice-president of the asso
ciation for the coming term.
