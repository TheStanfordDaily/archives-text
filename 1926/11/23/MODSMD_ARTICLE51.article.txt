# Largest Used Book Store At Washington University
## 
### 
The used book department of the
University of Washington bookstore is
one of the largest in the country, and
| pays back to the student approximate
ly one-half of his initial expense for
| textbooks. The success of the depart
' ment is dependent largely upon the
j ability of the store's buyer to guess
' when the head of a department is
i going to change his mind. Professors,
j according to the manager of the store,
i are the most consistently fickle-minded
j class of people on earth.
