! pleted in 1916. The bells were cast in 1
England in 1915 bv John Taylor and i

' by the war, the bells did not reach

hung by W. H. Billinghurst, an expert I
chime-hanger from England. The
I chimes first rang on Thanksgiving
Day in 1917.

' of $250,000, and the esplanade at the
! base at a cost of $39,000. It raises 302
| feet into the air, and is 34 feet square i
iat the base. The structural steel of
; the interior amounts to 501 tons, the
i dials of the clocks are 20 feet 6 inches
in diameter, the minute-hands weigh- j
ing 100 pounds each, and the hour
(hands 75 pounds each. The largest of j
i the twelve bells weighs 4032 pounds,
| and the smallest 349 pounds. The

! tower was erected under the plans of
| Professor John Galen Howard after
i the pattern of the famous Campanile
i or Venice.
