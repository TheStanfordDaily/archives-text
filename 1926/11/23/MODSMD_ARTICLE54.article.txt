"Football is utterly hopeless at Cor-
I nell." So states gloomy Gil Dobie, foot
ball mentor of the Crimson eleven, as
reported by the Ohio "Green and
White."
He states: "We can't pretend to
meet our rivals on even terms. Other
! schools get football players, boys born
and bred in the game who come to
i college with prep school reputations.
; Here all we have are students. The
courses are so tough that they can't
allow football to interfere. Anil those
| we get on the football field are not
j real athletes and never will be."
