# CHAPEL SERVICE AT STANFORD COMPARED TO POMONA SYSTEM
## 
### 
"Stanford's regular chapel service
is as'near the true chapel idea as one
could find in any large university."
Stanley W. Larson, a Junior trans
fer from Pomona, expressed the above
opinion in a special article for "The
Student Life," Pomona College daily,
in which he compared the compulsory
chapel idea in force there with the
voluntary attendance plan at Stanford.
"As Stanford is absolutely non-sec
tarian in her views," continued Lar
son, "the clarion-call of chapel as well
as of all religious gatherings spon
sored by the university is conspicuous
by its silence. 'He who seeks shall find
it —and is welcomed, but the 'conic
to chapel' idea has never been in
cluded in the Stanford plan.
"With, for instance, a comparatively
large percentage of Roman.Catholics
and Christian Scientists enrolled, at
tendance must remain 011 a strictly
voluntary basis. For this reason, com
bined perhaps with the early hour of
meeting, (he average attendance does
not exceed thirty or forty students.
But here it is interesting to note that
Hie group "changes considerably from
morning to morning, although there is
a small number who attend regularly.
This shows a condition peculiar to the
nature of the service held at Stan
lord."
Discussing a possible change in the
Pomona system. Larson stated that,
in Dr. David Charles Gardner's opin
ion, "Pomona, with her background
and traditions fundamentally Congre
gational, has a much better opportun
ity for the development of a worth
while chapel service—voluntarily held
—than has Stanford with her non
sectarian basis and consequent differ
ing religious views of her students. Al
though attendance would inevitably
drop to a low ebb in the early stages
of such a change, Pomona has a great
opportunity in reorganization with this
new system to an impressive service
well attended. Chapel-goers would
thereby attend' with the idea of get
ting something from the service, simi
lar to the fundamental motive now em
braced at Stanford."
