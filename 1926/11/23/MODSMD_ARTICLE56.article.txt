# Married Students Work Harder Say Professors
## 
### 
According to faculty members of
Washington University, married stu
dents do better work than single ones.
"They aren't thinking of heavy dates,"
said one professor. "I don't believe
that the married students are any
smarter. They have been through the
â€”the excitement, and can adjust them
selves to the more serious problems."
Another professor admitted that sev
eral of his best students were married,
but added that perhaps it was merely
a coincidence. It was generally agreed,
however, that the married students
were generally older than the others.
