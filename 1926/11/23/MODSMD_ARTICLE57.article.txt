# SLEEP ESSENTIAL TO EFFICIENCY CLAIMS HARVARD PROFESSOR
## 
### 
Results of experiments recently
made at Yale and Colgate universities
to discover the cost of lack of sleep
are inconclusive, in the opinion of
Professor E. G. Boring of Harvard.
These experiments showed that three
men whose regular sleep ration was
shortened by two hours were quicker
and more accurate in mathematical
tests than when they were getting
more sleep, but the energy they re
quired was two or three times what
would ordinarily have sufficed for the
same work.
Professor Boring states that the
depth of slumber is proportionate to
onp's fatigue Wbpn the young men of
tlie experiment had two hours' less
sleep they probably slept more sound
ly than usual, and this would account
for the mental alertness which they
showed in mathematics.
"It is possible that a temporary loss
of sleep acts as a mental spur, espe
cially in the case of men who are
keyed up by being subjects for an
experiment. If they were kept without
sufficient rest long enough, the loss of
energy would be noticeable. It is true,
however, that a great part of our sleep
does not benefit us very much. The
first two hours of rest, according to
receut experiments, do us as much
good as the next six."
Psychologists do not state whether
"cramming" for examinations costs
more physically than the gain in men
tal alertness is worth, but it would
seem as if the student would lose noth
ing in studying late beforehand, if he
ia sufficiently "keyed up" by the pros
pect of an examination.
