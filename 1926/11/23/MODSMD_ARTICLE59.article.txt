# LAGUNITA WAS RESERVOIR FOR OLD STANFORD FARM
##

By Hallie Keating
Ask any alumnus what he remem
bers mosi about the campus and his
dear dead college days, and it's ten to
one that after he has stopped reminisc
ing about such-and-such a Big Game
he'll say, "Lagunita, spring quarter,
and ray red canoe!" His class does not
matter, because although Lagunita is
the campus' most ephemeral land
mark, it is older than the University
itself.
The lake was built way back in the
early eighties, originally to serve as a
reservoir for water with which to irri
gate Senator Stanford's alfalfa ranch.
That land now occupied by the campus
and buildings of the University was
planted in sixty acres of cattle fodder,
and explains the origin of the phrase,
"back to the farm."
The lake bed was first excavated
with scrapers, and then hardened and
tramped dowji by the great-grand
fathers or so of the present University
sheep. These sheep were brought down
from South San Francisco and estab
lished in a camp under the oak trees
011 the west side of the lake. Water
was brought in by ditch from San
Francisquito creek.
Every day about four feet of water
was drawn out, and the sheep driven

I around this. When the pond was near
. ly empty, fifty Chinese laborers were
; enlisted 011 the job, and the whole
ranch force plus the Chinese turned
j out and drove the sheep into the
; shallow water. The result of the long
! process was an exceptionally firm lake
' bottom. There have been few serious
| leaks in the history of Lagunita.
When the University was estab
lished, the lake was maintained at first
for the same purpose of irrigation,
j and finally for recreation. Feeble at-
I tempts have been made to introduce
crew, but siuce the space is very in
adequate the sport could make little
progress.
A women's boathouse was built
about 1912 -near the structure used by
the men, which had been built some
what earlier. A fire brought an end to
the men's boathouse, and so the pres
ent building serves for both.
With an average year the lake is
generally filled by the end of winter
1 quarter. In a particularly dry season
four years ago, there was 110 lake at
all. During the autumn the mud fiat
serves various useful purposes to the
student body, such as a practice golf
links, a short cut to the Quad from
the highway, and probably, most im
portant of all, the stage for the annual
Mud Fight.
