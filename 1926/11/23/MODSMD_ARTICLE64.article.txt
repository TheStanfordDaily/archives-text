# YALE MEN PLAN TEST OF EARTH'S ROTATION
## 
### 
Experimental evidence of the earth's
rotation on its axis will be furnished in
the Mason Laboratory at Yale by the
construction of a pendulum of iron !
forty feet long. A heavy iron ball will â€¢
be suspended ou a strand of piano'
wire from a specially constructed sock
et and knife edge mounted forty feet
above the ground.
The pendulum will then be set in 1
motion, swinging over a graduated
dial at a certain hour each day. As
the day advances and as the earth
rotates about its axis, the pendulum
will describe a complete circle of 360
degrees on the huge dial.
The physical principle involved is
not a new one. The famous French !
physicist, Foucalt, is credited with
blilding the first pendulum of the
kind in January, 1801, at Pario.
