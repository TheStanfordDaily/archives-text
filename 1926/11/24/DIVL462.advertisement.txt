The Constructive Function
of Investment banking
WEALTH is being accumulated in this coun
try at an amazing rate. It is now estimated
in excess of 35® billions—an increase of about
50% in the last ten years. Meanwhile, savings
deposits have increased in even greater propor
tion, and now exceed 23 billions of dollars.
1 he constructive function of investment bank
ing is constantly to direct the flow of surplus
wealth back into productive channels where it
will be safeguarded for the investor while it is
used to finance business and industry, and create
more wealth.
I here is a satisfying and profitable career in the
Investment Banking field for college men who
have sound economic training,combined with per
sonal qualifications and the energy to master a busi
ness that is as technical and, at the same time, as
human Iv in teres ting, as other popular professions'.
If you are interested in more complete infor
mation about Investment Banking as a vocation —
its possibilities, its advantages, its requirements—
we shall be glad to send you informative literature,
upon request.
