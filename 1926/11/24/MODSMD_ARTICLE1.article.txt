### 
Speaking before an audience of
about SOO representatives of Stanford
and the University of California ar
gued on the question, "Resolved, That
the American plan should prevail in
San Francisco," last night in a no
decision debate.
The crowd was evenly divided on
the question as judged by the thunder
ous applause which greeted the speak
ers of both mixed teams. Philip Cava
lero, C. Craven Scott, Cardinal speak
ers, and Stuart Strong, U.C. debater,
presented the affirmative side of the
question, while Sanford Goldner, of
California, John Truman, Stanford,
and Robert Tiedman took the nega
tive.
McNab Chairman
John L. McNab, San Francisco bar
rister and publicist, was the chairman
of the debate. No decision was made
at the request of both universities
because the speakers were not pre
senting the attitude of their respec
tive institutions.
Cavalero, the first affirmative speak
er, traced the history of San Fran
cisco's labor difficulties, pointing out
the failure of Union labor to stimulate
industry. Speaking for the negative,
Goldner attempted to prove that the
reign of the closed shop was very
beneficial to San Francisco's pros
perity.
Scott Stresses Violence
In his argument, Scott stressed the
violence committed during labor
strikes and showed how the American
plan is necessary for progress. Attack
ing Scott's views, Truman pointed out
that the open shop movement was only
attempting to destroy Unionism.
The last affirmative speaker, Strong,
explained the existence of the Ameri
can plan as a logical evolution of the
labor movement. Tiedman declared
that labor co-operation is impossible
under the American plan.
The affirmative rebuttal was given
by Scott., of Stanford, and that of the
negative by Goldner, of the University
of California.
