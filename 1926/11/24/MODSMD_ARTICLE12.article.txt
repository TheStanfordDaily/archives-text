# PETITION CIRCULATED TO RETURN WEIGHT BASKETBALL TO LIST
## 
### 
In the early part of this quarter a
petition was circulated among the men
students of weight basketball of the
130- and 145-pound classes. When the
1925 season ended these two sports
were dropped by the Board of Athletic
Control because of shortage of funds.
That this docision met with the dis
approval of a large number of the stu
dents is shown by the fact that over
250 of them signed the petition for the
restoration of the two teams. Most of
these men are eligible for one of
them, and it may be reasonably as
sumed that a large number would try
out if the sports should be sanctioned.
The petition was turned over to the
Circle "S" society by William Hobro,
where it was passed on very favor
ably. It is now up before the Execu
tive Committee, and if it meets with
favor from that body, it must go be
fore the Board of Athletic Control for
final confirmation.
