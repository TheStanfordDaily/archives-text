# STANFORD SELECTED TO MEET HUH IN PASADENA GAME
## Conference Gives Cardinals Permission to Oppose Southern Squad CRIMSON IS UNDEFEATED Pop Warner in Birmingham To Witness Georgia Tilt Tomorrow 
### 
That Stanford University and the
University of Alabama are the teams
definitely selected to play in the New
Year's Day football game in the Pasa
dena Rose Bowl to decide the unoffi
cial championship of the nation, is the
j announcement issued late last night
by General Manager Alfred R. Mas
; ters. The Pacific Coast Conference
has given Stanford the permission to
represent the West, and only one ob
! staole to the contest now remainsâ€”
Alabama must get the official permis
sion of the Southern Conference of
| which it is a member.
That this permission will probably
' be forthcoming is indicated by word
j from the South. Last year the South
ern Conference did not liesitato in
I placing its stamp of approval on the
i trip, and as the Crimson Tide made a
, great record by winning from the
Washington Huskies, Alabama will
(doubtless again grab the chance to dis
play its flashy team.
Direct communication from the
! President's office here to the Presi
j dent of the University of Alabama, has
revealed the fact that the reaction at
I Tuscaloosa is favorable providing the
I approval of the powers in the Confer
! ence is forthcoming. Stanford's accep
tance has been approved by the Fac
ulty Committee on Athletics, the Board
of Athletic Control, Coach Warner,
i and General Manager Masters.
The Crimson Tide is, for the second
consecutive season, undefeated, and is
at present leading the twenty-two
teams of its conference with eight
wins and no losses. Only fourteen
points have been rung up on the south
| ern team, while it has scored 209
[ points. Stanford has lost but two
| sames in three years, and tied one,
j and has won the- 1926 Coast Confer
ence with ten wins and no losses, to
score 261 points, while opponents have
made 79.
Alabama plays its last regular game
tomorrow, meeting the University of
Georgia, which it should conveniently
overcome. "Pop" Warner will be one
of the most interested and attentive
spectators at this game, since he left
Sunday night for Birmingham. From
there he will leave for the Army-Navy
contest in Chicago this Saturday, then
to come back to Los Angeles for the
Notre Dame-U.S.C. fracas on Decem
ber 4.
It was announced from the Gradu
ate Manager's office that tickets for
the New Year's Day game can be had
by application only. Further informa-
I tion will be published as soon as the
final arrangements are made. There
wlil be a Stanford roofing section,
i however.
Coaches Thornhill and Winterburn
| will take charge of the Cardinals when
they report for first practice since the
California game next Monday after
noon. Workouts are scheduled for the
three weeks following, with a lay-off
for final examinations, after which
there will be intensive practice for a
few days before the trip to Pasadena.
Stanford headquarters for the man
agement of the contest will be estab
lished at the Pacific-Southwest Bank
Building in Pasadena the first of next
; week.
