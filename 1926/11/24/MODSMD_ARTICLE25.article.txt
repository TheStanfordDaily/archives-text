Once a year the American Red Cross makes a drive for members
to help carry on its work. Each person's subscription is a mere dollar,
but the money obtained from millions of people in the country enables
the Red Cross to keep up its relief wherever emergency calls.
It is needless to enumerate the countless times when the Red Cross
has given immediate aid to the sufferers from some terrible catastrophe.
It is common knowledge that the workers are always ready to step into
the breach after accident, hurricane, or earthquake.
Now is the time of year when the national roll call is being carried
on by the American Red Cross. Its chief and practically only source
of income is from the memberships which the people of the United
States subscribe, and large sums are vitally necessary for its work. Only
through the giving of everyone can its efforts be succssful, and it is
fitting that the students of the University do their part by becoming
members.
