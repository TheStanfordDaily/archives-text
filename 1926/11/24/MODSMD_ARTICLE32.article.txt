Just two days after "Pop" Warner's
recent triumph in the Big Game there
appeared in a San Francisco paper,
a sport story, a story that was a cow
ardly insult to one of the most admir
able characters in American sport.
Five times in that story information
was accredited to "rumor." On one
occasion it was said that the "rumor
was widespread but unauthoritative."
The gist of the story was that "Pop"
Warner had been retained at Stanford
by an offer of $20,000 a year. Appended
to this was the insulting statement
that a large proportion of this money
was "rumored" to have been furnished
by a "certain financier." In other
words, a portion of Warner's salary
was "rumored" to have been given to
him as charity, and in violation of a
conference ruling.
Aside from what we think of a news
paper that makes a policy of printing
"rumors" on the front page under a
red-ink banner head, there is much to
say about the sport policy of this
particular paper.
It may all be summed up in the
statement that the sport editor of the
paper in question has spent his time

j around athletic contests for several
; years without being affected by the
| fundamental fine principle of athletics,
j sportsmanship. Last year he gave a
i great deal of publicity to an unpleas
j ant disagreement "rumored" to exist
! on the California team. This year he
j "rumors" that "Pop" Warner is ac
cepting charity, and is interested only
in money.

It is self-evident that this sort of
thing is not going to hurt Glenn War
ner. Those who know anything of the
influence that "Pop" exerts over his
men knows that he is not the type
pictured by this sport editor. As a mat
ter of fact, Warner is probably one of
the most admirable characters in
j American sport.
"May we congratulate Bill Leiser,
one-time editor of the Daily, on the
manner in which he hastened to de
fend Warner from this unfair attack,
j And may we become personal for a
| moment and remind the sport editor
] of whom we have spoken of the sev
eral times that he has been thrashed
in public, and to wish him many happy
returns of such occasions.
