# STUDENT ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH GROWING YEARLY
## 
### 
"More and more students have been
coming to church all along," declared
Alan McCaskill, Memorial Church
UKher for the past ten years, when
questioned as to whether Stanford
students are becoming more or less
"religious." When McCaskill first
came to Stanford, in 1917, it used to
be necessary to "rope oft"' the rear
half of the seats on account of the
email attendance at services. Since
then, he says, the crowds have gradu
ally increased, until at present the
church is nearly always well filled.
"I and they get along first class,"
was the terse expression McCaskill
used to explain how collegians behave
in church. Both the increasing attend
ance and the good behaviour are due,
the veteran usher believes, to the fact
that college people realize the educa
tion to be acquired at church, espe
cially with such a one as the Stanford
chapel, because of its high grade of
speakers and its excellent music.
Where McCaskill doesn't always
"get along first class" is with sight
seers. He chuckles whenever he thinks
of sightseers, and he has a large col

lection of anecdotes concerning their
actions in church. Especially during
organ recitals it is the habit of sight-
I seers to wander in and walk around
the chapel, admiring the stained-glass
windows and reading or copying the
: chiseled inscriptions, when the ushers
naturally have to go and try to per
suade the over-eager sightseers to de-,
sist until after the program, or the
service, as the case may be. The re
sults of this persuasion are often ex
j tremely humorous, but not proper ma
terial for publication, says the old
j usher.
McCaskill, who is a familiar figure
to Stanford students, as he delivers
j mail around the c&uipus in audition to
his duties as an usher, was acquainted
with a number of the cathedrals of
England and Europe before coming to
i the University. He is especially enthu
siastic over the Stanford Chapel as
compared to these cathedrals, believ
ing it to rank above most of them.
Stained-glass windows show up much
better here than in England, for exam
ple, he says, because we have so much
more sunlight.

then, he says, the crowds have gradu
ally increased, until at present the
church is nearly always well filled.
"I and they get along first class,"
was the terse expression McCaskill
used to explain how collegians behave
in church. Both the increasing attend
ance and the good behaviour are due,
the veteran usher believes, to the fact
that college people realize the educa
tion to be acquired at church, espe
cially with such a one as the Stanford
chapel, because of its high grade of
speakers and its excellent music.
Where McCaskill doesn't always
"get along first class" is with sight
seers. He chuckles whenever he thinks
of sightseers, and he has a large col

lection of anecdotes concerning their
actions in church. Especially during
organ recitals it is the habit of sight-
I seers to wander in and walk around
the chapel, admiring the stained-glass
windows and reading or copying the
: chiseled inscriptions, when the ushers
naturally have to go and try to per
suade the over-eager sightseers to de-,
sist until after the program, or the
service, as the case may be. The re
sults of this persuasion are often ex
j tremely humorous, but not proper ma
terial for publication, says the old
j usher.
McCaskill, who is a familiar figure
to Stanford students, as he delivers
j mail around the c&uipus in audition to
his duties as an usher, was acquainted
with a number of the cathedrals of
England and Europe before coming to
i the University. He is especially enthu
siastic over the Stanford Chapel as
compared to these cathedrals, believ
ing it to rank above most of them.
Stained-glass windows show up much
better here than in England, for exam
ple, he says, because we have so much
more sunlight.
