# HUGE DANCE SCHEDULED FOR ARMY AND NAVY 400 GUESTS EXPECTED AT HOTEL AFTER GAME CHICAGO'S MOST CHARMING WOMEN TO ATTEND
## 
### 
Chicago's most charming women ]
will receive invitations to the elabo- i
rate dinner-dance given for the Anna-
polis Midshipment an dthe West Point |
Cadets at the Hotel Drake, Chicago, j
on the Saturday evening after the
Army-Navy football game.
Since the limited acquaintance ofj
the middies and cadets with girls in
and about Chicago makes it necessary |
to invite additional women and since
Chicago desires that these women ,
shall be truly representative and of
"Chicago's best," it has been decided |
to choose them from three groups— j
the debutante, the educational, and the j
business groups. Probably about 300
Northwestern women students will re
ceive invitations to the dinner-dance — j
to be selected by a committee headed j
by the dean of women, Winifred Rich-1
ardson.
To act as hosts and to see to it that I

the guests are properly met and intro
duced .twenty men from Northwestern
University and twenty from the Uni
versity of Chicago will be chosen from
the upperclassmen ranks.
The dinner dance at the Drake is a
tremendous undertaking as it is ex
pected that nearly 4000 people will
attend. In order to mix the crowd
thoroughly a number of figure dances
will be featured during the evening.
The committee in charge of the dance
is said to expect little difficulty in
mixing the guests, however, as the
cadets and middies are of the true
type of American youth and will make
the affair as sociable as possible.
Dancing will last from 8:30 to 11
p.m., and after that there will be a
special Army-Navy frolic at the Chi
cago and Oriental theaters. One hun
dred or more coaches are being pro
vided to carry the merrymakers to
this celebration.
