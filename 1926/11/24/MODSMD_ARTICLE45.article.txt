# FOUR HOCKEY GAMES ON SCHEDULE FOR AFTER THANKSGIVING
## 
### 
No more championship hockey
games are scheduled until after the
TFlanksgiving recess, the next game,
between the juniors and sophomores,
being set for Tuesday afternoon at
4:20 o'clock on Roble field. The juniors
are conceded the better chance to
win in this contest, although both
teams are undefeated so far in the;
championship series.
The sophomores downed the senior
team 2 to 1 a week ago, and the
juniors took a 4 to 1 victory from the
freshmen last Monday. In spite of the
sophomores' surprise victory over the j
1927 team, and the slump the juniors
showed in the freshman game in which
only an early lpad maintained through
three hard-fought quarters in which
neither team gained any further ad- j
vantage, was responsible for the lop-!
sided final score, the 1929 women have
not yet developed enough power to
have more than a bare fighting chance, j
The complete schedule for the rest
of the series follows:
Nov. 30 —Sophomores vs. Juniors.
Dec. I—Seniors1 —Seniors vs. Freshmen.
Dec. 7 —Freshmen vs. Sophomores.
Dec. 9 —Juniors vs. Seniors.
