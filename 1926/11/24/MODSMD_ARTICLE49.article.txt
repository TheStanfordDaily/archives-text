# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Among the "Football Stars of Other j
Days" is Eddie Mahan of Harvard, a
big-jawed, lovable "tornado in mole- :
skins," who starred for three years at
Cambridge on the gridiron and on the
diamond. There are many Eastern
football experts who rank Eddie
Mahan above Red Grange as an all- i
around player. Eddie could kick, pass,
and receive passes, and run and tackle,
and he was an inspired leader, who
was loved by his teammates and ad- |
mired and respected by his opponents.
How Harvard would like to have
Eddie back now! He and his two side
kicks, "Tack" Hardwick and Charley
Brickley, made plenty of gridiron his
tory in 1913 and '14. Their combined
ability to hit the line, run through a !
broken field, interfere, tackle, pass and j
kick field-goals, made them almost a
whole team in themselves. Those were j

the days of the famous hocus-pocus
that went something like this:
Said one Harvard backfield man to
another —"Have you got it?" "Yep!"
"Then keep it!" —and they were off on
another drive toward the enemy's goal
line.
Eddie Mahan had a rare sense of
humor and, when some one once asked
him the secret of his success in ward
ing off tacklers, he replied, "Why, all
I do is to run up to a man and give
him my foot, and then take it away."
Eddie used to .stick his big jaw out
at opposing Yale or Princeton players,
make some wise crack and then send
the enemy flying right and left with
the shock of his attack. As captain in
1915, he led his team to a 41 to 0
victory over Yale, after helping to
beat them 35 to 0 the year before!
Yes, indeed, Harvard could use a
few Mahans around now!
