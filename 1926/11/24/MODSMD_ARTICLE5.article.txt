# LUTZ DECLARES POLAND LACKS ECONOMIC SYSTEM
## 
### 
"Lack of economic organization is
I one of Poland's leading defects. Her
i future, however, shows much promise
j —provided she can avoid provocations
j with real or imaginary enemies," said
I Professor Harley L. Lutz in his lec
ture oil Tiie Economic Aspects oi
Poland" last night in the Little Thea
tre. His conclusions are based on first
hand information gained when he vis
ited Poland last summer as a member
of an American commission to investi
gate Polish finances.
State Re-established
"The re-establishment of the Polish
I state is just beginning to be effective,"
j declared Professor Lutz. "Since its
j birthday on November 11, 1918, it has
i had to fight to carve out boundaries
i from the neighboring nations. Some
i times the boundary line is so irregular
! because of various opposing factors
! that it may run through a house, which
| fact lias been quickly seized upon by
j smugglers in southeastern Silesia to
i their benefit and satisfaction. Poland
; is now bounded by Germany, Lithua
! nia, Russia, Austria, and Czechoslo
vakia."
Discussing Poland's advantages in
re-establishing the state, Professor
! Lutz enumerated several: first, the
fact that she has no reparation pay
ments to meet; second, that her na
| tional debt, both domestic and foreign,
; amounts to only eleven dollars per
capita or approximately $349,000,000,
half of which is owed to the United
States under the usual foreign debt
funding agreement.
Rich in Resources
A third advantage lies in Poland's

possessing a great public domain in
cluding railroad line 3, two and a half
million hectares of rich forest land
i which will yield a large revenue in a
few generations, agricultural and min
! eral resources, and established indus
j Liius. L/Uiuumcu with a hard-working
i population and the general good-will
! of the western world, these factors
| have aided Poland to a large extent
in making over the nation.
"On the other hand," said Professor [
i Lutz, "there are several obvious dis- j
advantages, notably the fact that at i
' present Poland is a sort of shock- j
absorber or 'buffer* between eastern I
and western Europe. Because she is j
j regarded in this light the government j
has developed a sort of antagonism j
toward European governments, illus-!
j I rated by its selection of an American J
j instead of an English commission to j
j investigate Polish finances. This feel- i
| ing has also led to the encouragement j
;of military preparations which act |
j only as a hindrance to economic re-
I covery.
War Losses Heavy
"Another disadvantage which Po
land had to face at the beginning of
I her economic reconstruction was the
j tremendous losses which she had suf-
I
j fered during the war.
Poland faces a problem of three-fold
i unification —political, social, and eco
nomic, according to Professor Lutz.
I Tn the first field, the Russian, German,
and Austrian elements must be welded
—much in the fashion of the first thir
teen American colonies —into a nation
al unit with one civil, criminal, and
commercial code.

j fered during the war.
Poland faces a problem of three-fold
i unification —political, social, and eco
nomic, according to Professor Lutz.
I Tn the first field, the Russian, German,
and Austrian elements must be welded
—much in the fashion of the first thir
teen American colonies —into a nation
al unit with one civil, criminal, and
commercial code.
"Lack of economic organization is
I one of Poland's leading defects. Her
i future, however, shows much promise
j —provided she can avoid provocations
j with real or imaginary enemies," said
I Professor Harley L. Lutz in his lec
ture oil Tiie Economic Aspects oi
Poland" last night in the Little Thea
tre. His conclusions are based on first
hand information gained when he vis
ited Poland last summer as a member
of an American commission to investi
gate Polish finances.
State Re-established
"The re-establishment of the Polish
I state is just beginning to be effective,"
j declared Professor Lutz. "Since its
j birthday on November 11, 1918, it has
i had to fight to carve out boundaries
i from the neighboring nations. Some
i times the boundary line is so irregular
! because of various opposing factors
! that it may run through a house, which
| fact lias been quickly seized upon by
j smugglers in southeastern Silesia to
i their benefit and satisfaction. Poland
; is now bounded by Germany, Lithua
! nia, Russia, Austria, and Czechoslo
vakia."
Discussing Poland's advantages in
re-establishing the state, Professor
! Lutz enumerated several: first, the
fact that she has no reparation pay
ments to meet; second, that her na
| tional debt, both domestic and foreign,
; amounts to only eleven dollars per
capita or approximately $349,000,000,
half of which is owed to the United
States under the usual foreign debt
funding agreement.
Rich in Resources
A third advantage lies in Poland's

possessing a great public domain in
cluding railroad line 3, two and a half
million hectares of rich forest land
i which will yield a large revenue in a
few generations, agricultural and min
! eral resources, and established indus
j Liius. L/Uiuumcu with a hard-working
i population and the general good-will
! of the western world, these factors
| have aided Poland to a large extent
in making over the nation.
"On the other hand," said Professor [
i Lutz, "there are several obvious dis- j
advantages, notably the fact that at i
' present Poland is a sort of shock- j
absorber or 'buffer* between eastern I
and western Europe. Because she is j
j regarded in this light the government j
has developed a sort of antagonism j
toward European governments, illus-!
j I rated by its selection of an American J
j instead of an English commission to j
j investigate Polish finances. This feel- i
| ing has also led to the encouragement j
;of military preparations which act |
j only as a hindrance to economic re-
I covery.
War Losses Heavy
"Another disadvantage which Po
land had to face at the beginning of
I her economic reconstruction was the
j tremendous losses which she had suf-
I
j fered during the war.
