# Icemen's Fame Threatened Wisconsin Boasts of Star Babe Grid Wonder Found

Except for being a good forward
| passer, a receiver of merit, an able
| dropkicker and punter, a speedy man
' running the ends, and a splendid line
plunger and a sure tackier and block
er, he isn't much good for anything
else in the football line. That's John
Cavosie of the University of Wiscon
sin freshman football team, and in the
role of a chauffeur bids fair to take a
position alongside of the famous ice
men, firemen, and cowboys of the
gridiron.
Cavosie comes from Ironwood,
Michigan, where he displayed his
"jack-of-all-trades" ability on the Iron
wood High School eleven. In conjunc
tion he won a place for himself on
the all-state eleven last year, as full
back. He has consistently been punt
ing G5 yards in practice games here,
while a 45-yard drop-kick is also a
routine distance as far as he, is con
cerned.
