# U.S.C. FOOTBALL COACH TO USE NEXT YEAR'S MEN IN GAME
## Trojan Sophomores, Juniors May Battle Against Montana Eleven 
### 
Because fifteen members of his
present squad will be numbered among
the alumni when the 1927 football
season rolls around, Coach Howard
Jones of the University of Southern
California will begin preparations for
nex( year when he sends his grid out
fit against the University of Montana
tomorrow in the Los Angeles Coli
seum.
Out of the 1926 conference race and
with second place his only hope, Jones
says he must look to the future and
that to have the sophomores and jun
iors of the present team capable of
competing with other teams
next year he must give them experi
ence. From his starting lineup in
every game this season Jones loses
both ends, one tackle, both guards,
center, quarterback, and fullback. This
leaves him but a tackle and two half
backs for a 1927 nucleus.
New Men May Start
Against Montana, Jones may start
his newest combination. Captain Crav
ath will remain at center, but Jesse
Hibbs will replace Taylor at running
guard. Gorrell will be at the other post
which Oliver White held in reserve
to be given a chance if the Trojans
take the lead. The tackles will prob
ably be Marion Morrison, a sophomore,
and A 1 Scheving, a junior. John Fox
may start at tackle or he may play
center part of the game. The ends
will undoubtedly remain unchanged.
Harold Wheeler is picked to replace
Bert Heiser at inside half again. Lloyd
Thomas starts at outside half in place
of Morley Drury. Morton Kaer and
Manuel Laraneta will cavort at quar
ter and full respectively.
Coach Jones will need the entire
strength of his squad for the game a
week from Saturday with Notre Dame
which has been picked as one of the
best in the country following the Trisli
victory over the Army,
