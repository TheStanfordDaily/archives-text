# Scholarship Better in Age of Hip-Flask Says Dean of Northwestern

### 
"Figures prove that the hip-flask
and fur-coat age produces better schol-1
arship than did the preceding age," 1
said Dean James Armstrong of North
western University, at an alumni
meeting recently.
Tie gave the following statistics in I
support of his statement. "In 1915
eleven fraternities with 155 students
had a general average of 1.4; the
first semester of the present year our
fraternities with three times as many
students averaged 1.9. Our present
student body of 3800 on this campus
had a general average of 1.7. All this
despite the fact that the automobile i
is the parlor and our girls have grown
independent."
