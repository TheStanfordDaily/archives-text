# Manzanita, Chaparral, Sumac Shrubs Now Grow On San Juan Hill Plot
## 
### 
Manzanita, sumac, and chaparral
now flourish where two years ago
there grew nothing but wild oats on
the San Juan hills below the homo of
Professor Leroy Abrams, of the Bot
any department. Professor Abrams has
accomplished this transformation on
the San Juan hills where a tract was
reserved from settlement in order to
d
keep the view clear.
In this garden he raises the natural
plants of California, where the soil is
well suited to these shrubs. The gar
den is as yet in an early stage,'and
time will be required to complete Pro
fessor Abrams' plans, since he does
all the work himself. There are al
ready four varieties of manzanita
represented, as well as many forms
of chaparral, and sumac from south
ern California.
