# HUNT TO START VARSITY HOOP TRAINING TODAY
## "Husky" Calls for Intensive Work Following Late Holiday Respite BRANCH FIRST OPPONENT Navigators Game Cancelled Because of Sophomore Week Activities 
### Fred Speers 
Intensive training for the 1926-1927
basketball season will get under way
today when the Stanford varsity takes
up practice again following the holiday
respite. Coach Husky Hunt, in his first
season as Cardinal varsity mentor,
will begin laying the foundations for
his squad from which he hopes to
select a championship team.
First Game Cancelled
The game with the Navigators,
scheduled for December 4, has been
cancelled, due to sophomore week-end
plans which include the play Saturday
and the Cotillion the night before in
the pavilion. It was thought that be
cause of the Cotillion decorations the
pavilion could not be gotten into readi
ness for a basketball game the follow
ing night.
Following the elimination of this
practice game, Stanford's initial clash
will be with the University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch, on Tuesday,
January 4. The dropping of the Navi
gator game does not alter Coach
Hunt's plans, because such an early
season game would mean little other
than an opportunity for an advanced
scrimmage practice.
Football Men Out
With the Stanford-Alabama game a
certainty, Coach Hunt will be com
pelled to forego seeing some of his
varsity mainstays in basketball uni
forms until after the New Year's Day
clash. Men who will be kept at foot
ball practice include Price, Shipkey,
and Vincenti.
Among the experienced men who
will be on hand for this afternoon's
practice will be Captain Nelson David,
Fred Newhouse, and Wally Jayred.
Sophomore players, trained as fresh
men last year by Coach Hunt, will be
on a par with the veterans during the
first period of conditioning and going
over fundamentals. Following this
time, Hunt will be in a position to pre
pare for the regular playing season.
Mitchell Assists Hunt
Assisting the new head mentor is
Howard "Muggs" Mitchell, varsity
player of the past two years. Mitchell
and Hunt handled the squad which
reported at the initial practice two
weeks ago, giving the candidates rudi
mentary training up to the Thanks
giving holidays.
Knowing the value of having fresh
man teams trained in the same system
and plays that the varsity may be
using, Coach Hunt plans to divide his
time between the first-year men and
his varsity squad.

will begin laying the foundations for
his squad from which he hopes to
select a championship team.
First Game Cancelled
The game with the Navigators,
scheduled for December 4, has been
cancelled, due to sophomore week-end
plans which include the play Saturday
and the Cotillion the night before in
the pavilion. It was thought that be
cause of the Cotillion decorations the
pavilion could not be gotten into readi
ness for a basketball game the follow
ing night.
Following the elimination of this
practice game, Stanford's initial clash
will be with the University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch, on Tuesday,
January 4. The dropping of the Navi
gator game does not alter Coach
Hunt's plans, because such an early
season game would mean little other
than an opportunity for an advanced
scrimmage practice.
Football Men Out
With the Stanford-Alabama game a
certainty, Coach Hunt will be com
pelled to forego seeing some of his
varsity mainstays in basketball uni
forms until after the New Year's Day
clash. Men who will be kept at foot
ball practice include Price, Shipkey,
and Vincenti.
Among the experienced men who
will be on hand for this afternoon's
practice will be Captain Nelson David,
Fred Newhouse, and Wally Jayred.
Sophomore players, trained as fresh
men last year by Coach Hunt, will be
on a par with the veterans during the
first period of conditioning and going
over fundamentals. Following this
time, Hunt will be in a position to pre
pare for the regular playing season.
Mitchell Assists Hunt
Assisting the new head mentor is
Howard "Muggs" Mitchell, varsity
player of the past two years. Mitchell
and Hunt handled the squad which
reported at the initial practice two
weeks ago, giving the candidates rudi
mentary training up to the Thanks
giving holidays.
Knowing the value of having fresh
man teams trained in the same system
and plays that the varsity may be
using, Coach Hunt plans to divide his
time between the first-year men and
his varsity squad.
