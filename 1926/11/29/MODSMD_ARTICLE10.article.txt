# YOUNGER MIND UNPREJUDICED, SAYS ICHIHASHI
## Professor Contrasts Student Institute with Meeting At Honolulu ANNUAL AFFAIR PLANNED Race Problems Considered By College People of Eight Countries 
### 
"Tiie younger mind is in a better
position to discuss international prob
lems with unbiased attitude than are
older men and women, as evidenced
by the contrast in discussions of the
Student Institute of Pacific Relations
with those of the Senior Institute,"
says Dr. Yamato Ichihashi, who re
turned yesterday from the first Stu
dent Institute, held at the Montezuma
School during the Thanksgiving holi
days. Dr. Ichihashi is a member of the
Senior Institute held in Honolulu dur
ing the summer of 1025. He attended
the recent conference with Dr. Eliot
G. Mears as an expert.
Affair to Be Annual
Such student institutes will be held
annually in accordance with plans
made yesterday by the Institute, which
has grown out of a demand on the part
of college men and women to exchange
views on problems of the Pacific.
Nearly sixty students attended the
Institute, representing China, India,
Korea, Japan, the Philippine Islands,
Russia, Great Britain, and the United
States.
Stanford representatives included
Kazuo Kawai, head of the conference,
John Duniway, one of the three sec
tion leaders, Roger Barker, Lincoln
Tan, Stewart Nakano, and Barbara
Dewlaney, all members of the execu
tive committee of the conference, Dan
Smith, Louise Shedd, Nellie Shepherd,
Eugene Slien, Tsong-Hsun Tsui, Elea
nor Davidson, Shigeaki Nishimoto,
Alexie Maradudin, Domingo Bermu
dez, Edward Stimpson, Rex Bell, and
Professors Ichihashi and Mears.
Problems Considered
Political, immigration, and economic
problems of the Pacific were consid
ered in three separate groups under
student leadership. During Saturday
night's session of the entire delega
tion, the findings of these groups were
reported. Members of the conference
agreed that the difference in the East
ern philosophy of humanitarianism
and the Western philosophy of eco
nomic superiority is one of the major
underlying causes of conflict.
Three other fundamental conflicts
were tested by the Institute. The first
was individual national development
as against corporate international
growth. The conflict between the
group of industrial, capitalistic na
tions now dominant and the unde
veloped, non-industrial dominated peo
ples, was second. The third question,
of conditioning factors of race and
population expansion, was found to
run through all the problems dis
cussed.
The Institute agreed that the mere
recognition of the facts and conditions
by the interested peoples was the first
step in the direction of their perma
| nent solution, for, according to student
institute members, without recognition
of fundamental conflicts, there can be
no basis of understanding and friend
ship.
Members of the Institute recom
mended co-operation of educators and
educational institutions, especially uni
versities, to direct race understanding,
as one of the important means of
eliminating race prejudice.
