# NEW INVENTION IN ENGINEERING MAKES QUAKES
## DAMAGE IS ELIMINATED Machine Tests Construction Materials for Effect Of Vibrations 
### 
Machine-made earthquakes, created
for the purpose of studying the effects
of seismic temblors upon buildings,
will be the latest device to be used
in the investigation of earth shocks'
now being conducted by the Stanford
School of Engineering.
Carrying out of the enterprise, the
outcome of previous studies of seismic
science at the University, has been
made by a San Francisco donor con
nected with the building industry.
Metal Plane Used
Essentially, the experiments which
«<he engineering department will make
, consist of erecting 011 a heavy move
-1 able metal plane various typical ele
ments of construction work and then
shaking them under various cqntrolled
conditions. The results of the experi
ments will then be translated into
terms applicable to entire structures
of different types and materials.
For example, an upright lattice gir
der will be bolted to the moving base
of the machine. Then the contrivance
will be set in motion and the effects
noted. The 'experiment can be made
with loads on the girder as high as
500 pounds. The data thus obtained,
it is hoped, will be of practical guid
ance and of use in disclosing other in
formation now only partly understood.
Vibrations Studies
Another lUie of investigation is the
relation of the vibration periods of
structures to the resistance of such
structures.to earthquake damage. It
is known, that if the vibration period
of a tall building happens to coincide
closely with that of an earthquake,
the building is much more liable to
damage than if the two vibration
periods were different and thus neu
tralized each other.
Construction of the earthquake ma
chine and the conduct of experiments
to be performed with it is in the hands
of a committee of six, of which Henry
D. Dewell, San Francisco civil engi
neer, is a member. Other observers
are Dean Theodore J. Hoover of the
School of Engineering, and Dr. Bailey
Willis, former head of the Geology
department.
Jacobsen Designer
Design of the machine is largely the
work of Professor Jacobsen, while the
construction work will be carried out
under Professor Domonoske. Dewell
and Professor Moslie will advise and
assist in the structural engineering
j phases of the experiments, and Dean
I Hoover and Dr. Willis will aid in cor
i relating the geologic and engineering
! results.

Machine-made earthquakes, created
for the purpose of studying the effects
of seismic temblors upon buildings,
will be the latest device to be used
in the investigation of earth shocks'
now being conducted by the Stanford
School of Engineering.
Carrying out of the enterprise, the
outcome of previous studies of seismic
science at the University, has been
made by a San Francisco donor con
nected with the building industry.
Metal Plane Used
Essentially, the experiments which
«<he engineering department will make
, consist of erecting 011 a heavy move
-1 able metal plane various typical ele
ments of construction work and then
shaking them under various cqntrolled
conditions. The results of the experi
ments will then be translated into
terms applicable to entire structures
of different types and materials.
For example, an upright lattice gir
der will be bolted to the moving base
of the machine. Then the contrivance
will be set in motion and the effects
noted. The 'experiment can be made
with loads on the girder as high as
500 pounds. The data thus obtained,
it is hoped, will be of practical guid
ance and of use in disclosing other in
formation now only partly understood.
Vibrations Studies
Another lUie of investigation is the
relation of the vibration periods of
structures to the resistance of such
structures.to earthquake damage. It
is known, that if the vibration period
of a tall building happens to coincide
closely with that of an earthquake,
the building is much more liable to
damage than if the two vibration
periods were different and thus neu
tralized each other.
Construction of the earthquake ma
chine and the conduct of experiments
to be performed with it is in the hands
of a committee of six, of which Henry
D. Dewell, San Francisco civil engi
neer, is a member. Other observers
are Dean Theodore J. Hoover of the
School of Engineering, and Dr. Bailey
Willis, former head of the Geology
department.
Jacobsen Designer
Design of the machine is largely the
work of Professor Jacobsen, while the
construction work will be carried out
under Professor Domonoske. Dewell
and Professor Moslie will advise and
assist in the structural engineering
j phases of the experiments, and Dean
I Hoover and Dr. Willis will aid in cor
i relating the geologic and engineering
! results.
