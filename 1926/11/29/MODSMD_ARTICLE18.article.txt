# "CHARM" OFFERS NEW TALENT IN CHARACTERS OF SOPHOMORE PLAY
## Wide Diversity of Character Parts Offer Chance For Good Acting FOURTEEN CAST IN PLAY Ewart Goodwin, â€“ Kathleen Fitz Take Leads in 1929 Class Production 
### 
"The Book of Charm," as typical of
the annual Sophomore Play which has
come to be a regular event on the
Stanford dramatic calendar, is excep
tional in that it is the leading play of
the year in which new talent is given
an opportunity to appear.
"Captain Applejack," "Dulcy," and
; "In the Next Room," of the last three
j years, productions which presented for
i the first time such prominent figures
;in Stanford dramatics as Marjorie
Allen, Aileene Burks, Velma Randall,
and Garth Winslow, were the first
plays which limited cast membership
to students of sophomore standing.
This precedent is followed in the 1926
Sophomore Play, which is to be pro
duced Saturday in connection with the
Cotillion and other activities of Sopho
more Week.
Fourteen roles are included in the
cast of "The Book of Charm," and with
few exceptions will be taken by stu
dents unfamiliar to local audiences.
Excellent opportunity for acting is pro
vided by the wide diversity of char
acters parts offered, as well as by the
straight leads. Tryouts were conducted
over a week's period, and final selec
j tions of the cast were made from a
total turnout of more than one hun
dred members of the sophomore class.
"The Book of Charm," written by
John Kirkpatrick, a young author new
to the theatre, is offered as a satirical
comedy, often carrying over from
straight comedy to broad farce. The
story itself deals with the yearnings
of a young girl in a small southern
town to go to "live and work" in New
York, where summer visitors report
one meets only "charming people."
The means whereby the yearnings of
the heroine-sweet-heart are quelled
form the center of the plot.
Kathleen Fitz as Ida May Hooper,
and Ewart Goodwin as Joe Pond, head
the cast which includes also, Edwina
Ewing, Louise Buxton, Elizabeth Clark,
Janet Harris, Elizabeth Cramer, Clara
Weatherwax, Malcolm Soltan, Sam
Hayes, Irving Frolilich, Tom Thurlow,
George Mott, and Nelson Spinks.
