# Why All-American?

\\ hen football season ends every sports writer and critic throughout
the country seems to think that the public is waiting breathlessly for his
selection of an All-American or All-Section team. So they read a few
exchange papers, sketch a first- and second-string line-up, and send their
choice to press.
Now if a writer wants to be popular with his reading public it is
always best to say the thing that pleases, so there is a pretty fair chance
that in the I odunk paper a couple of Podunk men will be mentioned.
But seriously, unless a critic sees a good many representative teams
play during a season he is hardly justified in making a selection with
gigantic mass of material to draw from. Even though trying his hardest
to be absolutely fair to everyone, it is practically impossible for the
present-day selector to be an unbiased and competent judge. As a
result we are forced to endure as many different combinations as there
are composers of combinations.
Until everyone can agree on one or two men to make the annual
selections it seems absurd to waste the space by printing a hundred and
one opinions.
