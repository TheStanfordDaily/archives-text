# More Smoke

It seems as though the U.S.C. Trojanesses have been discussing the
absurd subject of "co-ed smoking." Anyway, the President of that
institution issued the following edict to the women last week: "There
shall be no smoking at University functions of any kind, or in University
residents, or on the campus." There is nothing out of the ordinary about
a statement like this, but it must have brought great worry to the Daily
Trojan for the columnist in all seriousness contributes the following
which certainly means nothing:
"We have never wanted to write on this matter of co-ed
smoking. But under the present circumstances, if we arc to
meet the obligations of a column like this, we must put the thing
as we see it. In one sense, for a woman to smoke or not may
be a moral isssue. If it is true that by so doing she does herself
physical harm that prevents her from becoming the best kind
of a wife and mother, she had better think twice before she
forms a useless habit. If it does not affect her health, it would
seem to be a matter of personal taste. As a personal matter, we
do not like to see women smoke. Our reason is old-fashioned
and we admit it. It simply does not look good. But whether
or not it is wrong we leave to the physician. We wish that the
medical fraternity would get together on this and give us some
thing authoritative."
All of which brings to memory the fact that, day by day, people arc
losing the privilege of thinking and deciding for themselves. There is
always someone who wants to meddle in personal matters and say
whether they shall be done or shall not be done. In reality it is all a
farceâ€”women who want to smoke will keep right on puffing away.
