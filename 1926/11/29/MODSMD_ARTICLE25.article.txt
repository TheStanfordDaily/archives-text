A COPY OF A LETTER SENT TO j
THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
Pedagogues are clamoring for a new j
cabinet office-holder to be known as '
"Secretary of Education."
There is not the slightest reason for j
such an office. If the pedagogues could j
have all the money spent in the vari- j
ous ways for which they are scheming,
there would be but little left for any
thing else. They are shameless in their
disregard oi the buidtui borne by the
oppressed taxpayers.
If we had a Secretary of Education
he would be supplied with an army
of lackeys to be added to the vast
number of office-holders who are now
sapping the life of the nation.
A speaker called attention to the
fact that all the known gold in the
world would barely pay the cost of
government in our country for a single
year.
He also showed that before the Civil
War there was but one person on the
payroll of the taxpayers to every thou
sand engaged in business or industry;
that at the time of Cleveland's admin
istration there was one to every hun
dred so engaged; while now our coun
try is afflicted by having a person on
the payroll of the taxpayers to every
fifteen engaged in business or indus
try. .
It used to be said that every man in
Germany went to work with a soldier
on his back. If we keep on adding to j
the office-holding class it will not be j
long before every man in this country
will go to work bearing on his back j
the burden of an office-holder. I
All over our land should go up an
earnest cry of the beleaguered tax
payers, beseeching the legislators not
only to add to their burden by creat
ing new offices, but to bring the sadly
needed relief by reducing the number
of persons on the payroll of the tax
payers to one-quarter, if not to one
tenth of what it is now.

Now that you have read the above
letter (if you have managed to get
this far without reading it, you have
cheated and should be penalized seven
column inches) we will tell you what
we think of the author, A. B. See.
In the first place, A. B. See is a
pest. In the second place, he is an
annoying pest, because he has a cer
tain amount of right on Ms eldc. In
the third place, he is a particularly
annoying pest because he mentions
only those angles of his argument
which give him the advantage.
To concentrate on the last point.
A. B. See makes his first mistake in
assuming that the educators of this
money-mad country know anything
about money. The fact that they do
not is clearly and amply demonstrated
by the manner in which they neglect
their own capacity for earning money.
To put the remainder of the argument
in the well-known nutshell, A. B. See
has made the favorite error of people
who write to Congress to settle na
tional problems, i.e., he has "muffed"
the main issue.
As we said before, the annoying part
about A. B. See's letter is the fact that
he has a certain amount of right on
his side. That is to say, A. B. See is
right in assuming that we need no
national secretary of education. He is
wrong in that every reason he gives
for opposing the appointment of such
a secretary is entirely wrong.
The reason that such a secretary
should not be appointed is that the
voting body of the United States of
America has proven itself entirely in
capable of administering to the wants
and needs of the youth of the land.
For the benefit of those few indi
viduals who need detailed explanation
of this thesis, let us suggest that they
either work it out for themselves, or
go in off the deep end. We are ex
tremely sleepy and have no time for
explaining the obvious.

All over our land should go up an

of persons on the payroll of the tax
payers to one-quarter, if not to one

Now that you have read the above
letter (if you have managed to get
this far without reading it, you have
cheated and should be penalized seven
column inches) we will tell you what
we think of the author, A. B. See.
In the first place, A. B. See is a
pest. In the second place, he is an
annoying pest, because he has a cer
tain amount of right on Ms eldc. In
the third place, he is a particularly
annoying pest because he mentions
only those angles of his argument
which give him the advantage.
To concentrate on the last point.
A. B. See makes his first mistake in
assuming that the educators of this
money-mad country know anything
about money. The fact that they do
not is clearly and amply demonstrated
by the manner in which they neglect
their own capacity for earning money.
To put the remainder of the argument
in the well-known nutshell, A. B. See
has made the favorite error of people
who write to Congress to settle na
tional problems, i.e., he has "muffed"
the main issue.
As we said before, the annoying part
about A. B. See's letter is the fact that
he has a certain amount of right on
his side. That is to say, A. B. See is
right in assuming that we need no
national secretary of education. He is
wrong in that every reason he gives
for opposing the appointment of such
a secretary is entirely wrong.
The reason that such a secretary
should not be appointed is that the
voting body of the United States of
America has proven itself entirely in
capable of administering to the wants
and needs of the youth of the land.
For the benefit of those few indi
viduals who need detailed explanation
of this thesis, let us suggest that they
either work it out for themselves, or
go in off the deep end. We are ex
tremely sleepy and have no time for
explaining the obvious.
