"LAVINIA AND THE DEVIL," by
Camilla York, New York. E. P.
Dutton & Co.
"To champagne and crackers and
all who appreciate them properly," is
the dedication to be found on the fly
leaf of .Camilla York's "Lavinia and
the Devil." If appreciating champagne
may be taken to mean imbibing
enough of that well-known fluid to be
come entirely oblivious to everything
which makes a book readable, the
dedication is extremely well put. Per
sons in such a state might enjoy the j
new York novel.
The story, intended —according to I
the publishers' note on the cover —to j
be "demure, exquisite, alluring, saucy, 1
spicy, intriguing," succeeds only in!
being poorly written, with impossible j
characters, a colossally absurd plot,
and conversation between the princi
pals which sounds like a cross be
tween that of a "College Humor"
story, and a two-for-a-cent playwright's
idea of the talk in higher English so
ciety.
As nearly as we could make out the
story seems to do with Lavinia, half j
Irish and half Austrian, who has tons i
of money, with "The Devil," Princess '
Debelowsky, the usual snaky, mysteri-!
ous, altogether alluring, Muscovite ad-!
venturess, and with Peter, who also |
has tons of money, is English, and '
faces a brilliant career in the foreign '
service. There are, of course, enough
of the necessary additional English
men, Americans, Austrians, and Rus
sians to give the tale a thoroughly
cosmopolitan and continental air,
which smacks of intrigue from start
to finish.
Peter spends the first thirty-three
chapters wavering between the nice
Lavinia and the naughty "Devil" until
at last he succeeds in getting the lat
ter and spending an unconventional,
prenuptial honeymoon with her in
Brussells, where her glamour pales,
leaving him contrite and unreasonably
nasty to everyone,
With the same caddishness which
has characterized him throughout the
story, Peter flies into a rage at being
made a fool of and postpones the
happy reunion for a few chapters. It i
is at last effected, however, and every- j
thing ends rosily.
The story, taken from the stand \
point of style, characterization, etc., is >
at best mediocre, but the plot is an
insult to average intelligence. It might,
be suggested as an interesting bad
example for a course in comparative
novel reading. —R S.

which smacks of intrigue from start
to finish.
Peter spends the first thirty-three
chapters wavering between the nice
Lavinia and the naughty "Devil" until
at last he succeeds in getting the lat
ter and spending an unconventional,
prenuptial honeymoon with her in
Brussells, where her glamour pales,
leaving him contrite and unreasonably
nasty to everyone,
With the same caddishness which
has characterized him throughout the
story, Peter flies into a rage at being
made a fool of and postpones the
happy reunion for a few chapters. It i
is at last effected, however, and every- j
thing ends rosily.
The story, taken from the stand \
point of style, characterization, etc., is >
at best mediocre, but the plot is an
insult to average intelligence. It might,
be suggested as an interesting bad
example for a course in comparative
novel reading. —R S.
"LAVINIA AND THE DEVIL," by
Camilla York, New York. E. P.
Dutton & Co.
"To champagne and crackers and
all who appreciate them properly," is
the dedication to be found on the fly
leaf of .Camilla York's "Lavinia and
the Devil." If appreciating champagne
may be taken to mean imbibing
enough of that well-known fluid to be
come entirely oblivious to everything
which makes a book readable, the
dedication is extremely well put. Per
sons in such a state might enjoy the j
new York novel.
The story, intended —according to I
the publishers' note on the cover —to j
be "demure, exquisite, alluring, saucy, 1
spicy, intriguing," succeeds only in!
being poorly written, with impossible j
characters, a colossally absurd plot,
and conversation between the princi
pals which sounds like a cross be
tween that of a "College Humor"
story, and a two-for-a-cent playwright's
idea of the talk in higher English so
ciety.
As nearly as we could make out the
story seems to do with Lavinia, half j
Irish and half Austrian, who has tons i
of money, with "The Devil," Princess '
Debelowsky, the usual snaky, mysteri-!
ous, altogether alluring, Muscovite ad-!
venturess, and with Peter, who also |
has tons of money, is English, and '
faces a brilliant career in the foreign '
service. There are, of course, enough
of the necessary additional English
men, Americans, Austrians, and Rus
sians to give the tale a thoroughly
cosmopolitan and continental air,
which smacks of intrigue from start
to finish.
