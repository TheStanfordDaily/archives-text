# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
And furthermore we have—
Oh Encina, Ah Encina,
Are you trying to compete
With the rising cost of living—
With what we get to eat.
The breakfast in the mornings
Causes wild and viscious roarings
At the food you often offer us to eat —
Our endurance is surprising,
But we're all for compromising.
On the food you often offer us to eat.
Sometimes my digestion
Just rebels at the suggestion
Of the food you often offer us to eat.
Ah! the qualms and quaky feelings
Caused by lost potato peelings
In the spinach that you offer us to eat.
So Encina, Oh Encina,
Lest you witness our defeat,
Give us food that is more edible —
Some grub that we can eat. —G.F.O.
