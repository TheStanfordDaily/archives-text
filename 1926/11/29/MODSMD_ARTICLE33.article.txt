# EASY EXTERMINATION OF MALARIA DISEASE FORECAST BY JORDAN
## Use of Gambusia Fish for Mosquito Consumption Urged in Article 
### 
Malaria can be easily exterminated
by means of the Gambusia fish that
eats malaria-carrying mosquitoes, says
Dr. Jordan in an article that appeared
recently in "The Scientific American."
He introduced this fish to Hawaii in
1904, he says, with the result that
there is hardly a mosquito in the
islands today.
"Old travelers may remember that
Hawaii, twenty and more years ago,
was cursed by mosquitoes. Large ones
brought from Alaska by whalers in
their water tubs in the days when
Hawaii was their chosen winter resort,
ruled the islands by day, and a smaller
one, probably from California, was
listened to at night," Dr. Jordan says.
Mark Twain Had Remedy
"Mark Twain, at the old Hawaiian
Hotel, felt this grievance, and in a
characteristic way set out to remedy
it. Everyone slept at night under a
mosquito canopy and every night
some of the smaller insects crept
through the meshes. Mark waited one
night until all the mosquitoes came
in through the netting and then
slipped out and slept on the floor."
In 1904 the City of Honolulu asked
Dr. Jordan to discover and send to
the islands a fish that would eat mos
quitoes. The pests can be extermi
nated by getting rid of their breeding
place or by covering them with oil,
but there are many bodies of water
where neither of these methods can
be used. In such cases the mosquito
eating fish are the best resort, accord
ing to Dr. Jordan. "A good many kinds
of little fish will eat mosquito eggs or
larvae when they find them conven
ient," he says. "Sticklebacks, young
trout, some minnows, even gold fish,
do this to some extent. But what is
needed is a kind of fish that makes
mosquito-killing its chief business,
which enters on it with alacrity and
which will not or cannot harm other
more choice kinds of fish."
Seale Secured Fish
Dr. Jordan sent Alvin Seale, then a
senior at Stanford and now superin
tendent of the Steinhart Aquarium in
San Francisco, to Louisiana to go to
the bayous and test out three species
of fish for the purpose. An epidemic
of yellow fever was raging in New
Orleans. Seale went to Galveston to
get the chosen fish, and shipped them
to Honolulu.
Arrived there, each species was
tested out in aquarium tanks in drug
store windows, each one filled with
stagnant water and stocked with mo
squito eggs. Two of the species
showed little interest, but the third,
Gambusia patruelis, cleared the water
of both eggs and wrigglers. Dr. Jordan
says that this fish is, without doubt,
the greatest mosquito-killer in exist
ence. "It has lived and multiplied in
all available waters in Hawaii. It
swarms in irrigation ditches and in
pools in the rice fields. It does not
migrate to the sea, and it does not
attack other fishes."
Gambusia Needed
From Honolulu the Gambusia has
been taken to Japan and the Philip
pine Islands. Although a native of
warm regions, it thrives in colder cli
mates and in the winter lives in the
mud bottoms to keep warm. It flour
ishes in gutters and ditches, Jordan
says, which would make it most de
sirable to introduce to the mosquito
ridden countries around the Mediter
ranean and Black Sea.
"It would be easy to transfer a few
tanks of them to Greece or Sicily or
the Crimea," writes Jordan. "With this
little fish active in the pools and
swamps of southern Europe, thousands
of lives could be saved, and millions
of others rescued from perennial
misery."
