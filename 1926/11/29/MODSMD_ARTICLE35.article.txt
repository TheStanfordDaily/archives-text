Reforms Suggested
Reforms have been suggested in
several places to check abuses of the
insanity plea. In England it is now
used only for capital cases. The State
of Washington attempted to abolish
the use of the insanity defense, but
the statute was declared not consti
tutional.
In California the state commission
for legal reforms recommended an al
ternative proposal separating the trial
on the charge and the trial on the plea
of insanity, the latter to follow the
regular trial.
