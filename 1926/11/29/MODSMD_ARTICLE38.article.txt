# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Walter Eckersall went to the Uni
versity of Chicago with a fine reputa
tion as a high school football player.
He more than made good in his four
years in college; in fact, his fame is
so great, that to this day, he is known
as "The Greatest of Quarter-backs."
And since his graduation in the spring
of 1907, Eckersall has continued to add
to his reputation by becoming a ca
pable football official and a brilliant
sports writer.
Walter's first appearance in connec
tion with the game of football was as
a water-boy at the Carlisle-Illinois
game in 1897. Later, as a student at
Hyde Park High School in Chicago,
he was twice captain of the team and
had the thrill of helping to defeat the
University of Chicago in 1901 and of
swamping Brooklyn Poly 105 to 0 in
an East-West interscholastic game in
1902.
In his college career he became, with
Willie Heston, of Michigan, the great
est football-player of the West, and
his all-around work so attracted the
attention of the late Walter Camp that
he was chosen for that famous expert's
All-American team three times. Be-

] sides being a star broken-field runner, ;
a brilliant drop-kicker and punter, and \
i a fine defensive player, he was a great j
! field general, and it is too bad that he I
didn't have a chance to play in the |
modern open game. The wonder of;
it is that he did so well, for he'
weighed less than 150 pounds, and !
starred in the days of mass plays and
1 bone-crushing giants.
Among "Eckie's" gridiron accomp
lishments while at Chicago were the
| following: a 45-yard field goal and
. two 75-yard runs for touch-downs in !
his first conference game with Indiana.
Five field goals and one touch-down
I against Illinois in 1905, and five field
j goals and many successful forward
| passes to Steffen against Nebraska
in 1906. A 95-yard run to a touch-down
j from the kick-off against lowa, and a
107-yard run to a touch-down from a
j fumble against Texas, in 1904. Against ;
I Wisconsin he kicked three field goals !
!in 1903, made a 110-yard run for a !
; touch-down from the kick-off in 1904,
| and beat them with a field goal on a
j muddy field in 1905. He stopped the;
great Heston many times and once !
scored a touch-down against Michigan !
after a fumble by Heston.
