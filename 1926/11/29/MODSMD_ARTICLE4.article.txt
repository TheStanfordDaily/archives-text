WASHINGTON, D.C., Uov. 19—(By
Mail) —Of interest to our Stanford
athletics i3 the matter of America
being represented with a Rugby Foot
bn!) Tonat tivc Hcal Olympic Games
scheduled for 1928. The Stanford rep
resentative to the convention was in
formed by General Charles H. Sberrill,
member of the International Olympic
Sports Committee, and who has but
recently returned from Europe, where
he went in the interest' of America's
participation in the next Olympic
Games, that America would be repre
sented with a Rugby Football Team.
The writer talked the matter over at
length with the newly-elected officers
of the Olympic Association and Games
Committee, and they all felt that as
America won the Olympic Rugby Foot- i
ball Championship in 1920 and again
in 1924 —that the sporting thing to do j
would be to have a team ready to de-1
fend the championship in 1928.
Applications Suggested
With this in mind the writer was
asked to consult with those in control
of matters at Stanford, asking that
they make formal application to the
newly-elected executive body of .the i

( Olympic Games Committee for a blan
| ket sanction to arrange the details
and have charge of the gathering to
gether the Rugby material necessary
j to make up the personnel of a sound
Rugby Team.
It was felt by the above committee
• that as Stanford University was a
j member of the Olympic Association
paying annual dues in the interest of
Rugby, that S'anford should be the
prime mover in arranging for such a
! team.
The application for sanction or au
thority to carry out the project rela
tive to an Olympic Rugby Team must,
or would, naturally come through our
1 Board of Athletic Control.
i As in the past, part of the expense
' which the sending of such a team
would entail, will be mot by the Olym
pic Committee, the balance through
' popular subscription to such a fund
by our sport-loving people on the
j coast,
