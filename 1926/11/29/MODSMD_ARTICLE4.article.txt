WASHINGTON, D.C., Uov. 19—(By
Mail) —Of interest to our Stanford
athletics i3 the matter of America
being represented with a Rugby Foot
bn!) Tonat tivc Hcal Olympic Games
scheduled for 1928. The Stanford rep
resentative to the convention was in
formed by General Charles H. Sberrill,
member of the International Olympic
Sports Committee, and who has but
recently returned from Europe, where
he went in the interest' of America's
participation in the next Olympic
Games, that America would be repre
sented with a Rugby Football Team.
The writer talked the matter over at
length with the newly-elected officers
of the Olympic Association and Games
Committee, and they all felt that as
America won the Olympic Rugby Foot- i
ball Championship in 1920 and again
in 1924 —that the sporting thing to do j
would be to have a team ready to de-1
fend the championship in 1928.
Applications Suggested
With this in mind the writer was
asked to consult with those in control
of matters at Stanford, asking that
they make formal application to the
newly-elected executive body of .the i

( Olympic Games Committee for a blan
| ket sanction to arrange the details
and have charge of the gathering to
gether the Rugby material necessary
j to make up the personnel of a sound
Rugby Team.
It was felt by the above committee
• that as Stanford University was a
j member of the Olympic Association
paying annual dues in the interest of
Rugby, that S'anford should be the
prime mover in arranging for such a
! team.
The application for sanction or au
thority to carry out the project rela
tive to an Olympic Rugby Team must,
or would, naturally come through our
1 Board of Athletic Control.
i As in the past, part of the expense
' which the sending of such a team
would entail, will be mot by the Olym
pic Committee, the balance through
' popular subscription to such a fund
by our sport-loving people on the
j coast,
Maloney Honored
j The writer had the honor of being
• one of five who constituted the nomi
nating committee which selected the
officers who will have charge of
America's participation in the Games;
such included the heads of the dift'er-
ent committees. It is pleasing to know
that the entire selection of the nomi
nating committee was afterward ap
proved and ratified by the delegates
assembled.
The Stanford representative was
again honored, along with Mr. William
Humphrey, President of the Olympic
Club, San Francisco, together with
Robert Weaver of Los Angeles, past
National President A.A.U., by being
elected a member of the Olympic
Games Committee. This committee
consists of nine, the members of which
cover the entire country from coast
to coast. . ,
The delegates present at the con
vention had the honor of being re
ceived by President Coolidge, who is
Honorary President of the American
Olympic Association. President Cool
idge is showing a very marked inter
est in the coming Olympic Games,
feeling as he does, that it is through
such events, coming as they do every
four years, that much good is done in
bringing about a sound and healthy
feeling between the athletes of Amer
ica and those of other nations; not
only a better understanding between
the participants in such events, but
the people in general.
Placed on Committees
During both conventions which I
have attended, the one in Baltimore
and again here in Washington, I was
placed on so many sub-committees I
not only sat in session most of each
day, but also most of each night, get
ting together reports, etc., for the day
session.
After entering the hotel in Balti
more in which the convention was held
I did not get a peep of the outdoors
until the convention was at an end.
One hour later we were on our way to
Washington. Naturally at this time
my thoughts go out to those fine young
Stanford men who will be called upon
tomorrow — Saturday — to represent
Stanford in the classic football event
of the year.
I will be anxiously awaiting the flash
that will come across the continent
and which will carry the joyous news
that dear old Stanford has again been
victorious.

Placed on Committees
During both conventions which I
have attended, the one in Baltimore
and again here in Washington, I was
placed on so many sub-committees I
not only sat in session most of each

session.

I did not get a peep of the outdoors

One hour later we were on our way to
Washington. Naturally at this time
my thoughts go out to those fine young
Stanford men who will be called upon
tomorrow — Saturday — to represent
Stanford in the classic football event
of the year.
I will be anxiously awaiting the flash

and which will carry the joyous news

The delegates present at the con
vention had the honor of being re
ceived by President Coolidge, who is
Honorary President of the American
Olympic Association. President Cool
idge is showing a very marked inter
est in the coming Olympic Games,
feeling as he does, that it is through
such events, coming as they do every
four years, that much good is done in
bringing about a sound and healthy
feeling between the athletes of Amer
ica and those of other nations; not
only a better understanding between
the participants in such events, but
the people in general.
Placed on Committees
During both conventions which I
have attended, the one in Baltimore
and again here in Washington, I was
placed on so many sub-committees I
not only sat in session most of each
day, but also most of each night, get
ting together reports, etc., for the day
session.
After entering the hotel in Balti
more in which the convention was held
I did not get a peep of the outdoors
until the convention was at an end.
One hour later we were on our way to
Washington. Naturally at this time
my thoughts go out to those fine young
Stanford men who will be called upon
tomorrow — Saturday — to represent
Stanford in the classic football event
of the year.
I will be anxiously awaiting the flash
that will come across the continent
and which will carry the joyous news
that dear old Stanford has again been
victorious.
