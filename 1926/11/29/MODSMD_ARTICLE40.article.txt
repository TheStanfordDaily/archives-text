# Tobacco Unpopular Among Freshmen at Ohio State
## 
### 
Tobacco is not used by college men
as much as the public thinks, if sta
tistics gathered from the freshman
class at Ohio State can be accepted
as a criterion. Out of a total of 2184
men, only 35 per cent, or 770 men, use
tobacco in any form.
Of the total number of tobacco users,
4:50 are cigaret smokers, 289 smoke
the collegiate pipe, 45 prefer cigars,
and 6 confess to chewing.
