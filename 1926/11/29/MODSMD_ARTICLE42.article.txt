# ROTH PREDICTS NEW BRIDGE ON PORTOLAWOODSIDE ROADWAY
## San Mateo County Official Promises Support for Building Structure 
### 
Prospects of a new bridge on the
Woodside-Portola road spanning San
Francisquito Creek have come to the
fore following a conference last week
between Comptroller A.E. Roth repre
senting the University, and Supervisor
John Macßain of San Mateo county,
in which the San Mateo official prom
ised the support of his district for
construction of a new bridge.
The project will now be referred to
Supervisor C. P. Cooley of Santa Clara
county for the approval of his con
stituency. The latter has been quoted
as saying that his district in Santa
Clara county would be willing to stand
its portion of the cost.
The present bridge has long been in
a dangerous, decrepit state. Not only
the bridge itself, but the approach to
it from the east side are hazardous,
fatal accidents regularly occurring at
the sharp curve leading to the span.
The need of a new bridge has for
years been violently contended by all
■who are obliged to use it, but con
struction has been hindered by diffi
culties connected with uniting the
three interested parties as to the pro
posed location and distribution of
costs.
Comptroller Roth stated last night
that the bridge should soon be an
actuality, as the problem of co-opera
tion has apparently been solved.
