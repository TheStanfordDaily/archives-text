# HUNGARIAN PROFESSOR ATTACKS MODERN LIFE
## 
### 
"Orgy of face-painting, dressless
ness, and idle dances," is the charac
terization of modern society made by
the professor of ethics at the Great
Catholic Convent in Budapest. Hun
gary, in October.. According to him
modern clothes are not practicable and
they show no taste; they are only
meant to excite our lower feelings. He
said, "We nowadays see luxury which
lias nearly attained that of Poppeca,
who bathed daily in the milk of 500
donkeys, or that of Nero's wife, or
stupid Pompeiian women, who painted
their eye-lashes with ant-eggs, used
bear-fat for their hair and undulated
it with owl's blood, and who put six
teen rings on their fingers."
I The Doctor said he saw deplorable
results in the falling to pieces of
modern family life. "We read in Sen
eca that the chief society women did
not count the years according to the
consuls but according to who was
their husband for that year," he said,
and added that much the same is true
today.
"Nowadays youth is greatly inter
ested in memorizing the streets of
Hollywood, and knowing who Astra
Neilsen, Pola Negri, Max Linder, Ru
dolph Valentino, Dempsey, and Nurmi
are, but they can't answer questions in
geography, history, science, and art,"
lie concluded.
