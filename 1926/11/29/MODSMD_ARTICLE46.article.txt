# CHURCH INFLUENCE IN STATE WORK IS PRIZE ESSAY TOPIC
## 
### 
"It is our purpose to acquaint the
people, and particularly the younger
generation of America with the men
ace which results from the connection
of church and state," declares Joseph
Lewis, president of the Freethinkers'
Society oÂ£ New York. He makes this
statement in announcing a prize con
test of the best essays on "The Past
and Future Menace of Ecclesiastical
Influence over Social, Intellectual and
Political Affairs."
He points out that if church authori
ties can supervise the training of chil
dren until (hey are seven years of age,
they would have no fear of them ever
changing their convictions. "History
shows that the greatest conflicts, the
most bitter controversies, and the most
devastating wars have resulted when
the church and the civil power have
combined, and especially when the
state has permitted the church to dic
tate in matters of government," he
states further.
The contest is open to all students
of high schools and colleges in the
United States; the prizes, aggregating
$250, will be awarded as follows: first
prize, $100; second prize, $50; third
prize, $50; fourth prize, $25, and fifth
prize, $25. The manuscripts must be
addressed to "Essay Contest Editor,
Freethinkers' Society of New York,
1658 Broadway, New York City." They
must be typed and must not be less
than 2000 words. The closing date for
acceptance is December 31, 1926.
