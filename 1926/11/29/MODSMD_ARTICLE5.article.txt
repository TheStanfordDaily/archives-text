a paper on the "shoe-string" plan, put
ting comparatively little money into

circulation. He had an opportunity to
carry out his idea about seven years
ago, when, with Robert Patterson of
the Chicago Tribune, he started a
tabloid, hiring two rooms and the
presses of the Evening Mail. The cir

grew to 170,000 at which time Clark
left it.
He was recently the editor of the
,San Francisco Chronicle, leaving when
his health failed him. Last March he
