# Embargo on Curling Irons Lifted at Ohio Wesleyan
## 
### 
Waves, curls, and ringlets will soon
be displayed by many on the Ohio
Wesleyan University campus since the
campus embargo on curling irons has
been lifted. Since 1853 the Wesleyan
deans of women have held that the
curling iron is a very dangerous wea
pon, not only capable of causing the
ruination of a sweet and girlish beauty
campus.
