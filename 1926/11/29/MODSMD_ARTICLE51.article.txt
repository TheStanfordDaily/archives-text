# PROFESSOR H.D.GRAY HEADS PACIFIC COAST PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY
## 
### 
Professor Henry D. Gray of Stan
ford was elected president of the
Philological Association of the Pacific
Coast for 1926-1927 at the closing
meeting of the twenty-eighth session
of the body held here last Friday and
Saturday. Other Stanford professors
elected to offices were Professor Er
nest Whitney Martin, vice-president,
and Professor Aurelio M. Espinosa,
member of the executive committee.
About 40 faculty members of Pacific
Coast universities heard papers pre
sented on various themes, five of
which Stanford professors contributed.
"Hothouse Words vs. Slang" was
the subject treated by Professor Ar
thur G. Kennedy of the English de
partment. From a ITt'uUT" t>T Blount's
Glossographia (1656) he concluded
that although slang is relatively ephe
meral, the old hothouse words repre
sent a phase of word-growth even less
enduring.
Professor Frances Russell of the
same department presented a biblio
graphy of the Utopian theme in litera
ture; Professor Henry R. Fairclough
of the Classical Literature department
discussed "The Classical Element in
the Works of Edwin Arlington Robin
son." Professor William 1). Briggs also
presented a paper.
Types of books read in the English
colonies of North America were dis
cussed by Professor Howard J. Hall
of the English department as a means
for finding a measurable basis of
American culture. In this period he
notes a "surprising uniformity in the
classes of books in various libraries â€”
Harvard College, the ministers' li
braries, and on the shelves of laymen
and of booksellers."
