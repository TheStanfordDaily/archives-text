system has recently failed at the Uni
versity of California, a plan for an
"honor court" has been accepted and
passed on by the student executive
j committee of the University of South
| ern California, and is now up for
i approval of President Von Kleinsmid.
! The tentative system provides that
I
j any student seeing another cheat in
; the classroom may turn in the stu
