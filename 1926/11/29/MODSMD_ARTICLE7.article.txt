# CARDINALS STAND AS STRONG BIDDER FOR NATIONAL GRID TITLE
## Alabama, Lafayette Remain Undefeated; Notre Dame Upset Startling 
### 
Stanford, Alabama, and Lafayette
remain the major contenders for the
national football title as a result of
last week's play-offs, and notably the
19-0 upset of Notre Dame at the hands
of Carnegie Tech. The title claims of
the Navy eleven, however, are still on
solid foundation by virtue of victories
over all Eastern rivals in spite of the
spectacular 21-21 tie Saturday with the
Army. Had the midshipmen won Sat
urday, they would have cinched East
l ern title honors and ranked with the
; first-named three leading colleges for
I the championship.
Lafayette secured its standing as the
' only Eastern eleven with neither a tie
nor a defeat when Brown forfeited its
: claims by a 10-10 tie with Colgate,
j Alabama, by a decisive victory over
Georgia Slate, annexed the Southern
i title for the third consecutive season
without defeat.
On the coast, the University of
1 Southern California is rated second
only to Stanford. Washington State
and the Oregon Aggies, each with four
| victories and one defeat credited to
i them, are tied for third place. Wash
ington and Idaho ended the season in
the next two positions, leaving Cali
| fornia and Montana at the foot of the
i column without a single conference
i victory.
; With the Stanford-Alabama game at
Pasadena still a matter of conjecture,
it appears that fans will have to ac
cept the present "national standings"
unless a victory by either team on
New Year's Day gives it a stronger
i claim.
