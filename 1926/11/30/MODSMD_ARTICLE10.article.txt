# JUNIORS GIVEN EDGE OVER SOPHOMORES IN INTERCLASS HOCKEY
## 
### 
Junior women are conceded the edge
over the sophomores in the champion
ship series hockey game to he played
this afternoon at 4:20 o'clock on Roble
field, both on the hasis of comparative
scores and a consideration of relative
strength. The two teams have each
won their one regular season game.
The 1928 machine played poorly the
day it defeated the sophomores 3 to 2
in a practice game. On the other
hand, the underclass team was having
one of its depressions on that day.and
has shown much better form in later
games.
If the juniors win today's game,
they will have a practically clear road
to the title, their only remaining op
ponent being the senior team, which
is under the handicap of playing short
handed this season, and therefore will
not present a very serious threat to
the third-year combination.
Should the sophomores win today,
they would have a less easy road to
supremacy, judging by the practice
scries, in which they were defeated
by Jhe freshmen, who would be their
last opponents. If the sophomores de
feat the juniors, however, they will
probably be strong euough to over
come the freshmen.
