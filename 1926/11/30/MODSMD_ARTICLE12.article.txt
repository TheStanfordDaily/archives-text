# SOPHOMORE CAGERS TROUNCE FRESHMEN IN INTERCLASS PLAY
## Fast Play Gives Opening Game to '29 Despite Strong Opposition 
### 
j By playing a faster brand of basket- !
ball in the second half, the first-string
i sophomore cage team was able to j
: wrest a game, seemingly lost, from
j the freshman team in the first series '
of games of the interclass tournament
i yesterday. The final score was 18-25
in favor of the twenty-niners. The
I freshman second team won from the
! sophomore seconds by the score of
| 13-8.
The babe cagers started out the
I first-team game in a sure and even
pace and played circles around the
; sophomores, the score at the end of
J the half being 12-4 in favor of the
first-year men. The yearlings were
able to meet all the fast spurts that the
twenty-nine team could muster, and
the game seemed to be stowed away
on ice.
The inability of sophomore bas
keteers to register their shots explains
the reason why they were holding the
low 'end of the score when the second
half whistle blew.
It was during the second half that
the twenty-nine men displayed some i
basketball ability. McCandless, the tall j
sophomore center, went wild and j
counted seven baskets for his team. ;
| The yearlings fought hard but were
■ to cope with the superior
j height and fast-playing exhibited by
their opponents. The work of Berg at
| forward and Nye at guard was com
j mendable for the freshmen.
Although the game lagged in spots
' and not a great amount of basketball
! science was shown, two facts were
; brought out: the babe team will make
1 any opponent it faces in the future
| fight to win, and though the sopho
| mores were able to get a victory they
j will have to play a tighter brand of
! basketball if they wish to come out at
. the top of the interclass series,
j In the second-team game the year
lings had everything their own way,
I even when the sophomores substituted
j some of their first-team men in the last
| half in hope of turning the "green
tide." Petrick showed best form for
the freshmen and Sylvestri starred for
' the twenty-niners.
This afternoon the junior team will
! tangle with the senior team at Encina
gymnasium at 4:15 o'clock. The second
i string men for both classes will play
I first, and the first team game will
1 follow immediately after, stated
i Charles W. Davis, director.

j By playing a faster brand of basket- !
ball in the second half, the first-string
i sophomore cage team was able to j
: wrest a game, seemingly lost, from
j the freshman team in the first series '
of games of the interclass tournament
i yesterday. The final score was 18-25
in favor of the twenty-niners. The
I freshman second team won from the
! sophomore seconds by the score of
| 13-8.
The babe cagers started out the
I first-team game in a sure and even
pace and played circles around the
; sophomores, the score at the end of
J the half being 12-4 in favor of the
first-year men. The yearlings were
able to meet all the fast spurts that the
twenty-nine team could muster, and
the game seemed to be stowed away
on ice.
The inability of sophomore bas
keteers to register their shots explains
the reason why they were holding the
low 'end of the score when the second
half whistle blew.
It was during the second half that
the twenty-nine men displayed some i
basketball ability. McCandless, the tall j
sophomore center, went wild and j
counted seven baskets for his team. ;
| The yearlings fought hard but were

j height and fast-playing exhibited by
their opponents. The work of Berg at
| forward and Nye at guard was com
j mendable for the freshmen.
Although the game lagged in spots
' and not a great amount of basketball
! science was shown, two facts were
; brought out: the babe team will make
1 any opponent it faces in the future
| fight to win, and though the sopho
| mores were able to get a victory they
j will have to play a tighter brand of
