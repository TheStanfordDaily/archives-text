# VARSITY BASKETBALL TEAM GOES THROUGH FIRST SIMPLE PLAYS
## Coach Husky Hunt Expects To Make Cut in Squad On Wednesday 
### Fred Speers 
j More than forty candidates for vnr
i sily basketball worked out yesterday
under Coach Hunt in the first prac
| tice since the holiday respite of t«toe
I past week-end. Light practice on sim
j pie plays formed the main program of
J yesterday's session.
j Coach Hunt expects to make the
j first cut in his squad Wednesday and
I will eliminate fifteen or more from the
j list of men. That done, the new Cardi
nal mentor will be in a better position
to place practice 011 a more intensive
Plane. He will then be able to experi-
J ment with various combinations with
j the asurance that his material is ex
j perienced and capable.
Last night's workout saw one set of
| five men who w.orked well together 011
; the practice plays handed them. The
lineup consisted of Captain Nelson
David and Elmer Riese, forwards;
Wally Jayred, center; Bill Clark, run
ning guard; and Albert Biaggini,
standing guard.
Though these men played but a
short time in all, each looked well in
his berth. Riese especially showed
speed for this early in the season. Of
these five Captain David seems to be
the only basket-shooter yet in togs.
Jayred's playing in the practice was
heady and capable as was that of
Biaginni, who looks to be the best bet
for standing guard.
Neither Ned Anderson nor Fred
Newhouse have reported for practice
which has now been going on for two
weeks. The football squad has drawn
the attention of several other varsity
men, so Coach Hunt has not yet all
his material to work with.
Speaking of the prospects, Coach
Hunt said, "There has been such a
dearth of winning Stanford teams for
; the past several years that the public
expects the Cardinals to turn out a
winning team soon. But to make that
expectation come true, the squad will
have to work and not merely wait."
