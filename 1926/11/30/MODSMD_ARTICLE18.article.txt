i tive team, arrive 011 the campus this

sor Graham H. Stuart of the Political
j Science department will act as chair
-1 man of the debate here, while Miss

Audience Judge
At both places the decision will rest
j with the audience. A vote by ballot is
to be taken after the debate to deter
mine whether or not there has been
a change of opinion as a result of the
i arguments presented.
The main points that will be taken
up in the arguments tonight concern
I the question of justice to the criminal
and the good to society. The insanity
defense has known much abdse and it
has been found that reform in this
field is important, as it fs a scientific
as well as a judicial question. It was
, laid down many years ago that defect
of reason must be from disease of the
mind, and whether or not a man is
so diseased is a matter for science.
Insanity Defense Reforms
Several reforms have been suggest
ed to check abuses of this defense. I
In the state of Washington a law was
passed which would completely elimi
nate the insanity plea, but the statute !
was declared unconstitutional. In Eng
land the defense is now used only for
! capital cases.
The State Commission for Legal
Reforms of California has also recom
j mended reforms in the insanity plea.
The chairman of the committee was
at first in favor of making the insanity
1 plea equivalent to the plea of guilty.
He revised his view later, however, as
; there are cases when the defendants
are insane but are guilty of no crime.
An alternative proposal separating
the trial on the charge and the trial
on the plea of insanity was finally
recommended. The latter was to fol
i low the regular trial.

Insanity Defense Reforms
Several reforms have been suggest
ed to check abuses of this defense. I
In the state of Washington a law was
passed which would completely elimi
nate the insanity plea, but the statute !
was declared unconstitutional. In Eng
land the defense is now used only for
! capital cases.
The State Commission for Legal
Reforms of California has also recom
j mended reforms in the insanity plea.
The chairman of the committee was
at first in favor of making the insanity
1 plea equivalent to the plea of guilty.
He revised his view later, however, as
; there are cases when the defendants
are insane but are guilty of no crime.
An alternative proposal separating
the trial on the charge and the trial
on the plea of insanity was finally
recommended. The latter was to fol
i low the regular trial.
