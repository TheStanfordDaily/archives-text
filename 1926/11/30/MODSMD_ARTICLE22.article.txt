Sometimes we wonder what good a football team does a university.
The following editorial from the Broun Daily Herald is here presented
as one frank view of the subject:
"No great advertising campaign or publicity stunt could have accom
plished such wonderful results as has the record of our football team
the past season. Everywhere graduates and men concerned in the in
terests of Brown are rising to boost their college. Money could not
buy the advertising that is being given free by the sport writers of the
country, it has always been a well-known fact that Brown has never
made any big attempt to persuade men to come here. As an added
thought we might say that we are becoming too much of an Eastern
college. Not since the year of 1916 has Brown received such attention
west of the New York State line. Now as far West as California men
in preparatory schools arc talking of Brown and at the same time many
people connected with Brown are advocating a western post-season
football game.
"But what does it all lead to? Will the athletic side of Brown be
stressed as has been the case in many small colleges, in order to increase
the enrollment, or will a sane and judicious attitude be taken bv the
University officials? We arc looking forward already to a tremendous
list of applicants next year. Who will be picked? We urge that, in
view of the fact that Brown has limited enrollment capacities, the com
mittee will select those men who combine scholastic prowess with prow
ess on the athletic field. We will be in a position to choose our men,
but let us remember that our present football team is composed of
'ordinary schoolboys' who are fine students as well."
