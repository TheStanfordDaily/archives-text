# CABBAGES and THINGS

### The King 
First student: "Sure had a great
time over Thanksgiving!"
Second student: "Yeah, I've still
got a headache, too."

Cabbages admires the Y secretaries
for their ability. Any two of the Daily
staff would seriously consider turning
Christian for $550 a month and a pri
vate stenographer. We would even go
to work for that much.

Headline in the Daily:
SOLOMON MARRIES
What, again?

"Is she a hypocrite?"
"Well, she always takes her tooth
brush with her on vacations and never
uses it at home."

More mirrors than employees were
found in a government building in
Washington recently.
Probably a politician's last resort to
get stenographers.

Mr. H. L. Mencken says he's "tired
of civilized people." Then he came to
California.
We take back our invitation.

Police hurled tear gas bombs when
400 Michigan students attempted to
rush a movie theatre following a pep
meeting.
Three tears for Michigan.

A Philadelphia clubman paid a fine
of $100 to a bachelor's club for getting
married. The girl recently won'a bath
ing beauty contest.
Speaking from our own experience
with bathing beauties we predict he'll
be around the club again in a week
or two trying to get his money back.

FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY
Cabbages Remarked:
The football season is a good time
to check up on the feminine viewpoint.
Can a forty-inch chest hold its own
against a forty-horse-power chummy
roadster?
