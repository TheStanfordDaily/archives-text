# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
According to a recent talk by Robert j
Lewis the "hello tradition" of Stan- :
ford is fast disappearing from the
campus. No doubt Mr. Lewis is en
tirely right in making that statement
for there are numerous instances each
day which will bear him out.
Entering students bring with them
a considerable amount of enthusiasm
for all Stanford traditions an£ if a j
frosh may express an opinion on the
subject, I would say that the freshmen <
seem from observation to attempt, at
least, to carry out their duties in re
gard to this one. However, it requires
only one or two failures of upper
classmen to return their salute to j
dampen their enthusiasm and cause
thfm to abandon the practice on the I
campus. Even a t'rosh has some pride, i
In Encina Hall, however, the tradi- j
tion is observed quite conscientiously !
by the vast majority of the frosh. From
this evidence it appears that the ob
servance of the custom by the upper
classmen on the campus would do
much to reinstate this laudable prac
tice generally. —A Frosh.
The Editor. Sir:
Now that the football season is sue- j
cessfully concluded, and plans are be- j
ing made for next year's handling of
crowds, 1 would like to suggest that
the Board of Athletic Control employ
one or more attendants to open all
the gates of the stadium after the ,
games played here.
Several limes during the season just
concluded, I have either walked a few
hundred yards to an exit, or vaulted
over one of the padlocked gates. Other
people burdened with children, lap
robes, or old age, found themselves
unable to perform that latter feat, and
have walked to the nearest exit vo- \
cally wondering why Stanford Univer
sity maintained gates that were not
used for the purpose intended.
Will someone with the authority in I
such matters please see that ALL the j
gates are opened, and thus facilitate i
the emptying of the stadium and ac- !
commodate our off-campus supporters? i
Thank you,
BULL TEN.
