"THE CABALA," Thornton Niven Wil
der (Albert and Charles Boni).
For two and a half hours of enjoy
ment, "The Cabala," by Thornton
Niven Wilder, beats many a motion
picture. For here, if there is not so
much motion, there is certainly a pic
ture. It is the result of the young au
thor's two years' stay at the American
Academy in Rome, and concerns a
strang<s and elevated stratum of
Italian society called the Cabala, a
name indicating that it was considered
to be secret.
Wilder has divided his novel into
five short hooks, the first of which
introduces us to the persons of the
clique. There is the Duchess d'Aqui
lanera, Cardinal Vaini, Princess
d'Epoli, Miss Grie, the wealthy and
eccentric cosmopolite, and more. Books
two, three, and four are short stories,
each dealing with one or, in the fourth,
of two members of the Cabala; and
Book five explains the Cabala and
ends with a stance between the author
and the poet Virgil. Told in the first
person, the whole book takes on a
plausibility that would otherwise be
impossible. This group of people,
every one of whom is an oddity; their
political machinations and connections
with the Church; the fear they inspire
in the rest of Roman society; their
explanation of how they have been
drawn together; and finally, the highly
imaginative interview of the writer
with Virgil—all give "The Cabala" a
flavor of the supernatural. Besides re
lating it in the first person. Wilder has
kept the thing down to earth by using
a very simple style, short sentences
and no flourishes. —V.V.
