# EXAMINATIONS WORTHLESS STANFORD MEN SAY STUDENT WORKS FOR GRADES, NOT SCHOLARSHIP PRESENT MARKING SYSTEM HINDERS EDUCATION
## 
### Aileen Hicks 
though students have groaned at
bought of examinations ever since
iges were organized, little did they
ieet that professors felt the same
about them. At least, five Stanford
professors have expressed such an
opinion.
Examinations as they are now given
are worthless. They do not truly test
the ability of the student. They create
an artificial situation for the student
toward the subject, which tends to
direct his viewpoint to grades instead
of to the real worth of the course. The
ordinary type of grading is one of the
greatest obstacles to learning and
scholarship. Without such a grading
system, examinations would not be
necessary. This is the concensus of
opinion of Victor J. West of the
Political Science department, Edward
M. Hulme, History professor, Harold
C. Brown of the Philosophy depart
ment, Walter R. Miles, professor of
Experimental Psychology, and John C.
Almack, Acting Dean of the School of
Education. The substitute for examina
tions, however, baffles these educators.
West Favors Originality
"I am opposed to general examina
tions," declares Professor Victor J.
West. "They ought to be for the pur
pose of showing the student what he
doesn't know, and not for purposes of
record, but as long as everybody is
seeking credit and working for a de
gree, I see nothing else to do.
"Personally, I like original ideas in
examinations." he adds. "Original
ideas, however, are capable of a great
deal of latitude. Most of the original
ideas of students aren't worth much.
If a student has the wrong idea, which
is usually the case, it is the instruc
tor's duty to show him how it is wrong
and correct it."
Repetition Condemned
"If I could, I would never give ex
aminations which called for a mere
repetition of anything I said," asserts
Professor Brown. "The only point of
education is to teach men to think,
and they need to learn very quickly
that you cannot, think without know
ing something to think about. I hope
from my courses the students will get
a sufficient background to test how
well they can use the information I
give them. I should like to give ex
aminations which call for the applica
tion of such information to determine
other problems."
"The unit system of examinations
creates an artificial situation for many

of the students in reference to their
attitude towards the subject. Hence.
I do not approve of it, but what would
you offer as a substitute?" This is the
query of Dr. Miles.
"I think it is a kind of commentary
on the whole system," he continues,
"that in looking over the graduating i
list, forty-five per cent of those who !
are candidates for a degree have ex
actly 180 units, just enough to gradu
ate. The dominations of the examina
tion in the unit system brings about
that point of view. It tends to direct
the student's viewpoint to the grades
instead of the real intellectual benefit
he can get from the course."
Grading System Opposed
"I am absolutely opposed to the ordi
nary type of grading," declares Dr.
John C. Almack. "I think it is totally
out of line with the purpose of a uni
versity, and one of the greatest ob
stacles to learning and scholarship.
I don't see any defense in it from a
point of view of encouraging original
ity or scholarliness.
"We are greatly interested in all the
original ideas anyone has to offer on
examinations. So far as agreeing with
me is concerned, if it is mer«iy a mat
ter of my opinion, it is immaterial. If
it is a matter of fact, then the actual
facts take precedence over any views
of my own or anjtone else's."
Abolishment Idealistic
Professor Hulme believes that study
ing for an examination done in fear
and trembling has very little power
to help anybody. "The idea of abolish
ing examinations entirely is too ideal
istic for this mundane sphere," he de
clares, although he admits that he
does not enjoy examinations himself.
"In examinations," he continues, "I
wish my pupils to do their own think
ing and by critical analysis to show
the results of their delving into the
original and derived sources of infor
mation to which I have referred them.
They will never learn to think until
they begin, and if they haven't done
so previously, I want them to start in
my classes."

West Favors Originality
"I am opposed to general examina
tions," declares Professor Victor J.
West. "They ought to be for the pur
pose of showing the student what he
doesn't know, and not for purposes of
record, but as long as everybody is
seeking credit and working for a de
gree, I see nothing else to do.
"Personally, I like original ideas in
examinations." he adds. "Original
ideas, however, are capable of a great
deal of latitude. Most of the original
ideas of students aren't worth much.
If a student has the wrong idea, which
is usually the case, it is the instruc
tor's duty to show him how it is wrong
and correct it."
Repetition Condemned
"If I could, I would never give ex
aminations which called for a mere
repetition of anything I said," asserts
Professor Brown. "The only point of
education is to teach men to think,
and they need to learn very quickly
that you cannot, think without know
ing something to think about. I hope
from my courses the students will get
a sufficient background to test how
well they can use the information I
give them. I should like to give ex
aminations which call for the applica
tion of such information to determine
other problems."
"The unit system of examinations
creates an artificial situation for many

of the students in reference to their
attitude towards the subject. Hence.
I do not approve of it, but what would
you offer as a substitute?" This is the
query of Dr. Miles.
"I think it is a kind of commentary
on the whole system," he continues,
"that in looking over the graduating i
list, forty-five per cent of those who !
are candidates for a degree have ex
actly 180 units, just enough to gradu
ate. The dominations of the examina
tion in the unit system brings about
that point of view. It tends to direct
the student's viewpoint to the grades
instead of the real intellectual benefit
he can get from the course."
Grading System Opposed
"I am absolutely opposed to the ordi
nary type of grading," declares Dr.
John C. Almack. "I think it is totally
out of line with the purpose of a uni
versity, and one of the greatest ob
stacles to learning and scholarship.
I don't see any defense in it from a
point of view of encouraging original
ity or scholarliness.
"We are greatly interested in all the
original ideas anyone has to offer on
examinations. So far as agreeing with
me is concerned, if it is mer«iy a mat
ter of my opinion, it is immaterial. If
it is a matter of fact, then the actual
facts take precedence over any views
of my own or anjtone else's."
Abolishment Idealistic
Professor Hulme believes that study
ing for an examination done in fear
and trembling has very little power
to help anybody. "The idea of abolish
ing examinations entirely is too ideal
istic for this mundane sphere," he de
clares, although he admits that he
does not enjoy examinations himself.
"In examinations," he continues, "I
wish my pupils to do their own think
ing and by critical analysis to show
the results of their delving into the
original and derived sources of infor
mation to which I have referred them.
They will never learn to think until
they begin, and if they haven't done
so previously, I want them to start in
my classes."
though students have groaned at
bought of examinations ever since
iges were organized, little did they
ieet that professors felt the same
about them. At least, five Stanford
professors have expressed such an
opinion.
Examinations as they are now given
are worthless. They do not truly test
the ability of the student. They create
an artificial situation for the student
toward the subject, which tends to
direct his viewpoint to grades instead
of to the real worth of the course. The
ordinary type of grading is one of the
greatest obstacles to learning and
scholarship. Without such a grading
system, examinations would not be
necessary. This is the concensus of
opinion of Victor J. West of the
Political Science department, Edward
M. Hulme, History professor, Harold
C. Brown of the Philosophy depart
ment, Walter R. Miles, professor of
Experimental Psychology, and John C.
Almack, Acting Dean of the School of

a sufficient background to test how
well they can use the information I
give them. I should like to give ex
aminations which call for the applica
tion of such information to determine
other problems."
"The unit system of examinations
creates an artificial situation for many

of the students in reference to their
attitude towards the subject. Hence.
I do not approve of it, but what would
you offer as a substitute?" This is the
query of Dr. Miles.
"I think it is a kind of commentary
on the whole system," he continues,
"that in looking over the graduating i
list, forty-five per cent of those who !
are candidates for a degree have ex
actly 180 units, just enough to gradu
ate. The dominations of the examina
tion in the unit system brings about
that point of view. It tends to direct
the student's viewpoint to the grades
instead of the real intellectual benefit
he can get from the course."
Grading System Opposed
"I am absolutely opposed to the ordi
nary type of grading," declares Dr.
John C. Almack. "I think it is totally
out of line with the purpose of a uni
versity, and one of the greatest ob
stacles to learning and scholarship.
I don't see any defense in it from a
point of view of encouraging original
ity or scholarliness.
"We are greatly interested in all the
original ideas anyone has to offer on
examinations. So far as agreeing with
me is concerned, if it is mer«iy a mat
ter of my opinion, it is immaterial. If
it is a matter of fact, then the actual
facts take precedence over any views
of my own or anjtone else's."
Abolishment Idealistic
Professor Hulme believes that study
ing for an examination done in fear
and trembling has very little power
to help anybody. "The idea of abolish
ing examinations entirely is too ideal
istic for this mundane sphere," he de
clares, although he admits that he
does not enjoy examinations himself.
"In examinations," he continues, "I
wish my pupils to do their own think
ing and by critical analysis to show
the results of their delving into the
original and derived sources of infor
mation to which I have referred them.
They will never learn to think until
they begin, and if they haven't done
so previously, I want them to start in
my classes."
