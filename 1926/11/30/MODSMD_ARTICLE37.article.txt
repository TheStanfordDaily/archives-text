Concert of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra

All those who have been led to
think —and there are many—that the
music of Brahms is heavy, difficult,
and involved, should hear his Sym
phony Number Four in E Minor as
rendered by the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra in its Curran Theater
concert last Sunday afternoon. Here
was melody, fiery rhythm, contrasting
harmony, colorful instrumentation —
all the things, in fact, that make a
composition a positive thrill to the
listener. "Bhamins" must have been
pleased by the virile and understand*-
ing manner in which the entire orches
tra interpreted the symphony. Both
the first and second movements had
very singable melodies which were
developed interestingly. The third
movement seemed positively humorous
in a broad and stately way. The finale
was in some ways the most thrilling
of ihe movements. In iT. as in the rest
of the symphony, the work of Mischel
Piastro, the talented first violinist, and
of the orchestra's kettle-drummer was
prominent and distinguished.
Concerning "A Chinese Legend" by
Henry Eichheim, which was conducted
by its composer in this, its first San
Francisco presentation, the less said
the better. It was surely not music in
the sense in which the Westerner is
accustomed to think of music, and it
did not pretend to be. But whether it
was even good Chinese music remains
an open question. Aside from the al
most intolerable dissonances and un
canny instrumental combinations there
was a lack of continuity, of sustained
interest, of climax. Mr. Eichheim was
very uninspired and monotonous as
conductor.
Rilchard Strauss' every popular time
poem, "Don Juan," was rendered in a
masterly manner for the closing num
ber. Hertz emphasized the introspec
tive and thoughtful elements of the
composition rather than its mere pyro
technic display of energy and orches
tral color, and "Don Juan" gained im
mensely.
The orchestra seems this season to
be a better ensemble than before. Cer
tainly its new soloists are masters on
their instruments.
