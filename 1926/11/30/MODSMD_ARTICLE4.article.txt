The last item, 10c on the dollar last year and 6c on the dollar proposed
for this year, includes the cost of all meetings, boys' work in Palo Alto,
off-campus conferences, deficit on the handbook, and all miscellaneous
expenses.
Figures for the above table are on the basis of $9,432 paid out last
year and $11,929 the "Y" hopes to secure this year.

The Y.M.C.A. on the Stanford Cam
pus will undertake to raise this year
more money than it has ever been
given before. The object of a fund
raising campaign will be $11,929. Not
only will the "Y" try to raise a larger
budget for next year but $2099 in
addition to pay for the deficit it has
incurred in the past two years. The
total is several thousand dollars more
than any other campus organization
receives# except the University itself.
Students and faculty members will
be personalty approached in February.
Following this the business men of
Palo Alto will be solicited. Letters will
be sent within a few days to the par
ents of all new students except gradu
ates who have not made written ob
jection.
The campus "Y" maintains two paid
professional secretaries and a steno
grapher, paying a total of $G5OO a year
for the three. One secretary is em
ployed only during the fall, winter, and
spring quarters, and is in general
charge of the organization. The other
secretary is employed all year and di
vides his time between work on the
campus with freshmen and supervis
ing boys' clubs in Palo Alto.
About $500 is directly spent raising
the annual finances without including
the services of the stenographer. The
two secretaries together receiver $5700
a year in salaries. About $750 is bud
geted for the campus and community
program of meetings, boys' work, con
ferences, and miscellaneous. The ac
companying table gives percentages
! spent for each item of the budget.
Twenty-five hundred copies of a pub
licity leaflet were printed the first of
November and about half of them
| mailed out before the meeting ot' the
Executive Board on the fifteenth.
When the Board met so much change
was made in the printed budget that
a mimeographed supplementary state
ment giving the revised budget will
be sent to parents of new students.
The reason given for sending out
the unrevised and inaccurate budget
' to 1250 new students and previous con-
J tributors is that the "Y" needed money
immediately at the beginning of the
year.

The last item, 10c on the dollar last year and 6c on the dollar proposed

expenses.
Figures for the above table are on the basis of $9,432 paid out last
year and $11,929 the "Y" hopes to secure this year.

The Y.M.C.A. on the Stanford Cam
pus will undertake to raise this year
more money than it has ever been
given before. The object of a fund
raising campaign will be $11,929. Not
only will the "Y" try to raise a larger
budget for next year but $2099 in
addition to pay for the deficit it has
incurred in the past two years. The
total is several thousand dollars more

The campus "Y" maintains two paid
professional secretaries and a steno

spring quarters, and is in general
charge of the organization. The other
secretary is employed all year and di
vides his time between work on the
campus with freshmen and supervis
ing boys' clubs in Palo Alto.
About $500 is directly spent raising
the annual finances without including
the services of the stenographer. The
two secretaries together receiver $5700
a year in salaries. About $750 is bud
geted for the campus and community
program of meetings, boys' work, con
