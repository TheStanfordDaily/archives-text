# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
You who were thrilled at the excit- (
ing finishes of the Harvard-Dartmouth, !
Navy-Colgate, or Cornell - Dartmouth j
games of 1926, should not forget the
famous Princeton-Chicago classic of
four years ago, which will go down in
sports history as one of the most hair
raising football battles ever fought on
any gridiron. To add to its flavor was
the intersectional interest, and the
fact that Chicago had beaten Prince
ton the year before 011 the Tigers' own
field.
Here was the situation with twelve
minutes of the final quarter to play:
Chicago was leading 18 to 7 and the
ball was in Princeton's possession on ,
hertwo-yard line. Everything looked
like a Maroon victory.
Here Cleaves dropped back as if to 1
punt, but instead threw a long forward
pass to Gorman, who ran to the 40-
yard line". This daring play, even
though it had no immediate results,
as Princeton soon afterward was
forced to kick, was the real turning
point of the game, and not only dum
founded the spectators, but the Chi
cago team as well.
Soon after, with the ball on Chi
cago's 42-yard line, a substitute center
made a bad pass, which was grabbed
by Gray, of Princeton, who ran un
molested to a touch-down. Score: Chi
cago 18, Princeton 14. The Maroons
received the kick-off, and soon 01(1
Nassau had the ball again deep in
Chicago's territory, thanks to a poor

| punt. The winning touch-down was
merely a matter of a Princeton pass, i
j two penalties against Chicago, and j
Crum's battering his way over the
goal-line. But now came the biggest
thrill of all, and the keenest disap-:
. pointment to the Chicago rooters.
With only a minute or so left to
play, Chicago cut loose with the neg
lected forward pass and soon had
I the ball on Princeton's one-yard line.
With the frenzied crowd shrieking and
screaming madly "Hurry! Hurry!" or
"Hold that line!" the Chicago quarter
back called on John Thomas to buck !
the line, as he had done so success
fully all through the first three quar
ters. Princeton held, Chicago lost the
ball on downs with a foot to go, the
Tiger kicked out of danger, and the
pistol popped.
That was a thriller if there ever was
one.

goal-line. But now came the biggest
thrill of all, and the keenest disap-:
. pointment to the Chicago rooters.
With only a minute or so left to
play, Chicago cut loose with the neg
lected forward pass and soon had
I the ball on Princeton's one-yard line.
With the frenzied crowd shrieking and
screaming madly "Hurry! Hurry!" or
"Hold that line!" the Chicago quarter
back called on John Thomas to buck !
the line, as he had done so success
fully all through the first three quar
ters. Princeton held, Chicago lost the
ball on downs with a foot to go, the
Tiger kicked out of danger, and the
pistol popped.
That was a thriller if there ever was
one.


Remember This Game?
You who were thrilled at the excit- (
ing finishes of the Harvard-Dartmouth, !
Navy-Colgate, or Cornell - Dartmouth j
games of 1926, should not forget the
famous Princeton-Chicago classic of
four years ago, which will go down in
sports history as one of the most hair
raising football battles ever fought on
any gridiron. To add to its flavor was
the intersectional interest, and the
fact that Chicago had beaten Prince
ton the year before 011 the Tigers' own
field.
Here was the situation with twelve
minutes of the final quarter to play:
Chicago was leading 18 to 7 and the
ball was in Princeton's possession on ,
hertwo-yard line. Everything looked
like a Maroon victory.
Here Cleaves dropped back as if to 1
punt, but instead threw a long forward
pass to Gorman, who ran to the 40-
yard line". This daring play, even
though it had no immediate results,
as Princeton soon afterward was
forced to kick, was the real turning
point of the game, and not only dum
founded the spectators, but the Chi
cago team as well.
Soon after, with the ball on Chi
cago's 42-yard line, a substitute center
made a bad pass, which was grabbed
by Gray, of Princeton, who ran un
molested to a touch-down. Score: Chi
cago 18, Princeton 14. The Maroons
received the kick-off, and soon 01(1
Nassau had the ball again deep in
Chicago's territory, thanks to a poor

| punt. The winning touch-down was
merely a matter of a Princeton pass, i
j two penalties against Chicago, and j
Crum's battering his way over the
goal-line. But now came the biggest
thrill of all, and the keenest disap-:
. pointment to the Chicago rooters.
