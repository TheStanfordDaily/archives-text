# SALE OF CHRISTMAS SEALS IS CONDUCTED ON BUSINESS BASIS
## 
### Helena Lorenz Williams 
An undeniably successful venture in
public service is the Christmas seal
sale which is held annually through
out the country and which is again
before us. Like all big business enter
prises, its growth is due to the com
monly prescribed rules for success;
namely, vision, hard work, thrift, and
giving the public what it wants.
Within twenty years this undertak
ing, which is the chief support of the
national, state, and local tuberculosis
associations of the United States, has
developed from a $3000 business to
one whose gross receipts in 1925 Were
approximately $4,900,000. From a tiny
hospital for tuberculous patients in
Delaware which was financed by the
first $3000 in 1907, it has become the
means for creating a network nf
toria, hospitals, open-air schools, clin
ics, and other public health activities
that protect the American people
against what was once known as the
Great White Plague.
According to the National Tuber
culosis Association, the mother of this
gigantic movement, the Christmas seal
sale finances approximately 1500 state
and local organizations besides the
National Association. The united ef
forts of these have resulted in the
establishment of 700 sanitoria and
hospitals, with nearly 70,000' beds for
tuberculous patients; more than 1000
open-air schools; nearly 12,000 public
health nurses; and over 600 clinics.
In addition, children's camps and pre
ventoria, nutrition classes, and numer
ous special campaigns such as Baby
Weeks, Anti-Spitting and Open Win
dow campaigns are made possible by
these little penny stickers.
All but 5 per cent of seal sale money
is spent in the communities where it
is raised. The 5 per cent goes to the
national body which acts as a clearing
house for information, supplies, leader
ship, research and expert service for
its affiliated organizations, and for the
other allied institutions and agencies.
Altogether, the record of the tuber
culosis Christmas seal inspires the con
fidence and continued patronage of its
millions of supporters.
