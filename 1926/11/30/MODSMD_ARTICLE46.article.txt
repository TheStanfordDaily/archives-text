# LUNG POWER ONCE USED FOR TELEPHONE BUZZERS
## 
### Margaret Cummings 
Way back in the good old days when
one didn't just press a bell to indicate
that the girl friend was on the phone,
over at Branner or Toyon or Encina,
as the case might be, but resorted
rather to lung-power or window-to
window communication, the freshmen
hated the sophomores with a bitter
hate, for, due to pressure from their
rival class, the task of maintaining
this rather primitive telephone system
fell upon the first-year men. Certain
ones were indiscriminately assigned
duty on the one phone, and upon them
fell the responsibility of finding and
bringing to the telephone whomever
was called.
Now all this is changed. In every
room in every dormitory on the cam
mis a buzzrr ha? been, installed which
communicates directly with one of the
two central switchboards operated at
Roble and Toyon respectively. With
the installation of lines from the Union
to Toyon last spring quarter the final
step was taken. There are too few
men living at the Union to warrant
establishing a separate exchange, so
the connection was made with the
Toyon service.
This system, which is taken now as
a matter of course, is quite recent.
The Toyon switchboard was installed
three years ago, and Branner was con
nected at the same time, while Encina
has been included for only two years.
Roble's exchange was put in at the

time of the hall's construction in 1918.
Thre is one other switchboard on the
campus located in the Administration
Building, jvliich takes care of all de
partmental calls, Manzanita and Se
quoia halls, and the two gymnasiums.
This exchange was installed by the
University at an expenditure estimated
by Comptroller A. E. Roth as exceed
ing $40,000. The cost incurred in con
necting the Union with Toyon was
$4357, while some $10,000 was spent
at Encina. Monthly upkeep totals
around .ssoo', Mr. Roth staled.
That these switchboards are kept
extremely busy is testified to by the
reports of the various operators. Dur
ing a comparatively quiet time the
"Palo Alto 900" operator, Miss Vivian
Hodgen, completed twelve calls be
tween 3:10 and 3:11 p.m. She gave 4
o'clock in the afternoon as her busiest
hour, and 10 a.m. for Mrs. Elsie Hall,
who takes the board between 7 in the
morning and 3 in the afternoon. Miss
Hodgen's - time is from 3 to 11 p.m.
This board has 183 telephones and 12
trunk lines, as compared with 43 tele
phones and S trunks at Toyon, and 8
telephones and 6 trunk lines at Roble.
The appointment office receives the
most calls through the central ex
change, while at Toyon the greatest
number of calls are for Encina, of
which more than half are from San
Francisco and across the bay. At both
Roble and Toyon halls the busiest
time is just before dinner and from
6:30 to 8:30 or 9 o'clock.

as the case might be, but resorted
rather to lung-power or window-to
window communication, the freshmen
hated the sophomores with a bitter
hate, for, due to pressure from their
rival class, the task of maintaining
this rather primitive telephone system
fell upon the first-year men. Certain
ones were indiscriminately assigned
duty on the one phone, and upon them
fell the responsibility of finding and
bringing to the telephone whomever
was called.
Now all this is changed. In every
room in every dormitory on the cam
mis a buzzrr ha? been, installed which
communicates directly with one of the
two central switchboards operated at
Roble and Toyon respectively. With
the installation of lines from the Union
to Toyon last spring quarter the final
step was taken. There are too few
men living at the Union to warrant
establishing a separate exchange, so
the connection was made with the
Toyon service.
This system, which is taken now as
a matter of course, is quite recent.
The Toyon switchboard was installed
three years ago, and Branner was con
nected at the same time, while Encina
has been included for only two years.
Roble's exchange was put in at the

time of the hall's construction in 1918.
Thre is one other switchboard on the
campus located in the Administration
Building, jvliich takes care of all de
partmental calls, Manzanita and Se
quoia halls, and the two gymnasiums.
This exchange was installed by the
University at an expenditure estimated
by Comptroller A. E. Roth as exceed
ing $40,000. The cost incurred in con
necting the Union with Toyon was
$4357, while some $10,000 was spent
at Encina. Monthly upkeep totals
around .ssoo', Mr. Roth staled.
That these switchboards are kept
extremely busy is testified to by the
reports of the various operators. Dur
ing a comparatively quiet time the
"Palo Alto 900" operator, Miss Vivian
Hodgen, completed twelve calls be
tween 3:10 and 3:11 p.m. She gave 4
o'clock in the afternoon as her busiest
hour, and 10 a.m. for Mrs. Elsie Hall,
who takes the board between 7 in the
morning and 3 in the afternoon. Miss
Hodgen's - time is from 3 to 11 p.m.
This board has 183 telephones and 12
trunk lines, as compared with 43 tele
phones and S trunks at Toyon, and 8
telephones and 6 trunk lines at Roble.
The appointment office receives the
most calls through the central ex
change, while at Toyon the greatest
number of calls are for Encina, of
which more than half are from San
Francisco and across the bay. At both
Roble and Toyon halls the busiest
time is just before dinner and from
6:30 to 8:30 or 9 o'clock.
Way back in the good old days when
one didn't just press a bell to indicate
that the girl friend was on the phone,
over at Branner or Toyon or Encina,
as the case might be, but resorted
rather to lung-power or window-to
window communication, the freshmen
