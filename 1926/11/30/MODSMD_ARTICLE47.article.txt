Polo, ancient sport and "million
aire's game" can be played at Stan
ford for twenty dollars a year.
Because a field artillery unit of the
United States Army Reserve Officers
Training Corps is connected with the
University, Stanford students can en
joy the thrills of the equestrian pas
time which has come to be commonly
associated only with the exclusiveness
of wealthy clubs, says Major John
Keliher, associate professor of mili
tary science. Polo is encouraged by
the government in the colleges which
maintain R.O.T.C. artillery units.
U.S. Encourages Polo
The Government furnishes the rac
ing ponies, the University grants an
appropriation making polo an official
minor sport and provides two playing
fields, and army officers are coaches.
All the student buys is the thick
turtle-shaped helmet for his own pro
tection and the long slender mallet
traditional to the game. About fifty
students are receiving instruction,
preference being given members of
the R.0.T.C., because of limited facili
ties.
How old polo is nobody exactly

| knows. It is generally believed that
j the game was played in Persia before
I the Christian era and its originator
may have lived in Tibet and the sport
spread through Afghanistan. The Brit
ish army in India popularized it in
modern times.
Tamerlane Indulged
Tamerlane the Conqueror played
polo with the heads of slain enemies,
and his great-great-grandson in India
boasted of his ability to play polo
and a variety of leap frog about the
time Columbus discovered America.
Alexander the Great used to engage
his courtiers for some fast practice
after a hard day drilling the Mace
donian phalanx. Alexander was sup
posed to pay a tax to King Darius of
Persia but in 525 B.C. he reached
voting age and wrote Darius a letter
saying he would fight rather than pay.
Darius, then the world's most power
ful ruler, sent the young Macedonian
a polo, stick and ball with a polite
hint that he would better confine
himself to sport than arms. Alexander
replied by fast messenger that he him
self was the stick and the earth a
ball for him to play with. He kept the
polo set, and a few years later con
quered the Persian Empire.
