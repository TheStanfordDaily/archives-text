# First Footballs Were Delicate Pace Was Too Fast for Players Ball Bursts and Halts Game
## 
### 
Rivalry between the competing
teams in the Princeton-Rutgers foot
ball game in 1869 was so keen that
the players became "blowed" and the
pace had to slow down, according to
a contemporary newspaper account.
In the meantime, the pig-bladder ball
burst, and the game was halted while
an official was sent to ransack the
neighborhood stores for anther. Dur
ing this delay, the Princeton players,
who had been lacking in teamwork,
decided on more active tactics in an
impromptu conference. When the game
was resumed they followed the ball
"with great alertness and cunning,"
and swept their opponents to a deci
sive defeat.
