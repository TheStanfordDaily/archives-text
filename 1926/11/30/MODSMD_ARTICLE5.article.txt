# CARDINAL CHAMPIONS RETURN TO PRACTICE FOR PASADENA GAME
## Pop Warner Absent in East Scouting Southerners; Returns Monday 
### 
Stanford's 1926 Pacific Coast Con- j
ference football champions went back
to work yesterday afternoon to pre
pare for their game with the Univer- !
sity of Alabama's Crimson Tide in the j
annual East-West game on New Year's j
Day.
Coach Pop Warner was not present j
to take charge of the workout, but j
Charley Winterburn, backfield mentor, j
and Tiny Thornhill, instructor of the ;
linemen, directed the activities, which ,
consisted of a game of "touch foot
ball," and a general limbering up of
the muscles which have carried Stan
ford's colors to the Pacific Coast title.
Warner Returns Monday
Warner was a spectator at the Ala
bama-Georgia game Thanksgiving Day, j
scouting his New Year's Day rivals, j
He then went to Chicago for the j
Army-Navy contest and will be among j
those present at Los Angeles Satur
day when Notre Dame meets Howard j
Jones' Trojans. He will return to the :
campus Monday to take charge of !
practice.
i
Judging from reports from the East, j
Warner saw a real football team in j
Alabama. The Tide, which has not
suffered a defeat in two seasons,
stands, with Stanford and Lafayette,
as the only unbeaten and untied
eleven in the nation and, according to
all eastern critics, the Alabamans are
the logical opponents for Stanford's
Redshirts.
However, it is almost a certainty
that nothing the Alabama squad did
in its game with Georgia escaped the
veteran eye of Pop Warner, and he
will undoubtedly bring back a very
complete description of their play, and
one which will aid greatly in the de
velopment of a defense to stop their
speedy running and overhead attack,
which has piled up almost 250 markers
this fall against 20 units for their
rivals.
Plenty of Vim
The Stanford players showed plenty
of vim and vigor in their workout Mon
day. "Touch football is the same as
the regular game except that instead
of tackling a runner, his opponents
j merely tag him and he is down. Be
| cause of this fact, forward passes are
very much in vogue in the game. The
game, due to the passes and necessity
of speed in running the ball, is ex
j reptionally fast and provides a good
workout, with some pleasure for good
! measure.
The Pasadena Bowl holds only F>2,floo
i so it will be necessary that all tickets
! for the game be secured by applica
-1 lion.

speedy running and overhead attack,
which has piled up almost 250 markers
this fall against 20 units for their
rivals.
Plenty of Vim
The Stanford players showed plenty
of vim and vigor in their workout Mon
day. "Touch football is the same as
the regular game except that instead
of tackling a runner, his opponents
j merely tag him and he is down. Be
| cause of this fact, forward passes are
very much in vogue in the game. The
game, due to the passes and necessity
of speed in running the ball, is ex
j reptionally fast and provides a good
workout, with some pleasure for good
! measure.
The Pasadena Bowl holds only F>2,floo

Stanford's 1926 Pacific Coast Con- j
ference football champions went back
to work yesterday afternoon to pre
pare for their game with the Univer- !
sity of Alabama's Crimson Tide in the j
annual East-West game on New Year's j
Day.
Coach Pop Warner was not present j
to take charge of the workout, but j
Charley Winterburn, backfield mentor, j
and Tiny Thornhill, instructor of the ;
linemen, directed the activities, which ,
consisted of a game of "touch foot
ball," and a general limbering up of
the muscles which have carried Stan
ford's colors to the Pacific Coast title.
Warner Returns Monday
Warner was a spectator at the Ala
bama-Georgia game Thanksgiving Day, j
scouting his New Year's Day rivals, j
He then went to Chicago for the j
Army-Navy contest and will be among j
those present at Los Angeles Satur
day when Notre Dame meets Howard j
Jones' Trojans. He will return to the :
campus Monday to take charge of !
practice.
i
Judging from reports from the East, j
Warner saw a real football team in j
Alabama. The Tide, which has not
suffered a defeat in two seasons,
stands, with Stanford and Lafayette,
as the only unbeaten and untied
eleven in the nation and, according to
all eastern critics, the Alabamans are
the logical opponents for Stanford's
Redshirts.
However, it is almost a certainty
that nothing the Alabama squad did
in its game with Georgia escaped the
veteran eye of Pop Warner, and he
will undoubtedly bring back a very
complete description of their play, and
one which will aid greatly in the de
velopment of a defense to stop their
speedy running and overhead attack,
which has piled up almost 250 markers
this fall against 20 units for their
rivals.
