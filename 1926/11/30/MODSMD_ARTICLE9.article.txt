# JOURNALISTS WILL HEAR ADDRESS BY SAN JOSE EDITOR
## STARTED FIRST TABLOID Other Writers and Editors To Appear at Future Meetings of Club 
### 
Maintaining its policy of keeping in
touch with the trends and problems
of modern metropolitan dailies, the
Stanford Journalists Club lias invited
Arthur L. Clark, editor-in-chief of the
San Jose Mercury-Herald, to speak at
the first club meeting of this quarter,
to be held tomorrow evening at 6
o'clock at the Phi Gamma Delta house.
The orchestras of Paul Whiteman,
George Olson, and others will offer
their latest selections for the short
dance that will follow the dinner.
Man of Wide Training
Clark will talk 011 the difficulties
that the college man can expect in the
journalism world, and the best way
to surmount them. He has had experi
ences with all phases of newspaper
work, both in large cities and small
towns, and has worked his way up
from the lowest position of cub re
porter.
Clark's connection with the metro
politan dailies has ranged from staff
correspondent to managing editor, en
abling him to become conversant with
all the ins and outs of newspaper work
and management. He is particularly
experienced in building up the circu
lation of a newspaper. His greatest
success in this field was in the growth
of the New York News, started about
seven years ago.
Started First Tabloid
The News was the first successful
tabloid to appear. Clark had once be-
fore tried to start one, but the gov
ernment's war embargo on paper made
him abandon the attempt when he had
hardly begun. In 1919, with Robert
Patterson of the Chicago Tribune, he i
again tried out his idea of the tabloid,
working with two hired rooms and the
presses of the New York Evening Mail.
The News grew rapidly, and soon had
several imitators, not only in New
York, but throughout the country. It
now exceeds in circulation all the |
other New York dailies, and sets the '
fashion for all the tabloids in the I
United States.
Until recently ClarK was the editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle, but
last March illness forced him to leave ;
the city and take his present position ;
in San Jose.
Other Speakers Coming
The meeting tomorrow night is the
first of a series planned by the jour- !
nalists. Arrangements are under way
to bring to the campus other outstand- j
ing American editors and writers.
Clark's talk will begin at S
o'clock. An invitation is extended to
those interested outside the club to ;
attend at that time.
