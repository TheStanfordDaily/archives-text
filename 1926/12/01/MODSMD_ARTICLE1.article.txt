# CAGE SQUAD IN STIFF WORKOUT AS CUT LOOMS
## Coach Husky Hunt Has Fast But Light Material as Nucleus of Team FOOTBALL MEN REPORT Jayred, Bryant, and Captain Nelson David Show Up Well in Practice 
### Fred Speers 
With prospects of the first cut in
the varsity basketball squad happen
ing today, Coach Hunt's candidates
went through a stiffer workout last
night than has yet been given them
More than forty men, representing all
degrees of ability and experience, were
present.
The presence of half a dozen men
from the football squad which held
no practice last night gave Husky
Hunt an opportunity to see some ot
last year's varsity cage material in
court togs for the first time this sea
son. Among those who came out were
Price, Vincenti, Joseph, and
Vincenti will probably remain witli
the court game while the others will
return to football until after the Ala
bama game.
Light scrimmage, using but two or
three simple plays, formed the allot
ment of work handed out by the
Cardinal mentor. Muggs Mitchell, as
sisting coach, took the more inexperi
enced men and formed these into de
fensive combinations to withstand
Hunt's stronger varsity material.
Varsity Men Improving
Several of the varsity men are now
rounding into fair shape as evidenced
by their more heady playing and bet
ter handling of the ball. Jayred at
center and Bryant at forward were
working well last night. Captain David
still is head and shoulders above any
others in accurate basket-shooting.
From all appearances Hunt will have
a speedy, rather light set of material,
of middling experience to work with
this year. One of the greatest problems
will be to develop a dependable bat
tery of scorers.
Freshman basketball men will not
be called out until next quarter, but
they are being given an opportunity
to get into condition by the series of
interclass games now going on. Hunt
has been watching these games with
an eye to seeing what kind of material
will be on hand next quarter. Possible
varsity material may be uncovered in
some of those games.
