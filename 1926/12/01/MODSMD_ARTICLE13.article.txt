Fetishes that a college can fit Will
or Sally for any life work he or she
may choose; that everybody is born
equal and is therefore entitled to
equal amounts of schooling; that the
dollar is the measure of training, or
or the man; that the school bad boy
always grows up to be the brilliant
success while the "grind" becomes a
failure; that education will open the
road to riches or to fame; that the
state owes Willie just as much school
ing as he wants; that it is a reflection
upon a family if they do not send
their' children to college—these are

college. He points out the great waste
of time, both to students and instruc
tors, in elimination after entering col
j lego. Ono should not enter college un
i loss he is able to be trained to give
I "back to society an extra portion of
service in return."
