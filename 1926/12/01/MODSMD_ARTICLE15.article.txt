the question before the debate started.
1 At this time 48 voted on the affirma

pect of the question. A vote taken

a change of eleven from "yes" to "110"

Helen Carpenter and Marion Holley
' upheld the affirmative here for Stan
ford. They argued that insanity as a
, defense in criminal cases should be
1 taken out of the law as it is today.
Miss Carpenter stated that as the plea
of insanity is a scientific matter, the
determination of whether or not a man
is insane should be taken out of the
hands of the jury and placed under
the jurisdiction of a board of experts.
Marion Holley stated the plan that
the affirmative favored as a remedy

i the defendant's guilt should be decided
; upon before judgment on insanity is
: passed. After this, insanity should be
j decided by a board of experts, and
j finally, the judge should take the ver
dict of the latter into consideration
| before passing his sentence. She also
stated that a jury was not capable of
deciding whether or not a man was
i insane.
