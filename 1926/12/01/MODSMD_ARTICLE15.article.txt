By Elsa Krotozyner
Speaking before a large audience,
' Stanford women for the affirmative
| and California women for the negative,
: argued 011 the question, "Resolved,
I hat insanity as a defense in criminal
cases be abolished" last night in the
j Little Theatre. As has been the cus
j torn for the past few times the judg
ment of last night's debate was left
| to the audience.
I
A vote was taken on the merits of
the question before the debate started.
1 At this time 48 voted on the affirma
| tive and 26 favored the negative as
pect of the question. A vote taken
| after the debate showed that 53 had
voted with the affirmative while 21
remained on the negative side. This
tally demonstrated that there had been
a change of eleven from "yes" to "110"
j and a change of seventeen from "110"
| to "yes."
Helen Carpenter and Marion Holley
' upheld the affirmative here for Stan
ford. They argued that insanity as a
, defense in criminal cases should be
1 taken out of the law as it is today.
Miss Carpenter stated that as the plea
of insanity is a scientific matter, the
determination of whether or not a man
is insane should be taken out of the
hands of the jury and placed under
the jurisdiction of a board of experts.
Marion Holley stated the plan that
the affirmative favored as a remedy
j for the present system. First of all
i the defendant's guilt should be decided
; upon before judgment on insanity is
: passed. After this, insanity should be
j decided by a board of experts, and
j finally, the judge should take the ver
dict of the latter into consideration
| before passing his sentence. She also
stated that a jury was not capable of
deciding whether or not a man was
i insane.
Wilma Botts and Lola Leed Osborn
| represented the negative for the Uni
versity of California. Miss Botts was
first speaker. She traced the use of
the insanity defense in criminal cases
up to the present day. Her arguments
held that as the purpose of the court
was to treat the abnormal behavior
of humanity, reforms should be made
not by tearing down but by improving
the present system.
Their plan for betterment of the ex
isting conditions, as suggested by Lola
Leed Osborn, called for the establish
ment of a board of experts attached to
the court. Their basis of decision
would rest upon their knowledge of
mental diseases. As their decision
would be unanimous the jury would be
compelled to make their judgment in
accordance with it. If a person were
subject to recurrent fits of insanity he
should be sent to the state hospital
to remain until his recovery. This
would be decided upon by the same
board of alienists.
Helen Carpenter and Lola Leed Os
born closed the rebuttal for the af
firmative and the negative, respective
ly. Professor Graham H. Stuart was
debate chairman.
At Berkeley, Mildred Crow and
Georgia Finnerty of Stanford argued
on the negative of the question. Oppos
ing them were Elizabeth Stevenson
and Julie Mosehaur of the California
affirmative team.
