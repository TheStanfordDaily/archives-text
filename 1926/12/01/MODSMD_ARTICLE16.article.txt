## 
### 
Nearly thirty sophomores are trying
i out for junior managers of basketball.
With the start of varsity practice last
| week, Gifford Trover, manager of bas
ketball, issued a call for sophomore
tryouts.
Because practice is only held on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at
i present, each tryoutee has been as
signed but one day a week. On this
day he is to be at practice and assist
in any way which the junior managers
wish. A weekly rating is made up
i based on the work done during the
week by the tryoutoes. Six junior man
agers will be chosen at the end of the
| season.
As the practice periods increase in
a few weeks, the trvoutees will have
; more days to report.
