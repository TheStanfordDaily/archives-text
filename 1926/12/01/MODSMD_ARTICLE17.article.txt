# STANFORD STUDES SIGH, SAY SYMBOL SHOWS SOMETHING
## 
### 
Thirteen has changed its com
plexion as an unlucky number.
For the first time on the Stanford
campus thirteen will bring joy in
stead or sorrow to the Sons of
Ihe Stan lord Red and members
of the 500.
Thirteen what, you ask? Why,
no more nor less than thirteen
(13) days of unadulterated bliss
and easeful repose before being
gi anted the privilege of impart
ing to breathless proefssors our
knowledge by means of examina
tions. Good old thirteen!
