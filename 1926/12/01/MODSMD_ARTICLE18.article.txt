# ARTHUR CLARK WILL ADDRESS STANFORD JOURNALISTS CLUB
## San Jose Editor, Originator Of Tabloid, to Speak On News Problems 
### 
After a dinner at the Phi Gamma
Delta house at G o'clock this evening,
the Stanford Journalists Club will be
addressed by Arthur L. Clark, promi
nent journalist and editor-in-chief of
the San Jose Mercury-Herald. Clark has
been active in newspaper work since
ISSO, and because of his close connec
tion with the dailies for forty-six
years, he is well able to discuss the
problems in the various departments
of a newspaper.
Clark has had newspaper experience
ranging from small city journalism to
metropolitan. He was the founder and
first editor of the New York News,
carrying out the idea of the tabloid
which he had conceived, and which
has proved epoch-making. The News
was started on a "shoestring," com
paratively little money being put into
it at the beginning, the paper being
built up with the growth in circulation.
So successful was his idea and so
rapidly did the News grow, that it not
only built up a circulation of 170,000
in seven months, but also set the
fashion for all other tabloids.
Clark began as a cub reporter in
Springfield, Ohio. From there lie went
to Omaha as sporting editor, and after
tlmt gained his first metropolitan gen
eral experience on the City Press As
sociation in Chicago. Then he started
again as cub reporter in San Fran
cisco, but soon became the Washing
ton correspondent of the Chronicle.
He was with the Hearst papers for
nineteen years as managing editor of
five of the Hearst metropolitan dailies
in New York, Chicago, Boston, and
Los Angeles. After he left the News
lie once more returned to the San
Francisco Chronicle, this time as edi
tor, but his health breaking down, he
went ot Los Angeles for recuperation.
Last March he took his present posi
tion on the San Jose Mercury-Herald.
An invitation is extended to those
outside the club to attend Clark's talk
on the difficulties that college men
and women meet in the journalism
world. A short dance, the music for
which will be rendered by world-fam
ous orchestras, will follow the dinner
