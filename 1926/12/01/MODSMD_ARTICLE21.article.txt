# The 						High Cost of Moralizing
## 
### 
It seems inevitable that the minute anyone dares to discuss a religions
organization all the Forces of Righteousness rise in indignation pro
posing the offender be boiled in oil as a heretic against the principles
of religion and the practice of morality. This is 110 more right than
that one who comments 011 an embezzling bank cashier should be con
demned as attacking the basic principles of all legitimate business.
Let it be plainly understood that this is not a hint that the two
Y. M. C. A. secretaries are trimming the suckers. They are obviously
sincere and enthusiastic and would doubtless continue so even if they
were not getting $550 a month between them.
But the Y. M. C. A. doesn't have to stay just exactly as it is to
keep the devil from clutching the campus. There would still be traces
of morality remaining in the world even if the "Y" made less of a
business of it. "Trying to discover and practice the highest ideals of
life" is not a "Y" monopoly.
The Campus Association proposes to collect over ten thousand dol
lars this year. Of this, forty-eight cents of each dollar will go to the
secretaries and four cents more to the cost of raising funds. The people
who give this ten thousand dollars give it in sincere trust that it will
be used to best advantage, particularly since less than one-ninth of the,
contributions come from the faculty members and students who are
actually on the campus.
Stanford is not so moral that some effort to promote character comes
amiss. And no possible issue can be taken with the right of any religious
group, Christian or otherwise, to spread the doctrine it honestly believes
and to try to get people to work for it. But ten thousand dollars annu
ally is a lot of money and the contributors and students are entitled to
expect ten thousand dollars' worth of desirable results.
