### The King 
TWENTY-SIX YEARS AGO
A Stanford Graduate Wrote
to the Daily:
" 1 maintain that a man may
utterly disregard yell-leaders and still
be a loyal Stanford student, ....
What we need now is not more 'stunts,'
more 'catchy originalities,' but a yell
leader who knows when to shut up
. . . . It seems a generally accepted
axiom at the University now that any (
student who does not yell at the dic
tate of the yell-leader is deficient in
'Stanford spirit' and disloyal to his
alma mater. Furthermore, the innocent
freshmen are told that in the 'good |
old days' everybody yelled all the |
time, and from this phenomenon arose
the 'Stanford spirit'! ....
—Graduate.
A few days later came this reply!
Since 'Grad's' day there has I
been a marked evolution In college!
yelling. Whether we like It or not —!
and most of us like it—the San Fran-'
cisco public has come to regard the
rooters as giving a show on Thanks
giving Day, before the line-up. Berke
ley is always ready with her 'stunts.'
It's a case of playing to the gallery,
and unless we want to be laughed at
we must have a few 'founts' of our
own up our sleeve."
AND NOW
The moral of all of which history
being, of course, that we are living in
a new age, new problems are facing
the students of today and upon the

, younger generation rests the hope of
mankind.

In The Good Old Days
When Comptroller Roth was a junior
at Stanford he lived for a time in the
fire-house then on Salvatierra, with six
other students who composed the fire
department. The only time there was
a fire during the time he was with the
department, five of the seven firemen
were at Berkeley taking part in a track
meet against California.
Roth helped make a relay team rec
ord there which stood for several
years.
