While it is universally admitted that '
there is room for improvement in the
system of education in vogue in Ameri
can universities, there is a great deal
of debate concerning the most advis
able means of making the said im
provement. Here is one suggestion,
printed recently in the New Student.
It comes from the pen of George Ber
nard Shaw:
"As far as I can gather, if the stu
dents in the American universities do
not organize their 6wn education, tney
will not get any. The professors are
overworked schoolmasters, underpaid,
and deprived c£ all liberty cl spo-edi
and conscience. From them nothing
can be expected. The governing bodies
are under the thumbs of the plutocrats
who pay the piper and call the tuna.
Englishmen who become professors in
American universities rush back to
England to enjoy the comparative free
dom and enlightenment of Oxford,
Cambridge, and London, though these
might have been thought unapproach
able in their efficiency as extirpators
of the human mind. Secondary educa
tion as imposed by college dons will
wreck civilization: in fact it has al
ready almost done so. The remedy is
co-operative organization by the con
sumers: that is, by the students. If the
American baker could give his cus

toniers what lie liked instead of what ;
they liked, American bread would be !
as bad as American university educa
tion. In forming Intellectual Soviets.!
and establishing the Dictatorship of
the Learner? the American students
may save their country if it is capable j
of being saved. If not, they will at least
learn something:, and perhaps teach
something, in the ecstasy of demoli
tion."
It would appear to us, from what
opportunity we have had for observa- 1
tion locally, that George Bernard Shaw
is unduly optimistic in his assumption
that the American student is a virile
intellectual type, brimful of the desire |
to learn, and ready for a revolt, if by j
revolting he might enhance his
chances of gaining the true culture. He
has failed to note that American uni
versities are filled not only with the
rabid searchers after Truth and Beauty
but with all of the literate young peo
ple in the country who can raise the !
necessary expense money. True, that j
there is a certain small group of real
learners among them. But the percent
age of these learners is so small that
the danger of a revolt against the
; existing system is regrettably remote.

While it is universally admitted that '
there is room for improvement in the
system of education in vogue in Ameri
can universities, there is a great deal
of debate concerning the most advis
able means of making the said im
provement. Here is one suggestion,
printed recently in the New Student.
It comes from the pen of George Ber
nard Shaw:
"As far as I can gather, if the stu
dents in the American universities do
not organize their 6wn education, tney
will not get any. The professors are
overworked schoolmasters, underpaid,
and deprived c£ all liberty cl spo-edi
and conscience. From them nothing
can be expected. The governing bodies
are under the thumbs of the plutocrats
who pay the piper and call the tuna.
