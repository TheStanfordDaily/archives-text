The Editor, Sir:
If you print this note, which I doubt, it
will be to call to the attention of those
members of the student body who pretend
to be gentlemen the fact that you have on
the staff of your paper one who falls
outside that classification by all tests,
except, for all 1 know, those of conven
tional dress and a smooth tongue. I hope
he was wrong in associating the rest of
your itaft" with himself in his vulgar
sneering.
Naturally, the implication against the
Y.M.C.A. secretaries could only arise in
a mind small enough to contain little else.
Those students who enjoy the privilege
of their friendship, however, resent the
fact that such vile insinuations are ap
parently sanctioned by the Daily. Beyond
that, the student body which "owns and
• publishes" the paper has a right to expect
the exhibition of better taste.
