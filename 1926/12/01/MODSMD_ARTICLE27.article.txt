The Editor, Sir:
When I read Monday's usnal foolish
and uncalled-for blah which appears in
that disgraced column known as the Bull
Session, I emitted the usual sigh and
wondered again when the editor of the
Daily is going to throttle this sophomore

j and peculiarly annoying pest, to use some |
of the pet names he so freely applies to j
j others.
I am heartily in favor of such a column
! as Bull Session, hut when it is edited as
this one has been, it can't hel phut have a
derogatory effect on the paper. I have j
long since ceased to take any stock in the |
i column, but people outside of the Uni- J
versity will get a pretty poor conception ,
of the paper if they chance to read this J
| nonsensical rot which the editor is putting
forth for someone to believe. Suppose
a visitor to the campus should glance
through the Daily and see yesterday's un
called-for and unreasonable tirade against i
A. B. See.
Without exception, I believe that to
be the worst attempt I have ever seen in j
the Stanford Daily. He rants ferociously
at A. B. See for his twisted thinking and
lack of reasoning, and at the same time
displays the poorest reasoning and great-1
est lack of clear thinking that has yet i
cluttered the columns of this paper. Even |
I a radical must show occasional signs of j
| intelligence and reasoning power, you
I know.
I am not trying to defend A. B. See,
for I think his blah is as nonsensical as ,
I that of our deluded friend. I am not i
even aiming at that particular tirade of,
| yesterday. I am just tired of this over- j
j flow of genuine bull which has flooded !
i this column since October 1. The attack!
on A. B. See was only a continuation of
what has been appearing all this quarter.
| I join with others of this campus in '
loudly shouting, "When is someone going
| to throttle him-"
