Depifjns Are Solid
Solidity of design is the outstanding
characterization of the sets executed
by Leslie Kiler for "The Book of
Charm," the 1926 Sophomore Play.
Called upon to portray the interior of
a typical corner drug store, Kiler and
his assistants have worked out a set
ting well adapted to the action of the
scene, and particularly for the climax
where Joe Pond, soda clerk, is knocked
unconscious after a fight such as is
rarely portrayed on the stage.
Overturning chairs, crashing against
tables, fighting desperately, the hero
awakens from his recipient knockout
to find his heroine-sweetheart, Ida
May, by his side. The two parts are
well taken by Ewart Goodwin and
Kathleen Fitz, both appearing for the
first time in serious roles in campus
dramatics.
Many Character Parts
In addition to the two central figures
of the plot, "The Book of Charm" pre
sents character parts in abundance, o£
which that of Mrs. Wilson, played by
Edwina Ewing, is an example. Here,
in harmony with the action of the
comedy which deals with life in a
country town, is offered the village
gossip, ever repeating each choice bit
of scandal or news falling within range
of her too-efficient ears, and spreading
town-talk in twenty or so greatly ex
aggerated ways.
Janet Harris Plays Violet
The village vamp, Violet, taken by
Janet Harris, is present, employing all
her feminine skill in order to further
her designs 011 the young soda clerk ,
hero, and so precipitating the heatings
of Pond at the hands of Claude, played
by Tom Thurlow.
Nelson Spinks, making his first ap- '
• pearance in common with most of the
cast, is cast as Dr. Garfield, the old
and antiquated country doctor, and
with George Mott and Clara Weather- I
wax as the mild-mannered minister
and his wife, portray three figures
which are an integral part in village i
life.
Author Played Role of Klein
Kirkpatrick, the author of "The !
Book of Charm," played the role of
Rudolph Klein in the original produc- i
tion of the play in New York, receiv- :
ing tribute from Broadway critics as [
creating one of the finest stage char
acters of the current year. The part
has fallen into the hands of Irving ,
Frohlich, who is making the most of
the opportunities offered him as the
magnetic salesman, whose influence l
extends throughout the play, though
this one of fluent words appears only
in the first act.
Louise Buxton as Mrs. Harper, Eliza
beth Clark as Miss Mildred, Elizabeth
Cramer as "Babe," Malcolm Soltan as
Mr. Lester, and Sam Haves as Mr.
1
Harper, complete the cast of the I
Sophomore Play, which should prove
one of the best comedy entertainments
j of the Stanford dramatic season.
