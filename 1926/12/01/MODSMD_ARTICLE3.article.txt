Depifjns Are Solid
Solidity of design is the outstanding
characterization of the sets executed
by Leslie Kiler for "The Book of
Charm," the 1926 Sophomore Play.
Called upon to portray the interior of
a typical corner drug store, Kiler and
his assistants have worked out a set
ting well adapted to the action of the
scene, and particularly for the climax
where Joe Pond, soda clerk, is knocked
unconscious after a fight such as is
rarely portrayed on the stage.
Overturning chairs, crashing against
tables, fighting desperately, the hero
awakens from his recipient knockout
to find his heroine-sweetheart, Ida
May, by his side. The two parts are
well taken by Ewart Goodwin and
Kathleen Fitz, both appearing for the
first time in serious roles in campus
dramatics.
Many Character Parts
In addition to the two central figures
of the plot, "The Book of Charm" pre
sents character parts in abundance, o£
which that of Mrs. Wilson, played by
Edwina Ewing, is an example. Here,
in harmony with the action of the
comedy which deals with life in a
country town, is offered the village
gossip, ever repeating each choice bit
of scandal or news falling within range
of her too-efficient ears, and spreading
town-talk in twenty or so greatly ex
aggerated ways.
Janet Harris Plays Violet
The village vamp, Violet, taken by
Janet Harris, is present, employing all
