# JUNIORS VICTORIOUS OVER SOPHOMORES IN INTERCLASS HOCKEY
## 
### Astrid Arnoldson 
Junior women clearly demonstrated
their superiority as a hockey team in
their 5 to 1 victory over the sopho
mores yesterday afternoon on Roble
field. They took the lead in the first
laxed in the third period, when the
quarter, led at half-time 3 to 0, re
sophomores broke through for their
lone score, and rallied.again to make
two more points in the final quarter.
During the first half almost all the
play was in sophomore territory. The
second was more even.
Rittler Scores
Lida Rittler, who seems to be espe
cially adept at catching the ball out
of a mass of players, made the juniors'
first tally in the first quarter after her
team had spent some time threatening
the sophomore goal to no purpose.
In the second quarter Carolyn Shep
ard and Leslie Hill scored for the
juniors. The 1028 team had to fight
its way down the field in this game,
very seldom being able to clear the
ball out for long runs by individual
players.
Sophomores Rally
As the second half of the game be
gan, the sophomores showed better
co-ordination than before, and they
succeeded in making one goal, scored j
Dy Ruth Mason. Juanita White, speedy
Inner, was backed up rather poorly,
and had to fall back so much to get
the ball herself that she could not get
away from the junior backs who, more
over, were excellent.
Miss Rittler and Miss Shepard
scored again for the juniors in the
rush of the last quarter. At no time
did it look as if the sophomores might
w.in, although for a while it seemed
they might keep the score down to
a low figure.
Title in Sight
This game leaves only the seniors
as an obstacle to the juniors' taking '
the title. With Charlotte Lovekin gone, '
the seniors are handicapped still fur- \
ther than earlier in the season. How
ever, they are not negligible as a bar
on the road to the championship,
they have shown an excellent brand
of hockey when they could get their
team together.
The seniors will play the freshmen
this afternoon at 4:20 o'clock on Roble !
field. The upperclass women are fa
vored, in view of their 10 to 0 victory
over the freshmen in a practice game.
The game will not, however, be a
walk-away. The seniors will have to
play short, and the freshmen have
been improving lately.

Junior women clearly demonstrated
their superiority as a hockey team in
their 5 to 1 victory over the sopho
mores yesterday afternoon on Roble
field. They took the lead in the first
laxed in the third period, when the
quarter, led at half-time 3 to 0, re
sophomores broke through for their
lone score, and rallied.again to make
two more points in the final quarter.
During the first half almost all the
play was in sophomore territory. The
second was more even.
Rittler Scores
Lida Rittler, who seems to be espe
cially adept at catching the ball out
of a mass of players, made the juniors'
first tally in the first quarter after her
team had spent some time threatening
the sophomore goal to no purpose.
In the second quarter Carolyn Shep
ard and Leslie Hill scored for the
juniors. The 1028 team had to fight
its way down the field in this game,
very seldom being able to clear the
ball out for long runs by individual
players.
Sophomores Rally
As the second half of the game be
gan, the sophomores showed better
co-ordination than before, and they
succeeded in making one goal, scored j
Dy Ruth Mason. Juanita White, speedy
Inner, was backed up rather poorly,
and had to fall back so much to get
the ball herself that she could not get
away from the junior backs who, more
over, were excellent.
Miss Rittler and Miss Shepard
scored again for the juniors in the
rush of the last quarter. At no time
did it look as if the sophomores might
w.in, although for a while it seemed
they might keep the score down to
a low figure.
Title in Sight
This game leaves only the seniors
as an obstacle to the juniors' taking '
the title. With Charlotte Lovekin gone, '
the seniors are handicapped still fur- \
ther than earlier in the season. How
ever, they are not negligible as a bar
on the road to the championship,
they have shown an excellent brand
of hockey when they could get their
team together.
The seniors will play the freshmen
this afternoon at 4:20 o'clock on Roble !
field. The upperclass women are fa
vored, in view of their 10 to 0 victory
over the freshmen in a practice game.
The game will not, however, be a
walk-away. The seniors will have to
play short, and the freshmen have
been improving lately.
