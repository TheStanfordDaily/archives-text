## 
### 
Stanley A. Weigel, president of the
A.S.S.U., and Charlotte Lovekin, presi
dent of the A.W.S., will arrive in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, tomorrow to attend
j the Second Annual Congress of the
J National Student Federation. Meetings
j will be held Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday at the University of Michi
gan with one hundred and sixty col
leges from thirty-six states sending
representatives.
The aim of this national associa
tion is to achieve a spirit of co-opera
tion among the students of different
: colleges throughout the country to the
end that the experience of one shall
inure to the advantage of all. Further
more, it proposes to develop under
standing between the students of
| America and foreign countries, and to
further an intelligent student opinion
1 on questions of national and interna
tional importance.
Stanford's two representatives will
help to form a group of individuals
dedicated to the vitalization of Ameri
can education and the furtherance of
fellowship with students of other
countries. A special group of official
delegates will travel to Europe to
study student conditions. By arrange
ment with the Pan-American Union,
probably in the summer of 1928, stu
, dent groups will visit Latin-American
countries and likewise Latin-American
students will come to the United
States.
The Annual Congress hopes to pro
vide a means of acquainting each dele
gate with educational problems and
progress in other colleges *of the na
tion. This will enable each university
to have tho experience of different
institutions in different sections of the
i country with the resultant attainment
J of a more comprehensive view of its
own difficulties.
