# Old Mazurka Burns 'Em Up Leads Fox Trot by Calories Shimmy Turns Out 'Also Ran'

Jazz hounds who think modern
dances are energetic are due for a
surprise, if information published in
The Scandinavian Archives of Physi
ology is to be trusted, says the McGill
Daily. The old-fashioned mazurka
heads the Scandinavian list of energy
| dissipators, experiments proving it to
j expend more than double the number
I of calories that the fox-trot or shimmy
i uses per kilogram of dance floor cov
ered. The results published are:
Waltz —3.99 calories.
Shimmy—4.o2 calories.
Schottisclie —4.76 calories.
Fox Trot—4.7B calories.
Polka —7.56 calories.
Mazurka —10.87 calories.
The McGill paper concludes that
"the low calorific value attributed to
the shimmy would appear to indicate
that the present status of knowledge
in Scandinavia concerning this noble
form of muscular exertion is very
j low," and that "a further set of ex
l periments on the American hot mama
! would be of great scientific and social
interest."
The Charleston or later dances are
not included in the report, indicating
that they either failed to reach Scan
dinavia in time for experimentation
or that they broke the testing appa
ratus.
