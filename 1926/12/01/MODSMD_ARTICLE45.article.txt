# BIRTH RATE OF BEST FAMILIES FOUND LOW

The "well-born," the fairly intelli
gent, educated, and well-to-do are not
producing children enough to keep
themselves from extinction, according
to Professor S. J. Holmes of the
Zoology department at the University
of California. Professor Holmes has
just finished a study of figures ob
tained from students at the Univer
sity of California over a five-year
period, for the Journal of the American
Genetic Association.
Figures previously presented gave
an average of 3.40 children for ninety
one California families that had pro
duced exceptional children. This figure
is far too high, believes Professor
Holmes, who places it at 2.18 children
for the average gifted family, or even
as low as I.Bo', taking into account
childless families; a figure far below
that necessary to maintain the stock.
In his own calculations on the basis
of some 3530 California families send
ing their children to college, Professor
Holmes finds the average to be two
children to a family, including child
less families. Comparing this figure
with an equivalent one for the families
of grandparents of college students,
he finds that the average family has
dropped about thirty per cent in the
one generation.
