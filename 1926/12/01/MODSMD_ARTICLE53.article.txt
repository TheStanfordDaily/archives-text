### 
Two American oarsmen, C. P. Dar
lington, formerly of Harvard, and H.
T. Kingsbury, of Yale, have replaced
Englishmen on the Oxford crew, being
the first Yankees to row an Oxonian
boat in two years. Kent Leavitt, a Har
vard man, was advanced from second
to first shell at Cambridge, making
three men from the States who have
succeeded in the sport in Great
Britain.
