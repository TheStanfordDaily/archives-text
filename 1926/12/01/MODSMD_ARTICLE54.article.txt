# SPECIAL PROGRAM CHOSEN FOR STANFORD CONCERT OF SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
## 
### 
Managers of the Stanford Concert i
Series co-operated with the San Fran- i
cisco Symphony Orchestra in arrang- J
ing a program which it thought would
be especially interesting to a Stanford
audience when the orchestra gives its j
recital in the basketball pavilion the
evening of Wednesday, December 8.
Dr. Alfred Hertz will lead the orches
tra in this, the third event of the con
cert series. The numbers chosen are
notable for their charm of melody and ,
are among the most popular orchestral \
compositions. Each is relatively short
so that it has been possible to arrange j
a varied program representing all;
periods of music.
Mozart Number Opens Program
The Overture from the "ilarri*£e j
of Figaro," by Mozart, will open the
program. This number has always been
popular in the concert and Hertz has j
played several times. The music itself ,
is charming, full of life and vigor,
with the spirit characteristic of
Mozart. Main themes of the opera are '
used in it and are developed very
cleverly as the overture unfolds.
Flute Obligato by Linden
Cluck's "Dance of the Blessed Spir
its" from "Orpheus," the flute obligato
of which is to be played by Anthony
Linden, solo flutists of the orchestra,
is declared by critics to be one of the
greatest compositions ever written for
this instrument. This beautiful and
classic composition is taken from the
opera of "Orpheus." The theme depicts
Orpheus, who has come to the Valley
of the Blest in search of his beloved
Eurydice. He sees her dancing among
the happy spirits, and his beautiful
song is answered by the shades who
bring to him his loved one.
"L'Arlessienne"
Bizet's Suite No. 1, "The Woman of
Aries," includes a prelude, a minuet, a
nocturne, and a carillon. These com
positions were first written as inci
dental music to a play of the same
name. Even after the popularity of
the play died out, the music was still

j played and was finally collected into
! a suite.
Overture from "Mignon"
The most popular work of the tal
| ented French composer, Ambroise
; Thomas, was his opera, "Mignon." It
is the most successful composition of
the composer. Hertz will give the me
| lodious overture from this opera
which is considered by some to be
unequalled in sweetness of melody,
j The story revolves about the child
Mignon who has been stolen by a band
of gypsies.
Brahms Waltzes Are Melodious
"Five Waltzes," by Brahms, form a
light and melodious element in the
! program. They are delicatelv mv.-
! strutted aiia charmingly beautiful.
The ballet music from "Prince Igor,"
by Borodin, is taken from the second
i act of the opera. The scene is laid in
i the camp of Khan Konchak where
i Igor is held captive. This music offers
an excellent example of the Cossack
! danc which was introduced into Russia
from the Orient.
The remainder of the program is
I comprised of the "Meditation" from
; Thais by Massanet and two Irish coun
try dances, "Irish Tune from County
1 Derry" and "Molly on the Shore," by

pianist and composer of many charac

Mozart Number Opens Program

cleverly as the overture unfolds.
Flute Obligato by Linden
Cluck's "Dance of the Blessed Spir
its" from "Orpheus," the flute obligato

classic composition is taken from the
opera of "Orpheus." The theme depicts

of the Blest in search of his beloved
Eurydice. He sees her dancing among

j played and was finally collected into
! a suite.
Overture from "Mignon"
The most popular work of the tal

unequalled in sweetness of melody,
j The story revolves about the child
Mignon who has been stolen by a band
of gypsies.
Brahms Waltzes Are Melodious
"Five Waltzes," by Brahms, form a
light and melodious element in the

The ballet music from "Prince Igor,"
by Borodin, is taken from the second
i act of the opera. The scene is laid in
