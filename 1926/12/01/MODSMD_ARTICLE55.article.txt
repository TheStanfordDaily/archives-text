"Strike three —you're out! C'mon
Skin-nav we're up to bat!" And Skin
nay marches in from left field all
ready to knock a home run. He'd made
a three-bagger last time
For the Great American Game is
one of the really important things, like
Thanksgiving or the Fourth of July,
to the twenty kiddies who are making
their home down on that coiner of
the Stanford Farm which holds the
Convalescent Home. Here, from 2:30
to 4 each afternoon these youngsters
disport themselves 011 the playground,
enjoy their favorite games, and most
important of all, absorbing the fresh
air and sunshine necessary for a nor
mal and happy childhood.
On any afternoon the playground
will present a varied picture. Some of

I the youngsters will be swinging con
-1 tentedly, others will be sliding down
i the chutes, regardless of fresh apparel,
I while still another group will be found
| in the playhouse, enacting juvenile do
j mestic scenes with the greatest seri
| ousness.
Assistance Needed
Yet for all their seeming content
| they could be much happier. Interest
I often lags, and there are always some
1 who are new and lonely. How they
; would appreciate having some one to
1 direct their play, and take part in
1 their games! Here is your chance, sons
and daughters of Stanford. Be this
"someone." Come on out and referee
i a ball game, or let one of the young
j sters referee you! There is room for
| the co-eds, too. You haven't forgotten
how to play, and if you have, these
folks will help you to remember.
You'll realize how deeply they appre
ciate you when you see them lined up
along the fence waving you good-bye,
[and shouting ardent and sincere invita
tions to return —and soon!
Everything, Everyone on Hand
It's all there, playhouse, merry-go
round, baseball diamond, and twenty
j youngsters of every variety from curlv
headed Filipino to freckle-faced Irish
man. All that they need is to have
lew big brothers and sisters from Stan
ford to play with them and furnish
j interest and excitement.
Come on out, fellows, and see how
many twelve-year-olds you can fan!
