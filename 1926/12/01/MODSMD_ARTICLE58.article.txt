# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There's nothing like the thrill of
coming from behind in the last minute
to win. Home runs have been hit with
the bases full am! two out in the last
half of the ninth inning, and with the
home team three runs behind, but
hark back to the 1912 Michigan-Penn
sylvania football game and then try
and think of a better climax.
Michigan had led 21 to 20. As the
whistle blew for the end of the game,
a Michigan punt was in the air, and
according to the rules, the game didn't
end until that play was finished. The
only possible chance for a Peun vic
tory was for one of its team to catch
that ball and run to a touchdown, and
that is exactly what Dick Marshall did,
dodging, side-stepping, swerving, and
wriggling out of the hands of Michi
gan tacklers for 60 yards until he had
crossed the goal-line! Penn kicked the
goal just for fun, and it went into the
record books as a 27 to 21 victory for
the Red and Blue.

! One of the most famous last-minute
I comebacks in sports occurred in the
Ketchel-O'Brien fight, held at the
; Pioneer Athletic Club in New York
City on March 2t>, 1909. From the rec
ord books, where it is listed as a no
decision fight of ten rounds, you get j
no inkling of what an astonishing bat- j
tie it was. For nine rounds Philadel-!
I phia Jack O'Brien was piling up a big j
lead on points, and giving the Michi- j
1 gan Assassin as neat a trimming as !
cue could wish to see. Then with less i
than ten seconds of the last round to '
go. Ketchel landed a haymaker which :
laid O'Brien out cold. At the count of j
j "six," the gong rang, ending the fight.
| There has seldom been as thrilling a
last-minute finish.
[ The great team of Goullet and
! Brocco stole a lap in the last minute :
' of the 1921 six-day bike race and thus j
! won the most thrilling race in history. !
It was a super-thrilling climax to one
of the most thrilling of all sporting |
| events.
