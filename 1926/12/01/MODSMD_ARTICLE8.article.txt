juniors that enabled them to get the
victory from the seniors. Both teams
exhibited an air-tight defense during
the first fifteen minutes and did not
uncork the fast-playing until lbs sec
ond half. The first period ended with
the score 6-5 with the 1927 team lead
ing.
In the second half it. was (he better
skill and faster work that enabled the
juniors to chalk up their points. With
the seniors it was the same old story
of not being able to hit the basket
when they had the ball and the 192S
team took every advantage offered
them.
Two combinations in the junior
squad that did some effective work
were Nye and Ray at forward posi
tions and McDonald and Dobson at
guard. Brown and George took the
honors for the seniors. The game on
the whole was hard-fought and rough
ness was shown by both teams, many
times there were as many as six men
on the floor in a pile.

The second teams of both classes
played an interesting game, interest
ing because there was so much free
scoring. The senior seconds held the
juniors for one basket, in the second
half while the former counted for four, i

Freshmen Will Meet Juniors
Although the freshmen lost their,
first game to the sophomores, they are j
counted on as pushing the 192S squads ;
: for a hard battle. The first game starts j
at 4:15 o'clock with the second teams j
| nn the floor and the first-string game !
! following afterward. Two fifteen-min- ;
ute halves constitute a game.
The first-team lineups were as fol- j
lows:
Juniors (15) Seniors (10) j
j Nye rf Holman I
| Moore If * George |
Rupe c Gibbons!
Cook rg Ankley j
Newcomb lg Rolles |
Substitutes: Juniors —Ray, Dobson, j
McMurrey, McDonald, and Guthrie. !
Seniors—Brown, Codd, Brady, Men- ;
1 zies, and Walker.
Both basketball teams of the senior
class were decisively defeated by their
junior rivals in the interclass tourna
ment yesterday. The 1928 first squad
won by a 15-10 score and the second
string men by 19 to 12.
Careful Guarding Wins for Juniors
It was the careful guarding of the
juniors that enabled them to get the
victory from the seniors. Both teams
exhibited an air-tight defense during
the first fifteen minutes and did not
uncork the fast-playing until lbs sec
ond half. The first period ended with
the score 6-5 with the 1927 team lead
ing.
In the second half it. was (he better
skill and faster work that enabled the
juniors to chalk up their points. With
the seniors it was the same old story
of not being able to hit the basket
when they had the ball and the 192S
team took every advantage offered
them.
Two combinations in the junior
squad that did some effective work
were Nye and Ray at forward posi
tions and McDonald and Dobson at
guard. Brown and George took the
honors for the seniors. The game on
the whole was hard-fought and rough
ness was shown by both teams, many
times there were as many as six men
on the floor in a pile.
Free Scoring in Sccond-Team Game
The second teams of both classes
played an interesting game, interest
ing because there was so much free
scoring. The senior seconds held the
juniors for one basket, in the second
half while the former counted for four, i
The third series of the interclass \
tournament will be played this after- j
noon between the freshman and the
junior teams.
