Representatives and managers of
athletic activities of the nine mem
bers of the Pacific Coast Intercollegi
ate Athletic Association in a two-day
program to be followed by attendance
at the Notre Damp-U.S.C. game on
Saturday, are opening their annual
sessions tonight at the Biltmore Hotel
in Los Angeles.
The athletic managers meet tonight
after a banquet in their honor at the
hotel. At this meeting the football
schedule for the 1927 season will be
arranged, with Stanford, the present
champion, getting first choice for
pending contests. Alfred R. Masters
will represent Stanford at this meet
ing, having left for the South last
evening.
Faculty Men Gather
Tomorrow night the faculty repre
sentatives of the nine institutions hold
their meeting to decide on all changes
in rules, to discuss eligibility of trans
ferred students, and to act as a board
of appeal for reinstatement of any
student who has lost his amateur
standing.
Professor William B. Owens of the
Law School, Stanford's faculty repre
sentative, will be in Los Angeles to
attend the banquet this evening and
the meeting tomorrow. Present of
ficers of the Conference are: 11. V.
Carpenter, of Washington State Col
lege, president; and M. F. Angell, of
the University of Idaho, secretary
treasurer.
Coaches to Attend
T. A. D. Jones, coach at, Yale, with
Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, and
Pop Warner, the "Big Three" of the
football world, will attend the pro
ceedings, and will get together to pick
an All-American squad, it is rumored.
The 1926 football season has been
entirely successful as far as compli
ance with the rules of the Conference,
and the clean playing of the teams
has reduced the necessity of changing
or modifying regulations, and only the
subject, of eligibility seems to be open
to debate.
The meeting at this time of year is
entirely devoted to football rules and
schedules, as special meetings are
called later to discuss current athletic
activities.
