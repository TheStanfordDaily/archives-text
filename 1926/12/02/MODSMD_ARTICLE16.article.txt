# SENIOR HOCKEY TEAM DOWNS 1930 ELEVEN IN REGULAR GAME
## Upperclass Women Held During First Half; Break Loose in Last Period 
### 
Steady playing in the first half and a
j determined onrush in the second were re-
I sponsible for the senior hockey team,
! playing with only nine women, defeating
the freshman eleven 4 to 1 yesterday
afternoon. The freshmen opened the
scoring, but the seniors evened it before
the end of the half, and in the second
period they loosed a determined onrush
that held the first-year women to that one
score and gave the 1927 team three more
tallies.
The seniors played mostly on the de
fensive during the first quarter, and dur
ing the second threatened the freshman
1 goal several times, but scored only once.
Holley Scores
Marian Holley, freshman left wing,
made the only score for her team, carry
! ing the ball down the field from close to
| the 50-yard line, losing it when the senior
j right fullback hinged just as she slack
| ened pace to pass, and crossing the field
j in entirely unorthodox fashion regained I
|it from scrimmage and shot for goal. j
Half Ends in Tie
In the second quarter the seniors began
to threaten the freshman goal more,
; Marie Manchee tying the score by shoot
ing a goal for the seniors. The half ended
1 in a 1 to 1 tie.
In the third quarter, the seniors carried
| the ball into freshman territory, but the
j play see-sawed back and forth for some
: time before they scored again. This time
| the seniors were rushing the goal, and!
I the freshman goal guard had just reached
, for the ball with her stick, as it slipped
; over her feet, when Doris Kildale gave
the ball a tap that sent it into the corner
j for a senior goal.
Barbara Fenwick and Nellie Shepherd
j made the last two scores for the seniors.
The freshman backfield played an ex
cellent game, on the whole. Their defeat
i was due not to poor defense but to a
J weak attack, and the fact that the seniors
kept to a policy of strong defense, con
| centrating on keeping the 1930 women!
| back. Miss Fenwick and Miss Manchee,
at the two senior pivot positions, filled
I every breach, with few exceptions. On
j the other hand, Martha Judson, Eda Lord,
j and Dorothea Woehlkc did about all that
backfield players could do to hold back
the senior onrush.
The freshman and sophomore second 1
teams will meet this afternoon at 4:20;
I o'clock on Kohle field.

j for a senior goal.
Barbara Fenwick and Nellie Shepherd
j made the last two scores for the seniors.
The freshman backfield played an ex
cellent game, on the whole. Their defeat
i was due not to poor defense but to a
J weak attack, and the fact that the seniors
kept to a policy of strong defense, con
| centrating on keeping the 1930 women!
| back. Miss Fenwick and Miss Manchee,
at the two senior pivot positions, filled
I every breach, with few exceptions. On
j the other hand, Martha Judson, Eda Lord,
j and Dorothea Woehlkc did about all that
backfield players could do to hold back
the senior onrush.
The freshman and sophomore second 1
teams will meet this afternoon at 4:20;
I o'clock on Kohle field.
Steady playing in the first half and a
j determined onrush in the second were re-
I sponsible for the senior hockey team,
! playing with only nine women, defeating
the freshman eleven 4 to 1 yesterday
afternoon. The freshmen opened the
scoring, but the seniors evened it before
the end of the half, and in the second
period they loosed a determined onrush
that held the first-year women to that one
score and gave the 1927 team three more
tallies.
The seniors played mostly on the de
fensive during the first quarter, and dur
ing the second threatened the freshman
1 goal several times, but scored only once.
Holley Scores
Marian Holley, freshman left wing,
made the only score for her team, carry
! ing the ball down the field from close to
| the 50-yard line, losing it when the senior
j right fullback hinged just as she slack
| ened pace to pass, and crossing the field
j in entirely unorthodox fashion regained I
|it from scrimmage and shot for goal. j
Half Ends in Tie
In the second quarter the seniors began
to threaten the freshman goal more,
; Marie Manchee tying the score by shoot
ing a goal for the seniors. The half ended
1 in a 1 to 1 tie.
In the third quarter, the seniors carried
| the ball into freshman territory, but the
j play see-sawed back and forth for some
: time before they scored again. This time
| the seniors were rushing the goal, and!
I the freshman goal guard had just reached
, for the ball with her stick, as it slipped
; over her feet, when Doris Kildale gave
the ball a tap that sent it into the corner
j for a senior goal.
