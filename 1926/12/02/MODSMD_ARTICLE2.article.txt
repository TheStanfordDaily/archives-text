## 
### 
Arthur R. Kinkle, junior student in
Geology, received painful injuries
about the left eye Tuesday evening,
when he stumbled into an uncovered
hole left by workmen at the edge of
the path which passes between the
bell tower and the old Pattern Shop,
Fifteen stitches were taken to close
the wound.
The accident occurred at 7:30
o'clock when Kinkle was returning to
his room in Sequoia Hall. No light
had been left to warn passersby and
Kinkle tripped over the pile of dirt, his
head striking the edge of the hole.
Captain F. J. Atwood, who was in the
vicinity at the time of the accident,
rushed the man to medical aid.
Kinkle wore glasses when he fell,
but by a freak of chance the lense
which covered the injured eye was
unbroken. The one on the other side
was shattered, however.
The bole was left in connection with
work being done on the Pattern Shop
which is being converted into the
Aerodynamic laboratory.
