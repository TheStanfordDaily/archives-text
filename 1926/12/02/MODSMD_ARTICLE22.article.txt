# STANFORD CAGE MEN GET FIRST CUT OF SEASON
## Thirty-Six Cagers Survive Card Mentor's Initial Slash in Squad STIFF SCRIMMAGE GIVEN Practice Cancelled Today to Permit Decoration for Cotillion 
### Fred Speers 
Thirty-six men constitute the Cardi
nal varsity basketball squad following
Coach Husky Hunt's cut iti his list ot*
candidates which was made last night.
Nineteen names were dropped and
Hunt plans another slash soon.
Last night's practice saw the last
workout which will be held in the
pavilion until next week, because of
decoration work now in progress for
the sophomore cotillion Friday night.
No practice will be held tonight and
Thursday's workout will be held in
the gymnasium.
Scrimmage Hard
Relatively hard scrimmage was
handed out the basketball men by the
Cardinal mentor. Each day's workout
has been increasing in intensity and
lust night's scrimmage gave Hunt a
fair insight on the present condition
of many of his men. Through the
scrimmage he was able, too, to see
haw some of the newer men were
handling themselves in action.
Especially promising was the worlc
of McCandless, a member of last year's
freshman team. McCandless is tall,
rangy, and a capable accurate shot at
the basket. He should give Javred
some stiff competition for the center
berth, though Jayred is a more cool
and consistent player.
Clark Shows Speed
Bill Clark showed up well at running
guard. Clark is one of the most fin
ished and all-round players on the
squad. He, too, is tall, but has the
added quality of fair speed.
Coach Hunt has good material for
his first year as varsity mentor and
with enough likely timber present to
produce some good battles for regular
positions he should turn out a strong,
fast team in the course of (he season.
Following is the list of men remain
ing on the squad as announced by
Coach Hunt for release this morning:
Biaggini, Bowers, Bryant, Clark, Crary,
David, Dobson, Jayred, Joseph, Lewis,
Riese, Sibbett, Vincenti, Worden,
Young, Christ, Reynolds, McCandless,
Newhouse, Ogden, Smalling, Shipkey,
Price. Wilson, Nye, Cobb, Levit, Robb,
Renzel, Clyne, Ankele, Farmer, Kla
bau, Tibbe, George, and Davis.
