Co-Ed. By Olive Deane Hormel.
(Charles Scribner's Sons, 1926, $2.00.)
Both more and less real than the col
lege of The Plastic Age is the college of
Co-lid, the story of a college girl's career.
There a[e no orgies of cocktails and
kisses, no "lascivious" bull-sessions or
"obscene" initiations—on the contrary,
Lucia Leigh, the co-ed in question, lives
in the tradition of Betty Wales.
Indeed, the book is much like a Betty
Wales story set in a contemporary co
educational Middle Western university.
Lucia is the kind of person who is one
of the pillars of her prep school, and she
continues on her virtuous way through
four years of college. So little is she
characterized that she becomes a type
rather than an individual.
The chief assets of the story arc its
human appeal and its background of real
ity. It gives a fairly accurate picture of
college life—so accurate that at times it
degenerates into an announcement of
courses and a guidebook of places of
campus interest. Miss Hormel has very
evidently been a student at the university
she so carefully depicts for her readers,
and for that reason Co-Ed is interesting,
since college life everywhere is much
the same.
There is no attempt at charm of style,
and aside from a dim championing of the
nKKlern girl, any subtlety of interpreta
tion is entirely lacking. The one claim to
greatness that Co-Ed may offer is its
uifiversality—it might easily have hap
pened to almost any normal freshman girl
in almost any collcgc.
