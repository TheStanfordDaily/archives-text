And Then Came Spring. By John Margrave.
(Century, New York, $2.00.)
Mr. Godwin Birtwistlc, a business man,
aged 55, grows tired of being the tired
husband and father for whom bis home
is kept sedate and quiet. On a business
trip to London he meets a charming
young war widow of whom lie grows in
ordinately fond on successive trips to

the metropolis. She makes him much
younger, and she also makes him do very
! foolish things, such as renting her a flat
in Mayfair, where he sojourns while in
! London. Her extravagance rouses the
' business man in him, and his own new
; youth fulness having communicated itself
to his home in North England, his inter
| est turns back there, with the eventual
result that he breaks with his charming
war widow, paying her a handsome sum
! to forget the whole affair.
The book does not sound, in a brief
synopsis, like anything very new or inter
esting. However, it is. Mr. Hargrave
tells the story with a great sympathy for
both Mr. Birtwistle's and his war widow's
points of view. Both are very much to be
i sympathized with, Mr. Birtwistle because
of his completely human reactions to
everything, because of the entire inno
cence of his mind even in this lapse, and
the war widow because she is "up against
it,"and simply follows the instinct of
j self-preservation.
There is fortunately no element of
melodrama in the story. It is not an old
i tale retold. It is an entirely new angle
â€¢ m a situation in which buman weakness
j looms much larger than the right or
wrong of the thing, and in which the
attitudes of the characters mean ever so
' much more than what they do. There is
no dirty villain, no virtuous hero. There
arc only very real people "pursuing hap
piness," and inadvertently getting into a
bit of a mess in the process.
One does not, at the end, dislike any
|of the characters with more than the
normal dislike one might have for some
one who was annoying in petty ways, and
one positively likes all of the main char
acters.
