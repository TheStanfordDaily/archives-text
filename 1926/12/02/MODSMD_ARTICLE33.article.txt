The Supreme Court of the Philippine
Islands has ruled that stealing a'kiss
while dancing with a pretty girl is not
a crime, but rather the natural thing
to do.

pine Islands does the Charleston?

Pop Warner is giving the eastern
teams the once-over. We'll bet he

the Crimson Tide if they'll only fight."
But the old fox sure knows his stuff.
