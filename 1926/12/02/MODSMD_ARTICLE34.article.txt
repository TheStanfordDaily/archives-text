Your editorial in Wednesday's "Daily"
is written in fine spirit, and I think will
be taken in the same spirit by those of
the Y.M.C.A. who are thinking primarily
about Stanford students, and not about
the prestige of an organization. I write
this, then, not in a spirit of criticism, but
to call your attention and the attention of
your readers to the fact that nearly one
half of the support for our work comes
from the business men and residents of
Palo Alto. The reason for this large
increase in support from town's folk is
obvious to anyone who knows our pro
gram ; we have become, through an in
creasingly extensive Boys' Work pro
gram, a community force as well as a
campus movement. Over one hundred
and twenty-five boys are in Boys' Clubs :
in Palo Alto and the Mayfield district,'
under the leadership of the Boys' Work 1
Commission of the student association. I
Mr. Culver gives half of his time to the]
promotion and guidance of this work,
under the final direction of a Boys' Work |
Commission of which a prominent alum
nus. Jim Sparling, is chairman. You may
raise the question as to why we should ,
enter into community work. A number i
of reasons: First, it's there to do; sec-!
j ond, we are organized and equipped to
do it; third, college men enjoy boys' club
leadership; fourth, it is obviously ineffi- i
cient to try to have two Y.M.C.A.'s in |
the Palo Alto community; fifth, we were;
asked to take it over by the state commit- !
tee and local business men.
In considering, then, the "high cost of
moralizing," as reflected in the Y.M.C.A.
budget, don t be too campus-centered. The |
Palo Alto constituency who support our
work see both its aspects, and are will- j
ing to think in larger financial terms be-1
cause of their larger conception of the j
Association's task.

The Editor, Sir:
It appears to the writer that Mr. D. H.
Alden in his contribution of last Wed
nesday to this column has placed himself'
in a position considerable less enviable!
than that of the writer of Cabbages. The i
latter is indulging in his rights as a
humorist by being somewhat ironical
about a situation of considerable interest j

and importance to the student body. It
is conceivable that a little irony may be
of some help in bringing about a more
complete understanding of the Y.M.C.A.
situation. »
Mr. Alden, however, has contributed
nothing. His outburst is only of an in
sulting nature and smacks strongly of
a younger man's attempt to be impressive.
As such, it appears to the writer to be
entirely uncalled for.

enter into community work. A number i
of reasons: First, it's there to do; sec-!
j ond, we are organized and equipped to
do it; third, college men enjoy boys' club
leadership; fourth, it is obviously ineffi- i
cient to try to have two Y.M.C.A.'s in |
the Palo Alto community; fifth, we were;
asked to take it over by the state commit- !
tee and local business men.
In considering, then, the "high cost of
moralizing," as reflected in the Y.M.C.A.
budget, don t be too campus-centered. The |
Palo Alto constituency who support our
work see both its aspects, and are will- j
ing to think in larger financial terms be-1
cause of their larger conception of the j
Association's task.

The Editor, Sir:
It appears to the writer that Mr. D. H.
Alden in his contribution of last Wed
nesday to this column has placed himself'
in a position considerable less enviable!
than that of the writer of Cabbages. The i
latter is indulging in his rights as a
humorist by being somewhat ironical
about a situation of considerable interest j

and importance to the student body. It
is conceivable that a little irony may be
of some help in bringing about a more
complete understanding of the Y.M.C.A.
situation. »
Mr. Alden, however, has contributed
nothing. His outburst is only of an in
sulting nature and smacks strongly of
a younger man's attempt to be impressive.
As such, it appears to the writer to be
entirely uncalled for.

Your editorial in Wednesday's "Daily"
is written in fine spirit, and I think will
be taken in the same spirit by those of
the Y.M.C.A. who are thinking primarily
about Stanford students, and not about
the prestige of an organization. I write
this, then, not in a spirit of criticism, but
to call your attention and the attention of
your readers to the fact that nearly one
half of the support for our work comes
from the business men and residents of
Palo Alto. The reason for this large
increase in support from town's folk is
obvious to anyone who knows our pro
gram ; we have become, through an in
creasingly extensive Boys' Work pro
gram, a community force as well as a
campus movement. Over one hundred
and twenty-five boys are in Boys' Clubs :
in Palo Alto and the Mayfield district,'
under the leadership of the Boys' Work 1
Commission of the student association. I
Mr. Culver gives half of his time to the]
promotion and guidance of this work,
under the final direction of a Boys' Work |
Commission of which a prominent alum
nus. Jim Sparling, is chairman. You may
raise the question as to why we should ,
enter into community work. A number i
of reasons: First, it's there to do; sec-!
j ond, we are organized and equipped to
do it; third, college men enjoy boys' club
leadership; fourth, it is obviously ineffi- i
