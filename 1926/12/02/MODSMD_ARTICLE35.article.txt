The Editor, Sir:
I'm waiting for a big Y.M.C.A. man
like D. H. Aldcn to come along and save
my soul. From the looks of things, I'm
due for an exceptionally long wait. The
"Y" isn't so quick to save souls as it is
to decry those people who are attempting
to demonstrate to it why it is a failure
here.
Mr. Alden's letter, which was not
marked by any overly conspicuous gram
matical mistakes, seems to me to be the
most un-Christian missive that has yet
come forth from the typewriters of the
private secretaries. He may hold a Bible
in his hand, but he's using it to hit people!
The Daily's primary duty, it seems to
me, is to print the truth. However, the
"Y" dislikes the truth, it would appear,
and now, after trying to whip the stu
dents who find fault with it, it turns on
the school paper because it tells the truth.
Much as the Y.M.C.A. has ruined its
mission by taking such an attitude, I
think we should all be goo'd sports. How
about going over there and converting
them, since their work along these lines
seems to be overshadowed by attempts
to raise money, hire secretaries, and,
above all, answer in an oh! such sarcastic
manner those of us too annoyingly curi
ous about its functions.
