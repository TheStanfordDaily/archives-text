# NATIONAL TENNIS STARS MAY PLAY ON NEW COURTS
## 
### 
Invitations have been extended to
Helen Wills and other tennis stars by
the Board of Athletic Control to play
exhibitinn matches when the new ten
nis courts are opened next quarter.
Eleven new courts have been con
structed this quarter, making a total
of twenty-two courts available for the
men. They are located east of the old
track fieid, just across the road from
Encina Gymnasium. Three of these are
for exhibition purposes, having grand
stands on two sides, so that large
numbers of people may watch the
tournaments in the future.
There has been a long-time need
for courts as there has been an insuf
ficiency of them to care for the de
mands of the men's tennis classes, aÂ»d
the old ones are in bad shape. Grading

was started and the grandstands were
moved early this quarter. A few weeks
ago the actual construction was begun,
and only the finishing touches have to
be made before they will be opened.
The building was done by a con
struction company under contract. A
new composition, the Laycold, has
been used, whereby the asphaltum is
not laid on hot, but it is mixed like
cement and on cold. This not only
makes the courts smoother, but pre
vents the softening by the heat. It is
also claimed that this is more resilient
than the old process.
Shrubbery and flowers will be
planted around the grandstands in the
spring to shelter the courts and pre
vent the courts from detracting from
the beauty of the campus.
