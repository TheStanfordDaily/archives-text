### 
W ill Irwin, whom Professor Eeverett
W. Smith characterized as "the best
reporter in America today," in his talk
last evening at the dinner of the Stan
ford Journalists Club given at the Phi
Gamma Delta house, is one of those
former Stanford men who have
achieved fame in the field of journal
ism.
Professor Smith, in reviewing the
story of journalism at the University,
followed the careers of such well
known figures as Charles K. Field,
James Morse, Paul Renault, Bristol
Adams, Bruce Bliven, and Marjorie
Driscoll, and their present positions of
importance in the world of journalism.
Arthur L. (Mark, editor of the San
Jose Mercury Herald, who was sched
uled to talk on his own experiences in
newspaper work, was unable to bp
present, due to sudden illness. After
dinner the club members adjourned to
the Delta Chi house, where they
danced until 8 o'clock.
