# COLOR WOOD BLOCKS OF ENGLISH ARTISTS HERE FOR EXHIBITION
## 
### 
The collection of color wood blocks
by Walter J. Phillips, which has been
on display at the Stanford Art Gallery
for the past two weeks, has been re
moved to make place for a new ex
hibit, which will be shown the begin
ning of next week, and which will
consist of wood blocks in color by
English artists.
An excellent showing of pencil
drawings by Allan Gilbert Cram will
be shown this week. Mr. Cram has
won world-wide recognition for his
works, which have been displayed in
the National and Pennsylvania Aca
demy, the Buffalo Museum, and the
Carnegie Institute of Arts.
All Mr. Cram's work up to the pres
ent collection has been done in color
with oils and watercolors as mediums.
He is now attempting to combine line,
light, and color, each developed to an
equal degree. The pictures on display,
done only in pencil, are illustrative
of a broad, vigorous style entirely dif
ferent from the old type pencil sketch
es of the past.
The dignified simplicity of "The
Patio," the sombre depths portrayed
in "The Oak Forest at Carmel," and
the careless abandon in "The Bathers"
show a decided range of type in his
works. Each picture brings out a pre
dominating mood, each line in the
drawing furthering the interpretation
of this mood.
Mr. Cram's works will remain at the
Art Gallery until December 5.
