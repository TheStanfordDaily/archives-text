# ALBERT SPALDING TO APPEAR IN PENINSULA CONCERT NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Albert Spalding, famous American vio
linist, is to appear in the second concert
of the Peninsula Musical Association here
next Thursday night.
Spalding, who is one of the greatest
violin virtuosi now living, was horn in
Chicago in 1888 of thoroughly American
parents. He studied first with Jean Bai
trago in New York, later going to Flor
ence, where lie was a pupil of Chiti.
At the age of fourteen the artist passed
the examination for a professorship in
the Bologna Conservatory in Italy. He
made his professional debut in Paris in
1908 when he was only eighteen, and
made his American debut the same sea
son.
Although Spalding has achieved great
.success in his concerts, he has not al
lowed the praises lie has received to turn
his head. Unlike Kreisler or Hiefcitz,
who affect an arrogance toward their
hearers, the American artist remains
"himself."
The technique of Spalding is notable
for its tone color and phrasing, qualities
which seldom fail to gain particular
mention by critics.
