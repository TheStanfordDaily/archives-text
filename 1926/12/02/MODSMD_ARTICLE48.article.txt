# LODGE ASSESSMENT BY W.A.A. DECLARED LEGAL BY LAW DEAN
## Women's Constitution Gives Quorum Right to Tax Stanford Women 
### 
The recent action of W.A.A. in levy
ing a $2 lodge assessment on its mem
bers, thereby causing much agitation
among the campus women, has been
pronounced legal by M. R. Kirkwood,
dean of the Stanford Law School.
His opinion is based upon the fact
that the W.A.A. constitution gives that
organization fhe right to assess its
membership with the sanction of a
quorum of such membership. Dean
Kirkwood declares that there is no
question of the legality of the open
meeting held at Searsville, or of the
manner of voting so the action itself
is legal.
The plan of the W.A.A. Board, ac
cording to Marie Manchee, president
of W.A.A., was to collect the assess
ment by voluntary, rather than by
compulsory contributions. This plan
was followed out and there was no
attempt made to force payment.
It was assumed that some were not
interested in the project and would
not, therefore, care to contribute to
its financing, while others were un
able to give. These possibilities were
taken into account.
A sufficiently large number of wo
men has signified approval of the
lodge to make continuance of plans
worth while, in the opinion of Miss
Manchee. She declared that every ef
fort is being made to finance the pro
ject in a manner fair and satisfactory
to all. Anyone not willing to do her
share toward building the lodge will
not be so urged. Several unsolicited
contributions from alumnae have been
received.
