# JUNIOR CAGE FIVE DOWN YEARLINGS IN HARD-FOUGHT GAME
## Upperclassmen Win by 15-14 Margin; Newcomb, Rupe, Berg, Harlow Star 
### 
In one of the liardest-fouglit and
closest games of the intercluss basket
ball series so far, the junior cage men
won from the freshman team yester
day by a score of 15-14. The babe sec
onds overcame the 192S seconds, draw
ing a 15-12 victory from them.
Both teams started the game with
close guarding. The yearlings had the
better of the juniors during the first
half which ended with the score 8-4
in favor of the former. It was the
close guarding of Newcomb, 1928 right
guard, that kept the freshmen from
registering more shots. Rupe, forward,
was also another mainstay on the
junior team, being the high scorer for
them.
• Berg Shines
For the yearlings, Berg, left for
ward, was the outstanding player. He
was high-point man for the game,
counting three baskets and one free
throw. The entire freshman team, how
ever, 'deserves much credit for the
game fight they put up that came
within a close chance of spelling vic
tory for them.
The junior second team loosened up
in the second half and lost their six
point lead to the freshmen, who took
advantage of it and came out with the
long end of the score. This contest,
like the first-string game, was close
although not as smoothly played. Har
low, junior center, kept things in a
turmoil and made the game interesting
to watch as well as difficult for the
babes.
Seniors-Sophs Next
The seniors will tangle with the
sophomores this afternoon in the
fourth game of the series. The sophs
won from the freshmen 25-18 and the
seniors lost to the juniors 15-10 in
the first games. From this comparison
of scores everything points toward a
close contest. If the seniors can learn
to hit the basket, they should have
the edge over the twenty-niners.
