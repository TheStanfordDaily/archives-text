# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The fact that Charles Born and A.
S. Born, of Wisconsin, were members
of rival football squads last Saturday
when the Army met the Navy on Sol
diers' Field in Chicago was interesting,
but not very unusual. Brother has op
posed brother in a football game many
times before Charlie and A. S. Born
became literally "Brothers in Arms"
in the annual service classic. Born, of
the Army, is one of the best ends in
the country, while Born, of the Navy,
is a guard, and a good one, too.
The sports writers of the East bad
a wonderful opportunity in 1919 and
1920, when "Tim" Callahan, of Yale,
and "Mike" Callahan, of Princeton,
met in the annual Tiger-Bulldog bat
tles. The Callahans both played center
in 1919, and both were captains of
their respective teams in 1920. "Tim"
was placed on Walter Camp's 1920
All-America team as guard.
In 1921 and '22, "Red" Barron, of
Georgia Tech, was the most-feared
backfield man in the South. Now his
younger brother is carrying on in his
place, and starring as a half-back for
the same school. Red Grange has a
younger brother —"Pinky," some call
him, but not to his face. Red feels
sure that although "Pink" is not in
school now, he will go back to continue
his studies at Illinois and carry on
where Red left off.

| But the most famous family of foot
ball brothers of all is the Poe tribe,
; of Princeton. Seven Poes in all played
for Old Nassau —John Prentiss Poe,
'54, the father, and six sons. This
famous Maryland family bears the
most illustrious name in all Prince
! ton's football history. Johnson, Edgar
Allan. Arthur, Nelson, Johnny, and
Gresham were the boys' names, and
i each one was a star. Art was probably
the most famous, as he won two games
from Yale single-handed. Johnny, a
quarterback, was killed in the great
war.
i The Thomases, of Chicago, and the
Kreuzes, of Penn and Wisconsin, have
! won gridiron fame in recent years, as
| well as many others. Last year both
the Brown and Harvard teams had
I twins in their lines, while this year's
Boston College team boasts three sets
| of twins!

Brothers in Football
The fact that Charles Born and A.
S. Born, of Wisconsin, were members
of rival football squads last Saturday
when the Army met the Navy on Sol
diers' Field in Chicago was interesting,
but not very unusual. Brother has op
posed brother in a football game many
times before Charlie and A. S. Born
became literally "Brothers in Arms"
in the annual service classic. Born, of
the Army, is one of the best ends in
the country, while Born, of the Navy,
is a guard, and a good one, too.
The sports writers of the East bad
a wonderful opportunity in 1919 and
1920, when "Tim" Callahan, of Yale,
and "Mike" Callahan, of Princeton,
met in the annual Tiger-Bulldog bat
tles. The Callahans both played center
in 1919, and both were captains of
their respective teams in 1920. "Tim"
was placed on Walter Camp's 1920
All-America team as guard.
In 1921 and '22, "Red" Barron, of
Georgia Tech, was the most-feared
backfield man in the South. Now his
younger brother is carrying on in his
place, and starring as a half-back for
the same school. Red Grange has a
younger brother —"Pinky," some call
him, but not to his face. Red feels
sure that although "Pink" is not in
school now, he will go back to continue
his studies at Illinois and carry on
where Red left off.

| But the most famous family of foot
ball brothers of all is the Poe tribe,
; of Princeton. Seven Poes in all played
for Old Nassau —John Prentiss Poe,
'54, the father, and six sons. This
famous Maryland family bears the
most illustrious name in all Prince
! ton's football history. Johnson, Edgar
Allan. Arthur, Nelson, Johnny, and
Gresham were the boys' names, and
i each one was a star. Art was probably
the most famous, as he won two games
from Yale single-handed. Johnny, a
quarterback, was killed in the great
war.
