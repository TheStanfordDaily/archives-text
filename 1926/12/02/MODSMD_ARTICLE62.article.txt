# Merchants of Palo Alto Plan Annual Open House
## 
### 
Christmas will lie heralded tomorrow
evening in Palo Alto with a Christiana
tree at the circle, street dancing, and the
merchants' annual open house. Every
shop in town will be decorated and ready
for guests with favors and a little show
of some sort, and there will be a contest
for the prize window display. The Stan
ford Band is to contribute to the general
program.
