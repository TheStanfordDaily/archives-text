# INTRAMURAL TRACK PRELIMINARIES SHOW PROMISING MATERIAL
## Encina, Delta Chi, Theta Chi, Breakers Runners Win in Relay Heats 
### 
Staging sensational finishes, the
Encina fourth floor west, Delta Chi,
and Theta Chi teams won first places
in three of the heats of the relay in
the preliminary intramural track meet
today, while the Breakers quartet won
in the fourth heat by default.
In their race, the Theta Chi's had
their baton twenty yards behind the
leader at the start of the third lap,
but with a short distance to go their
runner spurted ahead and forced the
stick under the tape with a yard to
spare.
The Delta Chi team gave its backers
a thrill or two when it just barely
managed to edge in on a first place.
The Encina runners took their first
with the aid of a runner who decided
to race at the last minute, and was
forced to run in a most unusual track
suit.
