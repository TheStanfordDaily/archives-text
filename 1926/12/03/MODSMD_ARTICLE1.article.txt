# LEAGUE POLICY NOT TO UPHOLD ARMS ARTICLE
## Moral Persuasion Exercised Through Nation's Board Of Arbitrators GIVES U.S. VIEWPOINT Mussolini Backs Down as Action Is Disapproved By the Council 
### 
''The League of Nations has practi- j
cally abandoned the famous Article X !
■which provides that all the members !
of the League take up arms and de
clare war on any country which does
not obey its orders," declared Dr.
Jordan last night at his Thursday
Evening Conference.
"The League cannot have teeth in
this respect, but it can and is showing j
its real power as a purely arbitration
board," said I)r. Jordan. He gave two
instances in particular in which the
League exercised a large amount of j
"moral persuasion."
The first illustration of this type of
influence which Dr. Jordan presented
was a Greek-Bulgarian quarrel in
which Greece declared war on Bul
garia, claiming that she had a right
to do so because Bulgaria killed a
Greek.
But when the League showed its dis- j
approval of the action of Greece,
Greece withdrew her armies and paid
143,000 dollars reparation to Bulgaria.
Mussolini Backs Down
The second illustration of the power I
of the League of Nations was that of j
Mussolini's withdrawal of one of his i
battleships which threatened to attack
Greece when the League expressed its 1
dislike of his conduct.
Dr. Jordan commented on the vari- j
ous reasons for the United States not
joining the League. It seems to be his j
belief that there are two main reasons I
why this country did not join.
"The first reason," he said, "was j
that all of the Republican senators I
hated Wilson, and they would have
opposed anything that he sponsored.
The second reason was that these
same men wanted Wilson to put some
Republican senators in his cabinet, j
When he refused to do this, they were !
determined more than ever to oppose j
him."
While discussing the Balkan prob-1
lem in its relation to the League of j
Nations, Dr. Jordan gave an account of ;
his personal experiences in Bulgaria j
and Greece when he visited there in !
1914, just before the war broke out. j
"Macedonia (a part of Bulgaria) j
has been ravaged by nearly every
army in the world since the time of
Alexander the Great," he stated, "and
Pet rich, a little town about the size !
of May field, has been the center of
this cauldron of war."
Dr. Jordan showed the utter fruit- '
lessness of this village being bom- j
barded by the British, the Austrians, j
and the Greeks at different times.

''The League of Nations has practi- j
cally abandoned the famous Article X !
■which provides that all the members !
of the League take up arms and de
clare war on any country which does
not obey its orders," declared Dr.
Jordan last night at his Thursday
Evening Conference.
"The League cannot have teeth in
this respect, but it can and is showing j
its real power as a purely arbitration
board," said I)r. Jordan. He gave two
instances in particular in which the
League exercised a large amount of j
"moral persuasion."
The first illustration of this type of
influence which Dr. Jordan presented
was a Greek-Bulgarian quarrel in
which Greece declared war on Bul
garia, claiming that she had a right
to do so because Bulgaria killed a
Greek.
But when the League showed its dis- j
approval of the action of Greece,
Greece withdrew her armies and paid
143,000 dollars reparation to Bulgaria.
Mussolini Backs Down
The second illustration of the power I
of the League of Nations was that of j
Mussolini's withdrawal of one of his i
battleships which threatened to attack
Greece when the League expressed its 1
dislike of his conduct.
Dr. Jordan commented on the vari- j
ous reasons for the United States not
joining the League. It seems to be his j
belief that there are two main reasons I
why this country did not join.
"The first reason," he said, "was j
that all of the Republican senators I
hated Wilson, and they would have
opposed anything that he sponsored.
The second reason was that these
same men wanted Wilson to put some
Republican senators in his cabinet, j
When he refused to do this, they were !
determined more than ever to oppose j
him."
While discussing the Balkan prob-1
lem in its relation to the League of j
Nations, Dr. Jordan gave an account of ;
his personal experiences in Bulgaria j
and Greece when he visited there in !
1914, just before the war broke out. j
"Macedonia (a part of Bulgaria) j
has been ravaged by nearly every
army in the world since the time of
Alexander the Great," he stated, "and
Pet rich, a little town about the size !
of May field, has been the center of
this cauldron of war."
