# INTEREST IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL DECLARED BY SWIM CHAMPIONS
## Wainwright, Riggin, Visit Brandstens; Are on Vaudeville Tour 
### 
Although you may be a swimming
champion, that doesn't hinder you
from being interested in football
games. At least, Helen Wainwright
and Aileen Riggin, America's premier
divers, who visited the campus today
as guests of Mr. and Mrs. Ernst Brand
sten, are so interested in football that
they say they hope to leave San Fran
cisco ahead of schedule today in order
to arrive in Los Angeles in time to
see the U.S.C.-Notre Dame football
game.
Gertrude Ederle, conqueror of the
English channel, who is appearing in
San Francisco on the Pantages cir
cuit in the same act with Miss Wain
wright and Miss Riggin, was uuable
to come to the campus as planned be
cause of a conflicting engagement.
The three aquatic stars have worked
together for ten years. They met each
other as members of the Women's
Swimming Association in New York
when they were children, and devel
oped under the coaching of Lou Han
ley.
Golf and tennis and all outdoor
sports have a great attraction for
swimmers is the belief of Miss Wain
wright. She gives as a reason for her
dislike of the professional work she
Ts doing the fact that there is so little
opportunity to get out-of-doors.
Miss Wainwright emphatically as
serts that neither she nor Miss Riggin
nor Miss Ederle will attempt to swim
the Catalina Channel in the Wrigley
Ocean Marathon, as they could make
as much money on the vaudeville cir
cuit during the time in which it would
be required to train for the swim to
equal the prize offered.
"Stanford is one of the most beauti
ful colleges I have ever seen," de
clares Miss Wainwright, "and I think
the campus is marvelous from what I
have seen on my inspection tour to
day."
Both Miss Riggin and Miss Wain
wright expressed much regret at their
inability to give a diving exhibition
at Stanford, but lack of time prevented
their doing so.
