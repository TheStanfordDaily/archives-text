Professor A. M. Espinosa of the Ro
manic Languages department just re
turned from the meeting of the State
Teachers Association held during the
Thanksgiving holidays at Austin,
Texas.
The outstanding feature of the con
ference was the new tendency to
eliminate the teaching of Spanish and
all Romance languages from the Texas
colleges and confine them exclusively
to the grade and high schools. Profes
sor Espinosa was accompanied on his
trip hy Professor Cuhberley of the De
partment of Education.
