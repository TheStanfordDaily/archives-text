# FROSH BASKETBALL TEAM COMPARABLE TO FORMER SQUADS
## Yearlings Fast, Light This Year; Berg Keynote Of Offensive 
### Clif Moore 
Coach Howard Mitchell's freshman
basketball team, although suffering de
feats in its first two starts in the
interclass series, shows promise of
developing into a Quintet comparing
favorably with Stanford yearling
teams of the past few years. The fresh
man hoop squad has met for only a
few practice sessions so far this sea
son, but after the holidays Mitchell
intends to give the group of candidates
a regular workout every afternoon.
This year's team seems to be of the
fast, light variety, in distinct contrast
to the heavy teams that have repre
sented Stanford freshmen for the past
three years. Red Berg, diminutive
Babe forward, is the keynote of the
freshman offensive this year. Berg, a
former member of the state champion
ship Stockton High School team, is a
fast man, and his work this season is
expected to be the bright light of the
freshman games.
Berg's running mate, Long, a former
Lowell High School forward, is also
fast and light. Fislibeck, another San
Francisco boy, has dominated tilings
around the center position so far this
season. Steinback, one of the 1930
football players, is expected to try out
for the pivot job, and he and Fish
beck will probably stage a good fight
for the first-string position.
Nye, former Alhambra High School
star, is the most likely candidate for
running guard. Bush, 1930 football end,
and a teammate of Berg's at Stockton
High School, is sure to work into the
lineup at either running guard or cen
ter. So far, Goldie, at standing guard,
lays first claim for the back position.
Dietrick, another Stockton High
School player, is Goldie's chief rival
for the standing guard position. Moore,
Lodi High School player, stands a
good chance to work into a position at
either guard or forward, and Thomp
son. captain of last year's Phoenix,
Ariz., High School team, is a likely
candidate for the standing guard job.
The freshmen showed plenty of
speed and scoring ability in their re
cent game with the juniors, and with
practice the yearlings will show a well
balanced quintet.
