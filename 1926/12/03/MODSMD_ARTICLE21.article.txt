# NEW DRAMATIC STARS APPEAR IN 1929 PLA
## Davis Predicts Future for Cast of Kirkpatrick's "Book of Charm" SMALL TOWN SATIRIZED Comedy Presents Characters Of Average American Village 
### 
Ihe nucleus of Stanford dramatic
talent for the next three years will be
offered for inspection tomorrow night
as the curtain rises at promptly 8:20
o'clock in the Assembly Hall for the
production of the 1926 Sophomore
Play, "The Book of Charm," by John
A. Kirkpatriek.
Kathleen Fitz, Ewart Goodwin, Ed
wina Ewing, Janet Harris, Tom Thur
low, Nelson Spinks, George Mott,
Clara Weatherwax, Irving Frolilich,
Malcolm Soltan, Louise Buxton, Sam
Hayes, Elizabeth Cramer, and Eliza
beth C lark, the cast for the Kirkpat
riek comedy-satire, with one exception
will be playing their first important
roles, Hayes having taken a major
part in both "The Green Goddess" and
"Meet the Wife" during his freshman
year.
Actors Praised
Few productions, however, of a na
ture restricting cast membership to a
single class, could boast of parts so
capably filled as are those of the cur
rent presentation. Even Gordon Davis,
Stanford Dramatic Director, is strong
in his praise of the talent offered, and
predicts a forthcoming array of future
campus favorites well comparable to
those first presented by "Captain Ap
plejack" of 1025, when Delmer Daves,
Lloyd Nolan, Marjorie Allen, Aileene
Burks, and Patrice Nauman first made
their debut as unknown sophomores.
Final dress rehearsal for the pro
duction was held last evening, al
though some work in placing finishing
touches on the lines of the play will
be done today and Saturday. No re
hearsal will be held tonight in order
that cast members and the stage crew
may attend the Sophomore Cotillion,
which, with "The Book of Charm," are
the major events on the Sophomore
Week program. v
Kirkpatrick's play marks the return
of the sophomore production to com
edy, "In the Next Room" of last year
having been a mystery drama. "The
Hook of Charm" is unique, however, in
that it presents to the campus for the
first time in late years a comedy based
on the activities of small-town charac
ters. Here is presented typical figures
of the average American village—the
overly-stout gossip, the minister and
his wife, the school teacher, the doc
tor —all parts adapted to afford an au
dience of metropolitan environment
entertainment.
"Charm" Desired
The play deals particularly with the
desire of the heroine to leave the littla
mid-western village that is her home
and to go to New York where one
meets only "charming people," and
everyone has a "mission" to perform.
The lengths to which her parents and
the country lad who is in love with
her go to detain her, aided and abetted
by the "Book of Charm" which fortun
ately arrives on the scene, form the
central theme of the plot.
Tickets to the production, as well as
the traditional "rough seats," may be
obtained at the A.S.S.U. ticket office,
at Crandall's in Palo Alto, or at the
Assembly Hall ticket office tomorrow
night at 7 o'clock.

Actors Praised
Few productions, however, of a na
ture restricting cast membership to a
single class, could boast of parts so
capably filled as are those of the cur
rent presentation. Even Gordon Davis,
Stanford Dramatic Director, is strong
in his praise of the talent offered, and
predicts a forthcoming array of future
campus favorites well comparable to
those first presented by "Captain Ap
plejack" of 1025, when Delmer Daves,
Lloyd Nolan, Marjorie Allen, Aileene
Burks, and Patrice Nauman first made
their debut as unknown sophomores.
Final dress rehearsal for the pro
duction was held last evening, al
though some work in placing finishing
touches on the lines of the play will
be done today and Saturday. No re
hearsal will be held tonight in order
that cast members and the stage crew
may attend the Sophomore Cotillion,
which, with "The Book of Charm," are
the major events on the Sophomore
Week program. v
Kirkpatrick's play marks the return
of the sophomore production to com
edy, "In the Next Room" of last year
having been a mystery drama. "The
Hook of Charm" is unique, however, in
that it presents to the campus for the
first time in late years a comedy based
on the activities of small-town charac
ters. Here is presented typical figures
of the average American village—the
overly-stout gossip, the minister and
his wife, the school teacher, the doc
tor —all parts adapted to afford an au
dience of metropolitan environment
entertainment.
"Charm" Desired
The play deals particularly with the
desire of the heroine to leave the littla
mid-western village that is her home
and to go to New York where one
meets only "charming people," and
everyone has a "mission" to perform.
The lengths to which her parents and
the country lad who is in love with
her go to detain her, aided and abetted
by the "Book of Charm" which fortun
ately arrives on the scene, form the
central theme of the plot.
Tickets to the production, as well as
the traditional "rough seats," may be
obtained at the A.S.S.U. ticket office,
at Crandall's in Palo Alto, or at the
Assembly Hall ticket office tomorrow
night at 7 o'clock.
