# Stunts and a Band
## 
### 
And now conies the word that Stanford may not stage bleacher
stunts at the Stan ford-Alabama classic in the Pasadena Rose Bowl on
New Year's day. The colored card stunts are some of the outstanding
attractions of a football game that the spectators really enjoy. The
spirit behind them may be one of the reasons that goes a long way
towards explaining why the general public will support college football
and will not attend professional matches.
Then, too, such stunts are peculiarly characteristic of the West.
No such elaborate stunts as are staged by Stanford are ever attempted
in the eastern part of the country. So, in view of the fact that it is an
East-West game we should show the Easterners everything that is
typical of this section of the country, such as good weather, good foot
ball teams and good rooters stunts.
It may mean considerable extra work for those in charge of organ
izing the section, but consider the effects of the labor. Realizing that
the stunts used at the Big Game received such widespread approval,
why not use some of the same designs over in an effort to conserve
energy at this busy part of the quarter.
And then again there is doubt as to whether the Stanford band will
be taken south. In order that the day be complete it is imperative that
the band be there in full force.
Last year neither Washington nor Alabama had their bands at the
East-West contest, and a group of musicians from Pasadena had to be
imported for the day. This New Year's day we want the Stanford
Band on the field playing college airs.
Now, if you will allow us to make one more suggestion, you can
then go and study for the finals: We think it would be a fine idea to
have a Stanford float in the Rose Carnival. We can think of many
floats that would be most fitting for Stanford to present, but we must
first get the sanction for such an exhibition before we pick our subject
matter.
