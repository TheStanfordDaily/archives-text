"A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION"
Once again the bulletin board in
front of the Administration building
Imparts to a curious campus the in
formation that a "certain organiza
tion" has been placed on social proba
tion for violating one of those many
rules (hat prescribe the exact amount
of dignity and decorum appropriate to
any brawl thrown on this campus.
This would be a very sad case, an
extremely sad case in fact, if only
being put on social probation meant
anything. As a matter of fact the sum
total of Inconvenience Involved is
this: the fraternity in question cannot
give campus dance for one
year.
In the meantime the brothers will
strive manfully (and we hope figura
tively) to drown their sorrows. Of
course. It's a great burden. Not that
the brothers intended to give another
dance this year anyhow. It's the prin
ciple of the thing. Of course, the fel
lows will do what they can to get
along on the meager entertainment

I provided hy the theatres, cafes, et-
I cetera, etcetera, in the nearby city of
, San Francisco. There, of course, they
1 will be safe, far removed from the
iniquitous inuuence of campus dances.
At any rate the dignity of the Uni
versity has been preserved, and the
administration has discharged the duty
it owes to our parents in the matter of
moral protection. The members of the
Men's Council (God bless their indo
lent souls!) can sleep peacefully in
the knowledge that they have dis
charged the function of their office
which, for the benefit of the uniniti
| ated, may be described as the impos
, ing of sufficient penalties for moral
infractions to keep a naturally rather
good-natured faculty from becoming
meddlesome.
Roy! Shut that door! We feel a
draught of freedom!
