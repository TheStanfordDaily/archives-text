The Editor, Sir:
The examination which tests the
student's capacity in a subject is cer
tainly desirable, unless his capacity
is shown in some other way.
As far as the writer knows each fac
ulty member makes such examinations
as he wishes. If final grading on one
comprehensive final for which a stu
dent can cram is vicious, and for most
courses it admittedly is, why not give
several examinations during the quar
ter with the "final" having only its
proportionate weight in the final
grades?
If the ideal examination should
measure reasoning power, ability to
make deductions from fresh data in
the subject matter of course, why not
write examination questions accord
ingly? The so-called "yes-no" questions
or sentences with missing words to
be supplied, have the virtue of uni

form grading but little else to com
mend them.
The instructor who for the whole
quarter knows what he wishes a class
to accomplish and who gives clear in
struction to that end and who, for his
own and students' benefit, tests the
effectiveness of his teaching frequently,
will find a class entering the final
examination with confidence.
We expect football men to prepare
for each game, and to improve with
each game placed, and to depend very
little on practice done during "the day
before." Both players and coach may
well be emulated by students and fac
ulty in their spirit of thorough accom
plishment, and they do not balk at the
final game. â€”A. B. Clark.
