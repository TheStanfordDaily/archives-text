# RED GRANGE WILL GO BACK TO COLLEGE TO OBTAIN B.S. DEGREE
## Will Return to Illinois as Soon as He Finishes Making Picture 
### 
In answer to a question as to wheth
er he intended to return to Illinois to
complete his last semester, Red
Grange answered a reporter of the
New York Daily News, "Yes, you can
bank on that. People think I have
given up school, but at the conclusion
of this football season I am to make
one more picture and then I am going
back for my Bachelor of Science de
gree."
Grange complained against the
American sports world for its hero
worship. He says, "If the gridiron fans
will only remember that I am a foot
ball player and not a three-ring circus,
everything would be fine."
Last year the physical strain of
playing as many as four games a week
ended in his collapse at Pittsburg.
However he declares, "I am not sorry
I turned professional even after my
experiences."
He was asked whether he was in
favor of his younger brother playing
professional football. "Yes, by all
means," he replied, "providing he fin
ishes his college gridiron career. I do
not approve of anyone leaving college
to play ball. The experience would do
my kid brother a world of good and
furthermore he is entitled to earn
some money. The men playing profes
sional football are not bums, they are
the highest types of college men, fine
speciments of manhood that I am
proud to be associated with."
