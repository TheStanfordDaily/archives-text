## 
### 
"The campaign headquarters of the
parties of Great Britain were quite
'American,' or shall we say quite
familiar," said Professor Edgar Eu
gene Robinson, speaking of the Eng
lish political system in one of his
articles to the San Francisco "Argo
naut." Dr. Itobinson, professor in the
History department, is now making an
extended tour of England and Europe,
and has contributed articles from time
to time to the "Argonaut."
He continues in liis description:
"There are the placards, the posters,
the badges; the automobile 'errand
boys' and the groups of speakers 'on
tour'; the committee rooms filled with
'workers' and much smoke."
Professor Robinson arrived in Eng
land at the time of an important bye
election in the North Cumberland dis
trict to fill a seat in the House of
Commons. He went to Carlisle which
was the center from which the cam
paign was directed. "Carlisle proved
an interesting English city," he ob
serves. "It was to this city that Presi
dent Wilson made a pilgrimage to the
church of his grandfather in 1919.
"Walking down the station street
about 10 o'clock one morning I was
amazed to find the way was blocked
for a time by the passage up the street
of a flock of sheep. Yet things do not
move as slowly as that would indicate.
Everyone was most eager in giving us
directions, and took ample time to do
it. Usually their directions proved to
be correct and helpful. Not always.
Seeking the headquarters of one of
them most famous crackor companies,
we were misdirected three times. And
finally it was a train car conductor
who put us right, and he proved to be
an ex-soldier who had lived seven
years in Great Falls, Montana, and
how he would like to get back to the
States!"
Dr. Robinson visited (he House of
Commons while it was in session.
