# YALE INVITES 5000 TO THEATRE OPENING
## 
### 
Five thousand people have been in
vited by Yale to attend the opening
of her new University theatre on Fri
day, December 10. The production,
"The Patriarch," is written by Boyd
Smith, a student in the Department
of Drama, students having charge of
all details. The theatre was built for
Professor George Pierce Baker and
given to the university by Edward S.
Harkness.
Professor Baker tried in his course,
"47 Workshop," given at Harvard be
fore he went to Yale two years ago,
to show that creative theatrical work
can be taught, or at least helped, by
teaching. The course considers book,
acting and scenery as organic ele
ments of the theatrical whole, rather
than drama in terms of literature to
be read against a background.
