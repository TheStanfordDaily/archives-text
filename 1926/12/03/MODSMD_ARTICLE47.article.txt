# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Will tomorrow be the Day of Days
for the University of Southern Cali
fornia or the Day of "Daze"? Will the
"Thundering Herd" of U.S.C. trample
! underfoot Knute Rockne's Rollicking
| Ramblers, or will they in turn be
drawn and quartered and made the
; "piece de resistance" of an Irish Bar
; becue? This is, of course, a vitally im
portant game for both teams. For the
once-beaten Notre Dame team, a vic
tory means a near claim to the na
i tional championship; while for the
1 doughty Trojans, it will mean national
recognition as one of the country's
j greatest teams and prestige lost in the
Stanford defeat more than regained.
i Watta battle boys, watta battle!
| Rockne versus Jones; O'Boyle, Flana
gan, etc., versus Kaer, Drury and Co.
There are four Ail-American backfield
men right there. The Notre Dame
team that I saw beat the Army should
win, but think these facts over before
you bet any money. In 1925, lowa jour
neyed to Southern California and was
beaten 18 to 0 by Howard Jones's
team. Syracuse and Missouri went out
to Los Angeles the year before and
were trimmed 16 to 0 and 20 to 7. On
New Year's Day, 1923, Penn State
played U.S.C. in the Pasadena Rose
Bowl and fell before the Westerners
j 14 to 3. Let those figures sink in.

The long train trip, change of cli
mate and water, and the fact that
U.S.C. was playing before a home
crowd and usually on their own
grounds, all helped to defeat the in
vading teams from the East and Mid
dlewest. But Notre Dame, the team
that plays U.S.C. in the Los Angeles
Coliseum tomorrow, made the trip in
1924 and heat Stanford 27 to 10. Don't
overlook that little item, either!
Mr. Christy Flanagan, shown above,
went in fresh in the third period of
the Notre Dame-Army game last month
and, on a nice little cut-back in toward
tackle from a shift play, ran 63 yards
to the only touchdown. But it was to
the other ten Notre Dame men on the
field that the glory belonged, just as
much as to Flanagan. That is what
U.S.C. will be up against: perfect team
playâ€”perfect co-ordination, perfect in
terference, perfect tackling. I fear to
morrow night won't be the end of a
Perfect Day for the Trojans!


OFF AGAIN, FLANAGAN!
