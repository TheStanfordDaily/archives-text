# FAIRY TALES NEEDED BY YOUTHS--BAILEY
## 
### 
"Between the fairy-tale age of seven
to twelve and the adult ape in reading
of fifteen, there is a gap that needs to
be bridged," said Dr. Margery Bailey i
of the English department, in her talk
before the Stanford Dames yesterday I
afternoon in the Stanford Women's j
Clubhouse.
"At this intermediate age young
people need bromides and plenty of
them. The novels of 'The Duchesse'
are not adequate as they are more or |
less trashy. Fairy stories of a better
type would fill this need, I believe," !
continued Dr. Bailey. "They would I
need to be more than a mere roman- i
tie, happy-ending story, however. A i
hidden allegorical meaning, ccnccaled j
under humor or plot, would be ad van- ;
tageous."
It is this that Dr. Bailey has done
in her two books of fairy stories: "JThe
Little Man with One Shoe," and j
"Seven Peas in One Pod," selections i
from which she read at the meeting !
of the Dames. In these she hides ad- j
vice and life lessons under the cloak
of her story.
