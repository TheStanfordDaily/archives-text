tributions. Manuscripts for the opera will be handled by R. Frank Baker,
Chairman of the Manuscript Committee, who desires that all books for the
show be sent to him at Box 1357, Campus. Baker declares that the plots can
revolve around a costume play or a more modern musical show, although the
prevalence of the costume variety in the past few years makes the snappy

! musical type more desirable. Half an
act of dialogue should also be submit
ted in addition to the plot.
Herbert A. Klein, chairman of the
i usic committee, requests that good
ideas for a melody be submitted to him
at Box 1842, Campus. Composers need
know nothing about orchestration, as
acceptable melodies will be put in
technical form by an orchestrator.
The Dramatic Council will care for
the financial and managing end of the
production, but the creative and artis
tic side of the show will be solely in
the hands of students. As this
is the only campus production
with the exception of the Football
Show, which is solely the work of
students, Gordon Davis, director of
dramatics, urges all students with
either literary or dramatic ability to
try their hands at composing books
and lyrics.
