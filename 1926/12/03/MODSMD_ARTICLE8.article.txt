1929 Never in Danger
The 1929 team were never in dan
ger of losing and exhibited a smooth
ness and teamwork that clearly out
classed the 1927 team and kept it
guessing during the entire playing
period.
As was indicated in the previous
games the seniors serious handicap
was their inability to get the ball in
the basket.
The sophomores showed a marked
degree of improvement since their vic
tory over the freshmen. Smalling,
playing guard, and McCandless, at
center, carried the brunt of the 1929
scoring machine, each of them making
eight points.
Senior Seconds Win
The second-team of the seniors won
over the second-year men 9-6. The
game on tiie whole was loosely played
and rough in nature, fourteen personal
fouls being called.
