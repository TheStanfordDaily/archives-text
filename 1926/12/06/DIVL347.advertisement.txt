The first requirement of holiday etiquette
THE use of Christmas Seals is more
than the correct thing to do. It is the
right thing to do.
In afew short years, the organized health
work of the Tuberculosis Associations
has helped to cut the tuberculosis death
jrate by more than half. This work is
financed by the sale of Christmas Seals.
At the head of your Christmas list, write
"Christmas Seals." Buy them. They bring
to you the pleasure of unselfish gener
osity. They bring health and happiness
to many. Buy Christmas Seals first —and
then seal every letter, parcel, and holi
day Greeting Card with these holiday
health seals.
