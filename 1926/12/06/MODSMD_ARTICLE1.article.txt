# STIFF TRAINING SCHEDULED FOR VARSITY SQUAD
## Bill Clark Injured Friday; May Be Out for Rest Of Hoop Season CAGE PRACTICE RESUMED Scrimmage Used to Prepare Team for a Trip South During Holidays 
### Fred Speers 
Bill Clark, oustanding running
guard candidate on the varsity
basketball squad, injured his knee
in practice Friday. His knee was
injured early this fall in an inter
class football game and was not
completely healed when the sec
ond injury occurred Friday. Doc
tors at the Palo Alto hospital,
where Clark is now confined, ex
pect him to be able to leave early
this week if the dislocation can be
properly set.

Following a week-end layoff Coach
Husky Hunt's varsity cage squad will
take up practice again in the pavilion
this afternoon. Hard work with plenty
of stiff scrimmaging will be handed
out to the basketball candidates from
now up to the time for the southern
tour during the Christmas vacation,
according to the Cardinal mentor.
Hunt plans to use a variety of com
binations in his scrimmages this week
in order to see which will be best for
action in the holiday games. At the
same time he will be working to de
velop reserve strength in the stand
ing guard position which is at present
practically cinched by Biaggini, one
of the most finished players on the
squad but one who is hampered some
what by lack of height.
No Wholesale Cuts
Instead of passing out another
wholesale cut in the squad, as he did
last week, the Cardinal mentor plans
to shave his squad down to a more
workable size by dropping off one or
two men at occasional intervals.
Thirty-six men survived his initial cut
last Wednesday.
Because several of his potentially
good varsity men are on the ragged
edge scholastically, Hunt may find
himself in a difficult position follow
ing examinations this quarter. To all
appearances the varsity mentor has
several two- and three-corner fights
looming for first-string berths but
these may be checked by disastrous
ineligibilities.
Clark Out
Especially promising at this time
look the candidates for center who
are headed by the experienced Wally
Jayred, closely followed by McCand
less and Dobson. McCandless in par
ticular is an excellent shot, but he
lacks polish in his footwork and in
handling himself in action.
With Bill Clark out of the running
now ;for probably the entire season,
Hunt is faced by an unforeseen prob
lem. Clark was one of the tallest candi
dates and his competitors for the run
ning guard berth are both smaller men
than he. Vincenti and Riese, the two
main candidates, are both able players.
Of the two Vincenti is the most ; cool
and collected player but he lacks the
speed and ability of Riese in making
short effective passes in working the
ball down the floor. The latter, how
ever, has found it difficult in the past
to remain at top form in the course
of a long arduous season.
The interclass series has given Hunt
an opportunity to see several unknown
-quantities perform, and of these he
was especially pleased with Bowers
who will be given an opportunity to"
show his wares in the scrimmages this
week and next.
