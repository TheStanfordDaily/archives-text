# BOXING, WRESTLING RELATIONS WITH U.C. REMAIN UNSETTLED
## 
### 
Possibilities of Stanford and Cali
fornia resuming relations in boxing
and wrestling this year are still unde
cided and a definite decision will prob
ably not be marie until next semester,
according to word received from the
general manager's office at Berkeley.
The two institutions broke off rela
tions in boxing several years ago, duo
to the Cardinals' refusal to participate
against certain Bear fighters. The
wrestling teams followed suit the fol
lowing year, and negotiations to re
vive meets in the two sports have
since been unsuccessful.
