# CONVALESCENT HOME BEQUEST OF $40,000 TO PROVIDE NEW UNIT
## Additional Ward Involves Raising $25,000 for Yearly Upkeep 
### 
. "Mrs. Katherine Babcock's $40,000
bequest to the Stanford Convalescent
Home will be used for the construc
tion of a new unit, in accordance with
the stipulations of her will," stated
Dr. D. Charles Gardner yesterday.
"This new unit will involve raising
$25,000 yearly to provide for upkeep.
It was specified by Mrs. Babcock that
the money must go toward a new
ward, to be added to the present
equipment, but as yet plans for its
disposal have not been made," said
Dr. Gardner.
Dr. H. K. Faber, medical director,
has suggested that the Babcock fund
be used to establish a ward for young
mothers just discharged from the city
hospitals, but who have not yet re
gained their full strength, or whose
babies need special care not possible
in the home. This may possibly be
established in conjunction with a new
department for children under three
or four years of age.
Home Grows
Through such bequests as Mrs. Bab
cock's and numerous smaller dona
tions, the Home has grown from its
beginning as a summer camp for con
valescent children, established by Dr.
Gardner, to its present scope. During
its first two summers 120 children
were cared for. The Stanford Hospital
In San Francisco requested that a
home be established to provide for the
year-around care of convalescent chil
dren. Such a home was started on the
campus in 1919, and was moved the
following year to that part of the old
Stanford residence which survived the
earthquake.
McLaughlin Unit Added
On September 22, 1923, the Kate D.
McLaughlin Unit was dedicated, the
gift of Mrs. Henry Crocker of San
Francisco. Its cost, with equipment,
amounted to $f>o,oioo. It is built on the
site of the Stanford residence.
Under the care of Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, chairman of the Endowment
Committee, the endowment now
amounts to about $143,000. The list
of benefactors is a long one, and in
cludes donations ranging in value from
two dollars, to such a bequest as Mrs.
LJabcock's. One source of income is
from tilt? Community Chest of San
Francisco, whose? t'oniribution last
year amounted to $18,000. Mrs. P. J.
Treat is chairman of the House Com
mittee, and Miss Ruth Spande is su
perintendent.

. "Mrs. Katherine Babcock's $40,000
bequest to the Stanford Convalescent
Home will be used for the construc
tion of a new unit, in accordance with
the stipulations of her will," stated
Dr. D. Charles Gardner yesterday.
"This new unit will involve raising
$25,000 yearly to provide for upkeep.
It was specified by Mrs. Babcock that
the money must go toward a new
ward, to be added to the present
equipment, but as yet plans for its
disposal have not been made," said
Dr. Gardner.
Dr. H. K. Faber, medical director,
has suggested that the Babcock fund
be used to establish a ward for young
mothers just discharged from the city
hospitals, but who have not yet re
gained their full strength, or whose
babies need special care not possible
in the home. This may possibly be
established in conjunction with a new
department for children under three
or four years of age.
Home Grows
Through such bequests as Mrs. Bab
cock's and numerous smaller dona
tions, the Home has grown from its
beginning as a summer camp for con
valescent children, established by Dr.
Gardner, to its present scope. During
its first two summers 120 children
were cared for. The Stanford Hospital
In San Francisco requested that a
home be established to provide for the
year-around care of convalescent chil
dren. Such a home was started on the
campus in 1919, and was moved the
following year to that part of the old
Stanford residence which survived the
earthquake.
McLaughlin Unit Added
On September 22, 1923, the Kate D.
McLaughlin Unit was dedicated, the
gift of Mrs. Henry Crocker of San
Francisco. Its cost, with equipment,
amounted to $f>o,oioo. It is built on the
site of the Stanford residence.
Under the care of Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, chairman of the Endowment
Committee, the endowment now
amounts to about $143,000. The list
of benefactors is a long one, and in
cludes donations ranging in value from
two dollars, to such a bequest as Mrs.
LJabcock's. One source of income is
from tilt? Community Chest of San
Francisco, whose? t'oniribution last
year amounted to $18,000. Mrs. P. J.
Treat is chairman of the House Com
mittee, and Miss Ruth Spande is su
perintendent.
