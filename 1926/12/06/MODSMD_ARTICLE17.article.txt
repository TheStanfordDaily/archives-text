# CARDS DRAW HARD GRIDIRON PROGRAM FOR 1927 SEASON
## FIRST GAME WITH U. S. C. Stanford Is Assigned Five Conference Games In Six Weeks 
### 
With Stanford drawing what is re
garded as the most strenuous schedule
for its 1927 football season of the nine
teams in the Conference, and with the
announcement that the University of
California, Southern Branch, will be
admitted to the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Athletic Association to play
its first game as a member in 1928,
the annual two-day session of Athletic
managers and faculty representatives
was concluded at the Biltmore Hotel
in Los Angeles. The visitors were
guests at the Notre Dame-U.S.C. game
after the meeting.
St. Mary's Game First
The first game of the season will be
on October 1, when the Stanford team
meets St. Mary's at Palo Alto. Two
weeks later the Cardinals open their
conference schedule when they play
the University of Southern California
at Palo Alto, and within the space of
five weeks from that date play four
of the hardest teams in the circuit.
The one-week lay-off comes the Satur
day preceding the California struggle,
which is scheduled for November 19.
Oregon Aggies, Oregon University,
Washington, and California follow the
U.S.C. game in order, giving Pop War
ner's men five Conference games next
season. With the exception of the Tro
jans, Idaho, and Montana, who play
only four games, all the teams have
five championship contests.
All of Stanford's 1927 Conference
tilts will be played in the stadium ex
cept the one with Washington, which
is scheduled at Seattle next year.
No game has as yet been billed by
Coach Warner for the respite of the
week preceding the "Big Game" and
while California is having a hard bat
tle with Washington, the Cardinals
will be building up strength in antici
pation of the annual Berkeley clash.
