# DEMONSTRATIONS OF SPARK-JUMPING HELD IN RYAN LABORATORY
## 
### 
Approximately 2000 campus people
visited the Ryan laboratory Friday to
see a 2.100,000 volt "spark" jump a
twenty-foot gap. Demonstrations be
gan at 9:30 o'clock in the morning
and were repeated every hour there
after. the last one being at 4:20. The
experiment was repeated twice for
each group.
Professor Ryan, who conducted the
demonstrations, arranged the public
exhibitions at this time because the
high voltage apparatus is soon to be
connected up for other laboratory ex
periments which will make it impos
sible to place the huge electrodes the
present distance of twenty feet apart.
A second demonstration will be
given in the near future for neighbor
ing off-campus people.
The feat of high-voltage spark-jump
ing has never before been accom
plished and was made possible by the
co-operation of large electrical com
panies with the University.
The purpose of the work in the
laboratory is to find practical methods
whereby electrical power at high volt
ages can be transmitted over long
distances with as little loss as pos
sible.
