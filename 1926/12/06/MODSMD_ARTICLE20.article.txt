# ZOMBRO LEADS PHI DELTS TO TRACK VICTORY
## Ross Nichols Takes First Places in High, Low Hurdle Events ELEVEN RECORDS FALL Breakers Second to Winners By Four Points; Theta Chi Third 
### 
Fred Zombro led the Phi Delts to a
first place in the finals of the intra
mural track meet last Friday by piling
up two first places and one second,
which made up a good part of the
twenty-three points that the winners
had amassed at the end of the meet.
This nearly gave Zombro undisputed
title of high-point man of the day, but
he was tied for that honor by Ross
Nichols of Delta Tau. The two events
that Zombro won marked the estab
lishment of two of the eleven new in
tramural records that were made dur
ing the meet.
Breakers Second
Separated from the winners by only
four points came the Breakers with
19; third place went to Theta Chi
with 14%, and Delta Chi and Delta
Tau tied for fourth with 13 apiece. The
other organizations finished up as fol
lows: Encina fourth floor west, 7;
Alpha Delt, 6; Sigma Nu, 5; Delta
Upsilon, 5; Beta Theta Pi, 4; EI
Toro, 4; Los Arcos, 2; Encina second
floor west, 1; and Theta Xi, 1; El
Tigre, 1-3; Toyon, 1-3; Sigma Chi, 1-3.
Unattached entries took 16V2 points.
Starting the record-breaking, Fred
Richman, Theta Chi, took first in the
100-yard dash in 10:1. Only inches be
hind him came Zombro, who took sec
ond, and Bly, Delta Chi, third. Henry
S. Coe, unattached, turned in a time
of 4:52:1 for the mile, which, though
not breaking any records, gave him
first place. He kept up a big lead all
the way which was not threatened at
all. McDougall of the Breakers and
L. M. Smith of Los Arcos took second
and third respectively.
Kingsbury Wins 440
Gibson Kingsbury, Encina, romped
off with the 440 in 52:4, making an
other record. He took the lead and
kept it, while behind him McGuire,
Phi Delt, and D. Smith, Los Arcos, had
a race for second and third. All that
can be said about the hurdles is that
Ross Nichols took the five points for
each almost without working up a
sweat. In the low hurdles, Wool of the
Breakers, and Clohan, unattached,
placed, respectively, while in the 120-
yard high hurdles, second and third
went to Bullis, Beta Theta Pi, and
Helmke, Encina.
Bly of Delta Chi made Zombro do
some strong running in the 220, finish
ing only a step and a-half back of the
Phi Delt runner, who finished in 22:4.
Carr, Theta Chi, made himself evident
by coming in close behind Bly.
Swain Breaks Record
Coe, who had previously taken first
in the mile, entered the two-mile run,
and, after taking the lead at the end
of the first mile, lost it again on the
last turn to Robert Swain, Sigma Nu,
who finished in the record time of
10:36.
In the 880-yard run, Emil Blumen
thal, unattached, came up from third
place early in the race and passed the
leader, French, of the Breakers, a
hundred yards from the tape. Queen,
unattached, took third place in this
event. The relay, which, with the cen
tury, provided the closest finishes of
the day, was won by the Theta Chi
team, consisting of Uhl, Duncan, Carr,
and Richman. The Delta Chi runners,
after making a loosing race in the first
th""e laps, started out in the last
stretch with a vengeance to overtake
the leader. Down the last fifty yards
the Delta Chi and the Theta Chi men
ran neck and neck, but in the last
steps the Theta Chi runner forged
ahead and won â€”by two inches.
Krenz Takes Weights
Eric Krenz of the Breakers won
both the shot-put and the discus throw,
chalking up 43-3 in the first and 134-2
in the second. Helmke, Theta Chi, and
Rothert, Encina, took second and third
respectively in the shot, while
places went to Evans, Alpha Delt, and
Goodcell of Delta Chi, in the discus.
Fred Zombro brought three points
more to the Phi Delts by taking first
in the broad jump with a mark of
22-8. Second went to Lauritzen, Alpha
Delt, and third to Anderson, Theta Xi.
High Jump Tied
The high jump was tied between

Luther Rupe ,E1 Toro, and Byron Bry
ant, Phi Delt, at 5 feet 9 3-8 inches.
Third was also tied between Richman,
Theta Chi, and Broomell, unattached.
George Fontaine of Delta Upsilon
made eleven feet in the pole vault;
second place was won by Nichols,
Delta Tau, with 10-6. Third was tied at
ten feet between Mitchell, El Tigre,
Shallenberger, Toyon, and Bowers,
Sigma Nu.
The last event, the javelin, which
cinched the Phi Delt victory, was won
by Goodcell, Delta Chi, at 160-2%.
Smalling of Phi Delt took second, and
Bullis, Beta Theta Pi, took third.
