# Throttling the Students

### 
It appears that President E. D. Kohlstedt of Dakota Wesleyan Uni
versity is all against the idea of his students debating the comical ques
tion entitled "Prohibition." A forensic society at the Dakota institution
chose as a subject for intercollegiate debating, "Resolved, That the
Volstead Law be amended to permit the sale of light wines and beer."
Immediately Kohlstedt termed the question "unethical" and declared that
no student at his college would defend the subject, although he was
willing to have a Wesleyan team uphold the negative of the question.
The protest was seconded by the Northern State Teachers College
of Aberdeen which even went so far as to say that the subject "verges
on the repudiation of the Constitution."
From all appearances it looks as though the inhabitants of Dakota
have entirely forgotten the clause in the constitution pertaining to the
freedom of speech. And above all, where should the value of national
laws be discussed, if not in colleges and universities whose students are
to be, theoretically, the leaders of the nation in the near future?
The Syracuse Daily Orange expressed an excellent opinion in com
menting on this situation when it stated:
"Such a situation as this calls to mind the state of affairs in
Japan where the government department of education is con
sidering the formation of a thought-control bureau as part
of the department of justice, which will attempt to guide the
thoughts of Japanese students in the proper channels. Or one
is reminded of Italy where Mussolini in his efforts to make
the central government all-powerful is growing more and more
severe in his legislation restricting individual liberty."
The spokesman of Aberdeen College stated in addition that "This
college stands for law enforcement." The sentiment is a very worthy one.
Laws should be enforced—as long as they are laws. But there is no
legal or moral obligation to prevent a free discussion of any law to
determine whether or not it should be retained or repealed.
The Volstead act and the eighteenth amendment arc still experiments.
Whether or not they will be successful in accomplishing their purpose,
and whether or not they arc resulting in more harm than good, are very
pertinent questions at this time. When five of eight states who voted on
the Prohibition issue at the last election voted Wet it cannot be con
sidered that Prohibition is a settled question.
While the Volstead act i* a law it should lie enforced and law-abiding
citizens should, at the least, acquiesce in its enforcement. However, there
is 110 need for any such illustration of absolute asininity as those quoted
above.
