SAYING IT WITH FLOWERS
In today's paper a gentleman be
wails the wearing of corsages by some
of the talent imported for the recent
Sophomore Cotillion. His objection to
this violation of tradition is rather
Well made, but he appears to have

not fulfill their function, they are de
signed to be a part of the education
of the Stanford student, as well as to
furnish a form of recreation. The stu

whom they offer something new. No
one will contest the point that the son
of poor parents, whose residence is in
a region of tall and uncut timber, has
a great deal more to gain from a cam

spring of a wealthy line of city dwel

Anything which tends to make the
campus dance any more expensive
than it now is tends to put it beyond
the reach of the one class that might
consequently be benefitted by it. Con
quently a rule has been made to the
effect that flowers shall not be worn
at a Stanford formal. As rules go, this
one is not so bad. It deserves to be
observp<?.

is the motive behind the cry raised in
every university in the land at the
false representation of college life by
the gentlemen in Hollywood.
Who among the insulted parties has
not secretly longed to render soulful
music on a ukelele, to wear pereptu
ally spotless flannels, to perform im
possible feats on the gridiron, and to
wed an heiress with forty horsepower
