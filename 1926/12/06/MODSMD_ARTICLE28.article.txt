j imports, at all; but the fatuous dis
j regard of one of Stanford men's oldest,
I most-cherished, and most-democratic
traditions: the custom that at STAN
FORD there shall be no corsages ten
: dered to, nor worn by, the belles
| dames at a campus formal.
Stanford women, than whom there
are none finer, do not expect corsages
at a Stanford dance. Do the imports
hold higher sway?
Formerly it was usual to see in the
erstwhile Daily Palo Alto a notice that
at a forthcoming pavilion dance, ac
! cording to tradition, any women wear
i ing corsages would be requested to
remove them, or else leave the floor.
1 Has the sophomore class cast off the
j tradition of older Stanford men—or is
it merely uninformed? Whichever is
i the case, POURQUOI?
Don't blame the cotillion committee
| —they did a fine job. Blame the
j jingoes who so clearly demonstrated
| how little they know of Stanford and
j worth-while traditions here. Of course
I the imports are darn nice girls, and
j maybe they'll go on them there giraffe
parties, too; so the boys want to be
awfully nice to them. But where do
they think they are—at CAL?
Very earnestly.

Editor, The Bull Session:
You must have more skins than an :
onion. Seems like every other barn |
door on this campus has a hide of
yours nailed to it. This puts you in
the same class as the Y.M.C.A.
Now I can maintain a benevolent j
neutrality toward the business of flay-1
ing A Certain Organization, but I'm
getting tired of the perpetual drubbing
that's handed the Bull Session and
your columnist side-kick. Cabbages.
Cabbages' friends rallied to the de
fense. however, and I'll bet Mr. Alden
is pretty darned sore, too. But you re
main (pardon me) naked to the stormy :
blasts, and all that, your friends rest- :
ing secure in the knowledge that you >
can take plenty care of yourself.
Carry on. Bull Session, carry on!
Your silence of the last couple of days
alarms me. Your stuff is clever and
readable, the objects of your attacks
vulnerable, and your viewpoint, like j
your prose, is sane and clear, even !
when you are not misguided. All is j
not lost while the Bull Session sur
vives.
As for your critics —well, blame
from some sources is the truest praise.
One might wish that those who View
With Alarm would cease from com
paring you with Mr. Mencken. Appar
ently that is regarded as the ultimate
of invective. Yet even if it is allowed
that Henry is blood brother to Satan,
I find no parallel between Bull Session
and Mercury. Your stuff seems to me
to be both in style and thought as
original as anything can be in this
repetitious world. The imitation of |
Mencken I deplore; so I enjoy the Bull !
Session the more.
It's an old fight, this, and you bear j
your sword bravely.
And heaven knows it's a relief to
have anything in the Dip—pardon,
Daily—that will stir a ripple of
thought.

Editor, The Bull Session:

onion. Seems like every other barn |
door on this campus has a hide of
yours nailed to it. This puts you in
the same class as the Y.M.C.A.
Now I can maintain a benevolent j
neutrality toward the business of flay-1
ing A Certain Organization, but I'm
getting tired of the perpetual drubbing
that's handed the Bull Session and
your columnist side-kick. Cabbages.
Cabbages' friends rallied to the de
fense. however, and I'll bet Mr. Alden
is pretty darned sore, too. But you re

Carry on. Bull Session, carry on!
Your silence of the last couple of days
alarms me. Your stuff is clever and
readable, the objects of your attacks
vulnerable, and your viewpoint, like j
your prose, is sane and clear, even !
when you are not misguided. All is j
not lost while the Bull Session sur
vives.
As for your critics —well, blame
from some sources is the truest praise.
One might wish that those who View
With Alarm would cease from com
paring you with Mr. Mencken. Appar
ently that is regarded as the ultimate
of invective. Yet even if it is allowed
that Henry is blood brother to Satan,
I find no parallel between Bull Session
and Mercury. Your stuff seems to me
to be both in style and thought as
original as anything can be in this

Editor, The Bull Session:
You must have more skins than an :
onion. Seems like every other barn |
door on this campus has a hide of
yours nailed to it. This puts you in
the same class as the Y.M.C.A.
Now I can maintain a benevolent j
neutrality toward the business of flay-1
ing A Certain Organization, but I'm
getting tired of the perpetual drubbing
that's handed the Bull Session and
your columnist side-kick. Cabbages.
Cabbages' friends rallied to the de
fense. however, and I'll bet Mr. Alden
is pretty darned sore, too. But you re
main (pardon me) naked to the stormy :
blasts, and all that, your friends rest- :
ing secure in the knowledge that you >
can take plenty care of yourself.
Carry on. Bull Session, carry on!
Your silence of the last couple of days
alarms me. Your stuff is clever and
readable, the objects of your attacks
vulnerable, and your viewpoint, like j
your prose, is sane and clear, even !
when you are not misguided. All is j
not lost while the Bull Session sur
vives.
As for your critics —well, blame
from some sources is the truest praise.
One might wish that those who View
With Alarm would cease from com
paring you with Mr. Mencken. Appar
ently that is regarded as the ultimate
of invective. Yet even if it is allowed
that Henry is blood brother to Satan,
I find no parallel between Bull Session
and Mercury. Your stuff seems to me
to be both in style and thought as
original as anything can be in this
repetitious world. The imitation of |
Mencken I deplore; so I enjoy the Bull !
Session the more.
It's an old fight, this, and you bear j
your sword bravely.
And heaven knows it's a relief to
have anything in the Dip—pardon,
Daily—that will stir a ripple of
thought.

j imports, at all; but the fatuous dis
j regard of one of Stanford men's oldest,
I most-cherished, and most-democratic
traditions: the custom that at STAN
FORD there shall be no corsages ten
: dered to, nor worn by, the belles
| dames at a campus formal.
Stanford women, than whom there
are none finer, do not expect corsages
at a Stanford dance. Do the imports
hold higher sway?
Formerly it was usual to see in the
erstwhile Daily Palo Alto a notice that
at a forthcoming pavilion dance, ac
! cording to tradition, any women wear
i ing corsages would be requested to
remove them, or else leave the floor.
1 Has the sophomore class cast off the
j tradition of older Stanford men—or is
it merely uninformed? Whichever is
i the case, POURQUOI?
