# SOPHOMORES TO VIE WITH 1928 FIVE IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
## Undefeated Quints Play to Settle Honors of Fall Interclass Meet 
### 
Interclass basketball champions for
the next year will be decided this
afternoon when the sophomores tangle
with the junior team in Encina gymna
sium. The second team game starts at
4:15 o'clock while the first teams take
the floor at 4:45 o'clock. Only the first
team game will have any bearing on
the title.
Both class teams have come through
the series without a defeat and appear
evenly matched. The sophomore
- cagers trounced the freshman team by
the score of 25-18, while s the juniors
also triumphed by the close score of
15-14. In the second game of the series
the 1929 team beat the 1927 men by
31-17 and the juniors drew victory
from the senior team with a 15-10
count.
This would indicate, as far as com
parison of score can indicate, that the
sophomore team will go into this
afternoon's battle with the odds favor
ing it. Another reason that the twen
ty-niners should be favorites is that
they have always had a large turnout
from which good substitutions could
be made, while the juniors so far have
been handicapped as they have had
only a limited number of players
from which to choose.
Newcomb, 1928 guard, and Nye, for
ward, have been showing good form
for their team, and with McDonald/
Ray, and Dobson, should provide plen
ty of action for the sophomore quint.
On the 1929 team, McCandless at cen
ter and Smalling, playing guard, have
been high-point scorers in the totfrna
ment.
