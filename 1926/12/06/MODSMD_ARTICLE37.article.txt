Publication of "Early Mental Traits
of Three Hundred Geniuses," second
volume of the "Genetic Studies of
Genius" series being published under
the editorship of Dr. Lewis M. Ter
tnan, is announced today by the Stan
ford University Press.
The book is the work of Dr. Catha
rine M. Cox, formerly of Stanford
University and now psychologist for
the Central Clinic in Cincinnati. Dr.
Cox was assisted by Dr. Terman, Lela
O. Gillan, and Ruth Haines Livesay.
"Early Mental Traits of Three Hun
dred Geniuses" presents a psycho
logical study of the early mental de
velopment of 301 men and women liv
ing during the period 1450-1850, se
lected as being the most eminent indi
viduals of the period. The study is
based on historical records of the
childhood and youth of the subjects.
Soldiers, statesmen, poets, musicians,
scientists, leaders in every field have
been chosen, including such figures as
Napoleon, Mozart, Washington, Pas
teur, Lincoln, Galileo, John Adams,
and Zwingli.
An independent study, the book sup
plements the first volume of the series,
"Mental and Physical Traits of a
Thousand Gifted Children," by Dr.
Terman, published in 1925. This first
volume presents the results of a care
ful investigation of the mental, physi
cal, and character traits of 1,400 con
temporary school children. The two
volumes afford a comparison between
the recognized geniuses of the world
and a representative group of children
of today who, by natural talent, give
promise of future greatness.
The two volumes comprise the re
port thus far published of an extensive
investigation being conducted by Dr.
Terman and his associates, which took
definite form under a grant from the
Commonwealth Fund in 1921.
Volumes 1 and 2 of the series are
now on display at the Palo Alto Book
Shop and at the Stanford Bookstore.
