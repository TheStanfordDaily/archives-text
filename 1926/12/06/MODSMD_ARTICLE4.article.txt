# SOPHOMORE PLAY DRAWS LAUGHTER FROM AUDIENCE
## 
### Dudley Ross 
Through the three acts of the sopho
more play Saturday night the audience
was kept in constant and hilarious up
roar at the pititul etiorts of the Ras
pers and Joe Pond to keep Ida May
from succumbing to the lure of the
charming people of New York. With
the exception of the slowness of part
of the first act there was scarcely a
let-up in the laughter drawn from
Kirkpatrick's "The Book of Charm."
Humor Is Cruel
But despite the fact that plenty of
fun was furnished for the overwhelm
ing majority of those present, despite
the entirely excellent work of the en
tire cast, the play had to our notion a
bitter and noxious taste. The humor is
cruel; It is not funny to see people
of any sort embarrassed. True wit,
true comedy does not lie in the utterly
serious and rather heart-breaking
methods employed to keep Ida May
at home. One does not want to laugh
at the jumble created by the too
literal use of a book on charm by an
unsophisticated household.
Perhaps the humor of the situations
comes from the sense of superiority

which we get from seeing the antics
of those less well-endowed than our
selves, from the feeling that we would
never resort to a book of etiquette to
acquire that "elusive, indefinable qual
ity, charm." The acting on the naive
dream that the book sold by the wily
salesman will prove a solution to the
problem is not a source of laughter;
the laughter, seems too much akin to
ridicule of others for an ignorance
which is no fault of their own. The
deficiency, however, is probably our
own.
Casting Excellent
Practically without exception the
casting and acting in the play was
excellent. More particularly, the work
of Ewart Goodwin as Joe Pond and of
Edwina Ewing as the gushing Mrs.
Wilson was outstanding, while men
tion must surely be made of Irving
Frohlicli and his exceptionally smooth
and glib salesmanship line.
In the role of Joe, Goodwin had a
portrayal which was difficult to sus
tain throughout the play, but there
was never a slip, and he succeeded in
giving life and reality to the trials of
the country-town drug clerk. Miss
Ewing gave one of the cleverest comic
characterizations that have been seen
on the campus stage in a good while.!
Her work provided the best bit of
true comedy in the whole production.
Ida May Negative
Kathleen Fitz, as the city-struck Ida
May Harper, seemed somewhat mis
cast in the first act. But that portion
of the play was at all times difficult
to put across, and the smoothness and
naturalness i of her acting improved
with the course of the comedy. The'
part of Ida May was so dominated by
that of Joe Pond that it was almost
negative, and she was made a figure
head through all the action.
%As Mr. and Mrs. Harper, Sam Hayes
and Louise Buxton did excellent work.
It would have been easy to turn the
portrayal of the Harpers into gross
caricature. To maintain the tenor of
both roles with sincerity is a task to
tax "the abilities of even professional
players.
In all instances the minor roles were
effectively carried out. It is seldom
that a campus cast is found in which
the actors take their roles with such
assurance and truth.
Unlimited cuts are being allowed
upperclassmen at Haverford College.
