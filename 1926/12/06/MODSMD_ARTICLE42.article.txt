# NOTRE DAME ELEVEN DEFEATS U.S.C. WITH LAST-MINUTE SCORE
## 
### 
The University of Southern Cali
fornia eleven suffered its second 12-13
: defeat when it emerged second best
" in the game with Notre Dame on Sat
urday.
♦ Rockn's "Fighting Irishmen" recov
: ered some of the prestige they lost
* after their struggle with Carnegie the
week before, more so, bcause they
were fighting against odds at Los
- Angeles. The high point of the game
• came when, in the fourth quarter with
' four minutes to go and U.S.C. leading
12 to 7, Rockne put in Art Parisien, a
substitute halfback who had watched
most of the year's games from the
bench. Parisien made a beautiful pass
to Neimic, which brought the ball to
U.S.C. 's 20-yard line. After a loss on
an attempted line buck, Parisien again
fell back and again passed to Neimic,
who caught the hall on the 3-yard line,
and stepped over the goal line for the
winning tally.
Morton Kaer, U.S.C. stellar half
back, was forced to leave the field in
the third quarter, while Morley Drury
was unable to finish Jaecause of his
bad knee. Boeringer, Notre Dame and
probable Ail-American center, played a
wonderful game, as did Captain Jeff
Cravath of U.S.C., but had to leave the
play. Even Flanagan, who defeated
the Army with his 65-yard run, had to
be helped off the field by two subs.
Taking into consideration the fact
that Notre Dame is reputed to be one
of the best of the Eastern elevens,
and that Stanford defeated U.S.C. by
the same score, the best of the East
and the best of the West are nearly
equal. With things standing as they
are, the conflict at Pasadena on New
Year's Day is found to decide the
resting-place of the national cham
pionship.
