# KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL!

Most football coaches teach their
charges to fall on a loose ball, preach
ing the safety-first doctrine in prefer
ence to taking the risk of losing the
ball by trying to scoop it up and run
with it. But many big games have
been won by some alert youngster
who took a chance and picked up a
bounding football and raced to fame
and glory with it despite the coach's
instructions.
Mr. Sam White, of Princeton, was
one of these, but he prepared,for his
two big gridiron moments by long
hours of practice on the football field
after his team mates had gone to their
dinners. But Sam was rewarded for
his perseverance in learning how to
scoop up a loose ball, and, because of
his ability to do so, beat both Yale
and Harvard in 1911. In the Harvard
game, White grabbed a fumble on. his
own fifteen-yard line and sped down
the field to a touchdown. In the Yale

game, two weeks later, he repeated
his stunt, this time dashing over sixty
yards through a muddy field to win
once more for Princeton.
It was a fumble in this year's Penn-
Chicago game that brought up an in
teresting point which will cause the
football rule-makers to do some tall
thinking the next time they assemble.
Murphy, the Penn quarter-back, was
tackled heavily in the corner of the

field, just as he was apparently about
to score a touchdown. The ball bound
ed out of his arms, across the goal
line, and then hopped over the side
line when it was extended on into
the end zone. According to the rules,
a ball fumbled in the field of play be
longs to the team which last touched
it, and shall be brought in fifteen yards
from the spot where it crossed the
side line. So, as it was Penn's ball

fifteen yards in from where it crossed
the side line, it was in the end zone,
and hence a touchdown.
Question: what is to prevent a run
ner from purposely rolling the ball
ahead of him and out of bounds when
he is being tackled close to the side
line, and in so doing scoring a touch
down, as in the above case, or gaining
a first down, or putting his team in a
better position for the next play?
