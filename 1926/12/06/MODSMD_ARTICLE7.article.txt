# Branch Campus Is Nearly Completed for Occupation
## 
### 
Students at the Southern Branch of
the University of California may be
able to move on to the new campus
at Westwood in January, 1928, if the
building plans of the Hoard of Regents
progress as rapidly as expected.
A library and an auditorium and
classroom building will be the first
two erected. They will be in the
Mediterranean style of architecture.
The other buildings to be constructed
have not as yet been decided upon by
the Regents.
