lected by managers of the A.S.S.U.
concert series in collaboration with
representatives of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, will constitute
the program to be given in the pavilion

Wednesday evening.
Notable among the selections on the

Blessed Spirits" from the opera "Or

Bizet's Suite Picked
Another composition which will be
given is Bizet's suite "L'Arlessienne."
Bizet wrote these compositions as in
cidental music to a play of the same

music still remains popular. Overture
from "Mignon," Ambroise Thomas'
most successful composition, will also
be presented.
Other numbers will include "Five
Waltzes" by Brahms, the ballet music
from "Prince Igor," Borodin's Russian
opera, and Irish country dances by
Percy Grainger. In addition, Hertz will
lead the orchestra in an interpreta
tion of Massanet's ever-popular "Medi
tation" from "Thais."

The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra was organized in 1909 by the
San Francisco Musical Association.
Under the leadership of Alfred Hertz,
who has been director since 1915. the

recognition, particularly in its inter
pretation of Wagnerian music.
