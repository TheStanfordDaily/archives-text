# MAGAZINE SALE INDICATES CAMPUS CULTURAL TREND

### Maxine Cushing 
Stanford men and women may not
now appear to be more cultured, high
brow, aesthetic, than they were in
1924, but judging from their change
in literary taste —revealed by compar
ing lists of magazines sold by the
Bookstore during November, 1924, and
November, 1926, this revolutionary
statement would seem to be true.
In the first place, America's greatest
institution, The Saturday Evening
Post, has slipped from eighty to fifty
copies a week, a decrease of 38 per
cent, in two years. College Humor's
sales have slid frcm sixteen to twelve
copies a month. "Movie" magazines
have gone from twenty-four copies of
seven different magazines to only
seven copies of three motion picture
publications. Red Book and radio
magazines are no longer carried.
On the other hand, whore only seven
of the more "highbrow" magazines
such as Harpers and Atlantic Monthly
were sold per montli in 1924, this num
ber has risen to thirty-seven copies of
ten different magazines. Life has in
creased in popularity from six to seven
copies, but to protect the theory ad
vanced in the first paragraph this in
crease may be laid to students' recog
nition of improvement of the play re
views in Life.
Likewise the addition of Popular

i Mechanics to the Bookstore's list may
be regarded as a result of increased
registration in the School of Engineer
ing; American Magazine's jump from
; six to ten copies as a portent of sud
, den desires on the part of graduates
to become successful business men;
Chaparral's present forty copies a
month to true Stanford loyalty. Ameri
can Mercury's jump from one to six
copies a month remains a mystery.
It must be admitted, however, that
I the theory of increase in culture is not
upheld in all cases. For instance, the
combined Cosmopolitan magazine now
rates twenty copies a month, as com
pared with a former ten copies and
six for Hearst's Magazine. Too, Ladies'
j Home Journal, Vogue, Vanity Fair,
and Theatre have been added to the
i present list for an aggregate of thirty
five copies a month. This probably
' means, however, no more than that,
i the movement for women's rights did
not. reach the campus until after the
1924 figures had been compiled.
