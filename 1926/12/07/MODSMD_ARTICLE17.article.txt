# RUGBY TEAM ORGANIZES FOR CONTESTS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA DURING HOLIDAYS
## Stanford Squad Favored by American Olympic Officials for Participation in 1928 Games at Amsterdam 
### 
nETURNING from a meeting oÂ£ the American Olympic Association held in
Washington, D.C., Harry W. Maloney, director of minor sports, stopped
off at Vancouver, 8.C., and succeeded in scheduling three rugby games with
Canadian teams for the Christmas holidays.
The Stanford rugby squad will play the Vancouver Rowing Club, the
University of British Columbia, and a team composed of All-Stars of Van
couver on December 27 and January 1. Seven Stanford rugby players have
already signified their intention of representing the University and will form
a strong nucleus for the team.
Lynn Farish, Phil Clark, Swede Leistner, Charley Doe, Norman Cleavelaud,
Dud DeGroot, and Pat Carey will probably make the northern trip. As coach
of the rugby squad, Maloney yesterday said, "In case Stanford University can
get behind this Olympic project relative to rugby, to represent America in
the 1928 games, with the entire personnel of twenty men to be made up of

past 01* present Stanford men, the
favorable publicity that would be
Stanford's would be immeasurable."
With ten of the twenty men of the
1924 Olympic rugby team and GO per
cent of the 1920 Games rugby team
taken from Stanford, the American
Olympic Association is looking for
ward to recruiting from the ranks of
the Cardinals the entire 1928 team to
represent America in Amsterdam, Hol
land.
Stanford was honored at the Olym
pic Games meeting when Coach Ma
loney was chosen a member of the
committee in charge of arrangements.
At various times during the meeting,
General Charles Sherrill, past presi
dent of the International Olympic
Committee, spoke in a very compli
mentary manner of Stanford's co-oper
ation in international athletics.
