# The 						1928 Olympic Games
## 
### 
Through the efforts of Harry Maloney a Stanford University rugby
team may represent the United States at the Olympic Games in 1928.
All of which means an excellent opportunity for the University to achieve
outstanding distinction at the games, for never in the history of Olympic
Games has a complete team for any sport been furnished exclusively by
any one institution or organization.
\\ hile rugby has been played only intermittently on the Coast, and
not at all in any other sections of the country, it was felt that it was the
best and most sporting thing to have a team to defend the championship
won by America. And as California, and more particularly, Stanford,
is the only place at which rugby has been maintained on any basis what
soever, it is from this University that America's team will be chosen.
In the past Stanford has contributed largely to the success of the
rugby teams which have participated in world competition at the
Olympics. The University, through its alumni and undergraduates, has
kept up rugby relations with Canada through the annual trip of a picked
team to British Columbia for a Christmas series. This year, the team
will probably be composed exclusively of Stanford men, undergraduates,
and alumni. vl&|"
Thus in the past few years Stanford has given practically the only
impetus to the perpetuation of rugby in the United States. The decision
of the American Olympic Association recognizes Stanford's efforts. It
throws on the University a peculiar responsibility; it gives Stanford the
unparalleled chance to have a complete team representing America in the
forthcoming Olympic championships.
