# A 						Graduate Research Club

Action on the suggestion of the Graduate Women's Club that the
graduate students should form an organization on the same order as the
Faculty Research Club might conceivably fit in well with the graduate
departments of the University.
With the increased number of advanced students coming from all
parts of the country the graduates might obtain much from the inter
change of ideas and the presentation of research objects before such a
group. The matter is one which is of interest chiefly to those who are
engaged in concentrated individual work.
Besides the educational value which would be received from such a
club under proper organization, closer co-operation of interest between
students doing research would develop. And if such a society is wanted
at Stanford, it is up to the graduates themselves to take the first steps
toward its formation.
