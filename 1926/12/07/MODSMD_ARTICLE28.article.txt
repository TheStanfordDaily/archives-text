Penny by penny, dime by dime, five
million dollars is the sum to be raised
in the last live week's of 192G to fight
tuberculosis. Five hundred million
pennies; half a billion Christmas seals
■—what a tremendous undertaking this
must be!
At least 150,000 people, it is esti
mated. will volunteer part or all their
time during this period. They are
drawn from every walk of life. Per
hnps a banker in Texas acts as treas
urer; the governor of Wyoming en
dorses the Job in a proclamation while
876 school teachers in Minnesota take
charge of the sale in their communi
ties, and 6140 school children in Unite
scamper from house to house with
seals in their hands and "Please buy"
on their lips. Women's clubs us well
as men's frequently co-operate in a
body, sofnetimes handling every detail

of the campaign. The list of local
workers is often a roster of the public
spirited people of the locality. Catho
lic and Protestant, Gentile and Jew,
Democrat and Republican, step from
their separate paths to join the line of
those who sell as well as buy Christ
mas seals in every city, town, hamlet,
and crossroads in the country. More
than 3000 such groups are now ready
l>r the sale's opening on Thanksgiv
ing Day.
The Christmas seal is now 19 years
old. The first year, 1907, the amount
raisdd was only $3000. But see how
the infant grew into a child, and now
almost into a man, for the second year,
the return was $135,000i; when six
years old, it was $450,000; at 14 years
in 1921, $3,522,000; in 1924, $4,500,000,
and in 1925, $4,879,400. It. is not too
much to expect 150,000 volunteers to
make it. $5,000,000 in 192fi.
