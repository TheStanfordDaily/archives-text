The Editor ,Sir:
After reading the various attacks
upon the sanity and morality of that
emancipated spirit, the editor of the
Bull Session, I feel urged to break a
lance in his defense. Not, mind you,
that he really needs the vinegar and
hyssop of my pen. But I do feel that
a little boswellian approbation at this
time will at least show that he is not
altogether forsaken.
The editor of the Session has
charged people with being sophomoric,
with being pests, and finally with
being illogical. He plainly intimates
that there is a lot of apple-sauce and
bunkem in the world. Those of us who
cannot stomach his sophistication, turn
his own guns upon him and inform
him that his old man is the same.
There has been a considerable ex
change of these courtesies and I am
beginning to wonder if some of us are
not taking the Bull Session a bit too
seriously.
I am at that peculiarly interesting
period of undergraduate incubation
when individualism is invariably asso
ciated with iconoclasm. It pleases me
to have someone, myself preferably,
pick out the flaws and inconsistencies
in people and things. It is highly
gratifying to know that life is not
putting anything over on one. For this
reason I sympathize with the Bull
Sessionist. I really believe it would be
a shame to "throttle him," as some of
our contemporaries would have. He
represents the spirit of the age and
the tendency of youth. So let him sing j
his song; some of us find it pleasing, i
—w.s. !

| penses, I wish merely to offer a plea
!in behalf of myself and ray fellow
heathens. We don't want our souls
| saved. That is the simple truth, how
ever shocking. We may be dreadfully
! perverted; we may be overlooking our
duty to society; we may be missing
all the richness of life; but we really
are quite harmless. And who knows
but that, although we don't fall in
with the idea of organized friendliness,
i we honestly do have ideas of our own,
and are interested in finding what we
i consider "the best that is known and
thought in the world."
I suggest, therefore, that we of the
heathen tribes leave the "Y" to the
fun of saving its own soul, and that
the "Y" leave us in peace to enjoy our
own fun. —D. Bowen, '27.

The Editor, Sir:
We are tempted to remark that this
argument regarding the "Y" is becom
ing, if not positively sophomoric, at i
least somewhat childish. But I myself, [
being of somewhat stubborn and per- j
verse nature, cannot resist adding a
"last word."
I will not dare to remark in public, j
especially as I contemplate signing my
name to this epistle, that the "Y" is
lacking in "soul." Granted that enough
of this spirit exists to warrant ex-

The Editor, Sir:
The graduate Women's Club has re
cently been bestirring itself on the
question of the social life of the gradu
ate students as a group, discussing the '
situation in connection, especially,
with the growing emphasis upon grad-1
uate work at Stanford University. In
response to a general sentiment that
something ghoifld be done, the Club
experimented with the plan of inviting
the men graduate students to its teas
occasionally. The natural antipathy of
the American man toward "teas" pre- j
eluded any startling success along that i
line, but it has not silenced the feeling !
that a certain amount of group social-1
life is desirable among graduates as |
well as undergraduates.
A suggestion has been offered that
the graduate students should form a
club on the plan of the Faculty Re- ■
search Club, combining an intelligent
interest in research in all departments
of knowledge with its organized social
intercourse. This letter is written in
the hope of finding out what graduate
students generally think about the j
whole question of their group social
life, and the above suggestion in par
ticular. Perhaps better ideas would
come out of a discussion of the matter,
and if public sentiment approves, prac-'
tical steps may be taken next quarter.'

The Editor ,Sir:
After reading the various attacks
upon the sanity and morality of that
emancipated spirit, the editor of the
Bull Session, I feel urged to break a
lance in his defense. Not, mind you,
that he really needs the vinegar and
hyssop of my pen. But I do feel that
a little boswellian approbation at this
time will at least show that he is not
altogether forsaken.
The editor of the Session has
charged people with being sophomoric,
with being pests, and finally with
being illogical. He plainly intimates
that there is a lot of apple-sauce and
bunkem in the world. Those of us who
cannot stomach his sophistication, turn
his own guns upon him and inform
him that his old man is the same.
