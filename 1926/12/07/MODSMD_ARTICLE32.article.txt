Early Autumn. By Louis Bromfield.
(Frederick A. Stokes Company,
$2.00.)
"Early Autumn" is a story of mod
ern times, laid in a New England set
ting of old customs and prejudices. It
deals" with a family whose name was
once glorious in the history of the
country; a family that is now but a
proud name about an inner core of
dessicated rottenness. The Pentlands
live in the past, cherishing their past
glories and their respectability above
all else.
Olivia Pentlands. at forty still
young and beautiful, is the wife of
Anson Pentlands, who is absorbed in
a life-work: a book entitled "The Pent
lands Family and the Massachusetts
Bay Colony." An "outsider," she
strives to gain for her daughter, Sybil,
what she herself has lost under the
rigid rule of tradition, and to keep
alive her delicate son, the last of the
Pentlands. At the same time she
battles to dissipate the exhilirating
thrall thrown over her by a fascinat
ing. coarse-fibered Irishman.
"Aunt Cassie," old John Pentlands'
sister, is the personification of the
Pentlands' attitude. To her the name
of Pentlands is something sacred, to
be guarded from all contamination of
modern ideas. The family traditions
are her bible, her rules of conduct.
She is really a pathetic figure in her
allegianco to the past and her fierce

devotion to the forjner glories of the
Pentlands family.
Into this tangle of complexities, this i
deadening enchantment of a past over I
a present, come Sabine Callendar, |
hard, worldly, and cynical, and her |
scientifically inclined daughter. The- !
rese. Sabine had tied from the same
narrowing life twenty years before J
and returns in a spirit of malicious
defiance. She and old John Pentlands,
the patriarch of the family, with the
aid of Jean de Cyon, a vigorous young
American of dubious parentage, pre- !
cipitate the climax of the unhappy j
muddle.
