# Five Colors Planned for Pasadena Rooters' Stunts
## 
### 
Five colors will be used in the i
rooters' stunts to be given at the Stan- >
ford-Alabama game in Pasadena on j
New Year's Day as a result of action j
taken by the Rally Committeo last
night.
Stunts with regulation rooter cards
will honor the Alabama team, Stan
ford, and the Tournament of Hoses,
under whose auspices the Bast-West ;
encounter will be staged. A rooting
section of 90ft students is expected,
but the definite number cannot be
determined until after Ihe ticket sale j
tomorrow and Thursday. As usual,
white shirts, bow ties, and rooter hats
will be required of all who hold places
in the section.
