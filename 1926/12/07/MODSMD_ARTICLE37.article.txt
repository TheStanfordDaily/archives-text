# VARSITY WORKS OUT IN SIGNAL PRACTICE FOR ALABAMA GAME
## 
### 
Despite the fact that Coach Pop War
ner was not. directing practice, the
Stanford varsity worked out yester
day afternoon under the direction of
Tiny Thornhill and Charley Winter
burn in preparation for the game with
Alabama at Pasadena on New Year's
Day.
Not all of the regulars were on hand
for the signal practice and limbering
up exercises portioned out by the
coaches, although enough of the squad
wan present to form three teams. Sig
nals are causing the men the most
trouble as over two weeks have
elapspd since they have been called
upon to respond to the once familiar
digits.
Warner will go over the Alabama
plays with the squad later in the week,
but intensive training for the contest
will not start until after final examina
tions. Special attention will be given
to the development of a strong de
fense to meet the Alabama attack,
which is regarded as one of the best
in the East.
Reports from Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
say that the Crimson Tide is working
out strenuously for the game which is
to settle the football championship of
the United States. Coach Wallace
Wade is impressing his men that
Stanford can be beaten just as Wash
ington was last season. The 20 to 19
score in the Washington game last
year, when the Southerners were sup
posed to be a much weaker aggrega
tion than the Huskies, proves that the
Alabama team is a bunch of fighters
and will offer the stiffest possible
competition.
