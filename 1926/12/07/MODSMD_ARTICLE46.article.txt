Beating with every Trail woman's
pulse and rooted in some men's hearts
is an admiration for those noble men
with, broad chests and cardinal red
sweaters who stroll magnificently to
and fro on the Quad, with big Varsity
"S'b" shining upon their fronts. To
day, women can only admire. Once,
however, they shared this honor. Nine
Stanford women have been awarded
the emblem.
Women Play U.C.
On April 4, 1896, the members of
the women's basketball team played a
similar team from the University of
California. The game was played at
an armory in San Francisco. An en
thusiastic audience of nearly seven
hundred turned out. Men, however,
were debarred as spectators from the
game, out of deference to the U.C.
team, as there was such a ruling at
Berkeley.
Dr. Clelia D. Mnsher, '93, then direc
tor of Roble Gymnasium, and present
medical supervisor, coached the team.
The members were Captain Stella Mc-
Cray, Mary Merritt, Esther W. Keifer,
Frances Tucker, Laura Ducker, Anita
Corbert, Agnes Morley, Martha Clark,
Jessie Ryan. After the game, which

was played to a win of 2 to 1, the nine
were presented with the Varsity "S."
Costumes Feature
As this was one of the first of the
intercollegiate games played in the
United States, it attracted a good deal
of attention. The next morning the
Chronicle and Call appeared with
heavy stories of the match. The cos
tumes were one of the features of the
game. The Stanford team wore "red
tassled caps, which fell off frequently."
One referee wore "a modish black silk
gown with a Persian collarette of pink
silk."
When the team returned to the cam
pus they were met with a great ova
tion. According to the Examiner, "The
news was received at Encina hall with
a wild burst of enthusiasm. The boys
came pouring out of their rooms and
the building halls were filled with
yelling students." The student body
turned out to meet the train, and "as
sembling at the station an hour be
fore the train was due, they whiled
the time away with songs and col
lege yells."
The Stanford Hall of Fame should
undoubtedly include these nine wom
en, the only feminine wearers of Block
"S's" â€”that have won them on an ath
letic field!
