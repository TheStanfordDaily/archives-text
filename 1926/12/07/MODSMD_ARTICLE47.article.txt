# Canoeists Rejoice as Workmen Raise Western Bank of Campus Lake
## 
### 
Stanford canoe enthusiasts and
lovers of water and other sports are
gleefully rejoicing over their prospects
for a successful aquatic season as Uni
versity workmen raise the west bank
of the campus lake.
Although Searsville is not yet over
flowing, still the continued rain storms
may soon fill Lagunita. Lest the turbu
lent waters burst their bounds and
flood adjoining fields, a layer of straw,
secured from the lake bottom, is being
used to reinforce the western bank.
