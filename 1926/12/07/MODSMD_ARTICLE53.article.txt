# FREAK FOOTBALL
## 
### Feg Murray 
The other day I discussed some
gridiron oddities, among them the 1925
Northwestern University captain's
tackle of a teammate in the mud, and
a high school youth winning a game
disguised as an official. Here are some
more freak football incidents, which
further prove the assertion that the
game is like golf, because "anything
can happen" in it.
In the 1921 Wisconsin-Illinois game,
the Badgers scored three freak touch
downs, while making only two first
downs in the whole game. After the
Illinois punt, which was blocked and
rolled back forty yards to be recov
ered for a Wisconsin score, a Badger
grabbed the free arm of an Illinois
back who was attempting an end run,
and swung him off his feet, snapping
the ball out of his other arm directly
into the hands of a teammate, who
raced seventy yards for a touchdown.
In the Chicago-Illinois game of 1916,
the Illinois captain punted, the ball

hitting the foot of a teammate deep
in Chicago's territory. The men near
the ball waited for the referee to de
clare the ball dead, but the official
had not seen the off-side, and failed
to blow his whistle. As the two teams
grouped around, waiting, "Red" Gra
ham, of Chicago, an Olympic pole
vaulter of 1920, picked up the oval
and trotted sixty yards down the field,
while the crowd laughed and hooted.
But Red's freak touchdown was al

lowed, just the same.
"Snooks" Dowd, of Lehigh, once
covered nearly two hundred yards in
making a touchdown, after first run
ning almost the length of the field in
the wrong direction. Other players
have done this same stunt with less
happy results, among them Oscar
Knop, of Illinois, who once raced
thirty-five yards towards his own goal
line before he was tackled by a team
mate.

The play in which the ball actually
did travel 221 yards occurred in the
University of Southern California
i California-Tech, game of 1924. Cal.
j 1 ech. kicked off, the ball rolling over
| U.S.O.'s goal line. While the rest of
the players started for the twenty
yard line, thinking the ball would be
put in scrimmage there, as usual,
Green, of Southern California, walked
out onto the field without having
touched the oval down, and when he
had passed the group of players, sud
denly started sprinting down the field.
Two opponents gave chase, and finally
tackled him on the two-yard line, and
tackled him so hard that he dropped
the ball. Here one of the Cal. Tech.
men picked it up and ran it back
forty-three yards before he himself
was thrown. That's one for the book!
