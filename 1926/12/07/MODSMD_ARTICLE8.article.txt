# STANFORD DEBATE TEAM WILL MEET SIX UNIVERSITIES
## Eastern Tour Arranged for H.R. Turkel, Combellack; Science Is Topic 
### 
Six prominent eastern universities
are included in the itinerary of the
Stanford representatives, Fred M.
Combellack and Harry R. Turkel, in
the debating schedule. This is the
first eastern tour that Stanford has
undertaken. Negotiations were begun
early in August under the manage
ment of Theodore F. Baer, and have
continued to date, culminating in the
final selection ai representatives and
the arrangement of the itinerary.
Debate Bates First
The first debate will be held with
Bates College at Lewiston, Maine, on
January 3. Following this, on dates to
be definitely decided later, the follow
ing institutions will me met: Bowdoin
College, Harvard University, Yale Uni
versity, Princeton University, and the
University of Detroit.
The question to be debated is: "Re
solved, That we have more to fear
than to ltope from science." Stanford
will argue both affirmatively and nega
tively.
Big Debating Year
This has been an outstanding year
in debating at Stanford. The meeting
with the team from Sydney, Australia,
aroused much interest on the campus.
The success of the California debate
in San Francisco on the American
Plan in that city added another vic
tory for Stanford. The eastern tour
is the most important series of the
year. A dual debate is planned with
the University of Southern California
to be held in February. The Joffre
debate occurs at Stanford in April,
and a series of non-varsity matches
will be held with various southern
colleges next quarter.
