Resists Corrosion
THIS picture, taken in the salt marshes near
Kearny, N. J., shows two lines of 30-inch Cast
Iron Pipe replacing pipe made of other material.
The alternate exposure to the action of salt water
and air is a severe test.
While the pipe shown in the picture is subjected to
unusual corrosive influences, all underground pipe
must be able to withstand corrosion to a greater or
less degree. Cast Iron Pipe has this quality. It does
not depend on its coating to resist rust; the material
itself is rust-resisting. The first Cast Iron Pipe ever
laid is in service today at Versailles, France, after
two hundred and sixty years' service.
