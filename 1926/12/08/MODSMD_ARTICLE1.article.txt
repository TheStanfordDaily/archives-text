# BAND VOTED TRIP TO ALABAMA GAME BY EX COMMITTEE
## MAY APPEAR IN PARADE Marquette University Will Be Included in Eastern Debate Schedule 
### 
Participation of the Stanford Band
in the Tournament of Roses parade
and the Alabama-Stanford game on
New Year's Day was brought a step
closer to a possibility by the Ex Com
mittee last night when a recommenda
tion was forwarded to the Board of
Athletic Control urging action on the
matter.
The expense of having the band ap
pear at Pasadena will not be exces
sive, the committee believed, as many
of the members of the organization live
•nearby. The body was unanimous in
expressing its willingness to co-oper
ate with the Board~of Athletic Control
in arranging for the band's appear
ance.
Weight Basketball
The weight basketball question, for
tified by a petition carrying 270 names,
again came up before consideration.
The proponents of the measure urged
the Ex Committee to give its approval
to a resumption of a regular schedule
for 130- and 145-pound teams, with the
understanding that the Board of Ath
letic Control would arrange the details
of the matter.
The whole question was finally
dropped by the committee on the
grounds that it was not particularly
within its jurisdiction. The idea was
favored, but it was thought that it
could be well enough arranged with
out action by the Ex Committee. The
committee could see no possibility of
bringing weight basketball under
awards again.
Debate Trip
Theodore Baer appeared before the
t>ody to explain the plans for the
Eastern trip of the Stanford debate
team. Difficulties which have been met
in arranging the schedule were ironed

versity, said to be one of the most
outstanding of the Eastern colleges
interested in debate, in the Stanford

M.S.C. That the following dates bo
granted: January 28, Sequoia Club,
Informal; February 25, Toyon Club,
| Formal.
Participation of the Stanford Band
in the Tournament of Roses parade
and the Alabama-Stanford game on
New Year's Day was brought a step
closer to a possibility by the Ex Com
mittee last night when a recommenda
tion was forwarded to the Board of
Athletic Control urging action on the
matter.
The expense of having the band ap
pear at Pasadena will not be exces
sive, the committee believed, as many
of the members of the organization live
•nearby. The body was unanimous in
expressing its willingness to co-oper
ate with the Board~of Athletic Control
in arranging for the band's appear
ance.
Weight Basketball
The weight basketball question, for
tified by a petition carrying 270 names,
again came up before consideration.
The proponents of the measure urged
the Ex Committee to give its approval
to a resumption of a regular schedule
for 130- and 145-pound teams, with the
understanding that the Board of Ath
letic Control would arrange the details
of the matter.
The whole question was finally
dropped by the committee on the
grounds that it was not particularly
within its jurisdiction. The idea was
favored, but it was thought that it
could be well enough arranged with
out action by the Ex Committee. The
committee could see no possibility of
bringing weight basketball under
awards again.
Debate Trip
Theodore Baer appeared before the
t>ody to explain the plans for the
Eastern trip of the Stanford debate
team. Difficulties which have been met
in arranging the schedule were ironed
out, and a motion was carried author
izing the inclusion of Marquette Uni- j
versity, said to be one of the most
outstanding of the Eastern colleges
interested in debate, in the Stanford
itinerary. Additional expenses were ,
