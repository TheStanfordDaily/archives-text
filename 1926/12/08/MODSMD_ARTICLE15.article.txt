# TONNEAU GAGS HIT STRIDE IN CHAPPIE AUTOMOBILE ISSUE
## 
### 
Wisecracks from the back seat,
jokes on the proverbial campus
Ford, et cetera and ad lib, are
promised for the Automobile
number of Chaparral, which will
appear on the campus the first
of next quarter.
The cover, designed by Bob
Philippi, is declared by the Old
Boy to be the best yet because of
the intricate and elaborate effect
secured.
There is still opportunity to
subscribe for the last six issues
of the year at reduced rate, is
the announcement of the busi
ness department.
