# FRESHMEN WIN FAST HOCKEY GAME 3 TO 2 FROM SOPHOMORES
## 1930 Women Score in First And Fourth Periods to Cinch Victory 
### 
Freshman women outran the sopho
mores to win a 3 to 2 victory in one
of the fastest hockey games of the
season yesterday afternoon. Marianna
Evans, 1930 center forward, scored
two of her team's points, and Marian
Holley made the other. Ruth Mason
made both of the sophomore tallies.
The game started rather raggedly,
both teams playing badly in the first
quarter. Toward the end of the (quar
ter, Miss Mason ran 30 yards for a
score, after helping clear it from
scrimmage. The freshmen showed just
barely enough power to hold back the
1929 line most of the period.
In the second quarter, the freshmen
rallied, Miss Holley carrying the ball
most of the length of the field, and
losing it to Lorraine Reeder, sopho
more goal-guard, only to have Miss
Evans catch it as it came off Miss
Reeder's stick. After this score the
sophomores became more determined,
and toward the end of the half rushed
the freshman goal successfully.
The third quarter was fast and
close, and no goals were made. Fran
ces Shoup, freshman captain, although
playing out of position much of the
time, was distinctly in the sopho
mores' way.
Up to the beginning of the fourth
quarter, the score was still in the
sophomores' favor. In three minutes
from the "time in" whistle, Miss Evans
tied it on a rush for goal. The sopho
mores stiffened their defense again,
but unavailingly. They took the ball,
but as Editha Wright received it and
started down the field, the freshman
backs out in to send it back toward
the sophomore goal. Miss Holley made
another of her long runs, lost the ball,
and then shot it in as it was cleared
by a sophomore back.
