# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA WILL PRESENT THEMES Of POPULAR APPEAL TONIGHT
## Anthony Linden, Soloist, Plays Flute Obbligato To Spirit Dance OVERTURE FIRST NUMBER Short, Tuneful Selections Comprise Program of Concert Group 
### Frank Mittauer 
Although every number on the pro
gram which js to be given by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra to
night at 8:15 in the Basketball Pa
vilion is short and light and tuneful
enough to be appreciated by all who
attend the concert, each is of particu
lar interest and worth.
The first number to be played is
the overture from Mozart's "Marriage
of Figaro." This work, in the charac
teristic style of its composer, sounds
for the first time the themes used in
the opera.
Gluck, who has been called. the
"father of living opera" composed the
second selection, "Dance of the
Blessed Spirits" from "Orpheus." This
ballet, which comes in the opera as
Orpheus sees Erudice among the phan
toms after making his way into the
nether regions, is very pleasing. Flute
obligato to the number will be played
by Anthony Linden, solo flutist with
the orchestra.
Opera Score Criticized
The next number to be played will
be the overture from Ambroise
Thomas' opera, "Mignon." Although
the score of this work has been criti
cized a great deal by a certain ele
ment, it cannot be denied that the
overture incorporates several passages
or charming melody which Insure its
popularity.
Hungarian music is represented on
the program by "Five Waltzes," a com
; position of Brahms. These waltzes are
interesting in their reflection of the
half-Mongolian temperament of the
Hungarian nation.
The ballet music from "Prince Igor,"
the next number, is characteristic of
the straightforward but brilliant stylo
of its Russian composer, Borodin, who
wrote the opera as a recreation from
his scientific studies. Borodin, who
never wrote in the introspective and
pessimistic style of his countrymen,
was criticized for the wild and bar
baric music of the ballet, which typi
fies the spirit with which the Tartar
camp throws itself into the dance.
"Meditation" Popular
"Meditation" from Massanet's opera
"Thais," which follows the selection
from "Prince Igor," is a descriptive
piece depicting the feelings of the
Alexandrian courtesan as she reviews
her life of sin after being touched by
the fervor of the monk who tries to
convert her. The composition has been
popular in America ever since its first
production in 1894.
Two folk-song adaptations for or
chestra by Percy Grainger, the famous
Australian pianist, will conclude 'the
program. These are: "Irish Tune from
County Derry" and "Molly on the
Shore." In each the composer suc
ceeds admirably in catching and set
ting down the spirit of the original.
For Bizet's Suite "L'Arlesienne,"
announced previously as part of the
program, has been substituted a suite
of five parts from "Carmen" by the
same composer. Carmen, Bizet's most
spectacular success, has enjoyed what
is perhaps the greatest popularity of
any opera. Although it has been criti
cized for not being more Spanish in
its Castillian setting, the effects lent
to the various scenes through the use
of distinctly Spanish rhythmic and
orchestral effects make such objec
tions rather puerile.

The first number to be played is
the overture from Mozart's "Marriage
of Figaro." This work, in the charac
teristic style of its composer, sounds
for the first time the themes used in
the opera.
Gluck, who has been called. the
"father of living opera" composed the
second selection, "Dance of the
Blessed Spirits" from "Orpheus." This
ballet, which comes in the opera as
Orpheus sees Erudice among the phan
toms after making his way into the
nether regions, is very pleasing. Flute
obligato to the number will be played
by Anthony Linden, solo flutist with
the orchestra.
Opera Score Criticized
The next number to be played will
be the overture from Ambroise
Thomas' opera, "Mignon." Although
the score of this work has been criti
cized a great deal by a certain ele
ment, it cannot be denied that the
overture incorporates several passages
or charming melody which Insure its
popularity.
Hungarian music is represented on
the program by "Five Waltzes," a com
; position of Brahms. These waltzes are
interesting in their reflection of the
half-Mongolian temperament of the
Hungarian nation.
The ballet music from "Prince Igor,"
the next number, is characteristic of
the straightforward but brilliant stylo
of its Russian composer, Borodin, who
wrote the opera as a recreation from
his scientific studies. Borodin, who
never wrote in the introspective and
pessimistic style of his countrymen,
was criticized for the wild and bar
baric music of the ballet, which typi
fies the spirit with which the Tartar
camp throws itself into the dance.
"Meditation" Popular
"Meditation" from Massanet's opera
"Thais," which follows the selection
from "Prince Igor," is a descriptive
piece depicting the feelings of the
Alexandrian courtesan as she reviews
her life of sin after being touched by
the fervor of the monk who tries to
convert her. The composition has been
popular in America ever since its first
production in 1894.
Two folk-song adaptations for or
chestra by Percy Grainger, the famous
Australian pianist, will conclude 'the
program. These are: "Irish Tune from
County Derry" and "Molly on the
Shore." In each the composer suc
ceeds admirably in catching and set
ting down the spirit of the original.
For Bizet's Suite "L'Arlesienne,"
announced previously as part of the
program, has been substituted a suite
of five parts from "Carmen" by the
same composer. Carmen, Bizet's most
spectacular success, has enjoyed what
is perhaps the greatest popularity of
any opera. Although it has been criti
cized for not being more Spanish in
its Castillian setting, the effects lent
to the various scenes through the use
of distinctly Spanish rhythmic and
orchestral effects make such objec
tions rather puerile.
Although every number on the pro
gram which js to be given by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra to
night at 8:15 in the Basketball Pa
vilion is short and light and tuneful
enough to be appreciated by all who
attend the concert, each is of particu
lar interest and worth.
