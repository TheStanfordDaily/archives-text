# RHYTHM FORMS BASIS OF ALL MUSIC SAYS TUESDAY LECTURER

### 
That there are but two kinds of
! music, good and bad, was the point
1 made by Victor Liechtenstein of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
his "Common Sense Discussion of
; Music" given in the University audi
torium last night.
"All music is composed on the three
; elements of rhythm, melody, and har
mony." "Rhythm," said Lichtenstein,
i "is the basis of music: it leads the
primitive savage to beat his drum for
music. Harmony is combinations of
tones which we find pleasing through
constantly hearing them. Melody is
j the only mysterious element in music.
No one knows why it Is we like a cer
j tain succession of notes."
Using Foster's "Swanee River" as
an example, Lichtenstein showed tho
| Way in which all music, from the sim
plest melodies to the most complex
I symphonies, is built on the same plan.
In addition the speaker explained
: several of the compositions which will
be played tonight at the concert of
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra, illustrating his talk by playing
portions of the numbers on the violin.
Tie was assisted at the piano by Mr.
Solis, a Filipino musician.
In conclusion, Lichtenstein warned
i his audience not to be cowed by the
opinions of critics. He pointed out the
fact that in appreciating music it is
1 necessary to have strong likes and dis
likes, which could never be the same
in all persons.
