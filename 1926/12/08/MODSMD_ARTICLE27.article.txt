The prevalent habit of procrastination seems to have slipped into the
mechanism of the Board of Athletic Control as far as plans for sending
the band to the Alabama-Stanford game are concerned. Here it is,
only a little more than a week until the Christmas holidays, and the
Board has given no hint of its attitude toward the trip.
While those in authority may have the best of intentions about send
ing the musicians to the game, the entire group of over one hundred
is entirely uninformed as to whether plans are to be made. Conse
quently vacation plans for the individual members are extremely vague.
In an effort to speed up a decision and to make the trip possible,
the Executive Committee passed a resolution last night recommending
the trip and urging action on the part of the Board. Whether this move
will bring a reply is left to be seen. Meanwhile the students, and
especially the band members, are waiting for a decision.
