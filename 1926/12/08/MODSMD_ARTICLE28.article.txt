# Weight Basketball
## 
### 
Backed by two hundred and seventy signatures, supporters of a move
ment to revive weight basketball have petitioned the Executive Commit
tee to take some action on the matter. Now the case must be passed
on to the Board of Athletic Control, as the committee has decided it
had no voice in the matter.
Weight basketball furnishes an athletic field for many players who
are usually too light for competition on the varsity squad and it is re
grettable that this activity has had to be dropped. But the leaders of
the new movement that is on foot promise to force the issue in an
endeavor to revive the games.
Students who desire to participate in this sport should be given
the opportunity to do so. What could be more in keeping with Stan
ford's plan of one hundred per cent student participation in athletics?
