SANG FROfD
While the information can hardly be
catalogued as red-hot news, may it be
remarked that finals are practically
upon us.
If there is one feature of this last
week of the quarter that affords us
any genuine entertainment it is the
cool conceit that characterizes the at
titude of the average college student
as he nonchalantly faces an examina
tion on some profound and highly
complex phase of learning. One way
you look at it, there is something
beautiful in the absurd assurance of a
man who expects, for instance, to mas
ter The History of Roman Civiliza
tion in two or three hectic evenings.
BOQUETS AND BRICKBATS
During the past week, the casual

observer has noted that we have been
variously libeled and applauded in the
Campus Opinion column. During the
somewhat heated debate we have
maintained a dignified and aloof atti
tude. This attitude may be explained
partially by the fact that we hardly
knew what to say to, or about, the
rabid commentators, and partially by
a certain curiosity on our part. Ever
conscious of the opportunity for ad
verse criticism of this column, we
rather wondered if our vigorous atti
tude had gained any supporters.
We see now that it has. And we
tender tiuauks to tnose gentlemen who
leaped to our defense. And as for that
fellow who wanted to throttle us, we
hope his belt breaks in public.
