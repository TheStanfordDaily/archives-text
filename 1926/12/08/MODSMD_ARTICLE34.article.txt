WHICH WAY PARNASSUS? by Percy
Marks. (Harcourt, Brace and Com
pany. $2.00).
If this book could be placed in the ;
hands of all trustees, presidents, i
alumni, and undergraduates connected
with the 800-odd colleges in these ;
United States, and if some superna- ,
tural power could prevail upon them j
to read it in an unbiased and recep-j
tive frame of mind —then we might j
expect almost anything in the way of
a fundamental educational revolution. !
Such a reversal of policy is, of course, !
highly improbable when one considers j
the dogmatic attitude of most of such
institutions. It is nevertheless sincere-,
ly hoped that certain of Percy Marks'
views as set forth in "Which Way j,
Parnassus?" may be administered —'
oh, so gently and unobtrusively, as ;
they should be to warrant their adop
tion —to the powers that be. and that
said powers, when they discover them
selves successfully using ideas which
they formerly regarded as dangerous,j
will discover that the joke is on them.
Percy Marks as an author hardly
needs an introduction to anyone who
has read "The Plastic Age." That he
is capable of giving an intelligent in-!
terpretation to present college prob
lems rests wholly and adequately on
his own experiences with colleges: j
he was a student at the University of
California and at Harvard, and a :
teacher at Massachusetts Institute of i
Technology, Brown, and Dartmouth.
In suggesting that, there can be
found a solution to the problems pre
sented in "Which Way Parfnassus?" j
Marks adopts two premises: first, that,
not more than a quarter of the under
graduates in our American universi- j
ties have first-rate minds, and not ;

j more than half of them are capable of
; receiving any real intellectual benefit
: from a college education; second, that
!we should "educate those fit to be
' educated; train those fit to be trained.
; The others must be left to God."
Marks' opinion on various topics
| follows;
"In discussing the alumni, I do not
feel any need for caution; it is im
possible to overstate their follies. They
| are the visible, and, worse yet, audible
I evidence of the results of American
! education. If they could only be taught

to give money when asked and to keep
their mouths firmly shut, the colleges
would make astonishing progress."
Hazing he regards as harmless and
in some ways rather valuable, if it is
restricted to good-natured horseplay.
In regard to the influence colleges can
exert toward improving manners, he
cites the case of Dartmouth and the
change in traditions which took place
there to improve in five years the un
dergraduates' ideals of courtesy and
good-breeding.
Marks favors the honor system but
admits that it doesn't work simply be
cause the United States is a nation
which does not consider honesty a
cardinal virtue. Fraternities, he be
lieves, should be considered in their
true light as social clubs and not
honor organizations. He advocates the
creation in, every college of so many
new fraternities that practically every
man can belong to one if he wants to,
and thereby give to all the opportunity
of enjoying the real pleasures and
profits of a fraternity. —M.C.
