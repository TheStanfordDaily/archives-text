# ”THE MIRACLE" OPENS THREE WEEKS' RUN IN SAN FRANCISCO
## Stage Set Will Transform Civic Auditorium Into Huge Cathedral 
### 
"The Miracle," which will open in
the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco
on Monday night, December 27, for a
three-weeks' run, calls for a colossal
stage set which will transform the
Auditorium into a huge cathedral.
Norman-Bel Geddes has designed the
scenery, construction of which is to
be begun immediately.
The stupendous nature of the Morris
Gest production may be realized from
the dimensions of the stage set. The
stage proper consists of a horseshoe
curved platform, upon which most of
the action takes place. The representa
tion of the cathedral is carried out by
ine presence of twenty huge columns
sixty feet high, six cathedral stained
glass windows, ten and 37 feet in
size, and an altar split in the middle,
so that the procession may enter it.
The wings are 13 by 60 feet, and all
the stage equipment is counterbal
anced and shifted by means of electric
motors which raised the impedimenta
to the grid 116 feet from the stage. A
smoke screen is raised from the front
of the stage to hide the scene changes
from view.
As for the play itself, "The Miracle"
goes back to the very beginnings of
drama, to the old morality plays, about
the production of which there is no
adequate history. These plays were of
the church, treating religious themes
and seeking to promote religious ac
ceptance and practice. There was no
tradition on which to base so great a
spectacle as now contemplated, much
less a precedent such as exists for
nearly every other form of drama. The
work, therefore, is almost a new crea
tion, apart from the legendary story.
There is something about "The Mir
acle" that awes and thrills in the wit
nessing, that exalts the spirit of the
beholder and lingers beneficently.
With the transformation of the
Auditorium into a cathedral, the spec
tators are members of the congrega
tion, there, presumably to attend their
devotions. The nuns, acolytes, peas
ants, beggars, cripples, and other de
votees flow up and down the center
aisle, just as they would enter a church
from the outside. The members of the
audience, therefore, get almost the
feeling of being actors in the play, so
closely are they connected with it.
The more important actors and
actresses in "The Miracle," the per
sons around whom the story is told
and on whom the spectators' eyes are
fixed every moment of the spectacle,
have played in "The Miracle" for three
years, at least the largest number of
them.
"The Miracle" must be seen to be
understood; must be viewed to be
comprehended; must be lived to be
appreciated. If we are to take the
word of the millions who have seen it,
not only the subject of this panto
mimic drama is a miracle, but the pro
duction a sort of work of magic. There
is something about it that creates an
expectant, sympathetic attitude in ad
vance. »
