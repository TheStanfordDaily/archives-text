# STYLE OF GRID ATTIRE HAS CHANGED WITH GAME
## 
### George W. Story 
Football style is changing, not only
in the methods of attack and defense
employed by the teams, but in the
attire adopted by the players.
In the first days of the game the
football hero was so padded that he
was scarcely himself. He wore heavy
shoes, shin pads, large, bulky, canvas
pants loaded down with padding, thick
elbow and shoulder pads, and long
locks to j-.rotect his head in the days
before head-guards.
But this was too bulky, and as the
game changed from one of brute force
to one of speed and alertness, the
equipment of the players also changed.
First the shin pads and nose guards
fell by the wayside. The headgear was
invented and has gradually been made
lighter until it now does not hinder
the wearer at all. The hip, shoulder,
and elbow pads were lessened until
they now protect the player without
handicapping his speed.
And going even further, we find
some of the leading teams in the East
using silk pants. Jimmy Phelan of
Purdue introduced the silk pants, and
it has been adopted by Knute Rockne
of Notre Dame and several other lead
ing coaches. The silk pants, cut the
player's weight three or four pounds
and give him more speed.
The leaders in making these changes
have been Rockne, Phelan, Pat. Page
of Indiana, and Pop Warner, coach of
the Stanford champions.
The trio first named have worked
on lightening the players' equipment,
while Warner has tried his hand at
making it a bit safer. One of his most
recent ideas concerns the headguard.
Pop has had very fine wire placed
across the ear-holes in the head-pieces.
This not only makes the protection of
the ears more complete, but also

I makes it impossible to tackle a man
by grabbing the ear-flap of his head
guard. More than once a runner has
been brought down by a tackier who
grabbed the ear-flap of the headguard.
Warner has also made a couple of
1 very clever practice devices which
; have aided in the development of the
I 1926 Pacific Coast Conference cham
j pions.
One of these is the tackling dummy,
I which he has improved by putting a
circular piece of wood, which resem
-1 bles a life-saver, around the dummy's
waist. In tackling the dummy, the
i players are forced to grab him below
the hips, else they will find their heads
against said piece of wood. This
teaches the boys to tackle low, of
the fundamentals of defensive play.
The second is the "opposing line,"
I which he has built up. This is made
| up of five wooden posts, which are
padded. The five posts form the center
1 of the line and are about six feet high.
There is a beam connecting all five of
these, and it is necessary for the backs
to run low through the line unless
they care to drive their heads against
| the beam.
The ends are about three feet ahead
of the line of scrimmage, and are
I tackling dummies. The interference
takes the dummies out of the plays
j and the linemen block the wooden
; posts just as though they were oppos
ing humans.
And so it goes. Other changes are
certain to come, the aim of which will
be to make the game even faster. The
football player of today no longer
looks like a wrestler or a weight-lifter.
His equipment is very light, and prob
| ably will be made lighter. Changes
which seem impossible now probably
are not as impossible as the wearing
of silk pants seemed to the grid war
riors of old.
