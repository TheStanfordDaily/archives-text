# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is Hoyt ("Wu") Winslett,' the
outstanding football player of the
year, as far as the South is concerned.
If you don't know about this young
man with the Chinese nickname, you
should read the following immedi
ately, for "Wu" is a football player of
parts, and when Alabama plays in the
Tournament of Roses game at Pasa
dena next New Year's Day, the name
of Winslett will in all probability be
very conspicuous in the day's gridiron
doings.
You may have seen Winslett's name
at end on various All-American teams
lately. Competing for one of the two
wing jobs with men like Broda of
Brown, Hanson of Syracuse, Ooster
baan of Michigan, Shipkey of Stan
ford, and various other high-class
ends, is quite a job. But "Wu's" chief
claim to recognition is that he is the
greatest threat of the 1926 "Crimson
Tide," and that is saying a lot when
you consider that there are ball-car
riers like "Red" Barnes, "Red" Brown,
and "Rosey" Caldwell in the backfield.
Winslett, althougn exceedingly effec
tive defensively (not a single first
down has been made around his end
this season), Is, however, even greater
on the offense, for he often carries the
ball, either plunging into the line or
skirting the ends. He is probably the
greatest passer in the South today,

and also a great receiver of passes.
Three of his passes beat Georgia
Tech 21 to 0, and it has been the
same against Vanderbilt, Florida, and
the other Southern teams that the
Crimson "Tide has engulfed this sea
son. "Wu" punts some, too, to make
it unanimous.
Coach Wallace Wade, of Alabama,
does not hesitate in saying that Wins
lett is the most versatile player he has
ever coached, and one of the best, and
ranks him as good as, or even better
than, the famous Lynr Bomar, who all
the world knows \tfas SOME ENDI
