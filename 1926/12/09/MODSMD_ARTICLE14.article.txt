# COLD FIGURES SHOW CARD CAMPUS FAST AVERS DEMON COP
## 
### 
Stanford has a "fast" campus,
especially during the dark hours
of the night, if the cold statistics
of experience are to be trusted,
in the opinion of Nick Ladner,
campus speed cop.
Ladner admits that he never
had on his beat any territory that
could rival the Stanford campus
for general all-around speeding.
He has to stop and converse with
from one to even three or four
law violators per day.
Sometimes a day passes during
which no campus automobile or
hack misbehaves, says Nick, hut
such days are usually rainy or
propitious in some other manner
to the preservation of speed
regulations.
