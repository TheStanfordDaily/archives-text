# STANFORD VARSITY IN FAST DRILL FOR ALABAMA CONTEST
## WARNER DIRECTS PLAY Final Examinations Delay Intensive Training for New Year's Game 
### 
With Pop Warner making his second
appearance at football practice since
his return from the East, the Cardinal
squad went through a fast workout
yesterday afternoon in preparation for
the Pasadena contest.
All the regulars were present yester
day except those who found it impos
sible because of studies. "Tiny" Sell
man, Dick Hyland, and "Spud" Harder
were among those who answered the
roll call, and all have recovered from
their injuries sufficiently to take an
active part in practice. Sellman's
ankle, which was twisted in the Big
Game, is back to normal, and although
Harder's shoulder still needs some
rest, the scrappy end will be in con
dition by the first of next week.
The first part of practice was spent
in running signals, with Post, Hyland,
Bogue, and Hoffman making up the
first team backfield. Forward passes
against the mythical Alabama defense*
completed the drill. No hard work was
attempted as it is Pop's idea to keep
the players in trim until after final I
examinations and then concentrate on
intensive drills for the two weeks
prior to January 1.
Coach Wallace Wade of Alabama's
Crimson Tide is, according to reports
from Tuscaloosa, spending much of
his time working out a defense for
Stanford's powerful attack. The Tide's
offense has functioned well all season,
as has the defense, but Wade believes
that his men must stop the backfield
combination of Bogue, Hyland, and
Hoffman and the Cardinals' forward
passes if they hope to turn in another
victory for the South.
