# Tuneful Ballads and Jazzy Numbers Needed For Junior Opera Score
## 
### 
Do you write melodious music? If
so, your compositions are being sought
by Herbert A. Klein, chairman of the
music committee of the Junior Opera,
for a few tuneful ballads are wanted
to relieve and set off the jazzy selec
tions of the show. Music written to
the new six-eighths tango time is
highly desirable in order that the
opera may boast a modern trend.
Inability to write words to the music
should not discourage composers, ac
cording to the committee, as all ac
ceptable melodies will be turned over
*o lyric writers for the necessary ah's
and oil's. Klein hopes to have a num
ber of contributions in hand by the
first of next quarter.
Books of a "light and sophisticated
nature" are wanted by R. Prank Baker,
chairman of the manuscript commit
tee, and they should center around
either a costume play or a more mod
ern musical show. January 15 has
been set by the committee as the dead
line for synopses and half an act of
dialogue.
