# OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION LOOKS TO STANFORD FOR RUGBY MATERIAL
## Twenty Stanford Athletes Form Nucleus of Squad For Canadian Trip 
### 
The American Olympic Association
will match with interest the perform
ance of the twenty players from the
University of California who will com
pose the rugby team which will in
vade Seattle during the Christmas
holidays for a three-game series with
British Columbia teams. These men
may form a nucleus for the American
rugby team at the 1928 Olympic
Games.
Coach Harry W. Maloney, director
of minor sports, will coach the team,
which will leave San Francisco Decem
ber 21 on the S.S. Ruth Alexander and
return to the campus on January 3.
The first game in the North is sched
uled for Christmas Day with the Van
couver Rowing Club; the second con
test is with the University of British
Columbia team on December 27; while
a tough tussle with a team of All-Stars
from Vancouver will face the Cali
fornians in their final game on New
Year's Day.
Heavy practice, with intermittent
scrimmages, is scheduled for the re
maining days before sailing. As sev
eral graduates with previous experi
ence on Olympic teams, including
Lynn Farish, Charles Doe, Norman
Cleaveland, Dudley DeGroot, and Pat
Carey, have signified their intention
of making the trip, it is expected that
the first team will be composed mainly
of Stanford men.
The Olympic Association may re
cruit from Stanford ranks its entire
1928 American rugby team of fifteen
members, declares Coach Maloney,
who has just returned from the Ameri
can Olympic Association meeting herd
in Washington, D.C. The series in
Canada will furnish an opportunity for
the Olympic officials to observe the
play of the Cardinals,
In only one series in six years of
competition have squads from Cali
fornia been defeated. Prospects are
bright for a continuance of the string
of victories this season, believes
Maloney,
