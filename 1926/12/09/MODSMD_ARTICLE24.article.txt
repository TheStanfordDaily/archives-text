# HUNT TO SELECT TEN FOR SOUTHERN TOUR OF CARD CAGE TEAM
## 
### Fred Speers 
With four games facing the Stan
ford quintet following the final exami
nations of the autumn quarter, Coach
Husky Hunt's candidates start an in
tensive round of training today. No
practice was held last night because
of the concert in the gymnasium.
Ten men will be selected for the
southern tour, to begin on December
23, and the new Cardinal mentor is
endeavoring to determine which will
be the most advantageous combination
to take on the trip with him. The
southern tour, the first game of which
will determine members of the first
squad, will open its active competition
with a game against the Hollywood
Athletic Club on December 27.
To Meet Van Nuys A.C.
On successive nights the Van Nuys
Athletic Club, the Alhambra Athletic
Club, and the Pacific Coast Club of
Long Beach will be met. During the
stay in the South the team will stay
at the Hotel Huntington in Pasadena.
Coach Hunt will hokl a rather in
clusive set of practice sessions during
the examination period as he is yet
far from decided as to who will make
the trip. The recent interclass series
have provided him with some likely
material, and the coach is planning to
give every likely candidate a chance.
Following registration for the win
ter quarter, the initial clash of the
Cardinal squad will be with the Uni
versity of California, Southern Branch,
on January 4.
