Stanford's invitation for the National
; Student Federation of America to hold
its 1927 convention here, extended
I through Stanley Weigel and Charlotte
Lovekin by the Executive Committee,
was rejected in favor of the University
of Nebraska, as the federation felt that
the meeting could not be held so far
. west next year. An invitation was also
I issued by Stanford for the 1928 congress,
which will be acted upon at the Lincoln
meeting.
Weigel and Miss Lovekin, Stanford's
delegates, returned yesterday from the
second annual meeting of the federation
held at Ann Arbor, Michigan, December
j 2 to 4. Weigel was chosen regional rep
resentative for the Far West for the
; coming year and is thus a member of the
j executive committee of the body. Miss
Lovekin served on the amendments com
mittee of the congress while it was in
| session. •
Body Made Permanent
1 he federation ratified the constitution
1 making it a permanent body and moved
j to join the Confederation Internationale
des Etudiants, the international organi
| zation of students with which the associ
| ation is now unofficially connected.
Ihe results of the prohibition poll
j taken throughout the country will not be
j ready until early in the year, as many col
i leges did not submit results in time to be
j tabulated.
Topics Discussed
The six sub-committees discussed the
| honor system, student government, ath
i letics, fraternities, choice and methods of
i teachers, and nature of curriculum. Both
Weigel and Miss Lovekin worked in the
honor system group.
The athletics committee concluded that
football had been overemphasized; that
coaches' salaries should be more nearly
| related to those of professors; that ath
letics for all should be encouraged; that
j post-season games should be discouraged
j if they interfered seriously with studies
