I issued by Stanford for the 1928 congress,
which will be acted upon at the Lincoln

held at Ann Arbor, Michigan, December
j 2 to 4. Weigel was chosen regional rep

1 making it a permanent body and moved
j to join the Confederation Internationale
des Etudiants, the international organi
| zation of students with which the associ
| ation is now unofficially connected.
Ihe results of the prohibition poll
j taken throughout the country will not be
j ready until early in the year, as many col
i leges did not submit results in time to be
j tabulated.
Topics Discussed
The six sub-committees discussed the
| honor system, student government, ath
i letics, fraternities, choice and methods of
i teachers, and nature of curriculum. Both
Weigel and Miss Lovekin worked in the
honor system group.
The athletics committee concluded that
football had been overemphasized; that
coaches' salaries should be more nearly
| related to those of professors; that ath
letics for all should be encouraged; that
j post-season games should be discouraged
j if they interfered seriously with studies
er were promoted by prh'ate commercial
interests, but not otherwise; and that
some means, such as a pledge, should en
courage football players to continue a
full course at the university and not enter
professional football until their class had
graduated.
Fraternities Approved
The fact was accepted that fraternities
could be and generally were a good influ
ence in the college, and it was recom
mended that some form of the Oxford
tutorial system be adopted. Full reports
of all the committees will be available in
the Student Body offices after the first
of the year.
National officers chosen for this year

stitute the executive committee of the
organization. One hundred and sixty
eight colleges are represented in the fed
eration.
"The N.S.F.A. is a big project," said
Weigel, "and is becoming a real force.
It should do much toward promoting
world peace through understanding."
Miss Lovekin also expressed her en
thusiasm for the conference, feeling that
co-operation among the colleges and
among the nations would be forwarded
through such meetings. "The congress
gives each delegate an opportunity better
to understand the problems of the other
colleges in the United States, and through
talks, the problems of the colleges in for
eign countries," she said.

j tabulated.
Topics Discussed
The six sub-committees discussed the
| honor system, student government, ath
i letics, fraternities, choice and methods of
i teachers, and nature of curriculum. Both
Weigel and Miss Lovekin worked in the
honor system group.
The athletics committee concluded that
football had been overemphasized; that
coaches' salaries should be more nearly
| related to those of professors; that ath
letics for all should be encouraged; that
j post-season games should be discouraged
j if they interfered seriously with studies
er were promoted by prh'ate commercial
interests, but not otherwise; and that
some means, such as a pledge, should en
courage football players to continue a
full course at the university and not enter
professional football until their class had
graduated.
Fraternities Approved
The fact was accepted that fraternities
could be and generally were a good influ
ence in the college, and it was recom
mended that some form of the Oxford
tutorial system be adopted. Full reports
of all the committees will be available in
the Student Body offices after the first
of the year.
National officers chosen for this year
are: Fred Berger, University of Cincin
nati, president; Marvin Breckenridge,
Vassar, vice-president; Joe Owens, Uni
versity of Nebraska, treasurer. These
national officers with the regional repre
sentatives and two inembers-at-large con
stitute the executive committee of the
organization. One hundred and sixty
eight colleges are represented in the fed
eration.
"The N.S.F.A. is a big project," said
Weigel, "and is becoming a real force.
It should do much toward promoting
world peace through understanding."
Miss Lovekin also expressed her en
thusiasm for the conference, feeling that
co-operation among the colleges and
among the nations would be forwarded
through such meetings. "The congress
gives each delegate an opportunity better
to understand the problems of the other
colleges in the United States, and through
talks, the problems of the colleges in for
eign countries," she said.
Central Office Named
