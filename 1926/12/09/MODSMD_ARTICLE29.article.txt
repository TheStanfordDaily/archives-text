# And Thus Ended the First Day

And now come final examinations. Several professors were recently
kind enough to lend a little support to the general impression that
examinations were a useless waste of effort. But this is no remedy
to the semi-disastrous period of labor that now confronts the student
body.
As has always been the habit, students have let work pile up until
the last moment. Cramming and more cramming must be done within
the next few days. So, remember your friends are most likely in the
same situation, and leave them alone to their studies.
Of course, you need not worry about bothering those who will wait
for the night immediately prior to the examination before they start
to study. This bunch will also pass their examinations. Their grades
may not be so high, but for the most part they will pass, whether you
bother them or not, thus showing the .fallacy of examinations. While these
queries into one's supposed knowledge of a subject are a bore, never
theless they are a necessity. Students demand grades, and the scholar
ship committee demands gradesâ€”the latter in order to keep up a high
standard of scholarship.
So bear with each other and remember what Dean Yost said to the
Roble girls a day or so agodon't let final examinations worry
you."
