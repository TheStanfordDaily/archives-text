CONFESSION, by Cohmo Hamilton.
Doubleday, Page & Co., 1926. $2.00.
When the plot of "Confession" is
reduced to its barest essentials, there
is little left but the old, old story of
the eternal triangle, always a favorite
with Cosmo Hamilton, especially when
it appears, as it does here, in the form
of a potential rectangle.
It is the treatment of the plot which
makes all the difference between
a good and a mediocre tale, and
the story of "Confession" is not
mediocre. The story is carried in a
series of letters written by a young
American wife to her titled British
husband, so that every event is told
through her Kath's marriage to in
articulate, typically English Jack, who
is so absorbed in bis work of national
reconstruction that he takes it for
granted that Kath knows he loves her,
and therefore neglects to tell her so;
and their subsequent drifting apart
through sheer misunderstanding, a
misunderstanding which arises from
a lack of a common background, of
common traditions, and even of com
mon reminiscences. The Lady Evelyn
Parke, a childhood friend of Jack's
family, seeks to supply this last for
Jack, and Ronny Ormskirk, an ex
army officer with a roving eye, turns
up to amuse Kath when she most
wanted attention. Thus arose the dou
ble triangle.
The most striking thing about "Con
fession" is the fidelity and the poig
nancy with which the author keeps to
the feminine point of view—Kath Is a
very real and a very charming person
as she appears in her own "confes
sion." Her very writing of letters for
no eye but her own to read is just
what a young girl would do in a
similar situation, and this letter form
gives opportunity for the tincture of
realism and the "personal touch" that
is bo often found in modern fiction.
