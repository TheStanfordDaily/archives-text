The Editor, Sir:
The criticism of the "Book of
Charm" which appeared in Monday's
Daily was interesting to me —partly
because the writer's reaction to the
play was in some ways so unlike my
own. Your critic found the satire cruel
and bitter and somehow alien to the
true spirit of comedy. I confess that
the thought never occurred to me,
and that the bubbling humor of the
lines and situations was for me quite
unclouded by any tinge of cruelty. It
is a sad day, to be sure, for the Mr.
and Mrs. Harpers when the Ida Mays
take it into their heads to flit from
the little home town to the great city,
in pursuit of a more "interesting" and
"charming" lite; but tiie experience f=
after all not an uncommon one, nor is
it necessarily fraught with tragic is
sues. And the frantic efforts of Ida
May's doting parents and her devoted
lover are depicted with so much hu
mor and kindly feeling and so much
genuine appreciation of the good and
lovable aspects of a little village com
munity, as well as its amusing limita
tions, that I find it hard to see how
the author can be accused of "bitter
ness or more than the lightest and
most sympathetic touch of satire. Con
trast with this play the weekly page
of drawings in the Chroncle —by Hill,
I think —if you want to see what really
cruel satire is. You will find there a
portrayal of human nature by one who,
however clever a draughtsman he may
be, is an entire stranger to the milk
of human kindness, and resolutely
closes his eyes to all save the mean
and sordid and petty aspects of our
nature.
It is a pleasure to be able to agree
heartily with your critic in the well
merited praise he bestows on the
actors. Here again, however, I would
take one exception to his comment.
The part of Ida May I thought par
ticularly well cast and quite as de
lightfully and sincerely handled in the
amusing proposal scene as it was in
the fetching finale.
It certainly augurs well for the im
; mediate future of the Stanford stage
when the sophomore class can turn
out such a large group of talented and
promising actors and actresses. I
happened to see the play done by pro
fessionals last winter, and the Stan
ford performance was to my thinking
the more enjoyable of the two. The
professionals carried off the very diffi
cult second act with greater precision
and snap—as well they might, since :
, they were in the seventh week of their
Chicago run when I saw them —but the j
Stanford sophomores were, on the
whole, a better cast than the other and
threw themselves into the spirit of
the farce with more spontaneity and
gayety. —B. O. Foster.
The Editor, Sir:
Applications must be in earlier this !
year for Big Game tickets and unless
you get your ticket application the
first day of school you find yourself
sitting behind the goal posts'.
I have tried to rid myself of the idea
that the Board of Athletic Control
was a money-grabbing institution, but j
it now seems impossible to do so.
They promised to send the whole
band to U.S.C. to play at the game.
When it came to going, the band was
cut in half and we, the poor members
of the band, had to buy Five-Dollar
Tickets in order to see the game..
Then the Big Game. The band was

I also promised to go—but in case the
; board decided to change its mind I
! applied for a rooter's ticket. The ro
; suit, the board has still the money for
my ticket, and when I corno to them
for it, they say "it's coming."
Now the members of the band do
not know if they are going to play
at the Alabama game or not. I have
always thought that the reason that
Kate admissions were charged were to
! defray the expenses of athletics —not
to see how big a balance sheet the
Board of Athletic Control can show.
The Stanford Band is one of the big
gest advertisements this institution
has. It has always played when asked
to. The rallies, games, or any other
' defngE or. the campus or off the. Co.ru-
I pus—without a second asking,

I quests are made for money to help the
' school, I shall think that A1 Masters
is a Shylock over a bunch of money
grabbing, hoarding committee men.
—A.M.
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial the other day mention
ing the desirability of having the Stan
ford Band at the Alabama game was
good. The Band, without doubt, is an
| inspiring factor at any game. We all
j want it. However—we have a Bugaboo
Bill here in the person of Chief Buga
boo Masters, who is quite firmly opposed
to the Band when it means money.
Otherwise he sings its praise with the
rest of us. He is imbued with that fine
J commercial spirit on which we should
| justly pride ourselves.
"Why," runs the argument, "should
I we, after making paltry sums out of our
| football games, expend the enormous sum
i of $2000 to take a band south when it
I docs nothing but lend the old Stanford
j Spirit and Fight to the air.
Plainly, they are a cheap, money-grab-
I bing outfit, unwilling to enhance the glory
of Stanford, but quite willing to drag it
| down if it means a few dollars. So they
! treated the band shabbily on the U.S.C.
I proposition; they will leave it at home

The Editor, Sir:
The criticism of the "Book of
Charm" which appeared in Monday's
Daily was interesting to me —partly
because the writer's reaction to the
play was in some ways so unlike my
own. Your critic found the satire cruel
and bitter and somehow alien to the
true spirit of comedy. I confess that
the thought never occurred to me,
and that the bubbling humor of the
lines and situations was for me quite
unclouded by any tinge of cruelty. It
is a sad day, to be sure, for the Mr.
and Mrs. Harpers when the Ida Mays
take it into their heads to flit from
the little home town to the great city,
in pursuit of a more "interesting" and
"charming" lite; but tiie experience f=
after all not an uncommon one, nor is
it necessarily fraught with tragic is
sues. And the frantic efforts of Ida
May's doting parents and her devoted
lover are depicted with so much hu
mor and kindly feeling and so much
genuine appreciation of the good and
lovable aspects of a little village com
munity, as well as its amusing limita
tions, that I find it hard to see how
the author can be accused of "bitter
ness or more than the lightest and
most sympathetic touch of satire. Con
trast with this play the weekly page
of drawings in the Chroncle —by Hill,
I think —if you want to see what really
cruel satire is. You will find there a
portrayal of human nature by one who,
however clever a draughtsman he may
be, is an entire stranger to the milk
of human kindness, and resolutely
closes his eyes to all save the mean
and sordid and petty aspects of our
nature.
It is a pleasure to be able to agree
heartily with your critic in the well
merited praise he bestows on the
actors. Here again, however, I would
take one exception to his comment.
The part of Ida May I thought par
ticularly well cast and quite as de
lightfully and sincerely handled in the
amusing proposal scene as it was in
the fetching finale.
It certainly augurs well for the im
; mediate future of the Stanford stage

Your editorial the other day mention

good. The Band, without doubt, is an

Bill here in the person of Chief Buga
boo Masters, who is quite firmly opposed
to the Band when it means money.
Otherwise he sings its praise with the

"Why," runs the argument, "should

The Editor, Sir:
The criticism of the "Book of
Charm" which appeared in Monday's
Daily was interesting to me —partly
because the writer's reaction to the
play was in some ways so unlike my
own. Your critic found the satire cruel
and bitter and somehow alien to the
true spirit of comedy. I confess that
the thought never occurred to me,
and that the bubbling humor of the
lines and situations was for me quite
unclouded by any tinge of cruelty. It
is a sad day, to be sure, for the Mr.
and Mrs. Harpers when the Ida Mays
take it into their heads to flit from
the little home town to the great city,
in pursuit of a more "interesting" and
"charming" lite; but tiie experience f=
after all not an uncommon one, nor is
it necessarily fraught with tragic is
sues. And the frantic efforts of Ida
May's doting parents and her devoted
lover are depicted with so much hu
mor and kindly feeling and so much
genuine appreciation of the good and
lovable aspects of a little village com
munity, as well as its amusing limita
tions, that I find it hard to see how
the author can be accused of "bitter
ness or more than the lightest and
most sympathetic touch of satire. Con
trast with this play the weekly page
of drawings in the Chroncle —by Hill,
I think —if you want to see what really
cruel satire is. You will find there a
portrayal of human nature by one who,
however clever a draughtsman he may
be, is an entire stranger to the milk
of human kindness, and resolutely
closes his eyes to all save the mean
and sordid and petty aspects of our
nature.
It is a pleasure to be able to agree
heartily with your critic in the well
merited praise he bestows on the
actors. Here again, however, I would
take one exception to his comment.
The part of Ida May I thought par
ticularly well cast and quite as de
lightfully and sincerely handled in the
amusing proposal scene as it was in
the fetching finale.
It certainly augurs well for the im
; mediate future of the Stanford stage
when the sophomore class can turn
out such a large group of talented and
promising actors and actresses. I
happened to see the play done by pro
fessionals last winter, and the Stan
ford performance was to my thinking
the more enjoyable of the two. The
professionals carried off the very diffi
cult second act with greater precision
and snap—as well they might, since :
, they were in the seventh week of their
Chicago run when I saw them —but the j
Stanford sophomores were, on the
whole, a better cast than the other and
threw themselves into the spirit of
the farce with more spontaneity and
gayety. —B. O. Foster.
