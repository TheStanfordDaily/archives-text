# FEET AND FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Big feet are to successful
football players, according to the
coach at the University of Illinois,
who accounts for the lack of success
of several western teams by the po
liteness of their players' feet. The
coach cites the size of Grange's shoe,
an "11-E," as ideal.

Freshman women at U.S.C. have
adopted a "cowgirl" outfit of flannel
skirt, ensign jacket, and vagabond
hat as a class uniform.
