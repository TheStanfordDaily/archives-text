# SPORTS OF 1926

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
It was generally understood —or at |
least it was when I was a kid —that
the name Clarence designated a young
ster who was either lacking in cour
age or athletic ability, and was a sort
of "mollycoddle" or "sissy." The Per- j
cies, the Cyrils, and the Geralds also
belonged to this class. This under
standing, if it wasn't completely shot
to pieces during the Great War, re
ceived a final blow during the last
three years, when the "Clarences"
more than came into their own.
Right now there are two Clarences j
who, disguised under the nicknames
of "Fat" and "Nibs," are guiding the
destinies of the football teams at two
major universities. Dr. Clarence
"Fat" Spears, gridiron mentor at the
University of Minnesota, replaced Bill
Spaulding as coach of the Gophers a
little over a year ago. "Fat" went
there with a fine reputation made in
two years at West Virginia, and in his
first year in the north lost only to
Notre Dame and Michigan, held Wis
consin to a tie, and defeated lowa
33 to 0. This year, "Fat's" team has
been beaten by Rockne's and Yost's
men again, but that, as all the world
knows, is nothing to be ashamed of.

Spears was All-American guard while
at Dartmouth in 1915.
Clarence "Nibs" Price, a former
baseball star at the University of Cali
fornia, is undertaking the difficult task
of filling the shoes of the late Andy
Smith, whose teams were undefeated
in five years. "Nib's" charges have
lost most of their games this year, but
players like "Brick" Muller, "Pesky"
Sprott, "Cort" Majors, "Stew" Beam,
and other stars whom Nibs coached
at San Diego High School and sent on
to California to bring glory to Andy
Smith, are few and far between. Price
happens to be at the helm during the
"lean football years" that come every
so often to all colleges.
Other Clarences of note are Clar
ence De Mar, who has won three big
marathon races this year; Clarence
Houser, world's champion discus
thrower and famous throughout the
world for his deeds with the weights;
Clarence Pinkston, former Olympic
diving champion; Clarence "Peck"
Griffin, coast tennis star; Clarence
Mitchell, southpaw spit-ball pitcher of
the Phillies; Clarence Galloway, Ath
letic short stop; and Clarence ("Hei
nie") Mueller, Giant outfielder.
