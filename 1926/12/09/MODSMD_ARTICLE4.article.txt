# SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY GIVES COLORFUL PROGRAM
## 
### Herb Klein 
Judging from the reception accorded
Alfred Hertz and the San Francisco
Symphony, the recital last night repre
sented the audience's idea of what an
orchestra concert should be. It would
have been difficult to select a program
combining more colorful numbers,
more familiar melody, or more con
trast. In spite of the absence cf any
thing which might be classed as
classical or heavy, the selections were
anything but trivial, and under the
spirited and yet wholly sympathetic
direction of Alfred Hertz, the rendi
tion of every selection was practically
flawless.
Acoustics Excellent
Before the recital began Dr. Hertz
was uncertain as to the manner in
which the music would sound in the
Pavilion, never before used for a con
cert of this magnitude. liut from the
overture, "The Marriage of Figaro,"
which opened the recital, to Grainger's
"Molly on the Shore" at the end, every
tone was heard undistorted and free
from disturbing echoes —which could
never be said of the former Assembly
Hall recitals. Hertz expressed himself

as more than pleased by the accom
modations and the receptive audience.
The first two numbers, the Mozart
overture and "Dance of the Blessed
Spirits" from "Orpheus," represented
the best in classical tradition. For
formal beauty and unaffected sim
plicity, the selection from "Orpheus"
has scarcely an equal. Anthony Lin
den, snJo flutist, rendered the obblirnM
smoothly and with a limpid tone that
perfectly fitted the melody.
Carmen Suite
Color, rhythm, explosive violence,
and a wealth of familiar melody made
the ever-popular "Carmen" suite all
that it usually is and more. Whether
because of the position of the orches
tra in the Pavilion, or because of spe
cial verve on the part of the players,
the climaxes were tremendously effec
tive. The cymbal player should be
congratulated on his never-failing
ability to make a crash that seems to
bring the house down.
Although it approaches sentimental
ity in parts, the overture to "Mignon"
has so much of freshness and life and
contains such a provocative dance that
its absence on a truly "popular" con
cert program would be a great loss.
Orchestrated by Dr. Hertz himself,
the "Five Waltzes," by Brahms,
opened the second section o£ the pro
gram. Although the same easy flow of
melody was to be noted, as in the
original piano arrangement, the char
acteristic phrasing and waltz rhythm
was less definitely marked due to the
change of musical vehicles.
Barbaric Vigor
Borodin's "Ballet Music" from
"Prince Igor" was the ultimate in bar
baric vigor and force. Yet in parts,
particularly the opening section repre
senting the the Young Maid
ens," the mood was almost yearningly
lyrical. Following came a lively theme
for the "Dance of the Boys," and then
the tremendous and ear-splitting
"Dance of the Warriors," a really
colossal assault upon the organ of
hearing. A return of the other two
dances followed and a crashing climax
closed, leaving the desire to see the
ballet that could adequately portray
the fire and passion of the music.
"Meditation" from "Thais" proved
so popular as played by Concertmaster
Mishel Piastro, that it was repeated
after a prolonged and insistent storm
of applaus. Piastro played the piece in
such a way that it did not seem as
saccharine as it often does in the
hands of less capable musicians.
Two Grainger numbers in the usual
style of that composer, but contrasting
decidedly with each other, closed. The
wistfulness of "Tune from County
Derry" is familiar to most in the song,
"Would God I Were the Tender Apple
Blossom." "Molly on the Shore" pro
vided the musical comic relief for the
evening.
