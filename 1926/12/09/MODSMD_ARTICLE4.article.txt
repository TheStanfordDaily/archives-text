# SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY GIVES COLORFUL PROGRAM
## 
### Herb Klein 
Judging from the reception accorded
Alfred Hertz and the San Francisco
Symphony, the recital last night repre
sented the audience's idea of what an
orchestra concert should be. It would
have been difficult to select a program
combining more colorful numbers,
more familiar melody, or more con
trast. In spite of the absence cf any
thing which might be classed as
classical or heavy, the selections were
anything but trivial, and under the
spirited and yet wholly sympathetic
direction of Alfred Hertz, the rendi
tion of every selection was practically
flawless.
Acoustics Excellent
Before the recital began Dr. Hertz
was uncertain as to the manner in
which the music would sound in the
Pavilion, never before used for a con
cert of this magnitude. liut from the
overture, "The Marriage of Figaro,"
which opened the recital, to Grainger's
"Molly on the Shore" at the end, every
tone was heard undistorted and free
from disturbing echoes —which could
never be said of the former Assembly
Hall recitals. Hertz expressed himself

as more than pleased by the accom
modations and the receptive audience.
The first two numbers, the Mozart
overture and "Dance of the Blessed
Spirits" from "Orpheus," represented
the best in classical tradition. For
formal beauty and unaffected sim
plicity, the selection from "Orpheus"
has scarcely an equal. Anthony Lin
den, snJo flutist, rendered the obblirnM
smoothly and with a limpid tone that
perfectly fitted the melody.
Carmen Suite
Color, rhythm, explosive violence,
and a wealth of familiar melody made
the ever-popular "Carmen" suite all
that it usually is and more. Whether
because of the position of the orches
tra in the Pavilion, or because of spe
cial verve on the part of the players,
the climaxes were tremendously effec
tive. The cymbal player should be
congratulated on his never-failing
ability to make a crash that seems to
bring the house down.
Although it approaches sentimental
ity in parts, the overture to "Mignon"
has so much of freshness and life and
contains such a provocative dance that
