"Editors of college newspapers have
a great deal of influence today," believes
Harold deWolf Fuller, professor of
journalism at New York University.
"The editor of an undergraduate paper
is a leader of student thought, and is
able to help mold college traditions."
"I would suggest," said Professor
Fuller," that clear thinking is the first
prime requisite of a college editor. Con
tacts with fellow students is perhaps
the next important thing to be con
sidered. The college editor must mix
with the students of his college and de
velop his contacts to the uttermost de
gree.
"The fruits of this clear thinking and
mingling with the collegc world will be
great personal influence, expressed
through purposeful editorials, which
have been called the "sonnets" of
Journalism. The successful short edi
torial should start with a striking
thought, play with the various phases
of it, gather them together and close
with a snap."
