## 
### 
BERKELEY, Dec. 7. â€”Nearly four
years after his graduation in May 1923,
Gerritt Henry, a member of the Cali
fornia varsity track team during his
undergraduate days, was Wednesday
night awarded a Big "C" by the Execu
tive Committee of the Associated Stu
dents.
Henry, as a junior, competed against
Stanford in the Big Meet of 1922 and
placed third in the high hurdles. Argu
ment among the judges at the time
prevented him from receiving the
coveted award to which he was en
titled. The award was made upon the
recommendation of the Student Ath
letic Council who investigated Henry's
claims to the honor.
