## 
### 
"Modern college students are like
automobiles â€”each year they are get
ting better and better."
This is the answer that Dr. Frede
rick Woellner, associate professor of
education at the University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch, makes to
those who criticize them.
"Persons who get their only ideas
from the six best sellers, the scandal
sheets and the movies are under the
impression that the country in general
and the young people in particular are
going to the dogs. They lose sight of
the fact that we are moving forward,"
Dr. Woellner declared.
"Illiteracy is getting to be almost
unknown," he pointed out, "and col
lege people are intelligent if not intel
lectual.
"Intelligence." he said, "harnesses
the power of the mind to the purpose
of accomplishment."
