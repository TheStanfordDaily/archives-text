# GRID MEN EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN 1930 BASKETBALL SQUAD
## Football Stars Make Strong Bid for Positions on Freshman Team 
### 
Several star members of this year's
freshman football team are expected
to join Coach Howard Mitchell's bas
ketball squad at the beginning of next
quarter, and it will be these players
who will bolster up the weaknesses
on the yearling quintet. Mitchell has
held practices but three times a week
so far this quarter, but next January
lie will put the .1930 hoop aspirants
through a regular session every night.
Clarence Hush, regular freshman
end, is perhaps the most outstanding
candidate for the running guard posi
tion. Hush will join the squad next
quarter, and when he starts playing he
is expected to cinch a regular place
on the first five. Kay Albertson, an
other Babe end, is a strong candidate
for standing guard, as is Bill Simkins,
freshman grid captain. Steinback, an
other yearling flankman, is rated as
a prospective first-string center.
Harry Berg, flashy former Stockton
High forward, is sure to bo the main
stay in the freshman five's offensive,
fierg is fast, a clever dribbler, and an
accurate shot, and is expected to tally
heavily for the 1930 quintet this sea
son. Nye, a former Alhambra High
star, looks good in early-season play,
and should work in very well at either
running guard or center. Dietrich, an
other former Stockton High player, is
a strong candidate for a regular posi
tion at standing guard. Fislibeck and
Long, both San Francisco boys, are
playing good basketball, and should
make a good bid for places at center
and standing guard, respectively.
Moore at forward, Garibotti at center
with Low at forward and Thompson
at standing guard, are other players
who will probably work in on the
first squad.
The freshman quintet's play has
shown steady improvement through
out the interclass series, and in the
game yesterday afternoon against the
seniors, they were decidedly better in
passing, dribbling, and goal-shooting.
The yearlings demonstrated a fast
offensive, and with Berg as the center
of play, turned in their best perform
ance of the series.
