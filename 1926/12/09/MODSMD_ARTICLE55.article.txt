# Sets of Brothers Compose Midland Football Eleven
## 
### 
Four sets of brothers, helped out at
left halfback, left guard, and fullback,
composed the Midland College football
team this year. Three of the pairs
were first-string men and the others
substitutes. One pair furnished the
regular center-quarterback combina
tion while two others played side by
side in the line.
