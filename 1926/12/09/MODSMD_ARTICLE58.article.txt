# Coaches Withstand More Criticism Than Professors
## 
### 
That college professors could not
withstand the close scrutiny and the
critcism that is given major football
coaches and still hold their jobs is the
opinion of Dr. Lee Galloway, president
of the Alumni Federation of New York
University. He further states that no
teacher would want to stand the same
tests that are given to nationally
known coaches.
