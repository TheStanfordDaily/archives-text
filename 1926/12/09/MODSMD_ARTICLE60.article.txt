# RADIO HALLUCINATION IS NEW MENTAL DISEASE PATIENTS BELIEVE THEY HEAR RADIO WAVES HUMAN AILMENTS FOLLOW IN STEPS OF SCIENCE

### 
"Radio hallucination," a new disease
of the mind in which the affected per
son believes himself to be able to hear
radio waves, is the latest malady
which has made its appearance.
Dr. E. G. Weaver, of the psychology
department of the University of Cali
fornia, in discussing such a case, said:
"There is a man in a psycopathic hos
pital—who. by the way, is deaf —suf-
fering from this disease. Though he is
unable to hear ordinary sounds, he is
under the illusion that 'radio voices'
are threatening him with death. An
odd phase of the case is that the pa
tient is calmly resigned to what he
considers an inevitable fate."
Ailments Follow Science
It is the opinion of psychologists
that it is natural for human ailments
to follow in the steps of science. In
the past century, when scientists were
much interested in the so-called "vi
bration theory," many people believed
that they were sensitive to the mys
terious vibrations from other worlds
and could transmit messages from
these realms.
When "magnetism" was the center
of scientific investigation, magnetism

I of some sort was attributed to human
beings, and certain people declared
j themselves able to infect others with
this mysterious power.
Again, .the invention of telegraphy
; gave impulse to the idea that com
munication between minds was pos
; sible. Mental telegraphy was a famil
i iar term in the vocabularies of those
interested in spiritualism. The term
"telegraphy" used in this connection
was finally corrupted into "telepathy,"
! the former term no longer being used
in such sense.
