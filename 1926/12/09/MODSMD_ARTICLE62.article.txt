# FRATERNITY SYSTEM HERE RATES HIGH IN EAST, SAYS DOERR
## 
### 
That Stanford holds a high place
among the universities of the country
and that the east is interested in
studying its student organizations, are
the opinions expressed by Karl Doerr,
upon his return from the National
Interfraternity Convention, held in
Chicago on November 20 and 27. l
Doerr, the Stanford delegate, was '
elected secretary of the national or
ganization and chosen as one of the;
four on the executive committee.
Fifty colleges and universities were 1
represented at the meeting held in the
Hotel Pennsylvania. Stanford was the i
only institution from the Far West to j
send a delegate.
Interest in Stanford
Men from the East were. an XiGuci to ;
learn the details of the Western
school's student life and activities, j
said Doerr. This fact, coupled with the !
prominence gained by being the only
Pacific Coast college represented, gave i
Stanford a great deal of favorable pub-!
llcity.
Rushing, co-operative buying, and
the educating of freshmen in the mat-1
ter of fraternities were the three big
points discussed by the convention. I
Deferred rushing, as practiced at
Stanford, is being used in seventeen
schools. Of these, only two or three j
report success. Sentiment expressed |
at the moeting, however, pointed to i
the growth of the system, said Doerr.
Although the University of Pennsyl- |
vania uses it successfully, it was de
cided that deferred rushing would be
most practical in colleges of less than
4000 enrollment. Stanford is one of
the pioneers in this system.
Co-operative Buying
The plan of co-operative buying is
functioning in various forms in sev
eral schools. Many of the Eastern
fraternities combine in buying their
fuel supply each year.
A system of giving first-year men a
clearer idea of fraternities was dis- 1
cussed at the Chicago meeting. The
plan would be carried out by means of }
a chart which would rate the various 1
houses, giving their status on the local
campus.
One plan to increase high scholar
ship among fraternity. men was con
sidered whereby the interfraternity â– 
council would demand an explanation

for each man's delinquency from his i
house.
The convention was divided into
two groups, senior and undergraduate.
Three meetings were held, Friday
morning and afternoon, and Saturday
afternoon.
Richard Jones, of the University of
Illinois, was elected undergraduate
chairman of the convention.
