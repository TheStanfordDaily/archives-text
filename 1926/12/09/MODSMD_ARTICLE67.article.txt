# JUNIORS BATTLE FOR HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
Whether the junior women will he
hockey champions or tied with the sen
iors for the title will be decided when
the two teams play this afternoon.
If the juniors win, they will be un
disputed champions. If the seniors suc
ceed in downing their opponents, the
two teams will be tied for the title
with two victories and one defeat each.
In that case, the tie will probably not
be played off.
