# Heavy Rains Temporarily Damage O.A.C. Heating Plant
## 
### 
Rainfall at Corvallis was so
recently that the heating plant of the
Oregon State College was put out of
commission.
An unusual storm caused the sewer
mains to overflow and back into the
heating mains of the plant, with the
result that seven feet of water flooded
the pit where the boiler pumps are
located.
Engineers were unable to start the
fires for many hours. In the interim
the classrooms went unheated.
