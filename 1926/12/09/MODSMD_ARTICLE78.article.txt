# Pennies Fill Strategic Use Roble Tradition Flourishes Hopes Climb as Coins Drop

Two hundred and eleven pennies
stand guard in Roble Hall.
Theirs is a thankless task: day in
and day out they must perch precari
ously on top of the bells in 211 rooms,
waiting for a jingle to send them
tumbling off â€”a warning to the fair
inmate that she has had a call during
her absence.
What matter if this custom costs
Roble all of $2.11? Is it not worth far
more to be told that while one has
been struggling with amoeba in the
lab, perhaps HE has called? Truly,
pennies have at last found their
"raison d'etre."
