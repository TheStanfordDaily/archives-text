# STANFORD FIVE RETURNS FROM SOUTHERN TOUR
## Poor Showing No Criterion For Estimating Future Cardinal Power PLAY BRANCH TOMORROW Anderson Back at Standing Guard—Football Men to Join Cage Squad 
### 
Stanford's basketball varsity returns
today from a somewhat disastrous
southern tour, having dropped three
of four games, two of these by one
point margins. The team will meet the
University of California, Southern
BrSnch, tomorrow night in the pavi
lion.
Though Coach Husky Hunt's varsity
seems ragged in these early-season
games, Stanford supporters are not
viewing the season's prospects with
alarm because the team is possessed
of potential strength.
Four Games Played
In Los Angeles four games were
played, one with the Hollywood Ath
letic Club, which Stanford dropped by
a four-point margin. Stanford's victory
came at the expense of the Van Nuys
Athletic Club on January 28. The
Alhambra Athletic Club and the Pa
cific Coast Club of Long Beach both
■won their games from the Cardinals
by the narrowest of margins.
To date the Cardinal team seems
stronger on the defense than in at
tack, lacking dependable scoring abil
ity. Coach Hunt, during the training
season preceding the Christmas holi
days, stressed particularly the defen
sive work, a department in which the
Cardinals have been consistently
faulty for several seasons.
The new Cardinal mentor's object
now will be to brush up on offensive
work before the season gets fully
under way. The only scorer of con
sistent ability on the regular five is
Captain Nelson David. David, how
ever, thus far has shown himself to
be erratic and therein has lain one
of the weaknesses of the Cardinal at
tack.
The presence of Ned Anderson at
standing guard gave the Cardinal
stock a boost. Biaggini had been regu
larly holding the berth before Ander
son came to the front following early
season practice. Biaggini lacks the
height and natural build for the posi
tion but furnishes a powerful and
skilled alternate. He is too good to be
classed as a substitute.
The post-season football game with
Alabama has kept several regulars on
the basketball squad from appearing
in court togs. Shipkey and Price, both
cage lettermen, will now return to the
basketball team. In view of this the
showing of the Cardinals in their
early-season games does not have as
strong a bearing in calculations of
later strength as would ordinarily be
the case.
It is highly improbable that Hunt
will use the material turned over to
him from the football squad in the
clash against the Branch tomorrow
night. It will be another fortnight be
fore Cardinal fans will be able to rea
sonably estimate the true strength of
the quintet.
