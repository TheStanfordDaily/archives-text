# STANFORD FIVE RETURNS FROM SOUTHERN TOUR

Stanford's basketball varsity returns
today from a somewhat disastrous
southern tour, having dropped three
of four games, two of these by one
point margins. The team will meet the
University of California, Southern
BrSnch, tomorrow night in the pavi
lion.
Though Coach Husky Hunt's varsity
seems ragged in these early-season
games, Stanford supporters are not
viewing the season's prospects with
alarm because the team is possessed
of potential strength.
Four Games Played
In Los Angeles four games were
played, one with the Hollywood Ath
letic Club, which Stanford dropped by
a four-point margin. Stanford's victory
came at the expense of the Van Nuys
Athletic Club on January 28. The
Alhambra Athletic Club and the Pa
cific Coast Club of Long Beach both
■won their games from the Cardinals
by the narrowest of margins.
To date the Cardinal team seems
stronger on the defense than in at
tack, lacking dependable scoring abil
ity. Coach Hunt, during the training
season preceding the Christmas holi
days, stressed particularly the defen
sive work, a department in which the
Cardinals have been consistently
faulty for several seasons.
The new Cardinal mentor's object
now will be to brush up on offensive
work before the season gets fully
under way. The only scorer of con
sistent ability on the regular five is
Captain Nelson David. David, how
ever, thus far has shown himself to
be erratic and therein has lain one
of the weaknesses of the Cardinal at
tack.
