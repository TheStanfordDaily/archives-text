# WILBUR ADVOCATES NON-INTERFERENCE IN CHINA'S AFFAIRS
## President Returns After Three Months' Tour Of Orient 
### 
Non-interference is the policy to
ward China which President Wilbur
advocates that outside nations main
tain, according to a survey of the situ
ation in China which he made upon
his arrival on the campus last week,
following a three months' tour of
Oriental countries.
China has the ability and intellec
tual capacity to work her . own way
through the political, economic, and
social upheaval that is besetting her
now, he says, and all she needs is
opportunity without interference.

President Wilbur gathered these
convictions after studying carefully
lhe Oriental situation and meeting all
the chief scholars, statesmen, and sol
diers of China and Japan. His position
as head of the Institute of Pacific Re
lations and as delegate to the Pan-
Pacific Science Congress, whose ses
sions he attended in Tokyo, October
30 to November 11, brought him into
contact with all the leaders of Oriental
life. The itinerary of Dr. Wilbur's trip,
which marked his longest absence
from the campus during his adminis
tration, brought him from Tokyo
through Manchuria to Pekin and Tien
tsin, and in all centers he was highly
received, as well by Stanford alumni
in China and Japan as by the native
scholars.
In regard to the esteem in which
Stanford is held in the Orient, Dr.
Wilbur said:
"It to a Stanford man
to perceive the genuine high regard in
which the University is held through
out the Orient. It would surprise a
good many who have not realized it
to learn the high reputation and re
spect which Stanford has won among
educated people in China and Japan."
Explains Problems
Continuing on the subject of China,
Dr. Wilbur declared that that country
is forced to face three trying things
at one time. First, she is changing her
form of government; second, she is
trying to adapt herself to the require
ments that have been forced by
science on modern civilization on all
sides; third, she has to cope with the
interference of the foreigner and his
established privileges. This would fur
nish a trying problem for any nation.
"China," he said, "is now going
through a civil war, with the national
istic South grouped against the sec-
Lionalistic North. The paralyzing ef
fects of civil war in China on many
activities, including business, is no
more irritating to us than conditions
were to the British investors during
our Civil War.
Japan Ahead of China
"Japan is a full generation ahead of
China in adapting itself to modern
methods and necessities arising from
the force of modern science on life,"
Dr. Wilbur declared. But the Chinese
are working out a solution to their
problem by modernizing their educa
tion and applying their inherent abil
ity and intellect to meet new problems.

form of government; second, she is
trying to adapt herself to the require
ments that have been forced by
science on modern civilization on all
sides; third, she has to cope with the
interference of the foreigner and his
established privileges. This would fur
nish a trying problem for any nation.
"China," he said, "is now going
through a civil war, with the national
istic South grouped against the sec-
Lionalistic North. The paralyzing ef
fects of civil war in China on many
activities, including business, is no
more irritating to us than conditions
were to the British investors during
our Civil War.
Japan Ahead of China
"Japan is a full generation ahead of
China in adapting itself to modern
methods and necessities arising from
the force of modern science on life,"
Dr. Wilbur declared. But the Chinese
are working out a solution to their
problem by modernizing their educa
tion and applying their inherent abil
ity and intellect to meet new problems.
Non-interference is the policy to
ward China which President Wilbur
advocates that outside nations main
tain, according to a survey of the situ
ation in China which he made upon
his arrival on the campus last week,
following a three months' tour of
Oriental countries.
China has the ability and intellec
tual capacity to work her . own way
through the political, economic, and
social upheaval that is besetting her
now, he says, and all she needs is
opportunity without interference.
Trip His Longest
President Wilbur gathered these
convictions after studying carefully
lhe Oriental situation and meeting all
the chief scholars, statesmen, and sol
diers of China and Japan. His position
as head of the Institute of Pacific Re
lations and as delegate to the Pan-
Pacific Science Congress, whose ses
sions he attended in Tokyo, October
30 to November 11, brought him into
contact with all the leaders of Oriental
life. The itinerary of Dr. Wilbur's trip,
which marked his longest absence
from the campus during his adminis
tration, brought him from Tokyo
through Manchuria to Pekin and Tien
tsin, and in all centers he was highly
received, as well by Stanford alumni
in China and Japan as by the native
scholars.
In regard to the esteem in which
Stanford is held in the Orient, Dr.
Wilbur said:
"It to a Stanford man
to perceive the genuine high regard in
which the University is held through
out the Orient. It would surprise a
good many who have not realized it
to learn the high reputation and re
spect which Stanford has won among
educated people in China and Japan."
Explains Problems
Continuing on the subject of China,
Dr. Wilbur declared that that country
is forced to face three trying things
at one time. First, she is changing her
form of government; second, she is
trying to adapt herself to the require
ments that have been forced by
science on modern civilization on all
sides; third, she has to cope with the
interference of the foreigner and his
established privileges. This would fur
nish a trying problem for any nation.
