# CARD-ALABAMA FOOTBALL TIE LEAVES NATIONAL TITLE OPEN
## Southern Team's Fight Checks Onrush of Westerners STANFORD IS SUPERIOR Break Deprives Redshirts of Victory in Last Few Minutes 
### 
Two undefeated elevens represent
ing two sections of the country met
on the field of battle in the Rose Bowl
at Pasadena on New Year's Day to
settle the mythical Nattnra!* Sham
pionship. The resulting 7-7 tie leaves
the honor still a myth.
Powerful line plunges and a desper
ate fighting spirit saved the Alabama
team from a defeat by what appeared
to be a superior eleven when a break
gave them possession of the ball on
the 14-yard line five minutes before
the final gun. For up to that time the
game was decidedly Stanford's. A kick
by Wilton in the fourth quarter was
blocked by Alabama. Although Wilton
raced down the field and recovered on
the 14-yard line, the ball went to the
opposition on downs. Johnson, a sub
stitute, went in for Alabama and in five
plays succeeded in plunging over the
line for the tally. With the game at
stake, the kick for extra point was
successful.
Cards Score Easily
Stanford's score was easily made
late in the first quarter, by a spec
tacular passing attack. The first play
was a surprise pass by "Biff" Hoffman
to "Tricky Dicky" Hyland, who caught
the ball on the dead run and was
downed on the Alabama 30-yard line.
In seven plays Stanford carried the
ball to the Alabama 11-yard line. There
Bogue tried a place kick, when the
Alabama defense stiffened, but missed
his attempt.
It was not until late in the first
