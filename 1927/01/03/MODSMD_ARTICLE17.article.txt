# CARD-ALABAMA FOOTBALL TIE LEAVES NATIONAL TITLE OPEN
## Southern Team's Fight Checks Onrush of Westerners STANFORD IS SUPERIOR Break Deprives Redshirts of Victory in Last Few Minutes 
### 
Two undefeated elevens represent
ing two sections of the country met
on the field of battle in the Rose Bowl
at Pasadena on New Year's Day to
settle the mythical Nattnra!* Sham
pionship. The resulting 7-7 tie leaves
the honor still a myth.
Powerful line plunges and a desper
ate fighting spirit saved the Alabama
team from a defeat by what appeared
to be a superior eleven when a break
gave them possession of the ball on
the 14-yard line five minutes before
the final gun. For up to that time the
game was decidedly Stanford's. A kick
by Wilton in the fourth quarter was
blocked by Alabama. Although Wilton
raced down the field and recovered on
the 14-yard line, the ball went to the
opposition on downs. Johnson, a sub
stitute, went in for Alabama and in five
plays succeeded in plunging over the
line for the tally. With the game at
stake, the kick for extra point was
successful.
Cards Score Easily
Stanford's score was easily made
late in the first quarter, by a spec
tacular passing attack. The first play
was a surprise pass by "Biff" Hoffman
to "Tricky Dicky" Hyland, who caught
the ball on the dead run and was
downed on the Alabama 30-yard line.
In seven plays Stanford carried the
ball to the Alabama 11-yard line. There
Bogue tried a place kick, when the
Alabama defense stiffened, but missed
his attempt.
It was not until late in the first
period that Stanford put over its
touchdown. Straight rushing football
carried the ball up the field to within
scoring distance, when Alabama ex
pected Hyland to pass to Shipkey, as
Bad been Stanford's custom, the Card's
shifted the deal and Bogue passed to
Walker, who ran over the goal line
around Alabama's right end practically
unopposed. Bogue's goal kick added
the extra point.
Stanford Superior
In scrimmage play, the Stanford
line showed its power against the
heavy Southerners, and the actual
yardage gained was far greater than
Alabama's. It was evident that Coach
Wade had trained his men on defense
of the famous Stanford reverses, for
they failed to not the customary yard
age. Bogue's off-tackle plunges, Hoff
man's powerful bucks and passes were
consistent ground-gainers for the Car
dinal. Ted Shipkey did some surpris
ing open-field running, carrying the
ball like a back.
Ilyland was a marked man.
Once or twice he gave the spec
tators a thrill, but the repeated tackles
of the entire Alabama team showed its
effect and he was taken from the game
at the beginning of the second half.
The defense was nearly perfect. Swan
did notable work against the heavy
Southern line, as did Harris and the
other man on the line. Bogue was a
tower of strength in all departments
of the game. He smeared plays, re
• ceived and threw passes, and time
and again made gains through the
line.
Ends All Star
No finer end play has ever been
seen anywhere than that put up by
Shipkey and Walker for Stanford, and
Hoyt Winslett and Ben Enis of Ala
bama. They were all over the place
and they dived into the interference
with a recklessness that was amazing.
Stanford showed far more on of
fense than Alabama and the game is
a story of missed opportunities. Twice
Bogue failed to make a field goal, one
failure undoubtedly due to the glaring
sun which was against Stanford in
the first quarter. In the fourth quarter
Stanford had a great chance to cinch
the victory after Shipkey had recov
ered Taylor's fumble, but as before
related Bogue failed by two inches of
making his yardage so that Stanford
could 4iold the ball and have four more
trjes to make the six yards that sepa
rated them from a touchdown.
Game Lacks Spirit
The game lacked the spirit of a true
Intercollegiate game, and fully three
fifths of the spectators were pro-Ala
bama, probably because of the under
dog psychology. In his earnestness,
the referee furnished the crowd with
some laughs when he dived into the
pile while it was forming in order to
get the correct position of the ball. He
also did some hair-splitting measuring.
The game moved slowly and were
it not for the brilliant passing attack
used by Stanford, would have proved
mo«t uninteresting.
The Stanford team appeared re
splendent in new silk pants. Before
the game the band did its usual stunt,
honoring the visitors by a rendition of
"Dixie." The Pasadena Elks' band
played for Alabama. The rooters
showed some well-executed stunts at
half time.

making his yardage so that Stanford
could 4iold the ball and have four more
trjes to make the six yards that sepa
rated them from a touchdown.
Game Lacks Spirit
The game lacked the spirit of a true
Intercollegiate game, and fully three
fifths of the spectators were pro-Ala
bama, probably because of the under
dog psychology. In his earnestness,
the referee furnished the crowd with
some laughs when he dived into the
pile while it was forming in order to
get the correct position of the ball. He
also did some hair-splitting measuring.
The game moved slowly and were
it not for the brilliant passing attack
used by Stanford, would have proved
mo«t uninteresting.
The Stanford team appeared re
splendent in new silk pants. Before
the game the band did its usual stunt,
honoring the visitors by a rendition of
"Dixie." The Pasadena Elks' band
played for Alabama. The rooters
showed some well-executed stunts at
half time.
Two undefeated elevens represent
ing two sections of the country met
on the field of battle in the Rose Bowl
at Pasadena on New Year's Day to
settle the mythical Nattnra!* Sham
pionship. The resulting 7-7 tie leaves
the honor still a myth.
Powerful line plunges and a desper
ate fighting spirit saved the Alabama
team from a defeat by what appeared
to be a superior eleven when a break
gave them possession of the ball on
the 14-yard line five minutes before
the final gun. For up to that time the
game was decidedly Stanford's. A kick
by Wilton in the fourth quarter was
blocked by Alabama. Although Wilton
raced down the field and recovered on
the 14-yard line, the ball went to the
opposition on downs. Johnson, a sub
stitute, went in for Alabama and in five
plays succeeded in plunging over the
line for the tally. With the game at
stake, the kick for extra point was
successful.
Cards Score Easily
Stanford's score was easily made
late in the first quarter, by a spec
tacular passing attack. The first play
was a surprise pass by "Biff" Hoffman
to "Tricky Dicky" Hyland, who caught
the ball on the dead run and was
downed on the Alabama 30-yard line.
In seven plays Stanford carried the
ball to the Alabama 11-yard line. There
Bogue tried a place kick, when the
Alabama defense stiffened, but missed
his attempt.
It was not until late in the first
period that Stanford put over its
touchdown. Straight rushing football
carried the ball up the field to within
scoring distance, when Alabama ex
pected Hyland to pass to Shipkey, as
Bad been Stanford's custom, the Card's
shifted the deal and Bogue passed to
Walker, who ran over the goal line
around Alabama's right end practically
unopposed. Bogue's goal kick added
the extra point.
Stanford Superior
In scrimmage play, the Stanford
line showed its power against the
heavy Southerners, and the actual
yardage gained was far greater than
Alabama's. It was evident that Coach
Wade had trained his men on defense
of the famous Stanford reverses, for
they failed to not the customary yard
age. Bogue's off-tackle plunges, Hoff
man's powerful bucks and passes were
consistent ground-gainers for the Car
dinal. Ted Shipkey did some surpris
ing open-field running, carrying the
ball like a back.
Ilyland was a marked man.
Once or twice he gave the spec
tators a thrill, but the repeated tackles
of the entire Alabama team showed its
effect and he was taken from the game
at the beginning of the second half.
The defense was nearly perfect. Swan
did notable work against the heavy
Southern line, as did Harris and the
other man on the line. Bogue was a
tower of strength in all departments
of the game. He smeared plays, re
• ceived and threw passes, and time
and again made gains through the
line.
Ends All Star
No finer end play has ever been
seen anywhere than that put up by
Shipkey and Walker for Stanford, and
Hoyt Winslett and Ben Enis of Ala
bama. They were all over the place
and they dived into the interference
with a recklessness that was amazing.
Stanford showed far more on of
fense than Alabama and the game is
a story of missed opportunities. Twice
Bogue failed to make a field goal, one
failure undoubtedly due to the glaring
sun which was against Stanford in
the first quarter. In the fourth quarter
Stanford had a great chance to cinch
the victory after Shipkey had recov
ered Taylor's fumble, but as before
related Bogue failed by two inches of
making his yardage so that Stanford
could 4iold the ball and have four more
trjes to make the six yards that sepa

tower of strength in all departments
of the game. He smeared plays, re
• ceived and threw passes, and time
and again made gains through the
line.
Ends All Star
No finer end play has ever been
seen anywhere than that put up by
Shipkey and Walker for Stanford, and
Hoyt Winslett and Ben Enis of Ala
bama. They were all over the place
and they dived into the interference
with a recklessness that was amazing.
Stanford showed far more on of
fense than Alabama and the game is
a story of missed opportunities. Twice
Bogue failed to make a field goal, one
failure undoubtedly due to the glaring
sun which was against Stanford in
the first quarter. In the fourth quarter
Stanford had a great chance to cinch
the victory after Shipkey had recov
ered Taylor's fumble, but as before
related Bogue failed by two inches of
making his yardage so that Stanford
could 4iold the ball and have four more
trjes to make the six yards that sepa
rated them from a touchdown.
Game Lacks Spirit
The game lacked the spirit of a true
Intercollegiate game, and fully three
fifths of the spectators were pro-Ala
bama, probably because of the under
dog psychology. In his earnestness,
the referee furnished the crowd with
some laughs when he dived into the
pile while it was forming in order to
get the correct position of the ball. He
also did some hair-splitting measuring.
The game moved slowly and were
it not for the brilliant passing attack
used by Stanford, would have proved
mo«t uninteresting.
The Stanford team appeared re
splendent in new silk pants. Before
the game the band did its usual stunt,
honoring the visitors by a rendition of
"Dixie." The Pasadena Elks' band
played for Alabama. The rooters
showed some well-executed stunts at
half time.
Two undefeated elevens represent
ing two sections of the country met
on the field of battle in the Rose Bowl
at Pasadena on New Year's Day to
settle the mythical Nattnra!* Sham
pionship. The resulting 7-7 tie leaves
the honor still a myth.
Powerful line plunges and a desper
ate fighting spirit saved the Alabama
team from a defeat by what appeared
to be a superior eleven when a break
gave them possession of the ball on
the 14-yard line five minutes before
the final gun. For up to that time the
game was decidedly Stanford's. A kick
by Wilton in the fourth quarter was
blocked by Alabama. Although Wilton
raced down the field and recovered on
the 14-yard line, the ball went to the
opposition on downs. Johnson, a sub
stitute, went in for Alabama and in five
plays succeeded in plunging over the
line for the tally. With the game at
stake, the kick for extra point was
successful.
Cards Score Easily
Stanford's score was easily made
late in the first quarter, by a spec
tacular passing attack. The first play
was a surprise pass by "Biff" Hoffman
to "Tricky Dicky" Hyland, who caught
the ball on the dead run and was
downed on the Alabama 30-yard line.
In seven plays Stanford carried the
ball to the Alabama 11-yard line. There
Bogue tried a place kick, when the
Alabama defense stiffened, but missed
his attempt.
It was not until late in the first
period that Stanford put over its
touchdown. Straight rushing football
carried the ball up the field to within
scoring distance, when Alabama ex
pected Hyland to pass to Shipkey, as
Bad been Stanford's custom, the Card's
shifted the deal and Bogue passed to
Walker, who ran over the goal line
around Alabama's right end practically
unopposed. Bogue's goal kick added
the extra point.
Stanford Superior
In scrimmage play, the Stanford
line showed its power against the
heavy Southerners, and the actual
yardage gained was far greater than
Alabama's. It was evident that Coach
Wade had trained his men on defense
of the famous Stanford reverses, for
they failed to not the customary yard
age. Bogue's off-tackle plunges, Hoff
man's powerful bucks and passes were
consistent ground-gainers for the Car
dinal. Ted Shipkey did some surpris
ing open-field running, carrying the
ball like a back.
Ilyland was a marked man.
Once or twice he gave the spec
tators a thrill, but the repeated tackles
of the entire Alabama team showed its
effect and he was taken from the game
at the beginning of the second half.
The defense was nearly perfect. Swan
did notable work against the heavy
Southern line, as did Harris and the
other man on the line. Bogue was a
tower of strength in all departments
of the game. He smeared plays, re
• ceived and threw passes, and time
and again made gains through the
line.
