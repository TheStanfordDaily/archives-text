# STANFORD ROOTERS SECTION DISPLAYS VARIETY OF STUNTS
## Identification System for Possessors of Tickets Brings Confusion 
### 
Stanford's rooting section in the
Rose Bowl at Pasadena Saturday num
bered approximately 1400, and despite
the presence of usual errors, the four
teen stunts were produced with great
precision and accuracy. The most spec
tacular of the card exhibitions was the
formation of a map of the United
States in white, with a red border, the
Great Lakes being shown in blue, an
"S" showing in California, and an "A"
in the vicinity of Tuscaloosa. The next
movement brought forth a red ques
tion mark in the center of the map;
then a large red "S" surmounted the
punctuation mark, and the meaning
was clear to the spectators, who ap
plauded heartily.
Another series that attracted atten
tion was the formation of a white
colonial arch with a white "A" under
neath, all on a red background, the
following stunt showing a brown sand
stone arch, as of the Quad, with
"LSJU" in red below.
Season's Greetings
"Happy New Year, 'Bama" was j
given in four movements, white on a ;
red background, and "1926" was
changed to "1927," betokening the
march of time. In honor of the rose
fete, a stunt comprising two red roses
with green stems, above which was
shown the inscription "T of R," was
presented. An axe and a two tone block
"S" completed the display.
The band was present at the game
and paraded before the rooters during
the time before the teams took the
field. Alabama was represented by no
rooting section, but a Tournament of
Roses band played alternately with
the Cardinal musicians.
An extraordinary innovation in the
method of admitting holders of rooters'
tickets was put into effect at the Bowl, i
Representatives of the Board of Ath-1
letic Control were stationed in a booth ]
outside the fence surrounding the j
stadium and engaged in validating j
each rooter's ticket before it could be |
presented at the gate.
Trouble Over Tickets
Holders of rooters' tickets, many of
whom were obviously not students
registered in the University, were
obliged to crowd up to the booth and
give their names, University address,
bawl-out average, and any other infor
mation the clerk thought fit to ask for.
If the questions could be answered
satisfactorily, the ticket was stamped
"VALID" and the holder entered the
stadium. If he were unable to answer
the questions, he was forced to pay
five dollars for the ticket before the
valid stamp yas afffxed.
The object of the procedure was
apparently to discourage those who
had purchased scalped tickets, but the
process of validating the tickets took
so much time that at about 2 o'clock,
some fifteen minutes before the start
of the game, those who were yet wait
ing in line to get themselves identified
were allowed to enter the stadium
without their tickets being validated.
