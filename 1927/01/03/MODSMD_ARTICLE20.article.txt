# WEIGHT REDUCTION DANGEROUS, SAYS M.D.
## 
### 
Weight reduction treatment for vain
but lazy women who are from five to
fifteen pounds over the stylish figure,
and whose craving for slimness Is in
fluenced more by consideration of
fashion than health, is a questionable
business, usually foolish, and some
times dangerous, says Dr. H. Llsser,
Assistant Clinical Professor of Medi
cine, and Dr. H. C. Shepardson, As
sistant in Medicine at the University
of California Medical School, in an
article devoted to the problem of
obesity resulting from pathological
conditions of body glands.
Obesity treatment should be con
fined to those cases of children or
adults wh oare from 20' to 100 or more
pounds over weight, the doctors suate.
Hut they odd that in such cases weight
reduction is a matter of health.
