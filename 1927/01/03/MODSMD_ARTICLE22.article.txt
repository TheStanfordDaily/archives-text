# Cardinals Tied
## 
### 
The blending of Cardinal and Crimson seems to have left a Red of
110 particular shade. Stanford was not defeated but tied. But added
to the general red hue of the day was the firey red in the eyes of the
great mass of Stanford students who were forced to stand in line to
validate their rooters' tickets.
The Stanford officials were making a last attempt to thwart scalpers
of the rooting section tickets. But the impracticability of the scheme
was shown when just a few moments before the kickoff all barriers
were let down and the men, women, and children holding rooters' tickets
were admitted.
It is extremely difficult for the Board of Athletic Control to cope
with a situation so gigantic as this when it receives little support from
the student body. Unquestionably it was an injustice to ask a thousand
and some actual students to validate their tickets, but when the section
is to be filled with women with babes in arms, tottering old men, and
children, the situation becomes a farce, and a stop must be made some
where.
It is usually a great aid to the struggling student to buy rooting
section tickets for the entire family at a three-dollar-and-fifty-cent sav
ing per member of the family. Also if a ticket can be sold at a profit
the money is always welcomed. But even with all ideals of honesty
set aside—it is not justice to the rest of the students who want a root
ing section and whose family paid the legitimate and prescribed price
of admission.
It is only fair for the Board of Athletic Control to put a stop to
this absurdity. But last Saturday general student opinion did not judge
the method in practice as reasonable.
The stop must be made from the distribution department and not
at the gates just before the game is to begin. It is hard enough to
get tickets to games nowadays without having to batter and worry in
order to gain admission.
