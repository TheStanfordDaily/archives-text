The Editor, Sir:
I have read with interest the com
ments in the Daily regarding the
Y-.M.C.A. May I add my opinions to
what I think is beginning to be a
much-overworked subject?
As I read the arguments as they are
set forth, I smile to myself and think
how much of human nature is por
trayed. The Y ran along smoothly and
successfully until it touched our pock
etbooks, and then what a wail of pro
test went up! and what a wonderful
opportunity to express our disgust of
such an organization! It's not a new
story. Rather it is a very, very old
. ne. Whenever a group of people at
tempt any kind of reform, whether it
is in the quiet, slow method pursued
by the Y, or in a more spectacular
form, it may well expect criticism. It's
just human nature! We don't want to
be reformed!
We may as well admit that the Y
is NOT perfect or ideal! It never has
been, never will be, and never pre
tends to be! Neither are Y secretaries
angels on earth! I have known a good
many secretaries of the Y, however,
and I have found them to be the best
group of "good sports" and fine men
that I have ever known. Maybe the
editor of this paper was not far wrong
when he spoke of the Y as the "or
ganization nobody knows," and he
might well have referred to their sec
retaries as the "men nobody knows."
And the best thing for a lot of us to
do is to quit knocking and get ac
quainted with the things we are talk
ing about.
The funny part of it all is that when
we have all had an opportunity to let
off a lot of "steam," the arguments
will die a natural death; the Y will
continue to do a very much needed
work that no one else can do or will
do; and a lot of us will continue to
"stay clear" of that bunch because we
are afraid that we MIGHT havo our
"souls saved," and how inconvenient
that would be! —M.A.W., '28.

The Editor, Sir:
I have read with interest the com
ments in the Daily regarding the
Y-.M.C.A. May I add my opinions to
what I think is beginning to be a
much-overworked subject?
As I read the arguments as they are
set forth, I smile to myself and think
how much of human nature is por
trayed. The Y ran along smoothly and
successfully until it touched our pock
etbooks, and then what a wail of pro
test went up! and what a wonderful
opportunity to express our disgust of
such an organization! It's not a new
story. Rather it is a very, very old
. ne. Whenever a group of people at
tempt any kind of reform, whether it
is in the quiet, slow method pursued
by the Y, or in a more spectacular
form, it may well expect criticism. It's
just human nature! We don't want to
be reformed!
We may as well admit that the Y
is NOT perfect or ideal! It never has
been, never will be, and never pre
tends to be! Neither are Y secretaries
angels on earth! I have known a good
many secretaries of the Y, however,
and I have found them to be the best
group of "good sports" and fine men
that I have ever known. Maybe the
editor of this paper was not far wrong
when he spoke of the Y as the "or
ganization nobody knows," and he
might well have referred to their sec
retaries as the "men nobody knows."
And the best thing for a lot of us to
do is to quit knocking and get ac
quainted with the things we are talk
ing about.
The funny part of it all is that when
we have all had an opportunity to let
off a lot of "steam," the arguments
will die a natural death; the Y will
continue to do a very much needed
work that no one else can do or will
do; and a lot of us will continue to
"stay clear" of that bunch because we
are afraid that we MIGHT havo our
"souls saved," and how inconvenient
that would be! —M.A.W., '28.
