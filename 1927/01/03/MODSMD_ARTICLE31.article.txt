The Editor, Sir:
Who gets the money for the regis
tration of football tickets when the
applications are not filled and there
fore the tickets are neither mailed nor

j registered?
Last fall I applied for and received
one rooter's ticket and two additional
| tickets for the Big Game. I also ap
plied for two tickets under classifica
tion 9 and paid $10.20 for them. The
; twenty cents was supposedly for the
registration of the tickets. However,
as the supply was exhausted before
this classification was reached, I did
not get these extra tickets.
About three weeks after the game
| was over, I received a check from the
Board of Athletic Control for $10.00.
The letter was not registered and
bore only a two-cent stamp. A few
days later I went over to the gym to
ascertain whether my twenty cents
was kept for some good reason,
whether it was kept through error, or
whether it was just a bit of extra
small change in someone's pocket. A
good-looking girl came to the desk and
I told her that I understood that my
money was to be refunded in full in
case that I did not receive tjfe tickets.
She said, "Oh, you mean you want
twenty cents," took it out of a till and
handed it to me without even asking
, my name.
It's perfectly plain that I got my
j refund, but I would like to have the
Board of Athletic Control explain a
few things to me. If I had not gone
| after it, who would have received my
money? What right did the office girl
have to give me money merely be
cause I asked for it? Was the money
in the till a special fund to be passed
out freely to anyone that said he had
jsome coming to him? How many other
checks 20 cents too small were mailed
to people who did not receive their
tickets? And finally, who is the indi
! vidual or group of individuals who
, gets twenty cents from each of thou
sands of unfilled applications every
'year? —A 1 Kurtz,
