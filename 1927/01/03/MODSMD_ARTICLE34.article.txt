# COWDERY EXPLAINS BASIS OF ADMISSION; REASONS FOR RULES
## Increase in Attendance at High School Brings More Applications 
### 
As the attendance of the high
schools of California has been grow
ing, so has there been a consequent
growth in the registration at Stanford,
says Karl M. Cowdery, assistant regis
trar.
In 11*00 nine out of every 1000 at
tended high school in California. In
1925 the proportion had grown to 49
out of every 1000, or an increase of a
little more than five times as many.
The actual increase in number was
from 13,000 to 212,000, or a growth of
1600 per cent. The recent increase in
high school enrollment has no doubt
resulted from the compulsory educa
tion law in the state.
Growth Described
The increase in the number of high
school graduates has resulted in a
greater demand for college education.
At Stanford the registration in 1890
was 490 students. In 1900 there was
an increase to 1400, and at present
there are more than 4000, including
summer registration. Since 1900 there
has been a threefold increase in the
number of students registered at the
University.
"During the last three years," said
Cowdery, "there have been just twice
as many applicants for admission as
Stanford has been able to take care
of. All these candidates have fulfilled
minimum requirements and are quali
fied. It becomes the duty of the Admis
sion Committee to make selections
from these applicants as there are
more of them than there are vacancies
to be filled."
Choice Basis Changed
The old basis of selection was on
the high school record and on personal
recommendations alone. There was
difficulty in making a distinction on
the basis of recommendations, as they
come from interested friends and rela
tives who are prone to exaggerate.
Consequently an intelligent selection
was not easy, says Cowdery.
The persons with the highest high
school grades were most llikelv to be
However, as those with
low grades often made good at college,
it was unfair to rule off arbitrarily all
those below a certain level. To aid
this difficulty the Admission Commit
tee has now added the College Apti
tude Test which every candidate for
admission must take. Experiments
were made for three years before the
test was finally brought into use.
It has been found that low scores
on the tests are more often accom
panied by failures to do satisfactory
work in the University. Since those
who make moderate scores are apt to
do well also, it is difficult to make the
finer distinctions. Admission is now
based, therefore, on the score in the
Aptitude Test, previous scholarship
records, personal recommendation, and
high school activities.

those below a certain level. To aid
this difficulty the Admission Commit
tee has now added the College Apti
tude Test which every candidate for
admission must take. Experiments
were made for three years before the
test was finally brought into use.
It has been found that low scores
on the tests are more often accom
panied by failures to do satisfactory
work in the University. Since those
who make moderate scores are apt to
do well also, it is difficult to make the
finer distinctions. Admission is now
based, therefore, on the score in the
Aptitude Test, previous scholarship
records, personal recommendation, and
high school activities.
As the attendance of the high
schools of California has been grow
ing, so has there been a consequent
growth in the registration at Stanford,
says Karl M. Cowdery, assistant regis
trar.
In 11*00 nine out of every 1000 at
tended high school in California. In
1925 the proportion had grown to 49
out of every 1000, or an increase of a
little more than five times as many.
The actual increase in number was
from 13,000 to 212,000, or a growth of
1600 per cent. The recent increase in
high school enrollment has no doubt
resulted from the compulsory educa
tion law in the state.
Growth Described
The increase in the number of high
school graduates has resulted in a
greater demand for college education.
At Stanford the registration in 1890
was 490 students. In 1900 there was
an increase to 1400, and at present
there are more than 4000, including
summer registration. Since 1900 there
has been a threefold increase in the
number of students registered at the
University.
"During the last three years," said
Cowdery, "there have been just twice
as many applicants for admission as
Stanford has been able to take care
of. All these candidates have fulfilled
minimum requirements and are quali
fied. It becomes the duty of the Admis
sion Committee to make selections
from these applicants as there are
more of them than there are vacancies
to be filled."
Choice Basis Changed
The old basis of selection was on
the high school record and on personal
recommendations alone. There was
difficulty in making a distinction on
the basis of recommendations, as they
come from interested friends and rela
tives who are prone to exaggerate.
Consequently an intelligent selection
was not easy, says Cowdery.
The persons with the highest high
school grades were most llikelv to be
However, as those with
low grades often made good at college,
it was unfair to rule off arbitrarily all
those below a certain level. To aid
this difficulty the Admission Commit
