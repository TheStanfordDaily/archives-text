# POP HARRIS LAMENTS DECLINE IN HIS BUSINESS BOOTBLACK BLAMES MOTOR CARS, "OXFORD BAGS" NEWSSTAND NO LONGER PROFITABLE VENTURE
## 
### 
Abolish automobiles and "oxford
bags," and you will have won the per
petual gratitude of Pop Harris, cam
pus bootblack who has shined colle
giate shoes in his little stand at the
Bookstore car stop for the past ten
years, and who still seems to be going
strong.
Dusty Roads Helped
In the old days when Stanford men
used to trudge the dusty "road that
leads to Mayfleld," Pop did a rushing
business. But now, he laments, "they
have their automobiles." As soon as
they get out of class away they go,
and away goes the shoe-shining busi
ness to the bootblacks of Palo Alto.
As for oxford bags, well Pop is firm
in his belief that some students wear
them just to hide the looks of their
shoes and thus thwart an honest boot
black's attempts at their nickels and
dimes. In his words, "these long pants
with the wide cuffs have knocked the
business flat! No one sees the shoes,
so why shine 'em?" The veteran boot
black couldn't keep from chuckling,
however, as he discussed the economic
problem of "oxford bags," and perhaps
he could be prevailed upon to let them
remain, provided autos were done
away with.

"Now with these girls it's different,"
he continued. "Their trad,e is
best." They keep their shoes well
shined during the fall and winter sea

sons, iii spite of the rain, but in the
spring come the white shoes, and
away goes the trade. White shoes are
the natural enemies of any bootblack.
Asked if the decrease • (fifty per
cent) in his business could be due to
the students not pressing up as much
as previously, Pop laughed at the*idea.
He is firm in his conviction that they
dress up jpst about the same amount,
though that isn't much exccpt on Fri
day and Saturday nights. "They don't
even dress up on Sundays!" he ex
claimed in an awed tone.
Pop Mournful
Pop was indeed mournful when he
recalled the days when the Stanford
Toonerville was in its glory. "Why,
they used to have to hang on outside
all the time, there were so many in
side," he declared. Of course, those
hooking rides on the outside were
considered quite innocent then. For
bidding the hooking privilege is an
innovation of the past year. When the
bouncing street cars were the only
means of transportation, the campus
stops were fairly thronging with po
tential slioe-shining jobs.
Besides getting their shoes shined
in Palo Alto, Stanford students make
a mistake, in Pop's opinion, in not
paying enough attention to current
events. He laughingly admitted that
the sales from his newspaper stand
amount to about eight cents a day on
the average.

however, as he discussed the economic
problem of "oxford bags," and perhaps
he could be prevailed upon to let them
remain, provided autos were done
away with.

"Now with these girls it's different,"
he continued. "Their trad,e is
best." They keep their shoes well
shined during the fall and winter sea

sons, iii spite of the rain, but in the
spring come the white shoes, and
away goes the trade. White shoes are
the natural enemies of any bootblack.
Asked if the decrease • (fifty per
cent) in his business could be due to
the students not pressing up as much
as previously, Pop laughed at the*idea.
He is firm in his conviction that they
dress up jpst about the same amount,
though that isn't much exccpt on Fri
day and Saturday nights. "They don't
even dress up on Sundays!" he ex
claimed in an awed tone.
Pop Mournful
Pop was indeed mournful when he
recalled the days when the Stanford
Toonerville was in its glory. "Why,
they used to have to hang on outside
all the time, there were so many in
side," he declared. Of course, those
hooking rides on the outside were
considered quite innocent then. For
bidding the hooking privilege is an
innovation of the past year. When the
bouncing street cars were the only
means of transportation, the campus
stops were fairly thronging with po
tential slioe-shining jobs.
Besides getting their shoes shined
in Palo Alto, Stanford students make
a mistake, in Pop's opinion, in not
paying enough attention to current
events. He laughingly admitted that
the sales from his newspaper stand
amount to about eight cents a day on
the average.
Abolish automobiles and "oxford
bags," and you will have won the per
petual gratitude of Pop Harris, cam
pus bootblack who has shined colle
giate shoes in his little stand at the
Bookstore car stop for the past ten
years, and who still seems to be going
strong.
Dusty Roads Helped
In the old days when Stanford men
used to trudge the dusty "road that
leads to Mayfleld," Pop did a rushing
business. But now, he laments, "they
have their automobiles." As soon as
they get out of class away they go,
and away goes the shoe-shining busi
ness to the bootblacks of Palo Alto.
As for oxford bags, well Pop is firm
in his belief that some students wear
them just to hide the looks of their
shoes and thus thwart an honest boot
black's attempts at their nickels and
dimes. In his words, "these long pants
with the wide cuffs have knocked the
business flat! No one sees the shoes,
so why shine 'em?" The veteran boot
black couldn't keep from chuckling,
however, as he discussed the economic
problem of "oxford bags," and perhaps
he could be prevailed upon to let them
remain, provided autos were done
away with.
