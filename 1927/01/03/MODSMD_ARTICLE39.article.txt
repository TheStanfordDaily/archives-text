## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. I.—With two
games under their belts, the Southern
California basketers will spend the
next two weeks in practice sessions
preparatory to the start of their non
conference games beginning January
S with Whittier College. The Trojans
showed a marked lack of practice in
their victory over Southwestern Uni
versity arid their defeat at the hands
of the crack Hollywood Athletic Club
team.
In both preliminary contests the
Southern Californians played with a
makeshift lineup. Morris Badgro, for
ward, and Bruce McHaffie, guard,
were both out of these games since
they returned to their homes for the
Christmas vacation. Johnny Moore re
placed Badgro in these two games and
was high-point scorer of the Trojan
squad in each. He looks like a regular
sub for either Badgro or Bone, for
wards.
Following the Whittier game, the
Southern Californians meet Occidental
January 11 and Arizona here January
14 and 15. They then start play in
the California division of the Pacific
Coast Conference against Stanford
here January 21. This is followed by
one game at Berkeley on January 29,
two against Stanford at Palo Alto,
February 4 and 5, and two with Cali
fornia here February 11 and 12.
