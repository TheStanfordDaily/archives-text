# LIGHT OPERA IS FIRST ON CAMPUS IN RECENT YEARS
## 
### 
February 19 has been set as the
date for the presentation of Gilbert
and Sullivan's comic opera, "Princess
Ida," which is to be given by a student
cast.
Production of this opera marks the
resumption on the part of the Univer
sity of the policy of staging such per
formances. For the past few years the
Ram's Head annual show has taken
the place of the operas formerly
given, but with the burlesque a thing
of the past a date on which a musical
show might be given was again avail
able.
Allen, Davis Combine
Warren 1). Allen, University organ- I
ist, who with Gordon Davis is in
charge of the production, announces
that an unusual amount of talent has
been found among the student body.
The cast of the play will be headed
by Winifred Estabrook, a recent Stan
ford graduate who for the past year
has been teaching music in San Jose.
Louis Graveure, the baritone who
opened the Associated Students Con
cert Series here during the fall quar
ter, has praised Miss Estabrook's
talent.

| The rest of the cast includes Mar
gery Blackwelder, who has been
prominent in musical activities at
j Stanford for the past two years, and
Alonzo Cass, veteran of many campus
, musical productions, together with
several others who have been promi
aent in dramatics.
Play Not Well-Known
Princess Ida, the opera which has
been selected for presentation, is one
Jof Gilbert and Sullivan's less well
. known works. Its first production was
at the Savoy Theatre in London in
1884. On that occasion the programs
| announced that the play was a "re
j spectful travesty" on Tennyson's
"Princess."
Because of the difficulties of produc
tion and because of the fact that the
music of the piece is slightly heavier
than is usually the case with a Gilbert
and Sullivan opera, "Princess Ida"
has enjoyed the popularity of
certain other works of the great Eng
lish collaborators. Mr. Allen, however,
says he believes that the piece should
have a particular appeal to a Univer
sity audience which will appreciate
the subtleties of the production.
