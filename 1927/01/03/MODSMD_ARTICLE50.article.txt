# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is the "Nurmi of Sweden," who
will, in all probability, be seen in
action on the board tracks of this
country in the near future. Coming to
study American educational systems
Edvin Gide will, I trust, be permitted
to give American runners a chance to
study the Scandinavian system of run
ning.
American middle-distance runners
and coaches studied the form and
habits of Nurmi, the Phantom Finn,
very closely in 1925, and if Wide, who
has beaten Nurmi, is as good as they
say he is, then all track and field fans
can benefit by a close scrutiny of the
manner of running of this, the newest
of the foreign specters. Perhaps the
middle-distance stars of the United
States might yet win an Olympic race
in 1928, if they Jiad a chance to put
in a little more concentrated study of

men like Nurmi and Wide. If only Dr.
Peltzer of Germany would pay us a
visit!
The genial Mr. Dan Ferris, of the
Amateur Athletic Union, informs me
that Wide's name is pronounced
"Weedie," that he is a blond (how
surprising!), and that his running ac
tion is not so smooth as Nurmi's, hut
smoother than that of another famous
Finn, Willie Ritola. Wide is not quite
so tall as Nurmi, rather stocky, and
runs with a long stride and quite high
off the ground. And believe me, he gets
there, as his mark of 9:1 1-5 for two
miles will testify.
The question of "Who is there in
America who can give the Swedish
star any sort of a race from 1300
meters to two miles?" is one that is
not so easily answered. Lloyd Hahn
and Ritola are the only two names that
come to mind, though the veteran,
Jimmy Connolly, might still have an
other good season left in those sturdy
legs of his. It looks as though this
newest invader of our shores will be
able to send word to the folks back
home, just as Julius Caesar did, "Veni,
Wide, Vice."
