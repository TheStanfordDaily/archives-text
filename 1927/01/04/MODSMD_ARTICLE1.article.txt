# COMMITTEE NAMED TO REVISE STUDENT BODY CONSTITUTION
## Existing Rules in State of Confusion; Need Systemization FINISHED BY FEBRUARY Robert Littler Chairman of Committee; Work Will Begin This Week 
### 
One month hence the Associated
Students of Stanford University, bet
ter known as the A.S.S.U., may have
a new constitution. The notoriously
defective body of rules and regulations
now in existence are being revised, re- j
organized, and in general rewritten by
a body named by Stanley Weigel
last night. A motion passed by the
Executive Committee last October
made provision for the revision.
Committee Members
Robert Littler, political science
graduate in the 1925 class, is chairman
of the committee, other members of
•which include John C. Duniway, Char
lotte Lovekin, Karl Doerr, George
Ellsworth, Lucia Champlin, Fred Thon,
Helen Bell, and John Linley. Professor
Edwin A. Cottrell, Harry M. Bennett.
J. E. McDowell, Robert E. Lewis, and
Stanley A. Weigel are ex-officio mem
bers.
Littler was chosen by Weigel for
his experience and academic view
point. Following his graduation here
Littler taught political science in the
University of Hawaii. He is at present
working for an advanced degree, and
is also engaged in writing a book on
the government of the Territory of
Hawaii.
Much Criticized
Like the famous Topsy, the A.S.S.U.
constitution has "just sort of grown."
It has been changed and amended con
stantly by succeeding Ex Committees.
As no system of organization and
classification has been observed, the
various by-laws and amendments are
at present in a state of jumbled con
fusion.
The committee is charged with en
tirely reorganizing the constitution
and seeing that the various amend
ments are properly classified and
grouped. The duties of the different
student officers and departments will
be more clearly defined, and possibly
changes will be made in the publica
tions management.
Start at Once
The committee will start work this
week, and will probably have the new
constitution ready to submit for stu
dent approval at the February elec
tions. In deciding the various details
recommendations will be accepted
from everybody concerned. Those
wishing to propose changes are re
quested to communicate their sugges
tions through Helen Bell, secretary
for the committee.

classification has been observed, the
various by-laws and amendments are
at present in a state of jumbled con
fusion.
The committee is charged with en
tirely reorganizing the constitution
and seeing that the various amend
ments are properly classified and
grouped. The duties of the different
student officers and departments will
be more clearly defined, and possibly
changes will be made in the publica
tions management.
Start at Once
The committee will start work this
week, and will probably have the new
constitution ready to submit for stu
dent approval at the February elec
tions. In deciding the various details
recommendations will be accepted
from everybody concerned. Those
wishing to propose changes are re
quested to communicate their sugges
tions through Helen Bell, secretary
for the committee.
