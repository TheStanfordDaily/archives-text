# FRESHMAN SQUAD IN FIRST WORKOUT FOR BASKETBALL SEASON
## Coach Hunt Starts Practice With Smallest Turnout In Recent Years 
### 
Freshman basketball practice start- j
ed yesterday afternoon in the pavilion
under the direction of Coaches Hunt |
and Mitchell. Twenty-nine aspirants :
for positions on the 1930 cage team j
were present for the first official work- j
out of the season. The yearling hoop
sters practiced for three weeks last ,
quarter in preparation for the inter-1
class series, but yesterday's session
was the first one in charge of Head J
I
Coach Hunt.
Hunt put his candidates through an
hour's workout, most of the time being
devoted to drilling in the fundamentals
of the game, such as dribbling, pass
ing, pivoting, and some basket-shoot
ing. At the end of the hour the fresh
men were divided into teams of five,
and each one was given a chance to
get into a short scrimmage.
Small Turnout
This year's turnout is one of the
smallest Hunt has had for several
years, but more candidates are ex
pected to come out by the end of the
week. Several stars appeared in the
interclass series, and with two or
three men as a nucleus, Hunt should
have no trouble putting a fast team
on the floor.
Harry Berg, former Stockton player,
showed to great advantage in the
class games. He is an experienced for
ward, and at the present time is eas
ily the cleverest player on the squad.
I Long, a Lowell High forward, worked
[well with Berg in the interclass. Gari
[ botto, Steinbeck, and Fishbeck, are
; all good prospects for center. So far,
Garibotto, with his experience in the
interclass, seems to hold the edge.
Nye, former Alhamhra star, looks
'good at running guard, and works in
very well with the Berg-Long forward
combination. Detrick, Golden, and
Thompson are the best so far at the
standing guard position. It is hard to
get a good idea of the men in the
first workout, however, and Hunt be
lieves that by the end of the week a
number of promising players will be
brought forward.
Freshman practice will be held
every afternoon at 3 o'clock In the
pavilion, and all freshmen wishing to
try out for the team are urged to be
out at that time. Coach Hunt an
nounces that all candidates taking
laboratory courses should come out as
noon as they can after their classes
end.
