I Stanford's 1927 basketball varsity
j swings into action tonight in the
pavilion against the University of
; California, Southern Branch, last
I year's titleholders of the Southern
j California conference. The game be
, gins at 8 o'clock, and there will be no
| preliminary.
Despite the three defeats suffered by
the Cardinals in the tour of the South
during the Christmas holidays, Coach
i Husky Hunt expressed himself as
| satisfied with the showing made. In
I the three losses, played against crack
i athletic club teams, Hunt's men
: showed streaks of power, exceeding
; the expectations of early-season dope
'sters.
: In meeting the Southern Branch to
l morrow night, the Cardinals face a
| team which on paper looks to be the
; favorite at the tip-off. The Grizzlies
j hold a decisive victory over the Ore
i son Aggies who in turn have the scalp
of the Hollywood Athletic Club dang
| ling at their belt. This would not be
I so bad were it not for the fact that
1 the latter quintet defeated Stanford
in Los Angeles.
However, basketball is not a game
which figures so well on paper because
of the tendencies of teams to have
"off" nights and the attendant diffi
culties of long trips. This last was one
of the difficulties which faced the
Cards on their southern tour.
Anderson to Start
As his starting lineup tonight Coach
Hunt will probably use Captain David
and McCandless at forwards, Ander
son at standing guard, Biaggini at
running guard, and Jayred at center.
Bryant may start at forward while
On the Branch team, Ketclium and
Vincenti may be a starter at standing
guard.
