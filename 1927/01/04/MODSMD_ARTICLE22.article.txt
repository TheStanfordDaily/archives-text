# STANFORD BASKETBALL TEAM CLASHES WITH BRUINS TONIGHT
## Coach Husky Hunt Satisfied With Showing Made in Tour of South FIRST HOME CAGE GAME Southern Branch Favorite On Paper to Defeat Cardinal Five 
### Fred Speers 
I Stanford's 1927 basketball varsity
j swings into action tonight in the
pavilion against the University of
; California, Southern Branch, last
I year's titleholders of the Southern
j California conference. The game be
, gins at 8 o'clock, and there will be no
| preliminary.
Despite the three defeats suffered by
the Cardinals in the tour of the South
during the Christmas holidays, Coach
i Husky Hunt expressed himself as
| satisfied with the showing made. In
I the three losses, played against crack
i athletic club teams, Hunt's men
: showed streaks of power, exceeding
; the expectations of early-season dope
'sters.
: In meeting the Southern Branch to
l morrow night, the Cardinals face a
| team which on paper looks to be the
; favorite at the tip-off. The Grizzlies
j hold a decisive victory over the Ore
i son Aggies who in turn have the scalp
of the Hollywood Athletic Club dang
| ling at their belt. This would not be
I so bad were it not for the fact that
1 the latter quintet defeated Stanford
in Los Angeles.
However, basketball is not a game
which figures so well on paper because
of the tendencies of teams to have
"off" nights and the attendant diffi
culties of long trips. This last was one
of the difficulties which faced the
Cards on their southern tour.
Anderson to Start
As his starting lineup tonight Coach
Hunt will probably use Captain David
and McCandless at forwards, Ander
son at standing guard, Biaggini at
running guard, and Jayred at center.
Bryant may start at forward while
On the Branch team, Ketclium and
Vincenti may be a starter at standing
guard.
Armstrong are slated as the main cogs
of Coach Paddy Works' live. Roth are
veterans, ably seconded by a set of
relatively inexperienced but capable
players.
Despite the early stage of the sea- 1
son, Hunt has developed a team from
! his squad of sixteen players which
compares favorably with the early ap
pearance of former Cardinal fives.
Stanford's ability to stage brilliant,
telling comebacks has characterized
the play during the southern tour.
In the second half of the game with
the Pacific Club of Long Reach, Hunt's
men, though nosed out by one point,
ran up 22 points "to their opponents'
10. That, against a crack athletic club
team, denotes potential power which
may be converted into victories as the I
season progresses.
The Branch game, coming at the ;
time it does, catches Stanford at a \
bad time. The team practiced last j
night in the pavilion after a lay-off
caused by the team's seeing the Stan- 1
ford-Alabama football game and not;
returning until yesterday morning.
However, Hunt is optimistic on the '
eve of Stanford's first cage game of !
the season in the pavilion. If the i
Cardinals are "right," as they were in 1
that last half of the Long Beach game, I
Stanford will in all probability be re- j
turned victorious tonight, otherwise
the game will be at best an even break.

Anderson to Start
As his starting lineup tonight Coach
Hunt will probably use Captain David
and McCandless at forwards, Ander
son at standing guard, Biaggini at
running guard, and Jayred at center.
Bryant may start at forward while
On the Branch team, Ketclium and
Vincenti may be a starter at standing
guard.
Armstrong are slated as the main cogs
of Coach Paddy Works' live. Roth are
veterans, ably seconded by a set of
relatively inexperienced but capable
players.
Despite the early stage of the sea- 1
son, Hunt has developed a team from
! his squad of sixteen players which
compares favorably with the early ap
pearance of former Cardinal fives.
Stanford's ability to stage brilliant,
telling comebacks has characterized
the play during the southern tour.
In the second half of the game with
the Pacific Club of Long Reach, Hunt's
men, though nosed out by one point,
ran up 22 points "to their opponents'
10. That, against a crack athletic club
team, denotes potential power which
may be converted into victories as the I
season progresses.
The Branch game, coming at the ;
time it does, catches Stanford at a \
bad time. The team practiced last j
night in the pavilion after a lay-off
caused by the team's seeing the Stan- 1
ford-Alabama football game and not;
returning until yesterday morning.
However, Hunt is optimistic on the '
eve of Stanford's first cage game of !
the season in the pavilion. If the i
Cardinals are "right," as they were in 1
that last half of the Long Beach game, I
Stanford will in all probability be re- j
turned victorious tonight, otherwise
the game will be at best an even break.
