# PENDRAGON PLAYERS OFFER PERFORMANCE OF 'THE GUARDSMAN'
## 
### 
Combining every known type oC
comedy relief in three acts of merri
ment, "The Guardsman," by Franz
Molnar, to be produced by the Palo
Alto Pendragon Players Wednesday,
January 5, and Saturday, January 8,
at the Palo Alto Women's Clubhouse,
promises hilarious entertainment to
the playgoer, according to Margaret
Kisich, director.
Garth Winslow, prominent in cam
pus dramatics, and several Stanford
graduates are featured in the cast
producing this scintillating comedy of
situation. Graduates include Mrs.
Kisich, director, Oliver Kisich, and
Charles Brown.
It is said that Molnar has written
"The Guardsman" around several in
cidents in his own life, and that The
Critic, played by Brown, is Molnar
himself. He merely sits on the side
lines and offers entangling and farcical
comment on the situations developed.
The plot revolves around the dual
personality of the Guardsman and the
: husband, both played by Oliver Kisich.
Hailed as the best of the year's
comedies by New York critics and
recognized as among the finest of Mol
nar's witty sallies at the expense of
institutions of common life, the pro
duction is a premier on the Pacific
i Coast. It follows a more serious offer
ing by the same author, "Liliom."
Tickets may be obtained at Cran
dall's for either performance.
