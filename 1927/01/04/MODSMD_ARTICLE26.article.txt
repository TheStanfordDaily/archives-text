# Congratulations

With Stanford just as close to the championship of the world as she
has ever been, and with more and better seats available at all the varsity
games than in any previous year, there is, nevertheless, a great hue and
cry going abroad in complaint against the manner in which the athletic
situation in general, and the ticket question in particular, are handled.
Since whatever criticism is heard seems to center about the New
Year's Day game, let us pause a moment and dwell upon that affair. The
problem that faced the ticket department before that game may be com
pared to the difficulties involved in an attempt to seat fifteen people in
a Ford roadster. The Rose Bowl will accommodate about 58,000 persons.
Something like two or three times that number applied for seats. Natu
rally enough, since neither A 1 Masters, Ed Loder, nor Pete Anderson are
conjurers, many were disappointed.
There is another angle to the matter that has been generally over
looked. The ticket department made a conscientious effort to distribute
tickets to people who were closely associated with one of the two uni
versities participating in the game. In other words, the tickets were
supposed to go to those applicants who might reasonably be presumed to
be interested in the game, and entitled to watch it. Most of these
people appreciated the opportunity offered them. There was a consider
able number, however, who abused their privileges and greatly compli
cated the situation by allowing their tickets to fall into the hands of
speculators.
In spite of numerous obstacles in its path, the Ticket Department
managed to distribute the tickets with a reasonable degree of fairness to
all parties concerned. Furthermore, eVeryone who had a ticket and was
able to navigate on New Year's Day got his seat. This is just one way of
saying that the entire matter was handled with a high degree of efficiency.
The Daily is inclined to the belief that A 1 Masters, Pete Anderson, and
the two thousand odd employees who assisted in handling the large crowd
deserve a round of congratulations.
