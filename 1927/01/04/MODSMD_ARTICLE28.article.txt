"The Wishing Carpet." Ruth Comfort
Mitchell. Appleton Co. $2.00.
Mediocre is the only term which
seems to describe adequately that class
of novel under which Ruoth Comfort
Mitchell's latest work falls. "The
Wishing Carpet" is not bad, but out
standing characteristics of any sort
are completely larking, and the only
thing that might be said in its favor is
that, the author has avoided the
strained effect produced by many mod
ern writers in their efforts to be strik
ingly original, and, if possible, shock
ing. Mrs. Mitchell's book betrays no
such attempt.
The plot of "The Wishing Carpet"
revolves around Glen narrow, the
typical, genuine, honest, high-spirited
girl with red hair. Her father is a
doctor, the kind but blustering sort,
who, unlike his sentimental and pa
thetically refined wife, sniffs at the
social position and teachos Glen to
scorn the snubs she receives as a re
sult of her mother's attempts to put
her in what she considers her daugh
ter's proper social strata.
Romance is provided by Luke Man
ders, a tall and handsome "diamond in
the rough" who literally blows In from
the Tennessee mountains. Sponsored
by Dr. Harrow, he gets over his taste
for fueds and proves extraordinarily
capable and brilliant, so much so, in
fact, that Dr. Harrow highly approves
of him as a match for Glen, who also
admires the "golden lad" of tho moun
tains. Manders becomes tho efficient

manager of a Tennessee mill, and Glen,
|as his secretary, takes on an ardent
! enthusiasm for reforming labor con
ditions. In the course of events, the
! glamour surrounding the "golden lad"
wears off; Glen finds she doesn't love
! him after all, and is finally won by
Peter Parker, the owner of the mill,
who has lived a life of luxury in Pasa
dena and upon whom Glen previously
poured her reformer's wrath. (First,
though, he proved himself a "man"
by carrying; an ignited bomb out of the
mill, and other feats.) Glen's influence
reforms Peter as well as the mill, and
everything ends happily in a l.;st em
brace on the "wishing carpet," a Per
sian rug, which is incidentally useful
throughout the book, both to the char
actors and the reader —every time
somebody stands on it and wishes, he
gets his wish, thereby enabling the
reader to determine with accuracy just
| what is going to happen next and
eliminating all unnecessary worry.
The characters are not badly done,
but most of them are made uninterest
ing because of their similarity to al
ready familiar novel types. As a
whole, considered in an uncritical
mood, the book is fairly readable; It
j would seem more at home, however,
had it appeared in serial form in The
! Ladies' Home Journal. —J. P.

seems to describe adequately that class
of novel under which Ruoth Comfort
Mitchell's latest work falls. "The
Wishing Carpet" is not bad, but out
standing characteristics of any sort
are completely larking, and the only
thing that might be said in its favor is
that, the author has avoided the
strained effect produced by many mod
ern writers in their efforts to be strik
ingly original, and, if possible, shock
ing. Mrs. Mitchell's book betrays no
such attempt.
The plot of "The Wishing Carpet"
revolves around Glen narrow, the
typical, genuine, honest, high-spirited
girl with red hair. Her father is a
doctor, the kind but blustering sort,
who, unlike his sentimental and pa
thetically refined wife, sniffs at the
social position and teachos Glen to
scorn the snubs she receives as a re
sult of her mother's attempts to put
her in what she considers her daugh
ter's proper social strata.
Romance is provided by Luke Man
ders, a tall and handsome "diamond in
the rough" who literally blows In from
the Tennessee mountains. Sponsored
by Dr. Harrow, he gets over his taste
for fueds and proves extraordinarily
capable and brilliant, so much so, in
fact, that Dr. Harrow highly approves
of him as a match for Glen, who also
admires the "golden lad" of tho moun
tains. Manders becomes tho efficient

manager of a Tennessee mill, and Glen,
|as his secretary, takes on an ardent
! enthusiasm for reforming labor con
ditions. In the course of events, the
! glamour surrounding the "golden lad"
wears off; Glen finds she doesn't love
! him after all, and is finally won by
Peter Parker, the owner of the mill,
who has lived a life of luxury in Pasa
dena and upon whom Glen previously
poured her reformer's wrath. (First,
though, he proved himself a "man"
by carrying; an ignited bomb out of the
mill, and other feats.) Glen's influence
reforms Peter as well as the mill, and
everything ends happily in a l.;st em
brace on the "wishing carpet," a Per
sian rug, which is incidentally useful
throughout the book, both to the char
actors and the reader —every time
somebody stands on it and wishes, he
gets his wish, thereby enabling the
reader to determine with accuracy just
| what is going to happen next and
eliminating all unnecessary worry.
The characters are not badly done,
but most of them are made uninterest
ing because of their similarity to al
ready familiar novel types. As a
whole, considered in an uncritical
mood, the book is fairly readable; It
j would seem more at home, however,
had it appeared in serial form in The
! Ladies' Home Journal. —J. P.
