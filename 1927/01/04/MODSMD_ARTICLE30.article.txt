In today's Daily is an article containing
the information that among the inmates
of the New York state prison—known
to its habitues as "Warble Twice, on the
Hudson"—there are sixty-seven college
grauates.
Why is this? Can it he possible that
our expensive and elaborate educational in
stitutions are failing to inculcate a proper
conception of m >ral values in the minds
of the students who attend them? Is it
true that the great American universities
are sending men into the world with no
sense of social responsibility, with no
ideals? Or may this regrettable condition
be traced to an earnest attempt upon the
part of college men .to find a place that
seems like home after four years in dor
mitories and fraternity houses?

Possibly we imagined it, but it seemed
to us on New Year's Day that there
was something lacking at that football
game. The team was there. The rooters
were there. And "a large and colorful
crowd" was in evidence. Still, there was
something lacking. We did not feel, be

fore the game, that sense of an impend
ing and important conflict. We felt, rath
er, that a couple of college football teams
were about to go through the motions of
! playing a game in order that the crowd
might be properly entertained and in order
that the Pasadena real estate market
. | might benefit from the effects of su
gratifying a spectacle.
i | Our impression of the entire affair was
J not helped when a notorious motion pic
ture actress was escortcd to mid-field to
i present the two captains with floral pieces
> i which bore a close resemblance to the
i j type one sees at funerals. Nor were we
■ inclined to look at the thing in a more
optimistic light when we were informed,
later on, that the gentleman who reported
i the game over the radio included in his
dissertation a vivid description pi the
I beauty of the Pasadena Hills.
In short, the day was utterly ruined
I ; for us by the unpleasant feeling that the
; Stanford varsity and student body were
Mm an undignified position, comparable
; j to that occupied by a grass skirt artist
j imported to put over an Elks' banquet.
