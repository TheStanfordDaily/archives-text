# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### —By The King— 
Somebody should have informed the j
unsuspecting public before this that
Cabbages isn't supposed to be always
funny. Being funny more than once a'i
week would get us kicked out of the '
colyumists' union.
Our secret ambition before we got j
so used to college was to be intelligent
—not too intelligent, you know, but
just enough to be able to snicker at
the dumbness of humanity in general
without offending the frat brothers.
And then alonp: came Bull Sessions i
and wanted to be intelligent, too. It i
seems like everybody's picking on us. i
To print two ideas worthy of an adult
mind in the same college paper would
offend the most sacred traditions.
Moreover, people would stop reading
the editorials.
So we'll have to be our own inno
cent, trusting selves, believe every
thing we see in the papers, make our
little wise cracks while we may, be- j
cause tomorrow we may know better, j
