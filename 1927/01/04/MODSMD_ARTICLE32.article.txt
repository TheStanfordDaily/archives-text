The Editor, Sir:
That there is a definite need for
widespread contact between Graduate
students at Stanford is no doubt evi
dent to anyone familiar with the pres
ent status of the Graduate School. This
need is experienced particularly by ad
vanced students coming from other in
stitutions, for the men and women who
have taken their undergraduate work
here and then gone on for additional
study have their professional and so
cial contacts well established.
There are, of e<*urse, departmental
groups functioning, but these are by
no means adequate, for a strong spirit
of interdepartmental co-operation can
and should be built up. Certainly a

graduate student in Biology, for exam
ple, ought to know what sort of re
search is being done in Medicine,
Chemistry, Psysics, or in Geology, and
so on, for the other departments of the
University.
The president of the Graduate Wo
men's Club and the Editor of the Daily
should be commended for bringing
this question of graduate organization ;
into the limelight. The graduate men |
are just as keenly interested in estab
lishing a Graduate Club as the women
are, for such a club can be made a
real force in building up graduate
"esprit de corps"—a thing decidedly
lacking at the present time.
