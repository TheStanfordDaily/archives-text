### 
College graduates arc not a burden on
society, said the Rev. William Oxlcy
Thompson, former president of Ohio
State University, in a recent interview
published m the Daily Princetonian.
Thompson is at present moderator of the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian
church.
He declared that in general college
graduates are self-supporting and self
satisfying. Dr. Thompson pointed out
that due to the policy of limited enroll
ment adopted by private institutions, the
state universities must fill the wholesale
demand for education. This increase in
the desire for college diplomas he ex
p.ains by the principle that education
begets education.
One of the dangers in the north lies
in the fact that colleges accept members
of the colored race, and then alter gradu
ation refuse to let them fill the positions
for which they have been trained. He
added, however, that it was a fallacy to
suppose that an educated nation cannot
take care of its own problems, and that
lie had never seen the time when edu
cation proved its own disaster.
