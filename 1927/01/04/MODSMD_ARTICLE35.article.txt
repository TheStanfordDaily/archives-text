# BOWERY DOPE FIENDS INCLUDE COLLEGE MEN
## 
### 
College graduates form a surprising
ly large element among the hundreds
of men who wander nightly into the
Bowery Y.M.C.A. in New York in
search of free food and shelter, re
ported Harry Haines, service secretary
of the organization.
Liquor and drug addiction are the
main causes of this degradation of col
lege men, he said. While excessive
drink claims its victims from the edu
cated and the ignorant without appar
ent discrimination, fully ten per cent
of the drug addicts are university
graduates.
College men, many of them doctors, i
form the drug habit through efforts to
stimulate jaded nerves, and are re
duced to poverty because of the ra
pacious demands of narcotic salesmen,
lie added.
