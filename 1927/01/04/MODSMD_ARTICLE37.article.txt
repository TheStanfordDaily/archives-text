# DUMBARTON BRIDGE OPENING SCHEDULED
## 
### 
Dumbarton Highway Bridge will
open on January 15 is the official state
ment made by John G. Sutton, secre
| tary and general manager of the
i bridge corporation last week. The ap
proaches to the bridge on either side
of the bay, he said, need intervals.of
three or four days of perfect weather
l
;in order to sufficiently settle, and
i make traffic over them comfortable,
so that continued rain would prevent
the opening on that date.
Sutton said that two major traffic
routes will naturally be served by the
bridge: traffic to and from the lower
San Francisco peninsula and points
north of San Jose and Oakland, Berke
ley, and Alameda, and traffic between
San Joaquin Valley and San Francisco,
a substantial proportion of which
i should be diverted at Livermore
I through the Niles Canyon gateway to
the Dumbarton Bridge.
Sutton anticipates that more than
: 25,000 autos and trucks will pass over
the span on the opening day alone.
