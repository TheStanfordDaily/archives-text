Fraternity men can be identified in
many of the Eastern institutions of
learning by looking at their hats. No
longer does one look for a demurely
secluded pin or vainly try to recollect
the memory of a long-forgotten visage.
All that is necessary is to catch a
glimpse of the hat-band of the person
under scrutiny.
Of course one has to remember that
Zeta Psi uses a band of wide white
and yellow stripes, that one red with
two yellow means Phi Sigma Kappa,
that two yellows and a white is the
undisputed property of Sigma Nu, that
Sigma Alpha Epsilon claims three
narrow lavender stripes and a wider
yellow one . . . et cetera, ad infinitum. ,
The hat-band situation is now be- !
coming acute, we discover, because of
the exhaustion of the spectrum. All
the fraternities and prominent campus I
clubs have patented (by gentlemen's j
agreement only) their chosen bands j
with leading manufacturers, there be- j
ing a matter of 100 or more varieties.
