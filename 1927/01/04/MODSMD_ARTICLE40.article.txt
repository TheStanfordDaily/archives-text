# FIRST CALL ISSUED FOR JUNIOR OPERA MANUSCRIPTS, MUSIC
## Subcommittees Appointed to Make Selections During Quarter 
### H. A. K 
Work will begin in earnest' upon
plans for the Junior Opera to be
given by the class of 1928 in the
spring. During this quarter it is ex
pected that both plot and music will
be decided upon so that there will be
ample time for casting and perfecting
the details of production before it is
due. The general committee is under
the chairmanship of Fenton Barrett
and from its members subcommittees
have been appointed for handling the
selection of manuscript, music, and
directors. A general call is being is
sued to all members of the student
body who have or suspect themselves
of having either literary or musical
ability.
R. Frank Raker is chairman of the
manuscript committee and will re
ceive all plot suggestions. According
to plans laid last quarter, the plot
should be one which will lend itself
to modern dress rather than one which
calls for costuming. However, costume
manuscripts are not barred from con
sideration. Further announcement will
be made later as to the form of manu
scripts which the committee desires. |
All present or prospective song
writers aro requested to get in touch j
with Herbert Klein, Box 1842. It will
be sufficient for the purposes of the 1
music committee that the melody !
alone be submitted. A catchy tune or
attractive rhythm will be enough;
harmony and words will be taken
care of. Lyric writers will have their
opportunity when melodies have been
chosen and words will be needed. The
only requirements for musical offer
ings are originality and attractive
melody.
