Sixty-seven inmates of Sing Sing j
prison at Qssining, New York, have j
college degrees, according to a report j
recently made by Warden L. E. Lawes j
of the penitentiary.
He further found that out of the |
1452 prisoners, nearly one-half of
them, 707, had received education up
to the sixth grade. Contrary to gen
eral belief, most of the prisoners are
native, only eighteen out of the entire
penitentiary being born out of the
country, and only seven being for
eigners.
His research shows that an increas
ing number of convicts have an educa
tion, as the number of college gradu
ates has increased from nineteen for
merly, to sixty-seven this past year.
The average age, which is twenty-eight |
now, is also much younger.
