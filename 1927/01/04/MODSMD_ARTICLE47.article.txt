# CAMPUS WOMEN ONCE NEARLY OUTNUMBERED MEN MRS. STANFORD PLACED LIMIT OF FIVE HUNDRED AVOIDED POSSIBILITY OF WOMEN'S SEMINARY
## 
### 
Everybody knows that there are onl>
live hundred women at Stanford, and
that there never have been and in all
probability never will be any more,
Hut when the curious freshman asks
just what is the significance of this
rather charmed number, he is greeted
with, "Why—well Mrs, Stanford
stipulated live hundred, and and
both the freshman and the informer
decide that some day they shall dis
cover the true facts.
"Five hundred girls and twenty-five
hundred men," says the high school
flapper. "Wouldn't that be sweet!"
Any possible sweetness in the situa
tion, however, entirely escaped the
founders of the University, for the
simple reason that a ratio of five to
one never entered their minds. During
one period of the early growth of
Stanford, after the death of Senator
Stanford, a series of litigations con
cerning the University made it neces
sary for many of the upperclassmen
to be asked to go elsewhere to com
plete their work —notably that in Law,
Medicine, and Engineering. The sub
jects chosen by upperclass women,
however, were well-handled, and so it
began to look as if the women would
outnumber the men. To avoid the pos
sibility of Stanford's becoming a wo
men's seminary, Mrs. Stanford stipu
lated, in 1899, that the number of wo
men attending the University should
at 110 time exceed five hundred.
It was not until 1902 that this quota
whs reached; and then began the de
velopment of the rigid system of ad

mitting women which has resulted in
; the cant phrase now used to comfort
the disappointed applicants: "Well,
1 cheer up! Just think! —for every one
I hey admitted, twenty—twenty!—were
turned down!"
Despite the fact that Stanford was
established equally for men and wo
men, however, men have from the be
ginning outnumbered the feminine
seekers of erudition. The original idea
of the founders was "not to admit the
young women until later." But Presi
dent Jordan thought that "they should
be present from the beginning, so that
their admittance might not appear in
any sense an afterthought, or their
relation as an 'annex'." Ye Five-hun
dred, no afterthought are ye!
The record of the first registration
shows that there were almost three
men to every woman —417 to 142. From
then until 1902 when the set number
was first reached, the ratio varied be
tween 3-1 and 2-1. The rise in the
masculine stock on the campus has
been steady rather than spectacular.
The "sweet" five-to-one ratio was not
built in a day. It is not the result of
idea 011 the part of the Stanfords
that only a fifth of as many women as
men should be given the higher educa
tion offered here. But the fixity of the
number of the "500," and the steady
growth in the presence of the opposite
sex is making the the women a scarcer
and scarcer article on the Stanford
campus. In this the scarcity that
launched a thousand applications! But
of course Stanford women do not see
with the eyes of a high-school flapper!

The "sweet" five-to-one ratio was not
built in a day. It is not the result of
idea 011 the part of the Stanfords
that only a fifth of as many women as
men should be given the higher educa
tion offered here. But the fixity of the
number of the "500," and the steady
growth in the presence of the opposite
sex is making the the women a scarcer
and scarcer article on the Stanford
campus. In this the scarcity that
launched a thousand applications! But
of course Stanford women do not see
with the eyes of a high-school flapper!
Everybody knows that there are onl>
live hundred women at Stanford, and
that there never have been and in all
probability never will be any more,
Hut when the curious freshman asks
just what is the significance of this
rather charmed number, he is greeted
with, "Why—well Mrs, Stanford
stipulated live hundred, and and
both the freshman and the informer
decide that some day they shall dis
cover the true facts.
"Five hundred girls and twenty-five
hundred men," says the high school
flapper. "Wouldn't that be sweet!"
Any possible sweetness in the situa
tion, however, entirely escaped the
founders of the University, for the
simple reason that a ratio of five to
one never entered their minds. During
one period of the early growth of
Stanford, after the death of Senator
Stanford, a series of litigations con
cerning the University made it neces
sary for many of the upperclassmen
to be asked to go elsewhere to com
plete their work —notably that in Law,
Medicine, and Engineering. The sub
jects chosen by upperclass women,
however, were well-handled, and so it
began to look as if the women would
outnumber the men. To avoid the pos
sibility of Stanford's becoming a wo
men's seminary, Mrs. Stanford stipu
lated, in 1899, that the number of wo
men attending the University should
at 110 time exceed five hundred.
It was not until 1902 that this quota
whs reached; and then began the de
velopment of the rigid system of ad

mitting women which has resulted in
; the cant phrase now used to comfort
the disappointed applicants: "Well,
1 cheer up! Just think! —for every one
I hey admitted, twenty—twenty!—were
turned down!"
Despite the fact that Stanford was
established equally for men and wo
men, however, men have from the be
ginning outnumbered the feminine
seekers of erudition. The original idea
of the founders was "not to admit the
young women until later." But Presi
dent Jordan thought that "they should
be present from the beginning, so that
their admittance might not appear in
any sense an afterthought, or their
relation as an 'annex'." Ye Five-hun
dred, no afterthought are ye!
The record of the first registration
shows that there were almost three
men to every woman —417 to 142. From
then until 1902 when the set number
was first reached, the ratio varied be
tween 3-1 and 2-1. The rise in the
masculine stock on the campus has
been steady rather than spectacular.
