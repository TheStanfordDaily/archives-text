# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Tomorrow and the two succeeding j
days will find Willie Hoppe very much
in the limelight again. Of course, that j
is not an unusual place to find Willie, i
for it seems that he has been occupy-'
ing the calcimine almost since the '
time of William the Conquerer. To be j
exact, Willie Hoppe, "the boy wonder,"
is about to try to regain the 18:2 balk- j
line billiard honors which he lost in
1925, after holding them for a con
tinuous stretch of seventeen years, ex
cept for one brief interruption. Hoppe
meets Eric Hagenlacher, of Germany,
the world's champion, at the Pennsyl
vania Hotel in New York City, in a
1,500 point match on' January 5, 6, and
7.
Let me refresh your mind a bit on
the recent history of the 18:2 billiard
crown, which for so long adorned the
brow of the redoubtable Willie. Hoppe
lost his title in March, 1925, to Jake
Schaefer, the man who had taken away
the title temporarily,' a few years be-!
fore. In December of the same year. '
Edouard Horemans, of Belgium, won
the championship from Schaefer, only
to lose it back to the same player in
the following month. Then at Phila-!

delphia, in March of last year, Eric
Hagenlacher won the crown that he
now wears so jauntily by beating
Schaefer 1,500 to 1,344.
Hoppe, you know, began playing bil
liards when he was five years old. His
father taught him not to missâ€”by
knocking him sprawling when he did
miss. When Willie was eighteen, he
won his first world's title by defeating
the ancient Maurice Vigneaux, of
France, at 18:1 balk-line billiards. To
show how long ago that was, I need
only say that Bill Clothier was the
United States tennis champion that
year, and Gertrude Ederele wasn't
even born! Hoppe lost the 18:1 title
to Schaefer last April in New York.
The 18:2 crown first came into his
possession in 1908.
And now Willie Hoppe wants to
rule the green baize once more, and
when Willie wants a thing badly
enough he usually gets it. When you
consider that there are over three and
a half million billiard players in the
United States alone (and more than
two billiard tables to every baseball
fan!) the title of "champion of the
world" means something in this game!
Go get 'em, Willie!
