# NOTRE DAME TO HAVE MODERN DINING HALL
## 
### 
Plans are under way for the building
of a huge dining hall for Notre Dame
University, accommodating more than
2,000 students. In exterior dimensions the
building will be 232 by 205 feet. The
rooms will be 220 by 62 feet and 30 feet
high. The floors will be tile and the
walls covered with sound-deadening plas
ter. At each end of the rooms will be
huge fireplaces.
The kitchens of the new dining hall
will be the most modernly equipped in
the middle west, with everything elec
trically operated. White glazed tile will
be used on the floor. A large monilar
roof will provide light and ventilation for
the kitchens.
