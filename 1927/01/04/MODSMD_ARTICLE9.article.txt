# IMPROVEMENTS ON UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS NEARING COMPLETION
## New Steel Stacks Installed In Law Library Building 
### 
University buildings have under
gone sundry improvements during the
recent vacation period, and the aero
dynamics laboratory and new quarters
for the forge, foundry, and machine
shop are rapidly nearing completion.
New steel stacks have been installed
in the Law Library building, replacing
the old wooden shelves and practically
doubling the shelving space. Arranged !
on two floor levels, instead of with j
single stacks as formerly, the new
shelves will enable the Law School to
concentrate its books and thus make
them available for consultation
promptly instead of having them scat
tered in various rooms and in other
buildings, as has been necessary re
cently. In addition the steel stacks will
considerably reduce the fire risk dor
mant in the old wooden shelves.
The room in the building in the
southwest corner of the Inner Quad
used for practice by musical organiza
tions has been enlarged by the elimina
tion of partition walls which formerly
separated it from adjoining passage
ways to other rooms in the building.
As a precautionary safety measure,
the plaster ceiling of the Assembly
Hall is being taken down. During the
holidays a patch of this plaster fell,
so it was decided to remove the re
mainder. No attempt will be made to
restore this plaster until next summer,
when It is possible that the whole
ceiling construction will be re
designed.
Work is progressing on the aero
dynamics laboratory and office build
ing and on the new quarters of the
forge, foundry, and machine shop. In
the latter building a new concrete floor
has been laid and tho structure is
about ready for the installation of
the equipment.
Tho offices of the aerodynamics
buildings are practically finished and
will be ready for occupancy soon. In
the laboratory end of the building,
work has reached the point where tho
installation of the gallery designed to
circle the laboratory at the ground
level will be begun immediately. As
soon as a concrete floor is laid on the
lower level, work will be begun on the
wind tunnel.
In the neighborhood of the Corpora
tion Yard, conduits for electric wires
have been laid during the vacation, as
a start towards oventuolly getting
present overh<*ad wires under ground.
