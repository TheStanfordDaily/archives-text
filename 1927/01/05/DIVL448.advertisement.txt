The stag at eve
THIS fellow missed out on a heavy date tonight
by the close margin of one phone-call. But
don't waste pity on him. He has his jimmy
pipe and a tidy red tin of Prince Albert . • •
grand little pals in time of stress.
When that cool, comforting smoke comes
curling up the pipe-stem, troubles evanesce with
every puff. For P. A. is The National Joy
Smoke in fact as well as phrase. Cool as a tidy red tins, pound and half
pound tin humidori, and
money-lender. Sweet as a check from home. t°"h d , P e JZgf.'moV't
And atwayt with every bit
Fragrant as a pine-grove on a damp morning. % t bii P ' r^e p Tib, T 't m^et*,.
You'll like Prince Albert better than any
other tobacco you ever packed into a pipe.
You'll like the friendly way it treats your tongue
and throat. You'lllike the way it helps you over
the rough spots. Buy a tidy red tin today and see! 11
