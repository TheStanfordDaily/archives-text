# ACHIEVEMENTS OF CANADA, U.S. NOTABLE--BOGGS
## Each Nation Misinformed As to Real State of Affairs in Other COMPARES COUNTRIES International Amity Called Basis of World Ideal Of North America 
### 
"Canada and the United States have
made a significant achievement in world
affairs. Their joint accomplishment in
proving the practicability of international
amity over a 4000-mile boundary for
more than 100 years may be called the
foundation of 'North America s world
idea.'"
With this statement Professor Theo
dore H. Boggs summed up his lecture
on "The United States and Canada,"
which he delivered last evening in the
Little Theatre. In his talk he stressed
particularly the similarities and differ
ences found between the two countries at
the present time.
Each Misinformed
"One characteristic of both countries,"
said Professor Boggs, "is the ignorance
of the real state of affairs in the other
country. Canadians for the most part
think of California as being exclusively
inhabited by millionaires, movie stars
and evangelists, while Americans are
surprised if they don't find Canada's pop
ulation made up of trappers, Eskimos,
Frenchmen, and rum-runners. On the
contrary, Canadians are a great deal like
Americans in their dress, characteristics,
and even in their having no established
church."
In speaking of tariff policies of each
country Professor Boggs pointed out that
there have been tariff bickerings on
both sides of the boundary with conse
quent retardation of trade development
between the two nations; protection has
been accepted as their policy.
Labor Stimulant
Labor has developed along much the
same lines in Canada as in America; in
fact, the Canadian organization has been
called the sister of the American Federa
tion of Labor, although the actual labor
laws have come from the mother country.
The two countries differ, however, as
Professor Boggs pointed out, in regard
to their political status, for Canada has
a system of fullest self-government.
The relative national prosperity of Amer
ica has developed before that of Canada
because of the more equable climate, with
its consequent attraction for immigrants.
This condition has changed since 1900
bccause of the lack of virgin land in the
United States, and also the lack of eco
nomic advantages which followed on the
development of industrialism in Amer
ica, causing more immigration to Can
ada, which is now developing rapidly in
several different phases of expansion.
Both Aid Democracy
Speaking of the contributions each
country has made to the world's prog
ress, Professor Boggs said that both arc
concerned with democracy. The United
States contributed the Declaration of
Independence, stating that the authority
of government among free peoples is
based on consent of the governed, and
Canada proved to the world that a de
pendency can rise to the position of a
nation without sacrifice of national
affiliations.
