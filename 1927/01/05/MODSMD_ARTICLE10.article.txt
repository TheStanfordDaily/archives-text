# COMIC SUPPLEMENTS UNJUST TO STUDENT SAYS U.C. PROFESSOR
## 
### 
Hollow-chested caricatures of college
men with bulging foreheads may be all
right in comic supplements but the pic
ture is all wrong in real life. Proof
of this has just been offered by Pro
fessor Frank Kleebcrger, head of the
Men's Physical Education Department of
the University of California, who has
spent eleven years gathering data on the
college man's physique, and almost two
years analyzing the information ob
tained.
According to his study, the average
student of the University of California
is five feet, nine inches tall, he weighs
140 pounds and has a lung capacity of
262 inches. Further than that, the di
rector of physical education can also list
the athletic performance of which this
"average" man is capable. He is able to:
Run the hundred yard dash in tennis
shoes in 12.5 seconds; broad jump in
tennis shoes 189 inches; hand or fence
vault 56 inches; scale a 12-foot wall in
11 seconds; and dive head first over an
obstacle 41 inches high. In swimming lie
should be able to swim 25 yards free
style in 16seconds; carry another
through the water with any "rescue" hold
for yards; swim a distance of 125
yards; have command of about four
strokes; and also to make one good
dive. In addition he should be able to
defend himself creditably in boxing or
wrestling.
