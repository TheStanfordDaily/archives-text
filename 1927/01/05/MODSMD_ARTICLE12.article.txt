### 
Members of the student body
enjoyed rides to and from Palo
Alto on a large and modern in
terurban car at no increase in
rates yesterday morning after the
regular Toonerville on the run
suffered a breakdown.
Some inconvenience was caused
to students returning fom the
show in Palo Alto Monday night,
however, when the disabled car
refused to be moved after getting
half way around the corner lead
ing to the car barns and blocked
the line so that the track to the
depot could not be used.
The new vehicle was reported
traveling the Stanford-Palo Alto
tracks late yesterday, while the
speed, appearance, and compara
tive silence of the conveyance
indicated at least a temporary
betterment in local transporta
tion facilities.
