# CARDINAL HOOPSTERS DOWNED BY SOUTHERN BRANCH, 21-17
## Bruins Accurate Passing Proves Too Much For Redshirts GAME STARTS SLOWLY Williams, Armstrong Star For Los Angeles Cage Five 
### Fred Speers 
A little too much Williams, a little
more Armstrong, and a lot of accurate
passing proved too much for Stanford's
basketball varsity last night in the
pavilion when the Southern Branch
took the Cardinals' measure, 21 points
to 17. Stanford led at half time, 9 to 8,
but could not keep up the scoring pace
set by the Bruin aces.
Many Chances Lost
Starting slowly, both teams muffed
frequent chances to score as the game
opened. Coach Work's men took their
time in sounding out. Hunt's defense
which, with a last-minute change, put
Biaggini at running guard and Ander
son at standing guard.
Anderson opened the scoring by
sinking a foul, and both teams, playing
in swifter fashion, put the scoring by
sinking a foul, and both teams, playing
in swifter fashion, put the scoring at
a 4-4 tie, which Bryant broke with a
free throw. Here Ketchum, Branch
forward, sneaked in a field goal.
Cards Lead at Half
The Bruins, using an effective,
rapid, short passing game were not
able in the first half to establish more
than a single point lead. Hunt's Cardi
nals kept alternately the lead through
telling playing on the part of David
and McCandless. Shortly before the
close of the first half, Stanford led,
9 to 6, but a short shot from Young
brought the Bruin score to 8 just be
fore the pistol sounded.
In the first few minutes of play in
the second half, McCandless and
Jayred showed flashes of ability in
slipping through the Southern defense
time and again. Two examples of
strong guarding were dished up to the
spectators last night as Anderson and
Armstrong repeatedly broke up short
shots under their respective baskets.
A 1 Biaggini played a consistent cool
game for the Cardinals. He is a hard
man to get past as five Branch play
ers learned last night. Captain Nelson
David figured prominently in the Stan
ford rally during the second half, sink
ing two field goals at crucial times.
Branch Sets Fast Pace
The Branch, playing without any
substitutions, set a pace that the Cardi
nals approached at times but not con
sistently enough to threaten Works'
men. Of the Southerners' 21 points
Ketchum and Williams each scored
seven. Williams' playing in particular
stood out as an excellent example of
superb floorwork and shooting that
baseball team: "If the coach recom
mends it, it's alright. It is especially
adapted for the state of affairs this
year."
Babcock Favors Plan
Lawrence Babcock, captain of the
1927 track team: "If Warner thinks
it's a pood plan, it must be good. 'Pop'
must have excellent reasons for the 1
change. This year in particular, with
conditions as they are, the plan is
good. Whoever makes the best show
ing next year will make the be3t cap
tain."
Cranston Holman, captain of the
tennis team: "Since therÂ» seems to be
no outstanding player or natural
leader among the eligible men this
year, it probably is better to postpone
the selection of the captain until after'
the first conference game next fall. By!
that time some man by his play should j
merit the honor.
"As a general rule I think this new:
plan would be unsatisfactory as it,
places a premium upon individual
brilliance in early season, weakening'
teamwork, and puts players who get;
started slowly in the season at an un-|
fortunate disadvantage."
