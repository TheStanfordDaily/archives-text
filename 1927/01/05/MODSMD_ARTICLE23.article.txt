# What! No Grid Captain?
## 
### 
It was rumored last week that Stanford would not elect a grid cap
tian until next fall, and yesterday Coach 'Pop" Warner verified the
report. The football leader will be chosen after the University of
Southern California contest which takes place on the second Saturday
of October. The reason given for this action, as offered by Warner,
was that it was for the best interests of the 1927 team, and for the
University as a whole.
Electing* a man at the end of the season is often only a compliment
to the player for his good work during the past season. The next year
the captain-elect may be off-form, and perhaps not even rate the first
eleven. And then again even captains are known to have flunked out
before the season rolled around. Other leaders have failed to return
because of various troubles. To avoid all these possible difficulties
Warner is trying this new plan, and it deserves, at least, a fair trial.
At the close of each track season at Stanford the most valuable man
on the squad during the past season is awarded The Aupperle Medal.
This distinction is a real tribute to the star of the team, and is sought
and treasured by all the track athletes. Some similar trophy might be
given to the stellar football player at the close of the grid year. A
medal, a cup, or other type of trophy could be kept by the star, and
it would have real significance to him. lie would have something to
show to his grandchildren besides.
The outstanding point about this year's football varsity was that
it was a team made up of eleven good players, but no real stars. To
pick a captain for next year would be a difficult task. The members
of the team approve of Pop's suggestion, and this fact alone "should
be enough to satisfy us.
"Pop" Warner wants the captain elected next fall. The 1926 varsity
approves. Who else should have anything to say about it?
