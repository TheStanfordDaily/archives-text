The editorial gem reprinted below was clipped from the recent Bur
lesque Issue of the Big Ten Weekly and follows without comment.
It is entitled "Liquor and Football":
"Educators in many parts of the country seem a bit alarmed over
the prevalent custom of carrying a nip or two of fuel on the hip at
football games. This happy practice of combining social duties with
sports seems to be unpopular with certain faculty spokesmen. Perhaps
there is something to be said on both sides of the case.
"To the 1 '»ig Ten Weekly the serious part of .the question is not that
our alumni and students are drinking a bit before, during, and after
football games, but that they are not drinking enough. The trouble is
that there are too many at the games who are sober.
"What a fine thing it would be if every alumnus who went to a
game had to be carried to his seat 'stiff' and carried out again after
the game was over. Think how little crabbing there would be about
who won or lost the game. Many a coach has lost his job because some
of the alumni were sober enough to see that his men didn't know much
about football. If they had partaken of enough liquor to be perfectly
rigid they wouldn't know that their alma mater was being beaten,
let alone that the coach didn't know his oats.
"Still another feature of the problem is the matter of cheering. *Jf
the alumni and students all went to the game blind and unconscious,
there would be no need of cheerleaders. Think what that would mean
for football!
"The most dangerous part of football is that the spectators may
suffer from exposure in the cold. If every alumnus had a quart of
good stuff under his belt, he wouldn't even feel the cold.
"And it would even be a good idea to keep the ushers a bit squiffy.
As it is now, nobody sits in the scat his ticket calls for. ]112 the ushers
were in such shape that they didn't know just what they were doing,
simply by the law of averages some of the folks would be laid out in
the proper seats.
"More drinking, greater efficiency in getting into the proper con
dition for a game, and more thoroughness in preparing for those cold
November afternoons, as the Big Ten Weekly sees it, is the big prob
lem that must l>e solved before football is on the plane that it should be."

that there are too many at the games who are sober.
"What a fine thing it would be if every alumnus who went to a
game had to be carried to his seat 'stiff' and carried out again after
the game was over. Think how little crabbing there would be about
who won or lost the game. Many a coach has lost his job because some
of the alumni were sober enough to see that his men didn't know much
about football. If they had partaken of enough liquor to be perfectly
rigid they wouldn't know that their alma mater was being beaten,
let alone that the coach didn't know his oats.
"Still another feature of the problem is the matter of cheering. *Jf
the alumni and students all went to the game blind and unconscious,
there would be no need of cheerleaders. Think what that would mean
for football!
"The most dangerous part of football is that the spectators may
suffer from exposure in the cold. If every alumnus had a quart of
good stuff under his belt, he wouldn't even feel the cold.
"And it would even be a good idea to keep the ushers a bit squiffy.
As it is now, nobody sits in the scat his ticket calls for. ]112 the ushers
were in such shape that they didn't know just what they were doing,
simply by the law of averages some of the folks would be laid out in
the proper seats.
"More drinking, greater efficiency in getting into the proper con
dition for a game, and more thoroughness in preparing for those cold
November afternoons, as the Big Ten Weekly sees it, is the big prob
lem that must l>e solved before football is on the plane that it should be."
