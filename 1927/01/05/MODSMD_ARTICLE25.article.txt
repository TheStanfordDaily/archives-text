Elsewhere 011 tliis page appears the
effusion of the Santa Clara County
Women's Christian Temperance Union
upon reading the editorial comment that
accompanied the decidedly wet vote
polled on the campus last quarter. At
the risk of being accused of malicious
and libellous punning, the ladies have
taken occasion to tell us that we have
a "wet" policy.
It is indeed sad to think that, at our
tender age, the entire W.C.T.U. of Santa
Clara County should be arrayed against
us, every woman striking the attitude
militant. It is going to work a great
personal hardship upon us. Henceforth,
it would seem, we are to be deprived
of the sympathy, understanding, and
companionship of all temperate, Chris-

tian women, barring the remote possi
bility that we go out of Santa Clara
County in search of any.
—Alackaday. Think of the Wednes
day afternoons we shall be forced to
spend at home.

As regards the matter of selecting
All-Star Football teams. After expend
ing a tremendous amount of mental en
ergy on the problem, we believe that we
are at last ready to offer the public an
answer to the pressing quesion of why
these aggregations are called All-Ameri
can. It is probably because the nation
ality of the players is the only feature
that can be predicted with any degree
of accuracy. Only Americans play the
game.
