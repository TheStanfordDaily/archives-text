PARENTHESES:
A little drama in which they indi
cate the words which are thought but
not spoken.
Scene: 4 p.m. Registration Day,
main floor Administration building.
Gushing co-ed: "Oh, Professor Blah,
may I enroll for this course? I so
much enjoyed your lectures last se
mester! (He's still got that good-look
ing corrector who's been coming up
to the house so much. This ought to
be good for a B without too much
effort.)
Professor Blah: "Sign here." (I do
wish these conceited little stuffed
dresses would forget a few minutes
(hat they happen to be feminine and
use their brains instead of their eyes.),
A Perennial: "Well, will you give me
another try at that course? I think
that with harder study I can pass it."
(Y'u big cheese, you know I have to
have it for a required and if I didn't
I wouldn't come within a mile of
your department. Why couldn't you
be decent and let me by last semes
ter?)
Professor: "Sign here." (Dumb; ab
solutely hopeless. He's as good as
flunked again right now.)
Next Student: "May I sign up? This
makes my third course under you in
the last year. Getting a fnajor in the
department."
Professor: "Sign here." (Now there's
a fine type of student. Interested but

| not trying to beat the game like so
j many of them.)
Student: (He's a long-winded egg,
■ but I guess I can stand him again. By
using a little headwork and not being
too crude I can get whatever advan-;
tage there is in having him friendly |
and his class is as good as any other
to rest in during that hour before;
lunch. Now for another soft one and
a couple of pipes.)

goes, but pretty tame compared to
