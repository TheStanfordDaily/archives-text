The Hard Boiled Virgin, by Frances
Newman. Boni and Liveright, $2.50.
Minor dcfects which it is impossible
to overlook, do not prevent Frances New
man's latest work from ranking as a re
markable and interesting character de
lineation. None the less, one cannot read
the book without ioeling that Miss New
man has deiiuneiy and quite needlessly
overstepped tlic uounds of good taste,
both in the content and construction of |
ner novel.
There is, for instance, absolutely no l
call for the irrelevant details which are j
brought in in discussing the death of j
George Faraday. Such content only gives :
the book a slignt.y erotic touch.
Such let-downs, however, do not pre-j
vent the book irom being unique as an I
artistic character skctch. The author j
understands her subjcct and has the fac
ulty of making her readers do so. Yet
in spite of the bitter understanding with
tviiien tiic boo „.iUen, tue cuaracter ]
of Mary Faiuuay is subjected to an l
analysis much like that which a pro-!
fessor would give an amoeba. The
reader feels no sympathy for the Hard
Boiled Virgin, but merely looks on, won-;
ders at the inexplicable nature of her
perfectly naliu i actions, and smiles—j
gnnny. ¥ I\ M.
