"The Miracle" is by far the most
stupendous production that has ever been
presented in San Francisco. From be
ginning to end the brilliancy of the cos
tuming and the pagentry make the per
formance worth seeing for the spectacle
itself.
The Civic Auditorium has been com
pletely transformed to represent the in
side of an old Rhineland cathedral. A
massive altar stands in the center of the
raised platform banked by great Gothic
candelabra. Two vari-colored glass win
dows Shove the altar allow light to filter
through with a soft beauty.
The lighting effects are excellent.
Throughout the whole performance the
light is dim as is that in the old cathed
rals of Europe. The audience itself
played a part in the spectacle, represent
ing a twelfth century congregation come
to witness a miracle and worship a Ma
donna.
Iris Tree as the Nun Megildis is a
graceful and beautiful figure to behold.
Elinor Patterson treats the part rather
as that of an automaton swayed here and
there by the will of Fate. However, this
is not so true of Miss Tree's work. She
gives herself to her part and renders it
in its full emotional value.
Lady Diana Manners as the Madonna
plays with a beauty and grace that might
be difficult to outdo. The halo of light
that constantly falls on her face makes
her appear truly devine. She is a por
trayal in the flesh of a painting of the
Holy Virgin.
Perhaps the most gorgeous scene is
that of "The Emperor" in which the Nun
is made consort of the emperor in a
solemn coronation ceremony. The whole
cast appears in slow procession in cloth
of gold. Grouped about the stage they
seem to be a number of old statues in a
hall of a mediaeval castle.
The impressiveness of the scenes as
they follow one upon the other, the deep
emotional acting of the Nun, and the di
vinity of the Madonna leaves the audi
ence with a feeling of awe.
