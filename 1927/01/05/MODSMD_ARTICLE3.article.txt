# WARNER CONFIRMS DELAY IN GRID CAPTAIN ELECTION
## 
### 
Coach Glenn "Pop" Warner con
firmed the rumor lust night that the j
election of the football captain for the \
1927 Stanford eleven will not take
place until about October 17, the (late :
of the Stanford-U.S.C. game. He said: !
"The captain will be elected just be
fore or just after the first conference
football game next season. The mat-;
ter was thought over by members of
the faculty, the manager, and the
president of the student body. It will j
be for the best interests of the team."
Athletes Approve
Although most members of the foot
ball team have not yet returned to the;
campus, several of those who have, to-:
gether with some others prominent in i
athletic work, have given their opin-,
ions on the new rule.
Wallace Denny, trainer of the team, j
said: "It would be a pretty good thing,!
because by the first conference game
the team would have a fairer idea as j
to who would be a good leader. Several j
men are eligible, and it would more or'
less be a toss-up. By waiting, affairs j
would be much better. To my way of
thinking, if things are like they appear,
the delay would bring out a better 1
captain."
Ted Shipkey, varsity end, pointed

out: "In the present condition, the idea j
j is very good. This year there Jfe many j
possible candidates, none of which is j
outstanding, and an election now
would mean a widely spread vote. The j
scheme was brought up shortly before j
the game down South, and 'Pop' ex-1
plained it to the fellows. The majority i
; seemed to be in favor of it. Those who'
graduate may have a vote by proxy, |
; but that hasn't been decided yet."
Roland Sellman, varsity tackle: "It's
a good idea. If the fellows wait till
i next fall they will have the men th^re. 1
If they choose a captain now, he might
flunk out. At any rate, it would mean
j a lot of trouble and bother because so
i many are eligible."
J
Team Backs "Pop"
j Most of the other men on the team
I agreed with Ward Poulson, who re
marked: "If 'Pop' Warner says it's j
0.K., it's O.K. with me!"
Fred Price, captain of the 1926 bas
ketball team: "A good plan for this!
. year, but not for a general practice. I
i With the situation as it stands, there
are several eligible, but no oustanding
j natural leader. If we wait awhile we
| can get a better leader."
Steve Collins, captain of the 1927
verged on the line of luck.
I In the Cardinals' playing two weak
! uesses were evident. Long passes'
i which, if* caught, would have placed a
forward in a position to score, were
muffed time and again. Failures to ;
register short shots rendered a Cardi
j nal rush futile many times over. The
| teamwork of the two quintets in the
second half was about on a par, but
the Bruins were simply too fast and
i too accurate on short shots.
