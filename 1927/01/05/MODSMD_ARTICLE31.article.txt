# COAST PREMIERE OF MOLNAR PLAY NEXT PENDRAGON OFFERING
## 
### 
Comedy of situation enlivened by
witty, sharp sallies of conversation com
bines with rapidity of continuity to
make "The Guardsman," to be produced
tonight and Saturday at the Palo Alto
Women's Clubhouse an unique playgoers'
treat, according to Margaret Kisich, di
rector of the Pendragon Players, com
munity players. Critics have united in
declaring this play by Molnar, Hungar
ian dramatic luminary, to be the year's
outstanding comedy success. Its produc
tion here is a Pacific Coast premiere.
The plot of "The Guardsman" deals
with a husband's testing of his wife's
love. As his wife's love seems to have
grown rather luke-warm, he devises a
double characterization in order to find
out her sincerity. As the guardsman, he
discovers new phenomena with regard
to her kissing, which he found had
grown rather cold after marriage. Which
ever way the outcome lies, the guards
man is hound to win.
Molnar plays with his idea in a charm
ing, sophisticated manner, introducing
biting satire with deft touches. His un
veiling of the common institutions of
marriage and home life is delicate and
yet not so subtle as to detract from the
broad comedy of the play.
Campus talent is represented in Garth
Winslow, who has an important part,
and by several graduate students, in
cluding Mrs. Kisich, director, Oliver
Kisich, and Charles Brown. The music
is under the supervision of Guido V. D.
Marx, also a Stanford graduate. Tickets
may be secured at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.
