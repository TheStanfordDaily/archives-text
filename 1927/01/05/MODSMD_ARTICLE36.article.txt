# FIRST EX COMMITTEE CONFERENCE OF 1927 HAS LITTLE BUSINESS
## 
### 
Nineteen-twenty-seven failed to pre
sent very much business for the con
sideration of the Executive Committee.
Last night's meeting had little more
to talk about than the sad affair of
last Saturday afternoon.
A new looker will be installed in
the Daily office which will store type
writers and other valuable equipment.
The committee approved taking the
necessary money from the Daily Im
provement Fund upon the suggestion
of Victor Greisser.
The minutes follow:
M.S.C. That the minutes of the last
meeting be amended to include the
name of William Laird in the list of
freshman football players awarded
numerals.
M.S.C. That the following dates be
granted: January 14, Phi Phi, formal;
February 25, Chi Omega, formal.
M.S.C. That the business manager
of The Stanford Daily be authorized
to withdraw from the Stanford Daily
Improvement Fund an amount suffi
cient to install lockers in The Stan
ford Daily office.
