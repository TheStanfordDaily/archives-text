# SPORTS OF 1927
## The 						Hop Scotch 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Competing in the Los Angeles $10,-
000 open golf tournament, the qualify
ing rounds of which are held today,
will be seen many of the greatest golf
ers in the world. Among this group
of champions and near-champions is
a man who could, if he wanted to,
claim the following: that he is the
holder of the world's lowest score for
both thirty-six and seventy-two holes;
that he is one of the longest drivers
in the world; and that he is the world's
fastest golfer. Among the numerous
championships that this player has
won is the British open tournament,
and his lesser titles are too numerous
to mention. He is a Scot. 43 years old
and his name is George Duncan.
Last year, in the first Los Angeles
$10,000 golf tournament, Harry Cooper,
the winner, grabbed off a nice check
for himself, the amount of wiiich was
$3,500. Now, do you think that George
Duncan of Methlick, Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, is going to let Harry Cooper
get away with first prize again if he
can help it? George is out to grab
that check, even if he has to duplicate
the 263 that he shot in the champion
ship of Lucerne in 1913 to win it.
Other classy players whom Duncan
will have to beat if he wins the afore
mentioned fat (but not bouncing)
check, are Joe Kirkwood, the famous
Australian trick-shot wizard; Mike

! Brady, who once got three holes in
one in a single round; Johnny Farrel
and "Wild Bill" Melliorn, two great
players who are always threatening to
win the United States open champion
ship; Joe Turnesa, who almost did
last year;* George Von Elm, the United
States amateur champion who beat
! Duncan badly in the last British open;
and Willie Hunter, a former British
amateur champion. And don't forget
the numerous "dark horses," any one
of whom might gallop through to a
J victory in this tournament, as Gene
I Sarazen did.
But to get back to the colorful Scot
—George Duncan, who once drove a
golf ball over 383 yards—he is one
of the most interesting of alll players
to watch, provided you are quick
enough to watch him. "Lightnin',"
they call him, for he walks up to the
ball on the fairway and smacks it
without seeming to pause at all to get
set. He does this to outwit his ner
vous system, as he is so high-strung
that if he waited and fidgeted around
before he hit the ball, he would get
all upset. No "Cyril Walker" style of
play for George Duncan!
