# CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL FINDS CANCER CURES HAVE MADE PROGRESS
## 
### 
As a result of a unique investigation
carried on by the University of Cali
fornia Hospital over a period of about
eight years, it has been shown that the
possibility of cure in cancer cases of
the so-called operable variety has in
creased from about 40 per cent to 60
per cent, and also that about 10 per
cent of formerly hopeless cases can now
be saved through the advent of radium
into the field of medicine.
Demonstration of these facts has been
made conclusive for the first time by
a follow-up survey of 107 cases of cati
ccr of the pelvic organs of women, un
der the direction of Dr. Frank W.
Lynch, Professor of Obstetrics and
Gynecology at the University Hospital.
The survey is remarkable in that follow
up records of 104 of tlie 107 cases have
been kept for a period of five to seven
and one-half years, and the other three
were lost sight of only at the end of the
third year after treatment.
On the basis of the statistics gathered
in the survey, Dr. Lynch recommends
that operations for cancer be confined to
cases where the growth is small and the
location of it such that a very extensive
"* removal of all surrounding tissue can
be made, and when the patient is physi
cally able to withstand such an exten
sive operation. All such operations
should be preceded and followed by ra
dium treatments. In cases where the
growth is so extensive as to make a
complete removal of potentially cancer
ous tissue unadvisable, radium treatments
together with a general physical upbuild
ing of the patient proves to be the only
feasible method.
