# CARD FIVE HAS WON SINGLE SERIES FROM REARS IN SIX YEARS
## 
### 
It has been six years since a Stan
ford cage squad has taken a series
from California, and in that year
(1921) the Bears' high percentage
gave them the championship of the
Pacific Coast Conference.
During the ten years that basket
ball lias been a conference sport, Cali
fornia has won four championships,
tied for two, and been runner-up for
another two. The Bears took the title
in 1921, 1924, 1925, and 1926; tied with
Oregon in 1916 and with Washington
State in 1917; were runnera-up to Ore
gon in 1919 and to Idaho in 1923. In
1918 there was no conference play due
to the war.
During the fifteen years that Cali
fornia and Stanford have met on the
basketball court, California has won
the dual championship thirteen times,
Stanford only twice. The record in
games is nearly as impressiveâ€”Cali-
fornia has won 30 games of the series;
Stanford but 7.
For eight years, from 1912 until
1920, California consistently won the
Stanford series, taking fifteen games
In all to the Redshirts' one.
Not until seven years after Stanford
and California adopted basketball as
an intercollegiate sport did Stanford
win a single game. In 1918 the Cardi
nals took their first game, but lost the
three-game series for the title to Cali
fornia.
