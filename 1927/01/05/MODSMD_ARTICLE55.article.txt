# TO RAISE $20,000,000 ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
In order to keep Yale university in
the front rank of universities, efforts
will be made to raise a $20,000,000 en
dowment fund to provide an income
to raise professors' salaries to a higher
level. Part of the income will be used
to better the inner facilities of the uni
versity. Dr. James R. Angell, president
of Yale, states that the need for a
consideration of salaries for the profes
sors is so acute that if Yale fails in
this drive it will mean that Yale will
have to drop out of the front rank of
universities.
