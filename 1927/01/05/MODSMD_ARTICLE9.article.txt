### Henry Clock 
1 With fifteen promising trackmen
from last year's freshman team out
besides nineteen returning members
! of the varsity, prospects for the com
ing track season appear very bright,
according to Coach Dink Templeton.
! Because of the wealth of new and
young fellows in several events and
the return of last year's stars in others,
Templeton expects one of the most
;successful track seasons in recent
years. Practice has been under way
> for nearly two months, but the final
; lap of training will begin immediately.
Sprints Have Five
i In the sprints, Dick Hyland, who last
; year finished second in the meet with
C.S.C., will return. Fred Zombro and
Bob Syer, both members of last year's
freshman team, will be out for the
sprints this year. Richman, winner of
I the intramural 100-yard dash recently,
1 is also training for the varsity. A 1 Bty
| is the fifth prospect for a sprint posi
| tion. #
Clarence West, who placed in the
1 national collegiates last spring, and
j Ross Nichols, who was out last year
with an injured arm, will return to
j take care of the hurdles. Nelson, from
1 the freshman team of last year, will
| also be out for the hurdles.
Babcock Back
Captain Babcock will be back for
; the quarter-mile, as will Spencer and
i McGuire, both of whom were on the
1 squad last year. Dales, winner of the
! quarter in the Little Big Meet last
year, and Tom Moss, who placed sec
ond, are both out for the 440.
In the half-mile, Carlsmith, a veteran
from last year, and McKinnon, star
freshman 880 man from last year, are
training for the season. The loss of
Bill Richardson will be felt in this
race.
Four men are out for the mile.
Ranney, Swain, Gooden, and Svplier
are all training for the long-distance
run. In the two-mile, Ted Criley, who
placed second in the California meet
last year, is the only prospect this
year.
Pole Vault Strong
The pole vault will be strong with
the two freshman vaulters, Hulsman
and Edmonds, and will be strength
ened by the shifting of Nichols to the
event.
Two of last year's high-jumpers will
return this year, King and Work. Both
placed in nearly all the meets last
year.
With several candidates for the
broad-jump this event will be particu
larly strong, Templeton thinks. Meeks,
last year's letterman, Zombro, from
last year's freshmen, and Anderson
and Dyer are all out for the broad
jump. ,
Hoffman, who also attended the na
tional collegiates last year, will return
for both the shot and discus. Forester,
star of the last year's freshmen, will
also be out for both the weight events.
Fleisliacker and Kvans will try for the
shot and discus respectively.
The javelin will also be strong with
the return of Joaquin and Shipkey
from the varsity, and the addition of
Sparling and Goodcell from the frosh.
A relay team will be chosen from
the middle-distance runners later in
the season. The first meet will not be
held for several weeks, although in
tensive training will begin this week

Babcock Back
Captain Babcock will be back for
; the quarter-mile, as will Spencer and
i McGuire, both of whom were on the
1 squad last year. Dales, winner of the
! quarter in the Little Big Meet last
year, and Tom Moss, who placed sec
ond, are both out for the 440.
In the half-mile, Carlsmith, a veteran
from last year, and McKinnon, star
freshman 880 man from last year, are
training for the season. The loss of
Bill Richardson will be felt in this
race.
Four men are out for the mile.
Ranney, Swain, Gooden, and Svplier
are all training for the long-distance
run. In the two-mile, Ted Criley, who
placed second in the California meet
last year, is the only prospect this
year.
Pole Vault Strong
The pole vault will be strong with
the two freshman vaulters, Hulsman
and Edmonds, and will be strength
ened by the shifting of Nichols to the
event.
Two of last year's high-jumpers will
return this year, King and Work. Both
placed in nearly all the meets last
year.
With several candidates for the
broad-jump this event will be particu
larly strong, Templeton thinks. Meeks,
last year's letterman, Zombro, from
last year's freshmen, and Anderson
and Dyer are all out for the broad
jump. ,
Hoffman, who also attended the na
tional collegiates last year, will return
for both the shot and discus. Forester,
star of the last year's freshmen, will
also be out for both the weight events.
Fleisliacker and Kvans will try for the
shot and discus respectively.
The javelin will also be strong with
the return of Joaquin and Shipkey
from the varsity, and the addition of
Sparling and Goodcell from the frosh.
A relay team will be chosen from
the middle-distance runners later in
the season. The first meet will not be
held for several weeks, although in
tensive training will begin this week
1 With fifteen promising trackmen
from last year's freshman team out
besides nineteen returning members
! of the varsity, prospects for the com
ing track season appear very bright,
according to Coach Dink Templeton.
! Because of the wealth of new and
young fellows in several events and
the return of last year's stars in others,
Templeton expects one of the most
;successful track seasons in recent
years. Practice has been under way
> for nearly two months, but the final
; lap of training will begin immediately.
Sprints Have Five
i In the sprints, Dick Hyland, who last
; year finished second in the meet with
C.S.C., will return. Fred Zombro and
Bob Syer, both members of last year's
freshman team, will be out for the
sprints this year. Richman, winner of
I the intramural 100-yard dash recently,
1 is also training for the varsity. A 1 Bty
| is the fifth prospect for a sprint posi
| tion. #
Clarence West, who placed in the
1 national collegiates last spring, and
j Ross Nichols, who was out last year
with an injured arm, will return to
j take care of the hurdles. Nelson, from
1 the freshman team of last year, will
