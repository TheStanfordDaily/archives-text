# FOOTBALL TEAM LOSES SIX MEN BY GRADUATION
## Shipkey, Walker, Poulson, Bogue, Swan, Harris, End Third Year SHIPKEY ALL-AMERICAN Wealth of Material Still Eligible to Compete Next Autumn 
### 
With the end of the 1926 football
season marked by the Alabama game,
dopesters are already beginning to
look for what the Pacific Coast Con
ference Championships can offer for
next year. Six of the men who played
against the Crimson Tide will be un
able to report next fall because of the
three-year rule. Captain Fred Swan,
Ted Shipkey, George Bogue, Ed
Walker, Ward Poulson, Leo Harris —
all have played their last game for the
Cardinal.
Captain Swan, named on several
All-Coast teams, has been given hon
orable mention as an ail-American.
He has a record of being on four
teams that have never bowed to the
Golden Bear. He entered Stanford in
1923 as the tide was turning and he
captained the 1927 yearlings to vic
tory.
Ted Shipkey is the only one of the
six to be given a place on the All-
American team; he has played three
years on the varsity, as well as a
year as a freshman.
Another All-Coast player, George
Bogue, has also received honorable
mention as Ail-American. Although he
is the only first-string back that gradu
ates, he will leave a gap that will be
hard to fill.
Ed Walker came into prominence
two years ago when he was on the
j starting end of the pass that tied the
! score of the Big Game. Last season
| Walker was shifted to end where he
| has made his presence known,
i Ward Poulson and Leo Harris, both
| tackles, have each served on the var
! sity squad for three years and have
I been strong members of the line dur
! ing the past season.
Nine other members of the varsity
squad will also be missing next sea-
I son. They are Greisser, Work, Garth
j waite, Graves, Graham, Natcher,
Leistner, Trombetta, and Sholes.
In spite of the havoc played by the
theepskin, there will be a goodly nu
| cleus around which another champion
j ship team may be built. In the back
field will be found Don Hill, Dick Hy
land, Mike Murphy, Frank Wilton, and
Bob Sims, each an experienced half.
All three of the varsity signal-
I callers —Eli Post, Spud Lewis, and
| Hank Millage, will have another year
jto play for Stanford. Likewise, the
three contestants for fullback, Ernie
Patchett, Sam Joseph, and Biff Hoff
| man, have another opportunity to wear
the Cardinal. Fleishhacker, who was
drafted from the line to fill a backfield
berth, will also be on hand for assist-
I ance.
There will have to be two new ends.
! Spud Harder and Fred Price, botli
first-string substitutes, are expected to
j show up for this position, as are Pres
j ton and Davidson. Price is a senior
i but is eligible, nevertheless, for an
i other year. Two veteran tackles, Chris
Freeman and Roland Sellman, may
again play in their former positions.
Artman, Moomaw, and Everett will
have a chance to show their wares
for this place, as well.
Don Robesky, varsity guard, will
have another opportunity to pulverize
the Blue and Gold's line, and with him
will be Seraphim Post. The latter, who
was unable to be at college during the
football season because of illness, will
probably turn out to fill the hole left
by Captain Swan. Kazanjiian will be a
' prominent contender for one of the
guard berths.
Stan Natcher is the only veteran
! center that will leave the team. Hal
McCreery, who is a first-string man,
and Graham and Vermilya will be eli
! gible for further competition.

In spite of the havoc played by the
theepskin, there will be a goodly nu

field will be found Don Hill, Dick Hy

Bob Sims, each an experienced half.
All three of the varsity signal-
I callers —Eli Post, Spud Lewis, and
| Hank Millage, will have another year
jto play for Stanford. Likewise, the
three contestants for fullback, Ernie
Patchett, Sam Joseph, and Biff Hoff
| man, have another opportunity to wear
the Cardinal. Fleishhacker, who was
drafted from the line to fill a backfield
berth, will also be on hand for assist-
I ance.
There will have to be two new ends.
! Spud Harder and Fred Price, botli
first-string substitutes, are expected to
j show up for this position, as are Pres
j ton and Davidson. Price is a senior
i but is eligible, nevertheless, for an
i other year. Two veteran tackles, Chris
Freeman and Roland Sellman, may
again play in their former positions.
Artman, Moomaw, and Everett will
have a chance to show their wares
for this place, as well.
Don Robesky, varsity guard, will
have another opportunity to pulverize
the Blue and Gold's line, and with him
will be Seraphim Post. The latter, who
was unable to be at college during the
football season because of illness, will
probably turn out to fill the hole left
by Captain Swan. Kazanjiian will be a
' prominent contender for one of the
guard berths.
Stan Natcher is the only veteran

McCreery, who is a first-string man,
and Graham and Vermilya will be eli

With the end of the 1926 football
season marked by the Alabama game,
dopesters are already beginning to
look for what the Pacific Coast Con
ference Championships can offer for
next year. Six of the men who played
against the Crimson Tide will be un
able to report next fall because of the
three-year rule. Captain Fred Swan,
Ted Shipkey, George Bogue, Ed
Walker, Ward Poulson, Leo Harris —
all have played their last game for the
Cardinal.
Captain Swan, named on several
All-Coast teams, has been given hon
orable mention as an ail-American.
He has a record of being on four
teams that have never bowed to the
Golden Bear. He entered Stanford in
1923 as the tide was turning and he
captained the 1927 yearlings to vic
tory.
Ted Shipkey is the only one of the
six to be given a place on the All-
American team; he has played three
years on the varsity, as well as a
year as a freshman.
Another All-Coast player, George
Bogue, has also received honorable
mention as Ail-American. Although he
is the only first-string back that gradu
ates, he will leave a gap that will be
hard to fill.
Ed Walker came into prominence
two years ago when he was on the
j starting end of the pass that tied the
! score of the Big Game. Last season
| Walker was shifted to end where he
| has made his presence known,
i Ward Poulson and Leo Harris, both
| tackles, have each served on the var

I been strong members of the line dur

Nine other members of the varsity
squad will also be missing next sea-
