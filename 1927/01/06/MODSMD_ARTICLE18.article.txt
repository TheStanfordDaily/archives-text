# CARD PROSPECTS FOR BASEBALL OPTIMISTIC SAYS COACH WOLTERS
## Practice Scheduled to Start When Field Becomes Dry for Playing 
### 
With the return of ten varsity base
ball men and six sophomores, pros
; pects for the Cardinal season appear
optimistic in the opinion of Coach
|Harry Wolters. Practice, he stated, will
j begin as soon as the field is dry
enough for playing.
The schedule has not been definitely
I arranged and is being held up on ac
! count of formation of a new league
which is to include St. Mary's, Santa
i Clara, U.S.C., U.C., and Stanford. Al
though the University of California,
| Southern Branch, will probably not be
admitted until next year, the Cardinals
; are making plans to meet its team
when Coach Wolters' men are down
south.
The varsity men who have signed up
are: Captain Collins, Sypher, Sobieski,
! Nissen, Stewart, Busch, Garibaldi,
| Maguire, Philippi, and Adams. All are
juniors with the exception of Collins
! and Stewart.
For pitchers, Collins, Sobieski, and
i Philippi should show up good. Sypher
and Nissen are trying out for catcher.
Sypher caught at .the majority of
i games last year, and Nissen played in
; the games in Japan. For second base
and infield, Busch, Garibaldi, and
Adams should give their opponents
| some trouble. Stewart and Maguire
are the only outfielders left since
Weaver, last year's man, has not come
back, and Clarke's injuries will not
| allow him to turn out.
The members of last year's fresh
j man team who have reported for prac
! tice this year are Kern and Lewis,
j pitchers, Brown, catcher, Wright, first
j baseman, Rogers, infield, and Harder,
| third baseman.
The only positions lacking varsity
! material are third base and the out
field. If the sophomores show up the
way Wolters expects them to, he will
have little difficulty in filling in these
posts.
Commenting on the freshman team,
Wolters said that although hardly any
! thing could be predicted accurately
i until practice begins, he believes that
; some good prospects are in order since
! approximately fifty first-year men have
J signed up so far.
