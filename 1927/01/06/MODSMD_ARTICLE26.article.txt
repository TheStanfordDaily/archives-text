# CAGEMEN BEGIN STIFF PRACTICE AFTER DEFEAT
## Intensive Floorwork Aimed Toward Improvement With Attack RETURN MEET SCHEDULED Squad Feels Loss of Clark And Smalling in Last Quarter of Play 
### Fred Speers 
Stanford's basketball varsity, bene
fitting from the weaknesses displayed
in Tuesday's game with the Southern
Branch, worked out last night to re
move those faults. Coach Hunt said
that even had Stanford won the game
he would not yet be satisfied with the
team, pleased though he is with the
form the varsity has sh&wn thus far
in the season.
Intensive floorwork and practice in
changing rapidly from defensive play
ing constituted the main work of the
varsity last night. Another thing on
which Hunt plans to give his charges
plenty of practice is securing held
balls on the tip-offs. The game with
the Branch displayed an outstanding
weakness of the Cardinals in this de
partment.
Practice on Fouls
Drill on shooting fouls took, and will
continue to take, a considerable
amount of attention. Seven of the
Bruins' 21 points were made via the
free-throw route. Stanford, on the
other hand, got but three points in this
manner. Those lone points add up rap
idly, as Ketchum, Branch ace, demon
strated to perfection when he sank
Ave free throws during the course of
the game.
So far as actual teamwork and fol-
lowing out of plays goes the Cardinals
leave little to be asked. Stanford's
faults, such as they are, lie more in
♦he individual work. Hunt plans to
work his men on more passing and
less dribbling.
Return Game Scheduled
Handicapped by a four days' lapse
in practice preceding the Southern
Branch game, the Cardinals played in
good form. An opportunity to wipe out
Tuesday's defeat will be presented to
the Cards later in the month when they
meet the Bruins in a return game in
Los Angeles.
At present Hunt is pointing his men
for the game with St. Mary's Satur
day night in the pavilion. By then the
varsity will be in hotter shape for
play than it was Tuesday night. The
squad has felt the loss of Bill Clark
through injuries and Smalling through
ineligibility at the close of last quar
ter, but the season is yet young enough
to give the Cardinal mentor plenty of
time to adjust the squad to cover up
these losses.
