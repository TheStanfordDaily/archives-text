# Ex Committee Resolves
## 
### 
The Executive Committee has turned to making New Year's reso
lutions. It has decided that the student body shall 110 longer he forced
to struggle along under a constitution framed some few years ago after
a coast-wide research.
Resolutions made for the new year are usually remembered a week
or so and then go by the boards. But this is a case of necessity and the
only chance for a slip in the present plans lies in the fact that the new
compilation may not be ready in time for ratifiaction at the mid-year
election.
When the present constitution was written the extent of the search
for ideas was most excellent but it is practically impossible to conceive
how the A.S.S.U. was ever blessed with the present ambiguous, unorgan
ized, jumbled mass of regulations with which it is now burdened.
The duties of the student officers are not clearly defined. When any
information is desired it is necessary to wade through the entire docu
ment. Rulings governing one organization can now be found in five
distinctly separated parts of the constitution.
Furthermore many of the minor details that should be found in the
by-laws are now a part of the constitution. It is because of this that
amendments are so frequently necessary and that the regulations are
many times openly violated.
The present Executive Committee is to be congratulated 011 taking
the initiative in this reform. It is to be hoped that the new constitution
is so arranged as to accomplish the high purpose for which it is intended.
