Show Boat, by Edna Ferber. Double
day, Page & Co. $2.00.
"Show Boat" is a story of the thea
trical world. It deals with the bizarre
life led by the actors of the Cotton
Blossom Floating Palace Theatre,
which steams up and down the Missis
sippi once a year, stopping at all the
little riverside towns to give the toil
worn, unimaginative inhabitants their
annual glimpse into the giddy splendor
of life as depicted by the emotional
and melodramatic plays constituting
the company's repertoire.
Andy Ilawkes, a skilled old river
boat, captain, changes over into the
show boat business when the railroad
takes away his trade. After much per
suasion he gets his Puritanic New Eng
land wife to swallow her pride and
accompany him on the show boat with
their daughter, Magnolia. ,
The child is brought up, therefore,
saturated with the atmosphere of
river-boat life, of the theatre, and of
lazy, uncouth loafers who populate
the wharves. By the time she is
eighteen, she is playing the ingenue
lead. Finally she runs off and marries
a very prepossessing gentleman who
has come on board as an actor. Mrs.
Hawkes cannot tolerate him, and after
about a year and a half, relations be
tween the mother and son-in-law be
come so strained that Magnolia and
her husband, and child, Kim, go to
live in Chicago. Here it turns out that
Gaylord, the husband, Is a professional
gambler. As fortune varies, the three
of them oscillate between glittering
luxury and abject poverty with a fre
quency that amounts almost to regu
larity.
When Gaylord dies, Magnolia turns
to the voudeville stage for a living.
Kim, on graduating from the convent
where her mother finally placed her,
safe from the sordid conditions of
their existence, decides to go to an
actress' finishing school and soon be- i

| comes a Broadway success.
Magnolia, uncomprehensive of the
polished, unemotional, modern school
j of acting, is lured back to the mysteri
; ous, treacherous, but very fascinating
I river and the life on the show boat.
