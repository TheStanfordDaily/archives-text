Ways of Escape, Noel Forrest. Little,
Brown & Co. $2.00.
j "I have a purpose in life and I carry
it out," said Stephen Heath, eminent
architect and first citizen of Stangate.
Well, Stephen so works his will as
;to make the reader quite disgusted
I with him by the time he has alienated
the allegiance of his two oldest sons,
i bartered his daughter in marriage,
land brought about his wife's prema
ture death. This latter tragedy, cou
pled with the downfall of Stephen's
plans for civic betterment, serves to
1 shatter the cold life-philsopohy of the
austere father, and he crumples before
fate's retaliation. Determining to win
| the whole-hearted love of his one re
maining son, lie succeeds in doing so
only to see the little chap plucked by
the hand of death.
Then Stephen Heath turns human,
and that glowing circumstance makes
! the story worth following to the end.
Mr. Forrest has indicated in his first
novel a gift for plotting and character
ization which, combined with a fine
restraint in his attitude toward his sub
jject, has made the tale one worthy of
wide reading and consideration.
The conversation is rather forced,
| unreal, and stilted. One seldom, even
lin the lecture room, hears the war
mentioned as "the universal upheaval."
j Such phraseologoy seems to be too
; heavily indulged in by this as by
other English writers .
If you have received "Ways of Es
cape" as a Christmas book, it is to be
hoped that you will give it your atten
tion before stacking it on the shelves
of your house library. â€”T.P.
