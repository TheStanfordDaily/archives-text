### —By The King— 
Manuscripts for the 1928 Junior
Opera are requested. We suggest the
following ideas and do not expect to
cash in on the customary seventy-five
berries either.
DRAMATIS PERSONAE
1 handsome hero
1 hero (make him dumb)
1 villain, not so dumb
Soldiers, messengers, ladies-in
waiting, etc.
TIME: Any old time.
PLACE: Soviet Russia or what have
you!
SCENES: One or two. Each should
feature a darkened stage across which
[the pony chorus will parade (or
dance). Each time the chorus is tc
sing the same song and to give twice
a« many encores as the audience de
sires.
SCENE SHIFTERS: From the work
shop class, and sufficiently intelligent
that the curses of the director at theii
breaks will not be heard beyond row
six.
PROMPTERS: To be equipped with
megaphones.
ORCHESTRA: Louder as well as

! more comic. The orchestra must begin
each selection even with the singer.
A small prize to the party finishing
each selection first will be awarded by
the firms advertising in the Stanford
Lit. Their ad will be found' just be
yond the word "sophisticated" on page
j 15.
AERODYNAMICS: All ruffs are to
constpuct airplanes to be released be
tween acts. To the first pilot who
lands a plane on a bald-Headed man in
the pit will be awarded a pair of pur
ple suspenders for formal wear.
USHERS: Will not seat anyone be
fore the beginning of the first act, thus
i co-operating with the audience which
won't arrive before that time anyhow.
LAFFS: If any, are to be received
by the performers with an iacrease in
the tempo of the play, i.e., the talent
' will speed up the action of the thing
| lest somebody inadvertantly keeps up
' with the development of the plot, if
any.
CRITICISM: The Daily will describe
the opera as exceedingly good with a
few lapses. Tht Lit will call it sopliis
ticatedly subnormal. F.T.M.
