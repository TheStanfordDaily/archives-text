To liissingly hurl the vile epithet "Phi
Bate" at a fellow student seems in the
minds of average college men to express
the height of invective anathema. To be
called a 'Phi Bate" is to be grossly and
definitely insulted.

And yet, curiously enough, wc arc told
that we conic to college to study and
learn. The connection between this aim
and the stigma that is attached to the
mention of Phi Beta Kappa, the symbol
of all that is highest in studious applica
tion, is rather hard to see. In fact, this
instance is indicative of a general chain
of circumstances which seems to show
that the old aim of coming to college to
study is being largely replaced by the
idea that the university should assist us
in acquiring ease in the social graces of
drinking heavily and heartily, of playing
poker into the Godless hours, or to culti
vate a hood healthy American enthusiasm
for the great American shame . . . foot
ball.
It is highly significant that the change
of the position of a player 011 the team
merits a headline, while a Phi Beta Kap
pa election is noted inconspiciously in a
tiny corner in the college paper. Is it
good sportsmanship to deny him even
the little honor and credit that a poor
misled Phi Bate might claim ?
