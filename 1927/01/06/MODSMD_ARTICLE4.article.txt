# BULLET HOLES IN CEILING RECALL RALLY MEMORIES

And they are burying another Stan
ford tradition.
No future generations of freshmen
will be awed by ominous holes in the
ceiling of the Assembly Hall. Nor will
their curiosity be aroused to ask about
those mementoes of former days, when
the patriotic emotion, inspired by the
rallies, found vent in firing real bullets
In lieu of the blank cartridges sufficing
now.
The ancient bullet holes, while fur
nishing a picturesque atmosphere,
have had a most detrimental effect
upon the ceiling, as demonstrated by
the fall of some three by ten "feet of
plaster from a cornice over the gal
lery last Thursc?ay night. As a result,
all plaster must be removed, and an
expanse of burlap substituted until
next summer when complete repairs
can restore an unblemished surface.

J With the bullet holes will also go
!an object of ancient, almost historic
interest, namely, a glass tumbler that
has reposed high up over the pro
| scenium arch, origin unknown, fur
nishing a subject for vague specula-
Lions on the part of those freshmen
for whom the Citizenship lecture had
| lost its charm.
Those were the days, too, when yells
were delivered from the precarious
vantage point of the backs of the
Assembly seats, the loyal sons balanc
ing row on row while they tore out
vociferous "Skyrockets." Sometimes an
| enthusiast in the front row leaned too
far back, resulting in a nine-pin effect,
devastating to cords and Assembly
chairs.
From now on, of course, the ceiling
j will be quite safe, the seats will re
main attached firmly to the floor, and
all thirty-eights will hold blanks only!
