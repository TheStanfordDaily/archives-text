# BAND-SHELL HOLDS RECORD ON FARM FOR USELESSNESS
## 
### 
Used but once in its ten years'
existence, the band-shell situated
on the southeast shore of Lagu
nita seems destined to a con
tinued life of uselessness. Recent
plans to move it to a spot adjoin
ing the band-house where it could
be used for concerts and rehears
als were abandoned because of
prohibitive cost.
The stand was originally situ
ated at the site of the New Union,
being built in 1917 for the exer
cises of commencement week.
The weather was so warm, how
ever, that it was used only once.
When the Union was to be
built, it was believed that the
platform could be adapted for
band use and was moved to itÂ§r
present location. Because of its
remoteness, the shell was never
used.
Now and then queeners are
seen sitting in the shade it of
fers, so perhaps it was not built
in vain.
