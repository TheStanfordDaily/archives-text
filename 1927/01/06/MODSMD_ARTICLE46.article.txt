## 
### 
The introduction of soccer into many
of the large universities of America
brings to mind some facts regarding
its long and varied history. Tho game
seems to have originated in Greece,
where it was played with a ball known
as the "harpaston," the purpose of the
players being to force the ball into
that portion of the field guarded by a
rival team. It was played in a similar
manner by the Romans.
Tho Romans introduced the game
into Rritain. Legend tells us that
Julius Caesar brought over from Rome
on his famous "barn-storming" expe
ditions several foot-abllers to teach
the Britons the game It was then that
the trials and vicissitudes of football
started.

From the reign of Edward I to that
or James I the "brutality and extreme
violence" of the game brought forth
; unfavorable legislation from the gov
j ernment. - •
I3y 1800, football in England had
! evolved into several highly specialized
types of games played by all the great
public schools in the country, the main
i feature being the rule against carrying
| tbe ball. The introduction of the
•nrrying game Is attributed to one
Willinm Webb Ellis, a student at
Rup:by who, in the closing minute of
a tie game, "with a fine disregard for
the rules of football, took the ball in
his p '~«b and ran with it," thus origi
nal i' tbe distinctive feature of rugby,
' h r> of American football.
