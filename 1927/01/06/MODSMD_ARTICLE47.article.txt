# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Owen (Donie) Bush, erstwhile mail- I
ager of the Indianapolis team of the ;
American Association and new boss of
the Pittsburgh Pirates has been called
the "bantam champion of all the base
ball managers." For Donie grew up
fighting in the toughest section of In-1
dianapolis, and through his baseball
career he has been known as an ag-;
gressive and two-fisted individual who i
never avoided a fight and often went
out of his way to find one.
If you are one of the many who have
thought that the Pirates have needed
a fighting manager, be $t ease, for, no j
matter how big or how tough some
of the Pittsburgh players may be,
Donie Bush will be the boss of that i
ball club! The Smoky City is likely to
see so much fist-flying and jaw-wag- i
ging in 1927 that the fans will think
Art Fletcher and his Phils of 1925 are
playing all the Pirates' home games.
But enough of the fighting qualities
of Mr. Bush, which have no doubt
toned down a bit in reccnt years, al-,
though they do say that Donie was
death on umpires in the American
Association. Mr. Bush has other
things to his credit besides the fact
that he is not a "molly-coddle." One of
them is that he used to be one of the
best short-stops in the American
League. Donie played with Detroit in

that position for a dozen years.
In 1922, Bush served as player and
coach of the Washington Senators,
and managed them throughout 1923. j
He did very well, too, and left what
was to become a world's championship J
outfit for Stanley Harris to put the fin- i
ishing touches on. As manager of In
dianapolis, Donie led his team into
second position each of the three years
he was in charge. Now it will be in
teresting to see how he makes out in
Pittsburgh, where the manager's berth
is anything but a bed of roses.
The new Pirate leader is 38 years ,
old. He seems to like the number 8
r 8 he was born November 8, 1888.
Let's hope his team does not finish
in eighth place.

Pittsburgh, where the manager's berth
is anything but a bed of roses.
The new Pirate leader is 38 years ,
old. He seems to like the number 8

Let's hope his team does not finish
in eighth place.

Owen (Donie) Bush, erstwhile mail- I
ager of the Indianapolis team of the ;
American Association and new boss of
the Pittsburgh Pirates has been called
the "bantam champion of all the base
ball managers." For Donie grew up
fighting in the toughest section of In-1
dianapolis, and through his baseball
career he has been known as an ag-;
gressive and two-fisted individual who i
never avoided a fight and often went
out of his way to find one.
If you are one of the many who have
thought that the Pirates have needed
a fighting manager, be $t ease, for, no j
matter how big or how tough some
of the Pittsburgh players may be,
Donie Bush will be the boss of that i
ball club! The Smoky City is likely to
see so much fist-flying and jaw-wag- i
ging in 1927 that the fans will think
Art Fletcher and his Phils of 1925 are
playing all the Pirates' home games.
But enough of the fighting qualities
of Mr. Bush, which have no doubt
toned down a bit in reccnt years, al-,
though they do say that Donie was
death on umpires in the American
Association. Mr. Bush has other
things to his credit besides the fact
that he is not a "molly-coddle." One of
them is that he used to be one of the
best short-stops in the American
League. Donie played with Detroit in

that position for a dozen years.
In 1922, Bush served as player and
coach of the Washington Senators,
and managed them throughout 1923. j
He did very well, too, and left what
was to become a world's championship J
outfit for Stanley Harris to put the fin- i
ishing touches on. As manager of In
dianapolis, Donie led his team into
second position each of the three years
he was in charge. Now it will be in
teresting to see how he makes out in
Pittsburgh, where the manager's berth
is anything but a bed of roses.
The new Pirate leader is 38 years ,
old. He seems to like the number 8
r 8 he was born November 8, 1888.
Let's hope his team does not finish
in eighth place.
