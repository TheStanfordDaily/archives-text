# Princeton Football Pays Other Athletic Deficits
## 
### 
Football pays at Princeton. In fact
It is the only sport which paid its own
way during the year of 1925-26.
Receipts from football, amounting to
$159,718.21, covered the general ex
penses and the deficits of all other
athletics at the university, although
they were not sufficient to meet the
cost of resurfacing Palmer Memorial
Stadium.
