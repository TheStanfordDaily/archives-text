# Dentistry College Dean At Southern California Opposes Honor System
## 
### 
Dean Lewis E. Ford of the College
of Dentistry of Southern California i
was recently interviewed on the ques- !
tion of the proposed honor system and ,
its effectiveness at the Dental College, i
Dr. Ford believes that the honor !
system would fail in the College of
Dentistry.
"The only kind of an honor system
that works is a jail and a jug and a
police force. I believe in a strong proc
torial system," says Dr. Ford.
"When we come to an examination
we aren't trying to determine honor," !
added Dr. Ford. "We are trying to
find out how the professor is getting
his subject over. It isn't a matter of j
honor."
