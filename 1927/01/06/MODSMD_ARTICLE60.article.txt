At the top of this page you see the
picture that our Mister Philippi has
drawn showing what happens to people
who BLOW TOO HARD.
Alabama was champion of the entire
Southern Conference, and Stanford was
champion of the whole Pacific Coast, but
neither was quite content to rest on its
laurels: so they arranged a great inter
sectional football game. Both universities
were CONFIDENT OF VICTORY.
Both were sure that they were going to
win. This was an obvious absurdity. To
take a sentiment from a GREAT con
temporary tin-pan artist, SOMEBODY
WAS WRONG.
The two universities went on blow
ing and blowing on that BUBBLE, neith
er one thinking that it was about to face
disaster. And then the bubble burst. And
you can hardly imagine the surprise and
chagrin of the two universities when they
both turned out to be ALL WET, as

Mister Philippi has shown in the second
picture.
In one of the smaller pictures the
artist has drawn the Rose Bowl. Mister
Philippi is a realist. You will observe
that the only ROSY thing about the bowl
are the SPECTATORS. This is pretty
nearly true to life. Only we have looked
up the word SPECTATOR in the dic
tionary, and have found out that it means
ONE WHO SEES. And we don't under
stand how anyone could be as full as
that Rose Bowl was and still be able
to see.
In the picture of Pierce the artist has
shown the influence of the younger Re
form school. Notice the symbolism.
Pierce is using hi's HEAD and is
BLOCKING the kick. Pretty cagey.
WHAT?
Take a SLANT at the remaining pic
ture for evidences of the same thing.
You will observe that Stanford is PAD
DLING the Tide. The MORAL in this
editorial is especially intended for under
classmen. Don't get FULL like a Rose
Bowl or someone will paddle YOU!
