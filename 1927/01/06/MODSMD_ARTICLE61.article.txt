# Drinking Brings Order to Stop Trips to Grid Games
## 
### 
In an attempt to curb student drink- j
ing, authorities of the University of
Chicago forbade all students from at- 1
tending out-of-town games. The stu- |
dents have openly defied this new'
order as the games away from home
have been well attended, and now the i
Maroon, student paper, is leading the
opposition of the students.
The faculty order followed the arti
cle published by W. O. Cross, former
student of the University of Illinois,
who declared that all student trips
were marked by excessive drinking
and debauchery.
