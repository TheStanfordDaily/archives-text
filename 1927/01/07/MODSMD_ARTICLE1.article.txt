Dr. Thomas A. Story, '96, has re
turned to the University faculty after
an absence of twenty years, to become
the head of the men's physical educa
tion work as Professor of Hygiene and
Physical Education and Director of
Encina Gymnasium.
Before he left Stanford Dr. Story
was in charge of the men's gymnasium
work here. At the time when he
served, there was no organized or re
quired system of physical training.
Only about 30-0 students elected to
take the courses given, and "Tom"
Story, as he was then called, and a
few student assistants, composed the
staff of directors.
Between the time he left Stanford
and his return Dr. Story has com
pleted his medical education and has
for twenty years been in charge of the
Department of Hygiene of the College
of the City of New York where he
built up that organization to such a
degree of excellence that it has be
come in many ways a model for the
whole country.
During the World War Dr. Story was
the directing executive of the United
States Interdepartmental Social Hy
giene Board, which was a result of
the co-operative effort of the War,
Navy, and Treasury departments. Mil
lions of dollars were expended every 1
year in this department's work which i
included educational and scientific re-!
search and development.
In 1016 Dr. Story was appointed one
of three administrative commissioners
for a system of boys' camps estab
lished under military discipline by the
State of New York.
lie has written extensively on physi
ology, hygiene, physical education, and
related subjects, and is the author of
the New York State Program and
Syllabus on Physical Training.
Mrs. Story was Parnie Hamilton, '98.
The Story family is residing at 10
Cabrillo.
