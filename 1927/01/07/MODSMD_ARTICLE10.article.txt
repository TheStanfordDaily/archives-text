# INNOCENT FRESHMEN PROVIDE MERRIMENT FOR DEAN'S OFFICES
## 
### 
Stanford women were agog
wilh excitement the other day
in the Dean of Women's office
when a timid, retiring freshman
of the opposite sex walked shyly
up to Miss Boetzinger's desk and
asked if he might sign up theru
for a room on the fifth deck of
Encina.
The women decided he had
taken seriously all that the spon
sors and presidents aud directors
and what not had told him about
"getting on the boat."
Freshmen loitering around the
Dean of Men's office also got a
slight shock when a blushing
co-ed requested that her room
reservation for Encina Hall be
cancelled. It was explained that
the mistake occurred because of
the fact that the lady's name had
a distinctly masculine flavor.
