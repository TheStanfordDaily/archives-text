The intramural basketball tourna
-Inent got off to a flying start yester
day on the Encina Gym floor, with
"Sequoia I dusting off the Delta Chi
five, 16-13, in a remarkably fast and
well-played game. The Phi Psi's took
the fat end of a 9-4 score to win from
Phi Sigma Kappa in the second en
counter, and a dozen or so excited
freshmen from Encina 3d floor, west,
were left holding the sack when El
Capitan failed to appear. They accord
ingly received the game by forfeit. No
games were scheduled for the evening.
Paxton, Delta Chi, was high-point
scorer'in the opener, sinking the ball
for four goals and a foul throw. His
shots had given Delta Chi seven points
at the half, with Sequoia leading by
one tally. From this time on, both
teams pepped up and the scoring was
rapid and alternated between baskets,
with both quintets dashing madly up
and down the floor. Cook's, Todd's and
Stimpson's combined efforts were a
little better than what Paxton, New
comb, and Rowles could offer, and the
Hall team had increased its lead by
three points when the tilt ended.
Sequoia showed promise of making a
serious bid for laurels in League I.
Todd and Giffen, forwards, and Cook,
center, make a slippery combination
of tossers. Both teams appeared better
than the Phi Psi's or Phi Sig's.
The encounter between the latter
two teams was a rather unpolished
exhibition. Copious use of substitutes
was indulged in by the Phi Sig man
ager, and practically the entire per
sonnel of the-«local chapter saw action
before the game ended. An indication
of the sloppy nature of the play may
be drawn from the fact that nine
points of the total of fourteen scored
by both teams were gained from foul
shots. The four Phi Sigma tallies came
exclusively by this means. Wisely and
Price were the scorers of the two
Phi Psi goals. The Phi Sig's committed
nine fouls and the Phi Psi's six.
This afternoon will see Encina 2E
matched against Sequoia II; Alpha
Sigma Phi against El Toro; and Theta
Chi against Zeta Psi. The first game
begins promptly at 4:15 o'clock.

be drawn from the fact that nine
points of the total of fourteen scored
by both teams were gained from foul
shots. The four Phi Sigma tallies came
exclusively by this means. Wisely and
Price were the scorers of the two
Phi Psi goals. The Phi Sig's committed
nine fouls and the Phi Psi's six.
This afternoon will see Encina 2E
matched against Sequoia II; Alpha
Sigma Phi against El Toro; and Theta
Chi against Zeta Psi. The first game

Intramdral Basketball Results
Sequoia I, 16; Delta Chi, 13.
Phi Kappa Psi, 9; Phi Sigma Kappa, 4.
El Capitan forfeited to Encina 3W.
The intramural basketball tourna
-Inent got off to a flying start yester
day on the Encina Gym floor, with
"Sequoia I dusting off the Delta Chi
five, 16-13, in a remarkably fast and
well-played game. The Phi Psi's took
the fat end of a 9-4 score to win from
Phi Sigma Kappa in the second en
counter, and a dozen or so excited
freshmen from Encina 3d floor, west,
were left holding the sack when El
Capitan failed to appear. They accord
ingly received the game by forfeit. No
games were scheduled for the evening.
Paxton, Delta Chi, was high-point
scorer'in the opener, sinking the ball
for four goals and a foul throw. His
shots had given Delta Chi seven points
at the half, with Sequoia leading by
one tally. From this time on, both
teams pepped up and the scoring was
rapid and alternated between baskets,
with both quintets dashing madly up
and down the floor. Cook's, Todd's and
Stimpson's combined efforts were a
little better than what Paxton, New
comb, and Rowles could offer, and the
Hall team had increased its lead by
three points when the tilt ended.
Sequoia showed promise of making a
serious bid for laurels in League I.
Todd and Giffen, forwards, and Cook,
center, make a slippery combination
of tossers. Both teams appeared better
than the Phi Psi's or Phi Sig's.
The encounter between the latter
two teams was a rather unpolished
exhibition. Copious use of substitutes
was indulged in by the Phi Sig man
ager, and practically the entire per
sonnel of the-«local chapter saw action
before the game ended. An indication
of the sloppy nature of the play may
be drawn from the fact that nine
points of the total of fourteen scored
by both teams were gained from foul
shots. The four Phi Sigma tallies came
exclusively by this means. Wisely and
Price were the scorers of the two
Phi Psi goals. The Phi Sig's committed
