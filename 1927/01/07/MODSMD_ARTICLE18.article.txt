# RALPH LUTZ RETURNS FROM EUROPEAN TOUR WITH WAR MATERIAL
## Professor Spends Months in Search of Documents For Hoover Library 
### 
Professor Ralph H. Lutz of the
Stanford History department, Chair
man of the Directors of the Hoover
War Library, has just returned from
Europe where he has been continu
ously travelling since June, collecting
for the Hoover War Library govern
ment documents, unofficial publica
tions such as books and pamphlets,
periodicals and manuscripts from pri
vate collections of participants in the
great war, and certain archives bear
ing 011 this period. Much of this ma
terial is of a confidential nature and
will not be available for research for
from twenty to forty years.
Professor Lutz was also authorized
by Mr. George Clark, Director of Uni
versity Libraries, to secure collections
of English, French, Italian, and Ger
man works bearing upon the political
history of modern Europe.
Secures Documents
Besides making purchases Professor
Lutz acquired a number of important
gifts of documents from several na
tions, particularly Belgium, where the
former minister of finance, Francqui,
made special efforts in his behalf.
The Hoover War Library has for
several years had an exchange agree
ment with European institutes of re
search and Professor Lutz negotiated
some important exchanges with sev
eral of these institutes in Germany
and France. During his trip he visited
practically every country in Europe
obtaining these documents bearing on
the great war and the reconstruction
period following it.
The Stanford professor arrived in
Naples the day after the attempt to
assassinate Mussolini in Bologna and
found a holiday had been declared
with much rejoicing that the leader's
life had been spared.
Professor Lutz regards Mussolini as
a great constructive statesman whose
government may be likened to Cae
sarism in modern form. During his
reign he has brought his country out
of chaos into the path of progress, ac
cording to Professor Lutz, and has
improved the finances, public service,
national defense, and the foreign
policy of Italy. All foreign diplomats
spoke highly of Mussolin to Professor
Lutz. It is his belief that the majority
of the Italians are back of the new
leader and his Fascist regime, al
though he says no one can predict
with certainty whether the new gov
ernment will be permanent.
New Spirit in France
Speaking of France, Professor Lutz
praised Poincaire as a great leader
who had saved the nation from almost
certain economic disaster this summer
and under whom the parliamentary
form of government is proving a suc
cess since the formation of his coali
tion cabinet. Professor Lutz says there
has been a great improvement in
France since his last visit there in
1924. He noted great economic re
covery, restoration of the devastated
areas, and a new spirit of confidence
in France, and he believes that the
economic and political future of the
country is secure. This new spirit was
the same in practically all of the
countries, he says.
Germany Recovering
Germany is two years ahead of
France in stabilizing her industries
and is well on the way to economic
recovery. Professor Lutz found a great
deal of unemployment there, and some
inefficiency owing to the change in
the form of government, but he be
lieves that in another quarter century
Germany will be again the great eco
nomic power on the continent.
