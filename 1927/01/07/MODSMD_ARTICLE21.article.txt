Tomorrow night in the pavilion
Stanford's varsity quintet will have
its second chance for a victory on the
home court when St. Mary's lines up
against the Cardinals. Tho freshman
five meets Pacific Grove High School
in the preliminary.
Having muffed the first chance pre
sented by the Branch Tuesday to show
the home folks how to win a game,
Hunt's men are pointing to the contest
tomorrow night and are in much bet
ter shape. This afternoon's practice in
the pavilion will be a light one, de
voted largely to rehearsing several
new plays and to shooting fouls.
St. Mary's Experienced
St. Mary's bring? an experienced
team to meet the Cardinals. This will
be the first time since 1923 that the
two teams have clashed. Most of last
year's five have returned and though
the outfit did not show up so well last
year, it has been practicing basketball
since Thanksgiving. Dutch Conlon and
Slip Madigan have been coaching the
aggregation.
With Fred Price back in court togs,
Hunt may start him as running mate
to Captain Nelson David at the for
ward berths. Two other men, McCand
less and Bryant, both capable per
formers, are also on tap for the Cardi
nal mentor. What starting lineup
Husky Hunt will use is a thing he will
determine at the last minute.
Jayred May Start
Jayred, who started at center
against the Southern Branch, will in
all probability line up at the initial
whistle in tomorrow's game. Dobson
also saw action Tuesday in this berth
and has proved himself a capable al
ternate to Jayred.
Should St. Mary's prove to have a
capable attacking team. Hunt plans
to use Ned Anderson at standing guard
and A 1 Biaggini at running guard.
Both men in this case will play back
in their own territory. On the other
hand, should the Saints not be so
powerful on offensive work, Vincenti
will probably supplant Biaggini an 1
will play more forward to be a greater
threat to the visitors.
Biaggini's work in guarding Ketch
um. of Branch was one of the best
examples of individual playing ex
hibited against the Bruins. Ketchum
was held to one field goal but ran up
his scoring by sinking free throws.
This was perhaps one of the reasons
why Williams, the other Bruin for
ward, was able to get by to sink three
field goals.
What form of defense the Saints
will use is unknown. Most of the
teams which the Cardinals met in
their southern tour during the Christ
mas holidays employed the five-man
or zone defense and the Cards had
become accustomed to this formation.
However, Tuesday the Branch quintet
used the man-for-man defense and thus
caught Hunt's men unprepared for
this. Now that the Cards have had
experience under fire with both sys
tems they are better prepared to han
dle whichever mode the Saints should
choose.
The Cardinal mentor since the
Branch game has been grooming his
men on getting the sphere on held
balls and on out-of-bounds plays. Plays
from the foul line, either of offensive
or defensive nature, have come in for
their share of attention. Drill on shoot
ing fouls has also been given the men.
Summing it up: when St. Mary's
meets the Cardinals they will face a
team which has been given ample op
portunity to brush up on the weak
nesses displayed Tuesday night. In all,
Hunt's Cardinals should be at least
twenty per cent better than they were
against the Branch.
