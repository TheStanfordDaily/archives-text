Tomorrow night in the pavilion
Stanford's varsity quintet will have
its second chance for a victory on the
home court when St. Mary's lines up
against the Cardinals. Tho freshman
five meets Pacific Grove High School
in the preliminary.
Having muffed the first chance pre
sented by the Branch Tuesday to show
the home folks how to win a game,
Hunt's men are pointing to the contest
tomorrow night and are in much bet
ter shape. This afternoon's practice in
the pavilion will be a light one, de
voted largely to rehearsing several
new plays and to shooting fouls.
St. Mary's Experienced
St. Mary's bring? an experienced
team to meet the Cardinals. This will
be the first time since 1923 that the
two teams have clashed. Most of last
year's five have returned and though
the outfit did not show up so well last
year, it has been practicing basketball
since Thanksgiving. Dutch Conlon and
Slip Madigan have been coaching the
aggregation.
With Fred Price back in court togs,
Hunt may start him as running mate
to Captain Nelson David at the for
ward berths. Two other men, McCand
less and Bryant, both capable per
formers, are also on tap for the Cardi
nal mentor. What starting lineup
Husky Hunt will use is a thing he will
determine at the last minute.
Jayred May Start
Jayred, who started at center
against the Southern Branch, will in
all probability line up at the initial
whistle in tomorrow's game. Dobson
also saw action Tuesday in this berth
and has proved himself a capable al
ternate to Jayred.
Should St. Mary's prove to have a
capable attacking team. Hunt plans
to use Ned Anderson at standing guard
and A 1 Biaggini at running guard.
