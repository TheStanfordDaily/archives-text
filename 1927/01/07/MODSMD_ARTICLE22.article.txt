# EXTRA TWO WEEKS IS GIVEN COMPOSERS TO WRITE JUNIOR OPERA
## 
### 
Since not as much time will be
needed for the development of the
book and the completion of the other
work necessary for the production of
the Junior Opera as it was previously
supposed, the deadline for the accept
: ance of plots for the play has been
! changed from January 16 to the last
i day of the month. However this will
be the final day for turning them in,
: and not one received after this date
, will be considered by the committee,
j according to 11. Frank Baker, chalr
| man.
Plots may be based either on a cos
tume play or a more modern musical
comedy farce. The latter type is pre
j ferred, however, as it is felt by the
members of the committee that the
costume type has been overdone in
the last few years.
Baker requests all those submitting
plots to turn them in to him at Box
1357 as soon as possible in spite of
j the extra two weeks, ps the earlier
they are in the hands of the commit
tee, the more careful consideration
will they receive. Anyone who does
not understand just what is wanted
is asked to speak to Baker at the
Alpha Sigma Phi house.
