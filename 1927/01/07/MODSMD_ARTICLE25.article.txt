# Stanford vs. St. Mary's
## 
### 
Stanford and St. Marys will resume athletic relations tomorrow
night when the basketball teams of the two institutions meet in the
pavilion. It has been a number of years since the two schools have faced
each other either on the football field, the baseball diamond, or the
basketball court, the last grid match being in 1922 when the Cards
triumphed by a score of 9 to 0.
The basketball contest is only the first of a series of major sports
to be resumed, for it will be followed with baseball games between the
two colleges in the spring and with a football match early next fall.
There is also the possibility of a track meet if St. Mary's can scrape
together a squad of any real strength.
Sport enthusiasts in the ]>ay region have been bewailing the fact that
St. Mary's and Stanford have not been meeting in athletic contests. But
no group of people on the Pacific coast is as glad that relations have been
resumed as Stanford students. St. Mary's possesses strength in football,
basketball, and baseball, and the Cardinal followers realize that another
good competitor in this region will help to improve our teams as well
as add to the interest of the sport season.
1 here is nothing as bad for a team as easy preliminary games. A
good example of the results of walk-away early contests is the
showing of the University of Southern California in football during the
past few years. The Trojans work out on Whittier, Calteck, Pomona,
and the other small colleges in the south, and naturally run up large
scores. !he team becomes overconfident, despite the warning of the
coaches, and when a real match comes along—a conference game when
winning is important—the team goes to pieces. The men cannot stand
up under the strain, as they could if hard games had been placed in the
preliminary season.
In this section of the state there are very few colleges with teams of
any strength. So it is essential that Stanford take advantage of the few
strong squads. St. Mary's is certainly a powerful athletic institution.
