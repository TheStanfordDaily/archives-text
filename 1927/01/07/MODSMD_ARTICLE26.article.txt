# "College Days"â€”Blah!
## 
### 
When the moving picture "Brown of Harvard" appeared last year,
Harvard University rose up in arms and protested. And now the same
producer comes out with another picture of university life called "College
Days,'' and Stanford should rise up and object. For "College Days" is
a story of campus life at the universities of Stanford and California.
"College Days" is a typical college story with the opponents' football
team leading 3 to 0 with a minute to play. And then our hero is thrown
into the game, and he races yards and yards to a touchdown and thus
wins the contest 6 to 3. We are not crying because the producer had
California win the game, or because the Stanford rooting section looked
like a Salinas or Stockton high school cheer section, but we are opposed
to the whole idea of moving picture producers trying to portray the life
at Stanford and California when they know nothing at all about their
subject.
The pictures of the Stanford campus must have been taken in some
back yard in Los Angeles; at least they do not look familiar to us. Any
Stanford student has a right to object to seeing Stanford life portrayed
as it is pictured in "College Days."
