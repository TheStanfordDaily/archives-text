A FOREIGN CRITIC

We take it for granted that the ;
gentle reader has availed himself of
the opportunity, offered in yesterday's
paper, of discovering what a "boy
from the Far East" thinks about
America.
What the "boy," who signs himself
T. Shudo, thinks about America is |
interesting in itself. More interesting
is the contrast between the opinions
of this writer and the average Ameri
can-born college student.
While he missed a lot of good points,
Shudo has hit the nail on the head
in several instances. His opinions am
interesting.

Scholarships and Skyrockets

Also in yesterday's paper was a
comment from John Reid, '30, who
regrets the fact that a successful ;
scholar does not enjoy the public ova- I
tion accorded the distinguished ath- |
lete.
In a way it might seem a shame j
that brilliant scholars often live and
die in obscurity while athletes receive
the plaudits of the rabble. But we are
inclined to wonder what great contri- I
butions have been made to the sum ;
total of human knowledge by scholars ;
spurred on by two thousand rooters
wearing hats.
