### The King 
Only seven women out of 1513 at
the University of Kansas would admit
in a recent questionnaire that they
prefer matrimony and home-making to
any one of ninety-seven other ways to
wrest three squares a day from a
hard world.
We do not feel rashly unjustified in
predicting, however, that at least ten
of the young ladies will eventually
change their minds.
♦ * *
The fiat has gone out in Moscow
denouncing American dances for the
Soviet youth. The Charleston is de
scribed as an "indecent product of the
fat American bourgeoisie."
* $ *
Not the very fat, however.
* * *
Incidentally, just as one cultured
product of American higher education
to another, can't you pronounce that
word "bourgeoise" either?
♦ ♦ *
Should be quite a party the A.W.S.
are putting on next week. Half the

| women are to wear men's costumes.
With trousers covering clear clown to
their ankles, sleeves to their wrists,
and collars, the "more modest" sex
should feel comfortably mid-Victorian.
* * * •»
But in reality the women will get
tingling little thrills of being so dar
ing and just a little bit wicked.
* * *
Which indicates no more of course,
| than that modesty, like morality, is
1 an acquired taste.

There's just one trouble with these
, great gifts of money that titans of
finance donate to universities. There
are becoming fewer of them. It seems
1 nowadays that instead of going
through the regular process of quit
ting school at the age of 14, practicing
frugality, industry, and honesty, and
thus reaping the reward of millions to
give to colleges which everybody
| knows from the American magazine
always results, all the poor boys keep
trying to stay in school.
Something should be done about it.
