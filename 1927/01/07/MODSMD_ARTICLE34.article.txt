# Terpsichore Helps Love Claims German Pathologist
## 
### 
In a recent lecture on dancing as an
expression of primitive sex impulses,
Dr. Magnus Hirschfield, famed psycho
pathologist of Berlin, said that "more
marriages are concluded on the dance
floor than in heaven. Hence the
church's opposition is due to fear of
rivalry."
I)r. Hirschfield remarked further in
the course of his lecture:
"Nobody should marry a person with
whom he or she does not enjoy danc
ing.
"The love-life of folk who do not
dance usually deviates from normalcy.
"Dancing should be a pleasure, not
a mania."
