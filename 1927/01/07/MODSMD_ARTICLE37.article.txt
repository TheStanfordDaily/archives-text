"The Guardsman," Pendragon Players,
Palo Alto.
Molnar has written a charming piece
in "The Guardsman" and, barring a
few small mistakes, the players have
interpreted his efforts very creditably.
The situation, the Actor acting a part
to deceive his wife, is made different
by the discovery that the wife is doing
a little acting on her own account.
Oliver Kisicli, as the Actor, carries
an extremely difficult role through a
variety of emotions without over-em
phasizing any portion of it. He bur
lesques bis Russian guardsman just
enough; his emotional Hungarian ac
tor holds true to the pathetically sin
cere manner of an actor who acts
everything he does.
Sharp comments are furnished by
the Critic, played by Charles Brown,
comments which aptly fill in the
breaks in conversation and make for
i quicker continuity of action. The
Critic is much influenced by the Act
ress, who has only to look at him to
make him say what she wants —always
ko her benefit —with devastating effect
jon the Actor.
One of the cleverest denouements
j of comedy is used in the last act of
j the play. The Actor, in order to prove
j to his wife that he has played a dual
j role, puts on his guardsman disguise
and confronts her. The result is ludi
crous in the extreme, for, as she says,
one minute after he comes in she has
recognized him, two minutes after she
is prepared to laugh at him, and three
minutes after she decided to carry the
I comedy through to completion. This
j disclosure puts the poor man in a sub
j dued, thoroughly chastened manner,
and he is ready to forgive her for any
suspicions he ever held. Deep insight
is carried in Molnar's line, "Your kiss
betrayed you—l'd know that any
where."
