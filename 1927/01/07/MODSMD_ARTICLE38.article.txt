# Washington Coach Claims Athletes Too Pampered
## 
### 
Modern colleges are pampering
I their athletes to a point that is unfair
j to the men themselves, in the belief
of Coach "Rusty" Callow, of the Uni
j versity of Washington championship
J crew.
In a special interview given to the
i University of Southern California
I
| Trojan, he said:
"We are pampering our athletes,
j Athletic prowess may help a man to
j get a job but it will never help him
iiold it. The football player should
take his place in the student body with
i his fellows. Why should he have a
lot of gratuities heaped upon him just
because he plays football?"
In regard to men keeping their
sweatshirts at the end of the season,
Coach Callow stated:
"I've never lost a sweatshirt. When
the men turn out at the beginning of
the season I tell them that any man
who thinks that the university owes
him a shirt can go right back up the
hill. They never quit and I have never
lost a shirt."
