# CHINESE DIET EQUALS NUTRITIVE VALUE OF MENUS OF AMERICA
## 
### 
Chinese foods such as water chest
nuts, bamboo shoots, Foo Kwa, dried
duck, and other Oriental delicacies
may not appeal to the American pal
ate, yet they are fully as nutritious as
any American favorite such as "ham
and," "sinkers," or "hot dogs." Miss
Asta Ohn, a graduate student in tlio
Household Science Department of the
University of California, has reached
these conclusions after completing a
study of the nutritive value of Oriental
foods.
"The most striking difference in the
composition of the Chinese menu, as
compared to that of the American, is
the lack of dairy products, milk, but
ter, and cheese; the lack of water
served at meals, the substitution of tea
for coffee, and the very small amounts
of sugar. The Oriental diet contains
more rice, sweet potato, and taro than
wheat products and Irish potato; more
pork, fowl, especially duck, duck eggs,
and iish and fish by-products than
beef and mutton; more peanut oil than
olive oil; and more orchard and gar
den fruits than vineyard fruits. The
Orientals also use many sea plants,"
says Miss Ohn.
The similarities of Oriental and
American food lie rather in the type
than the kind of food and the method
of food preparation. The Oriental's
pineapple-chicken is not unlike the
American's apple fritters or apple
sauce and pork.
Some of the nutritive advantages of
the Oriental diet are derived from the
careful boiling and steaming of foods
which preserves the vitamine and min
eral content of foods. Also the water
in which foods are cooked is never
wasted by the Oriental.
