"Southern Albania in European Af
fairs, 1912-1923," is the title of a book
by Edith P. Stickney, Ph.D., Stanford,
*24, just published by the University
Press.
The manuscript for this work was
awarded the George L. Bear Prize by
the American Historical Association
in 1925, one of the highest honors
granted by the association. The prize
essay is a revision of Dr. Stickney's
Ph.D. thesis, done under Professor
K. I). Adams in 1923 and 1924. Accord
ing to Professor Adams, this is the sec
ond time that a Stanford history Ph.D.
lias been awarded a prize by the
association. The awards committee,
moreover, was unanimous in its de
cision on Dr. Stickney's essay.
The study considers the history of
Albanian nationalism from 1912, when
the question first assumed real diplo
matic importance, to 1923. Southern
Albania was "one of many long-dis
puted areas dangerous to the peace
of Europe, involving rival nationalist
claims, as well as the interests of
several of the Great Powers."
The problem was considered by the
Paris Peace Conference and the
League of Nations, and the present
study gains interest through affording
practical examples of the functioning
of these two bodies. The book also
throws new light on recent stormy
happenings in Albania.
The study is based on sources from
the Hoover War Library at Stanford,
including much material hitherto un
published, a wealth of diplomatic
documents, and the secret miuutes of
the Council of Ten.
The book is of 195 pages, with 8
maps and a frontispiece.
