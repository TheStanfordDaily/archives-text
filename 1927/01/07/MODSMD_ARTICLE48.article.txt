# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The great American indoor game of
basketball has its freak shots, the
same as golf, tennis, and other out
door sports. Listen to these examples
if you don't believe that "anything
can happen in basketball."
In an intramural game played at
Illinois State Normal University last
March, a most uncommon play oc
curred. One player threw the ball to
a team-mate who was not expecting to
receive it. The pass hit him on top
of the head and bounced high into the
air and squarely through the hoop for
a field goal! Claude S. Miller, the
referee, credited the thrower of the
pass with the basket, but wasn't at all
sure that he was right. Some thought
that the man whose head the ball hit
should at least have received an assist!

Pat Page, now football coach at the \
University of Indiana, made a startling
play in 1908 while a member of the i
University of Chicago basketball team. ;
Pat was little, but his fighting spirit!
made him one of the stars of his day
in three different sports. In a game
with the University of Pennsylvania
team for the so-called "national inter
collegiate title," Chicago was one
point behind and there was only a
minute to play. Pat then got hold of
the ball after a mad scramble, but
some opponent jostled him off-balance.
He let fly for the basket just the same,
shooting the ball between his legs like
the center does in football, and thus ;
scored oner of the freakest goals in all
basketball history, winning the game
for dear old Chicago.

A year or two later, it was a Penn
man who figured in "a play for the
books," and a victory for his alma
mater. Flint, one of the best forwards
in Red and Blue history, dribbled the
ball down the court in a game with
Columbia until rudely spilled by a ,

( tough wearer of the Light Blue
i named Ryan. Lying flat on his back
he shot the ball through the hoop
without even touching the backboard,
and Penn won by that shot!
I In 1912, the Be Neri team of pro
fessional fame, boasted a great center
I ,
named Bill Keenan. In one game, Bill
; made the equivalent of a hole-in-one
at golf and batted a goal from the
toss-up!

Freak Basketball
The great American indoor game of
basketball has its freak shots, the
same as golf, tennis, and other out
door sports. Listen to these examples
if you don't believe that "anything
can happen in basketball."
In an intramural game played at
Illinois State Normal University last
March, a most uncommon play oc
curred. One player threw the ball to
a team-mate who was not expecting to
receive it. The pass hit him on top
of the head and bounced high into the
air and squarely through the hoop for
a field goal! Claude S. Miller, the
referee, credited the thrower of the
pass with the basket, but wasn't at all
sure that he was right. Some thought
that the man whose head the ball hit
should at least have received an assist!

Pat Page, now football coach at the \
University of Indiana, made a startling
play in 1908 while a member of the i
University of Chicago basketball team. ;
Pat was little, but his fighting spirit!
made him one of the stars of his day
in three different sports. In a game
with the University of Pennsylvania
team for the so-called "national inter
collegiate title," Chicago was one
point behind and there was only a
minute to play. Pat then got hold of
the ball after a mad scramble, but
some opponent jostled him off-balance.
He let fly for the basket just the same,
shooting the ball between his legs like
the center does in football, and thus ;
scored oner of the freakest goals in all
basketball history, winning the game
for dear old Chicago.

A year or two later, it was a Penn
man who figured in "a play for the
books," and a victory for his alma
mater. Flint, one of the best forwards
in Red and Blue history, dribbled the
ball down the court in a game with
Columbia until rudely spilled by a ,

( tough wearer of the Light Blue
i named Ryan. Lying flat on his back
he shot the ball through the hoop
without even touching the backboard,
and Penn won by that shot!
