## 
### 
No further eliminations were made in
the tryouts for Masquers' play, held last
night in the Little Theatre. Manuscript
parts have not as yet arrived from New
York, so tryouts will be suspended until
Monday or Tuesday of next week, when
the cast will be chosen, according to Gor
don Davis, dramatic coach.
Those so far successful in passing the
tryouts are: Sarah M. Burns, Louise
Buxton, Edwina Ewing, Barbara Frick,
Dorothy Gamier, Powell Carpenter, Lea
venworth Colby, Douglas C. Gregg, Slim
Hayes, Edmund H. Jones, Stanley Lar
son, George F. Mott, J., Stanley Mullin,
John T. Reid, Byron Harvey, Robert
Sears, Dan T. Smith, Paul L. Speegle,
Robert P. Watkins, and Howard H.
Wickersham.
The production, the name of which
has not yet been announced, is said by
those in charge to be the most ambitious
undertaking Masquers has so far attempt
ed. The play is a recent New York
success offering a great divergency of
characterizations. It was written by a
continental author, and is notable for its
unique style and method of handling,
says Gordon Davis.
A committee headed by Peggy Ran
dall, president of Masquers, is assisting
Davis. Past notable productions given
by Masquers are? "U and 1," "Fashion,"
and "Milestones."
