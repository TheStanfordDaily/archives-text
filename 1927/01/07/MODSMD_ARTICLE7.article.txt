# "NO REMEDY FOR VOLSTEAD ACT" DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
"I see no way to modify the Vol
stead act in any significant measure
without bringing back the saloon, and
it was to abolish the saloon that the
Eighteenth Amendment and the Vol
stead Act were passed."
With these words Dr. Jordan sum
med up the talk which he game last
night on the "Prohibition Question"
at his weekly Thursday Evening Con
ference. A record audience gathered
at his home to hear the lecture.
It is the belief of Dr. Jordan that all
the current agitation for the modifica
tion of the Volstead Act is sponsored
by those who want the saloons back
again. To show how disastrous this
would be he reviewed all of the well
known evils of the old saloon. He
also gave a sordid picture of the evil
effects of the saloons today in the
slums of the large cities of England.
In discussing the present-day prob
lem of the enforcement of prohibition
in the United States, Dr. Jordan said:
"It is the business of the Federal Gov
ernment to shut off the supply of
liqifbr, but it is not its business to
arrest a man for carrying a hip-pocket
flask or taking a drink in public. The
enforcement of such minor affairs
should be left entirely to the local
authorities.
"Sooner or later the different cities
will find that it is their duty and not
that of the Federal Government to
handle actual enforcement of the
minor phases of the law."
Dr. Jordan also considered the sug
gestion that the United States Govern
ment handle directly the sale of liquor.
He said, "The idea that the United
States Government go into the liquor
business is ridiculous. It would be en
tirely too vast and complicated an un
dertaking."
The many recent straw votes for
modification of prohibition are con
sidered by Dr. Jordan to be entirely
too vague regarding any specific meth
ods of amendment.
"All of our large cities are pretty
'wet' today," stated Dr. Jordan, "be
cause tney are full of people who have
come to this country in the steerage
from 'wet' countries, and they can
not get along without their liquor. But
the next generation will see an entire
ly different situation."
