# NO CARD-NAVY GAME PLANNED, SAYS MASTERS
## Manager Admits "Eastern Team" Is Negotiating; No Decision Made RUMORS ARE UNFOUNDED Ingram's Warner's Scouting Gives Rise to Many Speculation 
### 
A 1 Masters, Stanford Graduate Man
ager, put all current rumors at an end
when he announced yesterday that no
game had been scheduled between the
Cardinals and the Navy eleven from
Annapolis.
Speculation started when "Navy Bill"
Ingram, Navy coach, suddenly left his
All-Star team in San Francisco and went
to Pasadena to scout the Stanford-Ala
bama struggle. When it was remem
bered that "Pop" Warner had previous
ly been present at the Army-Navy game
in Chicago, indications pointed for a
meeting of the Redshirts and the Blue
jackets. In spite of all this, there has
been no confirmation of the proposed
game.
The rumor of a Navy-Stanford game
was brought to a head by an article in
one of the San Francisco papers yester
day. The article, however, carried no
statement of fact, save that rumors were
current that such a game was planned
and might be played. Graduate Manager
Masters' statement put a definite end to
the rumors when he said that so such
game had been scheduled. Masters ad
mitted that "an Eastern team" was dick
ering with the Cardinals but stated that
that team was not the Navy and there
was no saying at this date whether the
"Eastern team" would be placed on the
Stanford schedule.
The final football schedule, as an
nounced from the Graduate Manager's
office, comprises nine games, four of
which will be played against conference
teams. All but two contests will be
staged at home. One of the trips will
be made to Seattle, the other to Port
land. Although the latter game, which
will be played with Oregon, was orig
inally intended to take place at Stanford,
it was changed by mutual consent. The
complete schedule is as follows:
September 24—Olympic Club at Stan
ford.
October I—St. Mary's at Stanford.
October &—Nevada at Stanford.
October 15—U.S.C. at Stanford.
October 22—0.A.C. at Portland.

that team was not the Navy and there
was no saying at this date whether the
"Eastern team" would be placed on the
Stanford schedule.
The final football schedule, as an
nounced from the Graduate Manager's
office, comprises nine games, four of
which will be played against conference
teams. All but two contests will be
staged at home. One of the trips will
be made to Seattle, the other to Port
land. Although the latter game, which
will be played with Oregon, was orig
inally intended to take place at Stanford,
it was changed by mutual consent. The
complete schedule is as follows:
September 24—Olympic Club at Stan
ford.
October I—St. Mary's at Stanford.
October &—Nevada at Stanford.
October 15—U.S.C. at Stanford.
October 22—0.A.C. at Portland.
