# RELATIVITY THEORY SUPPORTED BY MOST RECENT EXPERIMENT
## 
### 
Experiments performed at the Mount
Wilson observatory last summer by Dr.
Dayton C. Miller of the Case School of
Applied Science in Cleveland, which
were credited by some authorities with
destroying the Einstein theory, have
been disproved by recent investigations
in Belgium.
Ether Drift
Doctor Miller's experiments were said
to indicate a drift of ether which is
supposed to pervade all space and in
which light travels. This drift was pre
sumably due to thq motion of the earth
in its orbit through the etlter, and the
experiments indicated that, while an al
most negligible result had been obtained
when they were performed at sea-level,
at the mile-high-top of Mt. Wilson there
was an appreciable drift. This varia
tion with height could not be explained
by the Einstein theory.
In Belgium, Dr. Miller's experiment
was repeated at sea level and from a
balloon. A modified form of apparatus
was used, in which the records were
made on a photographic film, instead of
by the eye, as in Millers' apparatus. Two
electrically operated propellers turned
the entire balloon around two or three
times a minute while the experiment was
in progress. The apparatus was illu
minated by the blue radiation of a mer
i cury vapor lamp.
Height Has No Effect
Tt was found that there was an appar
ent ether drift of about four and a third
miles a second. This shows that the
value of the ether drift does not increase
with a greater height above the earth,
which was the chief point of difference
with the relativity theory as pointed out
I by Dr. Miller's experiment at Mt. Wil
son.
