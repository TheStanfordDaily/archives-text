# STANFORD MEN DEBATE WITH PRINCETON DUO
## Cardinals Win by Audience Votes in Forensic Contests RETURN NEXT WEEK Two Weeks' Eastern Tour Is Success for Turkel, Combellack 
### 
Stanford's two-man debating team
now touring the East will take the
floor tonight against the Princeton
varsity in the fifth debate of its
schedule. With tonight's contest the
Cardinal duo, Fred Combellack and
Harry Turkel, enter upon the second
week of their tour, having won audi
ence decisions last week against Har
vard, Yale, and Bowdoin. Combellack
and Turkel will proceed from Prince
ton to the University of Detroit, with
whom they will engage on the 13th,
and the next night will meet the Mar
quette University, Milwaukee, team,
returning to the campus next Monday.
Cards on Affirmative
Arguing the affirmative of the ques
tion, "Resolved, That we have more
to fear than to hope from science,"
the Stanford team met Bowdoin Col
lege last Tuesday night and received
an audience decision of 92 to 69 in
favor of their side of the proposition.
Wednesday night Bates College won
the decision for the negative; Stan
ford then changed sides and upheld
the negative against Harvard, winning
52 to 47 according to the audience
decision. The Yale varsity, upholding
the negative, lost the argument Fri
day night 34 to 95.
No information as to whether the
audience decisions were on the merits
of the question or the merits of the
argument has been received by Pro
fessor James G. Emerson, faculty ad
visor of debate, but it is presumed
that the former basis of judgment pre
vailed. The very fact that Stanford,
arguing the negative against Harvard
and the affirmative against Yale and
Bowdoin, received the approbation of
the majority in each case is "gratify
ing," Professor Emerson admitted.
Bates Wins
The unanimous decision, reported in
the press dispatches as having been
won by Bates, was probably the opin
ion of judges or that of "the janitor
and ushers of the audience," Profes
sor Emerson conjectured.
The Stanford affirmative argument
was outlined last night by Professor
Emerson as follows: Turkel develops
the point that science, by making life
more easy makes it more monotonous;
that artistic creation is incompatible
with science, making it impossible to
develop in this country such artists
as, for instance, Bach, Beethoven, or
Handel; and that science makes
ghastly contributions to the "art" of
warfare.
Beauty Shattered
Combellack follows with the argu
ment that science explains all the
beauty out of life, and it shatters the
poet's dream, leaving nothing but a
wreck of the latter's philosophy; and
that it is doubtful if science, holding
civilization in its hand, can develop
a moral spirit.
The pro-science arguments advanced
when the team upholds the negative
are that science makes possible more
leisure for the pursuance of art.; that
through scientific means culture has
been spread more broadly; and that
the application of the scientific atti
tude to the political and international
field will continue to benefit the world. I

Stanford's two-man debating team
now touring the East will take the
floor tonight against the Princeton
varsity in the fifth debate of its
schedule. With tonight's contest the
Cardinal duo, Fred Combellack and
Harry Turkel, enter upon the second
week of their tour, having won audi
ence decisions last week against Har
vard, Yale, and Bowdoin. Combellack
and Turkel will proceed from Prince
ton to the University of Detroit, with
whom they will engage on the 13th,
and the next night will meet the Mar
quette University, Milwaukee, team,
returning to the campus next Monday.
Cards on Affirmative
Arguing the affirmative of the ques
tion, "Resolved, That we have more
to fear than to hope from science,"
the Stanford team met Bowdoin Col
lege last Tuesday night and received
an audience decision of 92 to 69 in
favor of their side of the proposition.
Wednesday night Bates College won
the decision for the negative; Stan
ford then changed sides and upheld
the negative against Harvard, winning
52 to 47 according to the audience
decision. The Yale varsity, upholding
the negative, lost the argument Fri
day night 34 to 95.
No information as to whether the
audience decisions were on the merits
of the question or the merits of the
argument has been received by Pro
fessor James G. Emerson, faculty ad
visor of debate, but it is presumed
that the former basis of judgment pre
vailed. The very fact that Stanford,
arguing the negative against Harvard
and the affirmative against Yale and
Bowdoin, received the approbation of
the majority in each case is "gratify
ing," Professor Emerson admitted.
Bates Wins
The unanimous decision, reported in
the press dispatches as having been
won by Bates, was probably the opin
ion of judges or that of "the janitor
and ushers of the audience," Profes
sor Emerson conjectured.
The Stanford affirmative argument
was outlined last night by Professor
Emerson as follows: Turkel develops
the point that science, by making life
more easy makes it more monotonous;
that artistic creation is incompatible
with science, making it impossible to
develop in this country such artists
as, for instance, Bach, Beethoven, or
Handel; and that science makes
ghastly contributions to the "art" of
warfare.
Beauty Shattered
Combellack follows with the argu
ment that science explains all the
beauty out of life, and it shatters the
poet's dream, leaving nothing but a
wreck of the latter's philosophy; and
that it is doubtful if science, holding
civilization in its hand, can develop
a moral spirit.
The pro-science arguments advanced
when the team upholds the negative
are that science makes possible more
leisure for the pursuance of art.; that
through scientific means culture has
been spread more broadly; and that
the application of the scientific atti
tude to the political and international
field will continue to benefit the world. I
