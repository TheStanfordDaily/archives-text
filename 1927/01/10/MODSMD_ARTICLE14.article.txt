# SEARSVILLE STILL FIVE FEET BELOW OVERFLOW LEVEL
## 
### 
"Searsville Lake needs about
five more feet to start the over
flow into Lagunita," said Fred
Frohe, foreman of outside proper
ties, when asked how long it will
he before the lake would be filled.
The water in the creek has
started lo run and another pood
rain should cause a considerable
flow of water into Lagunita,
Freho added. At the present time
there is a slight seepage in the
lake bed accumulated from the
recent rains.
Last year the lake was ready
for canoeing by February 15.
