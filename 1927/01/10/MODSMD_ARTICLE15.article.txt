the San Jose course. Three of the
Cardinal players scored in the 70's,

longer than any before seen on the
San Jose course made by either ama
teur or professional. Myberg's score
was 75, as was that of Bob Syer, Jr.,
who is acting manager of the Cardi
nals. A 79 was the next best mark
for the winners, made by Ward Ed
wards.

team were as follows: Douglas White
SO, Robert Vermilya 80, A 1 Purkiss 83,
