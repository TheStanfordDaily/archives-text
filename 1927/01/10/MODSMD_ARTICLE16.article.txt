# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB HEARS RALSTON ON INTERNATIONAL LAW
## 
### 
Speaking on 'Foundations of Inter
national Law," Jackson Harvey Ralston,
internationally known lawyer, will pre
sent some of his theories of what is
and what is not international law when
he talks before an open meeting of the
Cosmopolitan Club in the Women's Club
house at 7:45 o'clock tonight.
Believing that much which is not in
ternational law passes as such, Ralston
will show that the foundations of such
law have not been properly laid down
nor founded upon reason or on the prin
ciple of the highest good for the in
dividual and for the nation.
Ralston, who is living in Palo Alto at
the present time, has been active in the
settlement of several international dis
putes, acting as umpire for the Italian
claims against Venezuela before the
mixed tribunal at Caracas in 1903.
In the case of the Pious Fund of
the Californias against Mexico, the first
dispute submitted to the Permanent
Court of Arbitration at The Hague un
der The Hague Peace Convention of
1899, Ralston was American agent.
"International Arbitral Law and Pro
cedure" is the title of a book published
by the speaker in 1909.
