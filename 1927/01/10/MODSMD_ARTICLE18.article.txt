# POOR SCHOLARSHIP FAILS TWO WOMEN, NINETY-THREE MEN

Ninety-five students finished
the fall quarter by journeying
down the immortal road which
"leads down, off, and out." Only
two of those taking the well-trav
eled route were women. More
than a hundred were put 011
probation.
Of the now departed ninety
three men, nine were first-quarter
freshmen, forty-six were lower
division, thirty-two were upper
division, and eight were gradu
ates.
It seems that the fall quarter
average is weakening. Last year
it was seventy-eight men and one
woman. The records have one
redeeming feature, however. They
disclose a constant improvement
in the scholastic ability of the
freshman classes during the last
three years.
