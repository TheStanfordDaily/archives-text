# BABE QUINTET LOSES FIRST CONTEST TO PACIFIC GROVE HIGH
## Freshmen Take Early Lead; Opponents Come Back To Win 
### George Storey 
The Stanford Frosh lost their first
basketball game Saturday night when
the Pacific Grove High School quintet
nosed them out 17 to 14 in a preliminary
to the Stanford-St. Mary's contest.
The first year men started well, and
at the end of the first quarter they were
leading 5 to 0, but the high schoolers
came back in the second eight-minute
session and outscored the Frosh 11 points
to 3, taking an 11 to 8 lead as the gun
ended the half.
The 1930 squad fought hard during
the remainder of the contest, and once
managed to tie the score, but the Pacific
Grove lads regained their lead and held
it during the remainder of the game.
Coaches Hunt and Mitchell used many
men during the evening, giving fifteen
Frosh had a chance to show their ability
under fire, in order to gain a better
knowledge of their material. The Fresh
man have been practicing for only one
week, and considering this fact they
showed up very well.
Their team work was ragged at times,
but they also showed flashes of speed
and the mentors were satisfied that more
practice would even off the rough spots.
This week the first year men will play
three games, one Wednesday, another
Friday, and a third on Saturday, all of
which will be preliminaries to the varsity
games. At the end of the week, after
having given all the men a chance in
at least one of these three games, Hunt
and Mitchell expect to start work de
veloping a team which will be able to
give more than a good account of itself.
