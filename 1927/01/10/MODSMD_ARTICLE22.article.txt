# SAINTS DOWNED UNDER SPEEDY CARD ASSAULT
## Ball Kept Near Enemy Goal Most of Game; Short Tosses Are Poor JAYRED IN GOOD FORM Stanford Easily Outclasses Opposition and Redeems Defeat by Branch 
### Fred Speers 
Uncovering a speedy, long pass at
tack, Stanford's varsity basketball
quintet downed St. Mary's team by 32
points to 18 in the pavilion Saturday
night. The Saints at no time held
more than a one-point while at
half time the Cardinals led 13 to 10.
Stanford clearly outclassed its op
ponents as the game progressed, only
at one time letting down in the play.
This was near the close of the first
half, but the weakening did not last
long enough to endanger the Cardinal
lead.
Jayred Tallies
Wally Jayred, Card center, ran wild
Saturday, sinking six field goals to tie
for point honors with Tazer, Saint
forward. The Saint ace, however, ran
up his score largely with free throws.
At the very outset the game showed
promise of a battle to come. Linares,
Red and Black forward, started the
scoring by sinking a free throw on
McCandless' foul. Underhill followed
with another lone point, and then the
Cards were off. Jayred and McCand
less netting field goals in quick play
ing.
Though the Saints were large and
heavy men, they were speedy players,
though not enough for Hunt's Cardi
nals who kept the ball down in St.
Mary's territory to continually threat
en with short shots at the basket.
Stanford still showed weakness in this
department, however.
Cards Open Up
As the first half wore on the Cardi
nals opened up a brilliant long pass
ing attack and displayed effectively
some new plays handed out to them
by Husky Hunt. McCandless, playing
a speedy game, in one case sank a
field goal as the ball bounced off the
basket from Bryant's foul shot.
This put Stanford in the lead, 10
to 7, and seemed to spur St. Mary's on
and, as the pistol ending the half
sounded, the visitors were staging a
stiff attack under the Cardinal basket.
The second half was marred con
siderably by fouls and gave Tazer his
opportunity to run up the Saint score
via the free throw route. During this
period the Saint forward sank five
foul shots to tie the score at 14-all.
Stanford Solves Defense
St. Mary's man-for-man defense
proved more effective in the first
period than in the second. Hunt's men,
on the offensive for the larger portion
of the game, showed that they were
now able to handle this type of play
much more successfully than they did
against the Southern Branch last
Tuesday.
Once ahead, following a short field
goal by Tazer, the' Saints opened with
a threatening attack, but good work
on the part of Jayred and Vincenti,
sent in for Biaggini, checked this
rally and eventually paved the way for
Cardinal scoring, which was delivered
in satisfying fashion. When his men
had amassed a ten-point lead Husky
Hunt sent in a number of substitu
tions who were able, in the five min
utes remaining to hold their oppo
nents to one field goal and to tally
six points themselves. Two of these
men had fouls slapped on them in
quick order for communicating.
Cardinals Improved
In all, Hunt proved to the Cardinal
fans present that his men are far
better basketball players than last
Tuesday's game seemed to indicate.
Though weak in making long shots at
the basket, an attack carried on large
ly by Captain Nelson David, the Car
dinals possess a speedy organized of
fense which in one or two instances
in the St. Mary's game was well nigh
unstoppable.

some new plays handed out to them
by Husky Hunt. McCandless, playing
a speedy game, in one case sank a
field goal as the ball bounced off the
basket from Bryant's foul shot.
This put Stanford in the lead, 10
to 7, and seemed to spur St. Mary's on
and, as the pistol ending the half
sounded, the visitors were staging a
stiff attack under the Cardinal basket.
The second half was marred con
siderably by fouls and gave Tazer his
opportunity to run up the Saint score
via the free throw route. During this
period the Saint forward sank five
foul shots to tie the score at 14-all.
Stanford Solves Defense
St. Mary's man-for-man defense
proved more effective in the first
period than in the second. Hunt's men,
on the offensive for the larger portion
of the game, showed that they were
now able to handle this type of play
much more successfully than they did
against the Southern Branch last
Tuesday.
Once ahead, following a short field
goal by Tazer, the' Saints opened with
a threatening attack, but good work
on the part of Jayred and Vincenti,
sent in for Biaggini, checked this
rally and eventually paved the way for
Cardinal scoring, which was delivered
in satisfying fashion. When his men
had amassed a ten-point lead Husky
Hunt sent in a number of substitu
tions who were able, in the five min
utes remaining to hold their oppo
nents to one field goal and to tally
six points themselves. Two of these
men had fouls slapped on them in
quick order for communicating.
Cardinals Improved
In all, Hunt proved to the Cardinal
fans present that his men are far
better basketball players than last
Tuesday's game seemed to indicate.
Though weak in making long shots at
the basket, an attack carried on large
ly by Captain Nelson David, the Car
dinals possess a speedy organized of
fense which in one or two instances
in the St. Mary's game was well nigh
unstoppable.

Uncovering a speedy, long pass at
tack, Stanford's varsity basketball
quintet downed St. Mary's team by 32
points to 18 in the pavilion Saturday
night. The Saints at no time held
more than a one-point while at

at one time letting down in the play.
This was near the close of the first
half, but the weakening did not last
long enough to endanger the Cardinal
lead.
Jayred Tallies
Wally Jayred, Card center, ran wild
Saturday, sinking six field goals to tie
for point honors with Tazer, Saint
forward. The Saint ace, however, ran
up his score largely with free throws.
At the very outset the game showed
promise of a battle to come. Linares,
Red and Black forward, started the
scoring by sinking a free throw on
McCandless' foul. Underhill followed
with another lone point, and then the
Cards were off. Jayred and McCand

Though the Saints were large and
heavy men, they were speedy players,
though not enough for Hunt's Cardi

Stanford still showed weakness in this
department, however.

better basketball players than last
Tuesday's game seemed to indicate.
Though weak in making long shots at
the basket, an attack carried on large
ly by Captain Nelson David, the Car
dinals possess a speedy organized of
fense which in one or two instances
in the St. Mary's game was well nigh
unstoppable.

Uncovering a speedy, long pass at
tack, Stanford's varsity basketball
quintet downed St. Mary's team by 32
points to 18 in the pavilion Saturday
night. The Saints at no time held
more than a one-point while at
half time the Cardinals led 13 to 10.
Stanford clearly outclassed its op
ponents as the game progressed, only
at one time letting down in the play.
This was near the close of the first
half, but the weakening did not last
long enough to endanger the Cardinal
lead.
Jayred Tallies
Wally Jayred, Card center, ran wild
Saturday, sinking six field goals to tie
for point honors with Tazer, Saint
forward. The Saint ace, however, ran
up his score largely with free throws.
At the very outset the game showed
promise of a battle to come. Linares,
Red and Black forward, started the
scoring by sinking a free throw on
McCandless' foul. Underhill followed
with another lone point, and then the
Cards were off. Jayred and McCand
less netting field goals in quick play
ing.
Though the Saints were large and
heavy men, they were speedy players,
though not enough for Hunt's Cardi
nals who kept the ball down in St.
Mary's territory to continually threat
en with short shots at the basket.
Stanford still showed weakness in this
department, however.
Cards Open Up
As the first half wore on the Cardi
nals opened up a brilliant long pass
ing attack and displayed effectively
some new plays handed out to them
by Husky Hunt. McCandless, playing
a speedy game, in one case sank a
field goal as the ball bounced off the
basket from Bryant's foul shot.
This put Stanford in the lead, 10
to 7, and seemed to spur St. Mary's on
and, as the pistol ending the half
sounded, the visitors were staging a
stiff attack under the Cardinal basket.
The second half was marred con
siderably by fouls and gave Tazer his
opportunity to run up the Saint score
via the free throw route. During this
period the Saint forward sank five
foul shots to tie the score at 14-all.
Stanford Solves Defense
St. Mary's man-for-man defense
proved more effective in the first
period than in the second. Hunt's men,
on the offensive for the larger portion
of the game, showed that they were
now able to handle this type of play
much more successfully than they did
against the Southern Branch last
Tuesday.
Once ahead, following a short field
goal by Tazer, the' Saints opened with
a threatening attack, but good work
on the part of Jayred and Vincenti,
sent in for Biaggini, checked this
rally and eventually paved the way for
Cardinal scoring, which was delivered
in satisfying fashion. When his men
had amassed a ten-point lead Husky
Hunt sent in a number of substitu
tions who were able, in the five min
utes remaining to hold their oppo
nents to one field goal and to tally
six points themselves. Two of these
men had fouls slapped on them in
quick order for communicating.
Cardinals Improved
In all, Hunt proved to the Cardinal
fans present that his men are far
better basketball players than last
Tuesday's game seemed to indicate.
