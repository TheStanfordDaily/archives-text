# SAINTS DOWNED UNDER SPEEDY CARD ASSAULT
## Ball Kept Near Enemy Goal Most of Game; Short Tosses Are Poor JAYRED IN GOOD FORM Stanford Easily Outclasses Opposition and Redeems Defeat by Branch 
### Fred Speers 
Uncovering a speedy, long pass at
tack, Stanford's varsity basketball
quintet downed St. Mary's team by 32
points to 18 in the pavilion Saturday
night. The Saints at no time held
more than a one-point while at
half time the Cardinals led 13 to 10.
Stanford clearly outclassed its op
ponents as the game progressed, only
at one time letting down in the play.
This was near the close of the first
half, but the weakening did not last
long enough to endanger the Cardinal

Stanford still showed weakness in this
department, however.
Cards Open Up
As the first half wore on the Cardi
nals opened up a brilliant long pass
ing attack and displayed effectively
some new plays handed out to them
by Husky Hunt. McCandless, playing
a speedy game, in one case sank a
field goal as the ball bounced off the
basket from Bryant's foul shot.
This put Stanford in the lead, 10
to 7, and seemed to spur St. Mary's on
and, as the pistol ending the half
sounded, the visitors were staging a
stiff attack under the Cardinal basket.
The second half was marred con
siderably by fouls and gave Tazer his
opportunity to run up the Saint score
via the free throw route. During this
period the Saint forward sank five
