# LARGE SQUADS OF WOMEN HOOPSTERS TO START PRACTICE
## 
### 
Women's basketball practice will
start in earnest this afternoon when
about half the players will have their
first light workout. The squads all met
last week, but only to receive prelimi
nary instructions as to eligibility,
training, and practice.
The senior group, although its en
rollment is 16, really has only a little
more than a full team of seniors, the
rest being women of other classes who
are practicing on odd days.
From the juniors, too, the coaches
will be able to pick a first string with
I some definitenese before they can do
1 more than cut the underclass squads
|to about ihe first three teams. The
junior section also numbers 16.
The elimination process in the two
underclass groups will be very slow.
! especially in the freshman squad. The
freshmen, however, will this year have
j one unusual advantage. The coaches,
I being new, do not know very exactly
what are the capabilities of the play
i ers in any class, and so will not per
haps be able to pick the teams as
! oarlv as coaches better acquainted
with the available material. This,
while handicapping the other classes
by cutting down ihe time they will
have for team practice, will give the
! first-year women a start on a moro
J equal foooting with the other teams.
