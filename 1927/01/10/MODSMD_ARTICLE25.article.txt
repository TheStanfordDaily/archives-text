Stanford debaters won a decision over Yale last Thursday night up
holding the affirmative of the question, "Resolved: That there is more
to he feared than hoped from science." Then the next evening the
Stanford men took the other side of the same question and defeated
] larvard. i aking both sides of the subject and winning each time proves
that it was the merits of the arguments rather than merits of the ques
tion that won for Stanford.

I liese victories give Stanford distinction along scholastic lines just
as this year's football team did on the athletic field. To a large por
tion of the public, the only excuse for a university is its scholastic
achievements. When a university wins distinction in football or track,
these people believe that the school is an athletic institution, and studies
are forgotten or left out of the curriculum.
1 hesc people do not seem to think it possible to have both studies
and athletics at the same college. Stanford winning distinctions in both
football and debating this year should show the public that achieve
ments in two lines is at least possible.
Tonight the Stanford debaters will meet Princeton; next Thursday
they debate against Detroit; and Friday they have their last competi
tion against Marquette. If the team is as successful in the next three
arguments as they were in the first ones, the trip can be considered well
worth while, and the debaters deserve much credit.
