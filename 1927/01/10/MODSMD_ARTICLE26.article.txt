# Ten Years Well-Spent

### 
Hasty actions in time of excitement and enthusiasm many times bring
regret. One case involving Dr. Jordan and a well-known newspaperman
has just been brought to light and is noted in the Oregon Emerald.
Early in April, 1917, during the days when the war fever was about
to drive America into the conflict, Dr. David Starr Jordan, president
emeritus of Stanford University, was speaking before the Baltimore
Open Forum, in protest against this country's impending declaration of
war.
Suddenly the doors were opened and a mob of young Baltimore col
lege nfen rushed into the room and broke up the meeting. That ended
Dr. Jordan's speech diat night, but the noted educator, one of the few
opponents of the war who had the courage of his convictions, was not
silenced. He is not alone now in his attitude toward the late conflict.
The leader of the college mob was Carter G. Osburn, who later tasted
war on the battlefields. Today he is managing editor of the Modern
World, a Baltimore magazine. In the latest issue of that publication he
addresses Dr. Jordan in these words:
"I do not apologize to you, sir. No apology is possible for such an
act. I assure you only that experience and maturity have brought me
the poignant realization that you were motivated by the principles of
civilization, while I was motivated by the passions of barbarism.
\ln a democratic nation, assuredly argument should never be stifled
by force. It would have been possible for those differing from you to
meet your arguments with more convincing arguments on the other side.
They chose instead to use me and similar befuddled youths to prevent
you from being heard."
Ten years was not too long a time if Carter Osburn has learned his
lesson well. But we do not choose to be dedactic. The story is interest
ing, and those who care to learn from stories may acquire something
from this.
