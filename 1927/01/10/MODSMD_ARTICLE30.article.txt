FEELING FINES
This year comes the usual amount
of complaint from students who were j
obliged to pay fines for late registra- i
tion. Aside from the question of the
advisability of encouraging the habit
of punctuality in the young and im
pressionable, there is much to be said
concerning this matter of fines.
Granting, without argument, that it
takes a great deal of money to run
tliis University—a great deal more in
fact than may be gathered together
by anything other than the most
vigorous policy—it seems rather a
shame that the administration is not
able to work out a system of dollar- j

snatching that does not leave the
snatchee with the feeling that he has
been picked.

While it is a great deal of satisfac
tion to know that the forces of law
and order on the campus are suffi
ciently reasonable to refrain from the
practice, popular in other communi
ties, of promiscuous etagging of auto
mobiles and lining of drivers, it is un
fortunate that there is not some more
stringent regulation of speedy driving.
A plan that might help is in effect at
the University of Oregon. A local
court lines speeders, and the proceeds
are placed in a student loan fund.
