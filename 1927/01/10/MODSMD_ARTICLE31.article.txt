The Editor, Sir:
It may seem a very small tiling, but
I am so grateful to my unknown bene
factor that I should appreciate the ap
pearance here of my little "K.C.8." •
notice.
My favorite pen was lost as I was
en route across Quad to an early lec
ture this morning. When I reached
home this evening there lay my trusty

Shaeffer, and the rescuer had not
thought to leave his name that I might
thank him.
This sort of spirit is mightily appre
ciated by those of us who make up the
least fifth of Stanford, and I would
express my gratitude for this particu
lar act of kindness and for the general
good will behind the action.
I thank you.
—M. C. B.
