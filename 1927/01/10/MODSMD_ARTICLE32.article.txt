Prcfacc to a Life, by Zona Gale. D. j
Appleton and Company, $2.00.
Zona Gale has brought us another j
novel depicting the small town Ameri
can family of the Middle West. Here j
we find people who are narrow and con-1
servative, who are content only to win j
their daily bread and house their fam-1
ilies in comfort, who marry because their j
fathers have married, and who expect
their children to marry for the same
reason.
Bernard Mead, the central figure of the
plot, must choose between love and j
honor. He chooses the latter even
against his will and against his better i
judgment. He marries Laura, realizing)
that he will be tied to her for life, as I
his father was bound to his mother, or j
even as Laura's father and mother were j
bound together. Yet he is not unhappy ;
in marriage. His business is successful, j
and his wife brings him a home, smug;
contentment, and three chHdren. He |
sees his children grow up about him,:
and knows that they can but go through *
life as lie has.
Well written is this novel. There is j
an amount of human sympathy for these j
middle class people of the West, that
Miss Gale has woven into her plot with !
skill and beauty. Lives of this type we '
see about us every day, and yet Miss J
Gale has the power to present them to
us in a light in which we have never
seen them. She has a clear insight into
human minds and nature which she has j
brought forth with all her artistry in '
'Preface to a Life." E. K.
