"The Kays," Margaret Deland. Harper
and Brothers, Publishers. $2.00.
In "The Kays," Margaret Deland i
reaches the highest point in her j
career. It is a story of greater dramatic !
power and originality of plot than any I
other of her novels —even "The Awak- >
ening of Helena Richie" or "The
Vehement Flame." The characters are |
exceptionally well drawn; Mrs. Be
hind makes them clear in a single sen-;
tence.
The scene is laid in Old Chester as
it is in so many of Mrs. Deland's
books, hut the chief characters are j
new. Dr. "Willy" King and Dr. Laven
lar, howev r, appear as old friends
to the public.
R~lir»icus Principles
Motif rf Storv
The Kays live in a silent, mournful- j
looking old stone houso on Main
Street Male Kay, though the veteran
of but one war, is always the soldier. '
He Is in rather bad favor with the
townspeople because lie runs a highly
successful In'tery. In short, he is a
"bad lot," but everybody likes him.
His wife, v 1 <> is coldly beautiful, be
longs to a narrow religious following, ]
"The True Believers," who hold peace 1
as the ultimate aim of mankind. She
has raised her son, Arthur, to uphold
peace until his own father is not sure
whether or not the boy is a coward. |
The town agrees that she Is thor- i
oughly good, and nobody likes her.
Arthur, himself, about whom the
story moves is a boy given to analysis
and introspection. He always stands
true to his prlneiples, as taught to him
by his mother, even though thoy al

most bring him life-long unhappiness.
In his very stand for peace at a time
when the country is war-mad, he
proves himself a man of courage of
the first water.
Mystery and Civil War
Add to Interest
A mystery shadows the Kay house.
Mrs. Kay and Arthur live apart from
the Major, refusing to use any of his
"tainted" money. The Major's past has
an unexplained chapter in it and the
boy's character is moulded by his
mother's strong character and person
ality.
The advent of the Civil War pre
cipitates an intensely dramatic situa
tion, in which a great love is nearly
lost through misunderstanding. Scenes
of poignant drama, of infinite tender
ness and rare humor, bring the story
to a close. The love story of Arthur
and Lois Clark becomes the central
theme as the story progresses. The
shadow over the Kay home is lifted
and all Old Chester understands and
rejoices.
