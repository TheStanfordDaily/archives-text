Which is the most dangerous sport? j
Is it football, boxing, polo, hockey,!
bull-fighting, auto-racing—or any one
of the other thrillers in which serious j
accident occur? Without going into
vital statistics of the case, or for that |
matter even attempting to answer the
question, let us look over a few of the
aforementioned sports and see where
in the danger lies.
Football is still a dangerous sport!
—and no game of violent personal con
tact between two teams of red-blooded
youths can be without occasional in
juries—but the present game, even
though it is played harder than ever
before and by a great many more men
and boys, has fewer serious injuries
than twenty years ago. The answer
lies not only in the absence of mass
plays, but in the fact that the training

I methods of today are so much better, >
| and the players are in vastly superior
| condition when game time comes
around. Eighteen players were killed
in 11)05 and about l(ift injured, but you
heard of very few fatalities or seri- \
ous hurts during the recent football
season.
Auto-racing has its good and its bad
years. In one season, 1924, six
"Knights of the Roarding Road" were
killed. The loss of Jimmy Murphy,
i Joe Boyer, Dario Resta, Ernie An- 1
1 sterberg, Earl Wilson, and Ralph i
Thomas have been unequaled before |
! or since.
Boxing has suffered very few fatali- j
ties. Incidents such as the deaths of i
Frankie Jerome and Clever Sencio, in
directly caused by Bud Taylor, are few I
and far between. The supervision of j

. the various boxing commissions is
usually too strict to permit an un
| conditioned fighter to enter the ring,
j Jess Willard's case was different. A
1 "man-mountain" of his size and
j strength was liable to kill anyone he
hit with full force.
As far as baseball goes, it's a won
' dor more pitchers and infielders
weren't killed when the "rabbit-ball"
j was in vogue. Ray Chapman's tragic
j death, after being hit by one of Carl
1 Mays' underhand shoots, is the only
I fatal accident that I can recall.
Ice-hockey attracts crowds because
! it is thrilling and dangerous, but the
| records show very few fatal Injuries
i from this slashing game. Bull-fighting
I is no game for a weak heart —or a
weak stomach, either. Lacrosse and
j polo take their toll of victims, but

]Ac ording to Pedlar I aimer'j &01., wtyo j
was in America recently, the cruelest |
1 thing in sports, next to cock-fighting, I
1 is the annual Grand National Steeple- j
! chase in England. Photos showing the j
jumps at Aintree remind one of a
j troop of cavalry under machine-gun
fire.
