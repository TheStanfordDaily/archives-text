# CRASH WITHOUT DAMAGE ACHIEVED BY LOCOMOTIVE

Crash without wreckage and injury?
Impossible. Yet when the big train en
gine "crashed" into the Museum about
fifteen years a«o there was no audible
sound and certainly no wreckage. But
in this case the scenery was carefully
staged for the event.
A jagged hole large enough to admit
the engine was cut into the back wall
of the Museum and then the en
gine, which had been brought to the
back of the building on extended car
rails, was lifted on blocks by a crew of
Redwood City house movers and rolled
in on tracks which had been laid down
beforehand on the re-inforced concrete
floor of the museum. It/has been there
ever since.
First in West
This railroad locomotive was the first
to be used in construction service on
the western end of the transcontinental
railroad and was named "The Governor
Stanford" in honor of Leland Stanford,
who was then Governor of California
and who, together with C. P. Huntington,
Charles Crocker, and Mark Hopkins,

| was responsible for the plan to build an
I overland railroad connecting the East
| and West.
The parts of the engine were shipped
to California by way of Cape Horn and
put together in Sacramento. It made
j its maiden trip from there on Novem
| ber 11, 1863. After approximately half
i a century of active service as a passen
[ ger and freight engine, it stood idle for
j some time in the Oakland freight yards.
Through the influence of William
Sproule, President of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, it was presented to Stan
ford University.
Odd Smokestack
The University's one piece of rolling
stock—which rolls no more—has a very
large and odd-shaped smokestack, typical
of the days when wood was the fuel
which was used to run the locomotives.
The smokestack was to keep sparks from
escaping into the air until they had cooled
and were no longer sparks. Despite this
precaution, the early engines succeeded
in setting so many fields of hay on fire
that they were popularly known as "hay
burners."
