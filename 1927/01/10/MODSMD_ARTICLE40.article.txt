# AMERICAN UNIVERSITY MUCH MALIGNED, SAYS COLUMBIA PRESIDENT

Services of the American University
and the criticism leveled against institu
tions of higher learning were discussed
in the annual report submitted to the
trustees of Columbia University by
President Nicholas Murray Butler.
"The reader," he says, "who permits
himself to be more than diverted by
the clamorous criticisms of American
universities that are thrust upon his at
tention from time to time will doubtless
be mystified by their contradictory and
self-destroying character. He reads, on
the one hand, that these universities arc
hotlx;ds of radicalism, of revolution, and
of all that is signified by the mystic
word Bolshevism. If then the page be
turned, the reader finds himself asked
to believe that these self-same universi
ties are the entrenched strongholds of
privilege, of reaction, of capitalism, what
ever that may mean.
"The simple truth is that both of
these extreme and wholly unjustified
forms of criticism converge on the con
clusion that the American university has
increasingly tended to become a genuine
university, a home of intellectual lib
erty and,freedom of the spirit, and that
of course it gives hearing to doctrine
and opinion held by sincere and scholar
ly seekers after truth, which arc by no
means universally accepted and which
may indeed excite more or less violent
opposition "
