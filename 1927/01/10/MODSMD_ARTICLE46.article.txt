# Systematic Bathing Big Item in Finns' Athletic Prowessâ€”Barton Hall
## 
### 
That Paavo Nurmi and other Finnish
athletes owe much of their athletic prow
ess to their systematic bathing, is the
statement of Barton Hall, secretary of
The American legation at Helsingfors,
Finland. The hath, he says, is a na
tional institution in Finland, and is con
ducted in an elaborate manner.
"The bather enters a room," said Mr.
Hall, "which is filled with steam causcd
by pouring water over hot stones. He
remains in this room until the steam
has raised the surface temperature of
the body to a high degree. Conse
quently he perspires freely. Then, to
stimulate circulation, he beats his body
with birch twigs. Following this a cold
bath is taken. People of all classes take
a bath like this at least once a week."
