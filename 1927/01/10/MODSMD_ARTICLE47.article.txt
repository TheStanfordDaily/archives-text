# VISUAL INSTRUCTION OFFERED IN SOUTH

"There is no limit to the possibilities
of visual instruction," says Mrs.
Charles Joe Moore, head of the Bureau
of Visual Instruction at the University
of Texas.
The number of schools using slides
and motion pictures more than doubled
in the last year. Records show that
over a million children in Texas had
the opportunity of seeing educational
pictures during the past yoar.
Mrs. Moore points out that such use
of slides and motion pictures allows
a great diversity of subjects to be
taught. Almost all lines of work can
be so adapted.
