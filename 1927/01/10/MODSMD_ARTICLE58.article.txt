## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, January B.â€”lf Dean :
Cromwell's "first rule in track and field !
participation" that champions arc made j
only through plenty of competition holds
true, the Southern California squad of
1927 should develop into another Star i
Trojan aggregation, for there are now
fifty-six athletes affording each other '
competition. The total will probably |
be swelled with the start of the second \
semester next month.
The team must round into shape by
February 26 when the first track work
takes place at the A.A.U. Relays. This
is followed by a dual meet with the
Olympic Club of San Francisco on
March 12. Stanford is met here March
26, California at Berkeley April 2, the
A.A.U. championships are slated for
April 16, a triangular meet is scheduled
with the Hollywood and Los Angeles
Athletic clubs on May 14 and then comes
the 1.C.4A. in Philadelphia May 27 and
28 and the Pacific Coast Intercollegiates
in Los Angeles June 3 and 4.
