# Women Drivers Preferred Insurance Agents Say So Roughs Reported Reckless
## 
### 
Judging from the findings of the
American Automobile Association, the
woman driver of the campus has some
j respect for the fenders, bumpers, tail
lights, et al, of her Ford coop or Stutz
j roadster. At any rate, if she does insist
on pulverizing these vital parts, she keeps
it a dark secret from the insurance
agents. And for this reason and many
others, she is considered a good risk by
j big insurance men.
Since she is not addicted to "smearing"
everybody, her driving is neither so reck
less nor so careless as that of her strong
armed campus brother. She is not nearly
| so much given to driving with but one
arm, nor under the influence of a strong
liquid, and thus fares better in emer
gencies. The college man, on the other
j hand, is such a poor risk that his con
j tact in the insurance business is more
j favored when lie tries to sell policies to
i his father's friends.
