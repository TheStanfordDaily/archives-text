# CHIEFS DRESS SCANTILY
## 
### 
Papua chiefs are not given to super
fluity in raiment. The one who wears
a string in place of clothes is con
sidered well-dressed. This absence of
attire is also practiced by the fairer
sex. The chief's favorite, who dons
herself in a nose ring and a tatoo
mark, has every reason to believe that
j she is the object of envious eyes.
