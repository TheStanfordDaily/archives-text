Here's the Finer Cedar Chest
BE sure the cedar chest you buy is made of
genuine Tennessee Red Cedar. No other
wood is so enduring, has such beautiful graining
and resists moths so thoroughly.
There is one sure way to know the genftiix*.
Look inside the lid. If the name "Art Chest *
is burned in the wood you may know the
maker's guarantee goes with it, insuring the
quality of materials. We take pleasure in add
ing our own endorsement to his.
Your careful inspection of any of the Art
Chest styles we have in stock will satisfy you
that it is the cedar chest for your home.
