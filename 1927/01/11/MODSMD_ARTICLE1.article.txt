Beta Theta Pi, Alpha Tau Omega,
Encina lE, El Campo, and Breakers
were victorious in the play-oft' of the
third leg of Round I in the intramural
basketball series held yesterday after
noon and evening in the gymnasium,
while the Delta Tau Delta team won
by a forfeit from the Branner II five.
The losers for the day's play were
Delta Upsilon, Encina SW, Los Arcos,
Encina lE, and the Chinese Club.
Betas Win
In the first game of the afternoon
the Beta Theta Pi basket-tossers,
mostly with the aid of Doug Lewis,
put the Delta Upsilon team down by
a score of 14 to 5. For the points,
Lewis sank two buckets from the floor
and three fouls in the first half and
three more field goals in the last half,
bringing his total of the day to 13,
while Gomer Thomas contributed a
foul to raise the score one more. For
the losers, Bob Taylor and Merrit
•Jergens played a good game at for
ward and center, respectively.
In the game between Alpha Tau
Omega and Encina SW, the outcome of
the game was never certain till the
last gun. The score at the end of the
half was 3 to 2, in favor of A.T.0.,
the final tally being 7 to 5. Neither
teams tried many shots at the bas
kets, but many of thosfe that were
thrown missed going in by a matter of
an inch or so. The game itself was
very slow, featured mostly by the
scrappiness of Eph Adams, diminutive
Encina guard, and Lynn Hossom of
A.T.O. Mainwaring made all of the
Enoina scores, one by a foul, and the
others by field goals. Hossom was
high-point man for his team, sinking
two buckets.
Wright, Dail Star
Another Encina team, that of the
west first floor, came out victorious
over Los Arcos, 11 to 7, because Cal
Wright and Bill Dail took it upon
themselves to sink enough shots to
make up the entire eleven points. The
fastest game of the afternoon, this
struggle ended the first half with the
score G to 0, favoring Encina. During
the last period Los Arcos came within
one point of tying the freshmen, but
lost out in the last few minutes of
play. The losers showed good team
work, but were unable to make their
shots good. Otis and Valentine played
consistent, hard basketball, and made
their opponents look lost for awhile.
Campo Smothers Encina
The evening games were both walk
aways, El Campo smothering the En
cina IE aggregation under a 41 to 11
score, and the Breakers almost white
washing the Chinese Club by a score
of 46 to 1. Although the Branner II
team forfeited to the Delta Tau Delta
quintet, the two squads went through
a practice tussle to complete the eve
ning's games.
The outcome of the El Campo-Encina
IE game was apparently in doubt at
half time with the score standing 9 to
7 in favor of the Encina boys. How
ever, the El Campo team settled down
to business in the second period and
put the game on ice. Holmes and
Hobro starred for the victors.
In the second evening game, the
light Chinese Club team was com
pletely outweighed and outplayed by
the strong Breakers outfit. In the first
half the winners sank 28 points to
the Club's single, tally, while in the
last half, the Chinese boys were
blanked. Cook was the outstanding
star of the game, accounting for 27
of the 46 points.

and evening are:
4:ls—Encina 3E vs. Chi Psi.
4:50 —Sigma Chi vs. Cardinals.

Encina lE, El Campo, and Breakers
were victorious in the play-oft' of the
third leg of Round I in the intramural
basketball series held yesterday after
noon and evening in the gymnasium,
while the Delta Tau Delta team won
by a forfeit from the Branner II five.
The losers for the day's play were
Delta Upsilon, Encina SW, Los Arcos,
Encina lE, and the Chinese Club.
Betas Win
In the first game of the afternoon
the Beta Theta Pi basket-tossers,
mostly with the aid of Doug Lewis,
put the Delta Upsilon team down by
a score of 14 to 5. For the points,
Lewis sank two buckets from the floor
and three fouls in the first half and
three more field goals in the last half,
bringing his total of the day to 13,
while Gomer Thomas contributed a
foul to raise the score one more. For
the losers, Bob Taylor and Merrit
•Jergens played a good game at for
ward and center, respectively.
In the game between Alpha Tau
Omega and Encina SW, the outcome of
the game was never certain till the
last gun. The score at the end of the
half was 3 to 2, in favor of A.T.0.,
the final tally being 7 to 5. Neither
teams tried many shots at the bas
kets, but many of thosfe that were
thrown missed going in by a matter of
an inch or so. The game itself was
very slow, featured mostly by the
scrappiness of Eph Adams, diminutive
Encina guard, and Lynn Hossom of
A.T.O. Mainwaring made all of the
Enoina scores, one by a foul, and the
others by field goals. Hossom was
high-point man for his team, sinking
two buckets.
Wright, Dail Star
Another Encina team, that of the
west first floor, came out victorious
over Los Arcos, 11 to 7, because Cal
Wright and Bill Dail took it upon
themselves to sink enough shots to
make up the entire eleven points. The
fastest game of the afternoon, this
struggle ended the first half with the
score G to 0, favoring Encina. During
the last period Los Arcos came within
one point of tying the freshmen, but
lost out in the last few minutes of
play. The losers showed good team
work, but were unable to make their
shots good. Otis and Valentine played
consistent, hard basketball, and made
their opponents look lost for awhile.
Campo Smothers Encina
The evening games were both walk
aways, El Campo smothering the En
cina IE aggregation under a 41 to 11
score, and the Breakers almost white
washing the Chinese Club by a score
of 46 to 1. Although the Branner II
team forfeited to the Delta Tau Delta
quintet, the two squads went through
a practice tussle to complete the eve
ning's games.
The outcome of the El Campo-Encina
IE game was apparently in doubt at
half time with the score standing 9 to
7 in favor of the Encina boys. How
ever, the El Campo team settled down
to business in the second period and
put the game on ice. Holmes and
Hobro starred for the victors.
In the second evening game, the
light Chinese Club team was com
pletely outweighed and outplayed by
the strong Breakers outfit. In the first
half the winners sank 28 points to
the Club's single, tally, while in the
last half, the Chinese boys were
blanked. Cook was the outstanding
star of the game, accounting for 27
of the 46 points.

put the Delta Upsilon team down by
a score of 14 to 5. For the points,
Lewis sank two buckets from the floor
and three fouls in the first half and
three more field goals in the last half,
bringing his total of the day to 13,
while Gomer Thomas contributed a
foul to raise the score one more. For
the losers, Bob Taylor and Merrit
•Jergens played a good game at for
ward and center, respectively.
In the game between Alpha Tau
Omega and Encina SW, the outcome of
the game was never certain till the
last gun. The score at the end of the
half was 3 to 2, in favor of A.T.0.,
the final tally being 7 to 5. Neither
teams tried many shots at the bas
kets, but many of thosfe that were
thrown missed going in by a matter of
an inch or so. The game itself was
very slow, featured mostly by the
scrappiness of Eph Adams, diminutive
Encina guard, and Lynn Hossom of
A.T.O. Mainwaring made all of the
Enoina scores, one by a foul, and the
others by field goals. Hossom was
high-point man for his team, sinking
two buckets.
Wright, Dail Star
Another Encina team, that of the
west first floor, came out victorious
over Los Arcos, 11 to 7, because Cal
Wright and Bill Dail took it upon
themselves to sink enough shots to
make up the entire eleven points. The
fastest game of the afternoon, this
struggle ended the first half with the
score G to 0, favoring Encina. During
the last period Los Arcos came within
one point of tying the freshmen, but
lost out in the last few minutes of
play. The losers showed good team
work, but were unable to make their
shots good. Otis and Valentine played
consistent, hard basketball, and made
their opponents look lost for awhile.
Campo Smothers Encina
The evening games were both walk
aways, El Campo smothering the En
cina IE aggregation under a 41 to 11
score, and the Breakers almost white
washing the Chinese Club by a score
of 46 to 1. Although the Branner II
team forfeited to the Delta Tau Delta
quintet, the two squads went through
a practice tussle to complete the eve
ning's games.
The outcome of the El Campo-Encina
IE game was apparently in doubt at
half time with the score standing 9 to
7 in favor of the Encina boys. How
ever, the El Campo team settled down
to business in the second period and
put the game on ice. Holmes and
Hobro starred for the victors.
In the second evening game, the
light Chinese Club team was com
pletely outweighed and outplayed by
the strong Breakers outfit. In the first
half the winners sank 28 points to
the Club's single, tally, while in the
last half, the Chinese boys were
blanked. Cook was the outstanding
star of the game, accounting for 27
of the 46 points.
