# ADDITIONAL MELODIES SOLICITED BY JUNIOR OPERA MUSIC HEADS
## 
### 
Additional melodies for the 1928!
Junior Opera are needed, says Herbert j
A. Klein, chairman of the music com- j
mittee for the production. Technical
knowledge of music is not required of
those writing songs for the opera, as 1
the work of putting the ideas received
into proper form with harmony and
lyrics will be done by the committee.
A good melody is the only requisite, j
Those in charge of the music for the
opera are desirous of securing melo
dies incorporating new rhythms, par- (
ticularly those of the new dance steps. !
There is also a need for ballads.
Novelty of conception is the chief
quality looked for in the music. Klein i
requests those writing music to send
in a set of words as well if they have !
any ideas for conventional lyrics ap
propriate to the compositions they J
write.
Manuscripts are to be sent to Herb j
Klein, Box 1542, Stanford Postoffice.
