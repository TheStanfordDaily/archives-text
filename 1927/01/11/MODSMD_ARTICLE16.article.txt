"They're more careful than
they used to be," is the opinion
regarding college students ex
pressed by J. W. McDonnell, who
has raised and lowered the gates
at the University Avenue South
ern Pacific crossing in Palo Alto
for the past fourteen years. They
not only pay more attention to
signals, he says, but they seem to
have lost the playful habit of
holding onto the gates to keep
them from raising.
Although there has been a
great improvement in behavior
since the days when teams
dashed gaily over the crossing at
the last second, more improve
ment is highly desirable, declares
the old gatekeeper.
But, says McDonnell, students
ordinarily are careful, at least as
much so as are other motorists,
and a lot more so than most
pedestrians, as the latter pay no
attention to such minor details
as crossing gates or approaching
express trains.
Never since he has been sta
tioned in his little tower have
the gates been broken. They are
operated by an air pump and are
easily raised when some impa
tient driver charges them.
