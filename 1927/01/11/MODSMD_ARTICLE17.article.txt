# INTERNATIONAL LAW FOUNDED ON IDEA OF STATE INFALLIBILITY
## Harvey Ralston Gives Views On Diplomatic Decrees; Nicaragua Affairs 
### 
Speaking before the Cosmopolitan
Club last evening on the difficulties in
the way of International Law, Jackson
Harvey Ralston, internationally known
lawyer, said: "We suffer today from
lapses caused by the originators, who
were immediate representatives of
royal power. Their theory that the
'King could do no wrong' has been
perpetuated internationally in the sub
conscious theory that the state can do
no wrong.
"International law, so called, is far
from being law in the usual sense of
the term and far from being law if
you analyze it at all. In the first place,
it is not well understood; when com
pared with state law, which is in
finitely better, the three or four hun
dred years which it has had for
growth have not been long.
Equality Necessary
"The theory upon which internation
al law is now based is that the state
must yield up its sovereignty if it is
to succeed with its fellows. There
must be that equality among states
which is found among individuals —
equality in the face of the law which
is the only kind of equality which
there can be, since no two states are
equal in any other way. The United
States and Nicaragua, for instance,
are certainly not equals in any other
phase."
When asked his opinion of Ameri
ca's intervention in Nicaragua, Ral
ston said: "I don't think the United
States lfas any right of intervention,
because when the United States goes
to Nicaragua with arms it projects its
power into territory that is not its
own. We are proposing to do what we
would not have permitted England or
France to do during the Civil War.
"The theory of much international
law," continued Ralston, "is that when
a thing is done, it is law. This premise
has been carried out in numberless
books which don't consider at all
whether such a thing should be toler
ated. Consequently books are written
on laws of war. They might just as
well talk of international laws of
lunacy, because war is one of the
worst kinds of lunacy in the world at
the present time. Laws of war have
no essential foundation—they are a
set of absurdities. One-half of the
literature concerning international law
is made up of laws of war. yet they
may be violated at any general's dis
cretion with no court to enforce
them."

books which don't consider at all
whether such a thing should be toler
ated. Consequently books are written
on laws of war. They might just as
well talk of international laws of
lunacy, because war is one of the
worst kinds of lunacy in the world at
the present time. Laws of war have
no essential foundation—they are a
set of absurdities. One-half of the
literature concerning international law
is made up of laws of war. yet they
may be violated at any general's dis
cretion with no court to enforce
them."
Speaking before the Cosmopolitan
Club last evening on the difficulties in
the way of International Law, Jackson
Harvey Ralston, internationally known
lawyer, said: "We suffer today from
lapses caused by the originators, who
were immediate representatives of
royal power. Their theory that the
'King could do no wrong' has been
perpetuated internationally in the sub
conscious theory that the state can do
no wrong.
"International law, so called, is far
from being law in the usual sense of
the term and far from being law if
you analyze it at all. In the first place,
it is not well understood; when com
pared with state law, which is in
finitely better, the three or four hun
dred years which it has had for
growth have not been long.
Equality Necessary
"The theory upon which internation
al law is now based is that the state
must yield up its sovereignty if it is
to succeed with its fellows. There
must be that equality among states
which is found among individuals —
equality in the face of the law which
is the only kind of equality which
there can be, since no two states are
equal in any other way. The United
States and Nicaragua, for instance,
are certainly not equals in any other
phase."
When asked his opinion of Ameri
ca's intervention in Nicaragua, Ral
ston said: "I don't think the United
States lfas any right of intervention,
because when the United States goes
to Nicaragua with arms it projects its
power into territory that is not its
own. We are proposing to do what we
would not have permitted England or
France to do during the Civil War.
"The theory of much international
law," continued Ralston, "is that when
a thing is done, it is law. This premise
has been carried out in numberless
books which don't consider at all
whether such a thing should be toler
ated. Consequently books are written
on laws of war. They might just as
well talk of international laws of
lunacy, because war is one of the
worst kinds of lunacy in the world at
the present time. Laws of war have
no essential foundation—they are a
set of absurdities. One-half of the
literature concerning international law
is made up of laws of war. yet they
may be violated at any general's dis
cretion with no court to enforce
them."
