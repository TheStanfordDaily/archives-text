# PACIFIC TIGERS OPPOSE CARD VARSITY SQUAD
## Coach Hunt Is Pleased With Mental, Moral Attitude Of Card Team SHORT PASS PERFECTED Stiff Workouts to Brush Up Fine Points of Play Precede Clash 
### Fred Speers 
Coach Husky Hunt sent his varsity
basketball men through a stiff work
out last night designed to brush up
on several finer points of play and to
prepare them for the College of the
Pacific quintet which they meet to
morrow night in the pavilion.
Emphasis was placed by the Cardi
nal mentor upon matters of individual
play requiring quickness and alertness.
In general the teamwork of the Cardi
nals seems at a high point for this
stage of the season. Husky Hunt is
also pleased by the morale and mental
attitude of his squad.
Stresses Short Pass
Emphasis on the use of the short
pass was especially stressed. Against
St. Mary's last Saturday night the
Cardinals were prone to use long
passes a bit too often, and it will be
Hunt's effort to correct this tendency
as quickly as possible. The Cardinals
go through a stiff schedule this week,
two games being listed for them on
Friday and Saturday as well as the
game tomorrow night. For a good
showing a variety in the style of play
is essential.
Through the use of a short pass a
player is more able to feint, allowing
misjudgments on the part of his op
ponents. The College of the Pacific
quintet includes an artist in this work
who is able to pass effectively with
either hand.
Too Many Tries
Another trouble on the part of the
Cardinals is their tendency to take
too many shots at the basket, a large
part of these being but gambles on the
hope that the ball will be sunk. Along
with this goes another fault through
the slowness of several of the Stan
ford players to return to the court
after running out-of-bounds following
a short, under-the-basket shot.
Gratified at the showing his men
had made in picking up and using
several new plays given to them a
short while before the Saint game,
Hunt dished out some more plays, em
phasizing as he did so, the need for
alertness on taking the ball when it
goes out of bounds.
Coach Hunt is stressing the fact
that he wants teamwork from the
Cardinals, individual scoring being a
matter of secondary interest. As yet
Stanford lacks an able long-distance
scorer, but the deficiency is being
balanced by able shooting closer to
the basket.

passes a bit too often, and it will be
Hunt's effort to correct this tendency
as quickly as possible. The Cardinals
go through a stiff schedule this week,
two games being listed for them on
Friday and Saturday as well as the
game tomorrow night. For a good
showing a variety in the style of play
is essential.
Through the use of a short pass a
player is more able to feint, allowing
misjudgments on the part of his op
ponents. The College of the Pacific
quintet includes an artist in this work
who is able to pass effectively with
either hand.
Too Many Tries
Another trouble on the part of the
Cardinals is their tendency to take
too many shots at the basket, a large
part of these being but gambles on the
hope that the ball will be sunk. Along
with this goes another fault through
the slowness of several of the Stan
ford players to return to the court
after running out-of-bounds following
a short, under-the-basket shot.
Gratified at the showing his men
had made in picking up and using
several new plays given to them a
short while before the Saint game,
Hunt dished out some more plays, em
phasizing as he did so, the need for
alertness on taking the ball when it
goes out of bounds.
Coach Hunt is stressing the fact
that he wants teamwork from the
Cardinals, individual scoring being a
matter of secondary interest. As yet
Stanford lacks an able long-distance
scorer, but the deficiency is being
balanced by able shooting closer to
the basket.
