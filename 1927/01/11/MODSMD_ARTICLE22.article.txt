# Timeliness

### 
Yesterday saw the opening of a University course which provides
something out of the usual in interest, timeliness, and practicability. It
is not the customary practice to praise any particular study in print, but
the initiative of the administration in arranging a series of lectures by
Chester H. Rowell on international politics of the day deserves more
than passing commendation.
Such a course will produce two results of real value. It will arouse
an increasing interest on the part of the students in the world's affairs.
And it will help remove the hysteria which beclouds international issues.
Rowell for many years has kept close and active touch with govern
mental affairs the world over. Through his wide journalistic experience
he is extremely well qualified to speak authoritatively of the trend of the
day. It is from no mere academic knowledge that he speaks but from
actual study of the League of Nations and foreign governments and
from acquaintance with world leaders.
Instead of theoretical material Rowell deals in the movements and
institutions which arc actually changing the course of international politics.
All this serves to give the touch of life and reality which adds to the
inherent value of a University course.
