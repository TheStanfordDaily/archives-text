This afternoon in the Memorial Church Mr. Allen's organ recital will be
made up of the works of one musician and will be dedicated to that
musician's memory. In the city during the next few weeks the San
Francisco orchestra and other musical organizations of all sizes and
descriptions will be honoring the same man in their recitals. Far away
in Vienna a great festival and musical congress will be held in com
memoration of that city's greatest genius.
For March 23 of this year will mark the one hundredth anniversary
of the death of Ludwig von Beethoven, universally regarded as one of
the greatest, if not the greatest genius of music. More than any other,
lie is the father of modern music.
Beethoven was an individualist, a man who stood alone. Far ahead of
his period artistically, he was also advanced in his political thought. An
ardent republican and upholder of democracy in a time when to be either
was political heresy, he was, but most important he was a man of character
who struggled against disease and poverty, neglect and misunderstanding,
without compromising his personal or his artistic ideals. He himself is
a figure worthy to be the subject of his own "Eroica," the symphony for
a hero.
