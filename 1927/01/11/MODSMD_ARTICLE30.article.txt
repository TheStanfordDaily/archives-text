FOR NO REASON AT ALL?
An extremely interesting discussion
has been held recently in the columns
of the Cornell Daily Sun. A letter
signed "Five Bewilcflered Freshmen"
precipitated an avalanche of mail
when the authors of the epistle in
quired blandly whether the average
student was in Cornell for any good
reason, or failing that, for any reason
at all. '
After a rather heated debate, the
matter was rested by one who signed
himself "A Bewildered Professor" and
who had the temerity to admit that
years of honorable service on the Cor
nell faculty had failed to convince

| him that HE was in college for any
reason at all.
This pessimistic attitude is prob
ably very alarming to many to whom
the college degree represents the ulti
; mate in intellectual accomplishment,
j It is to be hoped that none of the
- j rising and more promising of the prep
' j school crop go in off the deep end in
I j sheer despair. College still has much
i to offer. Where else may one develop
[ a taste for the luxuries of life without
i j being annoyed by the inconveniences
I involved in earning them? Where else
1 may one study to acquire an air of
t nonchalance that will not appear to
- i be studied? In short, where else may
; j one learn to loaf like a gentleman?
