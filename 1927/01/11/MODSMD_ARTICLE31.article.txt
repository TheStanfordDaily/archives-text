# CABBAGES and THINGS
## By The King

News dispatches calmly remark that
the exiled ex-dictator Adolfo de la
Iluerta is directing a revolution
against the recognized Calles govern
ment of Mexico. Iluerta is said to he
working from "secret" headquarters
in Los Angeles. But it may not be a
revolution. It may be just a righteous
uprising of the Mexican people.
We won't know for a week or two.
In the meantime there is so much
going on in Central America that even
college students have heard about it.
It seems the world was just on the
verge of being saved for democracy
again by the Marines and the State
Department. But somebody told Con
gress. Now there will be speeches.
Saving the United States is the
latest indoor sport. But the teams
need more practice. Mr. Doheny got
the signals mixed and saved us from
Japan. The next play is for the
Marines to save us from Mexico, using
an end run through Nicaragua. But
such things have to go by degrees.

i First the bull and then the bullets.
Wait a few days and it will all be
1 simplified. The Coolidge-Kellogg-Oil
and-Catholicism combination may win
out. In that case every patriotic Amer
| ican will spring to arms to defend
| his country and his flag, religious free
dom, the Monroe doctrine, Panama
! Canal, and in general to show those
comic-opera republics that we believe
in peace and good-will.
If the Democratic and other oppo
(sition to Coolidge in Congress wins,
; the administration will have been
; caught "playing the bully" in Nica
ragua and Mexico.
On second thought, this is all too
mixed up for university Let
| us go back to our texts in economics
and political science and ethics. No
where else but in the movies is right
so triumphant and wrong so obvious.
There only are the victorious politi
cians statesmen without being ques
] tioned.
