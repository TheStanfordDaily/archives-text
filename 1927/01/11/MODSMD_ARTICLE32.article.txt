Perella, By William Locke, Jr. (Dodd,
Mead and Co. $2.00.)
Can youth and age be happily mar
ried? This is the question William
Locke presents to us in his new novel.
In these days, when such problems are
universally decided either one way or
another in nearly everyone's mind, it
is deplorable that William Locke
wastes his skill and the reader's time
by playing throughout three hundred
pages with this idea without coming
to any conclusion. In our opinion, Mr.
Locke would have done far better if
he had made up his own mind on the
subject before starting the book.
A youth marries a middle-aged wom
an, and an old art connoisseur weds
a girl at least thirty years his junior.
Rut the appeal of youth for youth is
strong, stronger than any other tie —
or is it? The author, it seems, cannot
decide.
Descriptions Lacking
in Color
Mr. Locke, usually impressive in his
descriptions, is disappointing here,
where ample opportunity is afforded
by scenes laid in Florence, Venice,
Switzerland, and Paris.
He deserves credit for the portrayal
of life-like characters, swayed by gen
uine human emotions. Lady Beatrice
is a typical example of a woman past
her prime who practices with a fiend
like determination her fast-fleeting
charms on a susceptible young man.
Perella herself is quite naive and sin
cere in her actions and emotions.
Aside from good character sketches,
the desire to find out how the writer
will solve the problem, which in the
end he fails to solve, is the only ele
ment that holds the reader's interest
to the end of the story.
