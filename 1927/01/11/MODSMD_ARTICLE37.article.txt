# UNIVERSITIES TEND TOWARD DEFERRED RUSHING SAYS DOERR

### 
"Universities are tending toward de
ferred rushing in fraternities," said
Karl Doerr in reporting on his recent
trip to New York, where he acted as a
Stanford delegate to the National In
terfraternity Convention.
The conference was attended by
representativee of 55 universities,
many of which sent two or three dele
gates. Richard Jones of Illinois was
elected chairman and Doerr secretary
of the meet.
The report made by Karl Doerr on
his recent trip was the most important
portion of the meeting held in the Old
Union last night by the Stanford In
terfraternity Council.
Great interest was shown in the
fraternity management at Stanford.
The Cardinal representative was be
leaguered with questions from the
time he reached New York until he
left; these questions were on every
phase of campus activity from de
ferred rushing, student body work,
and men's council activities to univer
sity athletics. Doerr was called upon
to make eight speeches at banquets
and meetings during his stay.
The question of deferred rushing
was the greatest problem during the
convention. Only two colleges were
able to quote examples of entire suc
cess, but the movement toward this
form of rushing promises to be taken
up in many other universities. Penn
sylvania, one of the largest universi
ties of the East, started deferred
rushing at the first of this year.
At the meeting last night, it was
also decided that an interfraternity
d;ince would be given this quarter. A
committee consisting of John Menzies,
chairman, Phillips Brooks, Kenneth
Graham, and Gerald Stewart, was ap
pointed to have definite suggestions
for the dance ready to be presented by
next Monday night.
The Council wishes to remind new
men who are just entering the Uni
versity that they must have 90 units
before they may be approached by a
fraternity.
Quad pictures of the Council mem
bers will be taken Thursday at 12:45
o'clock in front of the Union. Each
house is asked to send both their
junior and senior delegates for the
group picture.
