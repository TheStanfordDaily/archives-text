# Harvard Changes Entrance Requirements in English
## 
### 
Candidates for admission to Har
vard College will no longer take the
present anticipatory examination in
English A, as a result of the recent
decision of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences. Starting this spring, those
who pass the comprehensive paper in
English with a grade of 70' per cent
or higher will be relieved from any
further requirements.
With this substitution it is expected
that English A, long one of the largest
in the college curriculum, will lose
one-third of its membership. Under
the new regulations men will be al
lowed to enter at once upon more
advanced work either in English, or in
any other courses open to freshmen,
provided they do satisfactory work on
the comprehensive paper.
