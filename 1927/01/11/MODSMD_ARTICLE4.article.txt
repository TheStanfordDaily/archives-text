# A.S.S.U. STILL OWES $29,500 PAYMENT TOWARD PAVILION CONSTRUCTION COSTS
## Stanford Undergraduates Will Continue Paying Fifty-Cent Fee Until 1934 Under New Arrangement 
### John B. Rogers 
Is the pavilion fee a tradition? For
nearly six years, four times a year,
the students have acquired the habit
of adding an extra dollar to their
tuition and other fees when they regis
ter. Some of the more statistically in
clined have figured that they will have
donated at least twelve dollars to
ward the Pavilion fund by the time
they graduate; and they have figured
further that, as they go into the place
about once a quarter, it costs them
a dollar each time, which does not
consider the price of tickets to the
conierts and games.
Plans for Payment
The cost of the original building,
plus the improvements, is $151,700. To
this there has accrued about $26,500
in interest, which brings the total cost
of the pavilion, through August 31 of
last year, to over $178,000. The as
sessments were distributed among the
Board of Athletic Control, the Uni
versity, and the student body; the
Board to pay $7500 a year, the Presi
dent's and Comptroller's budget to
provide $5000 a year, and each student
to be assessed one dollar every quar
ter. By this method it was planned
to have the pavilion completely paid
for by about 1930.
Students Owe $29,500
The Board of Athletic Control paid
the remainder of its share in advance
last fall, so the rest of the payments
will come only from the students and

the University. But by an action of the
Associated Students last year, it was
agreed that only fifty cents of the
dollar fee of each student would go
toward the pavilion fund, because the
A.S.S.U. needed more money to oper
ate properly. This resulted in a com
plete revision of the scheme of pay
ments on the part of the student body,
so that it will not have finished pay
ing its share until approximately
1934 or 1935, as it still owes nearly
$29,500, excluding interest. The pa
vilion was begun in 1921 and com
pleted about July, 1922. From time to
time changes in it have been made. A
new entrance was added to the side
facing Encina Hall. Also the ligthing
was changed from an indirect system,
for which the engineers said the build
ingg was not adapted, to a direct one.
It was further discovered that the
seating capacity could not equal the
demand, so more seats were added at
the jpast end and below the balcony.
By doing this, the capacity was nearly
doubled s othat the hall now holds
2700. Even at that, it is still too small
to meet the demands of the conference
basketball games.
The pavilion is part of a definite
plan for an athletic quadrangle that
it is hoped will be built in the future.
The other structure in the group will
be an administration building for the
Athletic department, as its offices are
already overcrowded and the gymna
sium needs the space that they occupy
at present.
