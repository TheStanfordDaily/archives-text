# Cambridge Women Criticized Debaters Vote for Abolition Aftermath in House of Lords
## 
### 
"Women of today are as double-faced
as their ancestors," charged speakers
in a Cambridge Debating Union meet
ing, and the members voted that wo
men should be barred from the Eng
lish university.
"Rather than grow old, a woman
dyes while she is young, bangles her
arms, bingles her hair, and bungles
her face," was another charge hurled
at the British university women. One
orator pointed to the highly civilized
way in which the women rode bicycles
and ate chocolates. Admitting that
they powdered their faces, he quoted
the advice of Nelson, "Trust in God
and keep your powder dry."
Immediately various English organi
zations rallied to the defense of the
women students, and the heated dis
pute over the question has found its
aftermath in the House of Lords.
Lord Darling championed in a vehe
ment debate the cause of women seek
ing higher education.
