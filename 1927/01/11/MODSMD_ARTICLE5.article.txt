# BOXING COACH SENDS MEN THROUGH STIFF FIRST RING WORKOUT
## Four Lettermen Are Back, Promising Sophomores Out for Team 
### 
Initial practice for the 1927 boxing
season was held yesterday afternoon
when Coach Harry W. Maloney took
charge of the returning lettermen, in
addition to fifty men registered in
boxing classes, from which group the
new material is to be taken.
The classes went through short exer
cise periods, while the nucleus of this
year's squad was put through rather
stiff paces for early-season practice.
Shadow boxing, a round in the ring,
and more exercise comprised a fast
afternoon's workout.
Miron Is Captain
Only four lettermen are back from
last season's squad, but several prom
ising men who have appeared in Stan
ford boxing rings are working out
with Maloney. Carlos Miron, who is
outstanding in the featherweight divi
sion, will lead the Cardinals through
this year; Miron Schall, the middle
weight, who captained the team last
year, is eligible for another season,
and should be a valuable man to
Maloney; Norman Fain in the light
j heavy class, and Alex Ross, in the
i lightweight division, are returning
: lettermen.
Novices Promising
I From last season's freshmen who
, proved their worth in the novice
meets, are Kenneth Lloyd, welter
weight; Strent Ilanna, middleweight;
and Tom Traenor, lightweight, who
J should give Ross a stiff battle for first
position in that class. Bert Simmons
and Glenn Feely are stars of several
years ago who will be eligible for this
season's competition.
A long and steep schedule for the
boxers, with promise of several meets
with the foremost amateurs in the
sfate, is being arranged, and should
test the squad to its full strength.
