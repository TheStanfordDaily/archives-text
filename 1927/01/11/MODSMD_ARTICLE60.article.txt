### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Can you jump over a thin cross-bar
of wood set parallel to the ground or
floor at a height of six feet? Not so
easy, is it? Yet a quiet, modest, gray
eyed school-teacher of Champaign, Il
linois, has done that stunt at least five
hundred times in official track meets
or exhibitions, and probably at least
one thousand other times in practice.
Once he cleared the phenomenal
height of 6 feet, inches, which is
the present world's outdoor record;
he ht»s jumped 6 feet, 7 inches four
times (not counting the time he did
the 6:SVA) and he has jumped 6 feet,
6 inches sixteen times!
To meet this remarkable young man,
you would never suspect that he was
one of the greatest all-around athletes
in the world. In the first place, he
wears glasses, and you don't usually
expect that a man who is handicapped
with "cheaters" can high-jump, pole
vault, run hurdle races, and take part
in other forms of violent physical ex
ercise where a fine judgment of dis
tance and timing is necessary. To look
at Harold Osborn, he is a blonder and
bigger edition of Harold Lloyd (and
don't think that the Harold of movie
fame is not an athlete, too.
Young Mr. Osborn (he is 27 years

| old) will be seen competing in vari
! ous parts of the country in the next
j few months in various indoor track
| meets. Never content with what he
has accomplished, he is always striv
j ing to better his previous records, and
| don't be surprised if some day he
jumps seven feet! "Every day in every
way I go higher and higher," is Har
old's motto, and one can't help but
| praise his attitude, also his altitude.
When he won the decathlon, the all-
I around contest of ten events, in the
j 1924 Olympics, Osborn scored 7710
■ points, which was about 200 more
points than the famous Jim Thorpe
scored in 1912, measured on the new
basis. Osborn, in his "iron man" stunt
referred to in the above drawing, drove
I his car from 3 a.m. till 10 p.m., slept
| six hours, and then drove from 5 a.m.
| for ten hours more, arriving at the
I scene of the track meet just in time to
, enter the high-hurdle race, which he
t won in the fine time of 15 2-5 seconds.
! He went on to win five other events,
! and then drove back home in thirty
j two hours, with only half an hour's
; rest!
Any amateur who works that hard
for sport's sake deserves to jump
seven feet!

in the world. In the first place, he
wears glasses, and you don't usually
expect that a man who is handicapped
with "cheaters" can high-jump, pole
vault, run hurdle races, and take part
in other forms of violent physical ex
ercise where a fine judgment of dis
tance and timing is necessary. To look
at Harold Osborn, he is a blonder and
bigger edition of Harold Lloyd (and
don't think that the Harold of movie
fame is not an athlete, too.
Young Mr. Osborn (he is 27 years

| old) will be seen competing in vari
! ous parts of the country in the next
j few months in various indoor track
| meets. Never content with what he
has accomplished, he is always striv
j ing to better his previous records, and
| don't be surprised if some day he
jumps seven feet! "Every day in every
way I go higher and higher," is Har
old's motto, and one can't help but
| praise his attitude, also his altitude.
When he won the decathlon, the all-
I around contest of ten events, in the
j 1924 Olympics, Osborn scored 7710
■ points, which was about 200 more
points than the famous Jim Thorpe
scored in 1912, measured on the new
basis. Osborn, in his "iron man" stunt
referred to in the above drawing, drove
I his car from 3 a.m. till 10 p.m., slept
| six hours, and then drove from 5 a.m.
| for ten hours more, arriving at the
I scene of the track meet just in time to
, enter the high-hurdle race, which he
t won in the fine time of 15 2-5 seconds.
! He went on to win five other events,
! and then drove back home in thirty
j two hours, with only half an hour's
; rest!
Any amateur who works that hard
for sport's sake deserves to jump
seven feet!


Higher, Harold!
Can you jump over a thin cross-bar
of wood set parallel to the ground or
floor at a height of six feet? Not so
easy, is it? Yet a quiet, modest, gray
eyed school-teacher of Champaign, Il
linois, has done that stunt at least five
hundred times in official track meets
or exhibitions, and probably at least
one thousand other times in practice.
Once he cleared the phenomenal
height of 6 feet, inches, which is
the present world's outdoor record;
he ht»s jumped 6 feet, 7 inches four
times (not counting the time he did
the 6:SVA) and he has jumped 6 feet,
6 inches sixteen times!
To meet this remarkable young man,
you would never suspect that he was
one of the greatest all-around athletes
in the world. In the first place, he
wears glasses, and you don't usually
expect that a man who is handicapped
with "cheaters" can high-jump, pole
