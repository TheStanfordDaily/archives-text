# 'One Eyed' Connelly Outdone Students Show Up Veteran Twelve Ohioans Crash Gate
## 
### 
"One Eyed" Connelly, the world's
most famous gate-crasher, was
eclipsed at the Ohio State-Michigan
game by a group of twelve Ohio stu
dents who, lining up in single file,
passed into the game, each indicating
that the man behind had the tickets.
The last man handed in a single ticket,
disclaiming knowledge of the others,
who by this time were lost in the
crowd.
"One Eyed" fooled the gatekeepers
in a much less thrilling manner, using
the old-fashioned expedient of borrow
ing a band instrument and walking
into the stadium with the band.
