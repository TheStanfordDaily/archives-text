# ART GALLERY SHOWS VARIED BOOKPLATES IN NEW EXHIBITION
## Private Collection Loaned to Stanford by Official Of Association 
### Margaret Cummings 
Fifty-three book plates, including
! etched entaglio prints, wood cuts,
zincographs, and halftone work, are
now on exhibition at the Art Gallery.
jThis is the personal collection of Edith
Spencer, secretary-treasurer of the
, Bookplate Association International,
: Los Angeles, and is a comprehensive
! and representative assortment.
The cult of the bookplate has be
come widespread, and has inspired
j the efforts of leading artists from Al
j bert Durer to Bewick and through the
| present time. Once simply a mark of
j ownership to be inserted in a book, it
has become an object valuable in itself,
j desired by collectors and exchanged by
j the owners for other ex-libris.
Designs Elaborate
Intended as a means of identifica
■ tion and protection, the bookplate of
j fers wide opportunities as an expres
, sion of some sentiment or whim of
the owner. Designs range according to
I tastes, from line etchings to the most
' elaborate embossed and hand-tinted
prints. In the earlier days of book
plate history, a history which covers
over four centuries, the importance of
heraldry was strongly reflected in de
! signs representing almost exclusively
I the pomp and dignity of armorial
bearings, a feature which held its own
through the eighteenth century. Cer
tain definite types were developed at
the same time, among them the Jaco
bean, the Ribbon and Wreath, the
j Allngorlal, and most recently the Pic
j torial.
"Miracle" Scenes Shown
Among the most important of the
collections now being exhibited at the
Art Gallery is the large showing of
photographs of actors and scenes from"The
| "The Miracle," and a unique and ar
! resting group of sketches by Diego
i Rivera from native studies. These last
' are decidedly of the modern and real-
I istic school.
