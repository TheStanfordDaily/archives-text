# CONFERENCE TO PRESENT PLAY IN PANTOMINE
## Program Arranged Includes Songsters, Musicians, Dance Acts ORCHESTRA IS ENGAGED Director Confident Colonial Play Will Provide New Dramatic Type 
### 
"The Lady Who Lost Her Hoop," a
pantomime set in early colonial days,
will he one of the numbers to be pre
sented at the A.W.S. Conference party
tomorrow night in the Women's Club
house.
The final dress rehearsal will be
held tonight in the Roble library under
the direction of Elizabeth Ann Lynch,
who believes that "The Lady Who
Lost Her Hoop," as a new type of
entertainment for conference parties,
will prove popular with Stanford wo
men. Those cast for the production
are: Catherine Coman as the heroine,
Frances Slioup as the villain, Maxine
Cushing as the hero, and Martha Mc-
Dowell, Ann Wheeler, Marion Strong,
and Benetta Merner as the neighbor
children.
Villain in Plot
The playlet is a pantomime with a
verse accompaniment, the action tak
ing place in an American city of the
eighteenth century. The plot hinges
on a court intrigue between the hero
and villain, and on the heroine's at
tempt to "vamp" the secret papers
from the latter, with a final denoue
ment provided by a Paris fashion
edict.
Other numbers on the program will
be an Apache dance by Martha Jud
son and Elizabeth Woodyatt, a series
of popular songs by Mary McCleave
and Helen Thompson, with ukelele ac
companiment, and a monologue by
Hallie Keating. The numbers are being
arranged by a freshman committee in
charge of the affair, composed of
Betty Bonn, chairman, Pauline Sned
den, Betty Shively, Ruth Silliman, and
Charlotte Lovekin.
A three-piece orchestra has been ob
tained to furnish music from 7 to 9
o'clock. The committee plans to have
the acts put on informally between
the dancing, carrying out the "rough"
idea suggested by the masculine cloth
ing to be affected by half the "five
hundred." Sponsors in block "S"
sweaters will form a stag line at the
door to introduce new and old women.
