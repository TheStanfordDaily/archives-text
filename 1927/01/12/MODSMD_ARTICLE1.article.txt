# MEN'S VOTE COUNTENANCES TAX FED LODGE
## University Returns Validate Plan for Two-Dollar W.A.A. Assessment PETITION STARTS BALLOT Searsville Meeting Declared Inaccessible by Many Wishing to Attend 
### 
Direct assessment on all women of
a $2 fee was definitely adopted as the
contribution to be made toward the
financing of the W.A.A. lodge, by a
vote of 201 to 110, taken at the house
meetings of the women's living groups
Monday evening. Roble hall voted in
favor of the assessment, 99 to 36, and
the sororities 101 to 74.
The assessment was approved le
gally at a W.A.A. open meeting at
Searsville lake last quarter, but in
response to a petition signed by a
number of women, the organization
decided to hold a revote on the cam
pus. The petitioners argued that the
meeting at Searsville was difficult of
access to a large number of members,
and that although W.A.A. provided
transportation to it, many women had
not the time to attend.
In its campaign for an affirmative
vote, W.A.A. pointed out that since
the decision to build a lodge had been
made by the Associated Women Stu
dents at their assembly sponsored by
the University early last quarter, the
building must be erected. The women
of the University must in some way
collect the funds, part of which would
have to be furnished by the women
themselves. A direct gift to the fund
was considered by W.A.A. to be the
simplest method.
The method of collection has not yet
been decided upon, the living groups
having been asked to make sugges
tions as to the most expedient. W.A.A.
will either choose one method to be
applied in the collection of all the
money, or permit each living group to
collect the contributions of its mem
bers as it desires.
