## 
### 
Changing the date of the production
of "Princess Ida'" from February 19
to February 25, and making that eve
ning a closed date, granting Block "S" j
and gold awards to twenty-three mem
bers of the Stanford University Coast
Conference Championship football
team, and accepting the resignation of [
Theodore F. Baer as debating man-1
ager, was the main business that oc-;
cupied the meeting of the Executive |
Committee, held last night. Seven
organizations were granted dates for
formal and informal dances.
Due to the fact that several mistakes
were made in choosing the date for
the production of "Princess Ida," Gor-1
don Davis, director of dramatics, and j
Robert Cecil, dramatic manager, ap- \
peared before the Executive Commit-j
tee at their meeting last night, and
asked that the date be changed.
The date originally granted was the
night of one of the more important
basketball games. When a change was
made, the date chosen was Saturday,
February 19. This is in the middle of
the recess created by the Washing
ton's Birthday holiday, which comes
-<m Tuesday. Davis felt that attendance
at the production of "Princess Ida"
would suffer on account of this cir
cumstance, and so asked the Ex Com
mittee to change the date again.
Toyon Club, Chi Omega, and Phi i
Gamma Delta had already been
granted dances for February 25, but!
the action of the committee cancels j
these dates.
