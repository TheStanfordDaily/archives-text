# SOUTH AMERICANS DECRY U.S. ACTION IN NICARAGUA
## 
### 
nECENT interference of the United States in Nicaraguan affairs is regarded
by the people of South America as unwarranted action on the part of that
country, according to Professor Percy A. Martin of the Stanford History
department, who returned yesterday from a year and a half of traveling in
Europe, South America, and the Near East. Saeasa is regarded as the
people's choice for president, and it is thought that Diaz would not last for
two weeks if America's influence were withdrawn.
Professor Martin has spent the last eight months in South America, prin
cipally in Brazil, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, and Cuba, giving some lectures on the

of historical studies and
making contacts with the historians
and scholars of those countries.
Imperialism Decried
imperialism in South
America is arousing growing appre
hension, and the crux of the whole
question lies in whether it is the in
tention of the United States to help
or exploit these regions," said Profes
sor Martin. "The actual motives of
the United States are not fully under
stood, however, and the Nicaraguan
affair will do much to shape the minds
of southern leaders with respect to
this question." Though they welcome
relations with our country, they are
very much disturbed over the recent
imperialistic tendencies exhibited by
the United States.
The professor's primary purposes in
visiting South America were to gather
material for his courses, to prepare a
monograph for the Carnegie Institute
of Washington on the government of
Usuguay, and to collect material for
articles and for a book which he is
planning to write on the history of
Latin America.
Martin Honored
As a recognition of his work, Pro
fessor Martin was elected to the his
torical societies of Brazil, Argentina,
and Uruguay, and was made a fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society.
In the Near East he spent consider
able time studying the administration
of Palestine under the British man
date and investigating the Zionist
movement. He was greatly impressed
with the influence Great Britain has
exerted in developing the country.
"The mandate has proven tremendous
ly valuable to the country, and its
economic development since British
control went into effect, has been
amazing." Professor Martin approved
of the Zionist movement, which is
"partly religious and partly political
ancl has done a great deal to increase
the culture and economic development
region."
Mrs. Martin accompanied her hus
band on the European tour and the
visit to the Near East, but remained
in Europe when he left for South
America.
