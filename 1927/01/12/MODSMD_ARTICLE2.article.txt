# DEADLINE SET FOR SUBMITTING JUNIOR OPERA MANUSCRIPTS
## 
### 
January 30 is the last day on which
plots for the 1928 Junior Opera may
he turned in to the manuscript com
mittee of the production, according to
R. Frank Baker, chairman.
Since it is felt that the costume
type of play has been used too much
in the past few years, plots for the
opera with a modern setting are pre
ferred. Either type of play will be
considered, however.
In spite of the extra time allowed
for writers to get their manuscripts
in shhpe, Baker requests all those
submitting plots to send them to him
as soon as possible to box 1357, since
better consideration can be given
ideas with a longer time available.
Writers are to turn in a synopsis of
their plots together with an act of
their opera. Anyone not understanding
exactly what is wanted should tele
phone Baker for additional informa
tion.
