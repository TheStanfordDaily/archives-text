# CARDINAL FIVE MEETS PACIFIC COLLEGE TEAM
## Invading Hoop Squad Boasts Versatile Attack With Strong Defense CARDS HAVE LIGHT DRILL Swede Righter, Former Star For Stanford in 1921, Coaches Visitors 
### Fred Speers 
When Husky Hunt's varsity basket
ball team lines up against the College
of the Pacific five in the pavilion
tonight, the Cardinals will face a
quintet that has been pointing for the
Stanford scalp practically since the
game was scheduled. As a preliminary
the freshman team will meet the Palo
Alto High School cagers.
Coached by Swede Righter, former
Cardinal cage star in 1921, the Pacific
players present a well-organized ver
satile attacking team. On defensive
work the aggregation is particularly
strong, playing a man-for-man defense
almost to perfection.
Bryant to Start
As a starting lineup tonight Coach
Hunt will probably use McCandless
and Bryant at the forward berths. Cap
tain Nelson David will be injected into
the game to brace up the Cardinal at
tack as the game progresses. David's
work has been showing a steady im
provement. At floorwork and for a
keen knowledge of basketball he is
especially good though his basket
shooting has not yet come up to his
former standards. However, the Cardi
nal mentor is not looking for scorers
at present; he is seeking teamwork.
Fred Price, who saw action in the
game against St. Mary's, has been
troubled with poison oak and it is
doubtful if the former cage captain
will get into tonight's game. Christ
may be used, according to Hunt.
Vincenti May Play
Jayred at center, Biaggini and An
derson at the guard berths will prob
| ably make up the rest of the initial
lineup. Vincenti, excellent for offensive
work, will probably see action against
j the Pacific outfit tonight.
The College of the Pacific five is a
j speedy team, able to vary a short
passing and long passing game at will,
i They are of average height, perhaps
under the height of the Cardinal for
| wards and center. The Pacific team's
attack is built around Stark, left for
ward, Jacobi, running guard, and East
erbrook, center. Jacobi will be one of
the classiest performers on the court
tonight if his playing is up to par. He
I passes well with either hand, is
speedy, and goes well on defensive
| work.
Light Practice Held
Coach Hunt sent his men through a
light workout last night. Basket-shoot
i ing, going over several out-of-bounds
plays, and drill on foul-shooting took
| up the time. The squad is taking the
' Pacific game seriously and does not
i plan to save up for the subsequent
j games scheduled for the week-end.
When Swede Righter, coach of the
! visiting team, played on the Cardinal
outfit, Stanford defeated California
two games out of three in the series,
i though California claimed the Coast
j Championship by virtue of more out
j side games played. This was the last
time that Stanford has won the Cali-
;fornia series.
