# Roger Babson Criticizes
## 
### 
Mr. Roger Babson, with a passion for statistics, economy, and labor
saving devices, thinks a university should be operated under the same
system, and with the same end in view, under which Ford automobiles
are made in Detroit.
He thinks a college course should be cut to two years; students ought
to punch a time clock, work eight hours a day; habits of punctuality
should be more important than the smoke-laden dreams of a "bull
session."
He would get rid of all waste in production of 100 per cent efficient
college graduates.
He would like to see the ne'er-do-well, profligate sons of unknowing
parents, who waste their patrimony in idle amusements, ribald parties,
and indecorous conduct, reduced to the time-saving devices of up-to-date
factory efficiency.
For pointing out that much is wrong* with American colleges, we can
thank Mr. Babson, and heartily agree, at the same time pointing out that
such opinions, strangely enough, have been voiced by nearly every think
ing inmate of our institutions of learning since the beginning of our
educational system.
Mr. Babson's remedies are worthless.
The principle reason for this is that he has almost no conception of
the purpose of institutions of learning. He observes that certain rare
phenomena known as "scholars" emerge year after year from these
institutions, and that this species flowers more abundantly in Europe
than America.
He quotes statistics profusely to prove his point.
And with insurmountable logic, he devises ways and means of in
creasing production, reducing expenses, just as he would squeeze from
a gasping grain of wheat more food value per bushel, or sift from the
crushed rock of the earth a higher percentage of mineral.
Learning is largely concerned with philosophy, which has to do with
human values, not efficiency. Mr. Babson hasn't the philosophical sense
to appreciate this, and hasn't the ordinary sense to conceal his ignorance,
and as a result offers 1 expert opinion on a subject in which he demon
strates nothing more clearly than his own profound misunderstanding.
To begin with, nothing of philosophical value —granting that the
"higher learning" which Mr. Babson so deeply admires —is attained by
"increased production" methods. Clear thinking is not attained under
the whip-lash of a time-clock.
A college is not a mill in which so many yards of youth are inserted
in one funnel and a corresponding amount of cultured scholar emerges
from another funnel. To cut a college course to two years is to reduce
by half the amount of time for clear, lucid thinking, which after all is
the thing which wins Nobel prizes and produces "eminent scientists" for
whom Mr. Babson expresses such devout reverence.
There arc faults in our educational system, but Mr. Babson has but
Jightly touched upon them. His remedies would, if anything, increase
those faults now apparent. The great trouble with our universities is
that they turn out too many "machined products," reducible to the
statistical methods of Mr. Babson; and too few of the geniuses whom lie
so avidly but rather vaguely admires.
Remedies are of two kinds; one kind is put into a drawer for future
use. the other kind is dropped indifferently into the wastebasket.
Mr. Babson's remedies arc dropped indifferently into the wastebasket.

Now and then the world being what
it isn't, I'm able to write a word of
commendation of a real play, and to
day I commend to you "Cradle
Snatchers." Not for many months has
San Francisco had such a brilliant
chance to laugh its fool head off as
the Wilkes Theatre is offering now in
"The Cradle Snatchers."
It is a rowdy and a Raffish farce on
a theme hardly new—certainly not
newer than when Roman numerals
were in their glory—but deriving in
this use of it, I suspect, directly from
the spirit of feminism that is but
faintly and feebly expressed by the
Nineteenth Amendment. Three wives,
weary of neglect by their respective
mates, hire college boys to serve them
as escorts; there, in essence, is the
basis of a piece that, while it is bawdy
beyond anything else of native make
in recent seasons, is inordinately
funny.
Forty years ago the story would
have been rather extreme, because
women forty years ago might not have
been thought of as hiring some nice
boys to cure their husbands of the
world-old trick of going hunting for
ducks and bringing home chickens.
Each century calls us sirens by some
hew name, but they mean the same as
flappers do to this way-ahead era.
Once upon a time the pretty young
girls lured the waning beaux under
the name of chippies, the chickens,
then flappers—but they were the same
snares and dangers.
In this tine satire, this irresistible
hurricane of wit and fine humor, our
