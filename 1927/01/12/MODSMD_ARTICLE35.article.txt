# TELEGRAPH HELPED BY RADIO DECLARES WESTERN UNION MAN

"The radio has developed as well
as taken from the telegraph business,"
Bays William West, Palo Alto man
ager of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. This statement was issued
in response to a question often put to
Western Union officials concerning
the effect of radio on the older enter
prise. He explained that talk of quick
communications Und (inventions for
that purpose make more business for
every communication service.
"Every year since 1919 there has
been an increase in the volume of
tolls, except in 1921. At present the
volume is three times what it was in
1915. This growth is partly due to the
stimulus of the war, in which the
telegraph was used for communica
tions and for money transfers, and in
part to the intensive merchandising
of the service.
"On the cables the same develop
ment program has been followed, but
the result is not the same, because
the radio has absorbed some of the
growth. However, the radio com
panies' total transatlantic traffic an
nually does not amount to 25 per cent
of the transatlantic traffic carried by
Western Union alone, which is larger
than ever before in its history.
"Before the new high speed per
malloy cable to the Azores was laid
all Italian traffic went over the North
Atlantic cables via London. Contrary
to expectations, the diversion of that
traffic to the new cable decreased the
North Atlantic traffic only tempor
arily. That business is now greater
than ever and the new Italian cable
traffic is steadily growing."
