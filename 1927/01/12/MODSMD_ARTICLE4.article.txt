# STANFORD'S BEST SEASON EARNS FOOTBALL AWARD
## 
### 
Symbolic of the best year in foot
ball that Stanford has ever enjoyed,
the J. F. Rissraan trophy awarded the
eleven having the highest national
football standing for 1926, has been
assigned to the Trophy Room in the
Encina Gymnasium.
The two-foot trophy, which is a
silver eagle with wings outspread,
poised to take flight, will be awarded
annually under the rating system de
vised by Professor Frank Dickinson of
the University of Illinois. The award
was presented at Pasadena for the
team to Fred Swan by Coach Bob
Zuppke of Illinois, acting for Rissman
and Dickinson. This is the first year
it has been open for competition.
The new rating scheme gives Stan
ford 22.50 points, Annapolis 21.85,
Michigan 21.25, Notre Dame 21.25, and
Lafayette 20.0 for the first five teams
in the standing. The elevens from
Brown, West Point, and Alabama, all
rated unofficially as national leaders,
do not appear as high in the rating

I list as might be expected.
When Dickenson, who is professor
| of the Economics department at Illi
nois, brought out his system, he said
| that it does not rate a team until the
j .strength of its opponents has been
l laken into consideration. The teams
j in the conference under discussion are
I divided into two divisions at the end
I of the season, one for the teams with
I a percentage average of more than
.500, the other for those that fall below
that mark. When a team in the first
division defeats a team in the first
division it receives more points than
if it had defeated a team in the sec
ond classification. Likewise when an
eleven in the lower group defeats a
team in the first division, it receives
more points than if it were victor over
a second division team. A provision is
made whereby the aggregate points
allotted the teams are evenly divided
j in case of a tie.
The Stanford-Alabama game on Jan-
I uary 1 was not considered in these
1926 standings.
