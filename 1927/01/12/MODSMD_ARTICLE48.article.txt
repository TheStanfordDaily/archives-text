# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is probably the greatest ath
lete who ever went to Harvard. George
Owen, the lad who played football, not
because he got any pleasure out of it,
but because he thought it was his
duty, has passed from the gridiron no
doubt forever; and George Owen, the
versatile baseball star, has laid aside
his bat and glove; but George Owen,
the flash of the ice, is still to be seen
in action, and so there is still some
joy left in living.
For this Owen person was such a
treat to watch on the gridiron, dia
mond, and rink that it seems a shame
that he ever had to do anything else
but play football, baseball, and hockey.
George, perhaps, got 110 pleasure out
of his football —his looks certainly
belie that fact in the drawing—but he
gave pleasure to countless thousands
who enjoy seeing a natural-born ath
lete, and a true amateur, performing
with all the perfect co-ordination and
zest of a strong and agile body.
Listen to just a few of the feats
that George Owen performed while at
Harvard —but first let me amend my
statement about his "giving pleasure
to countless thousands," for he gave
110 pleasure at all to Yale and Prince
ton. His freshman year was only a
tip-off of what was to come, but even
then Ilia achievements in his three
favorite sports were truly remarkable.
In hockey, his playing was so sensa
tional that he was elected captain of
the team twice, and he played the
entire time of all of Harvard's games
during three years, his speed and un

canny stick work almost equaling that
] of the late Hobey Baker.
In baseball, after saving the Prince
ton series with a marvelous catch in
his sophomore year, and being elected
I baseball captain at the end of his
junior year, he made one of the most
phenomenal "last appearances" of any
I famous college athlete in the Yale
same in 1923. After striking out in the
eighth inning, he came to bat in the
: last of the ninth with two out, the
1 bases full, and Harvard needing three
! runs to win, and won the series with
\ a long hit.
George's chief football fame was
founded on his sixty-yard run through
' the entire Yale team in 1922, which
! led to his making the winning touch
! down a minute later; but his all
around play, both on attack and on de
fense in his sophomore and junior
| years, also stamped him with the mark
; of truly great.
j And he's only twenty-five years old
i now!


He Won Nine H's
