# SIX QUINTS TRIUMPH OVER OPPONENTS IN INTRAMURAL GAMES
## Chi Psi Men Down Babes in First Tangle of Day's Hoop Encounters

Chi-Psi 23, Encina 3E 7
Sigma Chi 11, Cardinals 5
Phi Delta Theta 29, Japanese Club 3
Indians 16, Encina 4W 2
Delta Kappa Epsilon 16, El Cuadro 8
Sigma Alpha Epsilon 22, Alpha
Kappa Lambda 12
Six teams, those of Chi Psi, Sigma
Chi, Phi Delta Theta, Indians, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, and Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon, emerged victorious in the games
played yesterday in the intramural
basketball series. Most of the encoun
ters were hard-fought, and the playing
exhibited was probably the best seen
in the series so far.
In spite of the rather lopsided 23 to
7 score in the Chi Psi-Encina 3E game
the freshmen were able to put up
enough opposition to make it the most
interesting of the afternoon's program.
Menzies and Clyne for the fraternity
team sounded the hall men's death
knell. The freshmen seemed to have
plenty of ability individually, but
failed to co-ordinate as a team.
Sigma Chi Opposed
The Sigma Chi five and the Cardi
nals staged the tightest battle of the
afternoon, the fraternity team emerg
ing at the long end of an 11 to 5 score.
The game was not as interesting, how
ever, as the lack of margin would seem
to indicate. Neither crew showed much
in the way of class in floorwork or
shooting.
Phi Delta Theta annihilated the
Japanese Club by a 29 to 3 tally. The
Japs started out well enough and
looked good until the Phi Delts got
into their stride. After that it was
simply a question of how much, Gari
baldi and Long running circles around
the losers and dropped the pellet
through the hoop with ease.
Indians Win
The first game of the evening was
a walkaway for the Indians. Assisted
by the five field goals made by Teloni
cher, the clubmen were able to hold
the freshmen down to two points in
the first half, and scoreless in the last.
El Cuadro made a game fight to
hold the Dekes, but short by eight
points. Praser, especially, had a streak
of bad luck throughout the game,
barely missing many hard throws.
Ogden at center for the Dekes was
high point man, making five tallies.
Uy far the most exciting game of the
day was that between S.A.E. and
A.K.L., resulting in the former coming
out on top with a 22 to 12 score. Ac
curate passes and clever dribbling
featured the play of both teams. Al
though the score at the half was tied
8 to 8, S.A.E. managed to make their
shots count, getting the lead and just
managing to keep it.
The games scheduled for tomorrow
are as follows:
4:15 —Sigma Nu vs. Encina basement.
4:50—El Tigre vs. Kappa Alpha.
s:2s—Encina 2W vs. Phi Kappa Sigma
7:15 —Phi Gamma Delta vs. Junipero

Six teams, those of Chi Psi, Sigma
Chi, Phi Delta Theta, Indians, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, and Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon, emerged victorious in the games
played yesterday in the intramural
basketball series. Most of the encoun
ters were hard-fought, and the playing
exhibited was probably the best seen
in the series so far.
In spite of the rather lopsided 23 to
7 score in the Chi Psi-Encina 3E game
the freshmen were able to put up
enough opposition to make it the most
interesting of the afternoon's program.
Menzies and Clyne for the fraternity
team sounded the hall men's death
knell. The freshmen seemed to have
plenty of ability individually, but
failed to co-ordinate as a team.
Sigma Chi Opposed
The Sigma Chi five and the Cardi
nals staged the tightest battle of the
afternoon, the fraternity team emerg
ing at the long end of an 11 to 5 score.
The game was not as interesting, how
ever, as the lack of margin would seem
to indicate. Neither crew showed much
in the way of class in floorwork or
shooting.
Phi Delta Theta annihilated the
Japanese Club by a 29 to 3 tally. The
Japs started out well enough and
looked good until the Phi Delts got
into their stride. After that it was
simply a question of how much, Gari
baldi and Long running circles around
the losers and dropped the pellet
through the hoop with ease.
Indians Win
The first game of the evening was
a walkaway for the Indians. Assisted
by the five field goals made by Teloni
cher, the clubmen were able to hold
the freshmen down to two points in
the first half, and scoreless in the last.
El Cuadro made a game fight to
hold the Dekes, but short by eight
points. Praser, especially, had a streak
of bad luck throughout the game,
barely missing many hard throws.
Ogden at center for the Dekes was
high point man, making five tallies.
Uy far the most exciting game of the
day was that between S.A.E. and
A.K.L., resulting in the former coming
out on top with a 22 to 12 score. Ac
curate passes and clever dribbling
featured the play of both teams. Al
though the score at the half was tied
8 to 8, S.A.E. managed to make their
shots count, getting the lead and just
managing to keep it.
