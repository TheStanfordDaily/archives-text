# GROWTH OF MUSIC SINCE WAR TRACED BY JEANNE DE MARE
## Blatant, Cynical at First; Now Allows Spiritual Expression 
### 
The development of modern music
since the war from a blatant and
cynical reflection of the world's unrest
at (bat time to its present condition of
a medium allowing the utmost in spir
itual expression was the keynote of
Jeanne de Mare's lecture on "Musical
Paris" delivered last night in the Little
Theatre.
Illustrating the steps in musical evo
lution since the war on the piano, the
ecturer made clear how the symbolism
so much used directly following the
war by such masters as Debussy has
been displaced by the simple works of
the latest writers of music.
It is the object of the modernists,
said Miss de Mare, to do away with
symbolism and substitute for it abso
lute simplicity. To do this, it was
necessary to break away from the
chords and scales which formed the
basis of classical music and to substi
tute in their place higher harmonic
forms and scales, a tendency which
was begun by the modernists directly
after the war. To secure an effect of
freedom and space, the authors first
used a "vertical" system of writing,
built on complicated new chords. Now
"horizontal writing" introduced by the
group of six, in which several poly
harmonic scales are used simultane
ously, is popular.
In illustrating the "vertical" type
of music the lecturer played Debussy'c
"Sunken Cathedral," in which the
supernatural theme is effectively
brought out by the use of chords. To
illustrate the horizontal form of writ
ing Miss de Mare played several se
lections from the operas "Judith" and
"King David" by Arthur Honnegar,
the outstanding musical figure in
Paris today.
