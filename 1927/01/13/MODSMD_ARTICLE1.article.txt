Encina 4W made a hard try to win
their game with Kappa Sig, but the
poor start they made in the first half

games in the intramural basketball
series was judged the winner by a
few points.
The first contest of the afternoon,
that between Sigma Nu and the En
cina Basement quintets, resulted in a
13 to G victory for the fraternity.
Mitchell of El Tigre accounted for
the six points that his team gathered,
but the Kappa Alpha men were able
to finish with three points more —just
enough to win. Davis played a good
game for the victors, making seven
tallies.
Encina Game Close
One of the most exciting struggles
of the day, the Encina 2W-Phi Kappa
game, was not decided until Rae
dropped the ball through the basket a
minute before the final gun. Saunders
and McCulloch of Phi Kappa and
Fishbeck, Allendorf, and Hartzell put
up good fights every minute they were
on the floor.
Mostly to the efforts of Joe Miller,
Phi Gamma Delta was able to nose
out the Junipero Serra team by a
scant three points. Miller not only
played an excellent game at guard, but
made enough baskets to bring nine
points to his team. The other four
men from Phi Gam, Klotz, Blazier,
Gregory, and Downing, displayed an
excellent type of basketball. Harold
and Harlow played the best among the
clubmen.
Moore Plays Well
Encina 4W made a hard try to win
their game with Kappa Sig, but the
poor start they made in the first half
finally brought about their defeat.
Moore played an all-around good game
for the fraternity, making eight of the
seventeen points. He was ably as
sisted by Wolf, Wilton, and Hoxie.
For the freshmen, Albertson, John
son, and Lasley were the outstanding
players.
