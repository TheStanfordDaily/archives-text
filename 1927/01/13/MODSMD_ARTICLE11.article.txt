# PLAN FOR DEBATE COUNCIL DISCUSSED By EUPHRONIANS
## Compact Organization and Small Size Advocated As Attributes 
### 
Small size and compact organization
wore advocated as desirable attributes
of the proposed debate council which
was discussed last night at a meeting
of the Euphronia Debating Society
held in the lobby of the Old Union.
Such a board, organized along the
general lines of the Dramatic Council
for the purpose of determining debat
! ing policies, is recommended by the
J society for incorporation in the new
Student Body constitution. This plan,
it is believed, will eliminate the divi
sion of responsibility and vagueness
of function which is present under the
present plan of joint control of foren
sic activities by the debate manager
and debate committee.
Debate Managers Discussed
Advantages and disadvantages of
| graduate debate managers and the
j question as to whether this office
i should be filled by an active debater
I were also discussed, but no definite
conclusion was arrived at.
"The dcfccts that do exist in debating
j at Stanford are not very great and there
j are none that cannot be overcome with a
little more work," stated Harold Peter
i son, former president of Euphronia, who
j spoke on "The Faults of Debating."
Peterson, speaking from the audience's
viewpoint, criticized the choice of "box
office subjects" for forensic contests, de
signed to attract crowds, and suggested
that as debating only attracted a limited
number of people anyway, it was advis
able to discuss subjects which would ap
peal to them rather than to attempt, to
draw large audiences. The speaker also
urged that debaters should make a more
thorough study of every aspect of the
i topic under discussion and should avoid
ancient witticisms in their speeches.
Faults of Debating
John C. Duniway, who considered the
j faults of debating from the debaters' out
j look, laid stress on the importance of
j exhaustive research in preparation for an
| argument and criticized the present ten
; dency to over emphasize wit and grace
till delivery in place of a knowledge and
presentation of concrete facts. Duniway
j also advocated allowing more opportunity
| for a large number of speakers to gain
| experience rather than developing a
| small group of men who participate in
all contests.
"Debaters get their full share of the
; limelight at Stanford," Duniway stated,
and they should get over the idea that
they deserve a lot of publicity.
Tryoutees for membership in Euphro
nia will lie given an opportunity to speak
before the society next Thursday eve
ning in the Old Union. The subject is
to be "The Merits of the Automobile
j on the Campus."
