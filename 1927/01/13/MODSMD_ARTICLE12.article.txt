# HARVARD "CRIMSON" LEARNS ALL ABOUT WOMEN STANFORD DEBATER SLIPS EARFUL TO PUBLIC TURKEL HURLS PHI BETE EPITHET AT "500"
## 
### 
Stanford's debaters now represent-1
; ing the University in the East have j
been telling talqs out of school.
"After a critical examination of the j
I 500 women students in our college, I
think that it is perfectly true that
' beauty and brains do not go toget her,"
: is the weighed and considered state
ment. which H. R. Turkel, senior mem
ber of the forensic duo, made to a re
porter on the Harvard "Crimson."
Nor did Turkel ease up after cross
j Ing his Rubicon. He insinuates that"
the members of the 500 are hopeless
Phi Betes and that they look down on
the male element. Here are his words:
"In Leland Stanford, the women |
I students are specially chosen, with
| the result that they are of high schol- J
astlc standing and spend most of their
time studying. They feel honored that
they are the chosen 500 of the college
and, due to their elevated scholastic
position, look down on the men stu
dents. As a whole, however, I have
found that eft-education has a tendency'
to lower the generftl scholastic aver-
UKO."
â€¢ The inquiring reporter further
probed Turkel, and he concluded with
the following:

"I find the West a great deal freer
in dress, speech, and friendship. I
miss the 'hello' spirit, the free and
easy attitude, the corduroy trousers
and the sweaters. A necktie is the
distinguishing mark of a professor."
Fred Combellack was more reserved
in his statements to the press and
confined himself to a comparison of
the Harvard club-table system of food
dispensing with the Stanford eating
club.
Praise for the manner in which the
team acquitted itself in the Harvard
debate was received today by Profes
sor J. G. Emerson, faculty advisor of
debate, In a letter from George N.
Crocker, '26, now studying in the Har
vard Law School. Crocker stated that
in his opinion Combellack and Turkel
conducted themselves as worthy repre
sentatives, that they spoke with grace
and sound argument, and that they
were clearly the victors.
