# YEARLING FIVE DROPS SECOND CONTEST TO PALO ALTO HIGH 19-8
## 
### Merle Emry 
The Palo Alto High School basket
ball team handed the freshman five
its second straight defeat of the sea
son last night by the score of 19-8.
Inability of the Babes to change
from a defensive to an offensive posi
tion which consequently caused them
to lose the ball frequently and not
being able to count the shots they
tried for, were the outstanding rea
sons for their loss.
The Palo Alto boys, on the other
hand, presented an aggregation which
is above the average and would make
most college teams hump to win over
them. Parks, guard, was high-point
man of the game, being good for
eight counts. Others on Coach Ray's
quintet who showed ability were Mc-
Lachlan, guard, and Ethen, forward.
It was due to their fast ahd accurate
passing that enabled their teammates
to win so decisively.
The score at the end of the first
half was 4-2 in favor of Palo Alto. Up
to this time the babes showed some
real skill, but the lack of experience
handicapped them during the second
half.
The freshmen have improved since
the game with Pacific Grove last week
and with more accurate shooting and
smoother passing they should be under
way soon. Tomorrow night they meet
the Roosevelt High School from Oak
land.
The yearlings who started the game
were:' Berg and Stewart at forward
positions, Bush, center, and Smith and
Simpkins, guarding.
