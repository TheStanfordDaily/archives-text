# STANFORD STUDENTS SQUANDER THOUSANDS IN CUTTING CLASSES
## 
### 
Stanford students every year squan
der $24,000 without ever reaching into
their pockets to pay it out. In blissful
ignorance the average Stanford stu
dent sustains an annual loss of $7.68.
If he spends 15 hours a week in
classes for 30 weeks, the result is 450
hours spent in classrooms every year.
Since the said student pays a tuition
of $2SS for the same length of time,
ordinary division gives us $.64 per
hour expended by the seeker after
higher education.
Considering that the student is
average, he will take four cuts a quar
ter, or twelve a year—which throws
away $7.68 annually. This unimposing
sum takes on somewhat collosall pro
portions when it is multiplied by the
3125 students now attending the Uni
versity. One does not smile at $24,000
—not when one throws it away.
It would be sufficient to supply the
whole student body and faculty with
galoshes. It would place 9600 of the
last ten years' best sellers on the
shelves of the library.
Better still, it would just cover the
cost of a bicycle for every one of our
"500."
