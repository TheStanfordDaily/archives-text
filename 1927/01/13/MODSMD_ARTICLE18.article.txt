# CARD BASKETERS COME BACK TO BEAT PACIFIC 23 TO 15
## Visitors Unable to Tally Single Field Goal in Second Period BRYANT SHOWS UP WELL Tiger Cagers Lead at Half Time by Score of 12 to 8 
### Fred Speers 
Maybe they didn't play Class A bas
ketball but they surely did fight. Com
ing from behind in the second half
with a terriffic wallop Stanford trim
med the College of the Pacific last
night 23 to 15 in the pavilion and held
the /visitors to no field goals in the
final period.
Close guarding on the part of Biag
gin and Vincenti checked the Tiger
offensive work in the second half.
Time and again a Pacific ace would
slip through only to find both Cardinal
guards waiting for him. On the attack,
McCandless, Bryant, and Jayred each
played an individually strong attack
ing game. McCandless tied with Stark,
Pacific forward, for high-point honors,
each netting eight tallies.
Tigers Lead at Half
It. was all Pacific in the first half
but the visitors simply didn't have
a look-in when Hunt's men unlimbered
their attack in the second half. The
Orange and Black team led at half
time, 12 to 8, but found the pace too
fast for them in the closing session.
Opening in good form, Stark began
the evening's scoring with a field goal
and free throw in the first few minutes
of play. McCandless tied the score
shortly afterward. During the first
half Easterbrook, Pacific center,
showed a dead-eye for fouls, sinking
three of them in rapid succession.
New Forwards Used
The Cardinal passing seemed to be
off form in the first half while the
Tigers, all individually good players,
played a hard passing game that Stan
ford was unable to solve during the
first half. Late in this period Hunt
sent in a new set of forwards, Price
and David going in for McCandless
and Bryant, and Dobson was substi
tuted for Jayred.
Stanford's new combination braced
the Cardinal attack but was unable to
overcome the lead Easterbrook's foul
shooting had established at first.
With the scoreboard reading against
them, Hunt's men, using the starting
lineup (McCandless, Jayred, and Bryant)
opened a brilliant attack. Early in this
period Anderson was jerked on fouls, al
lowing Vincenti to go in.
Vincenti Scores
The score 14 to 13 with Pacific in the
lead, both teams battled without register
ing until Vincenti, after half a dozen
tries, sank a long field goal to put the
Cardinals in the lead for the first time in
the game.
That score uncorked a bewildering
Stanford attack. Bryant sank three field
goals, and McCandless and Jayred two
more. Price, sent in for McCandless,
added another. The Stanford attack was
more in the nature of excellent individual
playing, the Card scores in several in
stances coming after taking the ball away
from a Pacific man rather than making
scores through an organized attack.
Price's basket which ended the Cardi
nal scoring came after a long dribble
through the Tiger outfit. His playing in
the last half was some of the most ag
gressive work shown by the Cardinals
last night. ' Under the Cardinal basket
Vincenti and Biaggini working in per
fect co-ordination repeatedly checked a
Pacific attack.

Orange and Black team led at half
time, 12 to 8, but found the pace too
fast for them in the closing session.
Opening in good form, Stark began
the evening's scoring with a field goal
and free throw in the first few minutes
of play. McCandless tied the score
shortly afterward. During the first
half Easterbrook, Pacific center,
showed a dead-eye for fouls, sinking
three of them in rapid succession.
New Forwards Used
The Cardinal passing seemed to be
off form in the first half while the
Tigers, all individually good players,
played a hard passing game that Stan
ford was unable to solve during the
first half. Late in this period Hunt
sent in a new set of forwards, Price
and David going in for McCandless
and Bryant, and Dobson was substi
tuted for Jayred.
Stanford's new combination braced
the Cardinal attack but was unable to
overcome the lead Easterbrook's foul
shooting had established at first.
With the scoreboard reading against
them, Hunt's men, using the starting
lineup (McCandless, Jayred, and Bryant)
opened a brilliant attack. Early in this
period Anderson was jerked on fouls, al
lowing Vincenti to go in.
Vincenti Scores
The score 14 to 13 with Pacific in the
lead, both teams battled without register
ing until Vincenti, after half a dozen
tries, sank a long field goal to put the
Cardinals in the lead for the first time in
the game.
That score uncorked a bewildering
Stanford attack. Bryant sank three field
goals, and McCandless and Jayred two
more. Price, sent in for McCandless,
added another. The Stanford attack was
more in the nature of excellent individual
playing, the Card scores in several in
stances coming after taking the ball away
from a Pacific man rather than making
scores through an organized attack.
Price's basket which ended the Cardi
nal scoring came after a long dribble
through the Tiger outfit. His playing in
the last half was some of the most ag
gressive work shown by the Cardinals
last night. ' Under the Cardinal basket
Vincenti and Biaggini working in per
fect co-ordination repeatedly checked a
Pacific attack.

lowing Vincenti to go in.
Vincenti Scores
The score 14 to 13 with Pacific in the
lead, both teams battled without register
ing until Vincenti, after half a dozen
tries, sank a long field goal to put the
Cardinals in the lead for the first time in
the game.
That score uncorked a bewildering
Stanford attack. Bryant sank three field
goals, and McCandless and Jayred two
more. Price, sent in for McCandless,
added another. The Stanford attack was
more in the nature of excellent individual
playing, the Card scores in several in
stances coming after taking the ball away
from a Pacific man rather than making
scores through an organized attack.
Price's basket which ended the Cardi
nal scoring came after a long dribble
through the Tiger outfit. His playing in
the last half was some of the most ag
gressive work shown by the Cardinals
last night. ' Under the Cardinal basket
Vincenti and Biaggini working in per
fect co-ordination repeatedly checked a
Pacific attack.
