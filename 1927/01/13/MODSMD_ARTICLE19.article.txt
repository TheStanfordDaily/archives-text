## 
### 
Two Palo Alto artists will appear as
soloists on the program which will be
! given Saturday, January 22, in the bas
ketball pavilion, by the combined Cali
j fornia and Stanford glee clubs.
Marie de Forest Emery, soprano, will
sing a group of solo selections and one
number with the Stanford Glee Club, the
| old Scotch air of Loch Lomond.
Bolton White, violinist, will also assist
the club. He has appeared with the or
ganization at previous performances with
great success. White will play a group
lof solos and will also give the violin
obligato for the choral rendition of
j Schubert's Serenade.
The glee club itself will be heard in
i some entirely new numbers, including be
j sides the Schubert Serenade, "De Ol'
[ Ark's a-Moverin'," a brilliant arrange
| nient of the old negro spiritual by Guion,
and Charles Wakefield Cadman's stir
i ring song, "The Builder."
The composer Hoist's "Dirge for Two
j Veterans," an impressive musical setting
for Walt Whitman's poem of the same
I name, from last year's glee club pro
j gram, will be repeated.
In addition the club will sing the finale
; from Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera,
| "The Gondoliers." The latter number
! will be a foretaste of the type of thing
that may be expcctcd at the presentation
of "Princess Ida," an opera by the same
| authors, on February 25.
The Stanford and California j'lcc clubs
will combine into one large chorus for
the rendition of the college songs and
hymns. The two organizations will be
combined also in the giving of some
classic number known to both clubs.
