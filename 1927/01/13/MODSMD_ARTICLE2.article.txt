Winning l>y unanimous affirmative
vote of three judges, tho Stanford De
bating Team defeated the Harvard
team last week on the subject, "Re
solved, That we have more to fear,
than to hope for from science." Stan- i
ford had the negative side of the ques
tion. J. S. P. Tatlock, formerly of the
English department of Stanford, and
now of Harvard, presided.
Featured as the first Harvard der
bate with a far-western university,
this contest was given considerable i
space in the Harvard "Crimson" with
a picture of Professor Tatlock. A j
letter to Stanford from George
Crocker, a former Stanford student
who witnessed the debate, especially
praised the keenness of the Stanford
debaters.
