# Brains and Beauty
## 
### 
In the Harvard Crimson an interview with one of the Stanford de
haters appears in which the Western student is quoted as saying the fol
lowing in reference to Stanford women: "After a critical examination
of the 500 women students in our college, I think that it is perfectly
true that beauty and brains* do not go together."
From the above statement it may be gathered that the debater is re
ferring to a high scholastic standard and a rather low grade of beauty
among the Stanford women. It seems that when a man has an opinion
of this nature about a group of women, that he should keep it a dark
secret, and treasure the belief in his own mind and heart. We are not
going to state whether we believe the debater is right or wrong for the
man made a "critical examination" of the case. Regardless of one's
opinion, one never tells the proud mother that her child is bad looking.
If the book of etiquette had been referred to, it probably would have
told the gentleman student that he should under no consideration, run
down the name of any particular woman or any particular group of
women. Out of mere politeness, or if you will, out of mere tradition,
a gentleman should never say things of a degrading nature in reference
to the weaker sex.
The men at Harvard, and other Eastern colleges, too, for that matter,
should be given the chance to come to this campus and make up their
own opinion as to the quality and quantity of beauty possessed by the
women of Stanford. As it is now their minds are polluted on the
subject. Such statements not only give the women a decided "black eye,"
but they also hurt the University.
