# Delays and Complications
## 
### 
During the first part of November the W.A.A. held an open meeting
and voted to tax eacli member two dollars which was to be used toward
building a lodge on Lake Searsville. Immediately close to one hundred
and forty of the women, most likely those who neglected to attend the
meeting, signed a petition asking for a re-vote on the subject. By so
doing the process of collecting the money and speeding the construction
of the lodge was unnecessarily delayed and complicated.
The uselessness of the gesture was shown when in yesterday's columns
the announcement was made that at a special election the assessment was
definitely sanctioned.
It seems that the desire to attach one's cognomen to a document of
some sort, especially a petition, often provided excellent entertainment
for some people who have nothing else to do. With the enthusiasm of
that good old mob spirit touching the emotions of people, names can be
secured for any kind of petition.
