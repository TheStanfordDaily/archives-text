As part of an audience that alter
nately hooted and groaned we last night
witnessed what is undoubtedly the most
absurd portrayal of college life with
which Hollywood has yet insulted the
American intelligence. We refer to that
abortion upon the cinematographic art,
"The Plastic Age.''
Be it said to the credit of Percy Marks
that the worst parts of this picture have
nothing to do with his book, although
that creation was rather a foul ball in
itself. Whatever the distinguished Marks
failed to do by way of making the uni
versity ludicrous, a certain B. P. Schul
berg and one Wesley Ruggles have done
with a vengeance. The result stands as a
monument to Hollywood's faith in the
credulity of the enlightened public.
The feature part in the production is
taken by the same Clara Bow who, all
uninvited, capered and cavorted in front
of the Stanford rooting section at the
recent Big Game. One of our well-read
associates informs us that the famed Eli
nor Glyn remarked of this young actress,
"She is one woman who has 'It' in super
abundance." If by "It" Madame Glyn
referred to a complete mastery of the

provocative technique of a street-walker,
we stand willing to agree that Miss Bow
probably possesses that commodity to a
degree that establishes a world record.
Be that as it may, what Miss Bow does
to the role of Cynthia Day (who be
comes a co-ed in the movie version) is
nobody's business.
From start to finish, the whoje affair
follows the form of the traditional mov
ing picture college story. It opens with
the unhappy spectacle of thtv so-called
hero accidentally dropping his highly
protective if none-too-beautiful under
clothing upon the steps of his dormitory,
to the accompaniment of the jeers and
cat-calls of his fellows; and it ends, with
a long and clinging kiss after having
shown how the anemic leading man
saved the honor of his alma mater by
dashing one hundred and ten yards to a
touchdown.

By way of closing, let it be said that
the producers of this film averted the
commission of a crime against all col
lege men and women only by over shoot
ing the mark. The picture is so ridicu
lous that nobody would believe it.
