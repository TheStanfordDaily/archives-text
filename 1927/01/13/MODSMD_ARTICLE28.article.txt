# CABBAGES and THINGS

### The King 
Just a little sidelight on those "All-
American" elevens the Eastern papers
and others only recently tired of
selecting:
Before the Alabama game the Chi
cago Herald-Examiner ran photos of
Murphy and Hyland, Cardinal halves,
labeling them TROJANS who were
expected to star.
As Hyland or Murphy might say,
succinctly, yet with a certain quaint
emphasis: " !!!"
* * *
Ludicrous consequence of using
football battle publicity methods for
intellectual tiddle-de-winks.
Headlines blurbed: STANFORD
BEATS HARVARD IN DEBATE. On
closer view it seems merely that re
putedly "highbrow" Cambridge, Massa
chusetts, mustered an audience of
about a hundred. Four eager young
men spoke, two of whom had traveled
from the Pacific Coast. An audience
vote, 52-47.
* * *
Experiments testing Einsteinian
theory indicate an "ether drift" of
some four miles a second.
Now one can think of the earth as
plowing through nothingness at 240
miles an hour or as nothirigness blow
ing through the earth at 240 miles an
hour.
Ether way is just as good.
* « *
Speaking of romance, there ARE cer
tain disadvantages to Lagunita canoes.
For one thing, they tip over.

While of very minor importance
relative to the magnitude of "The
Miracle" as a dg&matic and artistic
triumph, remark that the original
script was modified may be of archae
ological interest.
* * •
•
Reverent, inspiringly religious and
from its nature beyond the reach of
professional moralists' stick paws if
ever a play was, nevertheless "The
Miracle" had to be (or was, at least)
"toned down" in several scenes for
presentation to San Francisco and
sixteen-year-olds of both sexes. For
instance, one entire scene was cut out,
in which the errant nun's child was
born in a manger symbolic of the
Nativity.
* * •
But what a lot of the "common con
sciousness of being human" is veiled
behind the sensitive tissue of social
conventions we try oh so hard to
protect, in public at least! Literary
and other artists driven to extremes
by the urge to portray all the phases
of life as they see it (or call the urge
whatever names you prefer) must
envy the "Piper." The way he "made
faces" would be difficult to deny the
mails. Yet he got across dramatic and
emotional effects which words or print
would have weakened or confused.
* * *
How's this for a surprise role, Cab
bages as amateur dramatic critic?

bages as amateur dramatic critic?
Just a little sidelight on those "All-
American" elevens the Eastern papers
and others only recently tired of
selecting:
Before the Alabama game the Chi
cago Herald-Examiner ran photos of
Murphy and Hyland, Cardinal halves,
labeling them TROJANS who were
expected to star.
As Hyland or Murphy might say,
succinctly, yet with a certain quaint
emphasis: " !!!"
* * *
Ludicrous consequence of using
football battle publicity methods for
intellectual tiddle-de-winks.
Headlines blurbed: STANFORD
BEATS HARVARD IN DEBATE. On
closer view it seems merely that re
putedly "highbrow" Cambridge, Massa
chusetts, mustered an audience of
about a hundred. Four eager young
men spoke, two of whom had traveled
from the Pacific Coast. An audience
vote, 52-47.

Experiments testing Einsteinian
theory indicate an "ether drift" of
some four miles a second.
Now one can think of the earth as
plowing through nothingness at 240
miles an hour or as nothirigness blow
ing through the earth at 240 miles an
hour.
Ether way is just as good.

Speaking of romance, there ARE cer
tain disadvantages to Lagunita canoes.
For one thing, they tip over.

While of very minor importance
relative to the magnitude of "The
Miracle" as a dg&matic and artistic
triumph, remark that the original
script was modified may be of archae
ological interest.

Reverent, inspiringly religious and
from its nature beyond the reach of
professional moralists' stick paws if
ever a play was, nevertheless "The
Miracle" had to be (or was, at least)
"toned down" in several scenes for
presentation to San Francisco and
sixteen-year-olds of both sexes. For
instance, one entire scene was cut out,
in which the errant nun's child was
born in a manger symbolic of the
Nativity.

But what a lot of the "common con
sciousness of being human" is veiled
behind the sensitive tissue of social
conventions we try oh so hard to
protect, in public at least! Literary
and other artists driven to extremes
by the urge to portray all the phases
of life as they see it (or call the urge
whatever names you prefer) must
envy the "Piper." The way he "made
faces" would be difficult to deny the
mails. Yet he got across dramatic and
emotional effects which words or print
would have weakened or confused.

How's this for a surprise role, Cab
bages as amateur dramatic critic?
