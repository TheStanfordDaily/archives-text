The Editor, Stanford Daily:
As a Stanford Alumna, I would like
to send my protest against any more
New Year's Karnes in the Rose Bowl
at Pasadena. This past New Year's
game was the first I have attended and
also the last. It is all wrong—decidedly
all wrong, excepting from the financial
end. And money should not rule real
sports.
Until I saw for myself, I could not
understand the students' objections to
it. I do now. We are all familiar with
the big objection—the break in train
ing, then its resumption and the long
drawn out season. But to me and to
many others to whom I have talked,
the outstanding argument against this
game is that it is not and can not be a
real college contest, no matter what
colleges play, because the spirit, that
should be everything, is wrong.
You felt oppressed by it from all
over the stadium. I think this was one
factor that, perhaps unconsciously, af
fected our boys' playing. It could not
help it. Here we took our beloved
team, placed them in the Rose Bowl,
and said, "There! Win if you can,
boys, but remember you are playing
especially to delight and amuse all
these tourißts and sightseors!"
The Attending Majority did not real
ly care which team won, as long as
they were entertained. It might Just
as well have been a professional game!
A game at such a place and time
has nothing whatever to do with col
lege sports.
I am very much in favor of East-

West games, and would like to see
them played here —yearly—but play
them close to the season and near
home, and by all means in a College
stadium. By all means!
-—Hallie Hyde Irwin, Stanford '98.
