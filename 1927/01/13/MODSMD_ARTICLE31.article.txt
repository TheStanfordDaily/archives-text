# JUNIORS TAKE LEAD IN INTERCLASS RACE BY BASKETBALL WIN
## 
### 
With the completion of the first two
sports on the interelass schedule, the
juniors have assumed a lead over the
other classes in the race for honors.
By winning basketball and taking a
third in football the third-year men
have acquired seven points, which
gives them a one-point advantage over
the sophomores and seniors, who are
tied for second place.
The sophomores got their position
by taking seconds in both sports,
while the seniors, although winning
football, lost all of their basketball
games. The freshmen up to now have
gathered only three points.
The next the interelass
schedule is swimming, which will be
followed by baseball and track later
in the quarter.
