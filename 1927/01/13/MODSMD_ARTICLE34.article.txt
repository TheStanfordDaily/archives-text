# OSBORNE DISCUSSES DISPUTE OF N.C.A.A., OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION
## Action of Collegiate Body Like That of Boy Who Must Be Captain 
### 
With the recent break between the I
National Collegiate Athletic Associa- I
tion and the Olympic Association caus- i
ing much comment in the press anil
many erroneous statements by the
uninformed, S. de J. Osborne, in the
Harvard Crimson, seeks to clear the
trouble with what he considers a cor
rect estimate of the situation.
Osborne, former Harvard track and ;
football manager, has been much in
terested in the rift of the two or- j
ganizations, and speaks with the au- \
thority of one who knows the inti- j
mate details. His explanation, in part,
follows:
"The Association was started about j
twenty years ago for the avowed pur- j
pose of cleaning up football and other
sports that were being conducted on
a very low moral standard. Football
had got away from the rules, and ,
scandal and rough play were the order i
of the day. The old mass plays were
injuring innumerable players and the
game had reached such a state that
many of the larger colleges either;
dropped the sport, as did Columbia j
and the California institutions, or j
were seriously considering such ac- j
tion.
"It was never meant to be an execu
tive or an administrative body, but
merely an advisory association to help j
the colleges solve their troubles by
giving them the aid of the experience :
of other college men. It to be
merely an advisory committee, and ;
was to force its decisions on no col-1
lege that did not side with its views !
even after an unanimous vote in the J
convention.
"As an administrative group it has
no place in athletics."
And here Osborne compares the re
cent actions of the Association in no
uncertain terms: "The break with the
Olympic Committee borders on the
ridiculous and can be likened to the i
action of a little boy not playing the
game if he cannot be captain."
Defends A.A.U.
Then Osborne defends the A.A.U. |
against "mostly unfounded" attacks by

the N.C.A.A. which have received a
hearing by all college men because
of the "potent name that the N.C.A.A.
has, to which it is hardly entitled."
In conclusion, he says:"It is merely
a gesture on the part of a few dis
gruntled people who are using the
name of the Association to further
their own purpose. As long as the
N.C.A.A. sticks to its advisory capa
city it will survive as a useful body
in American athletic life, the minute
it tries the administrative field, as it
is weakly doing now, the N.C.A.A.
will cease to exist."
