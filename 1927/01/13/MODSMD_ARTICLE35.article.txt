Preliminary baseball practice began
yesterday afternoon when Coach

pects, both varsity and freshmen,
through their first spring workout. Al
though several members of last year's
varsity and others are not yet out
for practice, over forty have already
reported.
Eleven veterans from the trip to the
Orient will return this year. Steve
Collins, pitcher, is captain. Wolter put
the returning lettermen of last year
through some batting and fielding
practice and dismissed them. New
players and members of last year's
freshman team played a practice game
with Doug Lewis, last year's frosh
pitcher, and Nissen as catcher for
one team, and the varsity battery of
Sobieski and Sypher for the opposing
nine.
A complete sohedule for the coming
baseball season has not yet been fin
ished, but the first game will be
played early in February, according
to Benny Kraft, senior manager of the
team. Practices will be held every day
from now on in order to get the team
ready for the first practice games.
