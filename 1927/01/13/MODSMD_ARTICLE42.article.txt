# Navy Utilizes Movies As Recruiting Agency
## 
### 
A new use has been found for the
movieâ€”that of stimulating recruiting
for the United States Navy. During a
recent showing in Los Angeles of
"We're in the Navy Now," a bur
lesque of naval life, the local station
not only made a record in the number
of men applying for the month, but
almost doubled her quota of accept
ances.
Much of the credit for this sudden
interest in the life of a sailor was
due to the amusing experiences of the
Wallace IJeery and Raymond Hatton
jn the film version, said Captain D. T.
Ghent, officer in charge, in a letter
published at the time of his report.
