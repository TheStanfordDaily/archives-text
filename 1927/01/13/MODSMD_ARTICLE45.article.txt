# ORGANIST TO INCLUDE RHEINBERGR NUMBER IN TODAY'S PROGRAM
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will play a varied program today
at 4:15 in the Memorial Church, con
taining several seldom heard selec
tions by modern and classical com
posers.
"Vesper Processional" by Rheinber
ger will be included. Rheinberger
lived from 1839 to 190 1 ! during the
triumph of Wagner; but he resisted
the Wagnerian influence. One author
ity thus describes his work: "Rheiu
i)erger's individuality is faithfully re
fleeted in his compositions. Thorough
ness and unpretentiousness are quali
ties equally characteristic of the artist
and his work. His themes are for the
most part of great beauty."
Rachmaninoff is represented by his
well-known "Prelude in G Minor." He
is considered one of the most talented
of the younger Moscow school of com
posers. Several of his songs aud piano
pieces, especially the famous Prelude
in C Sharp Minor, have attained im
mense popularity.
Arcadelt, whose "Ave Maria" is be
ing played as a transcription by Liszt,
"was a leading member of the Nether
land school in the 16th century and
did much to bring about the revival
of music in Italy at that time. Brewer
has been a composer and organist of
note in Gloucester, England.
The program will be as follows:
