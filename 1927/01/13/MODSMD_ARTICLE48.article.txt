# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Last week I drew some freak baseball shots. Here are some more oddities
of the court same for your inspection, the oddest of all being Mr. George
Kennedy, of Chillicothe, Mo., who is the "tall man" of a carnical company
during the summer, and a basketball star with a business college five during
the winter. George is just eight feet from the top fo his head to the soles of
his feet, as the crow flies.
Next consider the brothers McNichol, of basketball fame at the University
of Pennsylvania. In 1923, five of this remarkable family defeated the Penn
varsity in a basketball game, 23 to 19. Seven sons of the late Senator James
P. McNichol went to Penn., and five of them, Eddie, Jimmie, Harry, Danny, and
Johnny, starred on the basketball courts. In the game against the Red and
Blue, Johnny caged fifteen out of eighteen free throws, and Eddie, who is
the coach at Penn., once set a record by shooting twenty-two consecutive foul
goals. The McNichols are not the only ones to boast of a complete basketball
team in the family. There are the Cunninghams, of Wahoo, Neb., for instance,
and the Hueys, of Louisville, Kansas. The prize goes to the latter clan, for
there is a substitute of tender years for the brothers' five, and six sisters,
who also constitute a family team.
Next comes Mr. Earl Drew, of the university made famous by Harold
Grange and Harold Osborn. Earl has hands like tha proverbial hams, and can
hold a regulation basketball from the top, with either mitt. He, too, lias
company in his ability to thus defy the laws of gravity, for Lloyd Sheetz, of
Montmorency, Ind., boasts of a hand span of 10 5-8 inches. E. Blankenbecler,
of Kansas, and "Horse" Gillium, of New Castle, Pa., can also do the same
stunt.
Last, but not least, is George Thompson, of Passaic High School, New
Jersey, who once scored 1,000 points in a single season. George played on
the famous team which won 159 consecutive victories from March 1919 to
February 1925.
