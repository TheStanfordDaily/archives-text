"Stanford should have a promising fu
ture in the cement field as the founda

the students are sincere in their work."
With this statement, R; C. Buell, Field
Engineer of the Riverside Portland Ce
ment Company, yesterday concluded a
series of five lectures given here under
the direction of the Civil Engineering
department on recent developments in
the design of concrete mixtures, fine
ness modulus, use of admixtures and
proper curing, and water cement ratio.
Commenting on the standing of the
Pacific Coast in cement manufacture, the
lecturer stated that the brand of con

of high quality and surpassed the East
ern and Central Western cement progress
in the matter of strength.
Buell will next give a series of similar
lectures at Fresno State College.
