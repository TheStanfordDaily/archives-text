Sequoia I 22, Branner 15
Phi Sigma Kappa 17, El Capitan 7
Alpha Delta Phi 34, Encina 2E 8
Initial games in the second round
of the intramural basketball play were
run off last night in the gymnasium,
with the Delta Chi, Sequoia I, Phi
Sigma Kappa, and Alpha Delta Phi
teams coming out victorious. Teams
on the losing end of the day's play
were Phi Psi, Branner, El Capitan,
and Encina 2E.
While the afternoon games were
good examples of real basketball, the
evening contests were little less than
walk aways. Encina 2E received the
worst drubbing, being snowed under
by the Alpha Delta Phi's by a score
•of 34 to 8.
Paxton Cinches Game
The Phi Psi-Delta Chi conflict was
one of those long, extra-time affairs
which are driving the campus cooks
distracted because the boys get home
late for dinner. The score stood at 13-
all at the end of the second half; so
another five minutes was needed to
settle the matter. Paxton, Delta Chi
forward, took a great spurt and in
some of the fastest, trickiest playing
of the afternoon, sank the ball through
the lace curtain for the winning goals.
The final score was 17-13.
The game itself was furious, but
marked by a copious amount of wild
shots at the basket. Prince was the
losers' high-scorer, being responsible
for six tallies. He led the attack which
saw the Phi Psi's ahead until nearly
the end of the game.
Newcomb looped one of the prettiest
shots of the afternoon from mid-floor
soon after the second half opened,
