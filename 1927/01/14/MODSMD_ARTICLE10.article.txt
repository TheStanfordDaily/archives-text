## 
### 
Writing with the authority of
one intimate with the significant
details of the sundering of rela
tionships between the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
and the Olympic Association,
Harry W. Maloney states his view
point of the condition in the fol
lowing article:
BY HARRY MALONEY
I have read with much interest the
article which appeared yesterday in
the Daily, written for the Harvard
Crimson by S. de J. Osborne, Har
vard, which relates to the break be
tween the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and the Olympic Associa
tion.
Rlr. Osborne's article mentions in
detail the reasons for the break and
when he states that the rift between
these athletic groups "can be likened
to the action of a little boy not play
ing the game if he cannot be captain,"
he surely places his finger on the sore
spot. During the recent convention of
the American Olympic Association
held in Washington, D.C., the writer,
who was a delegate from Stanford
representing the Inter-Collegiate
Rugby Association, was honored by
being made a member of the Nominat
ing Committee consisting of five. This
committee sat in session for over
three hours trying to agree on a slate
which would contain the names of
men irrespective of affiliations, who
were prominent as leaders and edu
cators in the field of amateur sport.
Competent Men Needed
The Nominating Committee realized
that upon these men, the future of
ficers of the Association, would de
pend the failure or success of Amer
ica's participation in the Olympic
Games scheduled for 1928.
On looking over the list of names,
or slate, which was unanimously
agreed upon by the Nominating Com
mittee and which was later unani
mously adopted in its entirety on the
floor of the conventions, we find
among the officers elected quite a
sprinkling of names of men who serve
in an official capacity as members of
the National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation. Executive Committee, General
E. Pierce, President of the N.C.A.A.;
Doctor George Meylain, and Doctor
Joseph E. Raycroft, members of the
N.C.A.A.
It was the purpose, as before
stated, to have on each committee
affiliated with the coming Olympic
Games, men of standing in the Ath
letic world, to make each committee
really representative and reaching out
to include all the athletic bodies allied
with the Olympic Association. That
the Nominating Committee succeeded
j in its purpose is fully attested, too,
| by the fact that the entire slate, as
before stated, was later adopted
I unanimously by the delegates assem
bled.
Prout President
The President of the American
Olympic Association is William C.
! Prout, of Boston, himself an old Olym
pic Athlete, having competed for
1 America in the Olympic Games in
1908. I'rout's event was the 400 meters
I and, although defeated in this event
in the semi-final, his opponent, Lieu
tenant \V. Haswell of England, was
forced to break what was then the
world's record of 48:3-5, to win.
In 1921, Prout was elected President
of the Amateur Athletic Union and
i was re-elected in 1922 and 1923 by
| acclamation. The only other President
to serve three consecutive terms up
1 to that time was the late James E.
Sullivan.
I Ilis elevation to the presidency of
the American Olympic Association and
; American Olympic Committee is an
honor well deserved. His ability as a
' leader has been established and his
experience as an Olympic competitor
and as an Olympic official gives him
an advantage over all predecessors.
The action of the officers of the
National Collegiate Association in
withdrawing their support from the
j Olympic Committee solely because
they cannot assume control and
thereby make nn autocracy out of a
strictly democratic organization is
not what one would consider strictly
; in line with the true ethical spirit of
| amateur sport.
