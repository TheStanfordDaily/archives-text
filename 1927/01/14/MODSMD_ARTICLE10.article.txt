I have read with much interest the
article which appeared yesterday in
the Daily, written for the Harvard
Crimson by S. de J. Osborne, Har
vard, which relates to the break be
tween the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and the Olympic Associa

Rlr. Osborne's article mentions in
detail the reasons for the break and
when he states that the rift between
these athletic groups "can be likened
to the action of a little boy not play

Games scheduled for 1928.

agreed upon by the Nominating Com

floor of the conventions, we find
among the officers elected quite a
sprinkling of names of men who serve
in an official capacity as members of
the National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation. Executive Committee, General
E. Pierce, President of the N.C.A.A.;
Doctor George Meylain, and Doctor
Joseph E. Raycroft, members of the
N.C.A.A.
It was the purpose, as before
stated, to have on each committee
