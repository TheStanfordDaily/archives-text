# DEADLINE FOR JUNIOR OPERA MANUSCRIPTS SET FOR JANUARY 31
## 
### 
Manuscripts for the Junior Opera
must be turned in before January 31
in order to receive consideration, is
the statement from the plot commit
tee for the production.
It is desirable, according to the com
mittee, that the play be one adapting
itself to modern dress rather than one
of the costume type, which has been
overdone in recent years. Neverthe
less, either kind of plot will receive
consideration.
Writers who turn in ideas should
give a synopsis of their plots together
with sufficient dialogue to give the
committee in charge of the selection
proof that they are capable of han
dling this type of writing.
Manuscripts should be sent to
Frank Baker, Box 1357, Campus.
