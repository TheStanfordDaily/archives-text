# U.S. SHOULD NOT MIX IN NICARAGUA DISPUTE-JORDAN
## IS FIRST OPEN FORUM Opinion Asked on Ghosts, "Petting Parties" and Philippine Situation 
### 
"I do not think that the United
States has any right to send warships
or soldiers to Nicaragua in the pres
ent situation. It is none of our business
who is president of that country."
With these words Dr. Jordan answered
a question regarding what he thought
of the Nicaraguan crisis at his Thurs
day Evening Conference last night
which was an open forum for the pur
pose of answering any questions asked
by the audience.
Commenting further on that ques
tion, he said: "This talk about bolshe
vist activities in Nicaragua is such a
familiar lie that I do not think there
is any need of discussing it."
Too Many Ghost Stories
Another question asked was: "What
is your opinion regarding apparitions
and such supernatural phenomena?"
Dr. Jordan answered by saying: "I
have heard so many ghost stories that
I do not believe any of them."
When asked what he thought of the
petting parties of the younger genera
tion, Dr. Jordau replied: "I really
cannot say just how serious these so
called "petting parties" are because
the truth of the matter is that I have
never watched one. However, in gen
eral, I say that any girl who goes on
one is a fool, any boy who does is a
rascal."
It is the opinion of Dr. Jordan that
the Philippines are not yet ready for
self-government; however, he added
that "no country has the right to hold
a territory in subjection against the
will of that particular territory."
In discussing the possibility of men
tal telepathy, Dr. Jordan remarked:
"That is a question that has yet to
be settled by psychologists. Up to this
time I have never heard any evidence
to make me believe it is possible."
