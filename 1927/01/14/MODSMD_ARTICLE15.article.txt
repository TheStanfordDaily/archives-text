# FRESHMEN TALK OVER PLANS OF CLASS AT MEETING IN ENCINA
## 
### 
Freshman participation in intramu
ral sports was emphasized last night
at the first meeting of the Encina
Club for the winter quarter. Basket
ball, tennis, swimming, and handball
still remain on the athletic inter-club
program, and the class of 1930 plans
to take an active part in these sports.
Every man in the hall is eligible for
the teams, except those who are play
ing on the freshman basketball squad.
The men who have been cut from the
latter team play in intramural games.
Each wing on every floor will be
represented by a team, and later on
inter-Encina basketball will be played.
Trophies are to be awarded to the
winning team.
The freshman formal has been defi
nitely set for Saturday evening,
March 5, and will be given in the form j
of a dinner-dance. Henry Gerstenkorn,
chairman of the dance committee, an
nounced that bids must be reserved in
advance. Lists will be posted in the
ball for the men to sign. It is planned j
to make this dance the most preten-1
tious one ever attempted by a fresh- j
man class.
To decorate the lobby of Encina,
the class passed a motion ordering a
large red felt banner, with Stanford
printed upon it in block letters. This
pennant will be hung in the large
panel directly above the fireplace.
An estimate on the cost of repair
ing damaged furniture in the hall will
be made, and action will be taken at
the next club meeting.
Through the courtesy of the South
ern Pacific, and efforts of Kenneth
Milligan, bonfire chairman, the rail
road company has cancelled the debt
of some frtur hundred dollars owed by
the class for a fence destroyed when
material for the bonfire was being
! "bllected.

Hub. announced several smokers for
i lie near future, and promised a finan-
