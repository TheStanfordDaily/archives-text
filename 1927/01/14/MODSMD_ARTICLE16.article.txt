### Merle Emry

meets the Roosevelt High School quin
tet tonight at 7 o'clock before the
Varsity-Santa Clara game, a team
thoroughly drilled in basket-shooting
will engage in its third game of the
season in an attempt to win its first
victory under the direction of Coaches
Hunt and Mitchell.
Practice all yesterday afternoon was
spent on basket-throwing and passing
the ball on offensive plays. Both the
coaches seemed satisfied with the de
fensive work of the yearlings Wednes
day night against the Palo Alto High
School team and have concentrated
their efforts on building up a fast of
fensive aggregation.
That the freshmen were "off" their
game when the Palo Alto quintet
cleaned them cannot be denied. With
the team hitting its stride, the Oak
land machine should be kept busy
this evening.
The freshman squad has been cut
by Hunt and Mitchell from forty to
twenty men. Those who survived are:
Bush, Berg, Stewart, Simpkins, J. G.
Thompson, Garibatto, Hare, Rothert,
