# YOUTHFUL SPIRITS OF FACULTY MEN HAVE OUTLET IN CLUBHOUSE
## 
### 
Stanford University men professors
have, unknown to many undergradu
ates, a special clubhouse set aloof in |
the arboretum northeast of Encina!
Gym. Here faculty men may work off
their excess ire or glee on the tennis |
courts; or, if the ire and glee are noti
so excess, billiards, chess, or bridge
may fill the bill.
The Faculty Clubhouse has all the
attractions which obtain in well-!
ordered edifices of this character, j
There are provisions for a locker- \
room, showers, a game room, pool
room, and a kitchen and serving room. |
In the meeting room are held monthly
functions. The fireplace, the elk and
deer heads on the walls, and the gen- j
eral atmosphere, give the place the ,
air of a hunting lodge.'
Originated in the old and early days j
of Stanford, the clubhouse is one of
the pioneer institutions of the Univer-1
sity. Its membership at present is |
185. Any regular faculty man may be
long; and assistants are eligible by
election, as are Stanford graduates
living in the vicinity.
In the club's infancy, the principal â€¢
activities of the men was baseball. !
Faculty nines held weekly battles with i
student teams, occasionally taking on |
even the varsity. It is said that some
of the professors wielded a husky bat,
hitting a consistent .400 average,
which was considerably better than
any student slugger could boast. One
of these bambinoes of other days is
Professor Charles Moser of the Engi
neering department. Dr. Jordan, too,
was a star of the diamond.
