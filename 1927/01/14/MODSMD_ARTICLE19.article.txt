# VARSITY MEM FIVE FACES OLYMPICS, BRONCOS THIS WEEK
## McHose, McBurney Stars On Olympic Team, Have Record With Cards CAPTAIN DAVID TO START Bryant, McCandless Will Not Start in Mission Game Tonight 
### Fred Speers 
Coach Husky Hunt's varsity basket
ball team faces a stiff week-end sched
ule tonight and tomorrow night, meet
ing Santa Clara and the Olympic Club
fives on consecutive nights. The Cardi
nal mentor will use a new starting
lineup against the Broncos, saving the
Bryant-McCandless combination to
start against the Club team.
Starting Lineups
Announced lineups for tonight are
as follows:
Stanford Santa Clara
David C) F Reynolds
Price F Goff
Dobson C Connolly
Vincenti G Schuppert
Anderson G Barsi (C)
Stanford's set of forwards is that
used in the latter part of both halves
of the College of the Pacific game
Wednesday night. They were largely
responsible for the Cardinal rally to
ward the close of tho contest, bring
ing a total of fifteen points which were
enough to spell victory in capital let
ters for the Cards.
Vincenti's guard work in that game
was one of the classiest performances
on the floor. Anderson, the other start
ing guard, is a heady, hard-playing
man whose knowledge of defensive
work makes him one of the most
valuable men on the floor.
Dobson to Start
Dobson, starting in Jayred's pivot
position, lacks experience, but is a
dependable player. Jayred has been
troubled with a slight injury to his
foot but the matter did not hamper
him from playing a powerful game
against the Pacific aggregation.
Hunt's starting lineup tonight lacks
the scoring ability of the other set.
Whether this item will be dangerous
is a matter which will be determined
as the game progresses. Bryant, Mc-
Candless, and Jayred will undoubtedly
be sent into the game, but whether it
breaking the tie which had worried
everybody during the half.
Sequoia I made a pretty job of beat
ing the Branner "varsity," 22-15, for
Cowan, Frank, and Peterson were a
smooth combination of scorers. The
boys from Old Roble were behind un
til the final minutes, when Cook, Gif
fen, and Todd got their shooting eyes
and sank the ball with professional
regularity. Cook wag high-point man
of the game, having made nine points,
with four fieid goals and a foul shot.
Although the Phi Sigma Kappa-El
Capitan game started out with a rush,
the Phi Sigs soon outclassed their op
ponents and put the game on ice. With
the score standing 9 to 5 at half time,
the Phi Sig defense tightened up, and
Rode was the only man to break
through for a tally. Bryant was the
outstanding star on the victorious
tÂ§am, accounting for six points and
playing a good game.
Alpha Delts Lead
Poor passing and shooting proved
the downfall of the Encina boys at
the hands of the Alpha Delta Phi ag

gregation. From the start, the Alpha
Delt team was in the lead, with Moore
! carrying the brunt of the attack. At
! the end of the first period the fra
ternity men were leading by a score
of 12 to 2, while in the last half goals
J were made almost at will. Mooro was
the shining light on the winning team,
| sinking eight field goals for a total of
sixteen points. Duckett was a close
I'second with twelve points to his credit.
Robinson and Smith were the best
men for the Encina squad.
Today's games are as follows:
Sequoia II vs. El Toro, at 4:15.
Alpha Sigma Phi vs. Theta Chi, 4:50.
