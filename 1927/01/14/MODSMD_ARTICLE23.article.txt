Preliminary work in revising the A.S.S.U. constitution has gotten
under way through the locating of ambiguous articles and the determin
ing of better arrangements of the clauses contained in the set of rules.
Robert Littler, chairman of the revision committee, has pointed out in
an interview article in today's Daily some of the findings of the com
mittee.
The constitution as it is contains many meaningless clauses and
references to organizations which either have never functioned or which
died through disuse, rendering the articles pertaining to them valueless.
In one case provision is made for an Intersociety Council to be composed
of the presidents of all of the organizations on the campus. Yet no such
organization exists today nor is any provision to be found in the consti
tution for its discontinuance.
When a body of rules by which a student government functions is
cluttered up by obsolete clauses there is inevitably a lessening of regard
for that constitution, which in most cases is reflected in the attitude
toward the student government itself. By proper and careful revision
of the A.S.S.U. rules the student officers will be enabled to act with a
better knowledge of what their rights and powers are as conferred upon
them by the constitution. It is the purpose of the revision committee not
to alter the meaning of the articles but merely to clarify the document.
When this has been accomplished and if the revision is accepted;
much will have been done for the bettering of the standing of student
government on the campus through the knowledge of the students in
general that their government is functioning under a more clear consti
tution.
