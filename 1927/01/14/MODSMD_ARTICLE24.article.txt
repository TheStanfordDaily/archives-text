# Honor and Class Attendance
## 
### 
Never, it would seem, has the honor system been applied to class
attendance. Periodically it comes in for high praise or condemnation in
some university or other where the system is in use. It includes the
regulation of conduct on campuses and in class work and examinations,
but for some reason the attempt has never been made to apply the
students' honor to their presence at lectures.
In numerous classes great care is taken by the professor or his assist
ants to seat the class in this or that formation, alphabetically or otherwise,
somewhat in close resemblance to the habits of grammar school days.
Then in still more childish fashion the seating list is carefully scanned
for absences to be inscribed in the professorial day book.
It may be that such steps are necessary to secure the presence of even
a majority of those taking the course. Perhaps the main purpose is to
have students present at all costs. But that doesn't take away from the
absurdity in a university of taking roll, even when an extra absence
means an automatically low grade. ,
Of course, in universities pretending to be ultra high-hat the more
brainy and conscientious upperclassmen arc sometimes granted "unlimited
cuts." Whether it is that this group is the most unlikely to cause long
rows of vacant seats which induces the generous faculty provision ha.s
never been disclosed. At the same time, however, it is illogical not to
extend any existing honor system to include attendance at lectures.
And for that matter, it is but a step further to inquire into the need
of any regulation in regard to students' presence, provided that they do
satisfactory work in a course. It can easily be argued that in such case
the college is merely a glorified high school.
At all events two conclusions only can be drawn: either the honor
system will not work in the regulation of attendance, or the need of some
insurance of the presence of students is so great that official roll-taking
is the only practicable method. The lattcr's absurdity is easily discernible.
The first conclusion, to be at all valid, would require the premise that
the honor system is a failure in all other respects.
