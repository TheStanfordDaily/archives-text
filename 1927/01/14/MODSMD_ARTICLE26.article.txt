### Don Gledhill 
Two Yale men, in love witli the same !
girl, flipped a nickle to decide which
should be bridegroom and which
should be best man. Another marriage
decided by money.
* * *
Poison alcohol will take half the fun
out of drinking. A person might not
live to tell anyone about the party or !
how much he drank.
♦ * *
However, college mon can still fall
back on juniper berries and battery
acid.
♦ * *
A thug took a couple of shots the |
other night and had a policeman for
a chaser.
# * *
There will probably be a great num- ;
ber of men out to sea the day of the (
Catalina Swim. They are probably in
terested in finding out whether oiPand
water mix.
* * #
School children in Italy are forced
to wear black shirts. The Fascisti
must be making a war on laundries.
» * *
Embarrassing moments: When three
go out on the same party and each
tells the same person that he killed
half of the same fifth.
♦ * *
Advice to any woman that wants
the men to notice her —Walk down the
Law steps at a busy time.

A University of California freshman
urges that the university have some
} one meet the new students at the
trains, even if it is a Y.M.C.A. repre
| sentative. This might be a chance for
the college bootlegger or the college
widow.

The same freshman says that he I
was taking a taxi and saw that five
i could ride for the price of one so he !
asked some girls to ride but they re
fused. They probably didn't know
j whether he was collegiate or just
Scotch.

! sweater, claims an advertisement.'
How about that affected air of noncha
lance that doesn't appear to be af
fected? Or smoking a collegiate pipe?;
Or going without garters?

College youth's version of preceding
night—"Before we started two of us i
killed a couple of fifths and didn't feel
it at all, so we got two more. It was
starting to hit us then so we killed
another to help it along. By that time
we were feeling pretty rosy so we '
, dropped in on this big bust just when
they were opening a case. I killed at '
least two more by myself and didn't
get more tha nhalf tight at any time."
