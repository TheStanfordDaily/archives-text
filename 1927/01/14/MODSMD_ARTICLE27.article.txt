"Tar, A Midwest Childhood"
Sherwood Anderson

Books arc selling, but only certain j
books. The book that everybody feels
safe in buying is "Galahad," by John I
Erskine. It was on nearly every tree
this Christmas, and I suppose it will
be on nearly every tree next Christ
mas. It ought to be one of the kings
of best sellers —no amount of ingenu
ity can conceal its popularity. That
there is much slaughtering on nove
lists, poets, and goggle-eyed literati
generally, I suspect—and thus I leave
it to you.
* * *
Books often have a hard time living
up to their titles especially in these
days of the agonizing search for the j
label which will sell the most copies.
It is therefore surprising when one j
comes on a book that provides a thrill j
entirely beyond what the title prom- i
ises. Such a one is Sherwood Ander-!
son's "Tar, A Midwest Childhood," J
published by Boni and Liveright. Prob- j
ably if we judge this novel from a j
severe critical standpoint, it may not
be his greatest, but for other reasons
it is no doubt his foremost contribu
tion to the literature and life of
America so far, and it should stand,

when his fame is finally summed up, j
as his greatest book.
As a picture of the poor American
family of the small town in the ■
I eighties and nineties —when poor i
American families, goodness knows,
were legion—it deserves immortality.
Probably none of us have belonged to j
; one of those families, yes, and the
i food on our table has been much more
1 plentiful than was on poor Dick
| Moorehead's. Dick Moorehead was
I Tar's father. He was always the life 1
|of the occasion—but as the father of
; a family he never got beyond the ado
j lescent stage. The most extremely in-
I teresting character in the book is \
j Mary Moorehead, Tar's mother. Shad-1
: owy, yes, as the mates of such hus- ;
: bands and the mothers of seven chil
dren were in those days. Their fami- j
lies effaced them, and Death took them j
i as his natural heritage. Nothing could |
I be more fitting to end the book than j
: Mary Moorehead's death.
There can be no doubt that the art
|of Sherwood Anderson was near per- j
fection when he pictured this charac- j
ter as a silent woman, who spoke with j
her deep eyes and a slight grasp of
I the hand instead of her lips. Were not
1 words idle in the face of such things? ,
, This book has the extreme charm of i
truth. For those of us who would |
| linger again with Tar under the green !
| beech trees and along winding, muddy
j streams, for all that would know an
America that has passed by, for the
; fathers and mothers who would know
[ better a child's heart by the happiest
journey back to childhood—this book
is recommended.

"Tar, A Midwest Childhood"

Books arc selling, but only certain j
books. The book that everybody feels
safe in buying is "Galahad," by John I
Erskine. It was on nearly every tree
this Christmas, and I suppose it will
be on nearly every tree next Christ
mas. It ought to be one of the kings
of best sellers —no amount of ingenu
ity can conceal its popularity. That
there is much slaughtering on nove
lists, poets, and goggle-eyed literati
generally, I suspect—and thus I leave
it to you.

Books often have a hard time living
up to their titles especially in these
days of the agonizing search for the j
label which will sell the most copies.
It is therefore surprising when one j
comes on a book that provides a thrill j
entirely beyond what the title prom- i
ises. Such a one is Sherwood Ander-!
son's "Tar, A Midwest Childhood," J
published by Boni and Liveright. Prob- j
ably if we judge this novel from a j
severe critical standpoint, it may not
be his greatest, but for other reasons
it is no doubt his foremost contribu
tion to the literature and life of
America so far, and it should stand,

when his fame is finally summed up, j
as his greatest book.
As a picture of the poor American
family of the small town in the ■
I eighties and nineties —when poor i
American families, goodness knows,
were legion—it deserves immortality.
Probably none of us have belonged to j
; one of those families, yes, and the
i food on our table has been much more
1 plentiful than was on poor Dick
| Moorehead's. Dick Moorehead was
I Tar's father. He was always the life 1
|of the occasion—but as the father of
; a family he never got beyond the ado
j lescent stage. The most extremely in-
I teresting character in the book is \
j Mary Moorehead, Tar's mother. Shad-1
: owy, yes, as the mates of such hus- ;
: bands and the mothers of seven chil
dren were in those days. Their fami- j
lies effaced them, and Death took them j
i as his natural heritage. Nothing could |
I be more fitting to end the book than j
: Mary Moorehead's death.
There can be no doubt that the art
|of Sherwood Anderson was near per- j
fection when he pictured this charac- j
ter as a silent woman, who spoke with j
her deep eyes and a slight grasp of
I the hand instead of her lips. Were not
1 words idle in the face of such things? ,
, This book has the extreme charm of i
truth. For those of us who would |
| linger again with Tar under the green !
| beech trees and along winding, muddy
j streams, for all that would know an
America that has passed by, for the
; fathers and mothers who would know
[ better a child's heart by the happiest
