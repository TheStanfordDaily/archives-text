Editor, Stanford Daily, Sir:
Probably the reason Mr. Turkel
thinks Stanford women are not beauti
ful, is that the pretty ones won't step
out with him. —Alberta Yearian.

Editor, The Stanford Daily, Sir:
The profoundly sagacious editorial
of January 12, which "dropped Mr.
Babson's remedies indifferently into
the wastebasket," recalls a recent in
cident that occurred on the campus.
A kind old gentleman seeing a small
boy delivering a bundle of "Dippys"
under his arm, said: "Don't all those:
papers make you tired, my boy?"
"Naw, I don't read 'em," replied the
lad.
The lofty disdain you evidence to
ward Mr. Babson's pragmatic philo
sophy and his mundane interests in
economic production is admirable. In
deed it does credit to your "clear- j
and mature "philosophical
sense."
One may, however, question the
soundness of your argument. Puerile :
as this may seem, there are the best- j
trained —tho most disciplined minds.
And that the so-called clear, lucid
•hinking now prevailing in our free
from-efficiency four-year college course
is less difficult to percelvo in 10-point
typo on tho editorial page than in the
world of reality to which you refer.

I hopo Mr. Babson reads your edi-1
torial. He'll find that he can't play;
fast, and loose with college editorial
writers! —Theodore F. Baer.
