# Levy on NSF Checks Is Largest Item in Fines Collected by University
## 
### 
"Fines levied on bad checks made
out to the University form the largest
single item in the total of fines col
lected for various misdemeanors," said
Comptroller A. E. Roth in an inter
view yesterday,"and even these
amount to less than a thousand dollars
during the year."
The fines from NSF checks go
through the comptroller's office, such
as those demanded for late registra
tion, late change of study-list, and late
payment of syllabus fees, are added
directly to the President's budget for
the administration of the University.
Fines for unpaid checks to the dif
ferent organizations on the campus
are deposited in the savings account
of the Student Organizations Fund
