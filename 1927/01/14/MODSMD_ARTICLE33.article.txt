# HARPER'S COLLEGE LITERARY CONTEST TO CLOSE MARCH 5
## 
### 
The second Harper's Intercollegiate
Literary Contest will close March 5,
1927, according to a letter received
recently by I)r. Henry D. Gray, of the
English department, from Harper's
Magazine, sponsor of the contest.
Harper's Magazine offers a first prize
of $500, a second prize of $300, and a
third prize of $200 for the best pieces
of English prose written by under
graduates in American Colleges and
Universities. Last year eighty-four
colleges and universities participated
In the contest.
As stated by the conditions of the
contest, manuscripts, to be eligible,
must be the original work of, enrolled
students in any of the undergraduate
departments of American colleges and
universities. They must be written in
prose, but may be stories, essays, arti
cles, or any other form of prose work
suitable for magazine publication. The
rules are posted on the bulletin boards
of the English department.
The manuscripts are to be mailed
to the Intercollegiate Literary Con
test, Harper's Magazine, 49 East 33rd
Street, New York City, not later than
midnight, March 5, 1927. The final
choice of the prize-winners will be
made by a Hoard consisting of three
writers: Henry Seidal Canby, Elinor
Wvlie, and William McFee.
Last year the English department,
co-operated in the selection of manu
scripts as well as in stimulating under
graduate interest in the contest. This
year, however, the English department
will not be asked to take part in the
selection of manuscripts because of
the immense amount of time imposed
upon them by such work. Instead, the
competitors are requested to mail their
offerings direct to Harper's Magazine.
