The Broncos, under their new coach,
Harlan Dykes, have been playing a
good brand of basketball. They have
played two games, dropping the first
to the Petaluma Spartans 28-27, and
winning the second from the San Jose
Sport Shop 25-11. The new coach has
dropped the five-man defense and is
concentrating his men on offensive
playing.

There are several men of ability in
long-distance basket-shooting on the
visitors' team and handling them will
be one of the problems Hunt's men
will have to solve. Earle Reynolds,
forward, has been making the best
showing on the Bronc varsity, but
Captain Barsi and Connolly have not
been far behind.
The Olympic Club, playing in the
pavilion tomorrow night, presents, as
do all club teams, a problem. If the
Winged "O" outfit is right, it will be a
hard one to stop. The Olympics have
won games from Occidental and
Nevada and dropped games to the
fast Oregon Aggies and to the St
Ignatius five, which was defeated by
California's varsity recently by an
eleven-point margin.

On the Olympic Club team will be
seen two former Stanford players. Nip
McHose, forward, and Rae Mcßurney,
running guard, both played together
on the Cardinal colors several years
ago and have been doing well on the
I Club team. Another Olympic player
of ability is Minor, a flashy little for
ward, especially good on offensive
work.
Against the Olympic Club Coach
Hunt will probably start the same
lineup he used against the College of
j the Pacific. This was Bryant and Mc
j Candless, forwards, Jayred at center,
Biaggini and Anderson, guards. If
! this team can show the speed it dis
; played in the second half of Wednes
day's game, it will not have great
difficulty in downing the Club men.
