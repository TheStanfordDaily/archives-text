# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
In the football game between Min
nesota and Wisconsin, held on the old
Northrup field in Minneapolis in 1899,
a tall, lithe, young Australian, wear
ing the cardinal of Wisconsin, gave
one of the most remarkable kicking
exhibitions in all gridiron history.
Catching a Minnesota punt on his own
forty-yard line, the lad in question
started running back with the ball
toward his opponent's goal. He had
covered about ten yards when Gil
Dobie, then one of Doc Williams' fam
ous "Giants of the North," had him
stopped near the side-line. Just when
it seemed certain that the Wisconsin
runner would be tackled or forced out
of bounds, he did a most surprising
thing. With a hasty glance at the goal
posts fifty yards away, he took a quick
shot around the tackier and drop
kicked a perfect field-goal from a most
difficult angle, while running at top
speed!
The kicker was Pat O'Dea, whose
name has long been a by-word in the
Middlewest whenever great kickers
are discussed. In a game with North
western the year before, Pat had made
a remarkable drop-kick of sixty-two
yards, and he had also made an exhibi
tion drop-kick of sixty-three yards,
eleven inches, the same year. His
punting was as remarkable as his field

goal kicking, and it is said that he
once kicked a football one hundred
yards. At any rate, O'Dea was, without
any doubt, one of the longest punters
| and drop-kickers in gridiron history.
In a game with the Carlisle Indians,
played in the old Coliseum in Chicago
i in 1596, one of Pat's long, high spirals
landed up among the roof girders and
stuck there!
Pat O'Dea was born near Melbourne,
j Australia, in 1871. He began kicking
a football around when only eight
years old, and later played Rugby
with the champion Essendon Club of
the Victorian Football Association,
i After his graduation from Wisconsin,
j he did a bit of coaching in the Middle
west and finally moved to San Fran
cisco. Nothing was ever heard of Pat
O'Dea after 1914, and it is thought
| that he went overseas with some
, Anzac outfit and was killed or died
I
1 in the war.


His Toe Was Famous
