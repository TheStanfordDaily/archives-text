# AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN EAST IMPORTANT DR. WILBUR DECLARES
## President Predicts Peaceful Relations With Orient Before Civic League 
### 
"The fate of the world is in the !
balance in the East," declared Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur in his address
given Wednesday before the San Fran
cisco Center of California Civic
League. "On one side is Russia, pow
erful, with nothing to lose, with a
small group governing the whole
group and pulling down those who
succeed to the level of the weakest.
On the other side stands America
with the majority rule instead of class
! rule and with every opportunity for
those who seek to climb above their
j fellows. In between, ready to choose,
j stands China trying to make itself
| into a republic, and also imperialistic
j Japan."
"If China and Japan choose to fol-
J low the way of Russia," said Dr. Wil
bur, "there will be constant chaos in
I the Pacific, and if they choose to fol
! low America there will be peace and
a decent world. Yet we are doing lit
i tie to influence their choice."
Contrasting the youth of Japan with
that of America, Dr. Wilbur stated
that the young people of Japan are
| curious, eager to learn, and receiving
excellent physical training. Only the
practical edification of the royal fain- |
ily keeps them from a natural radical I
viewpoint.
Chinese young folks, according to
Dr. Wilbur, have the same capacity as
i the Japanese with less opportunity.
They find it difficult to handle the
1 problems of modern civilization, be
cause their educational system has all
been based on the classics, with a
viewpoint toward the past instead of
the future.
In concluding, Dr. Wilbur stated:
"Opportunity we have in America, and j
plenty of it. Our problem is whether !
we can stand prosperity, whether we i
can tench our children to work coura
geously where there is no grim neces
sity for doing it. We have got to have
more big-handed peopl" who react nor
mally to life, or somebody else is
going to run this country."
