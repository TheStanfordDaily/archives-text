# PRESENT STUDENT CONSTITUTION WILL UNDERGO REVISION
## CONCISENESS IS OBJECT Robert M. Littler, Chairman, Plans Complete Change Of Faulty Sections 
### 
Working with a view to straighten
ing out the constitution of the Asso
ciated Students, the revision commit
tee, under the chairmanship of Robert
Littler, has begun its efforts to give
Stanford a completely revised docu
ment.
A number of problems have come
before the committee which give an
idea of the present weaknesses of the
constitution as it now stands. Chief
among these difficulties to be sur
mounted is the fact that the present
set of rules is entirely too long and
the wording of the rules too tangled
and complicated to insure a clear un
derstanding of the meanings. In fact,
according to Stanley Weigle, "There
is scarcely any semblance of organiza
tion, and a great deal of readjustment
is necessary to straighten out the con
stitution."
Robert Littler, chairman of the re
vision committee, says he defies any
one to tell him what Sec. 13, para
graph 2 in Article 7 is meant to con
vey. Also, throughout the rules the
general, student, and graduate mana
gers are mixed up, one name being
used where the other should be, and
vice versa. At times it fails to clearly
define the duties of different student
committees.
This set of rules has been in use
since 1923 and since its adoption
many of its regulations have become
inoperative and clutter up the pages,
making the reading more complicated.
Just one example of this is the para
graph sanctioning the formation of the
Intersociety Council, which, it says,
shall be composed of the presidents I
of all organizations on the campus; I
there exists no such group as far as I
anyone knows.
The committee finds that one rea
son that gives rise to the unnecessary
length of the rules is the fact that j
many of the things in the actual con
stitution as it now stands, should be
long in the by-laws. The committee
invites any suggestions on any phase i
of the constitution. Such contributions I
should be addressed to either Robert
Littler or the secretary of the com
mittee, Helen Bell.
