# PLAN FOR NEW EIGHT SCIENCES
## Proposed Innovation Groups Physical Studies Under General System A.B. DEGREE IS OFFERED Combination to Be Effected In Autumn Quarter of Coming Year 
### 
A School of Physical Sciences, offer
ing the A.B. degree in physical sci
ences and comprising the faculties of
the departments of chemistry, geo
logy, mathematics, and physics, to
gether with some professors in the
departments of biology, engineering,
medicine, and philosophy, will be or
ganized next autumn quarter. The
members of the executive committee
of the school are Professors David L.
Webster, chairman, Carl L. Alsberg,
Eliot Blackwelder, Hans F. Blichfeldt,
and Edward C. Franklin.
To Correlate Work
"The purpose of the school," Profes
sor Webster announced Saturday, "is
to perform such duties as involve co
operation among these departments
and to further the correlation of their
work. The most important co-operative
enterprise now being planned is a
series of courses in General Physical
Sciences, primarily for students ma
joring in other departments who are
unable to take the time for specialized
courses in all the physical sciences,
but who wish to acquire a general
acquaintance with this field. These
courses will be of sophomore or
junior grade, and will run through the
autumn, winter, and spring, with
three lecture units each quarter and
no laboratory."
Broad Training
"The degree," said Professor Web
ster, "is instituted for the benefit of
students who desire a broad training
for advanced work in any of these
sciences, and who are of such superior
ability that the consequent reduction
of their curriculum in the subject in
which Ihey will finally specialize will
not place them at a disadvantage."
