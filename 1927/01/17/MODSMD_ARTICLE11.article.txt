# GLEE CLUBS IN JOINT COM NEXT SATURDAY
## First Offering of Combined Choruses from Two Universities NEW LEADER FOR BEARS California Men Will Give Several Songs New to Stanford Campus 
### 
Tickets for the joint concert to be
given in the pavilion Saturday evening
by the California and Stanford Glee
clubs will go on sale this afternoon
at 1 o'clock in the lobby of the old
Union.
This is the first concert of the kind
ever staged by the Glee Clubs of the
two universities. The concert has been
made possible by the reorganization
of the California Glee Club under tho
direction of Leonard McWliood, pro
fessor of music at the University of
California, having come out from
Dartmouth.
New Numbers
The California singers will present
some numbers not yet heard on this
campus, including "Goin' Home,"
adapted from Dvorak's Largo from
the New World Symphony and"The
Hand-organ Man," by Orthegraven.
"Goin' Home may be traced back
to an American song, according to one
view in the controversy that has
arisen since Dvorak first published
his New World Symphony as to
whether the theme of the Largo was
taken from "Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot." The composer himself de
nied that he iook any particular
! American melody in writing the sym
phony, but the two pieces bear a
close resemblance to each other.
College Song
Another number on the program is j

Edward McDowell's arrangement of
j the old Kentucky folk song, "Frog
I Went a Courtin'," which was one of
several college songs written by Mc
i Dowell for Columbia while he was a
professor there.
The entire program will include
1 separate numbers by the two clubs,
! combined choruses using both clubs,
and solos by Bolton White and Marie
Ide Forest Emery.
