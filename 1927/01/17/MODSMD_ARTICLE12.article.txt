Commenting on the steady yearly
decrease in scholarship disqualifica
tions among freshmen and its probable
causes, Dr. Karl M. Cowdery, assistant
registrar, yesterday declared, "My
opinion is that selection is the largest
element in the decrease, since there
has been a great change in recent
years in that respect."
To explain why so few freshmen
fail, Dr. Cowdery produced the selec
tion statistics, which show that the
130 new women were selected this
year from a group of 711 applicants
and a similar number in 1925 from
515 applicants.
Regarding the importance of other
possible causes of the bettered schol
arship, he said, "Our use of the in
telligence test, sponsor system, compe
tition, and other present methods all
came at about the same time. Although
I don't doubt that all of them have
entered in, I wouldn't venture an
opinion as to their exact relative
values."
What slight changes there ;liave
been in scholastic requirements, he
added, have probably not affected the
records.
