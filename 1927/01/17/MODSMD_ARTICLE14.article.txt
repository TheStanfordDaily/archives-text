# Canadian Wins In Catalina Channel Endurance Swim
## 
### 
George Young, 17-year-old ama
teur long-distance champion swim
mer, who entered from Toronto,
Canada, yesterday morning won
the distinction of being the first
person to swim the 23-mile stretch
of ocean between Santa Catalina
Island and the California main
land. He can claim $25,000 for his
efforts.
The time for the swim has unoffi
cially been given as fifteen hours and
twenty minutes, Young leaving the
water near Point Vincente early Sun
day morning. Latest reports say that
Young was the only swimmer to finish.
Ninety-Six Start
Of the original 154 men and women
that applied for chances at the two
prizes—$25,000 for the first person to
cross the waterway, and $15,000 addi
tional for the first woman to finish —
only 102 were at their stations at
: 11:20 on Saturday morning. From
I these, 96 entrants —13 of them women
| —struck out into the icy waters of the
| channel. At the start, the temperature
lof the water was 58 degrees, cold
1 enough to require the thick coats of
grease which covered most of the
swimmers.
Ross in Second Place
Twelve hours later, Young was in
the lead, a mile and a half from the
Point Vincente shore; Norman Ross,
former Stanford star, two miles be
hind, held on to second place, hoping
that Young would not finish; Pete
Mayer of Cincinnati was struggling
against the tide, but kept third in line.
Earlier in the race, Young and Ross
turned toward the north, figuring that
the tide would help carry them to their
i goal. Their strategy was correct, for
they were brought in the right direc
i tion for finishing, while those who
tried to buck the current were carried
| far south.
Mrs. Clarabelle Barrett, outstanding
woman swimmer, made a valiant
i struggle against the tide that was
i aiding Young and Ross, but had to be
taken from the water. Likewise, Mrs.
M. C. Houser and Miss Martha Stae
j ger, both of whom had stayed in the
] water for nineteen hours, and who
i were the last women left in the race,
' were unable to finish. The latter two
will each be given a special prize of
j $2500.
Two conquerers of the English
Channel, Henry Sullivan and Charles
Toth, had to give in to the current
iof the Catalina channel. V. W. Sum
mers of Alameda kept the lead for
some time, but after trying to swim
| against the tide, left the water. Many
' others quit earlier in the race, saying
i that the attempt was impossible.
The hardest fight of all was that
put up by Ross. He had kept right
behind Young for fifteen hours,
j and after making a last attempt to
I overtake the leader, was pulled into
| his dory, guided by Coach Ernst
Brandsten, about two and one-half
miles from the shore.

Mrs. Clarabelle Barrett, outstanding
woman swimmer, made a valiant

Two conquerers of the English
Channel, Henry Sullivan and Charles

The hardest fight of all was that

George Young, 17-year-old ama
teur long-distance champion swim
mer, who entered from Toronto,
Canada, yesterday morning won
the distinction of being the first
person to swim the 23-mile stretch
of ocean between Santa Catalina
Island and the California main
land. He can claim $25,000 for his
efforts.
The time for the swim has unoffi
cially been given as fifteen hours and
twenty minutes, Young leaving the
water near Point Vincente early Sun
day morning. Latest reports say that
Young was the only swimmer to finish.
Ninety-Six Start
Of the original 154 men and women
that applied for chances at the two
prizes—$25,000 for the first person to
cross the waterway, and $15,000 addi
tional for the first woman to finish —
only 102 were at their stations at
: 11:20 on Saturday morning. From
I these, 96 entrants —13 of them women
| —struck out into the icy waters of the
| channel. At the start, the temperature
lof the water was 58 degrees, cold
1 enough to require the thick coats of
grease which covered most of the
swimmers.
Ross in Second Place
Twelve hours later, Young was in
the lead, a mile and a half from the
Point Vincente shore; Norman Ross,
former Stanford star, two miles be
hind, held on to second place, hoping
that Young would not finish; Pete
Mayer of Cincinnati was struggling
against the tide, but kept third in line.
Earlier in the race, Young and Ross
turned toward the north, figuring that
the tide would help carry them to their
i goal. Their strategy was correct, for
they were brought in the right direc
i tion for finishing, while those who
tried to buck the current were carried
| far south.
