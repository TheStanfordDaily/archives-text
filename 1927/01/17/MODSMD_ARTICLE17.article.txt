# 1927 LICENSE PLATE APPLICATION BLANKS DUE ON JANUARY 31
## 
### 
Only two weeks remain for car-owners
to make application for 1927 license
plates is the announcement made by the
Palo Alto police department.
January 31 is the last day on which
applications may be filed. Registration
after that date can be made only with
the payment of a $3 fine.
Students from outside the state who
have not received California drivers' li
censes should make application for them
at once, say the police, as out-state li
censes arc not valid from year to year.
No fee is charged for licensing operators.
Application blanks for operator's li
cense may be obtained at the City Hall in
Palo Alto, but it is recommended that
students from outside the state drive
I their cars to the licensing bureau in San
Francisco to get their California plates,
;as all license plates of other tates are
collected and destroyed.
