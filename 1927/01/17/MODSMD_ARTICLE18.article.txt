community," said President Bell-

plished in so short a time provided
you have intelligent, keen, and coura
geous players with whom to work."

passed through Vancouver on his way

"It was with this in view that I
; discussed with Mr. Maloney before
leaving last week the desirability of
arranging well in advance a similar
j series of games in California against
! Stanford and the Olympic Club in the
early part of 1928. This would give

President Wilbur has received a
letter from Richard Bell-Irving, presi

Union, complimenting Stanford on its
representation in the series of games
played in the North during the holi
days, and suggesting that a similar
series be played next year, and that
likewise a Canadian team come south

trips as a means of aiding Harry Ma
loney to select a Rugby team to repre
sent America in the 1928 Olympic
Games, in which Rugby has been defi
nitely placed among the sports in
which the United States will partici
pate.
Compliments Stanford
"It has never been our good fortune
to meet a finer lot of sportsmen than
those representing you this Christ
mas. They all behaved as gentlemen
should throughout the entire visit,
played a keen, hard, and sportsman
like game, and are a credit to any
community," said President Bell-
Irving in his letter. He praised the
Stanford team for its sportsmanlike
action in taking out one of its men to
equalize matters when, in the game
with Victoria, one of .the Canadian
men had to be removed on account of
injuries."
