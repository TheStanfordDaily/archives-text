# DUMBARTON BRIDGE OPENED TO TRAFFIC: FIRST TO SPAN BAY
## 
### 
Dumbarton Bridge, across the south
ern end of San Francisco Bay, which
was opened Saturday after eleven
years' planning, and two years' active
construction work, is the first to span
the bay. The total cost of construction
was $2,000,000.
The bridge proper is a mile and a
half in length, with some five miles
of highway being constructed as ap
proaches on either side. The distance
between Palo Alto and Oakland has
been cut seventeen miles, the western
approach being a few miles south of
the campus.
Built by private interests under a
franchise granted by San Mateo coun
ty, the new bridge is being operated
on a toll basis of five cents per per
son, and thirty cents for five-passenger
touring cars or one-ton trucks. Con-
I structed with nine spans, the bridge
provides for bay navigation by a verti
cal lift in one of them. This affords a
clear width in the channel of 200 feet
between the fenders protecting the
adjacent piers. ,
Up until 5 o'clock yesterday 2500
automobiles crossed the bridge from
the Eastbay to the peninsula, and 3000
vehicles in the opposite direction.
