# FOOTBALL SOLE SPORT TO PROFIT AT U.C.
## 
### 
Football was the only sport to show a
profit at the University of California
during 1926, according to a preliminary
estimate made by W. W. Monahan, gen
eral manager of the Associated Students.
Although football earned $286,070.61,
every other sport on the list showed a
deficit, and the actual incomc of the ath
letic department will probably be re
duced to not more than $205,000. Ath
letics have long carried the burden of the
financially unprofitable activities whose
annual loss of alwiut $65,000 takes an
other cut from the Associated Students'
income. Payments due on the union build
inpf and the Memorial Staudium reduce
the athletic department profit showing
still further.
