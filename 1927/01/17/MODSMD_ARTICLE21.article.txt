# CARDINALS DEFEAT BRONCOS, LOSE TO OLYMPIC CLUB FIVE
## Reserve Power Sufficient to Win Game From Santa Clara TWO LINEUPS ARE USED Varsity Drops Close Contest To Winged "O" Players By Single Point 
### Fred Speers 
Reserve power was enough to turn
in a clean-cut win over Santa Clara
Friday night for the Cardinals, but
the first string was not enough to
down the Olympic Club quintet the
following evening when Hunt's men
barely lost the club game, 30 to 29.
The Broncos were tucked away in
easy fashion with a score of 33 to 17.
Two different lineups (with the ex
ception of Ned Anderson and Vincenti,
guards), were used by the Cardinal
mentor in the two games, both played
in the pavilion, and in both cases, re
gardless of the outcome, the results
were gratifying. Captain Nelson David
and former Captain Fred Price as
forwards, and Dobson, center, proved
to be an effective lineup, running up a
5 to 0 lead over Santa Clara before
the game had gotten well under way.
Card Shooting Better
Stanford's shooting on both occa
sions seemed greatly improved. The
Bronco five simply lacked scoring
ability, while the Olympic Club had
that ability in no small degree. There
in lies the story of the week-end for
the Cardinal basketball men.
Dobson was the outstanding Card
man Friday night, running up ten
points for high-point honors, lie
proved to be the major cog in the
Stanford offensive team play which
was working with the proverbial
clock-like smoothness to put Santa
Clara hopelessly behind in the second
half. The game ended with the Mis
sion men making futile long shots
from the center of the floor.
Club Game Thriller
JBut it was the Olympic Club game
which gave the spectators thrill after
thrill. This was no game comparable
to that of last year when the Club men
ran up twenty points ere tbe Cardinals
could score. On the contrary, there
•was but one occasion when a four
point difference rested between the
scores, the remaining time being a
give-and-take battle with the lead be
ing alternated as one or the other
team would sink a field goal.
An open passing game which gradu
ally developed into a rough battle in
the second half constituted Saturday
night's engagement. At half time the
score was tied at 16-all, and it took
McHose at his best to register an
Olympic victory. The former Cardinal
flash sank four field goals in that
memorable second half as well as be
ing a constant menace to a Stanford
rally.
A disputed basket in the first half
■which was awarded to the Olympic
Club was enough to give the visitors
their victory.
Bryant turned in an excellent game,
taking high-point honors with a total
of thirteen points, many of them pos
sible only through McCandless and
Jayred feeding him the ball at crucial
limes. Mcßurney, another ex-Stanford
player, and Corey were playing strong
defensive games, checking Stanford
again and again.
Ejjirly in the second half two free
throws, one by Anderson and another
i>y Bryant, put Stanford ahead. Mc-
Candless followed a moment later with
another to make the score read Stan-
Cord 19, Olympics 16.
Here Minor sank a long field goal,
and it looked as though the Olympics
were off on a scoring spree, but Bry
ant gave Stanford two more points
with a lucky throw from midfield.
Then McHose, always hovering near
the Cardinal basket, sank one from
the side.
With the Olympic Club four points
behind and the end of the game in
sight, McHose opened his work sink
ing two field goals in rapid succession,
one of them a one-handed toss, to put
the Winged "O" in tbe running. Husky
Hunt jerked Fred Price and Vincenti,
sending in McCandless and Lewis to
bolster the Cards.
Bryant Tallies
Out of two tries Bryant sank one
free throw and that was to be the end
of the Cardinals' scoring for the eve
ning, but not for McHose, who tucked
away still another field goal, this time

three minutes left to play the game
turned into a hard and rough tussle.
Bryant tried shot after shot but sim
from right under the basket. With .

Reserve power was enough to turn
in a clean-cut win over Santa Clara
Friday night for the Cardinals, but
the first string was not enough to
down the Olympic Club quintet the
following evening when Hunt's men
barely lost the club game, 30 to 29.
The Broncos were tucked away in
easy fashion with a score of 33 to 17.
Two different lineups (with the ex
ception of Ned Anderson and Vincenti,
guards), were used by the Cardinal
mentor in the two games, both played
in the pavilion, and in both cases, re
gardless of the outcome, the results
were gratifying. Captain Nelson David
and former Captain Fred Price as
forwards, and Dobson, center, proved
to be an effective lineup, running up a
5 to 0 lead over Santa Clara before
the game had gotten well under way.
Card Shooting Better
Stanford's shooting on both occa
sions seemed greatly improved. The
Bronco five simply lacked scoring
ability, while the Olympic Club had
that ability in no small degree. There
in lies the story of the week-end for
the Cardinal basketball men.
Dobson was the outstanding Card
man Friday night, running up ten
points for high-point honors, lie
proved to be the major cog in the
Stanford offensive team play which
was working with the proverbial
clock-like smoothness to put Santa
Clara hopelessly behind in the second
half. The game ended with the Mis
sion men making futile long shots
from the center of the floor.
Club Game Thriller
JBut it was the Olympic Club game
which gave the spectators thrill after
thrill. This was no game comparable
to that of last year when the Club men
ran up twenty points ere tbe Cardinals
could score. On the contrary, there
•was but one occasion when a four
point difference rested between the
scores, the remaining time being a
give-and-take battle with the lead be
ing alternated as one or the other
team would sink a field goal.
An open passing game which gradu
ally developed into a rough battle in
the second half constituted Saturday
night's engagement. At half time the
score was tied at 16-all, and it took
McHose at his best to register an
Olympic victory. The former Cardinal
flash sank four field goals in that
memorable second half as well as be
ing a constant menace to a Stanford
rally.
A disputed basket in the first half
■which was awarded to the Olympic
Club was enough to give the visitors
their victory.
Bryant turned in an excellent game,
taking high-point honors with a total
of thirteen points, many of them pos
sible only through McCandless and
Jayred feeding him the ball at crucial
limes. Mcßurney, another ex-Stanford
player, and Corey were playing strong
defensive games, checking Stanford
again and again.
Ejjirly in the second half two free
throws, one by Anderson and another
i>y Bryant, put Stanford ahead. Mc-
Candless followed a moment later with
another to make the score read Stan-
Cord 19, Olympics 16.
Here Minor sank a long field goal,
and it looked as though the Olympics
were off on a scoring spree, but Bry
ant gave Stanford two more points
with a lucky throw from midfield.
Then McHose, always hovering near
the Cardinal basket, sank one from
the side.
With the Olympic Club four points
behind and the end of the game in
sight, McHose opened his work sink
ing two field goals in rapid succession,
one of them a one-handed toss, to put
the Winged "O" in tbe running. Husky
Hunt jerked Fred Price and Vincenti,
sending in McCandless and Lewis to
bolster the Cards.
Bryant Tallies
Out of two tries Bryant sank one
free throw and that was to be the end
of the Cardinals' scoring for the eve
ning, but not for McHose, who tucked
away still another field goal, this time

three minutes left to play the game
turned into a hard and rough tussle.

clock-like smoothness to put Santa
Clara hopelessly behind in the second
half. The game ended with the Mis
sion men making futile long shots
from the center of the floor.
Club Game Thriller
JBut it was the Olympic Club game
which gave the spectators thrill after
thrill. This was no game comparable
to that of last year when the Club men
ran up twenty points ere tbe Cardinals
could score. On the contrary, there
•was but one occasion when a four
point difference rested between the
scores, the remaining time being a
give-and-take battle with the lead be
ing alternated as one or the other
team would sink a field goal.
An open passing game which gradu
ally developed into a rough battle in
the second half constituted Saturday
night's engagement. At half time the
score was tied at 16-all, and it took
McHose at his best to register an
Olympic victory. The former Cardinal
flash sank four field goals in that
memorable second half as well as be
ing a constant menace to a Stanford
rally.
A disputed basket in the first half
■which was awarded to the Olympic
Club was enough to give the visitors
their victory.
Bryant turned in an excellent game,
taking high-point honors with a total
of thirteen points, many of them pos
sible only through McCandless and
Jayred feeding him the ball at crucial
limes. Mcßurney, another ex-Stanford
player, and Corey were playing strong
defensive games, checking Stanford
again and again.
Ejjirly in the second half two free
throws, one by Anderson and another
i>y Bryant, put Stanford ahead. Mc-
Candless followed a moment later with
another to make the score read Stan-
Cord 19, Olympics 16.
Here Minor sank a long field goal,
and it looked as though the Olympics
were off on a scoring spree, but Bry
ant gave Stanford two more points
with a lucky throw from midfield.
Then McHose, always hovering near
the Cardinal basket, sank one from
the side.
With the Olympic Club four points
behind and the end of the game in
sight, McHose opened his work sink
ing two field goals in rapid succession,
one of them a one-handed toss, to put
the Winged "O" in tbe running. Husky
Hunt jerked Fred Price and Vincenti,
sending in McCandless and Lewis to
bolster the Cards.
Bryant Tallies
Out of two tries Bryant sank one
free throw and that was to be the end
of the Cardinals' scoring for the eve
ning, but not for McHose, who tucked
away still another field goal, this time

three minutes left to play the game
turned into a hard and rough tussle.
Bryant tried shot after shot but sim
from right under the basket. With .

Reserve power was enough to turn
in a clean-cut win over Santa Clara
Friday night for the Cardinals, but
the first string was not enough to
down the Olympic Club quintet the
following evening when Hunt's men
barely lost the club game, 30 to 29.
The Broncos were tucked away in
easy fashion with a score of 33 to 17.
Two different lineups (with the ex
ception of Ned Anderson and Vincenti,
guards), were used by the Cardinal
mentor in the two games, both played
in the pavilion, and in both cases, re
gardless of the outcome, the results
were gratifying. Captain Nelson David
and former Captain Fred Price as
forwards, and Dobson, center, proved
to be an effective lineup, running up a
5 to 0 lead over Santa Clara before
the game had gotten well under way.
Card Shooting Better
Stanford's shooting on both occa
sions seemed greatly improved. The
Bronco five simply lacked scoring
ability, while the Olympic Club had
that ability in no small degree. There
in lies the story of the week-end for
the Cardinal basketball men.

Reserve power was enough to turn
in a clean-cut win over Santa Clara
Friday night for the Cardinals, but
the first string was not enough to
down the Olympic Club quintet the
following evening when Hunt's men
barely lost the club game, 30 to 29.
The Broncos were tucked away in
easy fashion with a score of 33 to 17.
Two different lineups (with the ex
ception of Ned Anderson and Vincenti,
guards), were used by the Cardinal
mentor in the two games, both played
in the pavilion, and in both cases, re
gardless of the outcome, the results
were gratifying. Captain Nelson David
and former Captain Fred Price as
forwards, and Dobson, center, proved
to be an effective lineup, running up a
5 to 0 lead over Santa Clara before
the game had gotten well under way.
Card Shooting Better
Stanford's shooting on both occa
sions seemed greatly improved. The
Bronco five simply lacked scoring
ability, while the Olympic Club had
that ability in no small degree. There
in lies the story of the week-end for
the Cardinal basketball men.
Dobson was the outstanding Card
man Friday night, running up ten
points for high-point honors, lie
proved to be the major cog in the
Stanford offensive team play which
was working with the proverbial
clock-like smoothness to put Santa
Clara hopelessly behind in the second
half. The game ended with the Mis
sion men making futile long shots
from the center of the floor.
Club Game Thriller
JBut it was the Olympic Club game
which gave the spectators thrill after
thrill. This was no game comparable
to that of last year when the Club men
ran up twenty points ere tbe Cardinals
could score. On the contrary, there
•was but one occasion when a four
point difference rested between the
scores, the remaining time being a
give-and-take battle with the lead be
ing alternated as one or the other
team would sink a field goal.
An open passing game which gradu
ally developed into a rough battle in
the second half constituted Saturday
night's engagement. At half time the
score was tied at 16-all, and it took
McHose at his best to register an
Olympic victory. The former Cardinal
flash sank four field goals in that
memorable second half as well as be
ing a constant menace to a Stanford
rally.
A disputed basket in the first half
■which was awarded to the Olympic
Club was enough to give the visitors
their victory.
Bryant turned in an excellent game,
taking high-point honors with a total
of thirteen points, many of them pos
sible only through McCandless and
Jayred feeding him the ball at crucial
limes. Mcßurney, another ex-Stanford
player, and Corey were playing strong
defensive games, checking Stanford
again and again.
Ejjirly in the second half two free
throws, one by Anderson and another
i>y Bryant, put Stanford ahead. Mc-
Candless followed a moment later with
another to make the score read Stan-
Cord 19, Olympics 16.
Here Minor sank a long field goal,
and it looked as though the Olympics
were off on a scoring spree, but Bry
ant gave Stanford two more points
with a lucky throw from midfield.
Then McHose, always hovering near
the Cardinal basket, sank one from
the side.
With the Olympic Club four points
behind and the end of the game in
sight, McHose opened his work sink
ing two field goals in rapid succession,
one of them a one-handed toss, to put
the Winged "O" in tbe running. Husky
Hunt jerked Fred Price and Vincenti,
sending in McCandless and Lewis to
bolster the Cards.
Bryant Tallies
Out of two tries Bryant sank one
free throw and that was to be the end
of the Cardinals' scoring for the eve
ning, but not for McHose, who tucked
away still another field goal, this time

three minutes left to play the game
turned into a hard and rough tussle.
Bryant tried shot after shot but sim
from right under the basket. With .
ply could not make the ball go through >
the basket.
