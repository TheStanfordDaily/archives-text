## 
### 
Watcrcolor sketches made in England
jand on the continent by Dr. Douglas H.
: Campbell, professor emeritus of Botany
at Stanford, during a recent European
; trip, were placed on display in the gal
lery of the Palo Alto library Friday.
These sketches, which constitute a
fairly complete record of his travels, num
ber about seventy, and include for the
most part landscapes and scenes from
j large cities. Many of these latter were
made in London, where Dr. Campbell
i made his headquarters during his stay in
j England. After sketching in Devonshire
; and Cornwall, he worked in various scc
i tions of France. Dr. Campbell's main
I object in going to England was to at
tend a convention of the British Associa-
I tion for the Advancement of Science.
