If one comes under the classification of a lightweight, his possibility
of being recognized as an athlete is cramped in no small way. For
example what chance has a basketball player o*f good prep school reputa
tion if he weighs less than one hundred and forty-five pounds? Oppor
tunities are open to him here only in intramural competition. But in
this field he finds no coach, poor equipment, poor competition, and
teammates of a rather speculative caliber.
A revival of the one hundred and forty-five pound team and the
one hundred and thirty pound team would afford the smaller fellows an
opportunity to enjoy the equipment, training, and competition worthy
of their ability.
As for a coach and equipment, the Board of. Athletic Control has
often expressed the policy" of "100 per cent student participation in
athletics," and surely by furnishing these two items it would be carrying
out the expression in a most admirable manner.
Of course in order to make these expenditures worthwhile, a schedule
of high caliber should be planned. \\ ith the teams that are now available
on the peninsula and with the California weight teams as prospective
opponents the schedule would be very attractive. Comparatively speak
ing. the competition would be on a plane which would approach that of
the varsity and which would bid well to outdo that of the freshmen.
As a matter of fact, interest in basketball depends largely upon the flash
and speed of the players, and a good weight team can usually furnish
both these factors.
As to the awards for players it should be possible to offer a circle "S,"
even though it were merely the so-called snake "S," signifying a second
class minor sport.
(The Circle "S" society waxed very enthusiastic over the possibility
of this revival at its meeting last week, and a special committee is now
actively engaged in investigating the possibilities and spreading the
propaganda. If these wearers of the Circle 'S" award are willing that
there should be more of this type of athletic award worn about the
campus, certainly nobody else should object.
The possibilities of settling the question of weight basketball are
particularly ripe at present because the dear old Associated Students
constitution is now being revised. It is certainly a matter for weighty
consideration and a talk with some of the Circle "S" men would almost
convince any human that the subcommittee revising the athletic section
of the constitution is in for a few interesting and rough-house sessions.

(The Circle "S" society waxed very enthusiastic over the possibility
of this revival at its meeting last week, and a special committee is now
actively engaged in investigating the possibilities and spreading the
propaganda. If these wearers of the Circle 'S" award are willing that
there should be more of this type of athletic award worn about the
campus, certainly nobody else should object.
The possibilities of settling the question of weight basketball are
particularly ripe at present because the dear old Associated Students
constitution is now being revised. It is certainly a matter for weighty
consideration and a talk with some of the Circle "S" men would almost
convince any human that the subcommittee revising the athletic section
of the constitution is in for a few interesting and rough-house sessions.
