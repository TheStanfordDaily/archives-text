# About Crew
## 
### 
It is interesting' at this date to see that the idea that Stanford has or
is likely to have a crew in the near future. It seems even more absurd
to tlie present generation of college students than it would to those old
timers who were on the campus when Stanford was still turning out
good crews some seven years back.
But in the distant East the idea still prevails, and we read a dispatch
that Stanford is to be invited to participate in the Poughkecpsie regatta
of this spring. Whether the purpose is to encourage the organization
again of rowing activities or not is aside from the point. Much as we
might like to be represented in competition in crew against the Eastern
universities, or even Washington and California on the Coast, facilities
for rowing are and arc likely to remain nothing more than a dream in
spite of past efforts of Chaparral to arouse enthusiasm.
1 lowever, much more would be necessary than mere enthusiasm. The
cost of putting but one shell into the water runs up into the thousands,
and really satisfactory equipment would be beyond the power of the
University to acquire. Crew at all times drains heavily on the purses of
colleges indulging in the expensive water sport.
