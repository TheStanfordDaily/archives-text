In today's campus opinion Theon
Wright, journalist by profession, takes
issue with Theodore Baer, debater, on
a question that should be of consider
ably more than passing importance.
Mr. Baer, it appears, read an article
in the Daily, which, in turn, was writ
ten by a young man who had read
and roundly disapproved of an article
written by ore Roger Babson, statis
tician extraordinary.
Roger Babson is the man who,
among the legion critics of the Ameri
can university, has the unique distinc
tion of having proposed a method of
improvement. Babson's great fault
was ambition. If he were president
of a college, Babson wrote, he would
do a number of things. He would
"eliminate inefficiency, cut the college
course to two years, train college boys
to habits of thrift, punctuality, and
conscientiousness, and check up on
them, get rid of college snobbery and
stop waste of time."
While it is not a matter of record,
it is more than probable that, after
this, lioger Babson proposed to give
those Aegean Stables a good cleaning
and call it a day.
* * *
But to get back to today's letter.
Theon Wright, after a brief exposition
of the relative merits of the written
and vocal word, assails Theodore Baer
who was rather inclined to defend

Babson, at least in so far as the lat
ter's expose of inefficiency in college
is concerned.
The whole matter resolves itself
| down to definition of efficiency. To
Roger Babson, and to Theodore Baer
to be efficient is to produce a great
I deal of something or other. To Theon
Wright to be efficient is to produce
I something or other that is worth pro
i ducing. In the absence of any definite
I information on the ultimate aim of life
I and the ultimate value of those paltry
I things that man is able to produce,
Theon Wright, we suspect, feels rather
J sympathetic with the thousands of
| young men who are milling about in
American universities wondering
what to do with themselves. At any
' rate, Theon Wright is certainly sym
pathetic with their almost unanimous
decision not to do any useless work
—even if the complete effectiveness
jof this decision involves abstinence
from all kinds of work.
It is probable that neither Theon
Wright, nor Theodore Baer, nor Roger
Babson have shed any really new light
upon the subject. For hard-headed
men have been calling for action and
philosophers have been talking about
futility for some time. For a long
time, in fact, before that Old Testa
ment author wrote, "Vanity of vani
j ties, all is vanity .... And wherein
! profiteth a man for all that he labour
| eth under the sun."

I information on the ultimate aim of life
I and the ultimate value of those paltry
I things that man is able to produce,
Theon Wright, we suspect, feels rather
J sympathetic with the thousands of
| young men who are milling about in
American universities wondering
what to do with themselves. At any
' rate, Theon Wright is certainly sym
pathetic with their almost unanimous
decision not to do any useless work
—even if the complete effectiveness
jof this decision involves abstinence
from all kinds of work.
It is probable that neither Theon
Wright, nor Theodore Baer, nor Roger
Babson have shed any really new light
upon the subject. For hard-headed
men have been calling for action and
philosophers have been talking about
futility for some time. For a long
time, in fact, before that Old Testa
ment author wrote, "Vanity of vani
j ties, all is vanity .... And wherein
! profiteth a man for all that he labour
| eth under the sun."
In today's campus opinion Theon
Wright, journalist by profession, takes
issue with Theodore Baer, debater, on
a question that should be of consider
ably more than passing importance.
Mr. Baer, it appears, read an article
in the Daily, which, in turn, was writ
ten by a young man who had read
and roundly disapproved of an article
written by ore Roger Babson, statis
tician extraordinary.
Roger Babson is the man who,
among the legion critics of the Ameri
can university, has the unique distinc
tion of having proposed a method of
improvement. Babson's great fault
was ambition. If he were president
of a college, Babson wrote, he would
do a number of things. He would
"eliminate inefficiency, cut the college
course to two years, train college boys
to habits of thrift, punctuality, and
conscientiousness, and check up on
them, get rid of college snobbery and
stop waste of time."
While it is not a matter of record,
it is more than probable that, after
this, lioger Babson proposed to give
those Aegean Stables a good cleaning
and call it a day.

But to get back to today's letter.
Theon Wright, after a brief exposition
of the relative merits of the written
and vocal word, assails Theodore Baer
who was rather inclined to defend

Babson, at least in so far as the lat
ter's expose of inefficiency in college
is concerned.
The whole matter resolves itself
| down to definition of efficiency. To
Roger Babson, and to Theodore Baer
to be efficient is to produce a great
I deal of something or other. To Theon
Wright to be efficient is to produce
I something or other that is worth pro
i ducing. In the absence of any definite
I information on the ultimate aim of life
I and the ultimate value of those paltry
I things that man is able to produce,
