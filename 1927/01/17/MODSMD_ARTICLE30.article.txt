The Editor, Sir:
The entrance of a debater into the quar
rel over "philosophical" or "efficient" col
leges, is greeted with enthusiasm. Debat
ers are inherited from the Middle Ages,
when words were more desirable than
ideas.
It must be admitted that Mr. Theodore
Baer is at a distinct disadvantage in a tilt
in which written words are required; half
the effect of a debater's argument is
achieved by certain arrangements of the
face and by semaphoric motions with the
hands. This has the effect of stirring the
audience to the proper pitch of enthus
iasm. A violent blow "TH one hand upon
the other is a signal for serious contem
plation ; spasmodic twitches in the muscu
lar regions of the face cause the audi
tence to laugh, and so on.
Despite this serious defect in the ar
rangement of the argument—a defect
which, it must be admitted, reduces the
essential effectiveness of a debater's argu
ment—Mr. Baer is quite able to get along.
We laugh just at the proper moment, and
everything.
Mr. Baer has a wholesome respect for
the good, sound realities of life. So has a
cow, while chewing her cud. Mr. Baer
admires the splendid efficiency of Mr.
Babson's statistical analysis—much more
lucidly set forth than any silly editorial.
There are a number of such statistical
bureaus in this land, that are improve
ments on Mr. Babsoti. They can prove
that the world is changing to a race of
children or supermen, depending on
whether you would like to become a child
or a superman. Undoubtedly they could

satisfy Mr. Baer, who dislikes supermen.
Mr. Babson is undoubtedly excellent at
mathematics—adding, and the like. But
think of how much more clear and lucid
are the mentalities of adding machines,
which never make a mistake. Probably
the ultimate purpose of God is to evolve
from the human race a new race of first
class adding machines.
Philosophy, according to Mr. Baer, is
the contemplation of perfect mechanism.
We suggest that Mr. Baer be given em
ployment as a printer's devil, where he
may contemplate in sublime and mystical
delight the supreme quantities of the linc
o-type machine, one of the most complex
mechanism devised by "the most disci
plined minds."
Mr. Baer took a course in the philoso
phy he despises, not so long ago. The re
sult, as compiled by the "disciplined
minds" of the statisticians in the regis
trar's office was such that if it it had
been one-third of a grade lower, it would
n't have been any grade at all. Undoubt
edly this has influenced the repugnance
which he feels for philosophy, at the
same time imbuing him with a wholesome
rcspect for statistical methods.
Machines, devised by "the most disci
plined minds," are becoming so simple
that a child can operate them; which
probably explains the historical signifi
cance of that prophetic utterance: "A Ut
ile child shall lead them!"
With the highest respect for Mr. Baer
and his "most disciplined minds," I beg
to remain,
Very sincerely yours,
THEON WRIGHT.
