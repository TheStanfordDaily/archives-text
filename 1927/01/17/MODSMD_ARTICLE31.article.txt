The Not Impossible She. By Arthur i
Weigall. (Frank-Maurice, Inc., New
York, 1926. $2.00'.)
Two of the three subjects for a satis- 1
factory bull-session —Religion and Love
—are expounded with humor and pene-1
(ration in this best-seller from one of
the less-known publishers. Life, the j
third of the infallible trio, Mr. Weigall
leaves to speak for itself.
In his search for the "not impossible
she" of Richard Crashaw's poem, Se
bastian Wake travels from an infancy |
spent as the son of a Salvation Army
mother through two English schools
and a year at Oxford to co-respondency
(at the mature age of nineteen) in a
particularly public divorce case, an
unsuccessful marriage, and a long
liason with the woman he should have
married in the first place. And Arthur
Weigall ranges from a discussion of
the reactions of a naive mind under
going its first, experience of a High 1
Church chapel service to a dissertation
on the hygiene of wedded life.
First Part of Book 13
Autobiographical
Just how much of "The Not Impos
sible She" is autobiographical we
would hesitate to say, but certainly
the early part of the book, describing

young Sebastian's childhood and edu
cation, must have been v drawn largely
from the author's own memory. The
bewildering effect of successive ex
posure to the blood-and-fire theology of
the Salvation Army, to the milder dog
mas of conventional Methodism, and
at last to the elevating influence of the
Church of England, can only be au
thentic.
Quite the most interesting, of the
persons of the story, aside from Se
bastian himself (and all of Mr. Wei
gall's characterizations are unusually
keen), is Sebastian's mother, Amelia.
She was the daughter of one of the
most famous of England's poets, and
the wife of one of the first of Eng
land's "highbrows." At the death of
her soldier-husband, she joined the
Salvation Army as an outlet for sup
pressed energy, and devoted some five
years to an extended slumming-party.
Then she married again, but her duties
as wife of a Methodist minister did not
weigli upon her with sufficient heavi
ness to prevent an absorbing interest
in ihe founding and mlminisiration of
a home for seduced servant-girls. A
very modern person, Amelia, not with
standing her generation, is both more
vigorous and more strong minded than

the usual conception of the mid-Vic
torian female.
Not Sex Novel Despite
Scarlet Incidents
Mr. Weigall's story, in spite of vari
ous slightly scarlet incidents, is any
thing but a "sex novel." It is too
matter-of-fact, too outspoken, for that.
There is none of the prurient innuendo
of modern erotic realism. Besides,
nothing that is so infused with a sense
of the inevitable comedy of human ex-;
istence, and told in sentences so- satu- j
rated with a delicate and caustic wit, j
can be really "sexy."
We have never before come across ;
Mr. Weigall, so we don't know whether
"The Not Impossible She" is a first
novel, but in any case we are await
ing its successor with interest.

mas of conventional Methodism, and
at last to the elevating influence of the
Church of England, can only be au
thentic.
Quite the most interesting, of the
persons of the story, aside from Se
bastian himself (and all of Mr. Wei
gall's characterizations are unusually
keen), is Sebastian's mother, Amelia.
She was the daughter of one of the
most famous of England's poets, and
the wife of one of the first of Eng
land's "highbrows." At the death of
her soldier-husband, she joined the
Salvation Army as an outlet for sup
pressed energy, and devoted some five
years to an extended slumming-party.
Then she married again, but her duties
as wife of a Methodist minister did not
weigli upon her with sufficient heavi
ness to prevent an absorbing interest
in ihe founding and mlminisiration of
a home for seduced servant-girls. A
very modern person, Amelia, not with
standing her generation, is both more
vigorous and more strong minded than

the usual conception of the mid-Vic
torian female.
Not Sex Novel Despite
Scarlet Incidents
Mr. Weigall's story, in spite of vari
ous slightly scarlet incidents, is any
thing but a "sex novel." It is too
matter-of-fact, too outspoken, for that.
There is none of the prurient innuendo
of modern erotic realism. Besides,
nothing that is so infused with a sense
of the inevitable comedy of human ex-;
istence, and told in sentences so- satu- j
rated with a delicate and caustic wit, j
can be really "sexy."
We have never before come across ;
Mr. Weigall, so we don't know whether
"The Not Impossible She" is a first
novel, but in any case we are await
ing its successor with interest.

The Not Impossible She. By Arthur i
Weigall. (Frank-Maurice, Inc., New
York, 1926. $2.00'.)
Two of the three subjects for a satis- 1
factory bull-session —Religion and Love
—are expounded with humor and pene-1
(ration in this best-seller from one of
the less-known publishers. Life, the j
third of the infallible trio, Mr. Weigall
leaves to speak for itself.
In his search for the "not impossible
she" of Richard Crashaw's poem, Se
bastian Wake travels from an infancy |
spent as the son of a Salvation Army
mother through two English schools
and a year at Oxford to co-respondency
(at the mature age of nineteen) in a
particularly public divorce case, an
unsuccessful marriage, and a long
liason with the woman he should have
married in the first place. And Arthur
Weigall ranges from a discussion of
the reactions of a naive mind under
going its first, experience of a High 1
Church chapel service to a dissertation
on the hygiene of wedded life.
First Part of Book 13
Autobiographical
Just how much of "The Not Impos
sible She" is autobiographical we
would hesitate to say, but certainly
the early part of the book, describing

young Sebastian's childhood and edu
cation, must have been v drawn largely
from the author's own memory. The
bewildering effect of successive ex
posure to the blood-and-fire theology of
the Salvation Army, to the milder dog
mas of conventional Methodism, and
at last to the elevating influence of the
Church of England, can only be au
thentic.
