## El Toro Runs Away With Sequoia Squad and Wins 20-8 
### 
Intramural Results: !
El Toro 20, Sequoia 11, 8.
Alpha Sigma Phi 14, Theta Chi, 11.
In the intramural basketball con- j
tests Friday afternoon, the El Toro
team won an easy victory over Se
quoia II and Alpha Sigma Phi de
feated the Theta Chi five in a spirited
contest after an extra five-minute
playing period. The Alpha Sig team
emerged the winner with a 14-11 score.
Crandall Stars
Crandall was the bright light for ;
the eating club quintet. lie shot three
baskets in the first half and another
trio in the second, being particularly
valuable in a tip-off play which Toro
worked consistently for points.
The whole team worked smoothly
together, the passing being excellent j
for intramural play, and Crandall, j
with the aid of Krause, Arthur, and
Klbby, sank the ball with regularity, i
Mack and Sims did the best work for
the losers, the former making three
baskets. Sims' one goal was a tricky
shot from the sidelines that brought
a roar from the onlookers.
Ferguson Leads
The Alpha Sigs were fortunate to
have had Ferguson at forward in their |
lineup, for when the second half j
ended he had accounted for 9 of the j
11 points his team hdd scored, and in |
the extra period won the game with a j
spectacular basket.
Scoring honors were fairly well I
divided on the Theta Chi side, Green, !
Reaser, Duncan, Hogle, and Richmond
contributing to the cause. Ten per
sonal fouls and one technical were j
committed by the losers, and th : s
fact was largely responsible for their
defeat. The guarding was zealous, and j
it was rarely that the forwards of j
either team could break through the j
opposition's defense and get under
the basket.
