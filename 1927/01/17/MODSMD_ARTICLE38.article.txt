# UNIVERSITY BOOKS TWICE OUTGROW OUARTERS LIBRARY COMPARATIVELY RECENT IMPROVEMENT SECOND STRUCTURE DESTROYED BY EARTHQUAKE

It is only in recent years that the ;
Stanford Library collection has had a
permanent home. Before 1919, when
the present library was completed, the
University books, ever increasing,
twice outgrew their quarters.
On October 1, 1891, when Stanford
first opened its doors for instruction,
the library was situated in the build
ing now occupied by the Law library j
in the inner quadrangle. It contained
some 3000 volumes, although its 1
shelves were capable of holding l
18,000 books. The room comfortably I
accommodated one hundred readers.
The accessions of tho first year were !
largely books most immediately and
urgently needed by the Various depart- j
ments, the most important works j
available for student use being in the
private collections of the professors.
In this year the library received
some 2000 books on railroads, the gift j
of Mr. Timothy Hopkins, to whose
generosity the library has many times
since been indebted for valuable dona
tions. This collection formed the nu
cleus of the Hopkins Railway Library,
now comprising some 10,000 volumes.
At the end of the second year the
library had a staff consisting of the i
librarian and two student assistants, [
while the number of its books had
jumped to .15,000. The Hopkins Sea
side Laboratory at Pacific Grove had |
been established.
Finances Low
It was at this time that the death
of Senator Stanford occurred. This j
event came at a time of severe finan
cial stringency amounting almost to |
a panic. There followed the attempt:
by court proceedings to invalidate the i
property deed to Stanford University i
on account of alleged government !
claims against the railroad. Though i
eventually thrown out of court, this I
suit resulted in financial embarrass-!
ment for tho University and conse- j
quentlv left little money for the I
library. The report for that year states !
that the bills for books ordered by
the University were less than $2000,
while bills authorized and paid by Mr.
Hopkins were nearly $6000. Also in j
this year there was acquired the valu
able library of Professor Hildebrand
of Germany on Germanic philology
and early literature.
In IS9B, the urgent need of a cata- j
logue was felt, so a volunteer force of
seventy-eight students was organized, 1
which, working for a week-end period, i
prepared a rough card catalogue of ;
some 12,000 volumes.
New Building Donated
The temporary quarters of the li- J
brary being now outgrown, a new
library in the outer quadrangle was
built, the gift of Thomas Welton
Stanford of Australia. In January 1900
some 250 students removed the library
volumes to this new home, now the
administration building, while the
rooms thus vacated became the library
of the Law department.
Four years later it became evident
that the building in the outer quad
rangle would not be adequate for the
growing library, either in capacity or
fire protection, so Mrs. Stanford began
the construction of a new library in
front of the quadrangle. This building
was nearly completed, except for in
terior finishing and furnishing, when
it was destroyed beyond all hope of
economical reconstruction.
Funds Appropriated
The loss by fire of the important
libraries in San Francisco mado the
University more than ever dependent
on its own resources, and made evi
dent, tho necessity of a more rapid
development of the library than here
tofore. Accordingly the Board of Trus
tees appropriated a sum of $21,000 for
(ho purchase of books for the follow
ing year.
In 1907 the position of librarian, va
cant since 1902, was filled by the
selection of Mr. George T. Clark, then
the successful librarian of the San
Francisco Public Library, and previ
ously connected with the Library of

j the University of California and with
the California State Library. Under
his leadership the Stanford Library
has flourished for the past twenty
years.
In 190S, after the death of Mrs.
Stanford, and in accordance with her
wishes, the proceeds from the sale of
her jewels went to the establishment
of the Jewel Fund, "the income there
j from to be used exclusively for the
| purchase of books and other publica
tions."
i The immediate result of this action
1 was to make available about $20,000
I
a year. The larger appropriations
brought with them problems of ap
portionment of the funds with due
J regard to the needs and desires of the
! various departments. A system of
allotment by units, with occasional re-
I visions from year to year satisfac
torily solved the problem.
Plans Adopted
In 1913 the Board of Trustees de
cided to construct a new building
which should furnish adequate facili
ties for the growth of the library for
many years to come and afford the
greatest protection from fire. The
plans as worked out by Librarian
Clark, based on his survey of the
; principal Eastern libraries, and the
architects, Messrs. Bakewell and
; Brown of San Francisco, were at last
| adopted. Our entrance into the World
â€¢ War delayed the completion of the
! building, however, so that it was not
. ready for occupation until 1919.
The present structure will accom
: modate about 700,000 volumes, and at
the rate of increase in recent years
i should give adequate accommodation
! for fifty years to come, declares
Librarian Clark. Looking even farther
ahead, the plans make provision for
extension in the future so that the
present capacity may be doubled.
