# MOVES TAKEN TO BRING BACK WEIGHT BASKETBALL
## 
### 
Active moves to re-establish weight
basketball as a minor sport and to in
-1 elude it in the award clauses of the
A.S.S.L*. constitution, now under revi
sion, are on foot.
Circle "S" Society, honorary athletic
fraternity, at a meeting last week select
ed an investigating committee to inquire
into the present and future status of
weight basketball teams.
In the revision of the awards clauses
last spring, weight basketball was omit
ted from the sports receiving awards.
Prior to this the teams were to receive
circle "S's" only if they distinguished
themselves against California." The rea
son given this year for no team being
budgeted was that no definite provision
for awards had been made.
Petition Presented
Backed by a petition of two hundred
and sixty-eight names asking that weight
basketball teams be placed on the athletic
program. Graduate Manager Masters and
the Executive Committee have been ap
proached without success. Masters has
refused to budget expenses for this sport.
Masters' refusal and the inability of the
Executive Committee to act, by virtue of
its not being so empowered by the pres
ent constitution, places the matter di
rectly before the revision committee. With

I the organized efforts of Circle "S" So
| cicty working in connection with inter
ested students, the matter is expetced to
be brought to a head shortly.
Much Criticism
In the recurring storms of criticism of
the awards plans during the past two
i years, weight basketball has been one of
j the most discussed sports. Arguments for
its permanency in the athletic program as
advanced by the supporters of the sport
I are many.
Though "athletics for all" is not exactly
, the slogan of Stanford weight basketball
| admits many students to competition who
would otherwise be forced into virtual
inactivity. It may be argued that intra
mural athletics, the division of basketball
in particular, allows a great number to
' compete but not with inducements avail
j able to weight basketball team candidates.
Opponents o fthe plan to yearly sched
ule weight basketball claim that no
; awards should be provided for because
j but little interest is ever shown in this
J form of competition.
However, it is pointed out, that little
interest can ever be shown when the
j whole question of awards is a matter not
decided until after the season's schedule
has been played and someone, it is not
defined who, has determined whether or
i not the team deserves letters.
