# RECENT TRIP ABROAD PROVIDES MATERIALS FOR MARTIN LECTURE
## Impressions of Near East, South America Chief Topic 
### 
Eighteen months' travel through
Europe, the Near East, and South
America, will provide material for a
talk on "Fugitive Impressions of the
Near East and South America" to be
given by Professor Percy A. Martin
of the History department at 7:30
o'clock tomorrow night in the Little
Theatre.
During his trip in the Near East lie
was in the war zone in Syria and was
in Baalbec, which was captured by
the rebels shortly after his departure.
In April he sailed for South Amer
ica where he spent several months in
Uruguay gathering material for a
monograph on the government of
Uruguay, which he is preparing for
the Carnegie Institute of Washington.
Speaking of Argentina, where he
spent five or six weeks, he com
mented, "In Argentina there is a very
intense and stimulating cultural ac
tivity. Nowhere outside of Europe and
the United States is such fine work
being done in historical investigation
as in Argentina. National archives
there are highly organized in such a
way that they are accessible for the
use of students of history."
While in Argentina Professor Mar
tin lectured before the University of
La Plata and the Argentina Historical
Society on "The Development of His
torical Studies in the United States."
In his lectures Professor Martin gave
great credit to the work of the Hoover
War Library at Stanford.
