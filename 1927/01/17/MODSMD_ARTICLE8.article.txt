# BABES DEFEAT TWO HIGH SCHOOL SQUADS IN WEEK-END GAMES

Stanford's freshman basketball
team won its games of the week-end
by defeating the Roosevelt High
School quintet from Oakland Friday
night, 39-28, and vanquishing the Oak

32-11.

Saturday night was the marked im

made seven baskets and was high
point man of the game.

half was 12-8 in favor of the Babes.

their stride and held the Oakland
