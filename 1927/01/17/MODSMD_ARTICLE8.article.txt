# BABES DEFEAT TWO HIGH SCHOOL SQUADS IN WEEK-END GAMES
## Freshmen Down Roosevelt, Oakland Teams; Show Improvement 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team won its games of the week-end
by defeating the Roosevelt High
School quintet from Oakland Friday
night, 39-28, and vanquishing the Oak
land High School five Saturday night,
32-11.
The noticeable factor in the contest
Saturday night was the marked im
provement of the Babe squad. Its
plays baffled the Oakland High play
ers, who seemed unable to combat the
five-man defence which the yearlings
exhibited in the second half. The
passes of Coach Hunt's men were ac
curate and well-executed. Stewart
made seven baskets and was high
point man of the game.
Ahead at Half
During the first half the outcome
was doubtful, as the visiting quintet
had a teamwork that excelled any
thing the freshmen had been up
against. The score at the end of the
half was 12-8 in favor of the Babes.
In the second half the freshmen hit
their stride and held the Oakland
team to three points, while they them
selves made twenty tallies. The latter
got near enough the babe goal to
make only ten shots at the basket.
The guarding of Simpkins, right
guard, was the foundation for this
tight defensive which the yearlings
used for the first time.
Fourteen Men Used
Coach Hunt and Assistant Coach
.Mitchell tried various combinations of
players throughout the game and four-
I teen men were given a chance to dis
j play their ability.
Friday's game was more hotly con
j tested than the one Saturday night,
i Although the babes won by a 39-28
j peore, they did not have a real lead
until late in the contest. The score at
! the end of the first half was 20-17 in
j favor of the freshmen and at the end
I of the third quarter it read 30-26 for
| the yearlings.
Careful Guarding
The careful guarding of Thompson
was the outstanding feature of the
fray and his long passing out of the
danger zone was accurate. Berg and
Stewart scored heavily, the former
making nineteen points and the latter
seven.

I against Roosevelt High School, Fri
] day night, for the babes was: Berg

Stanford's freshman basketball
team won its games of the week-end
by defeating the Roosevelt High
School quintet from Oakland Friday
night, 39-28, and vanquishing the Oak
land High School five Saturday night,
32-11.
The noticeable factor in the contest
Saturday night was the marked im
provement of the Babe squad. Its
plays baffled the Oakland High play
ers, who seemed unable to combat the
five-man defence which the yearlings
exhibited in the second half. The
passes of Coach Hunt's men were ac
curate and well-executed. Stewart
made seven baskets and was high
point man of the game.
Ahead at Half
During the first half the outcome
was doubtful, as the visiting quintet
had a teamwork that excelled any
thing the freshmen had been up
against. The score at the end of the
half was 12-8 in favor of the Babes.
In the second half the freshmen hit
their stride and held the Oakland
team to three points, while they them
selves made twenty tallies. The latter
got near enough the babe goal to
make only ten shots at the basket.
The guarding of Simpkins, right
guard, was the foundation for this
tight defensive which the yearlings
used for the first time.
Fourteen Men Used
Coach Hunt and Assistant Coach
.Mitchell tried various combinations of
players throughout the game and four-
I teen men were given a chance to dis
j play their ability.
Friday's game was more hotly con
j tested than the one Saturday night,
i Although the babes won by a 39-28
j peore, they did not have a real lead
until late in the contest. The score at
! the end of the first half was 20-17 in
j favor of the freshmen and at the end
I of the third quarter it read 30-26 for
| the yearlings.
Careful Guarding
The careful guarding of Thompson
was the outstanding feature of the
fray and his long passing out of the
danger zone was accurate. Berg and
Stewart scored heavily, the former
making nineteen points and the latter
seven.
The starting lineup for the game
I against Roosevelt High School, Fri
] day night, for the babes was: Berg
I and Stewart, forwards; Bush, center;
j Simpkins and Thompson, guards. Sub-

I stitutes were: Smith for Stewart, Mc-
I Dowel 1 for Berg, Garabotto for Smith,
i and Rothert for Simpkins.
! Saturday night the starting players
j for the freshmen were: Hare and
