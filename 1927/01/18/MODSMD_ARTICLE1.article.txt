Encina 3E and Sigma Chi yesterday
•sent teams into the intramural games
that showed some of the fastest play
seen thus far in the series. The fresh
men were victorious over the Cardi
nals, and Sigma Chi over Phi Delta
Theta in contests that were filled with
fast attacks, close defense, and many
tumbles. Alpha Kappa Lambda re
turned to their second game a greatly
improved team, showing better shoot
ing and defense work in their 18 to 9
victory over Encina 4W.
Encina 3E broke into the win col
umn of intramural basketball yester
day afternoon by slipping the Cardi
nals a neat 8 to 5 beating. The first
half was a mediocre affair with nei
ther side showing much class. It closed
with the score tied, 4 to 4. The fire
works began when the second period
opened, the freshmen having injected
Long and Malcolm into the fray. The
former was distinctly the most out
standing player on the floor. His tac
tics were fast and elusive and his four
points made him high-scorer of the
contest. Brockway and Taylor, for the
defeated five, made rough sailing for
Encina's team and managed to keep
the game in doubt until the final
moments, but the Cardinals' lack of
teamwork cost them the game in the
end.
