Encina 3E and Sigma Chi yesterday
•sent teams into the intramural games
that showed some of the fastest play
seen thus far in the series. The fresh
men were victorious over the Cardi
nals, and Sigma Chi over Phi Delta
Theta in contests that were filled with
fast attacks, close defense, and many
tumbles. Alpha Kappa Lambda re
turned to their second game a greatly
improved team, showing better shoot
ing and defense work in their 18 to 9
victory over Encina 4W.
Encina 3E broke into the win col
umn of intramural basketball yester
day afternoon by slipping the Cardi
nals a neat 8 to 5 beating. The first
half was a mediocre affair with nei
ther side showing much class. It closed
with the score tied, 4 to 4. The fire
works began when the second period
opened, the freshmen having injected
Long and Malcolm into the fray. The
former was distinctly the most out
standing player on the floor. His tac
tics were fast and elusive and his four
points made him high-scorer of the
contest. Brockway and Taylor, for the
defeated five, made rough sailing for
Encina's team and managed to keep
the game in doubt until the final
moments, but the Cardinals' lack of
teamwork cost them the game in the
end.
Shooting at will and from almost
any angle the Chi Psi hoopmen
swamped the Japanose Club five by
a 28 to 2 score in the second clash of
the afternoon's series. Clyne and King
went wild at various times and sank
shots with bewildering rapidity. The
former dropped the ball through the
hoop six times, and King was suc
cessful on five occasions.
The one-sideness of the game made
it decidedly second-rate from the
standpoint of real basketball, but the
fraternity five's smooth co-ordination
saved it from being a complete fade
out. The Japs fought hard enough, but
their lack of stature and inferior
teamwork ruined their hopes. Eiulo,
at center, was the most nearly pre
sentable player for the losers.
Phi Delts Lose
In a spectacular battle, replete with
thrills and speedy playing, Sigma Chi
tripped up the Phi Delts 21 to 11 in
by far the outstanding game of the
afternoon. happened with be
wildering swiftness. The first half, in
particular, was flawless from the stand
point of fast, smooth teamwork on the
part of both groups of belligerents.
The score stood four to six, at the
close of the half, for th e Sigma Chi
lads, but when the second period be
gan the Phi Delts entered the game
just enough flustered to let Brady
sneak through with four field goals.
Farmer and Bowers also took advan
tage of the weakened defense of the
Phi Delts and chalked up seven points.
Long, at forward for the losing five,
played a clever game in advancing the
ball up the floor, but was unlucky in
hitting the hoop.
El Cuadro Swamped
In a game of many fouls, the In
dians advanced one step farther in
the, percentage column when they
scalped El Cuadro by the score of
23 to G. With two baskets apiece from
Montferino and Telonicher, the Indians
were able to hold the El Cuadro team
to one tally in the first half. During
the second period, Frazer and Gandv
each contributed a field goal and Jones
a foul, and that was the end of the
scoring for El Cuadro. Schwarz
brought up the winner's total eight
points by shooting four field goals one
after another in the second half.
Although Montferino was penalized
with three personal fouls in the first
few minutes of play, he managed to
remain in the game, playing fast, and
making excellent passes. Telonicher
put up a nice game at guard, as did
Kazanjiian, who consistently broke up
El Cuadro attacks. Gandy and Fraser
both did a good share of the work
for the losers; they were both weak
ened, as were others of their team, by
injuries.
Barnett Stars for A.K.L.
Ability to break through their op
ponents' defense almost at will en
abled the A.K.L. quintet to crush the
Encina 4W men, 18 to 9. Barnett was
the outstanding player for the fra
ternity. Although not getting into his
stride until the last half, McDougall
showed some real speed at center.
With Kellogg and Stollery guarding
them closely, the freshmen had little
chance to get anywhere near the
bucket.
The only yearling to sink a field
goal was O'Donnell, who accounted for
four points. He tried many long shots,
but every one hit the ring and bounded
away. The Encina team started out
looking like winners before the game
had barely begun. They ran up a four
point. lead in a few minutes, but ended
the first half two points behind. The
A.K.L. second team, which had just
been able to hold the freshmen, was
taken out., and the first five put back
in. From then on, the game was prac
tically a cinch for the Itow quintet.
Deke Offense Weak
Keeping within one point of each
other for the first half, after keeping
the game scoreless for the first six
minutes, the Dekes and the S.A.E.'s
started to play a very ragged, careless
game. Inaccurate passes and much
holding featured the play throughout
the entire first period.
With the start of the last half, both
teams began to play a better game.
Gi 1 ins of SA.E. dropped in three
fielu goals and Laßue two and a foul.
Lloyd, who had been throwing the ball
at the backboard with no results what
ever, suddenly made a long shot with
the ball dropping perfectly into the
basket.
The main reason, in the opinion of
the spectators, for less scoring from
the Dekes, seemed to be due to the
fact that none of their men followed
up their shots. Ogden and Robb were
able to slip through their opponents'
defense, but could not get into posi
tion to shoot. The times that they
could get near the basket, Stevenson
would step in and break things up. At
the end of the game, the Dekes re
sorted to long shots, but none of them
