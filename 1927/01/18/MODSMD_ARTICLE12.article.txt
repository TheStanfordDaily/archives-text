# FRESHMEN RAISE GRADES USING MORE ELECTRICITY
## 
### 
The steady yearly decrease in schol-1
arship disqualifications among fresh- 1
men, commented on by the assistant 1
registrar yesterday, may be in part j
explained by the fact that campus
consumption of elgctricity has more
than doubled in the last few years, 1
and that Encina Hall consumes the
most of that commodity.
Four years ago the maximum de
mand for electricity by the campus j
was about 400 horsepower and it has i
now increased to 700 horsepower, j
These are the facts released by J. W. ,
McDonnell, Electrical Engineer at the
Campus Sub-Station for the past fif
teen years.
4000-Volt Supply
An incoming current, of 4000 volts
from the Pacific Gas & Electric Com
pany lines to the sub-station supplies
tlio cnajor electrical demands of the
campus, including power to the elec
tric motors used to drive the oil
pumps which supply the fuel for bak
ing. and most of the utility apparatus
Much as meat-cutters, dish-washers, I
-loves, and ire machines. In addition
there i:: a 1 r.O horsepower generator in
(lie sub-station which is used for run
utng the University Press and provid

ing electricity for direct current ex
periments on the Quad. In the near
future, declares McDonnell, this will
be transferred to the Guggenheim
Laboratory and a thirty-horsepower
generator will be substituted for it in
the sub-station.
Trees Cause Trouble
The cause of the power's going off.
resulting temporarily in an almost
total paralysis of campus activities,
is usually due to line trouble on the
Pacific Gas & Electric, Company con
duits, declares McDonnell. Local elec
trical trouble is caused usually by
trees blowing against the lines cross
ing the arboretum. A fallen tree on
the local wires was the cause of the
recent cessation of electric power. No
accidents to the campus power system
from lightning have ever been re
corded, and there are no lightning
arresters on the campus.
Initiating the program of putting the
elcctric lines underground, an excava
tion has been started on Panama
street. The completed program is de
signed to eliminate any trouble aris
ing from interference by fallen trees,
as well as delete th e unsightly posts

The steady yearly decrease in schol-1
arship disqualifications among fresh- 1
men, commented on by the assistant 1
registrar yesterday, may be in part j
explained by the fact that campus
consumption of elgctricity has more
than doubled in the last few years, 1
and that Encina Hall consumes the
most of that commodity.
Four years ago the maximum de
mand for electricity by the campus j
was about 400 horsepower and it has i
now increased to 700 horsepower, j
These are the facts released by J. W. ,
McDonnell, Electrical Engineer at the
Campus Sub-Station for the past fif
teen years.
4000-Volt Supply
An incoming current, of 4000 volts
from the Pacific Gas & Electric Com
pany lines to the sub-station supplies
tlio cnajor electrical demands of the
campus, including power to the elec
tric motors used to drive the oil
pumps which supply the fuel for bak
ing. and most of the utility apparatus
Much as meat-cutters, dish-washers, I
-loves, and ire machines. In addition
there i:: a 1 r.O horsepower generator in
(lie sub-station which is used for run
utng the University Press and provid

ing electricity for direct current ex
periments on the Quad. In the near
future, declares McDonnell, this will
be transferred to the Guggenheim
Laboratory and a thirty-horsepower
generator will be substituted for it in
the sub-station.
Trees Cause Trouble
The cause of the power's going off.
resulting temporarily in an almost
total paralysis of campus activities,
is usually due to line trouble on the
Pacific Gas & Electric, Company con
duits, declares McDonnell. Local elec
trical trouble is caused usually by
trees blowing against the lines cross
ing the arboretum. A fallen tree on
the local wires was the cause of the
recent cessation of electric power. No
accidents to the campus power system
from lightning have ever been re
corded, and there are no lightning
arresters on the campus.
Initiating the program of putting the
elcctric lines underground, an excava
tion has been started on Panama
street. The completed program is de
signed to eliminate any trouble aris
ing from interference by fallen trees,
