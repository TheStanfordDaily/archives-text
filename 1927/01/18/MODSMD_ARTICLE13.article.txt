# CARDINAL MENTOR DRILLS MEN FOR SOUTHERN GAMES
## Ted Shipkey, Veteran Guard, Turns Out for Position On Varsity Five 
### Fred Speers 
In anticipation of the coming South
ern tour of the varsity basketball
team, Coach Husky Hunt sent the
squad through a stiff workout, last
night. On Friday night the team meets
U.S.C. and plays the Branch on the
following night in a return game.
The Cardinal mentor handed out
several new plays last night and had
them gone over thoroughly both in
scrimmage and directed practice. Fif
teen men will be chosen tomorrow or
Thursday to make up the squad which
will be taken South.
Ted Shipkey, a veteran basketball
man of the past two years, reported
for practice for the first time last
night. Shipkey has been troubled with
a dislocated shoulder which is not yet
entirely well.
