# H.G. WELLS' IDEAS UPON RELIGION NOT SOUNDâ€”FAIRCLOUGH
## 
### 
"H. G. Wells has made a preposterous
and unsound statement in declaring that
the religion of primitive man lacked the
finer qualities found in later developments
of religion." This was the opinion ex
pressed by Professor Henry R. Fair
clough of the Classical Literature de
partment in a talk to the Stanford Epis
copal Club.
Professor Fairclough declared that al
though he is a firm believer in the theory
of evolution he does not agree with
Wells' idea that man, after reaching the
state of man, has shown much improve
ment spiritually. Professor Fairclough
believes that the men of the reindeer age
were as much aware of the spiritual
beauty of the universe as the men of
today; in fact, their appreciation may
have been greater.
"The life of the average person today
is so pampered by civilization that he
neglects the spiritual side of it. To the
primitive man, on the other hand, a close
conlact with nature made religion and
worship an intrinsic part of his life."
Professor Fairclough cites the thug
district of Chicago, a city which records
a murder a day, as an example of the
spiritual unprogrcssiveness of no small
percentage of the population of the "civil
ized" world of today.
