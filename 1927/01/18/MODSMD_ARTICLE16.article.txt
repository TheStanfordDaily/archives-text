# CO-OPERATIVE BUYING PLAN CONSIDERED BY FRATERNITY HOUSES
## House Managers Deliberate On Purchase Economy Arrangement 
### 
At a joint meeting last night of the
house managers of the different fra
ternity houses and the members of j
the interfraternity council, the prob
lem of a buying plan for campus fra
ternity houses was discussed.
Fred Kunzel, who was appointed by
Karl Doerr, president of the inter- j
fraternity council, as chairman of the |
co-operative plan committee, reported j
to the group that a tentative constitu- j
tion was being drawn up which will be I
presented to the twenty-four house;
managers one week from today at a
dinner scheduled at the Phi Gamma
Delta house.
At this time the house managers
will debate the practicability of the
constitution and straighten out its dei
tails, before submitting the plan to !
their respective houses for their ap
proval or rejection.
The co-operative buying plan as pro-;
posed is an association among the j
houses for the betterment of their pur- i
chasing power, chiefly through buy- i
ing in increased quantities. An in- j
vestigaiion carried on in colleges and j
universities where the co-operative!
plan is in operation has proved that, '
almost without exception, the system
has been a success wherever tried,
resulting in marked economies to the
houses participating.
The committee declares that the j
plan will not interfere with the free- j
dom of the different houses in such j
matters as choosing what menus they
desire. In no way is it intended to ;
create a uniformity in these respects. |
Some of the greatest economies re
sulting from the system are in pur
chases of coal or other fuel, the cost
of which is materially reduced by
quantity purchasing.
