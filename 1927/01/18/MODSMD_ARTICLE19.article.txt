A week-end conference held at the
Roth cabin in Santa Cruz January 8,
of cabinet members of the Y.M.C.A.

an open forum to discuss the problems
confronting them.
Questions Propounded
Some of the definite questions which
will be taken up are: "Should the two
organizations be merged? Should the
joint society be more inclusive or
less exclusive than the term Christian
implies to most of us? Should a stu
dent fellowship of the Memorial
Church take the place of the two
associations here?"
