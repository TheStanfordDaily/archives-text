# Salvaging the "Y"
## 
### 
By stubbornly clinging to a creed or system in the face of opposition
and criticism, a man or group can justly be termed bigoted. But when
ai last the group will face the facts and open-mindedly make plans for
a re-organization of its system, credit must be given.
Throughout a large part of last quarter storms of protest were
thundered upon the Y.M.C.A. Objections to the organization's policies
came from many sources. At first the "Y" was prone to consider the
unfavorable comments as a minority opinion. But at last the realization
came. Now an investigating committee of the Young Men's Christian
Association has planned a general reorganization, and its recommenda
tions are up for consideration tomorrow at a mass meeting.
In the opinion of members of this committee the sanctioning of their
recommendations is practically assured. If this is done there shall no
longer be an organization on this campus officially known as the
Y.M.C.A. The Christian associations of men and women as they are at
present will merge, and form a new organization whose name has not
yet been decided upon.
An organization for "open fellowship of Stanford men and women
to associate themselves for intellectual, spiritual, and social growth, and
for service in the campus community," should be well received. There
is a group of students who have the time and desire for this type of
discussion and work. Certainly they have the privilege of organizing.
In one feature if will be a distinctive campus organization. Its
membership will be open to all those interested. And this cannot be said
of the vast majority of campus organizations who maintain the "closed
door" policy.
An opportunity to discuss religious matters under good leadership
with other students and faculty members should be greeted with en
thusiasm by many who were formerly uninterested in either the
Y.M.C.A. or Y.W.C.A. It is a forward step for the students interested
in this work.
