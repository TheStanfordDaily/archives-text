# A 						Unique Event
## 
### 
Saturday's concert by the combined glee clubs of Stanford and the
University of California will be a unique event in the history of the two
institutions. Besides being the first such program ever attempted, it is
probably also, as no evidence appears to the contrary, one of the
infrequent times when an official meeting between the two universities
is purely an exhibition.
Perhaps in times past such a unity in purpose between the opposite
sides of the bay would have been even more than an impossibility.
Usually each sees the other chiefly over on the wrong side of the
stadium. There is more than a mere gesture of friendliness in having
the glee clubs appear side by side on the concert stage.
The program to be presented should prove entirely interesting. It
is not hard to predict that numbers designed not so much to please but
to show the vocal mastery attained by the various members will be
absent. And at all events the work of both choruses should stand com
parison with any similar groups in the country, as Stanford's Warren D.
Allen and California's Leonard P>. McWhood are two foremost leaders
in the direction of university musical activities.
