# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### Don Gledhill 
For variety Cabbages will begin to
day with a POEM:
Fix up your hours to have plenty of
reading,
Try to forget that you're far in
arrears,
Guess who went out with the regis
trar's weeding,
Check up your guess when the bawl
out appears.
It won't be long now.
Speaking of this, the authorities
ought to give the boys and girls a
day off when the winter quarter bawl
out gets itself published. There is so
much to be seen. Did that hot number
flunk out of school? Who will be back
to play football next year? etc., etc.,
ad infinitum, plus personal references.
* * *
Time, the well-known news-maga
zine, gives Cabbages the following in
spiration :
WET
Amos Guggonwicz, 29, famous young
Irish hurdler, yesterday became in
ebriated in a high-class bootlegger's
joint and demanded value received for
his money. Greeted with laughs, he
picked up a flunky and hurled the
fellow through a plate-glass window.
Bottles flew —lights were doused. Gug

j genwicz rode off in the patrol -wagon, I
swearing vengeance ....
* * *
Poem in addition to the other one:
Whenever that I hear a guy
Say women are a fright
Upon the Stanford campus, then
I think Alberta's right.
See Friday's paper for the solution
to this intreegin enigma.
* * *
Here follows additional poetry yet,
j but of better quality:
Hooray the new Dumbarton bridge
j Will save the fellows bills
For gas & oil & wear & tear
And fifteen miles to Mills.
Prose transcription of the above
! masterpiece by Willie McCubbin, fifth
grade, Miss Smythe's room. (This ex
plains everything—Editor's note.)
"This inspiring poem tells of the
j construction at. large cost.of a bridge
l over San Francisco bay at Dumbarton
which will make it possible for young
men on the peninsula with its glorious
climate to economize on fuel and
lubrication items not to mention de
| preciation totals on their motor cars,
and to cut 15 miles from the long &
; arduous journey to Mills, which is a
i college or something with which
; Stanford holds minor atlialetic con-
] tests.

Poem in addition to the other one:
Whenever that I hear a guy
Say women are a fright
Upon the Stanford campus, then
I think Alberta's right.

Here follows additional poetry yet,
j but of better quality:
Hooray the new Dumbarton bridge
j Will save the fellows bills
For gas & oil & wear & tear
And fifteen miles to Mills.
Prose transcription of the above
! masterpiece by Willie McCubbin, fifth
grade, Miss Smythe's room. (This ex
plains everything—Editor's note.)
"This inspiring poem tells of the
j construction at. large cost.of a bridge
l over San Francisco bay at Dumbarton
which will make it possible for young
men on the peninsula with its glorious
climate to economize on fuel and
lubrication items not to mention de
| preciation totals on their motor cars,
and to cut 15 miles from the long &
; arduous journey to Mills, which is a
i college or something with which
; Stanford holds minor atlialetic con-
] tests.

Check up your guess when the bawl

It won't be long now.
Speaking of this, the authorities
ought to give the boys and girls a
day off when the winter quarter bawl
out gets itself published. There is so
much to be seen. Did that hot number
flunk out of school? Who will be back
to play football next year? etc., etc.,
ad infinitum, plus personal references.

Irish hurdler, yesterday became in

joint and demanded value received for
his money. Greeted with laughs, he
picked up a flunky and hurled the
fellow through a plate-glass window.
Bottles flew —lights were doused. Gug
