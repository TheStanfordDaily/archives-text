THE WORLD OF WILLIAM CLIS
SOLD. By H. G. Wells. 2 vols.
Do ran Co.
There probably will be a hundred and
one quarrels over the thousand and one
things of great interest in "The World of
William Clissold"—because this is one of
the most remarkable encyclopedias ever
graced by the name of a novel. If you
are tired when you sit down to read the
some eight hundred pages, it will be
much better to turn to some humbler
writer, whose tale, like the poems of
Longfellow, gushed from his heart.
There is no gush here—if you except
the gush of ideas. When it comes to
ideas there are probably more separate
concepts, adequately conceived and treat
ed, than are to be found among the leaves
of any novel in the long literary history
of the English people. On the title page
the author wrote: "A Novel at a New
Angle." Certainly there is no argument
there, either. The only problem arises
when the critic tries to find an angle
from which to observe this gigantic epic
of the mind.
The world as it appears to William
Clissold, wealthy and cultured British
financier; the unique philosphy of life
which he has painfully extracted from
living—is the most essential of all, the
promise of a better life for mankind.
This better life, concludes William
Clissold, is not to come as the result of
a revolution from the bottom, such as the
Socialists promised the world; no, the
revolution is to be one of mind, and since
mind is more widely diffused in the so
called upper levels of society, the revolu

tion must start at the top. The revolution
will simply amount to the absorption
gradually, of our primitive individualistic
urge into a collective Overmind. This
thing William Clissold himself sets out
to accomplish, when death cuts him short.
There, upon an epilogue ,Sir Richard
Clissold, his brother and one of the chief
characters in the book, ends the story.
If you have courage to read the book,
it will undoubtedly astound. In it, you
will be ready to believe, is considered
everything under the sun. Yet, after all
—encyclopedia though it is, it is still a
novel. The master art of one of the liv
ing masters of fiction has made it so.
Some salt and pepper paragraphs from
this book:
"Across the seas came Woodrow Wil
son, with that large gaunt face of his,
solemnable, inscrutable, bringing his
schoolboy essay in politics, his Fourteen
Points."
"Debt is not so bad a thing as death,
but it lies in the same direction. It is a
parallel road to frustration."
"But the law still keeps its moral ideas
in cold storage in the vaults of the Seven
teenth Century."
"For the first time in my life I realized
that pity for women which comes to all
decent men sooner or later—in spite of
our endless humiliations and subjuga
tions and the way we spoil our lives
through them."
