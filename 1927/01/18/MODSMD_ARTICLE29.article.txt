The Editor, Sir:
To the innocent observer (impar
tial, or otherwise), it seems illogical
that the Executive Committee should
grant to the Dramatic Council three
closed dates on Friday nights during
winter quarter. This is showing par
tiality to a particular organization and
ignoring the needs of other organiza
tions for open dates on those nights.
With the basketball games sched
uled for practically every Saturday
night during winter quarter, it would
seem that the fraternities and other
campus organizations should be given
an opportunity to have their dances
on Friday nights during the quarter
without interference from the Dra
matic Council. Two closed dates in a
quarter are plenty, but three are posi
tively an imposition, especially since
the Executive Committee cancelled
dates previously granted in order to
give the date to the Dramatic Council.
We submit that the Executive Com
mittee should consider the fact that
the Dramatic Council is not the only
organization on the campus entitled to
ronsideration, although the converse
seems to be true, as proven in times
past. â€”A.H.
