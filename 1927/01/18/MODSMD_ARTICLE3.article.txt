Nightly choruses of 865 loud
and harmonious voices, the larg
est concert group ever assem
bled at Stanford, are to be heard
regularly at present by all who
are brave or romantic enough to
venture near Lagunita after sun
set, states Walter Mills, attend
ant at the boathouse.
These concert artists who, it
should be added, are frogs, are
the only great attraction now at
Lagunita, as no daring navi
gators have as yet paddled forth
upon its chocolate-colored waters,
though the lake bottom is half
covered, and the muddy fluid has
a depth of five feet in places,
having reached the outlet valve.
The Stanford swimming pond
will not be completely full for at
least a month, says Mills, for
Searsville Lake has not yet over
flowed, but some of the twenty
canoes at the boathouse will
doubtless soon be seen in action,
despite the mud.
