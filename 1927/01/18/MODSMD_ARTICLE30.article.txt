The Editor. Sir:
The topic of this morning's editorial
is, to some thirty people, the most import
ant thing that has been written on re
cently. Weight basketball should never
have been removed from the awards plan.
Now, everyone should strive to revive
the sport. As a frosh I have always
heard the statement, "Athletics for all."

I Why, then, the inconsistency, especially
' on the part of the Board of Athlctic
j Control and one of our "prominent"
I coaches.
If something is done within a week it
! is possible that men interested in this
| sport may be able to play a few games
this season. It is a pity that action had
to he deferred to this time, thereby losing
| an entire season.
Hoping you retain your policy, I am,
One Who Would Like to Play.
