## A.S.S.U. President Appoints Thomas Coughran Senior Representative 
### 
Substitution of a graduate member
on the Executive Committee for the

tive suggestion made by the Constitu
tion Committee at its meeting last

mittee to take the place of Karl Doerr,

ticularly the weight basketball situa
tion. The question of managerial ap
pointment and selection was left to the

text.

group and the rights of the graduates
to participate in student affairs was
given by Robert Littler, chairman of
the committee, as the reason for the
suggested change in the personnel of

sion concerns a change in details of

following resolution:

students at the February election.
This last suggestion concerned par
ticularly the weight basketball situa
tion. The question of managerial ap
pointment and selection was left to the
By-Laws, and in Article I and II of
the Constitution were condensed and
minor changes were made in the con
text.
The size of the resident graduate
group and the rights of the graduates
to participate in student affairs was
given by Robert Littler, chairman of
the committee, as the reason for the
suggested change in the personnel of
the Executive Committee. This revi
sion concerns a change in details of
administration in pursuance of the
policy adopted by the committee in the
following resolution:
"RESOLVED, That this committee
understands its authority to extend
only to the recommendation of a re
vised constitution, with such changes
in the powers of officers and details
of administration as will make the
student government more consistent,
according to its present plan."

j basketball was brought up, and to

committee offers its services in help
ing to draw the amendments so that
j they will fit in with the reorganized
| constitution to be proposed."

mittee to take the place of Karl Doerr,
who was forced to resign because of a
heavy scholastic program.
