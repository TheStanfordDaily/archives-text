# REPORT OF Y.W.C.A. MEET AT MILWAUKEE MADE AT ROBLE CLUB
## Daily Schedule of Delegates Told; Discussion Groups Follow Lectures 
### 
A report of the Y.W.C.A. Conference
held at Milwaukee during the Christ
mas holidays was given by Margaret
Owen, one of Stanford's delegates,
last night at a meeting of Roble Club.
The topic of the convention was,
"What resources has' Jesus for life in
this world?" Two main notes were
struck continually through the con
vention. They were: our evident lack
of spirituality as contrasted to our
spiritual resources, and our indiffer
ence to the sadness around us.
There were about three thousand
delegates at the convention from col
leges all over the country. All dele
gates met at 9 o'clock every morning
for an address from some world-known
worker. Four cycles were considered
by these speakers: "Is God accessible
to. us?" "Impartial love," "the divine
possibility of our lives," and"The
Cross."
After the lectures the convention
met in discussion groups of fifty. At
the dose of the lectures, four students
gave their reactions to the convention,
and the next morning G. A. Studdert-
Kennedy, an eminent English social
worker gave the last address of the
convention.
Bruce Curry, who helped to organ
ize the convention, urged the dele
gates not to carry away too emotional
or evangelical a message, but to try
to get something from the convention
that could be kept all their lives, and
to influence others not so much by
preaching as by their manner of living.
