# ALLEN WILL PRESENT WAGNERIAN SCORES IN TODAY'S RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will play a program composed en
tirely of selections by Richard Wag
ner in his concert at the Memorial
Church beginning at 4:15 o'clock to
day.
Wagner (1813-1883), one of the ear
liest "moderns," created a stir with
the style in which his works were
written, although to the modern ear
they seem quite conservative.
Richard Wagner is generally re
garded as the greatest of all opera
composers. The numbers to be played
are all selections from Wagner's most
famous and popular operas. The
March, "Hail Bright Abode," from
Tannhauser," has a delightfully spir
ited melody that might well accom
pany the footsteps of a knightly pro
cession. The second number, the Pre
lude to Scene 2 of "Das Rheingold,"
is being played for the first time at
the organ recitals. It depicts the ris
ing of the sun on "Walhalle," the
castle of the Norse gods. The whole
prelude is based upon a single theme
that characterizes with rare beauty
the dignity and grandeur of the castle.
Walter's Prize Song from the "Meis
tersiuger," that is on the program,
has been described as the most beau
tiful eong ever written. The remain
ing three selections are from the
opera "Lohengrin." The Prelude is the
music of the Holy Grail, which promi
nently figures in this opera.
The selections in today's program,
representative of the composer's
scope, are the following:
March â€”Hail Bright Abode, from
"Tannhauser"
Prelude to Scene 11, "Das Rheingold"
Walter's Prize Song, "Die Meister
singer"
Prelude, Prayer of the King, and
Introduction to Act 111,
"Lohengrin"
