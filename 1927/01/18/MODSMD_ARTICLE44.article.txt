# POLICIES OF EUROPF THROUGH WAR PERIOD OUTLINED BY ROWELL

"The end of the World War came,
in effect, with Germany's entrance
into the League of Nations in Sep
tember 192G, and the putting into work
of the Locarno Treaties," declared
Chester H. Rowell, nationally known
critic of world affairs, in his lecture
yesterday to the class in Current In
ternational Politics.
"This was the culmination of a long
period of preparation," he said. "The
process of the foreign ministers' 'talk
ing out of the window' to the con
stituents back home has been the
chief obstacle to settlement. The offi
cial entry of Germany to the League
was exceedingly dramatic with Strese
niann'H speech and the welcome by
Briand for France on the floor of the
assembly."
The preparation, according to Row
ell, began with the tri-partite agree
ment between Clemenceau, Llovd-
George, and Wilson, in 1019, by which,
if France were wantonly invaded by
Germany, Great Britain and the
United States were to come to
France's aid. Needless to say, this was
not ratified by the American Senate.
From then on there were three
periods of policy. Until 1923 attempts
were made to substitute for the tri
partite agreement without the assist
ance of the United States. Coercive
methods were used in trying to force
Germany to pay reparations.
In 1924 the liberals came into power
in France and England in Herriot and
McDonald. They were devoted to
peace in general, said Rowell, but they
refused a western agreement for
peace in particular.
With the accession of the conserva
tives to power again a compromise
was effected in which regional agree
ments were made and tied up with
the League of Nations, these to be a
step along to a general policy for
peace.
These steps, Rowell pointed out,
reached their culmination at Locarno
in 1925 and at the two League assem
blies of 1926, at the second of which
Germany returned to the fellowship
of nations.
