# EXPENSES DOUBLE EACH DECADE AT STANFORD AT ONE TIME 300 DOLLARS SUFFICED FOR YEAR FIRST TUITION NOMINAL ONE: NOW LOOK AT IT!
## 
### 
Expenses of Stanford students have |
increased more than 300 per cent since
the University was founded in 1891. I
It now costs as much to attend the
institution for one quarter as it cost j
then to go for an entire year.
When the University was founded, j
tuition was free to all. Encina and j
Roble halls, which were managed by
the students on a co-operative basis, 1
charged twenty dollars a month for;
board and room, heat, light, and at
tendance, and students had to furnish
their own linen, blankets, and napkins.
Down in "Paly" and Mayfleld, good j
room qnd board, approved by the Uni- j
versity, could be obtained for from 1
eighteen to x twenty dollars a month. :
For the whole year expenses, exclu- i
sive of clothing and railway fares,
amounted to from $225 to $300.
H.C.L. Advances
In 1909, half way between then and j
now, expenses were slightly higher. ;
At this time an enormous tuition fee i
of twenty dollars a year was charged.
Moreover, residents of California were
exempted from all tuition fees. There j
were special fees for students in Law, j
Medicine, and Engineering. Labora
tory and syllabus fees ranged from 1
fifty cents to twenty-five dollars a |
semester.
Roble and Encina had raised their
rates somewhat. Twenty-seven dollars
a month was charged at Roble for 1
room, board, and accessories, but nap
kins were furnished the students. Liv
ing expenses in Palo Alto and College
Terrace had been raised to from twen
ty-five dollars to thirty-five dollars per
month. The i total expenses for the
year ran from $300 to $450.
At the present time, by the Informa- j
tion Bulletin just issued, student ex
penses are more than three times
what they were in early days. Tuition
for undergraduates is now eighty-five
dollars a quarter, or ninety-five dollars
including community fees. Laboratory
fees run from ten to twenty dollars a
quarter; books cost from fifteen to
thirty dollars a quarter; syllabus fees
average about ten dollars a quarter.
Ask Dad, He Knows
Living is much higher at the dormi

tories. The men's dormitories charge
from eighteen dollars and a half to
thirty-six dollars a quarter. Board
ranges from thirty to forty dollars a
month. At Roble Hall rooms are thirty
dollars and board eighty dollars a
quarter, except in summer quarter
when the prices are thirty-five and
ninety dollars, respectively. Room and
board in Palo Alto and Mayfield have
kept march with the rise in expenses;
rooms now cost what room an l board
used to cost in the first years of the
University.
Total expenses are now from $750
to $1200 a year. The maximum sum
named, $1200 a year, would have taken
a student of 1 §01 through four years
at the University, at the maximum
cost then; the minimum figure of $750
a year, would have taken him through
three years at the then minimum year
ly cost. The main increase has been
in tuition, which has developed from
nil to $255 a year. Living expenses
have also marched forward to tha ex
tent that room and board is no;v al
most five times as much as it was
when the University was founded.

In 1909, half way between then and j
now, expenses were slightly higher. ;
At this time an enormous tuition fee i
of twenty dollars a year was charged.
Moreover, residents of California were
exempted from all tuition fees. There j
were special fees for students in Law, j
Medicine, and Engineering. Labora
tory and syllabus fees ranged from 1
fifty cents to twenty-five dollars a |
semester.
Roble and Encina had raised their
rates somewhat. Twenty-seven dollars
a month was charged at Roble for 1
room, board, and accessories, but nap
kins were furnished the students. Liv
ing expenses in Palo Alto and College
Terrace had been raised to from twen
ty-five dollars to thirty-five dollars per
month. The i total expenses for the
year ran from $300 to $450.
At the present time, by the Informa- j
tion Bulletin just issued, student ex
penses are more than three times
what they were in early days. Tuition
for undergraduates is now eighty-five
dollars a quarter, or ninety-five dollars
including community fees. Laboratory
fees run from ten to twenty dollars a
quarter; books cost from fifteen to
thirty dollars a quarter; syllabus fees
average about ten dollars a quarter.
Ask Dad, He Knows
Living is much higher at the dormi

tories. The men's dormitories charge
from eighteen dollars and a half to
thirty-six dollars a quarter. Board
ranges from thirty to forty dollars a
month. At Roble Hall rooms are thirty
dollars and board eighty dollars a
quarter, except in summer quarter
when the prices are thirty-five and
ninety dollars, respectively. Room and
board in Palo Alto and Mayfield have
kept march with the rise in expenses;
rooms now cost what room an l board
used to cost in the first years of the
University.
Total expenses are now from $750
to $1200 a year. The maximum sum
named, $1200 a year, would have taken
a student of 1 §01 through four years
at the University, at the maximum
cost then; the minimum figure of $750
a year, would have taken him through
three years at the then minimum year
ly cost. The main increase has been
in tuition, which has developed from
nil to $255 a year. Living expenses
have also marched forward to tha ex
tent that room and board is no;v al
most five times as much as it was
when the University was founded.
Expenses of Stanford students have |
increased more than 300 per cent since
the University was founded in 1891. I
It now costs as much to attend the
institution for one quarter as it cost j
then to go for an entire year.
When the University was founded, j
tuition was free to all. Encina and j
Roble halls, which were managed by
the students on a co-operative basis, 1
charged twenty dollars a month for;
board and room, heat, light, and at
tendance, and students had to furnish
their own linen, blankets, and napkins.
Down in "Paly" and Mayfleld, good j
room qnd board, approved by the Uni- j
versity, could be obtained for from 1
eighteen to x twenty dollars a month. :
For the whole year expenses, exclu- i
sive of clothing and railway fares,
amounted to from $225 to $300.
