# RADIO INTERFERENCE DUE TO POWER LEAKS, PROFESSOR REPORTS
## Federal Telegraph Stations Also Cause Difficulty; Committee on Job 
### 
Radio interference, both on the
campus and in Palo Alto, is sufficient
ly serious as to call for definitely or
ganized action in the interest of over
corning it, says Professor W. F. Diet
rich in a report to the Palo Alto Cham
tier of Commerce on his recent in
vestigations in this field. Some of the
major disturbances are explained in
the report as follows:
"Power leaks are often responsible
for interference. A powerful buzz,
whose intermittent character has pre
vented me from following it very far
from my residence, is a 60-cycle hum,
probably caused by a power leak,
which has been traced to a line along
Mayfield avenue.
Telegraph Hinders
"Federal telegraph stations consti
tute another source of disturbance.
The Federal and other code stations
have been assigned a liberal set of
wave bands for their own exclusive
use. Yet in order to operate their
ntations they find it necessary to ap
propriate about half of the broadcast
bands that have been assigned to
radio broadcasters.
"Strong code signals are especially
prominent at 353 meters, 300 meters,
and about 240 meters. When we re
inember that approximately three
fourths of the radio broadcasting sta
tions in the United States and Canada
are operating on wave lengths below
"00 meters, we begin to realize the
(seriousness of the situation.
Remedy Suggested
"As one means of correcting the
situation I suggest that the radio deal
ers, Federal Telegraph Company, and
the Pacific Gas* & Electric Company
!>e encouraged to finance the cost of
employing a radio interference expert
■who will devote his entire time to the
discovery of sources of interference,
and make suitable recommendations
regarding the elimination of such dis
turbances."
