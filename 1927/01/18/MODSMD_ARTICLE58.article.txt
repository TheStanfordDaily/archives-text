# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Basketball, as almost everybody
knows, was deliberately invented and
j did not gradually evolve, as most
other games did. This great national
indoor pastime of America, though
only conceived in 1891, has spread to
all corners of the globe and is now
probably played by more people than
any other competitive sport. To bear
out that statement, let me quote from
j the sport pages of the New York Times
of Sunday, December 26, as follows:
"At a recent meeting of the officials
of the Joint Basketball Rules Commit
tee in this city, it was stated that
there is now a total of 15,000,000
persons playing basketball in this
country." As no one claims more than
j a sixth of that number for golf, tennis,
j or any other sport, it would seem that
' the cage game is the king of them all,
i indoors or out.
The father of basketball, Dr. James
Naismith, now a professor at the Uni
versity of Kansas, invented the game
when he was a teacher at Springfield
College, Mass. The worthy professor
had no idea, naturally, that some day

he'd be teaching this child of his brain
to a son of his own, or that the sport
he invented would be played in India,
China, Greece, South America, and
other foreign parts.

A game not unlike basketball was
played by the Maya Indians of Central
America over 750 years ago. At Chich
en Itza, in the Yucatan Peninsula,
there still stands a great ball court or
tlachtli field, where the natives used
to have their sport. The object of the
game was to drive a solid rubber ball
through a stone ring set twenty-four
feet above the level of the court at
each end of the field. The playing area
was about as large as our modern
football field, and if these Indians
played "tlachtli" anything like the
North American Indians used to play
lacrosse, why the modern game of
basketball is tame by comparison.

Basketball now ranks with ice
hockey as one of the fastest and most
thrilling of all games, and even Ameri
can football, the leader in popularity
and money-making power of all the
intercollegiate sports, is often called
"glorified basketball."


A Great Invention
