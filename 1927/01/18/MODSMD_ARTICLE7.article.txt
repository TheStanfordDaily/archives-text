ment of Uruguay, and to collect ma
terial for articles and for a book he

Since the late war, says Professor
Martin, the United States has become
stronger than Europe in the South
American countries. Not only has this
country surpassed Europe in the
amount of exports and imports, but
South America now looks to Wall
Street in place of to Lombard Street
for its government finances and loans.

South America, he visited Tacna and
Arica and he will speak of the situa
tion there in his lecture tomorrow

named Tello who has given a great
impetus to all archaeological work and
particularly to an investigation of the
civilization of the Incas. This museum
is connected with the University of
I San Marcos, the oldest university in
the New World, being established in
11551.
Professor Martin gave several lec
| tures at different South American uni
versities, 011 the development of his
torical studies in the United States,
and found South American scholars in
terested in the possibilities of research
in the Hoover War Library at Stau
ford.
