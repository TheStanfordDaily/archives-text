Herbert A. Klein was awarded the
January prize of $25 offered by the Illus
trated Review for the best article printed
in that issue, for his article, "Are Stu
dents Afraid of Music?" ,
He blames the traditional "rough" at
titude for much of the aversion of stu
dents towards good music. The true
rough must "avoid any show of emotion
as though it were the devil itself," says
Klein. As music offers "the greatest op
portunities for emotional experience of
any art, the "rough" tradition frowns
upon music and its appreciation.
The tendency to transfer the interest
from the music itself to some story or
material object represented by the melo
dy, also withholds from many its true
enjoyment.
