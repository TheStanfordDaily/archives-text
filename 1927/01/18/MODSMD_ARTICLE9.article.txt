Saturday night in the basketball pa
vilion at 8:15 o'clock may be sent to
P.O. Box 3006, Stanford University,
according to an announcement made
by Warren D. Allen, director of the
Stanford club.
The concert, which marks the suc
cessful conclusion of Director Allen's
long-continued efforts for a combina
tion concert of the glee clubs of Cali
fornia and Stanford, v/ill bring to
gether the largest male chorus that
has been heard in this vicinity for
some years.
Under the direction of Leonard B.
McWhood, recently arrived on the
Pacific Coast from Dartmouth, where
he has been one of the leaders of
university music in the East, the two
clubs will sing Flemming's "Integer
Vitae," while Allen will direct the com
bined groups in the rendition of
"Suomi's Song," a composition of Mair.
Program Impressive
A high point in the program will be
the singing of "A Dirge for Two
Veterans," by Gustav Hoist. The com
position is an impressive musical set
ting for Walt Whitman's poem of the
same name. Given, as it is, with an
accompaniment of trumpets, tubas,
! and drums, it is most impressive in
! effect.
Marie de Forest Emery, soprano,
j and Bolton White, violinist, will be
guest artists at the concert. Miss
Emery will sing three solo numbers,
while White is to play a series of
violin numbers and the obligato to
J Schubert's "Serenade," sung by the
Stanford Glee Club.
Critical Stage Reached
Warren D. Allen states that the con
i cert marks a critical stage in the de
| velopment of musical taste in the two
universities. For years glee clubs have
I striven to get away from the stero
typed form of entertainment, but have
been hindered by the negative attitude
of student bodies and alumni.
The program to be given Saturday
breaks away from the traditional glee
| club performance entirely, substituting
| numbers of real musical excellence
for the mediocre pieces of the past.
At the conclusion of the conccrt Phil
1 Larsen's Ramblers will play for a dance
' in the Pavilion. Tickets for the conccrt
and dance may be obtained for a dollar
each at the Old Union this afternoon
I
i nun 1 to 5 o'clock.
