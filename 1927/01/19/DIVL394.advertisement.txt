' ALERT minded men like the bond business because it pro
vides fresh interest from day to day and year after year.
Whether one is engaged in the buying or the selling end of
the bond business, his work gives an insight into the finan
cial side of industry, commerce and government, at home
and abroad.
Everything that happens in economic, legislative or polit
ical affairs may have its reflex in the bond business. This
means that a man must keep on the alert to know and under
stand what is happening. It is a stimulating requirement, that
keeps one out of mental ruts and stagnation.
The bond business requires hard work and rewards those
who give it. There is perhaps no more broadening business—
none that offers better opportunity for gaining a com prehensive
business education. Many fall short of substantial success in
the bond business through their own fault — not because the
opportunity is lacking.
Halsey, Stuart & Co. is interested in providing reliable
information to college men who are considering the bond busi
ness as a vocation—to help them make an intelligent decision.
