Five close games featured yesterday's
â€¢intramural basketball play, while the
sixth game was forfeited to Junipero
Serra by the Theta Delta Chi team. The
closest game of the day was fought out
by the Phi Gamma Delta and Kappa
Sigma squads in three extra periods,
with the Fijis winning out by a score of
20 to 19. Other winners were Sigma
Nu, Encina Basement, Encina 2W, and
Theta Xi.
The Phi Gamma Delta-Kappa Sigma
game started the play for the evening,
-with the Fijis taking the lead from the
start, and apparently outplaying the Kap
pa Sigs. The ability of Gregory and
Downing to sink foul shots in the first
half gave the victors six points while
six more were added by field goals. The
Kappa Sigma men were held to a single
field goal and two foul shots in the first
half, and at the end of the period, the
score stood, Phi Gamma Delta 12, Kappa
Sigma 4.
Second Half Close
However, the second half was a dif
ferent story. Coming back with a rush,
the Kappa Sigs crept up on the Fijis,
with Moore carrying the brunt of the at
tack. With a minute and a halt to go
before the end of the time period, New
kirk of the Kappa Sigma aggregation
sank a field goal and put his team in the
lead. A half minute later, however, Klotz
saved the day for the Pi ji s with a nice
goal from the side of the court, tieing
the score at 15 to 15.
In the first exera period one field goal
was added by both teams, and the score
stood 17 to 17, while in the next five
minutes of play neither team was able
to tally. By this time both teams were
thoroughly tired, but after a consultation
it was decided that the game would be
finished without any rest.
Immediately after the start of the last
period, Frank Wilton dropped a nice
year he revised his "Manual of Verti-!
brates," which is now being published
in its thirteenth edition.
