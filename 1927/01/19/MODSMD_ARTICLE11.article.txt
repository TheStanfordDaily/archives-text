### 
President Wilbur today sends the following message in rec
ognition of the seventy-sixth birthday of Dr. Jordan, Chancellor
emeritus:
"It must bring great happiness to a man to live long enough
to get the rewards of a good life well spent. David Starr Jordan
is living in the midst of the harvest which has come from years
of earnest work for mankind. Surrounded by affection and
admiration, looked up to as the elder scholar, Stanford Univer
sity greets him anew on his seventy-sixth birthday.
"He has seen our University grow from a few stone buildings
set out in a wheatfield dotted with spreading oaks into a great
institution with graduates in every land. From all parts of the
world these men and women are thinking of him today and of
the gratitude which they owe to him for his inspiration and
idealism.
"From them and from all Stanford people go to him the
heartiest greetings for a Happy Birthday. We hope that Provi
dence will grant us the benediction of David Starr Jordan's
wholesome presence for many years to come.
"RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
"President."

Douglas H. Campbell, professor of botany emeritus and
member of "the old guard," in speaking of Dr. Jordan, says:
"To those of us who have had the good fortune to be at
Stanford from the beginning, it is both interesting and gratify
ing to look back through these thirty-five years and see to how great an
extent the hopes of those early days have been realized.
"Not the least cause for congratulation is that we still have with us the
man who more than anyone else is responsible for the success of Stanford.
We all offer our good wishes to Dr. Jordan on his 76th birthday, and trust
there may be many more to come."

O. L. Elliot, another member of "the old guard" and registrar emeritus,
talks of him as follows:
"Today adds another notch to the long record of Dr. Jordan's life. We
who are of his generation, lagging a little behind, are glad to think over
again the events and achievements of so fruitful a career. More particularly
one is Inclined to dwell upon the personal qualities—the buoyancy, the eager
ness, the sturdiness, the idealism, the unconquerable optimism, the vision—
which have made high achievement possible and which have endeared Dr.
Jordan to the thousands who have known him as etacher and friend.
"Dr. Jordan has happily combined the scientific outlook with the poetic
in-look. Sometimes he has written, of fishes, let us say, with hte 'poetic
in-look. Sometimes he has written of fishes, let us say, with the poetic
fact exactness of the investigator; sometimes of goblins and fairies with the
inspired imagination of the born story-teller; sometimes with gentle sarcasm,
uncovering the follies and absurdities of ignorance and credulity; sometimes
as prophet, pointing out dangers and pitfalls and recalling us all sharply to
ideals and visions we are in danger of losing. It is a long story, rich in
achievement, though not without its heartbreaks; but if to be honored greatly,
to be surrounded with the love and affection of an innumerable company, be
the durable satisfactions of life, Dr. Jordan has that in abundance.
"But one does not need to dwell upon the past overmuch. Dr. Jordan is
yet in harness, still keeping step. In speech and writing, he still wields
the sword of the spirit, rightly dividing the word of truth to a mixed-up, often
bewildered, often bedevilled world. It matters not if the world does not
seem to want to be reformed, preferring the dullness and east of Main Street.
Dr. Jordan hammers on. And there is the younger group who, as all the
college generations before Jhem have done, listen to his voice and dream
dreams and see visions which shall stay with them to the end of their days.
"Salutations to one who is first and greatest on our Stanford roll. Con
gratulations on the auspicious beginning of a new year, with the heartfelt
wish that its fruit may be sweet to the taste and richly abundant."
