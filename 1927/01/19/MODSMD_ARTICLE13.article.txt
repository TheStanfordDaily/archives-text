# South American Relations Vital Problem--Martin
## 
### 
"Intelligent South Americans are
watching very closely our policy toward
Latin-America; our enemies are exploit
ing every false move we make; anil be
cause certain of these countries will some
day rise to first-class powers, the biggest
single problem facing our government
today is that of placing our relations
with South America on a basis of mu
tual esteem."
With these words Professor Percy A.
Martin summed up his opinion of pres
ent South American-United States rela
tions, given last night in a talk on "Fugi
tive Impressions of the Near East and
South America," before a capacity audi
ence in the Little Theater.
U.S. Culture Needed
In speaking about the attitude of South
American countries toward the United
States, Martin said that this country is
regarded as supplying only "money, mo
vies, and automobiles," and that we
should also send, in addition to uncen
sored movies which give an extraordi
nary impression of our Far West and of
our marriage difficulties, lecturers or
other representatives of our cultural life.
In regard to the Tacna-Arica dispute, he
said that these two principalities, no
larger than a fourth-class county in Cali
fornia, have distorted the relations be
tween Peru and the United States all out
of proportion to their importance.
Uruguay Promising
Martin touched upon the economic and
political conditions as he found them in
Brazil, Uraguay, Argentina, and Chile.
He said that in Brazil the memory of
the late Dr. Branner is revered as is that
of no other North American; there, too,
political progress is not commensurate
with economic progress. Uraguay he
found the most promising country on the
continent. In his words, "Uraguay is go
ing to p!av an interesting part in the in
ternational politics of South America;
it has the confidence of the other coun
tries and will play the role of helpful
mediator. The people are firm believers
in the theory and practice of democracy;
it is commendable that they have not hesi
tated to break with tradition and prece
dent in establishing their unique type of
government, comparable only to that of
Switzerland."
New Culture Created
Argentines, Martin finds, are now busy
creating their own culture, although their
politics are in a curious condition. They
have adopted our seminar method of in
vestigation in regard to historical re
search, and are now writing South Amer
ican history with strictest observance of
truth, mainly through a Faculty of Philo
sophy and Letters which is a distinct
departure from usual South American
types of education. He also said that
the future of Chile looks less bright than
that of Argentina and Brazil, mainly be
cause of the bad economic situation
caused by the recent increase in unem
ployment. There is, too, a decided gulf
between upper and lower classes in Chile
which exists nowhere else in South
America.
Zionest Movement
In his one and a half years of travel,
Martin visited also the Near East and
Europe, but spoke only briefly of his
impressions there. However, he men
tioned particularly the reforms which
the British have introduced, with the co
operation of the Zionists, into Palestine.
These include railroads, highways,
schools, and a general economic renais
sance.
Touching upon the Zionist movement,
Martin explained its purpose as being
ultimately the formation of a Jewish
state, but at present the "creation of ne
cessary conditions under which Jewish
genius could bear its finest fruits." The
first step toward this goal has been the
establishment of Mt. Scopas University,
where Jewish research is being carried
on and the Hebrew language being re
established as a living tongue.
