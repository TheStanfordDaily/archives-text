In a birthday message to the
students and members of the
Stanford faculties and his other
friends in the community, Dr.
Jordan says:
"Stanford boys and girls have
been very kind to me—very
loyal, too —during the last thirty
five years. In greeting to those
who tread the Quad today I ven
ture to repeat myself in three
assertions of educational faith.
"The whole of your life must
be spent in your own company
and only the educated man is
good company to himself.
"Wisdom is knowing what to
do next; virtue is doing it.

"The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows whither he is
going." —David Starr Jordan.
Coming to Stanford in 1891 as the Institution's first president, Dr. Jordan
has devoted his time since then to its development. Carrying through in the

>dark days following Senator Stanford's
death he brought the University to a
sound position.
Becomes Chancellor
In 1913 he became chancellor, but
resigned in 1916 to become chancellor
emeritus, being followed by Dr. John
Casper Branner as the second presi
dent of Stanford.
Dr. Jordan was born in Gainesville,
New York, on January 19, 1851. He
graduated from Cornell in 1872, the
only man who ever received a mas
ter's degree from that university upon
completion of an undergraduate
course. In 1879 he became professor
of zoology at the University of Indiana
and served as its president from 1885
until he came to Stanford.
His contributions to science have
been many. He is a famous ichthyolo
gist, and a prominent author of hooks
on genetics, economics, and histories
of internationalism. During the past


Dr. Jordan
I shot through the hoop from beneath the
! basket, putting the Kappa Sigs in the
! lead. Moore fouled Miller, and the lat-
I ter added one point to the Fiji total. At
| this point both teams strengthened their
I defense, and it was not until Klotz was
! fouled by Newkirk that the Fijis were
given their opportunity to win. With two
points needed to win, Klotz made per
fect shots out of both, his foul tries, and
fifteen seconds later the final gun was
fired, the final score being 20 to 19.
Following the Fiji battle, the Theta Xi
and Encina 4E teams put up a hotly con
tested battle, with the fraternity men
winning out in the last minute of play.
At half time the score was tied at 7 to 7.
The lead then see-sawed back and forth,
with Anderson putting in the winning tal
ly for Theta Xi. Gilbert and Cordry
played nice ball for the losing team.
Like the Fijis in the preceding contest,
the Encina team used no substitutes, and
although the Theta Xi men came out on
top, the Encina boys followed the ball
and played a steadier game.
In the first game of the afternoon, the
Sigma Nu team exhibited great determi
nation and fight in its struggle with Kap
pa Alpha, and came from behind to win
14-10. At half time the K.A. outfit
thought their 8-2 lead would carry them
through to victory, Yoakum's two bas
kets from mid-floor having changed the
complexion of filings. Ernie Renzel got
his shooting eye in the second period,
however, and in a few minutes the score
was tied at 9-all. At this point Kenneth
Doyle looped the ball through the hoop
fro mthe sideline, and from then on
there was no question as to the outcome.
Renzel was high point man with six
tallies, while Davis and Yoakum did
honors for the losers. The game was
frequently punctuated with free throws,
Umpire Frank Harold having called 15.
Encina Basement played smooth bas
ketball to win from Phi Kappa Sigma,
19-13. Stewart and Northrup, forwards
on the winning team, were outstanding.
The former is credited with 10 of his
team's 19 points, and Northrup brought
in 5.
The lead was with Encina throughout
the game, although the Phi Kaps threat
ened in a last minute rally. Edmonds,
Evans, and Saunders were the chief con
tributors to Phi Kap score, while Rae
played an excellent floor game as run
ning guard.
El Tigre Downed
At 6:55 o'clock last night freshmen
from the second wing of Encina trailed
off the floor with a 21-16 victory over El
Tigre to their credit. Hertzell, Allendorf,
and Marx were the handy men with the
sphere for Encilia.
Today's games are as follows:
Delta Chi vs. Phi Sigma Kappa, 4:15;
Phi Kappa Psi vs. Branner I, 4:50; Se
quoia vs. Encina 3W, 5:25; Sequoia II
vs. Alpha Sigma Phi, 7:15; El Toro vs.
Alpha Delta Phi, 7:50; Encina 2E vs.
Zcta Psi, 8 :25.

14-10. At half time the K.A. outfit
thought their 8-2 lead would carry them
through to victory, Yoakum's two bas
kets from mid-floor having changed the
complexion of filings. Ernie Renzel got
his shooting eye in the second period,
however, and in a few minutes the score
was tied at 9-all. At this point Kenneth
Doyle looped the ball through the hoop
fro mthe sideline, and from then on
there was no question as to the outcome.
Renzel was high point man with six
tallies, while Davis and Yoakum did
honors for the losers. The game was
frequently punctuated with free throws,
Umpire Frank Harold having called 15.
Encina Basement played smooth bas
ketball to win from Phi Kappa Sigma,
19-13. Stewart and Northrup, forwards
on the winning team, were outstanding.
The former is credited with 10 of his
team's 19 points, and Northrup brought
in 5.
The lead was with Encina throughout
the game, although the Phi Kaps threat
ened in a last minute rally. Edmonds,
Evans, and Saunders were the chief con
tributors to Phi Kap score, while Rae
played an excellent floor game as run
ning guard.
El Tigre Downed
At 6:55 o'clock last night freshmen
from the second wing of Encina trailed
off the floor with a 21-16 victory over El
Tigre to their credit. Hertzell, Allendorf,
and Marx were the handy men with the
sphere for Encilia.
Today's games are as follows:
Delta Chi vs. Phi Sigma Kappa, 4:15;
Phi Kappa Psi vs. Branner I, 4:50; Se

Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor emeritus of Stanford University, is
celebrating his seventy-sixth birthday quietly today, having only an informal
reception this evening at his home for "the old guard," a small group of
professors who came to Stanford tlie year of its inauguration.
Dr. Jordan, who is world-famous as an educator, scientist, and advocate

of world peace, has continued
his active life this year, devot
ing the majority of his time to
writing and studying, which ac
tivities he previously found dif
ficult to fit into his busy pro
gram.

In a birthday message to the
students and members of the
Stanford faculties and his other
friends in the community, Dr.
Jordan says:
"Stanford boys and girls have
been very kind to me—very
loyal, too —during the last thirty
five years. In greeting to those
who tread the Quad today I ven
ture to repeat myself in three
assertions of educational faith.
"The whole of your life must
be spent in your own company
and only the educated man is
good company to himself.
"Wisdom is knowing what to
do next; virtue is doing it.

"The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows whither he is
going." —David Starr Jordan.
Coming to Stanford in 1891 as the Institution's first president, Dr. Jordan
has devoted his time since then to its development. Carrying through in the

>dark days following Senator Stanford's
death he brought the University to a
sound position.
Becomes Chancellor
In 1913 he became chancellor, but
resigned in 1916 to become chancellor
emeritus, being followed by Dr. John
Casper Branner as the second presi
dent of Stanford.
Dr. Jordan was born in Gainesville,
New York, on January 19, 1851. He
graduated from Cornell in 1872, the
only man who ever received a mas
ter's degree from that university upon
completion of an undergraduate
course. In 1879 he became professor
of zoology at the University of Indiana
and served as its president from 1885
until he came to Stanford.
His contributions to science have
been many. He is a famous ichthyolo
gist, and a prominent author of hooks
on genetics, economics, and histories
of internationalism. During the past

I shot through the hoop from beneath the

! lead. Moore fouled Miller, and the lat-
I ter added one point to the Fiji total. At
| this point both teams strengthened their
I defense, and it was not until Klotz was
! fouled by Newkirk that the Fijis were
given their opportunity to win. With two
points needed to win, Klotz made per
fect shots out of both, his foul tries, and
fifteen seconds later the final gun was
fired, the final score being 20 to 19.
Following the Fiji battle, the Theta Xi
and Encina 4E teams put up a hotly con
tested battle, with the fraternity men
winning out in the last minute of play.
At half time the score was tied at 7 to 7.
The lead then see-sawed back and forth,
with Anderson putting in the winning tal
ly for Theta Xi. Gilbert and Cordry
played nice ball for the losing team.
Like the Fijis in the preceding contest,
the Encina team used no substitutes, and
although the Theta Xi men came out on
top, the Encina boys followed the ball
and played a steadier game.

New York, on January 19, 1851. He
graduated from Cornell in 1872, the
only man who ever received a mas
ter's degree from that university upon
completion of an undergraduate
course. In 1879 he became professor
of zoology at the University of Indiana
and served as its president from 1885
until he came to Stanford.
His contributions to science have
been many. He is a famous ichthyolo
gist, and a prominent author of hooks
on genetics, economics, and histories
of internationalism. During the past

I shot through the hoop from beneath the
! basket, putting the Kappa Sigs in the
! lead. Moore fouled Miller, and the lat-
I ter added one point to the Fiji total. At
| this point both teams strengthened their
I defense, and it was not until Klotz was
! fouled by Newkirk that the Fijis were
given their opportunity to win. With two
points needed to win, Klotz made per
fect shots out of both, his foul tries, and
fifteen seconds later the final gun was
fired, the final score being 20 to 19.
Following the Fiji battle, the Theta Xi
and Encina 4E teams put up a hotly con
tested battle, with the fraternity men
winning out in the last minute of play.
At half time the score was tied at 7 to 7.
The lead then see-sawed back and forth,
with Anderson putting in the winning tal
ly for Theta Xi. Gilbert and Cordry
played nice ball for the losing team.
Like the Fijis in the preceding contest,
the Encina team used no substitutes, and
although the Theta Xi men came out on
top, the Encina boys followed the ball
and played a steadier game.
In the first game of the afternoon, the
Sigma Nu team exhibited great determi
nation and fight in its struggle with Kap
pa Alpha, and came from behind to win
14-10. At half time the K.A. outfit
thought their 8-2 lead would carry them
through to victory, Yoakum's two bas
kets from mid-floor having changed the
complexion of filings. Ernie Renzel got
his shooting eye in the second period,
however, and in a few minutes the score
was tied at 9-all. At this point Kenneth
Doyle looped the ball through the hoop
fro mthe sideline, and from then on
there was no question as to the outcome.
Renzel was high point man with six
tallies, while Davis and Yoakum did
honors for the losers. The game was
frequently punctuated with free throws,
Umpire Frank Harold having called 15.
Encina Basement played smooth bas
ketball to win from Phi Kappa Sigma,
19-13. Stewart and Northrup, forwards
on the winning team, were outstanding.
The former is credited with 10 of his
team's 19 points, and Northrup brought
in 5.
The lead was with Encina throughout
the game, although the Phi Kaps threat
ened in a last minute rally. Edmonds,
Evans, and Saunders were the chief con
tributors to Phi Kap score, while Rae
played an excellent floor game as run
ning guard.
El Tigre Downed
At 6:55 o'clock last night freshmen
from the second wing of Encina trailed
off the floor with a 21-16 victory over El
Tigre to their credit. Hertzell, Allendorf,
and Marx were the handy men with the
sphere for Encilia.
Today's games are as follows:
Delta Chi vs. Phi Sigma Kappa, 4:15;
Phi Kappa Psi vs. Branner I, 4:50; Se
quoia vs. Encina 3W, 5:25; Sequoia II
vs. Alpha Sigma Phi, 7:15; El Toro vs.
Alpha Delta Phi, 7:50; Encina 2E vs.
Zcta Psi, 8 :25.

who tread the Quad today I ven
ture to repeat myself in three
assertions of educational faith.
