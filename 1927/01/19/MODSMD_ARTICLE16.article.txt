In a birthday message to the
students and members of the
Stanford faculties and his other
friends in the community, Dr.
Jordan says:
"Stanford boys and girls have
been very kind to me—very
loyal, too —during the last thirty
five years. In greeting to those
who tread the Quad today I ven
ture to repeat myself in three
assertions of educational faith.
"The whole of your life must
be spent in your own company
and only the educated man is
good company to himself.
"Wisdom is knowing what to
do next; virtue is doing it.

"The world turns aside to let any man pass who knows whither he is
going." —David Starr Jordan.
Coming to Stanford in 1891 as the Institution's first president, Dr. Jordan
has devoted his time since then to its development. Carrying through in the

>dark days following Senator Stanford's
death he brought the University to a
sound position.
Becomes Chancellor
In 1913 he became chancellor, but
resigned in 1916 to become chancellor
emeritus, being followed by Dr. John
Casper Branner as the second presi
dent of Stanford.
Dr. Jordan was born in Gainesville,
New York, on January 19, 1851. He
graduated from Cornell in 1872, the

ter's degree from that university upon
completion of an undergraduate
course. In 1879 he became professor
of zoology at the University of Indiana
and served as its president from 1885
until he came to Stanford.

been many. He is a famous ichthyolo
