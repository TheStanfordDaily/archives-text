# Stanford's Tribute
## 
### 
For those strong souls to whom it has been given to push back the
frontiers of men, their achievements are their own sufficient reward.
The inevitable tribute of their fellows can never be to them as much as
the realization of those ideals and principles for which they have given
of their best.
Stanford University with its rich heritage of tradition and ideals is
a worthy monument to such a pioneer.
David Starr Jordan, who has today come to his seventy-sixth birth
day, may count his goal well reached. The value of material achieve
ments, many and worthwhile as they have been, are not the most sig
nificant debt Stanford owes this able captain. I lis wise counsel, careful
guidance, and broad sympathies have left their stamp even more in
delibly in the strong and abiding spirit of those principles which he has
inculcated through his own genius. This is our greatest wealth: this is
his truest gift.
It is Stanford's privilege to prove her gratitude, not in words, but in
the preservation through worthy achievement of those ideals for which
we are so greatly indebted.
