"CRADLE SNATCHERS" at
the Wilkes. A splendid farce, with
an irresistible hurricane of wit
and humor which ha 3 made it so
popular in the past year. One of
the best comedian to be shown in
San Francisco for a great while.
"MAGDA" at the Curran, star
ring Bertha Kalich. Her engage
ment in San Francisco euds this
Saturday night.
"THE RIDDLE WOMAN" at
the Curran. Last times at today's
matinee and evening perform
ance. Bertha Kalich plays the
leading role.
"THE HOME TOWNERS" at
the Alcazar. George Cohan's live
ly farce is now in its fifth week.
"THE LITTLE SPITFIRE" at
the President. A comedy that has
gone all the way to New York
from San Francisco because of
its great popularity. It is now
playing before large crowds in
the Atlantic metropolis.
MIKAIL MORDKIN and his
Russian Ballet at the Columbia.
This great Russian ballet dancer
has come to San Francisco with
a fine supporting cast and is now
playing before appreciative audi
ences at every performance.

Paying a wide-eyed homage to
Mikail Mordkin and his world-famed
Russian ballet with a full house on !
artists, San Francisco greeted this)
the opening night. The posturing ;
Mordkin triumphs throughout the '
show, depicting different characters
with tremendous dramatic fervor.
Mordkin's miraculous poise and com- j
pletely co-ordinating movement ex-!
presses his scenes with more power 1
than Forbes-Robertson could have
mustered for Hamlet's farewell or
Caruso for Leoncavallo's "La comme
dia e finita." «
Vera Nemtchinova and Hilda But

sova are subjects for interesting con-1
trast. Nemtchinova has the spark of
greatness. Certain sharpness of move-!
ment, dash and verve makes her pre
eminent. La of the curves and j
ripples delights her parts especially in
the "Seagull." But I am constrained to [
vote for Nemtchinova's art. Nemtchi
nova is to Butsova as Clara Bow is !
to Mary Pickford. Pierre Vladimiroff, '
the greyhound of the troupe, is an- i
other favorite. The minor ballerinas j
have their chances in bits of almost j
vaudeville character.
The elaborateness the perform-!
ance depends upon the gorgeous cos-!
tumes, and the great scenic effects I
round out one of the greatest ballets
that has ever come to San Francieco
in years. As a whole, the program is
very popular in appeal and universally
intelligible. And, quite unavoidably i
the applause waxed ovational and the
postperformance comments were rap- j
turous.

There comes interesting echoes of
the play, "The Little Spitfire," which
is doing very well on Broadway. It
has been welcomed in that city with
no little acclaim and patronage, al
though the success of the comedy here
has indicated that it would attract on
a large score.
* * *
A new attraction looms up for the
week beyond this. There will be the
screen version by William Fox of the !
startling war comedy, "What Price
Glory," that was so successful in San
Francisco about a year ago. The Cur
ran is substituting this for Bertha
Kalich in "Magda." The week after
that, the Columbia has booked "Loose
Ankles," another comedy which has
hit the mark in the East. The same
week the Wilkes has scheduled "Tip-
Toes," a musical comedy fresh from
its success on Broadway which com
bines virtue and decency with humor
and melody.
