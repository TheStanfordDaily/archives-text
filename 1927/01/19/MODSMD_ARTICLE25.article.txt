The Editor, Sir:
"Who gets the money for the regis
tration of football tickets when the
applications are not filled and there
fore are neither mailed nor regis
tered?" was the trenchant beginning
of a letter which appeared in the
Daily on the opening day of this quar
ter. As an interested reader I have
watched the campus opinion column
from day to day, believing that the
Board of Athletic Control would surely
accede to the request of the writer of
that letter and tell him whether the
twenty cents —which it returned to
him when he asked for it —had been
"kept for some good reason, whether
it was kept through error, or whether
it was just a bit of extra small change
in someone's pocket." No reply from
the Board of Athletic control has ap
peared, and since the purpose of the
cumulative twenty-cent rakeoff from
unfilled nppllrations remains as ob
scure as ever, I, too, would like to
f'ekte a similar experience and put
some questions up to the Board.
In my case the Board kept forty
cents, instead of twenty cents, which
properly belonged to me, for I had
sent them two application blanks
which were not filled. One of these
was for a ticket under classification f>,
which the Board was unable to fill;
and one was for the alumni classifica
tion, which I cancelled myself, because
I believed I could get better tickets
as a graduate student than as an
alumnus. I went to the office of the
Board to inquire about the matter,
and they gave me my forty cents when

j T asked for it. I appreciate the fact
jthat they did this, but at the same
j time this incident, and the one related
| by the writer of an earlier letter, puts
| the Board in a very peculiar position.
|To give twenty and forty cents re
spectively to two students who had
come to the conclusion that they had
been "gyped" by these amounts is an
acknowledgment that the claims were
| just. It follows that the Board now
holds in its funds an unknown aggre
gate of twenty-cent rakeoffs which are
Ihe legitimate property of other Big
Game applicants whose claims are as
I just as mine.
i
I tried to put this logic up to the
young fellow who gave me my forty
| cents at the Board office. "It costs a
| lot to run the office," was his ex
: planation. "You said you cancelled
two of these tickets yourself. Twenty
' cents wouldn't more than cover the 1
i bookkeeping your cancellation re
i quired." "Does that mean," I asked,
' him, "that when you cancel your ap
plication yourself the Board keeps the
! twenty cents to pay them for the trou
ble, but that when the Board is unable
to fill your application it makes a com
plete refund —twenty ccnts and all?"j
I "Yes," said the obliging young fellow.
I "Then how does it happen that when I
! had both a cancelled and an unfilled
I application, my twenty-cent registra
tion fee was kept in both instances?"
I inquired.
The young man did not answer. Will
I the Board of Athletic Control plense
| do so? —"Diogenes." |

sent them two application blanks
which were not filled. One of these
was for a ticket under classification f>,
which the Board was unable to fill;
and one was for the alumni classifica
tion, which I cancelled myself, because
I believed I could get better tickets
as a graduate student than as an
alumnus. I went to the office of the
Board to inquire about the matter,
and they gave me my forty cents when

j T asked for it. I appreciate the fact
jthat they did this, but at the same
j time this incident, and the one related

| the Board in a very peculiar position.
|To give twenty and forty cents re
spectively to two students who had
come to the conclusion that they had
been "gyped" by these amounts is an
acknowledgment that the claims were

holds in its funds an unknown aggre
gate of twenty-cent rakeoffs which are
Ihe legitimate property of other Big
Game applicants whose claims are as
I just as mine.
i
I tried to put this logic up to the
young fellow who gave me my forty
| cents at the Board office. "It costs a
| lot to run the office," was his ex
: planation. "You said you cancelled
two of these tickets yourself. Twenty
' cents wouldn't more than cover the 1
i bookkeeping your cancellation re
i quired." "Does that mean," I asked,
' him, "that when you cancel your ap
plication yourself the Board keeps the
! twenty cents to pay them for the trou
ble, but that when the Board is unable
to fill your application it makes a com
plete refund —twenty ccnts and all?"j
I "Yes," said the obliging young fellow.
I "Then how does it happen that when I
! had both a cancelled and an unfilled
I application, my twenty-cent registra
tion fee was kept in both instances?"
I inquired.
The young man did not answer. Will
I the Board of Athletic Control plense

The Editor, Sir:
"Who gets the money for the regis
tration of football tickets when the
applications are not filled and there
fore are neither mailed nor regis
tered?" was the trenchant beginning
of a letter which appeared in the
Daily on the opening day of this quar
ter. As an interested reader I have
watched the campus opinion column
from day to day, believing that the
Board of Athletic Control would surely
accede to the request of the writer of
that letter and tell him whether the
twenty cents —which it returned to
him when he asked for it —had been
"kept for some good reason, whether
it was kept through error, or whether
it was just a bit of extra small change
in someone's pocket." No reply from
the Board of Athletic control has ap
peared, and since the purpose of the
cumulative twenty-cent rakeoff from
unfilled nppllrations remains as ob
scure as ever, I, too, would like to
f'ekte a similar experience and put
some questions up to the Board.
In my case the Board kept forty
cents, instead of twenty cents, which
properly belonged to me, for I had
sent them two application blanks
