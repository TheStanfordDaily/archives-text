Stanford-Alabama game.
The full text of the letter is as
follows;
"I want to write you at this time to
express to you and the other members
of the Stanford Athletic Management
our appreciation of the kind and con
siderate treatment which we received
at the hands of the Stanford people
while in California. I appreciate very
much the courtesy which you yourself
showed us, and especially in your arti
cle which you wrote for the news
papers in regard to our game. Your
article was most favorably commented
on by the part of people from the
South, particularly the southern news

paper men. There was also a marked
difference in the attitude which was
exhibited toward Alabama on the part
of Stanford people this year and the
Washington people last yqar. We feel
that we have you to thank for this.
"We also feel that we should like to
tell you the great impression which
your football team made upon the
Alabama people. Practically everyone
agreed it was the best football team
they had ever seen. We frankly feel
that your team was better than ours
and that the only thing which made
it possible for our team to tie the
game was the great determination and
courage of the Alabama players. We
all have a wholesoirje respect and
highest regard for the Stanford peo
ple and the Stanford football team.
"With kindest personal regards to
you, I am,
"Sincerely yours,
(Signed): "Wallace Wade."
