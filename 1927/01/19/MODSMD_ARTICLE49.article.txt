# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The announcement that "Big Bill"
Tilden would not sail for France this
week to play in the Riviera tennis
tournaments was not only a great dis
appointment to the merchants of the
famous "Cote d'Azur," who were all
pepped up over the thought of the
crowds that long, lean William was
sure to draw, but to this cartoonist as
well, who looked forward with intense
interest to a series of battles between
Tilden and the Three Musketeers of
France —LaCoste, Borotra, and Cochet
—during the coming months.
But we can all cheer up, because Big
Bill has not abandoned his idea of
playing in Europe, only postponed it;
and he will be a member of the United
States team which will probably sail
in May to compete in France and Eng
land. Vincent Richards and Howard
Kinsey composed the American men's
team in 1926.
After seeing Tilden lose to Cochet
in their memorable match at Forest
Hills last September, one cannot but
wish him the best of success in his
"come-back" campaign. For Big Bill
was never greater in victory than he
was in defeat that day, as, In spite of
a lame knee —which really was lame —
he gave his utmost to win the national

title for the seventh year in succes
sion. My hunch is that Tilden will not
only round into tip-top shape, but that
he will win at least two of the three
biggest tournaments of the year: the
French hardcourt championship, the
Wimbledon tournament, and the
United States championship.
And if he does, what then? Will he
be content and retire to spend the
rest of his time on the stage that he
loves so well, or will he want to go
on and on winning tennis victories,
until his lean shanks will no longer
carry h.im about the courts, and leave
a record of national championships
won that far exceeds that of Dick
Sears and Bill Larned?
Or will he turn professional? Many
think that he would have joined C. C.
Pyle's troupe of traveling racket
wielders last year, had he not lost
his title. Rumor hath it that Tilden
did his best to induce Pyle to take
him along last fall, and that it was
not a disagreement over money mat
ters that prevented Big Bill's turning
pro. Pyle knew, so "one who knows"
told me, that he could never safely
handle two such temperamental stars
as Tilden and Lenglen on one tour,
and so turned a deaf ear to Bill's pleas.


Can He Come Back?
