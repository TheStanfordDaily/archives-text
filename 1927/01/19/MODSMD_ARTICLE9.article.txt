# "Y" DISCUSSION SCHEDULED ON MERGER PLANS
## Open Forum Will Consider Reorganization Report Of Committee PROGRAM IS OUTLINED Experimental Draft Worked Out to Meet Needs of Campus 
### 
Plans for the reorganization and merg
ing of the YMCA and YWCA have been
drawn up by the committee appointed
for that purpose, and will be presented
for revision and approval at the open
forum of both organizations which will
be held tonight at 7:15 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse.
The committee has outlined a program
for the new society which it believes tal
lies most closely with the sugestions iven
at the week-end conference a short time
ago, and which it says meets the needs
of the campus community for such an
organization. Tlif whole thing is under
taken as an experiment, and its continu
ation will, the committee says, depend
upon its success and upon its approval
by interested members. A name has not
been as yet selected for the merged so
cities, and a more definite financial and
organization status will be discussed at
the meeting.
The plan drawn up states that it is to
be an open fellowship of Stanford men
and women who associate themselves for
intellectual, spiritual and social growth
and service in the campus community,
affording an opportunity for group dis
covery of personal and social values.
Such opportunity will be given by dis
cussion groups on the campus and at
week-end retreats, and by joint meetings
with members of the faculty.
Such activities as work at the Con
valescent Home and boys' work in Palo
Alto will be carried on by members of
the organization.
