# WILBUR MS ON UNIVERSITY LIFE IN ORIENT
## Stanford Head Is Guest of Pekin Union Medical College Faculty ASSEMBLY HELD AT 10 President to Tell of Visits To Research Institutes And Colleges 
### 
College life in the Orient will be
compared with that of American uni
versities in the A.S.S.U. assembly to
day, when Dr. Wilbur will address
the student body on the subject, "Ob
servations in the Orient." The assem
bly will be held at 10 o'clock.
Dr. Wilbur visited the leading uni
versities and medical colleges in
Japan, China, Korea, and Manchuria
during his recent trip in the Far East.
At Doshisha University, which wa,s
organized by an American, J. D. Davis,
with whose son Dr. Wilbur is now
doing research work, he was pre
sented with a copy of the college an
nual. This publication is like the
"Quad," or other American annuals, in
makeup, contents, and in the English
captions under the pictures, these last
being used because practically every
student in the university is learning
English as part of his curriculum.
As a member of the Rockefeller
Foundation, Dr. Wilbur was a guest
of the Pekin Union Medical College,
an institution endowed by that or
ganization. He visited also several
oriental Research Institutes where ad
vanced scientific work is being carried
on, and the following universities:
Keio, University of Tokyo, Kioto,
Tsing Hua College in Pekin, Yen Ching
College in Pekin, Nan Kai in Tien
Tsin, Seoul Medical School in Korea,
and Mukden Medical College in Man
churia.
Dr. Wilbur's impression of the
Chinese and Japanese students is that
they are fast adopting American ways,
sometimes with even more enthusiasm
than American students. At Doshisha
University they take a great interest
in athletics of all kinds, including
track, crew, baseball, and the most
popular national sport of wrestling,
and also in debating and dramatics.
The campus buildings are of essen
tially modern construction and are
equipped as well as most American
colleges.
