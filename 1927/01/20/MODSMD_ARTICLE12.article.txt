# Glee Clubs Will Give Concert In Assembly Hall
## 
### 
Saturday night's joint concert of the
Stanford and California Glee Clubs
will be held in the Stanford Assembly
Hall instead of in the Basketball Pa
vilion, as was previously announced.
The completion of the work of re
moving the dangerously loose plaster
from the ceiling of the Assembly Hall
has made this transfer possible.
The dance following the glee club
concert will be held in the Women's
Clubhouse instead of the Pavilion. Ad
mission to the dance is included in
the price of the concert tickets, it

being necessary to present the stubs
at the dance in order to gain entrance.
Music for the dance will be furnished
by Phil Lamkin's Ramblers.
Largest Male Chorus
The concert will bring together the
largest male chorus that has -ever
appeared on this campus. Such an en
semble of the Stanford and California
Glee Clubs has long been the ambition
of Warren D. Allen, director of the

Stanford organization.
It was the coming to the coast of
Leonard B. McWhood from Dartmouth,
however, which finally made such a
performance possible. Professor Mc-
Whood reorganized the California Club
to follow the new trend in University
music of giving numbers of real ex
cellence, a plan which has long been
in effect here.
The two clubs ensemble will sing
three numbers, while each will sing
a series of particularly successful num
bers they have given at other concerts.
Tn addition a piano solo by Rafael
Castiello, California '30, several violin
numbers by Bolton White, and three
soprano solos by Marie de Forest
Emery will be featured.
Tickets for the concert are on sale'
at the Old Union each afternoon from
1 to 5 o'clock, or may be obtained
direct by mail by sending checks to
Box 3006, Stanford University P.O.
Tickets to the affair are one dollar.
