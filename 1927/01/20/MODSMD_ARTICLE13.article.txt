## 
### 
The story of what happened on a
"Night in Baltimore" will be the sub
ject of Dr. Jordan's Thursday Eve
ning Conference which he will hold
at his home at 7:30 o'clock tonight.
A mass meeting in the interests of
peace at which Dr. Jordan was the
principal speaker was broken up by a
mob of war agitators in 1917. Carter
Osburn, the young man who led the
attackers at that time, has recently
written an open letter to Dr. Jordan.
The letter begins as follows: "On
the first Sunday in April, 1917, you
were standing on the stage of the
Baltimore Academy of Music, making
a protest against the impending par
ticipation of this country in the Euro
pean War.
"You were interrupted and the meet
ing broken up by the sudden violent
entrance of a mob which had burst
through the cordon of police outside
the theatre. I was the leader of this
mob which succeeded in making your
appeal unavailing."
Commenting on his actions, Osburn
continues, "I acted after the fashion
of an animal. The propaganda sur
rounding me on every side had af
fected me precisely as the tom-tom
beating of a tribe in an African jungle
affects the youths whom their chiefs
and medicine men desire to stir to
battle."
This open letter Osburn concludes
with the words, "I do not apologize
to you, Sir. No apology is possible
for such an act.
"I assure you only, that experience
and maturity have brought me the
poignant realization that on that Sun
day evening so long ago, you were
motivated by the principles of civiliza
tion, while I was motivated by the
passions of barbarism."
