# FRESHMAN WOMEN AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY KIDNAP SOPHOMORES
## 
### 
Six sophomore women students of
New York University were kidnapped
and held for twenty-tour hours by a
group of freshmen women. They were
rushed into taxicabs and taken away
to Greenwich village by their abduc
tors.
The sophomores were thus kept from
attending a dance being held on the
same evening by the upperclassmen
of the school.
At New York University, kidnap
i ping is allowed under the soph-frosh
! rules with the understanding that any
â–  such victims be not held for any
j loyger period than twenty-four hours,
i The practice under these provisions
has the consent of the faculty and the
student council. This is the first time,
however, that modern students of the
"weaker sex" have indulged in such
activities.
