# HEW TEAM MS TO PLAY TWO GAMES IN SOUTH
## Cards to Use Variation of Zone Defense Against Branch, U.S.C. TWELVE MEN MAKE TRIP Shipkey Unable to Go With Squad on Account of Injured Shoulder 
### Fred Speers 
Stanford's varsity basketball squad
leaves tonight on the Lark for Los
Angeles, scene of two stiff games for
the week-end, one with U.S.C. tomor
row night, the second with the South
ern Branch Saturday night.
A light workout will be held in the
pavilioti this afternoon before the
squad leaves. Further practice will
probably be given the squad tomorrow
morning after its arrival in Los An
geles. The team will stay at the
Beverly Hills Hotel.
Twelve Make Trip
Twelve men have been chosen by
Coach Husky Hunt to make the trip.
According to Hunt this list is the final
selection of the Cardinal players. Fol
lowing is the list: Captain David, Mc-
Candless, Bryant, Jayred, Biaggini,
Price, Vincenti, Anderson, Dobson,
Sexson, Christ, and Lewis. Ted Ship
key, two-year letterman in basketball,
will not accompany the team because
of his lateness in joining the squar'
and because he is still troubled to a
certain extent by an injured shoulder.
Defeat of the Trojan team has been
the maiu effort around which Coach
Hunt has moulded his practices dur
ing the past week. Last night's drill
was preceded by a chalk talk on
U.S.C.'s tactics, players, and showings
thus far in the season.
Badgro Problem
The first-string U.S.C. team includes
in its lineup Badgro and Hibbs, for
wards, Bruner, center, and Larranetta
and Lewis, guards. Careful watching
of Badgro will be one of the main
problems facing the Cardinal players.
The llashy forward is speedy, accu
rate, and perhaps the most dangerous
Trojan when U.S.C. is on the offense.
A variation of the zone defense will
be used by the Cardinals against both
U.S.C. and the Branch. Intensive work
on stalling plays, a new one of which
was supplied by Hunt last night, con
stituted yesterday's workout.
As the Cardinal mentor pointed out
to his men. most of Stanford's scor
ing has been made from a small zone
immediately about the opponents'
basket. Efforts and plays to increase
the size of this circle, and hence to
increase power as a scoring team,
have been the program of recent prac
tices.
