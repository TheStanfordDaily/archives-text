A proposal to give minor sport coaches the same privilege and power
as major sport coaches of making additional awards for particularly
meritorious service should come before the student body in the coming
election as an amendment to the constitution.
It is obviously unfair that the one set of coaches should be able to
recommend the granting of letters to men who have given three years
of hard effort to a team and just miss out in the usual requirements, and
that the others cannot. Each, the major or the minor sport man, gives
his best for the success of the team, and each should receive his reward,
whether it is a block "S" or a circle "S."
In all cases, not merely in a single group, should the coach have the
privilege of rewarding the deserving athlete where the regulations impose
an injustice.
That this opinion deserves the careful consideration of the students
is plain from the fact that it is not initiated by an outsider, but by the
Circle "S" society, which is in a position to know the facts and merits of
the case. It is not the spouting of a fanatic, but a suggestion by a live
organization which has taken at all times an active interest in the welfare
of athletics.
Both this and the amendment to restore weight basketball to a place
in the sport program aim toward making Stanford's athletic policy
better and more consistent and uniform.
