The Y.M.C.A. is thinking".
Last night the proposed plan of merging the men and women's
Christian associations failed to be acted upon at the mass meeting. The
die-hards were unable to sec any particular faults with the organization,
but on the other hand a few people present realized that the present
organization of the "Y" is particularly "wet" and had constructive
suggestions to offer.
It was admitted by some that the Y.M.C.A. must retain its present
name in order to solicit outside financial support. This is a damning
statement for any member to make of his own organization. Any group
that cannot stand upon its work and service does not deserve support.
The campus is already overburdened with useless organizations. A false
front and pretense seems to be this member's purpose in retaining the
name which admittedly carries with it an unwonted stigma.
Boys' work in Palo Alto, said to be the reason for outside support,
will in any case be supported by Palo Alto, according to members of the
Y.M.C.A. Board of Control. An organization's name should not be
considered when asking aid for a worthy cause.
The matter of finances for the organization lies in a particularly
muddled state. But outside sentiment still seems to prevail in regard
to the present system of solicitation of monetary aid from parents and
students.
To insure success the organization should come back to the realization
of its purpose and the work it has undertaken to carry on.
