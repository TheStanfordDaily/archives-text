A HARD MAN TO CONVINCE
In a recent open forum Chancellor
David Starr Jordan made the state-j
ment that Secretary Kellogg's palaver :
about bolsheviatic activities in Nica-1
ragua was such a familiar lie as to \
merit no discussion.
Now it strikes us that Doctor Jordan !
must bo an inveterate skeptic. It was
not so many years ago that he went
on record as doubting—against all
sorts of public opinion to the contrary J
—that the American armies were
really justified in going to Europe.
(Although their avowed purpose was
to make the world safe for Democ
racy! )
And now Doctor Jordan—probably
recalling that the United States once j
wanted to build a canal through Nica
ragua—refuses to believe that Ameri
can forces are down there for the sole
purpose of exterminating the dreadful
Reds (who are terrible blackguards I

j with economic ideas somewhat differ
ent from our own). There can be no
! doubt about it. Dr. Jordan is down
; right skeptical.

SECOND BEST
Now that the game is all over,
; Coach Wade of Alabama has written
to Coach "Pop" Warner and has ad
mitted that Stanford was represented
by the better football team on New
Year's Day. The fact that this mag
\ nanimous admission differs so greatly
; from statements made by any number
of Alabama supporters before the
game reminds us of an opinion ex
pressed by Anatole France.
The French sage commented upon
the fact that every army is regarded
| as the strongest army in the field by
its supporters. This is no more than
logical, he said, because there would
be no point in a nation keeping an
| army second to any other. It would be
J subject to potential defeat.
