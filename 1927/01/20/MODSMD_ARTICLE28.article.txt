A. H. accuses The Executive Com
mittee of favoring the Dramatic Coun
cil by allowing it to monopolize the
closed dates as against other organiza
tions. A. H. exposes an erroneous un
derstanding of the organization of the
Dramatic Councli. A. H. evidently con
siders the Council as a single organiza
tion and opposes its rights and privi
leges to other organizations which are
granted but one closed date for the
year. The Council is not a single or
ganization, but a committee which
represents the entire play-giving ac
tivity of the student body. It is mani
festly absurd that the whole dramatic
activity should be limited to but one
closed date a year—therefore but one
play a year. Secondly, the Dramatic
Council is a collective organization
representing the collective rights of

eight or ten classes and societies to
present one play a year upon a closed
date. These societies are: The Sopho
more, Junior, and Senior Classes,
Masquers, Sword and Sandals, Ram's
Head, et cetera. Whatever the spon
soring society, the date is booked as
Dramatic Council. If the critic will
just pause to look below the surface
of things I am sure that he will find
that some of his indignation will
prove groundless.
I readily admit that the change of
date which threw out three dances
planned for that night was a very un
fortunate happening. It was done with
a great deal of reluctance by both the
Dramatic Council and the Executive
Committee. If the date had not been
changed it would have meant a loss
of many hundreds of dollars to the

! Council and the Associated Students
under whose constitution and sponsor- j
ship the Council is organized. Only i
once in the history of the Council,
I now some seven or eight years old, j
has such an exigency arisen. We sin-.
; cerely trust that for all concerned that j
! it will not happen again.
Lastly, if the critic will notice the
i Council dates for this quarter, Feb.
i 11, Feb. 25, and Mar. 4, he will realize j
! that it means that three plays are to
be given within the limited space of
three weeks. Obviously a very bad
arrangement financially and otherwise :
| for the whole activity. And for that j
; reason it should he obvious that the
j Dramatic Council does not "hog" the
i dates, but that it had to stand aside
; for athletic dates and the claims of :
I other organizations. However, the j
Council has accepted this very un-,
I favorable lumping of its dates with
good grace and will endeavor to make
j the best of the situation. —S.M.

Now what we want to know is

; better. Huh? —J.M.B.
