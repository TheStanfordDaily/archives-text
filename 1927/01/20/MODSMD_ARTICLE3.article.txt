# 'Y' MEIERS PLAN REORGANIZATION AT CAMPUS OPEN FORUM MEETING
## "Y.W. Has Been an Organization to Which Houses Send Sophomores for Activities," Says Duniway 
### 
Possibility of sweeping changes in
the organizations of the Y.M.- and
Y.W\C.A.'s on the campus was voiced
at a stormy three-hour Open Forum
of the associations last night.
Awaiting more definite crystalliza
tion of student opinion, the executive
board of the Y.M.C.A. will be ready
either to continue as at present or to
modify the budget and plans for this
year and next, according to K. M.
Cowdery, assistant registrar and fac
ulty member of the "Y" board. "The
board will back financially whatever
program the students really want,"
said Cowdery.
Another open meeting before deci
sive action is a probability, said Rex
C. Bell, campus secretary.
Debate centered on the report of a
joint Y.M.-Y.W. committee proposing
a simplified merger of the associations.
The plan urges an "open fellowship of
Stanford men and women who asso
ciate themselves for intellectual, spiri
tual, and social growth and service
in the campus community."

| Criticism was expressed that the
organizations are not fulfilling their
proper function on the campus. "The
i Y.W. has been an organization to
i which the houses send their sopho
mores for an activity, and the Y.M.
the same except that no house would
think of sending its pledges," com
mented John Duniway, member of the
committee advocating reorganization.
1 "It is using a false face for the Chris
tian association to engage in social
service under the name," said Duni
way. "For that, call it a social service
club, 'save the boys of Palo Alto
league,' or what have you? It is arti
ficial to maintain a large, unwieldy
organization to carry on a lot ftf ac
tivities."
Difficulty of explaining the real pur
poses of the Y.W.C.A. to the campus
was given as a problem by Isabel
Capps, campus secretary. "At certain
seasons of the year my office is be
sieged by sophomore girls saying:
'My house sent me down here, have
you anything for meV" she com
mented.
