# Esperanto Impossible as World Tongue Says Savant
## 
### 
Esperanto as a world language will
never succeed, stated Dr. Jose Galvez of
the University of Chile in a recent ad
dress to students of U.S.C. The speaker
claims that English is the most widely
spoken language around the world, and
is the one official language adopted by
the League of Nations and the Pan-
American Union.
Cultural morality was emphasized as
the determining factor in choosing a
world tongue. Dr. Galvez declares that
Esperanto has an artificial character
which makes it valueless, while French is
debarred from becoming international be
cause of the dominant theme of immoral
ity which is sounded in French literature,
a reflection of Parisian life.
