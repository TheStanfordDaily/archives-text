# HARVARD STUDENTS LEAST 'COLLEGIATE' SAYS TURKEL

### 
"Although my impressions of East
ern universities were very kaleido
scopic, I found that the institution
having the least number, proportion
ately, of 'collegiates,' was Harvard
University," declared Harry R. Turkel,
varsity debater, on his return last
night after a successful tour of East
ern universities. "The graduate schools
at Harvard are on the whole the best
in the United States."
After meeting many of the seventy
eight former Stanford men now at
tending the Cambridge university, he
says "one is impelled to ask, however,
whether they are not overdoing the
thing. In the Law School and the
School of Business Administration, the
men seem to be straining every nerve
in their bodies in order to keep up
with daily assignments.
"At Yale they are less scholarly
than at Harvard, a good deal 'snootier,'
and 'consider themselves beyond the
range of mere criticism," he continued.
"Princeton seems hopeless. A life of
luxurious ease, such as is evident in
the palatial clubs surrounding the

campus is either incompatible with
profound scholastic attainments or
else our stay in Princeton was so
short that we did not run into anyone
who disapproved the late President
Woodrow Wilson's contention that
Princeton was a 'glorified country
club.'
"We were enthusiastically received
at all of the seven universities where
we debated and had many inquiries
about Stanford from Eastern under
graduates intending to enter the Uni
versity in the near future. Our two
Harvard opponents, Lorenson and
Hubbard, were greatly interested in
Stanford and have sent for informa
tion regarding its courses and require
ments."
While on their tour East, Turkel
and Fred Combellack won victories
over Bowdoin, Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton; lost decisions to Bates and
Marquette; met the City College of
Detroit, in a no-decision contest.
Combellack stopped off in San Fran
cisco last night and is expected to re
turn to the campus today.
