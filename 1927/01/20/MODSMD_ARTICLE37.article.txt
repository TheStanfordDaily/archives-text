# OKLAHOMA CONSIDERS USING OXFORD PLAN
## 
### 
| The University of Oklahoma may
employ the Oxford school system if
recently announced plans are carried
I out as they were set forth recently by
Dr. Homer L. Dodge, dean of the
| graduate school.
In the decision to transfer the hold
ings of Kingfisher college to the uni
versity, Dr. Dodge said that Oklahoma
! has a wonderful opportunity to take
the first step toward establishing the
Oxford system.
"The movement in this direction is
a very desirable thing and the idea
that this university should be limited
to tax-supported functions is wrong,"
said Doctor Dodge.
