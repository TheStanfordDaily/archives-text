# FRESHMAN QUINTET DEFEATS PIEDMONT HIGH; SCORE 32-16
## Babes Show Improvement in Teamwork, Accuracy Of Passing 
### 
By showing splendid teamwork the
babe basketball team was able to
defeat the Piedmont High School five
last night, 32-16, for the freshmen's
third victory of the season.
The game was evenly played by both
quintets in the first half which ended
with the score 8-6 in favor of the year-

lings. The Piedmont players worked
the ball into freshman territory fre
quently but could not find the basket
to register their try for goals.
Coach Hunt's men showed the same
! tendency as the varsity football team
this year in not being able to get
under way until the second half. The
yearlings were nearly as poor as the
Highlanders in hitting the basket but
showed a superior teamwork and more
accurate passing.
Held to Five Baskets
In the second half it was all for the
babes who came back with an aggres
sive attack and an ability to pass the
ball that seemed to baffle their oppo
nents. The freshmen held the High
lander quintet to five baskets during
the last two quarters while they made
eleven.
Berg, yearling forward, accounted
for eight baskets and two free shots,
which made him high scorer of the
evening. Bush played a good offensive
! game and Thompson, standing guard,
j kept the Piedmont forwards from en
j dangering the babes' goal.
The freshman lineup in the game
last night was: Berg and Stewart, for
: wards, Bush, center, Simpkins and
i Thompson, guards. Substitutes were
! Garabotto, Long, Mann, Rothert,
| Smith, Steinbeck, and Albertson.
