# ENDOWMENT DISCUSSED BY SENIOR COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Although the Senior Endowment
Committee at their meeting yesterday
afternoon took no final action, they
did decide to consider an endowment
for the Class of 1927.
J. E. McDowell, Alumni Secretary,
explained the different kinds of en
dowment given in past years to the
University by various classes, includ
ing the insurance and pledge types.
Vie favors the latter type where each
member of the class pledges himself
to give a fixed sum to a certain fuud
over a definite period of years.
At the next meeting of the commit
tee an insurance agent will explain
the details of the endowment insur
ance policy, and John Menzies, chair
man of the committee, hopes they
will then be able to make a choice
between the two if they should deem
the endowment advisable.
