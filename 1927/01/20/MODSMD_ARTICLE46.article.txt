UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eu
frene, Jan. IS.â€”That an increase of stu
dent fees at the University of Ofegon as
& proposed solution for the financial
jToblem is impracticable, is the opinion
of President Arnold Bennett Hall.
"To surrender the principle of democ
racy in education woiuld be a most un
fortunate mistake," said President Hall.
"To put fees up much further would
t'.Jtd to limit the enrollment in a state
.s-jpported institution to the sons and
daughters of the wealthy. This is incon
sistent with the democratic tradition of
the commonwealth."
