# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
While not so many records fell dur
ing the 1926 track season as in the
previous twelve months, nevertheless
a year that included new marks in the
"100," "220," half-mile, and discus
throw, as well as several bona fide
defeats of Nurmi and an American in
vasion by Charley Hoff, the famous
Norwegian pole-vaulter and all-around
athlete, cannot be called a failure, by
any means.
Charley Paddock's successful come
back and his mark of 9% seconds for
the century, which has been accepted
by the A.A.U., and Roland Locke's
sensational running in both dashes, in
which he officially 1 made the time of
20V& seconds for the furlong, caused
quite a stir in this country. These do
not compare internationally with the
interest aroused when Dr. Otto
Peltzer, of Germany, broke Ted Mere
dith's world's record for the half-mile
at the English championships in July.
The German's time was 1:51 3-5 and
he later showed that this was no fluke
by beating both Wide of Sweden and
Nurmi of Finland in a 1500-meter race,
setting a new world's mark of 3:51.
Nurmi beat Wide in a 4:11 miles, but
Wide plater took a fall out of the
"Flying Finn" in a two-mile race in
Berlin in 9:1 1-5.
Charley Hoff made good as an in
door pole-vaulter on his first trip to
America, raising the world's record
gradually until he had it up to 13 feet,
S inches, still considerably below his
outdoor mark. Then Hoff came a crop

per with the A.A.U. while on the
Pacific Coast, his permit for further
participation was canceled, he turned
professional, and later sued the Ama
teur Athletic Union for a large sum.
The A.A.U. championships showed
that a lot of new stars were coming
up to. crowd out the old reliables, al
though Lloyd Hahn, of the Boston Ath
letic Association, was one veteran who
came through in great style at the
Sesqui meet, with a clinking mile in
4:16 in the mud, and a terrifically fast
half-mile in the relays later. Hahn had
previously been on an athletic tour of
the Antipodes with Jackson Scholz,
where he met several defeats at the
hands, or rather feet, of another great
runner, Randolph Rose. The Illinois
Athletic Club won the team champion
ship in both the indoor and outdoor
A.A.U. events.
The intercollegiate track and field
year was featured by the University
of Southern California's victory in the
1.C.4A. meet for the second year in
success. Led by Capt. "Bud" Houser,
who in April had set a new world's
record in the discus-throw, "the sturdy
Trojans gathered 35y 2 points. Michi
gan won the Big Ten meet by eight
points over Illinois.
What was probably the greatest
track and field meet ever held in
America, took place when the National
Collegiate meet was held in Grant
Park Stadium in Chicago on June 12th.
This was unofficially won by U.S.C.
and was featured by Alva Martin's

half mile in 1:51 7-10. and Haggard's
high-jump mark of 6 feet, 7*4 inches.
John Kuck, of Kansas S.T.C., put the
16-pound shot more than 50 feet, and
later in the year broke the world's
records for putting the 8- and 12-
pound shots.

1926 Track Review

previous twelve months, nevertheless
a year that included new marks in the
"100," "220," half-mile, and discus
throw, as well as several bona fide
defeats of Nurmi and an American in
vasion by Charley Hoff, the famous
Norwegian pole-vaulter and all-around
athlete, cannot be called a failure, by
any means.
Charley Paddock's successful come
back and his mark of 9% seconds for
the century, which has been accepted
by the A.A.U., and Roland Locke's
sensational running in both dashes, in
which he officially 1 made the time of
20V& seconds for the furlong, caused
quite a stir in this country. These do
not compare internationally with the
interest aroused when Dr. Otto
Peltzer, of Germany, broke Ted Mere
dith's world's record for the half-mile
at the English championships in July.
The German's time was 1:51 3-5 and
he later showed that this was no fluke
by beating both Wide of Sweden and
Nurmi of Finland in a 1500-meter race,
setting a new world's mark of 3:51.
Nurmi beat Wide in a 4:11 miles, but
Wide plater took a fall out of the
"Flying Finn" in a two-mile race in
Berlin in 9:1 1-5.
Charley Hoff made good as an in
door pole-vaulter on his first trip to
America, raising the world's record
gradually until he had it up to 13 feet,
S inches, still considerably below his
outdoor mark. Then Hoff came a crop
