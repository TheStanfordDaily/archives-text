# RETURN OF WEIGHT BASKETBALL PUT TO A.S.S.U. VOTE
## AMENDMENTS PROPOSED Recommending of Awards By Minor Sport Coaches Is Desired 
### 
Two constitutional amendments will
be on the A.S.S.U. ballot next month
if the plans of the Circle S society
are completed. This organization is
promising a strenuous fight to bring
about the re-establishment of weight
basketball and to give minor sport
coaches the same privilege as major
sport coaches of making additional
awards for meritorious service on a
team.
Discussion over the latter proposal
has just been brought to light and so
far has received little comment on
the campus other than from Circle S
men. Major sport coaches are per
mitted to recommend men for awards
for meritous service while they have
not played the required length of time,
but minor sport coaches are not given
this opportunity.
Minor Sport Awards
The practice has met with great
disapproval on the part of the minor
sport participants, and to remedy this
situation the constitutional amend
ment has been proposed. This matter
was brought to issue last fall when a
man on the soccer team had rendered
meritorious service for three years
without quite fulfilling the required
length of time.
The society is starting a fight to
bring about the return of weight bas
ketball by proposing an amendment
which would authorize the A.S.S.U. to
issue minor sport awards for the par
ticipants in the sport.
Clark Cypher and William Hobro
have been appointed by the group to
draft the amendments and present
them for the approval of the students
at the winter election next month.
