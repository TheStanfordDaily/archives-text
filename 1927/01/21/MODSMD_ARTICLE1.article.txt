# FIRST CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN A.S.S.U. LAWS
## Committee Will Not Touch Organic Structure of Constitution RESOLUTION IS PASSED New Plan for Publications Includes Manager and Budget Proposals 
### 
Complete reorganization of the
present system of campus publications
was the plan presented to the Consti
tution Committee at its meeting last
night.
Revision of the article in the con
stitution concerning representation on
the Executive Committee, tentatively
passed upon at the last meeting, ap
proval of the amended section on
dutiesi of officers, and the passing of
a resolution defining the application
of the policy previously adopted in
reference to fundamental changes in
the Constitution, were further acts of
the committee.
Publication Changes
Three fundamental changes were in
cluded in the proposed plan for run
ning campus publications. These con
cerned the unification of the control
of general publications in a Publica
tion Manager, chosen from the gradu
ate students, a limitation on the sala
ries of the managers of the publica
tions, and a method of subsidizing and
budgeting.
The committee requests that all
managers and editors of publications
and others interested in the revision
meet with the members on Monday
evening, January 24, at 8 :30 o'clock in
the A.S.S.U. offices, to discuss the
plan as outlined and propose any
changes.
Make Resolution
The resolution concerning the policy
adopted by the committee follows:
"RESOLVED, that it is the sense of
the committee that the resolution
passed in reference to fundamental
changes in the constitution is not ap
plicable to matters affecting the or
ganic structure of the student gov
ernment."
A resolution was passed revising the
article concerning representation on
the Executive Committee to read that
a graduate member and a sophomore
member be elected at the February
election for the term of one year,
eliminating the junior member ordi
narily elected at that time.
