# CARDINAL GOLF TEAM TO MEET LOS ALTOS TOMORROW MORNING
## Results of Coming Matches Will Determine Men to Play California 
### 
Stanford's ten-man varsity golf team
will meet the Lob Altos Country Club
team tomorrow morning at the Club
course. Arrangements for the match
were completed by the new golf man
ager, Robert Syer.
At the head of the opposing Club
team will be "Dink" Templeton. Two
track men are playing on the golf
team and because of this fact an at
tempt is being made to move the date
of the California-Stanford golf match
ahead from April 23 to February 5 so
that golf will be over before track
begins. The results of the two preced
ing matches together with the matches
to be held in the next few weeks will
determine the eight-man team to op
pose California.
The team which will play tomorrow
is composed of the ten lowest scores
turned in after the varsity-freshmen
match which was held last Saturday
and which was won by the varsity,
21 to 1.
Following are the members of the
team which will play tomorrow: Ed
monds, Syer, Myberg, White, Vermilya,
Fleishhacker, Frankel, Black, Purkiss,
and Combs.
Anyone having difficulty in obtain
ing transportation or who is unable to
play is asked by Syer to get in touch
with him at the Phi Kappa Psi house.
A lunch will be served the Stanford
golfers by the Los Altos team at the
club tomorrow noon.
