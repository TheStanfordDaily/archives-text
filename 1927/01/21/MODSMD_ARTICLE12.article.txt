# YOUTH FACTOR IN CHINA'S PROGRESS DECLARES WILBUR
## Oriental Students' Advance In Research Equal to Other Countries 
### 
"Youth is on the drive in Japan and
China," declared President Wilbur in
his Assembly talk yesterday. "Japa
nese medical students are seeking a
world understanding in science, and
to the enthusiasm of Chinese youth
has been added the marked trend to
ward English material advancement,
both combining to hasten the process
of turning China into a great civiliza
tion."
Interest Keen
"At the Pan-Pacific Science Con
gress only English was spoken, as
had been requested by the Japanese.
The use of English was possible be
cause it is being taught in practically
all the schools and because almost all
the Japanese scientists speak it, the
significance being that" these people
are interested in what is going on in
other countries. Their universities are
on a par with any I've seen in the
world, and at the present time they
are carrying on more research than
any other country.
"Japan became a modern nation in
one sweep because she fell into stride
at the time when the laboratory came
into its own. Although customs are
hard to change the Japanese have
been able to adopt modern thinking
and modern methods in the midst of
ancient forms. It is interesting now
to note the veneration for imperial
ism, and to watch for those adjust
ments which the imperial household
will have to make to cope with chang
ing Japan."
Korea Eclipsed at Present
Dr. Wilbur's impression of Korea
waa that, although Japan's administra
tive work has already resulted in im-
proved railroads and school systems,
its problem of being an exhausted
country has not yet been settled. He
believes that Korea is eclipsed at the
present time because of an inability
to introduce modern features, but that
out of the people's native strength
will develop many strong individuals.
"In China today there are two im
portant factors," said Dr. Wilbur.
"One is the Russian influence tending
toward revolutionary ideas, an influ
ence that has reached its peak and is
now receding; the other concerns the
activities of 'returned students,' who
are in evidence everywhere through
out both China and Japan, asking for
rights, questioning long-held ideas, and
introducing suggestions for majority
rule.
"Of the two factors the American
idea should win because it is more
suited to Chinese progress; in fact,
the future of the world depends on
the choice of the Chinese people, for
China is an unmined source of human
strength in modern civilization."
Soldiers were everywhere in China
and intensified Dr. Wilbur's vivid im
pression that the country is actually
at war. It is his opinion that out of
the presence of military men will come
progress, for the people resent their
presence and are beginning to prefer
a spirit of negotiation as a solution to
their problems, a change which, he
said, "appears hopeful."
Pekin he described as a "remarkable
city, where you can see a Ford and a
camel side by side, and where public
execution of criminals seeme to have
discouraged crime to such an extent
that even in the midst of civil war,
women can walk safely alone at
night."
