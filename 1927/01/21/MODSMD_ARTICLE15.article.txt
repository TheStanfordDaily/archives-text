Breakers 27, El Campo 10
Alpha Tau Omega, Encina 5, Beta
Theta Pi, and Breakers were victori
ous in the intramural play yesterday,
while Los Arcos, Delta Upsilon, En
cina 1W and El Campo were on the
small end of the scores. The first
games of the afternoon and evening
were exciting affairs, with Alpha Tau
Omega and Beta Theta Phi winning
out by two-point margins.
Sinking a short shot from under the
basket with ten seconds to go, Jost
of the A.T.O. five earned a narrow
victory for the Row men over Los
Arcos in a 7-5 game in which both
teams failed to show any speed, team
work, floorwork, or shooting worthy of
the name.
More speed was shown by Encina 5
and Delta Upsilon in their fray, the
affair becoming really interesting to
ward the end, when in four minutes
the score changed from 9-9 to end
18-10 in favor of the Encina team.
Better floorwork was in evidence,
though the numerous set-up shots were
total failures. The Encina men led
most of the way.
Encina 1W was nosed out in the
last few minutes of play in the first
game of the evening, losing to the
Beta Theta Phi team by a score of
10 to 8. At the end of the first half,
the score was tied at 5 to 5, but the
Betas managed to forge ahead in the
second period and came out on top.
Dail of Encina was the outstanding
star of the tussle, accounting for all
of his team's tallies, and being the
only man able to break through the
Row team's defense.
In the final game, Breakers scored
an overwhelming victory over El
Campo. At half time it was anybody's
game with the score standing 4 to 4.
However the victors played real ball
in the last half, and shot baskets al
most at will. Harlow and Cook of
Breakers were the brilliant lights of
the evening. Harlow tipped two field
goals in the basket from a toss-up
several feet from the hoop.
Games scheduled for today are as
follows: 4:15— Encina 1E vs. Branner
II; 4:so—Chinese Club vs. Delta Tau
Delta.
