# VARSITY BASKETBALL FIVE MEETS TROJANS, BRUINS IN LOS ANGELES
## Cardinal Plays First Coast Conference Game of Year Against Southerners U.S.C. DEFENSE STRONG Coach Hunt Will Try New Style Defense Against Teams in South 
### Fred Speers 
Stanford swings into action for its
Coast Conference standing tonight
when the Cardinals meet the Univer
sity of Southern California varsity in
Los Angeles. Coach Husky Hunt's men
left last night on the Lark, twelve
strong, for their two-game week-end.
They meet the Southern Branch in a
return game tomorrow night.
A light workout, consisting largely
of basket-shooting, constituted yester
day afternoon's workout in the pavi
lion. To defeat Southern California
tonight the Cardinal squad must con
vert a good percentage of their tries
for field goals. To all indications the
scores in the two games will run high.
Stanford's best scoring combination,
according to past game summaries, is
McCandless, Bryant, and Jayred. Dob
son, substitute, is equally dependable
for registering tallies when he is in
the game.
For defensive work to check the
speedy Badgro, Trojan forward ace,
Hunt will probably start Vincenti and
Anderson. This combination works
well against a fast running attack,
which in U.S.C.'s case, is built largely
around Badgro.
Laranetta, a major cog in U.S.C.
offensive work, is a left-handed run
ning guard. The former Lake Forest
Academy player is a fairly accurate
basket-shooter, though not exception
ally strong in floorwork.
Coach Hunt plans a variation in the
usual Cardinal style of defense which
he may use against both week-end
opponents. Instead of forming quickly
into the regular zone defense forma
tion, Hunt has ordered two of his
fastest forward men to play deep in
enemy territory, hampering t'ne oppos
ing guards as much as possible.
Bryant and Jayred will probably be
the men selected to out this
plan. Both are fast and agressive and
capable to return quickly to their own
territory should the ball be worked
down under the Cardinal basket.
The ultimate effect of this procedure
will be to speed up the game which,
if thfe Cardinals can set the pace thoy
have once or twice thus far displayed
in the season, will work to Stanford's
advantage.
According to practices of the past
week, Coach Husky Hunt has been
pointing his men particularly to the
Trojan contest because of its counting
in the Coast Conference standing.
However, the squad, should it win
from U.S.C., will not let down in the
Branch game because of the 21-17 de
feat suffered at the Bruin hands ear
lier in the season.
