# PROGRAM FOR ORGAN RECITAL COMPOSED OF HANDEL SELECTIONS
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will play a special program of the
works of Oeorg Friedrich Handel at
4 o'clock Sunday afternoon in the
Memorial Church. The announcement
made in yesterday's Daily as to the
repetition of the Thursday afternoon
concert was incorrect. |
Handel (1685-1759) was the greatest
organist of his time with the sole
exception of J. S. Bach. His fame rest 3
on the numerous oratorios which he
composed, selections from some of
which will be given on the program
Sunday.
The complete program, several of
the numbers in which are being played
for the first time in a University organ
recital, is as follows:
Sinfonia from the Oratorio "Saul."
Air and Finale from the Tenth Organ
Concerto.
Largo from "Xerxes."
Selections from the "Water Music."
