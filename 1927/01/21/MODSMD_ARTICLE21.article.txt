In the new constitution now being compiled for the student body, a!
piovision is made for the graduate students to have a representative on
the Executive Committee. Thus they will have an opportunity to take
part in the government of student affairs.
Inasmuch as the graduates form a large portion of the total registra
tion at Stanford and through the payment of the community fee become
qualified members of the Associated Students, it is only right that they
should take their share of the privileges and duties involved.
Most of them were 011 the campus for their undergraduate work and
took an active interest in University affairs. Several have at different
times occupied student positions of importance and responsibility. As
Stanford is tending more toward graduate and specialized advance work,
the students who have received the A.B. degree should have a voice in
controlling student business.
In order to provide for this and keep the Executive Committee to a
reasonable and workable size, the practice of having one sophomore
representative in the second half of the year is necessarily abandoned.
And in all events, this latter provision formerly gave a balance of power
to the juniors in the fall when they have three direct representatives,
while the seniors have two.
'I he delay of half a year before a class will be represented on the
committee will he no great injustice, while the policy of having a
graduate representative is just and should prove to the best interest of
the Associated Students.
