Today finds the campus littered with clubs and societies wandering
along aimlessly neglecting to realize the purpose for which they were
organized. Perhaps somewhere in the back of their minds the club
members have some realization of the motive for originally bringing the
group together. But obviously many societies manage to exist from
year to year doing nothing but collecting dues and posing for the
annual Quad picture.
Without a clear understanding of the goal ahead no group can
efficiently function or possibly hope to boast of even meager accomplish
ments. Aimlessness is deplorable and profitless. How pleasant life would
be if everyone were satisfied to saunter along and at the proper time
find the necessities of life waiting in security! But facts must I>e faced,
and it must be admitted that it is necessary for everyone to set a goal
at which to aim.
It would be well for the Y.M.C.A. to take council with Dr.
TT. H. Tweedy, who some time ago in the Yale Divinity Ncivs, said:
" . . . . when religion is fairly and effectively presented, this younger
generation is intensely interested in it and attracted by it; and when
that generation has a chance to discuss religious problems fearlessly and
frankly, it will sit up with any competent leader far into the night."
An organization that would carry out Dr. Tweedy's suggestions
should find a place on this campus. Wandering with an enormous super
structure necessitating an over-amount of financial support is dangerous.
Only by considering what the students themselves want and feel the
need for can an organization like the "Y" justify itself.
