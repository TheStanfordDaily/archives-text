TWO SONNETS
There was a young man named Brink
Who never had tasted strong drink
Till he downed eorne gin,
Then said with a grin,
That f-feels awfully g-good, I think.
There was a young man from Yetting
Who was greatly opposed to petting,
Said girls shouldn't do it,
That boys would soon rue it.
What horselaughs he's getting.

The kind of girl that you don't like
to take out —The one that asks you do
you know So-and-So? No? He's snre a
nice kid. And so on, until finally she
finds someone you have heard of.
* • *
But the worst is the one that tells
you of her dates with the campus
celebrities.

DIALOGUE
"How do you get rid of temptation?"
"Yield."

Diary of Stanford Co-ed —January 19
I had decided that I would accept
the first man that asked me for a
date for the Toyon Co-ed dance. To
day, as I was walking along, a big,
rough, unshaven man, such as I imag
ined lived in Toyon, came slowly to
ward me. I was thrilled to death and
thought, "What a big he-man!" He
gazed at me hesitantly, so to encour
age him I gave him a shy, modest
smile, such as Clara Bow might give.
That won him, for he said, in an em
harassed voice, "Say, Lady," and hesi
tated; then my heart fluttering, "could
you spare me a dime for a cup of
coffee ?"
