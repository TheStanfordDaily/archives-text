Wrigley on the possibility of another
similar swim, and Wrigley declared
that at present he has no plans for
any kind of a swim in the future, j
Rumors of proposed swimming races
between the mainland and islands in
Florida and Santa Barbara have been
circulated, as well as the idea of a
race between two of the Hawaiian,

Several important questions were!
definitely settled by the outcome of

against cold and practically floating

on the energy derived from the crawl.

are practically useless, in that the
