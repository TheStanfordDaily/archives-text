# STANFORD BASEBALL ASPIRANTS WORK OUT DAILY UNDER WOLTER
## Nine Veterans of Oriental Ball Tour Return for Winter Practice 
### George Story 
Cold, and even rain, hold no terror
for the candidates for places on the
Stanford varsity and freshman base
ball teams, for every afternoon, de
spite the unfavorable weather, there
are a number of diamond aspirants
going through their paces in the prac
tice field under the watchful eye of
Harry Wolter, ex-Coast League star,
whose present duty is to direct the
efforts of Stanford's ball-tossers.
Nine men who made their block "S"
last season are reporting for workouts,
and of that number three are pitchers,
*o it appears that the Cardinal mound
staff this season should cause not a
little trouble to the opposing batsmen.
The three chuckers are Captain Steve
Collins, Sobieski, and Riese, and when
the name of Doug Lewis is added to
this list, the slabmen certainly look
like a strong group.
Behind the bat Clarence Syplier is
showing the same old pepper and
should have another good season this
year.
Three veterans in the infield give
Coach Wolter promise of a fast com
bination In that department. McGuire
at first base, Busch at second, and
Garibaldi, shortstop, were members of
last year's nine, and are showing up
equally well or better in the early
workouts. Cliff Morrill is making a
good fight for the right to play third
base.
Nissen and Stewart in the outfield,
both of whom played last season, are
snagging fly balls with their same old
ability, and Eddie Marks, Frankie Wil
ton, and MoKey, all experienced men,
also have the makings of first-class
outfielders.
But the varsity is not alone in its
good prospects. The 1930 team, with a
number of prep and high school stars
answering roll call, also has good
prospects. Numbered among the lead
ing oalndidates for the frosh nine are
Harold Templeinan, pitcher; McCoy,
catcher; Charles Hadenfeldt, Tito
Bianchi, and Bill Laird, infielders, and
Kenneth Sampson, Tom Murphy, and
Jack Levin, outfielders.
