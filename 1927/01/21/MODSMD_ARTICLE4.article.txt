# JORDAN RELATES PEACE SPEECH REBELLION
## 
### 
"I do not believe in war as a means
of settling anything, and I doubt if
there is any question that cannot be
settled by arbitration." With these
words, Dr. Jordan introduced his
Thursday Evening Lecture last night
when he told the story of the fateful
night in Baltimore in 1917 when his
life was threatened, and which cul
minated a lecture tour he had been
making in the interests of peace at
various Eastern universities.
"I was on the stage of the Balti
more Academy of Music," said Dr.
Jordan, "to make a speech which was
a protest against the impending par
ticipation of this country in the World
War.
Collegiates Mob Hall
"I had been speaking only a few
minutes when a mob of college men,
sons of bankers and armament makers,
broke the lock on the great iron door
of the theatre and marched up the
main aisle. The leader carried an
American flag which he brought up to
the stage and planted before us."
Dr. Jordan then related the story of
how the audience quietly left the
meeting through the side entrances of
the theatre, and he left for his hotel.
"After breaking up the meeting,"
continued Dr. Jordan, "these fellows,
followed by a crowd ot about 1000
people, paraded around town and
through all the large hotels, singing,
'We'll hang Dave Jordan to a sour
apple tree.' I was told afterward that
they spent the whole night hunting
for me."
Leader Writes Letter
Then Dr. Jordan read an open letter
to him which was published in "The
Modern World" in December 1926. The
letter was from Carter Osburn who
was the leader of the mob that broke
up the meeting in Baltimore ten years
ago.
In commenting on Osburn's letter,
Dr. Jordan said, "I think this is one
of the most remarkable letters ever
written."
Ohburn, in his letter, relates the
results of ten years of experience
since that night in Baltimore. He says,
in part, "Much has happened during
those ten years. I spent part of them
overseas and saw something of the
actuality of war. And now 1 find it im
possible to recall any definite thought
which motivated me in leading that
exdited hordo through the police and
down the aisle of the Academy of
Music.
"At least you will permit me to tell
you that I know now, what you knew
then; that you were guided by the
nobility of human reason and that I
was under the spell of an artificially
created hysteria "
This letter Osbum conclnded by
saying, "I do not apologize to you, Sir.
No apology is possible for such an act.
I assure you only, that experience and
maturity have brought me the poig
nant realization that on that Sunday
evening so long ago, you were moti
vated by the principles of civilization,
while I was motivated by the passions
of barbnrism."

No apology is possible for such an act.
I assure you only, that experience and
maturity have brought me the poig

evening so long ago, you were moti

of barbnrism."
"I do not believe in war as a means
of settling anything, and I doubt if
there is any question that cannot be
settled by arbitration." With these
words, Dr. Jordan introduced his
Thursday Evening Lecture last night
when he told the story of the fateful
night in Baltimore in 1917 when his
life was threatened, and which cul
minated a lecture tour he had been
making in the interests of peace at
various Eastern universities.
"I was on the stage of the Balti
more Academy of Music," said Dr.
Jordan, "to make a speech which was
a protest against the impending par
ticipation of this country in the World
War.
Collegiates Mob Hall
"I had been speaking only a few
minutes when a mob of college men,
sons of bankers and armament makers,
broke the lock on the great iron door
of the theatre and marched up the
main aisle. The leader carried an
American flag which he brought up to
the stage and planted before us."
Dr. Jordan then related the story of
how the audience quietly left the
meeting through the side entrances of
the theatre, and he left for his hotel.
"After breaking up the meeting,"
continued Dr. Jordan, "these fellows,
followed by a crowd ot about 1000
people, paraded around town and
through all the large hotels, singing,
'We'll hang Dave Jordan to a sour
apple tree.' I was told afterward that
they spent the whole night hunting
for me."
Leader Writes Letter
Then Dr. Jordan read an open letter
to him which was published in "The
Modern World" in December 1926. The
letter was from Carter Osburn who
was the leader of the mob that broke
up the meeting in Baltimore ten years
ago.
In commenting on Osburn's letter,
Dr. Jordan said, "I think this is one
of the most remarkable letters ever
written."
Ohburn, in his letter, relates the
results of ten years of experience
since that night in Baltimore. He says,
in part, "Much has happened during
those ten years. I spent part of them
overseas and saw something of the
actuality of war. And now 1 find it im
possible to recall any definite thought
which motivated me in leading that
exdited hordo through the police and
down the aisle of the Academy of
Music.
"At least you will permit me to tell
you that I know now, what you knew
then; that you were guided by the
nobility of human reason and that I
was under the spell of an artificially
created hysteria "
This letter Osbum conclnded by
saying, "I do not apologize to you, Sir.
No apology is possible for such an act.
I assure you only, that experience and
maturity have brought me the poig
nant realization that on that Sunday
evening so long ago, you were moti
vated by the principles of civilization,
