Fidel La Barba will have to put up
the fight of his young life tonight
when he meets Elky Clark in their
battle for the world's flyweight cham
pionship. For Clark, from all reports,
is a worthy successor to Jimmy
Wilde, first holder of the title, and
one of the gamest little men who ever
lived. If La Barba beats the flyweight
champion of Europe, he can forever
convince those who doubt his rightful
claim to the title of'world's champion,
which he won from Frankie Genaro,
who "inherited" the title after the
death of Pancho Villa.
La Barba and Clark will furnish
quite a study in contrasts as they
square off in the roped arena at Madi
son Square Garden, New York, to
night. Fidel is just twenty-one, and
shows no marks from his twenty-five
professional fights; while Elky, who
is twenty-eight, is quite the opposite,
having a pair of nicely cauliflowered
ears, a wife, and'four children. (Don't
get me wrong on this last for Elky got
his cauliflowered ears from his forty
two fights,*not from his wife and four
children.)
It's been six months now since Fidel
has defended his title, and in staking
all in a battle, far from his native
California, with an opponent of Clark's
caliber, he shows that he is not a
dodging champion of the Dempsey

type, but one who can be counted on
to clean up the best in his division.
I have known the handsome little fly
weight king intimately ever since he
first started fighting in amateur four
rounders in the ring of the Los An
geles Athletic Club, six years ago, and
have watched his rise under George
Blake's tutelage—first to Olympic
champion and then to world's cham
pion—with much interest.
A great deal of La Barba's success
is due to the wise way in which his
manager, George Blake, has handled
him. Blake knows fights and fighters
from A to Z, having been a boxing in
structor and refree for many years.
He taught Fidel all he knew, and the
little Italian-American proved an apt
pupil. If La Barba fulfills his promise
to quit fight game in the near
future to enter Stanford University,
the ring will lose a great little fighter
and a fine gentleman.

has defended his title, and in staking
all in a battle, far from his native
California, with an opponent of Clark's
caliber, he shows that he is not a
dodging champion of the Dempsey

type, but one who can be counted on
to clean up the best in his division.
I have known the handsome little fly
weight king intimately ever since he
first started fighting in amateur four
rounders in the ring of the Los An
geles Athletic Club, six years ago, and
have watched his rise under George
Blake's tutelage—first to Olympic
champion and then to world's cham
pion—with much interest.
A great deal of La Barba's success
is due to the wise way in which his
manager, George Blake, has handled
him. Blake knows fights and fighters
from A to Z, having been a boxing in
structor and refree for many years.
He taught Fidel all he knew, and the
little Italian-American proved an apt
pupil. If La Barba fulfills his promise
to quit fight game in the near
future to enter Stanford University,
the ring will lose a great little fighter
and a fine gentleman.

Fidel La Barba will have to put up
the fight of his young life tonight
when he meets Elky Clark in their
battle for the world's flyweight cham
pionship. For Clark, from all reports,
is a worthy successor to Jimmy
Wilde, first holder of the title, and
one of the gamest little men who ever
lived. If La Barba beats the flyweight
champion of Europe, he can forever
convince those who doubt his rightful
claim to the title of'world's champion,
which he won from Frankie Genaro,
who "inherited" the title after the
death of Pancho Villa.
La Barba and Clark will furnish
quite a study in contrasts as they
square off in the roped arena at Madi
son Square Garden, New York, to
night. Fidel is just twenty-one, and
shows no marks from his twenty-five
professional fights; while Elky, who
is twenty-eight, is quite the opposite,
having a pair of nicely cauliflowered
ears, a wife, and'four children. (Don't
get me wrong on this last for Elky got
his cauliflowered ears from his forty
two fights,*not from his wife and four
children.)
It's been six months now since Fidel
has defended his title, and in staking
all in a battle, far from his native
California, with an opponent of Clark's
caliber, he shows that he is not a
dodging champion of the Dempsey

type, but one who can be counted on
to clean up the best in his division.
