# SYNOPSES OF JUNIOR OPERA MANUSCRIPTS DUE ON JANUARY 31
## 
### 
Only eleven days remain in which
authors may turn in synopses of their
plots of the Junior Opera, announced
R. Frank Baker, chairman of the com
mittee. These are due on January 31,
a week from Monday, and no plots
received after this date will be con
sidered.
A few manuscripts have already
been handed in, but more are desired
so that the committee will have a
number to select from. Plots revolv
ing around either a costume play or
a more modern musical comedy are
wanted, and anyone who has any ideas
is asked to turn them in to Baer at
Box 1357, Campus. Those who wish
to write the book of the play should
send a half act of dialogue along with
their synopsis to show their ability in
this sort of writing.
Herbert A. Klein, chairman of the
music committee, has announced that
several melodies have been received
by him. However, many more are
asked for, particularly character spe
cialties to which humorous lines may
be attached.
NO deadline has been sot as yet for
the receipt of musical compositions,
but they will be called for soon after
the book for the play has been chosen.
Composers should send in their con
tributions as soon as possible to
Klein,'Box 1842.
