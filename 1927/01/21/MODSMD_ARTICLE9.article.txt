## 
### 
Bodies of two unidentified boys
about fourteen and sixteen years old,
thought to be brothers, were found
yesterday afternoon floating in Felt
Lake, three miles northwest of the
campus. The bodies were found by
campus police authorities, after being
notified by a laborer. The only marks
of identification were the initials TJC
on the sweater of one and JH on the
handkerchief of the other. The coroner
stated that the bodies had probably
been in the water about a week.
When found the bodies were in shal
low water twenty-five or thirty feet
from the shore, and the pants of the
boys were rolled to their knees, which
led authorities to believe that they
had been playing on a raft on the lake.
The younger one was wearing a
brown slipover sweater, was about
five feet six inches tall, had long hair
and a prominent pug nose. He was
wearing a tan shirt.
The other was about five feet ten
inches in height and was wearing
a blue shirt. Both boys were
wearing ordinary dress pants and had
belts exactly alike. They were both
dark and it was thought that they
might be Italians.
The bodies were brought to Hap
good and Rollers undertaking parlors
in Palo Alto until the inquest.
