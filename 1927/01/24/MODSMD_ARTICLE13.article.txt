"Christianity is a great spiritual,
sporting, social adventure." This was
the theme of the sermon given by the
Reverend C. S. S. Dutton, minister of
the First Unitarian Church in San
Francisco, at the Memorial Church
yesterday.
The Reverend Dutton pointed out
that the gospel is not a sermon, a
treatise on religion, theology, or philo
sophy, nor a code of ethics, but a
story abounding in parables. The Bible
itself is a parable, revealing the es
sence of creative life. It is not a
verbal campaign, but an account in
which work done and life lived over
shadow everything.
"To Christ, discipleship was a costly
personal exploit. That defines Christi
anity. It requires bravery to under
take such a life, and fortitude to con
tinue it.
"Jesus dealt with meji where they
were. He had no system to which
they all had to conform. He invited
them into a spiritual adventure in a
hitherto untried way of living.
"Christianity," he said, "has devel
oped from vitality into rigidity. The
one utter heresy in religion is to be
lieve that we have reached finality,
and can settle down comfortably with
a completed system. There is no safe
ty nor strength in finality. The call is
not to something final, but to creative
life."
