# ARNTZENIUS SISTERS TO SING FOLK TUNES OF EUROPEAN PEOPLE
## Repertoire Taken from Eight Countries; Accompanied By Dancing 
### 
Entertaining with folk-songs and
dances, the Misses Peronne and Con
stance Arntzenius will appear on the
Tuesday evening program in the Little
Theatre at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
night.
The entertainers, who are twin sis
ters, are known in the United States
and in Europe for their repertoire of
folk-songs of eight European coun
tries, which they give in the original
language.
On a previous tour of the United
States the dancers appeared before
many university audiences, including
Vassar, Smith College, the University
of California, and Stanford.
As their names might indicate, the
twins are of French and Dutch par
entage. They are the daughters of
Abraham Robert Arntzenius, Secre
tary of the Second Chamber of States
General, The Hague, Holland. The
mother was Constance Boddaert, a
descendant of the old French nobility,
whose ancestors fled to Holland dur
ing the days of the Hugenots.
