LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23.—Staging
second-half comebacks in two games
Stanford was able to win from South
ern California but dropped its return
game with the Southern Branch, on
Friday and Saturday nights, respec
tively. The Cardinals defeated U.S.C.
in an overtime period, 28 to 27, and
lost to the Bruin team, 23 to 21.
Rallies Powerful
In each game the Cardinals trailed
at half time but by powerful rallies in
the closing minutes of play showed
themselves as possessing a rallying
ability hitherto only suspected. In
both contests the work of Bryant,
Cardinal forward, and Anderson,
standing guard, stood out conspicu
ously.
It was Bryant who, late in the extra
period of the Trojan game, sank his
second of two free throws to put the
Cardinals ahead —a feat which even
tually spelled victory. It was Ander
son, who during the entire second
half, time and again checked U.S.C.
rushes for the Cardinal basket. With
Vincenti, he held U.S.C. rushes to
snatch the game by a last-minute
basket.
U.S.C. Leads
U.S.C. led at half time with sixteen
points to Stanford's eight. Bryant and
McCandless led the Cardinal attack
which eventually ran up twenty points
for Husky Hunt's squad. For the Tro
jans, Badgro, speedy forward, was a
continual threat, and Laranetta held
his own with the best of them in the
rough play of the overtime period.
The following evening again saw
the Cardinals trailing at half time,
scoring but nine points to nineteen
for the Southern Branch. Ketchum and
Armstrong proved to be practically tho
j whole show for the Bruins, the for
; mer tallying ten points.
| The Branch opened the second
| period with a stalling game, slowing
j down the game considerably before
I the Cardinals could get going. When
! Hunt's men did unlimbor their attack,
they scored twelve points as against
four for the Bruins. Dobson, alternat
ing with Jayred at the center berth,
was one of the main cogs in the Cardi
nal running attack.
Stanford's foul-shooting was a fac
! tor which almost won that game: the
Cards sank seven fouls out of eleven
; tries, while the Branch converted but
j three out of ten tries.
