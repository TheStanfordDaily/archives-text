# Professing, As It Is Done

### 
"The professor has slid "from the upper stratum of society down
almost to the bottom of the middle class," claims Dean Otto Heller of
Washington University in an article appearing in a recent issue of The
Scientific Monthly.
Dean Heller notes with alarm and disfavor that the scholarly type of"
college instructor is being replaced by one who thinks and acts like a
successful business man. He fears that this change, aside from lowering
the social status of the professors themselves, is exerting a bad effect
upon college students. He believes that an interest in knowledge for its
own sake will disappear and instead will come a desire for that type of
learning only which brings monetary reward.
Going into more detail concerning the change in faculty types, Heller
says,"The professor used to be alien to the pastures of the Elks, Moose,
Buffalos, Bulls, and Bears, but now he is 'hail fellow well met.' He fre
quently lectures to thee on the psychology of salesmanship, or the human
side of retailing. Townsfolk no longer shrink from his portentious
erudition. He can talk on subjects dear to Kiwanian Hearts, the sporting
page, the late quotations, golf scores, radio news, and The Saturday
Evening Post.
Reading Dean Heller's remarks one cannot help but find in them con
siderable truth, and for his opinions considerable justification. The
regrettable situation upon which he is commenting is much less acute
at Stanford than at other universities. But it is becoming worse here
with each passing year. It is resulting in the steady growth of the idea
that the function of an education is to prepare the student for a life of
financial success rather than a life of intellectual enlightenment and
enjoyment.
It is hard to see to what desirable end this new philosophy of educa
tion is going to lead. A man goes to a university and there masters some
profession or business that is highly remunerative. In the event that he
earns a great deal of money he is at a loss to know what to do with it.
Being himself an uncultured individual he has no great appreciation for
the scholarly life and he insists that his children follow in his footsteps
and attain a "practical" success. The thing goes on, in a vicious circle.
It is our opinion that the problem is to be solved, if at all, by a move
ment upon the part of the students themselves. Trustees and regents of
universities have shown no disposition to do anything about it. (Most of
them are themselves successful business men.) College professors are
apparently of little or no value for the reason set forth by Dean Heller,
to-wit: that those professors who would teach the value of cultural
development are rapidly being replaced by synthetic business men turned
out by so-called "schools of business."

them are themselves successful business men.) College professors are
apparently of little or no value for the reason set forth by Dean Heller,
to-wit: that those professors who would teach the value of cultural
development are rapidly being replaced by synthetic business men turned
out by so-called "schools of business."
"The professor has slid "from the upper stratum of society down
almost to the bottom of the middle class," claims Dean Otto Heller of
Washington University in an article appearing in a recent issue of The
Scientific Monthly.
Dean Heller notes with alarm and disfavor that the scholarly type of"
college instructor is being replaced by one who thinks and acts like a
successful business man. He fears that this change, aside from lowering
the social status of the professors themselves, is exerting a bad effect
upon college students. He believes that an interest in knowledge for its
own sake will disappear and instead will come a desire for that type of
learning only which brings monetary reward.
Going into more detail concerning the change in faculty types, Heller
says,"The professor used to be alien to the pastures of the Elks, Moose,
Buffalos, Bulls, and Bears, but now he is 'hail fellow well met.' He fre
quently lectures to thee on the psychology of salesmanship, or the human
side of retailing. Townsfolk no longer shrink from his portentious
erudition. He can talk on subjects dear to Kiwanian Hearts, the sporting
page, the late quotations, golf scores, radio news, and The Saturday
Evening Post.
Reading Dean Heller's remarks one cannot help but find in them con
siderable truth, and for his opinions considerable justification. The
regrettable situation upon which he is commenting is much less acute
at Stanford than at other universities. But it is becoming worse here
with each passing year. It is resulting in the steady growth of the idea
that the function of an education is to prepare the student for a life of
financial success rather than a life of intellectual enlightenment and
enjoyment.
It is hard to see to what desirable end this new philosophy of educa
tion is going to lead. A man goes to a university and there masters some
profession or business that is highly remunerative. In the event that he
earns a great deal of money he is at a loss to know what to do with it.
Being himself an uncultured individual he has no great appreciation for
the scholarly life and he insists that his children follow in his footsteps
and attain a "practical" success. The thing goes on, in a vicious circle.
It is our opinion that the problem is to be solved, if at all, by a move
ment upon the part of the students themselves. Trustees and regents of
universities have shown no disposition to do anything about it. (Most of
them are themselves successful business men.) College professors are
