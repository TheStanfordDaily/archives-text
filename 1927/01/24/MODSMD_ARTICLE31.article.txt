"SO I TOOK THE HUNDRED DOL
LARS "
Try to picture, if you can, ninety
six swimmers starting from Catalina
Island to cross twenty-odd miles of
cold and treacherous water while Wil
liam Wrigley debated with his ad
visors concerning the advisability of
awarding a prize to the winner.
If you are able to do this, you are
ready for the second exercise. Close
your eyes tightly and conjure up an
image of the best scribes on the cam
pus sitting down for a hard siege
with their typewriters while the
Junior Opera Manuscript Committee
and the Dramatic Council discuss the
possibility, if any, of their offering a
prize to the author of the best book
for the 1928 class opera.

It's pretty hard to do, isn't it? Yet
this is just what the present opera
committee is doing. It only goes to
show that, whatever may be its short
comings, this committee leads the
field in imaginative powers.
In years past it has been the cus
torn to award the gifted soul whc
wrote the junior opera manuscript
with something more than mere pub
licity. The amount of the prize
varied. Last year it was one hundred
dollars.
At the risk of appearing unkind
may we hazard the opinion that the
award of a prize has not always re
suited in stimulating the creation ol
a literary gem. How then, may it be
expected that a masterpiece will be
forthcoming this year if the prize be
withdrawn?
