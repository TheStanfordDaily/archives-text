NOTES ON DEMOCRACY, by H. L.
Mencken; Albert A. Knopf.
PREJUDICES, FIFTH SERIES, by
H. L. Mencken; Albert A. Knopf.
Mr. H. L. Mencken seems to be
browbeating the yokels again. What
an inglorious and sodden world this
must be, if one accepts the conclu
sions of thi6 gentleman! We must be
tottering indeed on the edge of a dark
abyss, and are prevented from falling
therein only by the miracle that takes
care of infants in automobile accidents
and railway wrecks.
One comes to the conclusion that
this writer represents a certain type
of mind. It is evidently a type born
without the capacity of "reasonable
ness," which Matthew Arnold de
scribed as the essential attribute of
the personality of Jesus Christ. It is
not a comprehensive mind, even
though it has, in the case of Mr.
Mencken certainly, an immense capa
city for cataloguing fact and senti
ment. It runs amuck when it comes
to relations and inferences, which
dawn upon it so greatly as to force
the immediate incident out of focus
and give it an importance which it
lacks in the universal balance.
Examples of this sort in Mencken's
writing are too numerous to quote;
they are exaggerated, moreover by a
defective dislike of mankind. His mind
is naturally misanthropic. It is only
natural to believe that this mind does
not see wholly, though at times it may
see very clearly. For the young and
ill-informed mind, however, it is likely
to be drastice medicine, and becomes
a gospel without a vision to take care
of the years to come.
"The Notes of Democracy" contains
the final, devastating, brilliant explo
sive, fundament-racking conclusions of
H. L. Mencken, Critic of the Ameri
can Demos Extraordinary.

It is perhaps enough to say that it j
is an attack in the usual force on the '
foolish institution which we have be
lieved in since the signing of the
Declaration of Independence—namely,
democracy as we understand it; 110
remedy is suggested, as Mr. Mencken
himself admits, because, as he says,
he is only a pathologist and not a
practitioner. One might suggest that
while the world needs its practition
ers; pathologists are to be found on
every street corner —and as Mr.
Mencken might say, in almost every
Pullman smoker.
As to "Prejudices, Fifth Series" —it
is an interesting collection of essays I
on various subjects—literary, political,
musical, and otherwise. Interesting, I
may add, as Mr. Mencken, rarely, if
ever, forgets to be. He is the publicist
par excellence; he knows his audience
as few among us do. But I fear it is
only when he forgets "these preju
dices" that he will get down to bed-;
rock. Personal impressions are in-'
triguing, but they are seldom final.
An essay on William Jennings 1
Bryan, now passed with all his virtues ;
and defects, seems to me to be an !
experiment in extreme savagery. Even
if the evil that men do lives after
them, it is doubtful if the world today '
is much disturbed by what William
Jennings Bryan once stood for,
whether it was for free silver or fun
damentalism. Doubtless be was a
pathetic figure in his last days, but
why not let it go at that?
One hopes that it is the intent of
Mr. Mencken to show the world its
wretchedness and moral sloth, and
thereby help to raise a wind that shall
iweep away the alleys of corruption. :
Otherwise, for the conventional read
er, at least, there can be little excuse
either for this matter or his method, 1

may hall his undoubted literary gifts, i

PREJUDICES, FIFTH SERIES, by
H. L. Mencken; Albert A. Knopf.
Mr. H. L. Mencken seems to be
browbeating the yokels again. What
an inglorious and sodden world this
must be, if one accepts the conclu
sions of thi6 gentleman! We must be
tottering indeed on the edge of a dark
abyss, and are prevented from falling
therein only by the miracle that takes
care of infants in automobile accidents
and railway wrecks.
One comes to the conclusion that
this writer represents a certain type
of mind. It is evidently a type born
without the capacity of "reasonable
ness," which Matthew Arnold de
scribed as the essential attribute of
the personality of Jesus Christ. It is
not a comprehensive mind, even
though it has, in the case of Mr.
Mencken certainly, an immense capa
city for cataloguing fact and senti
ment. It runs amuck when it comes
to relations and inferences, which
dawn upon it so greatly as to force
the immediate incident out of focus
and give it an importance which it
lacks in the universal balance.
Examples of this sort in Mencken's
writing are too numerous to quote;
they are exaggerated, moreover by a
defective dislike of mankind. His mind
is naturally misanthropic. It is only
natural to believe that this mind does
not see wholly, though at times it may
see very clearly. For the young and
ill-informed mind, however, it is likely
to be drastice medicine, and becomes
a gospel without a vision to take care
of the years to come.
