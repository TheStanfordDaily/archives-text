# FOOTBALL AND BOXING
## 
### Feg Murray 
Football seems to mix well with
other sports. In previous articles, I
have discussed various athletes who
have combined the gridiron game with
baseball, track and field, and golf. To
day let us look over a few pigskin
artists who can use their hands for
more than just throwing and receiving
forward passes.
It is a rule in football that the of
fensive linemen may not use their
hands. At New York University,
Coach Meehan has a big six-foot-four
tackle, who knows how to use his
hands in a most offensive way. But
not on tie gridiron, for Lassman, an
intercollegiate boxing champion, plays
quite within the rules, and plays very
well, too. It is in the ring that Al's
dukes are used so offensively. Four
first-round knockouts in an amateur

1 tournament have convinced A 1 that
there is a future in professional box
' ing for him, if he wants to follow such
; a "gentle career after three or four
years of football.
There have been plenty of other grid
stars who were fine boxers, and many
1 of them met with considerable success
| in their ring efforts. Monte Munn, for

instance, is much more famous as a
heavyweight boxer than he was as a
mediocre tackle at Nebraska. Vander
grift, a Yale tackle, acted as one of
Gene Tunney's sparring partners for
several days at Stroudsburg. And
"Duke" Sedgewick, Harvard tackle of
1918 or '19, was a splendid boxer.
Pythian, a University of Southern

California player, was good enough to
have the astute Jack Kearns as man
ager.
Sully Montgomery and Ed Garvey,
of Centre College and Notre Dame,
respectively, advanced well along as
prize-fighters, and one or the other of
them made the statement that boxing
was a picnic compared to a real hard
football game.
That's what "May" Stribling evi
dently thought, too, when she refused
to let her famous son, Willie, play
football at the Macon (Georgia) High
School. "Football," said "Ma," "is too
dangerous." And at that there have
been many more fatalities on the grid
iron than within the roped arena. But
how does "Ma" explain all the tack
ling that her son did when he fought
Berlenbach in New York?

Football seems to mix well with
other sports. In previous articles, I
have discussed various athletes who
have combined the gridiron game with
baseball, track and field, and golf. To
day let us look over a few pigskin
artists who can use their hands for
more than just throwing and receiving
forward passes.
It is a rule in football that the of
fensive linemen may not use their
hands. At New York University,
Coach Meehan has a big six-foot-four
tackle, who knows how to use his
hands in a most offensive way. But
not on tie gridiron, for Lassman, an
intercollegiate boxing champion, plays
quite within the rules, and plays very
well, too. It is in the ring that Al's
dukes are used so offensively. Four
first-round knockouts in an amateur

1 tournament have convinced A 1 that
there is a future in professional box
' ing for him, if he wants to follow such
; a "gentle career after three or four
years of football.
There have been plenty of other grid
stars who were fine boxers, and many
1 of them met with considerable success
| in their ring efforts. Monte Munn, for

instance, is much more famous as a
heavyweight boxer than he was as a
mediocre tackle at Nebraska. Vander

Gene Tunney's sparring partners for
