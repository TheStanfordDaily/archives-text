If a modern personification of
tho ancient philosopher with his
lamp would quit looking among
the "Greeks" for an honest man,

Every morning some of the
most alluring patterns of colle
giate neckwear are hung out in
the doorway by the proprietors
of the Encina Haberdashery for
members of tho fastidious 500 to
approve. Every evening these
same Fifth Avenue scarfs are
taken in by the proprietors of
the campus' only exclusive out
fitters anfl are counted, not to
see if any innocent member of
the Encina 500 has let his prin

"father's money" has gone across
the counter for it.
