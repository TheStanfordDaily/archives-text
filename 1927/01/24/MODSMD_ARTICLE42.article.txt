## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
Jan. 22. —Eighty-two varsity and frosh
candidates for track have reported to
Coach Hec Edniundson for the first
season's workouts.
Edmundson's big rub this year with
the varsity is going to be in the quar
ter-mile event. No former varsity men
have reported and only three or four
of last year's frosh team are on deck.
Out of this showing the slim mentor
must mold a team that can collect
points in the four-man relay.
In the field events Edmundson is
more confident. Herm Brix of football
and track repute will undoubtedly set
a new conference record in the shot
put, he declared.

"Dad" Butler held the first meeting of
his track men on January 17.
"Even though we have nine letter
men on the squad wo will have to
develop a whole track team," said the
Aggie coach. "We have nobody on the
squad to get excited about and the
result is that competition for places
will be harder than ever."
Training season Jn the northwest is
short in comparison with California,
so Coach Butler advises his men to
make the best of every minute avail
able.
