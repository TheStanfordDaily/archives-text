# SHEEP, GOATS ACT AS LAWN-MOWERS FOR CAMPUS GRASS
## 
### 
Three hundred and sixteen sheep
and four billy goats make up the
Board of Athletic Control's "automa
tic lawn mower," as disclosed yester
day in the latest counting by the Uni
versity shepherd.
Four Scotch collies assist the shep
herd in guiding the flock to and from
its meals and preventing it fr#>m eat
ing up too much of the scenery such
as shrubs and flowers.
The flock, which has been main
tained for the past ten years by the
Board of Athletic Control, has as its
duties keeping the grass in the sta
dium and athletic fields cropped low
and controlling the growth in other
campus fields as much as possible.
What few fields the woolly creatures'
appetites do not account for are con
verted into hay.
Two of the goats belong to the chil
dren of one of the professors, but the
rest of the animals are a commercial
proposition, about 300 of them being
sold every fall.
When not in action on one of the
campus fields, the grass consumers
are to be found in their pens at the
Hoard of Athletic Control yard by the
highway polo field.
