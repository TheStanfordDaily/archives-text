# IN THE KNOW OF FASHION
## 
### Mademoiselle Chic 
Bonjour, mes clieres soeurs de Stan
ford! This morning I am making my
debut as la Chic of Stanford Univer
sity, and I am only hoping that my
few words on the modes of the com
ing season and the places where your
purchases may be made will be of
assistance in making you one of Stan
ford's charmingly dressed women.
"Clothes make the co'ed" might be
taken as the subject of my reflections,
and if Stanford women will only fol
low my fashionable arrow, the campus
will be covered with Jean Nashes.
Then, too, the Fashion Show is com
ing next quarter and my words will
be apropos of that event.
Lucien Lelong has declared le mot
d'ordre for Spring to be slenderness.
He says that the slimming magic of
cut, line, and technical proportion can
transform even a heavy figure. There's
hope, you see, even for Alicia Avoir
dupois.
Simplicity has become such a funda
mental rule of fashion that the ever
present silhouette varies from season
to season. Changes are now a matter
of detail and subtle feeling, and it is
of these small changes that I shall
write today.
An interesting feature of the new
spring frocks is the silhouette that
subscribes to fulness above the waist
line with slender, straight lines main
tained in the skirt. This fulness above
the waist-line is achieved in bloused
treatments of which the effect is made
more intriguing by intricacy of cut.
This air of fulness above the waist
line is often accentuated by a bolera
that stands away from the figure. The
bolero is a persistent note in the new
gowns, and unusual cuts and designs
are used to express that slenderness
of figure which is so desirable.
Where should the waist-line be?
That has been a pertinent question to
all well-dressed women, and even if
Clara Bow does wear short waist-lines,
it is not comme il faut as Paris would
have it. For the most part waist-lines
indicate a penchant for the top of the
hips, but let it be said for Clara, that
there are examples of a mounting
waist-line. Two belts are sometimes
seen, in both inset and separate ver
sions, the upper one at normal waist
line and the lower at the top of the
hips.
The persisting bolero gives a subtle
hint of a raised waist-line in that it
curves or slants toward the center,
suggesting a chevron or a softly
curved outline.
Seaming, entre deux, cording, pleat
ings, and pin tucks are the smartest
daytime trimmings, and these are
used to describe slanting outlines,
chevron patterns, scalloped formations
and simple straight lines. Geometry
is in Vogue.
Pastel Parchment is the most popu
lar color in footwear styles for spring.
Saks in New York are showing orchid
for Palm Beach, and it befits a chic
Stanford woman to be a New Yorker
in clothes if only for Half Moon Bay.
Shell grey and stone grey are next
in popularity, followed by Bois de
rose, white, and patent leather in
plain and colored trimmings. Kid leath-

I ers will lead in the better shoes, while
1 calfskin will be found mostly in the
cheaper and the sport shoes. Patterns
will remain the same with pumps, one
' straps, and tie effects leading. Step-in
pumps and sport oxfords are particu
larly appropriate for the campus.
"Moo Moo," said the cow as her
, little calf was led to the Hereford
| guillotine so that some smart co-ed
could have a chic coat. Calfskin will
take the place of the long-haired fur
in~coats. Interesting weaves in plaids !
and stripes predominate in fancy
j colors.
A fashionable milliner said to me
the other day: "Mile. Chic, do you
j know that this is going to be the
• biggest straw hat season since 1915?"
So I said: "Hey, hey, Charleston"—
even if the Black Bottom is the latest
stepper in terpsichorean circles,
j And so, rues cheres soeurs de Stan
ford, Mile. Chic must bid you farewell
with a wish for a well-dressed week
and a word for little Hiawatha —hm,
I such a dollick —et opp all de Stenford
i hepple-sauce.

Bonjour, mes clieres soeurs de Stan
ford! This morning I am making my
debut as la Chic of Stanford Univer
sity, and I am only hoping that my
few words on the modes of the com
ing season and the places where your
purchases may be made will be of
assistance in making you one of Stan
ford's charmingly dressed women.
"Clothes make the co'ed" might be
taken as the subject of my reflections,
and if Stanford women will only fol
low my fashionable arrow, the campus
will be covered with Jean Nashes.
Then, too, the Fashion Show is com
ing next quarter and my words will
be apropos of that event.
Lucien Lelong has declared le mot
d'ordre for Spring to be slenderness.
He says that the slimming magic of
cut, line, and technical proportion can
transform even a heavy figure. There's
hope, you see, even for Alicia Avoir
dupois.
Simplicity has become such a funda
mental rule of fashion that the ever
present silhouette varies from season
to season. Changes are now a matter
of detail and subtle feeling, and it is
of these small changes that I shall
write today.
An interesting feature of the new
spring frocks is the silhouette that
subscribes to fulness above the waist
line with slender, straight lines main
tained in the skirt. This fulness above
the waist-line is achieved in bloused
treatments of which the effect is made
more intriguing by intricacy of cut.
This air of fulness above the waist
line is often accentuated by a bolera
that stands away from the figure. The
bolero is a persistent note in the new
gowns, and unusual cuts and designs
are used to express that slenderness
of figure which is so desirable.
Where should the waist-line be?
That has been a pertinent question to
all well-dressed women, and even if
Clara Bow does wear short waist-lines,
it is not comme il faut as Paris would
have it. For the most part waist-lines
indicate a penchant for the top of the
hips, but let it be said for Clara, that
there are examples of a mounting
waist-line. Two belts are sometimes
seen, in both inset and separate ver
