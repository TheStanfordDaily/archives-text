# JOINT CONCERT PRODUCES MANY COLORFUL NUMBERS
## 
### Herb Klein 
Stanford's Glee Club, in joining with
the University of California's singers
in the joint concert given in the As
sembly Hall last Saturday night, in
sured a far more successful recital
than would have otherwise been pos
sible. Thanks to the somewhat novel
scheme of two glee club organizations
singing alternately and in unison,
there was fortunately no need to de
pend upon the individual soloists for
variety.
Comparisons are odious, but it must
be admitted that the California club
was a better vocal ensemble than
Stanford. All in all the Berkeley men
seemed better drilled and more tho
roughly acquainted with their music.
The California club shone especially
in "Goin* Home," a setting of the
familiar Largo from Dvorak's "New
World Symphony." In this their tone
was rich and their rendering of the
difficult harmonies very satisfying. It
seemed from the program that for
once a Glee Club concert was to be
given without the old familiar "Old
Man Noah," but the Blue and Gold
club changed the schedule especially
so that Stanford might heard this
humorous number â€”and they did it

very excellently indeed.
Comparing again, Stanford must bo
awarded the palm for selection of am
bitious aityl out-of-the-ordinary num
bers, meaning the eerie "Dirge for
Two Veterans" with its accompani
ment of dissonant bugles and drums.
If ever a vocal composition was able
to inspire spinal shivers, this is the
one. Finale from"The Gondoliers," a
snappy Gilbert and Sullivan selection,
also was a worth-while choice, but the
rendition could have been greatly im
proved by more practice.
Both the piano and violin soloists
were uninspired, and far less interest
ing than the club singing. Marie de
Forest Emery sang a group of songs,
but was at her best as solo voice in
the Stanford Club's rendition of "Loch
Lommond."
The finale number with the two
clubs together was a thrilling rendi
tion of "Suomi's Song." In all the
joint numbers one of the two clubs
was always under the handicap of an
unfamiliar director, Professor Mc-
Whood of California and Mr. Allen
of Stanford conducting the opening
and closing ensembles respectively.
Under these conditions the joint ren
dering was creditable.
