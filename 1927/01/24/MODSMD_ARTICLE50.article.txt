Popular fiction may rule that all polite
men favor fair-skinned maidens, but an
authority of 110 mean repute has come
forward with proof that it takes a wide
eyed brunette to make a man's heart
really flutter.
Basing her statement on experience,
Mrs. Nellie B. Stull, national president
of the Widows and Widowers' Club of
America, says that the male sex may
play around with blondes, but when they
choose life partners they generally pre
fer to trust a brunette.
The Widows and Widowers' Club is
made up of hundreds of "lonesome" men
and women throughout America, so its
president is a past master in analyzing
affairs of the heart.
Now the great majority of the local
"500" have a new argument to use
against their peroxide sisters.
