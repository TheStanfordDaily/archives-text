# California Track Coach Predicts Success for Team
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 22â€”Coach Walter
Christie ushered in the 1927 track sea
son at the University of California
with a few words of wisdom to a
hundred and fifteen aspiring freshmen
and varsity candidates.
The Bear mentor, who is commenc
ing his twenty-seventh year as track
coach at Berkeley, predicted that the
ensuing season would be one in which
several accounts would be evened. The
defeat of the Stanford tracksters and
the humbling of the U.S.C. national
champions is far from impossible with
the present array of talent.
