# Columbia Considers Adding Film School to Curriculum
## 
### 
With universities training their stu
dents for nearly every possible line of
work, Columbia University is consid
ering the addition of a film school to
its curriculum. Financial reviews re
port the movie industry as third most
profitable in the country, and Presi
dent Nicholas Murray Butler has ap
pointed a faculty committee to make
a report on the possibilities of such a
department. A joint committee, ap
pointed by Dr. Butler and by Will
Hays, representing the producers, will
make a final report on the subject.
