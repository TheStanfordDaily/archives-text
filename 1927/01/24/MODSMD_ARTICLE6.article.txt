# CARD FRESHMAN FIVE LOSE EXTRA-PERIOD CONTEST TO SAINTS
## Teams Deadlocked at 21-21; Field Goal by Simas in Play-off Wins Game 
### 
Instead of getting victory in the
extra five-minute playing period as
their varsity brothers did, the babe
basketball team lost to the St. Mary's
freshman quintet Friday night by the
score of 24-23,
Both teams were evenly matched
throughout the game which ended in
a 21-21 deadlock. At the beginning of
the extra five-minute period, Bush,
Cardinal center, made one basket
which gave the yearlings a two-point
lead. In the next few plays a foul
was called on Thompson, who was
guarding for the babes. Nousnan of
St. Mary's aggregation reduced this
lead to one point by a well-placed
shot. Both teams battled on a par for
the next three minutes and it looked
as if the final outcome would be in
favor of Coach Hunt's men by one
point.
St. Mary's Star
But it was Simas, flashy forward of
St. Mary's, who turned defeat into
victory for his team by making a field
goal in the last one-half minute of
play. The final score stood 24-23.
The yearlings surpassed the St.
Mary's team when it came to passing
the ball and floorwork. The Oakland
college five was built around one man
who proved himself to be the star of
the evening. It was Simas this and
Simas that whenever his teammates
worked the ball into the freshman
territory and Simas generally carried
through by making the desired goals.
