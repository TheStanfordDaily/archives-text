score of 24-23,

throughout the game which ended in
a 21-21 deadlock. At the beginning of
the extra five-minute period, Bush,
Cardinal center, made one basket
which gave the yearlings a two-point
lead. In the next few plays a foul

guarding for the babes. Nousnan of
St. Mary's aggregation reduced this
lead to one point by a well-placed
shot. Both teams battled on a par for
the next three minutes and it looked

favor of Coach Hunt's men by one
point.

victory for his team by making a field
goal in the last one-half minute of
play. The final score stood 24-23.

Mary's team when it came to passing
the ball and floorwork. The Oakland

worked the ball into the freshman
territory and Simas generally carried
through by making the desired goals.

foul shots.

j yearlings, showed a marked ability of
getting the ball out of Stanford terri

called for the personal foul in the
extra five minutes.
