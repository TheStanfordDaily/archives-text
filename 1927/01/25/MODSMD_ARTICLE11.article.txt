Phi Kappa Sigma and Sigma Nu
fought the only close contest yester
day in the Intramural basketball play,
while five other games were complete
walkaways. Phi Gamma Delta won by
default from Theta Delta Chi. Sensa
tional shots featured most of the
games.
In the first contest of the afternoon,
the Phi Kappa Sigma team put an end
to the undefeated record held by the
Sigma Nu quintet, winning out in the
last thirty seconds by a score of 17
to 15. At half time the score stood
10 to 10, the Phi Kaps coming up
with a rush just before the end of the
period.
Starting the last half, Evans of
P.K.S., put his team in the lead with
a field goal from the center of the
floor, and Renzel tied the score a
moment later with a short shot. Saun
ders and Dyer each tallied foul shots
in the next few minutes, and the score
was again tied. The two squads fought
hard until the last half minute, when
Saunders dropped a long field shot
through the hoop. Evans was high
point man with eight tallies to his
credit.
El Tigre Beats Basement
Encina basement was smothered by
El Tigre in the next tussle by a score
of 11 to 1. The game was poorly
played, both teams passing and shoot
ing poorly. Levitt scored Eneina's lone
tally in the first period after being
fouled. Mitchell and Henderson played
the best games.
Encina Wins Again
Encina 2W made it two straight in
the final game, drubbing Kappa Alpha
by a score of 15 to 4. The freshman
boys completely outplayed the Row
team, the latter being able to make
but one field goal in each half. Hart
zell, Allendorf, and Crowson were the
main factors in the defeat of the fra
ternity men.
Junipero Serra completely over
