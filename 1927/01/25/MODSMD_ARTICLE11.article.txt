walkaways. Phi Gamma Delta won by

games.
In the first contest of the afternoon,
the Phi Kappa Sigma team put an end
to the undefeated record held by the
Sigma Nu quintet, winning out in the
last thirty seconds by a score of 17
to 15. At half time the score stood
10 to 10, the Phi Kaps coming up
with a rush just before the end of the
period.
Starting the last half, Evans of
P.K.S., put his team in the lead with
a field goal from the center of the
floor, and Renzel tied the score a
moment later with a short shot. Saun
ders and Dyer each tallied foul shots
in the next few minutes, and the score
was again tied. The two squads fought
hard until the last half minute, when
Saunders dropped a long field shot
through the hoop. Evans was high
point man with eight tallies to his
credit.
El Tigre Beats Basement

the final game, drubbing Kappa Alpha
by a score of 15 to 4. The freshman
boys completely outplayed the Row

main factors in the defeat of the fra
ternity men.
Junipero Serra completely over
whelmed Encina 4E with a 28 to 12
score. Both teams started off evenly,
but Guthrie soon took the lead to the
club f by sinking one basket after an
other. Before the evening was over,
he had accounted for 12 points. The
winners played a fast floor game, using
a fairly tight defense apd a clever of
fense. The freshmen were allowed to
come near the basket, but they could
not make their shots good. After the
club had definitely obtained a good
lead, it started dropping in field goals
from all over the floor. O'Sullivan hit
the ball at the tip-off on the foul line
and dropped it squarely into the bas
ket.
Moore played a g&od game for the
freshmen, totaling six points. Both

game under the basket, but could not
stop the Junipero offense. Harlow and
Creagh also did some consistent
guarding under the club basket.

led Theta Xi 12 to f> at the end of the
first half. Stewart had accounted for
three goals, while Moore had raised
the total with two more for Kappa Sig.

was all he could sink for Theta Xi.

sure for a basket; however, every one
was a little off. When the last half
started. Anderson brought the score
to 12-8 with a clean goal. The T.X.'s
started down for their basket, but each
time a bad pass or a double dribble
broke up their offense. The winners
