# ORIENTALS COMMENT ON STANFORD STUDENT LIFE
## 
### 
Observations concerning Stanford
appeared recently in the Japan Adver
tiser, a Japanese daily newspaper
printed in English and published in
Tokio, as part of the impressions of
one hundred Japanese students who
visited America this summer, stop
ping at Stanford over August 13.
"America from the Viewpoint of Stu
dents" is the title of the article, in
which Stanford was the only Univer
sity given mention.
The tour on which'these impres
sions were gathered was under the
leadership of Kajyu mem
ber of the Japanese House of Repre
sentatives. The personnel included
students from the middle schools, as
well as a few from the universities
and primary schools.
One of the students describes his
visit to Stanford in the following
manner: "On the lawn, the president
of the University made a speech and
then he took us around the Univer
sity. He explained everything to us
but I did not understand a thing. I
thought it was very inconvenient not

Ito know English. It is said in this
country that young men and women
and even farmers who are not edu
cated in a university are regarded as
unworthy."
Describing his stay over night in
the home of a Stanford professor, the
student says, "When 1 arrived at the
home of tlie professor, his wife and
her two daughters came out to wel
come me. The professor luis t wo boys,
making six in the family.
"At the dinner table everybody
talked but 1 said nothing because I
could not speak English. The profes
sor's children were bigger than I and
i all talked with spirit. They seemed
very happy. Alter dinner we went into
a room where a violin, mandolin, and
i piano were played. Everything in the
â€¢ Western house is orderly.
I
"The professor's wife played piano
j and everybody sang songs in turn.
Then they asked me to sing. I sang
| the 'Song of the Sparrow' and 'Song
'of liice Planting.' After this dancing
was started to the piano music which
was accompanied by violin played by :
Mr. Terada. The professor and his
daughters and all danced. The pro
fessor took my hand to teach me to
dance. While I was dancing with one
of his daughters, I fell down. She
tried to pick me up and fell down, too,
making everybody in the room laugh.
After the entertainment, I took a bath
and went to bed."
Another of the visitors remarked, ,
"Modern Yankee girls are every
where, driving motor cars, in the li- j
braries, and wherever you Of i <
course their hair is bobbed. Some of
them were just like boys. Harold Lloyd
glasses were in fashion."
The complexions of American wo- j
men were considered remarkable for
their freshness by one of the boys, j
and he noted, "A woman in America
has precedence over men in all things, j
a custom that is never found in our i
country." He was not entirely pleased,
however. "American women in gen
i eral are too selfish and too active.
The dresses seem to have nothing to
i do with their conduct. At any rate it
! does not look well for a young woman
' to eat peanuts or apples as she walks
i along the street."
