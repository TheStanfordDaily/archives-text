# PENDAGRON PLAYERS TO PRESENT COMEDY AS NEXT PRODUCTION
## 
### 
The Pendragon Players of Palo Alto
will present "The First Year," a comedy
by Frank Craven, in the Palo Alto Wom
en's Clubhouse, at 8:15 o'clock Wednes
day and Saturday evenings. The produc
tion is under the direction of Margaret
Kissick.
Although the Pendragon Players have
in the past specialized in plays of the
heavier type, it was felt by the Players
that "The First Year," which ranked
among the finest of the comedies pro
duced last season, was well worthy for
selection both by way of merit and
variety.
The setting of the play is in the well
known American small town.
Tickets for the performances are at
sale at Crandall's and the Cardinal Ho
tel.
The cast is as follows:
Grace Livingston
Genevieve Rosemary Downs
Mrs. Livingston Mrs. Guido Marx
Mr. Livingston Mr. Guido Marx
Tommy Tucker Lynn Bramkamp
Dick Loring Norris James
Dr. Anderson Charles Brown
Hattie Mrs. Helen Niebel
Mrs. Barstown Amelda Davis
