# COLLEGE LIFE BESET WITH DANGERS SAYS STANFORD PROFESSOR
## Too Many Men and Women At Stanford Without Definite Purpose 
### 
I "There are a great many men and j
\ women at Stanford who have come j
I here without any particular purpose
in mind in getting a college educa
tion. They fulfill the necessary four
years' requirements and drift aimless
ly out again." This was the view ex
; pressed by Professor Walter G. Beach
j of the Department of Social Sciences
â€¢ in a talk to the members of the Stan
' ford Episcopal Club Sunday evening.
"College life is set with many dan
| gers. Many students go through the
' entire four years without succeeding
j in 'finding themselves.' Others are so
i wrapped up in their own selfish de
j sires and motives that they lose the
ability of coping with their fellow men,
J and go out into the world w r orse from
j their college experiences."
Professor Beach blames the require
j ments of Lower Division as being re
j sponsible for the fact that it takes
| most students so much time to decide
on a purpose in life. Those require
[ ments are like so many hurdles to
j jump, they disregard the significance
I of the subject in an effort just to get
| over the bar.
