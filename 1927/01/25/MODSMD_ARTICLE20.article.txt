# VARSITY PLAYS FRESHMAN FIVE IN SCRIMMAGE
## Cardinals May Have Had Off Night When Beaten by Southern Branch SHIFTS MADE IN LINEUP Vincenti Put in at Forward With Bryant as Mate; Team Goes Well 
### Fred Speers 
Off night? Well, maybe.
But it looks peculiar when six dif
ferent forwards are used in the first
half of a game in which the Cardinal
colors are sadly behind and none of
'em score.
That was the case in the first
period of the game with the Southern
Branch hist Saturday night which, in
cidentally, was won by the Bruins,
23 to 21. With an eye to introducing a
possible antidote, Coach Husky Hunt
last night sent his varsity basketball
squad through a scrimmage with the
freshman quintet.
Vincenti at Forward
Vincenti, who has thus far in the
season held down a running guard
berth, was last night switched to a
forward berth with Bryant as his run
ning mate on the other side of the
floor. McCandless has been the first
string starter at this position up to
now.
Starting against the freshmen at
running guard berth was Ted Shipkey
with Biaggini at the other guard posi
tion. Jayred began at center. Husky
Hunt later sent in a new team which,
with its experience at the regular
position, went much smoother than
the revamped starting quintet.
Varsity Barely Leads
Tt doesn't matter what the score
was, though the varsity led by not a
too large margin, which was given to
the Stanford regulars by Bryant and
Dobson, who may be rated as among
the best basket shooters on the squad.
Captain David was later sent in for
Bryant and showed up well.
For matter of interest it might be
well to list Husky Hunt's present sup
ply of forwards. They are: Captain
David. Bryant, McCandless, Price,
Christ, and Sexson. With the addition
of Vincenti to the list, Husky Hunt
should be able to stop any further
occurences similar to that of the
Branch game.
