# Exposed to Learning

"There are a great many men and women at Stanford who have come
here without any particular purpose in mind in getting a college educa-!
tion," was the statement made by Professor Walter G. Beach of the
Department of Social Science in an address before the Episcopal Club.
Admitted! It is certainly true that about two-thirds of entering
freshmen come to a university with only a vague idea as to their future.
There are a few that know that they are talented along certain lines, and,
usually, they have decided before a family gathering previous to leaving
home that they want to study law, medicine, or some other profession.
But the large majority of students come to college with the purpose of'
finding out what the world has to offer. Some two-thirds of collcge men
and women enter an institution of higher learning for the expressed pur
pose of finding a life's occupation.
It is also true that many men and women leave collcge with about as
many ideas on the subject as they had when they entered the University.
But it must be admitted that no one can be exposed to learning for four!
years without having some of it "take." The student who graduates is at i
least broadened.
Many students do not go to college for the purpose of learning how |
to make a living. Their financial situation may be such tliat they do not
need to toil when college days have faded. Is there no place for a young
man or woman to go if they should wish to become educated? A college j
course should make the student enjoy life more, and appreciate learning, j
The lower division at Stanford is a step towards the correct goal, and j
yet Professor Beach says that lower division requirements are like so i
many hurdles to jump, they disregard the significance of the subject in an '
effort just to get over the bar. This may apply to some extent to those j
few that enter college knowing that they will graduate some seven or
eight years later with the degree of M.D., but even then, history, English,
and citizenship should not permanently injure even a doctor.
