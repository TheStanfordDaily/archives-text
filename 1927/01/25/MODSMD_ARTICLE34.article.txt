"WHAT TRICE GLORY" at
the Curran. William Fox's inter
preation of the great stage suc
cess of the same name. Destined
to be one of the leading screen
productions of 1927.
"CRADLE SNATCHERS" at
the Wilkes. This is the last week
of the comedy that responds to
loud, broad-faced mirth. None
wide of their mark.
"THE HOME-TOWNERS" at
the Alcazar. George M. Cohan's
popular farce presented by the
Henry Duffy players now in its
sixth week.
"THE LITTLE SPITFIRE" at
the President. Dale Winter plays
the leading role of the ex-chorus
girl who captures the scion of a
socially prominent family and
then keeps him in spite of the
efforts of the vamp who tried to
get him and failed.
Coming: "LOOSE ANKLES,"
beginning at the Columbia on
January 31. To those who love
something funny, no matter how
obvious or how low the source,
and to those who like gags, and
slap-sticked antics; this has
plenty of surprises.
Coming: IN THE
AIR," beginning at the Wilkes
January 31. Less than two months
out of New York. A chance to
see a musical comedy before the
songs become ancient.

Whatever you may thing about the.
films, they certainly have an ennobling
effect on women. Now there was our
old friend Charmaine Cognac, who
used to be no better than she should
be, or even that good, suddenly trans
formed into a paragon of French
maidenhood by the simple process of
turning "What Trice Glory" into a
motion picture.
Of course, you remember Charmaine,
the buxom little sweetheart of the
Marine Corps, who caused such a
ruction between Captain Flagg and
Sergeant Quirt that for a moment
even the war became a minor un
pleasantness. That was when "What
Priee Glory" was a stage play. Now
it has gone into the cinema.
If you cherish the original "What
Price Glory" as one of the noble plays
of our time, I feel you will have some
difficulty in escaping the feeling of
sacrilege when you watch the screen
version. Otherwise there is a great
deal to say in its favor.
""Technically it is in many ways an
admirable production. The war scenes
are, I suppose, the finest and the most
vivid over shown on the screen. Uut i

1 1 do not see how any admirer of the
| Stallings-Anderson play can watch (his :
picturization without annoyance. I
realize that many people will tell me
that a photoplay should be judged as
a film production, not as a reflection
j of something in another medium. But
j I object to the present version of
I "What Price Glory" not only because
, it fails to be a faithful transcription ,
!of the magnificent play, but also be- •
| cause it would have been so tremen
| dously more powerful if it had been
loyal to its original.
! I must admit that it was no easy
task to make this a good picture; for
; the producers were bound to be skat
ing on pretty thin ice all the time.
I Nevertheless, from my general indict
, ment, I would make an exception of
criticism and call "What Price Glory"
an excellent screen subject; one that
| gives you something to think about
. after you have left it. Few films do.
The two stalwarts of the marines,
Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt,
are well acted by Victor McLagen and
i Edmund Lowe. Charmaine is imper
; sonated with considerable talent by
Dolores Del Rio who gives an excel
lent idea of the aMdemoiselle d'Armen-
I tieres type of a girl. Some of the
! telling words of the play have befen
used in the sub-titles, and they are
splendid, especially where Quirt says
to Captain Flagg:
"Think fast, Captain Flagg."
There is no profanity in the sub-1
titles but in those scenes where Flagg 1
and Quirt clash —and there are not a i
few —the air is hot with expletives. ;
One has no doubt whatever about the
' utterances even though they cannot
be heard. These scenes rather pleased
than shocked the spectators on the
opening night of the picture at the
i Curran.
