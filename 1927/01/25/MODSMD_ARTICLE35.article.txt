# Notre Dame Wins Over Hundred Games at Home
## 
### 
Not. since 1905 has Notre Dame been
defeated in football on her own field.
Twenty-one years ago Wabash College
of Crawfordsville, Ind., won from the
Irish, 5 to 0, on Oarticr Field. Since
tlien Notre Dame has won more than
100 games on its own field without suf-,
fering defeat.
Several times in recept years Notre
Damo has trailed its opponents Into
the finnl periods of homo games. In
1021 a flashy finish gave lier a victory
over Nebraska before a home crowd,
and in 1925, the second half of the
home coming game opened with North
western leading the Irish 10 to 0. A j
touchdown in each of the last two j
periods saved the Cartier record.
