# STUDENTS STARTLED BY MUFFLED SHOTS SOUNDING ON QUAD
## Rifle Club Range Located Below Administration Building 
### 
Passers-by along the front of the
Quad will often be startled by rifle
shots apparently coming from under
their very feet. The Stanford Rifle
Club, with a membership roll of sev
ty-tive names, has its range in the
basement under the Administration
Building, where practice goes on at
all times in the day.
Founded during the World War,
■with its first range in the basement
of the Art Gallery, the range was
moyed later to the basement of En
tina, and then to a field adjoining the
*i«n's gymnasium. Six years ago it
was finally located in its present site
on the Quad. Affiliated with the Na
tional Rifle Association, the club
comes under the' supervision of the
director of civilian marksmanship, an
offcial of the War department. Last
year the government issued free to
the Stanford members some 27,000
rounds of ammunition, and a requisi
tion for the same amount has been
sent in this year. Added to the amount
bought by the students themselves,
40,000 shorts were fired during the
past twelve months. Winchester mo
dels .22 and .52, as well as the Army
Sprinfield, model 1903, are used.
The club's 50-foot range is turned
over on Thursday and Friday after
noons to the men, one of whom re
cently placed ninth in the national
tyro championship contest. The wom
en use the range Tuesday and Wed
nesdays, both in the morning and in
the afternoon. Nearly 10 per cent of
the "500" has a hankering for shoot
ing, as shown by the enrollment of
forty women in the club.
