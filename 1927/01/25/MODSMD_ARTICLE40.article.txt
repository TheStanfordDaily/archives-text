# RAINS CAUSE DELAY IN CONSTRUCTION OF EARTHQUAKE STATION
## 
### 
The recent wet weather retarded con
struction on the new seismometric station
on the hill back of the Lathrop residence,
which was expected to be finished by the
first of the year, so that it has progressed
wo further than the first pouring of con
crete for the foundations.
Funds to the amount of $25,000 for the
station, along with three others in the
bay region, were pledged a year ago by
San Francisco and Oakland organizations
interested in the earthquake problem, but
actual work did not begin until last quar
ter.
Instruments for the station, now in the
process of construction at Pasadena, are
of the type invented by Dr. H. O. Wood,
seismologist, and Dr. J. A. Anderson,
physicist, at the instigation of the Came*
gie Institution and installed in the Mt.
Wilson Observatory laboratories.
In co-operation with the stations to be
at the University of California, Lick Ob
servatory, and the California Academy of
Sciences at Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco, the new seismometer will be
used to locate the centers of earthquake
disturbances near enough to be of im
portance to the bay region.
