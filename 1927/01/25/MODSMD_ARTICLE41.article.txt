# GLENN HUNTER SAYS COLLEGE THEATRICALS NOT VERY VALUABLE
##

"No, college is not essential, not even
necessary to the young aspiring actress
or actor. The main thing is for them to
stajrt acting early in their 'teens," said
Glpnn Hunter, the star of "Young Wood
ley," in an interview in the McGill Daily.
"Too many seek the stage now just for
fun, not realizing the hard labor it is.
One must start early and work for many
hard, long years.
"Undoubtedly the college theatricals do
produce some playwrights and players of
note. They are beginning to do things,
and probably will more and more as they
advance, but mostly they arc hopelessly
amateurish and do not help young players
in the least. It docs not mean success on
the stage for any player to be able to
play in these college plays. The essence
of the whole thing is for the young aspir
ant who is really anxious to play on the
stage to play everywhere, all roles, get
ting experience and willing to work,
work, work."
