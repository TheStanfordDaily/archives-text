## 
### 
The tendency of French poets inter
ested in Oriental literature to make sin
cere attempts at writing like the Japa
nese is shown by Professor W. L.
Schwartz in an article in the current

"Revue de litteraturc comparee," a
French magazine devoted to research in
comparative lifcrature. He explains this
interest in the acquisition of a Japanese
technique as harmonious with the pres
ent reaction of French poets-~ngainst the
old-time extreme elaboration and over
development of poetic themes.
At first continental writers were con
tent to nse their native technique, but of
late a clear-cut aesthetic formula for imi
tations of certain Japanese verse forms
has emerged and is predominant today.
Having had first-hand contact with
Japanese literature. Professor Schwartz
gives many out-of-the-way details. One
fact disclosed is that Gabriele d'Annun
zio was the first European to attempt an
imitation of the actual Japanese style of
writing verse.
