# MISSOURI HAS OLDEST JOURNALISM SCHOOL
## 
### 
The University of Missouri boasts
the oldest and largest school of jour
nalism in the United States, 375 regu
lar students being enrolled this quar
ter. It has grown since its inaugura
tion in 1908 so that now one entire
building is devoted to its activities.
Ten faculty members teach nothing
but journalism.
Only juniors are eligible, and class
work is supplemented by reportorial
work on The Missourian, a newspaper
printed six days a week and covering
not only campus news, but metropoli
tan news as well. Every Saturday an
eight-page magazine supplement, writ
ten by mombors of the magazine ar
ticle class, is printed in connection
with the fegular edition.
