"College men are getting away from
1 the rtmgh stuff that they thought was
! collegiate in the past," declares R. E.
Topping, who has been head janitor of
| Toy on and Branner halls since 1924.
j "Stacking rooms used to be a favorite
I sport," said ".Toppy" and vividly de
j scribed talcum powder | glits, water bat-
I ties, apple throwing contests, and door
: thievery of the past.
The dormitory guardian believes that
\ the Stanford men living in the two new
i est halls have improved at least 50 per
j cent in the last two years and today are
j beginning to realize that they get more
I out of college by spending their time
! more profitably than acting like juveniles.
| He declared that there is a great deal
| less breakage in the halls than formerly
: and the undergraduates have more regard
i for personal property. According to
| "Toppy," the students now co-operate
j in a greater degree with the janitors and
I are more friendly, engaging in fewer
class feuds. "There is also a lot less
! drinking and partying," concluded
j "Toppy," "for all the boys seem to be
I making it like their own home."
