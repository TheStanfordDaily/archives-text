# Aeronautic Laboratory Acquires Bronze Plate
## 
### 
Carrying the words "Daniel Guggen
heim Aeronautic Laboratory," a bronze
plate was recently fixed over the west
elevation of the aeronautics building, fac
ing the foundry.
The plate is eight feet long and twenty
inches wide, and was designed by Profes
sor E. P. Lesley, director of the labora
tory, assisted by his office force.
Its present aged appearance was ef
fected by giving the plate a wash of
potash and bisulphide. The building and
the bronze plate are thus made to appear
of about the same age.
