### 
Encina 3E 2, Sequoia 111, 1
Japanese Club 2, Phi Gamma Delta 0
Encina 3E and the Japanese Club
emerged victors from the first two
matches of the intramural tennis tour
nament yesterday. The freshmen con
quered Sequoia 111 2 to 1, while Phi
Gamma Delta was defeated by the
Japanese Club 2 to 0.
Nelson Carter of Encina won the
first match from Fred Pepys <5-2, 4-G.
<5-1. The freshman easily took the first
w* j t and started out in the second by
losing the lirst four games. He took
the uext four, bringing the* set to
deuce, but fell down on the last two.
The last set was won without any
trouble at all. The second freshman
■win was accounted for by Don Alex
ander's defeat of A. F. Mack, 6-2, 6-4.
Alexander, although behind during
the second set, managed to finish well
without difficulty. Sequoia won the
doub sel 4,6Bv(blMCvSS4grascet;qta
doubles, 4-6, 8-6, S-6.
Fred Speers of Phi Gamma Delta
lost out to Masaru Horii, S-6, 4-6, 6-3.
Speers, put up a dogged fight through
out the entire game and, at the last,
repeatedly rescued the game from
point-match. Horii's returns were well
placed, although both men were ex
ceptionally careful with their place
ments. It was evident that Speers was
at a great disadvantage because of a
dislocated shoulder. Edwin Kitow tri
umphed over Sergius Klotz, 6-4, 6-3,
after a hard-fought game. The out
come of the game depended mostly on
the success of Klotz's smashing drives
from the net and Kitow's clever
groundwork. The winner barely kept
the lead throughout the match,
scarcely beating down Klotz's spurts
of speed to the net.

after a hard-fought game. The out
come of the game depended mostly on
the success of Klotz's smashing drives
from the net and Kitow's clever
groundwork. The winner barely kept
the lead throughout the match,
scarcely beating down Klotz's spurts
of speed to the net.
