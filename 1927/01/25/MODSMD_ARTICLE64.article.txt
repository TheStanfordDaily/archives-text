# GALILEO HIGH RATED POWERFUL OPPONENT FOR FRESHMAN SQUAD
## Hunt Employs Three Teams In Varsity Scrimmage; Show Up Well 
### 
The freshman basketball squad will
play the Galileo High School team,
last season's winners of the San Fran
cisco city league tournament, in the
pavilion at 8 o'clock tomorrow night.
Coach "Mugs" Mitchell thinks that
this will be the strongest team the
babes have met so far. "The outcome,"
said Coach Mitchell, "is doubtful for
a victory for the yearlings."
Scrimmage Varsity
Practice yesterday afternoon was
composed, for the most part, of scrim
mage against the varsity. In addition,
individual attention was given by
Coaches Hunt and Mitchell to passing
the ball. The beginners are trying to
develop into an offensive team. Their
weak points along this line showed
up in the game with the St. Mary's
freshmen last Friday. The coaches
are taking this opportunity of correct
ing them.
The first yearling team that scrim
maged with the varsity players was
composed of Berg and Stewart, for
wards: Bush, center; and Simpkins
and Thompson, guards. This team
played for about ten minutes against
the senior members of Coach Hunt's
squad and beat them by the score of
4-2. Berg and Stewart were going well
at getting the ball down the floor but
were not able to sink many of the
shots they tried.
The next babe team that went into
action was: Smith and May, forwards;
Rotliert, center; and Mann and Stein
beck, guards. Steinbeck showed up
well at standing guard, as did Rothert
at center. The varsity players made
five points to the yearlings' one.
Long and Lasley, forwards; Albert
son, center; and Garabotto and Raw
lins, guards, were the members of
the squad against which the varsity
made eight points to two. Garabotto
and Long were a combination that
was going well.
There is plenty of material on the
freshman squad for different types of
teams ranging from the fast offensive
outfit depending on speed to the slow,
teasing team that keeps the ball well
under cover. It is a problem to decide
on the different combinations offered.
If the babes round into an offensive
aggregation and maintain the same
fight that they exhibited Friday night,
the Galileo team will not find its way
to victory so easj'.
