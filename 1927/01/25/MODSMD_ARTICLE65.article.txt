# NEW STACKS ADD TO SAFETY, CONVENIENCE IN LAWYERS' LIBRARY
## 
### 
Since the installation of new steel
stacks in the Stanford Law Library
during Christmas vacation, the fire
hazard has been reduced to a mini
mum and access to the entire collec
tion of more than 32,000 volumes is
now possible.
Established in 1893, the library now
has complete sets of the English. Irish,
Australian, New Zealand, and Cana
dian reports and those of the Federal
Courts. Reports of the proceedings of
the American states, the Australian
states, and the Canadian provinces,
together with the standard encyclo
pedias, textbooks, and digests of legal
periodicals, make up the balance of
the collection. Frances E. Sheldon,
J.D., is law librarian.
"Reports of the Assises," by Clay
ton, is one of the oldest books in the
library. Measuring scarcely four by
six inches, the volume was printed in
1651. It is one of a collection of re
ports of English cases which contains
many rare books dating back to the
seventeenth century.
Sir Edward Coke, noted English
authority on law who gained renown
through his unraveling of the famous
"Gun-Powder Plot" in 1606, is the
author of a unique volume of deci
sions in verse. Legal precedences un
written in the form of jingles to com
mit to memory.
