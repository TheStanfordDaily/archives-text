# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
in 1922, at the National A.A.U. track |
and field championships in Newark,
New Jersey, the 100-yard dash was I
won in ten seconds by one "Robert j
McAllister, unattached, New York." j
McAllister, known then as the "Flying I
Cop" because of his sensational work j
as an indoor sprinter while a member
of the New York City police force, ;
had not been given much consideration
as a possible winner of a national
outdoor championship, due mainly to j
the fact that such men as A 1 Leconey, |
Bill Hayes, and Loren Murchison were j
entered. However, the sturdy cop beat j
them all with a fine, powerful finish,
and then, completely overcome with
joy and excitement because of his vie-1
torv, he seized one of his opponents ;
and gave him a resounding kiss.
The same Bob McAllister nearly
four and a half years later made a I
sensational come-back on the boards i
of the Twenty-third Regiment Armory
in Brooklyn on January 8 in the first

| indoor meet of the season. Running
without spikes, he won two heats of
i a handicap 100-yard dash in 10 1-5 see
in the final in the same time, after
: being set back a yard for "jumping
; the gun" and then fighting his way
| around several sprinters who had
! crowded over into his lane.
This come-back of the former na
! tional champion, who had been off the
; track for at least two years, was most
| surprising, and gave promise of even
I more sensational performances to
j come. Bob, by the way, is under the
i expert care of Jake Weber, coach at
Fordham University and trainer of
' champions since time immemorial.
It will be remembered that in his
; first indoor season of racing, the "Fly
i ing Cop" established four world's rec
ords within four months after he ran
his first race. His appearance on the
i boards this winter will add a lot to
what promises to be a mediocre sea
son. Â»
