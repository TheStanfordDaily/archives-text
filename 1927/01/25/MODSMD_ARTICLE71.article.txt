# SCHOLAR DECLARES CIVIL STRIFE WILL CONTINUE IN CHINA
## 
### 
That there will be no end to civil
war in China until exploitation by for
eign powers is ended is the belief of
Tao H. Lee, a Chinese student of the
University who spoke before the Cos
mopolitan Club last night in the Wo
men's Clubhouse.
The people's party in China now oc
cupies nearly two-thirds of the entire
area of the country and, according to
Lee, the people's army which consists
chiefly of students, workers, and peas
ants, will in time sweep away the
militarists.
Natives Not Hostile
In speaking of the prevalent idea
that the Chinese are anti-foreign, Lee
pointed out that, although they are
anti-imperialistic, the Chinese hold
ill-feeling toward foreigners only in so
far as they are exploiters.
"Missionaries are the forerunners of
imperialism, for Christianity in China
is a treaty-bound religion and is
backed up' by gunboats. Imperialists
use Christianity and missionaries as a
means for colonization," said Lee.
Foreigners to Blame
Referring to the recent outburst in
Hankow, Lee quoted Eugene Chen,
Chinese Foreign Minister, as saying
that there was no cause for the nerv
ous tension displayed by the foreign
residents of the city, inferring that it
was artificially stimulated by the
councils themselves.
"This has always been a cuuning
trick of the imperialists who want to
stir up the ill-feeling of the home
population toward China in order to
accomplish (heir aims. The simplest
way to do it is to authorize their
presses to say that the Chinese are
reds, that they are anti-foreign, and
that foreigners are ill-treated by the
