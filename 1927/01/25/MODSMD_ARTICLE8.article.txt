# COACH TEMPLETON SAYS TEAM NEEDS DISTANCE RUNNERS
## Milers, Two-Milers Start Strenuous Workouts On Old Oval 
### Joe Carroll 
Grind! Grind! Grind! Sixteen laps
for two-milers, and twelve laps for the
milers, was the program for yesterday
afternoon on the track. Coach Dink
Templeton is determined to develop
distance runners this season, and yes
terday as he watched the squad go
through their paces a satisfied look
came over the coach's face.
Hard Work Needed
Templeton realizes that hard work
is necessary. The Stanford track team
needs men who will be able to offer
some real competition in distance
events to runners from the University
of California, the University of South
ern California, and other teams that
will be met during the season. Hard
work now seems to be the only way
to fit men for the competition that
will he offr'red by Heilman of
U.S.C., Stevens and Fox of Berkeley,
and others.
Distance men are badly needed, as
are sprinters. The rest of the squad
shows signs of strength. Both hurdles,
the broad and high jumps, the discus,
shot., and javelin, have at least two
men who are capable of giving any
opponents a real battle.
Sprints Also Weak
The sprints are particularly weak
with no man on the squad who can
touch 10 seconds fiat in the hundred
or 22 seconds flat in the two-twenty.-
Although California faces a problem
somewhat similar, U.S.C. has three
sprinters who have broken both of
these marks. Last year Stanford only
got two points out of eighteen in the
sprints in the Trojan meet, which
gave U.S.C. a lead that was not over
come.
The pole vault, the quarter, and the
half, will be handled fairly well, but
plenty of further work is needed be
fore any real idea of the strength of
this year's team can be had. Coach
Templeton will hand out that work in
large quantities from now on.
