# SCRIBES BLOCK MANAGER PLAN; PROMISE PROBE
## Impromptu Meetings Bring Verbal Battles Among Publications Heads COMPROMISE PROPOSED Chaparral, Quad Approve of Maintaining Autonomy In Organizations 
### 
Campus journalistic circles were
thrown in a turmoil over the
proposed plan to reorganize campus pub
lications. Various official and unofficial
gatherings throughout the day expressed
severe opposition to the proposed con
stitutional amendment. At these gather
ings constructive and destructive criti
cism flourished.
Creation ot' the position of Publica
tions Manager to supervise the manage
ment of the four publications has met
■with almost unqualified disapproval. The
general publications fund proposal has
fared no better. Some managers have
countered with a plan to organize a Pub
lications Council composed of the cam
pus editors and managers who shall act
in an advisory capacity to all publications
but shall exercise no direct supervision
or direction over policy and manage
ment.
Chaparral Opposed
Hammer and Coffin Society has ex
pressed the most severe opposition to the
plan as the members feel that criticism of
the present method of management is not
justified. Contrary to this belief, Victor
Greisser, Manager of the Stanford
Daily, declares that such an official
would add stability to the publications
system and could carry through improve
ments over a period of years, which in
dividual managers have failed to accom
plish in the past. However, he agrees
with Tom Breeze, President of Hammer
and Coffin Society, insofar as disapprov
ing of the removal of the control of pub
lications from their individual managers.
Both think that each magazine should
retain its own autonomy as far as pos
sible, and Greisser believes the Publica
tions Manager should act only in an ad
visory capacity.
