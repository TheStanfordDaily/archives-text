# SCRIBES BLOCK MANAGER PLAN; PROMISE PROBE
## Impromptu Meetings Bring Verbal Battles Among Publications Heads COMPROMISE PROPOSED Chaparral, Quad Approve of Maintaining Autonomy In Organizations 
### 
Campus journalistic circles were
thrown in a turmoil over the
proposed plan to reorganize campus pub
lications. Various official and unofficial
gatherings throughout the day expressed
severe opposition to the proposed con
stitutional amendment. At these gather
ings constructive and destructive criti
cism flourished.
Creation ot' the position of Publica
tions Manager to supervise the manage
ment of the four publications has met
â– with almost unqualified disapproval. The
general publications fund proposal has
fared no better. Some managers have
countered with a plan to organize a Pub
lications Council composed of the cam
pus editors and managers who shall act
in an advisory capacity to all publications
but shall exercise no direct supervision
or direction over policy and manage
ment.
Chaparral Opposed
Hammer and Coffin Society has ex
pressed the most severe opposition to the
plan as the members feel that criticism of
the present method of management is not
justified. Contrary to this belief, Victor
Greisser, Manager of the Stanford
Daily, declares that such an official
would add stability to the publications
system and could carry through improve
ments over a period of years, which in
dividual managers have failed to accom
plish in the past. However, he agrees
with Tom Breeze, President of Hammer
and Coffin Society, insofar as disapprov
ing of the removal of the control of pub
lications from their individual managers.
Both think that each magazine should
retain its own autonomy as far as pos
sible, and Greisser believes the Publica
tions Manager should act only in an ad
visory capacity.
On the other hand, Greisser disap
proves of the common improvement fund
suggested for all publications, while
Breeze feels that such a fund would
serve a good purpose if controlled by the
Publications Council, and could primarily
aid in the future erection of a press
building.
Breeze agrees with Emerson Spencer,
editor of the Stanford Literary Maga
zine, that supervision of the campus pub
lications is not desirable. Both believe
that a Publications Council of the type
suggested would further co-operation be
tween magazines, but its function should
be purely advisory. No attempt should
be made by the council to direct cither
the editorial policies or the business end
of the magazines.
Quad Disapproves
Both Allan Klauber and Robert Para
disc, editor and manager, respectively, of
the Quad, believe that the crcation of the
position of Publications Manager would
Ik; inadvisable. They agree with Pjrceze
that the position would require a very
experienced man who could command a
good salary, and they question the ex
penditure as not being commensurate with
the services received. Klauber feels that
tlie salary of the Publications Manager
would be a drain upon the publications,
and he stoutly maintains that the posi
tion, if created, would become a political
plum and the Publication Manager would
Ik.- a creature of the powers who installed
him.
