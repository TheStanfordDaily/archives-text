Leading by one point al the half,
Phi Sigma Kappa was held scoreless
while the Encina 3W quintet piled up
14 points. This was the only game
yesterday in which any team came up
from behind to win or was closely
pressed to come out ahead.
El Capitan was held to one field
goal during the first period, when Se
quoia I was amassing nine points. In
the last half, the clubmen tied Sequoia
for points but because of their bad
start, lost out 16 to 8. Rode made all
the points for the losers, two free
throws and three field goals.
Branner Whipped
Allowing the Branner I team only
one basket in each half, Delta Chi
easily won 19 to 4. Paxton was the
outstanding player in the game, ac
counting for twelve tallies. Newcomb
and Burns played good games under
the hall basket, constantly breaking up
Sequoia plays.
In the last game of the afternoon,
Encina 3W was trailing Phi Sigma
Kappa 3 to 4 at end of the first
half. During the next fifteen minutes
of play, the freshmen made seven
goals, more than enough to Avin, since
the fraternity men were held score
less. Smith showed up well for the
winners; after missing one basket
after another in the first period, he
opened up and dropped in three clean
shots. Three more baskets were added
to the total by Speegle. Bradfield and"
Dietrich were able to stop every attack
of the losers, playing a consistently
good guarding game. For the frater
nity. Miller outshone his teammates.
Encina Rallies
Making a last-minute rally, Encina
2E made things look interesting for
Theta Chi. but could not overcome
the lead that the fraternity men had
piled tip. losing 20 to 15. Reasor was
high-point man of the struggle, ac
counting for ten points. Duncan, al
though not scoring as well, held up
his end of the forward positions with
a good measure of success. Helmke
held the freshmen all but a few times,
when the yearlings managed to wrig
gle past him.
Moore and Holman demonstrated
that they were a clever combination of
forwards, enabling Alpha Delt to down
Sequoia 17 to 5. Between these two
men. the winners were given fifteen
tallies, while Dennis held the Sequoia
forwards back with the help of Evans,
Alpha Delt standing guard. Fickert
was the outstanding man on the Se
quoia team, making up a good part of
the hall defense system. The game,
which consisted of one offense after
another, was scoreless for ten minutes
of play. From then on, one basket
followed another.
Zetes Win
Mostly through the efforts of Sibbett
and Marks, Zeta Psi triumphed over
Alpha Sigma Phi with an 11 to 3 score.
Sibbett brought in three field goals,
while Marks supplied most of the
fight. Campbell produced a good guard
ing game for the losers, but could not
hold off the fast advances of the
Zetes. Ferguson, as well as others of
the Alpha Sigs. tried long shots from
, all over the floor, but without much
: success. The Zetes, who had been
making their shots in from under the
basket, soon dropped their style of play
| and also tried futile long-distance
' work.
