# PRINTERS' BASEBALL GROUP CHALLENGES DAILY STAFF NINE
## 
### 
Conflict between the members
of the Stanford Daily staff and
the printers of the University
Press loomed yesterday when
challenge for a baseball game
with the staff members was made
by the printers. Carl Oliver, chief
linotype operator, is promoting
the printers' nine, "and promises
to decisively trounce the staff
players.
Members of the Daily staff feel
that they can win the game, for
which no date has as yet been
set, without difficulty. A baseball
game between these sets of
players was once an annual cus
tom, discontinued, so some of
the staff members insist, because
the printers were beaten too
easily, but Oliver claims that
this year the pen-pushers will
have to get in some good, hard
practice to show against the* ink
slingers.
