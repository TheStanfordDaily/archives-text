# FRESHMEN SET FOR GAME TONIGHT WITH FAST GALILEO TEAM
## Hunt Gives Babes Chance to Trim Champions of City League 
### 
Playing the only mid-week game on
the campus, the Cardinal freshmen are
all set to meet the Galileo High School
basketball quintet in the pavilion at 8
o'clock tonight in their seventh con
test of the season. So far the babes
have broken even, having lost three
games and won an equal number.
Galileo has a very fine bunch of
players and they are big, even larger
than our men, but if the freshman
squad gets going and shows the stuff
it is capable of. perhaps we can win,"
said Coach "Husky" Hunt yesterday.
Galileo won the San Francisco city
league tournament last year and has
not lost many players for this season's
games.
Practice yesterday constituted work
outs in "tip-off" shots, passing the
ball, and toss-up plays. In addition
Coach Hunt gave a blackboard talk
pointing out individual as well as
team defense tactics and illustrating
new plays.
Rothert is showing up well as center
and will push Bush to keep the posi
tion he now holds. Several other mem
bers of the squad who have shown
improvement lately are Hare, guard,
Smith, forward, Garibotto, forward,
and Steinbeck, guard.
The line-up that will start tonight's
game as announced by Coach Mitchell
is: Berg and Stewart, forwards, Bush,
center, and Thompson and Simpkins,
guards.
