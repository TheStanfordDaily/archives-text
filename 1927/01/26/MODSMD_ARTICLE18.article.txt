# Y.M.C.A. LAUNCHES FINANCE CAMPAIGN FOR NEW BUDGET
## DRIVE MADE FOR $1090 Organization Decides on Retaining National Affiliation 
### 
Financial support sufficient to make
up a budget totaling $1090 will be the
aim of the annual Y.W.C.A. drive
launched today. Proposed changes in
the name and form of the organiza
tion will not be such as to radically
effect the, present financial needs, as
items listed in the budget would be
essential to any group of this type.
The Y.W.C.A. says that national af
filiation, necessitating $150 national
dues, is invaluable, and will be pre
served in either its present regular
form or in an associate way by the
new organization. Unless the group
becomes purely local and self-centered,
the material and spirit given by the
national and international connections
is felt to be of greatest worth.
To reap the full value of national
and international fellowship the
Y.W.C.A. states that Stanford students
must be able to attend annual con
ferences where representatives of stu
dent groups throughout the world
meet to discuss their problems.
Another $75 of the international
dues is sent to Maud Russell, educa
tional worker in China, as Stanford's
share in her support which is fur
nished by Pacific Coast colleges. The
Remaining $175 goes to the Interna
tional Student Commission of the
World's Student Christian Federation.
Those in charge of the drive, which
will be held today, Thursday, and Fri
day, are Barbara Lee, Florence Cooper,
Bonny Deal, Alice Enderud, Victoria
Schuck, Jean Stewart, Elizabeth Bake
well, Helen Huneke, and Sallie Kins
man.
