# TIME SCHEDULE FOR LATE FEE PAYMENT ISSUED BY REGISTRAR
## 
### 
With the object of saving money
for the students by avoiding unneces
sary fines, the Registrar's office has
issued a "Stanford University Calen
dar" containing the times when vari
ous fees are payable and study lists
and other blanks are due.
"The purpose of the University,"
said Registrar J. Pearce Mitchell, com
menting on this calendar, "is not to
collect fees but to get things done on
time. Students each quarter pay in
large sums in fines which they would
not need to pay if they were prompt."
The new calendar has been distri
buted to all members of the faculty
and can be purchased by others from
the accountant's office at ten cents a
copy. It will be published next year
in August. The present sheet contains,
in addition to the significant dates for
the four quarters of the current year
a calendar pad for the year 1927 and a
calendar showing each month from
July 1926 to December 1927.
