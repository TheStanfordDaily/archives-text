# CAGERS SIM SCRIMMAGE IN NEW POSITIONS
## Coach Hunt Faces Problem Of Developing Accurate, Consistent Shots DAVID USED IN LINE-UP Kappa Sigs Meet Varsity In Practice; Vincenti At Forward 
### Fred Speers 
Practice for Coach Husky Hunt's
basketball varsity squad last night con
sisted largely of a scrimmage with the
Kappa Sigma intramural team, which
thus far has dropped but one game
in its league. With the plan in mind
of shifting Vincenti to a forward berth,
Husky Hunt figures that scrimmage
will be the best thing to accustom
men who have changed positions to
their new tasks.
Unless Spud Lewis returns for prac
tice soon, the Cardinal mentor may
be forced to play the lineups used
against the Trojan and Branch players
last week-end. Hunt had planned to
use Lewis in one or both of the
Nevada games scheduled for the com
ing week-end.
New Lineup Used
In scrimmage last night, the Cardi
nal lineup consisted of Captain David
and Bryant, forwards, Jayred, center,
and Shipkey and Biaggini, guards.
Price later went in for Shipkey at
running guard, and Christ substituted
for David, who suffered a slightly
sprained ankle. David's injury was
minor.
While in the game, Stanford's cap
tain showed some of the best playing
he has given evidence of thus far in
the season. His shooting has improved,
and he is handling himself in a much
more smooth fashion. Christ also went
well after going in for David.
Ned Anderson, regular standing
guard, was not present for practice,
but Biaggini, taking that position, took
care of the berth satisfactorily. Biag
gini, a junior with a year more of
competition, is perhaps one of the
most consistent men 011 the squad.
Husky Hunt's main problem is to
secure forwards who can shoot bas
kets in competition; at present, there
are plenty of forwards who can shoot
them in practice but when points are
needed, then comes the let-down.
