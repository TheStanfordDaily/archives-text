# Slow, Danger Ahead
## 
### 
I he appointment of a Constitution Revision Committee has already
been greeted with enthusiasm. The piecing together of a puzzle, so that
the result is clearly and easily understood, is indeed a feat. One can
always admire those who ?et out to attain a real accomplishment. But it
is not the way of the world to praise those who fail nor is there much
credit given fur partial success. This may be regrettable, but history
bears out the fact that it is only the conquerer who is crowned with
wreaths of glory.
In the distribution of praise and criticism a constitution committee
is not overlooked or excepted. Its task is a difficult one, and its position
is precarious.
So far the committee has received no praise for its work. Instead it
has been subject to criticism 011 the part of the campus journalists for
attempting to revise the publications system. But this condemnation has
for the most part been misdirected. It is not the aim of the revisions
body to make any radical changes. In fact, its policy, which was adopted
at the first meeting, w-ould prevent this possibility.
The committee as a whole does not plan to incorporate the publication
manager plan in the revised constitution. It is a suggestion of individual
members and is to be presented at the next student body election as an
amendment to the constitution under which the students are now
governed.
j While cleared of this implication, the committee still has many wor
rfes to look forward to. The constitution is overburdened with non
essential details of administration to the extent that it is unwieldy. In
fact, it is becoming antiquated and in parts obsolete. Imagine one para
graph that actually gives Dr. Barrow by name the power to grant
athletes permission to play with other amateur teams during the summer
months. Obviously at the drafting of the present constitution there was
no thought given to the fact that a replacement of Dr. Barrow was
possible. Nor was a possible accident to the man, as an individual, con
ceded conceivable.
This may be a glaring example of incorporating details of adminis
tration in the governing document, but there arc many others equally
unique.
A constitution which will set forth merely the fundamental principles
bv which the Associated Students will be governed is by all means the
attainment desirable. The details of the administration should be rele
gated to the by-laws.
' The passing of time, and with it the change in personnel of the campus
is bound to require a rearrangement of these details. Why at that time
should it be necessary for amendments or the adoption of an entirely
new constitution? A document stating the basic principles for student
government at Stanford could be made almost a permanent thing.
Should cause arise to make a minor change in the way certain duties
should be carried out, it would merely necessitate a change in by-laws.
Thus would be simplified the method of changes without throwing the
whole government into a state of uncertainty.
The nearness to the proposed goal the constitution committee attains
will measure the degree of its success.

' The passing of time, and with it the change in personnel of the campus
is bound to require a rearrangement of these details. Why at that time
should it be necessary for amendments or the adoption of an entirely
new constitution? A document stating the basic principles for student
government at Stanford could be made almost a permanent thing.
Should cause arise to make a minor change in the way certain duties
should be carried out, it would merely necessitate a change in by-laws.
Thus would be simplified the method of changes without throwing the
whole government into a state of uncertainty.
The nearness to the proposed goal the constitution committee attains
will measure the degree of its success.
I he appointment of a Constitution Revision Committee has already
been greeted with enthusiasm. The piecing together of a puzzle, so that
the result is clearly and easily understood, is indeed a feat. One can
always admire those who ?et out to attain a real accomplishment. But it
is not the way of the world to praise those who fail nor is there much
credit given fur partial success. This may be regrettable, but history
bears out the fact that it is only the conquerer who is crowned with
wreaths of glory.
In the distribution of praise and criticism a constitution committee
is not overlooked or excepted. Its task is a difficult one, and its position
is precarious.
So far the committee has received no praise for its work. Instead it
has been subject to criticism 011 the part of the campus journalists for
attempting to revise the publications system. But this condemnation has
for the most part been misdirected. It is not the aim of the revisions
body to make any radical changes. In fact, its policy, which was adopted
at the first meeting, w-ould prevent this possibility.
The committee as a whole does not plan to incorporate the publication
manager plan in the revised constitution. It is a suggestion of individual
members and is to be presented at the next student body election as an
amendment to the constitution under which the students are now
governed.
j While cleared of this implication, the committee still has many wor
rfes to look forward to. The constitution is overburdened with non
essential details of administration to the extent that it is unwieldy. In
fact, it is becoming antiquated and in parts obsolete. Imagine one para
graph that actually gives Dr. Barrow by name the power to grant
athletes permission to play with other amateur teams during the summer
months. Obviously at the drafting of the present constitution there was
no thought given to the fact that a replacement of Dr. Barrow was
possible. Nor was a possible accident to the man, as an individual, con
ceded conceivable.
This may be a glaring example of incorporating details of adminis
tration in the governing document, but there arc many others equally
unique.
A constitution which will set forth merely the fundamental principles
bv which the Associated Students will be governed is by all means the
attainment desirable. The details of the administration should be rele
gated to the by-laws.
