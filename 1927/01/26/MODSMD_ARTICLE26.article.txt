The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Quad believes the crea
tion of the position of Publication Man
ager to be inadvisable bccause of the
following objections:
1. An undergraduate could not fill the
position because he would lack the ex
perience and could not command the re
spect required to direct all four of the
campus publications. A graduate stu
dent would l)c undesirable because pre
vious service on certain campus pul lica
tions would have prejudiced him in their
favor. The position does not justify the
services of an outsider at a high salary.
2. If created, the position would be
come a political plum and the publica
tion manager would be a creature of the

| powers who installed him.
3. The salary of the publication mana
ger would be a drain upon the publica
i tions, taking a part of what is now used
i in their actual production.
4. If the publication manager were
! given dictatorial powers, the managers
and editors would lose the benefits which
j they now gain from the responsibilities
put upon them. If the publication mana
ger were not given tTlrse dictatorial pow
ers. he would become a mere figurehead.
i 5. Three of the four publications on
the campus arc opposed to the creation
of a publication manager who would
therefore gain little co-operation.
