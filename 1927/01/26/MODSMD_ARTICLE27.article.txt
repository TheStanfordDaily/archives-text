For the benefit of those Stanford |
women who feel that they were ma
ligned by the debater who was re
cently quoted in the Harvard Crimson,
the following is submitted. It is taken,
verbatim, from"The Californiac," a
column appearing regularly in The'
Daily Californian:
"Babbittry and Y.M.C.A. idealism j
fused into one the other day at a
Chamber of Commerce luncheon pro- !
during an aphorism which entails such
a dubious philosophy as to move even
the hardened Californiac to a diatribe j
of approbrium.
"The bloomer in question was the \
eminently pedantic revelation that!
'only through contact with th# beauti- j
ful do we ourselves become more l
transcendental and beautiful.' Through :
a syllogistic scheme of argument, this !
lovely bit of grammatical gymnastics
can be exposed as little more than ;
verbal garbage.
"Let us apply this profound observa
tion to our own little microcosm—the 112
campus world. Rolling hills, verdant ;
with the fresh greenery inspired by
the gentle rains from the great canopy
of the heavens —a sapphire bay
stretching ouC to the vast intermin
able ocean, picturesque with great !
ships bearing strange cargoes to un- j
known lands beyond the sunset —the
majestic dome of Tamalpais piercing
the marshmallow cloufls of sunny
California skies —a glistening shaft of
white stone standing sentinel-like
against the background of Eucalyptus
trees —secluded gk-ns, gnarled oaks, i
beds of iridescent flowers blossoming j

| violently while icy blizzards snarl a
thousand miles away—all this, the
campus, and beauty.
"But now for the descent into the
Maelstrom. Look at the inhabitants
| of this Utopian world. The co-eds —my
Gawd —the co-eds. A woman's place
is in the home. If she won't stay there,
she should at least be an ornament,
j And if she fails in that, she becomes
; a nuisance. Crows are considered a
nuisance, and the California co-eds re
! semble nothing more than a flock of
| old crows. Even the morbid hypo
i chondriacs of the Middle Ages did not
dream of such a collection of witches,
I hags, and cronies as clutter our halls
lof higher learning. The aggregation
of stray alligators here puts the Bronx
; zoo to shame. Never before has there
I been assembled such an array of
j human ash cans.
"Obviously, then, the statement
that 'only through contact with the
I beautiful do we ourselves become
transcendental and beautiful' must be
consigned to the swill pail.
"There is only one lone, shining
| sunbeam in this limbo of discouraging
facts. There is a beautiful crop of
laundresses in West Oakland now.
Through contact with soiled clothes
and dirty socks have they become
more transcendental and beautiful."
Sonds rather harsh compared to the
Stanford critic's remarks, doesn't it?
Particularly when one remembers
that the Stanford debater simply
said, " —beauty and brains do not
mix." He drew no conclusions from
j this philosophical observation.
