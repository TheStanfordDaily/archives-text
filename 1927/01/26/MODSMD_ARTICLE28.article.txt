# CABBAGES and THINGS

### Frank Mittauer 
An anti-evolution bill has been in-1
traduced in the California Legislature. !
This should call for a wise crack, but
some things are too pathetic to laff at.!

There ts a lor of room for the im-'
i
provement of poetry. Browning's "Last
Duchess" in particular could be much
improved in the following manner, j
The lilting melody would make it suit
able for a popular song or something
and so improve the popularity of mur
der as a winter pastime .... The
poet's crude inspiration runs thus:
"That's my last duchess painted on
the wall
Looking as if she were alive. I call
That piece a wonder now, fra Ran
dolph's hands
Worked busily a day and there she
stands.
Obviously this is easily remembered
for vocal expression classes. But now
listen to the transformation:
That there is my last duchess what is
painted on the wall;
You'll notice that she looks like she
was stuffed, by gosh I call
That piece of art a wonder now, Fra
Pandifoli's mits
Worked busily about a coupla weeks
and there she sits.
Anybody that wants to finish the
job of translating the rest of the
poem is welcome to it, but Cabbages
wants credit for the idea.

A large amount of opportunity for a
classical education is being wasted by
not keeping track of the radiator em
blems on the new gasoline chariots.
It all started when an enterprising
manufacturer put wings on the radi
ator cap of his crates. The wings
were supposed to represent a Viking's
cap or better, helmet, but it was com
monly believed that they were (a)
ears, or (b) something else.
Not daunted by this, other makes
put on emblems, including Ra, the
Egyptian god of whom nobody ever
heard before except in cross-word
puzzles, etc. This proves that 1927
will be a good business year, if people
will take a chance like that.
