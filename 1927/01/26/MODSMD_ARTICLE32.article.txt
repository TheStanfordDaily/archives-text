# DEFINITE SCHEDULE FOR TRACK MEETS STILL BEING DRAWN
## Conflicting Dates Present Difficulties in Making Arrangements 
### 
Track season will open officially on
February 19 when the Interclass Meet
will be run off. The Irish Marathon
comes next on February 26, while the
Big Meet with California on April 16
is the only other meet that has been
definitely arranged for as yet.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia. the Olympic Club, the Holly
wood Athletic Club, and the Los An
geles Athletic Club track squads will
all be met during the course of the
season, although no dates have been
set definitely.
Efforts are being made to arrange
for a meet in Southern California dur
ing spring vacation.
It has been necessary to change
some dates that had already been
chosen, due to various difficulties that
have arisen. The Olympic Club wants
to meet Stanford March 19, the Holly
wood Athletic Club prefers an April
or May date, which they will be un
able to get.
The U.S.C. meet has been tenta
tively set for April 2, and arrange
ments made so far call for its being
held at Stanford. This date is the
first Saturday of spring quarter.
The Little Big Meet was originally
scheduled for April 23, but California
has notified Stanford authorities that
that date comes too close to finals.
California has no Saturdays open dur
ing the track season, and has sug
gested that the meet be held Friday,
April S. This proposition is now under
consideration.
