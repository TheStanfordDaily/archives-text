# FIFTY THOUSAND EARN COLLEGE EXPENSES, SURVEY DATA SHOWS
## 
### 
Fifty thousand students are working
to pay all or part of their expenses in
twenty-four state universities and col
leges in the United States, a recent
survey of the Monitor Bureau shows.
The report further indicated that fif
teen thousand of these are entirely
self-supporting.
In addition to this number there is
a very large number attending private
and denominational schools who are
working their way through, so that
the number of partially self-supporting
students is raised to approximately
one hundred thousand.
Twenty-three out of the twenty-four
colleges reported that the students
working their way are generally the
most prominent in campus activities
and are highest in scholastic standing
as well.
