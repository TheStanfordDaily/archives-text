# FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR ANNUAL NOVICE BOXING UNDER WAY
## Maloney, Circle "S" Men Make Last Arrangements For Tournament 
### 
Coach Harry W. Maloney and the
Circle "S" Society, which is sponsor
ing the affair, are making last-minute
preparations for the Annual Winter
Novice Boxing Tournament, which is
scheduled for Tuesday afternoon at
4:30 o'clock in Encina Gym.
With the deadline for signing up
for the fray set at tomorrow noon, and
the announcement that the weights
will be checked in before the first
elimination preliminaries at 4 o'clock
tomorrow, aspirants are winding up
their practice today for the three two
minute rounds in which they are to
engage.
The elimination battles will be
finished on Friday, and on Tuesday
the semi-finals and the finals will be
staged for the conclusion of the tour
nament.
In the lightweight, welterweight, and
middleweight divisions it is expected
that the hardest battles will be found,
since there is more competition for
each battler to overcome, and con
trarily, in the bantamweight, feather
weight, and heavyweight, with few or
none signed up, action will be rela
tively lacking. Coach Maloney asks
that more men qualified for these last
three classes sign up.
Maloney also announces that a four
pound leeway from strict weights will
be accepted, but that pairings will be
made as to like poundage.
All registered students are eligible
to compete except anyone who has won
a medal at Stanford in a University
championship or novice tournament.
