# SPANISH CLUB HEARS ADDRESS BY COESTER
## 
### 
Professor Alfred Coester of the
Romanic Languages Department was
the speaker at last night's meeting of
the Spanish Club, his subject being:
"The Buenos Aires and Return via
Spain and Portugal."
He described Buenos Aires as re
sembling New York inasmuch as it
is a great cosmopolitan city with
thriving business activities, but its
life is typically European. All work
stops at noon for a rest period of two
hours, then continues until seven, the
regular dinner hour being at nine.
University courses begin at five and
last until ten.
Speaking of Argentine, Coester
quoted one prominent man as saying,
"What the Argentines cannot under
stand is how the people of the United
States can hold such high social ideals
and perform so many noble philan
thropical acts, and yet have a govern
ment so immoral in international af
fairs."
