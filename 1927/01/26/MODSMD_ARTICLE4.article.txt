# SISTERS SING FOLK TUNES, PERFORM DUTCH DANCES
## 
### 
Folk songs from eleven countries
and a group of native Dutch dances
figured on the program given by the
Arntzenius sisters, Constance and
Pennine, last night in the Little Thea
tre. Accompanying themselves on the
guitar and mandolin, they sang in
Dutch, French, Italian, Scotch, Flem
ish, Austrian, German, Russian, Mexi
can, Spanish, and Norwegian.
The sisters were dressed in typical
Dutch costume, Constance as a man
in blue jacket and trousers, red shirt,
and sailor's cap, and Peronne as the
wife in flowered, tight-fitting cap, red
kerchief and underskirt, and embroi
dered navy-blue apron. Both wore
wooden shoes and wrist watches.
Constance Arntzenius gave the Eng
lish translation of each song; one Rus
sian number she translated by the

; I words, "The man says 'How can I
; | marry you? Your father is a dangerous
i ! man,' and the girl says 'Don't worry,'
my father's in a saloon'." The entire
[ I
j content of a Mexican song was, "I'm
' | going back to my sweetheart." All
> I the numbers were sung in harmony
i | well adapted to that type of music;
■ pronunciation of the many different
■ tongues was well-handled; and the
whole program was given in ail en
[ tirelv informal and humorous mood.
. 1 The singers were assisted by two
, ! Dutch friends in presenting their pro
! gram of dances. The numbers included
a dance from the Zuyder Zee, three
■; short dances about a drunkard, a cob
: j bier, and a girl called Henrika, and
J a dance to a song heard in an old
Dutch inn. This last was done in stock
! ing feet because the intricate steps
can not be managed in wooden shoes.
