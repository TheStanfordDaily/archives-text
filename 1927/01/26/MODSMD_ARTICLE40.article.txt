# JUNK, FINERY TO LOST AND FOUND DEPARTMENT ROUGHS BEST PATRONS IN SEARCH FOR HATS HOW ABOUT IT, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR GOLD KEY?
## 
### 
Ranging from safety razor blades to
"Phi Bete" keys, the large and varied
collection of junk and otherwise,
which is disclosed by the open drawers
of the Lost and Found department,
bears witness to the fact that absent
minded professors are not the only
ones whose possessions inexplicably
go astray.
"The roughs are my best patrons,"
says Mrs. G. B. Smith, who presides
over this port of lost ships. After
every show or concert, there is a
great influx of headgear of various
sorts, and the next day I am besieged
by men on their way to the city in
desperate search for lost hats. The
roughs aren't used to wearing hats
and they have an awful time remem
bering them.
Girls Are Careful
"Most of the girls aren't as careless
as the men," Mrs. Smith explained,
"but there are a few of them who
seem to lose everything they put
their hands on. Some of them visit me
as often as once a week looking for
something they have forgotten."
Rush seasons at the Lost and Found
office come at the beginning and end
of the quarter. As finals approach,
many inquiries come in as to the
whereabouts of lost notebooks, con
scientious students whose folders are
suspected of containing invaluable
"dope" on the coming ordeals being
the principle victims of such losses.
Hang on to Notes
"Hold on to your notes at the end
of the quarter," is Mrs. Smith's ad
vice, although she does not attribute
the disappearance of valuable notes to
downright dishonesty as much as to
some students' strained efforts to be
smart.
"My experience with Stanford men
j and women has led me to believe that
J very few of them are dishonest," de
j dared Mrs. Smith. "Of all the occa
| sions on which I have sold University
| publications on the "help yourself"
I plan, only once or twice have I found
j incorrect change at the end of the
day."
Fountain pens are the things that
are being lost this season, judging
from the large number found among
the department's hterogenous collec
tion. Long, black, skinny ones, short,
fat, red ones, and countless others oi
a nondescript character —all are found
in profusion. Jewelry, particularly
rings and phis, are the next most
popular things to lose.
Lost Your Key?
Practically every type of pin from
the mighty Phi Beta Kappa key tc
lowly high school class emblems are
well represented. Shoe brickies, brace

lets, beads, and compacts are also in
evidence.
The Lost and Found department
works on the "finders keepers" policy,
all unclaimed articles being returned
to the people who have turned them
in. After a certain length of time, if
no claimant can be found, valuable
articles are sold and the proceeds
donated to the Stanford Convalescent
Home. Eighteen dollars came from
this source last year.
The office notifies the owner of any
article turned in, provided that it
bears any identification marks. It ac
cepts no rewards for this service but
asks the students to co-operate by
turning in things that they find.

every show or concert, there is a
great influx of headgear of various
sorts, and the next day I am besieged
by men on their way to the city in
desperate search for lost hats. The
roughs aren't used to wearing hats
and they have an awful time remem
bering them.
Girls Are Careful
"Most of the girls aren't as careless
as the men," Mrs. Smith explained,
"but there are a few of them who
seem to lose everything they put
their hands on. Some of them visit me
as often as once a week looking for
something they have forgotten."
Rush seasons at the Lost and Found
office come at the beginning and end
of the quarter. As finals approach,
many inquiries come in as to the
whereabouts of lost notebooks, con
scientious students whose folders are
suspected of containing invaluable
"dope" on the coming ordeals being
the principle victims of such losses.
Hang on to Notes
"Hold on to your notes at the end
of the quarter," is Mrs. Smith's ad
vice, although she does not attribute
the disappearance of valuable notes to
downright dishonesty as much as to
some students' strained efforts to be
smart.
"My experience with Stanford men
j and women has led me to believe that
J very few of them are dishonest," de
j dared Mrs. Smith. "Of all the occa
| sions on which I have sold University
| publications on the "help yourself"
I plan, only once or twice have I found
j incorrect change at the end of the
day."
Fountain pens are the things that
are being lost this season, judging
from the large number found among
the department's hterogenous collec
tion. Long, black, skinny ones, short,
fat, red ones, and countless others oi
a nondescript character —all are found
in profusion. Jewelry, particularly
rings and phis, are the next most
popular things to lose.
Lost Your Key?
Practically every type of pin from
the mighty Phi Beta Kappa key tc
lowly high school class emblems are
well represented. Shoe brickies, brace

lets, beads, and compacts are also in
evidence.
The Lost and Found department
works on the "finders keepers" policy,
all unclaimed articles being returned
to the people who have turned them
in. After a certain length of time, if
no claimant can be found, valuable
articles are sold and the proceeds
donated to the Stanford Convalescent
Home. Eighteen dollars came from
this source last year.
The office notifies the owner of any
article turned in, provided that it
bears any identification marks. It ac
cepts no rewards for this service but
asks the students to co-operate by
turning in things that they find.
Ranging from safety razor blades to
"Phi Bete" keys, the large and varied
collection of junk and otherwise,
which is disclosed by the open drawers
of the Lost and Found department,
bears witness to the fact that absent
minded professors are not the only
ones whose possessions inexplicably
go astray.
"The roughs are my best patrons,"
says Mrs. G. B. Smith, who presides
over this port of lost ships. After
every show or concert, there is a
great influx of headgear of various
sorts, and the next day I am besieged
