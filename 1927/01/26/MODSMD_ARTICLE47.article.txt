# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Fore! Score! Golf and Football!
They mix like Tilden and Tennis,
which is plenty well enough. Many
a gridiron star goes from Punts to
Putts and becomes as famous on the
links as he was in the line or in the
backfield of some big college team.
.Eddie Driggs, of Princeton, is one of
these; so is "Snake" Ames, of the
same school; and "Brink" Thorne
and "Shep" Homans, of Yale; to men
tion only a few who have graduated
from the rough game to the game
that is played, too often, in the rough.
It isn't often, however, that an ath
lete combines football and golf during
his college career, and stars at both
sports. You've heard of Fred Lam
precht, of Tulane, intercollegiate golf
champion in 1925 and 1926? Fred was
one of the stars of the undefeated
"Green Wave" of 1925, and helped
defeat Northwestern, the team that
beat Michigan in the mud; and helped
tie Missouri, the team that beat Neb
raska. Lamprecht exhibited as much
"drive" on the gridiron as he did on
the links, and starred both as an end
and as a full-back.
Emerson Carey, twenty-year-old Kan
sas youth, is not content with being
the leader of Cornell's 1926 football
team. Like his coach, "Gloomy Gil"
Dobie, he is a disciple of the Scotch
pastime, and last year won the West
ern junior golf championship. On the

football field, Carey stars at guard,
and is a fine place-kicker as well.
Fielding H. Yost says, in his "My
Thirty Years in Football," that it
takes more science to make a good
punt than a good putt. Many football
coaches have tried both sports, and I
doubt if all agree with Mr. Yost.
Among the other coaches who suc
cessfully mix golf and football are the
aforementioned Gil Dobie, Alonzo
Stagg, "Pop" Warner, Tad Jones (who
has made a hole-in-one). Chick Mee
han, Pete Reynolds, and "Gloomy Gus"
Henderson. Walter Camp and Percy
Haughton were both excellent golfers
also.

Fore! Score! Golf and Football!
They mix like Tilden and Tennis,
which is plenty well enough. Many
a gridiron star goes from Punts to
Putts and becomes as famous on the
links as he was in the line or in the
backfield of some big college team.
.Eddie Driggs, of Princeton, is one of
these; so is "Snake" Ames, of the
same school; and "Brink" Thorne
and "Shep" Homans, of Yale; to men
tion only a few who have graduated
from the rough game to the game
that is played, too often, in the rough.
It isn't often, however, that an ath
lete combines football and golf during
his college career, and stars at both
sports. You've heard of Fred Lam
precht, of Tulane, intercollegiate golf
champion in 1925 and 1926? Fred was
one of the stars of the undefeated
"Green Wave" of 1925, and helped
defeat Northwestern, the team that
beat Michigan in the mud; and helped
tie Missouri, the team that beat Neb
raska. Lamprecht exhibited as much
"drive" on the gridiron as he did on
the links, and starred both as an end
and as a full-back.
Emerson Carey, twenty-year-old Kan
sas youth, is not content with being
the leader of Cornell's 1926 football
team. Like his coach, "Gloomy Gil"
Dobie, he is a disciple of the Scotch
pastime, and last year won the West
ern junior golf championship. On the

football field, Carey stars at guard,
and is a fine place-kicker as well.
Fielding H. Yost says, in his "My
Thirty Years in Football," that it
takes more science to make a good
punt than a good putt. Many football
coaches have tried both sports, and I
doubt if all agree with Mr. Yost.
Among the other coaches who suc
cessfully mix golf and football are the
aforementioned Gil Dobie, Alonzo
Stagg, "Pop" Warner, Tad Jones (who
has made a hole-in-one). Chick Mee
han, Pete Reynolds, and "Gloomy Gus"
Henderson. Walter Camp and Percy
Haughton were both excellent golfers
also.
