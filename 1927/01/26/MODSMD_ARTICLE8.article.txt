# FIRST USE OF VOTING MACHINES IN CAMPUS ELECTIONS APPROVED
## Ex Committee Gives Assent To Importation of Innovation 
### 
Approval fo the plan suggested by
George Ellsworth, Chairman of the
Election Board, to import voting ma
chines for the mid-year election on
February S was given by the Execu
tive Committee at its meeting last
night.
The editorial control of the summer
Daily was also turned over to the Divi
sion of Journalism for the coming
summer quarter on the same terms as
those on which it'was run by that de
partment last year.
The proposed change of the date of
the Junior Opera from May 6 to May 7
and the substitution of the Junior
Prom on May 6 was delayed until the
Dramatic Council could be consulted
on the matter.
No definite attitude was expressed
by the Executive Committee' on the
proposed plan for the reorganisation
of campus publications, and any action
on the matter was deferred until the
Student Manager should present a
definite plan for their consideration.
Ellsworth announced that the Regis
trar of Voters in San Francisco had
offered to freight down three voting
machines to the campus for the Feb
ruary election free of charge, and also
supply men to run them. This, it is
stated, is done purely from an educa
tional standpoint so the younger gen
eration will be prepared to properly
handle the machines when they come
to vote after graduation. If it is de
cided that the machines will not take
care of the voters, Ellsworth will sup
plement the machines with printed
ballots.
