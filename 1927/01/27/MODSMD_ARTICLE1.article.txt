# CONSTITUTION PROPOSES CUT IN COMMITTEES
## Creation of Debate Council Incorporated in Revision SEPARATE CHARTERS Question of Dispensing with Social Service Group Under Advisement 
### 
Elimination of all committees pro
vided for in the constitution except
the Dramatic Council, Social Service
Committee, Rally Committee, and the
creation of a Debate Council to take
the place of the present Debate Com
mittee was accomplished last night by
the Constitution Committee in its
work of tentatively revising the con
stitution.
The question of dispensing with the
Social Service Committee was taken
under advisement umil a consultation
could be had with the faculty mem
bers.
Provisions were also made for in
cluding the yell leader and his two
assistants in the section concerning
officers, and providing for a special
election in case the incumbent should j
be disqualified for any reason.
Failure of many of the committees
provided for to fulfill their functions
was responsible for the action taken,
declares Robert Littler. The Bonfire
Committee, Convalescent Home Com
mittee, Senior Flower Committee,
Senior Control Committee, and En
dowment Committee came in this
category. The Election Board and
Quad Board were provided for in
other articles.
Under the revised section, which
is now segregated into three distinct
articles, the Dramatic Council, Debate
Council, and Rally Committee will
each have a separate charter and by
laws, separate from the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution, which must first be approved
by the Executive Committee.
Control of the finances of the Dra
matic Council will be vested in the
Student Manager. All expenses shall
be authorized by the Dramatic Man
ager under the supervision of the
Student Manager.
The Debate Manager is subject to
the policies laid down by the Debate
Council and in all financial matters is
subject to the control of the Student
Manager. The article on the Rally
Committee will contain practically the
same provisions as those suggested
for the section concerning the Debate
Council.
These changes were deemed advis
able, in the opinion of the Constitu
tion Committee, in order to eliminate
from the instrument a mass of detail
and leave only the fundamental struc
ture, thus creating a stable set of
rules which will not be subject to re
vision for years to come.
