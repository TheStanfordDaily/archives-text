# Bellows Retains First Place In Free Throw Tilt
## 
### 
George K. Bellows is holding on to
! first place in the annual free throw
I contest with a record of 16 good
j throws out of a possible 20. Up to
late yesterday afternoon, Fred Bowers
and Richard Crowson had been tied
for first with 15 successful shots. Bel-
I lows took his trial, making a bad start
,by missing the first two. The next
! three were good, but the following
i two were missed. With thirteen shots
left, he dropped in every one of them.
Three men made fourteen, eight
sank thirteen, and twelve each made
twelve shots. In the records of the
j 133 men that have tried their skill, the
j average is 8.51 perfect throws. The
results go everywhere between 2 and
It).
Sixteen is the best mark made for
the last two years and, unless beaten
today, will stand as a new record. The
last opportunity for trials to be taken
will be from 1 to 4 o'clock this after
noon. In case of a tie, the toss-off will
probably be made between the halves
of a regular varsity game.
