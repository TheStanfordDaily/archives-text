# GALILEO HIGH BEATS FRESHMAN QUINTET IN HARD-FOUGHT GAME
## Greater Height of Opponents Handicaps 1927 Men; Tight Defense 
### 
Handicapped by the superior height
of their opponents the freshman bas
ketball squad lost a fighting game last
night to the best team they have faced
so far this season, the Galileo High
School quintet, by the score of 23-18.
This makes the fifteenth straight
game that the lanky San Francisco
boys, last year's Bay City champions,
have won this season. Two of their
outfit, Lewis and Tampocke, each
stand six feet and four inches in their
stocking feet and the other three
players had the advantage in height
over all of Coach Hunt's men.
Yearlings Fight Hard
The yearlings fought and played
basketball during the entire forty min
utes and if they had been able to
count the six shots they had for fouls
on the Galileo men, the score might
have read in their favor. It cannot be
denied that the freshmen who made
more tries for goals than their op
ponents, had the will of the gods
against them as frequently the ball
would balance on the edge of the
hoop and then drop outside to the
advantage of the San Francisco team.
In the first quarter the Stanford
babes were decidedly afraid of the
giants from the North and would not
take long shots, which was the only
way they could come near the basket
on account of the tallness of the vic
tors. Garibotto was sent in for Stew
art at forward with the instructions
to do some long-range shooting and
quick following up of the ball. The
score at the end of the half was 11 to
4 in favor of the Galileoans.
Simkins Stars
In the opening period of the second
half, the babes got under way and
raised their quota to 12 points and
held the Galileo team to two baskets.
It was at this point that Simkins, year
ling guard, showed himself to be the
most dependable man to work the ball
down the floor and get through the
tight defense of the Galileo squad.
Smith was sent in to take Simkins'
place and the latter was moved up to
forward in Stewart's position.
The Cardinal centers had an "off"
night as Bush could not hang oii to
the ball and Rothert was slow on the
jump.
Captiyn Harry Berg played a ver
sitile game. In addition to making
twelve points for the freshmen, which
i made him high-point man. he shared
1 honors with Hale of Galileo of being
I the outstanding man on the floor. Hale
! had a dead eye for the basket and
: made his fchots from a long distance
I from the cage as the fast rushes of
! Thompson, Cardinal guard, were too
! much for the Galileo players to get
| position near the basket.
