ball play yesterday evening when they
defeated the Delta Tau Delta quintet
by a score of 18 to 5. Other winners
j were Encina 5, Beta Theta Pi, El
j Campo, Chinese Club, and Alpha Tau
Omega. Most of the games were poorly
played, the Breakers greatly outclass
i ing the other teams.
Extra Period Used
j The biggest walkaway o? the after
j noon was between Encina 5 and En-
I cina IW, the former completely out
i playing their opponents. Although the
' El Campo-Branner If game required an
I extra period to decide the outcome,
i the play was slow and uninteresting.
I The Chinese Club pulled the biggest
! surprise, downing Encina IE by one
! point .
The first game played yesterday re
! suited in a decisive trouncing for En
! cina 1W at the hands of Encina 5 with
j a score of 22 to 1. Wright made the
| only tally for the losers with a foul
i throw in the second half. The ground
j floor team started out with a ven
j geance, running circles around their
I opponents.
Skelton played an excellent type of
basketball for the victors, following
the ball at all times and smashing up
every kind of offense. The high-point
man for the game was Robinson, who
accounted for thirteen points.
Los Arcos Leads at Half
Ending the first half with a 10 to 6
score. Los Arcos looked as though
they were going to give the Betas a
close run for the game. In the last
period, however, the clubmen were
| held to one field goal, while the win-
I ners were piling up one sucecssful
I shot after another. Gomer Thomas
| bewildered Los Arcos with his fast
; court tactics. He made most of the
points for the Betas, totaling three
field goals and a free throw.
Kissinger and Williams also did
some nice playing for the fraternity
team, showing up well in both de
fense and offense. The Los Arcos
team presented a strong offense, but
was unable to follow up its shots.
Beardsley was high scorer for the
losers, with two field goals. Criley,
| Shannon, and Jensen stood out among
| the basket guards.
D. U.'s Default
In the third game of the afternoon,
Delta Upsilon defaulted to Alpha Tau
Omega.
Starting the evening's play. El
Campo nosed out Branner II in an
| extra-period game by a score of 12 to
> 10. Neither team seemed to be able
! to pass effectively during the entire
tussle, and at the end of the first half
El Campo was leading 4 to 3. In the
second half Branner apparently got
under way and forged into the lead.
However, the spurt died down, and
when Britton sank his lone tally of
the game with about a minute to play,
the score was tied at 8 to 8.
Holmes again put El Campo in the
lead in the early piart of the extra
five minutes with a long shot from the
side of the floor. The lead was short
lived. however, for Rude tallied a field
goal for Branner. Then, with five sec
onds to go, Beardsley shot the winning
goal with a pretty toss from the center
of the court.
The Chinese Club players fought
like demons to take their first intra
mural contest, a foul shot by Pan de
ciding the contest against Encina lE.
While the Encina team showed lack
of practice, the Chinese boys were
much smaller than their opponents,

I and it was teamwork and a scrapping
i spirit that finally won out. The Chi
j nese squad had a slight edge in the
first half which ended with a score
j of 5 to 4.
Pan and Lee increased the students'
I lead in the early part of the last half,
| but Dahl and Marx of the freshman
I five rallied and put their team back
I in the running with three nice field
' goals. With a minute and a half left
1 to play, Hammon fouled Pan. and the
I Chinese forward made good his try
! for goal.
i
Teamwork scored another victory in
i the final game, when the Breakers
defeated the Delta Tau Delta quintet
by an 18 to 5 score. Neither team had
i been defeated before, and at first the
game promised to be a real battle. The
! Breakers soon got under way, how
ever, and at half time had white
washed the Delts 9 to 0. George and
j Cook divided honors in this half, both
| accounting for four points.
At the start of the second half the
I
Row men attempted a comeback, but
{ were stopped by the effective guard
ing of Harris and McDonald. The
! Breakers continued their fast play,
| and ran up nine more points before
the game was completed, while their
; strong defensive formation held the
i Delts to two field goals and one foul
tally.
