# SPENCER, COE TAKE FIRSTS IN PRACTICE HELD ON WET TRACK
## 
### 
In spite of the handicap imposed by j
ia muddy track, Coach "Dink" Temple-]
ton sent his quarter-milers, half- !
milers, and two-niilers through their!
paces yesterday afternoon. The men l
i in each event ran slightly shorter dis-!
tances than those called for by their
regular races.
Only men out for events above the
quarter-mile worked under timers.
The sprinters, vaQlters, hurdlers, and
jumpers ran several two-twenties,
merely striding through the furlong
for pacing and timing. Weight-heavers
and javelin-throwers practiced their
own events.
Spencer Wins
Emerson Spencer made a strong
finish in the 362-yard dash to win from
j Kingsbury, Morrison, and Captain Bab
cock, who finished in the order named.
; Kingsbury took an early lead, but
i Spencer came up fast after rounding
the turn.
Coe ran six laps in 7:38, beating
Crlley and Aiken, second and third.
Coe is ineligible for competition tlv/}
year, as he is a transfer. He ran a
strong last lap, and can probably go
the full two miles under ten minutes.
Aiken ran on the Class of 1927 track
team, but has been out of school since
that time.
Criley Developing
Criley is running nicely this season,
developing a stride and pace that
should place him well to the front of
j many races this year.
The milers ran three laps; the half*
j milers 060 yards. Coach Templeton
plans to hold a track meet tomorrow
! afternoon, in which, weather permit
j ting, each event will go the full dis
tance.
