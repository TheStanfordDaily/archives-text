# AIRPLANE'S PETROL REPLENISHED WHILE PASSENGERS LUNCH
## 
### 
Tlie "Alexander Eusleliow,"
giant plane headed for San Fran
cisco from the Kern County Air
port In Bakersfleld, ran out of
gas yesterday morning just in
time to let its passengers, two
men and a woman, have lunch at
Stanford.
The plane had previously gone
dry near Mountain View. Some
gas was put in, but it was only
enough to allow the plane to
reach the Polo Field. The super
intendent, who was guiding the
plane, discovered the lack of
gasoline in time to make a sensa
tional landing.
During the lunch hour a gas
truck was sent out to enable the
plane to continue its trip.
