# CARD FORWARD PROBLEM NOW SEEMS SOLVED
## Shifting Varsity Lineup Is Rendered Unnecessary By Week's Showing DAVID, BRYANT DO WELL Stanford Squad Possesses Two Players for Each Position on Team 
### Fred Speers 
Coach Husky Hunt's plan of shaking
up the varsity lineup in preparation
for the Nevada two-game series this
week-end fell through last night when
the Cardinal mentor indicated that he
will use his regular set of forwards
against the invading Wolfpack. Play
ing in scrimmage practice against the
Phi Gamma Delta intramural squad,
the varsity coach used Captain David
and Bryant at forward.
Up to last night the Fiji squad had
been undefeated but it was a different
tale when one short shot after another
scored for the varsity while Fiji
guards were powerless to check Bry
ant, Jayred, and David.
Chalk talks and scrimmage practice
has been the regular menu for the
varsity for the past several days.
David Improves
Now as to the Cardinal mentor's
plan to shift Vincenti to a forward
berth play opposite Bryant: the
shift will not, to all indications, be
made because the late return for prac
tice of Lewis, who was scheduled to
take Vincenti's berth at running guard,
and because of the fact that Captain
Nelson David has improved so much
during the past week that he is prac
tically assured of starting against
Nevada.
In other words, the forward problem
presented by the slump evidenced in
the Southern Branch game last Satur
day has been solved without carrying
out the contemplated change in lineup.
Whether that change may later be
come necessary is a question which
will be answered by the showing of
Husky Hunt's forwards against Ne
vada.
Squad Two Deep
The Cardinal squad now remains
two deep in every position, with the
possible exception of standing guard.
Anderson, who has started almost
every game at this berth, has behind
him Biaggini, who has the difficult
task of being ready for either standing
or running guard utility.
