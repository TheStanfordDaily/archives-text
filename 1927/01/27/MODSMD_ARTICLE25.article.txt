# Collective Bargaining
## 
### 
Fraternity houses 011 the Stanford campus have at last awakened to
the possibility of organizing an association of house managers to deal
jointly in their purchasing of supplies. Last night a constitution of the
Co-operative Managers' Association was presented to a gathering of house
treasurers, and the plan as outlined in the constitution was received with
favor by the students present at the meeting.
The bargaining power of a single house is very small, and the result
is that the fraternities are now paying exorbitant prices for the essentials.
Palo Alto merchants make but small reductions to the campus groups.
In a university we learn 011 all sides the advantages to be obtained from
collective bargaining, and this suggested scheme may put into practice
that which all economics and social science students learn in theory.
The plan as discussed last night did not call for any radical steps
such as would necessitate large expenditures of money. It was merely a
scheme to organize house managers into an association, which should have
its advantages in a small way at first, and could gradually expand if the
plan is found to be a success. The houses would not be stepping over their
heads, but would be feeling their way carefully along a well-defined path
to the future.
1 o cite the results of a similar plan at another university is, only in
a small way, an indication of what might happen at Stanford, but in
glancing over the workings of an organization of house managers at the
1 nivers?tv of Oregon, we find that complete success has been obtained
in all of their various activities. The Oregon plan started in a small way,
and in five years has developed into a monstrous money-saving device,
with the houses and clubs, and ultimately the students, reaping the harvest.
