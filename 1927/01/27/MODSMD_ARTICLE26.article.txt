# Growing Up

College men are better gentlemen today than even those of two short
years ago, according to "Toppy," janitor of Toyon and Branner. At least,
he says that many of the "collegiate" tricks and knavery of other days
have passed into the limbo.
That fact in itself might be caused by any one of several things.
However, we prefer to agree with "Toppy" that college students are
outgrowing year by year the juvenile stunts common to high school days.
It is not that the University is a place solely for serious and rather long
faced individuals, but rather that high school days are over.
The time is long past when barns painted with red numerals provided
the sensation of the quarter, when countless other such escapades kept the
campus on its toes. Through succeeding college generations the more
raucous phases have died. It would seem that our own time is seeing the
passing of even more.
Perhaps the trend of the age is toward a more gentlemanly outlook
on the part of the student, and toward the assumption of a more sophisti
cated and blase pose. The freshmen, too, are not wholly exempt, for this
is the day of early disillusionment.
In all probability this trend is toward the good, and at the very least
should give the casual visitor a better impression of university life. But
at the same time there are many of us to benloan the lack of tangible
evidence of youthful vitality, and to be sorry that it has fallen into
the discard.
