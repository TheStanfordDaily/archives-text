# The 						Crossing Menace
## 
### 
Another black mark has been chalked up to the credit of dangerous
railroad crossings, Just yesterday a Stanford student was the victim of
an unprotected street car crossing on Lastien near the bookstore. Wit
nesses maintain that the street car failed to come to a halt before
attempting to cross the intersection,
But this failure of the street Car io slop is not ail uncommon occur
rence. Repeatedly the Fettinsuiar Railway Company's street cars have
crossed Lasuen on the trip to Palo Alto without making 'a halt before
entering the intersection.
For some time this practice has luckily gone on without serious results.
Students have talked about the matter, and the Daily has suggested an
enforced stop for both sides of the street. But to no avail.
The campus traffic situation is constantly becoming more serious.
Year after year the number of campus-owned automobiles increases, and
with this increase the menace becomes more active. Practically every
car on the campus crosses these tracks at least once a day because of the
crossing's centralized location. It takes such an accident to make people
realize the danger.
l'cfore the situation becomcs worse it seems advisable that the Uni
versity authorities take action on the matter. Undoubtedly orders to stop
street cars before crossing the intersection have not been issued merely
through some oversight.
