Mrs. Chaplin's unexpurgated accusa
tions against Charlie are on sale in
Palo Alto.
One of the reasons this recently pub
lished literary work is not acceptable
for the Free Reading Courses is that
it costs two-bits a copy.

Stanford men living in the two new
est halls have improved at least 50
per cent in the last two years, their
janitor compliments.
The trouble is, they think so too.

What's this, another axle grease
joke?

There was one time a fellow named
Paul
Bought a bid for the great co-ed crawl,
He wanted a lassie
Well known to be classy
But his friends said he'd not rate at all.

1 But our hero was never afraid
I That he'd find himself ritzed by the
maid;
So dressed in his best,
He shaved and the rest,
j Then a deep plan he cleverly laid.
M
| Now Paul paid a tough guy from his
class
i To most rudely insult the fair lass;
| Then knocking him down
He lisped with a frown,
' "This cutie you must not harass."
With a sigh she slumped down on his j
shoulder
Where our hero was not loath to hold
her.
When asked in what way
i to repay,
"Only «ive me a date's" what he told
her.
Then he heard the fair damsel to say,
"Why surely, I'd love to. What day?"
With a smile very big
He snapped out, "Co-ed Jig,"
Thus proving there's always a way.
