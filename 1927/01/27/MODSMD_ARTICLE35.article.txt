# STANFORD PROFESSOR SUPERVISES BUILDING EXPERIMENTAL DAM
## 
### 
Construction of a concrete dam in i
order to see how high the wall can be
raised before the pressure of the water
crumbles it is being conducted by the
Engineering Foundation of New York,
of which Charles D. Marx, professor
emeritus of Civil Engineering of Stan-
ford, is chairman of the committee,
making this novel experiment.
The dam is being built in Steven
son Creek canyon, sixty miles from
Fresno, and has attained a height of
sixty feet at the expense of $110,000. j
The work costs $1,000 a foot and Pro
fessor Marx thinks that the dam can
stand another forty feet without dan
ger of giving away. To complete the '
experiment funds are now being
sought to raise the dam until it breaks :
under the pressure of water.
The dam is of the arch type with a
radius of 100 feet and is only two
feet thick where the stress is the
greatest. The strength of the con- i
crete has shown a high degree of uni
formity as the average was slightly
over 2000 pounds per square inch at
twenty-eight days while the strength
computed was ISOO pounds. Tests
have been made with the water at
different levels.
Work on the test project was started
last April and has continued until the
present height has been reached. While
the concrete was being deposited,
hundreds of instruments and metal
reference marks were carefully set in
place to be used in measuring strains,
deflections, and temperatures.
Wooden trestles were erected to af- j
ford easy access by the observers and
electric lights were installed on both
sides of the dam. The last wooden
forms, in which the concrete had been
poured, were removed last June. Ever
since the beginning of the work, the
concrete has been kept wet by small j
streams of water trickling down the
sides of the walls. This was done to
prevent undesirable shrinkage during
the curing of the material.
Professor Marx was quoted as say- j
ing in regard to the usefulness of the
experiment: "If we can correct an
swers to our problems the light re
vealed by the construction of the ex
perimental dam should tend towards
the saving of lives and of millions of j
dollars of property. The cost of dams
for power development will be con
siderably lessened and they will afford
the reclamation of lands which are
now useless. Other factors which the
experiment should shed knowledge on
are the water supplies of cities and
towns and flood prevention."
Other experiments on the dam are |
to be made at an early date. Profes-1
sor Marx stated that three additional J
feet of water were added to the j
Stevenson lake by the recent rains.

The dam is being built in Steven
son Creek canyon, sixty miles from
Fresno, and has attained a height of
sixty feet at the expense of $110,000. j
The work costs $1,000 a foot and Pro
fessor Marx thinks that the dam can
stand another forty feet without dan
ger of giving away. To complete the '
experiment funds are now being
sought to raise the dam until it breaks :
under the pressure of water.
The dam is of the arch type with a
radius of 100 feet and is only two
feet thick where the stress is the
greatest. The strength of the con- i
crete has shown a high degree of uni
formity as the average was slightly
over 2000 pounds per square inch at
twenty-eight days while the strength
computed was ISOO pounds. Tests
have been made with the water at
different levels.
Work on the test project was started
last April and has continued until the
present height has been reached. While
the concrete was being deposited,
hundreds of instruments and metal
reference marks were carefully set in
place to be used in measuring strains,
deflections, and temperatures.
Wooden trestles were erected to af- j
ford easy access by the observers and
electric lights were installed on both
sides of the dam. The last wooden
forms, in which the concrete had been
poured, were removed last June. Ever
since the beginning of the work, the
concrete has been kept wet by small j
streams of water trickling down the
sides of the walls. This was done to
prevent undesirable shrinkage during
the curing of the material.
Professor Marx was quoted as say- j
ing in regard to the usefulness of the
experiment: "If we can correct an
swers to our problems the light re
vealed by the construction of the ex
perimental dam should tend towards
the saving of lives and of millions of j
dollars of property. The cost of dams
for power development will be con
siderably lessened and they will afford
the reclamation of lands which are
now useless. Other factors which the
experiment should shed knowledge on
are the water supplies of cities and
towns and flood prevention."
Other experiments on the dam are |
to be made at an early date. Profes-1
sor Marx stated that three additional J
feet of water were added to the j
Stevenson lake by the recent rains.
