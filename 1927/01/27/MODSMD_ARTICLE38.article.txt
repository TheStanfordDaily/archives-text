# COLLEGE UNION PLAN
## 
### 
Canadian college students may form
a national union, similar to that found
in American universities. Representa
tives of eleven Canadian schools met
recently in Montreal to decide
whether the project was feasible. The
conference considered the scope, finan
ces, and organization needed for such
a union. A tentative constitution was
drawn up, and if ten universities agree
to it a national organization will be
formed.
