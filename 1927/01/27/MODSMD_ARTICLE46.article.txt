Coach Dean B. Cromwell, track coach
at the University of Southern Cali
fornia, is more wreathed in smiles
than ever just now, as he contem
plates his two star sophomore sprint
ers, whom I will call for the time
being, "Exhibit B" and "Exhibit D."
Last summer, Charley Paddock, a
former pupil of Cromwell's at U.S.C.,
pet a new world's record of 9% seconds
for 100 yards, in the Southern Pacific
A.A.U. championships, held in the Los
Angeles Coliseum. The excitement
caused by that race was not the won
derful time made by the "Pasadena
Flyer," but the fact that Paddock
barely won by a scant four inches, due
to his famous flying leap at the finish,
from a U.S.C. freshman named Charles
Borah. In fact, the race was so close
that a great many spectators thought
that the "Fastest Human" had been
beaten.
The East heard of that race, but
scoffed, as was its wont, at "Southern
California timing," and vowed that if
Borah, an unknown, could be so close
to Charley, the new record was evi
dently a mistake. But the East had a
fine opportunity to see and appreciate
young Mr. Borah later, at the National
A.A.U. championships in Philadelphia.
All the star sprinters of the country
were entered there in the IOO'-yard

dash except Paddock, Locke, and Rus
sell. The favorites, Jackson Scholz,
Frank Hussey, Dellart Hubbard, Chet.
Bowman, and Loren Murchison, were
all beaten in 9 4-5 seconds by an un
known sprinter from the Hollywood
Athletic Club â€”and his name was Char
ley Borah!
So much for exhibit "B," who runs
in a style very similar to that of
Jackson Scholz, the Olympic 200-meter
champion. Exhibit "D" is Weldon
Draper, who, before he suffered a
muscle injury in the middle of his
freshman campaign, had beaten his
classmate Borah in several sprint
races.
Draper's running form is very simi
lar to Paddock's, and for the good
reason that Draper has been doing his
best to run like Mr. Paddock since he
was a youth at Central High School
in Fort Worth, Texas. There he got
hold of some pictures of the famous
Charley, together with a story on Pad
dock's peculiar style, and spent many
hours practicing the Coast sprinter's
start, stride, knee action, and flying
; finish. He succeeded so well that sev
| eral times he ran 9 4-5 seconds before
| he graduated from high school. Then
I he bought an old Ford, drove to Los
I Angeles, and entered U.S.C., to be
| trained by Dean Cromwell, the man
who had trained his athletic ideal.
Charley Paddock!
