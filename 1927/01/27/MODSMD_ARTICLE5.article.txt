# HOUSE MANAGERS PLAN TO ORGANIZE COOPERATIVE PURCHASING, ASSOCIATION
## Constitution Calls for Membership of Treasurer, Manager of Each House, Board of Seven Directors 
### 
The constitution of the "Co-operative
Managers' Association" was read at a
meeting of the house managers of
campus fraternities held at the Phi
Gamma Delta house last night. It will
be presented by the house managers
at their fraternity meetings next Mon
day night, and next Wednesday at a
dinner at the Zeta Fsi house it will be
voted upon.
The plan as completed is to start
slowly and not to include too much in
co-operative purchasing at first. IL'
adopted in its present form, it will be
an association of managers, who will
test the gains to be achieved by quan
tity purchasing and group action.
Possibility of the sororities and
other organizations about the campus
joining the association if they so wish
will be considered later.
Seven Directors
The constitution calls for a mem
bership including the treasurer or
manager of each house, officers of the
association to be a president, vice
president, secretary, and treasurer.
Seven directors of the organization
will be chosen, of whom five are to be
students, one a faculty member, and
one an alumnus. Tlie student members
will be elected for one year and the

i faculty and alumni members for terms
of two years.
Nothing definite is provided in the
constitution concerning a manager, ex
' cept that one may be elected by the
i board of directors if they so choose.
The co-operative plan as run at
Oregon is more or less an example at
which the houses here are aiming. The
Northern school organized during the
war to cut down expenses for wood
I by purchasing in carload lots. An as
] sociation grew by slow stages until at
, present it owns a warehouse and sup
| plies everything for the houses, even
1 down to furniture.
Whether the Stanford fraternities
will go as far as Oregon will be de
-1 cided later. For the present they plan
to test themselves through buying on
| a more limited scale, and by bargain
ing with Palo Alto merchants.
| The concensus of opinion among the
house managers is that prospects for
; the success of the plan if adopted are
good, as it has. proven a success in
practically every institution where it
j has been adopted. President Wilbur
! and the Alumni Association expressed
themselves in favor of the system last
year in a meeting of the Alumni Asso
! ciation in San Francisco.
