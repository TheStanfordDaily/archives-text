# Kisses Deadly Say Doctors Make Heart Beat Abnormally Cost Three Minutes of Life
## 
### 
"Every time the 'average* college
youth steps out with his queen he
loses three hours off of his life." This
is the warning given out by erudite
members of the medical profession.
This deduction was made from the
discovery that each time we indulge
in the pleasure of a kiss we put our
selves three minutes nearer to the
grave.
Whenever we kiss, the heart con
sumes just so much reserve energy.
Calculations made by San Francisco
doctors show that the heart beats
1,545,264,000 times during a lifetime.
During the transmission of a kiss the ,
heart leaps from the normal 70 to an ;
abnormal 90. It takes three minutes j
to recover.
Not only kissing, but taking a sud- j
den drop in an aeroplane or making j
a habit of jumping out of balloons will J
produce the same bad effect.
