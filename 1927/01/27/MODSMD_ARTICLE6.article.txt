Rounding out what promises to be a
full and finished program, Coach Harry j
W. Maloney has added to the regular j
bouts of the Annual Winter Novice J
Tournament scheduled for next Tues
day evening at 7:30 o'clock in the has-1
ketball pavilion, several preliminary;
struggles.
Besides exhibition bouts by mem
bers of the varsity squad, Coach Ma-;
loney will pit himself against Carlos ;
Miron, captain of this season's varsity i
squad, the featherweight champion of |
the coast, for two two-minute rounds !
in the preliminary match of the eve- j
ning's entertainment. Although Ma
loney weighs thirty-five pounds more
than Miron, the little South American j
should give him plenty of trouble.
The elimination bouts for those en- j
tered in the Novice Tournament have j
been postponed from this afternoon to
tomorrow at 4 o'clock, which will leave
the semi-finals and finals for Tuesday
evening. The aspirants will engage in
three two-minute round bouts, with
the winner of the final struggle
awarded a medal for victory in his
division. Bouts are being conducted in
seven distinct classes, including the j
bantam, feather, light, welter, middle, ;
light-heavy, and heavy weights. Over ;
forty men are in daily practice for the ;
tournament.
Being particularly anxious to inter
est the women on the campus in colle- j
giate boxiiii;. Coach Maloney makes j
the following comment: "There is no j
better athletic pastime than clean,
wholesome, amateur boxing, when
conducted on a high plane. Boxing
here at Stanford has always main- I
tained a very high standard. Such
being the case, we always feel justified
in extending an invitation to the wo
ment of the campus to be present at
our tournaments."
The proceeds from ihe admission
charged for the tourney will be used
for the medals. Those holding student
body cards will be taxed twenty-five
cents, while the regular price of fifty
cents will admit outsiders.
