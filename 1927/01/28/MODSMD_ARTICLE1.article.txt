# HUNT'S VARSITY FIVE FORTIFIED FOR WOLF PACK
## Work on Basket-Shooting Intended to Prevent Fresh Slump NEW LINEUP IS PLANNED Coach Sends Team Into Game After Week of Intensive Practice 
### Fred Speers 
Following a week of intensive prac
tice on basket-shooting to prevent if
possible the recurrence of a slump
•such as was experienced last week
against the Branch, Coach Husky
Hunt will send his varsity basketball
live against the Nevada quintet tonight
in the pavilion.
As a preliminary the freshman five
meets McClymonds High School. To
morrow Nevada and Stanford clash
again in a return game.
New Lineup Planned
A new starting lineup will be used
by the Cardinal mentor in the initial
clash. Captain Nelson David will start
opposite Bryant. Following are the
announced lineups for tonights game:
Stanford Nevada—
David (C) F Bailey
Bryant F J. Lawler
Jayred C Morrisson
Vincenti G Clover
Anderson G Hainor
The Wolfpack will be minus its cap
tain, due to injuries recently sustained.
Coach Martie of Nevada has a rather
inexperienced squad, boasting of but
three of last year's regulars.
Cards Picked to Win
To all indications, Stanford should
come out victorious in both contests,
at any rate the Cardinals are due by
now for some heavy scoring. Concen
tration on basket-shooting, on better
timing of pass plays, and in general
on efforts to speed up the pace of the
team should result favorably to Coach
Husky Hunt's men.
If Stanford wins tonight by an easy
margin, there may be some experi
menting tomorrow night. McCandless
will in all probability start tomorrow
night and may also be figured to get
into the fray tonight. Biaggini, also
being held in reserve, will probably
start tomorrow night.
Vincenti at Guard
The dropping of the plan to put
Vincenti at a forward berth has re
duced the Cardinal lineup to the same
reading as it was before the team went
south last week-end. Whether Husky
Hunt plans to adopt this plan begin
ning next week depends to a certain
extent on the showing his half-dozen
forwards make against the Wolfpack.
