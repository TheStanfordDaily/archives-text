# IRELAND'S NINE TO FACE CARDS IN FIRST GAME
## Altrock's Rival Has Brought Teams to Campus for Thirty-Four Years BEST LINE-UP TO START Captain Collins, Sobieski to Oppose Independents in Tomorrow's Clash 
### William Stein A . – 
Cliff Ireland, the grand old man of
baseball, and his Independents who
travel along with him getting only
expense money, are slated to open
Stanford's 1927 varsity baseball sea
son here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock in the traditional battle.
Ireland, Nick Altroek's famous rival,
has brought his teams down to Stan
ford for the past thirty-four years
to oppose the Cardinal nines in their
initial attempts of the year on the
diamond. He has come and gone and
has outlasted them all 011 the playing
field. Fifty-eight years old now, he
says that he will come down to play
Stanford nines till he has to run
around second base on crutches.
Keeping up a rapid-fire line of chat
ter throughout the proceedings, and
in the meantime playing a very credit
able game on the keystone sack, Ire
land can easily lay claim to sharing
the throne of wit with Altrock of the
Washington Senators, who certainly
has, by his antics, satisfied the many
cash customers who come for that
reason alone.
And he never springs the same gag
twice. His love for the game, and the
pleasure he derives from it, have in
spired him to heights, and kept him in
the lists when stronger and huskier
men have been forced to drop by the
wayside. He gets at least one hit and
one error every game. The best of
Stanford's hurlers have been unsuc
cessful in breaking his hitting streak.
Tomorrow Wolter is sending his
strongest lineup against Ireland's
