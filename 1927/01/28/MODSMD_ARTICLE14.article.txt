# SCHOOL OF LETTERS AIMS TO LIBERALIZE STUDY IN LANGUAGES
## Five Departments Combined With Albert L. Guerard Made Acting Head 
### 
Liberalization of the curriculum in
English literature and languages is the
stated aim of the School of Letters
organized last quarter. The School em
braces the departments of English,
Classical Literature, Germanic Lan
guages, Romanic Languages, and
Slavic Literature.
Albert L. Guerard, Professor of
General Literature?, is acting chairman
of the Council of the School, in the
absence from the University of Augus
tus T. Murray, Professor of Classical
Literature. The Council includes those
I members of the staff of instruction
;who are also members of the Academic
i Council. Professor Samuel S. Seward,
i Jr., is secretary.
Course Is Broader
"The purpose of the new School,"
j Professor Guerard said yesterday, "is
I to offer a course of study broader than
, can be given in any one department."
The A.B. degree may be majoring
obtained in two ways in the School
of Letters.. The students may elect
30 units in either modern or classical
languages or English and 15 units in
each of the other subjects, studying a
total of 60 units under the regulation
of the departments in which this work
lies. The alternative, suggested by
Professor Frederick Anderson of the
Romanic Languages department, al
lows the student to complete 30 of his
units in the Upper Division in courses
chosen at will. Credit for the remain
ing 60 units will be awarded in ac
cordance with the results of examina
tions taken. The language examination
will be given in a classical or a modern
language. Credit for 24 units will be
1 given for this work.
Examinations Planned
An examination in English litera
ture will cover another 24 units, while
the remaining twelve will be granted
for essays on ancient and modern
authors. No scholarship qualifications,
such as obtain under the Independent
Study Plan, will be required.
