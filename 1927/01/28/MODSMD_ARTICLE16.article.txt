# SIGMA CHIS BEAT CHI PSI CAGE MEN
## Japanese Club Loses Game After Luckless Orgy Of Shooting 
### 
MURAL BASKETBALL RESULTS
Sigma Chi 24, Chi Psi 22
Encina 3E 9, Japanese Club 7
Cardinals 14, Phi Delta Theta 2
Indians 16, Alpha Kappa Lambda 7
Staging one of the fastest, most
spectacular lights of the intramural
basketball season, Sigma Chi tri
umphed over the Chi Psi live 24 to 22
in the second of the afternoon's con
tests. A brilliant rally, in the final
five minutes of play, almost saved the
clay for the defeated quintet, but the
Sigma Chi lead proved to be just a
shade too big for the losers to cope
with.
Show Terrific Battle
Both outfits smashed up and down
the court at a terrific pace, playing
just roughly enough to make things
interesting. There was some good bas
ketball displayed, however. Bowers,
Sigma Chi, was unquestionably the
outstanding star of the melee. He was
responsible for thirteen points. Clyne,
for the losing team, was also plenty
good with nine points to his credit.
Baskets Hoodooed
The baskets at Encina Gym were
hoodooed yesterday. At least that is
what Encina 3E and the Japanese
Club think after the orgy of luckless
shooting they staged in the first of
the afternoon's games. The final tally
was 9 to 7 for the freshmen, but at
half time the Orientals were at the
long end of a 1 to 0 score.
Things speeded up in the second
half and Endo. Jap forward, performed
brilliantly. His dribbling was spectacu
lar. Nye, (or Encina, also played a
good game, but iu spite of their win
the victors were outplayed throughout
most of the tussle.
While both afternoon games in yes
terday's intramural basketball play
were won by a margin of but two
points, the evening contests were
walkaways for the Cardinals and the
Indians. The afternoon's winners were
Sigma Chi and Encina 3E, while the
Japanese Club, Chi Psi, Phi Delta
1 heta, and Alpha Kappa Lambda quin
tets were ou the small end of the
scores. *
In the first evening game the Cardi
nals hopelessly outclassed Phi Delta
Theta, the Row men being unable to
score a single field goal during the
contest. Neither team could shoot with
any degree of accuracy, and the ab
sence of competition made the game
uninteresting. At half time the score
stood 8 to 2, while in the last period
the Cardinals held the Phi Delts score
less while they ran up six more tallies.
In the final game the Indians
scalped Alpha Kappa Lambda 16 to 7.
The first half was easy for the vic
tors, Scliwarz, Telonicher, and Mont
ferino accounting for eight points
while McDougall was sinking a lone
tally for A.K.L. In the last period
Dunfee, who substituted for Cox on
the fraternity team, added three field
goals to his team's total, but as he re
ceived no assistance, the Indians had
no trouble keeping a substantial lead.
