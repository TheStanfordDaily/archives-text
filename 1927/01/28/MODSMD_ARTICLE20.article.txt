# BAN ON WOMEN'S SMOKING IN CAMPUS LIVING GROUPS LIFTED
## Problem Secretly Discussed By Representatives For Some Time PRESIDENT APPROVES Conference Passes New Rule After Taking Vote of Five Hundred 
### 
Smoking by Stanford women is no
longer expressly forbidden, in the set
of regulations approved by Women's
Conference Wednesday night. The
rule regarding smoking by the wo
men, which provides that they shall
not smoke in public places on the cam
pus but permits the living groups to
decide for themselves as to smoking
in Roble Hall and the sororities, was
approved by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur yesterday afternoon.
The question of smoking by the
women on the campus was secretly
discussed by Women's Conference for
some time, and it was decided to take
a vote of all the women on the sug
gested regulation. This vote was taken
Monday evening at the house meetings
of the living groups, and each group
instructed its Conference representa
tives how to vote. At the Conference
meeting they cast their ballots in
favor of the new rule. 18 to 1.
Rule Stated
The rule is worded as follows: "Re
spect for the sentiment of the Uni
versity against women smoking in
public gatherings on the campus, on
the streets of the campus, or in the
vicinity of the University buildings is
upheld by Associated Women Stu
dents. Whether or not women shall
smoke in living groups is left to the
yearly decision of the individual living
groups. It is recommended that women
do not smoke in public places in Palo
Alto or in the vicinity."
The rule that Stanford women shall
not attend off-campus dances given by
and for a living group was changed
to read that they shall not do so
unless the living group concerned has
been granted permission by the ap
propriate dean to hold the dance, and
the list of permissions has been pub
lished in the campus daily newspaper.
Other women's regulations were re
approved as they formerly appeared,
or in slightly modified wording.
A complete list of the women's regu
lations will be found elsewhere on
this page.
