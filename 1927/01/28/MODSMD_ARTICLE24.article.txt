# "Freshman, a Match"

Barring parental objection, the most of the Stanford women may now
lounge within the confines of their sororities and dormitories and puff
away until the last cigarette is gone. Xew packs can be opened, the blue
haze can become thicker, and no one will utter a single word of protest.
1 here are two types of women on this campus who smoke. First are
those thoroughly boring ones who smoke "because it's being done." They
handle a cigarette as Cinderella would a dainty sandwich at a formal tea
and almost strangle over an accidental inhale.
Think what an excellent opportunity is offered this type which is not
skilled in the art of handling a cigarette! Consider the coughing and
choking that may now go on while poor inhaling ability is being polished.
Perfect seclusion and security now offers greater opportunity for practice.
No longer will women be forced to display poor ability in the company of
their boy friends; they will suffer practically no embarrassment when a
cigarette is proffered. And they can prove to their male companion that
they are "real good eggs." Women must keep apace of the times!
Secondly there is a type which really enjoys the satisfaction of a
toasted fag'. Tor these hypocrisy is over. No longer will these women be
forced to smoke behind locked doors and burn a cube of incense before
leaving the room. It will also be unnecessary for the boy friend Jo hold
two cigarettes while one of the "sisters" unexpectedly walks through
the room.
