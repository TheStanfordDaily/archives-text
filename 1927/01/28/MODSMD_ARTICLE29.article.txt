The Associated Women Students to- j
| day unveiled to the public gaze a re- |
| vised edition of those regulations by
! means of which they endeavor to gov- j
; ern their individual conduct. The
j things stands as a monument to the
absolute ineffectiveness of instruction
: in contemporary political faux pas.
At a time when the country is feel
! ing the ill-effects of a single law pro
hibiting the practice of one■of the 1
more violent forms of dissipation, the
enlightened women of Stanford Uni
versity blossom out with sixten col- j
) umn-inches of rules which cover in
! detail every form of social activity,
j however harmless.

Oblivious to the futility of the ges
ture. the Associated Women, by means
of legislation, have attempted to arbi
trarily define the limits of propriety.
The result is a complicated statute, the
provisions of which reduce themselves ;
to absurdities.
One of the first rules promises con
sideration by the Women's Council
of any case wherein a Stanford wo
man, by entering a place of public j
resort, shall bring disrepute on the j

jname of the University. Exceptions are
| made for those "places of public re
sort" recommended by the Associated
Women Students. The only way for
a woman to be completely safe, there
; fore, is to confine her social activities
in public to six or eight hotels in San
Francisco which have been selected,
(apparently, solely out of consideration
j for their exorbitant rates.

Another regulation specifically pro
; vides that Stanford women shall not
I walk in the hills after dark, unchape
| roned, in parties of less than six.
And are we to assume that level
ground has a less stimulating effect
| upon the Freudian impulses than have
hills? There is a brand new field of
investigation opened up here —the ef
fect of physiography upon morality.

One would imagine that a group of
presumably educated and honorable
women would be able to govern tliem
! selves by ladylike understanding, if
for no other reason than to spare the
casual reader the pain that invariably
follows the reading of such provincial
j nonsense.
