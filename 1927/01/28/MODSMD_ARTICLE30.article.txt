The Editor. Sir:
| The question of Beauty vs. Brains
has been well nourished the past three
! weeks or so, and campus arm-chair
philosophers have bandied about theo
ries on the subject with a most aston
ishing amount of self-assurance. Wed
nesday's Daily said that Stanford men
weren't as insulting as Cal men, so
| there; and Thursday's Daily said it
wasn't anybody's business anyhow.
Considering that beauty lasts but a
short while and brains last much
longer, the question seems to me a
futile one to argue about. But perhaps
a little really scientific data on the
subject will help us out.
The class in experimental psycho
logy was recently given a series of
twelve pictures of children of intelli
gence unknown to the class and told
to rate them according to their ap
pearance of possessing intelligence
from highest to lowest. Now one mem
ber of the class, being an optimist,
decided to rate these children accord
ing to degree of beauty, the most beau
tiful of the children being rated as the
most intelligent. Believe it or not, this
individual made the most nearly cor
rect rating in the class, having a cor
relation of 86 for beauty and intelli-

gence. For the uninitiated, let me say
that a perfect correlation would be 100
and would mean that the most beauti
ful was the most intelligent and the
least beautiful the least intelligent.
Eighty-six is a pretty high correla
tion. The fourteen points difference
between it and a perfect one can be
accounted for in this case by the diffi
culty of judging which of two beauti
ful children was the most beautiful.
There was no question as to which
of the children was the less beautiful.
The important point demonstrated is
that in this experiment beauty and
brains went together.
Perhaps I have proved something,
and again perhaps I have not. But at
least this data smacks of more relia
bility than any I have heard on the
subject so far. Those wishing to dis
agree will say that all Stanford people
are intelligent but that they .are not
all beautiful. True, indeed, but if they
were less intelligent they might also
be less beautiful! If anyone wishes to
undertake further research on the
•natter the psychology department will
probably welcome him gladly. And it
is hoped that inaccessibility of ma
terial will not prevent such an experi
ment. Sincerely, G. Baker.

weren't as insulting as Cal men, so
| there; and Thursday's Daily said it
wasn't anybody's business anyhow.
Considering that beauty lasts but a
short while and brains last much
longer, the question seems to me a
futile one to argue about. But perhaps
a little really scientific data on the
subject will help us out.
The class in experimental psycho
logy was recently given a series of
twelve pictures of children of intelli
gence unknown to the class and told
to rate them according to their ap
pearance of possessing intelligence
from highest to lowest. Now one mem
ber of the class, being an optimist,
decided to rate these children accord
ing to degree of beauty, the most beau
tiful of the children being rated as the
most intelligent. Believe it or not, this
individual made the most nearly cor
rect rating in the class, having a cor
relation of 86 for beauty and intelli-

gence. For the uninitiated, let me say
that a perfect correlation would be 100
and would mean that the most beauti
ful was the most intelligent and the
least beautiful the least intelligent.
Eighty-six is a pretty high correla
tion. The fourteen points difference
between it and a perfect one can be
accounted for in this case by the diffi
culty of judging which of two beauti
ful children was the most beautiful.
There was no question as to which
of the children was the less beautiful.
The important point demonstrated is
that in this experiment beauty and
brains went together.
Perhaps I have proved something,
and again perhaps I have not. But at
least this data smacks of more relia
bility than any I have heard on the
subject so far. Those wishing to dis
agree will say that all Stanford people
are intelligent but that they .are not
all beautiful. True, indeed, but if they
were less intelligent they might also
be less beautiful! If anyone wishes to
undertake further research on the
•natter the psychology department will
probably welcome him gladly. And it
is hoped that inaccessibility of ma
terial will not prevent such an experi
ment. Sincerely, G. Baker.
