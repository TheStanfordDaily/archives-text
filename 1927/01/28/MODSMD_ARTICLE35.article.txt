# Washington Inaugurates New System of Debates
## 
### 
Embodying a pseudo-judgeship and
a system of cross-questioning, an en
tirely new style of debate will be inau
gurated at the University of Wash
ington this year. The new form will
consist of twenty-minute speeches
from each team, each talk being fol
lowed by a ten-minute questioning, and
a final ten-minute summary and re
buttal for each side.
The chairman will cease to be a
figurehead and will decide upon the
relevancy of the questions asked by
the debaters. He will also act as in
terpreter of certain issues brought up.
