### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
This return bout between Paul Ber
lenbach and Mike McTigue presents
a t'ar different situation from the first
meeting. On May 30, 1925, as all those
who follow boxing know, McTigue was
the holder of the title, and he lost his
crown to the Astoria Assasin on what
many thought was a very poor decis
ion. It was an uninteresting bout, at
any rate, and Berlenbach was quite
j evidently not himself, hut few regret
j ted the passing of the crown from a
I so-called Cheese Champion to a real
fighter like Pop'em Paul.
Now these two meet again, both of
them wearing the same title of "ex
champion," and a much better battle
should result. Berlenbach, shorn of his
light-heavy honors by Jack Delaney,
realizes the foolishness of ever trying
to become a master boxer, and prom
ises to stick to his former method of
fighting—a concentrated attack with
out any regard for fancy stuff —which
brought him so much fame and wealth.
McTigue, whose surprising return to
real fighting form after his knock-out
i by Jack Delaney was one of the ring
i features of 192G, will do his utmost to
■ win. as a defeat of Paul Berlenbach
would not only eliminate the Astoria
Assasin from all consideration as a
rival of Gene Tunney's, but it would
elevate the much-abused Mike to the
select circle of "possible contenders."
, Laugh if you will —but stranger things

| have happened in Fistiana.
The rejuvenated Michael, with the
I fear of his first knock-out eliminated,
I has abandoned his defensive style of
j milling and actually put to sleep a
; few gladiators bigger and heavier than
he is. Not only that, he made Johnny
: liisko look foolish, and fans will re
| member what Risko did to Berlenbach!
So it seems that the fox, McTigue,
| has a very good chance with the ox,
i Berlenbach, but this cartoonist's lium-
I hie opinion is that if Paul fights with
| that old time blazing attack of his
I that has thrilled so many thousands,
; Bold Michael will listen to the birdies
I once more.
