Beck Tours State
Beck has talked before the student
bodies of many California high schools
and colleges. Fred L. Farley, Dean of
Men at the College of the Pacific in
Stockton, made the following state
ment after Beck's address there:
"I wish that I could tell you of the
fine reception which Mr. Beck was
given here. Judging from what other
faculty members and many of the stu
dents have told me I believe that his
address was one of the most interest
ing and fruitful assembly speeches
that we have ever had. Another speech
by Mr. Beck, if announced at any
time, would have a very enthusiastic
response."
Traits Stressed
For material for his talks, Beck
draws on his observations and experi
ences as head of the New York
Stock Exchange Personnel department
where, as personnel director, he has
had charge of organizing and training
the largest number of "teen age" boys
on the payroll of any commercial or
financial institution in New York.
"Success traits" stressed by Beck in
dealing with the boys include integ
rity, courtesy, dependability, personal
one quarter earlier than at present,
and compels students on probation to
show immediate improvement. On the
other hand it minimizes the possibility
of disqualifying a student at the end
of a quarter when his work is up to
standard. A student doing work of C J
grade might possibly be disqualified 011
general average, as at present.
With the abolition of the three-pro
bation rule, graduate students, who are
not held to a required general aver
age, will be disqualified only on de
ficiency in quarter counts. A graduate j
student who makes one count for each
registered unit may continue to regis- !
ter. j
11. All disqualifications shall be for j
three quarters.
This abolishes disqualification for j
one quarter in the case of students ;
with a previous C average. Such stu-'
dents incur the same penalty as other i
disqualified students. Students with a
previous rating of 1.50, who are now ;
automatically saved, will be given spe- j
cial action if the case requires it.i
111. A student who incurs a second
disqualification shall be ineligible for !
reinstatement.
No change is contemplated in the
present policy of making allowance
for illness, outside work, or other tem
porary interference.

address was one of the most interest
ing and fruitful assembly speeches
that we have ever had. Another speech
by Mr. Beck, if announced at any
time, would have a very enthusiastic
response."
Traits Stressed
For material for his talks, Beck
draws on his observations and experi
ences as head of the New York
Stock Exchange Personnel department
where, as personnel director, he has
had charge of organizing and training
the largest number of "teen age" boys
on the payroll of any commercial or
financial institution in New York.
"Success traits" stressed by Beck in
dealing with the boys include integ
rity, courtesy, dependability, personal
one quarter earlier than at present,
and compels students on probation to
show immediate improvement. On the
other hand it minimizes the possibility
of disqualifying a student at the end
of a quarter when his work is up to
standard. A student doing work of C J
grade might possibly be disqualified 011
general average, as at present.
With the abolition of the three-pro
bation rule, graduate students, who are
not held to a required general aver
age, will be disqualified only on de
ficiency in quarter counts. A graduate j
student who makes one count for each
registered unit may continue to regis- !
ter. j
11. All disqualifications shall be for j
three quarters.
This abolishes disqualification for j
one quarter in the case of students ;
with a previous C average. Such stu-'
dents incur the same penalty as other i
disqualified students. Students with a
previous rating of 1.50, who are now ;
automatically saved, will be given spe- j
cial action if the case requires it.i
111. A student who incurs a second
disqualification shall be ineligible for !
reinstatement.
No change is contemplated in the
present policy of making allowance
for illness, outside work, or other tem
porary interference.
Speaking on the general subject of
*'Youth in its relation to business and
industry" and particularly about "suc
cess traits," Cameron Beck, personnel
director of the New York Stock Ex
change, will address the University
assembly at 10 o'clock this morning.
Beck Tours State
Beck has talked before the student
bodies of many California high schools
and colleges. Fred L. Farley, Dean of
Men at the College of the Pacific in
Stockton, made the following state
ment after Beck's address there:
"I wish that I could tell you of the
fine reception which Mr. Beck was
given here. Judging from what other
faculty members and many of the stu
dents have told me I believe that his
address was one of the most interest
ing and fruitful assembly speeches
that we have ever had. Another speech
by Mr. Beck, if announced at any
time, would have a very enthusiastic
response."
