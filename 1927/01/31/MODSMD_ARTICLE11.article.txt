# INDEPENDENTS WIN CLOSE GAME FROM CARDINAL PLAYERS
## IRELAND'S TEAM STEADY Stanford Tries Come-Back But Falls Short, Score Ending 3 to 2 
### 
Stanford lost its first baseball game
j of the 1927 season last Saturday after-
I noon to Cliff Ireland's Independents
\ by a score of 2 to 2. The inability of
the Cardinals to come through with
hits when they were needed was the
main cause of their defeat, although
j Ireland's men played steady ball
' throughout the contest.
No Hits for Ireland
j For once. Cliff Ireland failed to get
I his traditional hit and error of which
jhe has boasted since his first team
I came to Stanford back in 1892. Per
! haps his failure in the hitting line was
! due to the fact that he left the game
|in the sixth inning, but in the field,
j the old comedian handled six chances
i without an error.
The Independents took an early lead
j in the second inning when, with two
| out, Montague walked. Puccinelli hit
j a hard one over second, and although
! Busch made a pretty stop, he could
! not make a play. While Busch was re
j covering, Montague headed for third,
jand in trying to nail him. Busch threw
| over Adams' head and allowed the
| first Independent run to cross the
: plate. Two more were added in the
j first of the sixth, when a walk, two
I doubles, and a single put Clark and
O'Keefe over the platter. This last
bombardment of hits marked the end
of Captain Collins' stay in the pitcher's
box.
Card Come-Back
| Stanford attempted a come-back in
the last of the sixth and seventh, but
fell short by one run. In the sixth,
Garibaldi singled, went to third on an
error, and scored on a passed ball.
McKee started the seventh by pinch
hitting for Adams, and delivering with
a two-base hit. He was advanced when
Sobieski was hit and drew a 'walk,
and scored when Marx was forced at
second by Davis. Attempting to score j
on the play, Sobieski was out at the !
plate.
Stanford had an excellent oppor
tunity to score in the third inning, but
Garibaldi hit into a double play and
ended the frame. Again in the ninth i
Sobieski and Rogers got on base, but i
Marx struck out and Davis made an j
infield out to end the game.
Good Prospects
Judging from the showing made by !
the varsity. Coach Harry Wolter lias ;
the makings of a real baseball team '
this year, and his men should prove a
strong conference threat.
