# ROBLE HALL, SEVEN SORORITIES BALLOT ON SMOKING ISSUE
## 
### 
Roble Hall and seven sororities
will decide tonight at their house
meetings whether their respective
members shall be allowed to
smoke in their individual living
groups or not. The other three
sororities have national rulings
against smoking in the chapter
houses, although one of these is
nationally considering modifying
the rule.
The new Associated Women
Students regulations gives all
authority in the matter of the
women's smoking to the individu
al living groups, recommending,
however, that respect be shown
for the sentiment of the Univer
sity against the practice.
