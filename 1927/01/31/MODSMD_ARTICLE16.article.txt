# JUNIOR CLASS VOTES SWEATER AWARD TO CHAMPIONSHIP FIVE
## 
### 
Junior Class basketball players who
won the interclass championship last
quarter will be given sweaters by the
class, it was decided at the meeting
of the Junior Class held Friday after
noon.
Discussion on the question of class
dues took up the greater part of the
meeting. The question was finally de
cided by turning over the problem of
class finances to an investigating com
mittee. The committee is to determine
probable expenses to be incurred by
the class during the remainder of the
year and from this set the amount of
dues.
