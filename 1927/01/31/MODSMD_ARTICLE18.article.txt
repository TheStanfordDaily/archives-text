'tnent after disqualification have been
announced by the Committee on
Scholarship.

student who goes on probation at the
end of his second quarter, or any sub
sequent quarter, must maintain a C

a student who was already on proba
tion could continue to go minus for
awhile, or could try to coast through

All disqualifications under this new
j ruling will be for three quarters. For
j merly any student who had a C aver
i age at the time of disqualification,
i could return to the University after
! only one quarter of absence.
Any student who incurs a second
disqualification will be ineligible for
I reinstatement. In past years, soma
students have been allowed to returc

Mrs. C. A. Huston, secretary of the
Committee on Scholarship, believes
that these new rules will simplify
many matters which have been sub
jects of considerable discussion.

the following changes in the scholar
ship rules will be effective:
1. A student who incurs probation
at the end of the second or any sub
sequent quarter will, so long as his
probation continues, be disqualified at
the end of any quarter in which he
fails to maintain a C average. So long
as he maintains a C average on the
work of each quarter he will not be
disqualified unless his record falls be
low the required general average.
More Severe
This abolishes the three-probation
rule and all its modifications. It is
more severe than the present rule in

appearance, obedience, thoroughness, |
and friendly attitude.

department include activities such as j
athletics and orchestra, employment, i
health of employees, financial benefits
such as insurance and pensions, per- ;
sonal service, records, salaries, and I

I tion, disqualification, and, reinstate
'tnent after disqualification have been
announced by the Committee on
Scholarship.
Beginning this spring quarter, any
student who goes on probation at the
end of his second quarter, or any sub
sequent quarter, must maintain a C
average or be disqualified. Heretofore
a student who was already on proba
tion could continue to go minus for
awhile, or could try to coast through
if he were plus.
Three Quarters
All disqualifications under this new
j ruling will be for three quarters. For
j merly any student who had a C aver
i age at the time of disqualification,
i could return to the University after
! only one quarter of absence.
Any student who incurs a second
disqualification will be ineligible for
I reinstatement. In past years, soma
students have been allowed to returc
as many as three times.
Simplify Matters
Mrs. C. A. Huston, secretary of the
Committee on Scholarship, believes
that these new rules will simplify
many matters which have been sub
jects of considerable discussion.
Beginning with this spring quarter,
the following changes in the scholar
ship rules will be effective:
1. A student who incurs probation
at the end of the second or any sub
sequent quarter will, so long as his
probation continues, be disqualified at
the end of any quarter in which he
fails to maintain a C average. So long
as he maintains a C average on the
work of each quarter he will not be
disqualified unless his record falls be
low the required general average.
More Severe
This abolishes the three-probation
rule and all its modifications. It is
more severe than the present rule in
that it takes cognizance of probation
appearance, obedience, thoroughness, |
and friendly attitude.
Subdivisions in the work of Beck's |
department include activities such as j
athletics and orchestra, employment, i
health of employees, financial benefits
such as insurance and pensions, per- ;
sonal service, records, salaries, and I
education and training of employees.
In developing the last function, Beck 1
has organized the New York Stock j
Ex< Vinge Institute, where the young j
employees are instructed in job train-;
ing for work on the floor of the Ex
change, business economics, and are
advised in regard to continuing their
studies at an evening school until
they have completed the equivalent
of a four-year high school course.
