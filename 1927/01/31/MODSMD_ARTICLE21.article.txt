# One Man's Death
## 
### 
Next Friday the good citizens of California will collectively murder
a man named Saver, who will in this case be finished oft" by the drolly
antique method of hanging him by the neck. There is much to be said
for murder. It is one of our most revered institutions. So long as it
happens to the other fellow there are few who do not applaud it in one
form or another. Quite rightly, too, as it is the world's oldest and
simplest solution of any difficulty. It may be used to answer every
question from the form of sacrifice to how much wages ought to be.
Not to mention such minor items as the proper religion, government,
and beverage!
The Sayer murder is remarkable only in vO far as the good citizens
who vicariously indulge will thereby save themselves the effort of think
ing about so many things. Intricate problems of ethics, law, and
eugenics are tangled into the one knot.
During the robbery of a Japanese store, at which Sayer was alleged
to have been present, a woman was shot and killed. One of the three
men subsequently convicted, a drug addict, confessed the actual shooting
and committed suicide. A second, avowing innocence, was hanged last
week. Now the third man, Sayer, a husband and father, is saying final
good-byes after every effort for executive clemency has failed.
Economics, psychology, sociology, jurisprudence, political science,
and sentiment galore are so far involved.
One more fact in addition makes the case a pocket classic for the
study of humanity. Sayer is feeble-minded, just a degree above being
an idiot. He married and has a three-year-old baby girl.
The good citizens of California can afford to disregard, if they have
even heard of, the academic "ologies" of the thinker. The noose is simple.
A toast to murder, perplexed mankind's best friend!
