In addition to a certain editorial of
fering, a perfect avalanche of volun
l tary correspondence has greeted the
j publication of the Women's regula
tions, in the form recently approved
! by the A.W.S.
The comment deals variously with
! these rules, and with the debate al
ready raging concerning the relation
of beauty to intelligence in women gen
erally and in Stanford women particu
larly. Between them, the correspond
ents and the editorialists appear to
have touched all possible points, ex
cept one. Unanimously, they have
overlooked one item.
The detail in question is this: an
intelligent woman, fully understand
ing the prevalent attitude toward
scholarship and feminine beauty—par

ticularly in her early years—may elect
not to study, but instead to devote her
undivided attention to social activity.
As a matter of fact, many young
women do just this. Granted that they
1 may afterward regret their choice, the
' fact remains that they tend to reduce
the chances of a university such as
Stanford to become noted for the
beauty of its female students.
* * *
On the other hand, there is this to
say: If there were twenty-five hundred
women at Stanford and five hundred
men. And if the mean average of
feminine beauty were just what it is
I now, the male gentry of this Univer
: sity would firmly believe that the
I standard of beauty was extremely
} high. Figure it out for yourself.
