j To the Editor, Sir:
Practically every one entering this
' important debate concerning the beau
! ty of the Stanford women (God bless
! them!) has based his or her argu- :
I ments on the unique assertion that i
gigantic intelligence simply rolls about
the femininity fortunate enough to
have been selected to enter this uni
v< r-jty. Prom a careful study of these
priceless manuscripts, one emerges ;
greatly in the dark, wondering just i
why it is so generally accepted that
Stanford women are mentally en
dowed.
Another situation over which it is i
• delightful to ponder is this: "Why have
the voices of girls alone heretofore j
bombarded Campus Opinion with anx- |
ious communcations? I am reminded 1
of a fire in a large building. The peo
' pie thronged into the halls. Cries !
arose of "Save the women first!" And
all the voices were those of distressed
ladies.
j The entire situation boils down to
| the omnipresent fact that if people do 1
not consider the Stanford women beau-1
tiful, no amount of arguments how
ever skillful will convince them. The
Stanford men are doubtless resigned |
to their fate by now, anyway. Besides. 1
I each girl who expresses her opinion
! concerning this matter is only at
tempting to prove her own facial at
tractiveness, for everyone knows that

no one would be more angry at living
among beautiful women than a beau
tiful woman, or any woman.
MARSHALL KIRBY.
The Editor, Sir:
The writer, who is a mere lowly
male, has noticed with interest and
pleasure the rising tide of femininity.
He hopes that the day is not far off
when the delivered females will feel
themselves independent enough to buy
the theatre tickets and pay the taxi
driver. But that is off the subject. The
main reason for this humble missive
is to bemoan the harsh bonds of pro
prietary conduct which our poor "500"
have forged for themselves. How can
they expect to hold the interest of
the Stanford rough when their stand
ard of purity is so relentlessly kept
up to 99.44 per cent. What fascination
can they possibly exert when it's a
foregone conclusion that they'll all
float and nary a one will.
And now, by sanctioning the use of
the filthy weed, they are depriving our
womanhood of one more first-rate sin.
Please, please, dear ladies, don't give
yourselves permission to say "damn"
in public places. Then there wouldn't
be any moral turpitude left.
Humbly submitted by one who
shamefacedly admits his inability to
swim the English Channel. —M.B.

The Editor, Sir:
The writer, who is a mere lowly
male, has noticed with interest and
pleasure the rising tide of femininity.
He hopes that the day is not far off
when the delivered females will feel
themselves independent enough to buy
the theatre tickets and pay the taxi
driver. But that is off the subject. The
main reason for this humble missive
is to bemoan the harsh bonds of pro
prietary conduct which our poor "500"
have forged for themselves. How can
they expect to hold the interest of
the Stanford rough when their stand
ard of purity is so relentlessly kept
up to 99.44 per cent. What fascination
can they possibly exert when it's a
foregone conclusion that they'll all
float and nary a one will.
And now, by sanctioning the use of
the filthy weed, they are depriving our
womanhood of one more first-rate sin.
Please, please, dear ladies, don't give
yourselves permission to say "damn"
in public places. Then there wouldn't
be any moral turpitude left.
Humbly submitted by one who
shamefacedly admits his inability to
swim the English Channel. —M.B.
