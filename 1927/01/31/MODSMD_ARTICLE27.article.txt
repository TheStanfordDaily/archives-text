SUTTER'S GOLD. By Blaise Cend-1
1 rars. New York: Harper and Bros, j
If the Punch and Judy antics of the ;
fictioneers weary you, if the tons of
: philosophy and the memoirs of history
weigh you down, why not leave your
dull fireside (figuratively of course)
1 and stray into the world of books that
are a little different.
The story that I am referring you to
is the history of California's early
days, and pressed upon our attention j
by an emotional Frenchman. Blaise
Cendrars.
Johann August Sutter, it seems, was
one of the world's romantic rascals.
The author finds him in May 1834 at
Runenberg, in the Swiss canton of
Basle, seeking a passport, which the
authorities prudently refuse. Sutter,
has just deserted his wife and four
children, and intends to emigrate to
America. If he cannot go lawfully, he
will go as he can. He becomes a vaga- j
bond. Then from the following ex- j
periences we gather that the man is
unquestionably a rogue.
When the grent adventurer finally
pets to California, he finds the country
suffering from a relapse into brabar
ism. The missions and their agrarian
enterprises have fallen into disrepair,
owing to the civil strife in the mother
province that had furnished them au
thority and government: so Sutter
conceives the great scheme of getting '
a concession from the Republic of
Mexico, and working his plantations
with peons, who should be shanghaied
and imported from Hawaii.
In an Incredibly short time the over- ;
lord has herds of blooded cattle, water j
j mills and windmills, smithies and

| (locks, banking connections in foreign
: money markets, and shipping on all
; the seven seas.
Strangely enough it is the discovery
of gold on his land that makes him
bankrupt and causes all his organiza
tion to fall to pieces. If he could have
had but the protection of the law as a
Texas landowner has when oil is found
on his land, he would have been richer
than any prince in Europe, just as he
i was already before the discovery of
! gold the richest of any citizen in the
! United States. I3ut this was not to be,
and Sutter's last stage of all is that of
| a mendicant, year after year petition
| ing Congress to recognize his claims
i of damage for the havoc wrought to
his property by the finding of millions
, in gold on his land. He dies with the
claim still pending, and his heirs never
have the satisfaction of a settlement
! or even a decision of the case,
j Surely, with any sort of telling at
| all, this is one of the world's greatest
romances. Students of Latin-American
1 history have long been familiar with
! it, but it is a safe guess that in no
j previous rendering has so much been
made of the opportunity to spread on
the color and heighten the drama. M.
| Ccndrars is Frenchman enough not. to
neglect fate in making up his Hat of
the dramatis personae; his aim is to
, realize on all of the possibilities of
! the tale, artistic and otherwise.
Whether it is better to have no his
tory at all or a too highly colored
version, it is not for us to say. Cer
tainly there must be outraged histor
; ians who would vote for none at all in
<*uch a dilemma. Tt would be interest-
ing to have a historian check this nar

rative. The geography is certainly
doubtful. The Missouri is here a
stream "whose waters are so pure
that eighteen miles after the junction
they can be distinguished clearly from
the muddy, turbid waters of the Mis
sissippi." This should be referred to
Mark Twain for correction.
It would be unjust not to speak of
the format and illustrations which
Harpers have provided. The paper,
typography, wood-cuts by Henry Cimi
no, and binding are notable even in
this day of attractive books.
"Lord of Himself" is the title of the
latest book by Percy Marks, author of
"The Plastic Age." This new novel,
which will be ready for publication
this week, takes up several of the
characters portrayed in his other
books, as Norry Parker, Carl Peters,
and Cynthia Day. "Lord of Himself"
presents the younger generation of
New York on a larger scale than "The
! Plastic Age."

had but the protection of the law as a
Texas landowner has when oil is found
on his land, he would have been richer
than any prince in Europe, just as he
i was already before the discovery of
! gold the richest of any citizen in the
! United States. I3ut this was not to be,
and Sutter's last stage of all is that of
| a mendicant, year after year petition
| ing Congress to recognize his claims
i of damage for the havoc wrought to
his property by the finding of millions
, in gold on his land. He dies with the
claim still pending, and his heirs never
have the satisfaction of a settlement
! or even a decision of the case,
j Surely, with any sort of telling at
| all, this is one of the world's greatest
romances. Students of Latin-American
1 history have long been familiar with
! it, but it is a safe guess that in no
j previous rendering has so much been
made of the opportunity to spread on
the color and heighten the drama. M.
| Ccndrars is Frenchman enough not. to
neglect fate in making up his Hat of
the dramatis personae; his aim is to
, realize on all of the possibilities of
! the tale, artistic and otherwise.
Whether it is better to have no his
tory at all or a too highly colored
version, it is not for us to say. Cer
tainly there must be outraged histor
; ians who would vote for none at all in
<*uch a dilemma. Tt would be interest-
ing to have a historian check this nar

rative. The geography is certainly
doubtful. The Missouri is here a
stream "whose waters are so pure
that eighteen miles after the junction
they can be distinguished clearly from
the muddy, turbid waters of the Mis
sissippi." This should be referred to
Mark Twain for correction.
It would be unjust not to speak of
the format and illustrations which
Harpers have provided. The paper,
typography, wood-cuts by Henry Cimi
no, and binding are notable even in
this day of attractive books.
"Lord of Himself" is the title of the
latest book by Percy Marks, author of
"The Plastic Age." This new novel,
which will be ready for publication
this week, takes up several of the
characters portrayed in his other
books, as Norry Parker, Carl Peters,
and Cynthia Day. "Lord of Himself"
presents the younger generation of
New York on a larger scale than "The
! Plastic Age."
