While the Pendragon Players' produc
tion of Frank Cravens' comic tragedy of
married life, "The First Year," dis
played in places the roughness of action,
and more particularly the roughness of
mechanical production, that seems inevi
tably to mark an amateur production, the
effect of the whole thing was satisfying,
due partly to the work of Guido Marx,
whose portrayal of the absent-minded
and careless Mr. Livingston was the best
we have ever seen by a non-professional.
Other factors, however, entered into
the feeling that the production was worth
while, among them the characterization
of Lynn Bramkamp, a Stanford student,
who took the lead in the part of Tommy
Tuckcr, and the work of Charles H.
Brown, playing Dr. Anderson.
Grace Livingston, played by Genevieve
Rosemary Downs, had a slight tendency
to orate her lines in a good many places,

' while her tantrums were not very con
! vincing to the audience. Mrs. Livingston,
, Grace's mother, was given a much more
realistic characterization by Isobel Marx.
Norris James also, as Dick Loring, the
romantic and unreliable rival of Tommy
| Tucker, fell into the spirit of the role.
■ Hattie, played by Helen Niebel, was not
quite sure ot herself. Harvey Murray as
Peter Barstow, and Imelda Davis as his
! theatrical wife, were good in their parts.
Guido Marx, however, gave the best
' performance of the evening as the easy

going and somewhat irritating father of
Grace. He had the audience with him
throughout, and succeeded in making a
' feeling of resentment come up in us, a
thing which seldom occurs from the ac
j tual efforts of an actor.
Lynn Bramkamp. with the difficult role
lof the bashful lover and husband of
Grace, carried off his part well. Although
he had at first a tendency to carry his
voice higher than is natural, he over
i came this later during the production.
