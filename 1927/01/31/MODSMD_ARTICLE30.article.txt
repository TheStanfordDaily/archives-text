# CALENDAR ISSUED BY REGISTRAR TO HELP STUDENTS SAVE FINES
## 
### 
With the object of saving money for i
the students by avoiding unnecessary !
fines, the Registrar's office has issued
a Stanford University Calendar, con
taining the times when various fees
are payable and study lists and othor
blanks are due."The purpose of the
University," said Registrar J. Pearce j
Mitchell, commenting on the calendar,
"is not to collect fines but to get
things done on time. Students each
quarter pay in large sums in fines
which they would not need to pay j
if they were prompt."
The new calendar has been distrib-|
uted to all members of the faculty and j
can be purchased by others from the i
accountant's office at ten cents a copy.
It will be published next year in Aug
ust. The present sheet contains, in ['
addition to the significant dates for
Â£he four quarters of the current year,
a calendar pad for the year 1927 and
a calendar showing each month from
July 1926 to December 1927.
