"The most enthusiastic edvocate of
Evolution today cannot go further
than Paul did in the verse, 'The whole
creation groaneth and travaileth to
gether until now," said Rev. Leslie
F. Learned of the All Saints Church
of Pasadena at the Memorial Church
service yesterday.
"Paul's imaginary picture was not
of a dead, inactive universe, but a
vital moving one, looking ever into
the future for a state it has not yet
reached. Paul discovered in the body
of men the climax of the evolutionary
process. The whole movement of life
develops into the corpus of humanity.
"The ultimate problem is the human
problem. The climax of the problem is
to weld individuals into a coherent
whole, able to live together in har
mony," said the speaker.
