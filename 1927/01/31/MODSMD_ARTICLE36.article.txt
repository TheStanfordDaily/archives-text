# Templeton Holds Practice Meet for Track Men
## 
### 
Despite a track that was slightly
sloppy, Coach Robert L. "Dink" Tem
pleton sent all of his track and field
candidates through their paces last
Friday afternoon. A regular meet was
held, with all races going their full
distance. The showings made were
creditable for this early in the season.
