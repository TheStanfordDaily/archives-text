noon in Encina boxing gallery decided
for Coach Harry W. Maloney the men
who will perform in the semi-finals and
finals of the Annual Winter Novice
Tournament, scheduled for tomorrow
evening at. 7:30 o'clock in the basket
ball pavilion.

for elimination purposes and also to
bring to the top the best men for the
program of the tourney, succeeded in
culling the field and unearthing ma
terial that Maloney said is of varsity
boxing calibre.
Close Competition
Five decisions rendered by Referee
Maloney after disagreement on the
part of the judges to determine the
winners of the bouts demonstrates the
evenness of the opponents and the
apparent closeness of the matches. In
two cases a fourth round had to be
fought, and one of these was declared
to be a draw, to be refought this after
noon.
Five bouts were technical knockouts,
and were stopped in the first or second
rounds.
Treanor Fights Well
The best fight of the afternoon was
in the lightweight class, when Treanor
and Birch mixed and socked each
other for every second of the three
rounds. Early in the struggle, Treanor
was slashed over the left eye by one
of Birch's many straight rights and
knocked to the ropes, but returned to
attack with an array of hooks and
body blows which gave him the deci
sion.
Harris R. Skelton, a promising fresh
man, also in the lightweight division,
put on two good scraps, both of which
he won on the referee's decision as
ja technical knockout.
| Strent Hanna, another clean-hitting
freshman, fighting in the middleweight
division at 163 pounds, was forced to
go the limit to take the judge's deci
sion from Frederick Johnson, who
proved a rugged and determined op
ponent.
Stromquist and Milligan. in the mid
dleweight class milled around in a
fast bout to wind up the program,
with the former getting the decision
due to a more carefully and scientifi
cally planned bout. Milligan. with a
little more ring experience, however,
should make a powerful varsity man
for Maloney.

Close Competition
Five decisions rendered by Referee
Maloney after disagreement on the
part of the judges to determine the
winners of the bouts demonstrates the
evenness of the opponents and the
apparent closeness of the matches. In
two cases a fourth round had to be
fought, and one of these was declared
to be a draw, to be refought this after
noon.
Five bouts were technical knockouts,
and were stopped in the first or second
rounds.
Treanor Fights Well
The best fight of the afternoon was
in the lightweight class, when Treanor
and Birch mixed and socked each
other for every second of the three
rounds. Early in the struggle, Treanor
was slashed over the left eye by one
of Birch's many straight rights and
knocked to the ropes, but returned to
attack with an array of hooks and
body blows which gave him the deci
sion.
Harris R. Skelton, a promising fresh
man, also in the lightweight division,
put on two good scraps, both of which
he won on the referee's decision as
ja technical knockout.
| Strent Hanna, another clean-hitting
freshman, fighting in the middleweight
division at 163 pounds, was forced to
go the limit to take the judge's deci
sion from Frederick Johnson, who
proved a rugged and determined op
ponent.
Stromquist and Milligan. in the mid
dleweight class milled around in a
fast bout to wind up the program,
with the former getting the decision
due to a more carefully and scientifi
cally planned bout. Milligan. with a
little more ring experience, however,
should make a powerful varsity man
for Maloney.
