# CARDINAL BASKETBALL TEAM WINS TWO LOOSELY PLAYED GAMES FROM NEVADA
## ANDERSON PLAYS WELL Stanford Mentor Tries New Starting Combination In Each Contest 
### Fred Speers 
In two too loose, raggedly played
contests with Nevada during the week
end, Stanford's varsity basketball team
chalked up a brace of victories. Fri
day's game score read Stanford 28,
Nevada 17; Saturday's score was
again in the Cardinals' favor, 27 to 10.
Play Listless
The Wolfpack had little to offer in
either game, and its listlessness was
transmitted to the Cardinals whose
passing and shooting became more
and more irregular. New starting for
ward combinations were used by the
Cardinal mentor in each of the con
tests.
Friday evening saw Captain David
and Bryant starting, while on the fol
lowing evening Bryant and Christ
started the contest. Javred and Dobson
were used alternately at center in
each clash and shared honors at start
ing.
Good Guarding
At the standing guard berth Ned
Anderson started both contests, and
his playing was perhaps the most con
sistently good brand turned in by any
of the Cardinal cage men. Vincenti at
running guard looked well at times.
