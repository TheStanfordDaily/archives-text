## 
### 
By their two victories over the Mc-
Clymond's and Polytechnic high
schools in the week-end contests, the
freshman basketball team is now one
ahead of the game, having won five
and lost four cage battles so far this
season. The scores were 35 to 31 and
28 to 17 against the respective San
; Francisco schools.
In the Polytechnic-Babe game Sat
urday night, the final outcome was
never to be doubted during the play
! ing periods. The freshmen, however,
I were poor at passing and failed to
I make more points by following the
j ball after the try for goal had been
j executed.
Friday's Game
The game Friday night against Mc-
Clymond's High School took on the
form of an American rugby contest in
the last half when both teams were
roughing each other to the extent that
there were fourteen personal fouls
called on both the babes and their
opponents during the last twenty
minutes.
The score at the beginning of the
fourth quarter stood 29 to 18 In favor
of the freshmen, and then a wave of
over-confidence struck the babes which
enabled the-Oaklanders to almost even
| the score. With two minutes to go
i and the score reading 33 to 31, the
yearlings nearly tasted defeat. It was
the fine guarding of Thompson, who
has pulled the freshmen out of many
a hole before, that kept the McCly
\ mond's team from registering the
needed two baskets which would have
given them the game.
