# SIX LIVING GROUPS VOTE FOR WOMEN'S SMOKING IN HOUSES
## 
### 
Six of the living groups stand in favor
of smoking, three have been unable to
vote because of national house rulings,
and one house has chosen to smoke ac
cording to house regulations as a result
of a vote taken in the various women's
groups last night in regard to whether
or not Stanford women be allowed to
smoke. Only one living group remained
undecided.
Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Kappa Gam
ma, Pi Beta Phi, and Sigma Kappa
have all voted to allow smoking in the
houses. Roble women, by a vote of 121
to 61, have alected to allow smoking in
the rooms of the hall.
The Clii Omega house voted in favor
of the question with three reservations.
Smoking is to be allowed upstairs at all
times, but not downstairs while there are
gentlemen callers in the house. Smoking
may go on downstairs only after 10:30
o'clock. The house as a whole decided
to go on record as disapproving of smok
ing in public places.
Because of a national house ruling,
Alpha Phi, Delta Delta Delta, and Delta
Gamma will not be able to .smoke in
their groups.
