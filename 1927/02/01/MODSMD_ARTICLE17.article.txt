# PERSONNEL DIRECTOR NAMES QUALITIES OF LEADERS IN BUSINESS
## Growth of Character Should Be Carefully Watched During College 
### 
"America is facing a shortage of
125,000 trained executives for 1930."
Stressing those qualities of charac
ter that are essential for becoming a
successful executive, Cameron Beck,
personnel director of the New York
Stock Exchange, yesterday spoke at a
University assembly, illustrating his
advice to the student body by experi
ences gained fiom personal contacts
with youth in the business world.
"Speaking to you as a business
man," said Beck, "let me say that the
decisions you are making today are
mighty important to your future life."
Here he quoted the words of Professor
John B. DeMott: "Young man, what
you are to be you are now becoming."
Explains Trade Marks
"What are you worth to your coun
try?" continued Beck. "What kind of
a trade mark are you making?" He
illustrated this point with the trade
mark on a box of biscuits which he
had brought to the platform, pointing
out that the mark was worth three
million dollars to the company and
drawing a comparison between its
worth and the value of trade marks
being made now by the youth of the
nation.
"We are all writing our letters of
recommendation and you want to bo
careful what you're writing." he de-
dared. "It is a dangerous hour in your
life when you begin to tamper with
the truth."
"Let George Do It"
"When you leave a piece of work
for George to do, be sure there's a
little George or Georgia to do it; but
the only person you can slip anything
over on is the person you see when
you look in the mirror.
"When a man says he can do 'any
thing' in this age, it generally means
nothing. I'm no longer worrying about
blind alley jobs, but blind alley people
are turning my hair grey. I like to
meet a man or woman who's willing
to pull out of a job that has no pros
pect of promotion.
"California has a right to look upon
you as leaders in any phase of life,
but you must do something to justify
it. If you have 110 special obstacles to
overcome, take a new lease 011 life
anyway; but for the most part the
worthwhile men in the United States
are those who've come up through the
school of hard knocks."

to pull out of a job that has no pros

"California has a right to look upon
you as leaders in any phase of life,
but you must do something to justify
it. If you have 110 special obstacles to
overcome, take a new lease 011 life

worthwhile men in the United States
are those who've come up through the
school of hard knocks."
"America is facing a shortage of
125,000 trained executives for 1930."
Stressing those qualities of charac
ter that are essential for becoming a
successful executive, Cameron Beck,
personnel director of the New York
Stock Exchange, yesterday spoke at a
University assembly, illustrating his
advice to the student body by experi
ences gained fiom personal contacts
with youth in the business world.
"Speaking to you as a business
man," said Beck, "let me say that the
decisions you are making today are
mighty important to your future life."
Here he quoted the words of Professor
John B. DeMott: "Young man, what
you are to be you are now becoming."
Explains Trade Marks
"What are you worth to your coun
try?" continued Beck. "What kind of
a trade mark are you making?" He
illustrated this point with the trade
mark on a box of biscuits which he
had brought to the platform, pointing
out that the mark was worth three
million dollars to the company and
drawing a comparison between its
worth and the value of trade marks
being made now by the youth of the
nation.
"We are all writing our letters of
recommendation and you want to bo
careful what you're writing." he de-
dared. "It is a dangerous hour in your
life when you begin to tamper with
the truth."
"Let George Do It"
"When you leave a piece of work
for George to do, be sure there's a
little George or Georgia to do it; but
the only person you can slip anything
over on is the person you see when
you look in the mirror.
"When a man says he can do 'any
thing' in this age, it generally means
nothing. I'm no longer worrying about
blind alley jobs, but blind alley people
are turning my hair grey. I like to
meet a man or woman who's willing
to pull out of a job that has no pros
pect of promotion.
