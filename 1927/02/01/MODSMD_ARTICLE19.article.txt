# WILBUR MAKES CONDUCT AT
## A.S.S.U. PRESIDENT COMMENTS ON DR. WILBUR'S MESSAGE 
### 
"Dr. Wilbur's letter will be pre
sented to the Executive Commit
tee tonight," said Stanley Weigel,
president of the A.S.S.U., yester
day.
"I believe it is up to student
government at Stanford, particu
larly the Men's Council, to elimi
nate the abuses referred to in the
President's letter.
"This can be done without
abolishing the bonfire or the
rally. It is merely a matter of
getting at the relatively few in
dividual students who cause the
trouble."
