## Letters Sent to Student Officials Asking for Suggestions IMPROVEMENT SOUGHT Excessive Drinking Charge; Second-Rate Comedies, Skits Disapproved 
### 
Charging that there is a too elabo
! rate waste of time 011 the part of
freshmen, excessive drinking, and pre
sentation of comedy and skits not first
class at the annual Big Game Rally,
President Wilbur, Sunday, sent letters
to student officers and faculty authori
ties expressing disapproval of the
present Big Game Rally and suggest
ing that radical changes be made for
next year.
Although President Wilbur was ab
sent from the campus at the time of the
I rally, reports of it that he received con
-1 firmed his belief that the usual abuses
I were present and that the bonfire and
i rally now represent a tradition which
! could be improved through change,
j Those addressed on the subject were:
| the president of the A.S.S.U., chairman
i*>f the Men's Council, president of the
j Women's Council, Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
; head of the men's physical education de
partment, Coach "Pop" Warner, Dean
Mary Yost, and Dean George B. Culver.
Text of Letter
Mr. Stanley Weigel, President Asso
ciated Students (Attention Executive
Committee).
Mr. William Hobro, Chairman Men's
Council.
Miss Charlotte Lovekin, President
Women's Council.
In the autumn quarter of the coming
academic year the annual football
game with the University of California
will be held in the Stanford stadium.
This means that ve will be host to a
( large number of visitors. In making
j preparations for this event, may I ask
; for your consideration of features that
have grown up in connection with the
bonfire and rally.
Complains of Abuses
It seems to me that we ought to
have liad enough experience and
enough intelligence to work out a
somewhat better procedure than is at
present used. It also seems to me'
that certain abuses are creeping in
that are not advantageous either tc. \
the University or to the success of j
the football team. While I was absent
at the time of the last rally. I have
had reports from a number of sources j
indicating that there was the usual
elaborate waste of time on the part
of the lower division students, who
particularly need all their energies i
during the last part of their first quar
ter in the University for other pur
poses. There was also an unusual
amount of drinking and some intoxica
tion. From what I learn, this was as
sociated more with certain fraternities
who have unfortunately been develop
ing of late a reputation along this par
ticular line. At the rally itself the show
presented to say the least was not
first-class. There was also some evi
dence of exuberance that went beyond
the normal and seemed to be stimu
lated by alcohol as far as certain indi
viduals were concerned. My own im
pression is that it is not advantageous
to the football team to attend the type
of rally which has developed here on
the Stanford campus.
Hopes for Improvement
May I ask that earnest considera
, tion be given to this whole question in
the hope that some more satisfactory
; and intelligent plan can be adopted.
11 should like the Encina Gymnasium
i staff, particularly those engaged in
j football, consulted as to their impres
i sions of the desirability of continuing
i the type of rally which we now have
at Stanford. Simply to go on year
after year aping a thing that has been
. done in the past with all its inadequa
cies does not seem to me to be in
telligent. I have a feeling that the
present student group can devise
j something better than we have had to
accustom ourselves to in the past.
With much appreciation of your con-
I sideration of these questions.
Very sincerely yours,
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
