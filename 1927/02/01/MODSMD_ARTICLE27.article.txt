# Heat—Bonfires and Liquor
## 
### 
The continuance of the Big Game Bonfire seems rather doubtful
this morning. It is a rather unusual time of the year to bring up any
such discussion, but President \\ ilbur yesterday pointed out-many so
called distasteful effects of the last bonfire and opened the subject for
general campus discussion.
Before opening his discussion President \\ ilbur admits his absence
from the campus at the time of the last rally and bases his criticism
upon what he was told upon his return, together with what he has
observed at past Big Game Rallies. His position is entirely justified for
it takes no thorough scrutiny or deep investigation to learn that there
was the usual elaborate waste of time on the part of lower*division
students and further there was an unusual amount of drinking. How
ever, as for the unusual amount it might be said that the term a normal
amount of drinking would be better suited. Disfavor was also shown to
the type of entertainment at the rally previous to the bonfire.
It is readily agreed that these points may be true. Nevertheless, it is
fundamentally unjust to say, as President Wilbur did, that the drinking
was "associated more with certain fraternities who have unfortunately
been developing of late a reputation along this particular line."
As for the advantages and desirability of the football team attending
a rally of the type staged last fall, the President's suggestion to confer
with the Encina gymnasium staff on this matter is most desirable. On
some occasions last fall the team failed to put in an appearance at some
of the rallies when requested to do so by the Rally Committee. At the
time many thought that the failure to appear could be attributed to the
fast that some of the gym stall were unwilling that they should do so.
But the main issues at present seemed to have devolved to a two-fold
problem:
1. Should the bonfire and rally be continued?
2. If the tradition is continued what can be done to eliminate
the drinking problem ?
1 he first problem will undoubtedly develop into an argument between
the campus sentimentalists and those who call themselves more.practical.
An argument such as this could doubtlessly continue from now until the
actual date for the next Big Game, and then it would doubtlessly still
remain unsettled.
A happy medium seems particularly appealing at this time. Follow
ing the customary line of progress the freshmen of recent years have
endeavored to construct a pyre that would outdo all previous ones as to
height and base dimensions. The happy medium would call for the
building of a pile considerably smaller than the recent ones, yet suffi
ciently substantial, ihe tendency would be to greatly lessen the number
of hours needed in construction, and should also cause a decrease in
after-cost because of the annual property damage incurred through the
gigantic search for material.
The cut in the hours of labor should at least partially satisfy the so
called practical people, while the presence of a fair-sized bonfire should
satisfy the sentimentalists.
But, on the other hand, a prolonged discussion of the drinking prob-
Jeni will bring little results. Action is necessary. As the president of
the A.S.S.U. said last night, "The Men's Council should no longer main
tain a passive attitude towards this situation. Activity with means of
prevention should be established."
Jf a prediction may be advanced—this will cause considerable dis
cussion.
