# No More Incense
## 
### 
After the official general sanctioning of women's smoking on the
campus by Women's Conference and University officials, the "500"' have
again voted on the question of smoking in their particular groups.
'J heir action follows a week of reflection and discussion. All organiza
tions voted to allow the weed within the confines of the houses and
Roble, except the three ''luckless'' sororities whose national rulings
forbid smoking.
However, one of the houses will have self-imposed regulations, so
that it will be in only the more secluded portions of the building that
ihe women will be able to puff on their cigarettes. It would seem that
the now legalized ritual must not be profaned by the eyes of the mere
male, so that the girls will not lose anything from the century-old lady
likeness.
Hut aside from these evidences of ascetism the women arc generally
seizing the opportunity to enjoy life more. After all. it seems something
of an imposition to preclude the "sisters" from being able to show off
4heir inhaling accomplishments in semi-public. *
Xow the incense trust is broken: the old-time hypocrisy is gone.
Nothing showed more conclusively that it was the sentiment of the
women that they should smoke than the vote of the women themselves,
so now the honor of the five hundred is saved. _
In the midst of the general elation following the passage of the
new regulation, there should be a pause for condoling with the three
who cannot take advantage of it.
