### 
"CASTLES IN THE AIR" at
the Wilkes. A gay, melodious, ro
mantic and merrily humorous
musical play. It is a romantic
operetta and belongs to the cate
gory of "The Student Prince" and
"Rose Marie." A well-defined
story with a tuneful score of
musical numbers having charac
ter and originality.
"LOOSE ANKLES" at the
Columbia. A play that rocks with
wise crack's. It has a whiz of a
finish and bears a close resem
blance to "Cradle Snatchers," but
appears to be brighter. With its
uproarious high spots in comedy,
it will undoubtedly please the
majority.
"WHAT PRICE GLORY" at the
Curran. The noted Fox production
occupies the screen for its sec
ond week, and, judging from com
ments, and the crowds, it is still
increasing in popularity.
"THE LITTLE SPITFIRE" at
the President. Now in its seventh
laughing week, and according to
present reports it will play in
definitely because of its increas
ing popularity.
"THE HOME TOWNERS" at
the Alcazar. This is the last week
of the popular George M. Cohan
farce. It will be followed by "If
I Was Rich." one of Broadway's
liveliest comedies.

Within the next few weeks William :
Fox's screen production, "What Price ;
Glory," probably will be the most
talked-of picture of the season in these I
parts. We have already seen the stage I
play which shocked certain people, but j
there is no need for anyone to bo
afraid of anything bawdy here. It is i

hardly the practice in screen business
Jo emblazon the titles with any curses.
The scenic effects are quite good and
the story is unfurled in a fashion that
stirs up the interest from the outset.
* * *
"Loose Ankles" certainly has some
skillful joking about life, and a few
cunning characterizations of many in
cidents. There are very few inexpert
moments in this wise-cracking farce
that is much like "Cradle Snatcliers."
Despite all the shrieks of indignation
against the "open-faced remarks" on
the stage, I have never seen a San
Franciscan walk out on the so-called
dirty plays. I suppose that many of
them are so petrified by the brazen
going-ons, that they are unable to
leave their seats until the final sin is
committed. "Loose Ankles" is a play
of gigolos and their home life, and
although not wholly chaste, I imagine
most of us can remain until the cur
tain falls without being horror-struck,
and the sodden comedy-lover, pure at
heart, may recover from the remorse
of his debauches.
To pass on to "Castles in the Air,"
a chaste and entertaining fantasy of
the musical operetta type: in it a
skeptic can be encouraged by a whim
sical visit into the brain of a debu
tante, discovering it to be unblem
ished.
It is a white, spectacular, humorous
exhibition with musical hits, and
though a bit slow, is another outlet
for those who are not fond of blushing.
You might even take your dream-girl
to this play which would amuse suf
ficely without injuring her. A bright,
sophisticated, cleanly musical comedy
that would make her laugh innocently
and intelligently though not tinting
her virginal cheeks with the ruddy
hues of shame or vulgarity. —E.L.S.

occupies the screen for its sec
ond week, and, judging from com
ments, and the crowds, it is still
increasing in popularity.
"THE LITTLE SPITFIRE" at
the President. Now in its seventh
laughing week, and according to
present reports it will play in
definitely because of its increas
ing popularity.
"THE HOME TOWNERS" at
the Alcazar. This is the last week
of the popular George M. Cohan
farce. It will be followed by "If
I Was Rich." one of Broadway's
liveliest comedies.

Within the next few weeks William :
Fox's screen production, "What Price ;
Glory," probably will be the most
talked-of picture of the season in these I
parts. We have already seen the stage I
play which shocked certain people, but j
there is no need for anyone to bo
afraid of anything bawdy here. It is i

hardly the practice in screen business
Jo emblazon the titles with any curses.
The scenic effects are quite good and
the story is unfurled in a fashion that
stirs up the interest from the outset.

"Loose Ankles" certainly has some
skillful joking about life, and a few
cunning characterizations of many in
cidents. There are very few inexpert
moments in this wise-cracking farce
that is much like "Cradle Snatcliers."
Despite all the shrieks of indignation
against the "open-faced remarks" on
the stage, I have never seen a San
Franciscan walk out on the so-called
dirty plays. I suppose that many of
them are so petrified by the brazen
going-ons, that they are unable to
leave their seats until the final sin is
committed. "Loose Ankles" is a play
of gigolos and their home life, and
although not wholly chaste, I imagine
most of us can remain until the cur
tain falls without being horror-struck,
and the sodden comedy-lover, pure at
heart, may recover from the remorse
of his debauches.
To pass on to "Castles in the Air,"
a chaste and entertaining fantasy of
the musical operetta type: in it a
skeptic can be encouraged by a whim
sical visit into the brain of a debu
tante, discovering it to be unblem
ished.
It is a white, spectacular, humorous
exhibition with musical hits, and
though a bit slow, is another outlet
for those who are not fond of blushing.
You might even take your dream-girl
to this play which would amuse suf
ficely without injuring her. A bright,
sophisticated, cleanly musical comedy
that would make her laugh innocently
and intelligently though not tinting
her virginal cheeks with the ruddy
hues of shame or vulgarity. —E.L.S.
"CASTLES IN THE AIR" at
the Wilkes. A gay, melodious, ro
mantic and merrily humorous
musical play. It is a romantic
operetta and belongs to the cate
gory of "The Student Prince" and
"Rose Marie." A well-defined
story with a tuneful score of
musical numbers having charac
ter and originality.
"LOOSE ANKLES" at the
Columbia. A play that rocks with
wise crack's. It has a whiz of a
finish and bears a close resem
blance to "Cradle Snatchers," but
appears to be brighter. With its
uproarious high spots in comedy,
it will undoubtedly please the
majority.
"WHAT PRICE GLORY" at the
Curran. The noted Fox production
occupies the screen for its sec
ond week, and, judging from com
ments, and the crowds, it is still
increasing in popularity.
