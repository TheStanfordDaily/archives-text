The hour has come for all goodly men
to rise to the glorious cause of defending
our women from the acid attacks of the
conscienceless. (Roblc chorus: Ah, at
last, a championt)
I feel it my duty as a Boy Scout and
a De Molay to defend the flower of our
Stanford womanhood—our noble 5.00.
(Let the band blare and the streamers
stream.)
The question is not "the possibility of
intelligence and beauty in one body," but
"have we the logical right to expect—
nay, hope to find any beauty at all in
feminine form in our halls of learning—
except in pictures?"
Think a second, and join me in saying
"no."
The reason lies in the notorious fact
that for a girl to enter Stanford as a
freshman, she must have almost a per
fect record in high school.

| I agree with our "Roble Psychologist"
I that intelligent girls may also be J)eauti
; iul; but I doubt, deny, and challenge any
girl that is beautiful and "charming" to
I get a perfect average in high school.
It is impossible for a girl to get the
I highest marks in the scholastic life and
at the same time take the place in social
life that her beauty, the pressing atten
tion of appreciative males,-and her vanity
drive her to fill. The scholafly path of
high marks may be sweet if there is no
other road to recognition, but it is a
miserable, ugly detour compared to the
flowery lanes of popularity open to the
more physically gracefuu.
The exceptions are refreshing monu
ments to the dishonesty of some high
school teachers.
Thank God for dishonesty!
