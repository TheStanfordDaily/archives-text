# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Folks, meet Loren Murchison, who !
has been sprinting here and there j
around the face of the globe ever since i
before the war. Most of you have'
probably met Mr, Murchison before, '
but for those who haven't, let me say
that away back in 1918, when lie was
an embryo sailor at the Great. Lakes
Naval Station, Loren won the 220-yard
dash in the National A. A. U. cham
pionships. Since that time, he has 1
won indoor and outdoor titles too num
erous to mention, and this week finds
him competing once more in the fam
ous Milrose Games at Madison Square
Garden in New York City, ready to
defend his title as king of indoor
sprinters.
To show how that crown adorns j
the noble dome of the irrepressible j
"Murch." let me say that until he hurt 1
his leg a little less than a year ago.
Loren had won around forty consecu
tive indoor sprint races. And in the
last three Milrose athletic carnivals, i
the speedy St. Louis Flyer has won
every single race in which he has
competed, which includes three races j

at 300 yards, in addition to the sprints.
Numbered among the famous oppon
ents who have bowed in defeat to
Murchison, are the three H's, Hussey,
Hubbard, and Houben, and such other
notable dash men as Bowman, Norton,
Miller, Clarke, and McAllister. Out
doors, he has beaten the more-than
famous Charley Paddock, as well as
Morris Kirksey and A 1 Leconey.
"Murch" is noted for an extremely
fast start, which is an especially handy
thing to possess if you are an indoor
sprinter, where the shorter distances
are run. It is not unusual for a
sprinter to retain top form for a
period of ten years—witness the ca
reers of Paddock and Scholz—but
Murch's personality has quite a bit
to do with his unending string of tri
umphs. Year after year, Loren is
cocky, full of pep, a great kidder, and
the "life of the party" on and off the
track. He'll never grow up, this care
free, happy-go-lucky human dynamo,
but don't think that he doesn't mix
plenty of brains with his business of
sprinting, or with his business, either!

erous to mention, and this week finds
him competing once more in the fam
ous Milrose Games at Madison Square
Garden in New York City, ready to
defend his title as king of indoor
sprinters.
To show how that crown adorns j
the noble dome of the irrepressible j
"Murch." let me say that until he hurt 1
his leg a little less than a year ago.
Loren had won around forty consecu
tive indoor sprint races. And in the
last three Milrose athletic carnivals, i
the speedy St. Louis Flyer has won
every single race in which he has
competed, which includes three races j

at 300 yards, in addition to the sprints.
Numbered among the famous oppon
ents who have bowed in defeat to
Murchison, are the three H's, Hussey,
Hubbard, and Houben, and such other
notable dash men as Bowman, Norton,
Miller, Clarke, and McAllister. Out
doors, he has beaten the more-than
famous Charley Paddock, as well as
Morris Kirksey and A 1 Leconey.
"Murch" is noted for an extremely
fast start, which is an especially handy
thing to possess if you are an indoor
sprinter, where the shorter distances
are run. It is not unusual for a
sprinter to retain top form for a
period of ten years—witness the ca
reers of Paddock and Scholz—but
Murch's personality has quite a bit
to do with his unending string of tri
umphs. Year after year, Loren is
cocky, full of pep, a great kidder, and
the "life of the party" on and off the
track. He'll never grow up, this care
free, happy-go-lucky human dynamo,
but don't think that he doesn't mix
plenty of brains with his business of
sprinting, or with his business, either!


Mercury Murchison
Folks, meet Loren Murchison, who !
has been sprinting here and there j
around the face of the globe ever since i
before the war. Most of you have'
probably met Mr, Murchison before, '
but for those who haven't, let me say
that away back in 1918, when lie was
an embryo sailor at the Great. Lakes
Naval Station, Loren won the 220-yard
dash in the National A. A. U. cham
pionships. Since that time, he has 1
won indoor and outdoor titles too num
erous to mention, and this week finds
him competing once more in the fam
ous Milrose Games at Madison Square
Garden in New York City, ready to
defend his title as king of indoor
sprinters.

the noble dome of the irrepressible j
