# BRANDSTEN PREDICTS FLASHY EXHIBITIONS IN INTERCLASS MEET
## Harrison, Holder of Inter-Scholastic Title, Races Wally O'Connor 
### 
When Reg Harrison and Wally
O'Connor meet in the 100-yard event
in the interclass swimming meet Fri
' day, the result is liable to show how
a national intercollegiate and a na
tional interscholastic champion rank
against each other, predicts Ernst
Brandsten, Cardinal swimming coach.
Many swimmers that have won
world fame, and many that hold na
tional honors, will compete in the
Encina pool. Warner Hobdy, all-Ameri
can interscholastic backstroke cham
pion, will meet some strong competi
tion when he races Bob Williams,
rated as one of the fastest men on
the coast. Carl Stevenson, winner of
the Golden Gate and the Silver Gate
classics, will also be entered in the
back contest.
Freshmen, Seniors Vie
Brandsten prophecies that the meet
will be a toss-up between the seniors
and the freshmen. The yearlings are
able to boast of Harrison in the 50
and 100, Driggs and Peters in the 220,
Thornton, Conradi, and Marx in the
breast-stroke, Hobdy in the back
stroke, and Neef and Throndson in
the diving. Countering this array, the
seniors can produce Williams and
Christensen in the 50 and 100, Brooks
in the 50 and the back, O'Connor in
the 100 and 220', Stevenson in the 220
and back, Ted Smith in the back and
diving, and Fall in the diving.
Juniors Have Strength
Leading the junior team will be Van
den Akker, 50 and 100 man, who will
also figure prominently in the relay.
Harris and Danford are both entered
in the 50 and the relay, while Smith
in the 100, Moore in the backstroke,
Klein in the breaststroke, and Mills
in the diving, must be reckoned with.
I Ophuls is one of the outstanding men
I for the sophomores, starting in the
breast. Burns will enter the 220, Valen
tine and Webster the 50, and Fonde
the diving.
All entries must be filed with Brand
sten before 6 o'clock Wednesday eve
ning. Preliminaries of the more
crowded events will be held Thursday
at 4 o'clock.
