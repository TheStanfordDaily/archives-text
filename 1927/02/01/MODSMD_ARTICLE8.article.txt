: end. Coach Husky Hunt gave his men
| a chalk talk preceding the scrimmage
i tilt, and emphasized better co-opera
j tion on signals for plays and forma
j (ions.
! In speaking of the forward situation,
viewed as poinewhat alarming because
; of occasional slumps, Coach Hunt said
! that he had no definite plans for a
' change in the regular berths.
Bryant, Christ Used
Hunt started the combination used
; in the second contest of the Nevada
j series in the scrimmage with the
1 Breakers last night. This consisted of
; Bryant and Christ, forwards, Jayred,
center, and Anderson and Vincenti,
guards. The varsity outpassed the club
team, though Breakers had plenty of
; fight to offer.
The varsity's scoring came largely
as a result of puzzling pass plays
down court rather than from clean
J breaks under the basket. Bryant and
Jayred both seemed erratic while
! Christ played a clever, clean floor
game, lightened occasionally by a neat
! drop shot.
Defense Is Good
Neither Anderson nor Vincenti left
| anything to be desired in way of gooti
i defensive play. Vincenti as usual fitted
well into offensive work, while Ander
| son was able occasionally to sneak up
j for a long shot at the basket.
