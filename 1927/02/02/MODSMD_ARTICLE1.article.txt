# EX COMMITTEE WILL REGULATE BIG GAME FIRE
## Three Members Authorized To Aid Men's Council In Liquor Problem OPERA DATE IS CHANGED No Official Delegate Will Represent Stanford in Oratory Contest 
### 
Power to delegate to its appointees the
actual administration of the building and
guarding of the Big Game bonfire was
assumed by the Executive Committee at
its meeting last night, and \natters of
discipline were .expressly left to the
Men's Council in a resolution adopted in i
response to the recent letter written by
President Wilbur condemning occurences
at the last rally and bonfire.
Condemnation of the alleged drinking
at these gatherings was also expressed by
the body, which offered its wholehearted
support to the Men's Council in devising
some method of preventing any repeti
tion of the conditions which existed last
year. Furthering this idea, three mem
bers of the Executive Committee were
authorized to be appointed to aid the
Men's Council in drawing up a plan for
eliminating this evil.
No Representative
It was decided that Stanford should
send an official representative to compete
at the Third National Intercollegiate
Oratorical Contest on the subject of the
Constitution. This in no way prevents
any student from entering the contest
unattached. It merely limits him from
styling himself as the official representa
tive of the University.
The report of the chairman of the
Election Board announcing the election
of Wilbur Adams as editor of the Stan
ford Daily was accepted.
Amending the By-Laws to change the
time of closing the nominations for the
mid-yecfr election was also .accomplished,
the date of the Junior opera was changed
to May 7, and May 6 granted as a closed
date for the Junior Prom. V
