# BABES SENT THROUGH STIFF PRACTICE; NEW COMBINATIONS TRIED
## Long, Garibotto Appear in Forward Position in Shifted Line-up 
### 
Scrimmage was issued in a hard mea- j
sure to the freshman squad yesterday in j
preparation for their games with Salinas |
High School Friday night and the Santa j
Barbara State Teachers team Saturday i
' I
night.
Long and Garibotto appear as a new j
combination of forwards that will push 1
any other pair on the floor. Stewart has I
apparently recovered from the slump he '
suffered last week and is back in his old j
position at forward with Berg as his !
running mate.
Forwards Different
These two sets of forwards give the j
coaches two different types which may j
come in handy in shifting to another |
style of play. Garibotto and Long, while 1
a trifle short, are speedy and very ag- j
gressive. On the other side, Berg is a i
dead shot and Stewart is good at passing j
and getting the ball to Berg. Both of j
these men use the side-line system of !
playing.
Russell, a hcw member on the squad, j
looks like good material for center. Al- j
though he has only been out a few nights,
he has shown ability for that position. If
he can raise the initial standard of his;
first appearance, Coaches Hunt and |
Mitchell have a good prospect for that j
place 011 the team.
Bush Hurt
Bush, regular center, hurt his ankle |
Monday night and had to favor it de- j
cidedly in the scrimmage yesterday. In j
case lie will not be able to play the full i
four quarters of the game, tUe mentors j
may give Russell a try at that position.
Thompson, star standing guard, has j
been missing from practice the last few j
nights as lie was called home 011 account j
of ilhi**s of his father. Whether he will 1
be able to play in the two games is not !
known yet. but it is thought that he will j
be on hand to start the games at his old j
position.
In case Thompson is absent, Coach |
Mitchell will probably shift Bush to!
standing guard with Simpkins and fill 112
Bush's center position with some substi- j
tute, either Rothert, Russell, or Stein- j
beck. Albertson was tried out at stand- j
ing guard but did not show up well. He i
has plenty of height and with more exper- 1
ience should prove himself capable of 1
capturing a position.
