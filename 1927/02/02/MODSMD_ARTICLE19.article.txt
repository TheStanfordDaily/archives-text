# MUSSOLINI WORKING TO REBUILD IMPERIAL ROME SAYS BURCHELL
## Leader Fired with Love for Italian Capital, Fosters Pride in City 
### 
"Mussolini is working to rebuild Itn- j
! perial Rome with the free hand that was |
| needed," said Henry Burchell, secretary
: of the Italy-America Society, last night
! at the Tuesday evening lecture.
"He is fired with a passionate love for
j Rome which has been communicated to
I the Italians; they, filled with a new pride
j in their city and a self-respect that is the
j heart of their patriotism, are supporting
Ito the full Mussolini's plans, even are
j submitting to heavy taxation."
City Plan Made
Burchell explained the city plan that
! has been adopted by the national govern
jment for rebuilding Imperial Rome. A
j shifting of the center of activities from
I the crowded old section to the new busi
incss district, without ruining old Home,
j but welding together the now scattered
! elements is the main problem. By creat- i
! ing a new capitol on the hill and remov- j
ling the railroad tracks from the heart of
new Rome, the shifting of activities will!
I be accomplished and at the same time the I
; whole enterprise will be financed, the J
j value of the reclaimed land covering all!
I
expenses.
Since Mussolini's term began, in 1922,
many improvements have been put in, al
| though intensive activity did not begin
] until last April. Gas, electric lighting,
| drainage, and water systems have been
j installed; modern government buildings
j and bridges have been built; the greatest
j attention, however, has been devoted to
j building modern tenements, because not
i until the growing population has been
I housed can the old buildings be torn
i down.
New Edifices Built
"All the new buildings are being made j
' to conform to the architectural style of j
| the background," continued Burchell. j
I"The most modern means of comtnunica- j
tion arc being installed, including a new j
thoroughfare which will become the back- j
j bone of Rome and which will eliminate |
; much of the present congestion.
"To accomplish much of the rebuilding, i
it will be necessary to tear down old I
IT" 1
j buildings, but the Italians arc on guard j
j against vandalism and will destroy only)
I those buildings having no architectural
â–  value. Other plans include forming a
J civic center &nd establishing a university
i center."
