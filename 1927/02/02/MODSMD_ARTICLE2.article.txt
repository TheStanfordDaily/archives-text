In the words of Harry Maloney, it
was "the best novice tournament the Uni
versity has ever staged. The calibre of
the boxing and the cleanliness and sports
manship shown has never been excelled
in a novice or any other tournament on
the campus, and the presence of a good
turnout of co-eds was an added proof of
the success of the sport here."
