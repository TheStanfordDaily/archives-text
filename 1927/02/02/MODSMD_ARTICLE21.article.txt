# CARDINALS PUT THROUGH STIFF PRACTICE TILTS
## Varsity Scrimmages Against Independents; Christ, Bryant at Forward BADGRO SPEEDY THREAT Southern California Presents Fast Defensive Game; Laraneta Clever 
### Fred Speers 
With the two-game U.S.C. series but
a scant two days away Coach Husky
Hunt's men are going into an in
creasingly stiff schedule of practice
so as to reach top form Friday night
for the initial whistle of Stanford's
second conference game. The Cardi
nals have a narrow one-point victory
already chalked up over the Southern
ers but that slim margin is not enough
to make for any confidence on the
part of Hunt's men.
Another scrimmage tilt was handed
to the varsity last night, this being an
independent team. The Cardinal men
tor used as his starting lineup the
same one which was used before
against the Breakers. Christ and Bry
ants, forwards, Jayred, center, Vin
centi and Anderson, guards, seems to
be the probable starting lineup for
next Friday night.
Substitutions Made
After about, fifteen minutes several
substitutions were made, McCandless,
erstwhile forward, going in for Jayred
at the pivot berth. Whether McCand
less' will get into the U.S.C. contests at
this berth is problematical and de
pendent largely upon his showing in
these practice scrimmages.
Stanford's greatest problem as
shown by the first game with U.S.C.
will be to check Badgro, flashy South
ern forward and key man of the
1 rojan attack. Southern California
presents a strong defensive game bol
stered up greatly by the heady work
of Laraneta, standing guard, and the
cool playing of Bruner, center.
Attack Needs Speed
Breaking up the Trojan defense will
become easier when the Cardinals'
running attack speeds up, the need
for speed having been emphasized last
week against Nevada. However, the
Nevada series showed that slow play
ins? was a contagious thing, for the
Cardinals, had they faced a more
speedy team, would undoubtedly have
played a far better brand of ball.
