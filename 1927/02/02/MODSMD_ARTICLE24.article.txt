The deadline for nominations lias been moted forward one day.
This fact must not be overlooked by those intending to make nominations !
Year after year the closing- day has brought a veritable flood of new
candidates. In fact, it is the usual thing to leave many offices without
candidates until the last moment. Unless it be remembered that the
nomination box closes Thursday at 6 o'clock it is highly possible that
the polls will open with the ballots showing no candidates for several of
the offices.
Many of the so-called "conservatice" students are purported to scorn
the term "politics" and refuse to "dabble in the mess." However, if
student government is to justify its title—it should be of, by, and for
the students. Jt should not be government for all—by a small clique.
If there is any interest in this matter it should be shown this week.
Now is the time for nominations.
