Objecting to the inebriety and gen
eral moral laxity that has marked the
annual Big Game bonfire rally, the
president of the University has writ
ten to the president of the student
body and to the chairmen of the Men's
and Women's Councils suggesting that
steps be taken to eliminate these evils.
In his letters, the president has also
gone on record as opposing "the elabo
rate waste of time upon the part of
lower division students" which is
necessary in building the bonfire.
In view of the attitude expressed
toward this matter by The Bull Ses
sion of October twenty-eighth, it need
hardly be said that we are immensely
cheered by the president's action, in
spite of the fact that his opposition
to the institution is founded on some
what different grounds than our own.

As a matter of fact, if one cares to
go into the matter in detail, he may
find any number of things wrong with
the Big Game Rally. First and fore
most, it fails altogether to accom
plish Its purpose, which is to get the
emotions of the team and student body
properly co-ordinated for the task of
beating California. Although the presi
dent is apparently not aware of the
i fact, it has been the practice of the
coaching staff to take the team off the
.
j campus the night of the bonfire. It is
; obvious, then, that whether or not the
i bonfire arouses any desirable enthusi
asm. that enthusiasm is certainly not
imparted to the varsity.
Aside from the fact that the bonfire
may be regarded as a futile gesture, it
does entail an enormous amount of
work —work done grudgingly, by un-
I interest d freshmen. The Bull Session
called attention to this fact several

months ago, and at that time classified
the rally as an unnecessary nuisance.
* * *
The first man to leap to the defense
of the rally was the president of the
associated students. He admits that
the rally has been marked by excesses
in the past, but feels that it can be
continued in the future with the un
desirable features eliminated.
May The Bull Session make bold
ito ask the student body president
! what possible point there could be in
preserving the bonfire if we are to do
away with drinking? It has been
j demonstrated that the bonfire serves
! no purpose in helping to win the Big
Game. If then, the bonfire is to be
transformed from a saturnalia into
something resembling a glorified
weiner roast, it might just as well be
| abolished. In view of the fact that
public support of the rally has not
I been up to par in recent years, de
spite the fact that it offered an oppor-
I tunity to become pleasantly boiled, is
; it not too much to assume that there
, would be any interest whatsoever in
the rally if it should degenerate into a
j sober affair? •
The Bull Session has pointed out
before that no reasonable man can be
expected to march about the campus
; and yell for two hours if he be per
fectly sober, not even if the Adminis
tration Building were to be ignited to
give him something to yell about. If
there is to be no drinking at the rally,
let it be abolished. Certainly the fresh
men would be pleased. The remainder
of the student body would not be par
ticularly put out. And as for the alum
ni—they should by this time have be
come inured to the demise of those
traditions reverently handed down
from the palmy days of yore.
