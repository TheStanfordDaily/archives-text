j The Editor, Sir :
Not long ago. Professor Beach wrote
i an article indirectly stating that the
knowledge factory is grinding out quan
tity instead of quality; furthermore, that
college students were aimless, egotistical,
J and had little initiative—True! But why?
Before we enter the university, the
word "Kollege" means "Rah! Rah 1"
When we arrive, however, we are told
that the main attraction is to get knowl
j edge. First, the professors tell us what
| they have read and think, then we are
handed a syllabus telling us what books
and what pages to read—Fine! The first
I quarter passes and we have either flunked
! out or learned to write what the profes
sor or instructor wants. It gets mighty
tiresome going through this rope-skipping
process year after year, and attending
the same wornout performance. It takes
i a darn good show to attract the interest
; of the same crowd for repeated per-
I formanccs. Obviously, the students turn
from the main event to the varied at
tractions of the side shows, and, believe
ine, the side shows are getting the big
gest crowds. Why can't we have some
new acts in the big show; sutne that will
make us think? Mimicry and artificiality
seem to be a college plague.
Your sincerely,
ERNIE GUFFIN.
The Editor, Sir:
I sincorcly regret, that I have neg
lected that, part of my education which
includes adjectives. The only I
can think of at the present writing
would bo expressive, but not polite.
But to the point.
I went to the general student body
assembly Monday morning and heard
Cameron Beck speak. I must admit
even at the risk of being ostracized
by the Campus elite, that I enjoyed
every word Mr. Beck said. According
to nudges, bright? remarks, and
smiles, only freshmen and morons
should believe a talk like that. This
artificial sophistication which, accord
ing to many, is one of the prerequi
sites to a sheepskin, give me a pain.
Does one have to believe in Santa
Clans in order to intoliig* ntlv follow
a talk such as heard Monday? One
seems to be in danger of being con
sidered from the country or a reader j
of Horaiio Alger if he enjoys such
talks. Ono big he-ninn with a '28 fob
(I am sorry to say) and a slouchy gait,
said as he pushed his way through
the door, "I've listened to that kind of

I bull before, why don't they give us a
! change?"
I will grant that some of ihe "bright
and smiling faces" line was a bit
trite, but Mr. Beck evidently forgot
for a moment 1 fiat there were many
worldly-wise, misunderstood individu
als numbered in his audience,' who are
i all ready to step into $10,000 a year
jobs, when they graduate—and find
the job. One is almost afraid to say
j that he enjoys anything that is backed
by common sense and sincerity. The
; sneers and shrugged shoulders are
j too obvious to the one who is plebian
enough to admit the crime of enjoying
something that is not risque or ob-
I scene.
The so-called intelligent men of the
; campus have used many hours of time
discussing the campus women these
past few days. There is much argu
ment. but they all do admit that the
women are intelligent. That is 'some
thing that can not be said of these
i blas6 humans who go to college in
order to learn big words which they
i spring on the folks back home. A par
| rot can talk but he doesn't reason —
j and we have lots of parrots.

| The Editor, Sir:
I read with much interest President
| Wilbur's letter as printed in the Daily
for February 1, regarding the bonfire
rally and the characteristic abuses
| which are manifested in connection
with it.
I wish to especially speak of that
; evil referred to by President Wilbur
;at the rally, but even the nightly
j guardings of the pyre were little more
than drunken brawls for a majority
of those present.
The bonfire rally is over, but from
'the appearances of many places in
Encina on Saturday and Sunday morn
ings and even throughout the week
one would think that there was a bon
lire rally every week end. And while
I very well realize that it would bo
impossible for the sponsors to control
the situation as it existed at the rally,
1 believe that it certainly behooves
them to open their eyes to this sort
of thing, which they have ser-med to
ignore in the past, and to reverse their
policy from one of a passive type of
resistance, with a counseling word ,
here and there, to a more active and
effective type.

from the main event to the varied at

The Editor, Sir:
I sincorcly regret, that I have neg
lected that, part of my education which
includes adjectives. The only I
can think of at the present writing
would bo expressive, but not polite.
But to the point.
I went to the general student body
assembly Monday morning and heard
Cameron Beck speak. I must admit
even at the risk of being ostracized
by the Campus elite, that I enjoyed
every word Mr. Beck said. According
to nudges, bright? remarks, and
smiles, only freshmen and morons
should believe a talk like that. This
artificial sophistication which, accord
ing to many, is one of the prerequi
sites to a sheepskin, give me a pain.
Does one have to believe in Santa
Clans in order to intoliig* ntlv follow
a talk such as heard Monday? One
seems to be in danger of being con
sidered from the country or a reader j
of Horaiio Alger if he enjoys such
talks. Ono big he-ninn with a '28 fob
(I am sorry to say) and a slouchy gait,
said as he pushed his way through
the door, "I've listened to that kind of

I bull before, why don't they give us a
! change?"
I will grant that some of ihe "bright
and smiling faces" line was a bit
trite, but Mr. Beck evidently forgot
for a moment 1 fiat there were many
worldly-wise, misunderstood individu
als numbered in his audience,' who are
i all ready to step into $10,000 a year
jobs, when they graduate—and find
the job. One is almost afraid to say
j that he enjoys anything that is backed
by common sense and sincerity. The
; sneers and shrugged shoulders are
j too obvious to the one who is plebian
enough to admit the crime of enjoying
something that is not risque or ob-
I scene.
The so-called intelligent men of the
; campus have used many hours of time
discussing the campus women these
past few days. There is much argu
ment. but they all do admit that the
women are intelligent. That is 'some
thing that can not be said of these
i blas6 humans who go to college in
order to learn big words which they
i spring on the folks back home. A par
| rot can talk but he doesn't reason —
j and we have lots of parrots.

| The Editor, Sir:
I read with much interest President
| Wilbur's letter as printed in the Daily
for February 1, regarding the bonfire
rally and the characteristic abuses
| which are manifested in connection
with it.
I wish to especially speak of that
; evil referred to by President Wilbur
;at the rally, but even the nightly
j guardings of the pyre were little more
than drunken brawls for a majority
of those present.
The bonfire rally is over, but from
'the appearances of many places in
Encina on Saturday and Sunday morn
ings and even throughout the week
one would think that there was a bon
lire rally every week end. And while
I very well realize that it would bo
impossible for the sponsors to control
the situation as it existed at the rally,
1 believe that it certainly behooves
them to open their eyes to this sort
of thing, which they have ser-med to
ignore in the past, and to reverse their
policy from one of a passive type of
resistance, with a counseling word ,
here and there, to a more active and
effective type.

Before we enter the university, the

| The Editor, Sir:
I read with much interest President
| Wilbur's letter as printed in the Daily
for February 1, regarding the bonfire
rally and the characteristic abuses
| which are manifested in connection
with it.
I wish to especially speak of that
; evil referred to by President Wilbur
;at the rally, but even the nightly
j guardings of the pyre were little more
than drunken brawls for a majority
of those present.
The bonfire rally is over, but from
'the appearances of many places in
Encina on Saturday and Sunday morn
ings and even throughout the week
one would think that there was a bon
lire rally every week end. And while
I very well realize that it would bo
impossible for the sponsors to control
the situation as it existed at the rally,
1 believe that it certainly behooves
them to open their eyes to this sort
of thing, which they have ser-med to
ignore in the past, and to reverse their
policy from one of a passive type of
resistance, with a counseling word ,
here and there, to a more active and
effective type.

j The Editor, Sir :
Not long ago. Professor Beach wrote
i an article indirectly stating that the
knowledge factory is grinding out quan
tity instead of quality; furthermore, that
college students were aimless, egotistical,
J and had little initiative—True! But why?
Before we enter the university, the
word "Kollege" means "Rah! Rah 1"
When we arrive, however, we are told
that the main attraction is to get knowl
j edge. First, the professors tell us what
| they have read and think, then we are
handed a syllabus telling us what books
and what pages to read—Fine! The first
I quarter passes and we have either flunked
! out or learned to write what the profes
sor or instructor wants. It gets mighty
tiresome going through this rope-skipping
process year after year, and attending
the same wornout performance. It takes
i a darn good show to attract the interest
; of the same crowd for repeated per-
I formanccs. Obviously, the students turn
from the main event to the varied at
tractions of the side shows, and, believe
ine, the side shows are getting the big
gest crowds. Why can't we have some
new acts in the big show; sutne that will
make us think? Mimicry and artificiality
seem to be a college plague.
Your sincerely,
ERNIE GUFFIN.
The Editor, Sir:
I sincorcly regret, that I have neg
lected that, part of my education which
includes adjectives. The only I
can think of at the present writing
would bo expressive, but not polite.
But to the point.
I went to the general student body
assembly Monday morning and heard
Cameron Beck speak. I must admit
even at the risk of being ostracized
by the Campus elite, that I enjoyed
every word Mr. Beck said. According
to nudges, bright? remarks, and
smiles, only freshmen and morons
should believe a talk like that. This
artificial sophistication which, accord
ing to many, is one of the prerequi
sites to a sheepskin, give me a pain.
