Pioneers in the field of medicine arc
the authors of the works now on ex
hibit in the show cases at the head of
the stairs in •the Library. Beginning
with the Arabs, the collection gives var
ious steps in the history of medicine up
to the end of the seventeenth centnry.
The earliest work shown is one by A 1
]lazciij Arab anatomist and surgeon or
the eighth century. Another display is
a Latin translation of the works of Mu
hammed ibn Zakariya, Abu Bakr, and
A 1 Razi, tenth century Arabs, together
with a later English translation. The
book is a large volume printed in
mediaeval script.
European Work Shown
The first European whose works are
in the exhibit is Arnold of Villanova,
who the accompanying note says, was a
doctor of theology, law, philosophy, and
medicine, and not a very profound
scholar of the thirteenth century. He
wyote a number of books combining Arab
medicine with European alchemy.
Leonardo da Vinci, who lived from
1452 to 1519, figures in the exhibit, al
though his work did not influence his
contemporaries because his notes were
lost after his death, and were not found
until recently. They were published be
tween 1908 and 1914.
Old Treatise Displayed
Andrea Lacuna, who lived at about
the same time as da Vinci, is the author
of a brief surgical treatise of 1555 found
m the collection. He was a minor anato
mist at Padua, and published a hand
book of anatomy in 1535.
In the sixteenth century there were
more medical men who contributed to
the progress of the science, according to
the exhibit, which shows books by four
of them. A copy of the first edition of
the work of Andreas Vesalius, the re
former of anatomy, is among the books.
There is also a woodcut portrait of
Vesalius.
Brain Studies Made
Studies of the brain were important
among the works of Bartolomco Kus
tachio, who lived at the time of Vesalius,
although his writings were not published
until 1714. The book in the collection is
dated 1722, and is stated to be identical
•with the first edition.
Colored illustrations were first used
in medical treatises by Gasper A sell i,
whose l»ook, "De Lactibus," appears in
the ease. It was published in Milan in
1627.
Among the seventeenth century works
is a copy of the original edition of Wil
liam Harvey's volume on embryology,

lent by Professor C. H. Dan forth. Har
vey did not publish all of his findings,
as many of bis manuscripts were de
stroyed by the soldiers' of Cromwell.
Another work on embryology is Mar
cello Malpighi's "De Ovo Incubato,"
which deals with the embryology of the
chick. Malpighi was the founder of
microscopic anatomy.
