# GENE KLOSS ETCHINGS REMAIN ON EXHIBIT UNTIL FEBRUARY 16
## 
### 
The exhibition of thirty etchings by
Gene Kloss, which has been in the j
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery |
since January 23, will continue until J
February 16.
The collection is being enjoyed by J
all the gallery visitors. Gene Kloss !
I
shows a versatility of technique and
print methods which, combined with !
well arranged compositions, make the j
etchings charming pictures.
Gene Kloss includes three distinct
print methods in this exhibition. They
are: etched line, dry-point, and aqua
tint. The etched line is obtained by
having the lines which the artist has
drawn with a steel point etched with
acid into the metal plate. These lines
hold the printing ink which is then
printed onto special paper
Dry-Point Method
The dry-point method is obtained by
inking, with printing ink, the lines
which the artist has drawn or j
scratched with a sharp steel point into i
the metal surface without etching. Al- 1
though dry-points are termed etchings, !
they are not etched.
The aquatint is a method which pro- !
duces printed areas of shades instead j
of lines. This is obtained by covering i
the printing surface with a fine pow- i
der which allows the acid to etch j
masses of pin-point holes. Some areas j
are allowed to etch longer than others !
by covering the unetched parts with j
acid-resisting point. Thus when the
plate is finished it will print pictures j
with halftone shades instead of lines, j
Kloss Etchings
Some of the subjects of the Gene ;
Kloss etchings are: "The Old Bridge," |
"The Sieel Factory," "From Telegraph !
Hill." "Spanish Shawl," "Archway at i
Stanford," and "Bridge in Burlingame." j
One entitled "Bisbee, Arizona," is an i
etching with a strong quality of liue
of technique that lends itself very liar-!
moniously to the etching.
Among the very good dry-points the '
"Monterey Cypress" is worthy of spe- \
cial mention. "Carmel Evening" and 1
"Adobe Dusk" are delightful little!
aquatints which would grace a corner
in any home.

Kloss Etchings
Some of the subjects of the Gene ;
Kloss etchings are: "The Old Bridge," |
"The Sieel Factory," "From Telegraph !
Hill." "Spanish Shawl," "Archway at i
Stanford," and "Bridge in Burlingame." j
One entitled "Bisbee, Arizona," is an i
etching with a strong quality of liue
of technique that lends itself very liar-!
moniously to the etching.
Among the very good dry-points the '
"Monterey Cypress" is worthy of spe- \
cial mention. "Carmel Evening" and 1
"Adobe Dusk" are delightful little!
aquatints which would grace a corner
in any home.
