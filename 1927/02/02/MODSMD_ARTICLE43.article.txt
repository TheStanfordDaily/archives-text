# MIDDLE DISTANCES, WEIGHTS ARE BEST 1930 TRACK EVENTS
## Dearth of Milers, Sprinters On Freshman Squad Worries Coach 
### 
Taking the few Friday meets which
have been held with the varsity up
to this date as a basis, the greatest
strength of the freshman track team
seems to lie in the middle distances
and in the weights.
The outstanding middle-distance
men are Morrison and Kingsbury, two
boys who have been running the quar
ter-mile under 53 seconds. These two
have been pressing the varsity 440
men, Babcock and Spencer, in every
race, and occasionally have beaten
them to the tape. That this is a really
remarkable record is evidenced by the
fact that Babcock ran right behind
Ted Miller and Bill Stone all last
year.
880 Strong
In the half Lawshe and Jennings
have shown up best. Both have been
taking the two laps in 2:10 or better,
which is not bad time for first-year
men at this time of the year.
The weight events look very strong
on paper with Krenz in t lie shot and
discus, Hobdy in the shot, and Kibbe
in the javelin. Krenz has sliowu real
championship ability in his perform
ances in his two events; in the meet
last Friday he put the shot over forty J
live feet and threw the discus well
over the hundred and forty foot mark.
Hobdy lias done well in the shot with
heaves of over forty feet, while Kibbe
lias thrown the javelin over a hundred
and fifty feet consistently.
The jumps look very promising, al
-1 hough the pole vault appears to be
woefully weak. Heights of 5 feet 10
have been reached by French and
Johnson, while Dow and Beattie have
reached 21 feet in the broad jump.
No sprinters or distance men have
shown anything startling, as yet, and
all have failed to give varsity men any
serious competition. Eddie has run
some good races in the sprints, but
needs quite a bit of developing, and
Nunes lias shown the most promising
ability in the distance events.
