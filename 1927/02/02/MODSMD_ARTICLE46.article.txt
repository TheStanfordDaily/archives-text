# STRENGTH NEED OF GRADUATE WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION-YOST
## 
### 
Dean Mary Yost, at the meeting of
the Graduate Women's Club yesterday
afternoon, stressed the need of the
club for organizing itself into a body
that will be strong enough to promote
its own welfare and make itself felt
as an active factor in university life.
Although there is now a definite
quota of graduate women, the contem
plated abolition of the lower division
will render it necessary to enlarge that
group. For this group of non-Stanford
graduate women who have not made
previous social contacts here the club
will fill a definite need. If the graduate
men would join with the women to
form a larger graduate club there
l would be a common interest provided
j for the graduates as a whole, who
often know only the members of their
particular department.
Dean Yost suggested that it might
be desirable to combine the Club's
present social features with academic
interests such as the reading of re
search papers or general discussions.
She also stressed the desirability of a
residence for the graduate women liv
ing on the campus, providing a center
for the social life. This question is
being agitated, she declared, and
would be given definite consideration
as soon as University finances per
mitted.
