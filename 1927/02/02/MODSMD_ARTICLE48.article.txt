# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FFG" MURRAY, '16 
The Time —Saturday, October 2,1026.
The Place—The Yankee Stadium,
New York.
The Boy—Taylor Lee Douthit, young
center-field<*r of the St. Louis Cardi
nals.
To go more into detail, Mr. Douthit
was the first battei*to face Mr. Herbie
Pennoek, the well-known left-hander,
in the first game of the first world
series that the Cardinals had ever
played in. Of course, too, it was Tay
lor Douthit's first world series, for
had he not joined the Cards barely
over a year before, and wasn't it ask
ing quite a bit of a rookie to be the
lead-off* man in such an important
event as the New York-St. Louis
world's championship series? He had,
and it was.
Whang! As nice a hit as you could
hope to see bounced off the bat of
young Mr. Douthit, and while the fa
mous Mr. Babe Ruth was chasing the
bounding baseball up to the right field
fence and then away from it, the un
famous Mr. Douthit, of the Oakland,

l California, Douthits, was running to
second base. Thus was the first hit
of the Cardinals first world series
made by a lad playing his first full
season in the major leagues.
| Hark now to what happened in the
i fourth inning of the fourth game—the
: game in which the mighty Bambino
! broke loose with those three home
! runs. With Tony Lazzeri reposing on
i first base, Jumping Joseph Dugan
raised a short fly to left-center field
; that was pursued most strenuously
| by both our young hero, Mr. Douthit,
jand his colleague, Mr. Chick Hafey,
; who plays left field for the Cardinals.
iTo make a long story short, the two
I gentlemen collided while running at
I fop speed, and both were temporarily
knocked out, Mr. Lazzeri scoring from
I first base. But to show that a K.O.
j meant nothing in the life of a native
i son, Douthit came right buck to throw
! Dugan out at the plate 011 the next
I play, and in the next inning he knock
jed a resounding double. But the col-
I lision proved too much for our young

hero after the game was over, and Mr.
Douthit was forced to retire from the
1920 world series after batting ,2t>7
and fielding 1.000 in four games.
There is no doubt in my mind that
you will hear much of Taylor Lee
Douthit as a capable outfielder in
future years. Any lad who can bat
.307 and steal twenty-four bases in his
first major league season, and prove
, his coolness and gameness, as Douthit
| did in his first world series, should
travel far along the road of success
in baseball.
