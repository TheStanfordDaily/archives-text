1W by a score of 21 to 3 in one of the j
fastest games played yesterday in the |
intramural basketball tournament. Tvvoi
defaults were among the day's results,
Encina IE forfeiting to Delta Tau Delta, j
and Branner IF to the Breakers.
Outclassing Encina 1W in every de- 1
partment of the game, the A.T.O.'s easily i
won by a 21 to 3 score. Hossom was |
easily the star for fraternity team, ,
his clever floor work contributing 10 j
points towards the score.■iThe outcome of |
the game was never in doubt from the
start, for the first-year five were no
match for the winners, being unable to |
guard or to shoot when they got a j
chance.
In the first game of the afternoon, En
cina 5 outplayed the Betas in the last
half, after leading 9 to 7 at the end of j 1
the first period. Mainwaring and Robin- j
son were the main cogs in the Encina
team. Robinson guarding and intercept- j
ing passes, and Mainwaring doing most j
of the scoring as high point man of the j
game. Thomas played an all-around good i
game for the Betas, but was unable to :
make his shots count.
Los Arcos Breaks Tie
In what promised to be the best game
of the afternoon at half time, Los Arcos
broke a tie and defeated the D.U. five,
19 to 10. The first half was hard and
evenly fought, ending 4 to 4. In the
second period the fraternity men slowed
up considerably and the Los Arcos ag
gregation improved in its teamwork. By
clever floor tactics they were able to
score 15 points to 6 for their opponents.
Otis and Valentine were tied for high
point honors for Los Arcos, with 6 points
each. Beardsley played a consistently
good floor game for the winners, while
Vermilya was the outstanding man on
the D.U. five.
The only game played in the evening
resulted in the utter overwhelming of the
Chinese Club by El Campo, 32 to 12. The
losers played a hard game, following the
ball at times, and showed plenty of grit
in scrapping their taller opponents. If
the Chinese had been able to make their
free throws and more of their tries for
field goals good, the game might have
been a different story. Pan was the bul
wark of the Chinese defense, advancing
time after time to sink a sensational shot.
Wong was another of the men that con
tributed to the losers' total. Making 16
tallies from under the basket, Holmes
kept the Chinese on the go throughout
the game. Britten and Siemon took a
great deal of pleasure in trying long
shots, many of which went in.
