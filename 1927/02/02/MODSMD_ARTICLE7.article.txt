# LOCAL BOY SCOUTS WILL SALVAGE JUNK FROM CAMPUS CURBS
## 
### 
Assisting a nation-wide organization |
that turns "junk into jobs and waste j
into wages" the Boy Scouts of Palo j
Alto will visit the campus this week- j
end to collect any waste material of
possible value which the living groups ;
and dormitories may leave on thej
curbs.
Goodwill Industries, the national or
ganization that is sponsoring this
drive, has recently taken over the
Community Shop of San Jose and the
salvage that the nineteen troops of
Boy Scouts will collect will be used
exclusively for San Jose Goodwill.
Taking care of thousands of unfor
tunate men and women who are made
self-supporting and self-respecting as
a result of such contributions, Good
will Industries has become a nation
ally-known philanthropic organization
doing much to eliminate the helpless
ness of society with regard to those
who are physically unfit to work.
