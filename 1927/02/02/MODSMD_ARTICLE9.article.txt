With Dave Fall, Olympic Games div
i ing star, undecided about entering the
diving events in the interclass swim
ming meet Friday, Ernst Brandsten
predicts a close finish for the fancy
contest between Ted Smith of the

Smith, senior, Fonde, sophomore, and

the front jack-knife, and back jack

Another close event will be the four
man relay. Each man swims 200 feet,
two lengths of the pool. The seniors
will have a fast four, consisting of
Christenson, Williams, Stevenson, and
O'Connor. Doped to finish just about
even with the seniors is the fresh
man team, which will be picked from
Harrison, Driggs, Hobdy, Peters, and
Kincaid. The juniors are planning to
give these two teams a close run, using
Danford, Van den Akker, Harris, and
C. Smith. The dark horse team will
be the sophomore four, which will he
chosen from Colo, Bramel, Thurlow,
Hunter, and Burns.
