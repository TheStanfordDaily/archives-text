Not all Boots that look like
Moccasins are
But those made by
IV. C. Russell are Real Moccasins
In a genuine Moccasin what is usually called the
"upper leather" is also the foundation for the sole.
Attached to this is the "slip sole" and the "outer
sole." The moccasin seam or vamp seam is hand
sewed with heavy wax ends or cords.
In making a boot after this fashion
the greatest flexibility is obtained
land because of the excellent quality
Moccasins will compare with any
15-inch height, in stock, in widths
to fit any one except the unusual.
