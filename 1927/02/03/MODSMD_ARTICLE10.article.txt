# MERGER PLAN APPROVED BY FRATERNITIES
## Five Students Selected to Serve as Members of Director's Board ADVANTAGES EXPLAINED Constitution Unconsidered By Three Fraternities Not at Meeting 
### 
House managers of twenty-one frater
nities signed the constitution of the "Co
operative Managers' Association" at the
meeting of managers held last night at
the Zeta Psi house and elected a board
of directors to meet on Wednesday, Feb
ruary 16, at the Delta Upsilon house to
determine the first steps in the co-opera
tive buying program.
The five student members of the board
of directors who were elected are Arthur
Greisser. James Habegger, Kenneth Gra
ham, Dave Graves, and Fred Kunzei.
One faculty member and one alumni
member of the board will be elected later.
The student members are elected for one
year, and the faculty and alumni mem
bers are to hold office for terms of two
years.
Crary Present
But three fraternities failed to adopt
the constitution, Alpha Delta Phi, Beta
Theta Pi, and Phi Delta Theta not being
represented at the meeting. Judge Crary,
'05, was present at the meeting and put
forth the advantages of the co-operative
system.
The plan as adopted in the constitution
is to start slowly and not to include too
much in co-operative purchasing at first.
It will be essentially an association of
managers, who will test the gains to be
achieved through the new system.
Sororities May Join
Posisbility of the sororities and other
organizations about the campus joining
the association if they so wish will be
considered later by the directors. The di
rectors may also elect a general manager
if they believe it desirable.
The concensus of opinion among the
house managers is that prospects for the
success of the association in operation are
very good, as similar organizations have
proven successful in practically every
institution where they have been adopted.
