# LEMOS WILL PUBLISH PORTFOLIO CONTAINING ORIENTAL ART DESIGNS
## 
### 
Pedro Lemos? director of the Stan
ford Museum, is now at work on an
Oriental Art portfolio to be published
as soon as completed by the Davis
Press of Massachusetts. This will be
the second of a series of three port
folios Mr. Lemos is getting out for the
use of Art teachers in the schools. The
first set was a collection of American
Indian designs; the last will be taken
from examples of Old World art,
Celtic, Byzantine, Roman, Greek, and
Assyrian. The sale price of these
portfolios is $1.50 per set. Not only
teachers, but designers of rugs, batik
work, wood block printing, and crafts
men will find them valuable as re
ferences.
Twenty-Six Plates
The Oriental portfolio contains in
all twenty-six plates. The Tkeda Japa
nese art collection, which was pur
chased for the museum by Mrs. Stan
ford when it was on the way to be
sold in the East, is the source for the
designs. The motifs are copied from
such things as the border of a Java
nese batik or the pattern of some
specimen of East Indian metal work.
They include Japanese, Chinese, New
Guinean, Bornean, Hawaiian, Persian,
East Indian, and Javanese symbols.
Among the symbols found in the col
lection are the Ho Bird, an Oriental
| mythological bird that deseends to
j earth at the birth of an emperor or a
! genius, the Crane and the Pine which
'stand for longing, the Pearl for roy
alty, and the Lotus for wisdom. Japa
nese dragons and >utterflies also fig
ure in the cuts.
Many designs for the American In
dian issue were obtained from Jewelry
loaned to Mr. Lemos by James Swin
nerton of Palo Alto.
