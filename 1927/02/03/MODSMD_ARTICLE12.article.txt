# "ROUGHS" WARNED OF CONDUCT AT DANCES BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## Body Threatens to Abolish "Roughing" Tradition On Campus 
### 
Abolishment of the Stanford tradi
tion of "roughing" dunces will be un
dertaken by the Men's Council, if con
duct of "roughs" at dances does not
improve, it was decided at a meeting
of that body held yesterday afternoon.
A resolution to that effect was passed
after a complaint had been made that
"roughs" at -a recent sorority dunce
had stolen the ice cream, and cut the
lights on the porch and in th'e garage.
The Men's Council declared itself ab
solutely against such action.
A certain student was dismissed
from the University for three quarters
for copying an article from a news
paper and handing it in as an original
theme. It was pointed out that the
Honor Pledge, signed on Registration
Day, not only included cheating in
examinations, but also in reports,
notes, and experiments.
The letter from President Wilbur
suggesting changes in the next year's
Big Game Rally and Bonfire was read,
but no action was taken thereon.
