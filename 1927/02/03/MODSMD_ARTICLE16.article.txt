# PHI DELT SICK LIST NUMBERS SEVEN AS SINUS, FLU OCCUR
## 
### 
Sinus infection and influenza
have taken a big toll at the Phi
Delta Theta house this week,
seven of the members having
been removed for an indefinite
stay at various hospitals because
of those ailments. Robert Stein,
Robert Frazee, Henry Clock, Al
fred Combs, James Reynolds, Al
fred Purkiss, and Elmer Riese
are all on the sick list.
Clock will probably be out of
the University for the rest of the
quarter. He is taking treatment
in a Long Beach Sanitarium.
The Phi Delt intramural bas
ketball quintet felt the effects of
the epidemic to such an extent
that it was forced to default to
the Chi Psi outfit in the first of
yesterday's games. This will prob
ably put the team definitely out
of the running.
