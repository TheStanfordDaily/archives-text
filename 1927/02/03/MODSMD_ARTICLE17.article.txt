Sigma Alpha Epsilon and the Japa
nese acquired victories yesterday in
intramural basketball by the slim mar
gin of two points. These were the only
close games, for with but one excep
tion, all the others were won by at
least nine points. S.A.E. won the
closest game of the evening by sink
ing a field goal in an extra period of
play. <»
Showing a great improvement over
past performances, the Japanese Club
scored its first victory yesterday by
defeating the Cardinals 12 to 10. Endo, ■
lanky oriental center, was the whole
show for the winners.
On the whole, the game was slow
and rather uninteresting, the Cardi- !
nals showing only a small amount of
teamwork. Adams was their best bet. j
He sank three field goals.
Sigma Chi Wins
Sigma Chi's undefeated hoop team ;
mounted another step toward the
championship of League V, yesterday,
by decisively trouncing Encina 3E's
outfit 38 to 1(3 in the first of the after
noon's battles. The fraternity team
was clearly the superior organization,
gaining a big lead early in the contest
and holding it easily. Bowers, Sigma
Chi center, played excellent ball and
proved himself to be one of the very
best of this year's intramural court
men. Long and Nye were the out-
standing Encina players.
Playing a listless game that only at j
very infrequent intervals showed
streaks of action, the Indians tri
umphed over the Dekes 14 to 5. The ;
score was tied at 4 to 4 at the half,
but the fraternity men could only
make one more tally during the last
period. P. McCray played a hard game
at center, as did Robb at guard and
Smythe at forward. For the Indians,
Schwarz and Tully showed flashes of
excellent floorwork, while McClure, i
center, and Telonicher, guard, devel
oped a clever style of play. Montferino !
was high-point man in the game, bring- j
ing in four field goals.
S.A.E. Game Fast.
The fastest game played was that
between Encina 4W and S.A.E., end
ing at the half with the freshmen
ahead 6 to 7. Bill Clark played a fine
game, running himself all over the
court, and being the chief cog in each
play. lie showed an excellent defense
game, and with the center, Pease,
kept the fraternity score down for a
long time. With 20 seconds to go and
the yearlings leading 12 to 10, Ander- !
son dropped in a long shot to tie the j
score. In the extra period that was
played, Gibbons, who had been star- ■
ring for the S.A.E. quintet throughout
the evening, sank a field goal early in i
the period. The fast fight that followed
did not include any scoring, with the
fraternity winning 14 to 12.
The last game was a walk-away for

A.K.L.. who downed El Cuadro 19 to 6.
Gaudy and Eraser developed a fast
offense for the clubmen, bu* could not
m ike their shots good. Barnett and
Kellogg played the entire game, giving
good account for themselves, the for
mer being high-point man. Walker
showed up well at center, as did Stol
lery at guard.
The enforced sojourn of most of
the Phi Delt basketball live in the
University infirmary caused that team
to default its game with Chi Psi's.
