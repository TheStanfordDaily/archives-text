Sigma Alpha Epsilon and the Japa
nese acquired victories yesterday in
intramural basketball by the slim mar

close games, for with but one excep

closest game of the evening by sink

Showing a great improvement over
past performances, the Japanese Club
scored its first victory yesterday by
defeating the Cardinals 12 to 10. Endo, ■

On the whole, the game was slow

nals showing only a small amount of
teamwork. Adams was their best bet. j
He sank three field goals.
