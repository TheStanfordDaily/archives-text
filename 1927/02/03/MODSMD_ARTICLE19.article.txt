# NEVERS PLAYS IN SCRIMMAGE WITH VARSITY
## Three Former- First-String Players Give Cardinal Five Workout LITTLE IMPROVEMENT Hunt Will Start Different Forwards Against U.S.C. Friday, Saturday 
### Fred Speers 
Twenty or so spectators watched
the varsity go through its practice
last night in the pavilion—and twenty
or so spectators were not visibly im
pressed. However the small crowd got
one thrill at least, that of seeing
Ernie Nevers in action against Stan
ford's varsity.
Following the same preparatory
schedule of scrimmage games for con
ditioning the varsity for the coming
week-end titles with Southern Cali
fornia, Coach Husky Hunt last night
sent his men against the hardest play
ing practice team they have yet met.
Despite the fact that the practice
squad was but a pickup one, macTe
from three former Cardinal basketball
players and two second-string men.
Hunt's men had a hard nut to crack.
Crowd Gets Thrill
Playing in the scrimmage team be
sides Nevers were Muggs Mitchell,
Harry Shipkey, Sexson, and Crarv.
The small crowd came to see Nevers
and it was from his playing that the
crowd got its thrill. The former Cardi
nal forward displayed unusual prowess
at long shots at the basket and in
dribbling. He was the main cog in the
pickup team, his teammates being con
tent to feed the ball to him.
But the Stanford varsity looked rag
ged and weak on short passes. Bryant
and Jayred, rushed by Shipkey and
Nevers, found it hard to locate the
basket on short shots. Christ, playing
at forward opposite Bryant, played a
cool, clever floor game but he, too,
couldn't make his shots at the basket
register.
