# THREE MAJOR TEAMS WILL MEET STANFORD FENCERS THIS SEASON
## 
### 
Cardinal swordsmen will enter three
major meets this season, including one
with the University of California, ac
cording to the schedule announced re
cently by the San Francisco Bay division
of the American Amateur Fencing
League. The Stanford men will also
fight in several informal affairs spon
sored by that organization.
The California-Stanford clash will
take place on March 5, the Bay division
meet on March 25, and the Pacific Coast
Fencing Tournament, April 2 and 3.
Entry in the latter of these depends on
the showing made in the Bay division
battle. Those winning the first three
places in team and individual competi
tion in the novice and junior classes will
be allowed to take part in the Pacific
Coast Tournament.
