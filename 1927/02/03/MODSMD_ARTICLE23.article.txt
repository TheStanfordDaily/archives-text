# Too Many Forfeits

With three halls, three fraternities, and one eating club forfeiting
Intramural tennis and basketball games during the last week, it appears
that with more stringent scholastic and entrance requirements Stanford
men are finding their time limited and Intramural athletics is suffering
neglect.
C. W. Davis, director of Intramural Sports, has been responsible for
the great development of the living group competition which enables all
students to participate in athletics instead of allowing only a selected few
to enjoy the benefits of "playing the game." If the incentive for individual
development is not sufficient to make houses, clubs, and halls finish their
schedule, then the good name of the organizations defaulting should be
zealously guarded.
The governing ideal in Stanford athletics which has been so well stated
by President Wilbur is as follows: "One of our ideals at Stanford is to
have every man in the University get the thrill of athletic competition as
well as the benefits that come from training of the body It is im
possible to devise extra-mural events of such a character as to give all of
our students an equal opportunity in competition. There is plenty of
sport and fun in contesting with our neighbors. The Stanford campus
is so organized that the development of intramural athletics is an integral
part of the whole scheme out of which also comes intercollegiate sport."
