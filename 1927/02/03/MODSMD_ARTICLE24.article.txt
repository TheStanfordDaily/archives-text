Along with sophomore control, Rough's Day celebration, Ram s Head
burlesques, class battles, water fights, and.other non-existant Stanford
traditions, the official abolition of "roughing dances looms unless the
attitude of the rough changes. Friday night's depredations on one of the
sorority houses in which the ice cream supply was stolen, and the electric
wires on the porch and garage cut, has forced the Men s Council to
announce that any recurrence of such actions may put the dance roughs
ii the Museum as interesting relics.
Stanford roughs, who arc supposedly to act like gentlemen regardless
of dress and outward appearance, are now placed on probation, and any
deviation from the straight and narrow path of respectability will seal
their doom as part of the local color. Campus dances can successfully be
held without a fringe of hardy looking men parked in windows, doors,
and hallways even though "imports" may miss their friendly interest.
Another small band of similar marauders roughing a campus dance
will sound the death knell of one of the few characteristic Stanford
traditions.
