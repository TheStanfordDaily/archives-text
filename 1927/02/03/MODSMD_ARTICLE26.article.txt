In aligning with President Wilbur
yesterday in opposition to the bonfire
rally, we regret that an impression
was created in certain quarters that
we implied wholesale approval of the
president's recent message. The truth
of the matter is that we feel that the
president hopelessly confused three
issues with the result that it is hard
to make a clear distinction between
them. Furthermore, The Bull Session
would hardly care to be quoted as
favoring some of the president's state
ments.
* * *
For charges that were made purely
on hearsay, the president's allegations
of drunkenness were quite specific—
too specific in fact. Besides this, to
those who were closely associated with

the bonfire, the specific implications
appeared inaccurate. They were di
rected at parties not responsible to
the extent that those charges would
imply.
* * *
The foregoing statements are made
simply by way of clearing up our
stand, and are admittedly somewhat
beside the point. We still feel that the
bonfire is a useless institution. In the
old days, the Big Game Rally, as an
all-Stanford bender, was without a
peer in the University calendar. As a
psychological assistant to the coaching
staff it was never any good. And even
as a "brannigan par excellence" it
never quite justified the amount of
labor it necessitated. Let it die a na
tural death. •—Stephen O'Donnell.
