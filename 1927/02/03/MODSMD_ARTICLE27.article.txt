The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps brains and beauty do not
mix, and doubtlessly the "500" got a
large helping when brains were passed
around. But, if no one else wants the
co-eds, I'll take 'em.
Girls will be boys these days, so
Stanford young ladies have decided
they will smoke in their campus
homes, but some will not do so when
gentlemen a:<• present. Smoking is
largely an individual matter, and
physicians are best able to decide
whether and to what extent smoking
is injurious. I am glad it has been
made an individual matter here, but,
if women are going to smoke, they
had far better do so openly, at least
so far as men are concerned. Men
visirinp sororities and Roble had much
rather a woman smoking openly
than to suspect that she does in pri
vate —on the sly as it were. This
brings back memories of the old gang
that used to smoke "in private" back
of the old country sc-hoolhouse wood
shed in grammar school days. A man
thinks more of a woman who is open
and above-board. ■—L.B.
The Editor, Sir:
Oh, Bull Session, you gripe me! Till
further notice I transfer my affections
to Cabbages. I have read with some

j surprise of the drunken orgy that at
tended the building of the Bruin funer
al pyre. I knew that some liquor was
used, but not prevalently as has been
stated. It may astonish the listening
world, but during the night that I kept
vigil there was not a drop of liquor
exposed to the air—my nose is not of
the dullest, nor my eyes and ears ab
i solutely useless.
But at the rally—ah! That IS differ
ent. Who did not see two prominent
upperc-lassmen, in particular, so glori
ously and happily drunk that everyone
was commenting upon it? Really some
of the class of '30 are not drunkards,
Mr. Northrup to the contrary. Terhaps
during the last two nights of guarding
i there was a bacchanalian orgy, but
the night or two preceding those were
as soberly attended as any W.C.T.U.
meeting.
Let us keep the bonfire—but with
| reservations. Is each class to tear up
I property in the mad endeavor to sur
■ pass the efforts of previous years? Set
; a standard size, and reduce the hours
'spent upon it; cut out the drinking,
and we will bring our buns and
weiners, and enjoy it. all. If one is
j hunting for liquor, I invite him to
j Encina —or Toyon—or Branner. Al
| though only a few bottles may be
I found, a very little dynamite goes a
| long way! —Utopia, '30.
