# "PRINCESS IDA" TO BE FIRST OPERA STAGED ON CAMPUS IN YEARS
## Change of Ram's Head Show To Autumn Opens Date For Production 
### 
Gilbert and Sullivan's colorful light
opera, "Princess Ida," will be pre
sented at the Assembly Hall on the
night of February 25 by a special cast
of University people under the joint
direction of Warren D. Allen, director
of the Stanford Glee Club and Univer
sity organist, and Gordon Davis, di
rector of dramatics.
The opera will be the first of its
type to be given on the campus for
some years. During the past few sea
sons in place of standard light operas,
which were formerly produced, the
Ham's Head Burlesque has been given
instead. The decision of Ram's Head
to take charge of the Football Show
in the autumn quarter instead of giv
ing a performance of its own opens
the date for the presentation of "Prin
cess Ida."
Graduate Has Lead
The lead in the opera will be taken
by Miss Winfred Estabrook, recently
graduated from Stanford, who is (Kit
present engaged in teaching music in
San Jose. Miss Estabrook has a voice
which eminently suits her for the por
trayal of this part.
Elizabeth Wilbur, who will be re
membered for her appearance opposite
Gordon Davis in "Hay Fever," takes
the part of Lady Blanche in the opera.
Ruth Klette appears as Lady Psyche,
Julia North as Melissa, and Carol
Lasater as Sacharissa. All have been
in campus plays previously.
Pyrne Plays King
King Hildebrand will be played by
Carleton Byrne, while Bailey H. New
lee will appear as Hilarion, his son.
Charles Moore and Albert Brouse will
play the parts of Cyril and Florian,
friends ot Hilarion, while Adelbert
Cullin, Arthur Holmes, and Earl Reed
will appear as sons of King Gama,
King Hildebrand's greatest rival. King
Gama will be played by Alonzo Cass,
who has appeared many times before
in campus musical shows, some of his
notable successes being in the "Rover
Boys" and in the 1927 Junior Opera.
"Princess Ida" requires an apprecia
tion of the fact that it is a satire on
Tennyson's famous poem, "The Prin
cess." as well as a certain appreciation
of subtlety of characterization and ex
cellence of musical writing.
Warren D. Allen, however, believes
that, the piece will be of particular
interest to a campus audience for
these reasons in addition to the rea
son that the play itself has to do with
Princess Ida's attempt to establish a
university of her, own.

of University people under the joint
direction of Warren D. Allen, director
of the Stanford Glee Club and Univer
sity organist, and Gordon Davis, di
rector of dramatics.
The opera will be the first of its
type to be given on the campus for
some years. During the past few sea
sons in place of standard light operas,
which were formerly produced, the
Ham's Head Burlesque has been given
instead. The decision of Ram's Head
to take charge of the Football Show
in the autumn quarter instead of giv
ing a performance of its own opens
the date for the presentation of "Prin
cess Ida."
Graduate Has Lead
The lead in the opera will be taken
by Miss Winfred Estabrook, recently
graduated from Stanford, who is (Kit
present engaged in teaching music in
San Jose. Miss Estabrook has a voice
which eminently suits her for the por
trayal of this part.
Elizabeth Wilbur, who will be re
membered for her appearance opposite
Gordon Davis in "Hay Fever," takes
the part of Lady Blanche in the opera.
Ruth Klette appears as Lady Psyche,
Julia North as Melissa, and Carol
Lasater as Sacharissa. All have been
in campus plays previously.
Pyrne Plays King
King Hildebrand will be played by
Carleton Byrne, while Bailey H. New
lee will appear as Hilarion, his son.
Charles Moore and Albert Brouse will
play the parts of Cyril and Florian,
friends ot Hilarion, while Adelbert
Cullin, Arthur Holmes, and Earl Reed
will appear as sons of King Gama,
King Hildebrand's greatest rival. King
Gama will be played by Alonzo Cass,
who has appeared many times before
in campus musical shows, some of his
notable successes being in the "Rover
Boys" and in the 1927 Junior Opera.
"Princess Ida" requires an apprecia
tion of the fact that it is a satire on
Tennyson's famous poem, "The Prin
cess." as well as a certain appreciation
of subtlety of characterization and ex
cellence of musical writing.
Warren D. Allen, however, believes
that, the piece will be of particular
interest to a campus audience for
these reasons in addition to the rea
son that the play itself has to do with
Princess Ida's attempt to establish a
university of her, own.
Gilbert and Sullivan's colorful light
opera, "Princess Ida," will be pre
sented at the Assembly Hall on the
night of February 25 by a special cast
of University people under the joint
direction of Warren D. Allen, director
of the Stanford Glee Club and Univer
sity organist, and Gordon Davis, di
rector of dramatics.
