Hungarian Student Movement, sow doing it search work at Stanford)

Hungary history is as colorful as
any history in the world. It is full of
battles, strife and victories, and
victories and periods of tremendous
suffering. She is on the border line
of western and eastern civilization.
Her position is "Gateway to the East."
Bolshevism feroke its teeth in Hun
gary. It's the third time Hungary has
saved western civilization.
Her life in general is mixed with
eastern characteristics and modern in
fluences. The background of it all is
Hospitality. Her educational systems,
her schools rank as of the best in
Europe. They are all very religious.
Her medical and music schools should
be of especial interest for American
students.
Her student movement goes as far
back as the age of reformation, how
ever from a political standpoint it
shows itself in the year 1825 —of the
Great Szechenyi, the Benjamin Frank
lin of Hungary. Her students are
chiefly composed from the historic
middle-class —not the money-class and
the farmer-class. Her student move
ment is profoundly religious and na
tional. The universities have an inde
pendent study plan, honorary work
system. They are no boarding univer
sities, students living in hostels with
a marked discipline developed in them.
After 10 o'clock no noise is allowed

under penalty of a heavy fine. Hun
gary is one of the most active mem
bers of the international student move
ment of Europe, and one of the pro
moters of international fellowship
work. Ker student leaders are looked
upon as future leaders of Hungary,
and with the national union of stu
dents of England, our best friend in
Europe, provides a wide field for train
ing in statesmanship and foreign-ser
vice work.
Her exchange movement is very
much developed. Yearly over 500 for
eign students come to Hungary. Last
year Hungary alone had 600 American
students. The exchange movement be
tween American Hungarian stu
dents is sponsored by Professor Doug
gan of New York and Professor dr. P.
Teleki of Budapest. Any inquiries will
be gladly met by the writer.
If you come to Hungary, you will
find it a very individualistic country,
so colorful of historic traditions, a
country known for its love of music
and arts, known for her scenic beauty,
and as above mentioned, her hospi
tality and social life, and gypsy music.
Hungary needs lots of friends, and
all those who get the right interpreta
tion of magvarism and reception
whilst they are there, cannot leave
the country but as friends of a 1000-
year-old little nation.
