News has just been received from ;
Paris that Francis Molnar, author of
several plays, including "The Swan,"
Masquers' dramatic offering to be pro
duced February 11, was given a ban
quet before the premier of "The Swan"
by the International Committee for
Intellectual Co-operation. The recep
tion was given in the Hotel Royale. !
and was attended by many famous J
Parisian artists, critics, and writers. I
Ernest Luchair, director of the com
mittee, said in his speech that "this |
is the first case that this international
institute, which is the creation of the !
League of Nations, greets an Hungar-!
ian author. This honor is not only con-1
ferred upon Hungary, but upon France
also."
The production of this play by Uni-!
versity students is of particular in
terest, both for the versatility of the ;
parts and the recently acclaimed per-!
formances in the East. It deals with j
love, business, and deposed royalty, j
and is written with all of Molnar's
subtlety and humor.
