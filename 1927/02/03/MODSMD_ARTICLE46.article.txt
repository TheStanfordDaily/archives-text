# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The "Millrose COO" is the piece de
resistance of the great indoor athletic
carnival held annually by the Millrose
Athletic Association of New York.
The prize for this event is the Percy
D. Haughton trophy, which was pre
sented last year by a Harvard gradu
ate. It was designed by a famous
sculptor, and is worth §(500 —in other
words, a dollar a yard.
Back in 1923, a young man named
Alan Boone Helffrich, of Penn State
College, won the Millrose 600, defeat
ing the famous Earl Eby, had
previously won the trophy Alau
Helffrich evidently pnjoyed the sensa
tion of his first "Millrose 600" victory,
for he repeated in 1924, 1925. and 1926,
and tonight will attempt to stretch his
string of triumphs to five in a row.
The times turned in by this black
haired streak from Penn State were
nothing short of remarkable too, as
liis average for the four years has been
1:13 2-sths, which equals the former
world's record established, I believe,
by Dave Caldwell, which stood until
1922. Helffrich is the holder of the
present world's indoor record of 1:11
C-sths for 600' yards, made in 1925.
In a conversation with Alan the
other day, he gave great credit to his
former coach, Nate Cartmell, who puts

the boys through their paces on the
track and field at Penn State College.
Nate's record as a sprinter in the
j IC4A meets has never been equaled.
I After winning second place in the 100-
i and 200-yard dashes in his freshman
; year, he proceeded to win both sprints
i in his sophomore, junior, and senior
I years! / Following some sensational
| professional running, he coached at
; Lafayette. North Carolina, and West
: Virginia, and then went to Penn State
! in January, 1923.
j "As for his coaching ability," says
! Alan, who ought to know,"he is one
of the best in the country, and there
is no coach who takes as much interest
in the individual boy as Nate Cartmell
i does. That is not the easiest way to
j coach, either, but it does the most
1 good."
As Alan graduated from State Col
lege in 1925, he had three years of
Nate's coaching, and the results speak
for themselves. National and inter
collegiate titles have been won by
Heffrich, and he has scored half-mile
victories over two of Europe's most
famous runners, Paavo Nurmi and
Dougles Lowe. Later I will tell about
I Alan's hardest race, as well as about
the time he won a half-mile race in
1:57 l-sth, after running nearly two
| hundred yards with only one shoe on!

As Alan graduated from State Col
lege in 1925, he had three years of
Nate's coaching, and the results speak
for themselves. National and inter
collegiate titles have been won by
Heffrich, and he has scored half-mile
victories over two of Europe's most
famous runners, Paavo Nurmi and
Dougles Lowe. Later I will tell about
I Alan's hardest race, as well as about
the time he won a half-mile race in
1:57 l-sth, after running nearly two

The "Millrose COO" is the piece de
resistance of the great indoor athletic
carnival held annually by the Millrose
Athletic Association of New York.
The prize for this event is the Percy
D. Haughton trophy, which was pre
sented last year by a Harvard gradu
ate. It was designed by a famous
sculptor, and is worth §(500 —in other
words, a dollar a yard.
Back in 1923, a young man named
Alan Boone Helffrich, of Penn State
College, won the Millrose 600, defeat
ing the famous Earl Eby, had
previously won the trophy Alau
Helffrich evidently pnjoyed the sensa
tion of his first "Millrose 600" victory,
for he repeated in 1924, 1925. and 1926,
and tonight will attempt to stretch his
string of triumphs to five in a row.
The times turned in by this black
haired streak from Penn State were
nothing short of remarkable too, as
liis average for the four years has been
1:13 2-sths, which equals the former
world's record established, I believe,
by Dave Caldwell, which stood until
1922. Helffrich is the holder of the
present world's indoor record of 1:11
C-sths for 600' yards, made in 1925.
In a conversation with Alan the
other day, he gave great credit to his
former coach, Nate Cartmell, who puts

the boys through their paces on the
track and field at Penn State College.
Nate's record as a sprinter in the
j IC4A meets has never been equaled.
I After winning second place in the 100-
i and 200-yard dashes in his freshman
; year, he proceeded to win both sprints
i in his sophomore, junior, and senior
I years! / Following some sensational
| professional running, he coached at
; Lafayette. North Carolina, and West
: Virginia, and then went to Penn State
