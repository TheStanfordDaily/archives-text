# FRESHMEN END WEEK OF STIFF WORKOUTS FOR SALINAS GAME
## Santa Barbara Basketball Five to Play Yearlings Saturday Night 
### 
When the babe basketball team
steps onto the floor tomorrow night
to do battle against the Salinas High
School squad, it will have been through
a week of the hardest practice it has
seen since the opening of the season.
Besides the game against the Sa
linas five, the freshmen play the
Santa Barbara State Teachers team
Saturday night. As the Cardinal
coaches expect the Stanford-Teachers
game to be a difficult one to win, it
may partly explain the emphasis being
stressed on work-outs the last week.
It is also probable that Coach Hunt
has attention focused on the game
next week, when his beginners play
the California freshmen, and is start
ing early to prepare them for the
Berkeley yearlings.
Stiff Scrimmage
As there was no game in the middle
of the week, Coaches Hunt and
Mitchell have been putting the first
year men through a program of stiff
scrimmage. This has been intermin
gled with basket-shooting.
Yesterday afternoon, practice con
sisted of the usual scrimmage and an
equal amount of practice in basket
throwing. On the follow-up shots,
Story showed good form by sinking
all of fifteen tries. Steinbeck and Hare
were also going well. The other mem
bers of the squad were rather erratic.
Old Lineup Used
In the scrimmage, the same line-up
that was used at the first of the sea
son was again tried out. Stewart and
Berg, forwards, Bush, center, and
Simpkins and Albertson, guards, ap
peared to be a good aggregation. It is
a toss-up between Anderson and Stein
beck as to which one will be used in
the place of Thompson, guard, in case
he has not returned from the South
in time for the game tomorrow night.
