# DIVING HEATS ADDED TO OPENING TRIALS OF INTERCLASS MEETS
## Swan, Back, and Jack Dives Added to List of Events Scheduled for Today 
### 
Preliminary dives have been added
to the trial heats of the interclass
swimming meet scheduled for this
afternoon, announces Ernst Brandsten,
Stanford swimming coach. Preliminary
trials in the four compulsory dives,
namely, the swan, back, front jack,
and back jack, will be held today,
while the four optional dives will be
made by contestants in the regular
meet tomorrow.
50-Heat Today
Heats in the 50 will start at 4:30
o'clock this afternoon and will be fol
lowed by the breast stroke race and
the 100'. The diving will be the last
event of the day. In the preliminary
events, two will qualify in the fastest
heat. No elimination will take place
in the preliminary diving, which is
predicted to be one of the closest
events of the meet.
Because of the unusual interest
shown in the interclass this year,
Brandsten has announced that both
the preliminary and final contests will
be free to the public. The meet will
be one of the closest held for some
time, with the winner doped to be
either the freshmen or the seniors.
Every class has at least one entry in
every event, while several of the
events are so crowded that prelimi
nary heats were found necessary.
James Sparling, former varsity swim
ming star and now coach at Palo Alto
high school, will officiate as starter
of the races, and Professors Booster,
Leslie, and Stuart will act as the
judges.
