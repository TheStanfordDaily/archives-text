# RELIGION NEVER DIES ASSERTS DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
"Religions die, but religion never
dies. God requires no church pass
port," declared Dr. Jordan in last
night's open forum. "There is a vital
difference between the passing types
of religious expression, and the under
lying spirit prompting this expres
sion."
"It is vulgar for girls to smoke,"
was the reply to a question regarding
the recent amendment to the A.W.S.
constitution. "It is vulgar for men, too,
as well, but one expects vulgarity
from men. Those women who smoke I
cross off my calling list." In a further
discussion of the use of tobacco, Dr.
Jordan declared himself as disagree
ing with Henry Ford's contention that
tobacco is more harmful than alcohol.
When asked to give his personal ex
periences on the matter he replied,
"I smoked only once, when a senior
at Cornell, as part of our graduating
program I smoked a peace-pipe."
Why Go to College?
"Why did you go to college?" was
one of the questions put to the speak
er, and it received the reply, "Every
man must he his own companion, and
the well-educated man is the best com
pany for himself. I selected Cornell
because there I was able to get the
practical courses I wanted. Greek and
Latin were too much stressed other
places. Although I believe these lan
guages are good for those whose
minds are disposed towards them."
