By Edwin Randol
Three unique basketball games were
played in the intramural series yesterday,
El Tigre, Encina Basement, and Juni
pero Serra winning out in the day's play.
While the afternoon games were close
tussles, the only game of the evening
was a walkaway for the Junipero Serra
quintet. Neither the Kappa Alpha or
Phi Kappa Sigma teams showed up for
their scheduled game in the evening.
Encina Games Rough
In the first game of the afternoon,
Encina 2VV and Encina Basement paid
more attention to slugging, pushing, and
tripping each other than shooting goals,
and as a result the game resolved itself
into the roughest battle seen in the intra
mural series this season. Although the
referee was exceptionally lenient, fifteen
fouls were called, ten of which were on
the winners.
The first period ended with the score
standing 4 to 2 in favor of the basement
five, Stewart making two nice field goals
and Fishbcck and Allcndorf contribut
ing with a foul shot apiece. At the start
of the last period Stewart again got un
der way, and soon put the game on ice
i for the victors. The 2\V team attempted
j a rally but fell short by three joints,
| and the same ended the basement'
team being declared better in sooring,
playing and fouliwg.
Ten Baskets Made
El Tigre and Sigma Nu took turns in
scoring in the last afternoon contest, the
Row men being held scoreless in the first
half, and F.l Tigre being unable to score
in the second period. Following out the
spirit of the afternoon, the tussle was
nearly as rough as that preceding it,
titne-out being called several times while
men recovered their wind or rested from
the effects of body blows.
For seven minutes after the start of
: the game, El Tigre failed to tally, but
Henderson finally made a long shot ;tnd
drew lirst blood. Soon afterwards Mitch
ell shot a field goal and two foul shots,
ending the scoring for the half. Another
seven minutes after the start of the
second period were spent before Don
Marquis broke through for the lirst Sig
ma Nu score.
Ri<ii7<>l flip next and last shot
from the side of the court, and although
both squads fought like demons, no fur
ther scoring was made and the game
ended at 6 to 4. Prizinzano, El Tigre
guard, played the best game for his team,
being the main factor in keeping down
the Sigma Nu score. Mitchell also played
well, as did Marquis and Renzel.
In marked contrast with the afternoon
games, Junipcro Serra had an easy time
with the Theta Xi team, taking the game
by a score of 24 to 11. Casad, dimuntive
Theta Xi forward, played an excellent
and hard fought game, but with lack of
support from his teammates, his efforts
were futile.
Juniero Serra Scores Eaisly
Harold and Guthrie took care of the
Junipero Serra scoring in the first half,
running up ten points while the frater
half Casad led a determined rally but

the steady scoring of the winning club
proved discouraging and could not Ik*
overcome, ilarold continued his tine
shooting, ending the day with ten points
to his credit. Harlow also played stead
ily for the clubmen.
As neither Kappa Alpha or Phi Kappa
Sigma appeared for their game a ruling
will be made by C. W. Davis, who is in
charge of the series. The unplayed con
test will probably l>e run off next week,
as its outcome may decide the leadership
in League VII.
Today's gapies are as follows:
4:ls—Phi Gamma Delta vs Encina 4E.
4:so—Kappa Sigma vs. Theta Delta

Kappa Alpha-Phi Kappa Sigma
—no game/
By Edwin Randol
Three unique basketball games were
played in the intramural series yesterday,
El Tigre, Encina Basement, and Juni
pero Serra winning out in the day's play.
While the afternoon games were close
tussles, the only game of the evening
was a walkaway for the Junipero Serra
quintet. Neither the Kappa Alpha or
Phi Kappa Sigma teams showed up for
their scheduled game in the evening.
Encina Games Rough
In the first game of the afternoon,
Encina 2VV and Encina Basement paid
more attention to slugging, pushing, and
tripping each other than shooting goals,
and as a result the game resolved itself
into the roughest battle seen in the intra
mural series this season. Although the
referee was exceptionally lenient, fifteen
fouls were called, ten of which were on
the winners.
The first period ended with the score
standing 4 to 2 in favor of the basement
five, Stewart making two nice field goals
and Fishbcck and Allcndorf contribut
ing with a foul shot apiece. At the start
of the last period Stewart again got un
der way, and soon put the game on ice
i for the victors. The 2\V team attempted
j a rally but fell short by three joints,
| and the same ended the basement'
team being declared better in sooring,
playing and fouliwg.
Ten Baskets Made
El Tigre and Sigma Nu took turns in
scoring in the last afternoon contest, the
Row men being held scoreless in the first
half, and F.l Tigre being unable to score
in the second period. Following out the
spirit of the afternoon, the tussle was
nearly as rough as that preceding it,
titne-out being called several times while
men recovered their wind or rested from
the effects of body blows.
For seven minutes after the start of
: the game, El Tigre failed to tally, but
Henderson finally made a long shot ;tnd
drew lirst blood. Soon afterwards Mitch
ell shot a field goal and two foul shots,
ending the scoring for the half. Another
seven minutes after the start of the
second period were spent before Don
Marquis broke through for the lirst Sig
ma Nu score.
Ri<ii7<>l flip next and last shot
from the side of the court, and although
both squads fought like demons, no fur
ther scoring was made and the game
ended at 6 to 4. Prizinzano, El Tigre
guard, played the best game for his team,
being the main factor in keeping down
the Sigma Nu score. Mitchell also played
well, as did Marquis and Renzel.
In marked contrast with the afternoon
games, Junipcro Serra had an easy time
with the Theta Xi team, taking the game
by a score of 24 to 11. Casad, dimuntive
Theta Xi forward, played an excellent
and hard fought game, but with lack of
support from his teammates, his efforts
were futile.
Juniero Serra Scores Eaisly
Harold and Guthrie took care of the
Junipero Serra scoring in the first half,
running up ten points while the frater
half Casad led a determined rally but

the steady scoring of the winning club
proved discouraging and could not Ik*
overcome, ilarold continued his tine
shooting, ending the day with ten points
to his credit. Harlow also played stead
ily for the clubmen.
As neither Kappa Alpha or Phi Kappa
Sigma appeared for their game a ruling
will be made by C. W. Davis, who is in
charge of the series. The unplayed con
test will probably l>e run off next week,
as its outcome may decide the leadership
in League VII.
Today's gapies are as follows:
4:ls—Phi Gamma Delta vs Encina 4E.
4:so—Kappa Sigma vs. Theta Delta
Chi.
El Tigre 6, Sigma Nu 4.
Encina Basement 12, Encina
