By Edwin Randol
Three unique basketball games were
played in the intramural series yesterday,
El Tigre, Encina Basement, and Juni
pero Serra winning out in the day's play.
While the afternoon games were close
tussles, the only game of the evening
was a walkaway for the Junipero Serra
quintet. Neither the Kappa Alpha or
Phi Kappa Sigma teams showed up for
their scheduled game in the evening.
Encina Games Rough
In the first game of the afternoon,
Encina 2VV and Encina Basement paid
more attention to slugging, pushing, and
tripping each other than shooting goals,
and as a result the game resolved itself
into the roughest battle seen in the intra
mural series this season. Although the
referee was exceptionally lenient, fifteen
fouls were called, ten of which were on
the winners.
The first period ended with the score
standing 4 to 2 in favor of the basement
five, Stewart making two nice field goals
and Fishbcck and Allcndorf contribut
ing with a foul shot apiece. At the start
of the last period Stewart again got un
der way, and soon put the game on ice
i for the victors. The 2\V team attempted
j a rally but fell short by three joints,
| and the same ended the basement'
team being declared better in sooring,
playing and fouliwg.
Ten Baskets Made
El Tigre and Sigma Nu took turns in
scoring in the last afternoon contest, the
Row men being held scoreless in the first
half, and F.l Tigre being unable to score
in the second period. Following out the
spirit of the afternoon, the tussle was
nearly as rough as that preceding it,
titne-out being called several times while
men recovered their wind or rested from
the effects of body blows.
For seven minutes after the start of
: the game, El Tigre failed to tally, but
Henderson finally made a long shot ;tnd
drew lirst blood. Soon afterwards Mitch
ell shot a field goal and two foul shots,
ending the scoring for the half. Another
seven minutes after the start of the
second period were spent before Don
Marquis broke through for the lirst Sig
ma Nu score.
