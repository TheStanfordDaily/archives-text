# TWO 'Y'S' COMBINE IN THIRD SOCIETY FOR FELLOWSHIP
## NEW PLAN TENTATIVE Christian Organizations to Continue Functions as Separate Units 
### 
Creating a third organization com
posed of both men and women, the Y.W.
C.A. and the Y.M.C.A. Cabinets will join
in a society to be called the Stanford
Fellowship. This group will be on trial
I until June, at which time, if it has proved
jits validity and adaptability to Stanford,
j a merger will be considered.
This action followed the decisions of
both Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. Cabi
nets not to merge their present identity
in the proposed fellowship, but to foster
and support it as an experimental pro
ject. at the same time keeping up their
activities as Christian Associations.
The proposed association is an open
fellowship of Stanford men and women
who associate themselves for intellectual,
i spiritual, social growth, and service in
the campus community. Discussion of
such values among students and with
faculty members, developments of inter
racial and unprejudiced friendships, and
! the carrying on of service projects among
! younger boys and girls in the community
I or on the campus, are part of the plan
! of the new group.
Flexibility will be one of the key-notes
of the organization, according to the
cabinets who provided for the Fellow
ship Society. Experimentation and dis
covery will be part of the spirit of the
unit. Growth will not be stifled by stiff
ness and conventionality, as has been the
j case with similar organizations in past
; years. Mass meetings will tend to make
I the organization more flexible, as well as
jto form policies and further its pur
poses in any way it may choose. Selected
groups from the Fellowship will meet as
necessary to form a clearing-house for
! business, of such nature as would be in
advisable to present to the entire group.
An open forum meeting of the Fellow
ship will be held sometime next week.
The resolutions as adopted at the last
meeting, together with other suggestions
and an immediate proposal for a pro
gram of procedure, will be referred to
the open meeting.
Donald Alden, who was president of
the Y.M.C.A., was elected chairman of
the organization at the meeting Wednes
day night. He will work with an execu
tive committee which is yet to be ap
pointed.
