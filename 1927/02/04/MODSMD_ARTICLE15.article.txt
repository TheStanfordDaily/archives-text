# O'CONNOR WINS HEAT FROM VAN DER AKKER IN INTERCLASS RACES
## Ernst Ophuls Turns in Best Time for 100-Yard Breast Stroke 
### 
Tn one of the most sensational finishes
seen yesterday in the preliminary inter
class swimming races, Wally O'Connor
barely beat out Kryne Van den Akker
in a heat for the 100. Van den Akker
took the lead at the start and held it to j
within 25 feet of the end, when O'Con
nor passed him, just managing to finish 1
ahead. The best time for the 100 was j
0:57 4-5, with O'Connor, Van den Akker,
Christenson, Harrison, and Williams
qualifying.
Ernst Ophuls turned in the best time
for the 100-vard breast stroke, finishing
in 1:16. Qualifying with him were West,
Marx, Conradi, and Wagner.
With but one exception, the same men '
who qualified in the 100 will compete to- i
day in the 50-yard free style. Reg Harri- I
son is ranged first, followed closely by !
Williams and Van den Akker. Doerr i
and Christianson are the fourth and fifth j
men, respectively.
With the four compulsory dives com- j
pleted, Walter Mills is leading the diving
contestants by a very scant margin. Ted
Smith is following right behind Mills in
points, while Neef and Throndson are
also eligible to compete further today.
The finals in the interclass meet will
start at 4:15 this afternoon in the Encina j
pool, and will be open to the public. The
relay, finals in the diving, and the 50, the ;
backstroke, the 220, and finals in the ;
breast stroke and the 100 will take place, j
beginning at that time.
Judging from yesterday's results, pros-!
pects look considerably brighter for the j
seniors. They are entering three out of !
five in the 50, the same in the 100, and 1
one in the diving. The freshmen have |
two entries in the diving and in the
breast, and one in both the 50 and the !
100.
