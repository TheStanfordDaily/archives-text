# TEMPLETON CHARGES GIVEN WET WORKOUTS FOR COMING SEASON
## 
### 
Although Jupiter Pluvius reigns su
preme at present and has put a slight
damper upon track and other outdoor
sporting events, Coach Robert L. "Dink"
Templeton has managed to crowd a con
siderable amount of work into those days
when the sun has shone enough to per
mit him to send his charges through their
paces.
The more the track men work, the bet
ter Templeton likes it. He claims that no
one can go stale because of too much
work. He believes, also, that it takes a
great deal of work to get anyone into
the proper mental and physical condition
necessary to carry him through a season
of hard meets on successive Saturdays.
Templeton Philosophizes
At present Coach Templeton looks
j over his track squad and views the com
j ing season with a very pleasant feeling,
i According to the way he sees things,
l Stanford will have one of its best track
j teams this year. It will possess strength
! in all events, and will be especially well
balanced in power between track and
j field men.
Templeton figures that every team that
will compete with the Cardinal tracksters
! will have a great deal of trouble in
j sneaking over points in the quarter mile,
1 the half mile, the hurdles, the high
jump, pole vault, javelin throw, shot put,
! discus, and broad jump.
! The sprints arc fairly strong, with the
mile about the weakest event. The two
j mile will be taken care of by Ted Criley.
With the many men out for the quarter,
! Coach Templeton will be able to choose a
relay team that will provide plenty of
j competition for any set of quarter milers
in the country.
