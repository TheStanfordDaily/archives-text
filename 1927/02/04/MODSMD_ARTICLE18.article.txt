# SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SQUAD DETERMINED TO BREAK JINX
## Trojans Clash With Cards Tonight in First of Two-Game Series U.S.C. RATED DANGEROUS Freshman Squad Will Meet Salinas High School in Preliminary Game 
### Fred Speers 
Determined to break the jinx which
seems to follow the Southern California
basketball squad, Coach Turner's Tro
jans clash with the Stanford Cardinals
tonight in the pavilion in the first of a
two-game series scheduled for the week
end. As a preliminary game tonight the
Stanford freshmen meet Salinas High
School.
Fully determined to meet California
with a clean slate when the Bruin series
opens. Coach Husky Hunt's varsity,
primed by a week of scrimmage games,
has pointed for the Trojan continually.
Already the Cardinals hold one hairline
decision from the Southerners, having
eked out a one-point victory in an over
time period in the initial contest two
weeks ago.
Lineup Established
Coach Husky Hunt's lineup is estab
lished following the showings of his men
during the past week. Lineups for to
night are announced as follows:
Stanford U.S.C.
Bryant F. Badgro
Christ F. Hibbs
Jayred C. Bruner
\ incenti G. Larenetta
Anderson G. Thompson
'I he Trojans alone will be hampered
by a sicklist, Lewis, alternate guard with
Thompson, being out of the contests fol
lowing an attack of blood poisoniog.
Bryant and Christ Start
Bryant and Christ have started and
played most of the practice scrimmages
together during the past week. Jayred,
at center, seems to be, in a sense, the
key man of the team. If Jayred is going
all right tonight, the Trojans will meet
far more stiff opposition than the games
last week-end with Nevada indicated
that Stanford seemed to possess.
Anderson at standing guard is the
Cardinals' fixture. Vincenti playing run
ning guard will have his work cut out
for him, no small part of which will be
to check the speedy Badgro.
Coach Turner has announced that lie
will use the same lineup against the'
Cardinals as that which lost 30-27 to
California last week. Badgro accounted
for 13 of U.S.C.'s points in that clash.
On the offense, Bruner, tall and rangy
center, is the main cog for Trojan pass
ing attacks. He is also a good shot at
the basket, though occasionally erratic.
Southern California plays a tight de
fensive game, practically every one ot
the Cardinal and Gold men being ace
high in this type of work. Captain Lare
netta is the mainstay in the U.S.C. de
fense.

Already the Cardinals hold one hairline
decision from the Southerners, having
eked out a one-point victory in an over
time period in the initial contest two
weeks ago.
Lineup Established
Coach Husky Hunt's lineup is estab
lished following the showings of his men
during the past week. Lineups for to
night are announced as follows:
Stanford U.S.C.
Bryant F. Badgro
Christ F. Hibbs
Jayred C. Bruner
\ incenti G. Larenetta
Anderson G. Thompson
'I he Trojans alone will be hampered
by a sicklist, Lewis, alternate guard with
Thompson, being out of the contests fol
lowing an attack of blood poisoniog.
Bryant and Christ Start
Bryant and Christ have started and
played most of the practice scrimmages
together during the past week. Jayred,
at center, seems to be, in a sense, the
key man of the team. If Jayred is going
all right tonight, the Trojans will meet
far more stiff opposition than the games
last week-end with Nevada indicated
that Stanford seemed to possess.
Anderson at standing guard is the
Cardinals' fixture. Vincenti playing run
ning guard will have his work cut out
for him, no small part of which will be
to check the speedy Badgro.
Coach Turner has announced that lie
will use the same lineup against the'
Cardinals as that which lost 30-27 to
California last week. Badgro accounted
for 13 of U.S.C.'s points in that clash.
On the offense, Bruner, tall and rangy
center, is the main cog for Trojan pass
ing attacks. He is also a good shot at
the basket, though occasionally erratic.
Southern California plays a tight de
fensive game, practically every one ot
the Cardinal and Gold men being ace
high in this type of work. Captain Lare
netta is the mainstay in the U.S.C. de
fense.
Determined to break the jinx which
seems to follow the Southern California
basketball squad, Coach Turner's Tro
jans clash with the Stanford Cardinals
tonight in the pavilion in the first of a
two-game series scheduled for the week
end. As a preliminary game tonight the
Stanford freshmen meet Salinas High
School.
Fully determined to meet California
with a clean slate when the Bruin series
opens. Coach Husky Hunt's varsity,
primed by a week of scrimmage games,
has pointed for the Trojan continually.
