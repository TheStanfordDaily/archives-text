# KNOWLEDGE VITAL NEED IN WRESTLING DECLARES CHAMPION

"Keeping a clear head is the most
important element in wrestling," says
Ralph Hammonds, University of
Texas man who holds the National
Intercollegiate Championship record
for wrestling.
"Contrary to what a great many per
sons think," says Hammonds, "suc
cessful wrestling is not a result of
great strength but a knowledge of the
art of wrestling and its application.
I would say that about fifty per cent
of good wrestling is due to skill, twen
ty-five per cent to speed, and twenty
five per cent to strength.
"I like to wrestle, but it is such a
crooked game professionally that I do
not care to continue with it after I
graduate from the university next
year."
Hammond's quick rise to the nation
al championship has been unusual. Not
until his freshman year in college did
lie go out for athletics, and he learned
the technique of wrestling so ouickly
that within six months he was beating
all his colleagues. Since then he has
never been defeated.
