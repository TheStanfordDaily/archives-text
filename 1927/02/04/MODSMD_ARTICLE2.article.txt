# NEW RULE WILL NOT INCREASE FLUNKOUTS STATES MRS. HUSTON

Stanford University's fltinkout record
will probably not be materially affected
by the recent ruling made by the Scholar
ship Committee requiring a "C" average
from students on probation, Mrs. Mar
garet Huston, secretary of that commit
tee, said yesterday.
A check-up, made of the records of
past years dealing with failures 'and
"pro's," shows that the number of per
sons who are still in school and would
have fallen victim to the new regulation
is negligible. It is pointed out, further
more, that had such a law been in effect
at that time, these same pepple probably
would have remained in the University
anyway by means of added effort in
their studies.
The ruling becomes effective next quar
ter. Students who are on their second
probation will be dealt with under the
old provision.
