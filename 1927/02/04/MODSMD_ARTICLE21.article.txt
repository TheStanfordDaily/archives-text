Glasses on the right! Glasses on the left!
Mix up another one, Wallv.
How interesting it is t(t note that a little enthusiasm is being shown
over the well-known drinking problem. Last quarter the Executive
Committee sponsored a poll on the prohibition question, and it the results
are remembered correctly, nearly two-thirds of the voters objected to
the \ olstead Act as it is at present.
I onsidering this—is it any wonder that drinking bouts are being
staged on the campus? Youth of today has a reputation for liberal
thinking and also for putting thoughts into action. If students are of
the opinion that they want to drink—they will drink.
1 resident \\ ilbur has charged students with an unusual amount of
drinking the night of the Big Game Rally. lie directed some of his
accusations fraternities. A writer in the Campus Opinion column has
hinted that considerable drinking is done in Encina Hall on week-ends.
Another invites those in search of liquor to trot over to Encina, Toyon.
or Branner.
Sororities, Roble, and Sequoia Hall remain with their virtue as spot
less as the snow on a steep hillside. Is this not a fine thing?
As for the living groups whose members "gurgle the grog"—words
cannot express the writer's feeling towards them.
Is it necessary to point out that drinking is in direct violation to
University regulation? No. it is not. And furthermore, there is an
amendment to the United States constitution which should make drinking
on the campus.impossible. Do the students know this? Yes, they do.
What conclusion can be drawn other than that the students' and
citizens are defiantly violating University and United States laws?
I he Men's Council is a body to mete out punishment, and it is in no
way a detective agency. If the Honor System does not stimulate suffi
cient telling to make possible a full control of the drinking situation,
nothing else will. Certainly faculty control will be 110 better. Students
are able to "keep an eye" on other students, but the faculty sees very
little of what the students do under the protection of darkness.
I he problem is directly up to the students.
If drinking must be done—get off the campus! Go to San Francisco.
San Jose, or way stations.
Put some gas in the car, Wallv.
