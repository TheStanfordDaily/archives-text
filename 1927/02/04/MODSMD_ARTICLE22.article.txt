# Chappie Makes Promise Of Original Cover Idea With February Number
## 
### 
Something new in a Chaparral cover
is being used in the February issue
which will appear early next week.
The subject is one that the magazine
has never yet used, and the Old Roy
promises to knock 'em dead with the
unusual picture.
The cover, which is printed in a spe
cial four-color process, is drawn by
Byron de Bolt, an assistant to Pedro
Lemos, and who has done much art
work for campus publications.
For all those who were not far
sighted enough to subscribe to Chapar
ral, Thomas H. Breeze, editor, says
that a limited number of copies will
be placed on Quad sale.
