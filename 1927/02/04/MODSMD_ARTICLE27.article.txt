Until yesterday no nominations at all J
were made for vice-president of the !
freshman class.
Apparently no freshman had any per
sonal enemies.

Just offhand, can you think of any
office less notable than freshman vice
presi lent during the winter quarter? We
can't v |

A high. school year-book was sup- !
pressed last week for jokes of which
the following was one of the "spiciest": j
"Charley: How's that girl you were
out with last night?
"Gene: Wiser."
Even our typical Stanford co-ed ex
pressed curiosity as to the location of a
place where the supreme naughtiness of
the above could become a moral issue
calling for strong measures.
However, it wasn't in California; just j
in New Jersey, where a trial was recently j

| held about which you may have read.

! Sorry, Too Much Competition
I Dear Cabbages:
I am a junior student at this univer
sity. The hall men think 1 am a sap.
The Row thinks I am an ass. All the
girls think I am-a complete loss. They
are all right. My mother thinks I am a
heluva good egg. She is all wrong.
Please, will you tell Mr. Culver that I
, would like to be an Encina sponsor, and
knock down some room rent ?
Hopefully,
HAM GRAVY.

years.
Let's compromise . •eall it 13.
Second note for historian of year 2000:
Stanford University, 1927—0ne sorority
j ingeniously solved the momentious moral
j question of smoking by ruling it per
j missable downstairs for one couple only.
