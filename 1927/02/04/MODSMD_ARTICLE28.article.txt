To the Editor. Sir:
What a comedy! We, supposedly a
body of students pursuing higher learn
ing. are not able to care for ourselves.
Dignity and independence of thought are
succumbing to docility.
Does Palo Alto think our campus is
but an extension of its High. School
grounds? It must; it sends "God's own
representatives," the W.C.T.U., here to
school us. Then gleefully it claps its
hands as wc endure the results of unin
vited intrusion.
The point is that we are able to police
ourselves. The district NORTH of the
highway is much healthier for W.C.
T.U.'s and other psalm singers. Well
enough that the public should come to
our entertainments, should come and
feast its eyes upon the most generous
gift of the Stanfords. But, Paly, come
here with blinds on; do not make your
self obtrusive in the affairs of our com
munity.

The Editor, Sir:
If one may stray from the subject of
co-ed beauty, or lack of it, when ad
dressing these columns, 1 should like to
decry the appalling domestic bliss that
is slowly but surely settling over the
"farm." Undoubtedly student "uplifters"
and the Bull Session feel that the mil
leniiim is due shortly, and the Excutjve
Committee is doing its best to squelch
any remaining traditions that have man
aged to survive up to date.
While 1 do not advocate wholesale
imitation of the Irwin boys' roughneck
tactics, 1 do think it a darn shame the
way we arc being so completely weaned
away from all the old-time customs.
Since the frosh have been buffaloed into
believing water-throwing the height of
had manners, Encina has become as tame

las' an old ladies home. (Despite the flus
tered remarks of a recent contributor to
! the effect that week-end parties seemed
J to last longer than necessary.)
Now the Big Game bonfire and the
J "roughs" are up on the judicial carpet,
i Let us hope for the best in their case,
! even while fearing the worst,
j In closing, a word of commendation
is due the courageous freshman who as
tounded his fellow diners the other night
I by heaving a healthy custard pie across
the room in true Sennett style. It was
indeed a shock to those gentle souls, but
| in these days such daring is a sure sign
j of greatness!
B. M., '30.

The Editor, Sir:
A few words on a topic which one '
might assume to lie vital to a large num- |
her pi Stanford students. It is most j
peculiar how supposedly intelligent peo
ple can accustom themselves to a con
tinual series of food-inflicted tortures
without even so much as offering pas
sive resistance. Here we have one of the
few enjoyable necessities of life im
posed upon us to an almost criminal de
gree ; and by an organization sponsored, j
governed, and owned by the University. |
Go to the Union Cafeteria some morn- [
ing and order anything you wish for
breakfast. Say you start out with a
baked apple. You look at it—a half- j
cooked, repulsive, sloppy semblance of .
what once could only have been a cull I
greets your eyes. • Taste it—if there is i
any taste to it it is worse than it looks.
Passing on to a little something more :
substantial, you ask for a slice of toast* ;
She, behind the counter, reaches under a :
dirty looking cloth and brings forth a '
steamed, sogged portion of what oncc
could only have been burnt bread, 'litis
she spatters with greasy, melted butter
(?) from a paint 1 »rti>h which has been ;
dipped into a bacteria-infested residue |

from/the kitchen, an accumulation
strengthened by age. Half-heartedly you
dccide to take one more chance—a soft
boiled egg. You go to your table and
sit down. Soon your egg appears. "Ah !''
you Hiink to yourself, "possibly here is
something one can eat and still maintain
his self respect." You break it. A slimy,
semi-gelatinous mass oozes forth from
the shell and, like the man with sea
sickness, you dccide you will not eat
'till noon. Wait! Did I mention the
coffee? Pardon the oversight, but really,
it is altfiost unmentionable. One merely
has to try it and he forever thereafter
prefers Union water.
Cut one might ask, why eat there if j
you don't like it? Most every student !
who has an 8 o'clock can answer that ;
question. (Palo Alto is a mile away.) j
But they don't have to answer it. The j
Union Cafeteria was established to sat- I
isfy a studnt need and it is the duty of j
those in charge to furnish at least partly j
edible food, such that one might go to !
class with a stomach somewhat com-!
posed.
As t< charges, one needs only to com
pare them with the highest priced Palo
Alto restaurants to have his wonder ex- j
cited upon that point. Especially cynical
will he hecomc when he bears of the five
figure losses suffered by the Union each 1
year. .

What a comedy! We, supposedly a
body of students pursuing higher learn
ing. are not able to care for ourselves.
Dignity and independence of thought are
succumbing to docility.
Does Palo Alto think our campus is
but an extension of its High. School
grounds? It must; it sends "God's own
representatives," the W.C.T.U., here to
school us. Then gleefully it claps its
hands as wc endure the results of unin
vited intrusion.
The point is that we are able to police
ourselves. The district NORTH of the
highway is much healthier for W.C.
T.U.'s and other psalm singers. Well
enough that the public should come to
our entertainments, should come and
feast its eyes upon the most generous
gift of the Stanfords. But, Paly, come
here with blinds on; do not make your
self obtrusive in the affairs of our com
munity.

If one may stray from the subject of

and the Bull Session feel that the mil
leniiim is due shortly, and the Excutjve
Committee is doing its best to squelch
any remaining traditions that have man
aged to survive up to date.
While 1 do not advocate wholesale
imitation of the Irwin boys' roughneck
tactics, 1 do think it a darn shame the
way we arc being so completely weaned
away from all the old-time customs.

might assume to lie vital to a large num- |
her pi Stanford students. It is most j
peculiar how supposedly intelligent peo
ple can accustom themselves to a con
tinual series of food-inflicted tortures
without even so much as offering pas
sive resistance. Here we have one of the
few enjoyable necessities of life im
posed upon us to an almost criminal de
gree ; and by an organization sponsored, j
governed, and owned by the University. |
Go to the Union Cafeteria some morn- [
ing and order anything you wish for
breakfast. Say you start out with a
baked apple. You look at it—a half- j
cooked, repulsive, sloppy semblance of .
what once could only have been a cull I
greets your eyes. • Taste it—if there is i
any taste to it it is worse than it looks.
Passing on to a little something more :
substantial, you ask for a slice of toast* ;
She, behind the counter, reaches under a :
dirty looking cloth and brings forth a '
steamed, sogged portion of what oncc
could only have been burnt bread, 'litis
she spatters with greasy, melted butter
(?) from a paint 1 »rti>h which has been ;
dipped into a bacteria-infested residue |

from/the kitchen, an accumulation
strengthened by age. Half-heartedly you
dccide to take one more chance—a soft
boiled egg. You go to your table and
sit down. Soon your egg appears. "Ah !''
you Hiink to yourself, "possibly here is
something one can eat and still maintain
his self respect." You break it. A slimy,
semi-gelatinous mass oozes forth from
the shell and, like the man with sea
sickness, you dccide you will not eat
'till noon. Wait! Did I mention the
coffee? Pardon the oversight, but really,
it is altfiost unmentionable. One merely
has to try it and he forever thereafter
prefers Union water.
Cut one might ask, why eat there if j
you don't like it? Most every student !
who has an 8 o'clock can answer that ;
question. (Palo Alto is a mile away.) j
But they don't have to answer it. The j
Union Cafeteria was established to sat- I
isfy a studnt need and it is the duty of j
those in charge to furnish at least partly j
edible food, such that one might go to !
class with a stomach somewhat com-!
posed.
As t< charges, one needs only to com
pare them with the highest priced Palo
Alto restaurants to have his wonder ex- j
cited upon that point. Especially cynical
will he hecomc when he bears of the five
figure losses suffered by the Union each 1
year. .

To the Editor. Sir:
What a comedy! We, supposedly a
body of students pursuing higher learn
ing. are not able to care for ourselves.
Dignity and independence of thought are
succumbing to docility.
Does Palo Alto think our campus is
but an extension of its High. School
grounds? It must; it sends "God's own
representatives," the W.C.T.U., here to
school us. Then gleefully it claps its
hands as wc endure the results of unin
vited intrusion.
The point is that we are able to police
ourselves. The district NORTH of the
highway is much healthier for W.C.
T.U.'s and other psalm singers. Well
enough that the public should come to
our entertainments, should come and
feast its eyes upon the most generous
gift of the Stanfords. But, Paly, come
here with blinds on; do not make your
self obtrusive in the affairs of our com
munity.

The Editor, Sir:
If one may stray from the subject of
co-ed beauty, or lack of it, when ad
dressing these columns, 1 should like to
decry the appalling domestic bliss that
is slowly but surely settling over the
"farm." Undoubtedly student "uplifters"
and the Bull Session feel that the mil
leniiim is due shortly, and the Excutjve
Committee is doing its best to squelch
any remaining traditions that have man
aged to survive up to date.
While 1 do not advocate wholesale
imitation of the Irwin boys' roughneck
tactics, 1 do think it a darn shame the
way we arc being so completely weaned
away from all the old-time customs.
Since the frosh have been buffaloed into
believing water-throwing the height of
had manners, Encina has become as tame

las' an old ladies home. (Despite the flus
tered remarks of a recent contributor to
! the effect that week-end parties seemed
J to last longer than necessary.)
Now the Big Game bonfire and the
J "roughs" are up on the judicial carpet,
i Let us hope for the best in their case,
! even while fearing the worst,
j In closing, a word of commendation
is due the courageous freshman who as
tounded his fellow diners the other night
I by heaving a healthy custard pie across
the room in true Sennett style. It was
indeed a shock to those gentle souls, but
| in these days such daring is a sure sign
j of greatness!
