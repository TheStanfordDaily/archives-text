THE GREAT AMERICAN ASS. Ano
nymous: Rrentano.
Descendants of the Mayflower are ad
vised not to read "The Great American
Ass," an autobiography by an author
who refused to sign his name.
"It is the story of an ass," announces
i the writer. "I intend to .give the auto
biography not only of an individual, but
|of the tribe. 1 am a sort of diabolical
Messiah. As Jesus, in his perfection,
points to perfection for the whole race,
j so I in my asininity would indicate that
we of the Puritan tradition are asses
| alK \
I sing himself, his relatives and ances
tors as exhibits to prove his contentions,
; the author punctuates his narrative with
j such generalizations as these:
"The Puritan fears life; he fears the
struggle and the defeat. His stomach is
I not at peace with his food. He fears
that he is not healthy enough to make a
living; hence bis dream of federal aid.
He sees his competitors as demons; hence
j he lifts his Nordic totem pole and prays
to it to exorcise all rival tribes or for
jeigners. Puritanism, which is merely the
; fear of life and the desire to retreat into
the egg, is surely doomed in America
I because the men who do not fear life
are becoming more numerous than the
I men who do."
1 To this glass-house dwelling Jeremiah,
j the pioneering of the Puritans was mere-
I lv a proof of their inability to get along
jin the settled communities where they
lived. The search for new lands in the
| Mayflower and later in covered wagons
! is interpreted by him not as a sign of he
! roism or hardihood, but as evidence of
| maladjustment which the Puritan tried to

remedy bj this method (if escape. The
author's immediate ancestors lived on
the New York frontier and later on the
Wisconsin. Nebraska, and Kansas fringes
of civilization.
Who is the author? By blood, a direct
descendant of John and Priscilla Alden.
He was born in Nebraska, educated at
the University of Kansas, entered news
paper work at Kansas City, became a
columnist in New York, and finally a
publicity man and promoter in Wash
ington and Charleston.
The author weakens the plausibility of
bis conclusions by attempting to prove
too much. His fellow Puritans will, of
course, reject and resent everything he
says. The ill-balanced diet of his child
hood to which the author refers so often
and specificially, his consumptive lungs,
and his extreme inferiority complex
made it inevitable that he would write
with a wild gleam in his eye and acid in
his ink. The author believes in a sort of
a dietetic determinism; lie attributes
many of the faults of the Puritans to
their alimentary malfunctioning; and he
himself the living proof of his theory.
li the author liacT got all the vitamins
and other necessary food elements he
needed in his childhood, this book never
would have been written. Many o_f the
mean things he says about the Puritans
are trueâ€”but they are also trtie of the
whole human race. The Puritans have
no monopoly of asinity. This is sub
stantiated by the glimpse of some of the
anaemic nincompoops that are around
colleges today. The real contribution of
this well-written book will be obscured
and negatived by the febrile fury of so
many of its statements.
