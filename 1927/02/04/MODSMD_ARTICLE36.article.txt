# Present-Day Football Is Menaced by Agitation To Abolish Shiftâ€”Rockne

"Football is at the crossroads," says
I Kuute K. Rockne, Notre Dame coach,
j In his opinion the agitation against
the shift menaces the color if not actu
l ally the life of the present-day game.
"I see in the movement for the abo-
I lition of the shift, a reversion to the
j old 'rock 'em and sock 'em' game of
previous years, with each team playing
I a defensive game. The shift has done
I much for offensive football, making
I the game more colorful and pleasing,"
j continues Rockne.
The present ragged, sloppy shift
might be successfully abolished or
j curbed if a fifteen-yard penalty werj?
| imposed on illegal shifts, believes
Rockne. This would make it a smooth
| working piece of machinery.
