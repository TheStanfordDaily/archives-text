# NOVICE TOURNAMENT PROSPECTS GOOD FOR VARSITY BOXING TEAM
## 
### 
Pleased with the showing made by
some of the men in the Novice Tourna
ment and seeing good prospects for
them in the intercollegiate "squared
circle," Coach Harry W. Maloney is
issuing a request that they report for
varsity boxing practice at 4:30 o'clock
this afternoon.
Harry D. Birch, M. L. Brockway, and
H. R. Skelton, lightweights; William
Levit, bantamweight; N. R. Ridley,
E. A. Ridley, welterweights; Milton
Cohen, Jr., and R. A. Dorinan, winner
of the heavyweight medal in the No
vice Tournament last year, are the
men chosen.
Several more would make good ma
terial for Maloney, but ineligibility
prevents them from representing Stan
ford in the ring.
With the first intercollegiate bouts
scheduled for Saturday, February 19,
against the California Aggies in the
pavilion, the varsity squad is starting
intensive training, anil Coach Maloney
and Captain Carlos Miron are putting
the men through fast training periods
each afternoon in Encina Gym.
