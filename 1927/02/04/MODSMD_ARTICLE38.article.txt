# U.C. SUMMER SCHOOL OFFERS NEW COURSES
## 
### 
Thirty-six courses, ranging from ele
mentary swimming, tennis, hockey,
and other field sports to the theory of
physical education, physiology of exer
cise, and kinesiology, are included in
an augmented program in physical
education to be offered at the Univer
sity of California summer session in
Berkeley. The opening of the new
Hearst Gymnasium for women has
given a great deal of additional room
and equipment for such study.
Clarence "Nibs" Price, Walter
Christie, and other well-known physi
cal educational experts from all parts
of the country will join the summer
faculty. Besides the sports courses,
special courses in posture training, in
terpretive dancing, and rhythmic ac
tivity will be given. Bulletins describ
ing in full the liberal summer program
will be issued early this month by the
University of California registrar.
