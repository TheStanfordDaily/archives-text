# VARSITY TENNIS TEAM TO PLAY FIRST GAME TOMORROW MORNING
## Holman and Ogden to Play First Doubles Against Southern Branch 
### 
Captain Cranston Holman and the
other members of the varsity tennis
team will get their first intercollegiate
competition of the season tomorrow
morning at 10:30 o'clock against the
University of California in Los An
geles on the new Stanford courts.
Holman will play first singles for
Stanford, and paired with Lionel Og
den, will play first doubles. Alan Her
rington will play second singles and,
with Ralph McElvenny, will play sec
ond doubles. Ogden will play the re
maining third singles.
The comparative mettle of the
Branch team is unknown. Robert
Laird, former Glendale star, holds
first place on the ranking and will
play Holman. A 1 Duff, ranked second,
draws Herrington, whom he defeated
in Los Angeles a year ago. Bob Stan
ford is scheduled to exchange shots
with Ogden. The pairing of the Branch
men in doubles is uncertain, but Laird
and Duff probably will form the first
combination and Stanford and Rod
Houser the second.
Last year Stanford won every match
from the Branch in the games on the
local asphalt courts, but later, in a re
turn meet on the Southerners' cement
courts, came off with a tie.
In case of bad weather no games
will be played.
