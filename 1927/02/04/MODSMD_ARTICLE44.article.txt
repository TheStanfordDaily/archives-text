## 
### 
Branding criticism of American uni
versities as "contradictory and self-de
stroying in character," President Nicho
las Murray Butler of Columbia launched
a bitter denunciation against the oppo
nents of the modern educational system,
whom he called the "new Philistines," in
his twenty-fifth annual report to the uni
versity.
Dr. Butler claimed that ,our universi
ties are the only places where we still
have freedom of expression, "and the
intolerance that now prevails in Church
and State should not be permitted to
invade the precincts of the universities
of the world." If such a thing occurred,
the world would enter into a new, dismal
dark age, in which man may go through
the motions of progress "but of real pro
gress he can make none for the simple
reason that he has no point from which
to start and no ideal at which to aim.
Modern education needs nothing so
piuch as stout resistance to Philistines
in its every manifestation and a revival
of the classical spirit.
