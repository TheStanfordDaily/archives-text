# STANFORD SCIENTIST DISCOVERS CAUSE OF GROWTH RETARDATION
## 
### 
Striking cessation of the growth and
bodily development in animals follow
ing injury to the pituitary gland was
noted as the result of an experiment of
many years' duration recently com
pleted bv Dr. P. E. Smith of the
School of Medicine. Dr. G. I). Foster,
biochemist at the University of Cali
fornia, pronounces Smith's work as
the "first to isolate reactions due to j
the pituitary alone from others due
to injury to brain tissue surrounding
the pituitary."
Following this experiment, Dr. Fos
ter. working in conjunction with Dr. j
Smith, endeavored to discover whether
the disability incurred by the removal |
of this ductless organ could be traced
through the functioning of the meta- j
bolic processes. By careful measure
ments of the intake of oxygen and the
elimination of carbon dioxide, he de-!
termined that there was a lowering of
the energy transformed in animals
lacking the pituitary. The same reac
tion is found in animals suffering a
deficiency of thyroid.
