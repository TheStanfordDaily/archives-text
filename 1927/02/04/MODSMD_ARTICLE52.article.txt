# JUNIOR OPERA PLOTS DUE TODAYâ€”BARRETT
## 
### 
Today will be the last day in which
Junior Opera plots may be submitted
to Fenton Barrett, chairman of the
Junior Opera committee. Because of
the limited amount of time, any which
are received after this date cannot be
assured of thorough consideration.
The winner will be announced next
week in order to give him time to
finish his manuscript properly.
