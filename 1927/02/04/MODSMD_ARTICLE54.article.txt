# FASHIONS FORECAST BY MADEMOISELLE CHIC SIMPLE, SUBTLE, SMART — SAYS SEASON'S SAVANT RED GRANGE HELMET FURNISHES BONNET MOTIF
## 
### Mademoiselle Chic 
Agc'n. mes soeurs de Stanford, I am
taking my typewriter in my la]), don
ning my foresighted spectacles, and
turning prophet of the coming season.
And you, my dear Stanford sisters,
now that you have asserted your in
dividuality and modernism on the
Melachrino question. I know that you
-wish to assert your femininity and
charm with the same vigor as you
decide your political problems. And in
this direction I hope my words will
prove Chesterfieldian.
Today 1 am making a fashion fore
cast, not of degrees of Fahrenheit, but
of degree of chic. The season is going
to be a good one for the clothing
dealers, for intricacy of design forms
one of spring's predominant novelties.
Priftted silks in checks, plaids, floral
and woven effects of dark and vivid
colors for street or sport, and in deli
cate light colors for afternoon dresses,
are considered very smart. A distinc
tive feature of the season will be
printed Ninghai pongee—imported ma
terial with hand-blocked designs in
rich colors.
Simple and Subtle
Simple and subtle are the two words
most descriptive of the modes for
spring. College has become a matter
<112 three S's to Stanford women, sim
ple. subtle, but oh! how smart! A
subtle touch to a simple frock gives
a sign of sophistication that lends
charm to a woman.
Twelve Rules
has made a list of twelve
rules for Spring chic. They follow:
3. Decline of elaboration and return
to greater simplicity.
2. Ingenuity of cut —a logical de
velopment since only by skillful cut
can a very simple mode have the
quality of distinction.
3. Use of diagonal and curved lines
and of straight lines in tucks, seams,
and pleats.
4. Montone effect, or compose effect,
obtained by use of two or more shades
of one color, or by the combination

of two or more fabrics in one shade,
or by several different thicknesses giv
ing a degrade appearance.
5. Extreme restraint in trimming.
tJ. Low waist-line.
7. Persistent use of the bolero.
8. The sports feeling throughout the
daytime mode, and the .great popular-'
ity of the sweater blouse, the jumper,
and the short jacket.
9. Pleated skirt for daytime with
pleats handled in novel ways.
10. Use of rough crepes for daytime,
and of crepe satin for evening.
11. Decorative use of belts.
12. Appearance of yokes on daytime
frocks.
Spring Colorful
Spring will see a colorful mode,
particularly in California. However,
the prestige of black is established
everywhere and is predominant in
clothes for the country. Black with
white or pink form a color scheme for
many costumes of outstanding chic.
All but formal black coats are varied
by some touch of a clear color. Navy
blue will return with the spring, as
will a faded rose shade, and all of the
blues, and many greens, will be in
smart evidence, while red remains a
favorite.
Sweaters are tremendously import
ant this season, worn with skirts that
match or contrast. Sweaters are of
two colors, or made with stripes in
two-tone and various widths. The
square neck-line is le dernier crie.
The latest word in millinery is the
Red Crange helmet, a close-fitting felt
with its edge cut like ear flaps and a ]
point in the back. "Follow the hair j
line to millinery chic" is a motto well j
taken.
So, my Stanford sisters, you've
read this long article on how to get
chic, sheik, or what not, and you are
forced to open the books to assimi
late that philosophic atmosphere —
that international spirit — that inde
finable something college has to
offer — »
Have a Camel!
