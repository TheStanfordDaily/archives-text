# UNIVERSITY REJECTS INVITATION TO ENTER ORATORICAL CONTEST
## 
### 
Stanford through Executive Committee
decision lias rejected an invitation of the
Better American Federation to partici
pate in the annual Intercollegiate Oratori
cal Contest, held 011 subjects pertaining
to the Constitution.
"Participation in the contest would
force Stanford students to violate their
1 rinciples of intellectual honesty," is the
reason given in a statement made by
Stanley A. Weigel, president of the stu
dent body and chairman of the Execu
tive Committee.
Presenting the decision of the commit
tee. Weigel said:
"Stanford is-forced to refuse to par
ticipate officially because we feel that the
purpose and conduct of the contest is
not in accordance with our ideals of free
thinking. The contest is now arranged
as propaganda for an unchanging and
permanent Constitution, and not in the
spirit of unbiased inquiry. The latter
spirit alone is the only one under which
Stanford cares to sanction official rep
resentation.
"Any Stanford student is, of course,
free to enter the contest, but not as an
official representative of the University.
At a previous contest a Stanford student
made what he thought to be an honest
criticism of the Constitution. One of
the judges at once left the platform. We
do not care to participate under such
conditions of biased judgment."
The national contest is held every year
in Los Angeles, after regional elimina
tion throughout the country. Seven na
tional contestants from each of the reg
ions are judged, each receiving an award
ranging from $350 to $1500.
