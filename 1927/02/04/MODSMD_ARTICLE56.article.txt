# "500" Abstains from Shears Local Barbers Lose Money Ranks of Shingles Shrink
## 
### 
One-fifth of the Stanford women in
living groups on the campus either
have long hair or are struggling to
achieve it. There are eighty-one with
their full share of crowning glory, and
thirteen who are shunning the shears
in an endeavor to get theirs. Roble
Hall claims two-thirds of those in the
latter category.
This means that the Palo Alto and
campus barbers are losing a potential
$837 every year. If these 9.1 abstainers
followed the schedule of their shorn
sisters during the nine months spent
at Stanford, they would expend $837
on keeping their crowning glory the
proper, and just the proper, length.
