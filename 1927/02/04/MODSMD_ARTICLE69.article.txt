# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Although Valentine's day is not un
til a week from Monday, let us take a
peek at some of the peaches who navi
gate through the water via the crawl,
breast, or back stroke, or who dive in
graceful arcs and curves from the
lucky springboard. The reason for all
this is, of course, that the women's
national indoor swimming champion
ships are now in progress at Buffalo,
which city is therefore bulging with
pulchritude, a3 well as natatorial
ability.
Here are two of the more famous
competitors, one a daughter of Sweden,
the other a daughter of Erin, yet both
star members of the Women's Swim
ming Association of New York —the
club that gave Gertrude Ederle to the
vaudeville stage via the English Chan
nel.
Martha Norelius won the title of
outstanding amateur girl swimmer of
192*3 by her many remarkable perform
ances in free-style competition, at dis
tances from 220 yards to a half-mile.
Her best times were 2:40 2-5 for 220
yards and 12:3G 3-5 for 880 yards.
At the present time she is defending

her titles, won last year in Florida,
as champion at 220 and 500 yards. She
also holds the outdoor titles at the
quarter and half-mile distances. Mar
tha started crawling around the parlor
floor about A.D. 1910, and has been
i crawling ever since, changing to the
eight-beat crawl at an early age. When
'■ she was only fourteen, she beat the
I best in the world —including Helen
jWainwright and Gertrude Ederle —in
the 400-meter swim at the Paris Olym
, pics!
Now we come to Agnes Geraghty,
the smiling Irish lassie, who broke
more swimming records in 1926 than
Arne Borg, Walter Spence, or Johnnie
jWeismuller. Twenty-eight new Ameri-:
can marks for breast-stroke swimming
were set by this eighteen-year-old New
| Jersey girl, the foremost of which was
the time of 3:16 1-5 for 200 meters.
In 1924, at the Olympic Games, Miss
Geraghty placed second in the 200-
meter race, which was won in 3:33 1-5,
so you can see how the young lady
has improved in two years. Like her
team-mate Martha, she is the indoor
and outdoor champion at her favorite
I event.

tances from 220 yards to a half-mile.
Her best times were 2:40 2-5 for 220
yards and 12:3G 3-5 for 880 yards.
At the present time she is defending

her titles, won last year in Florida,
as champion at 220 and 500 yards. She
also holds the outdoor titles at the
quarter and half-mile distances. Mar
tha started crawling around the parlor
floor about A.D. 1910, and has been
i crawling ever since, changing to the
eight-beat crawl at an early age. When
'■ she was only fourteen, she beat the
I best in the world —including Helen
jWainwright and Gertrude Ederle —in
the 400-meter swim at the Paris Olym
, pics!
Now we come to Agnes Geraghty,
the smiling Irish lassie, who broke
more swimming records in 1926 than
Arne Borg, Walter Spence, or Johnnie
jWeismuller. Twenty-eight new Ameri-:
can marks for breast-stroke swimming
were set by this eighteen-year-old New
| Jersey girl, the foremost of which was
the time of 3:16 1-5 for 200 meters.
In 1924, at the Olympic Games, Miss
Geraghty placed second in the 200-
meter race, which was won in 3:33 1-5,
so you can see how the young lady
has improved in two years. Like her
team-mate Martha, she is the indoor
and outdoor champion at her favorite
I event.

Although Valentine's day is not un
til a week from Monday, let us take a
peek at some of the peaches who navi
gate through the water via the crawl,
breast, or back stroke, or who dive in
graceful arcs and curves from the
lucky springboard. The reason for all
this is, of course, that the women's
national indoor swimming champion
ships are now in progress at Buffalo,
which city is therefore bulging with
pulchritude, a3 well as natatorial
ability.
Here are two of the more famous
competitors, one a daughter of Sweden,
the other a daughter of Erin, yet both
star members of the Women's Swim
ming Association of New York —the
club that gave Gertrude Ederle to the
vaudeville stage via the English Chan
nel.
Martha Norelius won the title of
outstanding amateur girl swimmer of
192*3 by her many remarkable perform
