# BABE BASKETBALL TEAM PLAYS TWO GAMES THIS WEEK
## MEETS SALINAS TONIGHT Absence of Thompson, Star Guard, May Seriously Weaken Defense 
### 
Red Thompson, star guard and
mainstay of the defense of the
freshman basketball team, will
not play in the Babe games
tonight and tomorrow night.
Thompson was called to his
home in Los Angeles the first of
the week upon receiving word of
his brother's death. He will
probably return in time for the
California series.
With an improved passing attack, the
Stanford freshmen should stack up well
against the Salinas High School cage
squad tonight, whom they meet in the
Pavilion in a preliminary to the varsity
game. Tomorrow night the Babes tackle
Santa Barbara State Teachers College.
Find Other Guards
Upon Thompson's departure early this
week, Coaches Hunt and Mitchell, in or
der to have a guard on hand in case he
should not return, began to work in
three men at that position. Albertson
and Steinbeck have been going well and
have attained a fair degree of success in
keeping the ball out of freshman terri
tory. . Both are tall and aggressive and
so will see action in this week's con
tests. In addition, Smith has been try
ing out for standing guard. Fie played
this position in the freshman-Oakland
High game with Simpkins, and this
combination may be used again.
The freshmen should be able to win
their game this evening if they exhibit
the same brand of basketball that they
have in *c r in"rr.ag«*
The game with Santa Barbara is an
other matter, and the outcome is more
doubtful. The Roadrunners are coached
by Dud DeGroot, former captain of
Stanford's 1022 football team, and are
reported to be a well balanced and fast
team. The hardest duty of the freshmen
will be to guard Williams, Teacher for
ward, who is a dangerous man when
close enough to try for goal shoft. He
made nine baskets against the Pasadena
Pirates and is reported to be an all
around player.
The lineup announced yesterday for
the Babes is: Stewart and Berg, for
wards; Bush, center; Albertson and
Simpkins, guards.
The Santa Barbara lineup will prob
ably be: Williams and Clemore, for
wards ; Grcenough, center; Brubaker and
Foss, guards.
