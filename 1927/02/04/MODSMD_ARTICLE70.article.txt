# MATTHEW STIRLING DISCOVERS PYGMIES IN WILDS OF GUINEA
## 
### 
Matthew Stirling, graduate of the
University of California and a world
famous anthropological explorer, has an
nounced that his party has made the long
awaited discovery of a hitherto unknown
tribe of pygmies in the hinterland of
New Guinea. This expedition is the
second one to search for the pygrnies, the
first one being almost completely anni
hilated by attacks from the natives and
drowning in the swift mountain rivers.
From where Stirling made his supply
base, the party cut their way into the
wilderness for nine days without seeing
a trace of human or animal life. Soon,
they came upon animal tracks, man-made
trails, and trees that had been chopped
down with stone axes. On the tenth
morning they found a well-made rattan
suspension bridge hanging over a gorge,
and the following day they reached the
pygmy village.
In regard to the people, Stirling says:
"We find the pygmies a very kindly,
friendly, hospitable people, in striking
contrast in every way to the Papuans
of the lake plain. They paint themselves
elaborately with black and red paint, and
when dressed up wear gorgeous feather
hi ! I dresses of ca sowary feathers, re
sem' ing Russian fur hats.
