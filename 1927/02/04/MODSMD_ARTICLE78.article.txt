# U.S.C. Builds Four-Story Student Union on Campus
## 
### 
Construction of an elaborate four
story student union building will be
started immediately at the University
of Southern California, announcements
from Los Angeles state. The new
structure will house all student and
alumni offices, lounge rooms for men
and women, publication offices, stu
dent store, and a large ballroom.
Under plans adopted the building
will cost the students nothing. It will
be financed by a fund already estab
lished, and future profits from all cam
pus activities and the student store.
