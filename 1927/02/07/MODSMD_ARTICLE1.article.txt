# VARSITY TRACK MEN RUN BRIEF RACES FOR MEET
## Fred Richman Only Double Winner in Squad's Weekly Contest GOOD RECORDS MADE Cinder Path Still Heavy With Recent Rains; Dashes Omitted 
### Martin Weil 
Running on a track that was still
fairly heavy from last week's rains,
the members of the varsity squad
paced out short distances in every
event but the dashes in last Friday's
weekly meet. Considering the slow
track and the slippery condition of
the field, very good times and dis
tances were turned in.
The only double winner of the after
noon was Fred Richman, who turned
in victories in both the hundred and

Hurdles Prove Battle
The hurdle races proved to be the
usual battle, with Nichols, West, and
Leistner in the running the whole

the victor by less than a step, while in
the 120 lows Leistner beat out his two
opponents by a slightly greater mar
gin.
"Bud" Spencer again chalked up a
victory in the fifth-mile event, sprint
ing past Captain Babcock and Syer
after running third around the last
turn. The time of 39 1-5 was excellent,
and shows that the opponents of these
three men will have to hustle to beat
them to the finishing line.
Moss Wins 660
The 660 was a real race between
Carlsmith and Moss and McKinnon of
last year's freshmen. Carlsmith led all
the way to the last turn, where Tom
Moss uncorked a sprint that brought
him home the victor.
Swain and Ranney won the 3 and 6-
lap races, respectively. In the former,
Jost led nearly all the way but did not
have the final sprint that th© three
