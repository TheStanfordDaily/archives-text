# VARSITY TRACK MEN RUN BRIEF RACES FOR MEET
## Fred Richman Only Double Winner in Squad's Weekly Contest GOOD RECORDS MADE Cinder Path Still Heavy With Recent Rains; Dashes Omitted 
### Martin Weil 
Running on a track that was still
fairly heavy from last week's rains,
the members of the varsity squad
paced out short distances in every
event but the dashes in last Friday's
weekly meet. Considering the slow
track and the slippery condition of
the field, very good times and dis
tances were turned in.
The only double winner of the after
noon was Fred Richman, who turned
in victories in both the hundred and
the furlong. In the former he beat
Zombro, Kingsbury, and Eddie to the
tape by inches only in the fast time
of 10 2-5, but in the 220 he had a far
easier time, coasting in with quite a
lead over the rest of the contestants.
Hurdles Prove Battle
The hurdle races proved to be the
usual battle, with Nichols, West, and
Leistner in the running the whole
way. In the 70-yard highs Nichols was
the victor by less than a step, while in
the 120 lows Leistner beat out his two
opponents by a slightly greater mar
gin.
"Bud" Spencer again chalked up a
victory in the fifth-mile event, sprint
ing past Captain Babcock and Syer
after running third around the last
turn. The time of 39 1-5 was excellent,
and shows that the opponents of these
three men will have to hustle to beat
them to the finishing line.
Moss Wins 660
The 660 was a real race between
Carlsmith and Moss and McKinnon of
last year's freshmen. Carlsmith led all
the way to the last turn, where Tom
Moss uncorked a sprint that brought
him home the victor.
Swain and Ranney won the 3 and 6-
lap races, respectively. In the former,
Jost led nearly all the way but did not
have the final sprint that th© three
The time for the relay was 2:29 flat.
The seniors did not place in the
100-yard breast stroke, which was
fought out between the freshmen and
the sophomores. The race, which was
in fairly slow time, 1:17 2-5, was won
by Ophuls, '29. West, '29, kept the
lead until the last turn, when he lost
out to Ophuls. Third and fourth went
to Conradi and Thornton, both '30.
Record Beaten
Reg Harrison beat the Stanford-
California record for the 50-yard free
style by one second when he nosed
out Williams and Van den Akker in
ft 25:2. The first three men kept right
together throughout the race, while
Doerr. who took fourth, was a few
yards back of the leaders.
Another record was tied when Stev
enson and Hobdy staged a race of
their own in the 100-yard backstroke,
which the former won in 1:12 3-5.
Hobdy, who was the favorite for the
event, kept up with the senior for
three laps, but slowly fell back before
the end. Brooks brought two points
more to the seniors by taking third,
while fourth went to Cole.
Free Style Mark Cut
O'Connor took better than three sec
onds oft a Stanford-California record
by winning the 100-yard free style in
57:2 flat. This race was one of the
hardest fought of the day, OVonnor
taking the lead from the gun with
Harrison sticking close to him. The
freshman, who had just finished two
faces, fell hack to fourth when Wil
liams and Van den Akker forged ahead
of him.
Ted Smith beat out Walt Mills in
the last half of the diving to take first

; place in that event. Mills looked like
a winner until his third dive, when
i his feet touched the hoard as he came
down. Smith's dives, a running %
gainor, a V2 back somersault, a run
ning gainor, and a running iy 2
| forward somersault, were all well
taken, each bringing high scores. Neef
and Throndson, both freshmen, took
j third and fourth.
In the last race of the day, the 220-
yard free style, O'Connor nearly broke
another record by taking first in
2:37 3-5. The most sensational finish
was when Driggs, '30. who had looked
nearly winded, kept going strong
enough to beat out Stevenson. Peters,
another yearling, kept tagging along!
in the rear until the end, when he
sprinted ahead to give Stevenson a
good race for third.

was when Driggs, '30. who had looked
nearly winded, kept going strong
enough to beat out Stevenson. Peters,
another yearling, kept tagging along!
in the rear until the end, when he
sprinted ahead to give Stevenson a
good race for third.
Running on a track that was still
fairly heavy from last week's rains,
the members of the varsity squad
paced out short distances in every
event but the dashes in last Friday's
weekly meet. Considering the slow
track and the slippery condition of
the field, very good times and dis
tances were turned in.
The only double winner of the after
noon was Fred Richman, who turned
in victories in both the hundred and
the furlong. In the former he beat
Zombro, Kingsbury, and Eddie to the
tape by inches only in the fast time
of 10 2-5, but in the 220 he had a far
easier time, coasting in with quite a
lead over the rest of the contestants.
Hurdles Prove Battle
The hurdle races proved to be the
usual battle, with Nichols, West, and
Leistner in the running the whole
way. In the 70-yard highs Nichols was
the victor by less than a step, while in
the 120 lows Leistner beat out his two
opponents by a slightly greater mar
gin.
"Bud" Spencer again chalked up a
victory in the fifth-mile event, sprint
ing past Captain Babcock and Syer
after running third around the last
turn. The time of 39 1-5 was excellent,
and shows that the opponents of these
three men will have to hustle to beat
them to the finishing line.
Moss Wins 660
The 660 was a real race between
Carlsmith and Moss and McKinnon of
last year's freshmen. Carlsmith led all
the way to the last turn, where Tom
Moss uncorked a sprint that brought
him home the victor.
Swain and Ranney won the 3 and 6-
lap races, respectively. In the former,
Jost led nearly all the way but did not
have the final sprint that th© three
The time for the relay was 2:29 flat.
The seniors did not place in the
100-yard breast stroke, which was
fought out between the freshmen and
the sophomores. The race, which was

by Ophuls, '29. West, '29, kept the
lead until the last turn, when he lost
out to Ophuls. Third and fourth went
to Conradi and Thornton, both '30.
Record Beaten
Reg Harrison beat the Stanford-
California record for the 50-yard free
style by one second when he nosed
out Williams and Van den Akker in
ft 25:2. The first three men kept right
together throughout the race, while
Doerr. who took fourth, was a few

Another record was tied when Stev

their own in the 100-yard backstroke,
which the former won in 1:12 3-5.
Hobdy, who was the favorite for the
event, kept up with the senior for

yard free style, O'Connor nearly broke
another record by taking first in
2:37 3-5. The most sensational finish
was when Driggs, '30. who had looked
nearly winded, kept going strong
enough to beat out Stevenson. Peters,
another yearling, kept tagging along!
in the rear until the end, when he
sprinted ahead to give Stevenson a
good race for third.
Running on a track that was still
fairly heavy from last week's rains,
the members of the varsity squad
paced out short distances in every
event but the dashes in last Friday's
weekly meet. Considering the slow
track and the slippery condition of
the field, very good times and dis
tances were turned in.
The only double winner of the after
noon was Fred Richman, who turned
in victories in both the hundred and
the furlong. In the former he beat
Zombro, Kingsbury, and Eddie to the
tape by inches only in the fast time
of 10 2-5, but in the 220 he had a far
easier time, coasting in with quite a
lead over the rest of the contestants.
Hurdles Prove Battle
The hurdle races proved to be the
usual battle, with Nichols, West, and
Leistner in the running the whole
way. In the 70-yard highs Nichols was
the victor by less than a step, while in
the 120 lows Leistner beat out his two
opponents by a slightly greater mar
gin.
"Bud" Spencer again chalked up a
victory in the fifth-mile event, sprint
ing past Captain Babcock and Syer
after running third around the last
turn. The time of 39 1-5 was excellent,
and shows that the opponents of these
three men will have to hustle to beat
them to the finishing line.
Moss Wins 660
The 660 was a real race between
Carlsmith and Moss and McKinnon of
last year's freshmen. Carlsmith led all
the way to the last turn, where Tom
Moss uncorked a sprint that brought
him home the victor.
Swain and Ranney won the 3 and 6-
lap races, respectively. In the former,
Jost led nearly all the way but did not
have the final sprint that th© three
The time for the relay was 2:29 flat.
The seniors did not place in the
100-yard breast stroke, which was
fought out between the freshmen and
the sophomores. The race, which was
in fairly slow time, 1:17 2-5, was won
by Ophuls, '29. West, '29, kept the
lead until the last turn, when he lost
out to Ophuls. Third and fourth went
to Conradi and Thornton, both '30.
Record Beaten
Reg Harrison beat the Stanford-
California record for the 50-yard free
style by one second when he nosed
out Williams and Van den Akker in
ft 25:2. The first three men kept right
together throughout the race, while
Doerr. who took fourth, was a few
yards back of the leaders.
Another record was tied when Stev
enson and Hobdy staged a race of
their own in the 100-yard backstroke,
which the former won in 1:12 3-5.
Hobdy, who was the favorite for the
event, kept up with the senior for
three laps, but slowly fell back before
the end. Brooks brought two points
more to the seniors by taking third,
while fourth went to Cole.
Free Style Mark Cut
O'Connor took better than three sec
onds oft a Stanford-California record
by winning the 100-yard free style in
57:2 flat. This race was one of the
hardest fought of the day, OVonnor
taking the lead from the gun with
Harrison sticking close to him. The
freshman, who had just finished two
faces, fell hack to fourth when Wil
liams and Van den Akker forged ahead
of him.
Ted Smith beat out Walt Mills in
the last half of the diving to take first

; place in that event. Mills looked like
a winner until his third dive, when
i his feet touched the hoard as he came
down. Smith's dives, a running %
gainor, a V2 back somersault, a run
ning gainor, and a running iy 2
| forward somersault, were all well
taken, each bringing high scores. Neef
and Throndson, both freshmen, took
j third and fourth.
In the last race of the day, the 220-
yard free style, O'Connor nearly broke
another record by taking first in
2:37 3-5. The most sensational finish
