# NEW DEPARTURE IN DRAMATIC SEASON MARKED BY 'SWAN'
## Polished European Satire Innovation in Year's Offerings 
### 
"The Swan," Masquers' play to be
presented Friday evening, marks not
only the innovation of the 1927 Stan
ford dramatic season, but a change
from broad American type of comedy,
exemplified by "Hay Fever" and"The
Book of Charm" presented last quar
ter, to the subtle comedy, satire, pol
ish, and brilliance of European drama.
Tickets will be placed on sale tomor
row at 1 o'clock in the Old Union at
prices of seventy-five cents and one
dollar.
Finished Production
In point of brilliance of lines, splen
dor of settings, and experience of the
cast, "The Swan" promises to be the
most finished Stanford presentation of
the year. The play itself has met with
signal success both in America and
Europe, and has also been transferred
to the screen. Using a classical plot,
but employing characters of modern
cut and actions, Franz Molnar has
cleverly enacted an imminent tragedy
in royal life, and then as cleverly
solved the enigma, all with a touch
of sentiment and reality, but with
quiet derision for the royal characters.
Royal Setting
Concerning the intimate lives of
near-royal families, the plot has called
for settings of the most elaborate pos
sible nature. Leslie Kiler and Chry
sella Dunker Kiler have thus been
faced with the two problems of con
structing massive and elaborate sets,
and of reducing the time required for
inter-act changes to a minimum. To
this end a permanent set has been
constructed to form the basis for the
scenes, and by means of changes in
trappings, tapestries, drapes, furni
ture, and lighting, the different effects
are obtained with surprising rapidity.
Under the direction of Gordon
Davis, the cast has been holding re
hearsals for the past two weeks. Al
though each of the seven principles
has participated in at least one pre
vious campus play, continual efforts
have been necessitated to insure the
poise, dignity, and expression required
to portray the characterizations in
"The Swan."
