# VARSITY TENNIS MEN MAKE CLEAN SWEEP OF BRANCH MATCHES
## Stanford Players Lose Only Two Sets Out of Seven 
### 
Losing but two sets, the varsity ten
nis team made a clean sweep of all
seven matches with the University of
California, Southern Branch, on the
local courts Saturday afternoon.
Captain Cranston Holman, playing
first man for Stanford, won in straight
sets 6-4, 6-4 from Rod Houser in the
best match of the afternoon. Houser
seemed undaunted by the refutation
of his opponent and played a cool,
heady game. Rushing the net behind
his fast service he anticipated Hol
man's passing shots with unusual suc
cess, often cutting them down for
points outright. Holman hung on to
his own service steadily. The games
alternated in each set until they had
following his own to win the set.
Alan Herriugton started in poorly
on Ron Smith, Bruin man, but man
aged to fire up after losing the first set
7-5. He won the second set 6-0, and
the deciding one 6-4. Smith showed a
steady backcourt game, but after the
first set was unable to match drives
successfully with Herrington.
Lionel Ogdeti outsteadied Ralph
Schellbach all through their two sets.
Schellbach, left-handed, had a natural
curve on his service which brought it
steadily to Ogden's backhand. By
means of this shot and a good fore
hand drive he managed to win four
games in the first set and two in the
second.
Ralph McElvenny and John Wheat
ley, Stanford, won over Rolland Smith
and John Wessmith, respectively. Mc-
Elvenny had a close contest, dropping
the second set, but winning the match
6-4, 3-6, 6-0; Wheatley outclassed
Wessmith 6-2, 6-0.
