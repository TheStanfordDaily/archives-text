# CARDINAL BASKETBALL TEAM TWICE DEFEATS SOUTHERNERS
## Both Contests Marred With Rough Play; Personal Fouls Frequent SPECTATORS THRILLED Good Teamwork Supported By Heady Coaching Wins Games for Stanford 
### Fred Speers 
Stanford emerged victorious from
j two terrifically fought contests with
| the University of Southern California
| basketball team in games played over
j the week-end in the pavilion. Id Fridr.y
, night's clash, the Cardinal took an un
j expected win, 24 to 19; in Saturday's
j contest Stanford took an expected
victory, 35 to 26.
Different Lineups
Coach Husky Hunt used different
'starting lineups in both games. His
J two sets of forwards achieved the
i same result by different means, one,
j the first, by means of a short passing
! attack coupled with considerable drib
| bling, while the other resorted in the
i early stages of Saturday's contest to
! a long passing game. Both games were
i marred by personals, technicals, rough
! Playing, an dother characteristics of
games in which both contests and
spectators were keyed to high pitch.
It was teamwork of a heady sort
supported by crafty coaching on Coach
Husky Hunt's part that won the games
I for the Cardinal. Hard individual plav
j ing on the part of the Trojans was
j not enough to cope with a Cardinal
! case team that was. for the greater
part of both games, in a condition that
may be summed up by the word
"right."
Tied at Half
Stanford led at half time in the
initial contest by the narrow margin
of one field goal, 11-9, while in the
: second clash the half-time gun found
| b °tfi teams battling at 15-all. Still an
-1 other difference existed between the
two games: in Friday's contest the
Stanford outfit made about half again
1 as many tries at field goals as did the
Trojans, while in Saturday's the teams
i were about even in tries for the bas
yet. U.S.C. made 42 tries, Stanford 46.
The first game opened with both
teams playing cautiously to feel out
the other's defense. Vincenti started
the scoring by sinking a free throw,
and Bruner, Trojan center, returned
the honor a second later. Vincenti apd i
to 6 and at this point Stanford un-
Bryant then brought the Card score up
limbered its -phort passing attack. The
Trojans, alarmed at the score, tossed j
j wild, futile shots at. the basket until 1
Badgro sneaked in and twirled a short
one into the hoop for IT.S.C.'s first field
goal. Bruner added another, making it
from a tip-off play under the Card
basket.
Anderson and Javred, who had gone |
in for Dobson, were the mainstays of !
the Cardinals in that first half.
In the second half the "battle royal"
began. Both Bruner and Anderson
were jerked in quick order on per
sonals. and Hunt sent in Biaggini at
standing guard. Christ and Bryant j
were coming through in great style, !
both playing speedy passing games, j
Bryant had trouble occasionally by j
running with the ball. Christ's feeding
to Javred. who was in his prime cn j
short shots, was commendable.
With a score of 22 to 19 in the
Cardinals' favor, and Hibbs missing \
two free throws, Stanford began stall- i
ing. Seeing his chance, Jayred broke i
loose on a long dribble down the floor
to sink another short one shortly be
fore the game ended.
Well satisfied with what his first set j
of forwards had done the night before.
Coach Husky Hunt started Captain
David and Price in the second game
with Jayred at center. It was all David, j
so far as Stanford was concerned, in
the opening minutes. In quick order
the Cardinal skipper, playing his best,
game of the season, ran up eight
points.
TT.S.C. looked ragged and uncertain.
Hibbs failed to play the game he had
the night before, though Badgro'
marked himself as being the most con-'
sistent Trojan on the floor. With the '
score at 9 to 6. Badgro sank two
free throws, one for the crowd's "boo- r
ing."
This speeded up the teams, Vincenti, ;
Jayred, Bruner, and Thomas register
ing field goals. Shortly before the
close of the half Bruner tied the score
at 15-15 with a free throw on Vin
centi's foul.
The second half was simply a galaxy
of field goals, coming from a floor on
which two teams wore battling in a
fast, rough game. The Trojans had j
already lost Hibbs on fouls, and Lara- j
neta, their captain, went to the bench !
shortly after. In the meanwhile, Stan
ford had sent in McCandless, Lewis, j

land Christ to speed matters still more j
with fresh players. The device sue- j
| ceeded, and the Cardinal took the esc- J
I ond game, 35 to 26.

David and Price in the second game
with Jayred at center. It was all David, j
so far as Stanford was concerned, in
the opening minutes. In quick order
the Cardinal skipper, playing his best,
game of the season, ran up eight
points.
TT.S.C. looked ragged and uncertain.
Hibbs failed to play the game he had
the night before, though Badgro'
marked himself as being the most con-'
sistent Trojan on the floor. With the '
score at 9 to 6. Badgro sank two
free throws, one for the crowd's "boo- r
ing."
This speeded up the teams, Vincenti, ;
Jayred, Bruner, and Thomas register
ing field goals. Shortly before the
close of the half Bruner tied the score
at 15-15 with a free throw on Vin
centi's foul.
The second half was simply a galaxy
of field goals, coming from a floor on
which two teams wore battling in a
fast, rough game. The Trojans had j
already lost Hibbs on fouls, and Lara- j
neta, their captain, went to the bench !
shortly after. In the meanwhile, Stan
ford had sent in McCandless, Lewis, j

land Christ to speed matters still more j
with fresh players. The device sue- j
| ceeded, and the Cardinal took the esc- J
I ond game, 35 to 26.

Stanford emerged victorious from
j two terrifically fought contests with
| the University of Southern California
| basketball team in games played over
j the week-end in the pavilion. Id Fridr.y
, night's clash, the Cardinal took an un
j expected win, 24 to 19; in Saturday's
j contest Stanford took an expected
victory, 35 to 26.
Different Lineups
Coach Husky Hunt used different
'starting lineups in both games. His
J two sets of forwards achieved the
i same result by different means, one,
j the first, by means of a short passing
! attack coupled with considerable drib
| bling, while the other resorted in the
i early stages of Saturday's contest to
! a long passing game. Both games were
i marred by personals, technicals, rough
! Playing, an dother characteristics of
games in which both contests and
spectators were keyed to high pitch.
It was teamwork of a heady sort
supported by crafty coaching on Coach
Husky Hunt's part that won the games
I for the Cardinal. Hard individual plav
j ing on the part of the Trojans was
j not enough to cope with a Cardinal
! case team that was. for the greater
part of both games, in a condition that
may be summed up by the word
"right."
Tied at Half
Stanford led at half time in the
initial contest by the narrow margin
of one field goal, 11-9, while in the
: second clash the half-time gun found
| b °tfi teams battling at 15-all. Still an
-1 other difference existed between the
two games: in Friday's contest the
Stanford outfit made about half again
1 as many tries at field goals as did the
Trojans, while in Saturday's the teams
i were about even in tries for the bas
yet. U.S.C. made 42 tries, Stanford 46.
The first game opened with both
teams playing cautiously to feel out
the other's defense. Vincenti started
the scoring by sinking a free throw,
and Bruner, Trojan center, returned
the honor a second later. Vincenti apd i
to 6 and at this point Stanford un-
Bryant then brought the Card score up
limbered its -phort passing attack. The
Trojans, alarmed at the score, tossed j
j wild, futile shots at. the basket until 1
Badgro sneaked in and twirled a short
one into the hoop for IT.S.C.'s first field
goal. Bruner added another, making it
from a tip-off play under the Card
basket.
Anderson and Javred, who had gone |
in for Dobson, were the mainstays of !
the Cardinals in that first half.
In the second half the "battle royal"
began. Both Bruner and Anderson
were jerked in quick order on per
sonals. and Hunt sent in Biaggini at
standing guard. Christ and Bryant j
were coming through in great style, !
both playing speedy passing games, j
Bryant had trouble occasionally by j
running with the ball. Christ's feeding
to Javred. who was in his prime cn j
short shots, was commendable.
With a score of 22 to 19 in the
Cardinals' favor, and Hibbs missing \
two free throws, Stanford began stall- i
ing. Seeing his chance, Jayred broke i
loose on a long dribble down the floor
to sink another short one shortly be
fore the game ended.
Well satisfied with what his first set j

, night's clash, the Cardinal took an un
j expected win, 24 to 19; in Saturday's
j contest Stanford took an expected
victory, 35 to 26.
Different Lineups
Coach Husky Hunt used different
'starting lineups in both games. His
J two sets of forwards achieved the
i same result by different means, one,
j the first, by means of a short passing
! attack coupled with considerable drib
| bling, while the other resorted in the
i early stages of Saturday's contest to
! a long passing game. Both games were
i marred by personals, technicals, rough
! Playing, an dother characteristics of
games in which both contests and
spectators were keyed to high pitch.
It was teamwork of a heady sort
supported by crafty coaching on Coach
Husky Hunt's part that won the games
I for the Cardinal. Hard individual plav
j ing on the part of the Trojans was
j not enough to cope with a Cardinal
! case team that was. for the greater
part of both games, in a condition that
may be summed up by the word
"right."
Tied at Half
Stanford led at half time in the
initial contest by the narrow margin
of one field goal, 11-9, while in the
: second clash the half-time gun found
| b °tfi teams battling at 15-all. Still an
-1 other difference existed between the
two games: in Friday's contest the
Stanford outfit made about half again
1 as many tries at field goals as did the
Trojans, while in Saturday's the teams
i were about even in tries for the bas
yet. U.S.C. made 42 tries, Stanford 46.
The first game opened with both
teams playing cautiously to feel out
the other's defense. Vincenti started
the scoring by sinking a free throw,
and Bruner, Trojan center, returned
the honor a second later. Vincenti apd i
to 6 and at this point Stanford un-
Bryant then brought the Card score up
limbered its -phort passing attack. The
Trojans, alarmed at the score, tossed j
j wild, futile shots at. the basket until 1
Badgro sneaked in and twirled a short
one into the hoop for IT.S.C.'s first field
goal. Bruner added another, making it
from a tip-off play under the Card
basket.
Anderson and Javred, who had gone |
in for Dobson, were the mainstays of !
the Cardinals in that first half.
In the second half the "battle royal"
began. Both Bruner and Anderson
were jerked in quick order on per
sonals. and Hunt sent in Biaggini at
standing guard. Christ and Bryant j
were coming through in great style, !
both playing speedy passing games, j
Bryant had trouble occasionally by j
running with the ball. Christ's feeding
to Javred. who was in his prime cn j
short shots, was commendable.
With a score of 22 to 19 in the
Cardinals' favor, and Hibbs missing \
two free throws, Stanford began stall- i
ing. Seeing his chance, Jayred broke i
loose on a long dribble down the floor
to sink another short one shortly be
fore the game ended.
Well satisfied with what his first set j
of forwards had done the night before.
Coach Husky Hunt started Captain
David and Price in the second game
with Jayred at center. It was all David, j
so far as Stanford was concerned, in
the opening minutes. In quick order
the Cardinal skipper, playing his best,
game of the season, ran up eight
points.
TT.S.C. looked ragged and uncertain.
Hibbs failed to play the game he had
the night before, though Badgro'
marked himself as being the most con-'
sistent Trojan on the floor. With the '
score at 9 to 6. Badgro sank two
free throws, one for the crowd's "boo- r
ing."
This speeded up the teams, Vincenti, ;
Jayred, Bruner, and Thomas register
ing field goals. Shortly before the
close of the half Bruner tied the score
at 15-15 with a free throw on Vin
centi's foul.
The second half was simply a galaxy
of field goals, coming from a floor on
which two teams wore battling in a
fast, rough game. The Trojans had j
already lost Hibbs on fouls, and Lara- j
neta, their captain, went to the bench !
shortly after. In the meanwhile, Stan
ford had sent in McCandless, Lewis, j

land Christ to speed matters still more j
with fresh players. The device sue- j
| ceeded, and the Cardinal took the esc- J
I ond game, 35 to 26.

TT.S.C. looked ragged and uncertain.
Hibbs failed to play the game he had
the night before, though Badgro'
marked himself as being the most con-'
sistent Trojan on the floor. With the '
score at 9 to 6. Badgro sank two
free throws, one for the crowd's "boo- r
ing."
This speeded up the teams, Vincenti, ;
Jayred, Bruner, and Thomas register
ing field goals. Shortly before the
close of the half Bruner tied the score
at 15-15 with a free throw on Vin
centi's foul.
The second half was simply a galaxy
of field goals, coming from a floor on
which two teams wore battling in a
fast, rough game. The Trojans had j
already lost Hibbs on fouls, and Lara- j
neta, their captain, went to the bench !
shortly after. In the meanwhile, Stan
ford had sent in McCandless, Lewis, j

land Christ to speed matters still more j
with fresh players. The device sue- j
| ceeded, and the Cardinal took the esc- J
I ond game, 35 to 26.

Stanford emerged victorious from
j two terrifically fought contests with
| the University of Southern California
| basketball team in games played over
j the week-end in the pavilion. Id Fridr.y
, night's clash, the Cardinal took an un
j expected win, 24 to 19; in Saturday's
j contest Stanford took an expected
victory, 35 to 26.
Different Lineups
Coach Husky Hunt used different
'starting lineups in both games. His
J two sets of forwards achieved the
i same result by different means, one,
j the first, by means of a short passing
! attack coupled with considerable drib
| bling, while the other resorted in the
i early stages of Saturday's contest to
! a long passing game. Both games were
i marred by personals, technicals, rough
! Playing, an dother characteristics of
games in which both contests and
spectators were keyed to high pitch.
It was teamwork of a heady sort
supported by crafty coaching on Coach
Husky Hunt's part that won the games
I for the Cardinal. Hard individual plav
j ing on the part of the Trojans was
j not enough to cope with a Cardinal
! case team that was. for the greater
part of both games, in a condition that
may be summed up by the word
"right."
Tied at Half
Stanford led at half time in the
initial contest by the narrow margin
of one field goal, 11-9, while in the
: second clash the half-time gun found
| b °tfi teams battling at 15-all. Still an
-1 other difference existed between the
two games: in Friday's contest the
Stanford outfit made about half again
1 as many tries at field goals as did the
Trojans, while in Saturday's the teams
i were about even in tries for the bas
yet. U.S.C. made 42 tries, Stanford 46.
The first game opened with both
teams playing cautiously to feel out
the other's defense. Vincenti started
the scoring by sinking a free throw,
and Bruner, Trojan center, returned
the honor a second later. Vincenti apd i
to 6 and at this point Stanford un-
Bryant then brought the Card score up
limbered its -phort passing attack. The
Trojans, alarmed at the score, tossed j
j wild, futile shots at. the basket until 1
Badgro sneaked in and twirled a short
one into the hoop for IT.S.C.'s first field
goal. Bruner added another, making it
from a tip-off play under the Card
basket.
Anderson and Javred, who had gone |
in for Dobson, were the mainstays of !
the Cardinals in that first half.
In the second half the "battle royal"
began. Both Bruner and Anderson
were jerked in quick order on per
sonals. and Hunt sent in Biaggini at
standing guard. Christ and Bryant j
were coming through in great style, !
both playing speedy passing games, j
Bryant had trouble occasionally by j
running with the ball. Christ's feeding
to Javred. who was in his prime cn j
short shots, was commendable.
With a score of 22 to 19 in the
Cardinals' favor, and Hibbs missing \
two free throws, Stanford began stall- i
ing. Seeing his chance, Jayred broke i
loose on a long dribble down the floor
to sink another short one shortly be
fore the game ended.
Well satisfied with what his first set j
of forwards had done the night before.
Coach Husky Hunt started Captain
David and Price in the second game
with Jayred at center. It was all David, j
so far as Stanford was concerned, in
the opening minutes. In quick order
the Cardinal skipper, playing his best,
game of the season, ran up eight
points.
TT.S.C. looked ragged and uncertain.
Hibbs failed to play the game he had
the night before, though Badgro'
marked himself as being the most con-'
sistent Trojan on the floor. With the '
score at 9 to 6. Badgro sank two
free throws, one for the crowd's "boo- r
