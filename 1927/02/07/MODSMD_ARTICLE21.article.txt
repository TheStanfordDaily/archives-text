# TOONERVILLE CARS QUIT SERVICE PAST BOOKSTORE STATION
## 
### 
Beginning today street car ser
vice on the campus will extend
to the Stanford Bookstore station
only and the run to the Roble
station near the Press building
will be discontinued indefinitely,
states a bulletin posted by the
Peninsula Railway Company.
With the shortened route, it will
no longer be necessary for the
cars to cross Lasuen, the place
of several accidents. The com
pany does not state that this is
the reason for making the change.
