# FRESHMAN CAGE FIVE DOWN SALINAS HIGH, SANTA BARBARA MEN
## New Combination Used in Game With Teachers College Team 
### 
By using a new combination that
functioned with perfect smoothness,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshmen de
feated the Santa Barbara State Teach
ers College squad Saturday night by
the decisive score of 32 to 14. Friday
night the babes won from the Salinas
High School quintet 26 to 16.
It was a lucky piece of maneuvering
when Coaches Hunt and Mitchell
moved Bush, former center, up to run
ning guard, and put Rothert in Bush's
place at center. Berg was the other
forward and Simpkins and Albertson
held the guarding berths.
Team Improved
With the addition of Thompson, star
guard, on the team this week, the
freshman mentors will have a most
formidable aggregation. The power of
this new combination was partly real
ized against the Santa Barbara Road
runners. Although Albertson played a
creditable game, he needs experience
at guard. If Thompson had been play
ing, the chances for the babes to hold
the Teachers to a smaller score would
have been augmented.
This new lineup has not been chosen
as permanent as yet by the freshman
coaches, and it is not entirely perfect,
but it is the best that five freshmen
have played so far this season against
team that is strong.
Flaw Shown
One of the flaws that DeGroot's
Roadrunners brought out was that the
babes are spasmodic in showing bursts
of speed and clever playing and then
letting the aggressiveness die out al
most in the same five minutes. On the
other hand, when Bush got going he
was hard to stop and was generally
accurate on getting the ball into the
hoop, making nine points for the
babes. The big center has quite a lot
to learn about jumping, but when he
takes the ball on the follow-up shots,
his 175 pounds has enough force to
carry him through the strongest de
fense to the edge of the basket.
Glover of Santa Barbara was one
of the fastest forwards that the babes
have had to face in any previous
game. All of DoGroot's men played a
heady game. They used the man-to
man defense which brought out the
disadvantages to be found when this
system is put up against the territory
defense style such as the babes used.
Salinas Game Ragged
The game against Salinas was rag
ged and uninteresting. The freshmen
took an early lead and maintained it
throughout the remaining periods.
Russell, center, was tried out in his
first game with the babes and im
proved his standing by his guarding
in tlic defense. Hagestad, Salinas for
ward, was high-point man of the game
by tallying 14 points out of a total of
16 for his school.

ers College squad Saturday night by
the decisive score of 32 to 14. Friday
night the babes won from the Salinas
High School quintet 26 to 16.
It was a lucky piece of maneuvering
when Coaches Hunt and Mitchell
moved Bush, former center, up to run
ning guard, and put Rothert in Bush's
place at center. Berg was the other
forward and Simpkins and Albertson
held the guarding berths.
Team Improved
With the addition of Thompson, star
guard, on the team this week, the
freshman mentors will have a most
formidable aggregation. The power of
this new combination was partly real
ized against the Santa Barbara Road
runners. Although Albertson played a
creditable game, he needs experience
at guard. If Thompson had been play
ing, the chances for the babes to hold
the Teachers to a smaller score would
have been augmented.
This new lineup has not been chosen
as permanent as yet by the freshman
coaches, and it is not entirely perfect,
but it is the best that five freshmen
have played so far this season against
team that is strong.
Flaw Shown
One of the flaws that DeGroot's
Roadrunners brought out was that the
babes are spasmodic in showing bursts
of speed and clever playing and then
letting the aggressiveness die out al
most in the same five minutes. On the
other hand, when Bush got going he
was hard to stop and was generally
accurate on getting the ball into the
hoop, making nine points for the
babes. The big center has quite a lot
to learn about jumping, but when he
takes the ball on the follow-up shots,
his 175 pounds has enough force to
carry him through the strongest de
fense to the edge of the basket.
Glover of Santa Barbara was one
of the fastest forwards that the babes
have had to face in any previous
game. All of DoGroot's men played a
heady game. They used the man-to
man defense which brought out the
disadvantages to be found when this
system is put up against the territory
defense style such as the babes used.
Salinas Game Ragged
The game against Salinas was rag
ged and uninteresting. The freshmen
took an early lead and maintained it
throughout the remaining periods.
Russell, center, was tried out in his
first game with the babes and im
proved his standing by his guarding
in tlic defense. Hagestad, Salinas for
ward, was high-point man of the game
by tallying 14 points out of a total of
16 for his school.
By using a new combination that
functioned with perfect smoothness,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshmen de
feated the Santa Barbara State Teach
ers College squad Saturday night by
the decisive score of 32 to 14. Friday
