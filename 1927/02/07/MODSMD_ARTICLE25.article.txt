# A 						Reminder

### 
I agree to live up to the letter and spirit of the student honor
system by honesty in all my personal conduct and by neither giving
nor receiving unpermitted aid in examinations, class exercises, re
ports, or any other work that is to be used by the instructor as a
basis of grading.
If I violate this pledge, I agree to withdraw from the University.
A CERTAIN STUDENT.
On registration day Stanford students signed the Honor Pledge to
insure good faith. Each signer was fully aware that the honor system
is an institution, but many were thought to be a bit negligent at times.
Thusly, the Men's Council and the Administration obtained some three
thousand signatures in the event that some errant youth should make a
false step and later plead an ignorance of the extent of the system.
Still for the last quarter and one-half the Men's Council has been
confronted with several cases—the honor system has been violated. On
the whole the number of cases has been small. For the number of
students enrolled, it is in no way surprising that there should be a few
who would violate the law. In every turn of life there are always a few
who either make a mistake or who are possessed with a weakness that
overpowers honest reasoning.
But collectively students have the strength of character to keep
themselves above frequent temptations. Those who violate an honor
pledge deserve full punishment. The Men's Council has been lenient.
Many times it has offered an offender an easier course than withdrawing
from the University.
It is hard for a group of students to request a fellow student to
withdraw, but now these lenient souls are becoming a bit riled.
President Wilbur has pointed out to them some common offenses, and
still others have reached their attention. They cannot trace down the
culprit, but they can prosecute. And for the future they promise harsher
punishments. Watch your step. Be honest!
