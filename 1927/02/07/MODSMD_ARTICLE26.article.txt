Boys will be boys and girls .will be girls!!
How often this time-worn and frayed expression is applied to youth,
and how boring it is. In fact, when the remark is made one often feels
the desire to get to his feet and issue forth vehement protestation. The
general application of this phrase forces all to shoulder the burden of
errors for a few.
As has been pointed out, mistakes have been made and always will
be made. Therefore, young people must be kept from temptation, and
it rests upon the shoulders of those responsible to see that this is done.
With this in mind the Oregon Agriculture College Administration for
some time has enforced the ruling that the women at that institution
shall be enclosed within the portals of their respective homes before the
hour of eleven-thirty post meridian.
But the gallant young men of O.A.C. feel that this restriction is an
imposition. The latest complaint was issued last week in the columns
of the student newspaper when they jointly pleaded for an extension of
lock-out hours. Believe it or not, the administration forced the sopho
more cotillion to break up in time to get the women home by the
appointed hour of 11:30.
A university is supposed to give to the world mature men and women,
but while students at O.A.C. it appears that they are not recognized as
such.
