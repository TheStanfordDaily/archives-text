As if the bonfire's recent close es
cape from the administrative axe were
not enough, along comes the Men's
Council with a threat to abolish the
time-honored rough tradition. Heavy
indeed are the hearts of the senti
mental alumni, whose tear-filled eyes
see the fetishes of the past becoming
the taboos of the future.
One way you look at it, a law for
bidding long skirts —just a futile pass
in the air as it were. However, one
may easily understand the righteous
wrath of the Men's Council.
You have heard the old saw, "Boys
will be boys." It is always lugged in
when boys have behaved themselves
like yeggs. Just now, the old bromide
is about to be hauled out of the moth
balls and dusted off for a new public
appearance. For once again the local
boys have been boys.
In this particular instance, the boys
have expressed themselves in the
manner made famous by the two little
Dutch fellows of the comic Sunday
supplement. Unfortunately, there was
no glue handy that the boys might
pour into a professor's hat; nor could

| any goat be found who could be in
duced to eat a case of dynamite pre
paratory to exploding on the postoffice
steps. So the party the boys planned
was a comparatively poor affair. They
simply cut some electric wires, and
•stole a freezer-full of ice cream, and
called it a day. It was hardly any fun
jat all. All it did was to break up a
I sorority dance.
And now the Men's Council proposes
to abolish the rough tradition by way
of settling the affair. It is really not
the way to get at the root of the evil.
All right to apprehend the perpe
trators of this hooligan humor. And
quite all right to punish them in any
manned that is deemed fitting. But it
| is not quite fair to abolish the rough
tradition until all roughs have proved
themselves deserving of extermination
; as a class.
Understand, we hold no particular
brief for roughing. We simply hate to
i see another burdensome prohibitive
statute placed on the books. As we
j have pointed out before, that famous
"luft der friehiet" has already died
away to a fitful breeze. Give it a
i chance.
