The Editor. Sir!
Deeply moved by the passing of so
many of our most-treasured and sacred
traditions, I am, nevertheless, con
strained to remind my fellow-students !
that we have at least one tradition
here which will never die, despite the
various attempts against which have j
been made in the past. With this ob-1
ject in view I am submitting the fol
lowing contribution, with the hope \
that you will find some small corner
of the paper in which to stick it in.
This One Will Never Die
With old Jup. Pluvius to egg me on.
and with Dr. Wilbur's word of "a se
ries of quadrangles extending along
the highway," still ringing in my ears, j
T, too. feel the prophetic urge. In the :
distant future I see a road, a wide
and bumpy road, with great deep pools j
of thick and slushy mud. The sun will ;
go down on a still better and greater
Stanford, and out of the gloom will
sound the age-old curses and invec- j
tives of a hapless student doing an
unwilling steeple-chase from the Quad
home. The Encina lights will beckon, j
and the brave adventurer will plunge i
on.
Six years ago I walked the self- j
same road. Over it, in the dead of'
night, I escaped the dreaded sophs, j
and later chased some hapless frosh. j
The years have rolled by, and still T
tread the same old road of yore; the j
pools are now a. little deeper—a little
slushier, perhaps, but the all-surround
ing gloom is just as thick.
Poster fights have gone, the "dink" i
is but a memory, but the dark old road
remains. Who fears that all our tradi-1
tions will soon die?
I hope and trust that this may si- I
lonce some of those discontended
souls who fear for the perpetuity of
all our traditions —my faith is great. '
Sincerely, W. Ernest Aitken.
The Editor, Sir:
Here's to the brave "500," men to
the right of them, men to the left of
them, and men in front of thom! For- J
tuna juvat!
Judging from the volleys of smoke 1
that have recently been piped from
Encina through the coh'imns of the :
Campus Opinion, airing to the world
the views of Stanford's hope (the lads
of '30), T might, safely venture to pen
my expert opinion. It may be true that
"brains and beauty do not go togeth
er." The author is not committing
himself, not having seen enough to
judge; however, the following lines
probably express the sentiment of the
Stanford debater who had little chance
for refutation:
Mary use t' be my girl,
Bless the poor kid,
Rut her best friend wouldn't tell 'er
And T went and did.
After all is said and done (if it ever
Is all said), beauty is only one thing,
which at the deepest is only skin-deep.
For the present we'll not discuss tW'e
other fine qualities of women. What- |
ever it might be, it will suffice to say !

that Stanford women have it. Let us
imagine for the moment that there
wera only 500 men and 2600 co-eds in
this institution of higher learning. It
would be a rather unique situation, to
say the least; but it is probable that
the 500 padres would clutch more
tightly the tails of their American
Eagles, and pay less heed to the bar
ber-shop sign, "It pays to look your
best." "E Pluribus Unum" (out of
many one) would be taken more liter
ally that "In God we trust" for one.
For the benefit of those to whom
the point in this article seems vague,
the author's theory is based on the
principle of "supply and demand."

Deeply moved by the passing of so
many of our most-treasured and sacred
traditions, I am, nevertheless, con
strained to remind my fellow-students !
that we have at least one tradition
here which will never die, despite the
various attempts against which have j
been made in the past. With this ob-1
ject in view I am submitting the fol
lowing contribution, with the hope \
that you will find some small corner
of the paper in which to stick it in.

T, too. feel the prophetic urge. In the :
distant future I see a road, a wide
and bumpy road, with great deep pools j
of thick and slushy mud. The sun will ;
go down on a still better and greater
Stanford, and out of the gloom will
sound the age-old curses and invec- j
tives of a hapless student doing an
unwilling steeple-chase from the Quad
home. The Encina lights will beckon, j
and the brave adventurer will plunge i
on.
Six years ago I walked the self- j
same road. Over it, in the dead of'
night, I escaped the dreaded sophs, j
and later chased some hapless frosh. j
The years have rolled by, and still T
tread the same old road of yore; the j
pools are now a. little deeper—a little
slushier, perhaps, but the all-surround
ing gloom is just as thick.
Poster fights have gone, the "dink" i
is but a memory, but the dark old road
remains. Who fears that all our tradi-1
tions will soon die?
