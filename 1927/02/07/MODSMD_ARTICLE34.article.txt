# STANFORD GRADUATE'S PAINTINGS SHOWN AT CAMPUS ART GALLERY
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
Representative work by a Stanford j
student appears in the new exhibition
in the Art Gallerv where Ivan Messen-!
I
ger's paintings are being shown from j
February 6 to February 20'. The artist j
is a Stanford graduate and is at pres- i
rnt living in San Diego. A number of j
his pictures show scenes of that south- j
ern city with its romantic touches of
color and old Spain in the buildings of 112
the 1916 Exposition.
Perhaps the outstanding feature of j
Messenger's landscapes is his vivid !
color representing in truth the spirit i
of California. California is a land of
strong and positive colors, and Ivan
Messenger has made his colors clear
and vivid. The color is almost idealized
in some pictures.
A few of the landscapes showing
California scenes are: "Desert Pat
tern," "Desolation," "Balboa Park,"
"Rim of the Desert." "Cabrillo Arches,"
"Peristyle," "In Palm Canyon," and
"Beneath Balboa Bridge."
"Carmel Cypress" has such a
strength and clearness of color, and !
a mastery of the windly feeling in the
atmosphere, that the observer can al
most feel the cool, brisk breeze sweep
ing by him. "Point Lobos" is a picture !
of the ocean and sky in all the various |
shades of blue and purple.
The etchings of Gene Kloss will re- j
main on exhibition until February 16.
A number of California scenes are
shown in her work also.
