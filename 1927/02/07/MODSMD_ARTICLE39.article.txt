men who placed%.showed. Ranney, Cri
ley, and Truman easily outdistanced
the rest of the field in the mile and a
lialf and came in in the order named.
All the field events but the discus
â– and the javelin were very close.
Krenz, a freshman, won the discus
with a throw of 137 feet 8 iuches. All
of the contestants found the slippery
field disastrous, and all had great diffi
culty remaining on their feet and stay
ing within the circle. In the javelin
llirow Harlow was returned the victor
when he heaved the spear 194 feet.
C.oodcell was second and Joaquin
third.
Shot Hard Fight
The other weight event, the shot,
was a hard fight between Way, Krenz,
Forster, and Fleislihacker. The first
three finally gained the coveted places.
Hob King, with a leap of six feet,
won the high jump from French. In
the broad jump Sid Meeks pulled his
leg after going well over 21 feet on
his first jump; this event was finally
won by Fred Zombro, who beat Meeks :
lone trial by four inches. To win the
pole vault Edmonds cleared the bar at
12 feet. In all of these events the
slippery clay in the runways greatly
hindered the jumpers from making
any very goood marks.
