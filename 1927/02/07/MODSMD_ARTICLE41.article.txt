# FAMOUS PORT-SIDERS
## 
### Feg Murray 
"A little south-paw now and then is
relished by the best of men" ("men"
referring to the managers and coaches,'
in this instance.) At any rate, it does \
-seem as though the port-sider has his i
good points, even though the unortho
dox athlete is often looked upon with
ridicule and accused of having a left
handed brain. Eccentricities may go
hand in hand with those who eat, I
i
write, and throw with the port mitt,
hut there are plenty of southpaws
whose brains are not at all like the

famous Rube Waddell's, and who real
ly enjoy a decided advantage over
their fellow beings in a certain branch
of sports.
"Petit" Parisien, who throws passes
with his left arm, southpawed North
western and Southern California to
death last football season and won
two big games for Notre Dame, where
a right-hander might have failed. That
a left-footed kicker is an asset to a
team has been proved before, too, and
Captain George Guttormson of the

University of Washington was no ex
ception. Men who can get oft' those
long, tricky, left-footed spirals are very
nice to have around, and many a coach
has longed for a man like Sam Felton,
who went to Harvard when Harvard
had real football teams.
Omitting for this time any discus
sion of southpaws in boxing and golf,
where goood ones are few and far be
tween, and tennis, where there are
many examples of great left-handed
players, let us take a look at the so
oalled national pastime, where the
port-sider really comes into his own.
left-handed athlete of all is often seen
At present, the name of the greatest
on the sports pages, because of Babe
Ruth's contract with the Yankees. For
merly one of the best of southpaw
pitchers, then the greatest long-dis
tance batter of all time, Babe Ruth

[ has established the port-side upon a
I pinnacle of achievement where even
\ such famous left-handed artists as
| Leonardo da Vinci and Charley Chap
; lin never could put it.
With men like Ruth. Cobb, Speaker,
j Sisler, Collins, Wheat, Roush, Rice,
j and others batting from the left side,
| and pitchers like Pennock, Sherdel,
Grove, Rixey, Ruether, Yde, May, and
others throwing left-handed, it is no
wonder that the boys of today think
that a successful baseball career will
come more quickly to them if they
train themselves as southpaws.
Every team has at least one left
handed pitcher and several left-handed
batters, but the Steine Printers' team
of Fort Worth, Texas, is composed en
tirely of players who bat and throw
left-handed. I bet they even shako
hands with the wrong fin!
