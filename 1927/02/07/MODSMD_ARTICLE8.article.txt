# SENIORS TAKE FIRST IN CLASS SWIMMING MEET; BABES SECOND
## All But Ten of 1927 Points Piled Up by Stevenson, O'Connor, Williams 
### 
j The combination of Wally O'Connor,
i Carl Stevenson, and Bob Williams was
enough to bring first place in the
interclass swimming meet to the class
of '27. Of the thirty-nine points that
were awarded to the seniors, the three
stars brought in all but ten. The
freshmen, who finished second, had
j twenty-five points to their credit, while
j the juniors and the sophomores had
j eleven and nine points respectively.
At the end of four of the seven
events, the seniors were barely hold
ing nn to a two-point lead, with the
freshmen having a good chance to take
up a goodly part of the next three
events. With first places in all three,
however, the seniors decidedly kept
the babes out of a dangerous position.
All Races Close
Every race was close, beginning
with the four-man relay. Th© seniors
took the lead early in the race, with
Stevenson. Williams, and Christenson
ably keeping ahead of their rivals. In
I the last lap, Reg Harrison, the year
i ling's best threat for high honors,
| started a good six yards after O'Con
! nor. The freshman made a good try,
! but wishing to save himself for the
| 50 and seeing that he had no chance
j to win, yet had second place secure,
j he did not make a sensational finish.
