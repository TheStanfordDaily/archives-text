Reduction of the minimum requirement

made in the provisions of this article.
r l his was dene at the instance of Stanley
Weigel, who declared that sophomores
should have the right to vote for these
men who exercise disciplinary authority
over them. This new ruling, in his opin
ion, will tend to bring the Council closer
to the student body as a whole and make
it less of an aloof tribunal.
In an eltort to clearly distinguish be
tween the legislative functions of the
Executive Committee and the judiciary
functions of the Men's Council,"two sec
lions were added to the article on the
powers of the Executive Committee, pro
viding that the committee should have
full legislative and executive power over
all matters relating to the general welfare
of the Associated Students and also giv
ing it authority to make such rules and
regulations for the conduct of students
as it shall deem fit.
The Men's Council was specifically lim
ited to judiciary functions. The Miscel
laneous article of the Constitution was
eliminated, and in its stead one substi
tuted which provided that questions of
interpretation of the instrument should
be referred to the Dean of the Law
School. In addition, the head of the

1 Department of Political Science was
authorized to pass on the form of all
constitutional amendments before they
are published in the Daily and submitted
to the students at an election.

j day for one week previous to the time at
| which it is to be voted upon. The alterna-
I tive of posting such an amendment was
j eliminated.

A recommendation to President Wilbur
and Dean Culver that the men sponsors
be chosen by the Men's Council under a
system similar to that used by the women
in selecting their sponsors was authorized
by the Constitution Committee at its
meeting last night.
Addition of a section to the article on
Student Control providing for the ap
pointment by the Dean of Men and the
Council Chairman of live students to
Men's Council to serve during the sum
mer quarter was also proposed by the
committee.
Sophomores to Vote
Reduction of the minimum requirement
for voters for Men's Council vacancies
from 75 .to 45 hours of work was also
made in the provisions of this article.
r l his was dene at the instance of Stanley
Weigel, who declared that sophomores
should have the right to vote for these
men who exercise disciplinary authority
over them. This new ruling, in his opin
ion, will tend to bring the Council closer
to the student body as a whole and make
it less of an aloof tribunal.
In an eltort to clearly distinguish be
tween the legislative functions of the
Executive Committee and the judiciary
functions of the Men's Council,"two sec
lions were added to the article on the
powers of the Executive Committee, pro
viding that the committee should have
full legislative and executive power over
all matters relating to the general welfare
of the Associated Students and also giv
ing it authority to make such rules and
regulations for the conduct of students
as it shall deem fit.
The Men's Council was specifically lim
ited to judiciary functions. The Miscel
laneous article of the Constitution was
eliminated, and in its stead one substi
tuted which provided that questions of
interpretation of the instrument should
be referred to the Dean of the Law
School. In addition, the head of the

1 Department of Political Science was
authorized to pass on the form of all
constitutional amendments before they
are published in the Daily and submitted
to the students at an election.
Publishing of any such proposed
amendment is required in the Daily each
j day for one week previous to the time at
| which it is to be voted upon. The alterna-
I tive of posting such an amendment was
j eliminated.
The committee next meets Wednesday
j afternoon at 5 o'clock in the A.S.S.U.
I offices.
