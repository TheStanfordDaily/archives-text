# CARDS TUNING UP FOR FRESNO TILT
## Ned Anderson on Sidelines Because of Injury in Last Week's Game 
### Fred Speers 
Having safely tucked U.S.C. away.
Coach Husky Hunt and his basketball
team are turning their attention to the
Fresno State game next week-end. The
Cardinal mentor plans to use much
j the same series of scrimmage prac
! tices for getting his varsity in trim
as he did preceding the Trojan con
tests.
With the opening tilt of the Cali
fornia series looming but two weeks
away, Stanford has at present at least
one advantage over Nibs Price's Bears
—U. S. C. is no longer between the
Cardinals and California. Price was
present at the Stanford-Trojan game
Saturday night.
Anderson Injured
An injury to Ned Anderson, ranking
standing guard of the Cardinals, oc
curred Saturday night in the form of
jan injured, possibly broken, blood
I vessel. A minor operation was per-
I formed and doctors said that Ander
son will be out of practice for a couple
of days.
For practice last night the varsity
scrimmaged the Sigma Chi intramural
team. Biaggini started in Anderson's
place. At forwards Husky Hunt used
Captain David and Bryant, later send
ing in Christ for Bryant. Jayred start
ed at center and Lewis at running
guard.
Against Sigma Chi the varsity used
a short passing attack such as enabled
it to worry the Trojans Saturday
night. But the fraternity team was not
to be denied, Farmer, Bowers, and
Larsen, all playing good individual
games. However, they were not good
enough collectively to check Jayred
and Bryant under the basket.
U.S.C. Complimented
One thing was significant following
the first Trojan tilt and that was
Coach Turner's remark made after the
game which implied that it was mighty
hard to make a basketball team out of
football players. Coach Turner was
not knocking the U.S.C. team by that
remark; he was complimenting it, and
justly so, for being as good a team as
it is. On the Trojan team were several
football players, Laranetta and Drury
being the most notable.
On the regular Cardinal string used
against U.S.C. were only two football
men: Price and Lewis, neither hav
ing gridiron talent comparable to Tur
ner's men. And therein lay still an
other difference between Southern
California and Stanford —as well as
several Stanford cage teams of the
past.
