## Mussolini Not Able to Hold His Power; Autocrats Bound to Lose 
### 
"If the money devoted to the cost
of two wars were turne dtoward the
examination of disease in tlie tropics
and' to making other uninhabited
places livable the population of the
world could increase many fold," was
the answer of Dr. David Starr Jordan
to the question put before him at a
discussion which followed his talk to
the Stanford Episcopal Club Sunday
evening.
The question asked was: "What
would keep down the population of
the world if war were abolished?" Dr.
Jordan believes that there will eventu
ally come a t'me when there will be
no more wars.

In a preliminary talk to the club
I Dr. Jordan gave his view as a scien
tific man of the life of Jesus Christ.
"Jesus was a man who saw life face
to face. As soon as the world ceases
to be governed by men whose con
sciences are misdirected by erroneous
ideas of right and wrong, such as the
well-meaning friars who persecuted
heretics in the Spanish inquisition, we
will be able to realize true Christian
ity."
When asked what he thought of
Mussolini, Dr. Jordan said, "I think
of him as little as possible. Democracy
is the only practical form of govern
ment. Mussolini of the twentieth cen- [
tury is like Napoleon of the eight- j
eenth, and his end will be the same.
There are many in America today j
who think they want the return of a j
Roosevelt to the presidency of the I
United States. They do not want this." j
No one ever ruled any country, no !
matter how leuiently, without having I
the majority against him at the end i
of three or four years. An extremely j
autocratic government cannot last as j
a strong opposition is bound to rise j
against it. The people must rule them- j
selves to be happy. The United States'
system, however, is an improvement
over the government of France, where
the executive changes with every
whim of the people. A French premier j
does not stay in office on an average 1
of more than two months. With such J
an unstable form of government it is !
impossible to meet a crisis, conse- i
quently the treasury of France has!
not been able to re-establish itself." !
China is another country he likes !
to think as little about as possible, j
"America's only safe attitude toward '
China is conciliation."
In regard to the Niacaragua situa-1
tlon Dr.[ Jordan declared that the j
sooner the United States left Central :
America alone the better.

"If the money devoted to the cost
of two wars were turne dtoward the
examination of disease in tlie tropics
and' to making other uninhabited
places livable the population of the
world could increase many fold," was
the answer of Dr. David Starr Jordan
to the question put before him at a
discussion which followed his talk to
the Stanford Episcopal Club Sunday
evening.
The question asked was: "What
would keep down the population of
the world if war were abolished?" Dr.
Jordan believes that there will eventu
ally come a t'me when there will be
no more wars.
Gives Christ Views
In a preliminary talk to the club
I Dr. Jordan gave his view as a scien
tific man of the life of Jesus Christ.
"Jesus was a man who saw life face
to face. As soon as the world ceases
to be governed by men whose con
sciences are misdirected by erroneous
ideas of right and wrong, such as the
well-meaning friars who persecuted
heretics in the Spanish inquisition, we
will be able to realize true Christian
ity."
When asked what he thought of
Mussolini, Dr. Jordan said, "I think
of him as little as possible. Democracy
is the only practical form of govern
ment. Mussolini of the twentieth cen- [
tury is like Napoleon of the eight- j
eenth, and his end will be the same.
