Polls for the mid-year A.S.S.IT. elec
tion open this morning at 8:30 o'clock
and close at 2 p.m.
The men's polls will be located at
the Law Steps and will remain open
from 12 until 1. Women can vote there
during that hour, but during the other
hours they cast their ballots at the
women's polls, situated opposite the
main entrance to the Library.
No Voting Machines
No voting machines will be used, as
previously planned, is the announce
ment of George Ellsworth, chairman
of the Election Board. He explains
that the Board expects such a heavv
vote, because of tfte new rule allowing
both graduates and undergraduates
holding student body cards to cast
ballots, that it was afraid the three
machines offered by the Registrar of
Voters in San Francisco would not
properly take care of the numbers.
Only men who have passed seventy
five or more hours can vote for the
two members of Men's Council. This
is the only restriction placed on the
A.S.S.U. balloting.
Because of the number of candidates
running for Men's Council, President
of the Class of 1927, and President of
the Class of 1929, respectively, campus
politicians are predicting that a sec
ond election will be necessary to de
cide these offices.
