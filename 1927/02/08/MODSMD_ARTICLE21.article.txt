# Presenting, Mr. Adams

Dear Wilbur :
Today you become editor of The Stanford Daily.
According to the A.S.S.U. Constitution, which is now being revisec
with an aim to secure simplicity, you will receive $2.00 per issue, 10 pei
cent of the total profits, the entire personal blame for any mistake tha
appears in the paper, griping from those who fall under the editoria
hammer, and continuous wailings from our numerous campus publicity
seekers. But, Wilbur, old man, think of the opportunity you have to d(
or die for deali old Alma Mater. 'Swunerful.
I would like you to recall that the workings of the Y.M.C.A. hav<
recently been investigated. When a few faults were pointed out th<
organization frantically clutched for the apron strings of the Y.W.C.A
And now, with the moral support of the women, they have organizec
what is to be known as the Stanford Fellowship. The move is just i
beautiful gesture. It is just a little action that creates an outer layer ol
protection to shield the weakness of the Y.M.C.A. Think the situatioi
over and treat it judiciously from the points of advantage and disadvan
tage to the student body as a whole.
Give publicity until it hurts. When anyone comes rushing into the
office asking for columns of blah about how swell their pet hobby is—
throw out two or three legitimate news stories and write up their idea al
great length. The campus craves to read columns of publicity. But dc
not entertain the idea any of the publicity agents will even then be satis
lied. Some of .them, especially the Glee CJub, will still claim they deservec
more attention.
By the way, W T ilbur, watch up on Steve O'Donnell and his
Session. Some people still believe that a Big Game rally bonfire could
be a success if turned into a "glorified wiener-roast." Watch Steve
do not let him become too critical.
As for Stanford women assuming the privilege to smoke—think
nothing of it. The move is justified and helps toward the end of some
hypocrisy, which by the way is very prevalent on this campus. The
W.C.T.U. at its next quarterly meeting may formulate a letter of protest,
but what if they do?
Be careful of what you say in the editorial columns about the Board
of Athletic Control. Al Masters will take all criticisms as directed at
him personally. This fact is regrettable, for Al is okey, he does his best
for the Board, and we all like him, but when a mistake is made even
unbeknownst to him any criticism will hurt. Be constructive, not de
structive !
And say, old fellow, there is a good chance for you to laugh up your
sleeve at the A.S.S.U. constitution revision committee. The committee
is perfectly okey. but it seems as though they misinterpret the word
"revision." The purpose of appointing them as was announced at the
time of their inception was to aim at simplicity and permanency—there
are two sides to the case. Perhaps there are and perhaps there arc not.
But above all, Wilbur, have you read about the nine students in eastern
universities who have recently committed suicide? You are very liable
to experience all the joys and disappointments of these men, but after
you do—do not feel that you have seen all of life. Stick to it and if you
become disgusted with everything, as you may do if you complete your
term, do not give up, thumb your credentials and show them where you
stand.
When it comes to eloing away with the "rough" tradition—please try
your best to help out the "boys on the Farm." It is a good old idea—help
it along.
Perhaps I have already told you more than I should have ventured,
but I will risk one more remark before closing. Do not commit yourself
on whether the Stanford women are good-looking. -
With hopes,
Harry

Editorial staff will meet at 1:15 o'clock today.
