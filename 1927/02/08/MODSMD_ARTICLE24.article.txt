To the casual observer one of the !
most noteworthy features of the series
of letters that have recently been con
tributed to this page in defense of
the bonfire is that a large part of
them have been written by freshmen.
It is characteristic of freshmen to
maintain that the old days were vastly
superior to the present. Whenever the
abolition of an old tradition is sug
gested, it is the freshmen who hasten
to forestall the movement.
Why is this? Is it because freshmen
simply like to hear themselves talk?
Or is it, rather, the expression of sin
cere opinion? And if the latter, on
what basis do first-year students con
sider themselves qualified to discuss
traditions musty with age?
♦ * *
To answer these questions, let us
begin with the obvious. Of course, any
experience that a freshman has with
the past at Stanford must necessarily
be vicarious. Not having been here
during the old days, a freshman, when
he speaks of those old days, is as
sumed to be speaking of what some
one has told him about those old days.
Who, then, is responsible for the
roseate glow with which the past is
enveloped in the minds of these year
lings? Ah! There we have it. Who

else but the alumni? the memory-lov
ing. alma mater-worshipping alumni.
Seated at several thousand assorted
hearths they nightly blow smoke
rings, the while they regale the idle
hour with tales of their college days,
of college days when men were men
and the faculty knew its place, of
college days when life was worth liv
ing and there were no flies in the
mustard. In short, they tell of college
days that were pretty nearly Utopian,
as college days go.
And who listens to this palaver? Ah!
Again we see the light! The young
men listen. The young men who are
shortly to come to Stanford (some of
them because they believe the pala
ver). They listen with mouths agape.
And who wouldn't if he believed it?
So the young men come to Stan
ford. And what do they find? Base
reality, friends, base reality (reality
that seems all the more base when
compared to the beautiful picture of
things as they were in the dim, dead
days of long ago).
Now is it aught but natural that,
when a suggestion is made to abolish
some tradition musty with age, the
freshmen assume the attitude mili
tant? It is not. It simply means that
someone has been kidding the fresh
men.

So the young men come to Stan
ford. And what do they find? Base
reality, friends, base reality (reality
that seems all the more base when
compared to the beautiful picture of
things as they were in the dim, dead
days of long ago).
Now is it aught but natural that,
when a suggestion is made to abolish
some tradition musty with age, the
freshmen assume the attitude mili
tant? It is not. It simply means that
someone has been kidding the fresh
men.
To the casual observer one of the !
most noteworthy features of the series
of letters that have recently been con
tributed to this page in defense of
the bonfire is that a large part of
them have been written by freshmen.
It is characteristic of freshmen to
maintain that the old days were vastly
superior to the present. Whenever the
abolition of an old tradition is sug
gested, it is the freshmen who hasten
to forestall the movement.
Why is this? Is it because freshmen
simply like to hear themselves talk?
Or is it, rather, the expression of sin
cere opinion? And if the latter, on
what basis do first-year students con
sider themselves qualified to discuss
traditions musty with age?

To answer these questions, let us
begin with the obvious. Of course, any
experience that a freshman has with
the past at Stanford must necessarily
be vicarious. Not having been here
during the old days, a freshman, when
he speaks of those old days, is as
sumed to be speaking of what some
one has told him about those old days.
Who, then, is responsible for the
roseate glow with which the past is
enveloped in the minds of these year
lings? Ah! There we have it. Who

else but the alumni? the memory-lov
ing. alma mater-worshipping alumni.
Seated at several thousand assorted
hearths they nightly blow smoke
rings, the while they regale the idle
hour with tales of their college days,
of college days when men were men
and the faculty knew its place, of
college days when life was worth liv
ing and there were no flies in the
mustard. In short, they tell of college
days that were pretty nearly Utopian,
as college days go.
And who listens to this palaver? Ah!
Again we see the light! The young
men listen. The young men who are
shortly to come to Stanford (some of
them because they believe the pala
ver). They listen with mouths agape.
And who wouldn't if he believed it?
