■ To the Freshmen, it acts as a sifter,

[ ers, and dead-beats of their class far

1 do in academic affairs, so Mr. Daves
' and Company handed them a Smoke-
Up one midnight, and the Frosh made
the big discovery that some of the
upperclass men were constructively
interested in campus activities. Im
plied unity?
The coaches may take their men off
'the campus during the excitemcnt, but
1 they couldn't take them far enough
for any man to be ignorant of what it
was all about, not to know that the
Bonfire was a big one, that the stu
dents had life enough to tear around
' yet, and that the Memorial Stadium
would be filled with someone besides
reporters, and football scouts.
The Alumni saw that Pile and
watched it burn, foreseening some
thing they had hoped and worked for
in every Big Game. Would they have
made the buttons on their vests creak
and their smiles as expansive at a
quiet meeting illuminated with a little
red tire and a lot of oratory?
Then too, "The Glorified Weiner
, Roast" has little to do with the Bonfire
itself. Men may have to hoist a few
flagons before roaring through the
streets, but inebriation is not essen
tial in viewing conflagrations unless
the onlooker seeks plural sight.
But. after all, the Bonfire IS only a
tradition, like the Law Steps custom,
and our splendid Hello idea. Why not i
j abolish the "Hello"? It only interrupts

Stanley Weigel has the correct atti

THE HONOR SYSTEM
is an Institution in this Univerisity.
1 Its existence and enforcement rest I
with every loyal Stanford Student.
All of us know of this highly laud
able sentiment which is so deeply im
! bedded in the fibre of our University. J
It has been proclaimed an institution
which will strengthen our characters
j by allowing our own reason and con-!
science to decide the truth of the
sfn'ement that "Honesty is the best
olicy." Speeches from various plat
•rms and essays from various publica

, tions have extolled its merits. Either
in approval or resignation students
i each quarter have signed the pledge.
It has indeed proven itself the strong
hold of the University.
Particularly in the rase of A Certain
1 Student has it proven its worth to
the University. Last spring quarter
A Certain Student took a certain
I course. This Student took every exam
ination, received his papers back with
grades on them, and proceeded on his
way. Before going home for the sum
mer. this Student, in cleaning his room
preparatory to abandoning it, dis
carded such papers as he was through
j with. A week after he had reached his
i home in the South, his grades arrived.
: Among them was an incomplete in
the above-mentioned course. Upon his
return to the University the succeed
ing fall quarter, the Student asked his
professor the reason for the incom
plete. The professor told him that the
; class record carried no grade for the
I student's second examination, which
counted twenty-five per cent of the
grade in the course. The student stated
j that the numerical grade on the exam
ination paper in question was sixty
five, and that on the class average
given out by the professor at the
time, the grade would have repre
j sented a C plus. The professor replied
readily enough that, man to man, he
believed the student, but that profes
sionally he could not accept the word
of the student, who was naturally as
much on his honor in reporting the
grade of the examination as he had
been in taking it. The reply of the
professor was that the honor system
could not be applied in such a case.
If one judges the student from a low
standard, certainly the professor was
correct in his stand. However, the
honor system ostensibly professes to
hold implicit faith in the moral back
bone of those under its regime. Is it
applicable only in the classroom,
where it would be well-nigh impossible
for the professor to stop cheating
without an organized police force?
Procters might be hired, but think of
the expense! Indeed, the honor sys-!
tem does fill a need, whether one is
idealistic-ally or mercenarily minded.
If the educated men of a university
cnnnot trust their own charges, how
can such a group in the majority favor
a League of Nations 7 The case cited
cannot be shrugged aside, for the stu
dent received the assurance of the
professor that his decision would be
validated by the registrar.
For A Certain Student another bub-1
ble has been shattered.

The Editor, Sir:
Recently the "llull Session" has
been endeavoring to organize a crn
sade to bring about the abolition of
the Pig flame Bonfire. It has attempt
ed to point out the outstanding faults

of this "saturnalia," namely: that
there is excessive drinking both be
fore and during its burning; that it in
no way serves as an inspiration to the
team: that due to the yearly increase
in size, far more time and expense are
put on it than the freshmen can af
ford: that the freshmen resent the
forced labor which they are required
to expend in its building; and that
generally it is a most useless tradi
tion and should be abolished. Person
ally, while I admit that some of these
faults exist, I cannot see any reason
why they could not easily be removed.
In regard to the drinking. I believe
that in the minds of some men in this
University the bonfire has become
synoymous with New Year's Eve —a
time when everyone should get drunk.
I believe that several heavy penalties
imposed by Men's Council would eradi
cate that feature. As for the statement
by the "Bull Session" that no one in
his right mind would yell for two
hours if sober, I resent that, for I did,
and I know a good many others who
did also. And I believe our minds were
as whole as anyone's. As for the sec
ond point, I don't know just what ef
fect the bonfire has on the team, but.
I should think it would have a most
discouraging effect if it were abol
ished. Certainly the enthusiasm on the
campus before the bonfire is trans
ferred to some extent to the team, and
if the enthusiasm were reduced by its
abolition, the spirit of the team would
also suffer a reduction. I agree that at
present altogether too much of the
freshmen's time and money are spent
on the bonfire, but this is due chiefly,
I believe, to lack of competent man
agement and an endeavor to make
each bonfire larger than the last. By
putting the supervision of the con
struction in the hands of an experi
enced and efficient committee of up
perclassmen, by limiting the size of
the structures, and by lessening the
required amount of labor per man, T
think that this fault would be done
away with. Lastly, I feel very sure
that few freshmen resent working on
the bonfire —what they do resent is
doing sixteen hours of work. That IS
too much, but it could be cut in half
and just as much accomplished if done
under experienced supervision.
By all means, correct the faults, but
don't give up the bonfire; it has be
come too big and too impressive a tra
dition to be discarded without at least
trying to correct its evils. I, for one,
had a lot of fun working on it, and
experienced a big thrill when it went
up in smoke, and I know I shall ex
perience as big a thrill every year
when I watch those flames lighting up
the very sky. And I won't have to be
stewed, either. Yours truly, >

The Editor, Sir:
Recently the "llull Session" has
been endeavoring to organize a crn
sade to bring about the abolition of
the Pig flame Bonfire. It has attempt
ed to point out the outstanding faults

of this "saturnalia," namely: that
there is excessive drinking both be
fore and during its burning; that it in
no way serves as an inspiration to the
team: that due to the yearly increase
in size, far more time and expense are
put on it than the freshmen can af
ford: that the freshmen resent the
forced labor which they are required
to expend in its building; and that
generally it is a most useless tradi
tion and should be abolished. Person
ally, while I admit that some of these
faults exist, I cannot see any reason
why they could not easily be removed.
In regard to the drinking. I believe
that in the minds of some men in this
University the bonfire has become
synoymous with New Year's Eve —a
time when everyone should get drunk.
I believe that several heavy penalties
imposed by Men's Council would eradi
cate that feature. As for the statement
by the "Bull Session" that no one in
his right mind would yell for two
hours if sober, I resent that, for I did,
and I know a good many others who
did also. And I believe our minds were
as whole as anyone's. As for the sec
ond point, I don't know just what ef
fect the bonfire has on the team, but.
I should think it would have a most
discouraging effect if it were abol
ished. Certainly the enthusiasm on the
campus before the bonfire is trans
ferred to some extent to the team, and
if the enthusiasm were reduced by its
abolition, the spirit of the team would
also suffer a reduction. I agree that at
present altogether too much of the
freshmen's time and money are spent
on the bonfire, but this is due chiefly,
I believe, to lack of competent man
agement and an endeavor to make
each bonfire larger than the last. By
putting the supervision of the con
struction in the hands of an experi
enced and efficient committee of up
perclassmen, by limiting the size of
the structures, and by lessening the
required amount of labor per man, T
think that this fault would be done
away with. Lastly, I feel very sure
that few freshmen resent working on
the bonfire —what they do resent is
doing sixteen hours of work. That IS
too much, but it could be cut in half
and just as much accomplished if done
under experienced supervision.
By all means, correct the faults, but
don't give up the bonfire; it has be
come too big and too impressive a tra
dition to be discarded without at least
trying to correct its evils. I, for one,
had a lot of fun working on it, and
experienced a big thrill when it went
up in smoke, and I know I shall ex
perience as big a thrill every year
when I watch those flames lighting up
the very sky. And I won't have to be
stewed, either. Yours truly, >

THE HONOR SYSTEM
is an Institution in this Univerisity.
1 Its existence and enforcement rest I
with every loyal Stanford Student.
All of us know of this highly laud
able sentiment which is so deeply im
! bedded in the fibre of our University. J
It has been proclaimed an institution
which will strengthen our characters
j by allowing our own reason and con-!
science to decide the truth of the
sfn'ement that "Honesty is the best
olicy." Speeches from various plat
•rms and essays from various publica

, tions have extolled its merits. Either
in approval or resignation students
i each quarter have signed the pledge.
It has indeed proven itself the strong
hold of the University.
Particularly in the rase of A Certain
1 Student has it proven its worth to
the University. Last spring quarter
A Certain Student took a certain
I course. This Student took every exam
ination, received his papers back with
grades on them, and proceeded on his
way. Before going home for the sum
mer. this Student, in cleaning his room
preparatory to abandoning it, dis
carded such papers as he was through
j with. A week after he had reached his
i home in the South, his grades arrived.
: Among them was an incomplete in
the above-mentioned course. Upon his
return to the University the succeed
ing fall quarter, the Student asked his
professor the reason for the incom
plete. The professor told him that the
; class record carried no grade for the
I student's second examination, which
counted twenty-five per cent of the
grade in the course. The student stated
j that the numerical grade on the exam
ination paper in question was sixty
five, and that on the class average
given out by the professor at the
time, the grade would have repre
j sented a C plus. The professor replied
readily enough that, man to man, he
believed the student, but that profes
sionally he could not accept the word
of the student, who was naturally as
much on his honor in reporting the
grade of the examination as he had
been in taking it. The reply of the
professor was that the honor system
could not be applied in such a case.
If one judges the student from a low
standard, certainly the professor was
correct in his stand. However, the
honor system ostensibly professes to
hold implicit faith in the moral back
bone of those under its regime. Is it
applicable only in the classroom,
where it would be well-nigh impossible
for the professor to stop cheating
without an organized police force?
Procters might be hired, but think of
the expense! Indeed, the honor sys-!
tem does fill a need, whether one is
idealistic-ally or mercenarily minded.
If the educated men of a university
cnnnot trust their own charges, how
can such a group in the majority favor
a League of Nations 7 The case cited
cannot be shrugged aside, for the stu
dent received the assurance of the
professor that his decision would be

THE HONOR SYSTEM
is an Institution in this Univerisity.
1 Its existence and enforcement rest I
with every loyal Stanford Student.
All of us know of this highly laud
able sentiment which is so deeply im
! bedded in the fibre of our University. J
It has been proclaimed an institution
which will strengthen our characters
j by allowing our own reason and con-!
science to decide the truth of the
sfn'ement that "Honesty is the best
olicy." Speeches from various plat
•rms and essays from various publica

, tions have extolled its merits. Either
in approval or resignation students
i each quarter have signed the pledge.
It has indeed proven itself the strong
hold of the University.
Particularly in the rase of A Certain
1 Student has it proven its worth to
the University. Last spring quarter
A Certain Student took a certain
I course. This Student took every exam
ination, received his papers back with
grades on them, and proceeded on his
way. Before going home for the sum
mer. this Student, in cleaning his room
preparatory to abandoning it, dis
carded such papers as he was through
j with. A week after he had reached his
i home in the South, his grades arrived.
: Among them was an incomplete in
the above-mentioned course. Upon his
return to the University the succeed
ing fall quarter, the Student asked his
professor the reason for the incom
plete. The professor told him that the
; class record carried no grade for the
I student's second examination, which
counted twenty-five per cent of the
grade in the course. The student stated
j that the numerical grade on the exam
ination paper in question was sixty
five, and that on the class average
given out by the professor at the
time, the grade would have repre
j sented a C plus. The professor replied
readily enough that, man to man, he
believed the student, but that profes
sionally he could not accept the word
of the student, who was naturally as
much on his honor in reporting the
grade of the examination as he had
been in taking it. The reply of the
professor was that the honor system
could not be applied in such a case.
If one judges the student from a low
standard, certainly the professor was
correct in his stand. However, the
honor system ostensibly professes to
hold implicit faith in the moral back
bone of those under its regime. Is it
applicable only in the classroom,
where it would be well-nigh impossible
for the professor to stop cheating
without an organized police force?
Procters might be hired, but think of
the expense! Indeed, the honor sys-!
tem does fill a need, whether one is
idealistic-ally or mercenarily minded.
If the educated men of a university
cnnnot trust their own charges, how
can such a group in the majority favor
a League of Nations 7 The case cited
cannot be shrugged aside, for the stu
dent received the assurance of the
professor that his decision would be
validated by the registrar.
For A Certain Student another bub-1

The Editor, Sir:
Recently the "llull Session" has
been endeavoring to organize a crn
sade to bring about the abolition of
the Pig flame Bonfire. It has attempt
ed to point out the outstanding faults

of this "saturnalia," namely: that
there is excessive drinking both be
fore and during its burning; that it in
no way serves as an inspiration to the
team: that due to the yearly increase
in size, far more time and expense are
put on it than the freshmen can af
ford: that the freshmen resent the
forced labor which they are required
to expend in its building; and that
generally it is a most useless tradi
tion and should be abolished. Person
ally, while I admit that some of these
faults exist, I cannot see any reason
why they could not easily be removed.
In regard to the drinking. I believe
that in the minds of some men in this
University the bonfire has become
synoymous with New Year's Eve —a
time when everyone should get drunk.
I believe that several heavy penalties
imposed by Men's Council would eradi
cate that feature. As for the statement
by the "Bull Session" that no one in
his right mind would yell for two
hours if sober, I resent that, for I did,
and I know a good many others who
did also. And I believe our minds were
as whole as anyone's. As for the sec
ond point, I don't know just what ef
fect the bonfire has on the team, but.
I should think it would have a most
discouraging effect if it were abol
ished. Certainly the enthusiasm on the
campus before the bonfire is trans
ferred to some extent to the team, and
if the enthusiasm were reduced by its
abolition, the spirit of the team would
also suffer a reduction. I agree that at
present altogether too much of the
freshmen's time and money are spent
on the bonfire, but this is due chiefly,
I believe, to lack of competent man
agement and an endeavor to make
each bonfire larger than the last. By
putting the supervision of the con
struction in the hands of an experi
enced and efficient committee of up
perclassmen, by limiting the size of
the structures, and by lessening the
required amount of labor per man, T
think that this fault would be done
away with. Lastly, I feel very sure
that few freshmen resent working on
the bonfire —what they do resent is
doing sixteen hours of work. That IS
too much, but it could be cut in half
and just as much accomplished if done
under experienced supervision.
By all means, correct the faults, but
don't give up the bonfire; it has be
come too big and too impressive a tra
dition to be discarded without at least
trying to correct its evils. I, for one,
had a lot of fun working on it, and
experienced a big thrill when it went
up in smoke, and I know I shall ex
perience as big a thrill every year
when I watch those flames lighting up
the very sky. And I won't have to be
stewed, either. Yours truly, >

on the bonfire, but this is due chiefly,
I believe, to lack of competent man
agement and an endeavor to make
each bonfire larger than the last. By
putting the supervision of the con
struction in the hands of an experi
enced and efficient committee of up
perclassmen, by limiting the size of
the structures, and by lessening the
required amount of labor per man, T
think that this fault would be done
away with. Lastly, I feel very sure
that few freshmen resent working on
the bonfire —what they do resent is
doing sixteen hours of work. That IS
too much, but it could be cut in half
and just as much accomplished if done
under experienced supervision.
By all means, correct the faults, but
don't give up the bonfire; it has be
come too big and too impressive a tra
dition to be discarded without at least
trying to correct its evils. I, for one,
had a lot of fun working on it, and
experienced a big thrill when it went
up in smoke, and I know I shall ex
perience as big a thrill every year
when I watch those flames lighting up
the very sky. And I won't have to be

THE HONOR SYSTEM
is an Institution in this Univerisity.
1 Its existence and enforcement rest I
with every loyal Stanford Student.
All of us know of this highly laud
able sentiment which is so deeply im
! bedded in the fibre of our University. J
It has been proclaimed an institution
which will strengthen our characters
j by allowing our own reason and con-!
science to decide the truth of the
sfn'ement that "Honesty is the best
olicy." Speeches from various plat
•rms and essays from various publica

, tions have extolled its merits. Either
in approval or resignation students
i each quarter have signed the pledge.
It has indeed proven itself the strong
hold of the University.
Particularly in the rase of A Certain
1 Student has it proven its worth to
the University. Last spring quarter
A Certain Student took a certain
I course. This Student took every exam
ination, received his papers back with
grades on them, and proceeded on his
way. Before going home for the sum
mer. this Student, in cleaning his room
preparatory to abandoning it, dis
carded such papers as he was through
j with. A week after he had reached his
i home in the South, his grades arrived.
: Among them was an incomplete in
the above-mentioned course. Upon his
return to the University the succeed
ing fall quarter, the Student asked his
professor the reason for the incom
plete. The professor told him that the
; class record carried no grade for the
I student's second examination, which
counted twenty-five per cent of the
grade in the course. The student stated
j that the numerical grade on the exam
ination paper in question was sixty
five, and that on the class average
given out by the professor at the
time, the grade would have repre
j sented a C plus. The professor replied
readily enough that, man to man, he
believed the student, but that profes
sionally he could not accept the word
of the student, who was naturally as
much on his honor in reporting the
grade of the examination as he had
been in taking it. The reply of the
professor was that the honor system
could not be applied in such a case.
If one judges the student from a low
standard, certainly the professor was
correct in his stand. However, the
honor system ostensibly professes to
hold implicit faith in the moral back
bone of those under its regime. Is it
applicable only in the classroom,
where it would be well-nigh impossible
for the professor to stop cheating
without an organized police force?
Procters might be hired, but think of
the expense! Indeed, the honor sys-!
tem does fill a need, whether one is
idealistic-ally or mercenarily minded.
If the educated men of a university
cnnnot trust their own charges, how
can such a group in the majority favor
a League of Nations 7 The case cited
cannot be shrugged aside, for the stu
dent received the assurance of the
professor that his decision would be
validated by the registrar.
For A Certain Student another bub-1

The Editor, Sir:
Recently the "llull Session" has
been endeavoring to organize a crn
sade to bring about the abolition of
the Pig flame Bonfire. It has attempt
ed to point out the outstanding faults

of this "saturnalia," namely: that
there is excessive drinking both be
fore and during its burning; that it in
no way serves as an inspiration to the
team: that due to the yearly increase
in size, far more time and expense are
put on it than the freshmen can af
ford: that the freshmen resent the
forced labor which they are required
to expend in its building; and that
generally it is a most useless tradi
tion and should be abolished. Person
ally, while I admit that some of these
faults exist, I cannot see any reason
why they could not easily be removed.
In regard to the drinking. I believe
that in the minds of some men in this
University the bonfire has become
synoymous with New Year's Eve —a
time when everyone should get drunk.
I believe that several heavy penalties
imposed by Men's Council would eradi
cate that feature. As for the statement
by the "Bull Session" that no one in
his right mind would yell for two
hours if sober, I resent that, for I did,
and I know a good many others who
did also. And I believe our minds were
as whole as anyone's. As for the sec
ond point, I don't know just what ef
fect the bonfire has on the team, but.
I should think it would have a most
discouraging effect if it were abol
ished. Certainly the enthusiasm on the
campus before the bonfire is trans
ferred to some extent to the team, and
if the enthusiasm were reduced by its
abolition, the spirit of the team would
also suffer a reduction. I agree that at
present altogether too much of the
freshmen's time and money are spent
on the bonfire, but this is due chiefly,
I believe, to lack of competent man
agement and an endeavor to make

ination paper in question was sixty
five, and that on the class average
given out by the professor at the
time, the grade would have repre
j sented a C plus. The professor replied
readily enough that, man to man, he
believed the student, but that profes
sionally he could not accept the word
of the student, who was naturally as
much on his honor in reporting the
grade of the examination as he had
been in taking it. The reply of the
professor was that the honor system
could not be applied in such a case.
If one judges the student from a low
standard, certainly the professor was
correct in his stand. However, the
honor system ostensibly professes to
hold implicit faith in the moral back
bone of those under its regime. Is it
applicable only in the classroom,
where it would be well-nigh impossible
for the professor to stop cheating
without an organized police force?
Procters might be hired, but think of
the expense! Indeed, the honor sys-!
tem does fill a need, whether one is
idealistic-ally or mercenarily minded.
If the educated men of a university
cnnnot trust their own charges, how
can such a group in the majority favor
a League of Nations 7 The case cited
cannot be shrugged aside, for the stu
dent received the assurance of the
professor that his decision would be
validated by the registrar.
For A Certain Student another bub-1
ble has been shattered.

The Editor, Sir:
Recently the "llull Session" has
been endeavoring to organize a crn
sade to bring about the abolition of
the Pig flame Bonfire. It has attempt
ed to point out the outstanding faults

of this "saturnalia," namely: that
there is excessive drinking both be
fore and during its burning; that it in
no way serves as an inspiration to the
team: that due to the yearly increase
in size, far more time and expense are
put on it than the freshmen can af
ford: that the freshmen resent the
forced labor which they are required
to expend in its building; and that
generally it is a most useless tradi
tion and should be abolished. Person
ally, while I admit that some of these
faults exist, I cannot see any reason
why they could not easily be removed.
In regard to the drinking. I believe
that in the minds of some men in this
University the bonfire has become
synoymous with New Year's Eve —a
time when everyone should get drunk.
I believe that several heavy penalties
imposed by Men's Council would eradi
cate that feature. As for the statement
by the "Bull Session" that no one in
his right mind would yell for two
hours if sober, I resent that, for I did,
and I know a good many others who
did also. And I believe our minds were
as whole as anyone's. As for the sec
ond point, I don't know just what ef
fect the bonfire has on the team, but.
I should think it would have a most
discouraging effect if it were abol
ished. Certainly the enthusiasm on the
campus before the bonfire is trans
ferred to some extent to the team, and
if the enthusiasm were reduced by its
abolition, the spirit of the team would
also suffer a reduction. I agree that at
present altogether too much of the
freshmen's time and money are spent
on the bonfire, but this is due chiefly,
I believe, to lack of competent man
agement and an endeavor to make
each bonfire larger than the last. By
putting the supervision of the con
struction in the hands of an experi
enced and efficient committee of up
perclassmen, by limiting the size of
the structures, and by lessening the
required amount of labor per man, T
think that this fault would be done
away with. Lastly, I feel very sure
that few freshmen resent working on
the bonfire —what they do resent is
doing sixteen hours of work. That IS
too much, but it could be cut in half
and just as much accomplished if done
under experienced supervision.
By all means, correct the faults, but
don't give up the bonfire; it has be
come too big and too impressive a tra
dition to be discarded without at least
trying to correct its evils. I, for one,
had a lot of fun working on it, and
experienced a big thrill when it went
up in smoke, and I know I shall ex
perience as big a thrill every year
when I watch those flames lighting up
the very sky. And I won't have to be
stewed, either. Yours truly, >
S. F. Dutton, '30.
