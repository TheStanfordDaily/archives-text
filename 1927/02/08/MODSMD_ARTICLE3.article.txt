# FRESHMEN PREPARING FOR SEASON'S CLIMAX IN CALIFORNIA GAMES
## Coaches Express Surprise At Showing Against Teachers' Quintet 
### 
With both games of last week suc
cessfully put on the shelf. Coach
Husky* Hunt and his freshman basket
ball players are preparing for the
games that climax the freshman bas
ketball season, the California fresh
man cage series. The first contest is
scheduled with the Hear yearlings Fri
day night at Berkeley.
The Cardinal beginners surprised
both Coaches Hunt and Mitchell by
the showing they made Saturday night
against the strong Santa Barbara
State Teachers quintet. A new com
bination was used at that time which
went the best that any other floor
squad has gone so far this weason.
Bush played forward with Berg, Roth
ert was tried out at center, and Simp
kins and Albertson were the guards.
Albertson will probably give his berth
to Thompson, who returned yesterday
and worked out with the team.
Try Different Combinations
In the meantime several other pos
sible combinations are being tried out
with the idea of giving the California
beginners plenty of variety when they
meet Stanford's freshmen. Dowling
and Garibotto make a good pair at the
forward position and play an entirely
different style of game from that of
the Berg-Bush combination. Stewart is
also going well at forward and will
probably see action in the California
contests.
In guard material, Coach Hunt has
Steinbeck, Smith, Albertson, and
Mann. These boys have been trying
hard and improving lately. The only
thing they lack is experience in both
defensive and offensive guarding.
Hare, McDowell, May, Story, Russell,
Lasley, and Rawlins compose the re
maining members of the present
squad.
Plenty of scrimmage and floor drills
will be given the Babes by the
coaches to round them into an aggre
gation that will be able to hold its
own with the California freshmen.
Much depends on how the squad for
mulates its playing policy during the
next three days, but hopes of both
the coaches and those interested have
risen since the last two games. It
seems as though the freshmen have
set their pace.
