Golf balls don't always go where!
they are meant to go, as any one who j
has played the "ancient and horrible ;
pastime" knows very well. But the fol- i
lowing are a few incidents, chosen at i
random, to show into what strange j
and unusual places the little pellets
will stray, in a game where "anything
can happen."
A Mrs. Blackford, of Indiana, was j
forced to climb a tree, after her ap
proach shot landed in a nest among
the branches. (No, she did not get a
birdie.) Bobby Jones once experienced
a "sole-stirring" event when his iron
shot sent the ball into an old shoe
resting on a pile of trash on a wheel
barrow. Bobby socked the shoe onto
the nearby green and the ball luckily ;
fell out.
King George's drive, which bounded
into the ear of a peaceful cow, has its
counterparts in a shot by a Mr. M'Evoy j
of the Middleton Club of Cork, Ireland, I
which went into the ear of a donkey, j
and another one at Duddingston, Eng.,
that became embedded on the back of j
a sheep. Dave Shade once wrote me j
how he drove a golf ball about 175
yards and into a hollow tree, the I
ephere finally coming to rest in a!
spider's web about six inches off the :

ground. Jerry Travers, who lost a
course record at Fox Hills in the semi
final round of a Methoroplitan cham
pionship because his ball rolled inside
a large milk bottle, can seek solace
from Bryce Evans, a famous left
hander, who topped his second shot
into a two-quart milk can at the Coun
try Club, Brookline, Mass. Evans wal
loped that milk can eight times before
the ball rolled out.
Some other curious and extraordi
nary resting places for golf balls that
were hit in actual play are as follows:
At the Royal and Ancient medal
meeting in 1907, a member's drive
landed and stuck on the sharp point
of a hat pin in the hat of a woman
crossing the course. Harry Bates, play
ing at the Briarcliff course, sent a
mashie shot into the drinking fountain
just above the eighth green. Norman
Chapman sank a spanking tee shot
into his caddy's hip pocket in 1925,
while Aubrey Boomer, a former
French champion, once "skied" a ball
so that it landed in his coat pocket!
At Neasden, England, a ball went into
a hollow papier mache cylinder that
was used as a flag on top of the pin
at one hole, while at another foreign
course, a golfer sent his tee shot into
a pillow slip hanging on a clothes line!
