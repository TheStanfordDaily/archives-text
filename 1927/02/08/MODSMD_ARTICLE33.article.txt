# DUGAN REPORTS FIRE DEPARTMENT BUSIEST IN SUMMER MONTHS
## By Virginia Voorheis

"Summer on the Stanford campus is j
the busiest time of year for the Stan
ford Fire Department," says Fire
Chief Dugan. "All the 3000-odd smok
ers living on the campus during the J
regular session cannot compete with !
dry fields in summer for the number |
of times they call out the hre depart- j
ment."
"The prize incendiary of my experi- |
enee," went on Chief Dugan. "was a '
broken bottle, several years ago. lying '
in a field of dry grass. The glass j
caught and focused the sun's rays, j
and started a field firo that spread a j
square block before it could be ex
tinguished."
Before the cigarette become so Ã¼bi
quitous, field fires did not make so
many demands on the Stanford fire !
department. In those days the hand-1
drawn apparatus which composed the
equipment was, if not notable for j
speed, at least adequate for campus
needs. It would be hard to imagine i
man-propelled apparatus effectively
handling a field fire of the usual
present-day dimensions and frpquency. j
An alarm coming in to the Stanford
fire department immediately makes j
sixteen men subject to service. Ten !
men form the regular force, and six !
members of the R.O.T.C. are trained I
in the handling of the apparatus. Dur- i
ing the day the regular force is em- j
ployed in various work around the i
campus, within ear-shot of an alarm. :
At night there are five men on con
tinual duty at the fire house.
The rules and discipline are the
same as obtain in the San Francisco
fire department, where Chief Dugan
served before coming here four years j
ago.
