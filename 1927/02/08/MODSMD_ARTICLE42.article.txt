# REGISTRAR EXPLAINS NEW REGULATION FOR ADMISSION IN SPRING
## 
### 
Explaining the stand of the admission
committee in its decision to refuse ad
mission to new regular Lower Division
students at the beginning of each spring
quarter, Dr. Karl M. Cowdery, ass.istant
registrar, said yesterday that the basis
is, "Every year there were a lot of for
eign and special Lower Division appli
cants whose credentials could not be
compared directly with those of regular
Lower Division applicants."
Consequently the committee thought it
necessary, Cowdery explained, to to set
aside a certain number of places for these
foreign and special students who could
not accurately be compared. As Lower

| Division entrants are limited to 450 in
i the autumn, and 50 in each of the other
; three quarters, or 6Â«t) in all, this was
' accomplished by setting aside 50 places
j for foreign and special students to be
i given out during the year separate from
| those for regular applicants and by
| eliminating the 50 places open for the
i spring quarter.
In this way the total is the same, but
I unfairness in choosing between foreign
and regular applicants is prevented. The
; spring quarter was chosen because it is
, "a hard quarter for beginning students
| anyway," beginning courses not being
j given in several important departments.
The new rule may be found in the 1927
I "Information" recently issued by the
! university.
