In the first evening game, Encina
2W lost their last chance to tie for

eight points, all close shots, while
Clover and Todd kept the freshmen
hack. For Ihe losers. Fishbeck and

lings' play.

ing by two points at the half, Encina
Basement kept exactly the same
amount back of the fraternity until
twenty seconds before the game ended.
Stewart, freshman center; sank one
basket to tie the score and another a
moment later to take the lead. Osmon
son, however, a K.A. substitute, came
to the rescue with a field goal to tie
the score again.
In the extra period, Fernstrom put
the freshmen ahead with a field goal,
but Davidson tied the score once more.
A minute later, Davidson gave the
K A.'s a one-point lead by a foul,

tional shot that did not even touch
the hoop, winning the game 18 to 17
for Encina.
The last contest was a walk-away
for Phi Kappa Sigma, who won 27 to
12 ovor El Tigre. The 112 ame was hard
fought and fast, replete with many
falls and tumbles. A great many fouls
were called on both sides, but only El
Tigre could make good. Saunders and

the winners, with Edmonds and Evans
also playing a good game. On the El
Tigre team, Mitchell did most of the
scoring, making one field goal and
four out of nine fouls.

Evening Games
In the first evening game, Encina
2W lost their last chance to tie for
i league honors by losing to Sigma Nu
j 14 to 7. The game was an argument
between the advantages of using a
dribbling or a passing attack, with the
latter proving more successful.
Ren*el, tall Sigma Nu center, scored
eight points, all close shots, while
Clover and Todd kept the freshmen
hack. For Ihe losers. Fishbeck and
Crowson shared the honors in the
scoring, while Allendorf's dribbling
and the guarding of Lewis and Hayden
were the strong features of the year
lings' play.
With the Kappa Alpha quintet lead
ing by two points at the half, Encina
Basement kept exactly the same
amount back of the fraternity until
twenty seconds before the game ended.
Stewart, freshman center; sank one
basket to tie the score and another a
moment later to take the lead. Osmon
son, however, a K.A. substitute, came
to the rescue with a field goal to tie
the score again.
In the extra period, Fernstrom put
the freshmen ahead with a field goal,
but Davidson tied the score once more.
A minute later, Davidson gave the
K A.'s a one-point lead by a foul,
which lasted until just before time,
when Stewart dropped a long sensa
tional shot that did not even touch
the hoop, winning the game 18 to 17
for Encina.
The last contest was a walk-away
for Phi Kappa Sigma, who won 27 to
12 ovor El Tigre. The 112 ame was hard
fought and fast, replete with many
falls and tumbles. A great many fouls
were called on both sides, but only El
Tigre could make good. Saunders and
McCulloch were outstanding men for
the winners, with Edmonds and Evans
also playing a good game. On the El
Tigre team, Mitchell did most of the
scoring, making one field goal and
four out of nine fouls.
