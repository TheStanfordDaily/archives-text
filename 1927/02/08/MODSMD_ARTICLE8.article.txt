"Vote no 011 the proposed constitutional
amendment to revive weight; basketball,"
asks Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head of the
Mene's Physical Education Department.
His request is based on the injurious
physical effects he claims result from
this sport.
A hard practice after a big meal is
decidedly injurious, Dr. Storey says, and,
as in weight basketball the participants
always have to practice in the evenings
after dinner, it is harmful to them. This
is brought about because the basketball
courts are full in the afternoons with
intramural players and classes.
Intramural basketball could perhaps be
cut down but since it accommodates prob
ably four or five times as many men as
weight basketball, the suggestion is not
feasible. There seems to be no immedi
ate hope of enlargement of the courts,
moreover, to alleviate present difficulties.
