# HUNT STRESSES SCORING POWER IN EASY DRILL
## State Teachers College Five Reported to Be Fast FRESNO CONTEST NEXT California Quintet Presents Powerful Defense 
### Fred Speers 
To guard against the possibility of
any of the members of the varsity
basketball squad going "stale" at this
stage of the season with the California
series not so far away now, Coach
Husky Hunt gave his men only a light
drill practice last night. The series of
scrimmage games, used last week to
prepare for Southern California, was
dispensed with fbr the time being.
Drill in basket-shooting was espe
cially emphasized though attention
was paid to light passing work. When
Stanford meets California the Cardi
nals will meet a strong defensive team
and the greater percentage of success
ful tries at the basket that the Red
shirts can make the greater, of course,
will be their chances to win the Bruin
series.
Fresno Saturday
One hurdle yet remains to be cleared
before Stanford will be ready for Cali
fornia and that is the game with
Fresno State next Saturday night in
the pavilion. Fresno is represented by
a good team this year and Hunt is
pointing his men for this game before
concentrating on California.
A compilation of individual scoring
shows that Wes Bryant, Cardinal for
ward, leads his teammates in total
number of points scored during the
regular season. A table of comparative
scores such as this fails entirely to
indicate the teamwork of a quintet
and. in many cases, the relative scor
ing ability of the individual men (be
cause, for example, in positions and
in difference of number of games
played).

To guard against the possibility of
any of the members of the varsity
basketball squad going "stale" at this
stage of the season with the California
series not so far away now, Coach
Husky Hunt gave his men only a light
drill practice last night. The series of
scrimmage games, used last week to
prepare for Southern California, was
dispensed with fbr the time being.
Drill in basket-shooting was espe
cially emphasized though attention
was paid to light passing work. When
Stanford meets California the Cardi
nals will meet a strong defensive team
and the greater percentage of success
ful tries at the basket that the Red
shirts can make the greater, of course,
will be their chances to win the Bruin
series.
Fresno Saturday
One hurdle yet remains to be cleared
before Stanford will be ready for Cali
fornia and that is the game with
Fresno State next Saturday night in
the pavilion. Fresno is represented by
a good team this year and Hunt is
pointing his men for this game before
concentrating on California.
A compilation of individual scoring
shows that Wes Bryant, Cardinal for
ward, leads his teammates in total
number of points scored during the
regular season. A table of comparative
scores such as this fails entirely to
indicate the teamwork of a quintet
and. in many cases, the relative scor
ing ability of the individual men (be
cause, for example, in positions and
in difference of number of games
played).
