# PENINSULA CONCERT SERIES OPENS WITH RECITAL BY MEISLE
## Artist Previously Appeared In Coast Presentation Of "The Messiah" 
### 
Kathryn Meisle, contralto, of the
Chicago Civic Opera Company, will
open the musical season for 1927 on
the campus when she appears tomor
row night in the third concert of the
Peninsula Musical Association series
in the Assembly Hall.
The concept breaks the long inter
val in artist recitals that has con
tinued since the appearance here last
December of Albert Spalding under
the auspices of the association.
Miss Meisle is noted for her fine
contralto voice, which gained for her
favorable reviews from Chicago critics
on her musical debut.
The artist's appearance here is on
her fourth trip to the Pacific Coast
this season. Previously she has sung
in concerts and operas in Los Angeles
and San Francisco, including the San
Francisco presentation of "The Mes
siah."
Among the numbers which Miss
Meisle plans to sing tomorrow are
several selections by Schubert, a num
ber by Brahms, and works of modern
Russian composers, notably Rachman
inoff. In addition she will sing the aria
"Mon Fils" from the opera "Le Pro
phete."
Tickets for the concert may be ob
tained at Crandall's in Palo Alto or
at the box office on the night of the
recital at the usual prices.
