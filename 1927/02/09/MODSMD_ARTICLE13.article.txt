# Professor Starr Lauds Calles As Great President
## 
### 
"I believe that iu the future people !
I
will recognize Calles as a great ruler,"
said Professor Frederick Starr last
night at the Tuesday evening lecture. j
"He has carried out the policy that
the first man to be considered is the
Mexican laborer; he is sponsoring the j
hopeful revival of the Indian in Mexi- j
can life: his administration has been
built on the foundations Carranza laid,
but with a new election looming lie has ,
his hands full with four big problems, i
I hope he'll hold his own."
The four problems to which Profes
sor Starr referred concern the Land j
Law, which provides that owners are
to be treated like any Mexican citizen
and cannot ask for "protection" from '
their governments; the Oil Laws,
which will limit leases to fifty years; ,
the present religious difficulties; and
the Nicaragua situation.
New Legislative Bill
Another matter that will bear watch
ing, according to Professor Starr, is j
the bill now going through the Mexi
can legislature to permit a presiden- 1
tial re-election after one term will
have intervened. This, he pointed out,
will let Obregon return for another
term and so enable Calles to have his
policies carried out during the next
administration. "Although," said the j
speaker, "Obregon will make as good
a second-term president as any such
officer I have known."
Professor Starr drew a parallel be- i
tween the revolution of ISIO-1821, i
which gave Mexico her independence,!
and the revolution of 1910-1921 which i
set modern Mexico free "after Diaz j
had had her in the palm of his hand
for nearly forty years." He followed j
the succession of Mexican presidents j
with personal comments and sidelights j
on their various terms in office.
Madera Narrow
"Madera. (Diaz's immediate succes-j
sor) was very narrow but very much ]
in earnest. Two people were inter- i
ested in circumstances resulting from j
his death: one was President Wilson,!
