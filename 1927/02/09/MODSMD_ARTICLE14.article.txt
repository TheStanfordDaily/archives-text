j gate the efEicacy of the present wo
j men's athletic training rules, at the
i business meeting of W.A.A. Board
members last night. There being less
j than a quorum of members present,
j I he meeting was constituted a business
I session, with its decisions subject to

exceptions allowed, and state that all
players must be in bed by 10 o'clock
the night preceding either a regular

forbid any eating within two hours

revised for the next college year.

who is ill.
Other decisions made at the meeting
concerning installations of officers, a
! change in the star award, and a new
I training rule forbidding smoking, will
j not become effective unless approved
at a regular session of the Board.
