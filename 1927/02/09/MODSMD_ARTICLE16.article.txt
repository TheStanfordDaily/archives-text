# STUDENTS WILL HEAR ITALIAN ORGANIST AT ASSEMBLY TOMORROW
## Pietro Yon Combines Talent Of Musician, Scholar In Compositions 
### 
In Pietro Yon, the organist who will
| play in the Memorial Church for a
student assembly at 11 o'clock Thurs- \
day morning, Stanford and Palo Alto !
1 people will have the opportunity toj
hear the only outstanding organist of
j the Italian school in the United States.
"Mr. Yon is not only representative
j of the Italian school," says Warren D. i
! Allen, Stanford University organist,
"but he combines the typical elements
; of Italian musical scholarship, uniting
| trained scholarship with grace and
j humor and a high appreciation of dra-1
matic values. His program Thursday \
exhibits all of these features, present-;
ing the scholarly attributes of Italian
musicianship together with the dra- j
matic and entertaining elements which
; are components of that scholarship."
A source of interest in the Thursday I
prog-am is the fact that at least two
of his own compositions which he will
i render are well known and have been
i heard many times on the Memorial;
Church organ, and these two bring out |
i characteristics of Mr. Yon's method j
!as a composer. His "Sonata Roman- j
tica" is a presentation of a happy
j mood throughout three brilliant move-
I ments, and his "Organ Primitivo" is a
, humorous elaboration of the music of
j the little old organ of the 11th and
j 12th centui-ies.
The second number on the program
j Thursday is an arrangement for the j
: organ by J. C. Ungerer of a French)
j children's song, "Frere Jaques! Dor-j
mez-vous?" with which many Ameri-'
! cans are familiar from their own |
j school days.
j The last number on the program, a
I Toccata by R. Renzi, gains interest i
;
. from the fact that this brilliant and
distinctive composition was written by j
the man who was Yon's organ teacher
in Rome, where Renzi is titular or- [
ganist of St. Peter's.
