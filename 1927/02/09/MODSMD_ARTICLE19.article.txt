# FAILURE TO PROVIDE BALLOTS NECESSITATES CLASS REVOTE
## Special Election Called to Fill Sophomore, Junior Executive Offices TWO AMENDMENTS PASS Graham, Wool Poll Largest Number of Votes for Men's Council 
### 
Due to the fact that the Election
j Board failed to provide sufficient bal
| lots for both the junior and sophomore
I class tickets, a re-vote will be taken
at a special election to be held next
| Tuesday. As no candidate received a
majority of the votes cast for either
] president or vice-president of the sen
i ior class, these offices will also be
filled at this election.
Ken Graham and Fred Wool were
| elected to Men's Council by a plurality
i vote over their nearest competitors.
; William S. (Mickey) Hobro won over
Dick Hyland for the Board of Athletic
j Control by a decisive majority. The
! A.S.S.U. secretaryship went to Louis
Vincenti. Chris Freemau is the, new
j junior representative on the Execu
j tive Committee, while Theo Harder
was elected sophomore representative.
Tack Harolyn and Bert Carr had no
| opposition for the Union Board of
! Governors.
Amendments Pass

passed by an overwhelming vote, par-
S ticularly the one concerning the Circle
S award.

group to elect all its officers, Edward
j Dillon winning the race for president
I by a majority of one vote only. Helen
Thompson and Robert M. Cla. ke were
I elected vice-president and treasurer,
j respectively. Catherine Coman had no
i opposition for secretary.

vote for president and vice-president,
I although Don Fritts was elected treas
urer by a large majority. Helen
Cooper was chosen secretary on a
white ballot.
Senior Deadlock
Under the provisions of Section 2,
Article XVI. of the A.S.S.U. By-Laws,
Phil Brooks and George Bogue are
I the candidates who will be voted upon
! for 1927 class president next Tuesday,
I while Bob Mclnnes and Margaret Mc
| Omie will compete against each other
for vice-president. All officers of both
the junior and sophomore classes will

vote being unexpectedly heavy.

who would not recognize de la Huerta,
<he old drunken Indian who came into
jiower after Madera's murder, and
who finally forced de la Huerta to
resign; the other person was Carranza,
who would not have succeeded in be
coming president if Wilson had not
meddled with Huerta.
"I admired Carranza; he was a great
man. He did more to make the world
respect the Mexican republic than any
pt' his predecessors.
Obregon Praised
"When Obregon was elected to the
presidency he made a splendid official
i —he was one of the great men of the
present time. His statement that
"Mexico was through with a policy of
«ift, graft, and surrender' was admir
able. He was the first president who
was elected at the proper time, served
a full term, and gave his office over
to his successor without violence,
■which is indeed remarkable.
"When de la Huerta came into of
fice, in accordance with the plans of
the political managers, the factions
Which were against him finally led to
Oalles' election. De la Huerta is now
in Los Angeles working underground
like a mole, biding his time, and is as
treacherous as his method of work
might indicate."
