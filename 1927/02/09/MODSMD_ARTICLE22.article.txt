The editorial page of the college newspaper has been criticizcd for
being weak and purposeless, and the reason given for this fault is that
the paper seems to have no chart by which to steer its course. The
explanation may be found in the fact that those who control the page
change from year to year as college editors graduate. The page drifts
first one way and then another on an uncharted sea.
Some sort of a compass is needed for the editorial page of a Univer
sity's newspaper. The Stanford Daily is attempting to correct this
trouble bv an editorial board which plans the program for the year, and
discusses questions of policy as they arise. Therefore it is not a single
man dictating the policy of the paper, but a board soberly discussing the
important questions. On the editorial board is always found the man who
will become the next editor.
Today, a new editor is taking charge of the Daily, but the policy
of the paper will be only slightly changed. The program followed during
the last quarter was planned by the editorial board, and it will therefore
continue. The mistakes that were made since October are shared by the
entire board, as is the credit that is due—if any.
James Melvin Lee, executive secretary of the Intercollegiate News
paper Association, rightly says of the college newspaper, "The news
paper published in any American university is a fair criterion by which
to judge that institution." A parent who is careful in the selection of a
college for a son or daughter often gives more weight to the information
obtained from the paper than lie does to the information contained in
the official catalogue. The college newspaper is the best mirror of under
graduate life.
A college editor should realize this fact. He should feel that he is
representing his university to the outside world. Responsibility is a good
thing, and this is especially true in the newspaper field.
Without making too many New Term resolutions, The Stanford
Daily in the future will attempt to represent Stanford to the world (at
least the collegiate world) in a creditable manner, and will also attempt
to present the campus with all the news, written in an accurate and
unbiased style.
