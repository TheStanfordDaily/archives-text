# Stepping Up
## 
### 
With the changing editorship of the Daily, the titles of four staff
members are shifted in this morning's issue. In the common vernacular,
these students have received promotions, and technically this is correct.
But actually, they have merely stepped up a peg.from their old positions.
Barbara Dewlaney succeeds Aileen Brown to the position of women's
editor, Fred Speers is managing editor, and Stephen O'Donnell will
take over the associate editorship. To add to these appointments, Lynn
Bramkamp is promoted from copy editor to night editor. The three men
and the one woman have succeeded both because of their diligence and
their natural ability. They are all good newspaper men, with one
exception, and she is a good newspaper woman.
Other names are missing from the masthead of this morning's paper.
Harry Bennett, Dudley Ross, Alfred Post, Aileen Brown, and Ruth
Jordan have left to make room for others. Under Bennett and his
assistants the Daily has gone ahead by leaps and bounds, and the retire
ment of these students is bound to be felt.
