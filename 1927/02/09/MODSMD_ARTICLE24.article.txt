Harold Lloyd has always understood ,
the principle that audiences like to
see the young man with an overde- \
veloped inferiority complex rise up
during the course of a picture and
justly smite his enemies. Nowhere
does he make more effective use of i
his knowledge of this weakness of I
audiences than in his latest release,
"The Kid Brother," now playing at
the New Stanford theatre.
"The Kid Brother" consists for the
most part of an effective pictorial
representation of the element of the
chase with all the known variations
■with Harold, the youngest son and
drudge of the hard-boiled Hickory fam
ily, leading the big parade through a
great many feet of the film. Ho is !
followed at different times by his (
brothers, his father, the village bully,

and a piratical looking fellow who
steals a wallet of money at some time
during the action.
While the spirit of the chase is the
theme of most comedies produced
since Charles Chaplin first strutted
before a movie camera, in this picture
the inventive Mr. Lloyd introduces
new variations in the shape of in
genious ruses to ensnare his pursuers;
devices effective in convulsing the
members of the audience.
Fortunately for the well-being of the
playhouse customers who desire a
satisfactory ending the hero is caught
toward the end of the comedy by the
wild-eyed felon mentioned previously.
There ensues a scrap damaging to
both parties, but more so to the crimi
nal clement. The wallet is recovered
in spite of Harold's imbecility, the
family honor of the Hickorys is saved,
and the customary kiss is planted on
the delectable Jobyna Ralston.
