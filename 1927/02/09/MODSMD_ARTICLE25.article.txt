Since someone else has already re- 1
opened the discussion, let us talk
about that honor system again. And
let us begin by being fair to the honor
system, at least to this extent. Let us j
admit that any system that purports '
to perform the function that is now 1
performed—after a fashion —by the 1
honor system, has undertaken a very
difficult task indeed. It is no wonder
that the present system occasionally
bungles a case.
Naturally enough there is a great '
deal of dissatisfaction arising from the !
manner in which the honor system
works. The men who protested in yes
terday's Daily apparently had a legiti- I
mate complaint, if they represented
their case accurately. But, like most of ;
those who register a complaint against 1
the honor system, they made the per- j
fectly natural mistake of assuming
that the honor system is all that its
name implies, nothing more and noth
ing less.
A grave error was made when the
originators of the honor system named
it the honor system, and stopped there. '
As it stands now, the name of the sys-,

1 tem implies that Stanford men and
women are left to their own honor in
all those matters specifically men
tioned in the student body constitu
tion, which says in so many words,
1 "Honesty in examinations is not the
1 only end the system is intended to
1 achieve. It extends to student conduct
1 at all times and places, covers drink
, ing, gambling, and* all kinds of dis
honesty, and it is intended to put an
; end to every undesirable practice on
! the campus."
So all those matters are to be left
! to honor? Ah, yes, but what is honor?
; Here is the constitution's definition of
! honor: "To every student is delegated
I the responsibility for the actions of
his classmates." There is the crux of
the whole situation. It is not a matter
of individual honor at all. It is simply
| a system based upon the theory that
all men are honest when someone is
looking at them.
It should have been termed "The
j Honor System With Appropriate Pro
vision For Those Frequent Contingen
[ cies When Some Substitute Is Neces
sary To Supplement The Available
i Supply Of Honor."

let us begin by being fair to the honor
system, at least to this extent. Let us j
admit that any system that purports '
to perform the function that is now 1
performed—after a fashion —by the 1
honor system, has undertaken a very
difficult task indeed. It is no wonder
that the present system occasionally
bungles a case.
Naturally enough there is a great '
deal of dissatisfaction arising from the !
manner in which the honor system
works. The men who protested in yes
terday's Daily apparently had a legiti- I
mate complaint, if they represented
their case accurately. But, like most of ;
those who register a complaint against 1
the honor system, they made the per- j
fectly natural mistake of assuming
that the honor system is all that its
name implies, nothing more and noth
ing less.
A grave error was made when the
originators of the honor system named
it the honor system, and stopped there. '
As it stands now, the name of the sys-,

1 tem implies that Stanford men and
women are left to their own honor in
all those matters specifically men
tioned in the student body constitu
tion, which says in so many words,
1 "Honesty in examinations is not the
1 only end the system is intended to
1 achieve. It extends to student conduct
1 at all times and places, covers drink
, ing, gambling, and* all kinds of dis
honesty, and it is intended to put an
; end to every undesirable practice on
! the campus."
So all those matters are to be left
! to honor? Ah, yes, but what is honor?
; Here is the constitution's definition of
! honor: "To every student is delegated
I the responsibility for the actions of
his classmates." There is the crux of
the whole situation. It is not a matter
of individual honor at all. It is simply
| a system based upon the theory that
all men are honest when someone is
looking at them.
It should have been termed "The
j Honor System With Appropriate Pro
vision For Those Frequent Contingen
[ cies When Some Substitute Is Neces
sary To Supplement The Available
i Supply Of Honor."
