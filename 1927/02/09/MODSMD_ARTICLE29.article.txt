# SLONAKER TO TRY PROTEIN FOODS IN ALBINO RAT TESTS
## 
### 
Albino rats will be used by Profes
! sor James R. Slonaker of the Physi
ology Department in his experiments
! to find out the true effects of various
1 amounts of protein on an animal. The
correct amount needed to accomplish
; normal growth, reproduction, effi
| ciency, and a long span pf life will
also be considered.
The experiment will last over a
period of three years, the average life
! span of the rats. They will be divided
into groups. One will be given a larger
; amount of protein than is necessary
and each of the others diminishing
I quantities.
|
It is hoped that this experiment will
i show whether or not a correct amount
i of protein will prolong the average life
I span. These results may be applied to
; man, as well as to the rats, as the
same physiological laws apply to both.
The American Livestock and Meat
J Board has become interested in the
experiment to the extent of giving
i financial aid for its continuation.
