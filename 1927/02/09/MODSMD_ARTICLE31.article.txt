## Wealth of Material on Hand Gives Coach Templeton Powerful Team 
### Joe Carroll 
As the weather grows slightly
warmer, Coach "Dink" Templeton
watches his trackmen going through
their paces with a rather pleased
smile upon his face. For the Stanford
track team shows great potential
strength this early in the season, and
as the men get limbered up they per
form more and more according to the
coach's expectations.
The results of impromptu track
meets held on past Fridays have
shown that the Stanford coach has a
right to expect his men to do a great
deal against stiff competition this year.
The development that has been shown
not only by men from last year's fresh
man team, but also by members of
the 1926 varsity, has been very en
couraging and heartening to Temple
ton.
Richman Fast
Fred Richman has been winning
both the 100- and 220-yard dashes with
regularity. He possesses a very long
and powerful stride that carries him
easily through the 220 and he is ex
pected to shade 22 seconds in this
event. Fred Zombro is pushing him,
especially in the 100.
Templeton has a wealth of material
on hand for the 440. He has almost
too many quarter-milers, with' Captain
Babcock, Spencer. Dales, McGuire,
Syer, and others. He has already
shifted Tom Moss, a sophomore, into
the half, where he and Alex McKin
non, another sophomore, seem to have
the edge over Carlsmith, of last year's
rarsity.
Swain and Ranney are showing up
well in the mile. Criley, Briggs, and
Aiken are running the two-mile in good
shape.
Hurdlers Good
Clarence West and Ross Nichols
will give all opposition a stiff run for
their money in the hurdles. West
placed in both the highs and the lows
at the 1.C.4A. last. year, while Nichols
was out with a broken arm. Nichols
has been showing plenty of stuff in
practice, however, beating West sev
eral times.
Biff Hoffman should be at his best j
■this year in shot and discus. Taffy
Evans will help him out in the discus, j
as will Way, Forster, Fleishacker, and
Helmke. The latter four are counted
on also in the shotput.
High Jump Strong
Bob King and Tom Work, both capa
ble of over 6 feet 4 inches, will take
care of the high jump against all
comers.
Zombro, Sid Meeks, Dyer, Lauritzen,
ar.d Ar.dorson are all doing well in the
broad jump. Ward Edmonds, Walt
Hulsman, and George Fontaine are
working out for the pole vault.
Tom Joaquin has thrown the javelin
390 feet. With Goodcell and Shipkey
also in this event. Stanford should
make some points here.

not only by men from last year's fresh
man team, but also by members of
the 1926 varsity, has been very en
couraging and heartening to Temple
ton.
Richman Fast
Fred Richman has been winning
both the 100- and 220-yard dashes with
regularity. He possesses a very long
and powerful stride that carries him
easily through the 220 and he is ex
pected to shade 22 seconds in this
event. Fred Zombro is pushing him,
especially in the 100.
Templeton has a wealth of material
on hand for the 440. He has almost
too many quarter-milers, with' Captain
Babcock, Spencer. Dales, McGuire,
Syer, and others. He has already
shifted Tom Moss, a sophomore, into
the half, where he and Alex McKin
non, another sophomore, seem to have
the edge over Carlsmith, of last year's
rarsity.
Swain and Ranney are showing up
well in the mile. Criley, Briggs, and
Aiken are running the two-mile in good
shape.
Hurdlers Good
Clarence West and Ross Nichols
will give all opposition a stiff run for
their money in the hurdles. West
placed in both the highs and the lows
at the 1.C.4A. last. year, while Nichols
was out with a broken arm. Nichols
has been showing plenty of stuff in
practice, however, beating West sev
eral times.
Biff Hoffman should be at his best j
■this year in shot and discus. Taffy
Evans will help him out in the discus, j
as will Way, Forster, Fleishacker, and
Helmke. The latter four are counted
on also in the shotput.
High Jump Strong
Bob King and Tom Work, both capa
ble of over 6 feet 4 inches, will take
care of the high jump against all
comers.
Zombro, Sid Meeks, Dyer, Lauritzen,
ar.d Ar.dorson are all doing well in the
broad jump. Ward Edmonds, Walt
Hulsman, and George Fontaine are
working out for the pole vault.
Tom Joaquin has thrown the javelin
390 feet. With Goodcell and Shipkey
also in this event. Stanford should
make some points here.
As the weather grows slightly
warmer, Coach "Dink" Templeton
watches his trackmen going through
their paces with a rather pleased
smile upon his face. For the Stanford
track team shows great potential
strength this early in the season, and
as the men get limbered up they per
form more and more according to the
coach's expectations.
The results of impromptu track
meets held on past Fridays have
shown that the Stanford coach has a
right to expect his men to do a great
deal against stiff competition this year.
The development that has been shown
not only by men from last year's fresh
man team, but also by members of
the 1926 varsity, has been very en
