# SPORTS OF 1927
## A 						Star in Two Sports 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
This is Russell Daugherity, captain
of the Illinois basketball team, and
star footballer as well, who is at pres
ent burning up the courts of the West
ern Conference as a hard-driving for
ward on Coach Ruby's team. Last sea
son, handicapped by illness, as he
was, "Pug" was able to score 62
points in twelve "Big Ten" games, and
this year he should do much better,
even though Illinois started the cam
paign witli a green team.
Folks who follow the fortunes of
the Illini on the various athletic fields
sometimes mention Daugherity in the
same breath with "Chuck" Carney, all-
American end in 1920, and acknowl
edged the best center that ever played
basketball in the Western Conference.
Chuck was one of Illinois' greatest ath
letes, and last fall helped Arnold Hor
ween coach the oft-stepped-on Harvard
team.
Basketball seems to be a game that
appeals to football players. Ernie
Nevers, Stanford's greatest grid star,
also shone at the indoor game, and

j Harry Wilson, the fleet Army ball
! carrier, last year completely subdued
j the Navy in the annual service basket-
I ball game by dropping so many long
; shots into the cage that the middies
i were sunk 21 to 12.
The first time I saw Pug Dauglierity
I in action was in the Penn-Illinois foot
ball game of 1925. Although quite
over-shadowed by the invincible
Grange, who enjoyed one of the best
| days of his career, nevertheless Pug
j corralled most of the honors not car
ried off by the famous sorrel-top. He
j crashed through the Penn line on
| many occasions for first downs, and
i showed a clever little trick of slicing
I to one side or the other after crossing
the line of scrimmage.
Last fall after playing consistently
j good, though not spectacular football
throughout the season, he came into
his own in the Chicago game with a
brilliant sixty-yard run to make the
only score of the day.
When "Pug" starts, he just keeps
| right on going, either on the gridiron
) or on the basketball court.
