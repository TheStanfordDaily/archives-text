# LAST SCRIMMAGE OF WEEK HANDED 1930 BASKETBALL SQUAD
## Babes to Play California at Berkeley in First Tilt Of Series Friday 
### 
Both the hardest and the longest,
and incidentally, the last scrimmage
of the week, was issued yesterday
afternoon by Coaches Hunt and Mit
chell to the Cardinal freshman basket
ball squad in preparation for the game
against California Friday night.
This is the first game of the annual
series between the freshmen of Stan
ford and California, who will meet
in Berkeley. The California yearlings
will play a return match here next
week and the final game is scheduled
for San Francisco one week later.
There is no Stanford varsity game Fri
day night.
Plays Formulated
The stiff work-out enabled the fresh
man mentors to analyze closer the
operations of the different combina
tions of players and to help them
formulate the policies of play to be
used against the Bear Cubs. Practice
this afternoon will consist in smooth
ing up the offense perfected yesterday
and in drills on free shots and tip-off
plays. There will be no workout to
morrow as the coaches have granted
the babes a day of rest.
In the scrimmage, a squad composed
of Bush and Berg, forwards, Rothert,
center, Simpkins and Thompson,
guards, drew a tie score from a team
consisting of Garibotto and Stewart,
forwards, Russell, center, and Smith
and Steinbeck, guards. The first five
men will probably start the game
against California.
Rothert at Center
Rothert has been a little slow in
getting up in the air after the ball
but when Friday evening rolls around
he should be going strong. Although
this is the first time Bush has held a
forward position he is showing better
form than he did at center.
Berg, flashy partner of Bush, has
basket-shooting down to a science and
is the most dependable scorer that
the freshmen can figure on as he
doesn't get stale before the series.
With Thompson back at standing
guard working with Simpkins, the
babes have an excellent guard com
bination. Both men play a heady game
under fire and can always be counted
on to put plenty of push in the rest
of the squad.
