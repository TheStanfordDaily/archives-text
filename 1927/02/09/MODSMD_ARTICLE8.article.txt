Two championships were decided in
; intramural basketball yesterday when
| Phi Gamma Delta handed the Theta
; Xi five a 19 to 9 beating, winning the
| title for League VIII, and Sequoia I
trounced the Phi Sigma Kappa's 29
Ito 15, for League I's title. Kappa
j Sigma defeated Junipero Serra 13 to 5
: for the day's biggest thriller.
Hal Blazier led the Fiji five to the
! championship of League VIII in a
j game which well demonstrated the
j perfection of teamwork which has car
! ried the Fijis undefeated through the
j season, and which establishes them as
: strong contenders for the University
i title. Blazier contributed six points to
his team's total of 19 and starred
with his floorwork. Klotz, although he
missed three set-ups, worked credit
ably as the red-lieaded flash's running
mate.
For Theta Xi, Cased stood out. The
little forward was the fastest man
on the floor, but he was so closely
guarded that he scarcely had a fair
chance at the basket. The guarding
j was of such a high order as to effec
| tively stop almost any pair of for
j wards.
Miss Basket
The Kappa Sig-Junipero Serra game
I was a good example of how to win
basketball games with the least effort.
The latter ran the ball up and down
I the floor with great dash and spirit,
