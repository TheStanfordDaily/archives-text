Two championships were decided in
; intramural basketball yesterday when
| Phi Gamma Delta handed the Theta
; Xi five a 19 to 9 beating, winning the
| title for League VIII, and Sequoia I
trounced the Phi Sigma Kappa's 29
Ito 15, for League I's title. Kappa
j Sigma defeated Junipero Serra 13 to 5
: for the day's biggest thriller.
Hal Blazier led the Fiji five to the
! championship of League VIII in a
j game which well demonstrated the
j perfection of teamwork which has car
! ried the Fijis undefeated through the
j season, and which establishes them as
: strong contenders for the University
i title. Blazier contributed six points to
his team's total of 19 and starred
with his floorwork. Klotz, although he
missed three set-ups, worked credit
ably as the red-lieaded flash's running
mate.
For Theta Xi, Cased stood out. The
little forward was the fastest man
on the floor, but he was so closely
guarded that he scarcely had a fair
chance at the basket. The guarding
j was of such a high order as to effec
| tively stop almost any pair of for
j wards.
Miss Basket
The Kappa Sig-Junipero Serra game
I was a good example of how to win
basketball games with the least effort.
The latter ran the ball up and down
I the floor with great dash and spirit,
took frequent shots at the basket, and
fought hard, but failed to win because
they could not sink their shots. The
Kappa Sigs played more craftily and
managed to nose out ahead with a tinal
score of 14-12 in their favor.
Sequoia I trimmed Phi Sigma Kappa
29 to 5 in a comedy of errors for the
first of the evening's contests. Phi Sig
basketeers did lots of trying but little
else, their teamwork being a minus
quantity. G iff en, Sequoia forward, was
the outstanding player of the contest,
being accountable for twelve of the
winning team's points. Stimpson and
Cook also showed plenty of class.
Listless Game
El Capitan and Phi Kappa Psi's
teams won the prize of the evening's
contests for listless basketball. The
fraternity outfit Avas nosed out by a
5 to 4 score. The Phi Psi's were handi
capped somewhat in the first period
by the fact that they played with
only four men, but it is probable that,
the number of contestants had little
to do with the final outcome of the
tussle. Neither team had anything to
show in the way of basket-shooting or
defensive play. Prince, for the Phi
Psi's, was high-point man with all his
team's score to his credit.
Freshmen Win
Encina 3W and Branner I played
true to the standard set by their pre
decessors in the evening's battles
when they floundered through two
periods of poor basketball. The fresh
men triumphed 8 to 3. Branner ruined
its chances when one man too many
absent-mindedly left the floor during
a wholesale substitution, leaving only
four players to defend the cause.
While the ranks of the upperclassmen
were sadly depleted in this manner
the Encina boys slipped in a comfort
able lead. Branner discovered its error

too late and the additional player j
failed to stem the tide.
Today's games are as follows: En
cina 2E vs. Alpha Sigma Phi, 4:15; j

Listless Game
El Capitan and Phi Kappa Psi's
teams won the prize of the evening's
contests for listless basketball. The
fraternity outfit Avas nosed out by a
5 to 4 score. The Phi Psi's were handi
capped somewhat in the first period
by the fact that they played with
only four men, but it is probable that,
the number of contestants had little
to do with the final outcome of the
tussle. Neither team had anything to
show in the way of basket-shooting or
defensive play. Prince, for the Phi
Psi's, was high-point man with all his
team's score to his credit.
Freshmen Win
Encina 3W and Branner I played
true to the standard set by their pre
decessors in the evening's battles
when they floundered through two
periods of poor basketball. The fresh
men triumphed 8 to 3. Branner ruined
its chances when one man too many
absent-mindedly left the floor during
a wholesale substitution, leaving only
four players to defend the cause.
While the ranks of the upperclassmen
were sadly depleted in this manner
the Encina boys slipped in a comfort
able lead. Branner discovered its error

too late and the additional player j
failed to stem the tide.
Today's games are as follows: En

j Sigma defeated Junipero Serra 13 to 5
: for the day's biggest thriller.

! championship of League VIII in a
j game which well demonstrated the
j perfection of teamwork which has car
! ried the Fijis undefeated through the
j season, and which establishes them as
: strong contenders for the University
i title. Blazier contributed six points to
his team's total of 19 and starred
with his floorwork. Klotz, although he
missed three set-ups, worked credit
ably as the red-lieaded flash's running
mate.
For Theta Xi, Cased stood out. The
little forward was the fastest man
on the floor, but he was so closely
guarded that he scarcely had a fair
chance at the basket. The guarding
j was of such a high order as to effec
| tively stop almost any pair of for
j wards.

The Kappa Sig-Junipero Serra game
I was a good example of how to win
basketball games with the least effort.
The latter ran the ball up and down
I the floor with great dash and spirit,
took frequent shots at the basket, and
fought hard, but failed to win because
they could not sink their shots. The
Kappa Sigs played more craftily and
managed to nose out ahead with a tinal
score of 14-12 in their favor.
Sequoia I trimmed Phi Sigma Kappa
29 to 5 in a comedy of errors for the
first of the evening's contests. Phi Sig
basketeers did lots of trying but little
else, their teamwork being a minus
quantity. G iff en, Sequoia forward, was
the outstanding player of the contest,
being accountable for twelve of the
winning team's points. Stimpson and
Cook also showed plenty of class.
