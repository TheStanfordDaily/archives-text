# HUNT FOLLOWS EASY WORKOUT PLAN FOR MEN
## Cardinal Cagers Specialize In Basket-Shooting, Free Throws TEAM LOSING WEIGHT Two Sets of Forwards to See Action Against Fresno State 
### Fred Speers 
Coach Husky Hunt last night con
tinued to follow his newly adopted
policy of letting the varsity rest in
stead of scrimmage for the coming
game with Fresno State next Saturday
night in the pavilion. There is too
much danger of anyone going "stale"
to keep up the training pace set in
anticipation of the Trojan games of
last week-end.
Team Shoots
Basket-shooting with emphasis on
free throws has been taking up much
of the time of the varsity. Light pass
ing work has been given the Cardinal
squad but in the main, features of in
dividual playing have been stressed.
Coach Hunt reached the conclusion
that this form of training would be
better at this stage of the season when
he learned from the weight charts that
some of his men had been losing fast.
Hunt Puzzled
It is not a question, now, of what
team of five men will be best to work
on in anticipation of the Bruin series.
The problem which will face Coach
Husky Hunt on February 18, date of
the first California-Stanford tilt, is
' what five men in the squad are in
the best shape to start?" This has
been the form of query which Hunt
has worried about during the latter
part of (he season.
However, certain limitations are
placed upon the choice which Hunt
must make. For example, he finds it
necessary to work David and McCand
less together as forwards and Bryant
and Christ as another set of equally
good forwards. He will give these two
sets of forwards a chance to get good
workouts in the game with Fresno
State next Saturday.
