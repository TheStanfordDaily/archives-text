# SEMI-PROFESSIONALS LOSE TO CARDS 3-0; MAKE RECORD TIME
## 
### 
In one of the shortest baseball
games played on the Stanford dia
mond, the Cardinal nine handed the
Klawans and McMullin outfit a 3-0
beating in one hour and thirty min
utes. Count. Sobieski, on the mound for
the Redsliirts, allowed the semi-pro
fessional aggregation only four hits
during the nine innings.
All runs were made in the third
inning, when Stanford scored on three
errors, a single, a double by McGuire,
and a fielders' choice. Painter and
Venic composed the visitors' battery
which gave the Redshirts six bingles.
The varsity meets Santa Clara in its
first intercollegiate game of the sea
son at San Jose on Saturday afternoon
at 2:30 o'clock.
