Due to the fact that he has received
2000 inquiries about the summer
quarter, which is about half as many
again as had been written up to this
time last year, John A. Sellards, Sum-1
mer Quarter Director, predicts a
larger enrollment this summer than j
ever before.
This quarter at Stanford is not a I
special summer session, as at many |
other universities, but it is one of the j
four regular terms of the academic i
year.By attending the University all 1
four quarters each year, a student may
graduate in three, instead of four,
years. The quarter runs from June 1
to August 27.
Because of the large number of
teachers and others who are able to I
attend only the summer quarter, the !
University makes special provision for
opening a wide variety of advanced
and general courses, as well as those
ordinarily required by the regular un- i
dergraduate' students. This coming
summer a more varied program is of
fered for regular students than at any
other preceding summer quarter.
Courses particularly designed for
new students will be offered by sev
eral departments. The regular Stan
ford faculty will also be supplemented i
by several eminent professors from 1
foreign and American universities. ,
To meet the needs of the teachers, |
the Department of Education will offer
an especially complete curriculum, in
cluding subjects designed for profes- ,
sional training. The Law School will
provide courses for students beginning !
the study of law as well as for those i
who desire more advanced work.
