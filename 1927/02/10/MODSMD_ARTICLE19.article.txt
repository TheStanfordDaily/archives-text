# WHISKER GROWERS RUNNING NECK AND NECK ED GRANNIS TO FORE IN BIG SURPRISE SPURT MONDAY ANNOUNCED AS DATE FOR FINAL REVIEW
## 
### 
Interest is running higher and I
higher as the racers in the Marathon |
Whisker Contest are noaring the tape.
With only one contestant out, the
others are showing remarkable form,
and as yet no one is at a disadvantage.
Grannis Steps Out
One of the biggest surprises of the ,
week was Ed Grannis' spurt up to the |
front. Unfortunately for Paine, who is
growing most of his beard on his neck j

where it can be in the j
shade, the Harker's j
formal Friday is cai\s-!
ing him considerable
worry, and his form is !
getting bad.
Discriminating T>e- j
lilah is intrigued with ,

( 'hris Freeman's Nordic growth Jones,'
another blond, is strangely enough
raising a black beard. Malnick, one of

the entrants who is keeping up in
front, is the proud possessor of a nice,
even growth.
Review Monday
The judges announced yesterday
that the review will be held next. Mon
day at 2:30 o'clock, as previously ar
ranged. The awards will be based on
general tonsorial artistry and growth,
and it is entirely up to the individual
whether or not he will carve arbesques
and what-nots on his face.
Five Prizes
Five prizes will be distributed. The
first will be $10 and an exotic cup of
unusual appeal. The dramatic Council
has promised to donate two tickets to
the play following "The Swan" for
second prize. The Old Hoy will not
divulge what the third, fourth, and
fifth prizes are, but promises that they
will be highly desirous.
