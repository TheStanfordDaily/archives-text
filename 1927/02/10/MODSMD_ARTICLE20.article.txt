Beta went down to defeat last night
before the attack of the A.T.O. intra
mural basketball tossers, and the vic
tory put the A.T.O.'s clear up at the
top of their league as winners. The
score of 22 to 12 does not put the
game in its true light, for it was a
battle from beginning to the end.
Alpha Sig Wins
Alpha Sig took a fairly easy win
from the freshmen on Encina 2E 20-8.
The victory put the underclassmen no
further down in their league rating, as
they were already at the bottom, but
served to advance the fraternity men
to second standing.
The Zetes took a bad beating from
the Alpha Delts when the latter ran
away with a 14-point lead, winning the
game 26-12. The score had the effect
of weakening the Zetes' second rating
and unquestionably cinching the Alpha
Delts' hold on first place in League 11.
El Toro on Top
El Toro and Theta Chi battled away
with no particular hope of glory in
their league. The fraternity men came
out the worst of the deal, losing 25-20.
Encina 5 nearly took the measure
of Los Arcos, but the eating club men
were successful in the end and topped
the two-digit end of a 10-9 score.
The last of the games scheduled,
for last night was a default, Delta Up
silon forfeiting to Encina IW.
