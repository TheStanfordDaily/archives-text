# A 						Weighty Subject
## 
### 
By an overwhelming vote at Tuesday's election the Stanford student
body decided there should be five first-class minor sportsâ€”swimming,
boxing, polo, soccer, and weight basketball. Neither the students who
voted, nor the committee which drew up the amendment, took into con
sideration just how such a ruling could be carried out if it should pass.
And now it has passed. The amendment is added to the constitution,
and the problem of weight basketball must be settled. During the
basketball season, all available courts are occupied in the afternoons by
varsity, freshman, intramural, and gymnasium teams. There is no space
at present in which the 145-pound and 130-pound quintets could practice.
Last year the weight teams worked out between the hours of 7 o'clock
and 9 o'clock in the evenings. But Dr. Storey, head of the Men's
Physical Education Department, seriously objects to hard scrimmages
immediately after big meals. "It is both injurious and dangerous to the
man's health," said Dr. Storey. It was pointed out that the varsity and
freshman teams play games once or twice a week in the early evenings,
but it will be remembered that the coaches insist that the player's meal
time be moved ahead on such nights.
The Physical Education Department is as much in favor of basketball
as are the students who voted for the amendment Tuesday, but the
members of the department can not be expected to perform any slight-of
liand tricks in procuring courts. ".See there are no courts up my sleeve.
Ilokus-pokus. Now you have basketball courts."
The students are not to be severely blamed for this poor foresight.
It can be expected that the majority voters only know what they read
in the paper, and what their friends tell them. They do not go to the
trouble of investigating or even reasoning. Then, too, only those in favor
of a proposal will go and vote. Those who are against the movement
will stay at home and hope that the amendment will not carry.
But how a committee can draw up such an amendment after doing
a little research work on the subject is more than the Daily can figure
out.
It is easy enough to see what the result will be. Weight basketball
will be declared a first-class minor sport, and yet there will be no such
sport played at Stanford. It is a fine thing to place in the constitution
right at the time when the A.S.S.U. Rules are being revised.
