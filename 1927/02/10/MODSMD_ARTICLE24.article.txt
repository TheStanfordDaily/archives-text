# What, No Ballots?

### 
The Daily now nominates to the Hall of Fame, the 1927 election
board, which runs out of ballots on the clay of the election, and prevents
tiie sophomore and junior classes from naming- their officers. To figure
the correct number of students in the various classes is no doubt a
difficult task as there is only (he bawl-out, and the official records, from
which to .«£cure the data.
The economy campaign that has struck the campus may have some
thing to do with the unfortunate affair of last Tuesday. Save at the
expense of everything else. Tt is rumored that a "bring your own ballot"
campaign will be inaugurated before the next election.
