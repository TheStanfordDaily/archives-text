Stanford women were faced with a 1
large responsibility in the letter,
signed F.H.M., which appeared in yes
terday's Daily. F.H.M once woman's
editor of the Daily Palo Alto, had the
temerity to anticipate the time when
smoking would not he regarded as a
sign of immorality in women. So
F.H.M. wrote an article for The Illus
trated Review on the subject. She
promptly found herself in hot water.
The Women's Council took the matter
up and she was threatened *ith expul
sion. Now, F.H.M. recalls her case to
the minds of Stanford women, who
have removed the prohibition from
smoking just six years ago,
they became officially incensed at the
mere mention of the fact that some ol
them did smoke.
Undeniably, F.H.M. has caught the
Stanford women in a very embarras
sing position. If smoking was immoral
six years ago, is it to be assumed that
the present generation of Stanford
women have removed the ban on im
morality? Certainly not. Such an as
sumption is absurd.
Where the women made their origi
nal mistake was in definitely describ
ing what was moral and what was not,
just as they still commit the error of
deciding which hotels are approved
and which are not, and how many peo
ple must compose a strolling group in
order to insure propriety.
The present Women's Council is in

the unfortunate position of having a
lot of precedents that were inherited
directly from mid-Victorian days. Be
fore they can discharge the function
of their offices with some degree of
safety from criticism, the members of
the Council should consider the
sources of these precedents. (Note:
see Thomas Beer's "Mauve Decade"
chapter entitled The Titaness.)
It was customary at one time —ap-
parently up to six years ago at Stan
ford —to think that morality was a
rigid thing, and that the exact limits
of decency could be definitely defined
for eternity. A number of ladies' or
ganizations ambitiously endeavored to
do just this. Apparently the local
Women's Council of the day was
among them.
A? a matter of future policy it would
be advisable for the Women's Council
to consider cases only in the light of
the effect of student immorality on
the name of the University. In this
way, a suitable balance could be
struck between the moral standards
actually prevailing at Stanford and
the moral standards expected of Stan
ford students by interested outsiders.
The Women's Council operating under
this policy would never be placed in
the difficult position of judging indi
vidual cases as such. It would simply
be taking the position of protecting
| the reputation and standing of the
I University.
