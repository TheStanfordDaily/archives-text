"The average Englishwoman under
50 smokes incessantly," declared Miss
Alice Baker when addressing students
of the Colorado Agricultural College
recently. "Smoking is as common there
among.women as it is among men."
"Mothers pass cigarettes to daugh
ters and daughters to mothers, and
they smoke together," continued Miss
Baker. "Lounging rooms of hotels are
full of smoke and smokers. "Women's
lounges—if there are any difference —
are bluer with smoke than the men's.
There are writing rooms where smok
ing is supposed to be prohibited but
where it goes on at all times.
"The thint' that impressed me about.
England was the financial trouble she
is having," concluded Miss Baker,
"and. I believe, if they would cut their
smoking and drinking in half they
would relieve much of their financial
distress."
