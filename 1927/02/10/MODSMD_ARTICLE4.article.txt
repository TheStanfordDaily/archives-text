Self-T rained
Since then he has been instructor
of Spanish at\he University of Texas,
but follows art as a chosen subject.
It is interesting to know that his art
training is self-acquired.
Mr. Messenger's canvasses are
painted in an impressionistic style,
applying most of his color with the
pallette knife.
Where he does not use the brush,
the strokes are executed in a direct,
broad manner. It may be said that the
pallette knifo would favor the cliffs,
rocks, and ground, while the brush
would favor the sky, ocean, trees, and
cactus, although Mr. Messenger uses
both in either cases.
The colors are clear and brilliant in
most all of the pictures, giving the
whole display a cheerful effect.
The painting entitled "Direct Pat
tern" shows a very good handling of
the rocky mountain. The "Carmel
Cypress" has a rugged crispness
throughout the whole picture. Some of
the other subjects are "Temples of
the Ages," "Point Lobos," "Desola
tion," and "El Capitan."
