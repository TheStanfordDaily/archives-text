# BOY SCOUTS ASK ALL DONORS FOR CLOTHING
## 
### 
Aid to hundreds of unfortunate men
and women will be the aim of a sal
vage drive to be conducted Saturday
by the Santa Clara County Goodwill
Industries plant in San Jose, the Boy
Scouts, and the Hi-Y. Old clothing
furniture, newspapers, and
magazines will be acceptable, and
those who have any articles to con
tribute are asked to leave them on
the sidewalks in bundles bearing the
name and address of the donor.
The Goodwill Industries give self
supporting work to old or handicapped
people who ask for a chance to earn
their living and are too proud to beg
or accept charity.
