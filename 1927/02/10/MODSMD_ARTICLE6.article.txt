# DR. BAILEY ADDS CHAPTER TO STANFORD ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
Adding a new chapter to her accom
plishments in Stanford activities, Dr.
Margery Bailey will appear tomorrow
night in the Masquers' play as Prin
cess Dominica. Although the cast of
"The Swan" is otherwise entirely com
posed of students, in the absence of
anyone appealing at the tryouts who
could bring out the dignity and matur
ity required by the part, Dr. Bailey
was selected by Gordon Davis.
Masquers' Society, women's dra
matic organization, under whose auspi
ces "The Swan" is to be given, also
claims Dr. Bailey as a member, in
recognition of her work in campus
plays during her undergraduate years
at Stanford. Graduating in 1914 with
an A.B. in English, Dr. Bailey had
taken leading roles in "Pillars of So
ciety," "Arms and the Man," and "The
Seven Sisters," in addition to holding
executive positions on the four major
campus publications. She is also a
member of Phi Beta Kappa, Cap and
Gown, the English Club, and was hon
ored with the degree of Ph.D. by Yale
University following work there in
1922. Returning to Stanford, she has
since been a member of the English
faculty in the capacity of assistant
professor of English.
Has Royal Role
The role of Dominica, royal mother
of Prince Albert and sponsor of the
latter's marital aspirations, is her first
appearance since "The Torch Bearers,"
faculty play of two years past. Domi
