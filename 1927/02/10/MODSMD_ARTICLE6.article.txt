# DR. BAILEY ADDS CHAPTER TO STANFORD ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
Adding a new chapter to her accom
plishments in Stanford activities, Dr.
Margery Bailey will appear tomorrow
night in the Masquers' play as Prin
cess Dominica. Although the cast of
"The Swan" is otherwise entirely com
posed of students, in the absence of
anyone appealing at the tryouts who
could bring out the dignity and matur
ity required by the part, Dr. Bailey
was selected by Gordon Davis.
Masquers' Society, women's dra
matic organization, under whose auspi
ces "The Swan" is to be given, also
claims Dr. Bailey as a member, in
recognition of her work in campus
plays during her undergraduate years
at Stanford. Graduating in 1914 with
an A.B. in English, Dr. Bailey had
taken leading roles in "Pillars of So
ciety," "Arms and the Man," and "The
Seven Sisters," in addition to holding
executive positions on the four major
campus publications. She is also a
member of Phi Beta Kappa, Cap and
Gown, the English Club, and was hon
ored with the degree of Ph.D. by Yale
University following work there in
1922. Returning to Stanford, she has
since been a member of the English
faculty in the capacity of assistant
professor of English.
Has Royal Role
The role of Dominica, royal mother
of Prince Albert and sponsor of the
latter's marital aspirations, is her first
appearance since "The Torch Bearers,"
faculty play of two years past. Domi
uating the action of the final scene,
tshe brings the Molnar comedy-satire
to a close by admonishing "the swan,"
Princess Alexandra, never to betray
her close kinship to a common duck
by walking on land, but to confine her
activities to gliding majestically on
the surface of the water.
The dress rehearsal held last night
in preparation of the production
brought to light an unintentional im
provement in the acoustics of the As
sembly Hall. Following the remodeling
of the hall, the roof was left unplas
tered, leaving the heavy supporting
beams and wood cross bars open. The
result, although unsatisfactory in ap
pearance, seems to carry voices to the
back of the hall with a noticeable im
provement in volume and clearness.
The plastering work will not be com
pleted until September.
New Roof Built
The new roof has also made possible
the installation of a set of lights above
and twenty feet beyond the stage. This
method has been used by modern
theatres in order to assist the ordinary
foot and flood lights which otherwise
inadequately present normal lighting
effects.
Tickets for "The Swan" are on sale
at the Old Union ticket office from
1 to 5 o'clock each afternoon, while
roughs' seats for the performance«will
be sold at the Assembly Hall office
tomorrow night. The play will start
promptly at 8:15 o'clock, and will be
followed by a dance in the Women's
Clubhouse.

Tickets for "The Swan" are on sale
at the Old Union ticket office from
1 to 5 o'clock each afternoon, while
roughs' seats for the performance«will
be sold at the Assembly Hall office
tomorrow night. The play will start

followed by a dance in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Adding a new chapter to her accom
plishments in Stanford activities, Dr.
Margery Bailey will appear tomorrow
night in the Masquers' play as Prin
cess Dominica. Although the cast of
"The Swan" is otherwise entirely com
posed of students, in the absence of
anyone appealing at the tryouts who
could bring out the dignity and matur
ity required by the part, Dr. Bailey
was selected by Gordon Davis.
Masquers' Society, women's dra
matic organization, under whose auspi
ces "The Swan" is to be given, also
claims Dr. Bailey as a member, in
recognition of her work in campus
plays during her undergraduate years
at Stanford. Graduating in 1914 with
an A.B. in English, Dr. Bailey had
taken leading roles in "Pillars of So
ciety," "Arms and the Man," and "The
Seven Sisters," in addition to holding
executive positions on the four major
campus publications. She is also a
member of Phi Beta Kappa, Cap and
Gown, the English Club, and was hon
ored with the degree of Ph.D. by Yale
University following work there in
1922. Returning to Stanford, she has
since been a member of the English
faculty in the capacity of assistant
professor of English.
Has Royal Role
The role of Dominica, royal mother
of Prince Albert and sponsor of the
latter's marital aspirations, is her first
appearance since "The Torch Bearers,"
faculty play of two years past. Domi
uating the action of the final scene,
tshe brings the Molnar comedy-satire
to a close by admonishing "the swan,"
Princess Alexandra, never to betray
her close kinship to a common duck
by walking on land, but to confine her
activities to gliding majestically on
the surface of the water.
The dress rehearsal held last night
in preparation of the production
brought to light an unintentional im
provement in the acoustics of the As
sembly Hall. Following the remodeling
of the hall, the roof was left unplas
tered, leaving the heavy supporting
beams and wood cross bars open. The
result, although unsatisfactory in ap
pearance, seems to carry voices to the
back of the hall with a noticeable im
provement in volume and clearness.
The plastering work will not be com
pleted until September.
New Roof Built
The new roof has also made possible
the installation of a set of lights above
and twenty feet beyond the stage. This
method has been used by modern
theatres in order to assist the ordinary
foot and flood lights which otherwise
inadequately present normal lighting
effects.
