# BABES BATTLE CUBS IN FIRST CAGE CONTEST
## Berg Leads His Teammates Against Polished Cubs At Berkeley YEARLINGS HAVE FIGHT Coach Mugs Mitchell Sure Proteges Can Defeat Ancient Rivals 
### 
Harry Berg, newly-elected captain
of the freshman basketball team, and
twelve members of the squad, accom
panied by Coaches Hunt and Mit
chell, will leave at 12:58 o'clock this
noon for Berkeley to engage in the
first game of the Stanford-California
freshmen "little big" series. The con
test tonight starts at 8 o'clock and
will be played in Harmon gymnasium.
The men that are making the trip
are Bush, Berg, Garibotto, Dowling,
and Stewart, forwards; Rothert and
Russell, centers; Simkins, Smith,
Thompson, Albertson, Steinbeck, and
Mann, guards.
The game will be liard-fought and
close if previous games and compari
son of scores can be used as indicators.
The main factor, which cannot be cal
culated in cold figures, is the tight
that the Cardinal Babes have adhered
to since the Santa Barbara game of
last week. They have snapped up their
"whole playing system, both offensive
and tip-offs, and have developed ac
curacy for hitting the basket. In the
opinion of Coach Mugs Mitchell, "If
the fellows use their heads, and fight
hard, they should beat the Cal frosh."
The Bear Cubs will present a pol
ished aggregation, one that has won
eight out of ten games, and has made
a 305-point score to their opponents'
total of 203. The Stanford freshmen
have-won seven contests out of an
eleven-game schedule, and have scored
287 points to their opponents' total
of 216.
The St. Mary's freshman team was
the only quintet to win from both
California and Stanford. St. Mary's
defeated California 33 to 27 and only
beat the Cardinals one point in a 24-23
score.
The line-up that will start for the
Stanford freshman team is: Berg and
Bush, forwards; Rothert, center, Sim
kins and Thompson, guards.
