# Shift Not Needed For Spectacular Football--Warner
## 
### Aileen Hicks 
"He's all wrong," are the Vords
1 used by Coach "Pop" Warner to ex
-1 press his attitude toward Knute
j Rockne's statement that the recent
! football ruling to eliminate shift plays
| would ruin the sport. The Stanford
| mentor claims that shift plays give
! too much responsibility to the offi
! cials, and that any team can play just
I as spectacular a game without them.
To support his assertion that the
j shift is not essential, Warner says:
j "In canvassing the ten leading teams
i in the country for the past few years,
! you will find only a small percentage
j of those teams each year who used
j the shift. During the present season,
i Navy, Michigan, Alabama, Stanford,
j Lafayette, Brown, and Pittsburgh are
j examples of some of the best teams
! in the United States which do not use
jit."
Discusses Notre Dame
! In considering the effect that the
j elimination of the shift would have
| upon Notre Dame itself, Warner de-
I clares: "Notre Dame had an outstand
ing record the past few years, but it
I is my opinion that they would have
| had just as good a record if they
hadn't used the shift, and that they
| would play just as spectacular a
game.
"Thei trouble with the shift is that
I it leads to arguments and places too
i much responsibility upon the officials.
| There should not be anything about
! football which leaves a question in the
minds of either the spectators or of
ficials as to whether or not the game
is being carried on properly."
