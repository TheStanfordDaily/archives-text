# CAPTAIN STEVENSON LEADS CARD MERMEN IN OREGON CONTEST
## Varsity Faces Webfooters Tomorrow Afternoon In Encina Pool 
### 
Captain Carl Stevenson will lead
the Stanford varsity into its first
swimming meet tomorrow afternoon
when it starts for conference honors
against the Oregon mermen in what
promises to be a contest of champion
ship calibre. Stanford has not yet en
tered a meet this year, while Oregon
has beaten the most powerful teams
in the North, with the exception of
the Multnomah Club, which defeated
the Webfooters twice.
On his southern tour, Coach Ed
Abercrombie is bringing with him a
veteran team of stellar swimmers.
"Weg" Fletcher is one of the outstand
ing men contesting for the northern
ers, being a constant winner in the
breaststroke. For the dives, Oregon
can produce Byerley and Davis; Mc-
Cook is probably her best man in the
100-yard free style, usually finishing in
59:3. Smith and Kier in the back-*
stroke and Greulich in the 50-yard are
also expected to show up well in the
Encina pool.
Coach Brandsten is entering a team
that, man for man, appears fully as
strong as the Webfooters. Christenson
and Van den Akker in the 50 and
O'Connor and Williams in the 100 are
looking like strong bidders for places
in their events. Entering the back
stroke will be Stevenson and Brooks,
who both showed up well in the inter
class meet. Ophuls and West, winners
of first and second place in that meet,
v ill enter the breaststroke, while Dan
ford and O'Connor are to represent
Stanford in the 220.
In diving, Mills and Smith are ex
pected to account for two places even
against the strong Oregon divers. The
Webfooters are not given a very
strong chance in the relay, especially
when the Stanford team will consist
of several national champions. The
four-man relay team will be picked
from Danford, Harris, Brooks, Doerr,
Van den Akker, Williams, O'Connor,
and Christenson.
The meet will be held in the Encina
pool, and will start at 2:30 o'clock.
