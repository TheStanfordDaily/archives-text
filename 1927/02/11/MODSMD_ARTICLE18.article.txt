# POWER OF VIBRATION SHOWN BY BIRDMAN AT JORDAN LECTURE
## 
### 
Charles Kellogg, birdman, was the
guest of Dr. Jordan at the weekly
conference, last evening. Kellogg sang
the songs of various birds and demon
strated by means of specially con
structed equipment the power of vibra
tions.
Kellogg has traveled extensively
throughout the world studying the
songs of birds, and has spent thirty
three years on the stage singing these
songs and demonstrating his vibration
devices.
A sensitive flame, used by Kellogg,
was invented in Palo Alto by Professor i
Leconte. By whistling, Kellogg was j
able to change the flame to a lUmseu |
burner.
"It is possible," declared Kellogg,
"to kill a person by whistling at a
certain pitch. This oxplains also the
fall of the walls of Jericho."
