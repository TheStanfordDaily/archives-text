# FRESNO STATE WIS CARD CAGE QUINTET
## Herbie Christ Forges to Front as Strongest Forward JONES' TEAM IS STRONG Hunt Abandons Scrimmage Schedule This Week; Feared Staleness 
### Fred Speers 
Tomorrow night Stanford will at
tempt to clear the last remaining hur
dle before the California series.
Fresno State College will line up
against Husky Hunt's varsity at 8
o'clock in the pavilion.
Following a week of rather easy
practices, it is hard to predict what
sort of shape the Cardinals will he in
when they meet Fresno. Hunt has
been watching carefully that none of
his men go stale and consequently
abandoned the schedule of scrimmage
games with intramural teams which
he used in anticipation of the Trojan
series.
Starting Lineups
For a starting lineup tomorrow
night the Cardinal mentor will prob
ably use Anderson, standing guard,
Vincenti, running guard, Jayred, cen
ter, and take his choice at the last
minute between his two braces of for
wards: David and McCandless, or
Christ and Bryant.
Coach Art Jones of Fresno brings
to the campus a team of what appears
to be of somewhat greater extent
than that possessed by the College
of the Pacific outfit which the Cardi
nals defeated 23 to 15 earlier in the
season. Fresno recently split a two
game series with Pacific but since
then has been improving rapidly.
On the Fresno outfit are two men
in particular who will bear watching:
Wilhelmson, forward, and Pollock,
standing guard. The former is a small
player, capable of playing a hard, fast
game. Pollock is an especially strong
defensive player.
The variable quantities in the Stan
ford squad seem to be the forwards,
the main wheels of offensive play. Bye
Bryant, who is leading the Cardinals
in number of points tallied thus far
in the season, is, when he is going
well, particularly dangerous in an
attack. He is generally not strong on
defensive playing.
Christ Good on Floor
Christ, who has come to the front
but recently and, what is more, has
stayed there, is indefatigable on floor
work. He is the strongest forward on
defensive which Hunt possesses and,
on offense, consistently feeds the bull
to his teammates. If there was such a
thing in basketball, his "assists"
would be many. ,
David, who seemingly "hit his
stride" in the U.S.C. series, is capable
of excellent work on the offense. His
passing in the second game of the
dual contest was accurate, sure, and
fast. In the first three or four minutes
of play he ran up eight points for the
Cardinal with what seemed to be a
minimum of effort. Only on defense
did he slip down. Captain David will
be the man to watch tomorrow night."
McCandless differs from his forward
teammates in several Ways. He is
tall, and relatively good at long shots,
while the others seem to go better
at short shots under the basket. Mc-
Candless appeared to have hit a slump
recently but in practice this week he
has picked up.

Christ and Bryant.
Coach Art Jones of Fresno brings
to the campus a team of what appears
to be of somewhat greater extent
than that possessed by the College
of the Pacific outfit which the Cardi
nals defeated 23 to 15 earlier in the
season. Fresno recently split a two
game series with Pacific but since
then has been improving rapidly.
On the Fresno outfit are two men
in particular who will bear watching:
Wilhelmson, forward, and Pollock,
standing guard. The former is a small
player, capable of playing a hard, fast
game. Pollock is an especially strong
defensive player.
The variable quantities in the Stan
ford squad seem to be the forwards,
the main wheels of offensive play. Bye
Bryant, who is leading the Cardinals
in number of points tallied thus far
in the season, is, when he is going
well, particularly dangerous in an
attack. He is generally not strong on
defensive playing.
Christ Good on Floor
Christ, who has come to the front
but recently and, what is more, has
stayed there, is indefatigable on floor
work. He is the strongest forward on
defensive which Hunt possesses and,
on offense, consistently feeds the bull
to his teammates. If there was such a
thing in basketball, his "assists"
would be many. ,
David, who seemingly "hit his
stride" in the U.S.C. series, is capable
of excellent work on the offense. His
passing in the second game of the
dual contest was accurate, sure, and
fast. In the first three or four minutes
of play he ran up eight points for the
Cardinal with what seemed to be a
minimum of effort. Only on defense
did he slip down. Captain David will
be the man to watch tomorrow night."
McCandless differs from his forward
teammates in several Ways. He is
tall, and relatively good at long shots,
while the others seem to go better
at short shots under the basket. Mc-
Candless appeared to have hit a slump
recently but in practice this week he
has picked up.
Tomorrow night Stanford will at
tempt to clear the last remaining hur
dle before the California series.
Fresno State College will line up
against Husky Hunt's varsity at 8
o'clock in the pavilion.
Following a week of rather easy
practices, it is hard to predict what
sort of shape the Cardinals will he in
when they meet Fresno. Hunt has
been watching carefully that none of
his men go stale and consequently
abandoned the schedule of scrimmage
games with intramural teams which
he used in anticipation of the Trojan
series.
Starting Lineups
For a starting lineup tomorrow
night the Cardinal mentor will prob
ably use Anderson, standing guard,
Vincenti, running guard, Jayred, cen
ter, and take his choice at the last
minute between his two braces of for
wards: David and McCandless, or
Christ and Bryant.
