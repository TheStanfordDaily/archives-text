# PROGRAM PRESENTED BY CONTRALTO WINS FAVOR OF AUDIENCE
## 
### Herbert Klein 
It would be difficult to imagine a
contralto singer possessing more bal
anced gifts of voice, dramatic powers,
and personality than Katliryn Meisle
who sang last night in the Assembly
Hall as one of the Peninsula Music
Association's artist series.
The grand opera star continually
showed through the work of the con
cert singer in Miss Meisle's remark
able sense of the dramatic in vocal
coloring as well as pantomime, mak
ing one think involuntarily of another
great singer-actor, Chaliapin. In vol
ume, too, Katherine Meisle parallels
the great basso, for with complete
ease she executed the most exacting
notes and filled the Assembly Hall.
The characterization of the three
actors, father, son, and Erl King, in
Schubert's "Erl Koenig," was clear
and sharp, achieved without affecta
tion or artificiality. The sense of sus
pense, of terror, of the Erl King's
malice, in short, of everything that
makes the song thrilling, was there in
full force.
The accompanist, Solon Alberti, per
formed capably in all the numbers. As
an encore Miss Meisle sang his com
position, "One Hour."
