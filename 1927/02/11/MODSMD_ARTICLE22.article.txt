# Clouds of Smoke
## 
### 
Stanford women, by declaring that they had the right to smoke in
their living groups, and that they intended to do the same, have given
the University more publicity than any number of national football
championships. In practically every paper in the United States have
appeared exaggerated stories of the ruling. In a great number of other
universities newspaper men have interviewed college women, asking
them their opinions of Stanford's action.
A San Francisco newspaper featured pictures of Stanford women
preparing to "light up," and the same picture will be published in many
cities all over the country. The Daily Califoniian criticizes the five
hundred, for smoking when it knows quite well that the Berkeley girls
are not above smoking, and for that matter rather in favor of it.
It seems that the whole matter of women smoking was handled in
an awkward manner. Other universities have rulings similar to the
recent regulations passed by the women at Stanford, but these other
institutions did not broadcast their actions to the world. Smoking', like
any other habit, is a personal matter and is not the business of the
curious public. The public, and especially the uneducated public, revels
in wild stories of college life, and smoking when done by the weaker sex
is still a sin in some people's minds.
Because of recent developments the public is forming a beautiful
picture of the Stanford woman. They see her with a cigarette hanging
out of one corner of her mouth while she pours over her textbook. But
it's her own fault; she started the stories.
