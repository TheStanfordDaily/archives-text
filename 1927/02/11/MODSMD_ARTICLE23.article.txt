# Football and Life

(1. Lowes Dickenson says, "An American football match exhibits in a
type the American spirit, short, sharp, specific, intense, no loitering" by
the road, no enjoyment in the process, no favor, no quarter, but a fight
to the death with victory as the end and everything' and anything as
means."
The simile between the game of football and American life is well
drawn, but the description that Dickenson gives us of football itself is
worthy of careful consideration, and perhaps a bit of praise.
I low many men enjoy the process of making the football team?
There may be a few exceptions, but it is safe to say that few grid stars
are disappointed when they are excused from a day of practice. Every
one enjoys the distinction of having made the football team. The honor
of wearing the block letter and being pointed out as the varsity tackle
appeals to every red-blooded college student.
The fact that football is so typical of American life is the very reason
why the sport is, and should be, as much a part of the University's
curriculum as are studies. A college is to prepare the young man for
the life that he will encounter when he steps out into the world. There
fore the game of football is one of the best trainings for men. They
learn that there is no enjoyment in the process: they learn that there can
be no loitering by the road if there is to be success. What better training
for life could one ask for?
It is asked every day why the public takes so much more interest in
football than it does in the studies of a university. 11. L. Mencken offers
a solution. Ile says that the public likes to see things accomplished.
Certainly in football Mr. Public sees things accomplished, and the faster
the process goes on the better the spectator enjoys it all. On the other
hand, a scientific experiment takes weeks, months, and even years.
Mencken says the public does not care to wait that long.
