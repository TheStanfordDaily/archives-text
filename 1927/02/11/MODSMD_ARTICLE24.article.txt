Big League tactics have been adopted by Indiana gamblers but failed
completely before the superior training of Wabash's cage mentor. The

"College basketball's greatest scandal was uncovered here Wednesday
when Athletic Director Scholler announced that before the Franklin game
of January 21, a local gambler approached a member of the Wabash team
and informed him that there was a sum of money bet on the game on points
and if this player would not overly e-xort himself, he would be well token
care of. The player, in accordance with his Little Giant training, went to
Coach Vaughan and told the story."
