Since everyone goes out on Friday I
night anyhow, it is not too presumptu- I
tious to tell them where to go. Is it?
Particularly when one assumes the
paternal attitude of a politician ad- j
dressing his constituents and tells the !
dear people that he is acting in their j
best interests.
As we were saying, everyone is j
going out tonight anyhow. So we are (
going to risk incurring the emnity of J
the Palo Alto movie people, and ever j
so many purveyors of various means !
of entertainment in San Francisco to :
tell them where to go. We are also
going to risk accusations of under
hand publicity for the dramatic coun
cil. Ah! Now the cat's out of the bag.
Isn't it?
* * *
Of course everyone knows by this
time that "The Swan" is to be pre
sented tonight in the Assembly Hall.
And everyone knows that Franz Mol
nar wrote "The Swan." And nearly
everyone knows that Gordon Davis
is directing the present production.
And everyone should know that Doc
tor Margery Bailey is taking the part
of Princess Dominica. And everyone
who knows who Doctor Bailey is will
be there, and anyone who doesn't
would be crazy not to go and find out.
And if, knowing all Hiese things
there is still someone who is thinking

of going somewhere other than to
"The Swan" tonight, let him consider
that the cast includes Louise Buxton
and Sarah Margaret Burns and Ed
wina Ewing.
Now, everyone ought to be con
vinced. But on the bare supposition
that someone is not, there is another
ince'ntive. Have you ever gone to see
a great athlete on the stage? And
after you got there have you seen him
paddle around in a ten-foot tank, or
knock paper balls into the audience,
or spar furiously with an imaginary
opponent? If you have you will appre
ciate seeing an ail-American halfback
011 the stage who would have a legiti
mate right to be there if he had never
seen a football. George Bogue appears
in "The Swan" in the role of Father
Hyacinth.
It ought to be a good play. It prob
ably will be. And it is 110 more than
right and decent that, the dramatic
council be encouraged for such an ef
fort —particularly when, for most of
j the campus, it is a choice of going to
j "The Swan" or going to the movies,
j (And incidentally the movies butch
: ered this play by marrying off the girl
| to the tutor, all for the sake of a final
clinch.)
Anyhow, you know how we Rotari-
Sans feel about patronizing home in
! dustries.

j the campus, it is a choice of going to
j "The Swan" or going to the movies,
j (And incidentally the movies butch

Anyhow, you know how we Rotari-
Sans feel about patronizing home in
! dustries.
Since everyone goes out on Friday I
night anyhow, it is not too presumptu- I
tious to tell them where to go. Is it?
Particularly when one assumes the
paternal attitude of a politician ad- j
dressing his constituents and tells the !
dear people that he is acting in their j
best interests.
As we were saying, everyone is j
going out tonight anyhow. So we are (
going to risk incurring the emnity of J
the Palo Alto movie people, and ever j
so many purveyors of various means !
of entertainment in San Francisco to :
tell them where to go. We are also
going to risk accusations of under
hand publicity for the dramatic coun
cil. Ah! Now the cat's out of the bag.
Isn't it?

Of course everyone knows by this
time that "The Swan" is to be pre
sented tonight in the Assembly Hall.
And everyone knows that Franz Mol
nar wrote "The Swan." And nearly
everyone knows that Gordon Davis
is directing the present production.
And everyone should know that Doc
tor Margery Bailey is taking the part
of Princess Dominica. And everyone
who knows who Doctor Bailey is will
be there, and anyone who doesn't
would be crazy not to go and find out.
And if, knowing all Hiese things
there is still someone who is thinking

of going somewhere other than to
"The Swan" tonight, let him consider
that the cast includes Louise Buxton
and Sarah Margaret Burns and Ed
wina Ewing.
Now, everyone ought to be con
vinced. But on the bare supposition
that someone is not, there is another
ince'ntive. Have you ever gone to see
a great athlete on the stage? And
after you got there have you seen him
paddle around in a ten-foot tank, or
knock paper balls into the audience,
or spar furiously with an imaginary
opponent? If you have you will appre
ciate seeing an ail-American halfback
011 the stage who would have a legiti
mate right to be there if he had never
seen a football. George Bogue appears
in "The Swan" in the role of Father
Hyacinth.
It ought to be a good play. It prob
ably will be. And it is 110 more than
right and decent that, the dramatic
council be encouraged for such an ef
fort —particularly when, for most of
j the campus, it is a choice of going to
j "The Swan" or going to the movies,
