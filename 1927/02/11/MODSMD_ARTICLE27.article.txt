The Editor, Sii;.:
In perusing the "Daily" for January J
27, sent me by a friend now at college, j
I note with glee an organization being
perfected by the Men's House Man- j
agers. I would like to see such a plan
succeed and if they will permit can
point out the pitfalls some of their
predecessors fell into, so that they
may avoid some. I
During my three years of managing
the Delta Gamma, 1909 to 1912, Bob
Holiday, then manager of Phi Delta :
Theta, attempted a similar "Asso&ia- ,
lion" as we called it.
Utterly disgusted at the "holdup" of
the Paly merchants we called all man- j
agers together at the Delta Gamma j
House, elected officers, and took ,
orders from those who wanted to try
out the scheme of co-operative buying. '
We engineered one carload of case j
canned goods and, if I remember |
rightly, one of coal.
Our great difficulties were storage |
space and cash. We foolishly didn't :
collect cash with .the orders, which I
should by all means advise the new
group to do. Then none of the houses j
had sufficient pantry or storage space I
to keep whole stocks of supplies. It j
seems to me leasing some sort of j
store room on the campus should be j
at most the iirst official act of the
group.
How about inviting the women in
on the ground floor? You know the
women are the proverbial bargain
hounds, and women house managers

j might he able to offer some sound ad
vice wise suggestions.
Incidentally I rat-her imagine that
any valuable reduction in the high
j cost of present fraternity and sorority
life and any attempt to show business

acument and a practical application of
the theories passed out in Economics
Courses will improve the chances of
continuance of fraternity and sorority
life on the campus in the eyes of the
University authorities.
All success to the venture,
Sincerely, Mrs. James Wilson, '27.
