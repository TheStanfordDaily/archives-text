# SPORTS OF 1927

' Now, boys, take your marks! Get-t j
set!" —Bang! and away go anywhere 1
from four to forty lithe young athletes j
iu a soul-stirring, perhaps record- j
breaking foot-race, while John J. Mc-
Hugh, the dean of starters, reloads his
little nub-nosed revolver, all the while
watching with the keenest interest
the athletes in their mad scramble I
around the oval or over the hur- j
dies. For Johnny McHugh, who has I
started about 6000 races each year for
over a quarter of a century, not only
takes great pride in his work, but gets
a great thrill out of seeing the boys
of America gradually improve in com-;
petition, become champions, and then, !
later on, make good in their various i
business after they quit ath-;
lotics. "It makes me feel that all my
work has not been in vain," 'Mac' told
me recently. I can vouch from per-'
sonal experience that he is a splendid i
starter, for after accidentally "jump- i
ing the gun" on him once, I learned ]
never to do it again.
Johunv McHugh has started every j
manner of race from a girls' foot-race i
to a cross-country airplane race—ex- |
cent a dog race. He was the first, I
believe, to send the athletes off their j
marks by taking a position at the side j
of the track in front of the runners, i
instead of behind them. This manner '
of starting has proved so successful
that . oon it will be adopted every- j
where as official. "Mac" had the honor !
of being the first American to start i
races in the Olymnic games in Europe, j
and officially opened the competition
in Paris in 1924 by shooting his short- j
barreled, 32-caliber gat for the trial j
heats of the 400-meter hurdle race.
Which reminds me of Capt. Uggla, i
whom I met on an athletic trip in
Scandinavia in 1916. The dapper little
Swede had started the races in the'
1912 Olympics with a pistol that was j
connected electrically with the timers' j

I watches. He proceeded to show us
' around Stockholm, and his idea of
| starting the evening off right was to
I shave off half his mustache and write
his name and address on his starched
shirt-bosom! A great guy, Capt. Uggla.
He wanted to be sure to get home
' safely.
John McHugh showed me a letter
from E. A. Hunter, 0.8. E., "Honorable
i Secretary of the British Olympic Asso
i ciation, patron! His Majesty the King,
j etc. . . . etc., etc.," who always starts
races with an old-fashioned muzzle
loader with caps. I understand that
j the boys from Cornell and Princeton
! were nearly knocked loose from their
i spikes the first timte they heard the
Hon. Secretary's cannon pop in the
dual meet with Oxford and Cambridge
last year. (No, that is not meant to be
| a portrait of Mr. Hunter.)
