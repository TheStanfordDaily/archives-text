## 
### 
Playing three of his own numbers
for the organ, together with works of
both modern and classical composers,
IMetro Yon, organist at the St. Xavier
Church of New York, appeared in re
cital yesterday at the Memorial
Church under the auspices of the
Committee on Public Exercises.
The wide range of the numbers
played gave Mr. Yon's concert an un
usual degree of interest. All tastes in
music were pleased by the scope of
numbers lying between Johann Sebas
tian Bach's Prelude and Fugue and
Yon's "L'Organo Primitivo."
Perhaps the outstanding numbers
of the performance were the "Sonata
Romantico." a composition of the art
ist's own. and R. Renzi's "Toccata,"
written by the titular organist at St.
Peter's in Rome. Both these selections
wero of somewhat the same type of
lightness and brililiance.
The la<it two Yon numbers played,
"Minuetf.o Antico e Musetta" and
"L'Organo Primitivo," wore well re
ceived. Each was clevery written, the
Minuetto and Musetto contrasting
very well, while the imitation of the
music of the old portable organs of
tie twelfth century in "L'Organo,"
played softly with strongly marked
rhythm, had a well-inarked humor in
i's effect.
