# BREAKERS TAKESTOP OF LEAGUE IV WHEN ENCINA 1E DEFAULTS
## El Campo Beats Delta Taus; Branner Downs Chinese In Evening Game 
### 
Breakers eased into the champion
ship of League IV from Encina IE via
the forfeit route in the intramural
basketball play yesterday, while El
Campo took second place in the league
with a win over the Delts. Branner II
downed the Chinese Club in the eve
ning, completing the season's play in
this league.
El Campo made an 11-8 win over
Delta Tau Delta. Beardsley exhibited
great facility for looping the ball
through the basket from mid-floor and
was high-point, man, with five tallies.
Vincent, Gallagher, and Martin
formed the Delta Tau scoring combi
nation, but had difficulty in getting
the ball away. Hobro for the winners
showed as good floorwork as any man
in the lineup.
Branner Beats Chinese
In the only game played in the eve
ning Branner II decisively defeated
the Chinese Club 20-6. For the first
period, the playing was even, but very
ragged, and the half ended with Bran
ner on the long end of a 5-4 score.
However, the hall men forged ahead
early in the second half, and by excel
lent pass work, ran up fifteen points
while holding the Chinese to a lone
field goal. Pan showed the best ability
on the club team, being the only one
who could hit the basket; Rude and
Arnstein played best for Branner and
shared high-point honors with six
apiece.
Schedule of tomorrow's games is as
follows: Chi Psi vs. Cardinals, 4:15;
Sigma Chi vs. Japanese Club, 4:50,
