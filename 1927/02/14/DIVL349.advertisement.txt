To the well-groomed woman her gloves are of utmost
importance and no street costume is complete without
them. Now the latest importations show hand-stitch
mg and better gloves are evident by their hand-stitched

and slip-ons are straight with pinked edges. Indeed,
the new imports are literally smart to their very finger
tips —for hand-stitching is the mode of the hour.

fancy, some with beaded cuffs, in pull-on style—sadlers
stitch in black—greys and tans predominate. \
The prices, we will assure you, will not cause any
discomfort, for they are very reasonable.
