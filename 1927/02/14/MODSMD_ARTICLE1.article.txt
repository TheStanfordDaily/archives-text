in League V by trouncing the Japa
nese Club in a slow game, 28 to 6. Chi
Psi finished in second place in the
league by downing the Cardinals, 37
to 9.
Clyne and Menzies made up a com
bination that spelled nothing but de
feat to the Cardinal quintet, the for
mer accounting for seventeen points,
and the latter for sixteen. Weak guard
ing on the part of the Independents
allowed Menzies to come under the
basket, where he was able to get the
ball without any trouble and drop it
into (he hoop..
In the first half, Chi Psi scored ten
field £oals and a free throw, holding
the Cardinals to one goal and one free
throw. There was never any doubt re
garding the outcome of the game, for
the fraternity men kept up a strong
defense, quick to take advantage of
bail passes and fumbles, and an offen
sive attack that was fast and accurate.
The last period ended with the Cardi-1
nals boosting up their total six more
points, while the Chi Psi team kept up
their accurate shooting from under
the basket.
Strong Defense
Brockway and West were the best
men for the Cardinals, showing fast
floorwork, but could not time their
passes to keep them from the Chi Psi
guards. King kept up a good game at
forward for the winners, while Walker,
Ankeb, and Bellows produced a nearly
airtight defense.
Winning its game by a wide margin,
Sigma Chi held the Japanese Club
scoreless for the first half, and allowed
it but three baskets during the last.
Endo, Japanese center, played the best
game for the losers, but could not
make his long shots count. The high
point man of the game was Bowers,
center, who made six points in the
first period and ten in the last. Brady
and Clarke were a clever pair of for
wards. but, as in the preceding game,
the center did a great part of the
scoring.
Good Opposition
The Japanese, although outclassed
in weight and height, put up a hard
fight throughout the contest. Horii at
forward and Asakura at guard showed
their opponents plenty of opposition
at every point.

Chi Psi 37 —Cardinals 9
Sigma Chi 28—Japanese Club 6
Playing their last same before en
tering the quarter finals, the Sigma
Chi five kept its hold on first place
in League V by trouncing the Japa
nese Club in a slow game, 28 to 6. Chi
Psi finished in second place in the
league by downing the Cardinals, 37
to 9.
Clyne and Menzies made up a com
bination that spelled nothing but de
feat to the Cardinal quintet, the for
mer accounting for seventeen points,
and the latter for sixteen. Weak guard
ing on the part of the Independents
allowed Menzies to come under the
basket, where he was able to get the
ball without any trouble and drop it
into (he hoop..
In the first half, Chi Psi scored ten
field £oals and a free throw, holding
the Cardinals to one goal and one free
throw. There was never any doubt re
garding the outcome of the game, for
the fraternity men kept up a strong
defense, quick to take advantage of
bail passes and fumbles, and an offen
sive attack that was fast and accurate.
The last period ended with the Cardi-1
nals boosting up their total six more
points, while the Chi Psi team kept up
their accurate shooting from under
the basket.
Strong Defense
Brockway and West were the best
men for the Cardinals, showing fast
floorwork, but could not time their
passes to keep them from the Chi Psi
guards. King kept up a good game at
forward for the winners, while Walker,
Ankeb, and Bellows produced a nearly
airtight defense.
Winning its game by a wide margin,
Sigma Chi held the Japanese Club
scoreless for the first half, and allowed
it but three baskets during the last.
Endo, Japanese center, played the best
game for the losers, but could not
make his long shots count. The high
point man of the game was Bowers,
center, who made six points in the
first period and ten in the last. Brady
and Clarke were a clever pair of for
wards. but, as in the preceding game,
the center did a great part of the
scoring.
Good Opposition
The Japanese, although outclassed
in weight and height, put up a hard
fight throughout the contest. Horii at
forward and Asakura at guard showed
their opponents plenty of opposition
at every point.
