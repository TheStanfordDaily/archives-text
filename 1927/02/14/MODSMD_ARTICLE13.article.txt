# OGDEN WINS SECOND POSITION ON VARSITY NET SQUAD RANKING
## 
### 
Lionel Ogden continued his rise up
ward from fourth place on the varsity
tennis squad by beating Alan Herring
ton for second position in straight
sets 6-4, 6-2, Friday afternoon.
The match was a duel from the
backcourt, neither player advancing
often to the net. For this reason the
play lacked the sparkle and fire char
acteristic of a volleying attack, but
there were many long rallies.
