# CAMPUS CROSSINGS GIVEN STOP SIGNS; STREETS LABELED
## 
### 
Boulevard stop signs are being
placed at all cross streets enter
ing the Row, and at the crossing
of Embarcadero Road and the
State Highway. It has not yet
been decided whether or not a
stop will be made at the inter
section of Palm Drive and the
Highway.
Filling a long felt need, signs
bearing the names of the streets
are being set up all over the
campus. The installation of both
sets of signs is expected to be
completed this week.
A total of fifty-nine posts will
be placed. They will be painted
black.
