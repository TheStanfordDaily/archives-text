# SCORING ABILITY OF BEAR CUBS SPELLS DEFEAT FOR BABES
## Stanford Team Slow to Get Under Way; California Piles Up Points 
### 
The deadly scoring ability of the
California freshman basketball five
brought defeate to the Cardinal babes
by a 40 to 22 score in the first game
of the California-Stanford freshmen
series Friday night in Harmon Gym
nasium.
First Scores
In the first half the California be
ginners made eight out of fifteen
tries for field goals and in the second
half they were just as accurate. The
score at the end of the first twenty
minutes stood IS to 14 in favor of
California.
The Stanford men could not get
under way until after the middle of
the first, half had passed. This enabled
the Bear Cubs to establish enough of
a lead to withstand the later efforts
of the Cardinal freshmen.
Second Half
In the second half the Stanford
players regained their poise and
showed some clever floorwork, espe
cially on tip-offs. Thompson, hampered
by a cut hand, played a forcible guard
ing game, and Captain Berg was the
outstanding forward. Stewart, who was
sent in during the second half for
Bush, was unable to find his range
for the basket, but this can be over
looked because of the fight that he
put in the rest of the team.
Two More Games
Coach Hunt's men have two more
cracks at the California team, one next
Friday night and the other a week
from then.
