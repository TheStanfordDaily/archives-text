# CHRIST'S SERMON ON MOUNT DISCUSSED BY THEODORE P. SOARES
## 
### 
"Can the Sermon on the Mount
mean anything in practical, modern
life?" was the question discussed by
Dr. Theodore Gerald Soares, professor
of Homiletics and Religious Educa
tion at the University of Chicago, in
his sermon at the Memorial Church
yesterday.
"Christianity has been tried; it was
tried by Jesus before it was promul
gated. The Sermon on the Mount was
an autobiography, the sequence of
Jesus' life, and of a wonderful walk
with Cod," said Dr. Soares.
"Wealth can't be settled by Brad
street. A man's wealth is determined
by what he has that moths can't eat
and rust can't corrupt and thieves
can't steal. Jesus' sayings simply
mean that you should go down to the
bottom of your own heart, find what
>ou believe most, and then live by
that."
