# CARDS DOWNED BY AGGRESSIVE FRESNO OUTFIT
## Stanford Listless in First Half; Shows Burst of Power in Second OPPONENTS PLAY HARD Victors Break 21-All Tie as Pistol Announces End Of Contest 
### Fred Speers 
j By a score that did not quite tell
j the story, Fresno State defeated Stan
| ford's Cardinals 23 to 21 in the pavilion
; last Saturday night. Only a small
I crowd was on hand to watch Stan
| ford's ragged opening, the reassuring
• burst of power in the second half, and
! the final basket that broke the 21-all
| tie as the gun cracked ending the
i game.
Fresno Leads Off
It was all Fresno in the first half,
the Cardinals trailing 12 to 6 as the
I first period ended. Stanford started
! slow and sluggish, losing the ball time
and again to an aggressive hard-play-
I ing visitor. Fresno was out for blood
! while the Cardinals seemed merely to
| be playing another scheduled game.
, David and Bryant started at forward
j with Jayred at center.
| Vincenti and Anderson were the
| only men in the Cardinal lineup who
seemed to be in form for the contest.
Hunt quickly sent in a new set of
forwards, when after about five min
utes of play it was easily seen that
Stanford's attack was not up to form,
j Christ and McCandless went in for
| Bryant and David, The score then was
I Fresno 5, Stanford 2.
Field Goals
McCandless quickly sank a field
| goal, and play speeded up until Wil
i hemsen, Fresno ace, sank a long shot
{ from the center of the floor. This was
; one of four long drops were later
| to aid Fresno in preparing for the
! tally of the seeond half. He followed
i a moment later with another long
shot, and Andrews added a short field
! goal to put Fresno humming away at
I 11-4 with half time not far off.
It was Christ who, denied a field j
goal because of a foul, sank his two
free throws to end the Cards' scoring |
for the half.
Faster Play
The second half saw a speeding up :
of the play, a better Stanford passing 1
attack, and some passable shooting on ;
the part of the Cardinals. Three free i
throws, and two more long shots, were
enough to put Fresno 'way in the ;
lead at 18 to 8. It was then that Hunt's !
men began their rally, running up
eleven points to one for Fresno, which ;
was enough to put the Cardinals in the
lead once —but not enough to win.
Jayred looked better in the second
half, and McCandless, before he was
jerked on personals, accounted for
several Stanford scores. With Mc-
Candless out, Hunt sent in Vincenti
to work at forward, and the regular |
running guard turned in a good game, 1
showing especially well on defensive |
play. Bryant had previously gone in !
for Christ and these two men seemed j

to work well together. Biaggini was
sent in for Anderson early in the sec
ond half.
Stanford Rally
Stanford's rally brought the score
to 19-all, despite Fresno's attempt to
stall. It was largely Lewis and Vin
centi who broke up the visitors' stall
ing work. Bryant, taking a long pass
from Jayred, put Stanford ahead with
the end of the game not far away.
Then Burr, Fresno center, dupli
cated Christ's earlier feat of sinking
two free throws at a crucial moment.
Lewis, a second later, lost his chance
on a free throw to break the tie. Then
Burr won the game as the pistol
sounded. A short drop shot from the
sidelines did the trick.

j By a score that did not quite tell
j the story, Fresno State defeated Stan
| ford's Cardinals 23 to 21 in the pavilion
; last Saturday night. Only a small
I crowd was on hand to watch Stan

• burst of power in the second half, and
! the final basket that broke the 21-all
| tie as the gun cracked ending the
i game.
Fresno Leads Off
It was all Fresno in the first half,
the Cardinals trailing 12 to 6 as the
I first period ended. Stanford started
! slow and sluggish, losing the ball time
and again to an aggressive hard-play-
I ing visitor. Fresno was out for blood
! while the Cardinals seemed merely to
| be playing another scheduled game.
, David and Bryant started at forward
j with Jayred at center.
| Vincenti and Anderson were the
| only men in the Cardinal lineup who
seemed to be in form for the contest.
Hunt quickly sent in a new set of
forwards, when after about five min
utes of play it was easily seen that
Stanford's attack was not up to form,
j Christ and McCandless went in for
| Bryant and David, The score then was
I Fresno 5, Stanford 2.
Field Goals
McCandless quickly sank a field
| goal, and play speeded up until Wil
i hemsen, Fresno ace, sank a long shot
{ from the center of the floor. This was
; one of four long drops were later
| to aid Fresno in preparing for the
! tally of the seeond half. He followed
i a moment later with another long
shot, and Andrews added a short field
! goal to put Fresno humming away at
I 11-4 with half time not far off.
It was Christ who, denied a field j
goal because of a foul, sank his two
free throws to end the Cards' scoring |
for the half.
Faster Play
The second half saw a speeding up :
of the play, a better Stanford passing 1
attack, and some passable shooting on ;
the part of the Cardinals. Three free i
throws, and two more long shots, were
enough to put Fresno 'way in the ;
lead at 18 to 8. It was then that Hunt's !
men began their rally, running up
eleven points to one for Fresno, which ;
was enough to put the Cardinals in the
lead once —but not enough to win.
Jayred looked better in the second
half, and McCandless, before he was
jerked on personals, accounted for
several Stanford scores. With Mc-
Candless out, Hunt sent in Vincenti
to work at forward, and the regular |
running guard turned in a good game, 1
showing especially well on defensive |
play. Bryant had previously gone in !
for Christ and these two men seemed j

to work well together. Biaggini was
sent in for Anderson early in the sec
ond half.
Stanford Rally
Stanford's rally brought the score
to 19-all, despite Fresno's attempt to
stall. It was largely Lewis and Vin
centi who broke up the visitors' stall
ing work. Bryant, taking a long pass
from Jayred, put Stanford ahead with
the end of the game not far away.
Then Burr, Fresno center, dupli
cated Christ's earlier feat of sinking
two free throws at a crucial moment.
Lewis, a second later, lost his chance
on a free throw to break the tie. Then
Burr won the game as the pistol
sounded. A short drop shot from the
sidelines did the trick.
