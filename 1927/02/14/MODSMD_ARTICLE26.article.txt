# In the Wrong Direction

### 
Sophomore control over freshmen in universities is once again
brought to our attention, brom the great Northwest where "men are
men, etc.," comes the cry for traditions, and more traditions.
1 he University of Washington is just two steps behind the advancing
universities of the country. Stanford et al have had freshmen rulings
for a number of years, and at last have come to the conclusion that
these regulations are wrong, and have started, and succeeded to some
extent, in doing away with freshman discipline.
But Washington is just inaugurating "Thou Shalt Nots." Last week
the Senior Council passed the following rules, which will be enforced by
"a group of husky sophomores": "1. No freshman shall talk with women
on the campus. 2. No freshmen shall walk on the grass. 3. No freshmen
shall smoke on the campus. 4. No freshmen shall stand on Denny steps."
Besides these rules there is the universal commandment that all first-year
men must wear green hats while on the campus.
The Washington Daily asks the question: "Are the sophs sufficiently
inspired to take the responsibility into their hands to use their preroga
tive wisely, to prove to the University that frosh punishment is desired ?"
1 he paper goes on to say, "A few good effective paddlings should go a
long way toward taking the cockiness out of some of the strutting babes.
The official status of the first-year men with regard to smoking, talking
to girls, and other evils, will be up to the sophs to decide."
In a few years, depending upon how fast the University of Washing
ton advances, the Senior Council and the students (that is, the thinking
ones) will see how useless, and how ridiculous it is to force yourig men
who have almost reached their majority to obey silly little traditions.
Some few will say that the University is going to ruin because the long
maintained traditions arc at their death-stake. But the Senior Council
will see fit to abolish the four commandments that were enacted last week.
And then the freshman can walk across the grass, with a cigarette in
his mouth, and a girl on his arm. What's the difference?
