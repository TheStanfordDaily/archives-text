# Let Us Love

Classes will be held as usual today, despite the fact that it is Valen
tine's Day. In celebrating the birthday of Lincoln, we recognize industry,
and perseverence, and fairness. On Washington's birthday we honor
bravery, organization, and truth. But today we worship love.
St. Valentine's Day is named for a Christian martyr of the Roman
period. The custom of exchanging missives of love and affection is
believed to have been handed down from the Roman festival of Luper
calla celebrated in the month of February, when the names of young
women were put into a box and drawn out by men as chance directed.
For many centuries Saint Valentine's Eve was celebrated in a manner
very similar to the fashion of Roman heathen times, maids and bachelors j
throwing billets with their names inscribed on them into a receptacle and j
drawing therefrom the name of someone of the opposite sex, who there
upon became for the year following the 'Valentine," or chosen com
panion, of the more or less lucky individual.
In these modern times Valentine sentiments are telegraphed about the
world. The Daily, always aiming to please, will offer a few suggestions
of telegraphic messages that could be transmitted to the sweetheart at
home: "I like you, I love you, I want you all the time, so please wire me
back that you'll be my Valentine"; or, "I lost my heart around some
where. Just give me yours and I'll call it square," or, "Pretty maiden most
divine, will you be my Valentine." We could suggest others, but no man
or woman should have more than three such messages to send today.
