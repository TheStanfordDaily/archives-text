# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, â€™16 
It was just about a year ago that
most of us first heard of young Miss
Virginia Van Wie, of the Beverly
Country Club of Chicago. It was then
that the sport news from Florida told
of a 17-year-old girl of that name who
had won the Florida state women's
golf championship at the Palm Beach
Golf Club. Glenna Collett, the winner
for the three preceding years, did not
defend her title, so no extraordinary
prowess was credited to the new cham
pion.
But, after another newcomer into
the limelight, Miss Dorothy Klotz (also
of Chicago), had won the South At
lantic championship at Ormond Beach,
the ladies packed their golf clubs and
their lipsticks over to St. Augustine
to play in the Florida East Coast
tournament. There Miss Klotz won
the qualifying medal and went on to
eliminate Mrs. Hurd, a former na
tional champion, in the second round.
So when Miss Van Wie met Miss
Klotz in the semi-final round, there
were very few who gave the young
lady from the Beverly Country Club a
chance, for hadn't her opponent beaten
Glenna Collett, Mary Browne, and Dor-

I othy Campbell Kurd within the space
j of a week? The next day little 17-year
! old Virginia met the Great Glenna in
; the finals, and these two young ladies
put up the best exhibition of women's
j golf ever seen in the oldest city in the
United States, and perhaps in the
I whole United States, too.
Playing with a total absence of awe
in the presence of one of the "Immor
| tals," and showing a coolness under
: fire that would do justice to Walter
i Hagen, Virginia kept pace with the
J champion off the tee, outdistanced her
with irons}, and putted with a fine,
j smooth, unhurried stroke that was at
| least the equal of her famous oppo
nent. The result was that this un
known youngster not only carried
] Glenna to the nineteenth green, but
defeated her as well!
Next week comes the South Atlantic
championship at Ormond Beach, and
then the Florida Toast title-play at St.
Augustine. Will this sturdy little miss
be able to repeat her triumphs of last
year and go on to win new honors?
That she is in good form was shown
on February 2, when she set a new
record for the reconstructed course
i at Ormond Beach with a fine 79.
