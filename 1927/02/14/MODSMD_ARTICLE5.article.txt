# CRITIC COMMENDS "SWAN" AS POLISHED PRODUCTION
## 
### Stephen O’Donnell 
Ordinarily, when a critic is sent to
review a coll ge presentation of a
first-class drama, he suspects his
editor of conspiring to make him un
popular. For, ordinarily, when a uni
versity community attempts to pro
duce a first-class play, the critic who
reviews tliat play cannot help but
notice the contrast between the polish
and finish of the lines and certain
amateurish little flaws in the' per
formance.
Yet, here is a critic who is about
to voice his opinion of "The Swan,"
Franz Molnar's satire, which was pre
sented Friday night by Masquers So
ciety, and —lo! and behold! — the man
is happy with his job. For the campus
cast, and Gordon Davis, and Leslie
Kiler combined to produce "The
Swan" in a manner that was quite
worthy of Molnar, a manner that
gives the critic very little of which to
complain.
Davis Recognized
By this time, of course, Gordon
Davis is quite generally recognized as
a producer of good plays. But of late
he has been confining himself to
lighter things, possibly—just possibly,
understand —because the gods of the
campus gallery have not looked with
favor, in the past, on his more am
bitious attempts. The fault, in this
instance, lies not with the man but
with the corduroy-clad deities. "The
Swan" proved it.
» Dr. Bailey Outstanding
The cast of "The Swan" is unani
mously deserving of congratulations.
But in case one is in search of details

there are a few specific compliments
to he paid.
The performance of Doctor Margery
Bailey, Stanford alumna and professor
of English, for instance. As Princess
Maria Dominica, Miss Bailey fully jus
tified the optimistic predictions made
before Friday's performance. She
made the audience feel that Dominica
was the mistress of Central European
intrigue, and she did it without once
raising her voice or waving her arms.
Not once did she overdo the part of
the busy dowager. Miss Bailey's best
work was done in the final lines of
the play, when Dominica delivers a
long speech to her prospective daugh
ter-in-law, Alexandra.
Bogue Equally Good
George Bogue as Father Hyacinth
was equally as good as Doctor Bailey,
and his performance was more of a
surprise. Bogue's part was a great
departure from his real personality.
Yet he grasped the spirit of his role
with a remarkable understanding. The
audience, most of them familiar with
Geoi'ge Bogue, the all-American half
back, was unable to see the actor
under his part. Father Hyacinth was
as real as though he had been im
ported from a monastery for the occa
sion.
Sarah Margaret Burns added a chap
ter to what is promising to be a highly
successful dramatic history by her
portrayal of Alexandra. She had the
good fortune to be particularly well
cast. Miss Burns approached profes
sional standards in her interpretation
of the coll and aloof princess, who,
for her grace and beauty, was called
The Swan. She reached dramatic
heights in the second act, wherein the
woman breaks through the cultivated
reserve of the princess.
Louise Buxton as Princess Beatrice,
mother of Alexandra, acquitted her
self creditably in a part that was ex
tremely difficult. She portrayed, in a
realistic manner, the high emotional
pitch of an ambitious mother the suc
cess of whose schemes is uncertain.
Role Well-Handled
Sam Hayes, as the tutor, Doctor
Nicholas Agi, handled a most difficult
role in an adept manner. The nature
of his part was such as to demand a
display of intense emotions through a
carefully preserved reserve. It calls
for repression. And not many ama
teurs are capable of employing this
means of dramatic expression. That
Hayes did so well speaks favorably
both for himself and his director.
Garth Winslow as Prince Albert
would have been better but for the
more dominating personalities around
him. He made the prince a trifle weak
er than the people around him, thus
causing certain situations to lose
somewhat in dramatic value. There
was really nothing particularly wrong
with his performance. He simply was
surrounded by actors who were a trifle
stronger.
The parts of Dr. Agi's two pupils,
George and Arsene, were taken by
Paul Speegle and Dan Smith, respec
tively. Both were good, the former
particularly so, although in due justice
it must be admitted that he had the
better lines.
Tends to Overact
Edwina Ewing as Symphrosia had a
slight tendency to overact. She appar
ently was still a under the influ
ence of the part she portrayed in
"The Book of Charm" last quarter.
Her manner was more that of a small
town woman than that of a noble
woman.
