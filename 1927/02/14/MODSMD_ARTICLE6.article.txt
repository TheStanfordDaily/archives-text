# POLY TEAM DEFEATS DECIMATED FRESHMAN NINE IN CLOSE GAME
## Practically Half of Squad Declared Ineligible at Last Moment 
### 
Disrupted shortly before the game
by receipt of an eligibility list declar
ing practically half the squad ineligi
ble, the Cardinal freshman baseball
nine nevertheless gave San Francisco
Polytechnic a close contest Saturday
morning, finally losing 4-2. The fresh
men managed to hold Poly scoreless
except in the eighth.
Only Ten Men
Losing a regular pitcher, first and
second basemen, and most of the out
field on short notice, the 1930 men
could muster but ten players in all,
forming a rather shaky combination
at times. Laird bolstered up the team
greatly with play around third and
also showed up well on the bases, be
sides knocking a two-bagger in the
ninth.
Leverenz: pitched a nice game, pull
ing successfully out of frequent holes,
and was ably helped behind the plate
by Ben Sparks, who showed an ac
curate peg to second. Levin, trans
ferred from the outfield, fitted in well
at first.
Poor Batting
Both outfits were weak at the bat,
no one getting a hit until the sixth,
when Poly began hitting. Stanford's
first run came in the fifth when Laird
drew a base 011 balls, stole two bases,
and scored as Sturm went out. Bianclii
got another walk in the seventh, stole
a base, and scored on a fielder's
choice.
