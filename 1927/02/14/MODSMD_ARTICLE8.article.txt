# STANFORD BASEBALL TEAM TAKES DECISIVE WIN AT SANTA CLARA
## Steve Collins, Clark Sypher Make Effective Battery; Team Plays Well 
### 
Captain Steve Collins led the
Stanford varsity baseball team to a
5 to 1 victory over the University of
Santa Clara nine on the San Jose field
Saturday afternoon by giving a good
exhibition of pitching, as well as of
excellent hitting.
Playing behind the bat for nine in
nings, Sypher played a good game of
ball, doing well on fouls and on throws
from the plate. The whole team
showed up well, using clever fielding
and hard hitting.
Runs in Fourth
The first three innings were score
less, the Cardinals making their first
three runs in the fourth, by hits from
Garibaldi, Busch, Nissen, Harder, and
Collins. The Broncos made their only
run by a hit in the fourth inning, fol
lowed by a wild pitch, a balk, and a
passed ball.
Captain Collins was responsible for
another Stanford run in the sixth in
ning, when he singled to right field,
scoring Nissen. The last score was
due to fast base-stealing, Garibaldi
scoring when he and Nissen used a
double steal.
Santa Clara used two pitchers,
Draper and Simoni, in an effort to
stop the Cardinals, but to no avail.
Collins and Sypher were the Stanford
battery for the entire game.
