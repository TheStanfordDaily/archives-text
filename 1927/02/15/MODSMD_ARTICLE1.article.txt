Varsity Basketball Captain Nel
son David is sick with a slight
attack of influenza. He did not re
port for practice last night but it
is expected that he will be on the
court in uniform for practice to
night.

Minus a captain, Coach 1 Husky Hunt
last night sent his varsity cage squad
through a stiff workout in an effort
to point out and eradicate as much as
possible the defects displayed in last
Saturday's game with Fresno State
College. Every Cardinal on the floor
in that contest seemed to have an "off
night," and Hunt does not want that
to happen again in the initial clash of
the California series next Friday
night.
Scrimmages Planned
Coach Hunt went back to his scrim
mage practice game schedule, used in
preparation for the U.S.C. series a
couple of weeks ago. The Breakers in
tramural team, supplemented by sev
eral varsity players, was used for
scrimage last night.
As a starting lineup the Cardinal
mentor used Bryant and Christ, for
wards, Jayred, center, and Vincenti
and Anderson, guards. This looks to
be the best five to start against the
Bears. Bryant did most of the Cardi
nal scoring by sinking several short
shots under the basket.
Worden Good
Breakers displayed a powerful guard
in the form of Worden who time and
again checked Stanford forwards by
doggedly close work. Mac Donald, cen
ter, and Cook, forward, also turned in
good games for the club team. Both
are light and fast with good eyes for
the basket. Rodney George, intramural
free-throw contest winner of last
year, was taken, from the game with
an injured leg.
To fill in the club team several var
sity men were used, Price and Crary
at the opening of the game, and later
Sexson and Sibbet were sent in.
