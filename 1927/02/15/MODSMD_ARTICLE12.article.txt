# Professor Holmes Cancels Lecture; Lutz Will Speak
## 
### 
Professor Ralph Lutz of the His
tory department will lecture in the
Little Theatre at 7:.'lU tonight in lieu
of Professor Samuel J. Holmes of the
University of California who was com
pelled to cancel his engagement on
account of an attack of influenza.
Professor Lutz, who has recently
returned from an extensive continen
tal tour, will speak on the subject,
"Contemporary Political Conditions in
Europe." Professor Holmes was to
speak 011 the "Eugenics and Civiliza
tion."
The Stanford professor was in Eu
rope the latter part of last year
gathering material for the Hoover
War Memorial Library. In this capa
city he was enabled to meet and talk
with the leaders of practically every
country in Europe, thus obtaining an
intimate glimpse of the political con
ditions there. His training as a his
torian and student of modern affairs
has made him an accurate and capable
observer of the conditions he encoun
tered on his trip.
The lecture was scheduled for a
later date, but Professor Lutz met the
emergency by speaking tonight.
