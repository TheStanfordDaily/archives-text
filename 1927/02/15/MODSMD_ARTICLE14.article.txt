# DOCTOR WARNS UPON FALSE HEALTH VIGOR

### 
If you feel full of "vim, vigor, and i
vitality," if you have done your daily .
dozen and repeated to yourself some ;
little success formula to give you the I
"bigger and better" attitude, do not
feel too sure of yourself; you have not (
done everything necessary to main- j
tain good health, warns Dr. Richard |
Bolt of the public health department |
of the University of California.
"Too many people have listened too j
eagerly to physical culture extremists; |
they have been lulled into a false j
sense of security by the doctrine of j
physical fitness," he explains. "It is a |
very desirable thing, but is not the
whole of the effort Essential to main
taining good health. Infection must
be avoided, diet must be intelligently
chosen, and if sickness does come it
must bo properly treated.
"There is an unwarranted assump- j
tion that physical exercises, whether i
of the formal or informal type, have in j
themselves health value by which they
confer resistance to disease. This can i
be so only in a limited or restricted j
way. It has no effect on immunity, or j
on tumor growths, and probably little j
on degenerative diseases."
