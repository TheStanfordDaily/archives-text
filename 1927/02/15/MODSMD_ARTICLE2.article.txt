# WARREN D.ALLEN TO GIVE FIVE NUMBERS OF ROBERT SCHUMANN
## 
### 
Five compositions of Robert Schu
mann will constitute the program to
be played at 4:15 this afternoon in the
Memorial Church by Warren D. Allen,
University organist.
The first number on this afternoon's
program will be one of the six fugues
written by the composer on the name
of Bach (Op. J)0, No. 1). The piece de
rives its name from the fact that the
composer derived the idea for the keys
through which he carries the theme
•of the fugue from the letters in Bach's
name. This is made possible by the
fact that in German musical notation
the letter H is used to indicate our
key of B natural.
Next will be played two canons from
Opus 56, No. 5 in B Minor and No. 6
in B Major. These will be followed
by a Sketch in F Minor.
The last two numbers on the pro
grain ;ire the "Evening Song" (Abend
lied) and the Finale from the "Sym
phonic Etudes." The organ arrange
ment for the last-named number is the
work of William T. Best.
