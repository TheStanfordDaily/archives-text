Alpha Delta Phi cinched its hold on
first place in League II by defeating
its only challengers, Alpha Sigma Phi,
by the score of 27 to 9. In League I
the Sequoia I five emerged victorious,
although they did not play last night.
Phi Kappa Psi nosed out Encina
3W's team in the first of the after
noon's games by a 7 # to 5 score. The
contest was a slow one with neither
outfit displaying much defensive
strength or scoring power. Speegle for
the freshmen played the best floor
game.
Delta Chi and El Capitan were the
participants in the fastest battle of
the matinee program. The fraternity
team was consistently superior and
won with sixteen counters to El Capi
tan's nine. Paxton, for the winners,
and Rode, opposing forward, were the
whole show in their spectacular shoot
ing. Paxton was accountable for
twelve points and the other man made
eight.
Branner I and Phi Sigma Kappa
staged a dribbling contest in the last
of the afternoon affairs, the former
sneaking through a 10 to 7 win. The
game contained plenty of action, but
was not burdened with an abundance
of good basketball on the part of
either faction. Toward the end of the
second half, however, things bright
ened up, and the two teams staged a
real battle.
Out of a wild scrambling under the
baskets, with everyone hitting at the
ball and no one trying to get it, the
Sequoia I quintet managed to take the
lead over Theta Chi at the end of the
half 9 to 4. The play was ragged, in
cluding inaccurate long shots, bad
passing, and 110 dribbling.
The teams tightened up in the sec
ond half when Duncan and Kopp
brought the Theta Chis to one point
behind the leaders. The game dragged
on for awhile, no one doing any scor
ing, until Reasor and Beason shot the
fraternity five ahead with two field
goals in the last few minutes of play.
For the Sequoia team, Mack and
Newland did all the scoring, while the
scoring for the winners was scattered
among Duncan, Reasor, Kopp, Carr,
and Beason. Carr and Reasor showed
up well during the play, both in of
fense and defense.
Alpha Delta Phi won the right to
represent League II in the intramural
elimination play-offs by beating Alpha
Sig by the decisive score of 27 to 3.
The game began with a fast start,
dose guarding, and a rushing attack.
Ferguson for the Alph aSigs started
the scoring by a beautiful arched :>hot.
The score at the end of the first
period was 7 to 2, in favor of the
Alpha Delts; in the last half, Moore,
Holman, and Duckett started off on a
scoring spree, making 19 points be
tween them. These three kept the
Alpha Sigs 011 defense during most of
the game, Dennis and Meeks ably
doing the guarding for the winners.
Ferguson did most of the work for
the losers, although he was taken
from the game because of personal
fouls. Campbell was a fair rival of
Dennis for guarding honors. Conroy
and Muller were better in offensive
play than in stopping their opponents,
but neither could find the range of
the basket.
Yesterday's games completed the
preliminary contests in the intramural
play. The following games are to be
played off in an elimination tourna
ment:
Wed. 4:15 —Alpha Delta Phi vs.

Alpha Delta Phi cinched its hold on
first place in League II by defeating
its only challengers, Alpha Sigma Phi,
by the score of 27 to 9. In League I
the Sequoia I five emerged victorious,
although they did not play last night.
Phi Kappa Psi nosed out Encina
3W's team in the first of the after
noon's games by a 7 # to 5 score. The
contest was a slow one with neither
outfit displaying much defensive
strength or scoring power. Speegle for
the freshmen played the best floor
game.
Delta Chi and El Capitan were the
participants in the fastest battle of
the matinee program. The fraternity
team was consistently superior and
won with sixteen counters to El Capi
tan's nine. Paxton, for the winners,
and Rode, opposing forward, were the
whole show in their spectacular shoot
ing. Paxton was accountable for
twelve points and the other man made
eight.
Branner I and Phi Sigma Kappa
staged a dribbling contest in the last
of the afternoon affairs, the former
sneaking through a 10 to 7 win. The
game contained plenty of action, but
was not burdened with an abundance
of good basketball on the part of
either faction. Toward the end of the
second half, however, things bright
ened up, and the two teams staged a
real battle.
Out of a wild scrambling under the
baskets, with everyone hitting at the
ball and no one trying to get it, the
Sequoia I quintet managed to take the
lead over Theta Chi at the end of the
half 9 to 4. The play was ragged, in
cluding inaccurate long shots, bad
passing, and 110 dribbling.
The teams tightened up in the sec
ond half when Duncan and Kopp
brought the Theta Chis to one point
behind the leaders. The game dragged
on for awhile, no one doing any scor
ing, until Reasor and Beason shot the
fraternity five ahead with two field
goals in the last few minutes of play.
For the Sequoia team, Mack and
Newland did all the scoring, while the
scoring for the winners was scattered
among Duncan, Reasor, Kopp, Carr,
and Beason. Carr and Reasor showed
up well during the play, both in of
fense and defense.
Alpha Delta Phi won the right to
represent League II in the intramural
elimination play-offs by beating Alpha
Sig by the decisive score of 27 to 3.
The game began with a fast start,
dose guarding, and a rushing attack.
Ferguson for the Alph aSigs started
the scoring by a beautiful arched :>hot.
The score at the end of the first
period was 7 to 2, in favor of the
Alpha Delts; in the last half, Moore,
Holman, and Duckett started off on a
scoring spree, making 19 points be
tween them. These three kept the
Alpha Sigs 011 defense during most of
the game, Dennis and Meeks ably
doing the guarding for the winners.
Ferguson did most of the work for
the losers, although he was taken
from the game because of personal
fouls. Campbell was a fair rival of
Dennis for guarding honors. Conroy
and Muller were better in offensive
play than in stopping their opponents,
but neither could find the range of
the basket.
Yesterday's games completed the
preliminary contests in the intramural
play. The following games are to be
played off in an elimination tourna
