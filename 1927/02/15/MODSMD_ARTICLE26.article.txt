# Bring Your Ballots
## 
### 
After staging a rehearsal last Tuesday, the Sophomore and Junior
Classes will be called upon today to vote for their class officers. Besides,
the Seniors have yet to choose a president and vice-president for the
remainder of the college year.
The running out of ballots last week was a regrettable incident, but
there was one encouraging point that- was illustrated by last Tuesday's
affair. The need for so many ballots proved that the students are waking
up to their rights. But besides being a right, voting is a privilege, and
also a duty.
The world is looking to the college graduate for its supply of intelli
gent voters. The educated citizens will be the ones who are to run the
government of the United States if the country is to progress. They will
hold the reigns of government through their power to vote and to elect
the more capable officials.
Thirty-eight candidates' names appear 011 today's ballots. Some of
these students are already known to the campus for their activities.
There are others who are making their debut into the political world at
this time. More will be heard from these later.
A class office has been called an empty honor. The student is elected,
and then nothing more is heard of him, until he turns over the position
to his successor. But the president of a class can actually succeed in
making something out of the position. He can not be expecte,d to get more
out of the job than he puts into it. In every activity the ones who put
their ideas and thoughts into action are the ones that achieve something
material.
With these thoughts in mind we are going to be previous, and con
gratulate the candidates who receive the confidence of their fellow
students in the election todav.
