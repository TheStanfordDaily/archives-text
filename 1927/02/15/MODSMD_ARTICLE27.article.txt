# Practical Economics

Cases from real life form the subject matter for a new course in
economics that is being- given at Columbia. Professor William E. Weld,
who teaches the course, calls it a pioneer attempt to improve teaching' in
economics. Weld's course aims to show the student how to solve actual
problems similar to those he will face in his contact with the world,
rather than merely to inculcate a mess of theories into the yoyng person's
head.
The study of economics is concerned with the science of making a
living. It deals with everyday questions that are of vital interest to
every man and woman. Leaders in the study of economics have long
realized that the theoretical method of presenting the subject is not meet
ing the practical needs of students. The lesson to be learned from
economics is a practical one, and therefore it seems quite logical that the
method of administering the subject should also be based on actual facts
and experiments.
There was once a time when the study of law was taught almost
solely by the text system, but gradually the more advanced universities
changed to the case method. There is every reason to forecast the same
evolution in the studying' of economics as has taken place in the study
of law.
Stanford requires majors in the Department of Economics to com
plete ten units of theoretical study in their senior year, before graduation.
It would be a worth-while experiment to add a course on the practical
side of the subject to the student's requirements.
