Read what one Ernie Guffin has to
say today in regard to education at
Stanford and the methods of impart
ing the same. Ernie Guffin, it appears,
does not think this University is doing
right by its charges. He has some defi
nite and quite pertinent remarks to
make on the subject, and he makes
them in a clear and intelligent man
ner.
Ernie Guffin's letter is his second
written on the same topic. This time
he writes in reply to one who signed
simself "Inquisitive." No doubt a great
deal of what Ernie Guffin says is per
fectly There are certain profes
sors in this University who have the
minds of army officers. They put their
classes through a certain drill each
quarter and they are highly gratified
if their students master' certain men
tal gymnastics. Their final examina
tions resemble a dress-parade. Upton

\ Sinclair wrote an entire volume on
this theme"
I The Bull Session is inclined to think
that Ernie Guffin is a trifle rabid. For
there are certain other professors in
this same University (names upon re
quest) whose courses are so con
j ducted that to pass them the student
J must necessarily exercise his creative
imagination.
j Not that The Bull Session would dis
courage Ernie Guffin. Heaven forbid!
Ernie Guffin has at least devoted some
j effort to a critical analysis of the
i University where he is spending con
| siderable time and money in seeking
an education. And he has arrived at
| certain conclusions that he believes
to be correct. Thus fortified, he has
the temerity to speak his piece.
I All this is offered without intention
j al offense to "Inquisitive." "Inquisi
| tive" sounded like a professor, and
! you know how that is.
