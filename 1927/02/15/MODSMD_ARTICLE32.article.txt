# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Inquisitive, the signer of an article
appearing in Campus Opinion, thinks
that Mr. Guffiu has taken a pessimistic
attitude toward the way things are
being done here. If this attitude can
be called pessimistic let me assure
Inquisitive that the pessimism is for
| a constructive purpose. It is my hope
; that criticism cf this sort will awaken
' many of our rationalizing students
j from tb'jir lethargy and provide the
j stimulus toward independent thinking
> which is so deplorably lacking in the
I American university.
Inquisitive states that Stanford is
! recognized as an institution of learn
ing with such distinguishing character
j is<tics as freedom of thought, demo
i cracy, and individualism (that usual
' graceful, all-virtuous and meaningless
j words that are used to cover so many
! American sins). If there is anything
I that American universities possess in
i common it is the slogan, "freedom of
' thought, democracy, and individual
j ism."
True, the University was founded
on these principles. But rather than
put these principles into practice,
rather than lead in freedom of thought
and independent thinking, it seems
to me that Stanford has a tendency to
grow away from these glorious prin
ciples and is gradually becoming an
"official, standardized college," where
all students march to the same tune
that they may get that good old A.13.
degree, signifying that they have had
a smattering of this and a smattering
of that and not a great deal of any
one thing. Mr. Inquisitive, that A.B.
degree which you consider such an
honor to carry home is becoming less
significant and before long it will
mean little more than the first two
letters of the alphabet.
Who can we blame for this situa
tion? Perhaps part of the fault lies
with the students, part with the fac
ulty, and an equal share with the ad
ministration. The American system of
education is "mass production," there
fore we have a large number of stu
dents who are aimless and incapable
of becoming good scholars. The col
lege curriculum and lower division is
filled with a sufficient number of
vapjd pipe-courses to insure this large
group of less-interested students
enough hours to get an A.B. degree
without a great amount of mental
strain.
Dr. Jordan's statement that it is
impossible to give a $5000 education
to a 50c boy is true, but is it justifiable
to give a 50c. education to a $5000 boy?
Lectures that consist of "text-book
quotations" are given by professors
and instructors who are glued to "cus
tomary methods." The entire group
of students "bone" for the same ex
amination and are expected to write
the same matter-of-fact answers —par-
rot-fashion. The very object of the
examination stifles every bit of crea
tive thinking that a student has.
We cannot place the blame entirely
upon the professors and instructors
because the "customary methods" of
teaching have been forced upon them.
Professors are of all classes —a few
break away from this imposed system
of teaching and the rest continue to
bo servers of "standardized bunk."
The administration should give the
situation some consideration but they
are kept busy figuring "useless honor

| points." The trustees and president
are busy with endowments and the
planning of new buildings for the pur
| pose of ushering in a greater number
lof students. Occasionally time is
taken to consider the liquor problem
or a few petty considerations concern
j ing the morals of the students.
Perhaps Inquisitive still thinks my
I attitude pessimistic, but here is more
| —we are all here, the campus is beau
tiful, we have a wonderful football
! team, a good library, a few profes
sors who encourage creative thought,
j and "500 beautiful women." After we
get out we can still say we had a
good time even though we did not
| learn a great deal.
Yours Sincerely, Ernie Guffin.
The Editor, Sir:
I've seen some ragged-looking bas
ketball teams trot out on gym floors,
| but I believe that Stanford's Varsity
presents by far the worst-appearing
i sight. I've witnessed.
Hardly two" men have the same out
fit. Some wear socks; a few wear
poorly-fitting sweat pants. And a few
i of the sweat shirts are similar.
Other squads have decent suits —
none of the teams appearing on the
campus this year have shown anything
but good uniforms. Small club teams
are by far better equipped than the
i University's men.
A full uniform —pants, shirt, and
sweat shirt —hardly costs over two
dollars, even the best. Hasn't Stan
ford enough in its basketball budget
j to take care of it scage team's stand
i ard?
In the past few weeks —at the
j games—l've hoard quite a bit of ad
verse comment on the Stanford suits,
j Can't something be done to outfit the
men more in keeping with a leading
: university? The suits after the men
! shed their outer coverings seem to be
| neat, why should'nt the rest be uni
; form? Sincerely, '28.

True, the University was founded
on these principles. But rather than
put these principles into practice,
rather than lead in freedom of thought
and independent thinking, it seems
to me that Stanford has a tendency to
grow away from these glorious prin
ciples and is gradually becoming an
"official, standardized college," where
all students march to the same tune
that they may get that good old A.13.
degree, signifying that they have had
a smattering of this and a smattering
of that and not a great deal of any
one thing. Mr. Inquisitive, that A.B.
degree which you consider such an
honor to carry home is becoming less
significant and before long it will
mean little more than the first two
letters of the alphabet.
Who can we blame for this situa
tion? Perhaps part of the fault lies
with the students, part with the fac
ulty, and an equal share with the ad
ministration. The American system of
education is "mass production," there
fore we have a large number of stu
dents who are aimless and incapable
of becoming good scholars. The col
lege curriculum and lower division is
filled with a sufficient number of
vapjd pipe-courses to insure this large
group of less-interested students
enough hours to get an A.B. degree
without a great amount of mental
strain.
Dr. Jordan's statement that it is
impossible to give a $5000 education
to a 50c boy is true, but is it justifiable
to give a 50c. education to a $5000 boy?
Lectures that consist of "text-book
quotations" are given by professors
and instructors who are glued to "cus
tomary methods." The entire group
of students "bone" for the same ex
amination and are expected to write
the same matter-of-fact answers —par-
rot-fashion. The very object of the
examination stifles every bit of crea
tive thinking that a student has.
We cannot place the blame entirely
upon the professors and instructors
because the "customary methods" of
teaching have been forced upon them.
Professors are of all classes —a few
break away from this imposed system
of teaching and the rest continue to
bo servers of "standardized bunk."
The administration should give the
situation some consideration but they
are kept busy figuring "useless honor

| points." The trustees and president
are busy with endowments and the
planning of new buildings for the pur
| pose of ushering in a greater number
lof students. Occasionally time is
taken to consider the liquor problem
or a few petty considerations concern
j ing the morals of the students.
Perhaps Inquisitive still thinks my

The Editor, Sir:
I've seen some ragged-looking bas
ketball teams trot out on gym floors,

presents by far the worst-appearing
i sight. I've witnessed.
Hardly two" men have the same out
fit. Some wear socks; a few wear
poorly-fitting sweat pants. And a few
i of the sweat shirts are similar.
Other squads have decent suits —
none of the teams appearing on the
campus this year have shown anything
but good uniforms. Small club teams
are by far better equipped than the
i University's men.
A full uniform —pants, shirt, and
sweat shirt —hardly costs over two
dollars, even the best. Hasn't Stan
ford enough in its basketball budget

In the past few weeks —at the

degree, signifying that they have had
a smattering of this and a smattering
of that and not a great deal of any
one thing. Mr. Inquisitive, that A.B.
degree which you consider such an
honor to carry home is becoming less
significant and before long it will
mean little more than the first two
letters of the alphabet.
Who can we blame for this situa
tion? Perhaps part of the fault lies
with the students, part with the fac
ulty, and an equal share with the ad
ministration. The American system of
education is "mass production," there
fore we have a large number of stu
dents who are aimless and incapable
of becoming good scholars. The col
lege curriculum and lower division is
filled with a sufficient number of
vapjd pipe-courses to insure this large
group of less-interested students
enough hours to get an A.B. degree
without a great amount of mental
strain.
Dr. Jordan's statement that it is
impossible to give a $5000 education
to a 50c boy is true, but is it justifiable
to give a 50c. education to a $5000 boy?
Lectures that consist of "text-book
quotations" are given by professors
and instructors who are glued to "cus
tomary methods." The entire group
of students "bone" for the same ex
amination and are expected to write
the same matter-of-fact answers —par-
rot-fashion. The very object of the
examination stifles every bit of crea
tive thinking that a student has.
We cannot place the blame entirely
upon the professors and instructors
because the "customary methods" of
teaching have been forced upon them.
Professors are of all classes —a few
break away from this imposed system
of teaching and the rest continue to
bo servers of "standardized bunk."
The administration should give the
situation some consideration but they
are kept busy figuring "useless honor

| points." The trustees and president
are busy with endowments and the
planning of new buildings for the pur
| pose of ushering in a greater number
lof students. Occasionally time is
taken to consider the liquor problem
or a few petty considerations concern
j ing the morals of the students.
Perhaps Inquisitive still thinks my
I attitude pessimistic, but here is more

tiful, we have a wonderful football
! team, a good library, a few profes
sors who encourage creative thought,

good time even though we did not

Yours Sincerely, Ernie Guffin.
The Editor, Sir:
I've seen some ragged-looking bas
ketball teams trot out on gym floors,
| but I believe that Stanford's Varsity
presents by far the worst-appearing
i sight. I've witnessed.
Hardly two" men have the same out
fit. Some wear socks; a few wear
poorly-fitting sweat pants. And a few
i of the sweat shirts are similar.
Other squads have decent suits —
none of the teams appearing on the
campus this year have shown anything
but good uniforms. Small club teams
are by far better equipped than the
i University's men.
A full uniform —pants, shirt, and
sweat shirt —hardly costs over two
dollars, even the best. Hasn't Stan
ford enough in its basketball budget
j to take care of it scage team's stand
i ard?
In the past few weeks —at the
j games—l've hoard quite a bit of ad
verse comment on the Stanford suits,
j Can't something be done to outfit the
men more in keeping with a leading
: university? The suits after the men
! shed their outer coverings seem to be
| neat, why should'nt the rest be uni
; form? Sincerely, '28.

The Editor, Sir:
Inquisitive, the signer of an article
appearing in Campus Opinion, thinks
that Mr. Guffiu has taken a pessimistic
attitude toward the way things are
being done here. If this attitude can
be called pessimistic let me assure
Inquisitive that the pessimism is for
| a constructive purpose. It is my hope
; that criticism cf this sort will awaken
' many of our rationalizing students
j from tb'jir lethargy and provide the
j stimulus toward independent thinking
> which is so deplorably lacking in the
I American university.
Inquisitive states that Stanford is
! recognized as an institution of learn
ing with such distinguishing character
j is<tics as freedom of thought, demo
i cracy, and individualism (that usual
' graceful, all-virtuous and meaningless
j words that are used to cover so many
! American sins). If there is anything
I that American universities possess in
i common it is the slogan, "freedom of
' thought, democracy, and individual
j ism."
True, the University was founded
on these principles. But rather than
put these principles into practice,
rather than lead in freedom of thought
and independent thinking, it seems
to me that Stanford has a tendency to
grow away from these glorious prin
ciples and is gradually becoming an
"official, standardized college," where
all students march to the same tune
