### Harry Hirsute 
"I owe ray success to ray mother,"
opined the triumphant Robert Treat
Paine, clutching the prize of ten dol
lars and a hand-painted shaving mug,
won in the Chaparral Marathon Whis
ker Contest, which was completed
yesterday after two weeks behind the
bush.
Besides Paine there were four other
place-winners named by the judges
of the contest. At first it was thought
blue and red ribbons would be given,
but as the men themselves furnished
the decorations, it was feared the rib
bons could not be distinguished. Three
of the winners wore red beards and
two were blue. A blue won first.
Brothers Under Skin
The judges said the opinion was
based solely on outward appearances
as they are all brothers under the
skin, anyway (this does not refer to
fraternity brothers).

j In further comment on his success,
! Paine said he relied on nature's rera
| edy for the luxuriant growth of his
hirsute decoration, and that he prefers
i turnips to carrots for obtaining that
' curly touch that many aspire to, but
1 few acquire.
After he pays off the mortgage on
! his gray-haired mother's and father's
homestead, he intends to invest tiie
remainder of the ten dollars in Lydia
I E. Pinkham's celebrated compound.
: The Redlands Chamber of Commerce
has sent word that the whole town is
waiting with open arms for the return
of their virile viking. Oh, girls, what
j a Treat!

collar.

from Jim the barber, presented a dark
and lustrous beard outstanding for
its captivating Freudian appeal.

even red distribution that, with the
combination of his unusual pipe, pre
