# OREGON MAY ADOPT JUNIOR COLLEGE PLAN
## 
### 
Establishment of a clearly defined
junior college at the University of
Oreggn is being seriously considered
by the faculty there. The suggested
college would cover the instruction
generally received by the student dur
ing the freshman and sophomore
years.
The major subjects, under this plan,
would not be chosen until the begin
ning of the junior year, except in the
case of certain professional schools.
The responsibility for advising fresh
man and sophomores would be placed
in the hands of an advisory commit
tee, which would assign students to
suitable advisers selected by the fac
ulty.
