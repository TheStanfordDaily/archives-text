Although high-scoring games are
often uninteresting to watch, a few
facts about some of the record scores
and those who have scored the most
points may prove interesting.
Baseball: Ty Cobb, in his twenty
two years in the American League,
scored 2056 runs, or 346 more than
his nearest competitor, Hans Wagner,
scored in twenty-one seasons in the
National League. Bill Hamilton scored
196 runs in one season with the Phil
lies in 1894, while Babe Ruth tallied
177 times for the Yanks in 1921. A
gent named Guy Hecker, of the old
Louisville A.A., crossed the plate safely
seven times in one game in 1886, while
Tom Burns of the Cubs scored three
runs in one inning in 1883.
A game between the Cubs and Phil
lies in 1922 produced the most runs by
two opposing clubs, just one shy of
fifty, while in 1597 the ( Cubs beat
Louisvile 26 to 7, making 18 runs in
one inning, another record.
Football: Mayes McLain, 20'0-pouiul
Cherokee full-back of the Haskell In
dians. scored 259 points in ten of the
thirteen games that his team com
peted in last season. He ran up a
total of 114 digits in three games, and
his season's record is nearly two and
a half times that of his nearest rival

for scoring honors. In 1925, McLain
made 111 points.
The following are two games in |
which a very high score was made by j
one team. They are not, however,
claimed as records. Georgia Tech beat
Cumberland 253 to 0 in 1916, and a few
years later Kings College, Va., beat
Lenoir"2o6 to 0.
Basketball (not necessarily world's
records): Passaic High School beat
Ocean City H.S., 122-6 in 1923. The i
Bridgeport (Conn.) H.S. girl's team de
feated South Manchester H.S. 106 to 2,
and the Elm Creek (Neb.) H.S. girls'
team beat Iliverdale 103 to 0 (Jan. 21,
1926). Ruth Royston, the Missouri
girl who scored forty-one field goals j
and two free throws for a total of
eighty-four points in one .game, ap
pears to be the high school girl basket
ball champ of the world at this writ
ing. Back in 1908, the Hoboken (N.J.)
Academy girls' team beat Kearny High

School 91 to 0, Capt. Elsa Tannert
scoring 62 points.
Golf: The woman who holed out in
166 shots, after playing her ball down
stream in a rowboat and back a mile
and a quarter through the woods, in a
Shawnee Club tournament, is evident
nament golf, but there are a few other
items of interest. A hole was halved
in ten in the final of the 1906 British
amateur championship, D. Murdoch
made a hole in fourteen in the 1925
British Open, and Willie Chisholm
took eighteen strokes on one hole in
the 1919 United States Open!
Tennis: Vandeventer (New Jersey)
beat. Stratford (Cal.) 22 to 20 in one
set in a 1925 tournament.
Soccer: New Bedford's 14 to 0 win
over Philadelphia last month was an
American Soccer League record.
Billiards (18.2 balk line): Last No
vember in Paris, Roger Conti ran 732
in a match with Louis Cure at the

ly the high-score record-holder of tour-
Olvmpia Club. Ed Horemans had pre
viously run 701.
Ice Hockey (not necessarily a rec
ord): In 1917, the Wanderers beat
Ottawa 11 to 10, after being behind
8 to 1 in the first period. Lester Pat
rick, now manager of the New York
Rangers, scored 8 goals for the win
ners. (The goalie's pads were smaller
in those days.)
