Anti-evolutionists are unchristian, j
President Hibben of Princeton Uni- j
versity contended in a recent address i
in St. Paul. He strongly condemned !
efforts now being made in various j
state legislatures to enact laws similar
to the famous Tennessee law. The i
Daily Princetonian quotes Hibben:
"To attempt to legislate against fact
is to return to the dark ages and to
the period when Galileo was perse
cuted because of his statement that !
the earth moved. Such legislation is !

I also a reflection upon the Christian j
| belief and sincerity of those who are
of the opinion that God manifests
| himself even more marvelously
! through the slow processes of nature '
j than through single acts of immediate
1 creation."
