Razor Blades
THE softer your beard when shaving, the less
work for your razor. Williams Shaving Cream
softens the beard bristles so completely that the
razor just glides through them. This eliminates
"pull" and lengthens the life of your blades. Then,
Williams lubricates the skin for easy shaving and
leaves it glove-smooth after the shave. Two
sizes—35c and 50c.
