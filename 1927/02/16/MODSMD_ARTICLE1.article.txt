# VARSITY FACES REDWOOD CITY BASEBALL NINE
## Moundsmen Show Ability; Kern, Lewis, Sobeski, Collins to See Action FOUR PITCHERS TO PLAY Wolter States Team Rapidly Improving; Getting Batting Eye 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team will
meet the Redwood City Police, a semi
professional team, at 3 o'clock tomor
row. Coach Harry Wolter states that
the team is rapidly improving in their
play and are also getting their batting
eye. In the game with Santa Clara
last Saturday, the team seemed to be
hitting its stride.
Four pitchers "will see action in the
game tomorrow; Kern and Lewis,
members of last year's freshman team,
and Sobieski and Collins. Stanford
seems well-fixed for pitchers this sea
son. Kern hasn't very good control
yet but with a little experience should
make a good pitcher as he has poten
tial ability. Lewis turned in a good
game against Cliff Ireland's team, al
lowing only two hits. Collins and
Sobieski have also pitched good ball
this year.
Spud Harder and Frank Wilton,
members of the freshman team last
year, have both been playing well.
Harder knocked in two runs at the
Santa Clara game with two long sin
gles. Wilton has bolstered up the out-
Held but has not got his batting eye
yet.
The starting lineup will be: catcher,
Svpher; pitcher, Kern; first, Maguire;
second, Garibaldi; third, Harder;
shortstop, Busch; left field, Stewart;
right field, Nissen; and center field,
Wilton.
