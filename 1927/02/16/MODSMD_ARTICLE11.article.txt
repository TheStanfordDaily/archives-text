# EUROPE'S PEACE LIES IN LEAGUE DECLARES LUTZ
## History Professor Sketches Political Impressions Of Recent Trip WILSON IDEAS DEFEATED Moral Backing of Anti-War Forces Increases More With Each Year 
### Maxine Cushing 
The one hope for insuring Euro
pean peace lies in the maintenance of
the League of Nations, which is get
ting stronger yearly and has a tre
mendous moral backing from peace
forces in Europe. There has been a
tremendous moral backing from peace
forces in Europe. There has been a
change of political ideas since 1918;
Wilsonian principles of democracy
now seem to be defeated. Everywhere
there is a pronounced tendency to
change existing governments.
These were the main impressions
of present European political condi
tions as acquired during his recent
trip abroad and given at the Tuesday
lecture last evening by Professor
Ralph H. Lutz of the Historv depart
ment.
Discussed by Groups
Professor Lutz divided the princi
pal countries of Europe into three
groups according to their types of
government: true representative types
of self-government, ostensibly repre
sentative democrat, it-:-., Bm' military
dictatorships. Under the first class he
included Great Britain, Ireland, Ger
many, France, Belgium, Austria, and
Greece; in the second division, Rou
mania, Jugo-Slavia, and Hungary; and
in the classification of military dicta
torships he placed Spain, Poland,
Turkey, and Italy. Some of his com
ments on the various countries fol
low:
"My belief is that religious differ
ences have caused the trouble in Ire
land, although now the Irish have one
of the best democratic governments
1 have observed in Europe. Young
men are governing the country.
Poincare, Briand Praised
"France has two distinguished
statesmen in Poincare and Briand.
The former saved her from bank
ruptcy in 1926 by his emergency coali
tion; Briand has added to the pres
tige of the nation by his foreign
policies.
"In Germany, too, young men are
in high positions. The Reich is strug
gling with representative government
and organization of industry, but the
turn of the tide has taken place and
it is practically assured that Germany
will soon regain her economic posi
tion.
"Anti-American feeling passed away
rapidly in Belgium. The most interest
ing political event in Austria is the
union with the German empire which
will probably take place as soon as
possible, and in Greece it is the fact
that two months ago the people held a
real election the results of which were
honestly counted and complied with.
"Although in Roumania the invisible
government is only too visible, that
country will eventually become a great
European state. At the present time
the peasants are struggling for politi
cal freedom against the problem of
the dynasty.
"Wo will see in a few years the
crisis stage reached in Spain. As for
Poland, I believe in its future and
that the Poles will work out a suc
cessful form of government and make
a permanent state. At the present
time Pilsudski's dictatorship has over
whelmed Poland's representative gov
ernment.
"Turkey is obsessed with rampant
nationalism; everybody is supporting
Kemal Pasha in his new capitol at
Angora.
"I have to be careful what I say of
Mussolini, because I have been de
nounced for saying that he was any
thing but a tyrant. On the contrary,
1 think he's a constructive statesman
and that as a result of the revolution
constructive work has been accom
plished in Italy. Specifically, it has
resulted in internal order, prestige
abroad, and economic recovery. Mus
solini. however, is simply at the head
of a great movement —the Fascisti
regime—and if he were killed chaos
would not result. The Fascisti party
would simply place another man at
the head of the government.

These were the main impressions
of present European political condi
tions as acquired during his recent
trip abroad and given at the Tuesday
lecture last evening by Professor
Ralph H. Lutz of the Historv depart
ment.
Discussed by Groups
Professor Lutz divided the princi
pal countries of Europe into three
groups according to their types of
government: true representative types
of self-government, ostensibly repre
sentative democrat, it-:-., Bm' military
dictatorships. Under the first class he
included Great Britain, Ireland, Ger
many, France, Belgium, Austria, and
Greece; in the second division, Rou
mania, Jugo-Slavia, and Hungary; and
in the classification of military dicta
torships he placed Spain, Poland,
Turkey, and Italy. Some of his com
ments on the various countries fol
low:
"My belief is that religious differ
ences have caused the trouble in Ire
land, although now the Irish have one
of the best democratic governments
1 have observed in Europe. Young
men are governing the country.
Poincare, Briand Praised
"France has two distinguished
statesmen in Poincare and Briand.
The former saved her from bank
ruptcy in 1926 by his emergency coali
tion; Briand has added to the pres
tige of the nation by his foreign
policies.
"In Germany, too, young men are
in high positions. The Reich is strug
gling with representative government
and organization of industry, but the
turn of the tide has taken place and
it is practically assured that Germany
will soon regain her economic posi
tion.
"Anti-American feeling passed away
rapidly in Belgium. The most interest
ing political event in Austria is the
union with the German empire which
will probably take place as soon as
possible, and in Greece it is the fact
that two months ago the people held a
real election the results of which were
honestly counted and complied with.
"Although in Roumania the invisible
government is only too visible, that
country will eventually become a great
European state. At the present time
the peasants are struggling for politi
cal freedom against the problem of
the dynasty.
"Wo will see in a few years the
crisis stage reached in Spain. As for
Poland, I believe in its future and
that the Poles will work out a suc
cessful form of government and make
a permanent state. At the present
time Pilsudski's dictatorship has over
whelmed Poland's representative gov
ernment.
