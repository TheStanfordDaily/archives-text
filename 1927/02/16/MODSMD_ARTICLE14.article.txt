# HUNT DRILLS TEAM ON GOAL DEFENSE FOR BEAR CONTEST
## RIVALS TO PLAY FRIDAY Coach Prepares Men for Fast Work of Corbin, Bear High-Point Man 
### Fred Speers 
Drill on defensive work constituted
the bulk of practice handed out last
night to the varsity basketball squad
in preparation for the initial clash of
the California series in Oakland Fri
day night. Coach Hunt is giving his
forwards plenty of work on defending
goal from fast attacks such as Cali
fornia's five possesses.
Corbin, California's high-point man,
is especially adept at work under the
basket, and it was to prepare for this
attack that Husky gave his men drill
on the zone defense. Sexson, Price,
and Sibbett were used by the Cardinal
mentor to try to work the ball through
a close defense.
McCandless Over Slump
Bryant and McCandless were used
at forward berths with Jayred, center,
and Vincenti and Anderson, guards.
McCandless went well last night,
seeming to have overcome the slump
through which he passed during the
past several weeks. McCandless lacks
the experience and general finished
fioorwork of Christ but he is by far
a better shot at the basket. Christ
compensates for this to some extent
by being a free-throw artist.
Captain Nelson David was not back
in uniform last night though he may
return tonight. He is suffering from an
attack of influenza.
Bryant Cinches Place
Bryant, ranking Cardinal scorer,
seems to have cinched a place in the
starting lineup against the Bears.
Bryant is particularly good in a fast
rushing attack, finishing with a short
shot at the basket.'
Stanford has yet to develop a good
defense against the middle distance
shooting of Captain Fran Watson of
the Bears. The California pilot shoots
mainly from a little past the foul line
in towards the center of the floor.
Watson is third in high-point totals,
indicating he is dangerous fit this
type of shooting.
