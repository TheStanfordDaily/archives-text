# Speers 1928 Secretary; Call Victor in Contest for Treasurership
## SYPHER LEADS JUNIORS Bogue Wins from Brooks in Senior Race; Margaret McOmie Elected 
### 
Because the sophomore class failed
to elect any of its officers yesterday
and because no vice-president was
chosen by the juniors, a third elec
tion has been scheduled for next
Wednesday, February 23.
Twenty-eight ballots were thrown
out by the Election Board because
they were marked with pencil instead
of in ink. Six of the offenders were
seniors, seven juniors, and fifteen
sophomores. However, the number of
bad ballots was proportionate to the
\ote cast in each class, is the conclu
sion of the Board.
Geoi ge Bogue was elected president
of the Senior Class with 112 votes to
87 for Phil Brooks, while Margaret
McOmie received 109 votes to win the
election for vice-president. Bob Mc
-1 lines polled SI votes for that office.
Cook Sypher is the new 192S Class
president. Fred Speers was elected
Junior Class secretary and Harry Call
polled the most votes for treasurer.
The vice-presidency of the class is
still in dispute, as the five candidates
running caused such a split vote that
no nominee could obtain a majority.
