That Stanford student opinion about college academic life has been
aroused to communications to the Daily is indeed encouraging - , for it
evidences a real interest in the kind of education students can gain here.
But in order to achieve any change in the present system, it is necessary
to propose a workable plan as substitute for that already in use.
The University administration and professors have long recognized
a need for reform in the existing method of conducting classes and
courses. Attempting to meet this demand an Independent Study Plan was
inaugurated last year. Perhaps this innovation is a step forward, but
at any rate the small number enrolled in its ranks shows that the scheme
is not acceptable as a complete solution.
If this method has been given a fair trial and is proving unsatisfac
tory, it should be an added incentive for those who complain to evolve
a plan of their own. Adverse opinions about the "official, standardized
college" are valuable, but not until those who are dissatisfied are willing
to devote time and thought to working out some constructive scheme as
a remedy for the present situation will there be any real improvement.
University officials will doubtless welcome any student proposal
wliich, after careful survey of present methods, points to improvements.
Professors are for the most part merely adapting themselves to the
immediate situation and are usually sympathetic with the students' desire
to break away from the "standardized bunk-' as one contributor to the
Campus Opinion column phrased it.
Stanford may well follow the example set a little more than a year
ago by student action in an Eastern college. Following expression of
the desire for change in their academic life, a student committee made
a careful survey of the situation with a view to suggesting changes.
Student opinion was heard and felt, concrete plans were submitted and
many of them were incorporated in the University plan.
Students are dissatisfied; it is their privilege and their duty to devise
some other method of academic procedure.
