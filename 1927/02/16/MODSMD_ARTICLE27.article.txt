# No Red Sweaters
## 
### 
Speaking of traditions, the California Agricultural College at Davis
is the proud possessor of a prize ruling. No University Farm student
is allowed to wear a red sweater on the campus because Stanford's colors
happen to be Cardinal. Any student that violates this tradition is a
marked man —he is a traitor to the cause of the Blue and Gold.
Such actions are ridiculous. The mere suggestion that a student
can not wear certain garments should stir something in the man, and
cause him to revolt. Whose business is it whether a particular aspiring
farmer at Davis wants to plow the field or hoe the garden with a red
sweater on his back? At an institution where a regulation outfit is
required, the case is different, but in a college where the only restriction
on the subject of dress is that the student be decently covered, the ban on
red sweaters is absurd.
It is true that Davis Farm is a part of the University of California,
and the citizens of that college community should therefore despise the
color of red, but the Aggies are such a remote part of the state university,
that they can hardly be considered a stockholder in the great Bear com
bine. California Agricultural College can hardly be considered on the
par with Stanford, although the two institutions do compete in certain
fields. Stanford may be the Aggies' big rival, but certainly the reverse
is not true.
If Davis Farm insists on hating some particular color, and restricting
that shade on the campus, we would suggest that the Aggies investigate
what color the College of the Pacific professes, and then hate that color
for all they are worth.
