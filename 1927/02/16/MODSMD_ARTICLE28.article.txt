# Try a Cabbage
## 
### 
Wc believe that one of the most important columns in The Stanford
Daily is the Campus Opinion department. It allows the students to
express themselves in print. It offers Stanford men and women an
opportunity to approve or disapprove of matters concerning anything' in
the University. Practically the only restrictions placed upon these com
munications is that they not be too long, or too personal.
Now the Daily is offering the student a chance to express themselves
in another way. Cabbages and Things will pass judgment on contribu
tions that are along humorous lines. 1 112 the King of the Cabbage column
laughs while reading such a communication then the bit of humor will
be printed, and if the King smiles it may be printed.
