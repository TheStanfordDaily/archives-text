KNOWING TOO MUCH
Because some half-dozen or more
American students have chosen to
commit suicide within a space of two
weeks, the press is again filled with
the old wail about over-education.
Nearly all of the commentators have
ascribed the alarming number of
these overt acts to over-taxed brains,
or over-developed imagination.
To the ignorant, knowledge always
appears forbidding and sinister. Like
any other unknown object it shares in
the awe of the unenlightened. Like
any other mysterious power, educa
tion is given credit for any miracles
that might reasonably be attributed
to it. And, also like any other mysteri
ous power, education is blamed for

any misfortunes that seem to be the
results of its workings.
Of course, over-education is quite
impossible. But unbalanced education
is not only possible, but quite com
mon. It is more than probable that the
students who have recently ended
their lives did so, not because they
were too educated, but because they
were imperfectly educated. That is,
assuming that education had anything
to do with the matter at all.

A COINCIDENCE?
After all these years, the executive
committee has consented to grant
Skull and Snakes Society a closed
date for their all-university jolly-up.
Get ready, one and all, the date is
April 1.
