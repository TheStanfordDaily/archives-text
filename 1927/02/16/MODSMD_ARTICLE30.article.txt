THE PLUTOCRAT, by Booth Tark
ington. Doubleday, Page & Co.
Now let R.otary stand up at her
noonday luncheons and shout "Vic
tory"! Let Kiwanis all her banners
wave! Let the Lions roar. Let all the
legions of Babbitry in this broad land
rejoice! For today a Daniel has come
to judgment, and the Menckens and
the Lewises are indeed small pota
toes.
The modern Daniel is called Tark
ington, and he, like the prophet of old,
has interpreted the handwriting. More
than that he has rut it in a book that
is good to read. The author calls it

I"The Plutocrat," but it might just as
well have been called "The Eye
Opener," for many in its pages, blind
at the beginning, saw light at the end.
Power Is Bower
It is probable, too, that many who
are blind before they read this book
will see after they lay it down; and
if this novel by Booth Tarkington had
no other merit, that fact alone would
entitle it to loud acclaim. The salient
fact in this novel is the shrewd lesson
of reality it teaches: that power is
power, whatever its metaphysical at
tributes maybband that no amount
of intellectual high-hatting will ever
make it otherwise. In other words, be
fore any of the intelligentsia despise
Babbitt and the power of money, let
them learn what Babbitt and the
power of money really means. It is a
poor general that attacks the enemy
without some knowledge of his posi
tion.
Lawrence Ogle, callow young play
wright, who for the time being was
sitting on top of his little world by
virtue of a successful opening, set
sail for Africa on the same boat with
Earl (Babbitt) Tinker, builder of
cities and organizer of corporations.
Ogle and his two so-called fellow es
thetes are silly to begin with; Mr.
Tarkington makes you see that with
half an eye. But Mr. Tinker, though
he is loud, provincial, "vulgar," and
even ignorant, never gets that low;
there was that Roman sweep, that
Gothic grandeur about him, if you
like, that no sophisticated sneer could
touch. He was a triumph to begin with
—Everlasting Providence had seen to
that.
Tells It Well
Therefore Earl Tinker's sojourn 1
abroad was the triumph of a Caesar,
indeed, and the world was a willing
captive at his chariot wheels. What
Lawrence Ogle, brought up on the new
"ideology," thought of all this, only
Booth Tarkington can tell. And take
it from me he tells it, and only too i
well.
There is a French goddess of un
certain ago in the book who under
stands Earl Tinker —and profits there
by (you don't even have to read be
tween the lines). There is Mrs. Tin
ker who screams and makes scenes,
and is thereby her Husband's only
master. There is Mr. Tinker's pretty j
daughter—who also had something to
learn (as all women do). Only, being ;
a woman, she was several jumps I
ahead of Mr. Ogle. He is the last to j
give in, and one is left with the im
pression that brains had little to do \
with it, even if he did write plays.
Only the most outrageous luck saved
him from groveling in the dust before j
the despised "yokel."

THE NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE, by Ar-I
k, thur Weigall. Frank Maurice. Inc. I
In the course of human affairs no- i
body could expect a noted Egyptologist
to write a novel —and particularly a

good one. Yet that is what Arthur
Weigall, British scientist and littera
teur, has done. He calls it"The Not
Impossible She," and it is published
j by Frank-Maurice, Inc. It is 110 im
possible romance of Egyptian prin
| cesses, either —it is just the sound
; and often mirth-provoking story of
j young Sebastian Wake, whom nothing
! in the world could make into the con
ventional English gentleman—a genus
; which Mr. Weigall evidently believes
is a mistake. One cannot help but
, note, however, that the very sanity
which Mr. Weigall seems to scorn as
the product of the traditional educa
tional regime the male Briton has to
undergo in his own glory as a novelist.
He tells the story which is delightful
; chiefly because it is the product of a
; mind under perfect control.
—Emerson Spencer.

It is probable, too, that many who
are blind before they read this book
will see after they lay it down; and
if this novel by Booth Tarkington had
no other merit, that fact alone would
entitle it to loud acclaim. The salient
fact in this novel is the shrewd lesson
of reality it teaches: that power is
power, whatever its metaphysical at
tributes maybband that no amount
of intellectual high-hatting will ever
make it otherwise. In other words, be
fore any of the intelligentsia despise
Babbitt and the power of money, let
them learn what Babbitt and the
power of money really means. It is a
poor general that attacks the enemy
without some knowledge of his posi
tion.
Lawrence Ogle, callow young play
wright, who for the time being was
sitting on top of his little world by

Ogle and his two so-called fellow es
thetes are silly to begin with; Mr.
Tarkington makes you see that with
half an eye. But Mr. Tinker, though
he is loud, provincial, "vulgar," and
even ignorant, never gets that low;
there was that Roman sweep, that
Gothic grandeur about him, if you
like, that no sophisticated sneer could
touch. He was a triumph to begin with

Tells It Well
Therefore Earl Tinker's sojourn 1
abroad was the triumph of a Caesar,
indeed, and the world was a willing

Booth Tarkington can tell. And take
it from me he tells it, and only too i
well.
There is a French goddess of un

master. There is Mr. Tinker's pretty j
daughter—who also had something to

THE NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE, by Ar-I
k, thur Weigall. Frank Maurice. Inc. I
In the course of human affairs no- i
body could expect a noted Egyptologist
to write a novel —and particularly a

good one. Yet that is what Arthur
Weigall, British scientist and littera
teur, has done. He calls it"The Not
Impossible She," and it is published
j by Frank-Maurice, Inc. It is 110 im
possible romance of Egyptian prin
| cesses, either —it is just the sound
; and often mirth-provoking story of
j young Sebastian Wake, whom nothing
! in the world could make into the con
ventional English gentleman—a genus
; which Mr. Weigall evidently believes
is a mistake. One cannot help but
, note, however, that the very sanity
which Mr. Weigall seems to scorn as
the product of the traditional educa
tional regime the male Briton has to
undergo in his own glory as a novelist.
He tells the story which is delightful
; chiefly because it is the product of a
; mind under perfect control.

I"The Plutocrat," but it might just as
well have been called "The Eye
Opener," for many in its pages, blind
at the beginning, saw light at the end.
Power Is Bower
It is probable, too, that many who
are blind before they read this book
will see after they lay it down; and
if this novel by Booth Tarkington had
no other merit, that fact alone would
entitle it to loud acclaim. The salient
fact in this novel is the shrewd lesson
of reality it teaches: that power is
power, whatever its metaphysical at
tributes maybband that no amount
of intellectual high-hatting will ever
make it otherwise. In other words, be
fore any of the intelligentsia despise
Babbitt and the power of money, let
them learn what Babbitt and the
power of money really means. It is a
poor general that attacks the enemy
without some knowledge of his posi
tion.
Lawrence Ogle, callow young play
wright, who for the time being was
sitting on top of his little world by
virtue of a successful opening, set
sail for Africa on the same boat with
Earl (Babbitt) Tinker, builder of
cities and organizer of corporations.
Ogle and his two so-called fellow es
thetes are silly to begin with; Mr.
Tarkington makes you see that with
half an eye. But Mr. Tinker, though
he is loud, provincial, "vulgar," and
even ignorant, never gets that low;
there was that Roman sweep, that
Gothic grandeur about him, if you
like, that no sophisticated sneer could
touch. He was a triumph to begin with
—Everlasting Providence had seen to
that.
Tells It Well
Therefore Earl Tinker's sojourn 1
abroad was the triumph of a Caesar,
indeed, and the world was a willing
captive at his chariot wheels. What
Lawrence Ogle, brought up on the new
"ideology," thought of all this, only
Booth Tarkington can tell. And take
it from me he tells it, and only too i
well.
There is a French goddess of un
certain ago in the book who under
stands Earl Tinker —and profits there
by (you don't even have to read be
tween the lines). There is Mrs. Tin
ker who screams and makes scenes,
and is thereby her Husband's only
master. There is Mr. Tinker's pretty j
daughter—who also had something to
learn (as all women do). Only, being ;
a woman, she was several jumps I
ahead of Mr. Ogle. He is the last to j
give in, and one is left with the im
pression that brains had little to do \
with it, even if he did write plays.
Only the most outrageous luck saved
him from groveling in the dust before j
the despised "yokel."
Scientist Writes
THE NOT IMPOSSIBLE SHE, by Ar-I
k, thur Weigall. Frank Maurice. Inc. I
In the course of human affairs no- i
body could expect a noted Egyptologist
to write a novel —and particularly a

good one. Yet that is what Arthur
Weigall, British scientist and littera
teur, has done. He calls it"The Not
Impossible She," and it is published
j by Frank-Maurice, Inc. It is 110 im
possible romance of Egyptian prin
| cesses, either —it is just the sound
; and often mirth-provoking story of
j young Sebastian Wake, whom nothing
! in the world could make into the con
ventional English gentleman—a genus
; which Mr. Weigall evidently believes
is a mistake. One cannot help but
, note, however, that the very sanity
which Mr. Weigall seems to scorn as
the product of the traditional educa
tional regime the male Briton has to
undergo in his own glory as a novelist.
He tells the story which is delightful
; chiefly because it is the product of a
; mind under perfect control.
—Emerson Spencer.
