# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The annual indoor games of the
New York Athletic Club tonight bring
to mind one of the greatest runners
that ever wore the Winged Foot em
blem, one who was, in my estimation,
the greatest runner that ever lived,
for sheer power and lighting heart.
After seeing Ted Meredith win both
the quarter and the half in the "Inter
collegiates" at Cambridge in May,
1916, beating fields that included
Bingham, Willcox, Scudder, Wind
nagle, and Overton, and setting new
records of .47 2-5 and 1.53, respective
ly, for the two races within two hours'
time, I was satisfied there would never
again be another runner like him.
A couple of weeks before this meet,
Ted had set a new world's record for
880 yards, cutting three-tenths of a
second off of his own record of 1.52y 2 ,
set in 1912, and it was this latter
record that the Germna, Dr. Peltzer,
broke last summer. I asked Ted about
this recently, and he told me that he
always though the mark could be
broken, and went on to relate the cir
cumstances under which it had been
set.
It was in the Penn-Cornell dual meet
in May 1916, and as Penn was being
badly beaten, Coach Lawson Robert
son decided not to run Meredith in
both the 440, and SSO, as was his cus

| torn, and suggested that Ted try for
a new half-mile record. Ted said he
would if he found himself keeping to
Robby's time schedule, ( which called
j for the first quarter in .53, and the
j 660 in 1.23.
Let Ted go on with the story.
"The first quarter was in :54 4-5,
and when he announced to me I gave
up and was relieved that I did not
have to try further. However, the boys
were all up with me, and I thought I
would go the next part at a good
I pace to kill them off and then loaf
home. The result was I hit the 6(50
bn schedule, and after leaving there,
Windnagle, Cornell's best, came up
on my shoulder and I had to race all
the way to the tape to get rid of him.

Time 1.52 1-5.
"I was surprised at the time and at
Windnagle, but the answer was that j
I carried a miler along at an even
pace and let him do his very best.
A fast first quarter would have killed
Windnagle, 1 think, and I then could
have come home at will, since he was
a miler with very little quarter-mile j
speed, but wonderful staying powers.
He won the Intercollegiate mile that \
year, beating Johnny Overton by the
same staying power—time 4.15 2-5, Ii
think."

the way to the tape to get rid of him.

Time 1.52 1-5.
"I was surprised at the time and at
Windnagle, but the answer was that j
I carried a miler along at an even
pace and let him do his very best.
A fast first quarter would have killed
Windnagle, 1 think, and I then could
have come home at will, since he was
a miler with very little quarter-mile j
speed, but wonderful staying powers.
He won the Intercollegiate mile that \

The annual indoor games of the
New York Athletic Club tonight bring
to mind one of the greatest runners
that ever wore the Winged Foot em
blem, one who was, in my estimation,
the greatest runner that ever lived,
for sheer power and lighting heart.
After seeing Ted Meredith win both
the quarter and the half in the "Inter
collegiates" at Cambridge in May,
1916, beating fields that included
Bingham, Willcox, Scudder, Wind
nagle, and Overton, and setting new
records of .47 2-5 and 1.53, respective
ly, for the two races within two hours'
time, I was satisfied there would never
again be another runner like him.
A couple of weeks before this meet,
Ted had set a new world's record for
880 yards, cutting three-tenths of a
second off of his own record of 1.52y 2 ,
set in 1912, and it was this latter
record that the Germna, Dr. Peltzer,
broke last summer. I asked Ted about
this recently, and he told me that he
always though the mark could be
broken, and went on to relate the cir
cumstances under which it had been
set.
It was in the Penn-Cornell dual meet
in May 1916, and as Penn was being
badly beaten, Coach Lawson Robert
son decided not to run Meredith in
both the 440, and SSO, as was his cus

| torn, and suggested that Ted try for
a new half-mile record. Ted said he
would if he found himself keeping to
Robby's time schedule, ( which called
j for the first quarter in .53, and the
j 660 in 1.23.
Let Ted go on with the story.
"The first quarter was in :54 4-5,
and when he announced to me I gave
up and was relieved that I did not
have to try further. However, the boys
were all up with me, and I thought I
would go the next part at a good
I pace to kill them off and then loaf
home. The result was I hit the 6(50
bn schedule, and after leaving there,
Windnagle, Cornell's best, came up
on my shoulder and I had to race all
the way to the tape to get rid of him.

Time 1.52 1-5.
