# WATER POLO TEAMS TO OPPOSE BEARS IN SEASON'S FIRST MEET
## O'Connor and Christenson Figure as Outstanding Men on Varsity 
### 
The Stanford water polo teams, both
varsity and freshman, will face those
from California in their first inter
collegiate contest this year Friday
night at the Athens Club pool in Oak
land. After the success of the Cardinal
swimmers over Oregon last Saturday,
coupled with the hard practice that
Coach Brandsten has been giving his
men, the Stanford teams are prepared
to give the Golden Bear a good fight.

O'Connor, Van den Akker, and Chris
tenson will start as varsity forwards,
Captain Williams, Ward, and Maltby
as guards, and Poulson as goal-keeper.
Strong, Thurlow, Burns, and Hinkle
will be on hand for substitutes.
On the freshman team, Harrison,
Driggs, and McCurdy will cover the
forward positions, Captain Hobdy,
Pahl, and Peters, the guards, and Ger
stenkorn, goal-keeper. Substitutes are
Kinkead and Doerr.
In the scrimmages during the past
week, Hobdy and Christenson have
been showing up especially well. Both
men are nearly equal in ability, and,
as a result, put up plenty of competi
tion for each other. O'Connor is at the
top of his form, passing with accuracy,
and getting around with speed enough
to baffle the freshmen. Gerstenkorn
and Poulson are both doing good work
in front of the goals, although both
have had bad luck during the past
few games.
Christenson, who is playing his first
season of polo, is one of the outstand
ing forwards on the varsity. In last
night's game, he consistently made
perfect throws and passes. Though
not getting his passes very well, Van
den Akker is one of the fastest men
on the team, using clever dribbling
and guarding.
Harrison stands out as the fresh
men's best forward. As a member of
the Venice team that won the South
ern California championship, he ac
quired training that is standing him
in good stead now. Williams, Ward,
and Maltby will probably offer suffi
cient resistance to the California for
wards if they show up as well as they
have been doing in the past.
