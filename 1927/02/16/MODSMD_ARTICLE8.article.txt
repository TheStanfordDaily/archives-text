# CAGE MENTOR PLANS NEW COMBLNATION IN BABES' SECOND GAME
## Team Preparing for Return Contest with Cub Five Saturday Night 
### 
Using two new combinations in
scrimmage and a corrective system of
floor plays, Coach Husky Hunt is pre
paring for the second game with the
California freshmen when they take
the floor in the pavilion against the
Stanford yearlings Saturday night.
Berg and Bush, the forwards that
started the game last week, were
used with Dowling at center and
Smith at the running guard position.
Thompson held his own berth as
standing guard. In the California game
Smith did not go bad at running guard
as he handled the ball well and cov
ered his territory. He makes a strong
bid for this place on the squad.
Dowling, who was used at forward
during the last part of the Bear-Stan
ford game, has greatly improved his
standing on the team by the showing
made in scrimmage yesterday and
Monday. He is good on the follow-up
shots and plays an aggressive game.
The other team that scrimmaged
yesterday was composed of Stewart
and Garibotto, forwards, Rothert, cen
ter, Simkins and Albertson, guards.
Stewart and Garibotto proved a
smooth pair that went well on the
offensive plays. Albertson is improv
ing as a guard and will give Coach
Hunt another man to choose from in
filling this position.
With the scrimmage yesterday, the
freshmen will round off the remaining
three days of practice with lighter
work each practice, finally graduating
into floor plays and basket-shooting.
