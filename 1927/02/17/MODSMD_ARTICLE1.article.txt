# HUNT STRESSES STRONG ATTACK IN HEAVY DRILL
## Improved Basket-Shooting Exhibited by Forwards; McCandless Good ROUGH GAME EXPECTED Coach Emphasizes Accurate Passing, Speedy Floor Work in Practices 
### Fred Speers 
Only one more practice session yet re
mains before Stanford and California
basketball teams meet in the first clash
of their annual series tomorrow night in
Oakland. Coach Hunt sent his
men through intensive drill on attacking
work last night to balance the defensive
practice gone over in the preceding prac
tice.
Speed and quick, sure passing were
the main things emphasized by the Car
dinal mentor in practice last night. Us
ing several second-string men, he was
able to form a defending tpam of the
desired strength so that the varsity did
not have an easy time running through
offensive plays.
Bryant and McCandless were used last
night at forward berths. Both seem to
be in better shape than they have been
for several days. McCandless has re
gained his stride and something of his
basket shooting ability, particularly from
the corners of the floor closest the goal.
Jayrcd's long stride which enables him
to carry a rushing attack close to an
opponent's goal is of value provided his
flanking forwards are able to get down
the floor fast enough to lend him sup
port. It is for proper co-ordination/ in
this attack that Hunt is working.
Anderson and Vincenti started at the
guard berths last night and in all proba
bility they will start in tomorrow night's
game. Biaggini and Lewis were later
given an opportunity to show their worth
at these berths.
Hard playing on the part of Stanford's
guards tomorrow night will be essential
and all four of Husky Hunt's guards are
capable of such playing. Checking Cor
bin, California's sophomore ace, in his
close work under the basket will be no
simple task.
Later substitutions in practice last night
were Christ for Bryant, Price for Mc-
Candless, and Dobson for Jay red. From
all indications tomorrow night's game
will be a rough one and the more men
that arc able to fit in lor use, the better
prepared will be Stanford.
After much dickering, agreement on
officials has been reached after the mat
ter was placed in the graduate managers'
hands. The two men chosen are Frank
Needles, referee, and Eddie Penaluna,
umpire. Both of these men have been
approved by Coaches Price and Hunt and
the managers of the two teams. There
is a possibility that Needles may be en
gaged for Friday night, in which case
another choice will have to be agreed
upon.
