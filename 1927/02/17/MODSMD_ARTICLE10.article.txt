# EDITOR OF SAN JOSE PAPER TO ADDRESS JOURNALIST MEETING
## 
### 
Arthur L. Clark, editor-in-chief of
the San Jose Mercury Herald, will
speak at the meeting of the Stanford
Journalists Club tonight at 6 o'clock
at the Delta Chi house.
" Clark will speak on journalistic
problems. He has held positions rang
ing from small city journalism to
metropolitan work in New York, Chi
cago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
Clark first formed the conception
of starting a tabloid newspaper. His
plan was blocked by a government
limit on the U3e of print paper as a
war emergency. Seven years ago when
Robert Patterson of the Chicago Tri
bune established the New York News
as a tabloid paper, Clark was called
on to carry out his former ideas.
A physical breakdown sent Clark to
Los Angeles shortly after, to recuper
ate. He became editor-in-chief of the
Mercury-Herald last March.
Election of officers of the Journal
ists Club will precede Clark's address.
