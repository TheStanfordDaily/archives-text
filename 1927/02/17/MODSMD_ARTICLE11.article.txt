# WIND, RAIN COMBINE WITH LIZZIE, TRAIN TO BREAK RECORD
## 
### 
For fourteen years a perfect
record â€”and then wind and rain
and the 11:39 P.M. train from
San Francisco combined Monday
night to cause a near-tragedy on
the Southern Pacific crossing at
University Avenue in Palo Alto
when a Ford coupe came skidding
through the gates, took a right
hand turn, aud slid on up to
within ten feet of (he oncoming
train. With a grinding protest of
brakes the engine came to a stop
just as four extremely active
Stanford roughs, trusting in them
selves rather than to a benign
providence, tumbled out of the
coupe and scattered in as many
directions over the slippery
tracks.
Neither coupe nor occupants
were hurt, only the gates which
have remained unscathed for
fourteen years paying the pen
alty of the wrathful elements. The
four roughs declined to give their
names.
