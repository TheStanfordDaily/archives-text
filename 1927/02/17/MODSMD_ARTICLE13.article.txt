# FRED BOWERS LEADS INTRAMURAL CAGERS BY 60-POINT SCORE
## Cook Misses First Place by Cancellation of Game; Finishes Fourth 
### 
Statistics covering the individual
records for the intramural basketball
tournament show Fred Bowers, Sigma
Chi, in the lead with sixty points. Pax
ton, Delta Chi player, is in second
place with fifty-six, and Clyne, Chi Psi,
with forty-five tallies, is third. Cook, a
Breakers man, formerly held the lead,
but one of the games was cancelled in
which he might have swelled his rec
ord. He finished the season with forty
four points. •
These four have all been spectacular
and consistent players during the en
tire tourney. Bowers and Cook seem
to have been especially valuable to
their respective outfits as Sigma Chi
and Breakers are both in the play-offs
which will take place this week.
