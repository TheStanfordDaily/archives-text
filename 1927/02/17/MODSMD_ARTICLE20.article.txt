## Fraternity Piles Up Lead in First Half; Club Team Rallies PHI KAPS DOWN A.T.O. Passes Accurate, Dribbling Fast; Most of Scoring In Second Period 
### 
Breakers 24—Alpha Delta Phi 21
Phi Kappa Sigma 22—Alpha Tail
Omega 13
Playing a type of basketball that
may easily carry them to the finals,
the Breakers defeated the Alpha Delt
five in a game filled with upsets and
surprises yesterday afternoon. Alpha
Tau Omega lost out early in their
contest with Phi Kappa Sigma, in an
other fast, clever match.
With Hoi man and Moore bewilder
ing the Breaker guards with their fast
fioorwork, the Alpha Delts managed
to build up a substantial lead during
the first half. Holman sank four field
goals without any trouble, while Moore
and Duckett fed accurate pa: ses to
him one after another. The Breakers
tried long shots, all unsuccessful until
late in the first period. Cook and
George, Breaker forwards, were un
able to pierce the tight defense cen
tered around Dennis, and were forced
to shoot from away back. Dennis, how
ever, was taken out on fouls, and be
fore the Alpha Delts could get to
gether, the Breakers were able to
finish the half 13 to 6.
At the start of the second half,
Worden broke away and sank a short
shot; that basket marked the begin
ning of a fast Breaker rally, for in a
few minutes the Alpha Delts were
leading by only two points. Moore
made one shot to hold off the on
slaught, but Harlow and Bush soon
tied the score. The same two men
again dropped in field goals, and al
though the Alpha Delts made one
more basket, the game ended 24 to 21
with the Breakers ahead.
After the first few skirmishes, both
teams started to play excellent basket
ball. The passes were accurate and
the dribbles fast. Dennis, Evans, and
Meeks for the losers, and Macdonald,
Bush, and Harris for the Breakers,
played practically an air-tight defense
for most of the game.
Phi Kaps Safe
With the shooting of McCulloeh and
Saunders, the Phi Kaps were never in
danger of losing to the A.T.O.'s. The
game was very ragged at first, but as
the men got into their stride, the
careless passes and long shots were
stopped. Hossom led the A.T.O.'s in
scoring, and showed a clever game on
the floor. McCulloeh, however, in spite
of the tumbles he took, was a dead
shot from anywhere near the basket,
and, with the fast work of Saunders
near the foul line, the Phi Kaps kept
ahead of their opponents after the first
basket.
Most of the scoring came in the
second half, when Saunders scored
four field goals, and McCulloch two
fouls and a field goal. The latter made
a perfect record in his free throws,
making four. Every man on the win
ning team had at least one foul called
on him, while three of the men needed
but one more personal to be sent from
the game.
