In today s Campus Opinion column appear two viewpoints from two
different Stanford women. They both object strenuously to the editorial
which appeared in last Friday's paper. One of the writers adds in a
postscript that "lots of girls feel the same way about the whole situation."
So the Daily feels that it is its duty to briefly •comment on the communi
cations, and, at least, try to justify its stand on the situation.
Both young ladies blamed The Stanford Daily for broadcasting the
women's action to the world. They are altogether wrong in believing
this. One of the letters reads as follows: "The discussion and first
election was carried on so quietly that nothing got outside until President
Wilbur had signed it." Why was this true? Because the Daily held the
news at the request of the women's council. The result of the first
election was known to the paper one hour after the discussion was
concluded, but this news was not published until the okeh of the president
was received.
And then, after the final action was taken, the Daily refused to print
the story until it realized that three press associations, national in scope,
wired the hot news to all parts of the world. Then observe the way the
story, brought into the office by the women members, was printed. It
was run in the most conservative manner, giving the facts and nothing
else. The rules were printed in whole, so that there would be no
exaggerating of the women's action. The news that was objectionable
was not supplied by the Daily.
That the particular girls who wrote today saw the account of their
action in the Daily was quite natural, as the campus paper was able to
present the news before the San Francisco editions could be sent to the
University.
Now do not misunderstand. Nothing has been said as to whether or
not we believe in the women smoking. As was remarked last Friday,
smoking is a personal habit, and not the business of outsiders. It was
quite natural that the news services should grab tip the women's action,
for the Stanford five hundred have long had a reputation of being—well,
rather conservative. Most of the women knew what the result would be
before passing the rule, and they took the action regardless of the
consequences.
