"The Memorial Church is unique
among the university chapels of Amer
ica," said Dr. Theodore Gerard Soares
of the University of Chicago, speaking
at recent chapel meeting.
Dr. Soares is correct. Furthermore,
it is safe to say that the Memorial
Church will remain unique among uni
versity chapels, barring the remote
possibility that a university is erected
in Hollywood.
Dr. Soares went on to say that there
was a Byzantine splendor about the
chapel that reminded him of St.
Marks, the Church of Saint Sophia,
etcetera, etcetera.
We are reminded of the poem that
appeared some years ago in Cabbages.

llt described a stranger, standing in
the center of the Quad, his attention
I riveted upon the chapel, apparently in
awe and admiration. When questioned
by a student, he volunteered the in
formation that he was watching the
picture, waiting for the ballyhoo to
jbegin.
I The next time you pass this rococco
edifice note the striking similarity
! between its mosaics and those gaily
colored posters that hang above side
show tents. The only thing that is
missing is a caption. In order to com
plete the similarity, we submit the
following: "Come in and HEAR the
Sermon on the Mount! See Faith,
; Hope, and Charity IN PERSON!"
