The Editor, Sir:
I hate to bring up any more discus
sion about this smoking question, but
—I certainly think that editorial in
Friday's papr/r was mighty poor! I
was one of those who argued loudly ;
against smoking, voted "no" both!
times, and was very ashamed and
disappointed when the measure
passed, but I cannot tell you how I
resented that article. "It seems that
the whole matter of women smoking
was handled in an awkward manner."
How would the bright 2000 have man
aged such a thinp? Something had to
be done, and the discussion and first
election were carried on so quietly
that almost nothing got outside until
President Wilbur had signed it. Then
who made the racket? "But it's her
own fault; she started the stories" —
the first story I ever saw was in this
paper, not to mention the second,
third, and most of the rest. If you
of the Daily had only been able to
realize that we didn't want to make
any radical changes or rumpus, but
merely to quietly remove an obsolete
ruling, and if you had not blunderingly
jumped on it as a gorgeous chance
for a good story and started the whole
thing yourself, you would not be sud
denly turning on us with such a nasty
and unfair "editorial."
Sincerely, A Stanford Woman.
