The Editor, Sir:
Tn view of a very recent editorial,
and in order that the uninformed
public may know, I must point out
that whatever national publicity the
Stanford women received in the pass
age of the new smoking rule was due
solely to The Stanford Daily. The
Daily hopped joyously on the juicy
bit of news the moment they were
allowed to publish it. The Daily broad
casts play-by-play everything of note
that occurs on this campus. At any
rate, the women were praised for
their common sense and directness by
the former editor, the Bull Session,
and the staff —but it's all over now.
We must retire to the background and
be ashamed of ourselves all because
of a puritanical editor and a sudden
change in Daily policy. Also, since it
is the first duty of the paper, and
especially of its editor, to be accurate,
I may say that there was no picture
of Stanford women "lighting up" pub
lished in any San Francisco paper.
In order to clear up any further
misapprehension, dear editor, may I
say that the public couldn't possibly
be forming a beautiful picture of
Stanford women —they have long since
known that there are no beautiful
Stanford women (due to more pub
licity at the hands of Stanford men),
but rather they think of us as homely
bores and Phi Betes poring over
books, but now, thank God!, there is
added to the picture a cigarette which
at least testifies to our advancement
and eccentricity.
So be it! —I. M. Notanimport.
