The Editor, Sir:
In our busy lives around this Uni
versity, we often fail to appreciate the
real values and opportunities offered
us. We forget that we are supposed to
be a select group; a group of indi
viduals who are able to assume re
sponsibility. Stanford was founded for
us, and yet how many of us really ap
preciate the educational opportunities
offered in the lecture room, seminar
room, laboratory, and our magnificent
library?
I speak of the library with most em
phasis, because it is the educational
workshop. It collects and catalogues

books from all sources and then per
mits us to use them. This, indeed, is a
great credit to the library.
But there is another great function
of the library. It seems as though this
important part of our University has
hs&umed the duty of looking after our
morals. Yes, it has joined hands with
the Y.M.C.A. in attempting to solve
the moral problems of the campus.
But how is it doing this?
Briefly, this is the way. The library
knows its books and, moved by a puri
tanical sentiment, it believes that
some of the books should be kept out
of the hands of this select and intelli
gent group of college students. The
library believes that we are mere chil
dren, unable to think seriously about
and to understand moral problems.
Moreover, it believes that we should
be left as ignorant as possible about
certain things fundamental to correct
living and relationships. Consequently,
it keeps certain historical pamphlets
and psychology books, as well as some
fiction books and novels, out of our
hands.
Fair enough, but why have these
said pamphlets and books in the li
brary? They tempt us and the fact
that we can not use them gives us a
wrong impression of the officials of
the library. The proper thing to do is
either replace these said works with
1 Mother Goose Rhymes or else let us
use them and elevate ourselves from
our ignorant situation.
