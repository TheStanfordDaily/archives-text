"I thought that those men in dirty corduroys were employees of the
University," said Dr. Theodore Gerard Soares, of the University of Chicago,
when told of the Stanford "rough" tradition. Dr. Soares spoke at the daily
chapel in Memorial Church Tuesday and Wednesday mornings of this week.
"I would have judged that there was a large industrial population here from
the number of men in what were apparently work clothes, that I saw in
Palo Alto. On the campus 1 have not seen so many, as the rainy weather
necessitated the wearing of slickers," he continued.
"The custom of wearing 'cords' is, however, quite a good feature if it is
not carried too far. It is certainly better than the Eastern habit of over
dressing that results in 'duclishness.' Where all the men are striving to dress
better Jhan their classmates, there is bound to be hard feeling and its
resultant evils. Where the men all wear cords, there is a spirit of democracy

on the campus, where all, rich and
poor alike, look the same. I do not be
lieve, however, that it should be car
ried to the extreme where all men
appear slovenly and disreputable," Dr.
Soares went on to say.
Dr. Soares says that Stanford's
chapel plan is the only feasible one.
In quoting Dr. Moore of Harvard Uni
versity, he said: "You can have com
pulsory chapel service or you can
have religion; you can not have both."
Dr. Soares states that voluntary
chapel service can be made a success
only through the development of an
"esprit de corps" among the students
for it. Smith College has developed
this spirit and their voluntary chapel
service is very successful.
In speaking of the Stanford Me
morial Church, Dr. Soares said it is
unique among the university chapels
of America, practically all ol which are
in the severe Gothic type of archi
tecture.
"There is a Byzantine splendor
about the Stanford church," said Dr.
Soares, "that reminds me of Saint
Mark's Cathedral in Venice, or the
Church of Santa Sophia in Constnti
nople. The architect who planned it
chose a scheme that fits perfectly into
the atmosphere and climate of Cali
fornia and Stanford. Any other type
would have been out-of-place. As it is,
it is a part of the whole inspiring pic
ture made by the Stanford campus."

"I thought that those men in dirty corduroys were employees of the
University," said Dr. Theodore Gerard Soares, of the University of Chicago,
when told of the Stanford "rough" tradition. Dr. Soares spoke at the daily
chapel in Memorial Church Tuesday and Wednesday mornings of this week.
"I would have judged that there was a large industrial population here from
the number of men in what were apparently work clothes, that I saw in
Palo Alto. On the campus 1 have not seen so many, as the rainy weather
necessitated the wearing of slickers," he continued.
"The custom of wearing 'cords' is, however, quite a good feature if it is
not carried too far. It is certainly better than the Eastern habit of over
dressing that results in 'duclishness.' Where all the men are striving to dress
better Jhan their classmates, there is bound to be hard feeling and its
resultant evils. Where the men all wear cords, there is a spirit of democracy

on the campus, where all, rich and
poor alike, look the same. I do not be
lieve, however, that it should be car
ried to the extreme where all men
appear slovenly and disreputable," Dr.
Soares went on to say.
Dr. Soares says that Stanford's
chapel plan is the only feasible one.
In quoting Dr. Moore of Harvard Uni
versity, he said: "You can have com
pulsory chapel service or you can
have religion; you can not have both."
Dr. Soares states that voluntary
chapel service can be made a success
only through the development of an
"esprit de corps" among the students
for it. Smith College has developed
this spirit and their voluntary chapel
service is very successful.
In speaking of the Stanford Me
morial Church, Dr. Soares said it is
unique among the university chapels
of America, practically all ol which are
in the severe Gothic type of archi
tecture.
"There is a Byzantine splendor
about the Stanford church," said Dr.
Soares, "that reminds me of Saint
Mark's Cathedral in Venice, or the
Church of Santa Sophia in Constnti
nople. The architect who planned it
chose a scheme that fits perfectly into
the atmosphere and climate of Cali
fornia and Stanford. Any other type
would have been out-of-place. As it is,
it is a part of the whole inspiring pic
ture made by the Stanford campus."
