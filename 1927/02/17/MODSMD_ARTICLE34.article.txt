# PREACHERS NOT ABLE TO DECIDE EVOLUTION QUESTION-WENDELL

"Preachers and legislators are not
qualified to pass judgment upon the
validity of the evolutionary theory,"
Reverend C. A. Wendell, Lutheran
minister, asserted in an address to
University of Minnesota students.
"Christ never commissioned His
followers to make laws against free
speech, nor did He ever demand of
them that they adhere to this or that
view of the Bible," declared the
speaker. The real purpose of the
Bible, he thinks, would be diverted
and bring contempt upon the church
by a multitude of men devoted to the
truth, if legislative enactment against
teaching of evolution were passed.
"Legislators are no more fitted to
discuss evolution than are biologists
qualified to pronounce dictums upon
the proper modes of baptism," Rever
end Wendell concluded.
