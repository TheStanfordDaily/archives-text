"Present-day students don't know
now to read or write or think, and the
situation is getting worse every year,"
David Ferdinand Swenson, professor
of philosophy and sage of the Univer
sity of Minnesota campus, stated in a
review of thirty years' teaching.
"Students don't care for intellectual
growth; they merely -want to get by.
rpr instance, jf they write something
On a quiz, and If it is anywhere
the thing they are trying to say they
let it go. They don't work to get words
to express exact thought. Oh no! Any
thing remotely near the meaning will
do."
Declaring that he sees a gradual
let-down in the educational morale of
modern colleges, Professor Swenc-on
says that the tone of modern schools
is determined by the loafers, and not
hy the workers. When quizzed con
cerning a remedy, he stated:
"The first thing is to teach students
how to read and write and think.
Then they go ahead profitably with
other things. Logic helps in that.
Knowledge obtained from study of
logic is not great, but the intellectual
training is valuable."
