Approximately 1000' women students
at the University of Texas will be
housed in university dormitories next
fall when the latest building is com
pleted. Men students at Texas, on the
other hand, have but little dormitory
accommodation, room being provided
for but 100 men. Texas fraternities
I house 350 men, and the sororities 150
women.
