## 
### 
Fascism and present conditions in
Italy will be subjected to critical
analysis in the debates between Stan
ford and the University of Southern
California here February 28 and there
March 2.
The question is: "Resolved, That
Mussolini is a benefactor to Italy."
Louis Creveling and Harold W. Peter
son will debate the affirmative at
Stanford; Theodore F. Baer and
Charles C. Scott will go South and

ence polls taken before and after the
debates will decide the winners.
An analysis of the Fascisti move
ment and an attempt to get behind
the scenes in order to find out what
is actually happening in Italy is the
problem of the debate teams. Since
Mussolini marched on Rome in 1922
it has been predicted that his power
would be short-lived. Each year the
prophesy has remained unrealized. It
is being seriously questioned as to
whether Italy has not finally found a
man with a real formula for its ad
ministration.
Stanford debated U.S.C. on an in
definite schedule until the fall of 1923
at which time a definite schedule of
debate was established. Since then,
the two universities have met each
year and both are members of the
Pacific Forensic League.
