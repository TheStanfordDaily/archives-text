# WALK-AWAY. CLOSE GAME FEATURE FIRST ENCINA CAGE GAMES
## 
### 
One walk-away and one close game
featured the opening play in the En
eina basketball tourney. The 2W five
eliminated 3E by downing them 20' to
8, while the Basement quint defeated
the IE team 8 to 6.
Crowson and Allendorf, each with
ten points, tied for high-point man in
the first game. Marx and Lewis ably
broke up the 3E offenses.
Qn the losing team, Nye, Sharp, and
Hadenfelt bore the brunt of the work.
Hadenfelt showed up well at center,
but could not equal .the shooting of
Allendorf.
The second was won by a closer
margin, the Basement coming out
ahead 6 to 8 over the IE quintet. The
half ended with the Basement leading
3 to 2. In the next period, the IE men
crept up and passed the leaders, but
lost out with a minute to play.
. Stewart and Bianchi both tried long
arched shots, but very few of these
were successful. The guarding was not
very close, but the defense usually
were able to intercept bad passes.
With the score 6 to 5 against them,
the Basement team tightened up. and
Levitt, center, finally won the game
with a free throw and a field goal.
