# WEATHER PREVENTS PRACTICE TILT WITH REDWOOD CITY-NINE
## Lack of Practice Hampers Team in Santa Clara Game Saturday 
### 
Postponement of the scheduled prac
tice game between the Stanford varsity
baseball team and the Redwood Cty
Police nine this afternoon is necessary
because of the wet playing field due to
the recent rain, according to Coach
Harry Wolter.
The Cardinals will enter the Santa
Clara tussle on Saturday in a stale con
dition because of inability to practice 011
the wet field. However, the varsity has
apparently struck its stride, tor th&quad
jj? rapidly improving in fielding and bat
ting.
While the Pjroncos bowed before the
hard hitting and superior playing of
Wolter's men last Saturday, they pre
sented a strong team and plan to even
the series this week. Captain Steve Col
lins and Cook Sypher formed an effec
tive battery during the entire contest, but
it is probable that Wolter will start So
bieski in place of Collins for the second
game.
The Cardinal infield, composed of Ma
nure, Garibaldi, Busch, and Rogers, has
been performing well thus far this sea
son, while Coach Wolter has a host of
flvchasers for the outfield. Chief among
the latter is Gene Nisscn, who has been
playing a steady game at centerfield.
• Weather permitting, the Cards will
resume practice as soon as possible, stiff
workouts being held to make up for lost
time. Practice will stress batting and
infield work.
