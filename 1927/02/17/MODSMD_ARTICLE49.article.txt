# CHOICE OF FRESHMAN FIVE FOR NEXT GAME PRESENTS PROBLEM
## Hunt Faced with Puzzle in Selecting Combination To Meet Cubs 
### Merle Emry 
Who to play or who not to play?
This is tiie puzzling question which
Coach Husky Hunt faces in selecting
the combination that will function the
best when the Stanford freshmen bat
tle the Cubs Saturday night in the
pavilion in the second game of the
California series.
It" Coach Hunt were sure that any
Jive of his prodigies would play the
same smooth game Saturday night
•which they have exhibited during the
last three practices, he would have
this question answered. Every possible
combination has been tried in scrim
mage; some are good and some are
better, but the point is to find which
•will go the best against the Cubs of
the Berkeley Hear.
New Five Used
Tn the first contest the Cardinal
mentor started a new combination
that had shown up better than any
other during the practice days, but
this brought out the fact that Simkins
was off his game and that Rothert was
not holding the center berth to the
!>est of his ability. In fact, the whole
team seemed bewildered during the
first half.
In the second half, the plays on
■which the team had been drilled and
redrilled began to develop more as
they had in practice and the Babes
Kot going.
Game on Home Floor
Being on their home floor Saturday
night, plus the experience gained
against the Berkeley infants, the Stan
ford Babes should give a better ac
count of themselves. The sport col
umns of the Daily Californian frankly
admit that the California freshmen
)>iayed their best game of the season
ngainst Stanford and seriously doubt
jf Grace and Captain Nealson can re
peat the exhibition of long-distance
basket-shooting they gave a week ago.
With the defense work that Coach
Hunt has been giving the Babes dur
ing the last three practices, it looks
decidedly doubtful if the two Califor
nia stars will be running as wild as
they did in the first game of the series.
