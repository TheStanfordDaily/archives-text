# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Wouldn't it be interesting if Jim Ma
loney were to beat Jack Delaney tomor
row night, in their much-talked-of battle
in Madison Square Garden, New York
City, and then go on to win Tex Richard's
series of heavyweight elimination bouts,
and finally the world's championship from
Gene Tunney? I don't mean that it would
be interesting because Maloney has been
called "a second John L. Sullivan," or
because lie lacks any of the necessary
qualifications of a heavyweight cham
pion, but because of a story that came out
in a national weekly magazine in July,
1925. Let me remind you of it.
According to Bill Cunningham, the
writer of the story, Jack Kearns, believ
ing that Dempsey would never fight
again, and having seen Jim Maloney in
action and being much impressed with
his looks and ability, approached the
young Boston lad with a most astounding
offer. Maloney was to break with his
manager, Johnny McGrath, and secretly
take Kearns as his boss. He would then
be starred in a series of motion pictures
as "the logical successor to Tack Demp
sey,and then continue the ballyhoo by
winning a few easy victories around New
York, and then in California.
The next step, according to this story
of Kearns's plans, was for Dempsey and

Maloney to be matched, with the cham
pion finally announcing that he found
he'd been away from the ring too long
to get in shape, and would retire unde
feated, bestowing his title on Jim Ma
loney ! Thus would Kearns retain his
control over the title. But, so the story
went, Maloney would have none of
Kearns's offer, he would stick by his man
ager, with whom he had grown up, and
he'd win the world's heavyweight title
openly and above board 1
So now we find Dynamite Jim much
more in the limelight than ex-champion
Jack, and, after disposing of Dc Kuh,
Diener, and Persson, ready to face the
hardest test of his career." Maloney's rec
ord among the heavyweights is far bet
ter than Delaney's, and he will enter the
ring knowing that he has the advantage
in weight and strength. But will these
offset the fact that he is up against a
champion and a master-boxer who also
packs a lot of dynamite? If Jim beats
Jack, he is well on the way to the title
Kearns is said to have offered him back
in 1925.

Can He Crush Delaney?
Wouldn't it be interesting if Jim Ma
loney were to beat Jack Delaney tomor
row night, in their much-talked-of battle
in Madison Square Garden, New York
City, and then go on to win Tex Richard's
series of heavyweight elimination bouts,
and finally the world's championship from
Gene Tunney? I don't mean that it would
be interesting because Maloney has been
called "a second John L. Sullivan," or
because lie lacks any of the necessary
qualifications of a heavyweight cham
pion, but because of a story that came out
in a national weekly magazine in July,
1925. Let me remind you of it.
According to Bill Cunningham, the
writer of the story, Jack Kearns, believ
ing that Dempsey would never fight
again, and having seen Jim Maloney in
action and being much impressed with
his looks and ability, approached the
young Boston lad with a most astounding
offer. Maloney was to break with his
manager, Johnny McGrath, and secretly
take Kearns as his boss. He would then
be starred in a series of motion pictures
as "the logical successor to Tack Demp
sey,and then continue the ballyhoo by
winning a few easy victories around New
York, and then in California.
The next step, according to this story
of Kearns's plans, was for Dempsey and

Maloney to be matched, with the cham
pion finally announcing that he found
he'd been away from the ring too long
to get in shape, and would retire unde
feated, bestowing his title on Jim Ma
loney ! Thus would Kearns retain his
control over the title. But, so the story
went, Maloney would have none of
Kearns's offer, he would stick by his man
ager, with whom he had grown up, and
he'd win the world's heavyweight title
openly and above board 1
So now we find Dynamite Jim much
more in the limelight than ex-champion
Jack, and, after disposing of Dc Kuh,
Diener, and Persson, ready to face the
hardest test of his career." Maloney's rec
ord among the heavyweights is far bet
ter than Delaney's, and he will enter the
ring knowing that he has the advantage
in weight and strength. But will these
offset the fact that he is up against a
champion and a master-boxer who also
packs a lot of dynamite? If Jim beats
Jack, he is well on the way to the title
Kearns is said to have offered him back
in 1925.
