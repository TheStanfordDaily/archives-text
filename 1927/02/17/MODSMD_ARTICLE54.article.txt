"Alfred Wegener generalizes too
easily from othet generalizations and '
does not pay enough attention to his
torical geology," said Professor C.
Schuchert, visiting geologist from
Yale University, in speaking to a
group of students yesterday on Wege
ner's "Hypothesis of Continental Dis
placement."
Few paleontologists agree with
Wegener's hypothesis, and Dr, Schu
chert is among these. However, he |
does believe that the continents on
the earth are moving, but not in the 1
manner described in Wegener's |
theory.
The visitor declared that we are •
on the verge of new things not wholly [
explainable by the shrinkage of the .
earth idea and that some other theory 1
must be used to satisfactorily explain
the formation of mountains.
