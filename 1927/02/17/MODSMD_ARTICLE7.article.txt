# EIGHT BOXING BOUTS SCHEDULED BETWEEN CARDS, AGGIE TEAM
## Miron's Match With Davis Captain Expected to Be Feature 
### 
Eight high-class bouts, including one
exhibition, will feature the first out
side competition for the 1927 Stanford
varsity boxing team when Coach
Harry W. Maloney's men enter the
ring against, the California Aggies
tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock in the
pavilion.
Reputed to have one of the best
balanced squads in collegiate circles
on the coast, the Aggies, led by Cap
tain Gomez, the scrappy featherweight
who has "captured the intercollegiate
title for the past two years, will ar
rive at 1 o'clock tomorrow from Davis,
when they will weigh in, preparatory
to the meet.
Predict Fast Featherweight Bout
It is the fight between this same
Captain Gomez and Stanford's captain,
Ca<rlos Miron, at 129 pounds, that
should be the main attraction of the
evening. For two years now, Gomez
has taken the title away from the
Cardinal captain by just the shade of
the referee's decision, and in the Far
Western Tournament last year, the
men were forced to enter a fourth
round before Gomez was awarded the
scrap.
The exhibition bout will be fought
in the bantamweight class, between
Les Cowan of Stanford and A. Catam
bay of the Aggies, two men who are
ineligible for college competition, but
are of collegiate calibre. Cowan won
the title in the bantam class in the
recent Novice Tournament.
Lightweights Not Yet Picked
Due to tight competition for varsity
berths in the lightweight and welter
weight divisions, Coach Maloney has
not been able yet to decide who will
represent Stanford tomorrow night.
However, there will be two bouts in the
lightweight class that will count in the
final scoring, since the Farmers and
Stanford have the men to put in the
ring. \
In the middleweight division at 160
pounds, Myron Schall, last year's var
sity captain, will face G. Garner of
the Aggies. Schall has yet to be de
feated in intercollegiate competition,
and in his third year of competition
for Stanford should give his opponent
a fast time in the squared circle.
Fain Light-Heavy Choice
Norm Fain, who is starting his sec
ond season on the varsity, will find a
tough customer in E. Craemer, one of
the Aggie's standbys for honors in the
light-heavy fight at 175 pounds.
Richard Dorman and D. Mulkey will
end the Card fighting in the heavy
division. With no varsity bantam
weight to represent the Farmers, the
bout in this class has been forfeited
to Stanford.
Student body cards will admit hold
! ers, while outsiders will be charged
| the regular price of fifty cents.
