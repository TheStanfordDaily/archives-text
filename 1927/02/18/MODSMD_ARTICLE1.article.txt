# BABE QUINTET PLAYS SECOND CUB CONTEST
## Card Yearlings Will Have Advantage of Playing On Own Floor USE NEW COMBINATION California Youngsters Beat Stanford in First Game of Series 
### Merle Emry 
With odds practically even, Stanford's
freshman basketball squad will enter in
the second contest of the annual Cali
fornia series when it meets the Golden
Bear Cubs at 8 o'clock tomorrow night
in the Pavilion.
Although the Cardinal beginners lost
their first game to California a week ago,
it is not to be taken for granted that
Clint Evans' machine will be able to roll
•out another victory so easily against
Coach Husky Hunt's prodigies.
The California freshmen were playing
an unusually high brand of basketball in
the first game and it is to be questioned
if they can rise to the same level tomor
row night. Another factor to be fig
ured upon is that the game will be held
on the Babes' home floor. This should
give them more confidence.
Practice during the last week brought
out that the combination composed of
Berg and Garibotto, forwards; Bush, cen
ter ; Smith and Thompson, guards, goes
the best. This is the probable lineup that
will start for Stanford. As Clint
Evans did not make one substitution
during last Friday's game, he is expected
to start the same five men: Nealson and
Grace, forwards; Eyck, center, and Iver
son and Ehman, guards.
With the new arrangement, the Car
dinal freshmen will be represented by a
smooth and speedy system. Berg and
Garibotto have been running through all
the scrimmages together and have been
consistently accurate in hitting the bas
ket and in passing the ball. Smith, at
running guard, will furnish additional
speed to the floor plays, besides being
a capable guard. Bush has been prac
ticing on the side-shots and has acquired
a true eye for dropping the ball in the
hoop.
If this combination does not function
well against the fast rushes and distant
shooting of the California yearlings,
Hunt can send Stewart to forward,
Simpkins to standing guard, and Rothert
to the pivot position. All of these men
are tall, and if height is necessary, they
•will be used.
