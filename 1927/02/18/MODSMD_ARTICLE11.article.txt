"Athletics is the cause of most of
the discordant rivalry between univer
| sities," said Dr. Charles Schuchert,
i professor emeritus of paleontology at
Yale and the foremost authority 011
I paleogeography, during an interview
j yesterday."The present Harvard-
Princeton dissension is due largely'to
! intercollegiate sports. Most universi
ties are run by athletics. Faculties
i decry the prevailing conditions, but
lack the support of the alumni in this.
"I would abolish intercollegiate ath
j letics and carry 011 the work between
j classes and parts of classes in the
individual institutions, so as to pro
mote the welfare of the individual stu
dent, and thus end the present trend
; toward professionalism," continued
| Dr. Schuchert.
| "Petty and useless rivalries arise
from the comparison of the relative
merits of two universities," stated Dr.
Schuchert. "Yale has two hundred
I years of tradition and history behind
|it that are both a help and a hin
drance to its progress. Stanford is
pioneering and is in this way unham
pered by the dictates of a long past.
The environments of the two schools
are totally different. This would tend
to make them unlike xin many re
spects. For example, field work in
1 geology cannot be begun until April
j at Yale and cannot be continued much
beyond October; whereas at Stanford
: such work can be carried on through
| out the year.
"The opportunities for geological
advancement at Stanford are splen
did," he further stated, "with its excel
-1 lent and widely known geological fac
ulty and its great facilities for such
: work."
