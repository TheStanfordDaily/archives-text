# FIJI INTRAMURAL FIVE MEETS SIGMA CHIS IN ELMINATION PLAY-OFF
## 
### 
Concluding the opening round of the
elimination tournament in intramural
basketball, the Phi Gamma Delta team
will play the Sigma Chi five at 4:15 this
afternoon. At 5, Sequoia I and the In
dians will meet.
The first match is predicted to end as
closely as did the Breaker-Alpha Delt
game on Wednesday. Bowers, outstand
ing Sigma Chi forward, and Gregory,
high point man for the Fi j is, will have
great difficulty in breaking through the
close guarding that both teams have been
using for the past weeks.
With victories over the strong teams
from S.A.E., A.K.L., and the Dekes, the
Indian quintet is entering against Se
quoia I with slight odds to win.
