# CAMPUS JOURNALISTS PROPOSE PLANS FOR PUBLICATIONS BOARD
## Editorial, Financial Control Will Remain Outside Of New Council 
### 
Proposing a Publications Council, com- j
posed of representatives of undergradu- j
ate and alumni publications, which shall !
be responsible only to the President of j
the University, Professor E. W. Smith. !
spokesman for campus journalists, pre- i
sented a tentative plan for .incorporation '
in the constitution to the revision com- i
mittee yesterday afternoon.
This plan provides for general super- !
vision and control of all campus publi- j
cations by the proposed Publications'
Council. Although the proposal is de- j
signed to reserve to each individual pub- \
lication immediate financial and editorial j
control in order to promote initiative and '
originality, all other powers are to be i
vested in the Council. The plan calls!
further for incorporating the details of |
its organization in the by-laws of the ;
constitution.
Placing publications outside the con-!
trol of the Executive Committee was i
deemed advisable by the journalists be- \
cause of their peculiar relation to the j
University from a critical standpoint, i
This provision would effectively insure j
complete freedom t>f their editorial poli
cies, which it was felt might otherwise be |
tampered with if the occasion demanded. \
Publications Fund
Establishment of a Publications Fund !
is another feature of the proposed plan. j
It is suggested that each publication shall i
contribute to this fund a fixed sum, to I
be determined by the Publications Coun- j
cil by a unanimous vote, at the end of j
the spring quarter of each year. This |
fund is to be used for the benefit of any 1
or all publications, but any advances j
therefrom shall be regarded as loans to :
be repaid without interest by the bor- j
rower.
Submission of a profit and loss state
ment by each publication at the end of |
every quarter is also a requirement men- |
tioned in the plan.
Approval Withheld
Although no action was taken by the
committee, they will consider the plan in
detail at their next meeting, which is
scheduled for Monday afternoon at 4
oo'clock in the A.S.S.U. offices.
Approval of the by-laws of the Debate
Council was accomplished by the commit
tee. These included a provision allowing
the Debate Manager a salary of $25 per
quarter and prohibiting him from com
peting in any forensic contest.
