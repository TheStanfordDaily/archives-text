# CARDS-BEARS CLASH IN FIRS! GAME OF SERIES AT OAKLAND
## Both Teams Boast of Three Wins Over S.C., Bay Outfit Has Edge DAVID WILL NOT PLAY Hunt's Forwards Constitute Main Difficulty; Are Unknown Quantity 
### Fred Speers 
Meeting- California in the Oakland
auditorium at 8 o'clock tonight, Stanford,
like the Bears, goes into the contest with
three clear wins over the Southern Cali
fornia Trojans, but the Blue and Gold
players are given the edge by dopesters
of the game. The winner of the Stan
ford-California series will go north to
compete in the finals of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Stanford sends against the undefeated
Bears a team which has lost four games,
yet one which has shown in several other
games flashes of power which, if con
sistently maintained tonight, "should give
California a closer run for victory than
any team which the Bears have yet met.
As the old adage goes, "one can't always
tell what will happen when Stanford
and California clash."
Lineup
Following arc the announced lineups
for tonight:
Stanford California
Bryant F. Watson (C)
McCandless F. R. Dougery
Jayred C. Corbin
Vincenti G. J. Dougery
Anderson G. Dixon
Stanford's squad will be minus its cap-'
tain tonight and probably for the rest of
the season. Captain Nelson David's ill
ness has taken a turn for the worse, and
he is probably out of cage competition
for the season.
Coach Husky Hunt will rely tonight
upon a squad containing a well-rounded,
versatile set of players. In reserve, to
mention a few, are Christ, Biaggini,
Lewis, Dobson, Price, and Crary. Coach
Price likewise has his set of reserves
which, however, does not appear to have
the strength of Hunt's. California has
Fechter and Clynier (guards), Tripp and
Petersen (centers), and Butts and Eisan
(forwards).
Forwards a Problem
Stanford's forwards constitute Hunt's
main problem. If they are going right
their scoring will be done mainly under
the basket. If they arc not right, it will
be largely luck when they do score. Both
Bryant and McCandless are the best scor
ers of Hunt's forward material, Christ
not being up to their standard at tallies.
However, Christ can play a better floor
game than either on occasion.
California's scoring attack is more
versatile: Corbin doing much of it un
der the basket, while Watson and Jim
Dougery handle the attack from just be
yond the foul line.
At guards both teams are fairly strong,

California probably having the edge by
virtue of its taller men. Vincenti, Cardi
nal running guard, w ill be forced to
make up in aggressiveness what he lacks
in height. He may he called upon, as was
the case recently, to play forward while
Lewis goes in at running guard. This
however will arise only it Hunt's for
ward supply is diminished by fouls.
As a preliminary to the game, Cali
fornia's 145-pound team will meet the
Olympic Cardinals.
Frank Needles has definitely been
named for referee by the officials asso
ciation. Penaluma will umpire the con
test.
