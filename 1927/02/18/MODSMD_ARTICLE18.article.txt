### Fred Speers 
Meeting- California in the Oakland
auditorium at 8 o'clock tonight, Stanford,
like the Bears, goes into the contest with
three clear wins over the Southern Cali
fornia Trojans, but the Blue and Gold
players are given the edge by dopesters
of the game. The winner of the Stan
ford-California series will go north to
compete in the finals of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Stanford sends against the undefeated
Bears a team which has lost four games,
yet one which has shown in several other
games flashes of power which, if con
sistently maintained tonight, "should give
California a closer run for victory than
any team which the Bears have yet met.
As the old adage goes, "one can't always
tell what will happen when Stanford
and California clash."
Lineup
Following arc the announced lineups
for tonight:
Stanford California
Bryant F. Watson (C)
McCandless F. R. Dougery
Jayred C. Corbin
Vincenti G. J. Dougery
Anderson G. Dixon
Stanford's squad will be minus its cap-'
tain tonight and probably for the rest of
the season. Captain Nelson David's ill
ness has taken a turn for the worse, and
he is probably out of cage competition
for the season.
Coach Husky Hunt will rely tonight
upon a squad containing a well-rounded,
versatile set of players. In reserve, to
mention a few, are Christ, Biaggini,
Lewis, Dobson, Price, and Crary. Coach
Price likewise has his set of reserves
