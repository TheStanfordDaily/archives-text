# WATER POLO TEAM TO MEET CALIFORNIA TONIGHT IN OAKLAND
## 
### 
Stanford will face California in an
other championship contest tonight, when
the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold
swimmers meet in the Athens Club pool
in a water polo match.
Under the coaching of Ernst Brand
sten, Captain Bob Williams is leading
the Stanford men into the game with
every player at the peak of condition.
The last scrimmage was held yesterday
afternoon. Brandsten said that he had no
fears of staleness or over-training.
Retaining the same starting lineup, O'-
Connor, Van den Akker, and Christen
son will begin at forward, Williams,
Ward, and Maltby at guard, and Poulson
at goal-keep. On hand for substitutions
will be Strong, Thurlow, Burns, and
H inkle.
Preceding the varsity game, the fresh
man squads will clash at 6 o'clock.
Brandsten is starting nearly the same
men who have been scrimmaging against
the varsity, using Harrison, Driggs, and
Kinkead as forwards, Captain Hobdy,
Pahl, and Peters as guards, and Gersten
kom ds goal-keep. Kinkead is replacing
McCurdy, who has been out of practice
for a few days because of a touch of
influenza.
