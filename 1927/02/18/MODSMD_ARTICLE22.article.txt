# Title at Stake

Two basketball teams are shooting at the same basket tonight in the
Oakland Auditorium—that basket which is labeled championship of the
southern division of the Pacific Coast Conference. Stanford and Cali
fornia have each defeated the only other conference quintet—the Univer
sity of Southern California—three times this season, and tonight the
Cards and Bears are out to settle the question of supremacy.
As has been the case for the last six years, Stanford enters the match
already proclaimed the loser by basketball dopesters. And to add to this,
Stanford is further handicapped, both spiritually and materially, by the
loss of its captain, who will not be on the floor because of sickness. But
on the other side of this balance sheet, Stanford has an experienced team,
a new coach, a fighting spirit, and has only lost to three teams in pre
liminary contests.
The Daily Califomian even condescends to give the Redshirts a chance
to upset the dope. In one editorial it says,"A mediocre team at the be
ginning of the season, Stanford now looms as a menacing opponent."
And then again, "The unexpected revival of the Stanford basketball
machine over the week-end has injected new interest in the race for court
honors in the southern division of the conference basketball sections.
Formerly regarded as a weak team, the Cardinal machine has shown a
complete reversal of performance and the remaining contests which will
determine the southern titular representative should prove excellent ex
hibition of court generalship." Such remarks coming from California are
appreciated.
Oliver \\ endell Holmes's description of a sporting man might well be
inserted here: "lo brag little, to show well, to crow gently, if in luck, to
pay up, to own up, and to shut up, if beaten are the virtues of a sporting
man." This quotation should be the commandment of the spectators at
the basketball game in Oakland. It is hard to lose a contest and not to
alibi, but it is equally as difficult to win a match and not to crow.
The game tonight is nothing but an athletic match. It is not a war or
a feud. And the referee is an arbitrator not agitator, he is right at all
times. N
For those who cannot attend the main event at Oakland, there will be
the opportunity of witnessing the Stanford-California freshman basket
ball game, in the basketball pavilion. Although the Bear Cubs defeated
the Mitchell s yearlings last week-end, the Stanford freshmen are enter
ing tomorrow's game with determination, and with the taste of defeat still
in their mouths. Often the sideshows are as good as the main tent.

appreciated.
Oliver \\ endell Holmes's description of a sporting man might well be
inserted here: "lo brag little, to show well, to crow gently, if in luck, to
pay up, to own up, and to shut up, if beaten are the virtues of a sporting
man." This quotation should be the commandment of the spectators at
the basketball game in Oakland. It is hard to lose a contest and not to
alibi, but it is equally as difficult to win a match and not to crow.
The game tonight is nothing but an athletic match. It is not a war or
a feud. And the referee is an arbitrator not agitator, he is right at all
times. N
For those who cannot attend the main event at Oakland, there will be
the opportunity of witnessing the Stanford-California freshman basket
ball game, in the basketball pavilion. Although the Bear Cubs defeated
the Mitchell s yearlings last week-end, the Stanford freshmen are enter
ing tomorrow's game with determination, and with the taste of defeat still
in their mouths. Often the sideshows are as good as the main tent.
Two basketball teams are shooting at the same basket tonight in the
Oakland Auditorium—that basket which is labeled championship of the
southern division of the Pacific Coast Conference. Stanford and Cali
fornia have each defeated the only other conference quintet—the Univer
sity of Southern California—three times this season, and tonight the
Cards and Bears are out to settle the question of supremacy.
As has been the case for the last six years, Stanford enters the match
already proclaimed the loser by basketball dopesters. And to add to this,
Stanford is further handicapped, both spiritually and materially, by the
loss of its captain, who will not be on the floor because of sickness. But
on the other side of this balance sheet, Stanford has an experienced team,
a new coach, a fighting spirit, and has only lost to three teams in pre
liminary contests.
The Daily Califomian even condescends to give the Redshirts a chance
to upset the dope. In one editorial it says,"A mediocre team at the be
ginning of the season, Stanford now looms as a menacing opponent."
And then again, "The unexpected revival of the Stanford basketball
machine over the week-end has injected new interest in the race for court
honors in the southern division of the conference basketball sections.
Formerly regarded as a weak team, the Cardinal machine has shown a
complete reversal of performance and the remaining contests which will
determine the southern titular representative should prove excellent ex
hibition of court generalship." Such remarks coming from California are
appreciated.
