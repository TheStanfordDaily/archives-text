'After having wandered over the campus at various times in
vain efforts to find certain streets, I have decided to take this op
portunity to suggest that some public-spirited organization take
it upon itself to place big secure signs, the kind that Encina resi
dents can't remove, at all intersections on the Stanford Campus.
Being a mere freshman I have not learned the combination of the
street system here."
The freshman's prayers have been answered, hardly two months after
he made them. Today the various street and alleys are marked as defi
nitely as Market Street. Never again shall freshmen become lost on the
Stanford campus.
