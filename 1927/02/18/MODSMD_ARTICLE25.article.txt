Another interesting review of the great social problem in American
universities is given by the house-mother of the Sigma Chi fraternity at
the University of Kansas on her return from an Eastern visit:
"In contrast to the 44 fraternities, there is one national sorority at Penn
State. And Mrs. Stover noticed that co-eds are not generally popular. In the
East, where women's colleges are prevalent, the men seem to take offense
at the women entering their realm. They prefer to import the home-town
girl for every important event where feminine presence is desired."
