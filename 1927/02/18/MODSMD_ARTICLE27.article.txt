# ANOTHER ANGLE ON ACADEMIC REFORM
## 
### 
Remember how Stanford started- Ed
ucation was family style, and exams
were given to see if the profs were earn
ing their pay. Thirty years ago Stanford
tried out tomorrow's ideas in education.
The experiment couldn't last, of course.
Fortunately enough of the pioneering
spirit still lives that the administration is
justly ranked among the most liberal.
Now regiments oi high school vale
dictorians threaten to reduce Stanford to
the mental level of a state university.
The professors arc only human. Many
stand out manfully against the great
American demand for any kind of bunk
so Icing as it is sufficiently standardized.
The rare student who pauses a moment
after class to adroitly tell the prof what
pabulum his lectures are will still get
the boot less often than a bid to lunch.
Perhaps a majority of the instructors
are sick unto death of the listless sponges
who squat in their classrooms. But no
one teacher or even institution can buck
the system. If the students long enough
continue to regard the grades they get
as meaning anything more than marks
on paper, the professors will take the

same attitude. Stanford will be no bet
tor than nine hundred-odd other educa
tion mills in the United States who pass
out A.B.'s and Ph.D.'s without even a
knowing smile.
When the consciousness of being a
separate intelligence strikes the hitherto
unsuspecting one student in twenty, he is
likely to do peculiar things. Some cut
all their classes and get gloriously drunk
with a happy conscience. The less hedo
nistic propose to reform the curriculum,
and all over the country high minded
sophomores are martyring themselves
trying to do away with lecture courses
and such heirlooms with which the mass
of their fellows are comfortably satis
fied.
All Utopias aside, isn't the medicine
for the "mass production" evil a more
adult attitude on the part of the indi
vidual student? Parroting enough oi the
text to earn a C from the correctors is
all that is really required by the univer
sity and beyond that the sky is the limit
for individual effort. In the long run
real "creative thinking" won't generally
result so badly for the student's grades,
but what if it does in any instance? The
enlightened student will occasionally poke
up his profs to watch them wiggle, re
member that for the most part they are
doing the best they can with the stupid
herd, and take for himself the quantity
and kind of education he chooses. â€”D. G.
