# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I was surprised last night to find the
concrete impression that has apparently
been formed among our underclassmen
as a result of the recent derogatory criti
cisms of Stanford women, appearing in
the Daily. While the freshmen are wit
nessing various traditions tumbling down
all about them, I see little reason to cause
their respect for the girls to be toppled
down merely because some few soured
individuals have seen fit to express them
selves in a disparaging way. The danger
lies in these younger men accepting this
as part of the Stanford He-man Creed.
At the cost of numerous winks, nudges,
horse-laughs, and what-nots, I would like
to attempt a re-establishment of their re
gard for "our five-hundred"; I don't be
lieve the soured outlook is at all essential
in the present-day tendency of standardi
zation of outlooks on the campus. 1 sup
pose that the upper-class element of
sour-doughs ,are so thoroughly steeped
in their opinions that it is too late to hope
for any improvement—but the freshmen
will do the exhorting of the future, and
whether or not their attitude toward the
women students will be one of pseudo
sophistication and ridicule depends great
ly upon the formation of their attitude
now.
The freshmen, through force of cir
cumstance, learn much from hearsay—
particularly in this direction. Since first
hand information will no doubt, under
the present circumstances, continue to be
wanting until spring quarter at least—it
seems that an addition to the hearsay

evidence vtould help to stabilize their
viewpoints.
The charge that there are 110 attractive
women at Stanford is ridiculous, of
course. I suppose the sour-doughs have
based their statements upon the number
they have found unattractive. Since the
same thing is true, and more forcibly so,
of the men .... it would seem that such
a division be taken as a matter of course.
If Venus would be so terrifically lone
some here .... how about Adonis ?
Something unmentioned by the critics
of the girls is the fact that the feminine
element (aside from th<* physical attrac
tiveness argument) bring with them cer
tain qualities for which the men should
be completely grateful. For a few ex
amples : there is a lack of tawdriness
and overly-made-up girls 011 the campus;
the girls have or acquire an element of
good taste in their dress that is admi
rable; if there was a bit more chivalry
in the men. the last vestiges of an almost
extinct snobbery would disappear; and.
in view of recent tirades, I am sure they
are tolerant. In closing—they are blessed
in great degree with an element of good
breeding and sportsmanship—which, if it
had been more pronounced in the make
up of the male protagonists of their ridi
cule—would have obviated the need for
writing this letter.
In jiossible defense of the leaders of
the tirades, may I add the learned words
of Dr. Johnson: "If we require more
perfection from women than from our
selves, it is doing them honor."
Sincerely yours,
DELMKR L. DAVES, '26.

selves in a disparaging way. The danger
lies in these younger men accepting this
as part of the Stanford He-man Creed.
At the cost of numerous winks, nudges,
horse-laughs, and what-nots, I would like
to attempt a re-establishment of their re
gard for "our five-hundred"; I don't be
lieve the soured outlook is at all essential
in the present-day tendency of standardi
zation of outlooks on the campus. 1 sup
pose that the upper-class element of
sour-doughs ,are so thoroughly steeped
in their opinions that it is too late to hope
for any improvement—but the freshmen
will do the exhorting of the future, and
whether or not their attitude toward the
women students will be one of pseudo
sophistication and ridicule depends great
ly upon the formation of their attitude
now.
The freshmen, through force of cir
cumstance, learn much from hearsay—
particularly in this direction. Since first
hand information will no doubt, under
the present circumstances, continue to be
wanting until spring quarter at least—it
seems that an addition to the hearsay

evidence vtould help to stabilize their
viewpoints.
The charge that there are 110 attractive
women at Stanford is ridiculous, of
course. I suppose the sour-doughs have
based their statements upon the number
they have found unattractive. Since the
same thing is true, and more forcibly so,
of the men .... it would seem that such
a division be taken as a matter of course.
If Venus would be so terrifically lone
some here .... how about Adonis ?
Something unmentioned by the critics
of the girls is the fact that the feminine
element (aside from th<* physical attrac
tiveness argument) bring with them cer
tain qualities for which the men should
be completely grateful. For a few ex
amples : there is a lack of tawdriness
and overly-made-up girls 011 the campus;
the girls have or acquire an element of
good taste in their dress that is admi
rable; if there was a bit more chivalry
in the men. the last vestiges of an almost
extinct snobbery would disappear; and.
in view of recent tirades, I am sure they
are tolerant. In closing—they are blessed
in great degree with an element of good
breeding and sportsmanship—which, if it
had been more pronounced in the make
up of the male protagonists of their ridi
cule—would have obviated the need for
writing this letter.
In jiossible defense of the leaders of
the tirades, may I add the learned words
of Dr. Johnson: "If we require more
perfection from women than from our
selves, it is doing them honor."
Sincerely yours,

The Editor, Sir:
I was surprised last night to find the
concrete impression that has apparently
been formed among our underclassmen
as a result of the recent derogatory criti
cisms of Stanford women, appearing in
the Daily. While the freshmen are wit
nessing various traditions tumbling down
all about them, I see little reason to cause
their respect for the girls to be toppled
down merely because some few soured
individuals have seen fit to express them
selves in a disparaging way. The danger
lies in these younger men accepting this
as part of the Stanford He-man Creed.
