PLATO'S AMERICAN REPUBLIC,
by Douglas Woodruff. E. P. Dutton
& Co.
Douglas Woodruff, the author, it would
be well to know, was an Oxford debater
touring the country in order to meet the
long-haired forensic artists who repre
sent our universities in debate and are
usually tolerated but laughed at on the
campus. The collegiate world knew Mr.
Woodruff to be a debater and therefore
surmised that he was probably a queer
but harmless fellow. The hosts thought
he was properly impressed, but they will
110 doubt squirm at the return he has
made to their hospitality.
The old Greek Socrates, according to
Mr. Woodruff's fantasy, made a lecture
tour of this country, and his antiquated
philosophy just did not get over with
our up-and-coming business men. On
his return to the friendlier environment
of Athens, Socrates gives to the group
of curious students his reflections 011
American character. The philosopher
grows contemptuous over the American
belief that he can disprove anything by

an amendment to the Constitution. He
seems shocked that we do not respect all
our laws, and alleges that the clamor
for new laws increases in proportion to
the inefficiency with which the existing
laws are enforced. He finally suggests,
satirically, that only when the Americans
find that they are observing all, or in
some part at least, of the laws they
have, should they permit themselves the
luxury of a new law.
Socrates sees no hope for American
men: they cannot be educated. Let them
spend all their time, he says, at football
games, where they like to lx>; that is the
best possible training for citizenship—
which consists principally in shouting a
chorus of praise, or blame, at the com
mand of leaders, about things you do
not understand.
The women constitute the only hope
for America, he thinks. As Athcn's
glory was founded on the leisure class,
supported by the slavery of the many,
so America may base its civilization on
the women, who have subtly and com
pletely enslaved the men by flattering

them into believing that they alone could
do the great work of the world. The
sage adds cynically that American women
think they know something, while in
fact they know nothing—hut that the
men are not even aware that there is
anything to know.
Douglas Woodruff is undoubtedly
clever, and his wit and originality will be
enjoyed by anyone who does not object
to laughter simply on the ground that it
is flippant.

pletely enslaved the men by flattering

them into believing that they alone could
do the great work of the world. The
sage adds cynically that American women
think they know something, while in
fact they know nothing—hut that the
men are not even aware that there is
anything to know.
Douglas Woodruff is undoubtedly
clever, and his wit and originality will be
enjoyed by anyone who does not object
to laughter simply on the ground that it
is flippant.

PLATO'S AMERICAN REPUBLIC,
by Douglas Woodruff. E. P. Dutton
& Co.
Douglas Woodruff, the author, it would
be well to know, was an Oxford debater
touring the country in order to meet the
long-haired forensic artists who repre
sent our universities in debate and are
usually tolerated but laughed at on the
campus. The collegiate world knew Mr.
Woodruff to be a debater and therefore
surmised that he was probably a queer
but harmless fellow. The hosts thought
he was properly impressed, but they will
110 doubt squirm at the return he has
made to their hospitality.
The old Greek Socrates, according to
Mr. Woodruff's fantasy, made a lecture
tour of this country, and his antiquated
philosophy just did not get over with
our up-and-coming business men. On
his return to the friendlier environment
of Athens, Socrates gives to the group
of curious students his reflections 011
American character. The philosopher
grows contemptuous over the American
belief that he can disprove anything by

an amendment to the Constitution. He
seems shocked that we do not respect all
our laws, and alleges that the clamor
for new laws increases in proportion to
the inefficiency with which the existing
laws are enforced. He finally suggests,
satirically, that only when the Americans
find that they are observing all, or in
some part at least, of the laws they
have, should they permit themselves the
luxury of a new law.
Socrates sees no hope for American
men: they cannot be educated. Let them
spend all their time, he says, at football
games, where they like to lx>; that is the
best possible training for citizenship—
which consists principally in shouting a
chorus of praise, or blame, at the com
mand of leaders, about things you do
not understand.
The women constitute the only hope
for America, he thinks. As Athcn's
glory was founded on the leisure class,
supported by the slavery of the many,
so America may base its civilization on
the women, who have subtly and com
pletely enslaved the men by flattering

them into believing that they alone could
do the great work of the world. The
sage adds cynically that American women
think they know something, while in
fact they know nothing—hut that the
men are not even aware that there is
anything to know.
