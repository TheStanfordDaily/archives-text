# CABBAGES and THINGS

### 
In the drawing affixed above, Mr.
Eazzel, our staff artist, lias given you
his conception of what a Stanford
woman looks like when she is SMOK
ing. He did not have time to draw her
as she was before, but you can just
imagine how GOOD and SWEET she
was before she started using TO
BACCO.
This poor girl (see drawing) thinks
she has been having a GOOD TIME,
but she has been CHEATING herself.
Now she is well on her way to DE
STRUCTION. For (he doubtful pleas
ure of being thought of as SOPHISTI
CATED, she has lost the BLOOM OF
YOUTH which adorned her cheeks,
and substituted the PALLOR nicotine
induces.
But there is a ray of hope STILL.
This sort of thing has only gone on
for about two weeks.
Girls, STOP before it is TOO LATE:!
—F.T.M.

Found: The Not Impossible She
The following poetic invitation ap
peared in the student newspaper of
Mills College, allegedly inspired by a
jingle printed some time ago in Cab
bages:
The Passing of Stanford
'Tis said by some who ought to know,
That men will wander to and fro,
High over mountains, deep under sea,
For jewels of precious quality.
| (Of the Feminine Gender.)
I Meager resources present at home
'Cause men, they say, to presently roam
i To climes where beauty and brains
are best
And a man has a chance to swell out
his chest.
(And play the Generous Spender.)
On the Farm rejoicing is heard today.
For a bridge has been built across

the bay,
I By driving an hour at the pace that
| kills,
| The boys can reach beaut y and brains
at Mills.
! (At the risk of a Battered Fender.)
* * *
Somebody must have misunderstood.
i Whoever said that Stanford men
! WANTED brains?
* * *
DON'T GO TO MILLS, BOYS—You
j may get a battered fender.

Since somebody has mentioned Me
j morial Chapel, may we notice that,
the dazed-looking lady with the stein
and "Here's how" expression is labeled
| FAITH?
