# MICRO-PALEONTOLOGY LABORATORY SECURES FORAMANIFERA CASE
## Stanford Laboratory Now Has Distinctive Place In University 
### Calvin Wood 
With the addition of a well-cata
logued case of Foramlnifera, number
ing over a thousand specimens in the
collection, and the addition of extra
rooms and better equipment, the
Stanford micro-paleontology labora
tory is taking its place among the dis
tinctive assets of the University.
The laboratory is the only one of its
kind in the universities of the Pacific
Toast. It was established in 1924 by
Dr. Hubert G. Schenck, and under his
guidance has been gradually (level
oped. Micropaleontology is a special
branch of paleontology of value in the
location of oil deposits. Columbia Uni
versity is the only other university
in the United States that gives formal
work in micropaleontology.
Cushman Donates
Dr. Joseph A. Cushman, the fore
most authority in the world on Fora
minifera, has donated many speci
mens to the Stanford collection. Dr.
G. Dallas Hanna, curator of the Cali
fornia Academy of Sciences, Dr. I. M.
van Vlerk of Java, and Dr. Clinton R.
Stauffer of the University of Minne
sota, are among those to donate speci
mens to these infinitesemally small
sea-shells to the laboratory.
Foraminifera to the naked eye looks
like finest sand; under the microscope
they take the form of various beauti
fully-shaped sea-shells. Other minute
fossils are also contained in the col
lection.
The students, working in this de
partment, publish a bulletin three
times a year. It is edited by H. R. Gale,
graduate student in geology, and is
managed by Wayne Smith. In the last
issue there appeared articles by Dr.
Hanna, by M. M. Kornfeld, and by H.
R. Gale.
