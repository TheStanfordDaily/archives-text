# PRINCESS IDA TYPIFIES CAMPUS REVIVAL OF OLD GILBERT AND SULLIVAN OPERAS
## Mass of Legends, Anecdotes Surrounding Compositions of Of Famous Authors Adds to Popular Appeal 
### Anne Waldron 
The present revival of popularity in
New York of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas has spread to the Stanford
campus where "Princess Ida" will be
presented February 25 with a large
campus cast under the direction of
! Warren D. Allen and-Gordon Davis.
Although the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas can well stand on their own
feet, the mass of legend and anecdote
that has grown up about the co
authors has greatly added to their
popular appeal.
Both were well-known before their
meeting in 1870, Gilbert as the writer
of short plays and skits, and Sullivan
for his incidental music to "The Tem
pest" and other classic dramas. Their
best work, however, was all done in
collaboration.
Seldom Together
During their most prolific period
they were very seldom together be
fore actual rehearsal. Gilbert wrote
the dialogue and lyrics, usually an act
at a time, and sent the act to Sullivan,
who wrote the music and returned
the manuscript for revision.
Sullivan never wro'te more than the
vocal accompaniment to his songs. He
came strolling into rehearsals with a
bulk of new music under his arm and
played it over on the piano until the
orchestra-leader could develop the
orchestration. 1-Ie insisted that all his

music be sung exactly as it was writ
ten without the change in quantity of
a single halt-note. One story is told
of him in which an actor varied the
quantity of several notes in a new
song. Sullivan heard him out, then
said: "Nice piece of composition, sir,
but suppose we sing my song now."
The choruses and finales were always
learned first; then the quartets and
trios, with the duets and solos last.
Gilbert Director
Gilbert, in addition to writing the
libretto, did much of the stage direc
tion. lie had a model stage with three
inch wooden pegs to represent men
and two-and-a-half-inch pegs for wo
men. Those representing the chief
characters were painted a different
color from the chorus. He arranged
these pegs on his model until at re
hearsal he knew where each actor was
to stand during every scene.
He allowed the actors very little
interpretation of their parts, and
would stand beside them, making them
repeat their lines with the appropriate
gestures until he was satisfied with
their rendition.
Due largely to a natural over-growth
of artistic temperament, Gilbert and
Sullivan had a violent quarrel in their
later years. Although this was after
wards patched up, their collaborations
thereafter were never as successful.

characters were painted a different
color from the chorus. He arranged
these pegs on his model until at re
hearsal he knew where each actor was
to stand during every scene.
He allowed the actors very little
interpretation of their parts, and
would stand beside them, making them
repeat their lines with the appropriate
gestures until he was satisfied with
their rendition.
Due largely to a natural over-growth
of artistic temperament, Gilbert and
Sullivan had a violent quarrel in their
later years. Although this was after
wards patched up, their collaborations
thereafter were never as successful.
The present revival of popularity in
New York of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas has spread to the Stanford
campus where "Princess Ida" will be
presented February 25 with a large
campus cast under the direction of
! Warren D. Allen and-Gordon Davis.
Although the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas can well stand on their own
feet, the mass of legend and anecdote
that has grown up about the co
authors has greatly added to their
popular appeal.
Both were well-known before their
meeting in 1870, Gilbert as the writer
of short plays and skits, and Sullivan
for his incidental music to "The Tem
pest" and other classic dramas. Their
best work, however, was all done in
collaboration.
Seldom Together
During their most prolific period
they were very seldom together be
fore actual rehearsal. Gilbert wrote
the dialogue and lyrics, usually an act
at a time, and sent the act to Sullivan,
who wrote the music and returned
the manuscript for revision.
Sullivan never wro'te more than the
vocal accompaniment to his songs. He
came strolling into rehearsals with a
bulk of new music under his arm and
played it over on the piano until the
orchestra-leader could develop the
orchestration. 1-Ie insisted that all his

music be sung exactly as it was writ
ten without the change in quantity of
a single halt-note. One story is told
of him in which an actor varied the
quantity of several notes in a new
song. Sullivan heard him out, then
said: "Nice piece of composition, sir,
but suppose we sing my song now."
The choruses and finales were always
learned first; then the quartets and
trios, with the duets and solos last.
