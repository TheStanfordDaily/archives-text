### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Jack Delaney, light-heavyweight cham
pion of the world, faces 110 set-up to
night when he meets the strong, aggres
sive Boston heavyweight, Jim Maloney.
Jack Delaney has shown the world of
fistiana that he is growing bigger, strong
er, and better right along, and though
Maloney is touted by many as being the
coming heavyweight champion of the
world, this flashing - eyed, handsome
French-Canadian should beat him and go
011 to further ring glory.
Hand it to Ovila Chapdelaine for many
reasons—for his good looks and knightly
bearing, his courage, his boxing ability,
his jknock-out wallop, and also for NOT
going into the movies after he won a
title, and thus spoiling his chances of
taking 011 weight and improving his gen
eral physical condition. And Jack is one
of the few heavyweights who has the
looks and the ability to be a movie star,
too, yet he had the good sense to go up
into the woods he loves so well and live

the healthiest kind of an outdoor life.
Delaney, you know, is a sharp-shooter
in more ways than one. He has a regular
arsenal of guns at his home, and the keen
est of eyes and the steadiest of hands to
direct their fire. Then, too, on the bowl
ing alleys he can shoot a ball as straight
as a die. In the ring, his famous "half
right uppercut" has broken so many pugi
listic bubbles that it isn't hard to imagine
him shooting over a haymaker with it
on the sturdy chin of the "Boston Strong
Boy," Jim Maloney.
After seeing Jack knock heavyweight
Bud Gorman kicking, I am ready for any
thing and am quite willing to align my
self with those who pick Jack Delaney as
the next heavyweight champion of the
world. Gene Tunney is good to look at
in the ring, but Jack Delaney is a work
of art, too, and at the same time a better
boxer and a harder hitter than Tunney.
Now let's hope both parties in this
Maloney-Delaney affair don't decide to
wait for die other to start something.
