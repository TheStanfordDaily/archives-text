# TWO TYPES OF GRID COACHES CALL DOWN CRITICISM ON GAME
## Fullerton Condemns Stress On Victory, Stirring Players' Emotions

"For winning football games, 'Pop'
Warner of Stanford deserves the hon
ors," says Hugh Fullerton in his
article in this week's number of the I
Liberty Magazine. "The majority of
football coaches concede him the;
leadership as an inventor and per
fector of plays. In thirty-two years of |
coaching he has won eighty-five per
ccnt of all the games his teams have
played. Eight of his elevens have gone I
unbeaten through entire seasons."
Fullerton explains that there are !
two kinds of football coaches whose
methods call down violent criticism,!
not only on themselves, but upon the
game. These are the "Rough-Toss" j
boys, who concern themselves less j
with the morals and manners of their .
players than with winning games; and
the inspirational coaches, who depend
for success upon stirring the emotions
of their players. "The latter are the !
more dangerous."
All authorities agree on the superi-1
ority of Warner's inventiveness. The
plays he worked out with the Carlisle .
Indians, back in the 90's, are still 1
standard. The reverse play, now so j
common, was his. Warner was the i
first to use the formation with one of
the backs flanking the tackle. He was j
one of the first to use the direct pass
to the ball carrier, and he invented
the idea of starting the backs from a
crouch.
"Warner is effective," Fullerton 1
points out. "He is big, slow-spoken, I
except in crises, when he can bark \
orders as sharply as anyone. He talks j
to boys quietly, saying little as a usual
thing. He is a strict disciplinarianâ€”
just, slow to judge, and quick to act,
once he decides. They call him 'Pop'
and respect him."
