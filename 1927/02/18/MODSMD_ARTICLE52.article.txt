# FRATERNITY POLITICS RUIN ATHLETIC TEAMS IS OPINION OF COACH
## 
### 
"Cheap, trashy fraternity politics
have ruined more athletic teams than
all the gamblers and over-enthusiastic
silumni twice over," vehemently as
serts "Cap" Maynor, former Big Ten
and Missouri Valley coach, in a pub
lished tirade on Greek orders and col
lege athletics. He is backed up by
Nelse Norgen, former coach at Utah
University, who stated that fraternity
meddlesomeness was the only obsta
cle he encountered while at Salt Lake.
In elaborating on his statement
Maynor says that it is natural that
star athletes should be sought after by
nil fraternities. But kicking, complain
ing, and laying down on the job be
cause some fraternity brother is on
the bench is the policy of many of the
fraternities.
He also states that one fraternity
in a Rocky Mountain conference
school has openly boasted of getting
rid of two coaches and expect to get
rid of a third.
Maynor declares that this is not
true of all fraternities for some of
them dismiss athletes who persist in
breaking training.
He attributed the athletic success
of Notre Dame, Army, and Navy, to
the fact that these schools do not
tolerate fraternities.
