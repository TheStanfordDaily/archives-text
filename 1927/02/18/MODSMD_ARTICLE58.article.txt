# FRATERNITY AT DRAKE INVENTS NEW DANCE
## 
### 
Drake University traditions were
given a jolt when a fraternity gave
a "Four O'clock Breakfast Dance,"
which was attended by more than
200 university students and chape
roned by several faculty members, in
cluding the Dean of Men.
The dance presented a new way of
evading present date rules which set
the hour when a dance must close but
do not designate when it may start.
