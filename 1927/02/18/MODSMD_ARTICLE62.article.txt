# MATERIAL ON KITCHNER MYSTERY NOW ON DISPLAY
## 
### Margaret Cummings 
No matter how extensive the inves
tigations into tne circumstances sur- i
rounding the death of Lord Kitchener,
an element of mystery will always j
cling to the fate of hsi ship, the Hamp- j
shire, whose loss along the west coast
of the Orkneys on the evening of June i
G, IJUG, deprived England of her great-1
est naval leader. Many highly colored !
theories have been advanced and re- 1
jected, and the available facts have
been variously construed; meanwhile'
the sinking of the Hampshire remains j
a genuine and serious historical prob- !
lem.
Through the kindness of the British !
Admiralty the Hoover War Library is
in possession of as much material on
the subject as is available. The Secret j
Mine Charts issued by the British
government before and after the dis-1
aster of the Hampshire in which mine I
areas are indicated, a similar German !
map, and versions of the affair in the j
books written by those in authority j
are included in the present display at |
the Library.
Many Angles of Approach
Although the facts of the case seem |
simple enough, there are several
angles from which to approach it. On i
the afternoon of June 5, 1916, Earl j
Kitchener left Scapa Flow on the 1
cruiser Hampshire on his way to Rus- j
sia where he expected to assist in the '
organization of military operations
there. Two hours after sailing they '
struck a mine, and Kitchener went
down with the ship. There was some
delay in getting the message to Eng
land, and it was midnight before the
loss of the Hampshire was officially
confirmed. In connection with this, the I
seemingly curious circumstance of i
Berlin's publishing the news of
Kitchener's death before any other j
country knew of of it later lent color
I
to the rumor that treason and espion
age were responsible for the disaster, j
This is explained by the fact that the j
British authorities ordered the sup- >
pression of the news from the press \
after a statement had already gone
over the cables to the continent.
Wrong Route Taken?
Lord Jellieoe, the British Comman- J
der by whose order the Hampshire
took the west rather than the east
coast of the Orkneys has been the ob
ject of not a little criticism. If he were
guided by the Secret Mine Chart of
May 28, which did not indicate this
area as dangerous, although it had
been planted in mines some seventeen
days before, the western route would
have been the logical course; since !
a wind was blowing from the north,
and there was greater danger from
drifting' mines along the east coast,
although this area was free from
mines until the following year.
The cause for question here is the 1
fact that only three days before the 1
Hampshire "went down, the drifter
Laurel Crown was sunk in these same
waters by a German mine. The Mine
Chart of June 11 did not indicate the
loss of either the Laurel Crown or the ;
Hampshire. While an expert on mili
tary intelligence has suggested that
the very importance of the sinking of j
the Hampshire might have been suffi- i
i
cient reason to prevent its being re- j
corded, the failure to check the Laurel
Crown assumes an even more mysteri
ous aspect, especially since the loss of
a vessel in this territory is indicated

on the ma pof June 22 in the custom
ary fashion.
Any suggestion that the catastrophe
was the direct result of plotting on
the part of authorities unfriendly to
Kitchener has long since been dis
credited, but the enigma still remains.
V. W. Germain's "The Truth About
Kitchener" reproduces a letter from
General Ludendorff in which he says
that Kitchener's death was due, not
to any German mine, but to his "own
abilities," and the machinations of
those higher up who wanted the de
struction of the Czarist Russia. Tn an
other account, "The Tragedy of Kitch
i ener," Lord Esher points out the
falsity of the idea that the wrong
route was taken, or that anything was
not done to avert the tragedy that
; might have been done. More than this,
history in all probability will never
jbe able to tell us, and around the
| name of Kitchener a glamor of half
mystery will remain.
