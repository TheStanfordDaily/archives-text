# STANFORD WOMEN TO TOUR EUROPE DURING MONTHS OF SUMMER
## 
### 
Olivia Boezinger. secretary to the
Dean of Women, will conduct a party
of thirteen Stanford women through
J Central Europe during the three sum
mer months. This excursion, as well
as fifteen similar ones composed of
; more than two hundred American uni
versity students, is being organized
by the International Student Hospi
tality Association.
Differing from other tours of this
kind those arranged by the Interna-
I tioual Student Hospitality Association
j include entertainment in private
homes in each country covered in the
j trip. Direct contact with life of the
j country rather than a superficial
, glance at the high spots is the aim
jof the Association.
Stanford is planning to send a men's
j and a women's group, each number
. thirteen. Plans for the men's group
have not as yet been made definite,
| but Miss Boezinger has the women's
; arrangement well under way.
J Information on the subject may be
obtained from the Dean of Women's
i Office.
