# ACTIVITIES, STUDIES SHOULD CO-ORDINATE DECLARES DEAN YOST
## Two Fields of College Life May Be Supplementary To Help Student 
### 
"The day when curricular work in col
leges was considered irreconcilably sep
arate and distinct from student activities
with the implication (often too well
founded) that students are active only
outside the classroom is fast receding into
the limbo of forgotten things," said Dean
Mary Yost in an interview article in
the Christian Science Monitor recently.
Miss Yost points out in her article
that curriculum making is now claiming
tlie interest and serious thought of col
lege students, thus becoming in itself a
"student activity." The fact that the
3000 college students at the second annual
congress of the National Students' Fed
eration of America at its meeting in De
cember at the University of Michigan
devoted an entire session to the problem
of curriculum making bears out her point.
In a number of universities the stu
dents already have committees on cur
riculum making. "And since the students
are taking such an interest in the prob
lems of the faculty," says Miss Yost,
"the faculty must work on the student
problems, and this will really make us
co-workers, which, it seems to me, stu
dents and faculty ought to be."
It is not as if the faculty have not
been interested in the student activities
in the past. They have often been too
much interested, Miss Yost says, but the
interest lias been in trying to censor and
check student initiative. With the new
point of view for which she hopes, the
faculty will cease trying arbitrarily to
control student activities and will work
toward connecting these activities with
the academic side in such a way that the
additional value of activities will be
more definitely realized. This connection
will help students to formulate intelli
gently their own inner convictions, which,
after all, are the only real guides to their
actions.
Examples Given
There are numerous examples of this
kind of co-operation which are already
operating successfully. College news
papers are used as laboratories for the
journalism students and school cafe
terias are run by domestic science classes.
It has been shown that curricular and
extra-curricular activities need not be
antagonistic and Miss Yost believes that
they should be supplementary—that they
should enrich and vivify one another.
The already noticeable tendency to
ward co-operation of the two can go
much farther, she says, so as to take
place between practically all student en
terprises and the corresponding academic
study. For instance, the experiment in
student body government in universities
would have a much deeper significance if
it were taken seriously as a laboratory
problem lasting over an indefinite period
in place of looking ahead not more than
■four years of one college generation as
it does now.
Such an experiment would use the de
partments of economics and political
science as laboratories for working out
the most useful and efficient form of
government.
College students sometimes facetiously
remark, "The trouble with Bill is that he
is letting his studies interfere with his
education!" It is in the vision of Stan
ford's dean of women to reconcile
"studies" and "education" or curricular
and extra-curricular activity so that one
will round out the other instead of inter
fering with it.
She believes that the classes in English
and play writing can be more closely tied
up with the publications and the stage,
in the same way that the class in the
theater workshop at Stanford now com
bines theory with the practical work of
arranging stage settings and putting on
plays; and that the engineering depart
ment can plan and oversee the execution
of campus projects after the manner in
which the stadium, one of Stanford's
most successful undertakings, was planned
by a Stanford professor of engineering.
The idea is, in a way, the extension of
the "project method" of the secondary
schools.
This close co-operation of the curricu
lum with practical activities will not come
.suddenly, she says, by means of presiden
tial fiat, or a sudden change in policy of
the board of trustees, but is even now in
process of gradual evolution. Tendencies
toward it are noticeable in various col
leges. "There is a very definite move
ment," declares Miss Yost, "toward a
close co-operation of the curriculum and
student activities which will make the
university a laboratory for experiments
in better living."
"The day when curricular work in col
leges was considered irreconcilably sep
arate and distinct from student activities

the most useful and efficient form of
government.
College students sometimes facetiously
remark, "The trouble with Bill is that he
is letting his studies interfere with his
education!" It is in the vision of Stan
ford's dean of women to reconcile
"studies" and "education" or curricular
and extra-curricular activity so that one
will round out the other instead of inter
fering with it.
She believes that the classes in English
and play writing can be more closely tied
up with the publications and the stage,
in the same way that the class in the
theater workshop at Stanford now com
bines theory with the practical work of
arranging stage settings and putting on
plays; and that the engineering depart
ment can plan and oversee the execution
of campus projects after the manner in
which the stadium, one of Stanford's
most successful undertakings, was planned
by a Stanford professor of engineering.
The idea is, in a way, the extension of
the "project method" of the secondary
schools.
This close co-operation of the curricu
lum with practical activities will not come
.suddenly, she says, by means of presiden
tial fiat, or a sudden change in policy of
the board of trustees, but is even now in
process of gradual evolution. Tendencies
toward it are noticeable in various col
leges. "There is a very definite move
ment," declares Miss Yost, "toward a
close co-operation of the curriculum and
student activities which will make the
university a laboratory for experiments
in better living."
"The day when curricular work in col
leges was considered irreconcilably sep
arate and distinct from student activities
with the implication (often too well
founded) that students are active only
outside the classroom is fast receding into
the limbo of forgotten things," said Dean
Mary Yost in an interview article in
the Christian Science Monitor recently.
Miss Yost points out in her article
that curriculum making is now claiming
tlie interest and serious thought of col
lege students, thus becoming in itself a
"student activity." The fact that the
3000 college students at the second annual
congress of the National Students' Fed
eration of America at its meeting in De
cember at the University of Michigan
devoted an entire session to the problem
of curriculum making bears out her point.
In a number of universities the stu
dents already have committees on cur
riculum making. "And since the students
are taking such an interest in the prob
lems of the faculty," says Miss Yost,
"the faculty must work on the student
problems, and this will really make us
co-workers, which, it seems to me, stu
dents and faculty ought to be."
It is not as if the faculty have not
been interested in the student activities
in the past. They have often been too
much interested, Miss Yost says, but the
interest lias been in trying to censor and
check student initiative. With the new
point of view for which she hopes, the
faculty will cease trying arbitrarily to
control student activities and will work
toward connecting these activities with
the academic side in such a way that the
additional value of activities will be
more definitely realized. This connection
will help students to formulate intelli
gently their own inner convictions, which,
after all, are the only real guides to their
actions.
Examples Given
There are numerous examples of this
kind of co-operation which are already
operating successfully. College news
papers are used as laboratories for the
journalism students and school cafe
terias are run by domestic science classes.
It has been shown that curricular and
extra-curricular activities need not be
antagonistic and Miss Yost believes that
they should be supplementary—that they
should enrich and vivify one another.
The already noticeable tendency to
ward co-operation of the two can go
much farther, she says, so as to take
place between practically all student en
terprises and the corresponding academic
study. For instance, the experiment in
student body government in universities
would have a much deeper significance if
it were taken seriously as a laboratory
problem lasting over an indefinite period
in place of looking ahead not more than
■four years of one college generation as
it does now.
Such an experiment would use the de
partments of economics and political
science as laboratories for working out
the most useful and efficient form of
government.
