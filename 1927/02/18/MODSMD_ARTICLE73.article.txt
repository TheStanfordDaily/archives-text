# SEARSVILLE FLOW TURNED IN CAMPUS CREEK SAVES ROBLE
## Swimming Tests for Women And Men Will Begin On Monday 
### 
To save Robleites from the damp
and unfortunate predicament of the
sinpers in the historic deluge, flood
waters from Searsville running to
Lake Lagunita were turned into San
Francisquito Creek. Lagunita now has
only two feet to rise, and if predicted
storms break, there will be danger of 1
overflow.
A heavy winter twelve years ago
necessitated cutting the west banks
of the lake to prevent flood. Since this
emergency, precautions have been
taken to keep the water level low
until danger of severe storms is past.
Swimming Tests
Swimming tests for men and women
intending to canoe on Lagunita will
begin on Monday afternoon in the En
cina and Roble pools. Each swimmer
must cover 200 yards on the surface,
40 feet under water, dive in 10 feet
of water and bring a sack to the sur
face.
All students are required to take the
test whether they fullilled the require
ments last year or not. Dave Fall, in
charge of swimming and canoeing at
Lagunita, announced yesterday that
all individuals or organizations having
canoes in the boathouse must verify
the position of their canoes immedi
ately or they will lose their places.
Unless boat-owners pay their rent iu
advance, no berths will be reserved.
Canoes and row-boats are now lo
cated in the boathouse and may be
rented at a nominal sum. Students
may secure rowboats without passing
the swimming test, but canoes will i
only be rented to those who have ful
filled the swimming requirements.
