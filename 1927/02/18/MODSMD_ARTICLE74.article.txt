# Southern California Finds Sensational Mile Runner
## 
### 
Chesley Unruli, sophomore miler, is
the sensation of the University of
Southern California campus as a result
of Saturday's tryouts for the A.A.U.
relays here on the twenty-sixth.
Unruh, in trying out for the four
man, four-mile team provided the sur
prise of the tryouts when he ran away
from the field to win in 4:33. Heilman,
senior, and veteran miler, was badly
outstripped by the strong Unruh who
chugged off the four laps like a ma
chine, and finished with a burst of
reserve power.
Unruh is the lad who made himself
famous for his mile-running while at
El Monte high school in 1925. As a
prep he ran close to 4:22. But last
season, as a Trojan frosh, Unruh never
Kot under 4:35, and many of the track
fans were skeptical as to his future
career.
