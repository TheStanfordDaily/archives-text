# JOURNALISTIC CAREER TRACED BY EDITOR OF SAN JOSE NEWSPAPER
## 
### 
High lights of a long and varied career
in journalism were recalled last even
ing when Arthur L. Clark, editor of the
San Jose Mercury Herald, spoke in
formally to the members of the Stan
ford Journalist Club after a dinner held
at the Delta Clii house.
Beginning as a "cub" reporter on a
small-town paper, his calling afforded
him a wide and intimate experience in
the newspaper game as it is played here
and abroad. I lis reminiscences revealed
his contacts with all phases of newspaper
work.
For nineteen years a Hearst man, he
worked on the Journal and the American
in New York and on both Hearst's Chi
cago papers. His experience in promoting
a tabloid news on a shoestring, and
watching it grow to command the larg
est New York circulation of the present
time, was recounted along with learning
the knack of sports writing from Sandy
Barstow, the foremost man of his line
in the West.
Clark assumed his present position as
editor of the Mercury-Herald only last
year.
