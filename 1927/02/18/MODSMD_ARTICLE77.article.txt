## 
### 
A collection of government documents,
pamphlets, periodicals, and manuscripts
from the Latin-American countries has
recently been presented the Hoover War
Library by Professor P. A. Martin, of
the History department, who has just
returned to the campus from a sojourn
of over a year in Europe and the South
American countries. These documents,
which number over 300 volumes, were
collected principally from Ecuador, Haiti,
Uruguay, Brazil, and Nicaragua.
Professor Martin is a recognized au
thority 011 Latin-American political and
historical conditions. His prestige in
eastern countries enabled him to secure
full documents, not only for the actual
war period, but for the period of recon
struction following the war.
The recently acquired collection supple
ments the one secured for the Library
some years ago. These two collections in
clude legislative debates and documents
of the governmental ministries of all
important Latin-American republics from
1914 to the present time.
This material is peculiarly difficult to
acquire, since these countries have not
yet developed the custom of preserving
large numbers of such documents. Pro
fessor Martin's acquisitions, together
with the materials given the Library by
Professors G. H. Stuart, H. L. Lutz,
and Alfred Coester, comprise the finest
collection in this country for the study
of Latin America and the World War.
