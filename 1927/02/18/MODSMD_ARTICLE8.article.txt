# COACH GUS GERSON BRINGS RETINUE OF VETERAN RING MEN
## Miron. and Gomez, Team Captains, Expected to Furnish Feature Event 
### 
Gus Gerson, who in former years has
battled Stanford boxers while a student
at California and at the State Agricul
tural College in Davis, will again seek
ring honors at Stanford as the coach of
the Aggie varsity boxing squad which
arrives here at 1 o'clock this afternoon
for the Cardinal's first tournament with
off-campus contenders this year. Eight
bouts will be staged tonight, starting at
8 o'clock in the Basketball Pavilion.
The Cards and the Aggies have fought
011 practically an even basis in the last
four years, dividing honors evenly until
last year when the redshirts won both
tournaments. But this year both squads
boast an enviable retinue of ring men.
Stanford is ( fortified with veterans in
four of the seven classes, and the Farm
ers boast of a like number. 111 Captain
A1 Gomez, Gerson has one of the shiftiest
featherweights on the coast. For two
years he has taken the Far Western
tournament title by the shade of the refe
ree's decision in an extra-round bout
from Stanford's captain, Carlos Miron.
This scrap should be the feature bout of
the evening. The men will fight at 129
pounds.
Alex Ross, lightweight, competing for
the second year on the varsity, is slated
to face the second member of the Gomez
brothers in what should prove another
fast three rounds of milling.
Myron Schall, last year's Stanford var
sity boxing captain, carrying a clean rec
ord of collegiate bouts, not having been
defeated in three years, is pitted against
G. Garner of the Aggies, in the middle
weight class.
Norman Fain, also a second-year man
on the varsity who has yet to meet de
feat in the college ring, meets R. Crae
mer, one of the Farmer standbys. They
tight at 175 pounds.
To complete the card, Tom Traenor
tangles with G. Bath, also in the light
weight division; Newton Ridley enters
the ring against P. Williams at- -149
pounds; and Richard Dorman battles
with D. Mulkey. Lacking a veteran ban
tam, the Aggies have forfeited this bout
to Stanford.
Student Body cards will admit hold
ers, while outsiders will be charged tiie
regular price of fifty cents.
