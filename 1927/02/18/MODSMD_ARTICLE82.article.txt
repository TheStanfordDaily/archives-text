By Calvin Wood
Eventually every Stanford rough meets
Mose; it is inevitable. It may be once;
it may be frequently. An oversufficiency
of wardrobe or an insufficiency of funds
determines that. Nor is there any stimu
lus as potent as insolvency to bring about
a trip to Mose's. llis fame is widespread.
Roughs for years back have known him.
His recurrent visits to the campus are
perennial, and his business, we daresay,
plentiful.
"I treat students right," says Mose.
Heads for Mose's
Leaving his abode with last winter's
suit and two frayed sweaters over one
arm, and an old slicker and a pair of
shoes on the other, the Stanford rough
heads for Mose's. Jubilantly he strides
out visualizing that bridge debt lifted
from his shoulders, that dinner date to
be with the new girl friend, that har
rowing syllabus fee paid, and as an added
flourish to his delightful day dream, a
series of movies to be seen. He enters
the shop. Clothes adorn the front of
the place, serve as wall ornaments, and
till completely the small room.
"Hello, Mose," he greets the proprietor.
"Bring 'em right over here. Good
light here," returns the • business-like
Mose. He critically examines the cloth

| ing, and gazing at the wall an instant, i
blurts out, "Five dollars."
Buyer and Seller Bicker
"Five dollars I Man, man, look at that i
suit alone. Fifty dollars new at L. A.'s
I best store. It's worth fifteen as it is to !
I me." j
"Threadbare," answers the laconic
I Mose.
I "Threadbare my eye, all it needs is to
I be cleaned."
"Five dollars for the lot," repeats
Mose.
"Cast your eyes upon those keen sweat
ers. man. And how about those shoes?"
j "Five dollars," pronounces Mose with
I finality.
"I'll give you the whole bunch tor
I eight dollars."
j " Nix "
Heart Softens
''But I gotta have the money. Syllabus
j fees are due. I get a big fine for not
paying them. Only eight dollars, Mose."
"Oh, yuh need the money?"
•Yes."
"That's different. If you'd told me that
I first, it'd been another story. I always
; treat students right."
Whereupon buyer and seller feeling
] well pleased change wares for cash and
j the deal is closed.

Eventually every Stanford rough meets
Mose; it is inevitable. It may be once;
it may be frequently. An oversufficiency
of wardrobe or an insufficiency of funds
determines that. Nor is there any stimu
lus as potent as insolvency to bring about
a trip to Mose's. llis fame is widespread.
Roughs for years back have known him.
His recurrent visits to the campus are
perennial, and his business, we daresay,
plentiful.
"I treat students right," says Mose.
Heads for Mose's
Leaving his abode with last winter's
suit and two frayed sweaters over one
arm, and an old slicker and a pair of
shoes on the other, the Stanford rough
heads for Mose's. Jubilantly he strides
out visualizing that bridge debt lifted
from his shoulders, that dinner date to
be with the new girl friend, that har
rowing syllabus fee paid, and as an added
flourish to his delightful day dream, a
series of movies to be seen. He enters
the shop. Clothes adorn the front of
the place, serve as wall ornaments, and
till completely the small room.
"Hello, Mose," he greets the proprietor.
"Bring 'em right over here. Good
light here," returns the • business-like
Mose. He critically examines the cloth

| ing, and gazing at the wall an instant, i
blurts out, "Five dollars."

suit alone. Fifty dollars new at L. A.'s
I best store. It's worth fifteen as it is to !
I me." j
"Threadbare," answers the laconic
I Mose.
I "Threadbare my eye, all it needs is to
I be cleaned."
"Five dollars for the lot," repeats
Mose.
"Cast your eyes upon those keen sweat
ers. man. And how about those shoes?"
j "Five dollars," pronounces Mose with
I finality.
"I'll give you the whole bunch tor
I eight dollars."
