# Dayton to Honor Bryan's Battle Against Science
## 
### 
At Dayton, Tennessee, where Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan fought his last
fight against Godless Science, his
memory will be perpetuated by an in
stitution of higher learning. There
will be gathered for this college a
faculty pledged to keep their biology,
geology, and economics free of any
thing conflicting with the Bible. It
will be named Bryan University and
will open next fall. An endowment
campaign for $5,000,000 is now under
way.
