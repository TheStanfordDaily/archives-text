# DR. JORDAN BELIEVES UNITED STATES NOT TO WAR ON MEXICO
## 
### 
"There will be no war between the
United States and Mexico for some
time to come, and the affair in Nica
ragua at present will be settled with
little further trouble," said Dr. Jordan
at his Thursday Evening Conference
last night. This was the concluding
statement to his discussion of his ex
periences in Mexico.
Dr. Jordan's first trip to Mexico was
in 1895, for the purpose of collecting
specimens of fish. David Culver, a
senior at Stanford at the time, was
one of Dr. Jordan's assistants. Diaz,
then president, had made the country
fairly safe for travel by turning the
criminals of the country into mounted
police. Diaz power was supreme, rest
j ing largely upon personal popularity.
| Dr. Jordan said that every time Diaz
! visited a town, the town added his
name to its existing name.
The officials at El Paso, in order
to kill typhus germs that were being
brought into the United States at this
| time, put twenty immigrant Mexicans
into a tank of gasoline. A hobo threw
a match into the tank and burned all
but one. This Mexican spread the news
to Villa, who was at large at the
i time, that the Americans were burning
j Mexicans in oil. This precipitated the
| Columbus raid. This was the El Paso
! holocaust the facts of which were little
j known by Americans.
