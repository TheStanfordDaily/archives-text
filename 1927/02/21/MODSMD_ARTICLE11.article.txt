# INDIAN FIVE WINS INTRAMURAL GAME
## Semi-Finals of Basketball Tourney Reached With Friday's Play-Offs 
### 
FRIDAY'S INTRAMURAL RESULTS
Sigma Chi, 13; Phi Gamma Delta, 7
Indians, 14; Sequoia I, 7
Four teams remain in the race for
the Hastings intramural basketball
trophy as a result of the completion
of the quarter-final play-offs last Fri
day afternoon. Wednesday, Breakers
Club will take the floor against the
Phi Kaps and at 4:15 o'clock and at
5 o'clock Sigma Chi will play the
Indians.
These same Indians established
themselves as potent contenders for
glory when they downed Sequoia I
l£7 Friday afternoon. Led by Teloni
cher, running guard, and Monferino,
forward, the bearskin five held the
opposition to three free throws and
two field goals, which were them
selves lucky shots.
Indian Teamwork Rough
Each man on the Indian team has
at one time or another held a place on
the Fresno State College team, Mon
ferino and Telonicher having been
stars of the same magnitude ns Wil
helmson, this "year's Fresno pride. Al
though the Indians are rough in point
of teamwork, their individual play is
such that they will make Sigma Chi
step to win and, if they succeed in
guarding Bowers well, will put them
selves in reach of victory.
Telonicher contributed ten points to
his team's score, while Tullv and Mon
ferino each made a goal. Stimpson, Se
quoia guard, startled the onlookers by
sinking two shots at sharp angles to
the basket. Cook, the Sequoia high
point man, was stopped in his shoes
and made one ione point on a free
throw.
Sigma Chi's Win
Under the inspiration of Fred
Bowers, the lanky sophomore, Sigma
Chi effectually stopped the Fiji attack
to win 13-7. Bowers himself made nine
points in spite of the fact that he was
watched like a mouse. At times he
would fox Downing and Miller and
slip the ball through for a score.
The first half ended with the score
5-2 in favor of the Sigma Chi's. The
guarding was close and the play slow
and hesitant. Farmers put in a long
shot from mid-floor and a minute later
worked his way to the basket for a
short one. The ball rolled off the hoop,
but the ever-present Bowers was on
hand to Op it in.
Blazier, Miller Star
Hal Blazier and Joe Miller were
the leading lights for the vanquished
quintet. Miller, a guard, early adopted
the policy of shooting from mid-floor
and succeeded in scoring a goal there
bly. He played a fast, fighting game
and was instrumental in keeping
Bowers at a respectful distance from
the basket.
Semi-final games scheduled for
Wednesday as follows:
4:15 —Breakers vs. Phi Kappa Sigma.
5:00t —Sigma Chi vs. Indians.
