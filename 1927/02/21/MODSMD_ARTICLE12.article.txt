Three new writers have stories in
this number, and three articles by
others who have previously contri
buted appear also.
"Moods," by Anne Waldron, con
cerns an artist and his last master
piece. Virginia Greene's "Mirage" is
a story of a girl who longs to get
away from the desert. "For the Glory
of Mammouth," written by Kenneth
Funk, is a study of a town's method
of Babbittizing itself through an essay
contest. These three stories are in a
serious vein.
In a humorous manner, Oliver Wil
lard describes a modern parent's esca
pades when he assumes the identity
of his son in "Like Son, Like Father."
Webster Street, in "The Smile of Un
derstanding," has written a study of
a man who is forced to give up his
business and life. In "Beauty and
Brains," Fred Speers gives another
angle on the popular campus question.
And in "What's Wrong with American
Colleges," Emerson Spencer gives an
editorial viewpoint on this Mencken
esque topic.
