# WATER POLO TEAMS DEFEAT CALIFORNIA VARSITY, FRESHMEN
## Card Forwards Unrivaled as Scoring Combination During Game 
### 
Outfighting: and outplaying the Cali
fornia swimmers in every feature of
the game, the Cardinal water polo
team emerged victorious from the
match held Friday night in the Athens
Club pool, with a score of 13 to 0. In
a game preceding the varsity contest,
the Stanford freshmen downed the
Cubs 5 to 2.
Combination Unrivaled
As a scoring combination, O'Con
nor, Van den Akker, and Christenson
were practically unrivaled. Both O'-
Connor and Captain Williams con
sistently took the ball from the start
and worked it up to the California
goal. Christenson accounted for six
of the goals, O'Connor for six, and
Burns, who was sent in at the half,
for one.
With Williams, Ward, aud Maitby
guarding the Stanford territory, the
Bears were unable to work the ball
down the pool. All three men, as
sisted by the forwards, blocked any
offensive work that California might
offer. Poulson and Hinckle played an
excellent game as goal-guards. With
but a few minutes before the end of
the game, and three Stanford men out 1
on fouls, Hinckle had his hands full
to keep the Bears scoreless, but man
aged to stop all the throws for the
goal.
Game Off Standard
Displaying a game that was far off
their standard, the Stanford freshmen
won out in their game by only three
goals. Harrison and Hobdy showed
up especially well for the yearlings,
the former doing most of the scoring,
while Hobdy was the center of the
Stanford guarding.
McLean of California started the,
game with a long dribble and a fast i
goal, but from then till the end of the
half, the ball was always in California
territory. Hobdy, Peters, Pahl, and
Gerstenkorn were responsible for the
close guarding, while Harrison, Kin
kead. and Driggs did most of the j
scoring. Captain Hobdy, after miss- â– 
ing several long shots, finally threw
the last goal of the evening from the
middle of the pool.
