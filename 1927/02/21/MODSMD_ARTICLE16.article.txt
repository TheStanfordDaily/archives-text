# 'PRINCESS IDA' BURLESQUE OF FEMINIST MOVEMENT
## 
### 
The libretto of "Princess Ida"-is |
based on an earlier effort of Gilbert's
"The Princess," a broad burlesque of
both the rising feminist movement
and the sentimentalism of Tennyson's
poem "The Princess." Of the earlier j
version, Gilbart wrote: "The story of
Mr. Tennyson's 'Princess' supplied the j
subject matter, and I have endeav-1
oured to treat it so as to absolve my
self from charges of wilful irrever
ence."
"Princes Ida" has always been since
its first presentation one of the least j
well-known and least financially suc
cessful of the Gilbert and Sullivan
comic operas. This has been partially
because the music is more difficult
than that of the others, and also be
cause not until the 90's was the fem
inist movement strong enough or suf
ficiently widely recognized to serve as
a popular medium for satire.
"Princess Ida" is the only one of I
the Gilbert and Sullivan collabora !
tions to be written in three acts. The
dialogue is in blank verse, and much i

of it was lifted bodily from the ear
lier "The Princess."
The success of its first presentation
at the Savoy Theater in 1884 was jus
tified by its run of 246 performances.
One amusing story is told of Gilbert
during the first night. He was sitting
in the green-room when the French
man who had made the armor came
rushing in, telling him excitedly of
the applause and cheers in the audi
torium. Gilbert looked at him calmly
and said, "Yes, I think it is going very
well."
"But you are so calm!" cried the
Frenchman, disgusted with this ex
ample of British stolidity. In telling I
of the occurrence afterward, Gilbert I
added: "I suppose he wanted me to \
kiss the carpenters!"
The Savoy was the first theater to j
be lighted, both stage and auditorium, |
by electricity. This was considered a i
daring experiment. Gas connections j
were made throughout the theater, so
that In case of emergency the whole j
building could be flooded with gas
light witliiu a few seconds.
