# CARDINAL PUGILISTS MAKE CLEAN SWEEP IN AGGIE MATCHES
## Varsity Establishes Itself As Leading Contender For Coast Honors 
### 
Making a clean sweep of the seven
bouts on the program against the Cali
fornia Agricultural College in the pa
vilion last Friday night, Coach Harry
W. Maloney's Stanford varsity boxing
squad firmly established itself as a
leading contender for Coast honors in
the coming Far Western Intercolle
giate Tournament.
Five of the seven fights were won
by the decision of the referee, one
was stopped in order that the Aggie
man might not suffer from too much
punishment, and the last bout on the
card was won by a knockout.
Cards Superior
From the first bout when Captain
Carlos Miron, fighting the best scrap
of his collegiate career, out-rushed,
out-punched, and out-guessed Captain
A1 Gome? of the Aggies, it was evi
dent that the Cardinals were superior.
This bout between Miron and Gomez
is the third meeting of the pair, and
the Stanford captain is now at the top
of coast collegiate featherweights. In
their two former meetings, fighting
for the Far Western honors, Gomez
won only by the shade of the referee's
decision.
Ross and Traenor took Joerger and
McCline, the Aggie lightweights, into
camp in two fast three-round bouts,
in which the Farmers were complete
ly outclassed.
Welter Fight Called
Newton Ridley followed in the wel
ter class and kept the Stanford score
intact with a nicely paced fight over
Williams-Foote which was called into
the fourth round after three rounds
of pretty even scrapping.
Myron Schall, last year's varsity
captain, drew a strong man in G.
Garner of the Aggies, but a superior
amount of ring experience finally
overcame the ruggedness of his op
ponent, and Schall has still to be de
feated in the collegiate "squared cir
cle."
Norman Fain, in the light heavy di
vision, who is improving with every
contest, also kept clean his record in
college fighting by scoring a decisive
win over Creamer of the Aggies which
was stopped by the referee.
Richard Dorman, fighting in the
heavy class, won from D. Mulkey by a
knockout with three clean cuts to the
jaw.
