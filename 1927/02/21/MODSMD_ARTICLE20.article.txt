# BEARS DEFEAT CARDS IN FIRST CAGE CONTEST
## Team Unlimbers Smoother Attack, Closer Guarding Than Expected JAYRED GETS TIP-OFFS Forwards Fail to Register Long Shots; Opponents Display Power 
### Fred Speers 
Doing the expected, California took
the first game of the annual basket
ball series last Friday night when the
Bears won from Stanford 32 to 24. But
the Cardinal did not wilt under a
driving California attack, nor was it
hopelessly outclassed, nor did it give
reason to believe that the second
clash will be in the nature of a setup.
Stanford unlimbered a smoother at
tack and a closer guarding game than
had been expected. With Jayred out
jumping Corbin time and again the
Cardinals carried the attack to Cali
fornia on practically every tipoff play,
and it was only the closer, more ag
gressive guarding of the Bears, cou
pled with failure to register setup
shots, that held down Stanford's
scores in the opening minutes.
Guarding Tightens
The Cardinals opened the scoring
and before California had uncovered
its power took a 9 to 5 lead. Then the
Bears' guarding tightened and Stan
ford's shooting was made from just
beyond the foul line. Only fast, short
passing rushes were able to penetrate
the California defense, long passes
and lor.g shots being scarce.
California led at half time, 15 to
11, after overcoming the Cardinals'
earlier lead. When the second half
opened. Hunt's men were fighting with
their backs to the wall, vainly trying
to check a display of power on the
part of the Bears. Not only power but
confidence, coupled with shooting
from any position, marked California's
play during the beginning of the sec
ond half.
Watson Leads Bears
Watson and Dixon were playing
great garnet, the former leading the
Bear attack, the latter bolstering the
defense. Both accounted for a long
shot apiece such as Jayred tried to
equal but could not. Bryant and Jay
red were the main cogs of Stanford's
offensive work. Christ turned in a
superlative game when he went in for
McCandless.
Vincenti with Anderson, until the
latter was taken out on personals,
played a strong game at guard. Handi
capped by size, their work was not up
to the caliber of California's guards
but it was equal to that of their Bear
rivals in breaking up passing attacks.
Lewis was sent in for Anderson, and
Biaggini later saw action, both turn
ing in good games.
"With the score 31 to 18 against
them in the closing minutes, the
Cardinals sank three field goals, but
not enough to threaten the Bruins'
lead. California eased in a free throw
to end the evening's scoring.
Watson, California's captain for
ward. led in scoring honors for tho
evening with twelve points. Corbin
was next with nine, and Bryant and
Jayred tied for third with seven
points each.
