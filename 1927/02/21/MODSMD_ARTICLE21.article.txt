# BABE NINE DEFEATED BY STRONG ALAMEDA HIGH SCHOOL TEAM
## 
### 
Though playing an even game most
of the way, the freshman baseball nine
got off to a bad start in the first three
innings and as a result lost to a strong
Alameda High School team Saturday
morning by a count of 6-1. During the
last six innings neither squad was
able to score.
Two of Alameda's runs came in the
first, and the rest came in the third,
following a series of solid hits and
errors. McMicking scored Stanford's
lone run in the first inning, reaching
home from second on a pretty single
by Laird.
Despite the result, the babes showed
noticeable improvement over the form
shown in their contest last week. The
Alameda team was unusually strong
for a high school outfit. Alameda has
won the North Coast C.I.F. champion
ship for four of the past six years.
Bianclii at short was one of the
outstanding performers for the Cardi
nals, the whole infield functioning
"well. Though in an undesirable num
i ber of bad holes. Levercnz pitched a
very creditable game.
The freshman hitting was again
rather weak. Stanford gathered but
five hits during the contest, to Ala*
| meda's nine. Five errors were marked
against the freshmen, and two against
Alameda.
The Stanford lineup included: Leve
renz, p.; Sparks, c.; Levin, Ist. Storey,
2d; Laird, 3d; Bianchi, ss; McMicking,
If; Murphy, cf.; Nye, rf.
