# White Collars
## 
### 
The editor of The Liberty Magazine has something to say about
education as it is dealt out to the students of the modern universities
today:
"A white-collar education doesn't amount to much unless it includes
making enough money to keep the collars white; and the fellow who
utilizes an overall education in the daytime usually has plenty of white
collars for evenings and Sundays."
The advocates of the present system of education point to the business
colleges and technical schools as institutions for those who want- an
education in order to be able to earn a living when they have completed
their training. Certainly four years in college is for the purpose of
broadening a person to some extent, and for the pttrpose of giving the
students some theories, and a little polish thrown in, but it is also for the
purpose of giving the students some ideas and suggestions as to how to
earn the daily bread, or the money for the baby's shoes. Granted that
there are some, maybe a good number, who do not have to worry about
such things as jobs when they step into the world, still there is a large
number that have come to college to learn how to make a living.
A college education was reserved at one time for the wealthy and
practically no one else, except an occasional one of Horatius Alger's
Bound-to-Win boys. They came to an institution in order to spend four
years with pleasant companions and to postpone taking the positions in
father's bank until they were granted a sheep-skin. But today the situa
tion is changed. This change is evident at Stanford where a large per
centage is forced to earn all or a portion of its way through college.
These self-supporting students are interested in being broadened, inter
ested in theoretical education, but they are also interested in pecuniary
matters.
Banking is an important occupation, but is there a practical banking
course given at universities today? Certainly not at Stanford. There is
a course in the theory of banking, which is good and should be kept
among the worth-while subjects, but a course in theory could well be
supplemented with a quarter or two of practical banking problems. Adver
tising, one of the most comprehensive of businesses today, is taught at
Stanford in the form of theory only.
In teaching medicine, theories are essential, but no student ever
became a doctor with merely theories in his head. The practical side of
the subjects can not be overlooked. And yet some say, a plumbers' school,
a carpenters' school, or other specialized institutions, are the only places
for the unfortunates that have not a bank presidency awaiting them when
they face the world.

earn the daily bread, or the money for the baby's shoes. Granted that
there are some, maybe a good number, who do not have to worry about
such things as jobs when they step into the world, still there is a large
number that have come to college to learn how to make a living.
A college education was reserved at one time for the wealthy and
practically no one else, except an occasional one of Horatius Alger's
Bound-to-Win boys. They came to an institution in order to spend four
years with pleasant companions and to postpone taking the positions in
father's bank until they were granted a sheep-skin. But today the situa
tion is changed. This change is evident at Stanford where a large per
centage is forced to earn all or a portion of its way through college.
These self-supporting students are interested in being broadened, inter
ested in theoretical education, but they are also interested in pecuniary
matters.
Banking is an important occupation, but is there a practical banking
course given at universities today? Certainly not at Stanford. There is
a course in the theory of banking, which is good and should be kept
among the worth-while subjects, but a course in theory could well be
supplemented with a quarter or two of practical banking problems. Adver
tising, one of the most comprehensive of businesses today, is taught at
Stanford in the form of theory only.
In teaching medicine, theories are essential, but no student ever
became a doctor with merely theories in his head. The practical side of
the subjects can not be overlooked. And yet some say, a plumbers' school,
a carpenters' school, or other specialized institutions, are the only places
for the unfortunates that have not a bank presidency awaiting them when
they face the world.
The editor of The Liberty Magazine has something to say about
education as it is dealt out to the students of the modern universities
today:
"A white-collar education doesn't amount to much unless it includes
making enough money to keep the collars white; and the fellow who
utilizes an overall education in the daytime usually has plenty of white
collars for evenings and Sundays."
The advocates of the present system of education point to the business
colleges and technical schools as institutions for those who want- an
education in order to be able to earn a living when they have completed
their training. Certainly four years in college is for the purpose of
broadening a person to some extent, and for the pttrpose of giving the
students some theories, and a little polish thrown in, but it is also for the
purpose of giving the students some ideas and suggestions as to how to
earn the daily bread, or the money for the baby's shoes. Granted that
there are some, maybe a good number, who do not have to worry about
such things as jobs when they step into the world, still there is a large
number that have come to college to learn how to make a living.
