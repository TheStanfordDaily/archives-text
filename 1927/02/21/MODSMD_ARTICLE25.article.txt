# Little Drops of Water
## 
### 
"Rain, rain, go away."
So runs the nursery rhyme, and so goes the thought in most Stanford
students' heads today. Every drop of rain has its place, but it has 110
place at a Washington Birthday holiday. Tomorrow we are celebrating
the birthday of the father of our country, and not the rain god.
Now, Mr. Pluvius, we do not want to appear ungrateful for the full
lake that you have given the campus this year, and we thank you sincerely
for this favor, but please go away and leave the Peninsula until Wednes
day, and then you can come back and rain all you want.
