Bigger and better De Molay dances are reported in Pomona's The
Student Life:
"There was mu.sic that made collegiate toes curl up in joy and collegiate
feet dance with gusto around and around the polished floor. There was punch
that made collegiate lips smack and their owners holler "More, more." And
there were dances of all sorts with sighing sweet waltzes to ultra-syncopated
fox-trots. And the decorations and programs wore decidedly appropriate."
