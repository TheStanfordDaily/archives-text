The Editor, Sir: ]
After settling down for the night in
my cap and gown I chanced to hit on
the "Bull Session."
Is it possible that anyone lacks the
taste that the editor of that column
does? He attacks our motives, our
ideals, our traditions, our buildings;
our Memorial Church, to be exact.
This reference to a supposed simi-1
larity between Barnum's attractions
and the mosaic front of the church is
disgusting. It seems to be his aim to
emulate "Innocents Abroad." If he j
has no better taste than to deride |
works of beauty, works acknowledged j
to be fine, works that people come
leagues to see, then let him keep his J
face clenched tight shut. People read i
the "Bull Session" and call it Stan
ford, similarly as we read that "well
bred" little article in the Californiac j
reprinted in the Daily concerning co
education, and thought in terms of
"U.C." If I send the Daily to friends !
I do not want them to believe the i
Spirit of Stanford is the Spirit of the i
Bull Session.
Four months ago when Bob Lewis
(may he forgive me) asked that the i
Bull in Bull Session be tossed out, I j
in all the arrogance of my first quar- I
ter, leaped to that column's defense. 1
May God forgive me!

Impending legislation in various
i states of the U.S.A. is demanding that
our schools reject the light of modern
science in favor of the darkness of
antique ignorance.
For house illumination no builder
| dreams of ignoring electric appliances
and relying on old tallow "dips"; but,
in mental illumination, we modernists
are to be compelled still to retain the
, puerile legends and myths of bygone
i ages, when our little earth was re
garded as the whole universe. As
tronomers now prove to us that it is
the merest speck in space. Thinkers,
j therefore, ask for a reconsideration of
J our views of Deity; and refuse to
accept the jealous, angry, revengeful,
blood-thirsty Jahveh of Jewish his
; torv, as the Inscrutable Power whose
fiat rules this universe of inconceiv
able magnitude; a universe un
dreamed of alike by Hebrew histo
rians or Puritan preachers. Truth is
great and must prevail; no legislation
can alter physical facts or success
fully bolster up untenable fiction, how
ever venerable. Such fiction degrades,
instead of exalting and magnifying,
the Omniscient.
Is it desirable to uphold it by legis
lation?

ideals, our traditions, our buildings;
our Memorial Church, to be exact.
This reference to a supposed simi-1
larity between Barnum's attractions
and the mosaic front of the church is
disgusting. It seems to be his aim to
emulate "Innocents Abroad." If he j
has no better taste than to deride |
works of beauty, works acknowledged j
to be fine, works that people come
leagues to see, then let him keep his J
face clenched tight shut. People read i
the "Bull Session" and call it Stan
ford, similarly as we read that "well
bred" little article in the Californiac j
reprinted in the Daily concerning co
education, and thought in terms of
"U.C." If I send the Daily to friends !
I do not want them to believe the i
Spirit of Stanford is the Spirit of the i
Bull Session.
Four months ago when Bob Lewis
(may he forgive me) asked that the i
Bull in Bull Session be tossed out, I j
in all the arrogance of my first quar- I
ter, leaped to that column's defense. 1
May God forgive me!
