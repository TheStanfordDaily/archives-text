GALAHAD, by John Erskine. The I
, Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis. |
We don't have to say rrrncli about this
novel, because..everyone, or nearly every- 1
one has heard of its popularity. "Gala- j
had" is even more readable than "Helen I
of Troy"'; it has the same constrained i
humor, and perhaps more of the stuff ;
that will encourage meditation. It has
even sold better than the Trojan story.

It should be a matter of encourage- i
ment to the classicists to realize that
probably more people read the tale of \
Guinevere, Lancelot. Arthur, and Gala- i
had during the last few months than '
during any other years since Tennyson. ;
or somebody, conceived the story. In- j
stead of despairing of the public taste for j
preferring this new humorous rendering, '
should we not rather be content that a
taste for satire has succeeded the appe
tite for sentimentality, mystery, and ad
venture ?
This started out to be an article on I
"Galahad," but the book really needs no
review.
It ought to be said that the story isn't
principally about Galahad. It is mostly j
about Guinivere. one of the Klaines, and j
Lancelot. The plot is composed of three j
women and one coincidence. No one who ;
has read any of Professor Erskine's nov- i
els will think of him as a man only j

dimly aware of what is going on in the
world. Indeed, he seems well abreast of
the times, well able to estimate the in
clination of the reading public, and to
guage its taste. He handles sex like a
modern—outspokenly enough to acquit
him of prudery. Just read it and find
out for yourself whether it deserves its
popularity.
—Emerson Spencer.
