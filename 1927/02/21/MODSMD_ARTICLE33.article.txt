# PSYCHOLOGISTS SHOW INTEREST IN SPHERE OF NEWS INFLUENCE
## 
### Anne Waldron 
Psychologists now evince more in
terest in the influence of the news
pa per and periodical than they did
forty or fifty years ago, although no
defihite experiments have made along
such lines, according to Dr. J. E.
Coover of the Psychology department.
In the old days, the chief influence
of any publication lay in the fact that
it was in print. Papers were compara
tively few; cost of production rela
tively high; and practically no papers
were run throughout the country on
a syndicate basis. Thus the editor of
each paper shaped its policy more di
rectly. The great mass of the popula
tion had less education and believed
more readily what they read.
Although most of these conditions
have been changed with the increas
ing public education, the newspaper
and periodical wields a larger influ
ence today than ever before.
Dailies Influence
The great number of daily papers
which hammer constantly at the pub
lic mind is largely responsible for
this. Dr. Coover believes. He also
thinks that the newspaper is prone to
exceed its function in informing and
educating the public and to become
an agent for propaganda.
Increased sales-value of printed ma
terial causes editors throughout the
country to accept manuscripts coming
from authors not only inadequately
familiar with their subjects, but some
times almost illiterate.
Psychic Book
A striKing example of interest to
Stanford people was the appearance
in 1907 of a book, "Psychic Life," by
a medium well-known in the 80's who
maintained that in a seance she had
given before President and Mrs. Grant
and Senator and Mrs. Stanford in
October of 1894, the spirit of Leland
Stanford, Jr., had asked his father to
establish a university in his memory.
This story, played up by papers all
over the country, gave innumerable
people the impression that Stanford
University was conceived in super
stition at a spiritualistic seance.
The refutation of the story was
definitely made by Dr. David Starr
Jordan in 1917 on the discovery of
some notes of Senator Stanford's. Sen
ator Stanford stated that his decision
to fund the University and the draw
ing of his and his wife's wills had
been made in April 1884. He admitted
that he and Mrs. Stanford were pres
ent at the seance, but stated also that
the woman was shown up as a fraud
very shortly after it.
