"If there was the same propensity in mankind for investigating the
motives, as there is for censuring the conduct, of public characters,
it would be found that the censure so freely bestowed is oftentimes
unmerited and uncharitable." — George Washington.


Tomorrow, February 22, the nation will celebrate the
185 th anniversary of the birth of George Washington.
