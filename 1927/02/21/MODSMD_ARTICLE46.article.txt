# Let George Do It
## 
### 
Today's subject, in thi3 series of
"New Big League Managers," is
George Moriarty, of the Detroit Ti
gers. Last November, when Ty Cobb
was eased out of a job, the American
League also lost a very good umpire.
For George Moriarty, in donning his
new managerial toga, or whatever it
is that the ball club bosses wear, first
had to doff the mask and chest protec
tor of an umpire, which raiment lie
had worn for nearly ten years.
Before calling balls and strikes in
the younger circuit, George played the
game himself for sixteen years, ten
of which were spent with the club of
which he is now boss. To be brief, in
3909 the Yankees sold Moriarty,
whom they had purchased two year 3
earlier from Toledo, to Detroit for
$6000. That year the Tigers won the
pennant, and who knows but that they
may do it again in the first season
they have George with them as man
ager.
Moriarty should make a goood man
ager for several reasons. One is be
cause he knows baseball from A to Z.
Another is because he is popular in
Detroit, not only with the players,
but with the fans. Also, because he
has plenty of good common sense, be
cause he is fearless and fair, and be
cause he well understands the things
that men he will manage have to
contend with, individually and col
lectively. Besides that, George is a
fighter—and fighting teams win pen
nants.

But there are other things in Mr.
Moriarty's past besides baseball,
things that should only be spoken of
in whispers. I tremble even now lest
Judge Land is read these words and
start an investigation. George Mori
arty is a poet! He has even had some
verses printed! He sings songs too,
even some of his own, and if that ever
got out, the Cobb-Leonard-Speaker
scandal would pale into insignifi
cance! Besides all that, he is a dis
ciple of Izaak Walton, an enthusiastic
and successful fisherman, who right
now is fishing for the biggest haul of
his career.
