# DR. SOARES DISCUSSES BIBLE AS LITERATURE
## 
### 
"Discussion is rife today in regard
to studying the Bible as literature,"
said the Reverend Theodore Gerard
Soares, of the University of Chicago,
in his address at the Memorial Church
yesterday.
"The principal reason for looking
upon the Bible as literature is that
that is exactly what it is. Literature
is an artistic attempt to interpret life
in the terms of letters. This is just
what the Bible does in its simple, and
at times, even naive stories. Their
extraordinary artless interpretations
help us to form our own versions of
life," continued Dr. Soares.
