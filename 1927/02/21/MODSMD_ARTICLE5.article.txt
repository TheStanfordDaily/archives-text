# BEAR FRESHMEN WIN BASKETBALL SERIES FROM STANFORD FIVE
## Game Here Saturday Night Ends 26-25 in Favor Of California 
### 
By their 26 to 25 victory over the
Stanford babes in the pavilion Satur
day night, the California Cubs barely
won their second game of the annual
series and the championship. When
Captain Berg tossed a beautifully
placed shot from mid-floor into the
basket just as the timer's gun went
off, he climaxed the powerful rally of
his teammates.
Lack One Throw
If the Cardinal beginners had been
able to tally more of their twenty-two
free shots, this basket of Berg's might
have meant the turning of tables, a
one-point victory for Husky Hunt's
men, and the playing of another game
to decide the tie between the Cali
fornia and Cardinal freshmen. As it is,
the championship has been conceded
on the two victories of the Cubs, and
there will be no more basketball this
season as far as the Stanford year
lings are concerned.
In the first play of the game Berg
sank a free shot fi-om a penalty called
on Eyck, center for Cal, and put his
team in the lead, which it maintained
until the end of the first half. The
score was 12 to 11.
Cards Play Loosely
During the first part of the next
twenty minutes, Clint Evans' men ran
up a 19 to 13 lead. The Stanford squad
was playing too loosely on the de
fense for the territory style and the
California men were using a definite
territory system. They were able to
go through Hunt's defense and make
their well-placed shots.
Led by Captain Berg on the offense
and the stellar work of Thompson at
guard, the Cardinal freshmen staged
a powerful rally that came near spell
ing defeat for California. Rothert was
sent in for Bush at center, and Bush
was moved in to Garibotto's position
at forward. This combination could
not get under way satisfactorily, and
Bowling took Rothert's center place.
The babes failed to follow up their
shots.
Game Rough
The game on the whole was rough
and close. Neither team was abso
lutely sure of the outcome until the
final gun. Berg carried the brunt of
the vicious Stanford attack on Cali
fornia and Thompson proved his met
tle at guard and saved the Cardinal
basket from the accurate shooting of
the California- forwards.
The line-up that started for the
babes included: Berg and Garibotto,
forwards; Bush, center; Smith and
Thompson, guards. Substitutes were:
Bowling for Garibotto, Simkins for
Smith. Rothert for Bush, Bush for
Garibotto, Stewart for Bush, and Dow
line for Rothert.
