DEL MONTE, Feb. 20. â€”Edwin Mey
berg of Stanford and Harold Thomp
son of Southern Branch reached the
finals today in the California Intercol
legiate Championship Golf Tourna
ment by virtue of victories over Ward
Edmonds and Bob Syer, both of Stan
ford, respectively.
Edmonds, who had previously de
feated Gaines of Redlands in the
closest match of the second round,
could not compete with the great
game that Meyberg produced, losing
out one up. The match was close the
whole way and each alternated in
taking the lead, neither player being
more than two up at any stage of the
match. They came to the last hole all
square, and Meyberg took it with a
par.
Southern Golfer Wins
The Southern golfer, who won the
championship last year, achieved his
victory with more ease, winning three
and two over Syer. The latter played
an excellent game, but Thompson was
superior and produced a steadier
game than the Stanford man.
In the second round, Meyberg,
Syer, and Thompson disposed of their
opponents with little diciculty.
