# CARD DIAMOND PLAYERS LOSE TO ST. MARY'S
## Poor Fielding, Weak Hitting Contribute to Defeat Of Varsity Nine PHILIPPI HALTS SAINTS First Score for Home Team Comes in Eighth Frame; Final Rally Fails 
### Edwin Randol 
Completely outclassing the Stanford
varsity yesterday afternoon in a Wash
ington's Birthday special, the St. Mary's
baseball nine won a long contest from
the Cardinals by a score of 10 to 2.
Stanford played its poorest game of the
season, ragged fielding, weak hitting, and
bad judgment featuring the contest. St.
Mary's, however, presented a strong
team and had no trouble in winning the
game by a wide margin.
_ John Sobieski started on th.> mound
for Stanford but was driven to the
showers in the seventh after seven runs
had been scored. Riese, who relieved
, him, fared little better. The first ,man
facing him singled and the next doubled,
scoring two more runs. Coach Harry
Wolter then called on Bob Philippi, who
was finally able to put an end to the
rampage.
Second Frame Worst
Five of the Saints' runs .crossed the
platter in the second when three two-base
hits, two errors, and a hit batsman com
bined to give the visitors a safe lead.
One more score followed in the fourth,
and then the Saints put the game on
ice with their seventh inning scoring.
The first Stanford score came in the
eighth inning, when Marks, pinch hit
ting for Wilton, was given life by an
t-rror by Dondero, went to second on
Davis' sacrifice, took third on a passed
ball, and scored on a wild pitch. The
Cardinals came to life for the first time
in the last stanza when Sypher con
nected for a single, Nissen duplicated,
and Harder sent Sypher home with a
| double. However, this rally was short
i lived, for McV'ey fanned both Philippi
I and Adams to end the game.
Sypher Alone Stars
Cook Sypher was the only man on
the Cardinal nine who seemed to have
I any life, the peppy receiver working hard
all the time. Philippi showed up well in
his first real chance this season, fanning
rive of ten men facing him. Maguire led
the Cards in hitting for the day.
Larry Bettencourt was the outstand
ing star on the St. Mary's nine, while
House pitched a nice game for eight in
nings, when he was relieved by McVey.
