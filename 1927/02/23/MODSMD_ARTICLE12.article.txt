# CARDS, L.A.A.C. REACH AGREEMENT ON DATE FOR TRACK CONTEST
## Masters Receives Telegram Accepting March 24 For Meet 
### 
Stanford will meet the Los Angeles
Athletic Club track team in the Coli
seum, Los Angeles, March 24, stated
A1 Masters, graduate manager, after
receiving a telegram from Charles
Keppon, athletic director of the club
men accepting that date. The telegram
was in reply to a letter by Masters
answering charges appearing in the
February 10 issue of the Los Angeles
Times that Stanford was purposely
dodging a meet with L.A.A.C. because
it had been beaten last year and that
Stanford's statement that it did not
have enough money to bring the club
team north to play was merely an
other way of saying that it didn't want
the meet.
In his letter to the club, Masters
said that if this was the true feeling
of the club future negotiations would
be called off. He explained that the
trouble was caused by a last-minute
switch of the U.S.C.-California meet
in the South and the U.S.C. schedule
up here, so the date held for the
L.A.A.C. team was taken.
Masters offered the clubmen a meet
in Los Angeles between March 19 and
26 but this was refused because of (he
California-U.S.C. meet on March 26.
He admitted that the funds were low
nnd that inasmuch as the Southern
team came here last year Stanford
expected to hold the meet in the
South and had put that money aside
for another meet. If they wanted to
meet at Stanford he offered March 26,
giving the club all receipts up to $1000
and splitting the balance, but stated
j that he did not believe such a meet
I would pay because it would be during
I spring vacation.
Keppen requested that all such news
paper stories as that in the Times be
disregarded because L.A.A.C. did not
| sanction that kind of publicity. He
i stated that the club has nothing but
the highest regard for Stanford Uni
versity and would do nothing which
would in any way jeopardize future
relations.
