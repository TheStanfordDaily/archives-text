# HUNT DRILLS VARSITY IN DEFENSIVE PLAYS TO CHECK CALIFORNIA
## Team Practices Easy Shots With Short Rushes on Ball-Passing Stressed 
### Merle Emry 
Practice on defensive plays to check
tiie effective attack of the California
Bear basketball squad was handed out
to the varsity cagemen yesterday after
noon, preparatory to the second game
of the series Saturday night.
Using two teams, one of which em
ployed the same plays as California, and
the other to strengthen the Cardinal de
fense, Coach Hunt stressed floor position
and zone defense. The California for
wards, Watson and Dixon, will not find it
so easy to pick their side-line positions in
shooting for the Stanford goal as they
did in the first game. With Jayred at
the pivot position on the defense, sup
ported by Bryant and McCandless work
ing the side-lines, and Anderson and
Vincenti guarding the back court, the
Cardinals present a strong defense that
should be able to cope with the fast at
tack of Price's men.
Practice on set-up shots, the visible
weakness of the varsity against the Blue
and Gold, was also emphasized. Long
passes and long shots coupled with short
rushes on passing the ball were the other
main exercises dealt out by Hunt. With
the handicap of the superior height of
the California men, the varsity will re
sort to a fast, pivoting game seasoned by
long trys to the goal.
Smoothing some of the tip-off plays
which functioned well, the Cardinals
again should be able to lead the Bears
otu of this department of the game. It
was due largely to aggressiveness of the
Stanford five last Friday on the first
plays that enabled them to roll up a lead
before the California men could get or
ganized.
