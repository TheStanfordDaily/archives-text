### 
Holding a decisive win over the
California Agricultural College, as its
record in outside competition in the
1927 season, Coach Harry W. Ma
loney's Stanford varsity boxing squad
looks to higher laurels and harder
fights, and is meeting the tough scrap
pers of the San Francisco Olyjnpic
Club Friday night in the city.
With his men in the best of condi
tion, having gained considerable ring
experience against the Aggies, Coach
Maloney is confident that the Clubmen
will not have easy sailing.
Led by Captain Carlos Miron, the
squad will have several fast workouts
during the first days of this week, and
will ease up the last few days.
