# ENSEMBLES, SOLOS OF "PRINCESS IDA" PROVE DIFFICULT
## BOONE DIRECTS DANCES Humor, Nonsense Plentiful In Stanford Production Of Light Opera 
### 
Colorful ensembles, approaching in
size and in difficulty of production those
of grand opera, together with tuneful
solos and typical Gilbert and Sullivan
nonsense are found in abundance in
"Princess Ida, to be given Friday even
ing in the University Assembly Hall.
From the opening chorus, which pre
sents the male members of King Hilde
brand's court on the lookout for King
Gama and Princess Ida, to the finale, the
opera is full of the melody and humor
which have made the operas of the fa
mous English collaborators popular.
Prince's Solo Good
Prince Hilarion's solo, "Today We
Meet, My Baby Bride and I," is one
of the outstanding numbers of the op
eretta. Bailey H. Xevvlee, in this role,
has a clear tenor voice well adapted to
the part.
The outstanding individual work is
Miss Winifred Estabrook's aria in which
Princess Ida discusses her antipathy for
all things masculine, even to chessmen.
Chorus Training Hard
One of the most difficult tasks in pre
paring the production is the training of
the chorus of thirty-five. The musical
part of this work is under the supervision
of Warren D. Allen, director of the Glee
Club, while Frances Boone is in charge
of the dancing.
The chorus ensembles, one of which
at the end of the first act includes al
most fifteen minutes of straight singing,
are made doubly hard to produce by the
involved nature of the rhythm of the
music to which the words must be sung.
