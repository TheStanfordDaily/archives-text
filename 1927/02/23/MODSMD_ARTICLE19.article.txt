# SEARSVILLE CONDUIT WASHED OUT BY FLOOD
## 
### 
Wth fifty feet of the flume from
Searsville washed out Sunday, there is
at present no danger of Laguniat brim
ming over despite the fact that Sears
ville Lake has overflowed, says Comp
troller A. E. Roth. The old flume was
opened to divert the water into San
Francisquito Creek. The heavy flood
tore out a portion of the conduit.
The break will be repaired shortly,
says Roth, in plenty of time for Lagunita
to fill completely.
