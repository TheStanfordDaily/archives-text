# SEMI-FINAL CONTESTS SCHEDULED IN MURAL BASKETBALL TOURNEY
## 
### 
Two teams aspiring for the intramural
basketball championship will be elimi
nated at the conclusion of the semi-final
games this afternoon. The Breakers are
slightly favored to win over the Phi
Kaps in the first contest, which will be
held at 4:15. In the second game, sched
uled for 5 o'clock, the Indians and
Sigma Chi are entering on nearly even
terms. If there is any preference, fol
lowers of the â™¦series think that the In
dians will win by a fair margin.
Cook and George will be the men that
will make the most difficulty for the
Phi Kaps, while the fraternity team can
produce the speedy floor work and the
accurate shooting of Saunders and Mc-
Culloch. Montferino and Telonicher are
destined to do much toward a victory for
the Indians. With them, they will have
the defense work of Allison and Tully.
On the Sigma Chi team, Bowers will in
all probability lead in the scoring, with
the assistance of Farmer, another for
ward, who showed up well in the last
game.
