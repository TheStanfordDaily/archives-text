noon in the Encina pool, Stanford can
safely claim the swimming champion
ship of the Pacific Coast. Both Oregon,

Olympic and Athens teams, have gone
down to defeat at the hands of the
Cardinals.
The Cardinal mermen got off to a
good start by winning the four-man
400-yard relay in the remarkable time
of .3:56 flat. Captain Stevenson of
Stanford and Rue of Hollywood staged

den Akker took a two-vard lead over
Floyd in the second. Christenson, who
swam third for Stanford, increased the
lead over Harris for two turns, but at
the end, was only half a length ahead.
O'Connor and Jarvis staged a fast
race in the last lap, with the Stanford
man winning by a good margin.

there for the whole race. Jarvis, his
