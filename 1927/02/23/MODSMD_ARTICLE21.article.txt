### Milton Silverman 
By defeating the Hollywood Ath
letic Club 37 to 22, yesterday after
noon in the Encina pool, Stanford can
safely claim the swimming champion
ship of the Pacific Coast. Both Oregon,
who holds the Northern champion
ship, and Hollywood, who is the best
in the South and has defeated the
Olympic and Athens teams, have gone
down to defeat at the hands of the
Cardinals.
The Cardinal mermen got off to a
good start by winning the four-man
400-yard relay in the remarkable time
of .3:56 flat. Captain Stevenson of
Stanford and Rue of Hollywood staged
a close race in the first lap, while Van
den Akker took a two-vard lead over
Floyd in the second. Christenson, who
swam third for Stanford, increased the
lead over Harris for two turns, but at
the end, was only half a length ahead.
O'Connor and Jarvis staged a fast
race in the last lap, with the Stanford
man winning by a good margin.
Fletcher Wins
Fletcher of Hollywood took first
place in the 200-yard backstroke with
out much difficulty. He started off in
the lead, keeping that position to the
end. In the last lap, West, who had
been trailing a good distance behind,
spurted up and nearly overtook the
leader. Danford of Stanford placed
third.
The Southerners easily took first
and second in the 50-yard free style.
Harris started out in front and stayed
there for the whole race. Jarvis, his
teammate, kept second, while Chris
tenson and Doerr fought it out for
third place, with the latter finally win
ning.
The Hollywood swimmers again took
112 lie lead in the 150-yard backstroke,
but this time Stevenson broke through
for second place. Ploessel and French
took first and third, respectively, al
though Brooks of Stanford very nearly
passed up the latler.
O'Connor, Williams Fast
O'Connor and Williams proved too
fast for the Hollywood swimmers in
the 100-yard free style, the former
■winning in 57 4-5. The two Stanford
men kept in front throughout the en
tire race, but in the last lap,, Harris
kept closing in on Williams, and fin
ished less than a foot behind him.
Winning his second race of the day,
O'Connor placed first in the 220-yard
swim, with Stevenson taking second,
and Floyd and Harris tying for third.
The two Cardinal men kept together
for the first lap. Stevenson then took
