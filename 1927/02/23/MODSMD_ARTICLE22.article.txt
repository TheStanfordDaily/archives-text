# DAILY TRYOUTS HELD FOR IRISH MARATHON BY TRACK MANAGERS
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Irish Marathon,
which will be run off on March 5, are
being held daily at the old oval. Track
managers will be out each afternoon
from 3:30 until 5 o'clock to time any
men who wish to try out for places on
their class teams in the marathon,
says Jay Lissner, junior track man
ager.
The Irish Marathon is a six-mile
race run by teams representing each
of the four classes. These teams are
composed of twenty-four men each,
every man running a quarter mile.
Runners for each class are selected
from the men trying out, the fastest
twenty-four from each being chosen.
Captains for the four teams are
Emerson Spencet\ senior; Tom Mc-
Guire, junior; Tom Moss, sophomore;
and Gibson Kingsbury, freshman.
