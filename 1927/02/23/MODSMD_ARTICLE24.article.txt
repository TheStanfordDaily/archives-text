# Notre Dame Shift
## 
### 
The football shift, which is commonly attributed to Notre Dame, is
practically abolished. The new rule, made by the conference of coaches,
requires a two-second stop between shifts. The O.A.C, Barometer makes
bold to make the following statement in regard to the ruling:
"Just what the object of the opposition to the style of play might
have been in requiring a two-second complete stop after the shift is
difficult of exact proof but to all appearances it was a protective clause
for the teams not using it. In the majority, the shift play has developed
into a serious menace to the less progressive teams. The easier way out
for the conservatives, who unfortunately were in the majority, was to
cripple the shift so as to render it useless."
It is needless to say that Oregon Agricultural College uses the Notre
Dame style of football. The Aggies' success on the gridiron during the
past season would also indicate that Coach Schissler uses the system to
advantage.
But by less progressive teams we presume the Oregon paper is refer
ring to such backward teams as Navy. Michigan, Alabama, Lafayette.
Brown, and Pittsburg, to say nothing of Stanford. The leading teams
of the country are. bv one sweeping statement from a college editor,
placed in the category of backward squads, merely because they win
games without using the Notre Dame shift.
I here is little doubt that the ruling will injure Ivnute Rockne and
his Notre Dame eleven, but probably a coach as smart as Rockne will
soon devise some style of play that is just as effective, just as interesting
for the spectators to watch, and with the bad points of the shift play
eliminated. It is also expected that Coach Schissler of O.A.C. will find
some way to get along without the shift.
The reason that Pop Warner gives for abolishing the shift is that "it
leads to arguments and places too much responsibility upon the officials.
Tiiere should not be anything about football which leaves a question in
the minds of either the spectators or officials as to whether or not the
game is being carried on properly."
For a referee to decide whether the backfield men come to a complete
stop is an impossibility. 1 his is not the case when a two-second pause is
required. Knute Rockne asked for a one-second stop, and perhaps this
compromise will be made at the end of next season if the longer pause
ruins the play. From the spectators' point of view the Notre Dame shift
makes football more interesting, but is the shift the only way that the
game can be made'spectacular ? Warner's reverse plays are interesting to
watch, and at the same time are legitimate, and the forward pass certainly
livens up the game.
