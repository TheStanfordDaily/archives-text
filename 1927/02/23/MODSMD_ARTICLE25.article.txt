# The 						Reason Why
## 
### 
Ihe Executive Committee deprived the Dramatic Council of the
privilege of sponsoring the cast dance after the production of "Princess
Ida" Friday night. Although the reason'for this action is not widely
known it is no secret, and should be made public.
There is a ruling that an organization giving a dance on the Stanford
campus must submit a list of chaperones three days before the affair is
to take place. The last three cast dances given by the Dramatic Council
have taken place without the required list having been submitted to Dean
Yost for her approval until the day of the dance.
It is evident that some action had to be taken—either the enforcement
of the rule, or the complete repeal of the provision. The Ex Committee
decided to enforce the rule.
Rough stuff is practically impossible at the University of Minnesota.
The Minnesota Daily declares:
"Six-foot bouncers with high neck sweaters and bulging chests have been
secured to lend entertainment at the annual sophomore frolic which will be
given at the Minnesota Union on February 18. The half-dozen custodians of
law and order were selected after more than 50 students had been culled over.
They will also act as masters of ceremonies at the class dance."
National recognition even on geological survey maps is the urge at
Oregon Agricultural College with the O.A.C. Barometer stating:
"The Tau Beta PI bench marfc in front of Apperson hall will become
an official United States Geological Survey mark if plans discussed yesterday
at a meeting of Tau Beta Pi, national honorary in engineering, are completed.
If a standard U.S.G.S. cap is obtained for the mark it will be listed on all
geological survey maps."
A meeting of all freshmen on the editorial staff will be held today at
