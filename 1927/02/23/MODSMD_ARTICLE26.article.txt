AN OPEN LETTER
Master Jack Jennison,
Class of 1930.
Dear Jack:
When we read your vituperative lit
tle missive the other day we did not
quite know what to think of it. Having
allowed two days to slip by (and don't
they slip by, these early spring days
with the green grass and all the gills
in their new bright clothes). But,
there! there! We're growing good
natured and that would never do.
What we were about to say, Jack,
was that we have concluded that you
are simply intoxicated with the home
product. Your argument never had a
chance to be right because the major
premise upon which you based it was
false in the extreme. You began—
probably sincerely—with the assump
tion that the Memorial Church, con
sidered from an artistic standpoint, is
generally admired. As a matter of fact,
Jack, it represents a bastard form of
architecture, and it has been sub
jected to considerable criticism long

before we ever mentioned it.
You object to our comparing the
church to Barnum's side-shows, and in
the next breath you remark that peo
ple come leagues to see it. Uncon
sciously, Jack, you have practically
admitted the soundness of our ana
logy. It was to attract people in large
numbers and from great distances that
Barnum adopted the type of posters
to which we compared the front eleva
tion of the chapel. The great showman
had little regard for art in his dis-
J plays.
And by the way, Jack, one of the
most famous of these posters, Jack,
advertised a "Horse with his head
where his tail ought to be, and his tail
where his head ought to be."
Yours,
THE BULL SESSION.
And P.S., Jack —
We ARE a bit sorry that we said
anything about the chapel, because,
unlike the customs, ideals, and criti
cisms which you objected to our at
j tacking, nothing can be done about it.
