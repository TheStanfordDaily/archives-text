The Editor. Sir:
I should like to inquire if the motto
of our University is a living, vital
thing, or if it is merely a high-sound
ing empty phrase with which to fool
the all too gullible public. "Let the
winds of freedom blow," it says. But
do they? Let us see.
The dwellers on Olympus have come
to grant to the students of Stanford
many privileges which have to do
with their existence as students. They
have, however, reserved to themselves
the right to lay down the law in mat
ters scholastic. This, of course, in no
wise conflicts with our sense of the
fitness of things. But Olympus has in
vaded the domain of the student body
carrying behind a banner, whereon is
writ in characters large and gaudy.
I the word "Morality." Well and good.
I if the invasion is for the purpose of
! protecting the fair name of Stanford.
| But when the purpose is none other
| than to attack directly and without
mercy both the letter and the spirit
i of our motto, whereby we live and
' from which springs our vitality, we,
the dwellers of the lower regions, may
well ask, "Why?"
Let us call a spade a spade. There
are certain volumes in the catalogue
of the Stanford University library os
tensibly there for student circulation,
which deal with the question of human
or sex relationship One of these books
is a careful scientific analysis of the
problem from a psychological stand
point, by one of the keenest minds of.
the times, an able scholar and author
of note. This volume is withheld from
circulation by an order originating
somewhere on the heights of Olympus.
Men come to Stanford, not for book
knowledge, but to get ideas —ideas
about life, about their work, about
their fellowmen, and above all, about
themselves. "Know thyself." admon
ished the seven sages of ancient
Greece, and the admonition is a splen
did one. The ideas gained here are
put. to work in the world of reality
which awaits the graduatf!"' If they
work, the man succeeds, if they don't,
he gets lost in the shucle.
Knowledge of the facts of life is
knowledge of a most fundamental and
important character. It may be gained
in two ways—from the gutter or from
healthy, scientific treatises on the sub
ject under consideration. The former

| method leaves a life-long scar on a
| man's thought—the latter a life-long
sense of security and composure. Man,
to gain his ideas, must have ready
access to other men's ideas. When
l these are withheld by order of those
whose duty as educators is obvious,
i might we not seriously question their
acts? To withhold ideas on the
grounds of morality raises the ques
tion as to whether the withholders
know what they mean by the word, or
| what a moral situation is. Do the
winds of freedom blow here, or is
there a dead calm?
—John M. Gregory.

The Editor, Sir:
Due to ray unenlightened condition,
I still attend church in the vague be
lief that somewhere exists a greater
power than has heretofore been dis
covered. But I find that this reason
for worship is not up-to-date, "futuris
-1 tic" stimulus for condescending to
| Sunday morning serviced. The Stan
ford University Student of 1927 goes
to admire the flaming mosaics, the
pretty Mother Goose pictures on the
I windows, and the great, shiny lamps
overhead. Hymns (unless jazzed) are
to be scoffed at in the presoice of
! the more attractive diversions to be
found in the edifice itself.
After reading the now-criticized Bull
Session concerning the novelty, I
chuckled gleefully and rushed to en
ithuse over it with certain confreres;
but, to my surprise, only silence and
a profound sense of indignation
reigned. The article had offended
I them. Mr. Jack Jenison's horrified dia
tribe on the masterpiece seems to
represent the current opinion on the
I campus. To me, this is not only fool
ish, but lamentable. Nine-tenths of the
'people of this University have no more
reverence for God than they have for
Clara Bow. Nevertheless, most of them
would go to see the latter in prefer
ence to the former. Moreover, these
people maintain a distinctly angry at
titude toward the Bull Session, whose
taste, in my frank opinion, is not to
be compared with the pitiable "sense
of beauty" of Mrs. Stanford's imported
Italian architects. It seems to me to
be more than an aboration of rever
ence, when the majority of people
nowadays worship the house instead
of God. —Marshall Kirbv.
