"THE GORILLA H UNT"—California
Theatre, Mayfield.
With the rest of humanity we have
twisted in our seat, have sighed, and
have yawned with utmost ennui while
viewing those sleep-inspiring products
of the cinema industry known as trave
logues. But our calloused indifference, *
our customary boredom, was given a
strenuous prod, and we were stimu
lated to a state of wide-awake interest j
last night. We found ourself looking
upon a travelogue that was not a
travelogue; rather might it be called

the pictured record of a splendid Afri
can Odyssey. For such is "The Gorilla
Hunt" now playing at the California
Theatre at Mayfleld.
The expedition passes up the black
waters of the Congo, reaches the last
stand of civilization at Stanleyville,
-<ind then plunges into the depths of
the primordial African hinterland. A
giant, python writhes past the camera.
The long line of natives that carries
the expedition's supplies threads its
way across a shallow river; it is
| threatened by bellowing rhinoceros. J

Snorting crocodiles waddle out of the
way, stimulated by several random
shots from the leaders. A giant bull ;
elephant is shot, as are several lions. 1
The expedition meets with canni
bals, pygmies, and a giant race of
blacks, the descendants of the :
Pharaohs. All the aborigines are pla
cated with gifts of salt and such things 1
as safety pins and colored umbrellas.
Finally the gorilla country is
reached. No beast of the jungle is as
powerful or as dangerous as the J
gorilla. With his gun in one hand and !
the camera crank in the other, the
camera-man photographs the gorillas !
in their native haunt. An enraged
male, after several young are captured, ;
charges down on one of the men. He
stands his ground and waits till the j
brute comes within thirty feet, and ,
'iit?n fires. Sucfl is the Gorilla Hunt, ,
: a picture not to be missed.
