The Rev. Aimee Semple McPherson
toured the night clubs of New York
City the other evening. Presumably
the resultant publicity was aot the
good lady's object.

Texas Guinan, much padlocked
night club hostess, commented: j
"Aimee's religion is a sugar-coated
dose which takes effect."
Texas may not have meant it that 1
way, but we hope to an increasing
number the sugar-coating on Aimee's :
"rc-ligion" is of a distinctly pinkish
cast—or is it blue? And the same
generalization holds for all modifica
tions of McPhersonesque doctrine
down through all its compromises and ,
prettier rationalizations. (Please note: I
we haven't specified the Y.M.C.A.
here.)

It will be interesting to see how
thoroughly the evangelist can re-estab
lish herself in orthodox respectability, j
Aimee and all her antics might well
be relegated to the zoo of curious i
economico-physiologicat perversions.
But millions of people still "take
straight" the "religion" of which i
Aimee is perhaps a sincerely sensa
tional "prophet.

On the principle of majority rule
one proposal is to limit freshman j
jolly-ups exclusively to upperclassmen. |
Still—the sororities have their
A.W.S. get-together, why discriminate j
against the fraternities?

A military board is debating the j
morality of an accusedly amatory (
army chaplain.
Both sides have tacitly agreed that j
neither will refer to the Ten Com
mandments.

For Men Only
As Daves might, tell the Encina
Club, artistic carpentry DOES have
its uses.—V.C.

You noticed of course that "V'ilma
Banky was the cinema heroine of
"The Winning of Barbara Worth,"
Harold Bell Wright's novel of the

American AVest that may have been.
And that Vilma is a native Hungarian.

Mexico City now has a population
of 906,063.
Our State Department finds to its
apparent displeasure that most of
them seem to be Mexicans.

HINTS TO FRESHMEN
Who sometimes write home
for money:

It is planned to raise fifteen million
dollars to "fund the assets" of six
Near-Eastern colleges.
That phrase might come in handy.
