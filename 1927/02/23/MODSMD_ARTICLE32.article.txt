# CHILDREN OF FOREIGN PARENTS DELINQUENT SAYS PSYCHOLOGIST
## 
### 
"Fifty-five per cent of the delin
quency cases handled by the Santa
Clara Juvenile Court deal with chil
dren of foreign-born parents, nearly
h;tlf of whom are Italian," stated Dr.
Maud A. Merrill, County Juvenile
Court psychologist, in an address on
"Psychological Work in Connection
â– with the Juvenile Court" before PI
Lambda Theta Monday afternoon.
Illustrating the relationship between
mental levels and the type of offenses
committed, the speaker declared that
most cases of truancy, vagrancy, and
stealing, concern children of fairly
high mentalities, while sex offenses
and forgery charges are more often
brought against children with lower
I.Q.'s. Approximately one-fourth of the
crimes against chastity are committed
by the feeble-minded.
There are over twice as many boy
offenders as girls the speaker ex
plained. Most of the boy's crimes are
against property while over one-half
of the girls' cases are sex offenses.
Statistics quoted showed the average J
mental level of the boys to be five
points higher than that of the girls.
Environmental influence on delin
quency was evidenced by the fact that
forty-four per cent of the cases cited
came from broken homes. Skilled and
unskilled laborers' families contri
buted the highest percentage.
