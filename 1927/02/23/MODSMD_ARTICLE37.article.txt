# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL SERIES TO OPEN WITH SENIOR-1930 CONTEST
## 
### 
Play in the women's basketball cham
pionship series will begin this afternoon
with a contest between the 1927 and
1930 teams, despite the fact that neither
squad has had a workout for a week,
due to the soaked condition of the out
door courts, which are the only ones
available to the women.
Although the two teams played to a tie
in their practice game, indications are
that the seniors have the better chance
of winning. The recent vacation from
practice increases this chance, as the 1927
women have more experience back of
them not only as individual players but
as a team. They may therefore be ex
pected to get back into form more
quickly than their opponents.
