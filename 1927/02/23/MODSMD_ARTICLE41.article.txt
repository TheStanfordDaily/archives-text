# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, ’16 
Four years ago Lionel Conacher was
a young man in Toronto who ran a
modest cleaning and pressing "em
porium," and, on the side, did well
enough in amateur sports to win the
undisputed title of "Canada's greatest
all-around athlete." If you should gaze
on the iee of Madison Square Garden,
New York, Tex Rickard's sports em
porium, tonight, you will easily see
that Lionel Conacher is still in the
cleaning and pressing business, only
now as a professional ice-hockey play
er. As right defense man of the New
York "Americans," Conacher cleans
out the opposition and presses on to
victory; or, if you prefer, cleans up
his opponents and then presses their
uoses in the ice.
In the first game between the two
New York teams, played on December

26, the mighty Lionel spent nearly ten
minutes in the "hoose-gow" for vari
ous infractions of the rules, one of
them being a five-minute sentence for
engaging in a fist-fight with a rival
player. The referee evidently didn't
want the players doing any late
Christmas socking. Seriously speak
ing, Conacher's playing has been sen
sational since he was traded to New
York for Charley Langlois by the
Pittsburgh Pirates last month. Ru
mors reaching this writer before that
deal, that the big Canuck was stall
ing because he wanted to be traded,
preferably to New York, seem to be
confirmed, because Conacher is now
playing a wonderful game, whereas
his work in a Pittsburgh uniform last
November was mediocre or worse.

But to get back to the other accom

pllshment of the "Big Train," as he
has been dubbed because of his size
and speed. As an amateur in Toronto,
he was a whiz at both baseball and
lacrosse, often starring in a game of
each during one afternoon. In rugby
football, he was without a peer, lead
ing the Argonaut team to numerous
victories and to two Dominion cham
pionships. He had time, besides his
hockey, baseball, and football —and
cleaning and pressing business — to
become an expert wrestler and boxer,
and in the latter sport he was good
enough to win the Canadian amateur
heavyweight title and box an exhibi
tion bout with Jack Dempsey. Before
lie turned pro, Conacher captained the
Pittsburgh amateur hockey team,
"The Yellow Jackets." which won the
national championship.

cleaning and pressing business, only
now as a professional ice-hockey play
er. As right defense man of the New
York "Americans," Conacher cleans
out the opposition and presses on to
victory; or, if you prefer, cleans up
his opponents and then presses their
uoses in the ice.
In the first game between the two
New York teams, played on December

26, the mighty Lionel spent nearly ten
minutes in the "hoose-gow" for vari
ous infractions of the rules, one of
them being a five-minute sentence for
engaging in a fist-fight with a rival
player. The referee evidently didn't
want the players doing any late
Christmas socking. Seriously speak
ing, Conacher's playing has been sen
sational since he was traded to New
York for Charley Langlois by the
Pittsburgh Pirates last month. Ru
mors reaching this writer before that
deal, that the big Canuck was stall
ing because he wanted to be traded,
preferably to New York, seem to be
confirmed, because Conacher is now
playing a wonderful game, whereas
his work in a Pittsburgh uniform last
November was mediocre or worse.

But to get back to the other accom

pllshment of the "Big Train," as he
has been dubbed because of his size
and speed. As an amateur in Toronto,
he was a whiz at both baseball and
lacrosse, often starring in a game of
each during one afternoon. In rugby
football, he was without a peer, lead
ing the Argonaut team to numerous
victories and to two Dominion cham
pionships. He had time, besides his
hockey, baseball, and football —and
cleaning and pressing business — to
become an expert wrestler and boxer,
and in the latter sport he was good
enough to win the Canadian amateur
heavyweight title and box an exhibi
tion bout with Jack Dempsey. Before
lie turned pro, Conacher captained the
Pittsburgh amateur hockey team,
"The Yellow Jackets." which won the
national championship.


Lion-Hearted Lionel
Four years ago Lionel Conacher was
a young man in Toronto who ran a
modest cleaning and pressing "em
porium," and, on the side, did well
enough in amateur sports to win the
undisputed title of "Canada's greatest
all-around athlete." If you should gaze
on the iee of Madison Square Garden,
New York, Tex Rickard's sports em
porium, tonight, you will easily see
that Lionel Conacher is still in the
cleaning and pressing business, only
now as a professional ice-hockey play
er. As right defense man of the New
York "Americans," Conacher cleans
out the opposition and presses on to
victory; or, if you prefer, cleans up
his opponents and then presses their
uoses in the ice.
