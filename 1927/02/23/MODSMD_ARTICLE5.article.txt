# "MORALS" NOT REASON FOR PADLOCKING BOOKS--CLARK

the facts directly from you."
"Curtailing freedom is hardly the way

many 'modern' writers quite commonly
read by college students?" I asked.
"Yes," Librarian Clark replied. "The
American Mercury has not been asked
for by any department. We do, however,
have the books needed for the Univer

"The library cannot, if it would, as
