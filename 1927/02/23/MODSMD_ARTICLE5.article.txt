# "MORALS" NOT REASON FOR PADLOCKING BOOKS--CLARK
## 
### Don Gledhill 
"What the truth about your having
books locked up as improper for students
to read?" 1 asked the quiet, genial execu
tive at his secluded desk. "The idea
seems to have got among the students
that the winds of freedom are being
hushed and the Daily would like to get
the facts directly from you."
"Curtailing freedom is hardly the way
to put it," returned George Thomas
Clark, Director of Stanford Libraries.
"Like all libraries we have some books
whose distribution is guarded. But our
reasons are not primarily moral. We
keep certain volumes locked up because,
well—otherwise they would disappear,
be stolen by those who wanted them
only for purposes of smut. So we neces
sarily protect library property. However,
the books can be secured by any student
with legitimate reason for reading them."

Although known personally to but few
sutdents, the library officials direct what
is perhaps the most used department of
the University. Librarian Clark, of high

national standing in his profession, listed
in "Who's Who," at Stanford since 1907
and formerly iiead of the San Francisco
public library, lias under his administra
tion more than 390,000 volumes.
One factor must always be remem
bered when discussing university libra
ries, Librarian Clark pointed out. They
are designed for reference and research.
Late fiction, novelists of the hour?—no
appropriation for either. And finances
in general—ample but not infinite. Books
and periodicals are ordered only at the
request of some department.

"That explains the rather noticeable
absence of the American Mercury, for
instance, and the scant representation of
many 'modern' writers quite commonly
read by college students?" I asked.
"Yes," Librarian Clark replied. "The
American Mercury has not been asked
for by any department. We do, however,
have the books needed for the Univer
sity's courses in the modern novel.
"The library cannot, if it would, as
sume the functions of a general city
public library. I would like to correct
whatever student misapprehension there
may be on that point. The effort frankly
is to secure in fiction only that which
has or will prove of lasting literary
worth."
Taboo List Given
"To dispel any lingering mystery, may
the Daily print the list of padlocked
books?" the librarian was asked.
"If you think it of any particular in
terest to your readers, we have no ob
jection," Clark replied. For a large
library the list is unusually small. It
contains:
"Arabian Nights," translation by
Burton.
Ellis, H., "Studies in Psychology
of Sex."

Library Large
Although known personally to but few
sutdents, the library officials direct what
is perhaps the most used department of
the University. Librarian Clark, of high

national standing in his profession, listed
in "Who's Who," at Stanford since 1907
and formerly iiead of the San Francisco
public library, lias under his administra
tion more than 390,000 volumes.
One factor must always be remem
bered when discussing university libra
ries, Librarian Clark pointed out. They
are designed for reference and research.
Late fiction, novelists of the hour?—no
appropriation for either. And finances
in general—ample but not infinite. Books
and periodicals are ordered only at the
request of some department.
'Meccury" Absent
"That explains the rather noticeable
absence of the American Mercury, for
instance, and the scant representation of
many 'modern' writers quite commonly
read by college students?" I asked.
"Yes," Librarian Clark replied. "The
American Mercury has not been asked
for by any department. We do, however,
have the books needed for the Univer
sity's courses in the modern novel.
"The library cannot, if it would, as
sume the functions of a general city
public library. I would like to correct
whatever student misapprehension there
may be on that point. The effort frankly
is to secure in fiction only that which
has or will prove of lasting literary
worth."
Taboo List Given
"To dispel any lingering mystery, may
the Daily print the list of padlocked
books?" the librarian was asked.
"If you think it of any particular in
terest to your readers, we have no ob
jection," Clark replied. For a large
library the list is unusually small. It
contains:
"Arabian Nights," translation by
Burton.
Ellis, H., "Studies in Psychology
of Sex."
The following Stanford dissertations
hidden at the request of the Graduate
Study Committee for the reason that
they contain confidential information ob
tained under a pledge that it would not
be published :
"What the truth about your having
books locked up as improper for students
to read?" 1 asked the quiet, genial execu
tive at his secluded desk. "The idea
seems to have got among the students
that the winds of freedom are being
hushed and the Daily would like to get
the facts directly from you."
"Curtailing freedom is hardly the way
to put it," returned George Thomas
Clark, Director of Stanford Libraries.
"Like all libraries we have some books
whose distribution is guarded. But our
reasons are not primarily moral. We
keep certain volumes locked up because,
well—otherwise they would disappear,
be stolen by those who wanted them
only for purposes of smut. So we neces
sarily protect library property. However,
the books can be secured by any student
with legitimate reason for reading them."
