# LACK OF CONTROL BY EX COMMITTEE CHIEF PUBLICATION PROBLEM
## Council Method Criticized As Tending-to Bring Decentralization 
### 
Lack of Executive Committee con
trol was the only objection offered by
the Constitution Committee at its
meeting Friday to the Publications
Council method of running publica
tions as outlined in the plan submit
ted by the journalists last week.
Recommending control of the Execu
tive Committee over such a council
by 6 out of 8 votes with no power
over editorial policies of publications,
the revision committee appointed a
sub-committee of three members to
confer with the journalists with the
object of reaching some agreement as
to such control. Wilbur Adams was
appointed chairman of the committee,
which also includes Lucia Champlin
and John C. Duniway. It is scheduled
to meet with the journalists at 12
o'clock Thursday.
Separation Decried
It was the concensus of opinion of
the committee that separation of the
publications from Executive Commit
tee control would tend to decentralize
student government and weaken it,
despite the assurance of J. E. Mc-
Dowell that the original plan was
sane, sensible, and safe. To insure
editorial freedom, which was the main
argument, in favor of limiting Execu
tive Committee control, the 6 to 8 vote
to either initiate'any measures or veto
any actions of the Publications Coun
cil was suggested.
The committee will consider at its
next meeting at 12:45 o'clock Friday
the recommendation of the sub-com
mittee in reference to publications,
and make its decision accordingly.
Treasurer Law Changed
With the object of eliminating con
fusion as to class funds, it was de
cided that the treasurer of each class
be elected at the spring election to
serve for one full year, instead of
twice a year, as is now the custom.
The initiation of any organizations
on the campus which receives from
student members any assessments
whatsoever, including living groups,
dormitories, and honorary societies,
was prohibited without Ihe permission
of the Executive Committee.

The question of placing women's
debating under the jurisdiction of the
Debate Council was taken up, but ac
tion was deferred until further con
sultation with the debate coach.
