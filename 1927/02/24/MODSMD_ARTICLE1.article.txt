In "Princess Ida," Gilbert and Sulli
van's opera which is to be given Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall, ap
pear all the qualities of melody,
rhythm, and humor that gained the
works of the authors their popularity.
Tickets for the production are still
on sale at the Old Union from 1 to 5
o'clock each afternoon and at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto.
Snappy Rehearsals
At last night's rehearsal of the
opera the piece went off with snap
and precision. The chorus, under the
direction of Frances Boone, executed
its steps well, and the principles ap
peared to advantage in their parts.
Winifred Estabrook, singing the
title role, and Alonzo Cass, who takes
the part of King Gama, bid fair to
make their interpretations of the
parts effective, as do Messrs. Cullin,
Holmes, and Reed, who play the parts
of King Gama's sons.
Noted Authors
Gilbert and Sullivan were both fa
mous before they began collaborating,
Gilbert as a playwright and Sullivan
as a composer of sacred music. Neither
of the men, however, had achieved
any fame equal to that which they
later enjoyed.
Gilbert wrote the words to all the
operas which the two wrote, Sullivan
later fitting the music to them. The
work of the pair makes a perfect com
bination, the music suggesting the
sense of the words in many numbers.
This characteristic of the authors'
works is particularly noticeable in
"Princess Ida," especially in several
of the songs sung by King Gama.
Fight Over Trifle
A strange thing about Gilbert and
Sullivan's close partnership was the
suddenness with which it ended over
a disagreement brought on by a strip
of carpet which the stage manager
bought. Gilbert thought this a piece of
extravagance while Sullivan sided
â– with the man, and the combination
was broken.
Sullivan was popular in the London
society of his time, but Gilbert's caus
tic wit made him disliked.
