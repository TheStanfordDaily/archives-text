# MEMBERS FOR PROM COMMITTEE SELECTED BY JUNIOR PRESIDENT
## 
### 
In order that members of the Junior
Prom committee will not be bothered
with the details of financing and book
keeping, Harry Call was appointed class
business manager at a Junior meeting
yesterday. He will have complete
charge of the financial side of the
Prom, and will thus allow the other
members of the committee to devote
all of their time to other features of
the dance. His appointment has been
confirmed by Bob Lewis, student mana
ger.

Claude C. Conn was made chairman
of the Prom committee and will have
in charge of sub-committees under him
the following men: Music, Dick YVor

Tickets, Cy Farewell; Chaperones,
Margaret Carrithers; Cops, Chris Free
man; Janitors, Jim Purcell.
Ernest Patchett was appointed to
the position of Athletic Manager and
will have charge of all the Junior class
athletic teams for the remainder of the
year.
Dues Held Up
The question of the amount of dues
to be collected was put over for a week,
as the committee appointed to investi
gate this situation had not come to a
decision.
