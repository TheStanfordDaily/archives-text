# CARDS TO HOLD FINAL PRACTICE THIS AFTERNOON
## Biaggini at New Position of Running Guard to Add Strength to Team FAST SCRIMMAGE HELD Basketball Squad Stresses Goal Tries, Passing, Floor Plays 
### Merle Emry 
Since only one more practice re
mains before the Stanford and Cali
fornia basketball teams clash in the
pavilion Saturday night, the Cardinal
squad will place extra emphasis on
basket-shooting, drills on floor plays,
and passing the ball exercises this
afternoon.
Poor Shooting
Inaccuracy in hitting the basket was
the outstanding error brought out in
yesterday's scrimmage. A team com
posed of Bryant and McCandless, for
wards, Jayred, center, and Biaggini
and Anderson, guards, made two tal
lies out of forty-seven tries in the first
twenty minutes of scrimmage. This is
more tries at the goal than Stanford
received during the entire playing
period of the opening game with Cali
fornia.
The Cardinal mentors have worked
up an almost air-tight defense. The
clever and fast playing of.a scrimmage
squad consisting of Sibbett and Crary,
at forward positions, Sission, center,
and Thompson and Kable, guards, was
of uo avail against the five-man zone
defense which the varsity will form
against the Bear five. Biaggini, at his
new position on the team as running
guard, adds materially to the strength
of Stanford's goal-protecting forma
tion.
New Plays
If Jayred can again outjump Corbin,
at California's pivot position, the
Cardinals will get the advantage of the
tip-off plays, giving them a better
chance to score before the California
man-to-man defense can form. Several
new plays on the opening jump have
been formulated into the Hunt playing
system.
Passing the ball instead of dribbling
is one big improvement that has been
made in this week's practices. With
emphasis placed on follow-up shots
and a fast, rushing offense, the Cardi
nals present a better balanced team
than the one that tasted defeat last
week.
