### 
In a letter sent to Hon. Herbert C.
Jones,, state senator, yesterday, Dr.
Jordan stated his objections to the
Syndicalism Act of California. "I wish
to place on record my belief," said Dr.
Jordan, "that few acts of the Assem
bly of California have done so much
injury to the good name of the State
as the so-called Syndicalism Act, an
amendment to which, known as the
Fellom Bill, is now before the Legis
lature."
Dr. Jordan stated his approval of
the Fellom Bill. "Moreover the admin
istration has proven in many cases
unjust and unfair. The evils against
which it is supposed to be directed
can be adequately met by ordinary
process of law. I am assured that these
points are fairly well met by the
Fellom Bill, which on that account
I favor."
