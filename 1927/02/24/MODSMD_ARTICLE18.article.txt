# WOMEN MAY NOT HAVE TO REPEAT LAKE TEST
## 
### 
Possibility that women who have passed
the Lagunita swimming test will not
have to take it over this year was indi
cated by Mrs. Ernest Brandsten, women's
swimming coach, yesterday. The question
will be decided in a few days.
One hundred and two men have passed
the swimming test at the Encina pool. Of
this number, sixty-two had taken the test
on previous years, the rest taking it for
the time. Few of the men who tried
the test failed to complete it successfully.
