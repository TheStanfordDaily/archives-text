# VARSITY TRACK TEAM TO RECEIVE WORKOUT IN INTERCLASS MEET
## Events Will Be Held Friday And Saturday Providing Rain Lets Up 
### Joe Carroll 
If the rain stops long enough so
that the Interclass Track Meet can
be held this Friday and Saturday as
scheduled, the Stanford University
track team will swing into action to
morrow officially for the first time this
year. Some idea of the strength of the
Cardinal squad will be obtained from
the showings that will be made.
Real Problem
Track presents a real problem.
Coach Dink Templeton has a well-bal
anced field team, but lacks material in
some of the running events, especially
in the distances.
Congo Carlsmith, half-miler, will
graduate at the end of this quarter.
He is a law student, and must gradu
ate to get the law courses that he
needs. Moss and McKinnon, sopho
mores, are expected to take over his
work in the 880'.
Ted Criley, two-miler, has not worked
out for the past week or so, as he has
a pulled tendon. Much of Stanford's
showing in this event will fall upon
Ted's shoulders.

Irish Marathon
There will be a track manager on
the old oval every afternoon, 3:30 to
5:30, to time anyone that should de
sire to try out for the Irish Marathon.
If the rain stops long enough so
that the Interclass Track Meet can
be held this Friday and Saturday as
scheduled, the Stanford University
track team will swing into action to
morrow officially for the first time this
year. Some idea of the strength of the
Cardinal squad will be obtained from
the showings that will be made.
Real Problem
Track presents a real problem.
Coach Dink Templeton has a well-bal
anced field team, but lacks material in
some of the running events, especially
in the distances.
Congo Carlsmith, half-miler, will
graduate at the end of this quarter.
He is a law student, and must gradu
ate to get the law courses that he
needs. Moss and McKinnon, sopho
mores, are expected to take over his
work in the 880'.
Ted Criley, two-miler, has not worked
out for the past week or so, as he has
a pulled tendon. Much of Stanford's
showing in this event will fall upon
Ted's shoulders.
