Ted Krough was elected president
of the Sophomore Class at the special
election yesterday, polling 126 votes
I to 83 for Joe Carroll. John B. Wheatley
{is the new vice-president, Ruth Lans
burg was elected secretary, and
j Frederic N*. Clark won the election for
j treasurer.
i Anne Hartwell polled the highest
| number of votes for vice-president of
! the Junior Class.
The race for Sophomore Class of
ficers, with the exception of that of
president, was hotly contested. Clark
; had a plurality of only five votes over
I Craig for 1929 treasurer. The eight
j sophomore ballots cast out because
they were marked other than in ink,
jor contained additional embellish*
I ments, happened to be for Craig.
Only twenty-two junior women voted,
at the election. Thirty sophomore wo
men cast their ballots for president,
while nineteen voted for the other
j class offices. Four men and four wo-
I men erred in submitting 1929 ballots
j with faulty marking, while of the five
bad junior ballots four were cast by
| the women.
