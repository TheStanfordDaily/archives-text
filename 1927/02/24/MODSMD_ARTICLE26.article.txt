# It's Your Fault

In that ancient time when Eve grabbed the fatal apple that caused
her and Adam s fall from the Garden, it was thus that he probably chided
her. And since then, through the ages, whenever anything has happened,
man has shifted the blame onto woman. Now comes a Syracuse Uni
versity professor of sociology, John C. Duvall by name, who foresees the
"Fall of America"â€”caused by woman, of course.
The brains of Stanford should tremble at these august words, for
Professor Duvall believes that the fall of woman will lead to the fall
of America, and woman's fall is being caused by the lowly cigarette.
.The professor said, in the Syracuse Daily Orange, "1 he college girl's
smoking, and the free way in which she carries herself and acts, are
indicative of a mannerism which sooner or later all girls will acquire, and
which will inevitably result in what future historians will term the 'Fall
of America.' "
Ihe professor philosophized: "Woman was always loved and re
spected by civilized man for her gentility. Love is fundamentally begot
by the realization of the great difference, physically and mentally, between
male and female."
He accounted for the change of woman from her former place by
explaining that the industrial revolution wrought such great changes in
industry as to permit a woman to do work equal to man's by merely
pressing a lever or pushing a button. Thus it was inevitable, in realizing
that she was man's equal in business, that woman tried to become the
equal of man in other functions of life.
i rofessor Duvall predicts the "Fall of America" rather than the
improvement of America due tq the fact that "man has advanced to his
present high rung on the ladder of civilization not because he was solely
interested in accomplishing great things for the sake of accomplishing
them, but because he was inspired and encouraged by a woman.
"Hence, now that woman has risen from an inferior position in man's
eyes, bv dint of hard labor, and has approached his level, the man refuses
to tolerate it. Man's difference from woman is such an age-old axiom
that, to eradicate this firmly imbedded belief, mountains must be moved."
This strong feminist movement, carrying with it the believe that woman
is the equal of man, hence he cannot boss her, quickly leads to strife and
discontent, the professor contended, because the home discipline is dis
organized.
But hope is not lost to America. The professor kindly gave a remedy
for the miserable situation. He said: "One should start off with one's
own family and try to strengthen it. For, as you know, the criterion of
a nation's strength is determined by that nation's ability to survive. And
the family's strength determines largely the nation's chances of survival.
If the family disintegrates, the strength of the nation is materially af
fected, and if the family is strengthened, the nation has a firmer foun
dation."
