"The Queen of Spain Has No Legs!"
News dispatches, if correct, indicate
that however questionable may be the
politics centering about the University of
Washington, the faculty committee on
student affairs there is animated by a
psychology which in some dim future
the child of eleven will scorn.
Aij allegedly "in poor taste" humorous
article on the life of Abraham Lincoln
appearing in the February number of
"Columns." University of Washington,
has resulted in the suspension of the
magazine and disciplining of the' editors.
Lacking more details, an observer ac
quainted with how universities are run
(particularly tax-supported institutions)
might safely guess that some literate
member of the Washington legislature is
today preening himself as a defender of
Lincoln in consequence of getting the
magazine suppressed. The other alterna
tive is that the reactionaries character
istically chosen on committees for stu
dent affairs are basking in the congratu
lation of like minded friends doubly bliss
ful with the consciousness of militant
patriotism and the satisfaction of keep
ing the university safe for asking future
appropriations.

j It is not improbable that the Lincoln
j article was in poor taste. Irritated un
j dergraduates with thought power run
i ning mainly to steani often do rush un
wisely into print. But if tolerance and
more mature intelligence be not entirely
lacking in Washington U. there is no
defense for suppressing the magazine
I regardless of what can conceivably have
been said. Highly debatable questions of
taste must not he the criterion of censor
ship if a free press is to help the world
muddle through the dark ages.
It is no more wrong, unpatriotic, sacri
legious or even "bad taste" to say that
Lincoln habitually told stories that would
send a modern W.C.T.U. into pious
fits than to say that among other activi
] ties, John Doe patronizes Pullman smok
ers. Nor has it any more significance.
Not until we bring our great men out
I of the gilt mist of hero worship which
auras each as a sanctified personification
Jof the stuffier Sunday School virtues
will history take its place as a rational
science instead of fiction overburdened
with falsely deduced morals, in oversen
sitive defense of which such things as
suppressing magazines can happen.—D. G.

j It is not improbable that the Lincoln
j article was in poor taste. Irritated un
j dergraduates with thought power run
i ning mainly to steani often do rush un
wisely into print. But if tolerance and
more mature intelligence be not entirely
lacking in Washington U. there is no
defense for suppressing the magazine
I regardless of what can conceivably have
been said. Highly debatable questions of
taste must not he the criterion of censor
ship if a free press is to help the world
muddle through the dark ages.
It is no more wrong, unpatriotic, sacri
legious or even "bad taste" to say that
Lincoln habitually told stories that would
send a modern W.C.T.U. into pious
fits than to say that among other activi
] ties, John Doe patronizes Pullman smok
ers. Nor has it any more significance.
Not until we bring our great men out
I of the gilt mist of hero worship which
auras each as a sanctified personification
Jof the stuffier Sunday School virtues
will history take its place as a rational
science instead of fiction overburdened
with falsely deduced morals, in oversen
sitive defense of which such things as
suppressing magazines can happen.—D. G.
