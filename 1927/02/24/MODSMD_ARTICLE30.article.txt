The Editor, Sir:
That's the old Stanford spirit. Fancy
a cow college presuming to ban a red
sweater from its campus. It is provok
ing to have to mingle at all with people
who can qualify for entrance into noth
ing but a cow college. Fancy that!
They all probably tried to enter Stan
ford but couldn't matriculate because
of the high entrance requirements. Well,
never mind, Stanford; if you are satis
fied with the results of very strict and
snobby policies, you are welcome. How
ever, it has been the conclusion of at
least one observer that only those who
finally "great mind" themselves into
regular standing at Stanford, WOULD
wear a red sweater anyhow. However,
there is probably a chance for someone

] to pick up a cheap red sweater if they
will take a trip up to the Davis farm.
Times don't change much. It is the
| same old Stanford. Your editors show
| they are full of the same old line as
before. When will Stanford begin to
J turn out men worthy of being referred
to as graduates of an university? Jews,
I yokels, and others will no doubt con
j tinue to apply for entrance in sufficient
I numbers to warrant a continuance of the
J real "Stanford spirit." Limitations in
1 your charter as tx> the number of en
j rolled students will still serve as dunce
| bait. For heaven's sake do not let it
! get around about the limitations in your
| curricula or the limitations in your pro
| ducts. Here's to a greater Stanford
! Teachers College!
