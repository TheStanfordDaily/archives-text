# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
To see A1 Miller for the first time
in a track suit, you'd think he was a
sliot-putter or a hammer-thrower. For
A1 has the heavy flanks and bulging
calves that are usually associated
with weight-heavers, piano-movers and
circus strong men, and ntf one who did
7101 know his history would possibly
accuse him of being a sprinter. Yet
that is exactly what A1 is at this time
of year, and, what is more, he sprints
well enough to be looked upon, not
only as a winner in the indoor inter
collegiat.es early next month, but in
the IC4A outdoor games as well, and
as an Olympic contender in 1928 at
Amsterdam.

"When the 200-pound Harvard sprint
er came in ahead of Bob McAllister
land Hunk Russell in the 60-yard dash
at the Millrose Games in New York
last month, "Old Man Dope" received
'something of a shock, but when, later
lon in the evening, A1 came back to de
feat Frank Hussey and Bob McAllister
in the 50-yard final, the aforemen
tioned dope was completely upset,
j trampled on, and mutilated beyond
1 recognition.
Miller came back three nights later
iin the invitation 40-yard dash at the
Boston A.A. meet to defeat Frank
Hussey once more and to add to his
claim to the title of indoor dash king
of the year. A1 will now be a prime
favorite to win the Intercollegiate 60-
yard dash title, which championship
he held in 1925, but lost by a few
inches to Hank Russell in 1926.
A1 Miller, you know, is the same
chap who, Wynant Hubbard claims,
! received such a sock in the nose in a
Harvard-Princeton football game that
I the imprint of a signet ring was left
I for some time on his proboscis. Much
has been written about why A1 failed
to become a great football player be
cause he could only run as a sprinter
runs, and because he unconsciously
favored his legs when tackled. Be that
las it may, A1 is a most remarkable
I runner for a man so heavy, and ranks
j right up among other 200>-pounders
like "Germany" Schulz, Jim Jeffries,
j Frank Gotcli, Babe Ruth, and Earl
I Thompson, as far as being both big
! and fast is concerned.

To see A1 Miller for the first time
in a track suit, you'd think he was a
sliot-putter or a hammer-thrower. For
A1 has the heavy flanks and bulging
calves that are usually associated
with weight-heavers, piano-movers and
circus strong men, and ntf one who did
7101 know his history would possibly
accuse him of being a sprinter. Yet
that is exactly what A1 is at this time
of year, and, what is more, he sprints
well enough to be looked upon, not
only as a winner in the indoor inter
collegiat.es early next month, but in
the IC4A outdoor games as well, and
as an Olympic contender in 1928 at
Amsterdam.

"When the 200-pound Harvard sprint
er came in ahead of Bob McAllister
land Hunk Russell in the 60-yard dash
at the Millrose Games in New York
last month, "Old Man Dope" received
'something of a shock, but when, later
lon in the evening, A1 came back to de
feat Frank Hussey and Bob McAllister
in the 50-yard final, the aforemen
tioned dope was completely upset,
j trampled on, and mutilated beyond
1 recognition.
Miller came back three nights later
iin the invitation 40-yard dash at the
Boston A.A. meet to defeat Frank
Hussey once more and to add to his
claim to the title of indoor dash king
of the year. A1 will now be a prime
favorite to win the Intercollegiate 60-
yard dash title, which championship
he held in 1925, but lost by a few
inches to Hank Russell in 1926.
A1 Miller, you know, is the same
chap who, Wynant Hubbard claims,

Harvard-Princeton football game that
I the imprint of a signet ring was left
I for some time on his proboscis. Much
