### 
The Breakers and the Sigma Chi
fives qualified yesterday for the final
game in the intramural play-off for the
championship. The Breakers won their
place by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma
in the semi-finals 15 to 12, while
Sigma Chi advanced to the last round

Fast Floor Work
Playing a fast floor game, especially
in the last half, and quick to take ad
vantage of the breaks, the Breakers
won their game in spite of the clever
offense of the Phi Kaps. Long shots
featured the first minut»s of the game,
but as both teams realized that only
short throws would have any effect,
the forwards tried working the ball up
to the basket. The passing at first was
poor, with nearly everyone missing
throws. Both teams showed a defense
that was decidedly superior to the
offense.
George of the Breakers started the
scoring with a basket from the side;
Cook, who tied with Saunders of the
Phi Kaps for high-point man, followed
with another. The half ended 7 to 5
in favor of the Breakers.
Phi Kaps Threaten
The second half showed an improve
ment in the playing of both teams.
Saunders found the range of the bas
ket, as did Harlow of the clubmen.
Both George and Cook for the winners |
and McCulloch and Evans tightened ,
up on their playing. With but a few i
minuts to play in the last half, the
Phi Kaps came to within one point of j
the Breakers, but lost out both times, i
Making all but one of their tallies in ,
the first half, Sigma Chi barely man- J
aged to sneak a victory over the j
Indians 10 to 9. Telonicher, stellar
Indian guard, nearly ruined the fra
ternity lead time and again, but he
could not sink his shots from the mid- j
die of the floor. 1
Sigma Chis Win
On defense formation, both teams !
were unexcelled, Bowers being held to (
two field goals, and Telonicher to two.
Brady, Farmer, and Bowers formed a
combination that was hard to stop on
its crashing attacks through the Indian
defense. On the other hand, Telonicher
as pivot man for the losers constantly
passed the ball to his forwards, who
could not find the basket.
Sigma Chi led at half time 9 to 5.
In the middle of the second period
Tulley brought the score to 10 to 7,
and Telonicher raised it to 10 to 9.
With four minutes to play the Indians
had two chances to tie the score with
fouls, but fell through each time. For
the rest of the period, the ball was
thrown from one corner of the floor to
the other without any result, the game
ending with Sigma Chi one point
ahead.

throws. Both teams showed a defense
that was decidedly superior to the
offense.
George of the Breakers started the
scoring with a basket from the side;
Cook, who tied with Saunders of the
Phi Kaps for high-point man, followed
with another. The half ended 7 to 5
in favor of the Breakers.
Phi Kaps Threaten
The second half showed an improve
ment in the playing of both teams.
Saunders found the range of the bas
ket, as did Harlow of the clubmen.
Both George and Cook for the winners |
and McCulloch and Evans tightened ,
up on their playing. With but a few i
minuts to play in the last half, the
Phi Kaps came to within one point of j
the Breakers, but lost out both times, i
Making all but one of their tallies in ,
the first half, Sigma Chi barely man- J
aged to sneak a victory over the j
Indians 10 to 9. Telonicher, stellar
Indian guard, nearly ruined the fra
ternity lead time and again, but he
could not sink his shots from the mid- j
die of the floor. 1
Sigma Chis Win
On defense formation, both teams !
were unexcelled, Bowers being held to (
two field goals, and Telonicher to two.
Brady, Farmer, and Bowers formed a
combination that was hard to stop on
its crashing attacks through the Indian
defense. On the other hand, Telonicher
as pivot man for the losers constantly
passed the ball to his forwards, who
could not find the basket.
Sigma Chi led at half time 9 to 5.
In the middle of the second period
Tulley brought the score to 10 to 7,
and Telonicher raised it to 10 to 9.
With four minutes to play the Indians
had two chances to tie the score with
fouls, but fell through each time. For
the rest of the period, the ball was
thrown from one corner of the floor to
the other without any result, the game
ending with Sigma Chi one point
ahead.
The Breakers and the Sigma Chi
fives qualified yesterday for the final
game in the intramural play-off for the
championship. The Breakers won their
place by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma
in the semi-finals 15 to 12, while
Sigma Chi advanced to the last round
with a one-point victory over the
Indians, 10-9.
Fast Floor Work
Playing a fast floor game, especially
in the last half, and quick to take ad
vantage of the breaks, the Breakers
won their game in spite of the clever
offense of the Phi Kaps. Long shots
featured the first minut»s of the game,
but as both teams realized that only
short throws would have any effect,
the forwards tried working the ball up
to the basket. The passing at first was
poor, with nearly everyone missing
throws. Both teams showed a defense
that was decidedly superior to the
offense.
