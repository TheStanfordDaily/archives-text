### 
The Breakers and the Sigma Chi
fives qualified yesterday for the final
game in the intramural play-off for the
championship. The Breakers won their
place by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma
in the semi-finals 15 to 12, while
Sigma Chi advanced to the last round
with a one-point victory over the
Indians, 10-9.
Fast Floor Work
Playing a fast floor game, especially
in the last half, and quick to take ad
vantage of the breaks, the Breakers
won their game in spite of the clever
offense of the Phi Kaps. Long shots
featured the first minut»s of the game,
but as both teams realized that only
short throws would have any effect,
the forwards tried working the ball up
to the basket. The passing at first was
poor, with nearly everyone missing
throws. Both teams showed a defense
that was decidedly superior to the
offense.
George of the Breakers started the
scoring with a basket from the side;
Cook, who tied with Saunders of the
Phi Kaps for high-point man, followed
with another. The half ended 7 to 5
in favor of the Breakers.
Phi Kaps Threaten
The second half showed an improve
ment in the playing of both teams.
Saunders found the range of the bas
ket, as did Harlow of the clubmen.
