# CARD NINE PREPARES FOR RETURN CONTEST WITH SAINTS' SQUAD
## 
### 
While the majority of the Stanford
varsity baseball team took a day off
yesterday afternoon, Coach Harry
Wolter had his pitchers and catchers
out for a workout on the practice field.
Following the game with St. Mary's
last Saturday, Wolter has been drilling
his moundsmen to prevent another
batting rampage by the Saints in the
return game scheduled for this Satur
day afternoon on the local diamond.
The showing made by Sobieski and
Riese in the first game with St. Mary's
was not impressive, Bob Philippi dis
playing the only class of the afternoon
in finishing .the game for the Cardi
nals. As a result, the choice of the
starting battery this week lies be
tween Philippi and Captain Steve Col
lins, with the latter holding a slight
advantage.
Sypher Scrappiest
Cook Sypher will again hold up the
receiving end of the battery, having
earned his place as the scrappiest man
on the squad this year. MaguirÂ» has
practically cinched a place at first
base, Garibaldi will start at second,
and Busch at shortstop. Third base
still remains a matter for conjecture,
with neither Harris nor Adams per
forming very well.
Left field is still the unchallenged
territory of Stewart, with Wilton play
ing center field, and Nissen at right
field. This lineup seems fairly well set
tled thus far this season, and with
regular practice sessions scheduled as
soon as the playing field is in condi
tion, Coach Wolter should turn in
many more victories in the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Association.
