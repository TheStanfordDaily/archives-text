# NEW WAR ANGLE IN FANTASTIC PLOT OF ENGLISH CLUB PLAY
## "Kiss For Cinderella" Good Vehicle for Whimsical Style of Barrie 
### Anne Waldron 
Since 1927 is far enough removed!
from 1911 to get a realistic slant on
the World War, it is interesting to
compare the -fantastic war story of j
J. M. Barrie's "A Kiss for Cinderella." I
English Club play to be given next!
Friday in the Assembly Hall, to the
stark realism of such recent war plays
as "What Price Glory."
Both the famous Barrie pathos and j
whimsicality are combined in this play i
dealing with a slum child in London
who adopted war orphans and kept
them in little board cribs on the wall
of her room, all the time fearing ar
rest since one of them was a German
child.
"A Kiss for Cinderella" was first
produced in London in 1915 with Maud !
Adams in the leading role. She dupli- i
cated her English success on a tri-!
umphant tour of America, rivalling her 1
success in "Peter Pan."
As in all of Barries plays, we find j
in the drama a great use of the wit I
of situation rather than the wit of
words. He has grasped to the full the j
principle that his characters can be'
humorous even when they do not
speak, and has utilized it in the parade
of the beauties and the actions of the
king and queen in the dream ball of
the second act.
Of all the modern English play
wrights, the man Barrie is probably the j
least known. He has been prolific both
in the theatre and the novel, but he
has hidden himself behind a mask of
whimsicality which few besides his
own personal friends have been able
to penetrate. Very little is known of
his life and actions save that he came
from a small town in Scotland, the
original of the Thrums of his novels,;
and through his novels and his plays i
he has achieved a baronetcy. He has '
never lent himself to the bitter pub- j
iicity of George Bernard Shaw or the j
tragic propaganda of John Galsworthy, !
but has remained aloof, remote in his
Never-never land.
