# STRENGTHENED CARD CAGE TEAM FACES BEARS IN CRUCIAL GAME
## Biaggini Selected to Start Contest in Running Guard Position OFFENSE IS PERFECTED Game May Determine Team Competing in Pacific Coast Finals 
### 
Tomorrow night when the Stanford
I varsity basketball squad swings into ac
tion in the pavilion at 8 o'clock, a team
handicapped by one defeat but one that
has strengthened its entire playing sys
tem will vie with University of Cali
fornia cagemen for the second game of
the championship series.
If the Cardinals win, they will have
earned the right to meet the Bears in a
third contest to decide who shall go north
to represent the southern division in the
linals of the Pacific Coast Conference
championship. If they lose, California
will compete for championship honors.
One move that should give Stanford
more defense power is the placing of
Biaggini in the running guard berth. The
other four positions will be filled by the
same men that faced the Bears in the
first contest of the series.
Lineup
The line-up is announced as:
Stanford California
Bryant F Watson (C)
McCandless F R. Dougery
Jayred C Corbin
Biaggini G J. Dougery
Anderson G Dixon
For reserve power Coach Husky Hunt
will have Vincenti, Christ, Lewis, Dob
son, and Crarv. These men have been
going good on offensive plays and will
jump at the chance to get in the game
against the Bears.
Anderson has acquired a deadly ac
curacy in hitting the basket. In practice
yesterday afternoon he tallied twenty-two
out of twenty-three tries for goal.
By their shooting drills in yesterday;
afternoon's practice, other Cardinals
showed accurate ability in sinking the
ball and have polished their ossing for
goals down to a fine point.

Price Works Defense

Coach Nibs Price's highly organized
machine has been placing special empha
sis on defensive work during last week's
practice, indicating fear of Stanford's
offense. These fears are not overesti
mated, as Hunt's system of passing the
hall down the far court worked effec
tively against California last week and
with the extra amount of practice, the
Bears will have plenty to do in breaking
up the rushing offense of the Cards.
Conditions will be reversed for the
Hears tomorrow night. They will be
playing on the home floor of the Cardi
nals and facing an enemy audience. This
together with the noticeable improvement
of the Stanford players makes the out
come more or less of a toss-up.
