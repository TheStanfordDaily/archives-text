to the occasion as Founders' Day, the plu

■ land Stanford, Junior, although officially
' it was written "Founder's Day" up until
I several years after Mrs. Stanford's death
i in 1905 when the title was officially plural
| ized and the services of the day recognized
as in honor of both of the founders of the
! University.
