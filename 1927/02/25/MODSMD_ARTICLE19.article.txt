# UNIVERSITY HONORS STANFORDS YEARLY ON FOUNDERS' DAY
## 
### 
Founders' Day, March 9, which is Sena-
tor Stanford's birthday, has been observed
with a program every year at Stanford
University since the first celebration in
1894, on the first March 9 after Senator
Stanford's death, June 21, 1893. He was
born in 1824.
The character of these Founders' Day
programs has changed with time, but the
spirit prompting them has remained the
same. The first program took place in the
Encina gymnasium and was attended by
Mrs. Stanford. The services, at her re
quest, were for both Senator Stanford
and Leland Stanford, Junior, and the
program printed for the day as well as the
stories in the Daily Palo Alto referred
to the occasion as Founders' Day, the plu
ral of the word being used to include Le
land Stanford, Junior, although officially
it was written "Founder's Day" up until
several years after Mrs. Stanford's death
i in 1905 when the title was officially plural
ized and the services of the day recognized
as in honor of both of the founders of the
University.
