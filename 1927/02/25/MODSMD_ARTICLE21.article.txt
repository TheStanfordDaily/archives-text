# Another Big Game
## 
### 
Once again the Bear season is open. For the convenience of the
Cardinal hunters, the bear will be routed out of the Berkeley woods, and
will be scared down into the open of the basketball pavilion at Stanford
tomorrow night.
Psychologists tell us that.there are two main effects of defeat. One
of these effects disheartens the vanquished, while the other inspires the
loser to tight back. Jhe Stanford basketball quintet has been showing
signs of the latter type of reaction since its defeat at the hands of the
California five last Friday night. An attitude of dogged determination
has been evident in the complete Stanford squad this week.
Ihe psychologists also let us in on some more inside dope. They
claim that the effect of victory is usually to make the winners over
confident, and not quite up to form. These men of science may be trying
to fool us, but their reasoning sounds rather good, and also quite rea
sonable.
A match with California, in any sport, brings with it that spirit of
keen rivalry and interest that forces the players to exert themselves to
the utmost primarily to bring victory to their college, and secondarily to
win glory for themselves. The two teams point for each other from the
first day of practice, and when the Big Games are played there is a
natural relapse even when a coast championship or a national title is
at stake.
The rivalry not only extends to the members of the teams, but is also
evident in the coaches, in the rooters, and in the universities themselves.
Tomorrow night Coachs Price and Hunt are facing each other in the
same capacity as are the representatives of the teams. The game means
as much to them as it does to the centers, the forwards, or the guards on
the two quintets. With numerous coast championships to his credit, Price
has already made his reputation in the basketball world. Hunt is just
making his in the realm of varsity sports, this being his first season as
head coach.
Probably the outcome of the game means as much to the loyal sup
porters of the two institutions as it does to either the coaches or the
teams. To the teams there is the pleasure of playing the contests —win or
lose. To the coaches there is the pleasure of watching their n<?w plays
work (or not work). But to the spectator the main thing is victory.
