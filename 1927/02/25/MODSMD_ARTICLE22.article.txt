The Daily offers its readers a few statistics.
The University of California paid all the expenses of a four-man golf
team which that institution sent to the California Intercollegiate Cham
pionship Golf Tournament which was held at Pebble Beach last week-end.
Of these four men, only three qualified, and they were promptly elimi
nated in the first round of play.
The University of Southern California was represented by a three
man team, and the southern college paid all the expenses of these men.
and of a coach besides. But one Trojan qualified and he was a spectator
after the first round was completed.
The University of California at Los Angeles paid the expenses of
Harold Thompson, who was runner-up in the tournament.
Stanford University was represented at the championship tournament
by nine players. Seven of the nine qualified. In the semi-finals three of
the four men were Stanford players. And then Edwin Meyberg brought
the golf championship to Stanford by defeating Ilarold Thompson in
the final round.
The Board of Athletic Control gave not a cent toward defraying the
expenses of the University golf team. The nine men who carried the
name of Stanford to victory were forced to become their own financial
managers.
Money, money everywhere, but not a bit for golf.
