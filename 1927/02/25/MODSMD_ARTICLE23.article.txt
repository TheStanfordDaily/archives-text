						Green Edition

### 
Hie next issue of the Daily, which, of course, will apppcar Monday
morning as usual, will be the product of the freshman members of the
editorial staff. They will have their own editor, who will>appoint his own
assistants, and they will all have their own worries, just like real news
paper people.
Every piece of news in Monday's edition will be written by the 1930
reporters. No one will turn a hand toward putting out the paper except
the babes. The editorials, the bull session, the campus opinion column,
and every other feature will be the work of the youngsters. Bear with
them.
