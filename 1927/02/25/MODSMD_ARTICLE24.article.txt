ZENITH AND NADIR
A short time ago, Arthur Brisbane,
sage of the Hearst front page, com
mented that these forty-eight united
states had come to constitute a homo
geneous country.
It is true that we Americans all
mutilate the same language, that we
all play the same music on the same
phonographs, and that half of us de
cide to bob our hair all at once. So far
Arthur Brisbane is right.
Up to this point we have been deal
ing with superficialities. On the sur
face America appears homogeneous.
The cradle of the system of mass pro
duction, this country has naturally as
sumed an air of standardization. From
Saint Paul to Mexicali, and from
Hoboken to Watts, American customs
and American manners are pretty
much the same. But what of American
thought ?
* * *
Two recent news dispatches show
quite clearly that intellectual activity
in America is going off on widely vary
ing tangents. From Dayton, Tennessee,
comes the information,that an endow
ment is being floated for a university,
to be named after William Jennings
Bryan, the dramatic champion of
retrogression. It is said that the fac
ulty of the new university is to be
pledged to keep its curriculum free of
anything conflicting with a literal in
terpretation of the Bible. Almost si

| multaneously a report arrives from
Madison, Wisconsin, stating that Doc
tor Angus Meiklejohn is to be given a
free hand with two hundred and fifty
underclassmen, to the end that he may
work out the advanced theories of edu
cation for the promulgation of which
he was forced to resign from Amherst.
It is highly probable that Doctor
Meiklejohn's students will be allOAved
to believe in the Bible or not. as they
please, if they do believe in it, to
interpret it as they please.
* * *
In Madison and in Dayton flappers
will be making the same slangy ejacu
lations while they read the same
"true" stories. And housewives will be
copying the same patterns from The
Ladies' Home Journal, and workers
wearing the same brand of collars will
discuss technical details of the same
cheap automobiles.
All of this will be comparatively un
important. More important will be the
experiment in enlightenment at Madi
son and the frantic effort to perpetu
ate stagnation at Dayton.
If one judges a country by the
clothes its inhabitants wear, by the
small talk of its morons, America may
be said to be homogeneous. But if the
criterion is to be the intellectual ac
| tivity of its thinking element there
| are parts of America that have less in
| common than the natives of a Zulu
; village have with the 'fur-clad inhabit
, ants of a group of Eskimo igloos.

copying the same patterns from The

If one judges a country by the

ZENITH AND NADIR
A short time ago, Arthur Brisbane,
sage of the Hearst front page, com
mented that these forty-eight united
states had come to constitute a homo
geneous country.
It is true that we Americans all
mutilate the same language, that we
all play the same music on the same
phonographs, and that half of us de
cide to bob our hair all at once. So far
Arthur Brisbane is right.
Up to this point we have been deal
ing with superficialities. On the sur
face America appears homogeneous.
The cradle of the system of mass pro
duction, this country has naturally as
sumed an air of standardization. From
Saint Paul to Mexicali, and from
Hoboken to Watts, American customs
and American manners are pretty
much the same. But what of American
thought ?

Two recent news dispatches show
quite clearly that intellectual activity
in America is going off on widely vary
ing tangents. From Dayton, Tennessee,
comes the information,that an endow
ment is being floated for a university,
to be named after William Jennings
Bryan, the dramatic champion of
retrogression. It is said that the fac
ulty of the new university is to be
pledged to keep its curriculum free of
anything conflicting with a literal in
terpretation of the Bible. Almost si

| multaneously a report arrives from
Madison, Wisconsin, stating that Doc
tor Angus Meiklejohn is to be given a
free hand with two hundred and fifty
underclassmen, to the end that he may
work out the advanced theories of edu
cation for the promulgation of which
he was forced to resign from Amherst.
It is highly probable that Doctor
Meiklejohn's students will be allOAved
to believe in the Bible or not. as they
please, if they do believe in it, to
interpret it as they please.

In Madison and in Dayton flappers
will be making the same slangy ejacu
lations while they read the same
"true" stories. And housewives will be
copying the same patterns from The
Ladies' Home Journal, and workers
wearing the same brand of collars will
