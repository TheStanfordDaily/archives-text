# CAMPUS OPINION

! The Editor, Sir:
The reason offered by Mr. Clark for
the padlocked books in the Stanford Li
brary seems to me more of an insult to
| the integrity of the student body than
J the fact that the books are out of reach.
J What about the "Honor System"? Is
, the honor of the University in the stu
| dents' keeping as it has a reputation for
being, or is it held in trust for them —
■ safeguarded— to be splurged on unusual
! occasions- Restraint from cheating in
examinations — scenes of exceptional
| temptation—is only one of the more spec-
I tacular forms of honesty. When I signed
my pledge to keep the "Honor System,"
I meant to keep it for everyday use.
Now, as a graduate student with a card
to the stacks, I learn that those of us
who have cards are under suspicion. I
hear of the danger that a student with
a stack-card will find reading to his
execrable taste, wait until the library
assistant or the random prof, is around
the corner, slip volumes that he would
not dare mention on a loan slip under
an overcoat or a slicker worn for the
purpose, and take them silently where
they can be read with all the shades
dowfi. If the two hoarded books were
not under key, the loan desk would be
besieged for stack-cards and the book
shop for novels with paper covers. The
vogue for slickers among men and wom
en on the Campus would be accounted for
promptly.
Why entrust volumes in such danger
to a padlock? Mr. Clark would feel more
secure if he were to station armed
watches by the bolted door and post re
volving spotlights over the dark aisles.
When either of these books is recom
mended for use in a class, the professor
should be cross-examined and the vol
umes consulted in the presence of wit
nesses. The duty of a librarian in "Go
pher Prairie," you will remember, was
not to circulate but to protect the books.
Owing to the secretive character of the
Stanford student —afraid to be outspoken
on a loan-slip—the library of our Uni
versity should take untiring precautions
in support of this principle.

The Editor, Sir:
Dear Bull Session:
I wonder if you pet as much kick out
of yourself as I pet out of you? Per
sonally, I think you are an asset to the
Daily, because of your manifold attrac
tions. I like you. In fact, T usually read
your column before anything else in the
paper.
You seem to be inquisitive, curious, yet
fearless—and it is always interesting to
sec what the other fellow's next move
will be, That is why I like you.
You publish things that are well
thought out, to achieve an end. That end
being cither hearty approval or disap
proval of yourself. In either case you
arouse heated discussion, which seems to
be what you want. I get a lot of fun out

of seeing you print something like that
utter rot about the chapel, then, figura
j lively, seeing you sit back, rubbing your
| hands, with your eyes sparkling, elee
| fully awaiting wails of resentment which
l you know will follow.
In the Middle Ages, the monks dab
j bling in alchemy used to put several mys-
I terious substances in an iron pot. place
. it over a fire, pray for their physical
! safety, crsss themselves, and await re
! suits. This i« why the little mixing and
heating pot which we still use in chem
istry is called a crucible. Now, having
established my meaning of the word
"crucible." I'll compare the Bull Session
to it. I think you will get my idea.
I believe that you are neither more
helpful nor more harmful than the usual
bull session, which is. more often than
not, a poorly directed debate, and a jum
ble of irrelevant ideas. It is on this point
especially that you are far above the or
dinary bull session. Your discussions
are \jell directed. But they arc still only
one man's opinion, and should not count
for more than that. One man's opinion
never does harm or good, until it is given
publicity. Then it quite often starts some
thing.
I think that a lot of people take you
too seriously. They started frothing and
bubbling about your statements concern
ing the chapel. If I remember correctly
you said that the mosaics were compar
able to the blazers of Barnum's circus.
O. K. That is only your opinion, and I
don't have to accept it. Now here is my
oipinion—and you don't have to accept
it:
Never mind what I think about the
mosaics. 1 believe our chapel is one of
the sobering factors of the University (to
say nothing of the sponsor system). Let
us keep it so, rather than make bright
cracks about it.
This is only one more individual's
opinion, and therefore counts for no more
nor less than anyone else's. And it's alll
in the spirit of good, clean fun, so let's
call it quits and he friends again.
Hurray for crime!

The Editor, Sir:
There has been some discussion of
books kept under lock and key in the
University Library. It turns out that
the two principal works restricted in
circulation are "Studies in the Psychology
of Sex," by Havelock Ellis, and Bur
ton's translation of the "Arabian Nights."
The reason given for this policy is one
in which all libraries, every one of which
has a "permission shelf," take refuge,
protection from theft and defacement.
Why arc not the stacks sufficient protec
tion? The library gives an excuse, not a
reason; the personal attitude of librarians
is that of safeguarding the public morals,
and there are few librarians who would
confess to respect for the investigations
of the one work or admiration for and
enjoyment of the other, despite its imagi

native range and literary excellence.
Certainly no scientific work worthy of
being placed on the library shelves should
be so restricted in a university, at the
very basis of which lies the freedom to
prosecute the search for truth. Moreover,
no work of literary importance should be
denied to anyone. No normal person is
likely to spend much time over the dully
vicious portions of the "Arabian Nights" ;
anyone who reads the whole with avidity
either will never do it again or is in an
abnormal state of mind requiring the
assistance of a psychiatrist and should be
turned over to one.
It is unfortunate that our present so
ciety is beset with prudery, in spite of its
progress in many ways. The origins of
prudery lie in the medieval opposition
of the things of the spirit to the things
of the body, not realizing their identity,
in the condemnation linking the world,
the flesh, and the devil, and in the later
Puritan view of all pleasure and enjoy
ment as wicked, with the result that art
and literature were made subservient to
religion and morals. We find Spenser
satisfying his own nature in sensuous
description and reconciling this with his
acquired intellectual convictions by means
of a moral allegory. Puritanism leads to
prudery, the fruits of which are psycho
logical abnormality and repression, often
leading to suicide or insanity. As a mat
ter of fact ,all prudish persons are the
victims of a certain distorted viewpoint,
slightly abnormal. I recommend Sum
ner's "Folkways," in which the origins
of morals are discussed. In closing, I
should like to call attention to the fact
that in Greece, when literature and other
forms of human activity reached great
heights, certain vicious practices were
frequent. This is also true, to some ex
tent, of Renaissance Italy.

The Editor, Sir:
Dear Bull Session:
I wonder if you pet as much kick out
of yourself as I pet out of you? Per
sonally, I think you are an asset to the
Daily, because of your manifold attrac
tions. I like you. In fact, T usually read
your column before anything else in the
paper.
You seem to be inquisitive, curious, yet
fearless—and it is always interesting to
sec what the other fellow's next move
will be, That is why I like you.
You publish things that are well
thought out, to achieve an end. That end
being cither hearty approval or disap
proval of yourself. In either case you
arouse heated discussion, which seems to
be what you want. I get a lot of fun out

of seeing you print something like that
utter rot about the chapel, then, figura
j lively, seeing you sit back, rubbing your
| hands, with your eyes sparkling, elee
| fully awaiting wails of resentment which
l you know will follow.
In the Middle Ages, the monks dab
j bling in alchemy used to put several mys-
I terious substances in an iron pot. place
. it over a fire, pray for their physical
! safety, crsss themselves, and await re
! suits. This i« why the little mixing and
heating pot which we still use in chem
istry is called a crucible. Now, having
established my meaning of the word
"crucible." I'll compare the Bull Session
to it. I think you will get my idea.
I believe that you are neither more
helpful nor more harmful than the usual
bull session, which is. more often than
not, a poorly directed debate, and a jum
ble of irrelevant ideas. It is on this point
especially that you are far above the or
dinary bull session. Your discussions
are \jell directed. But they arc still only
one man's opinion, and should not count
for more than that. One man's opinion
never does harm or good, until it is given
publicity. Then it quite often starts some
thing.
I think that a lot of people take you
too seriously. They started frothing and
bubbling about your statements concern
ing the chapel. If I remember correctly
you said that the mosaics were compar
able to the blazers of Barnum's circus.
O. K. That is only your opinion, and I
don't have to accept it. Now here is my
oipinion—and you don't have to accept
it:
Never mind what I think about the
mosaics. 1 believe our chapel is one of
the sobering factors of the University (to
say nothing of the sponsor system). Let
us keep it so, rather than make bright
cracks about it.
This is only one more individual's
opinion, and therefore counts for no more
nor less than anyone else's. And it's alll
in the spirit of good, clean fun, so let's
call it quits and he friends again.
Hurray for crime!

The Editor, Sir:
There has been some discussion of
books kept under lock and key in the
University Library. It turns out that
the two principal works restricted in
circulation are "Studies in the Psychology
of Sex," by Havelock Ellis, and Bur
ton's translation of the "Arabian Nights."
The reason given for this policy is one
in which all libraries, every one of which
has a "permission shelf," take refuge,
protection from theft and defacement.
Why arc not the stacks sufficient protec
tion? The library gives an excuse, not a
reason; the personal attitude of librarians
is that of safeguarding the public morals,
and there are few librarians who would
confess to respect for the investigations
of the one work or admiration for and
enjoyment of the other, despite its imagi

native range and literary excellence.
Certainly no scientific work worthy of
being placed on the library shelves should
be so restricted in a university, at the
very basis of which lies the freedom to
prosecute the search for truth. Moreover,
no work of literary importance should be
denied to anyone. No normal person is
likely to spend much time over the dully
vicious portions of the "Arabian Nights" ;
anyone who reads the whole with avidity
either will never do it again or is in an
abnormal state of mind requiring the
assistance of a psychiatrist and should be
turned over to one.
It is unfortunate that our present so
ciety is beset with prudery, in spite of its
progress in many ways. The origins of
prudery lie in the medieval opposition
of the things of the spirit to the things
of the body, not realizing their identity,
in the condemnation linking the world,
the flesh, and the devil, and in the later
Puritan view of all pleasure and enjoy
ment as wicked, with the result that art
and literature were made subservient to
religion and morals. We find Spenser
satisfying his own nature in sensuous
description and reconciling this with his
acquired intellectual convictions by means
of a moral allegory. Puritanism leads to
prudery, the fruits of which are psycho
logical abnormality and repression, often
leading to suicide or insanity. As a mat
ter of fact ,all prudish persons are the
victims of a certain distorted viewpoint,
slightly abnormal. I recommend Sum
ner's "Folkways," in which the origins
of morals are discussed. In closing, I
should like to call attention to the fact
that in Greece, when literature and other
forms of human activity reached great
heights, certain vicious practices were
frequent. This is also true, to some ex
tent, of Renaissance Italy.

I believe that you are neither more
helpful nor more harmful than the usual
bull session, which is. more often than
not, a poorly directed debate, and a jum
ble of irrelevant ideas. It is on this point
especially that you are far above the or
dinary bull session. Your discussions
are \jell directed. But they arc still only
one man's opinion, and should not count
for more than that. One man's opinion
never does harm or good, until it is given
publicity. Then it quite often starts some
thing.
I think that a lot of people take you
too seriously. They started frothing and
bubbling about your statements concern
ing the chapel. If I remember correctly
you said that the mosaics were compar
able to the blazers of Barnum's circus.
O. K. That is only your opinion, and I
don't have to accept it. Now here is my
oipinion—and you don't have to accept
it:
Never mind what I think about the
mosaics. 1 believe our chapel is one of
the sobering factors of the University (to
say nothing of the sponsor system). Let
us keep it so, rather than make bright
cracks about it.
This is only one more individual's
opinion, and therefore counts for no more
nor less than anyone else's. And it's alll
in the spirit of good, clean fun, so let's
call it quits and he friends again.
Hurray for crime!

There has been some discussion of
books kept under lock and key in the
University Library. It turns out that
the two principal works restricted in
circulation are "Studies in the Psychology
of Sex," by Havelock Ellis, and Bur
ton's translation of the "Arabian Nights."
The reason given for this policy is one
in which all libraries, every one of which
has a "permission shelf," take refuge,
protection from theft and defacement.
Why arc not the stacks sufficient protec
tion? The library gives an excuse, not a
reason; the personal attitude of librarians
is that of safeguarding the public morals,
and there are few librarians who would
confess to respect for the investigations
of the one work or admiration for and
enjoyment of the other, despite its imagi

native range and literary excellence.
Certainly no scientific work worthy of
being placed on the library shelves should
be so restricted in a university, at the
very basis of which lies the freedom to
prosecute the search for truth. Moreover,
no work of literary importance should be
denied to anyone. No normal person is
likely to spend much time over the dully
vicious portions of the "Arabian Nights" ;
anyone who reads the whole with avidity
either will never do it again or is in an
abnormal state of mind requiring the
assistance of a psychiatrist and should be
turned over to one.
It is unfortunate that our present so
ciety is beset with prudery, in spite of its
progress in many ways. The origins of
prudery lie in the medieval opposition
of the things of the spirit to the things
of the body, not realizing their identity,
in the condemnation linking the world,
the flesh, and the devil, and in the later
Puritan view of all pleasure and enjoy
ment as wicked, with the result that art
and literature were made subservient to
religion and morals. We find Spenser
satisfying his own nature in sensuous
description and reconciling this with his
acquired intellectual convictions by means
of a moral allegory. Puritanism leads to
prudery, the fruits of which are psycho
logical abnormality and repression, often
leading to suicide or insanity. As a mat
ter of fact ,all prudish persons are the
victims of a certain distorted viewpoint,
slightly abnormal. I recommend Sum
ner's "Folkways," in which the origins
of morals are discussed. In closing, I
should like to call attention to the fact
that in Greece, when literature and other
forms of human activity reached great
heights, certain vicious practices were
frequent. This is also true, to some ex
tent, of Renaissance Italy.

heating pot which we still use in chem
istry is called a crucible. Now, having
established my meaning of the word
"crucible." I'll compare the Bull Session
to it. I think you will get my idea.
I believe that you are neither more
helpful nor more harmful than the usual
bull session, which is. more often than
not, a poorly directed debate, and a jum
ble of irrelevant ideas. It is on this point
especially that you are far above the or
dinary bull session. Your discussions
are \jell directed. But they arc still only
one man's opinion, and should not count
for more than that. One man's opinion
never does harm or good, until it is given
publicity. Then it quite often starts some
thing.
I think that a lot of people take you
too seriously. They started frothing and
bubbling about your statements concern
ing the chapel. If I remember correctly
you said that the mosaics were compar
able to the blazers of Barnum's circus.
O. K. That is only your opinion, and I
don't have to accept it. Now here is my
oipinion—and you don't have to accept
it:
Never mind what I think about the
mosaics. 1 believe our chapel is one of
the sobering factors of the University (to
say nothing of the sponsor system). Let
us keep it so, rather than make bright
cracks about it.
This is only one more individual's
opinion, and therefore counts for no more
nor less than anyone else's. And it's alll
in the spirit of good, clean fun, so let's
call it quits and he friends again.
Hurray for crime!

The Editor, Sir:
There has been some discussion of
books kept under lock and key in the
University Library. It turns out that
the two principal works restricted in
circulation are "Studies in the Psychology
of Sex," by Havelock Ellis, and Bur
ton's translation of the "Arabian Nights."
The reason given for this policy is one
in which all libraries, every one of which
has a "permission shelf," take refuge,
protection from theft and defacement.
Why arc not the stacks sufficient protec
tion? The library gives an excuse, not a
reason; the personal attitude of librarians
is that of safeguarding the public morals,
and there are few librarians who would
confess to respect for the investigations
of the one work or admiration for and
enjoyment of the other, despite its imagi

native range and literary excellence.
Certainly no scientific work worthy of
being placed on the library shelves should
be so restricted in a university, at the
very basis of which lies the freedom to
prosecute the search for truth. Moreover,
no work of literary importance should be
denied to anyone. No normal person is
likely to spend much time over the dully
vicious portions of the "Arabian Nights" ;
anyone who reads the whole with avidity
either will never do it again or is in an
abnormal state of mind requiring the
assistance of a psychiatrist and should be
turned over to one.
It is unfortunate that our present so
ciety is beset with prudery, in spite of its
progress in many ways. The origins of
prudery lie in the medieval opposition
of the things of the spirit to the things
of the body, not realizing their identity,
in the condemnation linking the world,
the flesh, and the devil, and in the later
Puritan view of all pleasure and enjoy
ment as wicked, with the result that art
and literature were made subservient to
religion and morals. We find Spenser
satisfying his own nature in sensuous
description and reconciling this with his
acquired intellectual convictions by means
of a moral allegory. Puritanism leads to
prudery, the fruits of which are psycho
logical abnormality and repression, often
leading to suicide or insanity. As a mat
ter of fact ,all prudish persons are the
victims of a certain distorted viewpoint,
slightly abnormal. I recommend Sum
ner's "Folkways," in which the origins
of morals are discussed. In closing, I
should like to call attention to the fact
that in Greece, when literature and other
forms of human activity reached great
heights, certain vicious practices were
frequent. This is also true, to some ex
tent, of Renaissance Italy.

The reason offered by Mr. Clark for
the padlocked books in the Stanford Li
brary seems to me more of an insult to
| the integrity of the student body than
J the fact that the books are out of reach.
J What about the "Honor System"? Is
, the honor of the University in the stu
| dents' keeping as it has a reputation for
being, or is it held in trust for them —
■ safeguarded— to be splurged on unusual
! occasions- Restraint from cheating in
examinations — scenes of exceptional
| temptation—is only one of the more spec-
I tacular forms of honesty. When I signed
my pledge to keep the "Honor System,"
I meant to keep it for everyday use.
Now, as a graduate student with a card
to the stacks, I learn that those of us
who have cards are under suspicion. I
hear of the danger that a student with
a stack-card will find reading to his
execrable taste, wait until the library
assistant or the random prof, is around
the corner, slip volumes that he would
not dare mention on a loan slip under
an overcoat or a slicker worn for the
purpose, and take them silently where
they can be read with all the shades
dowfi. If the two hoarded books were
not under key, the loan desk would be
besieged for stack-cards and the book
shop for novels with paper covers. The
vogue for slickers among men and wom
en on the Campus would be accounted for
promptly.
Why entrust volumes in such danger
to a padlock? Mr. Clark would feel more
secure if he were to station armed
watches by the bolted door and post re
volving spotlights over the dark aisles.
When either of these books is recom
mended for use in a class, the professor
should be cross-examined and the vol
umes consulted in the presence of wit
nesses. The duty of a librarian in "Go
pher Prairie," you will remember, was
not to circulate but to protect the books.
Owing to the secretive character of the
Stanford student —afraid to be outspoken
on a loan-slip—the library of our Uni
versity should take untiring precautions
in support of this principle.

your column before anything else in the

You seem to be inquisitive, curious, yet

will be, That is why I like you.
You publish things that are well
thought out, to achieve an end. That end
being cither hearty approval or disap
proval of yourself. In either case you
arouse heated discussion, which seems to
be what you want. I get a lot of fun out
