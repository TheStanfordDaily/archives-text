Stan \\ eigle: "A beautiful afternoon,
is it not ?"
Henry Graham : "Yes, very."

Students of a prominent Oregon col
lege, where the deadline on Saturday
nights is 12 midnight, have begun a cam
paign for bigger and better dances and
longer and liberaler hours wherein to get
the wimmen home. To the interests of
freedom, which Cabbages is always anx
ious to help, we dedicate the following
ballad:
The sunken sun has sent its last
Beams glimmering across the sky,
The clock has strucken six in sooth,
'I he dance's opening is nigh.
Each swain must get his lady love
And get her back before 'tis late
Enough to hear the clock strike twelve;
If not, the lockout she will rate.
* l
In twilight dim the dance begins,
No need for heavy lighting bills;
Before the darkness gets too thick
The dance must stop, the ruling wills.
And so to home the pipple go
But, gosh, how fast they gotta drive,
For fifteen minutes after that
There brawl has stopped they must ar
rive. —F. T. M.

Tt may not be propaganda or anything
like that, hut when the new song, "We
love the college girls." came out the other
day, ever vsorority bought a record.—J. H.

A San Francisco newspaper offers $5
to the city resident who looks most like
Coolidge.
Not enough money!

The "missing link" applied for admis
sion to the William Jennings Bryan Uni
versity in Dayton. Tennessee. He was
refused improbable and more likely
downright Impossible .

Cabbages claims, that the supreme ego
ist is the man who sang "Hail, hail, the
gang's all here." when he was by himself.

Comes the spring, comes the filling of the
lake,
Comes the ponderous query, just which
girl to lake,
Comes the fixing of the boats,
Or of anything that floats.
Comes the weighty problem, which study
to forsake. —T. H.

Students of a prominent Oregon col

nights is 12 midnight, have begun a cam
paign for bigger and better dances and
longer and liberaler hours wherein to get
the wimmen home. To the interests of
freedom, which Cabbages is always anx
ious to help, we dedicate the following
ballad:
The sunken sun has sent its last
Beams glimmering across the sky,
The clock has strucken six in sooth,
'I he dance's opening is nigh.
Each swain must get his lady love
And get her back before 'tis late
Enough to hear the clock strike twelve;
If not, the lockout she will rate.
* l
In twilight dim the dance begins,
No need for heavy lighting bills;
Before the darkness gets too thick
The dance must stop, the ruling wills.
And so to home the pipple go
But, gosh, how fast they gotta drive,
For fifteen minutes after that
There brawl has stopped they must ar
rive. —F. T. M.

Tt may not be propaganda or anything
like that, hut when the new song, "We
love the college girls." came out the other
day, ever vsorority bought a record.—J. H.
