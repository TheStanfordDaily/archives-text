Rambles with Anatole France. 13y
Sander Kerei. (Lippincott.)
The death of Anatole France brought
with it a deluge of biographies written
; from too close a perspective to the latter
days of the great master's life. Most of
them placed too much stress on this
! senile period of Anatole France and so
left us a picture of the old man irascible
i and unmoral, genius though he was.
It is with great relief and delight,
'< therefore, that one turns to Sandor Ke
meri's "Rambles with Anatole France,"
translated from the Hungarian. Here is
Anatole France of pre-war days—the
genius still at the height of his creative
powers.
Sandor Kemeri, a Hungarian woman,
was France's secretary while the great
man was on a recuperative pilgrimage to
his beloved Italy. Sandor Kemeri tells
not only how her master worshipped the
glorious achievements of the artistic past,
but also reveals through his charming
conversations the great soul that was
Anatole France. The student of classi
cal and Renaissance art will find in these
bits of deft criticism a treasure house
of appreciation and understanding.
It is in these conversations, brilliant,
eloquent, and erudite, that one gets at
the genuine Anatole France—an Anatole
France who loved beauty above life,
whose aesthetic sense was as quick to
note a bit of misplaced furniture as to
; sense the beautiful proportions of an
; unnamed Phidias.
I Then there are two wonderful chapters
| —ephemeral moments in France's life—
| which tell more of this man than his
j own works and his many biographies.
; Here is revealed the tender, human Ana
j tole France wlu> could not bear the suf-
I fering of an unknown waif and whose
thoughts constantly sought a way out
for unfortunates. Here stands Anatole
! France, humanitarian, defender of un-
I popular causes, gentle, charitable, and

tolerant— an Anatole France who would
sacrifice a dear and intimate friendship
ratljer than retrench from his defense of
a universally hated political figure who
had been unjustly dealt with.
