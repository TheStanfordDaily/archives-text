# PALO ALTO TO HAVE SPRING OPENING TOMORROW MAM'SELLE CHIC DESCRIBES THE NEW MODES BLACK POPULAR COLOR FOR MILADY'S APPAREL
## 
### Mademoiselle Chi 
Wc have heard a lot about the envv
and all her troubles since these "cow
coats" have become the rage, but I I
greatly fear that the poor, old, faithful
animal is surely doomed to extinction
now, for I hear that her small calf is to
furnish Milady with collars and cuff-., as I
well as hats, bags, coats, and belts.
Creators of fashion come and go, but 1
fashion herself goes on forever. There
fore, mes soeurs de Stanford, I want to j
tell you all about her latest whims in
ushering in the spring season. You all i
want to glide smoothly over Lagunita
(which old Jupiter Pluvius has so gen
erously filled) garbed in the dernier cri,
I know, and so you must hear of the
very newest fabrics, colors, and lines
that Paris demands.
Our friends, the merchants of Palo
Alto, are foreseeing your wants, and are
planning a gala Spring Opening Satur
day. You want to go to the shops pre
pared to see the very latest, so hark,
while I tell you just what Dame Fashion
■decrees for Spring.
Simplicity Best
Vogue tells us that le chic is a form
of architecture, and that as a coherence
and simplicity throughout mark the best
artifice, so do they mark the best cos
tume. A certain sleekness and compact
ness both go to make up a certain trim
perfection that is greatly desired. Trim
ming and ornament are no longer added
parts of a costume, but to be truly chic
must be the outgrowths of the garment
itself.
Harmony is the keynote of the spring's
■vogue. There must be a harmony not
only of color and frills, but also there
must be one of surface; that is, a dull
faced material needs a felt hat, and both
are enhanced by suede shoes. If you
want to prove to Mr. Turkel and certain
others that the "five hundred" possess
Ijoth beauty and brains, just remember
this point when you choose your spring
wardrobe.
Line is a highly developed feature of
the new mode. It takes many forms —
diagonal, curved, vertical, and horizontal
—which adds much interest to the effect
of simplicity.
The yoke is important as a mark of
newness in milady's new gown. It may
be in any one of a variety of shapes, and
often is made of material that is of a j
contrasting color from the remainder of
the garment. It is sometimes suggested
by bands or lines of stitching, but in any
case, it is quite le dernier cri for Made
moiselle.
Suits are essential for spring. There is
the two piece twfced suit or the tuxedo
jacket or hip length coat and skirt (either
pleated or plain) and the four piece
ensemble (the ensemble, by the way. is
definitely here to stay). The latter con
sists of a coat, skirt, overblouse, and
sleeveless bolero or cardigan. Two or
three kinds of materials are used of the
■same color but varying in pattern. There
are all sorts of combinations possible—
coat and dress may match in color and
fabric, or any one may form a contrast
■with the others. With the prevalence of
suits, separate blouses are, at last coming
into their own again.
Bolero Is Popular
The bolero or bolero effect in back is
extremely according to Paris this season,
as is the cardigan—a short sleeveless
jacket. There is a decided tendency to
return to sleeveless models in sportswear ;
so, my friends, prepare for a bad case of
sunburn, if you would venture forth to
answer the call of spring this year.
Dress lines emphasize the slender sil
lioetitte, or have broad shoulders and
loose lines to the waist, which are
achieved by Mousing at that point. Some
of the most reliable authorities tell me
that the lower the waistline, the more
chic the garment; others say that we are
returning to the natural waistline. One
style recognizes a compromise by having
two belt lines, one at the normal line
and the other a trifle lower. Narrow
belts arc a most popular prediction. Nejft
comes the skirt of Mademoiselle's gown,
which is very frequently panelled.
Lace in Vogue
Evening dress is decorated to quite an
extent. Remember when planning your
gowns for afternoon and tailored use,
mes amis, that lace is quite comme il
faut. You just must have a little lace in
your wardrobe. Then uneven hems are
still proving themselves most popular for
evening dresses.
The cry of tHe season for extreme chic
and distinction in color is black. But of
course you won't wear black all of the
time, and for those other occasions let
me advise you that two colors are com
bined to give a most pleasing effect.
Beige, modified to gray beige and rose
beige, is decidedly good again for the
coming spring—in fact, it is one of the
colors. As far as I have been able to
find out, blues and greens of slightly dif
ferent tones will tend to make Made
moiselle a well dressed co-ed. She will
also give an important place to prints in
her spring clothes if she would be right
up to the minute.
Use Figured Fabrics
In fact Vogue makes much of the fact
that "figured fabrics arc the harbingers

>112 spring." The smartest of these are of
-.mall designs that give a somewhat tail
ored effect.
| If would be hard for Mademoiselle to
go wrong on the fabric she chooses, for
cotton and wool, woolen, crepe, and chif
fon are all excellent. I find various silk
I crepes to be especially of the made, and
' jersey is again the old reliable for sports,
1 I hear, together with crepe de chine and
i similar materials.
Youth is both the subject and tiac ob
ject of the designers—so, mes cheres
soeurs, you have an excellent start to
' achieve the chic of the season. And with
Palo Alto having a big Spring Opening
tomorrow to show you the mode itself,
I shall surely expect to see you all out
in the gay season's latest very soon. So
here's to Spring Clothes. Spring Fever,
and Spring Quarter Rushing, my dears.
And, oh, do pardon the afterthought,
but it is a little secret in regard to some
thing you surely should know—Bull Dur
ham is not considered as "fashionable in
the line of Milady's smokes as are Ben
son and Hedges.

furnish Milady with collars and cuff-., as I
well as hats, bags, coats, and belts.
Creators of fashion come and go, but 1
fashion herself goes on forever. There
fore, mes soeurs de Stanford, I want to j
tell you all about her latest whims in
ushering in the spring season. You all i
want to glide smoothly over Lagunita
(which old Jupiter Pluvius has so gen
erously filled) garbed in the dernier cri,
I know, and so you must hear of the
very newest fabrics, colors, and lines
that Paris demands.
Our friends, the merchants of Palo
Alto, are foreseeing your wants, and are
planning a gala Spring Opening Satur
day. You want to go to the shops pre
pared to see the very latest, so hark,
while I tell you just what Dame Fashion
■decrees for Spring.
Simplicity Best
Vogue tells us that le chic is a form
of architecture, and that as a coherence
and simplicity throughout mark the best
artifice, so do they mark the best cos
tume. A certain sleekness and compact
ness both go to make up a certain trim
perfection that is greatly desired. Trim
ming and ornament are no longer added
parts of a costume, but to be truly chic
must be the outgrowths of the garment
itself.
Harmony is the keynote of the spring's
■vogue. There must be a harmony not
only of color and frills, but also there
must be one of surface; that is, a dull
faced material needs a felt hat, and both
are enhanced by suede shoes. If you
want to prove to Mr. Turkel and certain
others that the "five hundred" possess
Ijoth beauty and brains, just remember
this point when you choose your spring
wardrobe.
Line is a highly developed feature of
the new mode. It takes many forms —
diagonal, curved, vertical, and horizontal
—which adds much interest to the effect
of simplicity.
The yoke is important as a mark of
newness in milady's new gown. It may
be in any one of a variety of shapes, and
often is made of material that is of a j
contrasting color from the remainder of
the garment. It is sometimes suggested
by bands or lines of stitching, but in any
case, it is quite le dernier cri for Made
moiselle.
Suits are essential for spring. There is
the two piece twfced suit or the tuxedo
jacket or hip length coat and skirt (either
pleated or plain) and the four piece
ensemble (the ensemble, by the way. is
definitely here to stay). The latter con
sists of a coat, skirt, overblouse, and
sleeveless bolero or cardigan. Two or
three kinds of materials are used of the
■same color but varying in pattern. There
are all sorts of combinations possible—
coat and dress may match in color and
fabric, or any one may form a contrast
■with the others. With the prevalence of
suits, separate blouses are, at last coming
into their own again.
Bolero Is Popular
The bolero or bolero effect in back is
extremely according to Paris this season,
as is the cardigan—a short sleeveless
jacket. There is a decided tendency to
return to sleeveless models in sportswear ;
so, my friends, prepare for a bad case of
sunburn, if you would venture forth to
answer the call of spring this year.
Dress lines emphasize the slender sil
lioetitte, or have broad shoulders and
loose lines to the waist, which are
achieved by Mousing at that point. Some
of the most reliable authorities tell me
that the lower the waistline, the more
chic the garment; others say that we are
returning to the natural waistline. One
style recognizes a compromise by having
two belt lines, one at the normal line
and the other a trifle lower. Narrow
belts arc a most popular prediction. Nejft
comes the skirt of Mademoiselle's gown,
which is very frequently panelled.
Lace in Vogue
Evening dress is decorated to quite an
extent. Remember when planning your
gowns for afternoon and tailored use,
mes amis, that lace is quite comme il
faut. You just must have a little lace in
your wardrobe. Then uneven hems are
still proving themselves most popular for
evening dresses.
The cry of tHe season for extreme chic
and distinction in color is black. But of
course you won't wear black all of the
time, and for those other occasions let
me advise you that two colors are com
bined to give a most pleasing effect.
Beige, modified to gray beige and rose
beige, is decidedly good again for the
coming spring—in fact, it is one of the
colors. As far as I have been able to
find out, blues and greens of slightly dif
ferent tones will tend to make Made
moiselle a well dressed co-ed. She will
also give an important place to prints in
her spring clothes if she would be right
up to the minute.
Use Figured Fabrics
In fact Vogue makes much of the fact
that "figured fabrics arc the harbingers

>112 spring." The smartest of these are of
-.mall designs that give a somewhat tail
ored effect.
| If would be hard for Mademoiselle to
go wrong on the fabric she chooses, for
cotton and wool, woolen, crepe, and chif
fon are all excellent. I find various silk
I crepes to be especially of the made, and
' jersey is again the old reliable for sports,
1 I hear, together with crepe de chine and
i similar materials.
Youth is both the subject and tiac ob
ject of the designers—so, mes cheres
soeurs, you have an excellent start to
' achieve the chic of the season. And with
Palo Alto having a big Spring Opening
tomorrow to show you the mode itself,
I shall surely expect to see you all out
in the gay season's latest very soon. So
here's to Spring Clothes. Spring Fever,
and Spring Quarter Rushing, my dears.
And, oh, do pardon the afterthought,
but it is a little secret in regard to some
thing you surely should know—Bull Dur
ham is not considered as "fashionable in
the line of Milady's smokes as are Ben
son and Hedges.
Wc have heard a lot about the envv
and all her troubles since these "cow
coats" have become the rage, but I I
greatly fear that the poor, old, faithful
animal is surely doomed to extinction
now, for I hear that her small calf is to
furnish Milady with collars and cuff-., as I
well as hats, bags, coats, and belts.

(which old Jupiter Pluvius has so gen
erously filled) garbed in the dernier cri,
I know, and so you must hear of the
very newest fabrics, colors, and lines
that Paris demands.
Our friends, the merchants of Palo
Alto, are foreseeing your wants, and are
planning a gala Spring Opening Satur
day. You want to go to the shops pre
pared to see the very latest, so hark,
while I tell you just what Dame Fashion
■decrees for Spring.
Simplicity Best
Vogue tells us that le chic is a form
of architecture, and that as a coherence
and simplicity throughout mark the best
artifice, so do they mark the best cos
tume. A certain sleekness and compact
ness both go to make up a certain trim
perfection that is greatly desired. Trim
ming and ornament are no longer added
parts of a costume, but to be truly chic
must be the outgrowths of the garment
itself.
Harmony is the keynote of the spring's
■vogue. There must be a harmony not
only of color and frills, but also there
must be one of surface; that is, a dull
faced material needs a felt hat, and both
are enhanced by suede shoes. If you
want to prove to Mr. Turkel and certain
others that the "five hundred" possess
Ijoth beauty and brains, just remember
this point when you choose your spring
wardrobe.
Line is a highly developed feature of
the new mode. It takes many forms —
diagonal, curved, vertical, and horizontal
—which adds much interest to the effect
of simplicity.
The yoke is important as a mark of
newness in milady's new gown. It may
be in any one of a variety of shapes, and
often is made of material that is of a j
contrasting color from the remainder of
the garment. It is sometimes suggested
by bands or lines of stitching, but in any
case, it is quite le dernier cri for Made
moiselle.
Suits are essential for spring. There is
the two piece twfced suit or the tuxedo
jacket or hip length coat and skirt (either
pleated or plain) and the four piece
ensemble (the ensemble, by the way. is
definitely here to stay). The latter con
sists of a coat, skirt, overblouse, and
sleeveless bolero or cardigan. Two or
three kinds of materials are used of the
■same color but varying in pattern. There
are all sorts of combinations possible—
coat and dress may match in color and
fabric, or any one may form a contrast
■with the others. With the prevalence of
suits, separate blouses are, at last coming
into their own again.
Bolero Is Popular
The bolero or bolero effect in back is
extremely according to Paris this season,
as is the cardigan—a short sleeveless
jacket. There is a decided tendency to
return to sleeveless models in sportswear ;
so, my friends, prepare for a bad case of
sunburn, if you would venture forth to
answer the call of spring this year.
Dress lines emphasize the slender sil
lioetitte, or have broad shoulders and
loose lines to the waist, which are
achieved by Mousing at that point. Some
of the most reliable authorities tell me
that the lower the waistline, the more
chic the garment; others say that we are
returning to the natural waistline. One
style recognizes a compromise by having
two belt lines, one at the normal line
and the other a trifle lower. Narrow
belts arc a most popular prediction. Nejft
comes the skirt of Mademoiselle's gown,
which is very frequently panelled.
Lace in Vogue
Evening dress is decorated to quite an
extent. Remember when planning your
gowns for afternoon and tailored use,
mes amis, that lace is quite comme il
faut. You just must have a little lace in
your wardrobe. Then uneven hems are
still proving themselves most popular for
evening dresses.
The cry of tHe season for extreme chic
and distinction in color is black. But of
course you won't wear black all of the
time, and for those other occasions let
me advise you that two colors are com
bined to give a most pleasing effect.
Beige, modified to gray beige and rose
beige, is decidedly good again for the
coming spring—in fact, it is one of the
colors. As far as I have been able to
find out, blues and greens of slightly dif
ferent tones will tend to make Made
moiselle a well dressed co-ed. She will
also give an important place to prints in
her spring clothes if she would be right
up to the minute.
Use Figured Fabrics
In fact Vogue makes much of the fact
that "figured fabrics arc the harbingers

>112 spring." The smartest of these are of
-.mall designs that give a somewhat tail
ored effect.
| If would be hard for Mademoiselle to
go wrong on the fabric she chooses, for
cotton and wool, woolen, crepe, and chif
fon are all excellent. I find various silk
I crepes to be especially of the made, and
' jersey is again the old reliable for sports,
1 I hear, together with crepe de chine and
i similar materials.
Youth is both the subject and tiac ob
ject of the designers—so, mes cheres
soeurs, you have an excellent start to
' achieve the chic of the season. And with
Palo Alto having a big Spring Opening
tomorrow to show you the mode itself,
I shall surely expect to see you all out
in the gay season's latest very soon. So
here's to Spring Clothes. Spring Fever,
and Spring Quarter Rushing, my dears.
And, oh, do pardon the afterthought,
but it is a little secret in regard to some
thing you surely should know—Bull Dur
ham is not considered as "fashionable in
the line of Milady's smokes as are Ben
son and Hedges.
Wc have heard a lot about the envv
and all her troubles since these "cow
coats" have become the rage, but I I
greatly fear that the poor, old, faithful
animal is surely doomed to extinction
now, for I hear that her small calf is to
furnish Milady with collars and cuff-., as I
well as hats, bags, coats, and belts.
Creators of fashion come and go, but 1
fashion herself goes on forever. There
fore, mes soeurs de Stanford, I want to j
tell you all about her latest whims in
ushering in the spring season. You all i
want to glide smoothly over Lagunita
(which old Jupiter Pluvius has so gen
erously filled) garbed in the dernier cri,
I know, and so you must hear of the
very newest fabrics, colors, and lines
