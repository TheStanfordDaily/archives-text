' Man's a ribald, Man's a rake,
Man is Nature's sole mistake."
An irate father of a downcast groom,
courtiers searching the panorama with
field glasses—despite their medieval cos
tumes—and the best of wedding plans
obviously awry, await the audience as
the curtain for "Princess Ida" rises to
-night in the Assembly Hall. The open
ing overture for the Gilbert and Sulli
van comic opera will begin promptly at
8:10 o'clock.
Princess Ida (Mss Winifred Esta
brook), betrothed to Prince Hilarion
(Bailey Newlee) at the age of one, has
broken her plighted troth, to found a
women's university at Castle Adamant,
one of her father's domains. There a
full hundred women, sworn and true,
have taken solemn oaths to renounce all
things male, even to chessmen.
Male Intruders
To this fortress of femininity come a
new "Three Musketeers," Cyril (Charles 1
Moore), Florian (Fenton Barrett), and
Hilarion, seeking to obtain Princess Ida's
renunciation of her philosophy. Their
ventures in the undertaking form the plot
of the operetta, resplendent with tune
ful melodies, sentimental nonsense, com

edy situations, and picturesque settings.
Leslie and Chrysella Kiler have con
structed the settings with the aid of the
Theater Workshop class. Direction of
the opera is divided between Gordon
Davis of the Dramatic Council and War
ren D. Allen of the Glee Club, with Miss
j Frances Boone in charge of the dancing
i and chorus work. Under Allen's direc
i lion, the University Orchestra of thirty
| pieces will play the score.
