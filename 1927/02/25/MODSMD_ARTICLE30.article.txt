# COLOR PREVALENT IN LATEST SHOWINGS OF EARLY SPRING SHOES
## 
### 
Shoes, Mademoiselle are of greatest
importance, in deciding as to whether or
not a person is well groomed. So, mes
soeurs, I want to give you a peep into
the spring's footwear fashions. First I
must remark, although I hope it is need
less, that your shoes and your hose must
be in perfect harmony with the rest of
your ensemble.
I am told that black patent leather and
lizard skin combines well in a one strap
slipper. The strap should be narrow and
carried down to the sole of the shoe. This
is not only a becoming model, but it is
a definitely chic one.
For sports, a one strap brown and
white combination with a high cuban
heel is recommended. The newer tie is
also a dominant factor in this type of
shoe. Kids and patents are surely the
outstanding materials this season.
Color, the embodiment of all spring,
sets, the note in footwear as in other
things. Color that will flatter and en
hance the beauty of Milady's foot such
as pastelle parchment, stone, rose blush,
shell gray, stroller tan, and hampstead
brown are all on Fashion's list. Shoes
are indeed so attractive this season that
Milady will enjoy making her selection, I
know.
