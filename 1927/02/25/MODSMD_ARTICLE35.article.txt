## 
### 
'"Men students engaged in athletics
make slightly better grades than the men
not engaged in sports," states Professor
Earl J. Miller, dean of men at the Uni
versity of California at Los Angeles,
upon completion of a statistical report
made by his office. Scholastic records of
1954 students were examined to deter
mine the relationship between scholarship
and student activities on the campus.
"Men in activities also make better
grades than men not engaged in extra
curricular activities. Those activities
which take the most time give their par
ticipants a higher scholastic ranking than
those which take comparatively little
time," continued Dean Miller.
Explaining the reason for his survey,
Miller said, "It is a firm conviction of
many university people that extra-curricu
lar activities are, as a general rule, detri
mental to the scholarship of the students
taking part in them and that in very
many, if not in most cases, the effect is
serious. The survey shows that this is
not the case."
