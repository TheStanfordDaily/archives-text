Danger resulting from narrow clear- i
ante of the engineering building en- i
trances and disturbance of instruments
in the metallurgy laboratory by vibra
tions were the main reasons for cut-!
ting out the run of the campus street '
car between the Bookstore and the j
Roble station, Comptroller Almon E. |
Roth stated Monday.
Elimination of the crossing on La
suen, the supposed motive, was merely
incidental to the other reasons. Roth i
said. The clearance of the engineering |
laboratories, notably the entrance to I
the new aeronautics laboratory, is but;
three or four feet, and would be a con-!
stant source of danger.
A short spur will be left acrossj
Lasuen, Roth indicated, to provide
space for extra cars to stand when
needed to handle crowds. Track and
trolley wires of the local Toonerville
are owned by the University, while
the rolling stock is the property of the
Peninsula Railroad Company.
