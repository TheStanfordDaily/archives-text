# JEFFERSON MAN OF GREAT VISION AVERS DAVID STARR JORDAN
## Education Is Among Chief Problems Encountered During Regime 
### 
Characterizing Jefferson as a man
of great vision who saw into the fu
ture, Dr. Jordan, in his regular Thurs
day Evening Conference, discussed in
detail the grave political problems
which faced the famous president dur
ing his regime.
Aaron Burr's type of filibustering
swashbuckling, the coming cloud of
slavery, the rise of cities and the de
cline of agricultural population, the
protective tariff, the dispute of states'
rights, and the question of education
were among these problems.
Democracy Sound
"Jefferson's idea of democracy was
sound. A democracy should be a train
ing school in government, where the
people practice the art of governing,"
declared Dr. Jordan. "A people should
be free and equal in its right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
"Jefferson saw the need of educa
tion, so he founded the university of
Virginia. His plan for the architec
tural lay-out of the university was fol
lowed at Stanford. Its central Quad
was grass and without trees," lie con
tinued.
Discussing Phi Beta Kappa and its
foundation in Jefferson's time, Dr.
Jordan alleged. "Marks do not indi
cate everything. I know many great
men who did not make Phi Beta
Kappa."
Better Opportunities
Dr. Jordan believes that college
graduates should work toward better
ing the opportunities in America', not
toward making it more prosperous.
"The chances for young men are ten
times as great now as they were when
I was a young man," he continued. "I
started out with seventy-five dollars
and did mv best at whatever job I had.
The big thing was turning this farm
into a university. I'd rather do that
than be any kind of a Mussolini or
king in the world."
Referring to the present financial
wealth of America, he said: "War
makes the world safe for plutocracy.
The people should be strengthened so
wealth doesn't make them weak.
Strengthen the weak; don't weaken
the strong.
Jefferson No Atheist
"Jefferson was called an atheist.
Like Lincoln he considered himself a
Christian following the original doc
trines of Christ and did not believe
that to Jesus should be ascribed any
thing but every human excellence,"
Dr. Jordan averred.
"Friendliness and the increasing of
the strength of the individual are the
only ways to better conditions. War
gains nothing," he concluded.
