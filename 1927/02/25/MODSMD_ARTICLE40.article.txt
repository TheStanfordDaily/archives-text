AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 21.—"Play
marbles for flat feet," is the cry heard
at the University of Texas. The game
is played differently from the classic
rules laid down in back yards by small
boys' demand. By the rules of the physi
cal training department of the univer
sity, the flat-foot victim places the marble
between the big toe and its neighbor and
then walks a distance of 100 yards with
the marble grasped in this manner.
This process develops the necessary
muscles and cures fallen arches, states
the medical staff of the university.
