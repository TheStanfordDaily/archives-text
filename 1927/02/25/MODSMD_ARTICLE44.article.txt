# MINDS OF STUDENTS, HUMANS NOT SAME— TULANE PROFESSOR
## Says Students Do Not Think But Merely Pour Libations And Pray for Help 
### 
"There are two types of minds—the
human and the undergraduate. However,
these have no connection with each other.
The mass mind, as in the case of human
beings, can always be fathomed as to
the manifestations of its next actions, but
the undergraduate mind—no one can ever
tell what its next actions w be." Thus
speaks Dr. John Smith Kendall of Tu
lane University, New Orleans, in an
interview in the college weekly publica
tion, the Tulane Hullabaloo.
After distinguishing between the two
types of minds, Dr. Kendall asserts that
the undergraduate's is only zoologically
a mind; that the student makes no effort
to understand what it's all about at col
lege, but merely says, "Here I am, edu
cate me!" He further said that the adult
mind is the human one, possessed by hu
man beings outside of college, and that
the undergraduate mind is found only in
a university.
Curriculum a Ritual
He also claims that "the undergradu
ate thinks the college curiculum is a
ritual, and that he must pour libations
to the gods of Chemistry, Physics, and
others. If the smoke from the sacrifices
as favorable to the gods, the student
passes. If not, he offers more sacrifices
and libations to the angered deities. He
thinks that if he is in favor with the
gods of the subjects he is taking, he will
get through college; but if he is in dis
favor, he must appease their feelings or
he will flunk out of college."
Dr. Kendall reasons that when a stu
dent fails in his college course he blames
it on the weather or the professor, but
when he fails in making a team, he will ]
admit he was not good enough. "Why,
then," asks the doctor, "doesn't the stu
dent apply this rule to making grades?"
