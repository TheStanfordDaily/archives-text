# TRACK OUTLOOK FOR BEARS STRENGTHENED BY NEW DISCOVERIES

### Harry Frishman 
BERKELEY, Feb. 24.â€”That the Cali
fornia 1927 track squad will be greatly
strengthened by an influx of heretofore
unknown material, was brought out by
the recent "Mexican Marathon" held un
der the direction of Coash "Walt"
Christie.
Over one hundred candidates entered
the meet which was a man-to-man contest
in which several of the lettermen set the
pace.
Richard E. Blewett, of gridiron fame,
surprised many by pushing Ragan at
the tape in the high hurdles, and taking
first in the high jump, in the absence of
Oather Hampton. Several years ago
Blewett took first in the high hurdles and
second in the high jump in the State inter
scholastic competition, and shows signs
of returning to his old time form. Dick's
only track competition at the University
of California was in 1925, which leaves
him two seasons more as a member of the
squad.
Joseph Hamilton and Emery Curtis,
competing for the first time, each tossed
the javelin over 160 feet, and can be de
pended upon to fill the gap caused by the
loss of Gene Sterling .
Harry Carter, whom Christie had se
lected from one of the sophomore gym I
classes, showed signs of developing into
a capable running mate for Les Schwo
beda. when he ran three laps in 3:19.
Louis Enos, a veteran low hurdler, en
tered the broad jump .end in his last at
tempt turned in a leap of 20 feet 9 inches,
and with a little more training should
worry a good many of the returning vet
erans.
In a driving rain Van Gldcr sprinted
160 yards in 16 4-5 seconds, and 80 yards
in 8 3-5 seconds; while Giguiere covered
330 yards in 37 4-5 seconds and tied Van
Gelder's mark at 80 yards.
