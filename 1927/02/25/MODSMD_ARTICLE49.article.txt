# ROSE PONSELLE ENJOYS SWIFT RISE TO FAME AS VOCALIST ON CONCERT STAGE
## Artist Began Successful Career by Singing in Nickleodeon at Salary of Twelve Dollars Per Week 
### 
To find herself, at twenty-two, at the top of a hill which, two years before, had
not even been visible on the horizon; to pass mm the humblest obscurity to a
position of prestige and distinction; to become famous overnight, have been the
experiences of Rosa Ponselle, the dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera
Company of New York, who appears here in concert March 3. ,
Rosa Ponselle was born in Meriden, Connecticut. Her pipings became the
subject of comment on the part of the neighbors, for she was always singing.

The singer's first step toward fame was
when she secured a job in a local "nicke
lodeon. ' Each Saturday night she re
ceived twelve dollars for her week's
j work.
Fame Soon Spread
Miss Ponselle's fame soon spread, and.
! after investigating the reports of the
child wonder, the leading New Haven
hotel offered her the fabulous salary of
fifty dollars a week, and she set off on
the long road the end of which she did
not then even dream.
Rosa Ponselle's elder sister, Carmela.
in the meantime had entered "small time"
vaudeville. The two sisters finally joined
forces and appeared for about three years
on the Keith circuit, where, as the Pon
zille sisters, they became favorites. Rosa
became versed in the ways and traditions
of the stage and the lessons she learned
were of untold value to her when the
opportunity for her to try for the highest
honors that musical America offers came.
Tries for Opera
Ponselle's audition before Galli-Ca
sazza. casting director of the Metropoli
tan Opera Company, was the result of
a word that Caruso himself had given
him after hearing the young singer. After
he* tryout she was given a contract, al
though she had but six months to pre
pare her grand opera roles.
The singer's unheralded debut with
Caruso in "La Forza del Distino" was a
personal triumph, one which made Ameri
can musical history and disproved for all
time the fallacy that American-born sing
ers do not have voices comparable to
those of European artists. Miss Pon
selle's popularity did not pass'with suc
ceeding years, for the artist has remained
an outstanding success, particularly in
her late roles in the revival of "La Ves
tale," last season's greatest success.

her late roles in the revival of "La Ves
tale," last season's greatest success.
To find herself, at twenty-two, at the top of a hill which, two years before, had
not even been visible on the horizon; to pass mm the humblest obscurity to a
position of prestige and distinction; to become famous overnight, have been the
experiences of Rosa Ponselle, the dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera
Company of New York, who appears here in concert March 3. ,
Rosa Ponselle was born in Meriden, Connecticut. Her pipings became the
subject of comment on the part of the neighbors, for she was always singing.

The singer's first step toward fame was
when she secured a job in a local "nicke
lodeon. ' Each Saturday night she re
ceived twelve dollars for her week's
j work.
Fame Soon Spread
Miss Ponselle's fame soon spread, and.
! after investigating the reports of the
child wonder, the leading New Haven
hotel offered her the fabulous salary of
fifty dollars a week, and she set off on
the long road the end of which she did
not then even dream.
Rosa Ponselle's elder sister, Carmela.
in the meantime had entered "small time"
vaudeville. The two sisters finally joined
forces and appeared for about three years
on the Keith circuit, where, as the Pon
zille sisters, they became favorites. Rosa
became versed in the ways and traditions
of the stage and the lessons she learned
were of untold value to her when the
opportunity for her to try for the highest
honors that musical America offers came.
Tries for Opera
Ponselle's audition before Galli-Ca
sazza. casting director of the Metropoli
tan Opera Company, was the result of
a word that Caruso himself had given
him after hearing the young singer. After
he* tryout she was given a contract, al
though she had but six months to pre
pare her grand opera roles.
The singer's unheralded debut with
Caruso in "La Forza del Distino" was a
personal triumph, one which made Ameri
can musical history and disproved for all
time the fallacy that American-born sing
ers do not have voices comparable to
those of European artists. Miss Pon
selle's popularity did not pass'with suc
ceeding years, for the artist has remained
an outstanding success, particularly in
her late roles in the revival of "La Ves
tale," last season's greatest success.
