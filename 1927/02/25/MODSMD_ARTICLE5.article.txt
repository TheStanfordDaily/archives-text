# SCALPERS PAY BILL TO STANFORD QUAD; PRESERVE CHARTER
## 
### 
By paying to the Student Manager yes
terday the delinquent bill of $20 due last
year's Quad, Scalpers' Society retains its
charter, which was threatened by the Ex
ecutive Committee Wednesday night. Non
payment of this bill by March 1 would
have automatically cancellcd the charter
of the organization.
Inability to collecte dues from members
last year was alleged by Scalpers to be
the reason for failing to meet the Quad
payment.
Although the Executive Committee first
proposed to cancel the Scalpers dance to
morow night as a disciplinary measure,
they finally decided on the alternative of
revoking the charter unless payment of
the bill was made by March 1 on the
ground that the organization had violated
the spirit of the constitution as to prompt
settlement of obligations and compliance
with contracts.
