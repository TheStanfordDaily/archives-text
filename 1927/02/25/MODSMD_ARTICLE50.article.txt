# DEMPSEY SAYS LIFE OF ACTORS REQUIRES TRAINING, KEEPING FIT
## 
### 
"Motion picture acting requires 'train
ing and keeping fit,' just as boxing does,"
Jack Dempsey declared in a recent article j
I written especially for the Daily Prince- â– 
j tonian. "Those in the picture industry j
know that it is a strenuous existence and t
that day after day, week after week, the j
actor must appear before the cold, relent- i
less eye o fthe camera looking fresh and j
in perfect condition. Otherwise the lack
of 'pep' will register with surprising em
phasis.
"Co-ordination of the mind and body is j
absolutely essential in any successful line !
of work. Everyone's enjoyment of his'
profession, no matter what it is, depends
on his ability to keep fit. A boxed who !
did not like his work and who did not
anticipate some pleasure out of the im
pending fight, finds it almost impossible
to get into shape. This goes for the track j
athlete, the student, the football player,
and the motion picture actor."
