# VARSITY BOXERS WILL MEET OLYMPIC CLUB IN CITY RING TONIGHT
## Pacific Coast Featherweight Titleholder to Meet Captain Miron 
### 
Led by Captain Carlos Miron, who
will have the tough job of facing the
Pacific Coast featherweight titleholder
in the ring in the feature bout of the
evening, the Stanford varsity boxing
squad under Coach Harry W. Maloney
will engage the San Francisco Olym
pic Club in its gallery in the city this
evening at 8:15 o'clock.
Carrying in its membership some of
the best amateurs of the section, the
clubmen will send against the Cardi
nals the best-balanced squad in the
country.
Miron-Bernal
But leading them all in craftiness
and skill is Joe Bernal, who is to
face Miron. A week ago yesterday
Bernal decisively defeated Golden of
the Hollywood Athletic Club who was
then considered the Pacific, feather
titleholder. At the same time Miron
rose a notch in collegiate circles when
he took into camp the Far Western
champ, A1 Gomez, who had previously
defeated Miron. Thus with both fight
ers in the prime of their condition and
keyed for the clash, the fight should
attract considerable attention.
Three lightweight bouts send A.
Ros. T. Treanor, and H. Birch of Stan
ford against C. Simonini, A. Landucci,
and R. Guehring of the Winged "O"
at 135 pounds; Newton Ridley, who
has been coming up fast since the
recent Novice Tournament, will mix
with G. Malley at 147 pounds; Norman
Fain, for two years undefeated, will
face G. Dyer at 172 pounds; Richard
Dorman will be pitted against M. Mal
lory in the heavyweight scrap; and to
end the card, Myron Schall, last sea
son's varsity captain, who, after fight
ing for three years for Stanford, has
yet to meet defeat, will face J. Downey
at ICS pounds.
The fights will be run off according
to N.C.A.A. rules, with three two
minute rounds. Due to strict rulings
at the club, only those who have mem
bership or guest cards will be allowed
to witness the bouts.
