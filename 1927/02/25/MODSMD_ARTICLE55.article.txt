# MEIKLEJOHN PLANS EDUCATION TRIAL IN WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
In view of the adoption last year at
Stanford of the Independent Study Plan,
which releases upper division students
enrolled in it from the necessity of class
attendance, it is interesting to see that
Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, formerly
president of Amherst College, and rebel
in education, is now making an experi
ment under the auspices of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin in new processes of
education.
The faculty of the School of Letters
and Science has roped out an area within
the college itself large enough to accom
modate 250 students and an adequate
teaching staff. The professors will be
left absolutely free to choose their own
methods and may break all professorial
traditions. The lecture system will be
practically done away with, the professors
merely directing the reading and research
of the students.
Begins Next Year
It is not the purpose of the experimen
tal college, as in the Independent Study
Plan at Stanford, to make minor cur
ricular changes, or to elaborate some
new orientation course. It is an ex
periment in the content of college study
as well as the method of teaching.
The experiment, starting next year,
will enroll 125 freshmen and no sopho
mores, since it is felt that students must
take both years to get any value out of
the experiment.
Freshmen will elect to enter the ex
perimental college and must live during
the two years of its work within certain
dormitories in which their professors
will also have studies. Meiklejohn be
lieves that this easy access between stu
dent and professor will help study. The
students in the experimental school will
retain their regular status in the fresh
man and sophomore classes.
Lectures Inadequate
Meiklejolm's theories are that the stu
dent following the ordinary lecture and
reading of class-room work meets third
rate minds, and that by using the pro
fessor as guide rather than instructor,
he may use the greatest minds of all
(iges.
