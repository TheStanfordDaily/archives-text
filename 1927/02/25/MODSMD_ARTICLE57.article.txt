# ISLANDS DESIRE ONLY TEACHERS OF ENGLISH
## 
### 
Filipino teachers from the United
Stages who can not teach secondary
English are not needed in schools in
the Islands, the Bureau of Insular af
fairs announces in a circular letter,
which President Wilbur received last
week. The Philippine authorities state
that they can secure teachers of other
subjects from their own colleges with
less difficulty.
The Island Bureau of Education asks
that teachers coming from the United
States have twelve semester-hour
credits in English or its equivalent in
quarter-hour credits.
