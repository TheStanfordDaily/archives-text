# WARNER TO PUT MEN THROUGH SCRIMMAGE LATE THIS AFTERNOON
## Stiff Fights for Places in Line Loom With Many Candidates Out 
### 
Coach Pop Warner and his ytaff of
football aides-de-camp have scheduled
a practice scrimmage for this after
noon at 4:15 o'clock on the practice
field, if the weather permits. Winter
practice this year has largely been
held under adverse conditions, how
ever, so the men are growing accli
mated and have learned to keep their
feet more skillfully on the slippery
sod.
Indications that there will be a stiff
fight for places in the line on the 1927
varsity are arising from the fact that
there are several of last fall's linemen
out for practice at this season, where
as none of the old backfield has been
coming to the workouts, with the ex
ception of Trombetta. Hoffman and
Fleishacker are prevented from tak
ing part in scrimmages by their par
ticipation in track.
Linemen wearing moleskins these
days are Vermilya, Sellman, Artman,
Doyle, Worden, Davidson, and Ingram.
About nine of the 1926 gray squad are
out, including Macabee, Cook, Wilson,
Farrington, Montgomery, Miller. Wolf.
Bierer, and Snyder. Winek is a promis
ing freshman from San Diego who is
in his first quarter in the University.
Other members of 1930 on the field are
Driscoll, Clark, Heinecke, Murphy,
and Burke.
The squad is being taught the same
plays as were used by the varsity
last fall. When Tiny Thornhill was
asked if there was any likelihood that
Pop Warner would change his system
to any extent next fall to fit the ma
terial he will have, the big line coach
replied that Pop hadn't changed his
system in 30 ye4rs and probably would
not next season.
