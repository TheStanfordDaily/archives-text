# INSUFFICIENT FUNDS SETTLE HOPES FOR NEW ASSEMBLY HALL
## Present Structure Must Be Used Until More Gifts Are Received 
### 
For the past few months, Chaparral has
been asking, "What about a new Assembly
Hall?" And one student said that in it.-
present condition the hall, with its patched
green plaster walls and trellised ceiling,
resembles more a glorified beer garden
than a place to hold erudite entertainment
ranging from Citizenship lectures to mu
sical comedy and Molnar.
Professor Everett W. Smith said that
it is a recognized fact that a new audi
torium is needed, but that there is little
hope of building an-adequate one because
the funds on hand are insufficient. John
A. Sellards, secretary to the Stanford
Nationla Board, remarked, "Large mone
tary gifts are needed before the Univer
sity can erect a new Assembly Hall. Un
til they are obtained, the present one
will have to suffice."
Small Sum on Hand
Sellards said that there is a little money
on hand, but not nearly enough to cover
the large ocst of an adequate building.
There are between a hundred and a hun
dred and fifty thousand dollars in the War
Memorial Foundation, but the trouble in
this is that these funds were pledged for
a memorial auditorium acommodating
only 800. which would be too small a hall
to care for campus needs. There are also
about $16,000 that have been collected
from the Memorial Stadium pledges and
that may be used for any project the Uni
versity sees fit. Besides these amounts,
about $15,000. is being collected from bon
uses ex-service men have pledged to Stan
ford.
"The cost of a new auditorium has not
been computed, and no definite plans as to
type and location have been made," said
Sellards, "because nothing definite has
been decided about a new one."
Erected in 1898
The corner stone of the Assembly Hall
reads, "Erected by Mrs. Leland Stanford,
1898." Since that time it has served stren
uous duty, as it and the Little Theater are
the only two buildings on the campus
where lectures and plays may be given.
However, the hall is suitable only for
important plays and assemblies, while the
Little Theater often cannot accommodate
all those who come to the regular Tuesday
evening lectures.
The present building was built in a time
of financial stress for the University.
Funds were tied up in litigation, and Mrs.
Stanford recognizing the urgent need for
an assembly hall, built one out of her
personal account. "It was evident that she
was pressed for money," said Professor
Smith, "because the roofing at first con-,
sisted of tin tiles painted red. There are
still evidences of these original tiles on
some of the smaller, insignificant build
ings scattered around the campus in in
conspicuous places."
Gym Formerly Used
Tn the early years of the University,
plays often had to be given in the old En
cina gymnasium, which was situated in
the field near the place where the street
car tracks turn in back of Encina Hall.
"It was extremely difficult to do this."
Professor Smith said, "because all dra
matic work ha dto be squeezed in between
gym classes. After the last afternoon
class chairs and scenery had to be moved
in the building, the play was given, and
then everything had to be taken from the
gymnasium before the first classes the
next morning."
During the years of its service, the
Assembly Hall has been changed but lit
tle, the most radical being alterations to
the stage, such as extending it and raising
the flies. It has not been redecorated, but
fro mtime to time the curtains have been
changed each time getting a little better.
Th emoney that could be expended on the
building and equipment has always been
limited, and hence the improvements have
generally been delaye dand inadequate.

Stanford recognizing the urgent need for
an assembly hall, built one out of her
personal account. "It was evident that she
was pressed for money," said Professor
Smith, "because the roofing at first con-,
sisted of tin tiles painted red. There are
still evidences of these original tiles on
some of the smaller, insignificant build
ings scattered around the campus in in
conspicuous places."
Gym Formerly Used
Tn the early years of the University,
plays often had to be given in the old En
cina gymnasium, which was situated in
the field near the place where the street
car tracks turn in back of Encina Hall.
"It was extremely difficult to do this."
Professor Smith said, "because all dra
matic work ha dto be squeezed in between
gym classes. After the last afternoon
class chairs and scenery had to be moved
in the building, the play was given, and
then everything had to be taken from the
gymnasium before the first classes the
next morning."
During the years of its service, the
Assembly Hall has been changed but lit
tle, the most radical being alterations to
the stage, such as extending it and raising
the flies. It has not been redecorated, but
fro mtime to time the curtains have been
changed each time getting a little better.
Th emoney that could be expended on the
building and equipment has always been
limited, and hence the improvements have
generally been delaye dand inadequate.
For the past few months, Chaparral has
been asking, "What about a new Assembly
Hall?" And one student said that in it.-
present condition the hall, with its patched
green plaster walls and trellised ceiling,
resembles more a glorified beer garden
than a place to hold erudite entertainment
ranging from Citizenship lectures to mu
sical comedy and Molnar.
Professor Everett W. Smith said that
it is a recognized fact that a new audi
torium is needed, but that there is little
hope of building an-adequate one because
the funds on hand are insufficient. John
A. Sellards, secretary to the Stanford
Nationla Board, remarked, "Large mone
tary gifts are needed before the Univer
sity can erect a new Assembly Hall. Un
til they are obtained, the present one
will have to suffice."
Small Sum on Hand
Sellards said that there is a little money
on hand, but not nearly enough to cover
the large ocst of an adequate building.
There are between a hundred and a hun
dred and fifty thousand dollars in the War
Memorial Foundation, but the trouble in
this is that these funds were pledged for
a memorial auditorium acommodating
only 800. which would be too small a hall
to care for campus needs. There are also
about $16,000 that have been collected
from the Memorial Stadium pledges and
that may be used for any project the Uni
versity sees fit. Besides these amounts,
about $15,000. is being collected from bon
uses ex-service men have pledged to Stan
ford.
"The cost of a new auditorium has not
been computed, and no definite plans as to
type and location have been made," said
Sellards, "because nothing definite has
been decided about a new one."
Erected in 1898
The corner stone of the Assembly Hall
reads, "Erected by Mrs. Leland Stanford,
1898." Since that time it has served stren
uous duty, as it and the Little Theater are
the only two buildings on the campus
where lectures and plays may be given.
However, the hall is suitable only for
important plays and assemblies, while the
Little Theater often cannot accommodate
all those who come to the regular Tuesday
evening lectures.
The present building was built in a time
of financial stress for the University.
Funds were tied up in litigation, and Mrs.
Stanford recognizing the urgent need for
an assembly hall, built one out of her
personal account. "It was evident that she
