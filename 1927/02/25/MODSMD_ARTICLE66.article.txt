## 
### 
"It smells but it sells" was the catch- j
line on the front page of the "Red,
Herring," a scandal sheet published in
I the newspaper war at the University of 1
'Manitoba, Canada. Professing to deal I
with the "world, the flesh, and the
devil," the paper was published by five
! staff members of the "Manitoban," of- i
ficial students' newspaper, in an effort
to force the "Manitoba Student," an,
i independent publication, from the uni- J
versity campus.
The trouble all started when the edi-1
tor of the "Manitoban" was forced to I
; resign because he would not submit to
J editorial direction from the students',
council, which refused to be criticized
1 in the columns of the campus paper. l
The retired editor started an indepen- I
dent sheet which met with huge success >
among the students, and it was in an 1

effort to have it banned that the five
members of the regular staff issued the
ill-famed "Red Herring." University
authorities promptly confiscated all
available copies of the edition, and crim
inal libel suits were threatened against
the writers.
Among the charges hurled at the ex
editor and his friends who are publish
ing the independent paper were a num
ber of personal attacks. "Necking"
parties at council meetings and dra
matic rehearsals were hinted at, and
lurid accounts were given of students
being found "guzzling" in bootleggers'
"dives." Faculty members were not
spared, and the "Red Herring" carried
reports oi midnight parties staged in
the offices of professors in the theo
logical colleges. The suppressed issue
was printed on a bright red paper.
