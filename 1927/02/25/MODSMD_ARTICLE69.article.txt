## 
### 
"Music is not beneficial to patients un
dergoing surgical operations," claims Dr.
Arthur C. Morgan, profesor of applied
therapeutics in the Temple Medical School.
"Music has its place in the hospital, but
it should not be used in the operating
room. It disturbs the patient, surgeon,
and especially the nurses, in spite of
growing opinion to the contrary."
