# BOSTON'S FIGHTING GOB

### Feg Murray 
On October 6, 1902, the Coccoskey
family of Binghamton, New York, re
joiced because the stork had brought
them a baby boy. Pa Coccoskey was
especially proud of his new offspring.
"Look how huskey he is," he boasted,
"he'll be another Jim Jecries." (The
famous California boilermaker had
knocked out Bob Fitzsimmons for the
second time only a few months
before). "Sure," assented all the male
friends and relatives, "he'll be heavy
weight champion some day all right.
Hah! Hah!" But Pa Coccoskey, with
a far-off look in his eyes, decided to
name the baby John, which made him
eligible for the throne held by those
great warriors who had J initials. J.

j L. Sullivan, J. J. Corbett, J. J. Jeffries, [
J. Johnson, Jess Willard, "Jack Dernp
j sey," and J. J. Tunney.
Now we find John Coccoskey very
much grown up, and on the eve of a
fight that, if lost, will probably for
ever bar his way to the crown once
worn by Jim Jeffries. But, on the other
hand, if he wins decisively over Mike i
McTigue, the conqueror of Paul Berleu- :
bach,.next Thursday night, he will, no
doubt, be matched with the winner of'
the Maloney-Delaney bout and then
perhaps with the champion of the
world himself!
Jack Sharkey (he assumed the last j
name of the former sailor fighter, Tom
Sharkey, who was nearing his pugi

! listic "end of the trail" whfen John
. Coccoskey was born) has been the
subject of much discussion among
i fight fans because he only trains hard '
j for a fight that he thinks he can't
win easily, and has put up some very
poor as well as some very fine exhibi
| tions. The former gob's chief claim
i to fame is, of course, his victory over j
Harry Wills, which may seem to hold ,
rather lightly because Wills did look j
' so old and out of condition in that !
i bout. But didn't Sharkey make him :
look that way, and isn't the Boston !
I
j heavyweight a master boxer.
A perusal of Sharkey's ring record !
shows one or two fights that reflect no j
credit at all to the Boston Pole, but I

| you can say in his favor that he lost
no fights in 1926, and hence is im
proving with age. Romero Roj.as
' knocked him out, but that was in 1924.
Charlie Weinert and Bud Gorman beat
him, but that was in 1925. King Solo
mon, so they say, had him in a bad
j way in 1926, and McTigue knocked out
; the King, which gives Mike a good
j chance with Sharkey, doesn't it?
i My advice to you, Mr. Sharkey, is
I to work hard for Old Man McTigue,
: then work hard on him when you get
j in the ring with him, for you haven't
' so very much to gain by beating an
! old man twenty pounds lighter than
j'.vou are, and you have everything to
j lose if you fail to beat him.

A perusal of Sharkey's ring record !
shows one or two fights that reflect no j
credit at all to the Boston Pole, but I

| you can say in his favor that he lost
no fights in 1926, and hence is im
proving with age. Romero Roj.as
' knocked him out, but that was in 1924.
Charlie Weinert and Bud Gorman beat
him, but that was in 1925. King Solo
mon, so they say, had him in a bad
j way in 1926, and McTigue knocked out
; the King, which gives Mike a good
j chance with Sharkey, doesn't it?
i My advice to you, Mr. Sharkey, is
I to work hard for Old Man McTigue,
: then work hard on him when you get
j in the ring with him, for you haven't
' so very much to gain by beating an
! old man twenty pounds lighter than
j'.vou are, and you have everything to
j lose if you fail to beat him.

On October 6, 1902, the Coccoskey
family of Binghamton, New York, re
joiced because the stork had brought
them a baby boy. Pa Coccoskey was
especially proud of his new offspring.
"Look how huskey he is," he boasted,
"he'll be another Jim Jecries." (The
famous California boilermaker had
knocked out Bob Fitzsimmons for the
second time only a few months
before). "Sure," assented all the male
friends and relatives, "he'll be heavy
weight champion some day all right.
Hah! Hah!" But Pa Coccoskey, with
a far-off look in his eyes, decided to
name the baby John, which made him
eligible for the throne held by those
great warriors who had J initials. J.

j L. Sullivan, J. J. Corbett, J. J. Jeffries, [
J. Johnson, Jess Willard, "Jack Dernp
j sey," and J. J. Tunney.
Now we find John Coccoskey very
much grown up, and on the eve of a
fight that, if lost, will probably for
ever bar his way to the crown once
worn by Jim Jeffries. But, on the other
hand, if he wins decisively over Mike i
McTigue, the conqueror of Paul Berleu- :
bach,.next Thursday night, he will, no
doubt, be matched with the winner of'
the Maloney-Delaney bout and then
perhaps with the champion of the
world himself!
Jack Sharkey (he assumed the last j
name of the former sailor fighter, Tom
Sharkey, who was nearing his pugi

! listic "end of the trail" whfen John
. Coccoskey was born) has been the
subject of much discussion among
i fight fans because he only trains hard '
j for a fight that he thinks he can't
win easily, and has put up some very
poor as well as some very fine exhibi
| tions. The former gob's chief claim
i to fame is, of course, his victory over j
Harry Wills, which may seem to hold ,
rather lightly because Wills did look j
' so old and out of condition in that !

look that way, and isn't the Boston !
