# PLANS STARTED FOR PALO ALTO FOLDER, NEW TRAFFIC SIGNS
## 
### 
The publicity committee of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce at its first
meeting February 10 made preliminary
plaus for the publication of a new
Palo Alto folder and for the erection
of bill-board signs directing traffic
from the Dumbarton bridge to Palo
Alto.
Two members of the Real Estate
Board present at the meeting urged
that these signs be put up, as those j
installed by the Automobile Club were
thought to be inadequate in giving
exact directions to this city. It was
also claimed that the present signs
did not attract attention and motorists j
often passed by without seeing them. J
An ordinance has been passed in
Palo Alto that can prohibit the erec
tion of all signs, even "For Rent"
ones, without a permit. However, this !
ruling has not yet been strictly ap
plied.
The committee, which is under the
chairmanship of Pfofessor Everett W.
Smith, head of the Journalism divi
sion, has advisory power over all pub
licity of the Chamber of Commerce. '
