"Whatever Mussolini lias clone, he
has done not for himself or for per
sonal glory, but for Italy," said Pro
fessor McKenzie, of the Italian depart
ment at Princeton University, in a
recent defense of the policies of the
Italian dictator. "He wants the Ital
ians to be hard-working and industri
ous people and to have their rights
recognized by all.
"Mussolini has organized the gov- \
ernment into an efficient power con- 1
centrated in himself; he has reduced
the twenty-one Italian universities,
many inefficiently placed, to ten in
spots where they were greatly needed;
he has cut down expenses, and he
plans to make Italy a thoroughly pro
gressive nation."
Professor McKenzie likened Musso
lini to Napoleon, but says that the
modern dictator has succeeded with
out bloodshed, while Napoleon often
relied upon military violence. Some of
Mussolini's followers may have be
come hot-headed in their enthusiasm,
the Princeton man said, but few rash
deeds can be laid to the premier him
self.
