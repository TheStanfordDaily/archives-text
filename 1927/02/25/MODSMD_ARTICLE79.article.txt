# NORTHWESTERN PLANS TO EXTEND CAMPUS
## 
### 
Extension of the Northwestern Uni
versity campus a half-mile into what is
now Lake Michigan, is suggested in a
plan for the enlargement of the col
lege grounds recently submitted to
the authorities. Real estate men esti
mate the value of the land adjoining
the proposed project as worth $100,000.
The probable cost of filling in the lake
would be $25,000 per acre, but this
would be cheaper than buying city
land.
Special breakers would have to be
constructed to check the strong cur
rent, which has been eating away the
shore. Transportation of millions of
cubic yards of earth would be neces
sary, and the land would be filled in
by block units.
