# BAKU STRAW DECREED BY DAME FASHION AS NEW MILITARY NOTE
## 
### 
My friends, as I have told you, har
mony is the all important note for spring.
So do carry this over to your millinery—
let your hats be in all cases highly ap
propriate to the rest of your costume.
\\ hile felts are still in vogue, spring
ushers in with its straws a new one to
millinery circles. It is called baku, or
bacoup. Baku looks much like a linen
made of straw. It is very supple and also
lends itself well to the two o:>lor combi
nation that marks the chic of the new
hats.
Many of the hats are very small; one
popular model is entirely without a brim
and has a flared cuff effect across the
front. Long or square pins are worn to
give touch of distinction to this hat.
Others have a small brim in front which
is cut away to nothing in the back. You
may, however, find a brim to suit your
particular type of beauty, for Pari- de
crees many different kinds this year for
which we should all be duly grateful to
her. In broader brims is a light model
of baku trimmed with a darker velvet
band that is charming and immediately
makes me feel that the time of canoeing
and frozen orange juice is surely at hand.
