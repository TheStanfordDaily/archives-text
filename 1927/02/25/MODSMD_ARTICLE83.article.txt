# FIGHT MARKS ENCINA CAGE TOURNAMENT IN SEMI-FINAL CONTESTS
## McMurray, O'Donnell, and Wright Star in Games Played at Men's Gym 
### 
Encina 5, 21; Encina 4W, 7
Encina IW, 21; Encina 2E, 12
The Encina Hall basketball tourna
ment went to the semi-final play-off
yesterday afternoon in the gymna
sium, when the fifth and 1W -teams
defeated 4\V and 2E, respectively.
Both contests were hard-fought, the
scores failing to indicate the fights
put up by the losing squads.
In the first contest, the fifth floor
team showed some of the best play
seen in the series, and turned in a 21
to 7 victory over the fourth floor team.
At the start of the game both teams
were shooting baskets regularly, al
though a great deal of poor teamwork
whs displayed by both quintets. Mc-
Murray carried the brunt of the fifth
floor attack in this period, sinking five
points on two field goals and a foul
shot.
O'Donnell Outstanding
O'Donnell was the outstanding play
er on the 4W team in the first half,
with Milne and Pease showing some
floor work on both offense and defense,
and after the score had see-sawed
back and forth, the fifth floor came
out on top of a 9 to 6 score at the end
of the period.
Starting the last half, the winning
team found its eye, and although the
fourth floor guards put up a hard fight,
the opposing forwards were not to be
denied. In the middle of the period
Mainwaring, fifth floor forward, was
put out on personal fouls, and was
replaced by Tully. Three minutes later
Tully sprained his ankle, and since
there were no men to replace him, the
game was completed with but four
men on the squad. This setback did
not stop the scoring, however, and the
game ended with the victors adding 12
points to their score while their op
ponents were held to a lone tally.
Last Game Reverse
The final contest was a reverse of
the first game, Encina 2E coming back
strong in the second half although
held to two points in the first period.
Wright, Dail, and Mann of the 1W five
started a fast offensive attack from
the start of the game, and by steady
playing and fine shooting were able
to give their team a 13 to 2 lead at
half time.
W. Smith, center on the losing
squad, hit his stride in the last half,
dropping four field goals through the
hoop from directly under the basket
before the 1W guards could stop him.
Don Anderson added the other two
points to the 2E tally by shooting a
field goal from the side of the court.
Substitutions marred the teamwork
of the victorious team, twelve men
being used during the contest. W.
Smith was high-point man for the
afternoon with twelve points to bis
credit. --v
Semi-final games will be played next
Monday afternoon when Encina 2W
meets the fifth floor, and Encina 1W
plays the basement squad. All of the
winners in the series thus far have
displayed strong aggregations, al
though teamwork is lacking at times.
Final games will b£ played early next
month.

Encina 5, 21; Encina 4W, 7
Encina IW, 21; Encina 2E, 12
The Encina Hall basketball tourna
ment went to the semi-final play-off
yesterday afternoon in the gymna
sium, when the fifth and 1W -teams
defeated 4\V and 2E, respectively.
Both contests were hard-fought, the
scores failing to indicate the fights
put up by the losing squads.
In the first contest, the fifth floor
team showed some of the best play
seen in the series, and turned in a 21
to 7 victory over the fourth floor team.
At the start of the game both teams
were shooting baskets regularly, al
though a great deal of poor teamwork
whs displayed by both quintets. Mc-
Murray carried the brunt of the fifth
floor attack in this period, sinking five
points on two field goals and a foul
shot.
O'Donnell Outstanding
O'Donnell was the outstanding play
er on the 4W team in the first half,
with Milne and Pease showing some
floor work on both offense and defense,
and after the score had see-sawed
back and forth, the fifth floor came
out on top of a 9 to 6 score at the end
of the period.
Starting the last half, the winning
team found its eye, and although the
fourth floor guards put up a hard fight,
the opposing forwards were not to be
denied. In the middle of the period
Mainwaring, fifth floor forward, was
put out on personal fouls, and was
replaced by Tully. Three minutes later
Tully sprained his ankle, and since
there were no men to replace him, the
game was completed with but four
men on the squad. This setback did
not stop the scoring, however, and the
game ended with the victors adding 12
points to their score while their op
ponents were held to a lone tally.
Last Game Reverse
The final contest was a reverse of
the first game, Encina 2E coming back
strong in the second half although
held to two points in the first period.
Wright, Dail, and Mann of the 1W five
started a fast offensive attack from
the start of the game, and by steady
playing and fine shooting were able
to give their team a 13 to 2 lead at
half time.
W. Smith, center on the losing
squad, hit his stride in the last half,
dropping four field goals through the
hoop from directly under the basket
before the 1W guards could stop him.
Don Anderson added the other two
points to the 2E tally by shooting a
field goal from the side of the court.
Substitutions marred the teamwork
of the victorious team, twelve men
being used during the contest. W.
Smith was high-point man for the
afternoon with twelve points to bis
credit. --v
Semi-final games will be played next
Monday afternoon when Encina 2W
meets the fifth floor, and Encina 1W
plays the basement squad. All of the
winners in the series thus far have
displayed strong aggregations, al
though teamwork is lacking at times.
Final games will b£ played early next
month.
