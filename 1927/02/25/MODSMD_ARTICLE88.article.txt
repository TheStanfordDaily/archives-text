# MEET SATURDAY TO INDICATE PROSPECTS OF 1927 TRACK TEAM
## Varsity Has Hard Schedule Lined Up for Coming Cinder Season 
### 
Trials this afternoon and finals tomor
row are expected to put Stauford Uni
versity's 1927 track team before the pub
lic in a way that shoul dgive a fair idea
of what may be expected from the Cardi
nals this season. Tlie Interclass Track
Meet, open to every man in the Univer
sity, is to be held over this weekend. It
will be the first official meet of the year.
With the heavy schedule lined up for
the Stanford track men, and the stiff com
petition that will be offered not only by
California and Southern California, but
also by various club and athletic teams
that will be met, Coach Templeton is
looking for men who can bolster up any
of the events, either track or field. He
lias a strong field team already, but sev
eral of the track positions need strength
ening.
Sprints Important
The showing of Fred Richman, Dick
Hyland. and Fred Zombro in the sprints
will be watched with interest. Stanford
lost many points in the 100 and 220 last
year. Every point will count heavily this
season.
Clarence West and Ross Nichols will
push each other in the hurdles, with West
doped to beat Nichols in the lows, and
Nichols to win in the highs. If Swede
Leistner runs, for the Seniors or grads,
he should beat both.
Captain Babcock, Spencer, Syer, Mc-
Guire, in the 440; Moss, McKinnon, and
Dales in the half; Swain, Ranney, Gooden,
in the mile; are expected to show some
thing interesting in the way of running.
All of these men will be well to the fore
in their respective races. Aiken looks best
in the two mile, as Criley will not com
pete.
Biff Hoffman, Eric Krenz, Way,
Fleischhacker, Forster, Helmke, will have
a nice battle in the weight events.
Harlow, Joaquin, Shipkey, Sparling,
Goodcell. Graves, and Kibbe will throw
the javelin, Hulsman, Edmonds, Fon
taine. Carlsmith, Mainwaring, pole vault
ers, will strive to clear twelve feet.
Bob King and Tom Work, faced by the
6 feet 5 7-16 inch jump made last week
by Coggesliall of U.S.C., will have to get
plenty of spring to equal that mark.
Sid Meeks, Fred Zombro, Dyer. Laurit
zen. will be broad jumping good distances.

One or two of the freshmen are also ex
pected to turn in good leaps.
The relay will he only half a mile, so
not much of Stanford's prospects here can
be seen. In this event, as in all of the
events, the freshmen will be the dark
horses.
