# PRINCETON PROFESSOR DISCOVERS AUTHOR OF OLD FRENCH COMEDY
## 
### 
Tlte author of "Pathelin," a famous
French farce for centuries accepted as
anonymous, or vaguely attributed to
various writers, has at last been dis
covered. Professor Louis Cons of Prince
ton, formerly a member of the University
of California Summer Session, made this
discovery, two years after Professor Hol
brook of the University of California
French department had definitely estab
lished the date of composition or publi
cation as 1464.
"Pathelin" has long and universally
been recognized as the most important and
artistic comedy composed during the
whole period between Terence and Shake
speare (some 1760 years), but when and
by whom it was written had never been
determined. Holbrook's discovery of the
true date naturally simplified Con's diffi
cult problem of determining the author
ship, but only quite recently has this sec
ond investigator been able to publish his
complete evidence and proofs that the au
thor was in fact a monk, named Guillaume
Aleois, who was already known to have
composed two clever poems entitled ''Fain
tes dtt monte" or "Shams 6f this world."
and the "Blason de faluses amours."
Through his discovery that corresponding
passages in these three works have the
same verse numbers, Cons has established
the authorship beyond question, says Pro
fessor Holbrook in a review of "L'Auteur
de Pathelin," the book in which the Prince
ton professor presents his case.
