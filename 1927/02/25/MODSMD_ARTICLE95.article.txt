# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Each sport has its "iron men," and
hockey is no exception. Those harct
playing Boston Bruins, who have been
for some time threatening to lead
the American group of the National
Hockey League, and who played the
Rangers in New York last night, boast
as their most brilliant and fearless
player, 38-year-old Sprague Cleghorn,
who continues to defy both the rav
ages of Pop Time and the daily knocks
and bumps that go with one of the
most, dangerous sports.
For "Peg" Cleghorn, after twenty
years of hockey, is still shooting the
puck with that uncanny skill that
characterized his game back in 1010
when he and his brother Odie. now
manager and coach of the Pittsburgh
Pirates, played with the Renfrew Mil
lionares. Qleghorn joined the Mont
real Wanderers in 1912 and played a
prominent part in that team's win
ning of several world's titles.
Championship honors seemed to fol
low this "Big Train" just as they do
some ball players who wander from
club to club. "Peg" moved to Ottawa,
where he was again the main factor

The Bruins' Bruiser

in bringing post-season honors to his
team in victories over Seattle and then
j Vancouver. In 1924 and '25 he played
with Les Canadians, helping them to
win the world's title in the former
| year. Then he went to Boston, and
now the other teams in the N.H.L. are
very much aware of the fact that Mr.
Sprague Cleghorn is still with Boston.
So are the referees, and those who
keep record of the minutes spent by
the various players in the penalty
boxes. Like Abou Ben Adhem's, Cleg
horn's name usually leads all the rest
and not without reason. A tough baby,
this "Peg," who wields a wicked stick,
and who in a game with the Americans
in January 1926, assisted in disabling
Ken Randall, Red and Shorty Green,
Charley Langlois, and Eddie Bouch
| ard, for which he spent only eleven
i minutes in the "hoose-gow." But he
himself has suffered many an injury,
including broken ankles and wrists
j and a dislocated knee cap. More than
once this remarkable old man has been
labeled "Through," yet he always re
| covers and comes back for more. They
| grow 'em tough where he comes from.

in bringing post-season honors to his
team in victories over Seattle and then

with Les Canadians, helping them to
win the world's title in the former

now the other teams in the N.H.L. are
very much aware of the fact that Mr.

So are the referees, and those who
keep record of the minutes spent by
the various players in the penalty
boxes. Like Abou Ben Adhem's, Cleg

and not without reason. A tough baby,
this "Peg," who wields a wicked stick,
and who in a game with the Americans
in January 1926, assisted in disabling
Ken Randall, Red and Shorty Green,
Charley Langlois, and Eddie Bouch

i minutes in the "hoose-gow." But he
himself has suffered many an injury,

Each sport has its "iron men," and
hockey is no exception. Those harct
playing Boston Bruins, who have been
for some time threatening to lead
the American group of the National
Hockey League, and who played the
Rangers in New York last night, boast
as their most brilliant and fearless
player, 38-year-old Sprague Cleghorn,
who continues to defy both the rav
ages of Pop Time and the daily knocks
and bumps that go with one of the
most, dangerous sports.
For "Peg" Cleghorn, after twenty
years of hockey, is still shooting the
puck with that uncanny skill that
characterized his game back in 1010
when he and his brother Odie. now
manager and coach of the Pittsburgh
Pirates, played with the Renfrew Mil
lionares. Qleghorn joined the Mont
real Wanderers in 1912 and played a
