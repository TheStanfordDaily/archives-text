Many Fouis Called
There was a total of twenty-si:: fouls
called on both teams, indicating the
roughness that was exhibited by the
fornia center, gave way to Tripp early
Bears and Cards alike. Corbin, Cali
in the second half for four personal
fouls. On the next play, both Ander
son, Cardinal star guard, and Captain
Watson of California were forced out.
Each had three personal fouls, and a
double personal was called by Referee
Fred Needles after a flurry of ex
changed scrimmages under the Stan
ford goal. From there on, the tense
ness of the game was transmitted to
the spectators, electrifying the two
rival crowds, both seeming dissatisfied
at times with the decisions of the of
ficials.
Stanford inaugurated the scoring of
the contest on the first tip-off when
Bryant made good a free shot. Then
R. Dougery, Watson, and Corbin tal
lied six points for the Bears, giving
them a lead which they maintained
throughout the remainder of the play
ing periods. Bryant and Biaggini
raised the Cardinal total to 8 while
the California quintet counted five
more points, ending with a half-time
score of 11.
At the opening of the second half,
Christ and Vincenti replaced Bryant
and McCandless at the Cardinal for
ward positions. Christ played the
game of his life, making two beauti
fully placed shots within three min
utes after he was in play. He worked
well on the offense by his constant
shifting in working the ball down the
California court. On the defense his
scrappiness alone overcame tlie super
ior height of his opponents.
Bryant and McCandless were sent
in to take Christ's and Vincenti's
places. The first pair of forwards
showed up better than the latter did
at the opening minutes of the game.
Bryant made two field shots. This
brought Stanford up to within three
points of California's 21. The Bears,
by a series of fast rushes and accurate
passes, showed their first real court
ability and pulled away from Stanford
with Tripp, center, Butts and R. Dou
gery, forwards, doing the heavy scor
ing. Between them they made eight
points, using a double reverse passing
attack.
Dixon played a fast and rough de
fensive game for California. He was
in the midst of the fight all the time
and was responsible for strengthening
L he Bear defense. R. Dougery was
high-point man, scoring nine tallies
for California.
Coach Husky Hunt's men proved
their ability to get through the Cali
fornia guarding system but were un
able to find the basket. They had more
tries for the basket than their oppo
nents but could not get the necessary
twist to send in the ball. One cause
for their lack of accuracy was that
they made too many hurry shots with
out taking time to get set for the
throw. The score:

There was a total of twenty-si:: fouls
called on both teams, indicating the
roughness that was exhibited by the
fornia center, gave way to Tripp early
Bears and Cards alike. Corbin, Cali
in the second half for four personal
fouls. On the next play, both Ander
son, Cardinal star guard, and Captain
Watson of California were forced out.
Each had three personal fouls, and a
double personal was called by Referee
Fred Needles after a flurry of ex
changed scrimmages under the Stan
ford goal. From there on, the tense
ness of the game was transmitted to
the spectators, electrifying the two
rival crowds, both seeming dissatisfied
at times with the decisions of the of
ficials.
Stanford inaugurated the scoring of
the contest on the first tip-off when
Bryant made good a free shot. Then
R. Dougery, Watson, and Corbin tal
lied six points for the Bears, giving
them a lead which they maintained
throughout the remainder of the play
ing periods. Bryant and Biaggini
raised the Cardinal total to 8 while
the California quintet counted five
more points, ending with a half-time
score of 11.
At the opening of the second half,
Christ and Vincenti replaced Bryant
and McCandless at the Cardinal for
ward positions. Christ played the
game of his life, making two beauti
fully placed shots within three min
utes after he was in play. He worked
well on the offense by his constant
shifting in working the ball down the
California court. On the defense his
scrappiness alone overcame tlie super
ior height of his opponents.
Bryant and McCandless were sent
in to take Christ's and Vincenti's
places. The first pair of forwards
showed up better than the latter did
at the opening minutes of the game.
Bryant made two field shots. This
brought Stanford up to within three
points of California's 21. The Bears,
by a series of fast rushes and accurate
passes, showed their first real court
ability and pulled away from Stanford
with Tripp, center, Butts and R. Dou
gery, forwards, doing the heavy scor
ing. Between them they made eight
points, using a double reverse passing
attack.
Dixon played a fast and rough de
fensive game for California. He was
in the midst of the fight all the time
and was responsible for strengthening
L he Bear defense. R. Dougery was
high-point man, scoring nine tallies
for California.
Coach Husky Hunt's men proved
their ability to get through the Cali
fornia guarding system but were un
able to find the basket. They had more
tries for the basket than their oppo
nents but could not get the necessary
twist to send in the ball. One cause
for their lack of accuracy was that
they made too many hurry shots with
out taking time to get set for the
throw. The score:

Many Fouis Called
There was a total of twenty-si:: fouls
called on both teams, indicating the
roughness that was exhibited by the
fornia center, gave way to Tripp early
Bears and Cards alike. Corbin, Cali
in the second half for four personal
fouls. On the next play, both Ander
son, Cardinal star guard, and Captain
Watson of California were forced out.
Each had three personal fouls, and a
double personal was called by Referee
Fred Needles after a flurry of ex
changed scrimmages under the Stan
ford goal. From there on, the tense
ness of the game was transmitted to
the spectators, electrifying the two
rival crowds, both seeming dissatisfied
at times with the decisions of the of
ficials.
Stanford inaugurated the scoring of
the contest on the first tip-off when
Bryant made good a free shot. Then
R. Dougery, Watson, and Corbin tal
lied six points for the Bears, giving
them a lead which they maintained
throughout the remainder of the play
ing periods. Bryant and Biaggini
raised the Cardinal total to 8 while
the California quintet counted five
more points, ending with a half-time
score of 11.
At the opening of the second half,
Christ and Vincenti replaced Bryant
and McCandless at the Cardinal for
ward positions. Christ played the
game of his life, making two beauti
fully placed shots within three min
utes after he was in play. He worked
well on the offense by his constant
shifting in working the ball down the
California court. On the defense his
scrappiness alone overcame tlie super
ior height of his opponents.
Bryant and McCandless were sent
in to take Christ's and Vincenti's
places. The first pair of forwards
showed up better than the latter did
at the opening minutes of the game.
Bryant made two field shots. This
brought Stanford up to within three
points of California's 21. The Bears,
by a series of fast rushes and accurate
passes, showed their first real court
ability and pulled away from Stanford
with Tripp, center, Butts and R. Dou
gery, forwards, doing the heavy scor
ing. Between them they made eight
points, using a double reverse passing
attack.
Dixon played a fast and rough de
fensive game for California. He was
in the midst of the fight all the time
and was responsible for strengthening
L he Bear defense. R. Dougery was
high-point man, scoring nine tallies
for California.
Coach Husky Hunt's men proved
their ability to get through the Cali
fornia guarding system but were un
able to find the basket. They had more
tries for the basket than their oppo
nents but could not get the necessary
twist to send in the ball. One cause
for their lack of accuracy was that
they made too many hurry shots with
out taking time to get set for the
throw. The score:
