# 1930 Players Down City Baseball Outfit in Easy Five-Inning Match
## 
### Bob Speers, '30 
Stanford's FRESHMAN baseball j
nine came through for its first victory j
Saturday morning by neatly whipping I
Lowell High School's aggregation 9'
to 3 in five innings of hectic baseball.
The San Francisco team was clearly |
outclassed in all departments and the ;
winners presented a smoothly work-!
ing machine.
Leverenz, Card moundsman, pitched
steady ball, showing remarkable pro
ficiency in getting out of holes. He
struck out five opposing batsmen and |
allowed only three hits. He let but two ■
men get to first by the base-on-balls
route. Brennen, Valianos, and Wright,
the Lowell pitchers, had very little to
show. They fanned three FRESHMEN
and walked four. The winners brought
in seven hits.
Leverenz Fans Two
In the first inning Leverenz made i
short work of the opposition by fan
ning the two initial batters. The third I
out*came when Storey caught a pop
fly to second. Levin, who led off t'or
Stanford, started the scoring when he
reached home after being walked to
first. Bianchi almost scored, also, but
finished on third when Berg's liner
was caught by the Lowell third-base
man.
Bianchi and Laird both succeeded in
circling the bases in the third, but
two Lowell runs also came in. Leve
renz did his poorest work by letting
six visitors come up to the plate.
Stanford took advantage of the op
position's colossally bad pitching in
the fourth by slipping in four tallies.
Valianos, a southpaw, occupied the
box for the San Francisco team and
hurled the ball with much vigor but
little accuracy. He walked two and
allowed two hits. Eight FRESHMEN
succeeded in getting to the plate.
Outfield Efficient
In the fifth and last inning Stanford
scored two runs and Lowell made one.
The performance of the Cardinal out
field was one of the features of the
game. They covered the ground with
speed and efficiency, turning in a per
fect average.

Bianchi and Laird both succeeded in
circling the bases in the third, but
two Lowell runs also came in. Leve
renz did his poorest work by letting
six visitors come up to the plate.
Stanford took advantage of the op
position's colossally bad pitching in
the fourth by slipping in four tallies.
Valianos, a southpaw, occupied the
box for the San Francisco team and
hurled the ball with much vigor but
little accuracy. He walked two and
allowed two hits. Eight FRESHMEN
succeeded in getting to the plate.
Outfield Efficient
In the fifth and last inning Stanford
scored two runs and Lowell made one.
The performance of the Cardinal out
field was one of the features of the
game. They covered the ground with
speed and efficiency, turning in a per
fect average.

Stanford's FRESHMAN baseball j
nine came through for its first victory j
Saturday morning by neatly whipping I
Lowell High School's aggregation 9'
to 3 in five innings of hectic baseball.
The San Francisco team was clearly |
outclassed in all departments and the ;
winners presented a smoothly work-!
ing machine.
Leverenz, Card moundsman, pitched
steady ball, showing remarkable pro
ficiency in getting out of holes. He
struck out five opposing batsmen and |
allowed only three hits. He let but two ■
men get to first by the base-on-balls
route. Brennen, Valianos, and Wright,
the Lowell pitchers, had very little to
show. They fanned three FRESHMEN
and walked four. The winners brought
in seven hits.
Leverenz Fans Two
In the first inning Leverenz made i
short work of the opposition by fan
ning the two initial batters. The third I
out*came when Storey caught a pop
fly to second. Levin, who led off t'or
Stanford, started the scoring when he
reached home after being walked to
first. Bianchi almost scored, also, but
finished on third when Berg's liner
was caught by the Lowell third-base
man.
