# MURAL CHAMPIONSHIP ANNEXED BY SIG CHI'S OVER BREAKERS FIVE
## Bad Passing, Close Defense Feature Final Contest; Fred Bowers Stars 
### 
Sigma Chi's basketball team won
its way to the championship of tlie
intramural series by sheer force and
the shooting of Fred Bowers, downing
the Breakers 16 to 9 in tlie final game
j of the tournament Saturday night.
Cook first put the Breakers in the
I lead by sinking a shot from near the
I foul line. Throughout the game lie
! threatened to sink a great many others
i from the same place, but his scores
j did not excel two field goals. MacDon
j aid dropped in another shot for the
I clubmen, putting them four points in
, the lead.
Fred Bowers, who had hardly tried
; for the basket, suddenly made one of
those shots from the middle of the
floor that have won him the honor of
high-point, man during the past weeks,
and started the Sigma Chi's off on
their scoring. Cook made another
i tally, but Brady of the rowmen tied
! the score C to C with two short throws
! just before the end of the half.
I The second half featured a glorious
j tussle between Bowers and Ilarldw,
: with the former winning out*. He
i started with a shot from center, a
free .throw, and another long shot, also
from the center. The Breakers, never
theless, did not ever give up their
hard fight. Harlow, who replaced Mac
i donald, made a basket, while Worden
| sank a free throw. These three points,
; with the six fouls that were called on
two Breaker players, completed the
| scoring of the losers.
Meanwhile, Bowers dropped in an-
I other shot, this time from the side of
the floor; Farmer contributed one foul
; shot, and Brady added two more. The
! game ended with Sigma Chi ahead by
j 1G to 9.
Mac Donald, Harlow, George, and
Harris, the Breaker guards, and Lar
sen and McClelland, who formed the
i Sigma Chi defense, gave the best ex
; liibition of guarding that has yet been
j seen in the intramural play. Cook and
George were slightly superior to the
! fraternity forwards, Farmer and
J Brady, in everything but their scoring
j ability.
