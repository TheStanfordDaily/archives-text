# FRESHMEN EASILY WIN FOURTH TRACK PLACE IN INTERCLASS MEET
## 
### 
FRESHMEN 18
Juniors 29 1-3
Sophomores .. 29 1-2
Seniors 54 1-6
By scoring in every event except
the half- and two-mile runs and the
broad jump, the senior track squad
won the annual interclass track meet
held last Friday and Saturday.
FRESHMEN Work Hard
Through the efforts of six hard
working FRESHMEN, the Class of
1930 was able to collect enough points
to win fourth place. Second and third
place was hotly contested by the jun
iors and sophomores, the latter finally
emerging victorious by one-sixth of a
point. Seven events were bettered over
last year's results, six were not as
good, and two were tied.
Fred Richman and Hugo "Swede"
Leistner were the only double-event
winners, Richman speeding through
both dashes to take the century in 10
seconds flat and the furlong in 22 1-5,
while Leistner broke the tape ahead
