## 
### 
FRESHMEN 18
Juniors 29 1-3
Sophomores .. 29 1-2
Seniors 54 1-6
By scoring in every event except
the half- and two-mile runs and the
broad jump, the senior track squad
won the annual interclass track meet
held last Friday and Saturday.
FRESHMEN Work Hard
Through the efforts of six hard
working FRESHMEN, the Class of
1930 was able to collect enough points
to win fourth place. Second and third
place was hotly contested by the jun
iors and sophomores, the latter finally
emerging victorious by one-sixth of a
point. Seven events were bettered over
last year's results, six were not as
good, and two were tied.
Fred Richman and Hugo "Swede"
Leistner were the only double-event
winners, Richman speeding through
both dashes to take the century in 10
seconds flat and the furlong in 22 1-5,
while Leistner broke the tape ahead
I of West and Nichols in the order
named in botli hurdle races. Emerson
Spencer nosed out Captain Lawrence
Babcock in the quarter-mile in the
fairly good time of 49 4-5 seconds. Gib
sou Kingsbury, FRESHMAN sprint
hope, collected four points for his
| class by placing third in the 100 and
second in the 220. Morrison, another
I FROSH, took third in the 440.
Edmunds Wins
Ward Edmunds won the pole vault
: with a leap of 12 feel, ti inches. Dyer
barely managed to beat Virgil Dowell,
1930, in the broad jump, leaping a
scant 3-4 inch beyond the FRESH
MAN'S best mark.
Creditable distances wen* uiade in
till weight events. Joaijuin won the
javelin with a heave of 195 feet 10
inches. "Biff" Hoffman and Eric Krenz
contested for the shot and discus
events. The big varsity man had too
much push for Kren?, who is in his
first year here, and won the shot
event. The FRESHMAN evened things
up by winning the discus throw with
i a remarkable twirl of 146 feet, 4

inches. The world's record is but little
more than 10 feet farther than the
distance which the burly FRESHMAN
threw the discus. Krenz should prove
a most valuable addition to Coach
"Dink" Templeton's sporting array,
both in FRESHMAN competition this
year and varsity later.
Although the FRESHMEN only
placed fourth, a number of the times
and distances made by them proved
that some real track timber is con
tained in the Class of '30 and with u
little more time and development it
should come to the surface in no
uncertain manner.
