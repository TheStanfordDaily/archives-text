# May We Present—
## 
### 
Once in each year the first-year journalists are given the privilege
to play with a perfectly staid and sober newspaper. At this time they
may write what they like, and write only what they like. They are,
moreover, allowed to tell any and all tipperclassmen what to do and what
not to do. Unfortunately they are not always entirely successful in the
latter enterprise.
Therefore, we now present to you the FRESHMAN edition, and
ask your verbal approval or silent disgust. We have demonstrated con
clusively to ourselves that putting out a perfectly normal Daily, four
pages long, with seven columns to a page, has its perils and its pleasures.
We must admit, however, that we have learned a great deal about
journalism and that, excusing our conceit by the general upperclass
opinion of FRESHMAN arrogance, seems to he the important tiling.
Of course we have our apologies to make. We beg to be excused for
making a certain remark when we slammed the door in the face of the
regular women's editor. We are very sorry that we used this special
shade of light sky-blue green. We are apologizing for our late copy,
our misspelled words, and for swearing at the printer. But all this is
mere editorializing—allow us—the FRESHMAN edition!
