Victor West is dead. The loss to the University as a whole and to
the students individually is great. As head of the Political Science
Department and Chairman of the Citizenship Committee, having in
charge the maintenance of the Citizenship division, his work was in
valuable.
His reputation as an authority on the subject with which he dealt—
that of political science—is widespread. His work along these lines is
nationally recognized, as is evidenced by his appointment to numerous
government commissions.
The spirit with which he undertook his work was a vital one. His
independence was a by-word. He tried to inculcate in his students the
ideal freedom of thought—that ideal which is the basic principle of our
government, but which is often lost sight of in this age of intrigue.
Public sentiment meant nothing to him. He was fearless in his
denunciation of any political policy which he truly considered to be
detrimental to the best interests of the whole. This spirit of fearlessness
he attempted to transmit to his classes, and succeeded in the attempt.
The campus mourns the passing of one of the most brilliant and
undaunted of its educators. To truly show our sincerity, we can pay
tribute to his memory by perpetuating,his ideals. —W.F.A.
