# HOLMAN-OGDEN LOSE FOUR STRAIGHT SETS TO DAVIES-STRATFORD
## 
### Louis Lieber, '30 
The treat promised campus tennis
fans last Saturday actually turned out
to be a treat for Jim Davies and Jerry
Stratford, when this pair of tennis
wizards defeated Cranston Holman
and Lionel Ogden in four straight
sets, 6-1, 9-7, 6-4, 8-6, on the new var
sity courts.
Davies and Stratford were taking
the place of Peck Qricen and Ray
Casey, who had previously been sched
uled to play. Davies is a former Stan
ford tennis star and, paired with Phil
Neer, won the National Intercollegiate
doubles championship in 1922. Strat
ford for the past two years has been
number two man on the University of
California tennis squad and is also
rated as the second best singles player
in the state.
In the first set of the encounter, the
Stanford players, who are ranked at
second place in intercollegiate doubles
listings, were unable to work together
properly and were caught out of posi
tion several times with the result that
their opponents made short work of
this set.
Picking up at the beginning of the
second set, the ranking University
doubles team began to function better.
Several times during the second set
the Stanford men were leading, but
each time, through their own errors
and the ability of the visiting aces to
bring forth skilful playing in the
pinches, the Cardinals lost the set.
Holman and Ogdeu were, far from
being in their best form, and both
missed a number of strokes that
should have been good. The former'Â« ,

service was always dangerous, ami I
Ogden was often stroking to perfec
tion. On the whole their tonnis was
too erratic to win from the at earlier
visitors. Long rallies were not fro-
quent, but a number of fnst volleys at
the net brought applause from the
spectators.
Stratford and Davies were most ef
fective at the net. It was this ability, j
coupled with their opponents' errors,
that enabled them to win the match, j
