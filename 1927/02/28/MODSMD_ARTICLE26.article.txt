"Kissing does not shorten life, and
physicians who say every kiss takes
three minutes from the length of a
human's life are mistaken," states Dr.
Thaddeus L. Bolton, head of the Psych
ology department at Temple Univer
sity.
"It is true that every motion above
the ordinary accelerates the heart's
action, but if the motion is persisted
in it loses its effect on the heart. The
length of the kiss determines the
length of time it will take the heart
to recover its normal stride."
As far as he knows, Dr. Bolton can
find only two men who have died from
kissing. Both deaths were caused by
exhaustion. Neither of the men were
Americans. "It is good for the heart
to be kept on its toes, since it stimu
lates its action," Dr. Bolton concludes.
