Hardie Gramatky, '30, submits the
above sketch as symbolic of the
FRESHMAN class. The central figure
represents the Spirit of the Class.
That Spirit has been criticized.
It has been said that the FRESH
MAN is arrogant because he has j
banned the dink as a lowly and super- j
fiuous accessory; lie uses tobacco in
any form that his carefree heart de- :
sires instead of following the dictates
of a vestigial tradition that he must

inhale the weed from a hollowed piece
of corn-cob. He queens on the Quad.
lie disregards the silly conventions
that forbid these acts, and refuses to
make an ass of himself. Upperclass
men are shocked. From their heights
, of sophistry they would squelch the
j spirit of *30. But the FRESHMEN have
i courage.
All of the types represented by the
artist are loyal to their class and to
Stanford. 1930 offers no apologies!
