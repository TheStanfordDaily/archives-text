THE DIARY OtF A FRESHMAN, by]
Charles Macomb Flandrau. Double- j
day, Page.
It seems like a special favor from
heaven that a book of*this sort should
comp into our hands at this particular!
time. Here are the most extraordinary |
and romantic adventures that any I
FRESHMAN, could desire, written in
a quite plausible style. Despite the |
fact that the locale is Harvard, and
that such scrapes probably never
would occur outside of the movies, the
book is one of great interest. Naive,
but not in the Anita Loos fashion
(although the hero did say once that
he felt "everything would turn out
for the best"), the writer has succeed-j
ed in giving a screamingly funny yet;
realistic portrayal of the trials and |
tribulations of the first-year man.
Dedicated to the "For Ever Panting i
and For Ever Young," the diary gets j
away with a running start with the j
description of Mamma's solicitude for ;
the welfare of the innocent lamb led j
to the slaughter. Mamma, it seemed, j
had the fixed idea that Cranny Wood
came to college for the express pur
pose of getting his feet wet by day,
and sleeping in a draught by night.
From the first chapter, the story i
builds up to the election of the hero !
to the Dickey, the great sophomore j
secret society at Harvard, whose an-1
tics you may have glimpsed in the j

j "Brown of Harvard" film.
Everything that could possibly hap
pen, and much more, is thrown in the
path of poor Cranny. Class rushes,
I football captains, seminars, feverish
cramming for examinations, chorus
: girls, probation, pawnshops, and an
all-night struggle through a snowstorm
which rivals the best efforts of Lillian
| Gish, are crammed between the covers
of this book. The cleverest part, in
our estimation, is the climax where
the Dickey "running" is described in
considerable detail. Stanford FRESH
MEN should be thankful that they
don't half to rise up in the midst of a
crowded theater and shout, "This
show is bum, and 1 want my money
; back!" Or that they are not immersed
;in perfume and ordered to disrupt
j stree -car service by smelling out all
j the passengers and throwing tits in
\ the Jloor of the cars, foaming at the
I mouth and clawing at the feet of the
; frightened occupants. Or holding up
[ baby carriages and kissing the occu
j pants (our hero osculated fifty-six in
| fanta one afternoon), or a chase
through public parks with a little bow
| and arrow, shouting, "Bangâ€”and an
other redskin bit the dust!"
Better read the Diary yourself, and
I if Stanford seems traditionless, per
j haps the FRESIIMEN will appreciate
! it all the more when they learn the
I misery their eastern cousins endure.
