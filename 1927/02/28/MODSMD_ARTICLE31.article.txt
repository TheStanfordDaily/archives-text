. The Editor, Sir:
It would not be appropriate for us
who knew Victor West to praise him
; in extravagant terms. He would not
like it; one of the things most cliar
! aeteristic of him was his modesty.
And we who knew him best revere
I him not for what he did, but. for what
| he was.
• Mr. West was a critic. 1 have never
heard him praise a man to his face,
| nor speak ill of a man to his back.
His favorite expression was, "How do
you know that?" His hobby was the
, scientific method in politics and he
! insisted that we all must subordinate
. ourselves to the facts, just as he did.
He was always unsparingly frank in
i telling us when we were wrong.
Mr. West was not the idol of the
| University. He would much rather in
spire the few than be applauded by
i the many. It was not easy to really
know him. But to those whom he did
admit to his real self, he gave of his
1 time and thought without reserve. It
was his custom to invite a group of
men to come to his home every other
Friday evening, to sit and talk. I have
! seen thvm forego games and dances
I and entertainments in order not to
miss an evening at Vic's. And we have
many times agreed that long after
memories of classrooms have faded
' and facts so important at examination
( time forgotten, those evenings will re
main as beautiful memories of what
was the very best part of our college
: life. It was only two weeks ago that
' we met him there for the last time.
Now we will not see him again. His
going is too recent for us to realize
jit u full significance. But that political)

i science building will be empty without
the sound of his voice and that inner
i office will be vacant without his pres
| ence. We are crushed with the cruelty
of his going just when we needed him
so much. The years will be many, in
deed, when the recollection of him
and (hose ways so peculiarly his begin
I to dim. Why, right now I can see him
| lean across the table in a seminar
class, interrupt a student's report to
aslc, "How do you know that?" That
is the way he would wish to be re
membered.
I But in our efforts to console our
selves we should be selfish indeed
were we to forget those whom he
loved best and who loved him best.
: The awful part of it is that nothing
we can do or say can in slightest
[ measure assuage their grief. He is
! gone. —A Student of His.

| The Editor, Sir:
Through your columns T would like
to call the attention of the Associated
Students in general and the director
I of the Stanford eating halls in particu
j lar to another of the unceasing wor
ries of the freshman class. This time,
} I would like to prestyit a bit of criti
! cism on an unpalatable subject—the
| food served at Encina Commons.
As all men living at the university
| more than a year know, it is compul
j sory for the Stanford freshman to eat
J all of his meals at the Commons din
ing halls, and in return for this "priv
j ilege," pnys $1.00 per day. In compari
! son with a hotel or restaurant, this
charge is very reasonable. But when
the food given the freshmen is cones
poudingly rotten, I feel that some ac-1

tion should be taken.
The consistently poor food offered
the freshmen caused a small investi
gation to be carried on by several of
the more inquisitive sufferers with
the following results:
According to a member of the Board
of Control, there was a profit of ap
proximately $1,000 made by the Com
mons during the last, quarter. The in
vestigators were also informed that
between fifty and sixty cents on every
dollar was used tp cover overhead ex
pense. In other words, from $200 to
$300 per day, or from $1400 to $2100
per week is spent to cover expenses.
As any normal minded person can see,
such expense is entirely beyond rea
son.
Furthermore, with the daily profit
made by the Commons taken into con
sideration, each student finally has
about forty cents on his dollar spent
on his food each day. And such an
amount can hardly be considered suf
ficient to feed a Stanford freshman.
More investigation discloses a state
ment by a well-known Palo Alto physi
cian that practically all of the fresh
men coming to him for attention com
plain of stomach trouble that could
be caused by no other thing than the
Commons food.
I have no doubt that this matter has
been brought up time and again by
other freshmen in past years. But
these same men are now living at
fraternity houses or eating at the
various campus clubs, and actually
getting their money's worth. The
question to be answered thus resolves
itself into a consideration of the ex
penditure of the money paid by every
freshman for food that may justly be
flattered by being classified under
such a name.
Finally, I see no reason why Encina
Commons, with its great buying pow
er, with student service, and with the
compulsory support of the men in the
freshman class, should not improve
the quality of the food served, or as
an alternative give refunds based on
the profits cleared.

know him. But to those whom he did

Through your columns T would like
to call the attention of the Associated
Students in general and the director
I of the Stanford eating halls in particu
j lar to another of the unceasing wor
ries of the freshman class. This time,
} I would like to prestyit a bit of criti
! cism on an unpalatable subject—the
| food served at Encina Commons.
As all men living at the university
| more than a year know, it is compul
j sory for the Stanford freshman to eat
J all of his meals at the Commons din
ing halls, and in return for this "priv
j ilege," pnys $1.00 per day. In compari
! son with a hotel or restaurant, this
charge is very reasonable. But when
the food given the freshmen is cones
poudingly rotten, I feel that some ac-1

tion should be taken.
The consistently poor food offered
the freshmen caused a small investi
gation to be carried on by several of
the more inquisitive sufferers with
the following results:
According to a member of the Board
of Control, there was a profit of ap
proximately $1,000 made by the Com
mons during the last, quarter. The in
vestigators were also informed that
between fifty and sixty cents on every
dollar was used tp cover overhead ex
pense. In other words, from $200 to
$300 per day, or from $1400 to $2100
per week is spent to cover expenses.
As any normal minded person can see,
such expense is entirely beyond rea
son.
Furthermore, with the daily profit
made by the Commons taken into con
sideration, each student finally has
about forty cents on his dollar spent
on his food each day. And such an
amount can hardly be considered suf
ficient to feed a Stanford freshman.
More investigation discloses a state
ment by a well-known Palo Alto physi
cian that practically all of the fresh
men coming to him for attention com
plain of stomach trouble that could
be caused by no other thing than the

the following results:
According to a member of the Board
of Control, there was a profit of ap
proximately $1,000 made by the Com
mons during the last, quarter. The in
vestigators were also informed that
between fifty and sixty cents on every
dollar was used tp cover overhead ex
pense. In other words, from $200 to
$300 per day, or from $1400 to $2100
per week is spent to cover expenses.
As any normal minded person can see,
such expense is entirely beyond rea
son.
Furthermore, with the daily profit
made by the Commons taken into con
sideration, each student finally has
about forty cents on his dollar spent
on his food each day. And such an
amount can hardly be considered suf
ficient to feed a Stanford freshman.
More investigation discloses a state
ment by a well-known Palo Alto physi
cian that practically all of the fresh
men coming to him for attention com
plain of stomach trouble that could
be caused by no other thing than the
Commons food.
I have no doubt that this matter has
been brought up time and again by
other freshmen in past years. But
these same men are now living at
fraternity houses or eating at the
various campus clubs, and actually
getting their money's worth. The
question to be answered thus resolves
itself into a consideration of the ex
penditure of the money paid by every
freshman for food that may justly be
flattered by being classified under
such a name.
Finally, I see no reason why Encina
Commons, with its great buying pow
er, with student service, and with the
compulsory support of the men in the
freshman class, should not improve
the quality of the food served, or as
an alternative give refunds based on
the profits cleared.

It would not be appropriate for us
who knew Victor West to praise him
; in extravagant terms. He would not
like it; one of the things most cliar
! aeteristic of him was his modesty.
And we who knew him best revere
I him not for what he did, but. for what
| he was.
• Mr. West was a critic. 1 have never
heard him praise a man to his face,
| nor speak ill of a man to his back.
His favorite expression was, "How do
you know that?" His hobby was the
, scientific method in politics and he
! insisted that we all must subordinate
. ourselves to the facts, just as he did.
He was always unsparingly frank in
i telling us when we were wrong.
Mr. West was not the idol of the
| University. He would much rather in
spire the few than be applauded by
i the many. It was not easy to really
know him. But to those whom he did
admit to his real self, he gave of his
1 time and thought without reserve. It
was his custom to invite a group of
men to come to his home every other
Friday evening, to sit and talk. I have
! seen thvm forego games and dances
I and entertainments in order not to
miss an evening at Vic's. And we have
many times agreed that long after
memories of classrooms have faded
' and facts so important at examination
( time forgotten, those evenings will re
main as beautiful memories of what
was the very best part of our college
: life. It was only two weeks ago that
' we met him there for the last time.
Now we will not see him again. His
going is too recent for us to realize
jit u full significance. But that political)

i science building will be empty without
the sound of his voice and that inner
i office will be vacant without his pres
| ence. We are crushed with the cruelty
of his going just when we needed him
so much. The years will be many, in
deed, when the recollection of him
and (hose ways so peculiarly his begin
I to dim. Why, right now I can see him
| lean across the table in a seminar
class, interrupt a student's report to
aslc, "How do you know that?" That
is the way he would wish to be re
membered.
I But in our efforts to console our
selves we should be selfish indeed
were we to forget those whom he
loved best and who loved him best.
