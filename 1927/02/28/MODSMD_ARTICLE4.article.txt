# "PRINCESS IDA" MEETS APPROVAL MY WORK OF ENSEMBLES, PRINCIPALS
## Freshman Amazes Audience By Rendering Base Solo Unusually Well 
### Hubert K. Gagos, '30 
With frequent applause and bursts
lof spontaneous laughter, a capacity
house acclaimed the success of the
comic opera, "Princess Ida," pre
sented last Friday night by the Dra
matic Council under the joint direc
tion of Warren I). Allen and Gordon
Davis.
Miss Winifred Estabrook in the role
j of Princess Ida, champion of women's
! superiority, gave the outstanding per
formance of the evening. Possessing a
rich voice of rare quality and charm,
j she won her audience by her rendi
! lion of the more difficult selections of
the opera, as well as by her convinc
ing characterization of tlie princess,
lu "Oh Goddess Wise," her first aria,
' Miss Estabrook displayed to advan
tage her dramatic versatility and the
I flexibility of her voice.
For sheer musical rendition, the
chorus was second only to Miss Esta
-1 brook. The ensembles were well-sung
: and colorful, and in their striking cos
tumes the chorus presented a specta
cle that was in no small measure re
i sponsible for the success of the show.
Lines Forgotten
| The production was not without its
j faults. It would undoubtedly have been
| improved by a second performance,
j when faulty memorizing would not
have ruined an encore whose words
were cleverly adapted to campus wo
men, and when forgotten lines notice
able in a few other places would have
been smoothed over. It was evident,
too, that leads, with a few exceptions,
had been chosen for dramatic rather
than musical ability, but on the whole
the production was good.
In farcical situations Bailey Newlee
as Hilarion, the male lead, was at his
best. On numerous occasions he
demonstrated his ability in the art of
burlesque, especially in his first-act
impersonation of a woman. His final
scene with the princess, when he
claims her as his bride, would have
appeared more realistic if he had been
a little less humble.
Carlton Byrne was well cast as the
pompous King Hildebrand. Although
his voice was a little soft, it was
pleasing.
Cyril and Glorian, friends of Hilar
ion, were well-enacted by Charles
Moore and Fcnton Barrett, respec
tively. They figured in the comic situ
ations with Hilarion, and in the trio,
"O, Dainty Triolet, O Fragrant Violet,"
scored one of the hits of the evening.
Al Cass, as King Gama, father of
Ida, was a trifle disappointing. Al
though he succeeded in portraying the
erratic character of the old man, he
lost the effect of some of the biting
repartee by hesitating on his lines.
Clearly, he was not the Al Cass of
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys" and his other
popular appearances.
FRESHMAN Surprises
Earl Reed, Adelbert Culling, and
Arthur Holmes were frequent laugh
makers as the "stalwart sons" of King
Gama. Their unison songs were the
most humorous of the opera. In the
second act, Culling, a FRESHMAN,
was the surprise of the evening with
his bass solo, "This Helmet I Sup
pose." He had a clear voice and easy
delivery.
Elizabeth Wilbur made the most of
her opportunities in the role of Lady
Blanche, Professor of Abstract Philo
sophy. Her song "Come, Mighty Must"
evoked much laughter. A duet with
Julia North was well done by both
and was one of the most tuneful melo
dies of the show.
As Lady Psyche, Ruth Klette was
well cast. Her acting was as good as
her singing. Carol Lasater, Edyth Al
len, and Verda Ilogan handled their
minor parts creditably.
The libretto was not of the first
water, nor were some of the songs.
One can see why "Princess Ida" does
not enjoy the reputation of other Gil
bert and Sullivan productions.
The technical work and the direc
tion was notable. Warren D. Allen's
presence in the pit was felt through
out as he directed the orchestra and
ensembles and gave cues to the leads.
The orchestra accompaniment was in
the main faultless.
