Here is a fine example of how
smoothness of action, with its lack of
wasted effort, will prolong the athletic
life of an individual. Look at Walter
Johnson, for instance. The "Big Train"
is still a great pitcher because lie had
a barrel of rhythm and hasn't used it
up in twenty years of hard service.
Jackson Scliolz isn't as old as Walter
Johnson, nor is he a pitcher, but they
both have a lot in common, for each
lias gone well beyond the average
allotment of competitive years, mainly
because he "did his stuff" in an-easy,
muscle-saving manner.
Like an arrow released from a bow,
Jackson Scliolz runs down the track,
the personification of the "poetry of
motion." It is a treat to watch this
grand veteran of the cinderpatli in
action, and because lie's luckily able
to move his arms, legs, and torso in
ft harmonious and artistic way, he is as
good' a runner at 32 as lie was at 21.
If you are lucky enough to be able to
watch Scliolz run in the near future,
notice how his start, stride, and finish
all blend into one smooth, flowing
action. A slight tipping of his head
to the light is the only fault that
could possibly be found.
The Olympic 200-metre champion
is 110 doubt nearing the erul of the
trail, as far as liis sprinting days go,
but he has a few good races left in
him and will be seen in action in the
indoor games of the A. A. U. at Madi
son Square Garden, New York, tonight
in the 300-yard run. This boy Scliolz
is a clean-cut, intelligent fellow, a
graduate of the University of Mis

souri, and a writer of parts. No doubt
many of his interesting fiction stories
! are based on his own experience as a
I globe-trotting sprinter, for "Jack" has
| not only been twice to Europe to com
pete, but he has been on a tour around
the world, and to the Antipodes an
other time.
