submitted a report Friday afternoon in
which it recommended the proposed
council for the direction of campus
publications.
The joint committees, Wilbur
Adams, John Duniway, Lucia Champ
lin, and John E. McDowell, represent
ing the A.S.S.U. revisional committee,
and Allan Klauber, Winston Norman,
Victor Greisser, and Professor E. W.

to agree upon the proposal that the
Executive Committee be permitted to
override the Publications Council by a
vote of six of its eight members.

dent body government.

mittee's report will be made at the
next meeting of the revision commit
tee Tuesday evening, at 8:30 o'clock,
