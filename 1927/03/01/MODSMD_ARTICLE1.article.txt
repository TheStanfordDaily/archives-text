# U.S.C. DEBATERS GIVEN DECISION OVER STANFORD
## Dictator of Italy Maligned As Tyrant, Praised As Benefactor CARDS FAVOR MUSSOLINI Creveling, Peterson Lose by Audience Vote, 16-4; 150 Attend 
### 
Debating the question, "Resolved, That
Mussolini is a benefactor to Italy," the
forensic team representing the Univer
sity of Southern California won over
the Stanford team by an audience deci
sion last night in the Assembly Hall.
Stanley Hopper and Adna Wright
Leonard composed the U.S.C. team up
holding the negative of the question,
Louis Creveliiif> and Harold Peterson
represented Stanford in support of the
resolution.
Creveling First
The first speaker for the affirmative
was Louis Creveling.
"Mussolini has brought Italy out of
chaos," stated Creveling. "He has es
tablished peace, he has placed Italy on a
sound economic basis, he has alleviated
much of the suffering due to unemploy
ment, he has brought about a balance of
trade, and lie has gained international
recognition for Italy."
"It is the government that works that
is the best government," he concluded.
Speaking for the negative, Stanley
Hopper declared: "Mussolini has brought
orders out of chaos, not order. Byttark r
ing away the rights of the people to free
dom of speech, freedom of the press,
freedom of assembly, and the franchise,
Mussolini lias proved himself a despot,
not a dictator. He has centered in him
self seven cabinet folios, the control of
the militia, and the premiership. Elective
offices throughout the country have been
replaced by government employees. The
philosophy that might makes right is
that lived by Mussolini."
Harold Peterson, second speaker for
the affirmative, in answering the argu
ments of Hopper, stated: "Although the
taking away of such rights in America
would be a national, catastrophe, such is
not the case in Italy. Rights never held
by the people cannot be abrogated. Since
Fascism has been in power, there has
existed in Italy an economically sound,
stable government. The people of Italy
are behind Mussolini, as proved by their
actions at the seventh anniversary of
Fascism last March.
''After Fascism there will be chaos.
With the death of" Mussolini as strong
an organization as is Fascism will find
another leader to take the place of the
present dictator. The benefits of the
movement are for the majority; therein
lies the power of Mussolini. Such things
as liberty, independence, are relative in
Italy. It is said that this is the price of
Fascism paid by the people. Economic
prosperity and stable government are
worth the price.
Maintaining that there exists no differ
ence between the conceptions of Italian
liberty and American liberty, Leonard,
second speaker for the negative, stated,
"The fundamental concept of liberty re
mains the same with any people.
Mussolini's Aims
''Mussolini rules by forcc. He wishes
to combine in himself the qualities of
Caesar, Machiavelli, and Bonaparte. All
three of these men were despots. Impe
rialism is a part of his plan. His action
in Tripoli is a manifestation of this. Fas
cism is national, not international; there
in lies the proof of its imperialism."
The rebuttals summed up the argu
ments put forth in the preceding speeches
and added further concrete facts proving
and disproving them. In the audience
vote it was found that the argument of
the U.S.C. debaters had changed the
opinions of sixteen people whereas that
of the Stanford men had changed four.
