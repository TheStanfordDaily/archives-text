# TED CRILEY OUT ON ACCOUNT OF INJURY; TWO-MILE WEAKENED
## Swain, Ranney, Aiken Are Promising Material to Fill Vacancy 
### 
Ted Criley, two-miler, will graduate
at the end of this quarter, it was an
nounced yesterday. This fact will ren
der him ineligible for track competi
tion spring quarter. Criley is taking
this step as he will be unable to run
this year because of having a pulled
tendon in one leg that makes it im
possible for him to train. Last year he
was on crutches for about a month
due to an injury to his other ankle.
With Criley out of the running,
Coach Robert "Dink" Templeton has
turned to other men now out for dis
tance races in an attempt to develop
someone who can place in the mile and
two-mile.
Ranney, who made his letter in the
mile last year, has been shifted to the
two-mile. It is possible that Swain may
also return to this race. Aiken, who
ran the two-mile three years ago as a
1927 freshman, is another prospect
who seems to have real staying ability.
Alex McKinnon ran the mile last
night in 4:37. He was captain of last
year's freshman team and won the half
in the Little Big Meet. Coach Temple
ton feels that he can safely shift Mc-
Kinnon to the mile because of the
showings that have been made by
Tom Moss and Jack Dales in the half.
Moss has been running the 880 in two
minute, and should do considerably
better than that.
