# SECRETARY KELLOGG CALLED WOODEN-HEAD BY JORDAN IN TALK
## State Department Head Hit As Blunderer; Nicaragua, Mexico Discussed 
### 
"Kellogg is the most wooden-headed
Secretary of State the United States
has ever had. We ought to not even
talk on military occupation until we
see how the law stands in Mexico,"
said Dr. Jordan at a meeting of the
Cosmopolitan Club last night in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Stressing a policy of "going slowly,
using arbitration, and finding out
facts" in regard to present foreign af
fairs, Dr. Jordan discussed at length
"The Problem of Nicaragua and Mex
ico."
"Doheny is without the slightest
trace of civic consciousness," said Dr.
Jordan. "It is curious that, at the same
time that we are trying to prosecute
him in this country, we are so anxious
to protect his property." Dr. Jordan
added that Doheny owns almost half
of the American property in Mexico
and is doing his best to bring about
annexation of Mexican territory, ne
cessarily by military force, because
such annexation would bring a great
deal of his property under American
jurisdiction.
In regard to the Nicaraguan situa
tion, Dr. Jordan explained that some
years ago Nicaraguan lumber com
panies got into a dispute over Ameri
can contracts and referred their dis
agreements to a commission. It was
found that only 10 per cent of the
contracts corresponded to the coun
try's laws. "I think," said Dr. Jordan,
"that the United States has no right
to interfere until the controversy
about the contracts is settled and it
is found out who has paid and who
has not." The fact of our recognizing
Diaz as president, he declared, indi
cates that the lumber companies are
in power.
Dr. Jordan told of his personal con
tacts with former Mexican presidents
and in speaking of Diaz quoted him as
saying that he had "made Mexico into
a little germ of a great nation." Ma
dera, he said, was a graduate of the
University of California.
