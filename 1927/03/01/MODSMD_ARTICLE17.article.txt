Displaying the first example of team
work in the Encina Hall tournament,
Encina 2W yesterday won its way into
the final round of the series by defeating
Encina 5 by a score of 13 to 10. Encina
! 1W also won its semi-final game from
! Encina Basement 11 to 9 in an extra
■ period tussle. Both games were played
I in the gymnasium. ♦
The second-floor quintet outclassed the
j upperclassmen from the top floor of
j Encina from the start, a series of well-
I executed plays from the tip-off at center
I sweeping the fifth-floor men off their
j feet. At the end of the first half the
! score stood 10 to 3 in favor of the 2W
| five, the attic quintet breaking through
I the strong defensive formation of the
1 winning team for but one field goal.
Substitutes Slow
Substitutions slowed up the attack of
the victors in the last half, but the de-1
tense maintained continued to prove ef- j
fective until the last few minutes of
play. Hopelessly behind at this point, ]
Encina 5 took to long shots, and carried
j 011 a short-lived rally which gave them !
I seven more points. Kibby took the brunt
{of the attack in this play, sinking two
field goals and a foul shot, and running
his total for the day to seven tallies.
Fernstrom Tallies
In the other bracket of the semi-final
play, a field goal by Fernstrom in the
first part of an extra period gave Encina
1W a victory by a narrow two-point
margin. Failure to sink but one of ten
i tries for foul shots proved the undoing
lof the cellar squad, while Dail of the
i 1W five gave his team a final chance by
| making good on four out of six tries.
In the first half both teams gave slop
'py exhibitions of basketball, the base
ment quintet leading 5 to 3 at the end
of the period. Starting the last half,
however, Dail found his eye and with
three minutes to go his team was leading
i by a score of 8 to 7.
Encina 2W and Encina 1W will meet
in the final game of the tournament Wed
| nesday afternoon in the gymnasium. The
members of the winning team will later
'be presented with silver basketball

charms.

I in the gymnasium. ♦
The second-floor quintet outclassed the
j upperclassmen from the top floor of
j Encina from the start, a series of well-
I executed plays from the tip-off at center
I sweeping the fifth-floor men off their
j feet. At the end of the first half the
! score stood 10 to 3 in favor of the 2W
| five, the attic quintet breaking through
I the strong defensive formation of the
1 winning team for but one field goal.
Substitutes Slow
Substitutions slowed up the attack of
the victors in the last half, but the de-1
tense maintained continued to prove ef- j
fective until the last few minutes of
play. Hopelessly behind at this point, ]
Encina 5 took to long shots, and carried
j 011 a short-lived rally which gave them !
I seven more points. Kibby took the brunt
{of the attack in this play, sinking two
field goals and a foul shot, and running
his total for the day to seven tallies.
Fernstrom Tallies
In the other bracket of the semi-final
play, a field goal by Fernstrom in the
first part of an extra period gave Encina
1W a victory by a narrow two-point
margin. Failure to sink but one of ten
i tries for foul shots proved the undoing
lof the cellar squad, while Dail of the
i 1W five gave his team a final chance by
| making good on four out of six tries.
In the first half both teams gave slop
'py exhibitions of basketball, the base
ment quintet leading 5 to 3 at the end
of the period. Starting the last half,
however, Dail found his eye and with
three minutes to go his team was leading
i by a score of 8 to 7.
Encina 2W and Encina 1W will meet
in the final game of the tournament Wed
| nesday afternoon in the gymnasium. The
members of the winning team will later
'be presented with silver basketball
j
charms.
