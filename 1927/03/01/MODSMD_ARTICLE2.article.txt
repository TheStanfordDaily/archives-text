# WAGNER SELECTIONS COMPOSE PROGRAM OF ORGAN RECITAL
## 
### 
Compositions of Richard Wagner
form the program which will be played
at 4:15 this afternoon in the Memorial
Church by Warren D. Allen, University
organist.
The prelude from "Lohengrin" is
the first number to be given. This will
be followed by "Elizabeth's Prayer"
from the opera "Tannhauser," and by
two selections from"The Master
singer," the "Chorale" from act one,
and "Walter's Prize Song."
The final number on the program
will be selections played from
Wagner's sacred-stage-festival play,
"Parsifal." This work, first produced
in 1882 at Wagner's Festspielhaus, is
one of the man's greatest composi
tions. The arrangement of "Parsifal"
which Mr. Allen will play is by M.
Enrico Bossi, one of Italy's greatest
organists.
