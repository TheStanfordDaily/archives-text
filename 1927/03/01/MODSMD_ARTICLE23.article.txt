# The Final Gun

### 
Tlie 1927 basketball season officially came to an end for Stanford
yesterday when the Board of Athletic Control canceled the third Cali
fornia game, which was scheduled for this week-end on a San Francisco
court. The action was the only possible course that could be taken under
the circumstances, and still maintain that spirit of sportsmanship that has
always marked contests between the two institutions in the past. A third
game would be a mere financial enterprise, which is against the best
interests of college athletics.
The University of California now will represent the southern section
of the Pacific Coast Conference when it meets Oregon for the champion
ship of the Coast. Before the basketball game Saturday night, California
and Stanford were enemies. When the contest was over and California
had won a decisive victory, the two universities once again became
friends. Victories for California in the games that the Bears have yet
to play will be successes for this section of the league, and therefore
glory for Stanford as well as for California.
With the completion of the basketball season the cage sport takes the
back seat, and track, baseball, and tennis are at the wheel. With two
major sports —football and basketball—completed, Stanford and Califor
nia are 011 an even standing. The Cards won the annual grid contest, and
the Hears conquered in the annual basketball series. Tlve race is on.
