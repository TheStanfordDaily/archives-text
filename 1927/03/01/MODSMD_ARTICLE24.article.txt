At Ohio University twelve fraternities participate in intramural debat
ing. Wesleyan supports intramural debating. The University of Wash
ington has recently initiated a similar activity on the Coast. Colleges and
universities in the East, Middle West, and South have had such compe
tition for some time.
While the idea of intramural debating is somewhat new in this section
of the country, other types of intramural competition are well established
at Stanford. Saturday night eight organizations were awarded plaques
for winning their respective basketball leagues. There were thirty-eight
teams competing in the competition. Estimating that each team had a
roster of at least ten players, there were close to 400 men competing for
the honor of the groups.
It is quite possible that debating of this kind would appeal to a large
number of organizations at Stanford. The topics could be of campus
interest rather than too intellectual. Wesleyan chose as its subject this
year: "Resolved. That the Prism, as an institution, should be continued at
Wesleyan." Ohio argued on the following question: "Resolved, that the
present \ olstead Act should be modified so as to permit the manufacture
and sale of light wines and beers in the United States." The teams that
competed at Ohio were Beta Theta Pi, Gamma Gamma Gamma, Green
Circle. Tan Sigma Delta, Phi Delta Theta. Phi Kappa Tau, Theta Chi,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Omega Beta Pi. Delta Sigma Pi, Kappa Psi Alpha,
and Delta Tan Delta. This list includes national and local fraternities as
well as eating clubs.
