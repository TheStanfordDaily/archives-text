Gastronomic immorality is now ranked with intemperance by a
YAV.C.A. lecturer. The Daily Kansan prints:
" 'Eating green apples is immoral as well as drinking alcohol.' declared
Dr. Raymond A. Schwegler, dean of the School of Education, in a lecture for
parents at the Kansas City. Mo., Y.W.C.A., Monday afternoon. 'Pathologists
say that a small boy never recovers entirely from the penalty nature exacts
from the eating of green apples. Consequently eating green apples is immoral.
It is immoral to put anything in the hody that will shorten the life or warp
or detract from natural enjoyments. It is moral to put into the hody any
thing which will lengthen one's days or enrich one's experiences.' "
