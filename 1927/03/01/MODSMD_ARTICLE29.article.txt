-THE LIT"
In its early years Stanford had a
flying start to develop a strong liter
ary tradition. What with Charlie Field
running at large and the Irwin boys
and their associates writing stuff, the
campus acquired a certain literary
tone.
Later, with the extensive develop
ment of the scientific and professional
schools, and the contemporaneous de
velopment of the attitude serious, the
literary tradition rather took a beat
ing.
Those who would encourage literary
activity upon the part of Stanford stu
dents have felt that the greatest need
was for some sort of medium for
literary expression. From time to time
literary or semi-literary magazines
have sprung up on the campus, only
to become defunct through bad man
agement. Up to the inception of the
present Stanford Literary Magazine
there has been no real opportunity to
ascertain whether or not a well-man
aged publication of a purely literary

I nature has a place at Stanford. The
present magazine bids fair to be a
| good test ease.
The other day we attended a rather
i representative student gathering at
! which the question was put, "Who be
: lieves that there should be a literary
magazine published at Stanford?"
Those present responded unanimously
1 to the effect that they would like to
see such a magazine remain on the
' campus.
From this we deduce that there is
a strong public sentiment in favor of
"The Lit." It remains only for this
! sentiment to become crvstalized into
, some sort of financial support and the
I magazine will be established on a
I sound financial basis. As it is, "The
! Lit" is doing well. It should be doing
j better.
By way of closing, permit us to call
J publicatio attention to the fact that a
i magazine such as "The Lit" is a high
ly creditable representative of the Uni
j versity on the outside.
Lions present are at liberty to roar.
