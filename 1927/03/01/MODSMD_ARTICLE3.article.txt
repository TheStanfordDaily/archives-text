### 
Seats for the concert in which Rosa
Ponselle, dramatic soprano, will ap
pear here Thursday night at the Bas
ketball Pavilion in the first A.S.S.U.
music series program of the 1927 sea
son, may be obtained by holders of
season tickets at the Old Union today
and tomorrow from 1 to 5 o'clock. A
number of additional seats have been
placed in the Pavilion. These will go
on tale at prices ranging from $1.50
to $2.50.
Miss Ponselle is reported to use
particular care in choosing arias and
song-i which are appropriate to each
occa-ion, and In arranging them so
that, each is presented in its rightful
place.
Vindicating this practice, the artist
declares: "Perhaps I am over-particu
lar in the time and care I take to
selet t the compositions I am to sing,
but the results appear to justify the
time and thought I give to that side
of my work."

I In discussing types of programs, she
; states: "There are rules of artistic
proportion and symmetry to be ob
served in the making of a song pro
gram, as well as rules affecting the
special tastes of the assemblage be
fore which I am scheduled to appear.
Every audience wants one opera aria,
perhaps two or three. Settling upon
| the one that seems suited to the taste
: of the majority is easier than to make
I a choice of that which will conform
' to popular demand, and yet? will not
disturb the artistic lines of the pro
. gram."
Contrasts Sought
"Once that difficulty is conquered, I
am confronted by another problem; I
must find songs that will have a rela
tive bearing, one upon another, and
put them on the program where each
! will offer a nice contrast with its pre
decessor and at the same time lead up
| naturally to the song that is to fol
i low."
