The Editor, Sir:
There has been considerable said of
late regarding the coming of woman
to an economic footing equal with
man, not to mention the able editorial
entitled "It's Your Fault." With the
coming of woman to the status of
complete independence there arise cer
tain evils, conflicts, and misunder
standings, which man —in this man
made world —is apt to judge from his
own standpoint. The most paramount
of these is the smoking habit. Profes
sor John C. Duvall, you say, believes
that the fall of America will be caused
by the weakening of the feminine
physique through the use of tobacco.
What about man? Ever since the re
ception committee handed Sir Walter
Raleigh a cigar when he landed in
Virginia hasn't man smoked? Then we
must admit that ever since we learned
the trick from the Indians, we men
have indulged in the deadly weed. Yet
it is held that the race today is far
more in advance —on the whole —than
it was in those days, yet we have ab
sorbed enormous quantities of nico
tine into our systems and are descend
ants of tobacco-users. Woman is now
coming to use tobacco and it is
claimed —since it is she that bears
the larger burden in propogating the
species—that the weakening of her
body, through the use of tobacco, will
weaken the race! My argument is that
strong, virile men do just as much in
building a great race as do healthy
women, and I dare say that the female
of the species will not desist from the
use of tobacco until she shows man
how ridiculous he looks himself, when
he uses the deadly weed. If we must
prevent the fall of America, we've all
got to quit using it —both men and
women. This idea men have that the
women must be strong is false —it
merely gives the men a chance to dis
sipate further. Out in the cow country
a strong thoroughbred herd is built up
not by shooting all the old cows and
buying new ones —that procedure is
too expensive. Polygamy reigns —
among the cattle at least. It is the bull
that builds up the herd. "Scrub" cows

j are kept and bred to good bulls be
| cause this is the only economic method
j possible. The calves of the thorough
j bred bull are much stronger than
I those of the "scrub" bull. The opposite
is true —a thoroughbred cow gives
| birth to a calf that will forever be a
; weakling if the sire was a "scrub."
This raw example serves to illus
-1 trate the point at hand —that the fall
,of America will be caused by the
| weakening of the strength of the men
| as well as of the women. What is more
; disgusting than to climb the library
; steps any rainy day and see countless
I idle youths of the male species suck
ing on reeking cigarettes—which they
throw upon the steps for the rain to
| dissolve.
Efficient work cannot be done by
the habitual smoker. His mind is im
paired and his body is impaired. Like
the toffee- and tea-drinker —he is sub
! ject to nervous disorders. The best
| proof of this can be found on the ath
letic field. The stars do not use to
' bacco, tea, or coffee when they are
J in training. Efficient mental work can
not be done when the mind is stimu
' lated or stupifled, as the case may be.
I Civilization will never flourish until
! the race as a whole has the character
; to use the best that can be produced
j and reject that which is harmful.
When the American people have the
I power to quit using habit-forming
'stimulants they will check the fall
; that will inevitably come if they do
1 not. When they will be no longer in
' fluenced by tobacco advertisements,
, they will build up a strong race. These
I stimulants cannot be prohibited from
112 the countrv —they must be tried be
i
fore their effect can be found out. The
| men have tried them, have become
: addicted to them. Now the women are
| trying them —tobacco is the case in
hand —the men are jealous; they see
I how ridiculous they look themselves.
| Long ago have the tobacco users —
• male and female —lost the bloom of
youth. If we continue to use tobacco
our efficiency will be impaired. Amer
ica's fall will be checked only by
building American bodies —and fami
i lies —not destroying them! —H.C.
