NIGGER HEAVEN, by Carl Van Vech- j
ten. Alfred Nopf.
Turning from the naive to the ultra-1
sophisticated, we find in Van Vechten's i
latest novel a modernistic kaleido
scope of color and fervor, love and !
hate, passion afid ambition, and de-!
spair with its subsequent disillusion-!
raent. This is a novel with a singularly
original background—Harlem, Mecca
of the New Negro. One is astonished I
to learn of the existence of an en-!
trenched Negro society, with all its :
varying degrees and cliques, and far i
above thp Saturday Evening Post type j
Van Vechten undoubtedly excels his
previous work in this plea for a better ;
understanding of the intellectual i
Black. The seriousness which under

lies the story is glossed over with
countless superficial but intriguing de
tails. One may be .amazed to learn that
"the negro fast set does everything
the Long Island set does, plays bridge,
keeps the bootlegger busy, drives
around in Rolls-Royces, and commits
adultery; although it is vastly more
amusing than the Long Island set for
the simple reason that it is amused."
The leading characters are sincerely
etched; they think and speak in a
manner that would do credit to many
white people. Their efforts to rise
above the old black prejudice and
earn a respectable living on a pur with
the whites is the basic theme of the
plot. Harlem, with a population as
large as Rome, with shops and thea

tres, churches, libraries, and cabarets,
is the fascinating background and
Nigger Heaven for all those unhappy
Blacks who want their rightful heri
tage as American citizens.
It wouldn't surprise us if JJie
freshmen enjoy Van Vechten's ef
forts more than the "Diary." And we
must confess that a blas6 senior
showed much more enthusiasm for
the Harvard scapades than she did
for those Of the negro "400." Can it be
that Stanford is producing a "bigger
and better" race of freshmen that
shows more sophistication than its
predecessors of several years ago?
