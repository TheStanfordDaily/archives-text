Now cometh a psychologist who says
that the doctor was all wrong who
frightened us by saying that every
kiss takes three minutes from the al
ready all-too-short human life.
What a relief! Still, the vacation
has, we hope, been good for us.
» * * *
And we are still curious—if the
warning doctor had been right, what
would have been the fate of the fellow
who tried to till the last three minutes
of his life with a three-minute kiss?

How chivalrous are
University men.
They throw dirty digs
At college women;
They say that all of them
Are dumb —
And also homely.
But have a look
At any "Alumni" column,
And you will see
That So&So, '24,
Married Miss , '26,
And could hardly wait
For the sweet young thing
To graduate! —V.C.

"College youths of today have so
much liberty that they are in danger

All that his countrymen at home

The class of 1930 journalists who

Our only complaint against the

Women at I'.S.C. have asked that
irchcry be established as a recognized
sport for women there. At present,
only men's gym clas«eß following
the William Tell sport.

Someone has complained against
the food served at Encina.

More sophomores were dropped and
placed on probation at Dartmouth re

class. No juniors or seniors wore dis
missed for poor scholastic standing.

Women at I'.S.C. have asked that
irchcry be established as a recognized
sport for women there. At present,

frightened us by saying that every
kiss takes three minutes from the al

What a relief! Still, the vacation
has, we hope, been good for us.

And we are still curious—if the
warning doctor had been right, what
would have been the fate of the fellow
who tried to till the last three minutes
of his life with a three-minute kiss?
