# JOURNALISTIC SOCIETY STARTED IN INDIANA
## 
### 
A most comprehensive movement
for welding newspaper workers has
come from L. H. Millikan of Indiana
polis, who was editor of the DePauw
University daily paper in 1909, and
who asked several members of his
staff to join in forming a journalistic
fraternity at that time.
He had in mind no more than a
campus organization to perpetuate the
memory of the staff. They selected
Sigma Delta Chi as the name of their
fraternity and appeared on the cam
pus with colors of black and white,
to suggest the newspaper's black ink
on white paper. The organization
struggled along until presently it be
came the leading college journalistic
fraternity.
The fraternity now has more than
4,000 members with a personal bureau
maintained to supply newspapermen
to publications throughout the coun
try. Professor Roy L. French of the
University of North Dakota at Grand
Forks is president.
On January 5, 1915, a charter was
granted to Edwin H. Ford, Milton A.
Hagen, James W. Bennet, Harold M.
Levy, Glenn A. Hughes, and Robert A.
Griffin to establish a chapter at Stan
ford University to be known as the
Upsilon chapter of the Sigma Delta
Chi fraternity.
