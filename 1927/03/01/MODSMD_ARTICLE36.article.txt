# SURGEON ATTRIBUTES MEDICAL ADVANCE TO USE OF MICROSCOPE
## 
### 
"The romance of medicine lies in the
use of the ultra-microscopic microscope,
the instrument which has enabled scien
tific medicine to advance more in the last
fifty years than in all the previous years,"
Dr. William J. Mayo, internationally fa
mous surgeon and founder of the Mayo
Clinic, told students of the University of
Minnesota in a charter day address.
"I hold great hopes for a continued
prolongation of the average life span of
man, due to the improvements of scien
tific medicine. In the sixteenth century
the average life of man was 20 years.
The average now is 50 years. Studies
which are now being made give promise
of a man who will live the scriptural
average of three score and ten," Dr.
Mayo continued.
Speaking of cults, he said, "Unless one j
is incurably orthodox it is better for one |
to keep an open mind on the develop- j
ments of science. To become a disciple |
of any cult or the occult does one ir- j
reparable mental harm and causes nu- j
me'ruus mental disturbances. Many men i
of prominence took in early life an inter- j
est in the occult, thus injuring themselves j
later on in their chosen professions."
