# BABE DIAMOND SQUAD TRIMS SOPHOMORES IN SEVENTH INNING SPURT
## Freshman Infield Tightens When Opponents Score In Sixth Frame 
### 
Putting on the diamond the best
looking ball club that first-year men
have been in the habit of displaying,
the freshman interclass nine yester
day afternoon trimmed the sophomore
aggregation 7 to 2.
It took the 1930 men seven innings
to find the curves and slow balls of
Lewis and Kearns of the sophomores,
but two healthy hits, two well-placed
bunts, and an error contributed to the
rally that netted six of the total of
seven runs.
Infield Tightens
In the fifth inning, when Husky
Hunt' 3 nine was at bat, three men got
on base, and two outs were already
called, a bunt, which led into a triple
play choked a possible score, and the
side was retired.
Levin, number one of the batting
order of the freshmen, with three hits
in four times at the plate, led the field
for the day, and at the same time was
responsible for one of the runs. "Red"
Berg, centerfielder, and Bill Laird at
third base also turned in snappy
games and hits that countcd in the
tallies.
Third-baseman Wright of the sopho
mores led his team in hitting with
two hits out of three trips to the plate,
also accounting for a run.
Juniors to Play
The freshman team, as yesterday's
winner, meets the winner of today's
fracas between the juniors and the
seniors, and the sophomore nine meets
the loser. Both games will be played
on Thursday at 4 o'clock. The game
scheduled for this afternoon between
the juniors and the seniors will be
called at 4 o'clock.
