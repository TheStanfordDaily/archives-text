# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY ”FEG” MURRAY, '16 
If March comes in like a lion, it i
goes out like a lamb, so the saying
goes. But what if Connie Mack comes :
in like a roaring, stampeding masto
don at the start of the season —will he j
go out like an electric light globe
dropped from the Woolworth Building
before the American League race is !
ended ?
Behold the veteran manager astride !
his electrified elephant, tearing along
at a tremendous pace for one so aged. j
Whence all the pep? Why all the ,
noise? What's all the shootin' for?
Well, if you had a ball club that in-1
eluded such stars as Bob Grove, Eddie ;
Collins, and Zack Wheat, and the sen- j
sational minor leaguer, Joe Boley, !
wouldn't you feel all pepped up, and
as though you were on your way to a |
pennant?
The raw deal that Fate has handed I
the long, lanky Cornelius McGilli- j
cuddy is well known, and last year 1
must have seemed the unkindest cut
of all, for, after working his team up
to second place in 1925, from seven
straight years in the cellar, the Ath
letics slipped back once more, and
finished in third position.
But perhaps that was merely one

| last cruel gesture by the Gods who
: control the destinies of baseball man
( agers, and a "dawn" will break at last
j for Connie Mack after the "darkest
j hour" of 1925.
Think of the strength Mack has
' along that famous line from the plate
! to center field, with Cochrane, Grove,
: Gray, Elimke, Rommel, and Quinn;
I Collins and Boley; and A1 Simmons!
If Connie, suddenly turned spend
thrift. wins a pennant at last because
jof his newly-acquired high-priced
j stars he'll deserve a medal. Decorate
i him with the "V.C." which also stands
I for Vacuum Cleaner!
