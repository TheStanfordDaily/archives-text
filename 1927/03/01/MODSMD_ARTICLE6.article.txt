# SENIOR WOMEN PLAY LANGUID BASKETBALL; FRESHMEN WIN 50-15
## Holley, Woehlke Star for Lowerclassmen; Juniors Meet Sophomores 
### 
Unable to call forth any pep, the
senior women lost the first champion
ship series basketball game to the
1030 team yesterday afternoon, 50 to
15. Marian Holley, '30 forward, scored
32 of her team's tallies, Dorothea
Woehlke accounting for the remain
der.
The 1927 centers were unable to get
the tip-off as often as the freshmen,
and when they did work the ball down
to their basket, the forwards failed
to shoot with sufficient accuracy.
Maxine Cushing played an excellent
game at guard for the first-year
women.
At half time the seniors were be
hind 24 to 4. Up to that time there
had been only one foul called. In the
second half the seniors played better
ball, but the freshmen also speeded
up, and their already efficient machine
worked more smoothly.
The juniors will meet the sopho
more this afternoon at 4:20 o'clock on
Roble field. The juniors, twice cham
pions, are favored to win.
