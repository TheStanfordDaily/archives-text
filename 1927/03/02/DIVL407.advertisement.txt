All day Face Comfort
MORE and more men are demanding
comfort. The makers of Williams
Shaving Cream have answered that demand
with Aqua Velva, a scientific liquid made
expressly for use after shaving. A few drops
of Aqua Velva slapped on the newly-shaven
face give it an exhilarating thrill—keep it as
comfortable all day long as Williams Shaving
Cream left it. In big 5-oz. bottles — 50c.
