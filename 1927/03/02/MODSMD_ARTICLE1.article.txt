# STANFORD NINE FACES SEALS IN PRACTICE GAME
## Cardinals to Prepare for Third Santa Clara Series Contest BOB PHILIPPI TO PITCH Opponents Have Almost Same Lineup as Ireland's Independents 
### Ed Randol 
The Stanford varsity baseball team
will meet the Kennealv Seals, semi-pro
fessional team from San Francisco, this
afternoon at 3 o'clock in-a practice game
scheduled to put the Cardinals in shape
for the third game of the Santa Clara
series, to be played Saturday afternoon.
The Seals offer practically the same line
up as that brought to Stanford early in
the season under the name of Ireland's
Independents.
Philippi to Start
Bob Philippi will get his first chance
to start on the mound this season, having
earned this position by showing good
class in finishing against St. Mary's in
both games of the series played with the
Saints. If Philippi turns back the Seals
it is probable that Coach Harry Wolter
will start him iti«a California Intercolle
giate Baseball Association game soon.
Cook Sypher will be on the receiving
end of the battery, the stocky catcher
having won an indisputable place be
cause of his scrappy play this season.
Sypher has not only succeeded in putting
pep into the Cardinal play, but has also
set an example for his teammates by
his consistent and timely hitting.
Infield Chosen
Maguire will start at first base, Gari
baldi at second, Busch at shortstop, and
Harder at third. This infield combina
tion lias proved the best of those tried
by Wolter, and although errors have
been frequent and costly it is expected
that practice this week will have settled
<the squad down considerably.
Wilton, Stewart, and Nissen will form
the outfield in today's lineup, according
to Wolter. These three men were shifted
from the outfield recruits early in the
season, and have apparently cinched their
places on the varsity squad.
Squad Works Daily
While the Cardinals have taken Santa
Clara into camp twice this year, Wolter
is taking no chances with losing the
third contest Saturday and has had the
entire baseball squad working out daily.
The recent rains caused a let-up in prac
tice sessions, and the loss of two contests
to St. Mary's indicated the need of
steadier play.
Infield practice has been featured by
Coach Wolter in the hope of smoothing
put any remaining wrinkles in play.
Judgment in completing plays has also
proved a weakness of the Cardinal nine,
and the short games played this week
have stressed improvement on this point.
Following the Kennealv Seals game, prac
tice will be resumed with a final session
being held Friday afternoon.

to start on the mound this season, having
earned this position by showing good
class in finishing against St. Mary's in
both games of the series played with the
Saints. If Philippi turns back the Seals
it is probable that Coach Harry Wolter
will start him iti«a California Intercolle
giate Baseball Association game soon.
Cook Sypher will be on the receiving
end of the battery, the stocky catcher
having won an indisputable place be
cause of his scrappy play this season.
Sypher has not only succeeded in putting
pep into the Cardinal play, but has also
set an example for his teammates by
his consistent and timely hitting.
Infield Chosen
Maguire will start at first base, Gari
baldi at second, Busch at shortstop, and
Harder at third. This infield combina
tion lias proved the best of those tried
by Wolter, and although errors have
been frequent and costly it is expected
that practice this week will have settled
<the squad down considerably.
Wilton, Stewart, and Nissen will form
the outfield in today's lineup, according
to Wolter. These three men were shifted
from the outfield recruits early in the
season, and have apparently cinched their
places on the varsity squad.
Squad Works Daily
While the Cardinals have taken Santa
Clara into camp twice this year, Wolter
is taking no chances with losing the
third contest Saturday and has had the
entire baseball squad working out daily.
The recent rains caused a let-up in prac
tice sessions, and the loss of two contests
to St. Mary's indicated the need of
steadier play.
Infield practice has been featured by
Coach Wolter in the hope of smoothing
put any remaining wrinkles in play.
Judgment in completing plays has also
proved a weakness of the Cardinal nine,
and the short games played this week
have stressed improvement on this point.
Following the Kennealv Seals game, prac
tice will be resumed with a final session
being held Friday afternoon.
The Stanford varsity baseball team
will meet the Kennealv Seals, semi-pro
fessional team from San Francisco, this
afternoon at 3 o'clock in-a practice game
scheduled to put the Cardinals in shape
for the third game of the Santa Clara
series, to be played Saturday afternoon.
The Seals offer practically the same line
up as that brought to Stanford early in
the season under the name of Ireland's
Independents.
Philippi to Start
Bob Philippi will get his first chance
to start on the mound this season, having
earned this position by showing good
class in finishing against St. Mary's in
both games of the series played with the
Saints. If Philippi turns back the Seals
it is probable that Coach Harry Wolter
will start him iti«a California Intercolle
