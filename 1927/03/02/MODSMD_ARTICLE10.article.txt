# INDIVIDUAL FEATURES OF DANCE PRODUCTION NEARING COMPLETION
## 
### 
Work on the dance drama to be
given by the women next Tuesday eve
ning is nearing completion. This week
is being spent in polishing the indi
vidual features of the program.
Dances of widely varying nature
are included in the program. "Aries,"
the dance drama proper, contrasts
strongly "The Romance of Resanoff,"
given last spring by the women of the
University, containing more dancing
than pantomime and depending upon
the combination of color, music, and
emotion to interpret an abstract idea.
Two groups of short divertisments
preceding "Aries" include solo dances,
group work, and several special short
numbers. One of the features of this
group is the "Dream of Prince Charm
ing," danced by Velma Randall and
01 ga Spirito.
Lucie Bentley, who last year pre
sented many of the siren parts in cam
pus plays, appears in several new
characterizations, varying from a
tough tar to a weather-beaten gard
ener of Versailles. One of the most
amusing of the dances concerns the
melancholy meditations of Felix the
Cat, with Anno Mudge as Felix.
