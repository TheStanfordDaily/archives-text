# BARRIE COMEDY PROMISES PEGGY RANDALL SUCCESS
## 
### 
"A Kiss for Cinderella" bids fair to
be a personal triumph for Peggy Ran
dall. who is taking her most important
part in a campus production since her
very successful appearance in "Dulcy,"
the 1927 sophomore play. In James
Barrie's comedy Miss Randall has the
part of Cinderella, halt-starved London
waif who is endeavoring to do her
part during the period of the Great
War as a seamstress and laundry girl
extraordinary.
Largely through lack of food, poor
living conditions, and cold, the girl
sees herself as the Cinderella of the
fairy tales. The climax of her vision
comes in the Ballroom scene of Act II
when Cinderella enacts the fairy ball
and banquet as she has conceived
them from her limited experience.
Since her initial appearance in
"Dulcy," Miss Randall has played con
sistently in Stanford plays, including
junior operas, football shows, "You

1 and I," and "Fashion." Her latest part
was that of Ophelia in the modern
dress "Hamlet" given last summer
quarter.
Although Miss Randall in the part
of Cinderella dominates the play from
i beginning to end in the role llrst made
| famous by Maude Adams, Mac Lewis
' and Howard Wickersham also appear
|to advantage in their parts. Lewis,
I who portrays a severe, unromantic
i London policeman in "A Kiss for Cin
| derella," had the juvenile lead in "In
the Next Room," the 1028 sophomore
play, and has also taken part in sev
eral Ram's Head shows.
Howard Wickersham will be remem
bered for his characterization of
j Jimmy Caesar in "John Ferguson,"
which was given last quarter. In the
part of the sympathetic Mr. Bodie in
"A Kiss for Cinderella," he depicts a
personality utterly unlike that of the
detestable, weak, and garrulous Cae
| sar.
