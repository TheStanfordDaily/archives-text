# MEDICAL CURRICULUM SEVERELY CRITICIZED IN SPEECH BY WILBUR
## Methods Are Rigid, Antique; Work Done by Teachers, Not by Students 
### 
"For the most part the medical cur
riculum is static, rigid, and shot full
of antique methods, ideas, and pro
cedures. It often misguides individuals
into the belief that they have com
pleted their education when they have
wandered successfully through its in
tricacies and mazes," is the statement
of President Wilbur quoted in "Time"
for February 28 in connection with his
speech last week at the meeting in
Chicago of members of the Federation
of State Medical Boards and of the
Council on Education. Licensure, and
Hospitals of the American Medical
Association.
Dr. Wilbur continued: "It is diffi
cult to train a man or woman to work
largely with his hands and senses in
the care of the sick when he has been
brought up in the present pass-the
buck atmosphere of the ordinary hos
pital mechanism for the diagnosis and
care of the sick.
"The more work done by the student
and the less by the teacher, the better
the product. It is not what we know
but what we actually use that counts
in medical practice. Don't measure
education in the terms of talk."
Dr. Wilbur has been in the East on
a four weeks' trip and is to return to
the University on Sunday, March 6.
Professor Robert E. Swain, vice-presi
dent of Stanford, has been acting as
president during Dr. Wilbur's absence.
