# JUNIOR NINE DEFEATS SENIOR AGGREGATION IN INTERCLASS PLAY
## 
### 
I A three-run rally in the sixth in
i ning, and unexpected air-tight pitch
ing by George Wilhelmy who went to
the box as a substitute in the fifth
inning for the juniors, carried enough
punch to enable the third-year men to
nose out the senior nine in the second
| game of the interclass baseball series
I yesterday afternoon by a score of
: 6 to 5.
Steady hurling by Francis Harold,
! on the mound for the 1927 team dur
! ing the early innings of the game,
i kept the hits well scattered but a
' muffed ball by Brittan at third base
' broke up the errorless playing of the
infield, and two junior runners tallied
:for their first scores.
The seniors found little trouble driv
' ing the ball, and three runs in the
second frame put them well in the
I
lead. Two more runs in the fourth
were contributed by two errors on hits.
The results of the two preliminary
; games has paired the freshman nine
with the juniors for the championship,
1 and the seniors with the sophomores
for last place, both games to be played
i Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
