# VARSITY TENNIS MEN MEET IN COMPETITION FOR TEAM RANKINGS
## 
### 
Two tennis matches influencing the
relative ranking of the varsity team
; will be played this afternoon on the
varsity courts. Cranston Holman and
Lionel Ogden play for first place at
12:15 o'clock, and Ralph McElvennv
and Alan Herrington meet for third
position an hour later.
Cranston Holman, as ranking Stan
ford star for three seasons, is favored
to trim Ogden. The pair have played
together often, Holman usually win
j ning but only after a good exhibition
j of his skill. Ogden has been playing in
mid-season form lately, so the match
should be fast and well-played.
Alan Herrington was ranged second
I at the beginning of the squad compe
| tition, but dropped to fourth in games
! against Ogden and McElvennv. He
! won from John Wheatley, fifth, in
I three sets last week, and has an op
portunity to begin the ascent to his
i former height by defeating McEl
! venny. The two played three hard sets
;in their former match and the one
i today should be equally contested.
