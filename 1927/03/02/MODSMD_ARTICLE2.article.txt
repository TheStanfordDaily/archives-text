# CARDS CANCEL PLANS FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE, A.A.U. AQUATIC MEETS
## 
### 
Arrangements which were practi
cally complete to send members of the
Stanford varsity swimming team to
the intercollegiate meet at the Uni
versity of lowa on April 15 and 16 and
to the A.A.U. meet in Chicago on April
4, 5, and 6, were definitely cancelled
yesterday.
Cancellation was made necessary
because advancement in the dates of
the intercollegiate meet from April 1
and 2 to April 15 and 16 would make
it necessary for the Cardinals to re
main in the East for more than three
weeks. Although the A.A.U. had ap
propriated $1000 for traveling ex
penses for the Cardinal team, the time
that the men would be kept from their
classes is prohibitive.
However, Dave Fall, veteran Stan
ford diver and second-place Olympic
Games diver, will attend the Inter
collegiates to represent Stanford,
while Coach Rrandsten plans to at
tend the national gathering of swim
ming coaches at the same time.
