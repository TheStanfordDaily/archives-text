# Athletic Captains Again!
## 
### 
It was upon a recommendation by Pop Warner that it was decided
not to elect the I ( '2/ football captain until after the first conference game
with the I niversity of Southern California next season. It was pointed
out that the most capable player at the close of the 1926 season would
not necessarily be the best leader for the team the following' year, and
it was therefore for the best interests of the 192/ varsity that such an
action be taken.
There are rumors that the basketball squad is following- in the foot
steps of the football eleven in this respect. Dame Rumor has it that
the captain of the l'>2B quintet will be chosen after the season is under
way next year, in order that the most capable candidate for the position
at that time will lead Stanford against U.S.C. and California. This action
would eliminate the gamble that the man who is elected in 1927 may
leave college, he injured, or have a bad season in 1925.
Husky Hunt, coach of the varsity basketball team, stated that he has
always been in favor of such an action. "It is practically impossible
to foresee how a particular player will perform one year hence." said
Hunt. Several of the northern basketball teams are without captains—
the coach appointing the acting captain just before each contest.
Last April the Executive Committee passed a ruling to the effect:
" 1 hat iK) captain be elected for any athletic team until the end of the
season ; that the position be entirely honorary, allowing the coaches to
appoint a field captain for each contest." The ruling met with such dis
favor on the part of the students, and the athletes themselves, that a
group of students formulated the following petition: "We, the under
signed students, feeling that the action of the Executive Committee in
changing the time of election of captains for various sports was without
proper consideration and discussion, hereby request that the measure be
put to a vote of the student body." The result was a special election, and
the Executive Committee's action was not ratified.
In the regular election in May the same proposition was again put
before the students for a vote, and as before they turned in back without
approving it. The ruling was revoked at the second election by a vote
of 790 to 372. The Daily is strongly against the above-stated proposal,
but the action taken in football, and the action which may be taken in
basketball, is quite different from the measure favored by the Executive
Committee last year.
Captains are essential to the smooth running of any team, but an
incapable leader is more of a handicap than none at all. All the players
who are in suits the first night of practice next season will have an
equal chance to demonstrate their ability for leadership. While politics
can not be entirely disposed of in the election of a,captain, this system
should go a long way toward lessening the evil.
Some such rule as the following might well be incorporated in the
Constitution: "That no captain be elected for an athletic team repre
senting Stanford until after the first conference contest of the season."
This rule would include baseball, track, and tennis, as well as football
and basketball, and all minor sports.
Again the Daily suggests that an award similar to the Aupperle
Medal given in track be presented to the most valuable man in each sport
at the end of ea?h season. The soccer team already has such an award.

action be taken.
There are rumors that the basketball squad is following- in the foot
steps of the football eleven in this respect. Dame Rumor has it that
the captain of the l'>2B quintet will be chosen after the season is under
way next year, in order that the most capable candidate for the position
at that time will lead Stanford against U.S.C. and California. This action
would eliminate the gamble that the man who is elected in 1927 may
leave college, he injured, or have a bad season in 1925.
Husky Hunt, coach of the varsity basketball team, stated that he has
always been in favor of such an action. "It is practically impossible
to foresee how a particular player will perform one year hence." said
Hunt. Several of the northern basketball teams are without captains—
the coach appointing the acting captain just before each contest.
Last April the Executive Committee passed a ruling to the effect:
" 1 hat iK) captain be elected for any athletic team until the end of the
season ; that the position be entirely honorary, allowing the coaches to
appoint a field captain for each contest." The ruling met with such dis
favor on the part of the students, and the athletes themselves, that a
group of students formulated the following petition: "We, the under
signed students, feeling that the action of the Executive Committee in
changing the time of election of captains for various sports was without
proper consideration and discussion, hereby request that the measure be
put to a vote of the student body." The result was a special election, and
the Executive Committee's action was not ratified.
In the regular election in May the same proposition was again put
before the students for a vote, and as before they turned in back without
approving it. The ruling was revoked at the second election by a vote
of 790 to 372. The Daily is strongly against the above-stated proposal,
but the action taken in football, and the action which may be taken in
basketball, is quite different from the measure favored by the Executive
Committee last year.
Captains are essential to the smooth running of any team, but an
incapable leader is more of a handicap than none at all. All the players
who are in suits the first night of practice next season will have an
equal chance to demonstrate their ability for leadership. While politics
can not be entirely disposed of in the election of a,captain, this system
should go a long way toward lessening the evil.
Some such rule as the following might well be incorporated in the
Constitution: "That no captain be elected for an athletic team repre
senting Stanford until after the first conference contest of the season."
This rule would include baseball, track, and tennis, as well as football
and basketball, and all minor sports.
Again the Daily suggests that an award similar to the Aupperle
Medal given in track be presented to the most valuable man in each sport
at the end of ea?h season. The soccer team already has such an award.
It was upon a recommendation by Pop Warner that it was decided
not to elect the I ( '2/ football captain until after the first conference game
with the I niversity of Southern California next season. It was pointed
out that the most capable player at the close of the 1926 season would
not necessarily be the best leader for the team the following' year, and
it was therefore for the best interests of the 192/ varsity that such an
action be taken.
