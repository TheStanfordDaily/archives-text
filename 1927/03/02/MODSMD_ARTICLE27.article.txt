Out of the mire at the University of Utah, The Utah Chronicle presents
in its Society column:
"The second national social sorority to romp to the University of Utah
is Alpha Delta Pi, which will formally install the: local chapter of Delta Theta
as the Beta Gamma chapter. With the coming of Alpha Delta PI, the move
to secure more and better sororities for tho University takes a forward step.
It is hoped that all prejudices will be removed in the near future, and that
other national sororities will follow Alpha Delta Pi in establishing chapters
on our campus."
