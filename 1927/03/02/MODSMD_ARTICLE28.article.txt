HiGHER EDUCATION AND
LOWER SALARIES
The other day some civil service
commission or other sent to the Daily
a sort of advertisement for a junior
astronomer. He was to be a graduate
of a ranking university (profound
how!) He was to have a complete
course in trigonometry, the several
types of geometry, calculus, etcetera,
etcetera, ad infinitum. He was, in
short, to be one of those boys who
spend their time in little rooms under
shaded lights for six or seven years,
getting ready for a career. And he
was to receive ? Ah, yes! He was
to receive eighteen hundred dollars a
year. And advancement was to come
through the display of several assorted
personal virtues which were set forth
in detail.

No, no, gentle reader, this is not a
word of advice to young men telling
them not to take up astronomy. For a
newly graduated student of law gets
about a hundred dollars a month —if
he is lucky. A physician is fortunate
to be able to support himself for the
first few years.
A statistician once estimated that a
college education was worth seventy
five thousand dollars. We wish there
was a market for them at that price.
Think of the money one could make
on commencement day, buying the
things up in wholesale lots and re
selling them under par.

The Men's Council has reprimanded
