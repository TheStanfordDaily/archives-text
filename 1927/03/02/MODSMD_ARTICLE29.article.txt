# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now what do you think of this? !
Saturday night during the time of the j
basketball game, the wife of a San
Francisco doctor who was at the game j
called the campus chapter of her hus- [
band's fraternity and asked them as I
a favor to page the doctor, as there
was an important emergency call
needing his prompt attention.
One of the brothers assumed the j
task and started post haste for the
Pavilion. All excited he rushed up to
the keepers of the gate (God bless,
them); he told them all the facts, yes
—every one. There were three of them
there, and two heads are supposed to
be better than one. But do you imagine
for a moment that they would admit
the message-bearer? Do you possibly
think that one of them would even go
in with him as a guarantor of his j
quick exit after the request for calling;
the doctor had been satisfied? Do you
hold for a second the idea that one of j
them would leave his important post,
though not one of them was doing a
thing, to ask that the doctor be paged? |
Ha! Not at all. They had been told
"not to admit anyone without a ticket" •
and of course they were too indolent
and surly to do anything themselves, i
Nice guys. Good college men. Barnum
said that there was "one born a min-:
ute." We take unusual delight in dif
fering with the circus king; we think j
there are three, and we know where :
they can be found —at the gate.
"God gives us our relatives —but!
thank God we can choose our friends.",
