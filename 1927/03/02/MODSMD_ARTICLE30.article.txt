The Editor. Sir:
I thought that T would "let George !
do it." but the intensity of my irrita-1
tion compels me to resort to this expe- j
ditious manner in an attempt to effect j
relief.
It irkwmy epidermis to tolerate that j
so-called food which the Union sue- !
ceeds in forcing upon the already i
much-abused student.
It is extremely inconvenient to go
to Paly for nutriment, yet the stuff i
that the Union serves has a noticeable I
tendency to drive the students to Paly
for edibles. If the Union would serve
victuals that a person could masticate
Morey would have to wear smoked:
glasses and sell second-hand shoe-1
strings to exist.
After one wraps himself around a
Union-made cheese sandwich, older ;
than any cheese the Swiss could boast i
of; aided by some muddy Java to
wash it down, then, and then only,
can he take an oyster from its dwell
ing and enjoy it.
Just last Friday, one of the boys,
who has lost all taste, displayed his j
nerve by ordering a toasted beef sand
wich—and the finished product that j
one of the impertinent snail-pushers j
set before him resembled a putred j
slice off a worm-eaten yak pressed
between two slabs of charcoal.
The Union sells the best cull j
oranges that can be purchased in these !
parts; and by the odor one might 1
guess that the apples on display were
polished by Wjlliam Tell.
After holding your breath and gulp
ing down a Union-made milk-shake
one experiences that same acute dis
order in the abdominal reeion that
results from sucking too many nest
confined eggs.
The most appetizing sight in the
Union showcases is watching a healthy
green fly light on a white frosted cake.
We have found one Union product

that is not adulterated, and they sell
it by the quart, too! S-s-h —it's Lis
terine.
From observation one might get the
impression that the Union employs
only Sophomore clerks who have de
veloped a natural talent for being dis
courteous into a finished art. One gives
his order and the clerk cuts a few
hyena-like capers and then serves one,
as if one were a leper.
Perhaps it was the foresight of the
Union that caused it to place such a
premium upon its food-stuffs, but one
is inclined to think that the oncoming
war with China would be the only
justification for such prices.
If the quotation is true that "a Uni
versitv progresses on its stomach"
then God pity the status of this Uni
versity in the immediate future.
i say, Lieorge, wouldn't it be possible
for a famished student to purchase
the more relisliable left-overs from the
Commons? —Indigestion Ike.

Just last Friday, one of the boys,
who has lost all taste, displayed his j
nerve by ordering a toasted beef sand
wich—and the finished product that j
one of the impertinent snail-pushers j
set before him resembled a putred j
slice off a worm-eaten yak pressed
between two slabs of charcoal.
The Union sells the best cull j
oranges that can be purchased in these !
parts; and by the odor one might 1
guess that the apples on display were
polished by Wjlliam Tell.
After holding your breath and gulp
ing down a Union-made milk-shake
one experiences that same acute dis
order in the abdominal reeion that
results from sucking too many nest
confined eggs.
The most appetizing sight in the
Union showcases is watching a healthy
green fly light on a white frosted cake.
We have found one Union product

that is not adulterated, and they sell
it by the quart, too! S-s-h —it's Lis
terine.
From observation one might get the
impression that the Union employs
only Sophomore clerks who have de
veloped a natural talent for being dis
courteous into a finished art. One gives
his order and the clerk cuts a few
hyena-like capers and then serves one,
as if one were a leper.
Perhaps it was the foresight of the
Union that caused it to place such a
premium upon its food-stuffs, but one
is inclined to think that the oncoming
war with China would be the only
justification for such prices.
If the quotation is true that "a Uni
versitv progresses on its stomach"
then God pity the status of this Uni
versity in the immediate future.

for a famished student to purchase
the more relisliable left-overs from the
Commons? —Indigestion Ike.
