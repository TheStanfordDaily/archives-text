Dear Bull Session:
It seems to us that you have neg
lected a very significant point in your
late discussion of the Memorial
Church. You will remember that in the
recent earthquake of 190(5 the Al
mighty Hand overthrew both the
Twelve Apostles and the All-Seeing
Eye appertaining thereunto. Possibly it
may comfort you in a more despond
ent moment to reflect that at least
Divine tastes coincide with yours.
In a sincere and helpful spirit,
â€”H.B. and B.F.
