# THE
						AISLE SEAT

### 
Russia, during the period of Michael
! Strogoff, was an interesting country
lin which to travel, if one 'takes cred
■ ence in the picture depicting the ad
ventures of the eminent courier of the
| Czar now playing at the New Stanford
Theatre. What with storms, Tartars,
bears, and Gypsies running all over
the country, the inhabitants must
■ never have had a dull moment.
"Michael Strogoff" starts off with a
| bang, which is followed immediately
1 by a Tartar's falling off a telegraph
'pole. After this promising beginning
| the excitement remains intense, with
| i
, no lapses in interest other than those
[ caused by the hero's registering noble
| emotion until the last few hundred
1 feet. There is included in the film a
! fight gory enough to suit the most
I bloodthirsty, the triumph of justice,
I and the inevitable wedding.
In spite of its slightly improbable
. meanderings of plot, "Michael Stro
! goff" provides a good evening's enter
; tainment. As is the case in all foreign
films, the technical work of produc
: tion is well carried out. The photo
play, with a few notable exceptions, is
! excellent, the color scenes in par
-1 ticular being very well done. Finally,
, the battle and court scenes are ex
j tremely well-directed and effective.
