"All phases of art are influenced by
so-called 'modern art' at the present
time," said Frank Lemos, assistant di
rector of the Stanford Art Gallery, re
cently.
In discussing the progress of realism
in the United States, Lemos remarked.
"It was not very many years ago that
every painting, magazine illustration,
and advertisement attempted to por
tray its subject in the most realistic
manner possible. i
"The pendulum in time has swung
the other way; so that we now have
paintings done in such a broad manner
that they must be seen forty feet away
in order to be recognized at all.
"In attempting to break away from
the so-called 'sweet' style of paintings,
popular in the early 90's, the artists
have resorted to strong vigorous
masses of color. They have adopted
such methods Â«s painting with the
palette knife. This system gives a
bold, vigorous technique almost im
possible to obtain with a brush.
"It is an indisputable fact that the
art of a nation reflects its character.
We have only to study the art and
music of our present time in order to
realize the record which will be left
by this age for future generations to
study."
