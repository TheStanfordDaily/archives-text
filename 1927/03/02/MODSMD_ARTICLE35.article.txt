# STANFORD CONDUCTS STUDY OF BEETLES INJURIOUS TO PINES
## 
### 
Special study of the two beetles that
are most destructive to western pines
is being carried on at Stanford as part
of the investigation which the United
States Bureau of Entomology is mak
ing concerning insects injurious to
forests. The Bureau, a part of the
National Department of Agriculture,
has its Western headquarters at Stan
ford.
The white pine and mountain pine
beetles are the insects under consider
ation at Stanford. The former is espe
cially destructive to the Western yel
low pine, while the latter devastates
the rsugar and lodgepole pines.
The Bureau is making complete
studies of life histories of these beetles
and of all their ecological relations.
The investigators have found that the
insects attack the tree in swarms and
t,o through the bark to the live part
of the trunk, and lay their eggs there.
If the tree is thus invaded, it is killed.
The scientists find that the only way
to check such an epidemic is to fell
the tree, strip the bark from it, and
tither burn the bark or expose it to
the sun. The heat thus applied to the
beetles and the eggs kills them.
The members of the Bureau are
J. M. Miller, director, Dr. H. E. Burke,
P. P. Keene, J. E. Patterson, H. L.
Person, Albert Wagner, and G. It.
