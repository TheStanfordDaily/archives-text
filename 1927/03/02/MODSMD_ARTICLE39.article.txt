# BABE NINE TO MEET SAN JOSE PLAYERS ON STANFORD FIELD
## 
### 
The freshman baseball nine plays i
the San Jose High School team at 3
o'clock this afternoon on the Stanford
field. The freshmen have won three
games in the season so far, losing
only to the Polytechnic and Alameda
high school nines.
Either Leverenz or Simkins will
start on ' the mound for the babes, i
Sparks will catch. Other members
the squad that will probably start rae: j
Levin, first base; Story, second base; i
Bianchi, short stop; Laird, third base; j
Murphy, right field; McCoy or Pease,!
left field; and Berg, center field.
The 1930 outfield showed up strong I
against the Lowell High School team i
last week, turning in a faultless rec-'
ord. The batters for the beginnersj
that have been making some nice hits j
during the last few days' practices
are Berg, Laird, Simkins, and Bianchi. i
With the strengthening of the pitchers
by the addition of Simkins, the babes
should place a formidable team before
the San Jose players.
