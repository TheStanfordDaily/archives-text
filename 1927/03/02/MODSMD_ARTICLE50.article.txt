# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
When the San Francisco Seals sold
their two stars, Waner and Rhyne, to
the Pittsburgh club during the summer
of 1925, many smart baseball men said,
"That means no pennant for the Seals
in 1926, and no regular jobs for two
fine young stars, who can't possibly
replace any of the Pirate regulars."
They were right as far as the San
Francisco club went, for the Seals
could not wiu the Coast League pen
nant the next year without the valu
able services of Paul Waner, who nat
ted .401 the' year before, and Hal
Rliyne, who had batted .315, but they
were wrong about the two rookies
going jobless, for the following June
found the youngsters playing regu
larly in the Pirate line-up.
It is ancient history now, how
Carey's illness gave Waner his chance
in the outiield, and how he made good
w r ith a bang, and how Rhyne soon took
Eddie Moore's job away from him at
second, although he had been a short
stop with the Seals. While Rhvne's
fielding was sensational, his batting

i was a disappointment and he will have
to compete with a brilliant infielder
named Cronin in order to keep his job
this season. It is said that Hal has
i eyes that magnify a moving object,
which would explain his great fielding,
but not his mediocre batting.
Waner quite won the hearts of the
j Pittsburgh fans last year with his
; speed, his throwing arm, and his heavy
hitting, Pittsburgh can easily claim
; the league's batting championship for
their young outfielder, for none of the
half-dozen men who finished with a
higher average played in more than
107 games (Dressier in only 86), while
Paul took part in 144. Only three other
players in the league hit out more
doubles than Waner, and he topped
them all when it came to hitting
triples. And he and his team-mate
Cuyler.were the only birds to tally 100
times during the season. Just one more
line about Paul â€”on last August 26, he
got six hits in six times at bat, and
! included in those bingles were two
doubles and one triple!
