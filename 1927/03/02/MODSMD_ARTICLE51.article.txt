"All novels are of two types, either of
the brain or of the heart, while novelists
are either self-conscious or unself-con
scious," declared Hugh Walpole, famous
English author, in, a lecture Wednesday
night in the Native Sous Auditorium, San
Francisco. "Present-day writers attempt
to tell how life should be lived, or how
it really is lived. Modernists are entirely
self-conscious in their efforts. Thomas
Beer's "Mauve Decade" is an excellent
example of this tendency.
"Victorian English novelists, such as
Dickens, Scott ,and Thackcry, are su
preme examples of unself-conscious nov
elists. They wrote for the sake of wruin?
a story, and employed no so-called "novel
technique." Joseph Conrad, noted Polish
author of sea stories, combines the t\#o
elements of brain and heart to the finest
degree."
