# Bull Fight Losing Place To Gridiron Pastime---Clark
## 
### 
"Football is crowding out the bull
fight in Spain," said Dr. Charles U.
Clark last night in his lecture in the
Little Theatre, "but the Spaniards do
not play intercollegiate matches. They
consider them too brutal.
"One man in Seville," he added,
"asked me if there really were sur
geons in attendance at American
games and if the players actually
broke their arms and legs in the
game.
"The chief element of Spain's
charm," said Dr. Clark, "is the pres
ence, in the midst of her modern Euro
pean civilization, of elements of ori<
ental life which you don't find any
where else in western Europe. South
ern Spain is a great deal like Persia.
"The inter-action of Northern Africa
and Spain also adds to her charm,"
he continued. "The Moor has given
her a different flavor, and in Morocco
she has the greatest pontential wealth
in the world."
Literature Fascinating
The Spanish language and litera
ture Dr. Clark characterized as "al
ways fascinating," and he recom
mended a study of modern Spanish
literature for the enjoyment of its
"brilliancy of observation and natural
ness in presentation." The whole Span
ish history he likened to "a magnifi
cent tragic epic," remarking that "from
the moment they succeeded in making
the people one hundred per cent alike,
they began to degenerate and lost
every bit of their prestige by making
every governmental, economic, and
social mistake possible. It seems neces
sary to have the American inter
action of ideas." He added that Spain
impressed him as being the most
democratic country in the world.
In connection with the showing of a
series of slides from his own photo
graphs, Dr. Clark said, pointing out
the beauties of the Moorish mosque
in Cordova: "No churches in the world
are more nobly suited to their purpose
tliau the Spanish churches; there is
nothing to distract the attention as in
the Italian cathedrals."
Dr. Clark explained the almost uni
versal use of geometric designs in the
Spanish decorations by the fact that
one precept of the old religion forbids
anyone to copy nature.
