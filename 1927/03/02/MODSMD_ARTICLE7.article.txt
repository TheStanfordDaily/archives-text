# JUNIOR WOMEN DOWN SOPHOMORE CAGERS IN CLOSE CONTEST
## 
### 
Rallying power saved the junior wo
men cagers in the face of a serious
threat yesterday afternoon when tliey
defeated the sophomores 32 to 20.
The 1929 women opened the scoring.
At the end of the first quarter they
were behind, 11 to 9, but they pulled
up the score to 17-all at the end of
the half. In the third quarter the
juniors made 10 tallies, holding the
sophomores scoreless. In the last
period the 1929 team made a final
effort and scored 3 points to the
juniors' 5.
At the half, Evalyn Brown, '28, and
Juanita White, '29, both had 12 points
to their credit. Brown finished the
game as high scorer with 20 points.
The sophomore jumping centers,
Chesterlyn Thomas and Mary Crane,
managed to outjump Dorothy Fordyce
and Elizabeth Bakewell fairly consist
ently, the juniors both being inexperi
enced at this position. Dorothy Cone,
'28, and Alice-May Edwards, '29, were
well-matched at side center, Edwards
doing some particularly excellent
work.
The 1929 team will play again this
afternoon, meeting the seniors at 4:20
o'clock on Roble field. After their
showing in yesterday's game, the
sophomores may be counted on to
give the upperclassmen a good battle
if they do not actually defeat them.
