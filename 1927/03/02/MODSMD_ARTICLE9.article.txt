# BAER, SCOTT LEAVE FOR LOS ANGELES TO DEBATE U.S.C.
## CARDS TAKE NEGATIVE Meeting Tomorrow in South Is Second Half of Annual Contest 
### 
Theodore F. Baer and C. Craven
Scott leave tonight for Los Angeles
where they will meet University of
Southern California debaters on the
negative side of the question, "Re
solved, That Mussolini is a benefactor
to Italy," in the second half of the
qnnual Stanford-U.S.C. forensic contest
Thursday.
The Stanford affirmative team
composed of Louis Creveling and Har
old Peterson was defeated on the same
question by the U.S.C. squad Monday
night in the Assembly Hall. Results
of an audience vote taken before and
after the debate showed that the visit
ing speakers had swung the opinions
of sixteen people to their side, while
the Stanford men had changed only
four.
Arthur Syvertson and Sam E. Gates,
the same team that spoke for U.S.C.
last year, will uphold the negative
against Stanford tomorrow night. Both
men are experienced debaters, Syvert
son having been one of the speakers
that defeated the Oxford team for
U.S.C. a year ago.
Baer and Scott have taken a promi
nent part in debating since their
freshman year. Baer, formerly debate
manager, has spoken on the Stanford
team against Kansas, Utah, and the
University of California, as well as
against the Australians last quarter.
He also participated in the Joffre de
bate.
Scott took part in gaining the Stan
ford victory over California last sea
son and was one of the speakers on
the winning team in the contest with
Marquette University.
The debate with U.S.C. Thursday
will be decided by a regular decision.
