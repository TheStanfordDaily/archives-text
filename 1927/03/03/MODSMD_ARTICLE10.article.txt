# JUNIORS MEET '30 TODAY FOR CLASS TITLE IN BASEBALL
## TWO GAMES SCHEDULED Seniors, Sophomores to Play For Third Position in Interclass Series 
### 
Final contests in the interclass base
hall series, with the freshmen facing
the juniors, and the sophomores meet
ing the seniors, are scheduled for this
afternoon at 4 o'clock at the freshman
football field in back of the new tennis
courts, the former struggle to deter
mine the champion, and the latter is
for the purpose of relegating another
team to the cellar.
Freshmen Strong
For the first time in many years,
the first-year men are in a position to
annex the title, and due to a well
earned victory in their game against
the sophomore aggregation, they will
enter the final round slight favorites
against the juniors, who found them
selves just in time on Tuesday to
snatch victory out of defeat for a one
point win over the seniors.
With Tern pieman and Simkins
throwing good ball, the rest of the
nine having found the way to put the
ball out of the infield, and with good
experience from games with outsiders,
the freshmen are the logical winners.
Wilheimy Pitcher
The junior team, however, found a
good pitcher in George Wilheimy, who
was the reason for their victory over
the seniors. Under the coaching of
Will B. Ellington, 1928 should be a
dangerous contender. Wilheimy, when
he took the mound duties in the fifth
inning of the game Tuesday, allowed
but one hit, and fanned several oppos
ing batters.
Seniors Have Edge
In the second game today, with the
sophomores battling the seniors for
the cellar position, the seniors seem
to have a slight edge, but with erratic
playing by most of the members of
both teams much in evidence in the
previous games, it will fall on the
pitchers to carry the heaviest share
of the burden. Harold, of the 1927
team, and Lewis and Kearns will be
the moundsmen.
