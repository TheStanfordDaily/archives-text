The fair and sunny weather
experienced during the first part
of the week has suddenly changed
to rain and clouds, indicating
that the Weather Man has some
thing of a feminine right to
change his poinion.
So far this season there have
been 4.31 inches of rainfall. The
average for the month of Febru
ary, 3|24 inches, has been greatly
exceeded this year, although the
average seasonal record up to
this time has not been reached.
There are 4.25 inches more of
rain due to fall before July 1, if
the complete seasonal average is
to be reached.
