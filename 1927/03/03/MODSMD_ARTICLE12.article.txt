# U.C.L.A. WOMEN LOSE TO CARD DEBATE TEAM
## Negative Debater Declares Control of Caribbean Region Essential MONROE DOCTRINE CITED Affirmative Speaker Calls U.S.-Nicaragua Policy Inconsistent 
### 
Stanford women debaters won by
an audience decision over the team
from the University of California in
Los Angeles when the two teams met
in the Little Theatre last night on the
question, "Resolved, That the policy
of the United States toward Latin
America should be condemned." Stan
ford upheld the affirmative.
U.S. Policy Condemned
Lorraine Reeder, the first speaker
for the affirmative, in condemning the
United States policy pointed out that
it was "inconsistent, discriminatory,
vague and indefinite, and directly con
travenes international law."
"The Monroe Doctrine, that has al
ways set forth American policies to
ward the Caribbean region, has been
distorted until aggression has taken
llie place of the self-defense set forth
in that document," she said.
"Right to Live"
The first speaker for the negative,
Louise Murdock, of the Southern
team, declared that: "The question re
solves into whether or not the United
States has the right to live. If she
has, she has the right to adopt any
legitimate means of continuing her
existence. Control over the Panama
Canal and the Caribbean region js
necessary if she would preserve her
integrity; this can be done only
through keeping foreign powers out
of those regions."
"It is all very well for the United
States to protect her interests In
Latin America," declared Rhoda
Lewis, second speaker for the affirma
tive, "but it is not necessary in so
doing to destroy the sovereignty and
independence of the nations involved.
We would substitute for this policy
of 'imperialism/ one of 'co-operation'
between the United States and the
'A.B.C. Powers.' This would do away
with the evils of the present policy."
