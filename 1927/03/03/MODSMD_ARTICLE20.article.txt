# PUBLICATIONS TO BE UNDER NEW COUNCIL
## Supervising Board Created To Work Under Charter In Journal Control MATTER LONG PENDING Financial, Editorial Control To Be Left to Business Managers, Editors 
### 
Campus publications will, upon the
adoption of the revised constitution,
be under the supervision and control
of a Publications Council which shall
operate under a charter subject to
change or amendment only by the con
current vote of the council and the
Executive Committee.
This was the decision of the revi
sion committee on the much mooted
publications question after a session
with the journalists which lasted until
2 o'c lock yesterday morning. Such ac
tion followed a five-week period of
consideration of the problem.
Ex Committee Vote
Although the charter cannot be
changed except by mutual consent of
the two governing bodies, all actions
of the council are subject to repeal
by a vote of six members of the Execu
tive Committee. This repeal must be
taken within two months after the
ac tion has been passed upon by the
council. No power of initiative is
giyen the Executive Committee with
reference to publications, thereby cur
tailing any editorial control which it
might possibly attempt to exercise.
In order to insure to the council
governing power as well as advisory
authority, it is provided in the charter
that any action of the council shall be
effective upon the concurrent vote of
seven members, even if the manager
and editor of the publication affected
disapprove of the proposed measure.
This provision eliminated the' objec
tion of the revision committee to the
council as merely an advisory body.
Local Control
Immediate financial and editorial
control of each publication shall be
in a body local to that publication, al
though the counc il requires from each
publication at the end of every quar
ter a financial statement covering that
quarter.
Details of organization will be in
corporated in the by-laws of the coun
cil, which are subject to revision only
by that body. The charter contains the
personnel of the council, which shall
include the editors and managers of
the Stanford Daily, Chaparral, Quad,
and Literary Magazine, and the head
of the Division of Journalism.
