Meetings lasting until 2 o'clock in the morning usually have an insidi
ous motive, but there are times when the complicated machinery of
legislation, lubricated with wrenches, brick-bats, and what-nots, keeps
the lawmakers in serious session tor many hours. Diversified opinion
should achieve thoroughly worked-out legislation, but it all takes time.
So it was with the Constitution Revision Committee last Tuesday night.
Five weeks of meetings, discussions, arguments, proposals, compro
mises, and verbal battles culminated at the wee hours Tuesday morning
in an agreement that well satisfied publication heads and the constitution
committee.
Under the new plan the general control of all student publications
shall be vested in a Publications Council. The organization and manage
ment of the various magazines and papers will be in the hands of a
body that is acquainted with the peculiar problems of journalistic en
deavors. Yet the Executive Committee is not deprived of ultimate
control, as it still has the power to repeal any action of this Publications
Council. This control is a desirable provision, for at Stanford the
Executive Committee is the governing body, and it should therefore have
some method of control over all phases of University activities.
The revision committee is looking into the future in forming a
Publications Council which will be permanent and effective.
