# Swimmers to Stay Home
## 
### 
Stanford will not compete in the intercollegiate or the A.A.U. swim
ming meets this year, according to a statement issued yesterday by Coach
Brandsten. The action was taken following a two-week advancement of
the date of the national meet, which would necessitate the Stanford team
staying in the East for three and a half weeks. The students could not
afford such a lengthy vacation from the books in the middle of the
quarter.
- The cancellation of the trip is disappointing to Stanford. The
Cardinal swimmers demonstrated their power in defeating the Hollywood
Athletic Club on Washington's Birthday, after the Club mermen hjd
succeeded in winning from the San Francisco Olympic Club. The
varsity has also defeated the University of Oregon by the one-sided
score of 53 to 6. Oregon had previously defeated California, which
indicates, without a doubt, that the Bears will offer little competition
for the Stanford swimmers in the dual meet this week-end.
In addition to being coast champions, the Stanford athletes have
already broken three Pacific Coast records this season. Stevenson's time
of 1:56.6 in the 150-yard backstroke, O'Connor's time of 2:27.1 in the
220-yard free style, and the relay time of 1:05.2 are all new records for
the Coast and for Stanford.
Such performances as the swimming team has been turning in,
caused the A.A.U. to recognize Stanford's power and to appropriate
$1000 toward defraying the expenses of the squad to Chicago.
It is indeed regrettable that Stanford can not be represented at these
national meets.
