Once again someone has raised a
hue and cry about the food at the
University's several "beaneries."
Certain of the cash customers are
dissatisfied. In their effort to obtain
satisfaction they submit their dissatis
faction to public opinion. And who is
really to blame, if anybody?
As a matter of fact in the dear,
dead days of long ago various private
enterprises flourished on the campus.
It was a matter of free choice to eat
where, when, and what one pleased.
One had. however, to pay the price
charged by the local maitre de hotel,
and that price covered the cost of
food, overhead, and the support of the
family of the said maitre d' hotel.
There was complaint and wail.
There was griping and howling. And
then the University took matters into
its own hands. One by one. the private
enterprises were driven from the cam
pus, and in their places University
owned and managed establishments
sprung up. "Sticky" Wilson's went
under in favor of The Cellar. Green's
gave up the ghost and the Union store
was conceived. Count Togawa
breathed his last shortly before The
Union Cafeteria, Encina Commons* et
al, began to function.
And now, again, one hears com
plaint in the press. And what is the
gist of it? Partially it consists of com
plaints about the food itself. About
this little can be said without a com
plete survey and investigation. But
also there is adverse comment upon
the management. And what of the
management?
All of the University-owned eating
clubs, including Encina Commons,
have pome sort of advisory board—
elected by the cash customers —which
talks over this and that with the ac
tual managers of the University din
ing halls.
The Union dining room, store, and
cafeteria, along with The Cellar and
the Encina store, are run outright by
the administration. In other words,

| every place on the campus at which
the general public may purchase food
is managed by the University. Further
more, in the case ot Encina the board
ers are driven into the dining room
with a figurative big stick.
Now, as a matter of fact, the Uni
versity administration is fundamen
tally honest. No contest on that. It
remains but to ascertain whether or
not it is (in this particular matter)
efficient. And whether or not it makes
i any effort to consider the wants and
i needs of the people who are forced
(the word is used advisedly) to de
pend upon it for their food.
It strikes us that the chief trouble
is that the cash customers feel that
there is no way of making their de
! mands really felt by the University.
At Encina there is, to be sure, an
j advisory board. That board can com
plain at full lung-power for a week
without interruption, but its power to
really accomplish anything is neces
sarily limited by the fact that none
of the residents of Encina may quit
1 paying board. The same goes for
! Roble.
In the University-owned eating
j clubs a somewhat analogous situation
! exists. Individuals may quit, but if
' enough do so the eating club organiza
tions would automatically be unable
i to continue as eating clubs.
The patrons of the Union must ne
cessarily eat there or put themselves
; to the inconvenience of going to Palo
Alto.
One hears little or no complaint
j from Sequoia Eating Club, Breakers
| Club, El Toro, El Campo, or the nu
merous fraternities and sororities. The
! patrons of these tables know that, if
the worst comes to the worst, they
can quit and try eating elsewhere,
i Ordinarily they come back, after hav
j ing learned that one cannot eat at
privately owned restaurants as cheaply
as one can at a table run on a profit
sharing plan. The difference is a mat
ter of principle.

breathed his last shortly before The
Union Cafeteria, Encina Commons* et

And now, again, one hears com
plaint in the press. And what is the
gist of it? Partially it consists of com
plaints about the food itself. About
this little can be said without a com
plete survey and investigation. But
also there is adverse comment upon
the management. And what of the
management?
All of the University-owned eating
clubs, including Encina Commons,
have pome sort of advisory board—
elected by the cash customers —which
talks over this and that with the ac
tual managers of the University din
ing halls.
The Union dining room, store, and
cafeteria, along with The Cellar and
the Encina store, are run outright by
the administration. In other words,

| every place on the campus at which
the general public may purchase food
is managed by the University. Further
more, in the case ot Encina the board
ers are driven into the dining room
with a figurative big stick.
Now, as a matter of fact, the Uni
versity administration is fundamen
tally honest. No contest on that. It
remains but to ascertain whether or
not it is (in this particular matter)
efficient. And whether or not it makes
i any effort to consider the wants and
i needs of the people who are forced
(the word is used advisedly) to de
pend upon it for their food.
It strikes us that the chief trouble
is that the cash customers feel that
there is no way of making their de
! mands really felt by the University.
At Encina there is, to be sure, an
j advisory board. That board can com
plain at full lung-power for a week
without interruption, but its power to
really accomplish anything is neces
sarily limited by the fact that none
of the residents of Encina may quit
1 paying board. The same goes for
! Roble.
In the University-owned eating
j clubs a somewhat analogous situation
! exists. Individuals may quit, but if
' enough do so the eating club organiza
tions would automatically be unable
i to continue as eating clubs.
The patrons of the Union must ne
cessarily eat there or put themselves
; to the inconvenience of going to Palo
Alto.
One hears little or no complaint
j from Sequoia Eating Club, Breakers
| Club, El Toro, El Campo, or the nu
merous fraternities and sororities. The
! patrons of these tables know that, if
the worst comes to the worst, they
can quit and try eating elsewhere,
i Ordinarily they come back, after hav
j ing learned that one cannot eat at
privately owned restaurants as cheaply
as one can at a table run on a profit
sharing plan. The difference is a mat
ter of principle.
Once again someone has raised a
hue and cry about the food at the
University's several "beaneries."
Certain of the cash customers are
dissatisfied. In their effort to obtain
satisfaction they submit their dissatis
faction to public opinion. And who is
really to blame, if anybody?
As a matter of fact in the dear,
dead days of long ago various private
enterprises flourished on the campus.
It was a matter of free choice to eat
where, when, and what one pleased.
One had. however, to pay the price
charged by the local maitre de hotel,
and that price covered the cost of
food, overhead, and the support of the
family of the said maitre d' hotel.
There was complaint and wail.
There was griping and howling. And
then the University took matters into
its own hands. One by one. the private
enterprises were driven from the cam
pus, and in their places University
owned and managed establishments
sprung up. "Sticky" Wilson's went
under in favor of The Cellar. Green's
gave up the ghost and the Union store
