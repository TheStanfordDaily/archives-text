I wish to protest, most strenuously,
against the disgraceful behavior dis
i played Saturday at the basketball
i game. To say the least, it was un
worthy of Stanford. (* * * Blankety

The officials should be compliment
ed for their sincere and able efforts,
i Their only errors were of omission—
j there should have been some techni
cals on the crowd.
I regret that we were denied the
privilege of singing the hymn; how
ever, I realize this was not the fault
of the yell-leader, for the howling mob
was incapable of being directed and
had been so from the middle of the
second half. —Marvin Adams, ex-'3O.
