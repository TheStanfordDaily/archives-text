# CONCERT TONIGHT BRINGS FAMOUS ROSA PONSELLE
## 
### 
• The highest-paid musicians are not
necessarily the best, for the public
popularity is not an infallible gauge
of excellence, but in the case of Rosa
Ponselle, prima donna soprano of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, who
sings in the Stanford Pavilion at 8:15
o'clock tonight, the artist is not only
one of the highest-praised, but also one
of the most expensive soloists on the
concert stage today. Her drawing
power from the box office point of
view is almost unrivalled, especially
by native American artists.
Yet for all her popular appeal, Miss
Ponselle has in no way sacrificed
artistic standards. James Gibbon
Huneker, one of the leading American
musical critics, called Ponselle "a
Caruso in petticoats."
Lovely Voice
"The loveliest voice of any woman
now at the Metropolitan," is the praise
Samuel Chotzinoff of the New York
World bestowed on her.
Miss Ponselle, in fact, made her
debut with Caruso. Since that time she
has created a number of leading roles
at the Metropolitan and made other
parts so distinctly her own that in
"Erani," "William Tell," "Aida," "La
Gioconda," and many other operas
there is only Ponselle, according to
those who know.

Tickets ranging in price from $1 to j
$2.50 are on sale in the lobby of the j
Old Union from 1 to 5 o'clock this j
afternoon.
Miss Ponselle will be assisted by j
Mr. Stuart Ross, pianist. The program I
follows:

Del Destino")

Miss Ponselle
• The highest-paid musicians are not
necessarily the best, for the public
popularity is not an infallible gauge
of excellence, but in the case of Rosa
Ponselle, prima donna soprano of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, who
sings in the Stanford Pavilion at 8:15
o'clock tonight, the artist is not only
one of the highest-praised, but also one
of the most expensive soloists on the
concert stage today. Her drawing
power from the box office point of
view is almost unrivalled, especially
by native American artists.
Yet for all her popular appeal, Miss
Ponselle has in no way sacrificed
artistic standards. James Gibbon
Huneker, one of the leading American
musical critics, called Ponselle "a
Caruso in petticoats."
Lovely Voice
"The loveliest voice of any woman
now at the Metropolitan," is the praise
Samuel Chotzinoff of the New York
World bestowed on her.
Miss Ponselle, in fact, made her
debut with Caruso. Since that time she
has created a number of leading roles
at the Metropolitan and made other
parts so distinctly her own that in
"Erani," "William Tell," "Aida," "La
Gioconda," and many other operas
there is only Ponselle, according to
those who know.
