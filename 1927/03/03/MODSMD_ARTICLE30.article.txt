# WASHINGTON BOXERS TO REVIVE RING GAME FOR SEASON OF 1928
## 
### 
The University of Washington's only j
intercollegiate boxing meet of the year !
was held Wednesday, February 23, when i
the University of British Columbia sent
a six-man team against the Huskies.
Approximately one hundred and fifty j
men have been turning out for boxing at j
Washington this year. From these Coach 1
Rich Palmer has chosen a squad that is j
well versed in the fundamentals of the i
game. The ring sport was revived by ;
popular demand this year after being in
active in 1926. The Husky squad received
challenges last year tliat it was unable to j
accept from Stanford, University of Cali-J
fornia, the University of Oregon, Wash- j
ington State College, and the University |
of British Columbia.
Although it is too late for any more !
meets this year, an extensive campaign
is being planned by Wayne Sutton, direc
tor of boxing, and if the present plans j
are completed, Washingtonians will see i
several meets during the 1928 season.
