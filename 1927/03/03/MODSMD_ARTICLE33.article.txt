### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
'Tis just about four years since
j Mike McTigue, of County Clare, Ire-
S land, gave all the column writers
I something easy to comment on when
| he beat Battling Siki in Dublin on
| St. Patrick's day. "Ducky" Pond's
touchdown that defeated Harvard on a
muddy field is the only other incident
that I can recall that rivaled an Irish
! man getting a chance to win a world's
| title in a fight in Dublin on March 17.
I Too bad that the Knights of Columbus
| had signed up Madison Square Garden
for their annual indoor track meet,
| else Mike would surely be battling
Jack Sharkey two weeks from tonight
instead of tonight.
But the proximity of that Emerald
Date w r as not always lucky for Bold
| Michael. 'Twas just a year ago next

[ March 15 that Jack Delaney stopped
Mike in four rounds, giving him his
first "K.O. by" in the record books,
although Mike still claims that had
not the referee halted the bout the
final story might have been different.
McTigue says that, while he has
been in some tough spots in his
career, the toughest of all wasi when
he fought young Stribling in Georgia
with a broken hand, and with the mob
threatening to kill both him and
Referee Ertle unless their favorite was
given the decision. Many fans, how
ever, think that Mike will find himself
in an even tougher spot tonight when
he faces big Jack Sharkey, who de
feated the even bigger Harry Wills,
whom the much-feared Dempsey would
not fight.
