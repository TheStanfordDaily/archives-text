## 
### 
"Modern art is chaotic, is not nor
mal," stated Leo Katz, prominent
Viennese artist and lecturer, in his
talk given last night under the auspi
ces of Delta Epsilon, honorary art
society. Mr. Katz described the de
velopment of art as a circular motion
wherein good and bad In it are rela
tive to the place in the circle that the
criticism is made.
"Art began with a desire to express
the stability, and the catastrophical
forces of nature," he asserted. "Next
motion, and life were brought into it.
Later the impression of the individu
al's reaction to an object was instilled
in it. This was impressionism. Then
came expressionism; the artist wanted
to paint what he felt, the majesty of
motion, spring, rhythm. In cubism the
trend is agaiji to express the infinite."
