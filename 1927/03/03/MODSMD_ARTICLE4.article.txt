# ‘WAR BABY’ TYPE FOR BARRIE PLAY FOUND RARE AMONG WOMEN
## Campus Searched for Girls To Take Orphan Parts In ''Cinderella" 
### 
An extensive sifting of the Stanford j
"500" was necessary to find among;
their number four women who were ;
fitted to take the parts of the four!
"war babies" in Sir James Barrie's I
"A Kiss for Cinderella," which is to
be presented Friday night in the As
sembly Hall under the auspices of the |
English Club.
Ethelind Thompson, Katheryn Peck,
Lois Irving, and Frances Lawrence
were finally chosen to depict the
French, Belgian, English, and "Swis3"
war orphans.
Through the character of the Swiss j
war orphan Barrie introduces a typical
pathetic note into "A Kiss for Cin- i
derella." In her dream, the starving!
Cinderella, after bringing the children
to Prince Hard-to-Please's ball, fears j
to disclose the true identity of the!
Teutonic waif for fear that the child j
will not be admitted to the affair, at
which "sandwiches buttered on both;
sides" and apples will be served.
"A Kiss for Cinderella," written dur-1
ing the war period, offers a contrast to j
the realistic type of war play that has j
since held sway. The Barrie drama j
appeared in 1915, during the period of [
most war enthusiasm in England, but j
pokes fun at the war rather than |
joins in the inimical feeling.
