# BRITISHER DECLARES ENGLAND'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM TOPSY-TURVY
## Industrial Depression Hits Basic Industries, Says Kenneth Lindsay 
### 
i
The topsy-turvy economic conditions
obtaining in England at present are
due to the fact that basic industries
are depressed while industries devoted
to the production of luxuries are boom
ing. This fact was one of the most
telling of many brought out by Ken-!
neth Lindsay, British labor leader, in |
the Women's Clubhouse under the j
auspices of the Staui'ord Fellowship, j
"In England we have a lingering !
feudalism with none of its benefits," j
Mr. Lindsay stated, "and Englishmen ;
are just beginning to look about and |
take stock. Our great problem, you
know, is to export enough articles to j
balance the 400* million pounds' worth i
of food we have to import annually to j
feed our forty million people."
Lindsay delighted his audience with
his random remarks on how society is
and might be run, frequently inter
spersing typically English flashes of
humor. The speaker was introduced
by John C. Duniway.
