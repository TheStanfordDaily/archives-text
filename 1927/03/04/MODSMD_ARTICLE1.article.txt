# CARD HEN DOPED TO WIN IN DUAL MEET
## Stanford Has Won for Seven Straight Years from The Californians MEN ARE AT TOP FORM Both Varsity and Freshman Teams Will Swim at Encina Pool 
### 
Stanford mermen will enter the En
cina Pool tomorrow at 2:30 o'clock as
lieavy favorites to take their eighth
consecutive victory from the Blue and
Gold. Judging from the results when
Oregon defeated California and lost
53 to G to the Cardinals, dopesters are
giving Stanford the heavy odds.
Coach Brandsten has every man on
the team at the top of his form. With
Williams and Doerr in the 50, and
O'Connor and Christenson in the 100,
Stanford stands well to capture both
of the sprints, since Gilson of Cali
fornia has been declared ineligible.
Hargraves is likely to offer strong
competition to the Cardinal 220 en
tries, Van den Akker and Colin Smith.
Merrill and Bernheim of the Bears
will swim against Ophuls and West in
the breaststroke, and Cox and New
meyer of U.C. will dive against Ted
Smith and Mills.
Should Win Backstroke
Captain Stevenson and Brooks are
entered in the backstroke, and are
figured to place first and second.
There will be two relays in the meet,
one the regular 800-foot four-man race,
in which Stanford will be represented
by Williams, Doerr, Danford, and Har
ris. In the three-man 300-yard medley.
West will swim the breaststroke, Ste
venson the backstroke, and O'Connor
I lie free-style.
