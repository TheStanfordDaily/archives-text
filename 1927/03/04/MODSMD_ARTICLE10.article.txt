# FRESHMEN FAST WHEN DINNER BELL RINGS
## REPORTER VISITS ENCINA Dollar a Day Which Is Paid By Commons Men Less Than Many Places 
### "The Hungry Reporter 
As though the Outside had been
raided the mob crowds through the
doors. In fifteen seconds it is seated
and in twenty more is eating as if the
food were so delicate it would dissolve
into the ether unless consumed within
seven minutes. It may be eagerness or
it may be a desire to get the meal
over with and forget it —the wonder
is not that Sal Hepatica is more stand
ard Encina squipment than frosh caps
used to be, but that anybody survives.
If the freshmen ate as fast at home
as they do here, their shocked fami
lies would call in a doctor and an
alienist.
Try Many Plans
Feeding several hundred students of
as many different tastes on less than
a dollar a day and doing it with any
sort of satisfaction is a diffilcult busi
ness. However are the eating arrange
ments made officially by the Univer
sity now they are the result of years
of improvement, and experiment dur
ing which almost every conceivable
scheme has been tried out.
The theory upon which Encina is
now run is that the University in
sures the fundamentals of buy
ing power, modern and sanitary equip
ment. and expert management. Then
the rest is in the hands of the stu
dents, even to the selection of menu.
There are committees. Like other
democratic devices the theory doesn't
work perfectly, hut the machinery for
student control is there.
Individual Criticism
Individual criticism of the Encina
Commons tends to the picturesque.
The sensitivity induced in most hu
mans who eat at the same place every
day for a long-enough time seems to
be the basis or at least an important
element. A casual visitor has insuffi
cient evidence for judging such allega
tions as condemn white sauce on the
basis of over-use, sage and other sea
soning under some circumstances, oc
casional very durable meat, and the
possible infallibility of dish and silver
ware washers.
The great problem at Encina, ac
cording to Mrs. Etta H. Handy, direc
tor of University dining halls, is to
provide desirably plain and nourishing
food to freshmen who eat such a lot
of it. By their own vote the students
have set one dollar a day as the
maximum and the first essential is to
provide within that limit the quantity
and substance demanded.
Make No Profit
No profit is taken. The surplus last
quarter was only $300, three-fourths of
one per cent of the total business
done, and the sum was carried over
for use this quarter. Spending $2(500
a month for dairy products, according
to the Director, Encina provides more
milk, butter, and ice cream than any
smaller living group can afford.
The dollar-a-day cost to each student
is very low. declares Mrs. Handy, di
rector. Yale University Commons
charges $8.50 for a six-day week, only
one helping is given, and payment is
compulsory for freshmen. Princeton
demands $S a week of freshmen and
sophomores. Harvard has had difficul
ty with concessions charging more
than $10 a week. Michigan .requires
$1.25 a day for one-portion cafeteria
service, and Wisconsin compels all
men in dormitories to pay $84 a quar
ter.
Not Many Breakfast
Breakfast is the least-patronized
meal. During an average month, No
vember, 11,770 lunches were served,
10,933 dinners, but only 6,743 break
fasts. The reason given for the early
breakfast hour is that the student
waiters must attend 8 o'clock classes,
An auxiliary buffet breakfast is not
offered as at Roble. From a quarter of
eight to nine is the Cellar Store's
busiest time.
One in every five meals paid for
at Encina is not eaten, according to
the figures of the director's office
which show an average of 78 per cent
of the possible three-times-a-day at
tendance. A higher quality of food for
those who do eat their ninety meals a
month is made possible by the fact
that twenty-two per cent do not.

The dollar-a-day cost to each student
is very low. declares Mrs. Handy, di
rector. Yale University Commons
charges $8.50 for a six-day week, only
one helping is given, and payment is
compulsory for freshmen. Princeton
demands $S a week of freshmen and
sophomores. Harvard has had difficul
ty with concessions charging more
than $10 a week. Michigan .requires
$1.25 a day for one-portion cafeteria
service, and Wisconsin compels all
men in dormitories to pay $84 a quar

Not Many Breakfast
Breakfast is the least-patronized
meal. During an average month, No
vember, 11,770 lunches were served,
10,933 dinners, but only 6,743 break
fasts. The reason given for the early
breakfast hour is that the student
waiters must attend 8 o'clock classes,
An auxiliary buffet breakfast is not
offered as at Roble. From a quarter of
eight to nine is the Cellar Store's
busiest time.
One in every five meals paid for
at Encina is not eaten, according to
the figures of the director's office
which show an average of 78 per cent
of the possible three-times-a-day at
tendance. A higher quality of food for
those who do eat their ninety meals a
month is made possible by the fact
that twenty-two per cent do not.
(This is the first article of a series sur
veying campus and town eating condi
tions.)
As though the Outside had been
raided the mob crowds through the
doors. In fifteen seconds it is seated
and in twenty more is eating as if the
food were so delicate it would dissolve
into the ether unless consumed within
seven minutes. It may be eagerness or
it may be a desire to get the meal
over with and forget it —the wonder
is not that Sal Hepatica is more stand
ard Encina squipment than frosh caps
used to be, but that anybody survives.
If the freshmen ate as fast at home
as they do here, their shocked fami
lies would call in a doctor and an
alienist.
Try Many Plans
Feeding several hundred students of
as many different tastes on less than
a dollar a day and doing it with any
sort of satisfaction is a diffilcult busi
ness. However are the eating arrange
ments made officially by the Univer
sity now they are the result of years
of improvement, and experiment dur
ing which almost every conceivable
scheme has been tried out.
The theory upon which Encina is
now run is that the University in
sures the fundamentals of buy
ing power, modern and sanitary equip
ment. and expert management. Then
the rest is in the hands of the stu
dents, even to the selection of menu.
There are committees. Like other
democratic devices the theory doesn't

student control is there.
Individual Criticism
Individual criticism of the Encina
Commons tends to the picturesque.
The sensitivity induced in most hu
mans who eat at the same place every
day for a long-enough time seems to
be the basis or at least an important
element. A casual visitor has insuffi
cient evidence for judging such allega
tions as condemn white sauce on the
basis of over-use, sage and other sea
soning under some circumstances, oc
casional very durable meat, and the
possible infallibility of dish and silver
ware washers.
The great problem at Encina, ac
cording to Mrs. Etta H. Handy, direc
tor of University dining halls, is to
provide desirably plain and nourishing
food to freshmen who eat such a lot
of it. By their own vote the students
have set one dollar a day as the
maximum and the first essential is to
provide within that limit the quantity
and substance demanded.
Make No Profit
No profit is taken. The surplus last
quarter was only $300, three-fourths of
one per cent of the total business
done, and the sum was carried over
for use this quarter. Spending $2(500
a month for dairy products, according
to the Director, Encina provides more
milk, butter, and ice cream than any
smaller living group can afford.
