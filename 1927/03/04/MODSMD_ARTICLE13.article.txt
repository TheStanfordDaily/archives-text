. Glenn S. (Pop) Warner, Stanford
football coach, is now working on a
new book. "Football for Coaches and
Players," which will be published by
the University Press about Septem
ber 1, and which he hopes to make
the most complete football text on
the market today.
The book will include all the funda
mentals of the game with charts show
j ing the correct methods of tackling,
punting, and the like. He gives de
tailed technical discussions of how to
play each position and discusses vari
ous theories and types of play.
By the use of perspective drawings
supplemented by the conventional
i charts, Warner has introduced a dif
! ferent system by which he believes
readers of the text will be able to
judge the relative positions of the
players and the ball more accurately.
The drawings which will illustrate
the book were made by Warner and
"Lone Star" Dietz, who played under
him at Carlisle and is now coaching at
the University of Wyoming.
Warner wrote a book of this type
which was published in 1912 while he
was coaching the Carlisle Indians. It
was among the pioneers of football
texts, though both Knute Rockne and
Howard Jones have published similar
manuals in the past four years.
Warner is revising and bringing the
old text up to date, including all the
more recent theories and plays and
the general modern psychological
angle toward both playing and coach
