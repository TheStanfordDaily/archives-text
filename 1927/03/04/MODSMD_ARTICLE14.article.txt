# HOLLYWOOD DIVORCES CAUSED BY PUBLICITY SEEKING SAYS JORDAN
## Actors Too Temperamental; Stars Lack Atmosphere For Home-Making 
### 
Publicity seeking and the lack of a
home-making atmosphere were cited
by Dr. Jordan in the Open Forum
meeting at his home last night as the j
causes of the failure of marriages
among the stars of Hollywood's movie
colony.
"Publicity seeking leads to jealousy
between husband and wife," he de
clared. "Further, many movie people
are temperamental, so-called; this is a
neurotic condition bordering on in
sanity. Such a condition is not condu
cive to compatibility or long mar
riages."
In reply to a question regarding the
present situation in Nicaragua, Dr.
Jordan said, "The Nicaraguan affair
will not end in war. unless it can be j
considered war now."
Regarding the Chinese strife, he
quoted Voltaire's answer to a questiom
concerning the French revolution:
"The future cannot be foretold; there
is no future to foretell." He believes
the Chinese situation is dangerous and
difficult, but does not think the United
States, England, or Japan will be
forced into it.
