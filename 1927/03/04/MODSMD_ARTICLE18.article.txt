Stanford fencers, led by their newly-;
elected captain, G. Zucco, wind up a j
long practice season at 8 o'clock this I
evening in Harmon Gymnasium In the
annual intercollegiate match with the |
University of California.
For eight consecutive years, the
Cardinal fencers have been victorious,
but lack of veteran material this sea
son has hindered Coach Maloney in
the development of the 1927 squad.
California, on the other hand, hav
ing competed for the past two months, i
in the weekly matches of the bay dis
trict bouts of the Amateur Fencing
League of America, has developed one
of the strongest teams in the West,
and according to Coach Maloney, "have |
a team of five which is liable to carry j
off the major honors this year."
Stanford's team of five will be drawn j
from the following: G. Zucco, Ted
Criley (last season's captain), C. Cool-1
idge, Don Aldeu, A. Scotten, R. Hull, j
and Ned Wheldon. Preceding the
bouts, von Arnold, California's fencing
coach, will face E. Bugge, former Paci
