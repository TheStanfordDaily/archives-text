# For Irishers and Others
## 
### 
St. Patrick's Day comes on March 17 as usual. But Stanford will
celebrate the memory of the Saint tomorrow afternoon by the annual
Irish Marathon. Pat was by no means a trackman, but it was not
thought plausible to stage a fight with the national contetti and every
thing, in reverence of the Irish patriot.
Ninety-six men, representing the four undergraduate classes, will
each endeavor to get through a quarter mile of cinders in the six-mile
relay event of tomorrow. The freshmen are the only runners who will
actually carry the color of green, but others will doubtless acquire a
pronounced greenish tint before four hundred and forty yards are put
behind them.
The Holdover show will be presented by the Quadrangle Club before
the relay, to get the runners in a good humor before their great ordeal.
The satire is by, and for, Stanford students, and will be composed
entirely of "good, clean fun."
A pig is in the process of being greased. No, it is not being prepared
for a Catalina swim or even a Lagunita swim, but will be set loose after
the relay for the benefit of the quick and the fearless. The greased-pig
contest is open to all-comers, as is the chicken-chase which is scheduled.
Three-legged, backward, walking, and obstacle races will complete the
entertainment for the afternoon. All-in-all, Stanford will be presenting a
collegiate three-ring circus tomorrow.
"Now folks, immediately following the main show, for a small con
sideration, you will be entertained by a Wild West Show." Stanford and
Santa Llara meet on the baseball diamond in what corresponds to the
after-show. The Broncos will be there.
