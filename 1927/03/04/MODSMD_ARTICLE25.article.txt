Doctor Edward Curtis Franklin, professor of chemistry and dean of
graduate study, celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday on the first day of this
month. He.plans to retire in June. In his honor, men all over the
country have organized to raise a Franklin Fund, the purpose of which
is to create a fellowship that will carry on the spirit of Doctor Franklin's
work.
It is a fine thing to record appreciation of a man's achievements while
he is still alive. A monument of bronze may endure for some time, but
it endures only as a cold and lifeless representative of the man. A monu
ment such as the proposed Franklin Fellowship is a living, vital thing,
and serves to perpetuate the man in spirit.
Stanford is proud to have had on her faculty a man of such distinction
as Doctor Franklin. It is a tribute both to the man and to the University
that such a fellowship should be proposed in his honor, and that leading
scientists from all over the country should have voluntarily offered their
services in carrying out the plan.
