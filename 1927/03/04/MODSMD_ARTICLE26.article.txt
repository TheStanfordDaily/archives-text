Extreme cruelty to mascots as practiced at Oregon Agricultural
College. The O.A.C. Barometer broadcasts:
'Allic' is dead. Sorrow reigns at the Alpha Tan Omega house because
'Allie' was the mascot. She was a small alligator sent from Florida by one
of the members. Tuesday night a "rook" went into see that there was
enough water in the tub for her and found that there was not. He turned
on the hot water —for 'Allie' could not stand cold water —and let it run. The
result was that she was scalded to death."
