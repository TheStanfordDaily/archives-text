Two young and —it is alleged—at
tractive women debaters from the Uni
versity of California in Los Angeles
visited the campus yesterday and
were induced by the Daily's crafty re
porter to commit themselves on sev
eral delicate matters regarding not
only their own institution but also
Stanford.
One of the young ladies, we are
given to understand, was discreetly
reticent, the other, impetuous and
opinionated. From the latter several
interesting items were culled which
appear elsewhere in today's paper.
She could not understand why Stan
ford students did not more enthusias
tically avail themselves of the oppor
tunity of attending chapel, the build
ing being what it is. She was sur
prised to learn that the women not
only had decided to allow themselves
to smoke, but had apparently taken
full advantage of the new privilege.
She commented rather ambiguously
on the proper relation between intelli
gence and beauty, and she threw in
several little suggestions as to social

| technique. Last, but not least, she
thought the Stanford men were "Oh!
I So good-looking." But she thought it
| regrettable that they did not follow
the quaint custom of adorning their
cords in the manner that is in vogue
at the University of California in Los
Angeles. And there, men, lies a yarn!
It appears, if this co-ed be well-in
formed, that the male gentry of the
said university wear very, very, dirty
cords. Not only that, but they deco
rate them with a sort of heraldic in
signia, containing any number of facts
pertinent to the social standing and
amorous history of the wearer.
One finds on a pair of such cords
the following: name of the owner;
name (in the best Grik) of his fra
ternity; comic-pictures, in the ap
proved Sunday supplement manner of
himself and his friends of both sexes;
names of the sororities with any of
: whose members he has at any time
had any relations (social).
Ah me! It makes the old heart glad.
Good old Stanford! With all her faults,
| gents, she is not so bad, not so bad!
