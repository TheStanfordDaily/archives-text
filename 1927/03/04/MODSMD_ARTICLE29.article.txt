# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
"A writer sets himself up as a leader
of men's minds." Obscure quotation.;
It is important for the Stanford Ens—
lish department that their products
are flaunted before the public. Other
departments hide behind masks. For
example it will be years before any
safe judgment of this year's work of
the Graduate School of Business can
be made. They have no publications
to disclose the state of their students'
minds. If they can produce a Hoover
out of this year's class, well done. The
failure will be forgotten. But the un
fortunate English majors are held
forth in all their nakedness for the
world to see. Shame that they are j
i naked.
It is a delicate business attacking
the literati of a community. Men think
only through words, and as the literati
supposedly have all words at their dis- j
posal their advantage is apparent.
Then too, they have been taught tricks
of the trade. Such as calling a critic ,
menchronistic, puritanic, or a Phila-!
Delphian Quaker. This method is very
effective. Last but not least this writ
ten refutation will contain no gram
matical mistakes and punctual errors, j
After all that is why they are given
their degrees.
The student body is initiated to i
some original and forward-looking j
thinking on the part of the campus j
literati. This hiding behind meta
physical epigrams, behind elongated
and profound adjectives is fooling no
one except, perhaps, the professors.
The editorials lack constructive ]
thought and are ofteu pedantically dry. j
The reviews of both plays and books \
are the common stereotype artical of
the daily papers. Although the re-'
viewers there at least receive adequate i
compensation for their hypocracy.
For examples of modern intelligent '
editorial writing we have the last edi
tion of the "Literary Magazine" and
the now famous Red-Shirt editorial
appearing in the "Daily." The very
question of the former is a piece of
of impudent rhetoric and needs no
answer while the latter is a childish
prep school criticism of a childish act.
It. was very ably satirized in to-day's
"Daily."
For very nearly two years I have J
waited for some reviewer to take a
slam at the mediocre theatrical pro
ductions forced down the San Fran
cisco throat. I have waited in vain.
The two reviews in this month's "Lit"
break the camel's back. "Castles in
the Air," which is just about the worst
show I have ever seen, receives the
best of praise. The reviewer terms as
beautiful the most homely chorus I
ever saw grace the stage. (And I con
sider Stanford women good looking.)
On first reading, the review seems
satiristic but is simply the campus
method of patting everyone on the
back, good or bad. It is a good review
as the punctuation is correct and it
contains a few sophisticated phrases.
"Loose Ankles" —"the red headed j
heroine hires two gigolows to amuse
(and compromise) the aunts." Enough
said. The dear boy must have slept
through a couple of acts —perhaps
dreaming of red heads.

As I glance over this paper I repeat
it is unfortunate for the English de
partment. —'28.
