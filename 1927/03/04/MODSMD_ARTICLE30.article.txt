The Editor, Sir:
Two thousand years ago a certain
young Savior of the World fed 5000
on bread and fish and though history
does not emphasize the fact, 4999 of
them complained about the grub since
they could have stayed at home and
eaten the same*combination.
Human nature seldom changes. The
yoor, mistreated class of '30 are
obliged to pay a daily dollar for the
world's most horrible food. They get
the world's worst service from their
waiters, if any. They make the world's
loudest noise in telling the facts to
those who don't care a hand and
couldn't help conditions if they did.
But will they tell anyone responsible
for the food just what they do like
or don't like or why? Well, I should
say not. That person should know
those things by instinct. Incidentally
that person should know those things
by instinct. Incidentally that person is
a conscientious young lady earnestly
trying to learn just what the Sam Hill
the poor mistreated Frosh would like
to eat. The waiters cannot tell her
since all they ever hear about is what
is not liked. Due .to divergence in
tastes this includes everything under
the sun except water and milk. (Per
haps the best food for Frosh after all.)
Well, anyway, the point is. confide
your tastes in your hasher or sponsor
and see if they are not considered in
the next day's menu. —R.A., '27.
