# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Tomorrow night at the annual in
door games of the Inter-Collegiate As
sociation of Amateur Athletics of
America, -the spectators will be treat
ed to the sight of one of the most
graceful of all athletes competing in
one of the most spectacular of all the
track and field events. Sabin Carr,
of Yale, is the athlete, and he will be
seen in his specialty, the pole-vault,
in which event he holds the world's
indoor record.
When Carr soared rhythmically
over the dizzy height of 13 feet. 9 and
one-fourth inches in Madison Square
Garden, New York, on the night of
February 14th, he sent Charley Koff
a nice little Valentine greeting, for
Hoff held the previous world's indoor
record of 13 feet, 8 and one-fourth
inches, though this record has been
"tabled" by the A. A. U. The narrow
margin by which Carr missed going
over 14 feet showed that Hoff's world's
outdoor record of 13 feet, 11 and three
eighths inches was also in danger, and
America's supremacy in the pole-vault
at the 1928 Olympic games seems to
be assured.
Sabin Carr is a worthy successor to
Frank Foss, of Cornell, and Lee
Barnes, of the University of Southern
California, who were America's great
est. vaulters up to this time. I have
always considered Foss's performance
at Antwerp in 1920, when he cleared

a height of 13 feet, 5 inches in a
drizzling rain, as one of the most re
markable records of all time! Sabin
Carr not only beat Lee Barnes in the
outdoor "intercollegiates" last May at
Cambridge with a vault of 13 feet, 2
in< lies, but he has wiped out Barnes's
American record of 13 feet, 8 inches â€”
set at Stanford, Cal. last May 15th.
1 asked this unassuming young
champion if he had helped his vault
ing any by watching Hoff compete
last winter. "Not my vaulting form,"
Carr told me, "for we vault quite
differently, but I learned the value of
increasing my speed from watching
Hoff. I compete in sprint races now
at Yale to help me get down the run
way faster." It seems to work, I'll say.
