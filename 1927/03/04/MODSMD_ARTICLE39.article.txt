"Stanford men do wear awfully
dirty cords, but tliey are not nearly as
artistic as those our men wear," says
Genevieve Temple, member of the de
bating team from University of Cali
fornia in Los Angeles that met the
Stanford debaters Wednesday night.
"Down at U.C.L.A. the men draw
the cleverest pictures all over their
cords. They always put their 'frat'
initials on, and those of the sororities
of the women, they've 'dragged,' " she
continues.
Louise Murdoek, the other member
of the Southern team, also though the
"roughs" could improve their cords by
some artistic decorations.
"Your roughs' cords aren't nearly as
dirty as our men's, either," she says.
"At U.C.L.A. the men only wash their

cords before the Junior-Senior Cord
Dance in the springâ€”they get very
'mellow' before that time."
"The modern girl must have brains
if she expects to be popular and get
ulong well in the world," said Miss
Temple, and Miss Murdoek believes
that "smartness is more desirable than
beauty. The old type of 'clinging-vine'
beauty is 'pass 6' now; girls must be
'smart' to get by. And it takes brains
to achieve this smartness, which con
sists largely in determining your type
and playing it up. However, all types
of brains do not produce smartness,"
she qualified.
"We till thought at U.C.L.A. that
Stanford women would stop smoking
as soon as restrictions on it were
lifted, but we've seen plenty of ash
trays at Roble!" said both women.
