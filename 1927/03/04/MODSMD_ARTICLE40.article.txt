# PEOPLE MUST LEARN TO STAND, SIT, WALK SAYS U.C. INSTRUCTOR

"Nobody knows naturally how to
stand, sit, and walk, so everybody has
to learn," claims Miss Grace Marshall,
head of the department of physical
education for women in the University
of California. "Grace in every move
ment is a characteristic to be culti
vated by college women as much as
energy and agility."
"If a woman has not already had
sufficient training in posture and man
lier of movement, she should work for
that 'well-set-up look' which distin
guishes the woman who moves with
ease fro mthe one who has unjointed,
clumsy aspect. Another aim of all
psysical education for women," con
tinues Miss Marshall, "is to give stu
dents more spontaneous energy and
enthusiasm for whatever phases of
college life occupy their time. College
means much or little to a woman, ac
cording to the degree of her physical
vitality."
