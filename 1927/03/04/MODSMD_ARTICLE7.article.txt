# METROPOLITAN STAR PLEASES WITH LYRIC VOICE, PERSONALITY
## Pianist Wins Approval in Brilliant, Forceful Solo Numbers 
### Frank Mittauer 
Rosa Ponselle, dramatic soprano of
the Metropolitan Opera Company, was
more than pleasing with her rich lyric
voice and her vivid personality in her
concert given last night in the Bas
ketball Pavilion.
Miss Ponselle displayed all the ex
traordinary qualities of voice and tech
nique that have gained for her an
enviable reputation in the musical
world.
The beauty of her voice appeared
to particular advantage in her second
group of numbers which incorporated
four interesting selections. Schumann's
"Stille Thranen" was well received by
the audience. Miss Ponselle graciously
gave an encore after singing this sec
ond group.
Arias from two of Verdi's operas,
"La Forza del Destino" and "Erani,"
composed the first and fourth groups
of Miss Ponselle's concert. Miss Pon
selle appeared in both these brilliant
operas at the Metropolitan scoring
genuine triumphs.
It is difficult to say which of the
arias was the most pleasing as both
were exceptionally fine. The faultless
intonation, the lyric quality displayed
in "Ernani Involami," made this aria
seem most appealing.
Mr. Stuart Ross, Miss Ponselle's
pianist, is deserving of special men
tion. His playing was splendid, show
ing force and brilliance throughout.
Rachmaninoff's "Prelude" and the
"Spanish Dance" of Granados, as Mr.
Ross played them, were high lights of
the concert.
