| The "average fraternity" on the
I Stnaford University row provides
i three meals a day for twenty-three
' members and charges them $33.80 a
i month for board.
The "average sorority" serves nine
! teen and charges $39.
Budgeted board prices among the
; twenty-four Stanford fraternities and
ten sororities range from a dollar to a
dollar and a half a day with averages
as stated above. What the real total
cost is of wielding Greek letter knives
and forks for a college year, even the
'< house managers do not know with any
I great certitude.
The student house manager com
| muning with the cook on the month's
menus has not only different problems
but different purposes than the Uni
versity's exports directing the huge
kitchen's of Encina and the Union. Any
comparison of the halls and the ro.v
is unfair unless it takes this into ac
count.
i The Greek letter houses strive for a

certain characteristic "atmosphere" :n
addition to dispensing nutriment. The
members pay in full for both, but not
all under the item directly labeled
!board.
I
In the sororities assessments are
levied for special teas and lunches.
; At only one fraternity is milk provided
j at lunch and dinner although in all it
may be bought extra by those desir
| ing it.
Where fraternity and sorority food
is better and more attractively served
' than at the halls, Union, or eating
i clubs, it seems to be because more is
paid for it, the social organizations
i having only a greater spirit of indi
vidual co-operation to offset the me
chanical and buying power advantages
of the larger kitchens.
While partially met by special as
sessments the costs of entertaining
visiting members and other guests,
peripatetically ravenous Jionor socie
ties and freshmen to be impressed dur
i ing the rushing season must in the
nature of tilings also affect the quality
of food tlie Greek organizations pro-!
vide their members.
"Hashing" is an extensive, well-es
teemed profession. The sororities each ;
employ two or three men students for
this. At one time each fraternity com
monly hired freshmen or members of
other groups, but now all are served
by their own members who don white 1
coats and become impersonal for the !
duration of the meal.
The "kitchen buffet" for breakfast ■
is a universal institution on the row. :
At some houses service is available J
but at most the more or less scantily'•
attired member manages the morning; |
meal with only the assistance of the
cook.
Row kitchens could provide dele-1
gates to a highly assorted league of!
nations. Thirteen Chinamen are a
plurality. Eight negro cooks are em- 1
ployed, five "American," two Scotch, |
a German, Japanese, French, Filipino. !
and Irishman. One sorority has had
the same cook for more than ten years j
and five fraternities have had two I
each since October. The sororities;
change kitchen personnel less fre-j
quently than do the fraternities.
Sequoia Eating Club is about mid-!
way in type between Encina Commons j
and a typical fraternity. Entirely a co-1
operative enterprise of the men in the i
hall, the dining room is run on a i
budgeted amount slightly less than a j
dollar a day. About ninety members '
are served.
To a casual observer, Sequoia ap- ;
pears to achieve the kind of associa- j
tion among the students which was the j
object of the University in dividing '
Encina Commons into a number of
dining rooms and encouraging the eat
ing clubs. In answer to a deafening
bell the students sit at round tables.
Some degree of leisure in eating is
observed in contrast to the gulping j
haste at Encina and when the mood ;
comes upon them the members burst !
into songs indicative of militant senti-!
ment concerning the University of
California.
Sequoia food, like that of many fra- |
ternities, seems to satisfy the mem- ;
bers as much because they feel di
rectly responsible for it as because'
of good quality.
The Chinese Club has one of the ;
most ingenious solutions of the eating 1

problem. The members cook for each
other and take their turns as chef,
dishwasher, and waiter. This co-opera
tive effort effects remarkable economy.
In the Japanese Club a cook of the
same nationality is employed. When
there are special guests the duties of
waiter devolve on the sophomores.

| The "average fraternity" on the
I Stnaford University row provides
i three meals a day for twenty-three
' members and charges them $33.80 a
i month for board.
The "average sorority" serves nine
! teen and charges $39.
Budgeted board prices among the
; twenty-four Stanford fraternities and
ten sororities range from a dollar to a
dollar and a half a day with averages
as stated above. What the real total
cost is of wielding Greek letter knives
and forks for a college year, even the
'< house managers do not know with any
I great certitude.
The student house manager com
| muning with the cook on the month's
menus has not only different problems
but different purposes than the Uni
versity's exports directing the huge
kitchen's of Encina and the Union. Any
comparison of the halls and the ro.v
is unfair unless it takes this into ac
count.
i The Greek letter houses strive for a

certain characteristic "atmosphere" :n
addition to dispensing nutriment. The
members pay in full for both, but not
all under the item directly labeled
!board.
I
In the sororities assessments are
levied for special teas and lunches.
; At only one fraternity is milk provided
j at lunch and dinner although in all it
may be bought extra by those desir
| ing it.
Where fraternity and sorority food
is better and more attractively served
' than at the halls, Union, or eating
i clubs, it seems to be because more is
paid for it, the social organizations
i having only a greater spirit of indi
vidual co-operation to offset the me
chanical and buying power advantages
of the larger kitchens.
While partially met by special as
sessments the costs of entertaining
visiting members and other guests,
peripatetically ravenous Jionor socie
ties and freshmen to be impressed dur
i ing the rushing season must in the
nature of tilings also affect the quality
of food tlie Greek organizations pro-!
vide their members.
"Hashing" is an extensive, well-es
teemed profession. The sororities each ;
employ two or three men students for
this. At one time each fraternity com
monly hired freshmen or members of
other groups, but now all are served
by their own members who don white 1
coats and become impersonal for the !
duration of the meal.
The "kitchen buffet" for breakfast ■
is a universal institution on the row. :
At some houses service is available J
but at most the more or less scantily'•
attired member manages the morning; |
meal with only the assistance of the
cook.
Row kitchens could provide dele-1
gates to a highly assorted league of!
nations. Thirteen Chinamen are a
plurality. Eight negro cooks are em- 1
ployed, five "American," two Scotch, |
a German, Japanese, French, Filipino. !
and Irishman. One sorority has had
the same cook for more than ten years j
and five fraternities have had two I
each since October. The sororities;
change kitchen personnel less fre-j
quently than do the fraternities.
Sequoia Eating Club is about mid-!
way in type between Encina Commons j
and a typical fraternity. Entirely a co-1
operative enterprise of the men in the i
hall, the dining room is run on a i
budgeted amount slightly less than a j
dollar a day. About ninety members '
are served.
To a casual observer, Sequoia ap- ;
pears to achieve the kind of associa- j
tion among the students which was the j
object of the University in dividing '
Encina Commons into a number of
dining rooms and encouraging the eat
ing clubs. In answer to a deafening
bell the students sit at round tables.
