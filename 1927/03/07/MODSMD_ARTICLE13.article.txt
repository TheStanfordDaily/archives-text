# ENGLISH CLUB OFFERING SATISFIES AUDIENCE WITH WORTH-WHILE IN PLAYS
## Peggy Randall, as Cinderella, Makes Squalid Fairyland, Things Commonplace, Non-Existent 
### Raymond Haizlip 
The English Club, in so far as it
had anything to do with "A Kiss For
Cinderella," has agtfffi sent an audi

Play Grows Worse
From this excellent beginning the
play grew worse as time wore on. In
staging such delicacies as "A Kiss For
Cinderella" there is always the local
danger of adjustment to the complexes
of a standard campus audience. Per
