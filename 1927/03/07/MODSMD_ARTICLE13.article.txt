# ENGLISH CLUB OFFERING SATISFIES AUDIENCE WITH WORTH-WHILE IN PLAYS
## Peggy Randall, as Cinderella, Makes Squalid Fairyland, Things Commonplace, Non-Existent 
### Raymond Haizlip 
The English Club, in so far as it
had anything to do with "A Kiss For
Cinderella," has agtfffi sent an audi
ence away satisfied with the worth- j
while in plays" We may as well give
the English Club nominal credit at
least, even though Gordon Davis was .
the sole post-regal power.
Finesse in First Act
The play got oft' to a good start, in
spite of the overture. The first act j
displayed a finesse, a thoroughness oLi
direction which quickly enveloped the
audience in a genuine English v/ar
tiine atmosphere. This effect was fur-j
tiier enlivened by the sparkle and
warmth of maturity put into the char
acterization of Mr. Bodie by Howard
Wickersham. From this a good sus
pense v.-as built up into which Cin
derella was injected. Mac Lewis as i
the policeman was too typically Ameri
can to be convincing as a London
bobby; he came into his own. how-j
ever, with fastidiousness in the ball
room, which infallibly proves him a
gentleman. 1

Then came that delightful creature,
Cinderella, in which role Peggy Ran
dall will long be remembered. It
wasn't her technique particularly, nor
any of the hors d'oeuvres, but the vital
appeal which she radiated from the
heart of the waif. All squalor of en
virons and things commonplace be
came suddenly non-existent. Her elfish
magic whisked us away to a cloud
bank adjacent to fairyland, from which
we watched the sun rise on a field of
daisies while spirits danced and pipes
played whimsical strains in the dis
tance. Nor did we adequately recover
our prosaic senses until awakened by
an earthly gong the next morning.
Play Grows Worse
From this excellent beginning the
play grew worse as time wore on. In
staging such delicacies as "A Kiss For
Cinderella" there is always the local
danger of adjustment to the complexes
of a standard campus audience. Per
haps the mark was slightly missed in
not securing four war orphans who
were small enough for their boxes, or
in not making the box to fit the babe
since the babe clearly strained the
box. Failing this, they should at least
have been made less conspicuous. The
ludicrousness of it dealt our romantic
senses a blow from the rear. The pain
was partially allayed, however, by the
cunning performance of the orphans'
gallery during the royal ball. The in
fantile spontaneity of Frances Lau
rence was distinctly cute at this point.
The ballroom scene with its excep
tional potentialities for whimsy took
the drubbing of the evening. Much
more beauty could have adorned the
setting; it was disappointingly bare
and rough. That vague muffled dainti
ness of make-believe was lacking.
Noise disturbed our imaginative soft
ness of plush royal robes. Not less
unfinished were the mob scenes. The
courtiers were a total loss; they con
tributed nothing to the atmosphere of
the act.
Leads Save Play
The principals, however, made an
eleventh-hour rescue. The king, pom
pous as only Cinderella could imagine,
was given a rich comedy treatment by
Kenneth Lloyd. Mac Lewis, in his
more effective role as Prince-Hard-to-
Please, re-established himself. The
beauts, seven of 'em, atrociously made
up, robbed the term "hard-to-please"
of its intended accuracy. The panto
mime of Robert Watkins as Lord
Times and Stevens Halsted as the
Censor was well worked out. In fact,
all the principal characters revealed a
deft direction. For this. Director Gor
don Davis deserves exceptional credit.
Campus actors aren't the easiest ones
in the world to mould. But other as
pects were none the less neglected.
It must be said in all fairness that
time was short. But a few days to pro
duce a difficult play looked at the out
set to be an impossibility. But this is
matter in explanation, not excuse.
The last act could easily have been
dispensed with; it would never have
been missed after the touching close
of the ball, as the bells in the tower
tolled Cinderella's knell. But, of
course, poetic justice must be awarded,
and so it was, principally to Peggy
Randall, whose outstanding perform
ance was a great personal triumph.
