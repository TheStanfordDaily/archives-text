# POWER TO DISSOLVE ORGANIZATIONS GIVEN TO EXECUTIVE BODY
## Measure Tentative; Living Groups Excepted from New Ruling 
### 
Power to dissolve any organization,
with the exception of living groups,
receiving dues or funds from students
| was tentatively vested in the Execu
i tive Committee by the revision body
| at its meeting Friday.
This power can be exercised by the
| Executive Committee when in its
' opinion the organization in question
: lias outlived its use. It can thus exer
| cise disciplinary control over such or
j ganizations should they violate any
j rules of social conduct or financial re
| sponsibility.
Belief that the governing body would
; always act in such cases in a reason
! able manner overcame the objection
j that the vesting of such power in them
; would be too arbitrary. The alterna
j tive of giving to the Men's Council
| similar power when rules of social
j conduct were violated was rejected
i because it was thought advisable to
| centralize such control in one body.
The body definitely decided that the
| Women's Debate Manager should sit
on the Debate Council, and that wo
men's forensic activities should be
subject to the general policy of that
Council. This action was taken pri
marily to avoid conflict in dates of
scheduled debates.
Revision of the written form and
mechanical structure of the tentative
constitution will be undertaken by the
committee during the coming vacation
period. The completed document will
then be submitted to the members of
i the committee for approval at their
| next meeting early next quarter, for
j which no definite date has yet been
; set. After approval by the revision
'committee, it will be sent to the Execu
tive Committee, and thence submitted
j to the student body at a special elec
tion.
