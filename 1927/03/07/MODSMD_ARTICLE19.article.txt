# "ARIES," DANCE DRAMA, WILL BE GIVEN TUESDAY
## Randall, Spirito, Eubanks Take Leading Roles in Elaborate Program SIMILAR TO "MIRACLE" Color, Grouping, Motion to Be United in Staging Of New Art Form 
### Hallie Keating 
"Aries," dance drama to be pre
sented tomorrow evening, March 8, in
the Assembly Hall, will be one of the
most ambitious programs ever pre
sented on this campus. It depends for
interpretative effect chiefly on the
combined effect of color, music, and
mass movement rather than on pan
tomime, or individual dances. The
same principles were used in "The
Miracle," recently produced by Morris
Gest in San Francisco, one of the most
conspicuous examples of this type of
pioduction. "Aries"iivs v not on the pag
eant order, but is essentially a dance
drama.
Randall, Spirito, in Solos
\ elma Randall, as Intelligence, and
Olga Spirito, as Primitive Man, carry
the major part of the solo work. Bar
liaia Ann Eubanks, well-known for
her ballet work upon the campus, as
Lightning, does a solo dance with dif
ficult scarf work.
\\ ith the first dance of the primi
tives, a slow, groping theme move
ment is introduced, representing the
primitive struggles, as contrasted with
the theme of victory. These two
themes are followed throughout the
diama, until at last the Victory dance
at the end, where Man seizes a flaming
torch and secures himself against the
power of the elements, a climax of
rapid couple movements is reached,
securing a pitch of high dramatic in
tensity.
I nlike most programs of exhibition
dancing, this is not confined to pas
toral solos, but combines all types of
work. The dance of Fire, a group
dance in the second act, is a particu
larly interesting work, depending upon
timing and grouping, of the most diffi
cult kind.
"Aries," and the program following
it, will take the place of the usual
Tuesday night lecture. It will be open
to the public.
