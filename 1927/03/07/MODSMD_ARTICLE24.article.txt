# Football and Track Rules
## 
### 
Tt was a big- week-end for those that like to play with athletic rules.
Changes were mare in both football and track—some are beneficial, some
are detrimental, and some are doubtful, but worthy of a fair trial.
I he most drastic alteration of the rules came in the hurdle event in
tracfl !he I.C.A.A.A.A. officials at their annual meeting- Saturday
decided that the weight of the hurdles should be increased from sixteen
to twenty-four pounds, but that a runner should not be disqualified for
kicking over three or more hurdles. In the future the hurdlers can don
shin portectors and run right through the barriers and still win the race.
The plunging fullback should be a big star on the track from now on.
Ihe reason given for this change is that hitting a hudle is enough
handicap in itself, in that the runner is thrown out of his stride.
It was believed that increasing the weight of the hurdles would
prevent the runner from purposely knocking down the sticks. But in
the heat of a close race, it is doubtful as how much twenty-four pounds
of wood will stop a strong man.
But the officials rather recouped themselves on their next change.
The associated voted to abolish the one-yard penalty for one false hurdle
start, but decided to disqualify the man that breaks the gun the second
time. This rule is good, in that a hurdler is set back a yard, loses his step,
which is so important for an accurate hurdler.
\\ bile these changes were made in the track sport, the intercollegiate
football rules committee was not idle. The men on this committee were
doing their best to keep up with their brothers on the track.
The goal posts have been moved back ten yards behind each end of
the held. The reasons given for this change were that it made the
uprights more difficult to shoot at, either for field goals or for the extra
point after a touchdown, and that the posts are dangerous at their former
positions. The latter reason is the only one that is at all justified, and
even then, few casualties have ever occurred because of players running
into goal posts. Drop-kicks and place-kicks, are a part of American
football, and are features that allows the man that is not all brute, to star.
Js means that the teams that used to try a placement at the thirty-five
yard line will now wait until the fullback has bucked the ball live yards
further down the field.

The "Notre Dame" shift lias been retained, with one so-called "safe
guard." A stop of one second is required between shifts, and the penalty
for the violation of this rule is now a fifteen-yard penalty instead of five
yards. The reason given for changing the shift is that it puts too mych
responsibility on the refree in deciding whether a backfield comes to an
absolute stop. Now even more responsibility is put upon the official's
shoulders in that the penalty is now three times as gerat. It will lead to
squabbles and fights galore on the field when a strict referee is working
the game.
The third change in the rules is in calling the ball "dead" after a punt
has been fumbled by the safety man. This takes a part of the thrill out
of the contest. It is true that many touchdowns have been made from
picking 1 up the ball that the safety man has fumbled, and running to a
touchdown, but it is doubtful if this is not just as well. The new rule
takes some of the premium off of the man that is a safe safety man.
The rules could be better, but the followers of intercollegiate athletics
should be thankful that the body did nothing worse than they did. They
might have eliminated the fullback.

The associated voted to abolish the one-yard penalty for one false hurdle
start, but decided to disqualify the man that breaks the gun the second
time. This rule is good, in that a hurdler is set back a yard, loses his step,
which is so important for an accurate hurdler.
\\ bile these changes were made in the track sport, the intercollegiate
football rules committee was not idle. The men on this committee were
doing their best to keep up with their brothers on the track.
The goal posts have been moved back ten yards behind each end of
the held. The reasons given for this change were that it made the
uprights more difficult to shoot at, either for field goals or for the extra
point after a touchdown, and that the posts are dangerous at their former
positions. The latter reason is the only one that is at all justified, and
even then, few casualties have ever occurred because of players running
into goal posts. Drop-kicks and place-kicks, are a part of American
football, and are features that allows the man that is not all brute, to star.
Js means that the teams that used to try a placement at the thirty-five
yard line will now wait until the fullback has bucked the ball live yards
further down the field.

The "Notre Dame" shift lias been retained, with one so-called "safe
guard." A stop of one second is required between shifts, and the penalty
for the violation of this rule is now a fifteen-yard penalty instead of five
yards. The reason given for changing the shift is that it puts too mych
responsibility on the refree in deciding whether a backfield comes to an
absolute stop. Now even more responsibility is put upon the official's
shoulders in that the penalty is now three times as gerat. It will lead to
squabbles and fights galore on the field when a strict referee is working
the game.
The third change in the rules is in calling the ball "dead" after a punt
has been fumbled by the safety man. This takes a part of the thrill out
of the contest. It is true that many touchdowns have been made from
picking 1 up the ball that the safety man has fumbled, and running to a
touchdown, but it is doubtful if this is not just as well. The new rule
takes some of the premium off of the man that is a safe safety man.
The rules could be better, but the followers of intercollegiate athletics
should be thankful that the body did nothing worse than they did. They
might have eliminated the fullback.
Tt was a big- week-end for those that like to play with athletic rules.
Changes were mare in both football and track—some are beneficial, some
are detrimental, and some are doubtful, but worthy of a fair trial.
I he most drastic alteration of the rules came in the hurdle event in
tracfl !he I.C.A.A.A.A. officials at their annual meeting- Saturday
decided that the weight of the hurdles should be increased from sixteen
to twenty-four pounds, but that a runner should not be disqualified for
kicking over three or more hurdles. In the future the hurdlers can don
shin portectors and run right through the barriers and still win the race.
The plunging fullback should be a big star on the track from now on.
Ihe reason given for this change is that hitting a hudle is enough
handicap in itself, in that the runner is thrown out of his stride.
It was believed that increasing the weight of the hurdles would
prevent the runner from purposely knocking down the sticks. But in
the heat of a close race, it is doubtful as how much twenty-four pounds
of wood will stop a strong man.
But the officials rather recouped themselves on their next change.
