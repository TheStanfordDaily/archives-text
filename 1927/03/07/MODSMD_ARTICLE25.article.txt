"College men are just 'little boys',"
stated Lenore IJlric, famous stage and
screen stars, in a recent interview
with a Daily Princetonian reporter,
"but that makes them much more at
tractive than men-about-town."
"Underneath their external sophisti
cation there is an enthralling frank
ness and earnestness about college
men. The man-about-town, on the other
hand, has a much deeper polish, but
he is apt to be hard underneath. As
for playing college towns," Miss Ulric
declared, "it is a delightful experience.
Many actors and actresses dislike
playing before a university audience
because of the razzing, but I consider
it a stimulant."
