CRITICISM OF CRITICISM
Hardly a day goes by but what some
irate subscriber crashes into print
with a complaint concerning this or
that on the campus. All well and good.
The Daily has set aside an entire
column for the express purpose of al
lowing the .said irate subscribers an
opportunity to blow off steam. So long
as the steam represents an honest
heat worked up over some matter that
is not what it might be, everything is
okeh.
The difficulty arises when the self
appointed deliberately directs
his diatribe at some person or group
in no sense subject tcT blame for the
specific objectionable condition.
Both in the editorial column and in
this one, the Daily makes an attempt
to be fair. That is to say, when we
wish to register a complaint against
something or other, w-e try to ascer
tain just who is to blame, and lay the
matter at the door of the proper party.
If no individual or organization is ap
parently responsible, the complaint is
dropped, after an appeal to public
opinion.
Now the irate subscribers, probably
for a lack of experience in this sort
of thing, are not always so careful.
As a result, a letter occasionally comes
in calling down anathema upon an
innocent party. There are many exam-

I pies i npoint.
Recently a long-winded epistle was
] printed which purported to be in
spired by faulty grammar, diction, and
style of the Literary Magazine and
this paper. The author of the letter
may or may not have been justified in
allowing himself to get all steamed up
over this affair. That is a matter of
opinion. And he was simply giving his
opinion. He made a grave error, liow
j ever, in endeavoring to fix the blame
for the matter on the English depart
ment. As a matter of fact, the English
Department has absolutely no direct
connection either with the Daily or
with the"Lit." Both are student pub-
I lications, and the only qualifications
of contributors to either one over
which the English Department could
possibly be presumed to have any con
trol is that matter of passing the
bonehead exam before matriculating
, in the freshman year.
In this particular case no great harm
was done, but the example will serve.
Criticism, complaint, even an occa
i sional wlrine may be written with a
certain degree of justice. But no letter
; may be presumed to be helping mat
ters if it places the responsibility for
an undesirable state of affairs upon
some individual or organization that
is absolutely powerless to effect a
j remedy.
