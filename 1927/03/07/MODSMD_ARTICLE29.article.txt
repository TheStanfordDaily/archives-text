The Editor, Sir:
A vast amount of credit is due the !
informed bureauracy that selects our
plays. Through its untiring efforts 011
our humble behalf, our youthful eyes
shall not witness the presentation of
abortions such as now soil New York
theaters. Thank heaven, our drama- j
tics are clean, Clean, CLEAN! Vice 1
would have on our stage about as
much chance as Clara Bow would
have with a wooden leg. In our lat
ticed, open-air theater there is no need
for mother to leave with nine-year-old
Johnny as the curtain goes down on
the first act. The entire family may
here enjoy a worthwhile production j
without the fear of filth which never
quite leaves old ladies at plays now
showing in some parts of our wicked
country. No indeedy! Nowadays a
Stanford man says to his escort from
California, "Shall we take in 'Goldi
locks and the Three Bears' tonight?" I
Of course she answers immediately,
"My, yes! I've wanted to see it for
ever so long. - ' Moreover, Stanford co
eds, while debating how to spend an
evening may hit on "Hop O' My ,

1 Thump" or "See-Saw, Majory Daw."

So they are, truly. Even the actors
and the actoreens appear happy in the
stunning photographs from this week's
fairy tale. The actresses look for all
the world like bedimpled cherubs;
while certain of the so-called mascu
line support seem too pleased to play
i cheerful personages from an imagi
nary land. It IS exciting. They're in
; a fairy tale, can never grow old. will
always be Peter Pans, each with pipes
on which to play the songs of child
hood.
For the coming May, I suggest a
huge pageant to be held on the cam-
I pus, in which the entire student body,
; plus any adults that are children still,
may take part, now that Stanford is
being rejuvenated. And, oh yes! I
almost forgot to mention that the
most adorable toys are on sale at
Woolworth.'s. Dolls for the girls!
Kites for the boys! Needless to say,
these articles are not beyond the
means of any child's savings bank,
particularly those owned by members
of Leland Stanford Junior University.
