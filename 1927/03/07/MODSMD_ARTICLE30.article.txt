# PRINCETON SENIOR COUNCIL RESIGNS IN PROTEST PRINCIPLE OF AUTO PROHIBITION IS RESISTED DEAN OF MEN IS RAZZED BY PUBLICATIONS
## 
### 
As a sequel to faculty prohibition of
student automobiles on the campus,
the senior council of Princeton Univer
sity, undergraduate governing body,
which represents the self-government
of the college, tendered its resignation
to the student body Tuesday to take
effect immediately.
Principle at Stake
The chairman of the council, when
Explaining the decision of the mem
bers, said that the men were expres
sing neither approval nor disapproval
of the ruling, but were concerned en
tirely with the principle at stake. He
admitted that a decision vitally af
fecting undergraduate life has been
reached with disregard for student
opinion.
Last week the faculty ordered that
no student while at Princeton should
own or operate automobiles. Their
reasons were the lower scholastic ave
rage of motorists and the seven fatali
ties in a year in which student motor
ists figured. A year ago the senior
council passed several regulatory mea
sures, but in the opinion of the faculty
these failed to remedy the situation,
and other restrictions were sought.
The council, however, failed to heed
the faculty's request.
Located in Country
One of the most grievous objections
to the new ruling is in connection
with the location of Princeton itself.
The university is situated in the coun
try, and students have been accus

| lomed to meet their fair guests at the
railroad station several miles from the
campus for week-end dances or enter
j tainments.
Dean Christian Gauss was largely re
, sponsible for the auto ban, which will
go into effect July 1. He is the object
| of much mock publicity issued by the
I Daily Princetonian, and other univer-
I f?ity publications.
Statement by Dean
In announcing the new regulation,
Christian Gauss said: "In a small,
closely-built, democratic community
like Princeton, where there are no
1 long distances, cars are an unneces
sary adjunct to college life. An un-
I necessary car is an unnecessary ex
i pense.
"Our statistics show that the record
of automobile owners for scholarship,
| for attendance, and for conduct is be
low the general average of the college.
Serious and tragic accidents have been
too frequent to warrant a continuance
of the risks involved in the mainten
ance of a doubtful convenience, and a
probable academic handicap."

Principle at Stake
The chairman of the council, when
Explaining the decision of the mem
bers, said that the men were expres
sing neither approval nor disapproval
of the ruling, but were concerned en
tirely with the principle at stake. He
admitted that a decision vitally af
fecting undergraduate life has been
reached with disregard for student
opinion.
Last week the faculty ordered that
no student while at Princeton should
own or operate automobiles. Their
reasons were the lower scholastic ave
rage of motorists and the seven fatali
ties in a year in which student motor
ists figured. A year ago the senior
council passed several regulatory mea
sures, but in the opinion of the faculty
these failed to remedy the situation,
and other restrictions were sought.
The council, however, failed to heed
the faculty's request.
Located in Country
One of the most grievous objections
to the new ruling is in connection
with the location of Princeton itself.
The university is situated in the coun
try, and students have been accus

| lomed to meet their fair guests at the
railroad station several miles from the
campus for week-end dances or enter
j tainments.
Dean Christian Gauss was largely re
, sponsible for the auto ban, which will
go into effect July 1. He is the object
| of much mock publicity issued by the
I Daily Princetonian, and other univer-
I f?ity publications.
Statement by Dean
In announcing the new regulation,
Christian Gauss said: "In a small,
closely-built, democratic community
like Princeton, where there are no
1 long distances, cars are an unneces
sary adjunct to college life. An un-
I necessary car is an unnecessary ex
i pense.
"Our statistics show that the record
of automobile owners for scholarship,
| for attendance, and for conduct is be
low the general average of the college.
Serious and tragic accidents have been
too frequent to warrant a continuance
of the risks involved in the mainten
ance of a doubtful convenience, and a
probable academic handicap."
