Stanford is truly democratic,;
then it is the first university of its
kirul that I have ever known of in the i
United States," declared Dr. Charles I
r. Clark, Fellow of the Royal Histori- j
cal Society, in an interview. "The ideal
of real democracy is never full prac
ticed by college students today.
"The greatest fault of American uni
versities is that it is possible to get
along without doing any work. Facul
ties are afraid to raise scholastic re
quirements because of alumni and un
dergraduate opposition to the change,"
pointed out Dr. Clark, who is principal
of a preparatory school for men tak
ing the entrance examinations for
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and other
Eastern institutions. He lectured in
the Little Theater last Tuesday eve
ning on"The Charm of Spain."
"Reading, writing, and debating are j
the most valuable fundamentals for!
undergraduates, 0-ne of the most valu- ,
able activities that I engaged in at '
Yale was debating. Chemistry, pliys- '
ics, geology, and biology should be
taken by every student and are just 1
as essential as a thorough classical
education."
Classical Education
Speaking of the desirability of clas- â€¢
sical education,.he remarked that, he!
was glad to see Stanford encouraging j
the courses here. The Middle West!
has recently had a renaissance in clas- !
sical education; the East is ahead of '
the West, and Europe leads America j
in this type of education.
"Timidity and a lack of aggressive
ness in opposing political and finan
cial agencies of oppression is the chief
curse of the American people. The !
public is easily fooled, and advertising !
propaganda is an example of this state-'
ment. I always recommend to any ;
foreigner that a true understanding
of the American people can be found ]
in R. Frank Norris's epic, 'The Octo- j
pus.'
