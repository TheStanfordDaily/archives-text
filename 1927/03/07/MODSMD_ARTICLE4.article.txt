# IRISH MARATHON OFFERS THRILLS, LAUGHS; CLOSE FINISH AS '29 IS VICTOR
## Spencer Runs Spectacular Race for Seniors in Last Lap; Hold-Over Show Depicts Freshman Tragedy 
### Jack L. Springer 
Emerson Spencer's spectacular race ;
for the seniors in the last lap of the
Irish Marathon, held in the old track
oval Saturday afternoon, failed by :
about three feet to wrest the laurels
of the day from Thomas Moss, running i
last for the sophomores.
When Babcock passed the baton to
Spencer at the end of the twenty-third :
round, Moss was well at the beginning
of the curve. By a spurt which brought
the crowd to its feet in applause, Spen- J
cer closed the gap at the half-way i
post and began pressing Moss on the
north curve. All around the long curve j
and onto the straight track the run- I
ners fought it out almost side by side.
Moss, hanging onto his slight lead, i
kept Spencer a pace or two behind,
and finally crossed the line to win for
the Class of 1929. Juniors finished
third with the freshmen in the rear.
Spencer made the excellent time of
48.1, while Moss took the lap at 51.1.
Hold-Over Show
At the very beginning of the after- i
noon the Hold-Over's Show was held: |

|"A Kick For a Cinder-Fella"—a drama
|in "numerous devastating epochs."
This performance, which was an epic
poem gone wrong, depicted the "tra-
I gedy of disillusionment" gently over
powering a Stanford freshman."
The freshman in the cas° was A1
Cass, the bard was Delmer Daves, and
the rest of the company was recruited
from the members of Quadrangle Club.
The show itself beggars description,
but whatever was lacking by way of
stage effect or brilliance of acting was
i made up by the constant flow of wit
out of Daves"s immense megaphone.
The Chicken Chase
Third upon the program was the
' chicken chase. Yoakum, Leistner, and
; Nichols proved to be the most adept
at catching the hapless fowls. Each
received the fowl he caught as a re
ward.
No horse could have hoped to over
come the obstacles which were erected
for the benefit of the steeplechasers.
' The runners were taken over masses
of hurdles, across suspended board
