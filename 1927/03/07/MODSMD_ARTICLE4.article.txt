# IRISH MARATHON OFFERS THRILLS, LAUGHS; CLOSE FINISH AS '29 IS VICTOR
## Spencer Runs Spectacular Race for Seniors in Last Lap; Hold-Over Show Depicts Freshman Tragedy 
### Jack L. Springer 
Emerson Spencer's spectacular race ;
for the seniors in the last lap of the
Irish Marathon, held in the old track
oval Saturday afternoon, failed by :
about three feet to wrest the laurels
of the day from Thomas Moss, running i
last for the sophomores.
When Babcock passed the baton to
Spencer at the end of the twenty-third :
round, Moss was well at the beginning
of the curve. By a spurt which brought
the crowd to its feet in applause, Spen- J
cer closed the gap at the half-way i
post and began pressing Moss on the
north curve. All around the long curve j
and onto the straight track the run- I
ners fought it out almost side by side.
Moss, hanging onto his slight lead, i
kept Spencer a pace or two behind,
and finally crossed the line to win for
the Class of 1929. Juniors finished
third with the freshmen in the rear.
Spencer made the excellent time of
48.1, while Moss took the lap at 51.1.
Hold-Over Show
At the very beginning of the after- i
noon the Hold-Over's Show was held: |

|"A Kick For a Cinder-Fella"—a drama
|in "numerous devastating epochs."
This performance, which was an epic
poem gone wrong, depicted the "tra-
I gedy of disillusionment" gently over
powering a Stanford freshman."
The freshman in the cas° was A1
Cass, the bard was Delmer Daves, and
the rest of the company was recruited
from the members of Quadrangle Club.
The show itself beggars description,
but whatever was lacking by way of
stage effect or brilliance of acting was
i made up by the constant flow of wit
out of Daves"s immense megaphone.
The Chicken Chase
Third upon the program was the
' chicken chase. Yoakum, Leistner, and
; Nichols proved to be the most adept
at catching the hapless fowls. Each
received the fowl he caught as a re
ward.
No horse could have hoped to over
come the obstacles which were erected
for the benefit of the steeplechasers.
' The runners were taken over masses
of hurdles, across suspended board
paths, and finally through a mud po'ol.
which, by way of deception, was much
deeper at one end than at the other.
Macabee came in first in this event,
with Cook second, and Leistner mak
ing a vague third. Hulsman missed
his step and was submerged in cross
ing the water hazard.
Three-Legged Race
West and Nichols, running in per
fect form, took first place in the three
legged race at 13 flat. Two sophomore
track managers, Tognazzini and King,
made a late second.
The quarter-mile walk was won by
Ted Shipkey, last year's champion in
this event. Yoland "from Hungary and
way points" was second. Most of the
contestants were eliminated for not
conforming to walking requirements.
The hundred-yard backward dash,
featured by many spills, was won by
Clarence West in 14.1. Ricliman placed
second.
Greased Pig
A highly greased pig furnished the
entertainment for the last act. The
porker was scarcely under full speed
before he went down under a flying
tackle made by Ted Shipkey. As Ship
key held on, grease and all, the "hunt"
came to rather an early end.
The program was staged under the
auspices of Quadrangle Club.
The best times made in the Mara
thon follow: For the seniors, Spencer,
58.1-5; Ricliman, 51.2; West, 51; Bab

mores, McKinnon, 51.1; Moss, 51.1;
