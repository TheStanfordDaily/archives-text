# The
						Giants' Headers
## 
### 
Twenty-five years is a long time, no 1
matter how you look at it, and here
in good old John McGraw entering I
into his silver-jubilee year as manager I
of the New York Giants. "The first. |
quarter of a century is the hardest," j
one might imagine "Mac" saying, as !
he glanced with pride over his record |
since July, 1902, when he took over
the reins of the New York National
League ball club. His friends will
tell you how he has won ten pennants
with the Giants in that stretch of time,
but his enemies will retort, "Yes, and
he's lost seven world series."
But John McGraw is certainly one
of the greatest baseball managers of
all time, and as a player, in the old
days with the Baltimore Orioles, did
much to introduce the tactics and
strategy that have been fixtures in the
game of baseball ever since. McGraw
was one of the pioneers of the game, I
and now we find his 120' pounds and j
his salary of $00 a month* - increased '
to nearly 200 pounds and over $65,000 I
a year. The old fighting spirit is still i
there, but the nickname "Muggsy" has '
disappeared, giving way to a respect-1
ful "Mac" or "Mr. McGraw."

What are the Giants' chances of i
winning another pennant to celebrate i
their leader's twenty-fifth anniversary? J
Look at the line-up pictured above!
and see if they are not very good? :
A new box-office attraction is Rogers j
Hornsby, whu. should seriously threat
en Ruth's claim to the title of the j
"Idol of New York." Three fine new j
outfielders have been added in Roush, i
Harper, and Leßourveau. Burleigh j

1 Grimes should bring new kick to the
pitching staff, and with the hard
i hitting Bill Terry playing regularly
! at first, the Giants seem almost sure
\ of the 1927 National League pennant.
