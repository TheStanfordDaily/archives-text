Heisinger bill now before the the leg
islators, Professor S. J. Holmes, of the
zoology department at Berkeley, says:
"Absurd and futile as the bill is, it
js vicious in principle, and would only
bring us discredit in the estimation of
nil liberal minded people. The world
has poked fun enough at poor Ten

the Scopes trial. Surely California wfll
not want the same kind of a reputa
tion. The bill is backed by an organ
ized group of reactionaries who are
taking advantage of a temporary fan
atical craze which is sweeping over
the country."
