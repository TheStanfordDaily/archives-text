UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, Feb.
28. â€”"In about a thousand years Amer
ica will produce a new type of man,
a brunette with light brown eyes, a
ruddy face, and a well proportioned
head," states Dr. R. Bennett Bean,
professor of anatomy. "A gradual
change toward the American Indian
Iype will result. Ranginess, but not
lankiness, and athletic stature will be
characteristic of the American of the
future. Intense summers and the bril
liancy of the sun, which produces a
pigmentation of the skin and causes
hair and eyes to become blacker, will
be the causes of this change in type.
