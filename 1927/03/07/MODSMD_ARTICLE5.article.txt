### Ed Randol 
Santa Clara took the third game of
their annual series with the Stanford
varsity baseball team last Saturday
by a score of 4 to 2. The game went
eleven innings, both teams fighting an
even battle until Steve Collins weak
ened and allowed two runs to be
made. The Cardinals won the first two
games.
Stanford started off with a rush in
the first inning, Wilton scoring on a
single by Busch.
Score Tied
Santa Clara tied the score in the
third. No further scores were made
until the first of the seventh, when
the Broncs went into the lead for the
first time during the day. This time a
single was coupled with a sacrifice
hit and a passed ball to do the dam
age, although only one run was
scored.
The Santa Clara lead was short
lived, however, for the Cardinals came
back in their half of the inning and
again tied the score. Marks, batting
for Philippi, started with a nice single.
Wilton sacrificed him to second, and
then Stewart sent Marks home with
another hit. This second tally ended
the Stanford scores for the day.
Starting the eleventh inning, Miller,
first up for the Broncs, struck out.
Scherf hit to Busch, Stanford short
stop. but the throw to first base drew
Maguire off the bag, and Scherf was
safe. Owen drew another easy infield
hit, advancing Scherf to second.
Sypher then let a ball get away from
him, and the Bronc runners advanced
a base.
When Butler, pinch-hitting for
Power, popped up to Garibaldi, it
looked as though the Santa Clara rally
was over, but Collins threw to Falk
while off balance, and he connected
for a single to left, and when the ball
was fumbled, two men crossed the
plate with the winning runs.
Stanford made a desperate attempt
to rally in the last half of the inning,
but after Frank Wilton had made a
long two-base hit, Stewart flew out to
j field play, ending the game.
