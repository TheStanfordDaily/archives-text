# DANCES IN "ARIES" CHARACTERIZED BY VARIETY OF MODES
## DRAMA SET FOR TONIGHT Anne Mudge Will Interpret "Felix the Cat" in First Dance Group 
### 
Variety will be the particular attraction
j in the groups of dance-- and the dance
[drama, "Aries, the Sign of l ; ire," which
| will be presented at 7:30 o'clock tonight
j in the Assembly Hall.
"Aries" represents the struggle of man
i with the elements, with fear, and supcr
! stition, eventually conquering by Fire
with the aid of Intelligence. The first
dance shows the mind of Man devclop
j ing from a primitive state and is cos-
I turned in brown to represent the skin of
| animals. The next dance shows a strug
j gle in which the victor is aided by the
j weapons given him by Intelligence. Man's
| conquest and superiority over animals is
j shown by a dance of victory. Figures of
j superstition clothed in grotesque cos
jtumes and make-up, appear, driving prim
j oval man off the stage by playing upon
j his fears.
j The forces of the glacier sweep down
! upon primitive man and drive him con-
I stantly back. A solo dance by BarbUra
| Ann Euhanks representing lightning fol
■ lows. Lightning strikes up flames which
| develop into the swirling movement of
'the fire dance, the chief dance of the
I drama.

Intelligence instructs Man to make use
of the tire. H; snatches up two brands
[and with them forces out the Supersti
i tions and Cold. It ends with a dance, of
j bacchanalian triumph around the lire.
! This is one of the most effective of the
! group dances, including the entire cast.
In the two shorter groups of dances
; which will precede "Aries," there is a
: wide range of emotional appeal from the
! frankly humorous ttfthe profoundly tra
| gic. .\nne Mudge gives an excellent per
j formance as Felix in the comic dance of
| "Felix the Cat," and has developed an
excellent sense of comedy values. Among
j the dramatic dances, Clarita Hunsberger
[gives an excellent interpretation of the
moment of freedom given to Arachne,
the spinner, who has been changed into
| a spider for daring to defy the gods.
"The Dance of the Three Dolls," fea
j turing Barbara Ann Eubanks as the
French Doll, is a delicate bit of whimsy
j utterly different from any other part of
j the program.

j the program.
Variety will be the particular attraction
j in the groups of dance-- and the dance
[drama, "Aries, the Sign of l ; ire," which
| will be presented at 7:30 o'clock tonight
j in the Assembly Hall.
"Aries" represents the struggle of man
i with the elements, with fear, and supcr
! stition, eventually conquering by Fire
with the aid of Intelligence. The first
dance shows the mind of Man devclop
j ing from a primitive state and is cos-
I turned in brown to represent the skin of
| animals. The next dance shows a strug
j gle in which the victor is aided by the
j weapons given him by Intelligence. Man's
| conquest and superiority over animals is
j shown by a dance of victory. Figures of
j superstition clothed in grotesque cos
jtumes and make-up, appear, driving prim
j oval man off the stage by playing upon
j his fears.
j The forces of the glacier sweep down
! upon primitive man and drive him con-
I stantly back. A solo dance by BarbUra
| Ann Euhanks representing lightning fol
■ lows. Lightning strikes up flames which
| develop into the swirling movement of
'the fire dance, the chief dance of the
I drama.

Intelligence instructs Man to make use
of the tire. H; snatches up two brands
[and with them forces out the Supersti
i tions and Cold. It ends with a dance, of
j bacchanalian triumph around the lire.
! This is one of the most effective of the
! group dances, including the entire cast.
In the two shorter groups of dances
; which will precede "Aries," there is a
: wide range of emotional appeal from the
! frankly humorous ttfthe profoundly tra
| gic. .\nne Mudge gives an excellent per
j formance as Felix in the comic dance of
| "Felix the Cat," and has developed an
excellent sense of comedy values. Among
j the dramatic dances, Clarita Hunsberger
[gives an excellent interpretation of the
moment of freedom given to Arachne,
the spinner, who has been changed into
| a spider for daring to defy the gods.
"The Dance of the Three Dolls," fea
j turing Barbara Ann Eubanks as the
French Doll, is a delicate bit of whimsy
j utterly different from any other part of
j the program.
