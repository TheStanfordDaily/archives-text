# VAGRANT GOURMAND OBSERVES ROBLE EPICURES ALL EAT WITH CREDITABLE EASE, GRACE ENJOY FREQUENT SALADS; DEMAND DAINTINESS
## HUNGRY REPORTER 
### "The Hungry Reporter 
It was with a strong curiosity to
J observe the largest group of "the
! 500" in their native haunts that the
reporter, blushing appropriately to see
' so many of the creatures all at once,
invaded Roble Hall armed with noth
ing more deadly than an appetite,
j But the women are really quite
[ tame.
; Some two hundred and thirty of
them troop into two dining rooms.
I smaller than those at Eneina, and eat
| with a very creditable degree of civi
i lized polish.
Self-Government Effective
All the halls at Stanford havo stu
dent government. At both Roble and
' Sequoia the machinery seems to work
to general satisfaction. Student, gov
i eminent, at all is rare among the uni
|versities of the country, particularly
those privately endowed. Beypnd de
| bate, Stanford is both advanced and
i fortunate in this respect.

Board at Roble costs a dollar a clay.
For that amount the women seem to
get 011 the average as good meals as
sororities, which pay more, and the
difference to a casual observer be
tween Roble and Encina, so far as
service is concerned, has some re
semblance at least to the difference
between a "one-arm lunch" and a
country club.
Eat at Attractive Tables
The women eat at round tables, at
tractively decorated, and there is a
student waiter for every twelve diners.
What is the answer? For one thing,
according to directors, the women do
eat less. They like frequent salads
and some measure of daintiness in
portions. While by no moans dieting,
they thrive on just enough smaller
quantity of food that very striking im
provements can be made in surround
ings and service. Like all other Uni
versity-administered eating places,
Roble is run on a cost basis.
For a dollar a month additional to
the present thirty it would be possible
to provide for Encina the same sort
of service Roble has, Mrs. Etta B.
Handy estimates, pointing out that the
determination of both the quality of
food and the service rests with the
students in the halls.
Regular Breakfast Supplemented
Roble serves a regular breakfast in
addition has two kitchenettes and buf
fets patronized equally or more than
the served breakfast.
Efforts are made to give the Roble
menu as much of the personal and
homelike touch as possible. Women
are employed in the wonderfully clean
and modern kitchen. Once a month a
special dinner celebrates birthdays.
The women may entertain.
Coffee Served Sparingly
By decision of the representative
committee, coffee is served only about
four times a week. Many of the women
are in athletic training.
Candy to the amount of an average
for each woman of about fifty cents a
month is sold at Roble Store. Ciga
rettes? Yes, but only four or five packs
a day.

Regular Breakfast Supplemented
Roble serves a regular breakfast in
addition has two kitchenettes and buf
fets patronized equally or more than
the served breakfast.
Efforts are made to give the Roble
menu as much of the personal and
homelike touch as possible. Women
are employed in the wonderfully clean
and modern kitchen. Once a month a
special dinner celebrates birthdays.
The women may entertain.
Coffee Served Sparingly
By decision of the representative
committee, coffee is served only about
four times a week. Many of the women
are in athletic training.
Candy to the amount of an average
for each woman of about fifty cents a
month is sold at Roble Store. Ciga

a day.

get 011 the average as good meals as

difference to a casual observer be

Eat at Attractive Tables
The women eat at round tables, at
tractively decorated, and there is a
student waiter for every twelve diners.
What is the answer? For one thing,
according to directors, the women do
eat less. They like frequent salads
and some measure of daintiness in
portions. While by no moans dieting,
they thrive on just enough smaller
quantity of food that very striking im
provements can be made in surround
ings and service. Like all other Uni
versity-administered eating places,
Roble is run on a cost basis.

the present thirty it would be possible
