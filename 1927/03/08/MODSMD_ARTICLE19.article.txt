# COACH WARNER ENDORSES NEW GRIDIRON RULES
## Lateral Pass Rule Expected To Give Opportunities For Brilliant Play HOPE FOR STABILIZATION Regards One-Second Stop as Factor in Eliminating Need of Guesswork 
### Milton Silverman 
Feeling that the sixteen new rules
passed by the Football Rules Commit
tee at their annual meeting last week*
are all constructive in nature and will
be for the best interests of the game,
Coach "Pop" Warner expressed him
self as being in full accord with the
changes.
One of the outstanding rulings is
that regarding the shift. "There is no
doubt that the rules governing the
shift needed to be made," says War
ner, "so that officials will hot be
forced to use guesswork in their deci
sions. The one-second stop should
remedy that. The fifteen-yard penalty
for failure to come to a complete stop
should also curb the tendency of
teams to take a chance of being
penalized in order to get momentum
in their plays."
Goal Posts Moved
Moving the goal posts to the end
zone line gets them out of the way
of scrimmage play, he points out, and
thus makes scoring by field goals more
difficult. This new rule has been under
discussion for several years, but in
stead of lowering the point value of
the field goal, the committee has made
it harder for the goal to be kicked.
"By making- the lateral or backward
pass less dangerous in case of an in
completion or fumble, a game that will
be much more spectacular will result.
Many new plays will be formulated
to fit this change; it will help all
running plays."
Warner shows that he is entirely in
1 favor of any law that will prevent a
team winning by some lucky break.
He says, "Not allowing a run after
recovering a fumbled punt will pre
vent these 'flukes,' and will overcome
the great importance of the safety-man
in catching punts. I believe the com
mittee would have done well to go a
step farther along the same line and
j apply (he same rule to blocked kicks.
' Any rule that prevents 'flukes' and
makes it more certain that the best
team will win is undoubtedly a good
one.
"I believe the Rules Committee has
! done a very good job and has cleared
| up the features which were causing
| most of the criticism; and let us hope
that there will be little need of tam
\ pering with the rules in future years.
The game needs to be stabilized and
!
: settled just as baseball has been for
! many years."
