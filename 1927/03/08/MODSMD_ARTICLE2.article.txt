# MODERN COMPOSERS SELECTED BY ALLEN FOR ORGAN PROGRAM
## 
### 
Four modern composers will be
represented on the organ recital pro
gram which is to he given by Warren
D. Allen, University organist, at 4:15
o'clock this afternoon in the Memorial
Church.
The program will commence with
the Prelude Chorale from the "Suite
Ancienne" by F. W. Holloway. The
style of the work is interesting in that
the classic motif is consistently fol
lowed throughout.
Leon Boellmann's "Ronde Francaise
in A Minor" is the second selection.
In it the composer achieves great
variety without having to resort to the
use of accidental notes at any point.
Two pieces which have proved their
popularity at previous recitals will
conclude the program. These are the
Prelude on the Welsh Hymn-Tune
"Lovely" and "Heroic Piece," a work
of the American organist Rossetter G.
Cole.
