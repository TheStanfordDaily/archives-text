Tn today's Campus Opinion column a freshman takes occasion to
register a violent complaint. Attention is called to his diatribe, not because
it possesses any particular merit, but rather because it represents a type
of letter which in the past has caused a great deal of misunderstanding
nnd ill feeling.
The author of this letter takes occasion to claim that one of the
competing candidates for assistant yell leader was, figuratively, stabbed
in the back by the rally committee. That is a matter of opinion. And a
man who expresses an opinion on a matter of this kind, unless that opin
ion is supported by accurate and convincing information, is guilty of a
grave indiscretion. That this freshman's information is not particularly
authoritative would seem to follow from his own admission that it is
hearsay. Not content with publishing an odious and unpleasant charge,
this writer lias also based a rather nasty insinuation on as perfect a piece
of sophistry as the Daily has been forced to print in some time.
He writes in part: "I say unfair [the cut] because out of SEVEN
row men, FIVE were retained, and if the basis is, according to part II
of the by-laws, MERIT ONLY, all of these row men should not have
been on, especially TWO from the SAME house."
This argument is constructed on the famous boomerang principle. It
comes right back and wallops its promulgator in the midriff. The fresh
man begins by stating that the successful candidates, with but one ex
ception, were all fraternity men. Then he goes on to say that they are
supposed to be chosen on a basis of merit. He winds up with the state
ment that, if they were chosen on a basis of merit, all of these men would
not have been successful. The fallacy is obvious. The furious freshman,
not the rally committee, is calling attention to the political qualifications
of the candidates rather than to their individual merit.
It is to be hoped, sincerely, that this letter takes no effect. As a matter
of fact, the Hall and Row matter received little, if any, consideration in
the rally committee's discussion of candidates. Before the election, the
chairman noticed that all the committee members were not present. He
offered the candidates an opportunity to say whether or not the election
should be deferred until such time as the committee could be represented
in full. Ihe candidates themselves (some of whom must have had per
sonal friends among the missing members) decided unanimously to go
on with the election. Certainly such a gesture connotes an attitude of
unusual fairness on the part of the committee. It precludes any possi
bility of truth in the charges made in this letter.
