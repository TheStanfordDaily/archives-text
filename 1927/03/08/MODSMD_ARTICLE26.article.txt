The Editor, Sir;
One of the staff members recently
wrote a treatise called "Another Angle
on Academic Reform." First he traced
the history of education at Stanford
from its opening date until the pres
ent. He told how education was family
style, and examinations were given
to see if the professors were earning
their pay. He states that regiments of
high-school valedictorians threaten to
reduce Stanford to the mental level of
a state university. He says that per
haps the majority of the instructors
are sick unto death of the listless
sponges who squat in the classroom —
then he made the "whipped-dog" re
mark that no one teacher or institu
tion can back tie system.
Let's cut out this sugar-coated bally
hooing. Haven't we had about enough
of this highly seasoned bologna? We
need less dogma and less propaganda.
It is time we faced a few facts.
It will no doubt be a good many
years before any great change can be
brought about in the college educa
tional system of America ae a whole,
because the sluggish, perverted minds
of the multitude are being hokus
pokused by a few bigoted individuals
who have this American idea of quan
tity production rooted deeply in their
shallow minds. They seem to have a
strangle-hold on the Presidents and
administrators of colleges. It would
take an army of French revolutionists
to overthrow the entire system of edu
cation. The following suggestions are
meant only for Stanford, an institution
j supposedly founded on democracy, in
dividualism, and freedom from outside
political influence. Stanford is yet in
her infancy and a change is overdue.
First, let President Wilbur dismiss
his dream about extending the quad
rangles to the highway, and erecting
new buildings sufficient to take in a
j greater number. Then let the Presi
dent. the faculty, and the administra
tors get together and decide for what
purpose Stanford is being run.
Stanford should be run for the stu
dents. Its purpose should be to en
courage students to do their own
thinking. Let Stanford cater to those
who eagerly desire knowledge, and
not to that great majority who are
sent to college by solicitous parents
that they may gain that social cachet,
which is a result of four years' loiter
ing at a college. Clear away this group
who are interested only in imbibing
and not in contributing to learning.
Exclusion of this disinterested class
should be accompanied by a reform in
i the methods of instruction.
If we are to maintain the present
system of compulsory attend an ce»-.-of
lectures, then let the professor fulfill
some useful purpose. He must change
his attitude toward the student. He
should not regard the student as a
mere receptacle. The professor should
not stand on the platform and dole
out facts as charity kitchens dish out
soup. Education cannot be poured
into people's ears, but "like the fer
mentation of liquors is an internal
fruition."
In early days, when textbooks were
few and priceless, it was the teacher's
chief purpose to predigest the con
tents of books and give the informa
tion via local expression to the inter
ested students who gathered about
him. Today when texts are plentiful
and cheap, if the lecturer has any pur
pose at all it surely isn't to feed
spoon-like doses of predigested mental
peptones to his half-sleepy, unatten
tive audience. Granting that these lec
tures of facts are necessary, then do
away with this stupid exam system
where the student is not encouraged
to give personal judgment, but is re
quested and forced to give back kernel
for kernel those grains of far-fetched
wisdom imparted by Professor So-and-
So (names by request). Socrates lead
the approach to learning not by laws
or facts laid down but. by mearts of
answers required by his pupils. Let
the professor not only encourage pro
ductive thought but "require" it. The
jhange must be broughj, fibout by the'
leaders or professors; for it is the
truth that Huxley speaks when he
says, "Springs cannot rise higher than
their sources."
If we are compelled to listen to
these ready-made lectures, the stu
dents, too, must change their attitude.
They should enter the classroom in a
skeptical and, if need be, rebellious
state of mind. They should accept ihe
facts given by the professor but weigh
the value of his statements and ques
tion each and every remark. Perhaps
then the student will have a mind of
his own and will think independently
—not have a few memorized, borrowed
ideas.
True, Mr. Bull Session, the Univer
sity requires only a "C" grade. It is

(he duty of the University, however,
to require more than a grade. Let
Stanford do away with the useless
bawlout, which places a false ol
learning on many. Let the professors
and administrators stop twaddling
about high scholastic standing, honor
points, and grades. Let them encour
age the students to independent, pro
ductive thinking at the earliest stage
possible, that he may take his place
in the world of ideas after graduation,
not as a street car conductor alias col
lege graduate, but as a producer and
an intelligent man. Let us hope that
Stanford makes a change, for —•
"The slaves of custom and established
mode,
With pack-horse constancy we keep
the road.
Crooked or straight, through quags or
throny dells,
True to the jingling of our leader's
bells."
Yours Sincerely,
Ernie Guffin.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been following with great in
terest the Yell Leading tryouts, and
was greatly surprised, as were many
others with whom I have talked, to
find that the Rally Committee in mak
ing yesterday's cut, cut out number
ELEVEN (11).
Now I do not know the name of
number 11, neither do I care; however,
I do feel that he should at least have
been permitted to go up before the
student body at the spring election.
I have heard that there existed
much rancor between the Row and the
Hall, but did not place much faith in
this assertion until this unfair cut was
made. I say unfair, because out of
SEVEN row men, FIVE were retained,
and if the basis is, according to Part
II of the by-laws, MERIT ONLY, all of
these row men should NOT have been
on, especially TWO from the SAME
house.
But there is still time to rectify this
grievous ERROR, for according to the
by-laws, THE EXECUTIVE COMMIT
TEE CAN CHECK UP ON THIS CUT.
Let's hear from some other students
who are in favor of giving number 11
a square deal. It's to the interest of
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, not any
cliques or politicians.
Yours for a square deal, '30.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been following with great in
terest the Yell Leading tryouts, and
was greatly surprised, as were many
others with whom I have talked, to
find that the Rally Committee in mak
ing yesterday's cut, cut out number
ELEVEN (11).
Now I do not know the name of
number 11, neither do I care; however,
I do feel that he should at least have
been permitted to go up before the
student body at the spring election.
I have heard that there existed
much rancor between the Row and the
Hall, but did not place much faith in
this assertion until this unfair cut was
made. I say unfair, because out of
SEVEN row men, FIVE were retained,
and if the basis is, according to Part
II of the by-laws, MERIT ONLY, all of
these row men should NOT have been
on, especially TWO from the SAME
house.
But there is still time to rectify this
grievous ERROR, for according to the
by-laws, THE EXECUTIVE COMMIT
TEE CAN CHECK UP ON THIS CUT.
Let's hear from some other students
who are in favor of giving number 11
a square deal. It's to the interest of
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, not any
cliques or politicians.
Yours for a square deal, '30.
The Editor, Sir;
One of the staff members recently
wrote a treatise called "Another Angle
on Academic Reform." First he traced
the history of education at Stanford
from its opening date until the pres
ent. He told how education was family
style, and examinations were given
to see if the professors were earning
their pay. He states that regiments of
high-school valedictorians threaten to
reduce Stanford to the mental level of
a state university. He says that per
haps the majority of the instructors
are sick unto death of the listless
sponges who squat in the classroom —
then he made the "whipped-dog" re
mark that no one teacher or institu
tion can back tie system.
Let's cut out this sugar-coated bally
hooing. Haven't we had about enough
of this highly seasoned bologna? We
need less dogma and less propaganda.
It is time we faced a few facts.
It will no doubt be a good many
years before any great change can be
brought about in the college educa
tional system of America ae a whole,
because the sluggish, perverted minds
of the multitude are being hokus
pokused by a few bigoted individuals
who have this American idea of quan
tity production rooted deeply in their
shallow minds. They seem to have a
strangle-hold on the Presidents and
administrators of colleges. It would
take an army of French revolutionists
to overthrow the entire system of edu
cation. The following suggestions are
meant only for Stanford, an institution
j supposedly founded on democracy, in
dividualism, and freedom from outside
political influence. Stanford is yet in
her infancy and a change is overdue.
First, let President Wilbur dismiss
his dream about extending the quad
rangles to the highway, and erecting
new buildings sufficient to take in a
j greater number. Then let the Presi
dent. the faculty, and the administra
tors get together and decide for what
purpose Stanford is being run.
Stanford should be run for the stu
dents. Its purpose should be to en
courage students to do their own
thinking. Let Stanford cater to those
who eagerly desire knowledge, and
not to that great majority who are
sent to college by solicitous parents
that they may gain that social cachet,
which is a result of four years' loiter
ing at a college. Clear away this group
who are interested only in imbibing
and not in contributing to learning.
Exclusion of this disinterested class
should be accompanied by a reform in
i the methods of instruction.
If we are to maintain the present
system of compulsory attend an ce»-.-of
lectures, then let the professor fulfill
some useful purpose. He must change
his attitude toward the student. He
should not regard the student as a
mere receptacle. The professor should
not stand on the platform and dole
out facts as charity kitchens dish out
soup. Education cannot be poured
into people's ears, but "like the fer
mentation of liquors is an internal
fruition."
In early days, when textbooks were
few and priceless, it was the teacher's
chief purpose to predigest the con
tents of books and give the informa
tion via local expression to the inter
ested students who gathered about
him. Today when texts are plentiful
and cheap, if the lecturer has any pur
pose at all it surely isn't to feed
spoon-like doses of predigested mental
peptones to his half-sleepy, unatten
tive audience. Granting that these lec
tures of facts are necessary, then do
away with this stupid exam system
where the student is not encouraged
to give personal judgment, but is re
quested and forced to give back kernel
for kernel those grains of far-fetched
wisdom imparted by Professor So-and-
So (names by request). Socrates lead
the approach to learning not by laws
or facts laid down but. by mearts of
answers required by his pupils. Let
the professor not only encourage pro
ductive thought but "require" it. The
jhange must be broughj, fibout by the'
leaders or professors; for it is the
truth that Huxley speaks when he
says, "Springs cannot rise higher than
their sources."
If we are compelled to listen to
these ready-made lectures, the stu
dents, too, must change their attitude.
They should enter the classroom in a
skeptical and, if need be, rebellious
state of mind. They should accept ihe
facts given by the professor but weigh
the value of his statements and ques
tion each and every remark. Perhaps
then the student will have a mind of
his own and will think independently
—not have a few memorized, borrowed
ideas.
True, Mr. Bull Session, the Univer
sity requires only a "C" grade. It is

(he duty of the University, however,
to require more than a grade. Let
Stanford do away with the useless
bawlout, which places a false ol
learning on many. Let the professors
and administrators stop twaddling
about high scholastic standing, honor
points, and grades. Let them encour
age the students to independent, pro

out facts as charity kitchens dish out
soup. Education cannot be poured
into people's ears, but "like the fer
mentation of liquors is an internal
fruition."
In early days, when textbooks were
few and priceless, it was the teacher's
chief purpose to predigest the con
tents of books and give the informa
tion via local expression to the inter
ested students who gathered about
him. Today when texts are plentiful
and cheap, if the lecturer has any pur
pose at all it surely isn't to feed
spoon-like doses of predigested mental
peptones to his half-sleepy, unatten
tive audience. Granting that these lec
tures of facts are necessary, then do
away with this stupid exam system
where the student is not encouraged
to give personal judgment, but is re
quested and forced to give back kernel
for kernel those grains of far-fetched
wisdom imparted by Professor So-and-
So (names by request). Socrates lead
the approach to learning not by laws
or facts laid down but. by mearts of
answers required by his pupils. Let
the professor not only encourage pro
ductive thought but "require" it. The
jhange must be broughj, fibout by the'
leaders or professors; for it is the
truth that Huxley speaks when he
says, "Springs cannot rise higher than
their sources."
If we are compelled to listen to
these ready-made lectures, the stu
dents, too, must change their attitude.
They should enter the classroom in a
skeptical and, if need be, rebellious
state of mind. They should accept ihe
facts given by the professor but weigh
the value of his statements and ques
tion each and every remark. Perhaps
then the student will have a mind of
his own and will think independently
—not have a few memorized, borrowed
ideas.
True, Mr. Bull Session, the Univer
sity requires only a "C" grade. It is

(he duty of the University, however,
to require more than a grade. Let
Stanford do away with the useless
bawlout, which places a false ol
learning on many. Let the professors
and administrators stop twaddling
about high scholastic standing, honor
points, and grades. Let them encour
age the students to independent, pro
ductive thinking at the earliest stage
possible, that he may take his place
in the world of ideas after graduation,
not as a street car conductor alias col
lege graduate, but as a producer and
an intelligent man. Let us hope that
Stanford makes a change, for —•
"The slaves of custom and established
mode,
With pack-horse constancy we keep
the road.
Crooked or straight, through quags or
throny dells,
True to the jingling of our leader's
bells."

The Editor, Sir:
I have been following with great in
terest the Yell Leading tryouts, and
was greatly surprised, as were many
others with whom I have talked, to
find that the Rally Committee in mak
ing yesterday's cut, cut out number
ELEVEN (11).
Now I do not know the name of
number 11, neither do I care; however,
I do feel that he should at least have
been permitted to go up before the
student body at the spring election.
I have heard that there existed
much rancor between the Row and the
Hall, but did not place much faith in
this assertion until this unfair cut was
made. I say unfair, because out of
SEVEN row men, FIVE were retained,
and if the basis is, according to Part
II of the by-laws, MERIT ONLY, all of
these row men should NOT have been
on, especially TWO from the SAME
house.
But there is still time to rectify this
grievous ERROR, for according to the
by-laws, THE EXECUTIVE COMMIT
TEE CAN CHECK UP ON THIS CUT.
Let's hear from some other students
who are in favor of giving number 11
a square deal. It's to the interest of
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, not any
cliques or politicians.
Yours for a square deal, '30.
The Editor, Sir;
One of the staff members recently
wrote a treatise called "Another Angle
on Academic Reform." First he traced
the history of education at Stanford
from its opening date until the pres
ent. He told how education was family
style, and examinations were given
to see if the professors were earning
their pay. He states that regiments of
high-school valedictorians threaten to
reduce Stanford to the mental level of
a state university. He says that per
haps the majority of the instructors
are sick unto death of the listless
sponges who squat in the classroom —
then he made the "whipped-dog" re
mark that no one teacher or institu
tion can back tie system.
Let's cut out this sugar-coated bally
hooing. Haven't we had about enough
of this highly seasoned bologna? We
need less dogma and less propaganda.
It is time we faced a few facts.
It will no doubt be a good many
years before any great change can be
brought about in the college educa
tional system of America ae a whole,
because the sluggish, perverted minds
of the multitude are being hokus
pokused by a few bigoted individuals
who have this American idea of quan
tity production rooted deeply in their
shallow minds. They seem to have a
strangle-hold on the Presidents and
administrators of colleges. It would
take an army of French revolutionists
to overthrow the entire system of edu
cation. The following suggestions are
meant only for Stanford, an institution
j supposedly founded on democracy, in
dividualism, and freedom from outside
political influence. Stanford is yet in
her infancy and a change is overdue.
First, let President Wilbur dismiss
his dream about extending the quad
rangles to the highway, and erecting
new buildings sufficient to take in a
j greater number. Then let the Presi
dent. the faculty, and the administra
tors get together and decide for what
purpose Stanford is being run.
Stanford should be run for the stu
dents. Its purpose should be to en
courage students to do their own
thinking. Let Stanford cater to those
who eagerly desire knowledge, and
not to that great majority who are
sent to college by solicitous parents
that they may gain that social cachet,
which is a result of four years' loiter
ing at a college. Clear away this group
who are interested only in imbibing
and not in contributing to learning.
Exclusion of this disinterested class
should be accompanied by a reform in
i the methods of instruction.
If we are to maintain the present
system of compulsory attend an ce»-.-of
lectures, then let the professor fulfill
some useful purpose. He must change
his attitude toward the student. He
should not regard the student as a
mere receptacle. The professor should
not stand on the platform and dole
out facts as charity kitchens dish out

Let's cut out this sugar-coated bally
hooing. Haven't we had about enough
of this highly seasoned bologna? We
need less dogma and less propaganda.
It is time we faced a few facts.
It will no doubt be a good many
years before any great change can be
brought about in the college educa
tional system of America ae a whole,
because the sluggish, perverted minds
of the multitude are being hokus
pokused by a few bigoted individuals
who have this American idea of quan
tity production rooted deeply in their
shallow minds. They seem to have a
strangle-hold on the Presidents and
administrators of colleges. It would
take an army of French revolutionists
to overthrow the entire system of edu
cation. The following suggestions are
meant only for Stanford, an institution
j supposedly founded on democracy, in
dividualism, and freedom from outside
political influence. Stanford is yet in
her infancy and a change is overdue.
First, let President Wilbur dismiss
his dream about extending the quad
rangles to the highway, and erecting
new buildings sufficient to take in a
j greater number. Then let the Presi
dent. the faculty, and the administra
tors get together and decide for what
purpose Stanford is being run.
Stanford should be run for the stu
dents. Its purpose should be to en
courage students to do their own
thinking. Let Stanford cater to those
who eagerly desire knowledge, and
not to that great majority who are
sent to college by solicitous parents
that they may gain that social cachet,
which is a result of four years' loiter
ing at a college. Clear away this group
who are interested only in imbibing
and not in contributing to learning.
Exclusion of this disinterested class
should be accompanied by a reform in
i the methods of instruction.
If we are to maintain the present
system of compulsory attend an ce»-.-of
lectures, then let the professor fulfill
some useful purpose. He must change
his attitude toward the student. He
should not regard the student as a
mere receptacle. The professor should
not stand on the platform and dole
out facts as charity kitchens dish out
soup. Education cannot be poured
into people's ears, but "like the fer
mentation of liquors is an internal
fruition."
In early days, when textbooks were
few and priceless, it was the teacher's
chief purpose to predigest the con
tents of books and give the informa
tion via local expression to the inter
ested students who gathered about
him. Today when texts are plentiful
and cheap, if the lecturer has any pur
pose at all it surely isn't to feed
spoon-like doses of predigested mental
peptones to his half-sleepy, unatten
tive audience. Granting that these lec
tures of facts are necessary, then do
away with this stupid exam system
where the student is not encouraged
to give personal judgment, but is re
quested and forced to give back kernel
for kernel those grains of far-fetched
wisdom imparted by Professor So-and-
So (names by request). Socrates lead
the approach to learning not by laws
or facts laid down but. by mearts of
answers required by his pupils. Let
the professor not only encourage pro
ductive thought but "require" it. The
jhange must be broughj, fibout by the'
leaders or professors; for it is the
truth that Huxley speaks when he
says, "Springs cannot rise higher than
their sources."
If we are compelled to listen to
these ready-made lectures, the stu
dents, too, must change their attitude.
They should enter the classroom in a
skeptical and, if need be, rebellious
state of mind. They should accept ihe
facts given by the professor but weigh
the value of his statements and ques
tion each and every remark. Perhaps
then the student will have a mind of
his own and will think independently
—not have a few memorized, borrowed
ideas.
True, Mr. Bull Session, the Univer
sity requires only a "C" grade. It is

(he duty of the University, however,
to require more than a grade. Let
Stanford do away with the useless
bawlout, which places a false ol
learning on many. Let the professors
and administrators stop twaddling
about high scholastic standing, honor
points, and grades. Let them encour
age the students to independent, pro
ductive thinking at the earliest stage
possible, that he may take his place
in the world of ideas after graduation,
not as a street car conductor alias col
lege graduate, but as a producer and
an intelligent man. Let us hope that
Stanford makes a change, for —•
"The slaves of custom and established
mode,
With pack-horse constancy we keep
the road.
Crooked or straight, through quags or
throny dells,
True to the jingling of our leader's
bells."
Yours Sincerely,
Ernie Guffin.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been following with great in
terest the Yell Leading tryouts, and
was greatly surprised, as were many
others with whom I have talked, to
find that the Rally Committee in mak
ing yesterday's cut, cut out number
ELEVEN (11).
Now I do not know the name of
number 11, neither do I care; however,
I do feel that he should at least have
been permitted to go up before the
student body at the spring election.
I have heard that there existed
much rancor between the Row and the
Hall, but did not place much faith in
this assertion until this unfair cut was
made. I say unfair, because out of
SEVEN row men, FIVE were retained,
and if the basis is, according to Part
II of the by-laws, MERIT ONLY, all of
these row men should NOT have been
on, especially TWO from the SAME
house.
But there is still time to rectify this
grievous ERROR, for according to the
by-laws, THE EXECUTIVE COMMIT
TEE CAN CHECK UP ON THIS CUT.
Let's hear from some other students
who are in favor of giving number 11
a square deal. It's to the interest of
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, not any
cliques or politicians.
Yours for a square deal, '30.
