HORACE GREELEY, by Don C. Seitz; |
Bobbs-IV'errill.
"The poor white hat? If, alas, it
covered many weaknesses, it covered
much strength, much real kindness '
and benevolence, and much that the ,
world will be better for "
Thus spoke Harriet Beecher Stowe,
famous author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, |
when the news came that Horace
Greeley, "the man who was the New
York Tribune," was no more.
One lays down the biography of the !
great editor by Mr. Seitz, himself a
newspaper man of note, with a feeling !
that Horace Greeley's weaknesses,
however large they may have bulked
in those early postbellum days of
bloody shirt and bitter memories, were
only the dramatic human properties of
a character seldom equalled in the j
annals of America, for a moral enthu
siasm that never faltered, for convic- 1
tion that had no price, and for courage
that bowed only to death.
To the American newspaper man
Horace Greeley is one • of the land
marks in the history of American
journalism; a name to be spoken with
respect akin to reverence; a pioneer
ing torch that still lights the way for
the best traditions of the craft. To
the man in the street he is a vague, 1
bespectacled face, rotund and ringed
with peculiar whiskers —and perhaps
surmounted by the famous broad
brimmed hat, which peers, perhaps,
when his name is mentioned, dimly
from the page of some forgotten school
book. A name —hardly more than that.
Horace Greeley, as Mr. Seitz por
trays him, was a man so devoted to
ideas that he labored for their sake —
not for any material return that they
might bring him. He let his stock in
the Tribune dribble away, even when
he was the head and front of it. He
must have regarded money as a ma
terial fact and as such only incidental
to human progress—which, ultimately
considered, it really is—though it is
hoped that this doctrine will turn no
body away from accepting an advance
in salary or a favorable investment in
real estate.
The great merit of Mr. Seitz's book
! is that the character and significance
i of Horace Greeley stand out clearly.
! He was an uncommon American —and
. yet he was a shining example of that
spirit which has been so conspicuously
American —the spirit of moral enthusi
asm. Reading the life of Horace
Greeley should be an antidote for the

poisons of a dollar-chasing and ma-1
terialistic age. Inconsistent as he may
have been at times —and men who
work largely with ideas are likely to 1
bessheo —he had an abiding faith in the ;
spirit of civilization that works un
seen beneath the hurly-burly of ma- j
terial things in conflict.
This is the light that shines in dark
ness; this is the answer to all the!
winds of calamity; this is the spirit)
that made Horace Greeley a great!
editor and a great American.
—Thermos Quince.
