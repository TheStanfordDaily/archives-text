# BERKELEY PROFESSOR FINDS INDIAN RELICS IN IMPERIAL VALLEY
## 
### 
A new treasure trove of Indian relics
lias been uncovered in.a series of caves
in Imperial Valley, west oÂ£ Brawley and
ten to twelve miles north of the Super
stition Mountains, according to Professor
Hiram W. Edwards of the physics de
partment of the University of California
at Los Angeles.
Exploration of the caves disclosed a
large number of beautiful jars and house
hold utensils, designed by Indians per
haps a thousand or more years ago. The
jars are of exceptional beauty, according
to Professor Edwards, and form the most
interesting collection of objects found
in the caves.
They stand from a foot and a half to
two feet in height and are covered with
geometric patterns, in which the triangle
predominates. The caves all give evi
dence of having been once occupied by
Indians, and all show that they were
above the water level when the ocean
flowed on the Imperial Valley floor.
A human footprint, made many cen
turies ago and distinctly impressed in
what has now become rock, also was
found in one of the caves, Professor
Edwards stated.
