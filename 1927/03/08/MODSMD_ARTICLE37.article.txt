# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Manuel Alonso, the dashing, fiery
Spaniard who was ranked second
among the players of the country by
the United States Lawn Tennis Assoc
iation last month, will make a strong
bid in the near future to win the indoor
championship of his adopted land.
Alonso is known as one of the fastest
players in the game and his chief
opponent on the board courts of the
Seventh Regiment armory will be an
other "Lightning Latin," Jean Bo
rotra, of France, who, many consider,
is just as fast as, or faster than,
Manuel Alonso.
For those who delight in dash and
color and a fast pace in sports, this
meeting between the "Bounding Bas
que" and the "Animated Aragonese"
should be full of thrills. Give me a
chance to watch brilliant court-burning
demons like Alonso and Borotra every
time! I'd rather see a match between
these two any day than one between

LaCoste and Johnson, for instance.
Manuel Alonso has for several years
now been a resident of Fullerton, Pa.
With his brother Jose, he has played
on Spanish Davis Cup teams, and his
magnificent forehand and backhand
drives have brought him through
Bill Tilden and Vincent Richards,
victorious over such great players as
Manuel is one of those athletes who
compete at high tension, their deter
mination to win being very evident
from the time the first ball is served.
1 have seen him collapse in the midst
of a close match on account of the
terrific heat, only to a9k that a bucket
of water be thrown over him, and then
return to carry on the battle. His
color, speed, and personality, have
made him a prime favorite wherever
he has played and the announcement
that had been honored with the No.
2 ranking position was received with
joy by his many friends.
