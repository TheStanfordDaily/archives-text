# CONCLUDING GAMES IN INTERCLASS DIAMOND SERIES SLATED TODAY
## 
### 
Concluding games in the annual in
terclass baseball series, which have
been on the shelf for the past week
due to the inclepiency of the weather,
are scheduled to take place this after
noon. Both games will be called at
3:30 o'clock on the diamonds immedi
ately below the new tennis courts.
The freshmen meet the juniors for
the championship, and the sophomores
face the seniors to determine third
and fourth places.
With a fast, snappy organization
which came to the fore at the last
minute in its game with the sopho
mores, the 1930 team looks like the
logical winner of the title. Templeman
and Simkins, with Leverenz, the first
string pitcher, have been rapidly ap
proaching mid-season form, and the
rest of the team has been hitting well
in the pinches.
The juniors put Wilhelmy on the
mound in their game with the seniors
just in time to stave off defeat, but
lack of any reliable substitute should
seriously hamper the work of the
third-year team, in the game this after
noon.
Better hitting ability, and better
pitching give the seniors an edge over
the disorganized 1929 team.
