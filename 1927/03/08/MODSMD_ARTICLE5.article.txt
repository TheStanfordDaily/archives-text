# GENE TUNNEY MAY SPEAK INFORMALLY TO STANFORD MEN
## 
### 
Possibilities that Gene Tunney,
heavyweight champion of the
world, will be on the campus
Thursday morning were greatly
increased by a telegram which
the boxer sent to Harry Maloney
yesterday.
In the message Tunney thanked
Maloney for his invitation and
said that he would extend every
effort to visit Stanford. The
Stanford coach will be in San
Francisco this afternoon, where
Tunney is performing on the
Pantages circuit, and will try to
arrange for his visit. If Tunney
is on the campus lie is to speak
to an informal men's meeting in
the Encina gymnasium.
