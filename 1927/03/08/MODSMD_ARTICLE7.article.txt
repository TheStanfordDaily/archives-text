### 
| The Women's Christian Temperance
j Union of California is sponsoring a
j prize essay contest on the subject,
j "What the Modern Social Order Has
to Gain by Emancipation from the
Drink Custom." Essays, which should
be from 1200 to 2000 words in length
I should be in the hands of the State
I Director of Scientific Temperance In
! struction not later than May 31 to be
j eligible for the State prize of $50.
; State winners will compete for ana-
I tional prize of $100. If at least 25 peo
ple from Stanford compete there will
I also -be a college prize of $25.
Mrs. Louise I. Taft, National
! W.C.T.U. Field Secretary, who was on
the campus over the week-end, says
that the object of the essay contest
is the desire to have students think
of the subject in this form as a sub
j stitute for the constant debate on the
! proposition to make beer and wine
| legal that is becoming so popular. "It
j seems futile," Mrs. Taft said, "for stu
' dents to expend time and thought de
| bating the advantages of a proposal
which is clearly illegal and impos
sible.
"It is worthwhile, however, for them
J to look into the matter from the angle
that we propose."
Those interested can get material
| to aid them in writing their essays
i by applying to Mrs. Taft at her office
j in Colusa.
