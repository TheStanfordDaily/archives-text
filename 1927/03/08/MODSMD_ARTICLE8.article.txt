# Chappie Satirizes "Walk A Milers" In Next Number
## 
### 
| Smokers and their ilk will be ex
posed in the March issue of Chaparral, ;
which will be out tomorrow. The Old |
i Boy, for the last time under the direc- j
tion of Thomas Breeze, Jr., who has |
been succeeded by Winston Norman, ;
| will divulge various and sundry facts'
j about those individuals addicted to!
the practice of "walking a mile" or ■
"blowing some my way." The editor •
has announced that Chaparral takes
no sides on the evils or benefits of
the weedy habit, but gibes impartially
and good-naturedly at the contestants, j
| t
< L. R. C. Malmquist has carried on j
international investigation of the cus- j
torn of "bumming" smokes, and pre-1
i sents full-page graphic proof that it is i
I hard to borrow a cigarette in any J
1 language. Sir Walter Raleigh contri- j
! butes an article on the discovery of i
tobacco, and- the Old Boy makes an i
| expose of the "Empty package gag" j
and other felonious methods of ex- j
: torting smokes. D. L. Teilhet shows
I pictorially how the "blow some my
j way" propaganda disrupted the affairs i
: of a great American city.
