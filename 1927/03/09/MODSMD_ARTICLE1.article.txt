Cards Seek Vengeance
Last year the L.A.A.C. won from |
the Stanford track squad by a score I
of 67-64 at Palo Alto. The Redshirts |
are out to wipe away the stain of that j
defeat in 1927, although the Clubmen ,
are represented by a stroug group.
At present Stanford's track men are i
scheduled to leave Palo Alto on Tues-1
day of vacation week for the L.A.A.C. j
meet which will be held Thursday of
that week. It is possible that the i
Cardinal team will remain in Los An-J
geles to see the U.S.C.-U.C. meet which !
is to be held March 28.
