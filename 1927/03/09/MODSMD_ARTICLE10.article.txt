# YEARLING BASEBALL MEN PLAY MISSION HIGH SCHOOL TODAY
## Husky Hunt's Diamond Nine May Meet Eight Teams For Practice 
### 
When the freshman baseball team
meets the Mission High School nine at 3
o'clock this afternoon on the Stanford
field, it may be the opening of a stren
uous eight-game schedule before the
California freshman series early in April.
Besides the interclass match tomorrow,
if present plans go through the Cardinal
beginners will have one game Saturday
against an undecided opponent, and seven
contests during spring vacation. The 1930
adversaries will probably be the Roose
velt, Palo Alto, San Mateo, San Jose,
and Fremont high schools ,and the San
Jose Teachers and San Mateo Junior col
leges. The exact playing dates have not
been definitely arranged except the first
game is scheduled for March 19.
Coach Husky Hunt put his men
through a fairly light work-out in yes
terday's practice, catching flies and
throwing around bases. He expects some
stiff opposition in the Mission team and
will have his first string men on the
diamond. The lineup that he will use is
Levernz or Simkins, pitching; Sparks or
McCoy, catching; Levin, first base;
Storey, second base; Laird, third base;
Bianchi, shortstop; Murphy, left field;
Berg, ccnter field; Pease or Nye, right
field.
Berg and Laird have been going strong
on field work and both are good hitters.
Storey has been knocking some nice ones
in the previous games of the season. The
Babes defeated the Hayward High
School nine Saturday by a 6 to 3 score,
playing creditable ball.
Coach Hunt expressed his opinion of
the yearling squad as one of satisfaction
and thinks that the Babes should be one
of the best teams they have ever had since
he has been here.
