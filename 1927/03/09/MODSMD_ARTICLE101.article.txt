"Although the present revolution in
China is detrimental to Christianity, it
may in the long run prove beneficial
by weeding out the unworthy para
sites from the church," stated Reve
rend John Nichols, American mission
ary in Shanghai, in an address to the
Stanford Episcopal Club Sunday night.
"Christianity was first introduced
into China from Persia in the fifth
century A.D.," said Reverend Nichols
in outlining the history of missionary
work in the Orient. A split came when
the Catholics accepted the Pope's
translation of "God" instead of the
Chinese emperor's version.
"When the Chinese have rid them
selves of all foreigners and their in
stitutions, they will build their own
internal policies of government," con
cluded Nichols.
