## 
### 
Turning the seniors back one. two,
i three in every inning, the 192° interciass
| baseball nine, chiefly through the work
of pitcher Doug Lewis, yesterday earned
I the right to play for second place in the
' interciass series by a score of 6-0. Two
seniors got on base, but both were caught
i asleep off the bags.
The sophomores showed a fair defen-
I sive and an ability to capitalize on the
| senior misplays with which the five inn
j ings were crowded. Both teams suffered
j from a lack of regular players. Winters'
j sure work at first shone for 1Q29, and
j Rritton pitched a good game for the
l seniors.
The lineups were: Sophomores—Hart
ley, Wright, McKey, Lewis, Kern, O'Sul
livan, Winters, Fuller, Russ; Seniors—
Railard. Britton, Compton, Morill, Har
old, George, Stock-bridge, Bogue, Wents.
