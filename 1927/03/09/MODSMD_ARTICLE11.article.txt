# EPICURE EXPLORES OFF-CAMPUS EATING PLACES ORIENTAL KITCHENS LACK CLEANLINESS DINING AND QUEENING DO NOT MIX AT STANFORD

(This is the final article of a serifs of
surveys. The peripatetic Daily scribe
visits the Union and Palo Alto and
draws his own conclusions.)
By "The Hungry Reporter"
The eating problem is not confined to
the campus. Between five and seven hun
dred students each quarter live off-cam
pus, most of them in Palo Alto, although
many commute from nearby homes.
With one exception the chief question
Pnlo Alto asks a prospective eater is,
"Will you have it Chinese, Greek, or pay
50 cents more?" There arc plenty of
restaurants in town—but none to write
home about, and most of the students
who live in furnislfed rooms drift around
from one place to another with a notice
able congregation at a couple of the ori
ental resorts near the end of the month.
Tour Is Educational
With all due respect to Chinese cooks,
who arc capable and reasonably careful
and sanitary if watched, a lack of cur
iosity as to what goes in the food and

| how is not so much a sign of apathy as
good judgment on the part of the Chinese
restaurant eater. One good pacifier for
those who complain against University
administered dining rooms would be a
| tour of Palo Alto kitchens.
Some may prefer to believe that the
town Chinese, Greek, and Hebraic cater
ers always use the best quality meats,
milk and other ingredients, observing
scrupulous care that kitchens are modern
and sanitary, dishes perfectly washed,
flies kept out, and bread not left ex
posed. Optimists are an ingenuous
tribe!
In this case pre-empting the collegc
tovvn field, one enterprising Palo Alto
business man has built up a highly suc
cessful business and made his name an
I institution by catering to men only. When
I the crowd isn't too great the quickest
service in town can l>e had there.
There are two cafeterias in Palo Alto,
only one of which receives much campus
trade. It is good enough but expensive,
even as cafeterias go.
There are also five tea-rooms quite well
patronized by University students, mostly
post graduates and the kind of men who
can wear golf pants without being self
conscious. Seventy-five cents is about
the minimum cost of a tea-room meal
with $1.50 as a convenient maximum.
Less "queening"' is done than might l>e
expected in a college town.
Union Progressive
Having suffered the Cellar and several
misadventures at one time or another in
the Cafeteria, dining room and "roost,"
the reporter was in the mood to believe
almost anything unkind about the Union.
But a thorough tour and inquiry con
vinced him that the Union is one of th£
most admirable and progressive bits of
service work to the credit of the Uni
versity.
The Union i- not an accident or tenta
tive experiment. For better or worse it
is the final of a long line of food distrib
uting establishments on the campus after
its predecessors had quit or been ban
ished atnid the "bread riots" of aerlier
days.
Run on Cost Basis
It is run on a cost basis by what seems
to be a highly efficient management, func
tioning with the best equipment. The
Union is a public utility and one which
would be more appreciated if the details
of its service were better known to the
students.
Twelve hundred sales are made in a
typical day, averaging thirteen cents each
at "ruff's roost" or the Union Store. The
Encina Store does about half as much
business.
The cafeteria is best patronized at noon
when about 200 are served on a typical
day. Thirty-one cents is the average cost
of a cafeteria mean and eighteen cents the
customary breakfast.
Serves 1200
The dining room serves a hundred or
more patrons at lunch and about thirty
less in the evening. The average dining
room meal costs fifty cents.
The Union makes ice-cream for all the
halls and is now manufacturing commer
cially for the rest of the campus. The
highest quality of milk is used, real fruit
juice instead of artificial chemical com
pounds.
Conclusions Drawn
Undertaking to regularly and health
fully feed nearly fifteen hundred students,
the University is up against a big job,
doing it very creditably and deserves
whatever co-operation the students can
give.
Food at Encina, Roble, and the Union
doc a taste of being cooked in a large
kitchen It was. And there seems to be
limits on the desirability of quantity pro
duet'Vtn of food. Whatever the directors
an -• ••lent governing groups can do to
minimize the institution effect is an ad
vantage.
At both Encina and Roble, the students ;
have final governing machinery. They set !
the price, have a menu committee, and !
whenever dissatisfied ought to do their
kicking where it will get results.
Dietetically speaking, the Greek letter
houses are hardly perfect. But they en
joy eating together and that compensates 1
for possible caloric irregularity.
Sequoia Clever
Sequoia, in offering only twenty meals j
week and requiring the members to eat
elsewhere the twenty-first that they may j
better appreciate their advantages, is us
ing clever psychology.
Those who have to eat downtown, un
less fortunate in choice of boarding
houses, are to be pitied. But with much
pattering around, they can survive and
not much excccd a dollar a day.
