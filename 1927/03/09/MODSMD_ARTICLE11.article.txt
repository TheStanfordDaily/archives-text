draws his own conclusions.)

The eating problem is not confined to
the campus. Between five and seven hun
dred students each quarter live off-cam
pus, most of them in Palo Alto, although
many commute from nearby homes.
With one exception the chief question
Pnlo Alto asks a prospective eater is,
"Will you have it Chinese, Greek, or pay
50 cents more?" There arc plenty of
restaurants in town—but none to write
home about, and most of the students
who live in furnislfed rooms drift around
from one place to another with a notice
able congregation at a couple of the ori
ental resorts near the end of the month.
Tour Is Educational
With all due respect to Chinese cooks,
who arc capable and reasonably careful
and sanitary if watched, a lack of cur
iosity as to what goes in the food and

| how is not so much a sign of apathy as
good judgment on the part of the Chinese
restaurant eater. One good pacifier for
those who complain against University
administered dining rooms would be a
| tour of Palo Alto kitchens.
Some may prefer to believe that the
town Chinese, Greek, and Hebraic cater
ers always use the best quality meats,
milk and other ingredients, observing
scrupulous care that kitchens are modern
and sanitary, dishes perfectly washed,
flies kept out, and bread not left ex
posed. Optimists are an ingenuous
tribe!
In this case pre-empting the collegc
tovvn field, one enterprising Palo Alto
business man has built up a highly suc
cessful business and made his name an
I institution by catering to men only. When
I the crowd isn't too great the quickest
service in town can l>e had there.
There are two cafeterias in Palo Alto,
only one of which receives much campus
