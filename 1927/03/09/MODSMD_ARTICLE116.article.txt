# CHAPARRAL EXPOSES SMOKERS IN LATEST ISSUE OF MAGAZINE
## 
### 
All those individuals addicted to
the practice of "walking a mile."
"being satisfied," and "blowing some
my way," are exposed in the Smok
ers' Number of Chaparral that is
for .sale 011 the Quad today. Vari
ous and sundry secrets about these
people are broadcasted by the 01d
Hoy, for the last time under the
direction of Thomas Breeze, Jr.,
who has been succeeded by Winston
Norman. Chaparral taks no sides on
the sins and benefits caused by the
filthy weed, but good-naturedly and
impartially gibes at both arguments.
Ati expose of the "empty package
gag" and other felonious methods
of exhorting smokes is made by the
Old Boy. The estimable Sir Walter
Raleigh contributes to the number
with an article on the historical dis
covery of tobacca, while an inter
national investigation of the custom
of "bumming" smokes, with a full
page graphic proof that it is just as
hard in every language, has been
carried on by L. R. C. Malmquist.
D. L. Teilhet shows pictorially how
the "blow some my way" propa
ganda disrupts the law and order of
any great American city if* carried
out too literally.
