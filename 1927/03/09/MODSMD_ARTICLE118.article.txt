# AMERICAN COLLEGE POLO SUPERIOR TO ENGLISH-R.F. KELLY

"American college polo is far superior
|to k t!ie English style of play, although the
; English were originally the teachers of
American understudies," says Robert E.
j Kelley, sports writer on the New York
i T i mes.
"Polo will come into its own as a uni-
I versal college sport in the immediate fu
ture,' predicted Kelley. "While it prob
| ably will never approach the major sport
J stage on account of the heavy expendi
tures involved, it will soon become a
| regular college sport.
"Eor a sport in the fourth or fifth
year of its infancy, polo has cut a tre
mendously heavy swath in college circles,
and must be reckoned with as an out
standing collegiate game in the future,"
Mr. Kelley declared. "There is no ques
tion but that poio is one of the most
popular of all contests from the point of
view of the spectator, on account of the
dashing vigor of the play, and in time 1
believe that college audiences will de
mand polo with nearly an equal vocifera
tion to their present demand for football.
"The recent boom in college polo has
been confined almost entirely to eastern
fields, with Arizona being the only west
ern university to exhibit active interest,"
Kelley added.
Sketching the history of the develop
ment of polo as a sport, Kefley said:
"Polo, one of the world's oldest sports,
had its origin in Persia and later ex
tended to India and from there British
officers brought the game to England.
American enthusiasts have bettered the
sport within the last few years by the
introduction of a forward passing sys
tem," he concluded.
