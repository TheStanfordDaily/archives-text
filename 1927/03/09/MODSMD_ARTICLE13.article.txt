granted by the Executive Committee last
night to E. W. Anderson, Byron Bryant,
Wallace Jayred, Louis Vincenti, Albert

Authorization was given to the Student
Manager to make tentative arrangements
for a concert series for next year, final
arrangements to be subject to the ap
proval of the Executive Committee. Pos
sibilities of securing Sousa's band, Schu
mann-Heinck, Tibbett, and Bauer on next
year's program were mentioned by Bob
Lewis.
As no organization had applied for a
registration dance date for March 29, the
student body president was authorized
to grant such a date upon application to
him, subject to the approval of the
committee.
Freshman numerals were awarded to
the seven 1930 basketball players playing
the required time in the California series.
A special award was also granted to J.
K. Stewart, although he lacked two min
utes of playing the required time.
Fourteen varsity swimmers were grant
ed Circle "S's" for placing in the Cali
fornia meet, while twelve freshmen were
awarded Circle "30's" for similar com
petition.
Wayne Smith and Harry Dietrich were
granted second class minor sports awards
for placing against California in the gym
nastics meet.
The question of making a similar
award to Guy King was deferred until
the next meeting until it could be deter
mined whether such an award is possible.
King missed placing in the California
meet by ten hundredths of a point, losing
to a California man who was later found
to be ineligible.
