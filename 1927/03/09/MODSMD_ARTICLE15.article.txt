# ANNUAL INTRAMURAL SWIMMING MEET WON BY SEQUOIA ENTRIES
## Bramel, Encina 1W, Lowers Four-Lap Free Style Sensationally 
### 
By winning two first placcs, one sec- ;
ond, one third, three fourths, and one j
fifth, Sequoia won first place in the an- j
nual intramural swimming meet by a \
margin of six points over its nearest
rivals, Encina IYV.
Every intramural record in the six
races was broken by times from 2-5 sec
onds to over 27 seconds. The most sen
sational mark was made when Bramel, i
swimming for Encina I\V, took the ree- j
ord for the four-lap free style from 1 :53 j
down to 1:25 2-5. He also took first
place in the one-lap dash in 0:16 4-5, a!
time which not breaking the record made |
in the preliminaries by Webster, was i
enough to break the old time of 0:17. !
Flint of Sequoia and Thornton of En- ;
cina 3E staged a neck-and-neck race for I
over half of the two-lap breast stroke, '
but in the last few yards, the Sequoia '
man spurted ahead to win by less than a j
foot. Barry, who took third for Phi j
... I
Delt, came in just behind the two leaders. ;
Three men raced on practically even j
terms throughout the two-lap backstroke, I
and when they finished, scarcely a yard j
separated the first from the third. Nor- j
wood of Sequoia placed first in the rec- j
ord time of 0:48 4-5, Jessop of A.T.O.
took second, while Moore of Alpha Delt
finished third.
Bramel, who had previously won over
Webster in the one-lap free style, and'
over Christenson of Sequoia in the four
lap, entered against Webster in the two
lap swim, but could not get anofher first
place. He gave plenty of competition to
the Fiji swimmer and nearly beat him
out, but could not come through in the
last few lengths. Ryan and Christenson,
both of Sequoia, placed third and
fourth.
After consistently turning in the best
dives, Babson of Encirta 3W missed on
one of his tries and lost out to Cressey
of Phi Sig, who was awarded first place.
Murphy took third for the Breakers with
a nervy exhibition.
Returning from a hard swim in the
j backstroke, Moore of Alpha Delt started
in the last lap of the relay and covered
the length of the pool fast enough to
bring his team into first place with the
new time of 1 :13 1-5. Phi Sig took sec
ond, the Breakers, third, and Sequoia,
fourth.
