# Where Do We Eat?
## 
### 
Food is defined as a nutritive material absorbed or taken into the body
for purposes of growth or repair and for maintenance of the vital process.
I his definition does not coincide with the names applied by students to
the materials which are passed out under the name of food in the campus
eating places. Some people eat to live, while others live to eat, but all
people criticize that which they are forced to eat.
1 he Daily has been filled with students' opinions on the food situa
tion on the campus. The meals in Kncina Hall are ' rotten,'" according to
many critical freshmen. Ihe food served in the Union is not even edible,
according to other irritated ones. The Cafeteria serves unbalanced meals
at exorbitant prices, is the cry of still others. And so on. The criticism
is not confined to the public eating places. Members of fraternities,
sororities, and eating clubs constantly complain to the managers of their
respective groups.
I he Hungry Reporter was sent out to investigate the situation, and
he has been busy during the past week. He took 011 nourishment at
Encina, Roble, the Union, and in several eating clubs and fraternity
houses. He rather enjoyed the experience, and by actual count, gained
weight during the past week. He found no "rotten" food at any of the
eating places. He discovered that food, in its technical sense—anything
that nourishes, develops, or sustains—was served in every dining room
on the campus.
In reading all the criticisms that have been printed, one should not
become conceited and think that this is one more thing that is peculiar at
Stanford. It is a universal complaint.
Ihe ale Alumni Weekly prints a freshman's wail. It sounds so
familiar, and so like the letters appearing in our own Campus Opinion
Column, that we cannot help thinking that the freshman must have gone
10 Stanford at some previous time. Risking the possibility of boring our
readers, we are printing the letter in whole:
"Yesterday it was my humble lot to be one of the 876 unfortunate
freshmen who every day are forced unwillingly to elbow their way into
that den of iniquity called Yale University Commons. Hungry from a
hard morning's work and mindful that my last morsel of nourishment
had been finished some five and a half hours previously, I eagerly scanned
the menu for something at least rather substantial, if not too tasty, being
restrained from too high hopes by past experiences. Well, for once it
was not the proverbial Prime Ribs of Roast Beef duly commented on in
past communications to the News, but would that it had been, rather than
the unholy sight which met my eyes! I think that when you have heard
what the contractors of the University consider a fine menu for us fresh
men, you will agree with me when I say that the courses would have been
much more appropriate for a second-class Chinese-American restaurant
on I*riday. There was a generous choice to begin with, between Ameri
can Chop Suey (Hash) with Rice, or four sardines and some ice-cold
potato salad, but the safest choice was nothing. Tempting, to say the
least, but to top it off came Dill Pickles and a Jelly Roll.
"The writer is not of a complaining disposition by nature, but if a
little public opinion will help to remedy this disagreeable situation, this
article will not have been written in vain."
The Yale Alumni Weekly briefly comments: "Outbursts like the
above are an inevitable result of the present Freshmen eating-system, yet
the classes seem to come and go, and thrive on Chop Suey, Sardines, and
Dill Pickles."
All the Daily has to say about the matter is that such criticism of the
food situation on the campus is as annual an event as is the Founders'
Day or the Big Game. And to copy the Yale publication, classes have
come and gone and thrived 011 "handfuls of small rocks otherwise known
as baked beans, served regularly at the Cafeteria."

"The writer is not of a complaining disposition by nature, but if a
little public opinion will help to remedy this disagreeable situation, this
article will not have been written in vain."
The Yale Alumni Weekly briefly comments: "Outbursts like the
above are an inevitable result of the present Freshmen eating-system, yet
the classes seem to come and go, and thrive on Chop Suey, Sardines, and
Dill Pickles."
All the Daily has to say about the matter is that such criticism of the
food situation on the campus is as annual an event as is the Founders'
Day or the Big Game. And to copy the Yale publication, classes have
come and gone and thrived 011 "handfuls of small rocks otherwise known
as baked beans, served regularly at the Cafeteria."
Food is defined as a nutritive material absorbed or taken into the body
for purposes of growth or repair and for maintenance of the vital process.
I his definition does not coincide with the names applied by students to
the materials which are passed out under the name of food in the campus
eating places. Some people eat to live, while others live to eat, but all
people criticize that which they are forced to eat.
1 he Daily has been filled with students' opinions on the food situa
tion on the campus. The meals in Kncina Hall are ' rotten,'" according to
many critical freshmen. Ihe food served in the Union is not even edible,
according to other irritated ones. The Cafeteria serves unbalanced meals
at exorbitant prices, is the cry of still others. And so on. The criticism
is not confined to the public eating places. Members of fraternities,
sororities, and eating clubs constantly complain to the managers of their
respective groups.
I he Hungry Reporter was sent out to investigate the situation, and
he has been busy during the past week. He took 011 nourishment at
Encina, Roble, the Union, and in several eating clubs and fraternity
houses. He rather enjoyed the experience, and by actual count, gained
weight during the past week. He found no "rotten" food at any of the
eating places. He discovered that food, in its technical sense—anything
that nourishes, develops, or sustains—was served in every dining room
on the campus.
In reading all the criticisms that have been printed, one should not
become conceited and think that this is one more thing that is peculiar at
Stanford. It is a universal complaint.
Ihe ale Alumni Weekly prints a freshman's wail. It sounds so
familiar, and so like the letters appearing in our own Campus Opinion
Column, that we cannot help thinking that the freshman must have gone
10 Stanford at some previous time. Risking the possibility of boring our
readers, we are printing the letter in whole:
"Yesterday it was my humble lot to be one of the 876 unfortunate
freshmen who every day are forced unwillingly to elbow their way into
that den of iniquity called Yale University Commons. Hungry from a
hard morning's work and mindful that my last morsel of nourishment
had been finished some five and a half hours previously, I eagerly scanned
the menu for something at least rather substantial, if not too tasty, being
restrained from too high hopes by past experiences. Well, for once it
was not the proverbial Prime Ribs of Roast Beef duly commented on in
past communications to the News, but would that it had been, rather than
the unholy sight which met my eyes! I think that when you have heard
what the contractors of the University consider a fine menu for us fresh
men, you will agree with me when I say that the courses would have been
much more appropriate for a second-class Chinese-American restaurant
on I*riday. There was a generous choice to begin with, between Ameri
can Chop Suey (Hash) with Rice, or four sardines and some ice-cold
potato salad, but the safest choice was nothing. Tempting, to say the
least, but to top it off came Dill Pickles and a Jelly Roll.
