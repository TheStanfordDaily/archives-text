The Stanford Daily ceases publication for the quarter with this issue
of the paper. The next edition will appear on the morning' t)f Spring
Registration Day, or to be more exact, on March 28. It is believed that
reading the Daily every morning takes too much of the student's time
when final examinations are staring him in the face. Whether there is
any truth in this statement is a matter of conjecture. The reporters are
cursed with finals along with the rest of the students, so it is thought best
to discontinue until next quarter.
The Daily has attempted in today's paper to print all of the vital news
of the campus for the remainder of the quarter. Jt has attempted to clean
up all of the Campus"T)pinions that have been received up to today. It
was necessary to cut some of the student's letters in order to print them
all. Next semester a more rigid observation will be maintained in regard
to the rules governing the Opinion Column. The editor reserves the right
to cut any letter to the 250-word mark. lie also reserves the right to
