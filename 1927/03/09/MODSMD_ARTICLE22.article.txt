The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the selection of candidates
for yell leader by the rally committee,
we understand that they are to be se
lected according to merit alone. In see
ing the resuLts of the cuts recently made
we have come to believe that this basis
of selection is a theory rather than a
practice. If merit was the basis for se
lection we believe that No. 11, whose
name we are told is Frank Sauliere,
should head the list. In the estimation
of many others as well as ourselves, this
candidate seems far superior to any o'f
the others in the ability to lead yells.
Yet the rally committee who, suppos
edly. is working for the best interests of
tile Associated Students, failed to see
his merits. It seems that such a com
mittee representing a democratic institu
tion such as our student body would not
be influenced by petty prejudices. We do
not object to five men having been se
lected from the Row. What we do object
to is that merit as a basis of selection
was apparently side-tracked in the selec
tion. The converse, five hall men and
one row man, would appear to us just
as corrupt as the present situation, pro
vided that merit .vas not the basis of
selection. It seems to us that an institu
tion such as Stanford could do away
with this petty hall-row antagonism and
co-operate for the betterment of the in
stitution as a whole.
