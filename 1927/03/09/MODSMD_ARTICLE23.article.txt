The Editor, Sir:
While I am in an inspired mood, and
while my head is still whirling from the
jolting I got this morning, I shall seize
the burning moment and pour forth bile
and vituperation upon the head of the
University.
And upon this subject: the alleged
roads that traverse the almost uncharted
wilds of the campus near Toyon Hall.
Why. I ask, must we plod our muddy
ways through chuck holes 1 ojir feet deep
and across hundreds of yards of morass,
week after week until we weary of life
itself? We thank the benevolent admin
istration for the path to the library, but
what's the matter with fixing the one
across lots to the Post Office? Why, also,
must we risk the sacred wheels of our
faithful Fords day after day at the
crossing near Encina?
But the Toyon parking space near the
clubs, people, that is the ultimate, the
last thing, the super-fly in our ointment.
Those who have not yet strolled the floor
of Death Valley, scaled the Matterhorn,
and spent a summer or two exploring
the Bad Lands of Wyoming, keep away
from here; your inexperience will count
against you. Men who have braved many
a tortured canyon have gone down with
out a trace in the mud sloughs of this
horror. Why, I knew a fellow once who
came home late at night in his car, drove
it in this dread waste, shut off the en
gine, stepped out. and has never been
seen since! They found his hat near the
shore of one of the bottomless pits that
this so-called parking area contains, but
they haven't found his body yet.
But all kidding to one side, something
ought to be done about it; steps should
be taken; this thing can't go on. Can't
we please have a nice smooth parking
space, a level approach, a gravel path to
the post office, and a new crossing? Or
any part of this list? Please.
Hope springs eternal in,
C. E. M., '28.
