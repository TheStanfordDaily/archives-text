The Editor, Sir:
One gathers from the tone of Mr.
Kirby's letter that he does not approve of
Stanford. There is a good reason for
the type of plays which are presented at
this. Stanford students as a rule are
above the average, but perhaps Mr. Kirby
is the exception that proves the rule.
'George Jean Nathan wrote, "When the
average American goes into a theater
today, his taste is not for respectable
drama, but for trash. That trash may
take the form of a moving picture, a
vaudeville show, or anything else just so
long as it makes no call upon him for
imagination, an appreciation of beauty,
even a modest amount of intelligence, or
an artistic sensitiveness above that of a
bologna sausage."
Though Mr. Kirby suggested nothing
which would assist our council in the
choice of plays, I am freely offering
him a suggestion. He will find all the
bedroom farce he can witness within a
few blocks of Geary and Market streets,
San Francisco; the tickets there arc 55
cents, and the round trip by bus is only
$1.20. T. L. M.
