The Editor, Sir:
The doctor asked me where I had
been eating. I replied, "at the Union."
His face turned a little ashen at this, and,
shaking his head gravely, he picked up a
knife case, muttering something about,
being sorry, but he supposed he'd have
to operate.
I told him that I was sorry too and
looked towards the door. But on thinking

! of the awful agonies I had suffered for a
| whole year 1 decided that it was better
Ito die at once under the knife than to
i £o back to the campus and die of indi
gestion.
**]****
It was all over. Much to my surprise
I hadn't died after all. The doctor came
in and asked me how I felt.
"Much better," I replied, and asked
him what seemed to be the trouble.
"In the first place," lie told me, "we
removed several handfuls of small rocks."
1 explained that they came with the so
called baked beans served regularly at
the Cafeteria.
"Some of your digestive organ% were
worn very badly," he said. I told him
that they had probably worn themselves
out working on that piece of steak I ate
at the Dining Hall several weeks ago.
Just before Doc left he put on a
| mournful expression and asked, "Er—
I how about your finances now?" Of course
jit was dreadfully embarrassing, but 1
.managed to painfully convey the idea
j that I didn't have any.
"The Unidfgot most of them through
their exorbitant prices," I concluded.
CANTDIGESTIT HAN DIE.
