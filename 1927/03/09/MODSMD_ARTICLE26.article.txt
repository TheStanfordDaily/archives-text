The Editor, Sir:
The decisive victory of the Cardinal
swimming team over California recently
; only further emphasized the fact that we
| ha*e one of the strongest aggregations
j ever turned out in the West. It is re
! grettable that the authorities have can
celled all plans for an eastern trip. It
| seems that the reason for such action is
I that the intercollegiate and the A.A.U.
! swimming meets are three weeks apart,
thereby keeping the athletes away from
i their studies for too long a period.
But, why not send the team to the
j intercollegiate, where they would un
doubtedly rule the favorites? Already
1 the proud possessors of the national foot
! ball championship and with the intercol
! legiate tennis title practically a certainty,
i the addition of the swimming crown
' would make quite a remarkable record.
