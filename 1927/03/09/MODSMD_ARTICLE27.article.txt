The Editor, Sir:
| In the Monday edition of the Daily
I there comes to us from one Marshall
Kirby rather a useless outburst, written
i for the purpose of instituting a campaign
j for longer and sexier plays, declaring
! also that the Dramatic Council, including
j especially Mr. Davis, since he selects the
j plays, is one of those "green-eyed mon
j sters"—a bureaucracy. My word ! What
i a bad position we are in!
When Gordon Davis, after his return
! from the east last year, issued a state
j ment to the Daily, I don't remember
j that he commented upon the New York
I plays—for which Marshall Kirby seems
i to have a most extraordinary predilection
! —as being unsuited for campus produc-
J tion only because they were, to use Kir
-1 by's adjective, "wicked." He added that
they were not only trashily filthy, but
| that they were bores, badly written and
| with absolutely no dramatic value. In
I selecting the plays for this year, it does
j not appear that lie found it impossible to
buy good ones. With the exception of
;"Jolin Ferguson," which Kirby probably
liked, since it was nothing more nor less
! than a symposium of dreary conversa
j tions, the plays have been quite satis
i factory.
However, no matter what Mr. Davis
j may select, no good will come of it for
jour crusader, for, judging from his opin
! ion of "A Kiss for Cinderella," he'd miss
| the point anyway. Were Mr. Davis to
| select one of the "much missed" plays,
jour champion of dramatic freedom would
' probably fail to grasp even the choicest
j bits of tilth. If our director were to de
' cidc to revive "Anna Christie" for the
I campus, Kirby would characteristically
; miss the mark, and give a mad cry of
joy—A SEX PLAY AT LAST 1 Yum!
Very truly yours,
BAILEY NEWLEE.
