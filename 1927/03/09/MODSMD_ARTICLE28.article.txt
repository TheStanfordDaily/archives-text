The Editor, Sir:
Having very much enjoyed Miss Pon
! selie's concert last Thursday evening, I
was very much disappointed at the flat
I and inane account of it in the next day's
i paper. The concert has been considered
I by the majority to be one of the most
successful of this year's series; yet only
ja very ordinary account of it was pub
l lished. The writer would almost venture
:to bet five to one that the reporter did
: not attend the concert, as there was no
critical comment at all about the songs,
and only one encore was mentioned. The
very gracious manner in which Miss Pon
selle acknowledged the enthusiastic ap
plause was one of the outstanding points
of the concert. If the reporter had been
present at all, lie obviously was in too
much of a hurry to remain after the
conclusion of the regular program, thus
missing the numerous encores.
At least one other college paper with
which the writer is familiar asks some
member of the faculty or a student witji
considerable musical appreciation to com
ment upon a program of this sort.

If he noticed the disparity between the
amount of advance publicity and the ac
count following the concert, one who did
not attend might easily Ik- led to believe
that the concert was a failure. This situ
ation would be comparable to merely
printing the score of a previously well
advertised football game after the play
ing of the game.
This is intended as a piece of construc
tive criticism and not as a personal con
demnation of the reporter, who doubtless
did his best after being assigned a beat
for which he was unfitted.
