The Editor, Sir:
Campus Opinion is a noble instrument
of the seething and teething masses on
the campus, whereby they bare to the
world their ideas and mental develop
ment. As such, it is a good thing. But
when students cram it with very long,
uninteresting phillipics on inconsequential
trifles merely to see their brain children
in print on page two of the Daily, they
destroy its power and appeal, reducing
it to a competitive tryout for the Stan
ford Lit.
People who enjoyed reading the half
dozen comments on whatever Steve
O'Donnell chose to Bull about, now
glance at the lectures on civilization,
morality, and cattle breeding that over
flow the column, and gently pass them
by without swimming through para
graphs to discover the theme of the
proud author.
We trust that the Bull Session will al
ways give the Farm something to think
al»out, and that the Vital Messages will
l>e ground out in a more condensed and
interesting manner.
