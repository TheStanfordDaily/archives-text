# CONSTRUCTION WORK ON AEROPLANE TEST NEARS COMPLETION
## 
### 
Construction on the wind tunnel in the
Guggenheim Aeronautics laboratory is
nearing completion, and it will be ready
for u.sc next quarter, when experiments
on model aeroplanes will be conducted
under the direction of Professor Everett
P. Lesley.
These models will be constructed in
the Mechanical Engineering Department,
of which aeronautics is a division. Tn the
wind tunnel now being built model aero
planes may lie subjected to all the tests
which a wind blowing 80 miles an hour
would make possible.
The old wind tunnel, built for research
work during the war, is soon to be torn
down.
