# CHURCH, U.S. CAUSING TROUBLE IN MEXICO, STRONG DECLARES
## 
### 
"Forces that are troubling Mexico
today are the church within the coun
try and our own government with
out," declared Dr. Sidney Strong of
Seattle, who spoke at a luncheon
ast week to members of the Stanford
Fellowship.
"It would certainly be beneath the
lignity of the United States to start
i war with Mexico," he continued. "It
would be like a six-foot bully picking
an a two-year-old child."
Dr. Strong prefaced his talk with
this statement: "I consider the 'Y'
the freest place in our colleges. 'Y's'
ire like airholes in the ice—sometimes
vou'll fall in, but they are necessary
for the poor fish underneath."
Dr. Strong was a member of a self
issembled party of teachers, ministers,
•-ankers, senators, and several Jewish rab
)is, who made a ten-day visit to Mexico
ast August to make a general survey of
:onditions there.
Discusses Controversy
In discussing the church and state con
roversy, Dr. Strong said that relations
x'tween the two had been strained since
heir separation in 1857. The trouble now
s caused because the state owns the
;hurch buildings and the clergy refuses
o register for them because they do not
,vish to acknowledge the supremacy of
the state. He declared that the state is
lot against religion and that even the
bishops admit that the conflict will not
nirt the church.
In Strong's opinion the big problem is
lot religion or oil but a question of land.
This is being solved by a plan to restore
land to the landless and to assist the
small farmers.
Oil Problem Grave
The oil trouble was caused because the
lew government in 1910 decided that con
tracts must agree with the fundamental
aw that a lease on an underground ma
crial is not permanent. Although 10
per cent of the American owners refused
;o agree to these contracts, other oil
jwners were willing to comply with such
regulations.
Dr. Strong believes that some day Mex
ican art and music will lead in North
America. lie claims that their chict
irtist, Diego Rivera, will undoubtedly be
famous.
