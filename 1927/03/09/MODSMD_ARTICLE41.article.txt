# EARLY ROBLE RESIDENTS ENJOYED FREE EXISTENCE
## 
### 
Back in the nineties, Roble Hall,
which is now known as Sequoia, was
not yet organized into a club; it had
no constitution or officers; and the
only regulation was that girls should
be in at a reasonable hour, or 9 o'clock.
Miss Alice Hays, '9G, has vivid
memories of those early days. In
speaking of Miss Ellen Thompson, who
became house matron the first spring,
she said: "She had a wonderful per
sonality and made the girls feel that
the liall was their home. She started
the Roble library, and after one vaca
tion announced to the girls that
Fidgets, the pet maltese cat, had pre
sented them with the Encyclopedia
Britannica."
Life Was Free
Life was free from many of the con
flicting interests of today. Dances
were held, at the most, two or three
times a quarter and they had to end
at 10 o'clock. Every evening the lights
over the whole University were
switched out at 10:30, and any study
ing after that hour was done by lamp
or candle light. The question of what
to do on Friday nights was simple.
There were no amusements in Palo
Alto, no movies, and few campus pro
ductions. Friday niglit. was calling
night at Roble, the week being re
served for studying. The favorite

| haunt of queeners was "Lover's Lane,"
situated behind the hall, leading to
the San Francisquito creek and or
chards back of the Stanford home.
I Another alumna said: "Dr. Jordan
was our neighbor, and he used to drop
in for informal talks with the girls
whenever he could, discussing the Uni
versity ideals and the serious things of
life. The girls didn't waste time on
lengthy considerations of food and
clothes. We didn't care much what we
ate and were perfectly content with
one best dress."
Glee Club Invades
But life wasn't without its lighter
aspects. The Glee Club used to hold
its tryouts at Roble, and though the
girls regarded the occasion as a lark,
the flustered iryoutees were duly em
j barrassed. During the vacations the
boys had to eat at Roble.
The present tomato fields were
vineyards, and the Convalescent Home
! Dairy, a winery. There was only one
watchman for all the yards, and the
girls used to "sneak" bunches of
luscious grapes up to their rooms for
1 feeds.
Billy, now the old shepherd of the
, Stanford flocks, delivered milk for the
Wildwood dairies. He must have had
"It" in abundance, for many a girl
risked discovery to get up at 5 a.m.
i and drive his rounds with him.
