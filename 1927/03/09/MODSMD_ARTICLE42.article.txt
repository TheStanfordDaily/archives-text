# BOTANIST HYBRIDIZES DECIDUOUS TREES IN CAMPUS EXPERIMENT
## 
### 
Crossing 350 deciduous fruit trees on
the University grounds is the work which
has been accomplished by W. F. Wight,
associate botanist of the United States
Department of Agriculture. Wight is
hybridizing different varieties of these
trees in an effort to find hardier and
better bearing specimens.
Much patience and earnest application
of the scientific method is required in
this work, declares Wight, who describes
the process Used. Before the blossoms
of a ccrtain tree open, a twig is selected.
The petals are removed from the blos
soms and the twig is covered with a paper
bag to prevent the pollen of the parent
tree from reaching the stamens on the
twig. The pollen of another tree is care
fully gathered and at the proper time is
placed on the stamens beneath the bag.
Two or three weeks later a gauze sack is
put on the twig in place of the paper
one. The fruit produced from these blos
soms is picked and the seeds planted in
moist sand for the winter. In the spring
when the seeds germinate they are planted
outside in regular soil. Careful records
are kept of the trees from their germi
nation to their full growth.
New Hybrids Tested
Those few that prove to be the best
are sent to regular orchards and there
arc given the final test. Fruit growers are
then notified of the new hybrids and thus
benefit by the work.
Wight was sent some years ago to
Argentina to work with the Argentine
department of agriculture inaugurating
for that division certain lines of botani
cal work as carried on by the United
States department.
Later lie went with an exploring party
for the federal government to the coast
of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. On this ex
pedition he collected many new varieties
of potatoes, eighty or ninety varieties of
beans, and many varieties of squashes,
corn, and wheat.

Wight carried on his investigations at the
government plant introduction gardens at
Cliico. The climate here is much better
for his work than it was there. Mr.
Roeding of the California Nursery Com
pany has placed his company's nursery
at Niles at Mr. Wight's disposal to aid
him in his work.
Wight graduated from Stanford in
1899 and took his bachelor of science
degree at Michigan. His work here is
not connected with the University; it is
entirely for the federal government.
Stanford supplies him with land and
water.

moist sand for the winter. In the spring
when the seeds germinate they are planted
outside in regular soil. Careful records
are kept of the trees from their germi
nation to their full growth.
New Hybrids Tested
Those few that prove to be the best
are sent to regular orchards and there
arc given the final test. Fruit growers are
then notified of the new hybrids and thus
benefit by the work.
Wight was sent some years ago to
Argentina to work with the Argentine
department of agriculture inaugurating
for that division certain lines of botani
cal work as carried on by the United
States department.
Later lie went with an exploring party
for the federal government to the coast
of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. On this ex
pedition he collected many new varieties
of potatoes, eighty or ninety varieties of
beans, and many varieties of squashes,
corn, and wheat.
Climate Factor
Before coming to Stanford in 1922.
Wight carried on his investigations at the
government plant introduction gardens at
Cliico. The climate here is much better
for his work than it was there. Mr.
Roeding of the California Nursery Com
pany has placed his company's nursery
at Niles at Mr. Wight's disposal to aid
him in his work.
Wight graduated from Stanford in
1899 and took his bachelor of science
degree at Michigan. His work here is
not connected with the University; it is
entirely for the federal government.
Stanford supplies him with land and
water.
Crossing 350 deciduous fruit trees on
the University grounds is the work which
has been accomplished by W. F. Wight,
associate botanist of the United States
Department of Agriculture. Wight is
hybridizing different varieties of these
trees in an effort to find hardier and
better bearing specimens.
Much patience and earnest application
of the scientific method is required in
this work, declares Wight, who describes
the process Used. Before the blossoms
of a ccrtain tree open, a twig is selected.
The petals are removed from the blos
soms and the twig is covered with a paper
bag to prevent the pollen of the parent
tree from reaching the stamens on the
twig. The pollen of another tree is care
fully gathered and at the proper time is
placed on the stamens beneath the bag.
Two or three weeks later a gauze sack is
put on the twig in place of the paper
one. The fruit produced from these blos
soms is picked and the seeds planted in
moist sand for the winter. In the spring
when the seeds germinate they are planted
outside in regular soil. Careful records
are kept of the trees from their germi
nation to their full growth.
