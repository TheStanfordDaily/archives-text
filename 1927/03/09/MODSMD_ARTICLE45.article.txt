# ART GALLERY SHOWS FORTY PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS BY PETERSEN
## Landscape, Human Figures, Portraits Form Part of Modern Collection 
### 
j Forty modern photographic prints of
i portraits, landscapes, and human figures
| are being exhibited in the Stanford Art
I Gallery until March 27. These photo
graphs are the work of Albert Petersen,
' who has his studio in San Mateo.
Light and shade contrasts are used in
j the portraits, which are well balanced in
! composition. Petersen aims, and with
I evident success, to portray soul as well
as the human likeness of the sitter in his
studies.
His landscapes combine a soft and
, atmospheric quality which gives a cer
tain charm to them. These include "Tele
graph Hill," "Through the Mist." "The
| Oak," and "Old Homestead." The vvdfk
; is remarkable for its artistic realism.
Petersen's studies of the human figure
J are unique and unusual. His arrange
ment of line and form is made to obtain
symetry in composition. This, as well as
! the expression of moods, appears to be
! the chief quality of these studies. Among
! these portraits arc "Aphrodite," "Har
mony," "Spirit of the Nile," "Remorse,"
| and "Genesis."
I The exhibitions at the Art Gallery are
i open daily from 10 o'clock the morn
j ing until 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
