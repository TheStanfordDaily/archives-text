# STANFORD INCREASES NUMBER OF COURSES THOUSAND PER CENT
## First Register Contained 97 On List; 559 Now Being Offered 
### 
Since Stanford first opened her portals
to those seeking higher education, there
has been over a thousand per cent in- j
crease in the number of courses offered
by its faculty. In the first Stanford regis
ter there were 97 courses offered to the
559 seekers who enrolled in the Univer- 1
sity. Today, when the student body num- i
bers 3185, the Announcement of Courses j
lists 1125 courses for the year 1926-27.
Within the last ten years alone, Stan
ford has increased her curriculum by
over 300 courses. The general tendency
has been to keep approximately the same
ratio between the number of courses in
each department under which the uni- |
versity began its existence.
Of the 1125 courses offered this year, j
over 500 are in the Science departments, ]
Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, etc. The j
Social Science group and the language 1
courses each number something over 280. i
The Law School curriculum totals iifty- I
seven.
