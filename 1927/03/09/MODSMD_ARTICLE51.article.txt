# CONSTRUCTION WORK ON LODGE DELAYED BY ADDED EXPENSE
## Error in Original Cost Due To Failure of Plans For Summer Camp 
### 
Construction of the Stanford Women's
Lodge at Searsville Lake will be inde
finitely delayed, it was announced last
night, because of the added expense of
water, lighting, and roads, items which
were not provided for by the original
budget.
The error in the original cost estimate
is due to the fact that Harry Maloney
will not establish his proposed summer
camp at Searsville, and it will therefore
be impossible for the Lodge to make use
of the road, lighting, and water systems j
which he would have furnished in return ;
for the use of the Lodge during the
summer.
The cost of putting in these features, j
is expected to amount to some $2000. j
Construction of the Lodge will not begin j
till nearly one-half of the entire budget I
has been raised. At the present time ,
the collection of the two dollar assess- j
ment on all women students is nearly!
completed, and contributions from alum- j
nae in response to letters sent out by the 1
board are being added to the fund.
A permanent Women's Lodge Com- i
mittee analagous to the Clubhouse Board
is now under consideration. It will be
composed of faculty members and resi
dent alumnae, as well as students, and
will take the place of the temporary
committee of live. Caroline Moore was
appointed last night to serve as chair
man of the present board until the pro
posed committee is established.
