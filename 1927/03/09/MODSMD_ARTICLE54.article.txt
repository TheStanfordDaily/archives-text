BEUKJOI-KY, March 7. —Beards! Big
| ones, long duos, bushy ones, strangly
| ones, black ones, red ones, stiff ones,
| sof tones, dlgnilled ones, flowing ones'
—all have invaded the University of
I California campus.
And why? Because the sophomore
! c lass at a recent meeting almost unani-;
I mously decided to cast aside their j
: razors for a period of twenty-nine days |
! preceding Sophomore Labor Day, |
j March 19, when the trails leading up j
!to the Big "C" on Charter Hill are !
I annually repaired.
Opposition Slight
A slight opposition to the proposal
was expressed by some men of the;
| class who could not grow beards and |
j others who found it necessary to main
, tain a neat appearance to retain their
, positions.
Barbers in the vicinity of the cam-1
pus are keeping shorter hours and
anxiously watching the calendar for
the termination of the twenty-nine-day
period. Moustache cups and spoons

have been removed from their places
among the family antiques and once
again are practically employed.
The "Thou Shalt Not Shave" man
; date has wreaked havoc on the varsity
basketball team that recently wrested
j the Pacific Coast basketball champion
j ship from Oregon University. Six
I members of ihe squad are sopho
| mores. They "have found it difficult to
keep their beavers from the grasps
: of their opponents.
Campus Affairs Neglected
Campus affairs have been sadly
neglected by the "twenty-niners." not
1 because they have lost, their interest
!in social activities but because the
; women have placed a social taboo
1 upon them.
The conc-eivers of the scheme hope
j to make it a campus tradition. Chal
! lenges will be issued to every sopho
| more class in the future, up to the
| "forty-niners." to grow their beards
for a number of days preceding Sopho
more Labor Day equal to their class
numerals.
