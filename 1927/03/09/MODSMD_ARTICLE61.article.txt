the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
"Largo" from the "New World" sym
phony by Dvorak, is another campus
favorite which will be on the program.
Among the lighter numbers are selec
tions by a saxophone ensemble and col
lege marches for encores.
Verdi's trio from "Attila" will be
played by a trio of brass instruments
with band accompaniment.
Nearly 100 musicians compose the
band. The concert will be open to -the
public.
