# WOMEN AT MINNESOTA ALLOW HAIR TO GROW
## 
### 
Thirty-five per cent of the women at
the University of Minnesota are let
ting their hair grow, tonsorial artists
stated in a recent interview in the
Minnesota Daily when queried about
women's influence on the barber
shops.
"The barber shop ain't what it used
to be," one barber declared. "Women
are more fussy about their hair cuts
than men, because they think they
ought to be. They always have more
instructions to give—like the prover
bial woman —but they are also more
pleased with the results than the men.
Few women know what they want
when they enter a hair-cutting parlor,
and most of them are willing to try
anything just because it is 'the style,'
regardless of whether it looks well on
their type or not."
