# YALE GRADUATES TO HOLD WORLD BANQUET
## 
### 
Thirty thousand Yale graduates have
been invited to a "round the world din
ner," to be held April 20 in 200 cities
throughout the world. The banquet is
planned by the Yale endowment commit
tee as the opening event in the general
campaign to raise $20,000 additional
funds for promoting distinction in teach
ing and study.
It is believed that the dinner will set a
record for alumni attendance at simul
taneous meetings in widely separated
places which has never hitherto been ap
proached by any university. Seven thou
sand men will be invited to attend the
sections of the banquet to be held in New
York City alone.
