"The University of Texas is neither a
winter resort, a country club, nor an
amusement park," says the Dean of
Women, in stating that there are certain
types of girls for whom the university
has no place.
"If the state of Texas were desirous
of furnishing her young people with any
of these amusements, it could be done
with far less expense than is involved in
providing excellent instruction and well
equipped buildings and laboratories. The
university is a place for work and de
velopment, not a place for play and
worthless amusement," she continued.
