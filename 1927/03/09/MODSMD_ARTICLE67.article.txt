### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
How often in sports do you hear the
admonition, "Keep your eye on the
ball!" In every game played with a
sphere that rule is placed first in im
portance by those who have reached
the top, yet is held especially neces
sary in the ancient pastime of golf.
What are you going to say then, when
Gene Sarazen up and shoots nine holes
in less than fifty strokes with a ban
dage over his optics?
Blind golf is no new stunt to our
English cousins, and putting matches
between blindfolded persons have fre
quently been played in the country
that produced John Ball, eight times
winner of the British amateur title
and certainly a golfer worth keeping
the eye 011! Major Towse, V.C., whose
eyes were shot out in the Boer war,
plays golf in spite of the terrific handi
cap of blindness. He touches the ball
with his hands before he plays it each
time, and his caddy rings a bell to
indicate the position of the hole. Mr.
Alfred Toogood, of Sunningdale, and
Mr. F. Millar, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
have played matches blindfolded in
England, also.
Keeping the eye on the ball is more
important, in my opinion, in games
like baseball and tennis, where the
ball is in motion when you hit it (or
miss it). The target that you are try
ing to knock for a loop is bigger than
a golf ball, but it is coming at you with
a tricky curve or da7zling speed, and
in tennis you are usually forced to hit
it when you are running at top speed.
Although Tilden advises all. begin
ners and tournament players alike, to

keep the eye on the ball all the time
it is in play, I have seen photos of
Long William serving that plainly
show him not looking at the ball as it
hits his racket strings. Maybe Bob
Meusel would not have made that
costly muff in the last world series if
he had kept his eyes more closely on
the ball, and not have let them wander
toward the spot to which he was about
to throw.
In a high school basketball game
played at Lockport. 111., several years
ago. a player lost his glas# eye during
the heat of battle, and the game was
stopped long enough for him to pick
it up off the floor and replace it. Then,
when the game began again, he calmly
shot the ball into the basket!

Blind golf is no new stunt to our
English cousins, and putting matches
between blindfolded persons have fre
quently been played in the country
that produced John Ball, eight times
winner of the British amateur title
and certainly a golfer worth keeping
the eye 011! Major Towse, V.C., whose
eyes were shot out in the Boer war,
plays golf in spite of the terrific handi
cap of blindness. He touches the ball
with his hands before he plays it each
time, and his caddy rings a bell to
indicate the position of the hole. Mr.
Alfred Toogood, of Sunningdale, and
Mr. F. Millar, of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
have played matches blindfolded in
England, also.
Keeping the eye on the ball is more
important, in my opinion, in games
like baseball and tennis, where the
ball is in motion when you hit it (or
miss it). The target that you are try
ing to knock for a loop is bigger than
a golf ball, but it is coming at you with
a tricky curve or da7zling speed, and
in tennis you are usually forced to hit
it when you are running at top speed.
Although Tilden advises all. begin
ners and tournament players alike, to

keep the eye on the ball all the time
it is in play, I have seen photos of
Long William serving that plainly
show him not looking at the ball as it
hits his racket strings. Maybe Bob
Meusel would not have made that
costly muff in the last world series if
he had kept his eyes more closely on
the ball, and not have let them wander
toward the spot to which he was about
to throw.
In a high school basketball game
played at Lockport. 111., several years
ago. a player lost his glas# eye during
the heat of battle, and the game was
stopped long enough for him to pick
it up off the floor and replace it. Then,
when the game began again, he calmly
shot the ball into the basket!


Eyes on the Ball!
How often in sports do you hear the
admonition, "Keep your eye on the
ball!" In every game played with a
sphere that rule is placed first in im
portance by those who have reached
the top, yet is held especially neces
sary in the ancient pastime of golf.
What are you going to say then, when
Gene Sarazen up and shoots nine holes
in less than fifty strokes with a ban
dage over his optics?
