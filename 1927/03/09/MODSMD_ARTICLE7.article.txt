# Creative Dancing Program Fulfills All Expectations
## 
### Hallie Keating 
The exhibition of creative dancing
given last night at the Assembly Hall
by the women's'physical education de
partment, and under the combined
auspices of the Public Exercises Com
mittee and W.A.A. fulfilled all the
promises and e.\nectations hold for it.
In spite of the handicap any such
program has in being presented in a
theatre instead of the open air, an
effect of beautiful co-ordination and
grace was successfully put over.
Randall Triumphs
Peggy Randall added again to her
list of campus successes, both in her
role as Intelligence in "Aries," and in
her two solos. The last, the moth danc
ing upon a ray of moonlight, was par
ticularly lovely.
Olga Spirito successfully interpreted
Primitive Man, and executed the diffi
cult solo and group work very credit
ably. On the face of it, the theory of
adaptation of primitive man to his
enviroment seems an unusual one to
interpret, in a creative dance program,
but as it was worked up, it offered
opportunities for group dancing, and
a few solos, that were met with very
fine results.
Flame Dance Startling
The Flame dance in the last part
gave a startling and beautiful effect.
The timing of the scarves produced an
uncanny and startling similarity to a
range fire.
Frances Boone, in the first part of
the program, proved again her ability
as a soloist in the Gypsy Dance, giving
a colorful and original interpretation
of an old theme. Kathleen Fitz's Bacha
nale was another rather original in
terpretation.
The second part of the program, the
group of whimsies, proved to be most
popular with the large audience. It
| was a pleasant novelty to find women
not afraid to take comic roles; and
i they did make a success of them.
Rig-a-jig, a folk-dance, drew the
most applause of the group. The dance
of the Pirate King with Betty Shively
and her crew of four bewhiskered
rogues demanded h good deal of ap
preciation for the clever pantomime.
Anne Mudge, as Felix, was a con
vincing soloist even though many wore
disappointed that no real and substan
tial mouse appeared in the hole in the
wall that Felix so carefully guarded.
The dance of the Three Dolls and
Pas de Troit were also successful and
particularly charming. The whimsy of
these proved to he an effective con
trast with the other numbers.
In fact, the whole program seemed
entertaining and interesting, well
chosen in variety, and well-done. May
there be bigger and better dance
dramas every year!

uncanny and startling similarity to a
range fire.
Frances Boone, in the first part of
the program, proved again her ability
as a soloist in the Gypsy Dance, giving
a colorful and original interpretation
of an old theme. Kathleen Fitz's Bacha
nale was another rather original in
terpretation.
The second part of the program, the
group of whimsies, proved to be most
popular with the large audience. It
| was a pleasant novelty to find women
not afraid to take comic roles; and
i they did make a success of them.
Rig-a-jig, a folk-dance, drew the
most applause of the group. The dance
of the Pirate King with Betty Shively
and her crew of four bewhiskered
rogues demanded h good deal of ap
preciation for the clever pantomime.
Anne Mudge, as Felix, was a con
vincing soloist even though many wore
disappointed that no real and substan
tial mouse appeared in the hole in the
wall that Felix so carefully guarded.
The dance of the Three Dolls and
Pas de Troit were also successful and
particularly charming. The whimsy of
these proved to he an effective con
trast with the other numbers.
In fact, the whole program seemed
entertaining and interesting, well
chosen in variety, and well-done. May
there be bigger and better dance
dramas every year!
The exhibition of creative dancing
given last night at the Assembly Hall
by the women's'physical education de
partment, and under the combined
auspices of the Public Exercises Com
mittee and W.A.A. fulfilled all the
promises and e.\nectations hold for it.
In spite of the handicap any such
program has in being presented in a
theatre instead of the open air, an
effect of beautiful co-ordination and
grace was successfully put over.
Randall Triumphs
Peggy Randall added again to her
list of campus successes, both in her
role as Intelligence in "Aries," and in
her two solos. The last, the moth danc
ing upon a ray of moonlight, was par
ticularly lovely.
Olga Spirito successfully interpreted
Primitive Man, and executed the diffi
cult solo and group work very credit
ably. On the face of it, the theory of
adaptation of primitive man to his
enviroment seems an unusual one to
interpret, in a creative dance program,
but as it was worked up, it offered
opportunities for group dancing, and
a few solos, that were met with very
fine results.
Flame Dance Startling
The Flame dance in the last part
gave a startling and beautiful effect.
The timing of the scarves produced an
uncanny and startling similarity to a
range fire.
