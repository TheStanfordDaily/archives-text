# JAKE IRWIN FINDS KERN HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS CARELESS
## 
### 
Jake Irwin, senior head sponsor in En
cina last year for the class of 1929, is
having trouble at the Kern County Union
High School with seniors failing to "fol
low directions in his public speaking
class.
Details of the disaster are furnished
Â»>y the Blue and White :
"Tt is truly amazing to find how many
of our seniors really lack the funda
mental knowledge that should have been
theirs long before they were ready to
graduate from high school. Mr. Irwin's
{second period public speaking class is
composed of a majority of seniors, some
juniors and a few sophomores. For two
days he drilled nliem on a list of words
that should be contained in every senior's
,vocabulary. For the third day, he told
tiicin to look up the words, learn their
definition, and turn in sentences using
each word. Out of the group of twenty-
Jive students it was found that only about
five used the words correctly! Many
showed no apparent knowledge of the
words at all, after having read a simple
definition.
"That does not, in my opinion, show
carelessness," said Jake Irwin, "but only
a highly developed sense of ignorance
.and unintelligence."
