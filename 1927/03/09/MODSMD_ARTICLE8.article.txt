# FRESHMEN TO FACE FRESNO TRACKSTERS IN FIRST APPEARANCE
## 
### 
Facing the Fresno State Teachers' Col
i lege squad on the track at 10 o'clock Sat
lurday morning, the 1930 track team will
[undertake its first competition of the
| year and incidentally give the campus a
iline on its ability, which is an uncertain
■ quantity at present. San Mateo Junior
j College was scheduled to compete on Sat-
I urday also, but have wired its inability
| to take part.
The freshmen are doped to win rather
I easily, but most of the events will prob
i ably be close. Fric Krenz, husky weight
heaver, is the only 1930 man conceded
certain victories. His marks in the discus
and shot will probably not be approached.
Morrison's performances in the inter
class meet and the Irish Marathon make
him the favorite in the 440, and Kings
bury looks good for victories in both the
sprints. Dowel 1 is a potential broad jump
winner. A number of other men are ex
pected to come through with good show
ings, but on the whole the freshman
squad is as yet an unproved aggregation.
Future freshman meets are still up in
the air, as the date for the Little Big
Meet has not been agreed upon and as a
consequence a number of contests are
only tentatively scheduled.
