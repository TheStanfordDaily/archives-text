# LACK OF JOBS MAKES MANY U.C. STUDENTS STOP COLLEGE WORK
## 
### 
University of California records show
that a large number of students who en
rolled on the Berkeley campus during the
past year have been forced to withdraw
from college with a consequent loss to
both themselves and the state, as a result
of failing to find part-time work, and of
not having had an "emergency fund to
cover expenses for the first year.
Mrs. Gaynard, manager of the Cali
fornia Bureau of Occupations, states that
employment is more scarce this year than
for some time past, in every branch of
work; and even full-time workers arc
experiencing great difficulty in finding
positions. She says,"It is advisable that
a freshman entering the University as a
stranger in the bay region, should have a
reserve fund to tide him or her over until
a place can be obtained. It is doubly diffi
cult fur students without friends or con
nections to obtain positions when stu
dents living in the vicinity of the campus
have trouble finding work.
"If a reserve fund is not obtainable
on graduation from high school it would
better to May out a year and save, than
to come to Berkeley and later find it im
possible to live. For those students who
feel that a break in their schooling would
perhaps keep them from obtaining a col
lege education, it would be better to try
to arrange a loan sufficient to carry them
over the first year.
"Statistics compiled by the University
show that a minimum of $60 a month
is required for living expenses while at
tending college in addition to entrance
fees. Students should not try to work
more than four hours a day outside of
college, while taking a full course of
study."
