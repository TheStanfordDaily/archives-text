### 
"Thirty-five per cent of the students
at the University of Minnecota are actu
ally lacking in ability to meet the present
requirements for promotion and gradua
tion," J. B. Johnston, Dean of the Aca
demic Colleges, has reported. "During
the last ten years it has been found that
30 per cent of the freshmen leave col
lege during or at the end of the first
year, and 20 per cent do not stay beyond
the sophomore year."
Forty-three per cent of the 10 per cent
of the high school men with the highest
grades come to college; and among the
women of the same class 34 per cent
come to college. The report also states
that more boys come to college from the
lowest rank of the high school classes
than from the highest. For both boys
and girls the college entrants are in a
slight degree selected from the upper
scholastic levels.
