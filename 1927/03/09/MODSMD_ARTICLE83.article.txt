# MOSE LAUDS CULTURE, MORALITY OF "ROUGH"
## 
### 
"The culture and morality of the
Stanford rough gets better year by
year," stated Mose, second-hand
clothes dealer of twenty years' stand
ing about the campus, a few days ago.
"It must be the climate that inspires
these students to do their best," he
added.
Mose received his nickname (which
in full is Mose in the Bull Rushes)
during his stay at Yale where he en
gaged in the same type of business
for thirty years. The origin of the
appellation is surrounded in a haze
of mystery. Mose himself can't tell
whence it came.
Mose has seen all the college fads
come and go. Peg-top pants, plug-ugly
derbies, insufferable rough-neck sweat
ers, and now slickers and leather coats
have passed through his store.
"The rough is becoming less rough,"
said Mose. "Nowadays he absolutely
must have a tuxedo. I have many calls
for tuxes. Nor will he have anything
but the very latest. Students sell more
than they buy."
