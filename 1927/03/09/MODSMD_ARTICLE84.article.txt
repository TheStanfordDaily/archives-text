# Safety Engineers Needed By State Says Professor
## 
### 
If there were a means of training safety
engineers to send into the industrial acti
vities of the state, such education would
contribute one of the most effective means
of decreasing loss of life and limb through
industrial accidents, according to W. J.
Fretich, instructor in labor economics at
the University of California, editor of
various industrial publications, and head
of the State Industrial Accident Commis
sion from 1919 to 1924.
"Great benefits would be derived by the
state from such a course, because men
scientifically trained in the fise of latest
safety devices would be available to large
industrial plants," he says. " 1 hese engi
neers would eventually work into key
positions where their relation to the cor
poration in its entirety would make it
possible for them to direct a unified safety
campaign throughout all departments
without waste from lark of organization
or failure in co-operation."
