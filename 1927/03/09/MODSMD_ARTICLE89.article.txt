# FOOD RESEARCH INSTITUTE INVESTIGATES RELIEF BILL
## 
### 
Showing that the McNary-Haugen,
farm relief bill, to create a board to
market the surplus of American-grown
wheat, would shortly result in a condi
tion more detrimental to wheat prices
than present conditions, a report of ex
perts at the Stanford Food Research
Institute, issued in advance of the presi
dential veto, showed approval of the
President's action.
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, Director of the
Food Research Institute, declared that
operation of the wheat board would re
sult in an expansion of wheat acreage
in proportion to the success of the board,
and in a few years a "painful contrac
tion" of acreage would be necessary.
This would defeat the aims of the bill.
Analyze Proposals
Dr. Taylor said: "We have endeav
ored to analyze the proposals fairly, to
assume intelligent, able, and earnest ef
forts to carry them into effect, ami to
consider how the difficulties might be
met.
"We conclude that although successful
operation cannot be prophesied, the
scheme could be made to work; but that
its net outcome within a few years would
be to the serious disadvantage of wheat
growers and would create fresh malad
justments in American agriculture.
Painful Readjustment
"The greater the early success of the
measure, the greater would be the pros
pect of its ultimate failure to achieve the
results desired by the growers, and the
necessity of a painful readjustment after
the disappointment was recognized and
admitted."
Four principal sources of danger of a
direct breakdown of the scheme that
were pointed out by Dr. Taylor are:
"First, there is the possibility that the
board could not secure competent techni
cal organization and managerial super
ability, corresponding to the magnitude :
of the operations which, on account of
regional differences in wheat growing,
would present peculiar difficulties.
Unsalable Surplus
"Second, there is a possibility that the
board would be swamped with a large
and relatively unsaleable surplus in a
year of coincidences of a large domestic
crop with a large world crop and low
wheat prices.
"Tl.lrd, there is the possibility that
several years of successive large crops
and low prices might so magnify the
carry-over and losses on exports, and so

I increase the difficulty of collecting the
equilization fees from the farmers, as to
; break the board under the burden of
| carrying charges and frozen purchases.
Growers' Confidence
"Finally, there is the danger from va
cillation in the board's policy, withdrawal
of political support from congress, and
collapse of the growers' confidence in
the undertaking."
The report criticized the "political ele
| ments" in the bill, pointing out that "as
I presented to the President, the bill has
J the appearance of a 'shotgun prescrip
tion' with three separate types of active
operations: (1) segregation of exports
with the use of the equalization fee; (2)
co-operatives to effect orderly market
ing and stabilize prices; (3) price insur
ance under governmental guaranty,
i "One is led to wonder whether the in
i elusion of three diverse remedies within
j one bill was the result of conviction that
I three diverse kinds of agricultural dis
tress called for three separate or alter
native remedies, or represented merely
an act of expediency reconciling diverse
political elements.
"One can hardly escape the conclusion
that political considerations were effec
tive in securing the passage of a bill
bearing the name that has been conjured
with, regardless of how it might work,
and even at the expense of essential fea
(tures of the plan previously endorsed by
| farm organizations."
