# Two Sports Only Will Be Permitted Idaho Athletes
## 
### 
Participation in varsity intercollegi
j ate athletics will be limited to two
sports in the future at the University
of Idaho, according to a dictum handed
j down by Coach Charlie Erb. The new
j ruling will become effective next Sep
i tember.
Men who are allowed to have a free
hand in athletic participation often go
beyond their physical and mental limit
and are on the "ragged edge" at gradu
ation, is the reason given by Coach
Erb for his action. Men with extraor
dinary physiques and above the aver
i age mental capacity will be allowed to
i take part in more than two branches.
