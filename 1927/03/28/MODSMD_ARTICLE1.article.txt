# OF DRAMATIST HERE TONIGHT
## Ruth Draper Is a Whole Theatre in Herself, Says Director USES FEW PROPERTIES Plays a Dozen Characters in Single Skit; Writes Sketches Herself 
### Margaret Cummings 
"Ruth Draper is a whole theatre in
herself" is the characterization Gor
don Davis, dramatic director, gives to
the actress who is to appear in a
program of character sketches in the
Assembly Hall at 8:15 this evening.
Her program, which will be over by
10 o'clock so students can attend the
Registration dance, will include seven
sketches of her own composition.
The artist has appeared in most of
the large cities of the United States
and in many of the capitols of Europe.
Always, either at home or abroad, she
is received with more than cordial
accalim as 'an artist of remarkable
gifts and one whose portrayals are of
infinite and convincing variety.
Material Unique
That an actress, with only a shawl,
chair, and table as properties, can
hold immensely critical audiences for
almost three hours, indicates very
positively that Ruth Draper's reputa
tion is well sustained. Her material is
collected from bits of life from every
where, an dis unique and entertaining
to a high degree.
Her uncanny to make her
audiences live the scenes she brings
before them has proved her distin
guishing feature. She is the author of
all the sketches she presents, and
includes as many as a dozen different
characters in a single skit. Since she
is first of all a realist, these sketches
offer a surprising range of emotional
grasp from the frivolous comedy
touches to the more seriously dra
matic.
Mimicry Praised
Many critics, in commenting on
Rui.li Draper's gift for mimicry and
her many-sided talents, have expressed
wonder that she does not identify her
self with a regular play. Her achieve
ments as a free lance, however, have
completely justified her stand for in
dependence, and her entire success
with all discriminating audiences has
proved the popularity of her unique
art.
The program this evening will be
presented in three divisions, with the
first part including "A French Dress
maker," "Three Generations in a Court

of Domestic Relations." and"A Debu
tante." The next will tie comedy sKxts,
dren's Party in Philadelphia." "At an
and is also in three parts, "At a Chil-
Art Exhibition," and "In a Country
Kerry." The last is "a single number,
intensely dramatic, entitled "In a Rail
way Station on the Western Plains."
