# JOURNALISTS HAVE CHANCE FOR POST WITH DAILY STAFF
## Tryoutees Meet Wednesday At 12:45; Trials Will Last Six Weeks 
### 
Tryoutees for the editorial staff of
the Stanford Daily will meet Wednes
day at 12:45 o'clock in the newspaper
office next to the Press building.
Freshmen and sophomores, interested
in journalistic work, are particularly
desired.
The aspiring newspaper men and
women will have an actual part in
publishing the paper. Their work will
cover a period of probably six weeks
and will consist of regular assign
ments and the writing of dummy
stories to test their ability.
Quality Essential
Advancement on the staff will be
controlled by the quality of the work
done and the interest shown in the
paper.
Previous experience in journalistic
work on a high school or junior col
lege paper is not necessary as the
aspirants will be given an opportunity
to learn some of the fundamentals of
newspaper writing. Those who have
had such experience, however, will
find in the Daily a chance to follow
up such work.
News Beats Assigned
Those trying out will be assigned to
definite news beats which they will be
expected to cover. They will be thrown
on their own devices in securing and
writing the desired information.
The trvouts will be under the direc
tion of Fred Speers, managing editor,
who points out that through experi
ence on the Stanford Daily students
learn of the workings of the Univer
sity and become better acquainted
with the various phases of student
activities and the University adminis
tration.
