# FRESHMAN BASEBALL MEN WIN ALL GAMES OF VACATION SERIES
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball nine won
its three games played during the past
week, defeating teams from San Jose
High School, 8-2; San Mateo Junior Col
lege, 10-8; and Berkeley High School, 6-1.
These victories, in the opinion of the
Babe mentor, Coach Husky Hunt, show
that the Cardinal yearlings have a well
rounded and strong team. The main han
dicap is that only eleven men are eligible
for practice, the others having failed to
pass the required work.
Hunt Optimistic
Simkins showed up particularly well on
the mound position in the San Jose High
School and Berkeley games. Levernz
was used in the San Mateo Junior Col
lege contest.
Giving Simkins and Levernz good sup
port in all the games were Berg, first
base, and Laird, third base. Both these
boys are good hitters and their playing
ability is outstanding. Storey, second
base, is also a dependable hitter but he
lias a habit of muffing the ball.
The line-up in the three games follows;
Levernz and Simkins, pitchers; Sparks
and McCoy, catchers; Berg, first base;
Storey, second base; Laird, third base;
Bianchi, short-Stop; Murphy, left field;
Levin, center field; Pease, right field.
Coach Hunt looks with favor on the
outcome of the California freshman ser
ies, early in April? on the showing made
by his prodigies so far this season. He
thinks that the Babes should have one of
the best teams this year that they have
had since he started coaching at Stanford.
