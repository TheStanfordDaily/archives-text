Stanford Upsets Dope
The Stanford squad furnished a big
upset by winning the L.A.A.C. meet
last Thursday by a margin of 11 points,
and at the same time convinced South
ern California fans of its worth. By
winning the pole vault, high hurdles,
220-yard dash and discus, Stanford
garnered the extra points needed to
come out on top. Ward Edmonds fur
nished the biggest surprise of the day
by his performance in the pole vault.
He soared over the bar at 13 feet, de
feating Glenn Graham, who placed
second in the 1924 Olympic Games,
Harry Smith, former national cham
pion, and Ralph Smith, who has a rec
ord of 13 feet 5 inches. The perform
ance was particularly noteworthy
sincte the Stanford sophomore has
never gone beyond 12 feet 6 inches in
previous competition.
