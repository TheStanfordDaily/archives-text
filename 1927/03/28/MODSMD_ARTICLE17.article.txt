## Field Events Furnish Most Points; Weak in Long Distance Runs SPENCER SETS RECORD Cards Upset Dope in Meet Against Los Angeles Club Thursday 
### 
With three decisive victories over
Hollywood Athletic Club, Olympic
Club, and Los Angeles Athletic Club
to its credit, the Stanford track team
will go into its first conference meet
with U.S.C. on Saturday a favorite to
win top honors. Cardinal prospects for
the season are extremely bright, if a
comparison of points is of any value.
Here they are:
Stanford 103

Stanford Upsets Dope
The Stanford squad furnished a big
upset by winning the L.A.A.C. meet
last Thursday by a margin of 11 points,
and at the same time convinced South
ern California fans of its worth. By
winning the pole vault, high hurdles,
220-yard dash and discus, Stanford
garnered the extra points needed to
come out on top. Ward Edmonds fur
nished the biggest surprise of the day
by his performance in the pole vault.
He soared over the bar at 13 feet, de
feating Glenn Graham, who placed
second in the 1924 Olympic Games,
Harry Smith, former national cham
pion, and Ralph Smith, who has a rec
ord of 13 feet 5 inches. The perform
ance was particularly noteworthy
sincte the Stanford sophomore has
never gone beyond 12 feet 6 inches in
previous competition.
Riehman finished about two and a !
half yards behind Paddock in the 220-!
yard dash, being clocked at 22 1-5 sec- i
onds, beating out Hugh Pinney, on ,
whom the Club had depended for an
easy second. Nichols nipped Bob Max
well at the tape by inches in the high j
hurdles in 14 4-5 seconds, thereby fur-J
nisliing another upset. Hoffman's !
throw fo 142 feet 8% inches in the ;
discus beat out Ed Moeller, whose rec-1
ord this year favored him to win the j
I event.
King's jump of 6 feet GVi inches and
Dyer's leap of 23 feet 4% inches were
the outstanding performances in the !
Olympic Club meet, which gave Stan-j
ford the opportunity of running up 103 |
points to 28 for the Clubmen. West's
time of 24 1-5 in the low hurdles was
also noteworthy.
Bud Spencer's 48 1-5 in the 440 in
the Hollywood meet served to better !
Ted Miller's Pacific Coast Conference ,
record and furnished the fans with
the biggest thrill of the contest, which '
Stanford won S6V£ to 44 1 / &. Nichols j
ran a spectacular race in the high hur-;
dies, making the time of 14 4-5. Har-!
low's toss of 201 feet 5 inches to win j
the javelin brought the crowd to its 1
i feet. Kiug won the high jump, as was
expected, but the big surprise in the
event was Bryant's second. Hoffman's
shotput of 49 feet 1 1-8 inches was !
too much for Houser, but the latter I
beat Out the football star in the discus, j
In the distance runs the Cards are j
| weak, but make up for this deficiency i
ion the track by their supremacy in I
I the hurdles and 440.. Nichols and West j
j have been turning in consistent per- j
! formances in the former, and Bud
I Spencer is hard to beat in the middle
i distance race. His worst time in this
! event in competition was 49 3-5, and
1 no Pacific Coa3t man has beaten him
:
i yet.
Stanford's real strength is in the
j field events, as is demonstrated by the
! fact that they garnered 45 out of a
I possible 54 points in the field in the
j Olympic Club meet, 40 in the L.A.A.C.
j contest, and 41 against H.A.C.
