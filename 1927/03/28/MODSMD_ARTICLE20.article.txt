# Titles Earnedâ€”Not Won

While'the majority of the students at Stanford were spending last
week enjoying themselves, and forgetting about the worries of college
life, others were working for the University. As a result Stanford has
been in the headlines of newspapers about the country on many occasions.

Team,
Each season for some years past Stanford has been said to have had
the best track team in the University's history. And once again this year
Stanford has what appears to be the best track team of all times. People
who are interested in the "whys" of the things are asking the reasons for
these successions of championship track squads. The California climate,
of course, comes in for a share of the credit. To be able to practice in the
open, with the sun as a trainer, is an important "why," but not the most
important.
The wealth of material that has graced the Stanford track is another
explanation for Coast championships in track. But few athletes are great
without the aid of a coach. Few boxers ever attain distinction without a
coach and trainer. Few baseball players are born great fielders or hitters.
Few football men can carry the ball correctly, tackle right, or punt accu
rately until they are under the supervision of a good director. And track
is not different from other sports in that respect.
Coach Dink Templeton of Stanford might have received the small
end of the credit if it were not for his repeated victories. Such outstand
ing successes do not just happen; they are the result of careful coaching,
and supervision.
To be more specific, Spencer was a hurdler until Templeton saw the
possibility of a record breaking quarter miler in his stride. Captain Bab
cock was a sprinter until the coach transformed him into a 440 man.
McKinnon used to run the half mile; he's a miler now. Richmond ran
the 440 in his freshman year; Templeton changed him to a distance run
ner the following year, and now this season he has been changed into a
sprinter, and his close second to Paddock last week in the 220-yard dash
has made him the sensation of the squad.
Templeton developed Hartranft, Hoffman, King, Work, Harlow,
West, Leistner, and many other world champs. Stanford has seldom been
favored with remarkable freshman stars, but Templeton has coached
mediocre men into the best the country can produce.
The Daily will not mention anything about Templeton being the
youngest track coach in America, because that has been said too often.
Nor will we go into the details of his ability as an athlete as well as an
athletic trainer. Nothing will be said about Templeton competing in the
Olympic Games. And we are not going to tell our readers about the
famous "educated toe" that he possesses. All these things a Stanford
student, at least, should have heard about many times before.

mediocre men into the best the country can produce.
The Daily will not mention anything about Templeton being the
youngest track coach in America, because that has been said too often.
Nor will we go into the details of his ability as an athlete as well as an
athletic trainer. Nothing will be said about Templeton competing in the
Olympic Games. And we are not going to tell our readers about the
famous "educated toe" that he possesses. All these things a Stanford
student, at least, should have heard about many times before.
While'the majority of the students at Stanford were spending last
week enjoying themselves, and forgetting about the worries of college
life, others were working for the University. As a result Stanford has
been in the headlines of newspapers about the country on many occasions.

Team,
Each season for some years past Stanford has been said to have had
the best track team in the University's history. And once again this year
Stanford has what appears to be the best track team of all times. People
who are interested in the "whys" of the things are asking the reasons for
these successions of championship track squads. The California climate,
of course, comes in for a share of the credit. To be able to practice in the
open, with the sun as a trainer, is an important "why," but not the most
important.
The wealth of material that has graced the Stanford track is another
explanation for Coast championships in track. But few athletes are great
without the aid of a coach. Few boxers ever attain distinction without a
coach and trainer. Few baseball players are born great fielders or hitters.
Few football men can carry the ball correctly, tackle right, or punt accu
rately until they are under the supervision of a good director. And track
is not different from other sports in that respect.
Coach Dink Templeton of Stanford might have received the small
end of the credit if it were not for his repeated victories. Such outstand
ing successes do not just happen; they are the result of careful coaching,
and supervision.
To be more specific, Spencer was a hurdler until Templeton saw the
possibility of a record breaking quarter miler in his stride. Captain Bab
cock was a sprinter until the coach transformed him into a 440 man.
McKinnon used to run the half mile; he's a miler now. Richmond ran
the 440 in his freshman year; Templeton changed him to a distance run
ner the following year, and now this season he has been changed into a
sprinter, and his close second to Paddock last week in the 220-yard dash
has made him the sensation of the squad.
Templeton developed Hartranft, Hoffman, King, Work, Harlow,
West, Leistner, and many other world champs. Stanford has seldom been
favored with remarkable freshman stars, but Templeton has coached
mediocre men into the best the country can produce.
