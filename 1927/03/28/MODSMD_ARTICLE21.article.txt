'The Daily was unable to run cross word puzzles when that type of
amusement was in vogue, because of the expense of setting the puzzles.
The latest craze, is a feature called "Ask Me Another." It consists of
questions on history, geography, sports, mythology, and any other pos
sible subjects for which short answers can be supplied. The Daily is able
to supply its readers with such a feature, and the first of a series appears
in today's issue. The questions are original, and are not copied from any
"Ask Me Another" book.
Any student who would like to try his skill at asking questions may
submit ten questions with the answers attached and if they are suitable
they will be published. Professors are not barred from sending in
questions.
If this new feature proves a success, it will be continued for the
remainder of the quarter. If it does not meet with campus favor, it will
be stopped. This is merely a trial. But, remember, it is not connected
with the Intelligence Test.
