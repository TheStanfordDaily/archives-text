A YOUNG MAN'S FANCY
Rain or no rain, there is something
demoralizing about the Stanford cam
pus in spring. The fragrant air and
the fresh, green grass make it very,
very hard to keep one's mind on the
race.
If you don't believe it, think back
upon those resolutions you made dur
ing the first thirty minutes after leav
ing the family this vacation. Then
look around at the landscape and con
sider hat fat chance there is that
you'll keep any of them.
There are no two ways about it —the
man who chose this campus had a
great eye for country club sites, and
little sympathy for the scholarship
committee.

AT HOME
It is odd, but true, that the further
you get from the campus the stronger
is the tie that binds Stanford students
together. The same man who passes
you here with a far-away look wil
leap half way across the room to give

! you the glad hand when you meet him
back in the home town.
There is little or no hypocrisy be
hind this salient fact. The truth of
the matter is that here, where every
one is a Stanford student, there is no
cause for excitement in meeting one.
But back home in a crowd of assorted
clothing salesmen, bond brokers, and
what have you, a Stanford man looks
like a brother in the blood.
A DISCORD
In the interests of emotional har
mony something should be done about
j that matter of making the quarterly
j gouge simultaneously with the greet
ing of all the good old friends.
i Just as you are giving way. to that
: sentimental glow stimulated by a
round of handshaking in the Adminis
tration building, your eyes raise. And
what do you see? What do you see,
I gentle reader?
• You see that garish sign, "Make
Checks Payable to Stanford University
Before Coming To Window."
