# CARDINAL POLO FOUR DEFEATS ARMY TEAM IN PRACTICE CONTEST
## 
### 
Playing their first game since the
Christmas recess, the Stanford polo
team decisively defeated the 76th Field
Artillery team of the Monterey Pre
sidio. 9 to 1, on Saturday. The army
scored only in the last minute of play.
The game was hotly contested, but
at no time was the Stanford team in
danger of losing. The opposing quartet
was handicapped by the use of strange
mounts, both teams using the military
department ponies.
Captain Fred Trotter, playing num
ber four position, and Kenneth Brown,
number two, were the outstanding per
formers for the varsity. Lieutenant
Barden made the score for the Pre
sidio poloists.
The line-ups follow:
Stanford 76th Artillery
No. 1 Frank Rothrock Lt. McNair
No. 2 Kenneth Brown Lt. Barden
No. 3 C.O.Thompson Lt. Slocum
No. 4. Fred Trotter (c) Lt. King
