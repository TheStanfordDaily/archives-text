# EARLY ADVERTISING FORMS EXHIBITED IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY'S SHOW CASES
## 
### 
Perhaps one of the earliest forms of
J advertising is found in various of the
old Danish town seals now on display
in the Library. These seals, made of
red or black wax, bear in each case
some engraving emblematic of the
town to which they belong, and it was
particularly characteristic of seaport
towns to call attention to the fact of
their location by portraying ships or
the sea in their seals.
Of all shapes and sizes, the seals
date from 1220 to within a hundred
| years of the present time. Beginning
with comparatively plain and crude
pictures, the designs became increas- |
ingly elaborate and the execution more
and more skillful, until some of the
seals show remarkable workmanship.
Emblems Shown
The smaller seals are in the main
those of private families, and on these
the family emblem is represented in
full. This has two parts, the escutcheon
and the crest, which bears a heraldic
figure in keeping with the other de
sign. In some of these the family em
blems of both husband and wife are
joined in a double escutcheon. Counts
and barons signified their rank by !
larger and more elaborate designs, and !
on the baronial seals especially the
crests were replaced by crowns of
five, seven, or nine points.
Guilds Represented
Craftsmen's guilds, covering a period
from 1450 to IS3O, are represented in
the collection. These guilds, which
were an important part of medieval
life, providing standards of suitable
social life as well as of workmanship, |
usually bear their particular tools of
trade, as firetongs for the smith, and j

cleaver or ax for the butcher.
Ecclesiastical seals contrast with
the others in being typically elliptical
or oval. The cuts on these are usually
of bishops or religious figures, and
some of the seals show great original
ity and intricacy of design. Slate and
royal seals were always a great deal
larger and more imposing than any
others. Paper-covered seals were used
on documents of small importance,
while the seals affixed to international
treaties were sometimes encased in
capsules of gold, silver, or carved
wood.
Some of the most interesting of the
royal seals in the display are those
j belonging to well-known historical fig
ures. One large red seal with a long
i Latin inscription was that of Frederick
IV of Denmark. A smaller oval red
one, bearing a crown and his initials,
and mounted on sheepskin with four
blue silk tassels, was the private seal
of Louis Philippe of France. Queen
Victoria's private seal, and that of
the Empress Dagmar of Russia are
also shown.
Jacobsen Owner
This display, which is the property
'of L. S. Jacobsen, and was collected
by him in Denmark some years ago,
includes representative seals secured
from public and private archives, from
I old family letters, from legal docu
ments, and from the files of organiza
tions that had used them in former
| times.
Formerly an important distinguish
ing mark, the seal has fallen more and
more into disuse, until at the present
time it is usually found only upon
legal documents.
