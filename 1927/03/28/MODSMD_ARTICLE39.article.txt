# GORDON HALL CHOSEN MUSICAL DIRECTOR OF 1928 JUNIOR OPERA
## 
### 
Gordon Hall, who was in charge of
the music for the last football show,
will be musical director for the 192S
Junior Opera. The dramatic end of
the production will be under the super
vision of Gordon Davis for the first
time in some years. Davis has regu
larly taken his annual eastern trip
during the spring quarter, but his post
ponement of the journey until the
summer quarter in 1927 makes him
available for the direction of the opera.
R. Frank Baker and Winston Nor
man, both members of the Class of
1928, are writing the book for the
opera, which promises to be a change
from the type of play that has been
given recently, as it breaks away from
the costume drama which has become
almost traditional for junior operas.
The authors of the 1928 opera are
relying more on the inherent interest
of their plot and on the play itself
rather than upon the appeal made by j
bizarre costume and settings.
