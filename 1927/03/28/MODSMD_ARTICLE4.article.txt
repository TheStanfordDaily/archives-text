# QUESTIONNAIRE SHOWS STUDENTS WANT MORE NEWS FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES
## Society News Would Be Unpopular, According to Survey Made by Members of Journalism Department Class 
### 
What does the Public want?
More news of other colleges in the
Stanford Daily for one thing, according
to a 375-student cross-section of the Stan
ford University "Public" interviewed by
members of a journalism department
class.
But a column of "society news" in the
Daily would be unpopular with the stu
dents. The sororities, curiously, are most
opposed to having campus parties written
up and guest lists published. The frater
nities are adverse, but not so strenuously,
and among the Hall men, one in three
would welcome a society column if it were
established.
All the regular departments in the
Daily were put in the stocks for receipt
of eggs and bouquets from the students
interviewed. Seven out of every nine
claim they faithfully read the editorials
and almost the same proportion approve
the "Bull Session" column. "Cabbages"
is liked best, peculiarly, by the sororities,
who gave the feature an eight to one
vote. The Halls approve. The fraterni-

I ties, however, dislike the column in the
ratio of nine to seven.
Most departments as at present con
ducted seem very satisfactory to the stu
dents. By a large majority, the same
proportion of sport news as now was
asked. Feg Murray is popular, particu
larly among the men. The proportion of
j .space now devoted to "women's news"
; was voted satisfactory, a minority of the
Row and Hall men asking for less and
one women in three questioned asking for
more. Continuation of the Campus Opin
ion column was urged almost unani
mously. .
Only one student in every thirteen
questioned consistently reads the Palo
I Alto Times. Less than one in three read
any Sail Francisco newspaper. Of 128
; women queried, about half read no news
| paper, although ninety expressed a desire
| for non-collegiate news in the Daily.
"Fairly well," is how most students
read the Daily, if all were candid to the
Jquizzers, and more profess to read it
thoroughly than only glance at the staff's
| diurnal pride.
