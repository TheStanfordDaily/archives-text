# U.C.L.A. DEAN SHOWS WORKING STUDENTS MAKE BEST GRADES
## 
### 
Students working their way through
the University of California at Los
lAngeles make better grades than those
who look to father for their money.
This is the conclusion of Earl J. Miller,
Dean of Men, as the result of a sur
vey he has just completed.
The study disclosed that of the 1954
men enrolled at the University, almost
three-fourths, or 1348, are working
their way through the University.
Their grades, the analysis revealed
further, are definitely better than
Ihose of the students who do not have
io work for their education.
As shown in the tables compiled by
Dean Miller, the average grade of all
fhe working students stands at 1.22.
In this group are 606 students who
work four or more hours daily. Their
Krade corresponds exactly to that of
the entire group.
The average grade of those students
working but two to four hours a day
is slightly higher, standing at 1.23.
This is just three points better than
tUe average grade of all non-working
ntudents, which is 1.20.
In the matter of dismissal from the
University for deficient scholarship,
Ihe survey also gives the advantage
to the partly or wholly self-supporting
Htudents. Out of the group of 606 men
working four or more hours a day, a
total of seventy, or 11 per cent, were
dismissed for failure to keep up with
the high scholastic requirements de
manded by the university. Only 9 per
cent of the students working two to
four hours a day were dismissed for
this reason, however.
But of the 606 male students who
clo not work, seventy-five, or 12 per
cent, found themselves dismissed from
the university for deficient scholar
ship.
The average grade of all male stu
dents, as computed by Dean Miller,
was found to be 1.21 and the only
group found to fall below this average
were the 505 fraternity men included
in the survey.
