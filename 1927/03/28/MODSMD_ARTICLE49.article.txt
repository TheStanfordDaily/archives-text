# THE
						MISSING TOUCH OF COLOR

### Feg Murray 
Dempsey! A name to conjure with.
More popular now in defeat than he
ever was as champion. Hundreds and
thousands of fight fans are eagerly
waiting his return to the ring. Every
word about his ailments, his training,
his proposed comeback, is eagerly read
by a million or so people. Why is it?
There are two reasons.
First, Dempsey always was a color
ful fighter, a two-fisted, hard-hitting
killer, who seldom disappointed those
who had paid to see him perform. He
was just what the average immortal
imagined the heavyweight champion
should be —a likable, boyish Hercules,
who, when he once entered the ring,

became imbued with a neolithic frenzy j
to batter his opponent senseless in as !
j short a time as possible. I am writ-!
ing of the Dempsey of 1918 and 1919,'
who knocked out twenty-three men, J
seventeen of them in the first round.'
There is no such fighting machine in ;
the heavyweight ranks today, and the |
crowd yearns for an annihilator to
come along, to break up the monotony!
| of the Maloney-Delaney-Sharkey-Mc-j

Tigue bouts.
Secondly, Dempsey lost his title
without being knocked out, with many
plausible alibis (none of which he ad
vanced himself), and to a man who is
as different from the average concep
tion of a heavyweight champion as
night is from day. Tunney is not a
popular champion. Neither was Demp
sey, but he is popular now, and how
the neighbors' children would turn out

i
j to see him in the ring once more!
Not to see him fight Tunney again !
j right off thebbathet —the public will stand
j for a lot, but I doubt if it would stand
i for that —but to see him fight and
! eliminate a Paolina, a Sharkey, or a
Maloney. How he would draw the ,
crowds! Tex Rickard knows that bet
ter than anyone. Dempsey knows it
| too. The old battle lust is in him still
I in spite of the years of soft living and
movie surroundings.
Bring him on again, I say. Let's see j
the Dempsey of old, minus law suits, '
I mosquito bites, high hats, and yes-men.
j Put some pepper in this elimination
! tournament!
