# LABORATORY REPORTS PLATINUM ROBBERIES
## 
### 
Platinum thefts to the value of some
hundreds of dollars have occurred re
cently in the Department of Mining and
ctallurgy at the University. The thefts,
which have continued for some time, cul
minated last week with the loss of two
platinum crucibles, each worth seventy
dolLirs.
The crucibles were taken from an
oven in which they had been bidden to
cool before being put back into the safe
where they are usually kept.
Owing to the fact that it was hoped to
tract- the crucibles to San Francisco pawn
shops without having the thefts made
public, the case was not given out until
some days after they bad occurred. As
yet, the thief has not been apprehended.
