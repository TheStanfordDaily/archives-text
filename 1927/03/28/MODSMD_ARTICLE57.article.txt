his leadership this prison trust has
finally been raised.
A complete method of disbursing the I
money has been definitely worked out. I

Headquarters where the men may

they are sent to homes furnished in a
clean and respectable fashion, in pleas

different firms to give men employ
ment on their release on parole, thus
facilitating the work of the State
Board of Prison Directors in paroling
prisoners.
