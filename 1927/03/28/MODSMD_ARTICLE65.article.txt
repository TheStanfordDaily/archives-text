# CORNELL COACH BARES 18TH CENTURY MARVEL GLASGOW WONDER MADE 8 O'CLOCK IN 12 FLAT WAS SCHOOL'S HOPE; BUT FLOPPED AT CRISIS

### 
Explaining the origin of the first in
tercollegiate track meet, John R.
Bangs, assistant truck coach at Cor
nell, recently gave his version of the
beginning of university competition on
the cinder track.
"In the year 1750," said Bangs,
"Edinburgh and Glasgow, the two
great universities of Scotland, were
engaged in a great struggle for supre
macy. Edinburgh seemed to get all the ;
breaks. Time after time her chess
teams side-swiped, cross-ruffled, and!
straight-armed their way onward to
majestic victory."
Alumni Troublesome
And at dominoes, the Cornell coach j
stated, the Edinburgliers were too fast I
for description. "The alumni were al
ways kicking, the coaches were all
fired, the graduate managers stopped
wearing knickers, and even the presi
dent's job wasn't safe.
It was at such a time that Mac Levy |
entered the University "of Glasgow, j

lodgings just one hundred yards from ;

every morning at 8 o'clock, and Mac- j
Levy had to be there or send his ap
plication to another university.
Mac Levy Arrives
Every morning he was awakened by
the tramp of the Scotch scholars as
they marched into chapel. And every
morning as he heard them, he would ;
leap out of bed, wiggle into his kilts, j
and go out the door at exactly fifty- !
mitory to the chapel in fifteen seconds, j

began laying bets on him. At the end

land. With only the 100-yard dash left
on the program, the score was tied at
37 1-8 points."
Flops in Crisis
