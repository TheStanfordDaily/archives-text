# STANFORD SOPHOMORE SAVES DROWNING MAN
## 
### 
Plunging into the surf to rescue an
unconscious man and then applying
artificial respiration for over an hour,
Lazare Fred Bernhard, sophomore and
former Eagle Scout of B'nai B'rith
Temple in Los Angeles, saved a drown
ing man from death last Sunday at
Santa Monica, California.
Bernard was on the beach when
the man, Carl Blake, of Los Angeles,
was overcome. After battling through
the waves he reached the unconscious
man and dragged him ashore, where
he applied his skill in first-aid work
by working over him until natural
breathing had been restored.
