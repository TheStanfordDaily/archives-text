# 1930 TRACKMEN WIN OVER FRESNO STATE, OAKLAND HIGH TEAMS
## Morrison, Krenz Babe Stars; Dowell Shows Promise; Kingsbury Fast 
### Robert D. Speers 
Stanford's freshman track team round- j
ed out its schedule of early season meets I
' l
by defeating Fresno State College's oval,
stars 68 to 50 on Alarch 12, and winning i
from the combined Oakland prep school !
aggregation 71 to 59 on March 19.
The Fresno State meet was the best of
the two as the teams were more evenly
matched, both taking the field minus sev
eral stars, and the events moved more
smoothly.
Krenz, Morrison Star
Krenz and Morrison starred against the
San Joaquin valley men. The former
hurled the discus 14iy 2 feet, completely 1
outclassing his opponents, who could not
even come close to the Stanford man's
mark. The big weight thrower's light was
completely extinguished, however, in the
shot event, when he became so interested
in a game of tiddlev-winks or tit-tat-toe
in the gym that he forgot to appear on
Ihe field in time to register for the can
non ball tossing*.
Morrison was yards ahead of the field
in the 440 yard run. His time was 52
flat. Had some of the other competitors
shown enough speed to press the Babe
star he probably could have cut down
this time somewhat, as his running
showed all the marks of an excess of
power.
Morrison and Krenz were again out
standing in the Oakland encounter. The
former was clocked in the 440 in 51 2-5
seconds for a first, while Krenz won the
shot put with a heave of 52 feet 3,'4
inches, and copped the discus event by
throwing the plate 143 feet. Kingsbury,
being ineligible and competing for prac
tice only, completely ran away from his
opponents in the hundred. Dowell, poten
tial broad jumper for the freshmen, had
a terrible time in both meets because of
his proclivity for crow hopping. In the
Fresno State contest he failed to place in
spite of the fact that he made some very
good leaps. Although he took first against
Oakland with a jump of 21 feet l A inch,
it was the only good showing he made.
Dowell will be a very dangerous man
when he overcomes his tendency to step
past the board.
Next Saturday Dink Templeton's first
year outfit will tackle the trackmen from
San Francisco's high schools, who loom
as powerful opponents.
