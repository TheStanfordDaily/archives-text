"Biff" Hoffman is a busy man. In the
fall he stars on the football field, and
in the spring he stars on the track.
Right now he's busy hurling the shot
and discus, whereas last October and
November, and even as late as New
Year's Day, he was throwing forward
passes. Ask the University of South
ern California students —they'll re
member two very important passes he
threw that helped Stanford defeat the
Trojans on October 30th last.
But to get down to business at hand.
