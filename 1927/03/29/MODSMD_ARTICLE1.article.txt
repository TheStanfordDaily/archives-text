# ARTIST PLEASES WITH SKETCHES IN PERFORMANCE
## Impersonation of Debutante Especially Effective Piece of Acting AUDIENCE ENTHRALLED Artist Creates Atmosphere With Use of But Few Stage Properties 
### 
Ruth Draper, considered the most
accomplished reciter on the stage to
day, delighted a generous audience at
her Assembly Hall program last night
with a parade of accurately portrayed
characters. These were impersonated
so cleverly that the spectator was
oblivious of the fact that there was
but a woman 011 a bare stage interpret
ing a succession of female types, and
at all times felt the actual presence
of the imaginary speakers, saw the
setting, and laughed at himself or his
friends as he saw himself or his
friends mimicked and satirized.
The audience was, in short, en
thralled. The artist was one moment
1 French dressmaker, speaking rapidly
in broken English, the next she was
a hollow-voiced old Jewish matriarch.
Then she asumed the debutante's
boarding-school drawl, next a steno
grapher's—each time presenting an en
tirely new vocabulary and voice qual
ity.
But that is merely a third of the
story. There were the expressive ges
tures, inimitable, typical. An uncanny
combination, those words and ges
tures, and one saw a perfectly
sketched character. Especially in the
debutante sketch, where the gestures
became gesticulations, was this true.
The wild flouncing about of the new
member of society provoked hearty
laughter.
In addition to her perfect art of ren
dition. Miss Draper proves her true
art in having written her sketches. No
subtlety is overlooked, no humorous
or pathetic effect is missed —the
sketch is as finished as the perform
ance of it.
The program opened with an imper
sonation of a French dressmaker. A
torrent of French and broken English
evidenced the excellence of Miss
Draper's articulation and offered a
spicy opener. The interpretation of the
three generations of Jewesses, which
came next, was one of the pieces of
the program. "A Debutante," the third
of the group, gave opportunity for the
fullest display of her skill and so
delighted the audience that an encore
was called for. This was a sketch of a
Southern girl at a dance, and was
notable for the accuracy of the South
ern drawl.
"At a Children's Party in Philadel
phia" provided the most laughs of the
evening. As the mother of four, Miss
Draper escorted her offspring to the
party, stopped their quarrels, organ
ized games, and carried on all the
duties of a mother, at the same time
keeping up a barrage of chatter with
her friend and hostess.
Bostonese next floated from the
ladfy's talented throat, and shrewd
Yankee criticisms of modern art
brought continuous laughter.
"In County Kerry" was the sub
stance of an actual incident taking
place in Ireland where Miss Draper
met an old Irish woman whose son
had died at the Dardanelles. The piece
was different from the rest of the pro
gram, but had a depth of feeling that
left a certain satisfaction. The sketch
gave opportunity for the expression
of the rich accent of the Irish of Kerry
which Miss Draper characterized as
the purest she had found abroad.
The encore to this number, "A Class
in Soul Culture," was a rich satire on
the burgeoise leader of a small town
aesthetic dancing class trying to fleece
her students with a talk about "vibra
tions" and harmonious colors.
A great train wreck on the Santa Fe
in which the Harvey-llouse waitress
fears that her lover, the engineer, has
been killed, formed the plot of the
final sketch. While it was more tragic
than the remaining pieces of the pro
pram, it was executed so vividly that
the almost real presence of the rest
of the characters afforded a back
ground for the pent-up outburst 6f
emotion which was the climax of the
scene.
