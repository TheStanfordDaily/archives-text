'I liree Stanford students, among them
two varsity swimmers, enjoyed, or pos
sibly encountered, a plunge that wa-. not
as pleasant as the Knciua pool. The
three, hurrying through the damp Pa
checo Pass in an extremely moist night
in order to arrive at Palo Alto in time
for registration, hit the water when the
car in which they were riding >werved
off the highway and dumped them all
into the ditch at the side <>112 the road.
The pool, itself, was worthy of de
scription: there was water present, but
it was mixed with a great proportion of
most gelatinous mud. The mermen, not
caring for the texture of their surround
ings, made violent attempts to reach the
side of the tank. Wally O'Connor, who
was the hero of the race, was the first
one to finish. When lie crossed the tape,
he pulled his rival, Cecil West, from
under the steering wheel, and both joined
to drag their comrade from the icy
waters.
