# Sunlight Patent Given University by Inventor; Prevents Bone Disease
## 
### 
Patent rights for a process of put
ting sunlight into ordinary foods in
quantities which will prevent rickets
and probably other diseases have been
given to the University of Wisconsin
by the discoverer, Professor Henry
Steinbock. Cereal food manufacturers
offered Professor Steinbock millions of
dollars for the sale of his process, but
he steadfastly refused.
"If I took that money," he said, "it
would mean that the purpose of my
life has been perverted. I am happy
only in the endeavor to enhance the
well-being of humanity."
Unlike other prominent men, Profes
sor Steinbock did not swim a channel
for spectacular reasons or monetary
reward. He did not set his price and
then proceed to pound up another fel
low in a boxing arena. He merely
worked five, long, tedious years in a
laboratory, and refused to capitalize
his product.
