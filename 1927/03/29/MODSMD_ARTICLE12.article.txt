# STANFORD OFFERS CAMPUS LAND FOR BOTANICAL GARDEN
## $1,000,000 FUND NEEDED Organization of Scientists, Business Men Further New Arboretum 
### 
Taking preliminary steps for one of
the most ambitious projects in the
history of botanical science in Amer
ica, the board of trustees of the Uni
versity have consented to appropriate
1000 acres of campus territory to con
struct and develop the greatest botani
cal gardens in the world whenever
sufficient funds are within reach to
assure the success of the scheme. The
scope of the enterprise would require
at least $1,000,000 for getting a start,
while the ultimate development would
need an endowment of from $6,000,000
to $10,000,000.
Under the present plan, the gardens
will be affiliated with the University,
but will be almost entirely a separate
institution. The gardens will be a pre
serve for plant and animal life, a place
where experiments which require gen
erations of observation and effort can
be carried on without interruption. It
will also be an exhibition garden, a
training school for graduate students
and gardeners, a sort of public park,
and an experimental laboratory for
professors and students.
The project is being advanced by a
group of scientists and business men
organized under the name of Pacific
Botanical Gardens, whose executive
committee includes Comptroller A. E.
Roth and Professor G. J. Pierce of
Stanford, Comptroller Robert Sproul
and Professor E. B. Babcock of th
University of California, Dr. H. M.
Hall of the Carnegie Corporation,
George C. Roeding of Fresno, and
M. B. Drury, secretary of a California
conservation league.
