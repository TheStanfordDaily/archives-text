Spring football practice will start to

night that work would continue daily
except Saturday for at least live weeks,
and possibly all quarter. Assistant
Coaches "Tiny" Thornhill and Charles
Winterburn will be on hand to assist
Warner.
All old varsity players, as well as the
new generation, are expected to turn
out. although in a few cases participa
tion in track and baseball will prevent
this.
"We expect nearly all the candidates,"
Pop said, "because there are so many
positions to fill. We will do some experi
mental work and try to perfect a new
formation for the lateral pass."
Equipment will be issued to the as
pirants today and tomorrow at the gym.
