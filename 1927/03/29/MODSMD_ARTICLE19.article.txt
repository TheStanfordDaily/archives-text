# STANFORD TRACK TEAM POINTS TO TROJAN CONTEST
## Field Events, With Hoffman, King, Dyer, Doped to Settle Issue CARDINALS SHOW POWER Intercollegiate Dual Meet Title of Pacific Coast Hinges on Result I 
### Joe Carroll 
And now for Southern California,
j Fresh from a triumphant series of
meets with three of the best club
i teams on the Pacific Coast, the Stan
ford track squad turns to final prepara-
I tions for the struggle with the Trojan
j track and field athletes this Saturday,
j The intercollegiate dual meet title
of the Coast colleges seems to hinge
. upon this Cardinal-Trojan contest.
U.S.C. has already conquered Califor
nia by a large score.
Team Balanced
Judging from the results of the
L.A.A.C. meet last Thursday, the Stan
ford track squad is one of the poten
tially great outfits in dual competition.
Seven firsts, eight seconds, and
I seven thirds, with a winning relay
i team, show a well-balanced team.
The L.A.A.C. men are in excellent
shape, and the Cardinal victory looks
especially good when it is remembered
that the club defeated California 85-46.
Stanford's strong field team will be
a great help against U.S.C. The track
men are expected to break about even.
Hoffman Strong
Biff Hoffman should be good for ten
points in the shot and the discus. Way
, and Forster in the shot, and Evans
in the discus will vie for second and
third places with Aleski, the Trojan
strong man.
The hurdle races will be very close.
Cliff Reynolds, U.S.C. high hurdler,
has bettered 14.S in the highs. Kaer
ran 24 seconds in the lows last Satur
day with Graham, his teammate, close
I behind. West and Nichols, however,
; can equal Reynolds' time in the highs,
; and Ivaer's in the lows.
The sprints look rather weak. Rich
