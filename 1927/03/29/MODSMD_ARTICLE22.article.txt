Public schools and public colleges in California can still teach the
doctrine that man has descended from monkeys. Evolution is recognized
as a study that warrants the consideration of the brains of the state. The
anti-evolution bill fostered by Assemblyman S. L. Heisinger was killed
in the legislature by a vote of 11 to 0, proving that the law-makers in
California are an intelligent lot after all.
Free speech is still a feature of the school system of this state. Edu
cators are still allowed to teach what they believe is sound, and students
arc still permitted to investigate into the fundamentals of life. But there
are those who believe the teaching of evolution an evil. Assistant Pro
fessor Cecil T. Holmes of the Bowdoin College faculty in referring to
the teaching of evolution says: "This appears to some people to be a
trivial matter, but you must have noticed that it is always some such
trivial matter that provides the first impulse toward that dangerous and
rtngodly practice which its apologists are always so careful to describe
as 'thinking for oneself—a practice which we should stamp out at all
costs."
Stamping out the practice of thinking for oneself is a retrogressive
step into the dark ages, and yet such is the recommendation of a teacher
of men at Bowdoin College.
Charles Kingsley said of freedom: "There are two freedoms —the
false, where a man is free to do what he likes; the true, where a man
is free to do what he ought." And the same applies to the freedom of
teaching. A professor is free to teach what he ought, and a student is
free to learn what he ought. Right here the anti-evolutionists would step
up and say the study of man's descent from the lower animals is what
ought not to be taught or learned. The anti-evolutionists' gospel is to
believe, not to investigate. It is an attack on the very foundation of our
educational system. The advocate of such ideas goes along blissfully,
believing everything he reads, and questioning nothing.
How little would have been accomplished in this world if all men
merely believed. 1 low many of the things to which we are so accustomed
today would be our servants if men in the past spent their time believing
and nothing more. It is through doubting that the world has advanced
to its present status.
