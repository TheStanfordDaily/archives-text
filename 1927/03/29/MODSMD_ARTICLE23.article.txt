# "Kissing Okeh"—Dr. Barton
## 
### 
College men and women had a scare somc t weeks ago when it was
announced that every kiss takes three minutes from the length of a
person's life. The Daily is glad to announce that the above statement is
unfounded in the opinion of Dr. Thaddeus L. Bolton, head of the
psychology department of Temple, University. Bolton says:
"Kissing does not shorten life and physicians who say every kiss
takes"three minutes from the length of a human's life are mistaken.
"It is true that every motion above the ordinary accelerates the heart's
action, but if the motion is persisted in it loses its effect on the heart.
The length of the. kiss determines the length of time it will take the
heart to recover its normal stride.
As far as he knows, Dr. Bolton can find only two men who have died
from kissing. Both deaths were caused by exhaustion. Neither of the
men was an American. "It's good for the heart to be kept on its toes,
since it stimulates its action," Dr. Bolton concluded.
Speaking of kisses, the Daily Northwestern prints a modern definition
of the art: "A kiss is a peculiar proposition—of no use to one, yet abso
lute bliss to two. The small boy gets it for nothing. When he is a young
man he has to steal it—after he gets quite old, he has to buy it. It is the
baby's right, the lover's privilege, and the hypocrite's mask. To a young
girl it signifies Faith—to a married woman, Hope, and to an old maid,
Charity."
