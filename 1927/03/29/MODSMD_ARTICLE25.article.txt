Even Phi Beta Kappa members turn to methods of reprisal when
injustice has been done. Non-co-operation as announced by the Cornell
Daily Sun:
"Deadlocked over tho admittance of one man the C.C.N.Y. chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa lias failed to elect any new members from either the June '2G
or February '27 classes. The deadlock was caused by the omission from a
partial list of mon eligible for election last June the name of a former editor
of the City College of New York Campus whose scholarship was unques
tionably high. This discrepancy was pointed out but was not corrected. The
supporters of the candidate in reprisal placed the required number of black
balls on each of the other now men."
