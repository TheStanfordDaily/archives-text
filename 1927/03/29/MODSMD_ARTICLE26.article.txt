THEY'RE OFF!
Today at noon women's rushing begins.
Any way you look at it. there is some
thing comical about this rushing business.
At a given hour on a given day the gun
is fired by the council, and a sotto voce
"They're ofl!" rings 'round the campus.
From then on, the affair is something
like a potato race. Everybody in a hell
of a hurry, but afraid to go too fast for
fear of making a fumble.

The atmosphere that prevails at a rush
ing dinner is only to be matched at a
social affair in diplomatic circles. On the
surface there is nothing going on of any
importance—merely a polite, a too polite
exchange of banalities. Beneath the sur
face there is an enormous tension. The

women, or men, in the house believe
that the fate of their chapter can be
altered tremendously by the results of a
season's rushing. And many of the
freshmen believe that their lives will be
greatly affected by the fortune of bidding.

1 lie system—as the administration has
so frequently pointed out — has many
faults. It has been said that it justifies
itself only in so far as it serves to per
petuate the small—and presumably con
genial—living group. Like a lot'of other
things, the rushing system is not really
as bad as public opinion would lead one
to believe. It has the saving graces of
being quite interesting, and —as has been
said before—more than a little enter
taining.
