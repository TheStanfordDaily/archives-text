# Six Week Trials For Daily Posts Start Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tryouts for the editorial staff of
the Stanford Daily will begin at 12:45
o'clock tomorrow. Aspirants will meet
in the newspaper office next to the
Press building to receive instructions
and assignments for the test period
of six weeks.
Freshmen and sophomores are par
ticularly desired. Students who have
tried out before are again eligible and
will be placed in competition with the
new group. Although previous jour
nalistic experience is not necessary it
will be of value.
Do Regular Work
Tryouteos will first write "dummy,"
or test stories, and do office work to
acquaint them with newspaper meth
ods. Later every opportunity will be
given the candidates to obtain and
write news stories and features. Satis
factory material will be published in
the regular news columns. Quality of
the work turned in and the interest
shown will determine the advance
ment to staff positions.
Work on the Daily offers excellent
opportunity for students to become
familiar with the various phases of
student activities and University ad
ministration by actual contacts. It is
also of value to prospective journalism
majors.
Fred Speers, managing editor, will
conduct the trials.
