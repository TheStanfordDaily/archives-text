"Ben Hur," the great film spectacle
based on General Lew Wallace's novel
of the same name, will show for two
days, Monuay and Tuesday, April 4 and
5, at the San Mateo Theater. The film
will not be shown in Palo Alto.
Aside from the enjoyment to be gained
from seeing in pictures the celebrated
historical novel which is so widely as
signed and read in high school Latin
classes and occasionally elsewhere, "Ben
llur" provided, for the writer at least,
three or four dramatic scenes which
stand out clearly in his memory: namely,
the one in which the Roman galley en
counters the pirate trireme and in which,
strange to say, the galley slaves looked
like galley slaves rather than citizens of
Hollywood; second, the chariot race,
which is positively to watch;
third, the Nativity, with Betty Bronson
as Mary—a most sweet and sympathetic
interpretation; and fourth, the reunion of
Ben llur with his mother and sister,
after the latter have been healed of
leprosy by the Savior.
