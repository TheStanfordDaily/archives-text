# PREFERENCE RUSHING PERIOD WILL START TODAY FOR WOMEN
## 
### 
Spring quarter preference rushing for
campus sororities opens this noon with
luncheons at the ten chapter houses. In
vitations for the four-day courtesy rush
ing period, which commences today and
continues through Friday dinner, were
turned in to Pan-Hellenic on Sunday and
distributed to new women in Roble and
Palo Alto early yesterday morning. No
woman may accept more than one date
with each house during the courtesy rush
ing period.
Intensive rushing starts Monday and
ends with supper the following Sunday.
The sororities will hand in a list that
evening of the women they wish to bid.
Bidding will take place through a lawyer
in Roble on Monday, and the new women
will go from there in cars directly to the
sororities. The exact time of bidding has
not been disclosed.
Dates Limited
All women's rushing will be limited to
luncheon and dinner dates, the former
lasting from 12 until 1:30, and the latter
from 6 to 8. Only one date in advance
with each house is permissible during the
second week.
Any house found guilty of secret bid
ding will not be allowed to pledge any
new members this year. Nor can they
subsequently pledge any women who en
tered this year. There will be a silent
period between the last rushing date and
bidding. Old women in Roble are asked
to co-operate with the sororities in re
fraining from using their influence on.
the new women during this period.
The only sorority rushing so far has
consisted of teas at the beginning of
autumn and winter quarters for all new
women entering in those quarters. There
has been 110 preference rushing previous
I to this week.
