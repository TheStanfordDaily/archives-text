### 
Kansas will henceforth be known as j
the land "where the hose and bloomers j
meet," if Mrs. Mary P. Van Zile, dean '
of the Kansas State Agricultural Col- !
lege, carries out dress regulation plans j
recently announced to the women stu
dents.
"Exposure of bare limbs will not be i
countenanced, and short skirts will not
become any shorter," Dean Van Zile
warned. "When the weather is warm
enough to permit swimming, the women
must wear raincoats over their swimming
suits. If en route from the pools they
desire refreshments, the bathing suits
must be covered while they sip their
sodas."
