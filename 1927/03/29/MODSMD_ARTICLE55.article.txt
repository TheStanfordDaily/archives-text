"Every faculty member of the College
of the Pacific is ready to enter into a
discussion or study of any legitimate
question which the students may desire
to bring up," Dr. Tully C. Knoles, presi
dent of the college, declared in a recent
chape-! address. "The belief that colleges
under state control are broad in their
scope is a false assumption," he contin
ued. "As the inclusiveness of an insti
tution is increased, the field of activities
and investigation must be narrowed."
Commending small enrollments for col
; leges, President Knoles announced that
the present registration showed eight hun
dred students. The women outnumber
the men by one hundred. It has been
found that a great many more men drop
out of college after the first two years
than women. This is attributed to the
fact that more men must abandon their
education to seek remunerative employ
ment.
