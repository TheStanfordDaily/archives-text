# Ex-Stanford Missionary Shows New Use for Radio
## 
### 
Radiograms from isolated foreign
missionaries as a means of ordering
supplies and communicating with the
world were inaugurated recently by
Edwin Cozzens, former Stanford stu
dent, who is now a Presbyterian mis
sionary in Cameroun, West Africa.
Cozzens radioed to the Presbyterian
headquarters in New York for equip
ment, using a small transmitting set
he secured on his last trip to America.
