The name of Waterloo looms big in |
the history of the world. The battle j
of Waterloo was the turning point in
the careers of both Napoleon and Wei-!
lington. So, too, Waterloo proved the!
field on which Fritz Schulte found j
himself.
The lowa city bearing the same j
name as the great battlefield in Bel-1
gium where the armies of the "Man
of Destiny" were put to rout, has a
ball club in a Class D league. There,
in 1924, came a 19-year-old lad with
an aptitude for baseball. He had played
with Rockford the year before without
doing anything startling, but as soon
as he donned the uniform of the
Waterloo Club, he began to show his
class.
Tall, well-built, fast, and with more
than the usual allotment of brains,
Fritz Schulte soon was the talk of the
Mississippi Valley League. In brief,
he batted .368, stole 25 bases, and
fielded his position admirably. The
Milwaukee Club heard of him and
grabbed him before others could sign
him to a contract. In his first season
in lite American Association, he did
nothing startling, batting only .275 in
74 games, but as soon as he got a
regular berth he had the rival pitchers
dizzy.
By the middle of the summer of
1926, young Mr. Schulte, of Milwaukee,
was labeled a sensation. Base hits

were flying from his bat like sparks I
from a pinwheel. His average at the
plate for a time actually topped the 1
.400 mark, and major league scouts
were in frequent communication with
their bosses in regard to how much
they should pay fo rthis young "find."
President Phil Ball, of the St. Louis
Browns, proved the most generous,
and so, for a mere $100,000 or its
equivalent in cash and players, he ac
quired "the catch of the season."
Scliulte ended the year with an aver
age of .347, compiled in 150 games. He
made 142 runs, 207 hits, including 30
doubles, 14 triples, and 13 homers,
and stole 31 bases. It will be very in
teresting to see how this young Wel
lington gets along in major league
company.
