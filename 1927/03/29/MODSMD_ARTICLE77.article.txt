# STANFORD AX USED FOR DECAPITATION AT U.C. IS CHINESE IDEA
## Letter to Oriental Editor Tells of "Cruelties" Practiced in U.S. 
### 
That the Stanford Ax is used by
University of California sophomores
to chop the heads off Chinese students
who "no like wash dirty linen" and
are therefore unclean is the version
of the ax legend abroad in China, judg
ing from the letter from Y. Chang of
Tientsin. China, to the editor of the
North China Star. Chang advises Clii
aese students to stay away from a uni
versity where "barbarious foreigner
kill with ax."
A copy of Chang's letter, which was
fcent to the United States by Ralph
W. Ring, a graduate of the University
of California, follows:
Tientsin, Feb. 11. 1927
The Editor, "North China Star"
Dear Sir:
Please pardon my writing you this
informal letter .Never having met you
face t.o face in your honorable paper
of identical date, I have read with
much misgivings your talk by Mr.
Conette on American education for
Chinese boy. I think you very wrong
about University California, for many
times I have heard that long time ago
University California belong very
proper place, but. however, in feud
br-tween University California and
Stanford College of Palo Alto, Univer
sity California capture from war ore
very great ax, which University Cali
fornia bury on hill behind Greek Thea
tre, and many men talk that every
■"par second year California student
«iig up ax and chop head off all Chinese
treshmen who no like wash dirty linen.
I ask you, is this proper fashion to
act friendly nation?
If University California no use ax
for chop off head of Chinese student,
why they always keep ax and yell who
catch ax just now?
1 think they no use ax for chop
■wood, because California advertise
very best climate, and no use cut
wood for burn.
I beg ask you print this letter in
your paper for no Chinese student
think proper go study University Cali
fornia. where barbarious foreigner kill
with ax.
I am very dear sir, young Chinese
student, and hope you excuse my very
poor English. I have only study three
years in middle school at Tientsin and
I hear you are very kind to all Chi
nese.
Enclose my name card.
Yours truly, Y. Chang.
