# Students Fete Parents At University of Texas
## 
### 
Yesterday was Dad's and Mother's
Day at the University of Texas. The
mothers and dads were first escorted
about the campus on a sight-seeing
tour. An all-around university pro
gram was presented to them from 11
to 12 noon. A special luncheon with a
student program came next, after
which the parents were the guests of
the university at the baseball game
with Southern Methodist University.
