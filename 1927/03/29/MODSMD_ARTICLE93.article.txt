# "COLLEGES ARE GOOD THING-FOR WOMEN" SAYS WILL ROGERS
## 
### 
SYRACUSE, N.Y., March 26.—"Col
leges are a good thing," grinned Will
Rogers, America's Poet Lariat, in an
interview here recently, adding " —for
girls." They oughta know a lot
more No! Cod knows they know
enough, hut they oughta he better
educated. They have to earn more or
a lottta young men won't be supported
in the style to which they've been ac
customed."
College Not Vacation
He doesn't agree with H. G. Wells
in his claims that a college course is
a four-year vacation, but feels "that
fewer dances and football games might
give the youngsters more time to
play. Less lecturing and more educa
tion," he thinks, "might relieve the
situation.
When asked what he thought about
fraternities and sororities, Rogers said,
"Well, 1 believe they serve a good
purpose. They take the boys and girls
away from the common herd while
they're at school, but they get on the
normal level after they get out."
Can't Accept Degree
While he was visiting Nicholas Mur
ray Butler a short time ago, the Colum
bia Dean said he was going to see that
Rogers received a college degree. The
peer of modern humorists replied he
couldn't accept because it would put
them on the same plane.
Asked if lie thought it advisable for
college grid performers to turn pro
fessional on graduation, he told us,
"uot until they have made as much as
possible in the amateur ranks."
Rogers has a brotherly feeling for
George Bernard Shaw, England's "in
tellectual scoffer." He says "we both
know the world's wrong. We don't
know what's wrong with it —but, we're
getting paid to fix it at so much a
word."
