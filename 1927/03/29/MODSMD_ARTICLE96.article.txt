UNIVERSITY, Va„ March 27 —
(I.P.) —The youth of today is free from
hypocrisy, is broadening his mind, and is
displaying a self-control that bodes well
for the future of the world, according to
Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, president of the
University of Virginia.
Dr. Alderman lists as the five greatest
temptations which have arisen during the
past twenty years, the automobile, motion
pictures, radio, increased number of sala
cious publications, and the increased popu
larity of college sports.
