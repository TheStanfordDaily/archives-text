# THEORY OF EARTH'S ORIGIN REFUTED BY CHICAGO PROFESSOR
## 
### 
"The earth was never a molten mass
as lias been believed by modern sci
ence," claims Thomas C. Chamberlain,
professor emeritus of geology at the
University of Chicago, "it lias grown
up slowly in a solid state with a core
of metalic and stoney material. If the
mass had been molten, there would
have been no such imperfectations in
the shape of the earth as now exist."
Professor Chamberlain, who is 84
years of age, has just announced this
new theory after 23 years spent in the
study of the origin of the earth. The
new theory has it that sometime in
the past a star approached near
enough to our sun to cause, by tidal
action, small portions of it to be
thrown off, one of these portions being
the earth.
