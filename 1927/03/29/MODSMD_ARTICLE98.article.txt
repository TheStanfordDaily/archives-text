Latest in the defense of student
autos on the college campus is Chan- j
cellor H. R. Harper of the University |
of Denver, who declares that autos |
are a near necessity in a university of !
the type of Denver, though they may '
be dispensed with in some institutions.
"Where the use of the automobile !
is detrimental to students and no ac- j
tual necessity exists for its use as!
transportation I agree with those col-'
lege authorities who would ban the!
car from the campus," he says.
"In the Great American centers,!
however," he states, "there is a dif- j
ferent situation necessitating the use I
of the auto for student transportation, i
In New York and Chicago this is par-!
ticularly true. There autos are almost j
a necessity."
