# CRITICS PRAISE PERSONALITY OF ITALIAN TENOR
## Echaniz, Accompanist, Will Vary Singing Program By Piano Numbers SELECTIONS COLORFUL Premier Singer of Chicago Opera Company to Sing Here Tomorrow 
### Hubert Gagos 
"Someone with more than just a
good tenor voice—an artist with dra
matic ability and stage presence," is
the verdict of critics speaking of Tito I
Schipa, famous lyric tenor of the j
Chicago Opera Company, who will sing
in the Basketball Pavilion tomorrow J
night in the last of the A.S.S.U. con
cert series.
From San Francisco and Los An
geles have come reports which empha
size the effect of Shipa's personality
•on his audience. One critic said, "He
fairly held the audience in the hollow
of his hand."
Schipa has sung in many European
countries and throughout America,
leaving behind him impressions of his
charm equal to the admiration of his
musical genius.
His programs are carefully selected
to give variety and color. In his Stan
■ford program many of his record suc
cesses will be sung. Arias from operas
as well as lighter compositions will be
included.
Jose Echaniz, his accompanist, will
vary the singing program by two
piano selections. Schipa's program will
include Massenet's Manon and the,
well-known "Harlequin's serenade i
from Tagliacci'." "The Valley of i
Leroy" and "At Parting" are the selec- \
tions to be sung in English.
