# STANFORD NET VICTORY OVER U.C. FORECAST
## HOLMAN REGAINS FORM Loss of 1926 Intercollegiate Champion, Chandler, Hinders Bruins 
### Milton Silverman 
With all preliminary contests tucked
safely under its belt, the Stanford
varsity tennis team has only the Uni
versity of California between it and
the most successful year it has ever
witnessed.
Coach Hal Davis, who has been put
ting the Stanford men through their
final training, is confident that the
Cardinal will decisively down the
Golden Bear â€”the second time in four
teen years. "We have the best team
we have ever had here at Stanford,"
he said, "and we are doped to win."
Holman Picks Up
Cranston Holman, ranking player on
the Cardinal team, has recovered en
tirely from the slump under which he
was playing last summer. He recently
won the Pasadena tournament, defeat
ing the cream of the southern stars
without losing a single set.
Lionel Ogden, although ranking
third, will play as second man against
California. Ralph McElvenny, second
man, will play third, while Alan Her
rington will play fourth. All three of
these men are playing in top form at
the present time, and those who have
been following their matches predict
that they will be in the best of condi
tion for their last-encounter.
Although seriously handicapped by
the loss of Edward G. "Bud" Chandler,
three-time national intercollegiate
champion and the main reason for
California's victory in the past few
years, the Blue and Gold can still offer
at least two racqueters that have won
intercollegiate fame. Bradshaw Har
rison, an old rival of Holman, is the
outstanding Bear threat. Although
there is some doubt as to his eligibil
ity, it is nearly certain that lie will
play against the Cardinal captain.
Stow Meets Ogden
Tom Stow, who, with Chandler,
holds the national intercollegiate title,
and is ranked with him at the top of
the intercollegiate doubles rating, will
play Ogden in the second singles
match. Johnny ltisso, a left-handed
player, and Edmund Burke complete
the California team. Both of these are
quite well known in local tennis cir
cles.
Although the best match of the day
will be that between Holman and Har
rison, the doubles, with Holman and
Ogden competing for Stanford against
Harison and Stow, will probably be
equally as entertaining. The meet,
which will be held on the Stanford
varsity courts, will take place the
morning of April 9.
