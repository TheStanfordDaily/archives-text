# SPRING WATER SPORT PROGRAM ANNOUNCED BY COACH BRANDSTEN
## 
### 
Coach Ernst Brandsten announced
yesterday the swimming program for
the early part of the spring quarter.
Immediately following the Stanford-
University of Southern California var
sity meet, which is scheduled for April
9, the first round of interclass water
polo will be held. On April 12, in the
Encina pool, the freshmen and the
sophomore teams will meet in the
first game, with the juniors playing
the seniors in the second. The final
contest will be on April 14, with the
winners of the previous games
matched against each other. All men
in the University are eligible for com
petition.
Another all-University swimming
event is planned for May 5, when a
100-yard free-style race will be held
to determine the University champion.
This swim, which Brandsten intends
to hold annually, will also be open to
all men.
Since Wally O'Connor, varsity sprint
star, has not registered this quarter, it
is extremely difficult at this time to
judge the probable outcome of the
race. Van den Akker of the varsity
has shown up well during recent com
petition, and is figured to prove a
strong bidder for a high place. Bob
Williams and Captain Carl Stevenson,
both also on the varsity, will doubtless
furnish a great deal of competition.
On the freshman team, both Driggs
and Harrison are conceded an even
chance to break into the first three
places. Another freshman, Bramel,
who showed up favorably in the in
tramural meet, is also doped to be a
strong entry.
