## Time for Talk Changed to Avoid Conflict With Schipa Concert 
### 
To avoid conflicting with the
A.S.S.U. concert tomorrow evening,
the illustrated lecture on ''Greece Be
fore the Greeks" by Professor John
Linton Myres, Oxford professor now
lecturing at the University of Califor
nia, will be given in the Little Theatre
at 4:15 o'clock Thursday.
While visiting the Stanford campus
Myres will visit Professor Henry R.
Fairclough, head of the Classical
Literature department and one of his
personal friends. Fairclough was a
member of one of Myres' expeditions
to Crete.
"Professor Myres is one of the lead
ing authorities of the present day in
the field of anthropology," said Pro
fessor Fairclough. "That he is well
thought of in the British scientific
world is shown by his holding the im
portant position of General Secretary
of the British Association for the Ad
vancement of Science.''
The speaker has won several fellow
ships through his work in classical re
search, and in addition to the degree
of M.A. he was awarded the D.Sc. by
the University of Wales. He has been
honored by the British Government in
being awarded by Official Order of
the British Empire, is a Fellow of the
British Academy, a Fellow of the So
ciety of Antiquaries, and Fellow and
Librarian of New College, Oxford,
since 1910. He was made Commander
of the Royal Order of George I of
Greece in 191S for his work in Greek
research.
