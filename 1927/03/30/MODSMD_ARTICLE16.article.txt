# PHI KAPS, EL TORO TO MEET IN FIRST MURAL BALL GAME
## OUTCOME QUITE VAGUE Sequoia Doped to Win Title In League I by Large Percentage 
### 
When Phi Kappa Sigma and El Toro
meet on the diamond Monday, an in
tramural baseball series will start
the outcome of which is decidedly
vague. Several of the living groups,
judged by their records of last year
and by the teams they plan to enter
in this series, stand out slight favo
rites, but the margin of choice re
mains very small.
In League I, Sequoia is doped to win
the championship by a large percent
age, although either Phi Kappa Sigma
or Phi Delta Theta may completely
upset the predicted results. Both
Sigma Nu and Theta Xi have good
chances to take first place in League
11, with probably Sigma Nu having a
slight edge.
League 111 Deadlocked
League 111 presents another dead
lock between Zeta Psi and Phi Gamma
Delta. Both of these houses have con
sistently produced teams that have
shown up well in competition, and
either one has a good chance to win
out.
Every one of the six teams in
League IV stacks up equally well at
the present time. Any one of the nines,
if in any other league, would be a
strong contender for the champion
ship. Two eating clubs seem destined
to fight out the honors of League V.
Junipero Serra and El Tigre, although
not appearing greatly superior to the
others, will probably fight out first
place between them.
D.U. fs Dark Horse
Either Alpha Kappa Lambda or the
Breakers should take top honors in
League VI, with Delta Upsilon en
tered as the dark horse. In League VII
the championship apparently rests be
tween El Campo and Delta Tau Delta.
The former, which has already won
the University championship, is a
likely contender to repeat its victories.
Charles W. Davis, Director of Intra
mural Athletics, and who is taking
charge of the series, is asking for
several more men to umpire the
games. Any men who have had ex
perience in that line, and would care
to earn the regular umpiring fee, are
asked to see Davis immediately.
