# Stanford's Location Commended By German Admiral While On Campus
## 
### 
"Stanford stands out in my mind j
from all other American universities
because of its singular location," said
Admiral Paul Behncke, retired, of the
German navy, when he visited the
campus yesterday. "Its situation away
from the city, yet in close contact
with the metropolis, should give its stu
dents unique and envious advantages.
Admiral Behnrke, who laid the foun
dation of the present German navy,
was accompanied by Dr. Paul Ziegler,
the German Consul General in San
Francisco, and bore a letter of intro
duction from Dr. Jacob Shurman, U.S.
ambassador at Berlin. John A. Sel
lards, Director of the Summer Quar
ter, entertained at luncheon in the
Stanford Union in honor of the dis
tinguished visitor, who later called
upon President Wilbur and toured the
campus.
Restriction on enrollment was par

ticularly praised by Admiral Behncke,
who is touring the United Slates in a
purely private capacity. Organizations
and work of the universities and mod
ern developments of industry, trans
portation, and finance have engaged
his attention on this trip. The Hoover
War Library, the aerodynamics labora
tory, the stadium, and the dormitory
system made a distinct impression
upon the admiral.

Admiral Behncke was naval chief
