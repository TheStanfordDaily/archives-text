# HURDLES LOOM ALL-IMPORTANT IN U.S.C. MEET
## Redshirts Heavy Favorites In Field Events; Track Honors Appear Even KAER IS TROJAN THREAT Reynolds Rated Second to Cardinal Contestants In Short Race 
### Joe Carroll 
Featuring Clarence West and Ross
Nichols of Stanford, and Cliff Rey
nolds, Morton Kaer, and Alex Graham
of the University of Southern Cali
fornia, the high- and low-hurdle races
next Saturday will have a very defi
nite bearing upon the outcome of the
Cardinal-Trojan track meet.
When athletes such as the above
engage in contests upon which the
outcome of an intercollegiate battle
may hinge, exceptional performances
are expected. These men rank high in
hurdling circles, and two real races
will be forthcoming.
Reynolds Trojan Star
Reynolds will furnish West and
Nichols with plenty of competition in
the high hurdles. His injured leg, how
ever, gives the Cardinal athletes the
edge, but a week of rest may help him
to better 15.2, the mark he made last
Saturday.
Morton Kaer's time of 24 seconds
flat last Saturday, when he ran his
first full flight of hurdles this season,
shows that he is a real threat in this
race. West, however, is figured to beat
him, with Nichols a strong third.
No one will be greatly surprised,
whatever the outcome of the hurdles,
and very fast times seem certain.
Field Events Stanford's
Stanford's real power lies in the
field events. Redshirted athletes may
make a clean sweep in the shot-put
and javelin throw. First and second
places could be had in the discus. A
tie for first is the very least that can
be figured in the high jump. A second
in the pole vault, and either one or
two places in the broad jump, will
give Stanford a lead in the field
events.
If the meet depends upon the relay,
as some people are inclined to be
lieve, Stanford should win easily un
less someone drops the baton. The
Cardinal quarter-milers ran the mile
in 3 minutes, 21 1-5 seconds last
week, while the Trojan four took 3
minutes, 23 seconds to cover the dis
tance.
