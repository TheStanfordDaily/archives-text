Stanford received a treat Monday night when Ruth Draper appeared
in the Assembly Hall and portrayed characters of every walk of life.
Miss Draper possessed a personal charm that would have won any audi
ence, but the technique of the artist's work and the carefully chosen
program kept the crowd in wonder during two short hours. Old and
young were completely satisfied with Ruth Draper.
But the queen was received in a barn. The best people were there and
seats were practically all filled, but Miss Draper was introduced in the
Stanford barn. The guide of the University describes the meeting place
as the Assembly Hall, but, like everything found in guidebooks, the
description and facts have to be taken with a grain of salt.
Monday night, a world-famous artist was iorced to don a coat in the
middle of the production to keep from "freezing to death." It was not
a matter of a temperamental actress being on a tangent, for it WAS
cold. In the last sketch, which was a portrayal of a snowy night in a
railroad restaurant, Miss Draper put her heart and soul into her work.
She could shiver with the cold, legitimately, when the door of the cafe
was supposed to be opened and the wintry wind supposed to blow into
the western building.
Another incident that occurred during Miss Draper's short visit to
the barn was the ringing of a telephone backstage at a tense moment of
one of the characterizations. The bell not only rang once, but several
times before some ingenious stage hand muffled it.
After months of seeing it, Stanford people have become used to the
unplastered ceiling with the rafters showing, but to an outsider who is
accustomed to the best houses in New York the structure must have been
hideous. All were thankful that no bats flew down from the attic during
the evening.
Miss Draper is not the only notable person who has been entertained
in the assembly barn, and she will not be the last. If there are no funds
to build a new gathering place or to improve the present one now, cer
tainly little matters such as heat and ringing telephones could be attended
to and corrected.
