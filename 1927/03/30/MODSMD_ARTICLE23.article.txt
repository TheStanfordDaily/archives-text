# Credit to the Defeated
## 
### 
1 he Columns, a University of Washington magazine, which was sup
pressed because of a story that appeared during February which did not
say Abe Lincoln was the greatest president of the United States or other
such praising statements, has selected a new editor and will continue
publication with April's issue.
The editor makes this statement in accepting the new position: "I
will promise to run no stories of my own as long as I get enough other
stuff to fill the magazine. Columns, for the next three issues, if I last
that long, will be very conservative in tone and makeup."
The editor appears from the above statement to be just about as
backward as the officials who stopped the publication a month ago by
dismissing the editor at that time. The new head of Columns compro
mises himself and accepts the position with a promise to be a good boy.
He will not print what he thinks he should but rather what he thinks the
administration would like to have him publish. lie will 110 doubt make
a fine servant for someone some day. lie will be able to obey orders and
be a success in a small way.
The credit goes to the ex-editor who had the power of his own con
victions. lie printed what he thought right and suffered the consequences,
but at least he had a mind of his own. He has learned to think for
himself during his stay at Washington. To learn how to accept orders
is a good tiling, but universities were never founded to teach men and
women such things. A good early start in any form of business would
teach a person to take orders in a shorter time and at a smaller expense.
