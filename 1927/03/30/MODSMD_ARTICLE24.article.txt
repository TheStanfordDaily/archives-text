With the opening of the spring quarter tryouts today for the Daily
staff, students will be given an opportunity to indulge in one phase of
campus journalism which duplicates to a great extent actual professional
work. Those, then, who intend to follow such work upon leaving college
will be the ones for whom the Daily tryouts will have the greatest
interest.
But work on the Daily offers other benefits which cati be of value
to anyone both during and after college. From potential bond salesmen,
engineers, and bank presidents to would-be professors, some actual work
ing knowledge of practical journalism can always be of worth. Experi
ence on the Daily aids students to write and to think clearly, and for
this fact alone the opportunity for a position on the staff should not be
overlooked.
