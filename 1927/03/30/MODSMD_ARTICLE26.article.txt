"€UN UP" at the Columbia
Theatre. A drama of the Carolina
mountains with Lucille La Verne
in her classic, role of the Widow
Cagle, foe of the "revenooers."
Her performance, enriched by
four years of incessant study and
practice, is one of the affecting
characterizations of this day.
"AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY"
at the Wilkes. The stage drama
taken from Theodore Dreiser's
popular novel of last year. It is
done in four acts and eleven
scenes with a cast of more than
forty players headed by Leslie
Femon and Ruby Rush.
"THE VAGABOND KING" at
the Curran. For the last year the
operetta success of Broadway,
and pronounced as the most
thrilling musical play ever pro
duced in America.
"RAIN" at the Alcazar. The
drama of the South Seas with
the color and glamour of the
tropics all there. Sadie Thomp
son, a notorious woman, who de
scends upon tribulations on the
soggy shore of Pago-Pago.
"THE FAMILY UPSTAIRS" at
the President. Beginning its sixth
successful week. It is a laugh
from start to finish and the spec
tator is given an opportunity to
see himself as others see him.

In putting Mr. Dreiser's "An Ameri
can Tragedy" upon the stage Patrick
Kearney did a hard job rather well.
It was hard to chop, trim, slice, dove
tail, and adjust Mr. Dreiser's expan
sive epic into the limits of a show.
The art of the stage would not allow
him, for instance, to picture the scene
on Big Bittern Lake, where Clyde mur
dered or did not murder Roberta
Alden, his enceinte and irksome sweet
heart. What a riot that episode would
have been if the theatre could repro
duce it! Tho black, mysterious water,
the cemetery of fir trees bordering its
sinister shores, the ominous wail of
an evil bird, the upset canoe and the
death of the distressed maiden, as her
lover swam furtively away.
Nevertheless "An American Trag
edy" is a haunting play, a good ghost
of Theodore Dreiser's book which is
the ghost of the story of Chester
Gillette, whose crime, some years ago,
attracted the attention of the news
paper public.

j During its initial performance in
San Francisco, many women wept and
strong men shivered. When the final
curtahi fell, a stunned audience, slug
' gishly stirred itself into life. The
I mood of the play was still upon it.
Scattered all over the theatre were
: little groups of women wiping out the
| tear furrows that marked their
I cheeks, and otherwise repairing the
| ravages to their complexions. The
woman, who is never so happy until
j she is miserable, was there in the
I crowd.
And yet it is a common and familiar
I story "An American Tragedy" tells.
So common in the theatre that many
of the professional confreres find it dull
! and boresome, Clyde Griffiths, hero,
j is much the average type. Kearney in
troduces him in a prologue attending
! a street meeting of his evangelical
J parents—a wistful, hopeful, restless
! youth, troubled a little by the call of
| life symbolized by the flaunted lights
i of a night club in the hall above the
meeting.
The final scene, and the one that
| causes the emotional havoc, is the one
I in the death house. It is the night be
i fore the execution. Clyde is resigned.
! but still mystified by the turns of fate.
He is, he still feels, guiltless of the
act of murder, whatever his thought
i might have been ....
There are the first streaks of dawn
j through the bars. From the adjoining
cells of the death house comes the
shrill hysterical shrieking of the other
prisoners. The guards arrive for the
final act of cutting the condemned
man's trouser leg for the electrode con
tact. The chief of the guards mutters
a final order. Clyde rises and takes
his positioji between them. At the
door of his cell Clyde pauses. "Good
bye," he calls. "Goodbye all." The
shrieking of the cellmates is redou
bled. The curtain falls.
It is that scene that is the mak
' ing of "An American Tragedy." The
I emotional reaction of youth, of defi
' nite character weaknesses, is so tre
mendous as a heart purge that it
leaves its autditors not only limp but
a little glowing with the very tre
mendousness of it.
