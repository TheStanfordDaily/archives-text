# CABBAGES and THINGS
## WHO ARE THESE WOMEN??? 
### 
Interviewed by the Harvard Crim
son, the captain of the visiting Eng
lish squash team expressed surprise
"to find how much alike are married
and unmarried women in this coun
try."
When questioned by Cabbages, four
hundred and ninety-six members of
the Stanford "500" denied the above
with a great deal of coy vehemence
and, as far as could be ascertained,
some measure of veracity.
The names of the other four? Did
we get them? Yes; wo would, you
know. Watch tomorrow's colyum for
further Information. The names will
be published.

Definition of Innocent: A rushee
who believes that the sororities have
such meals every day.
Which reminds us —Only a couple

of more weeks go on their annual
carnival of Rood eats. Then half the
members will be crowded out. Life IS
like that.

"Old women in Roble are asked to
co-operate with the sororities in re
fraining from using their influence on
the new women." —Item on Page 1
