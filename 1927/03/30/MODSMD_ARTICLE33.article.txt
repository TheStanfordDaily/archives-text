### Margaret Mudgett 
A group of more than thirty oil
paintings by K. Iliraga, Japanese
artist, who recently returned from
Paris, will be shown in the Stanford
Art Gallery for a period ending April
10.
The collection was painted in France
and shows scenes among the quaint
towns of Brittany. The massive walls
and irregular roof-lines of the peasant
towns of this seaside province of
France have been artistically recorded
by Mr. Hiraga. Those who enjoy the
scenes of meandering, crooked little
streets will find several such street
scenes in the collection.
Mr. Hiraga studied art in Japan
originally after the Japanese manner.
Later he studied art in the San Fran
cisco Institute of Art for several
years, completing his studies in Julian
Academy under Jules Pages. He later
became a pupil of Lucien Simon, the
noted French master.
Mr. Hiraga recently had an exhibi
tion of paintings in Los Angeles of
scenes painted in Spain which was so
fully appreciated that nearly all the
sketches were purchased. Mr. Hiraga
will leave again for Europe next month
on another sketch tour in Spain and
Italy.
