# Chappie Copy Deadline Set Old Boy Wants Track Gags Art Material Also Desired
## 
### 
This afternoon is the last period that
copy for the Track and Homecoming
number of Chaparral may be turned in
at the magazine's office in the Press
building, announces Winston Norman,
editor, who is putting the Old Boy
through his paces for the first time.
Art copy and two-line jokes pertain
ing to the idiosyncrasies of tracksters
of today and returning grads of the
"good, old days" are particularly de
sired, but material of a general nature
will also be considered.
The April issue will be on sale
around Big Meet time, and the Old
Boy wants to prove to the alumni who
wander back to the Farm that he, like
Fannie Ward, just cannot grow old in
spirit, even though he has aged in
years. So he will be waiting in his
office for the last time this afternoon
to accept material that is sufficiently
humorous to tickle his susceptible
funny-bone.
