# CANADA'S POLICY IN SAVING WILD ANIMALS EXPLAINED
## 
### 
Canada's policy in preserving wild i
life was explained by Captain F. G.
Forster, representing the Canadian
Government, in the Little Theatre last
night. He illustrated his topic, "Con- j
servation of Wild Life," with three;
one-reel films showing scenic features
of the parks, and tame game within |
their boundaries.
Conservation Needed
"If you take wild life out of the
landscape," said Captain Forster, "you
take 75 per cent of the interest away, s
Repeating guns practically extin-'
guished much of the wild life in Can- j
ada about sixty years ago, when Can-1
ada first became a confederation, and j
the people were faced with the same
problem of conserving game which
you in the United States are facing
now.
"The Canadian Government has set j
aside 6,400,000 acres for National
Parks. No killing of any kind is per- j
mitted at any time within their boun- j

daries. This law is one of the most
jealously guarded, and by its observ
ance the government is able to stock
up the parks again. Neighboring terri
tories, too, are stocked from these
sources after the drain of the hunting
season."
Pictures Shown
Captain Forster's first picture
showed the many-peaked country in
Jasper National Park, where the
speaker said that on a motor tour he
has had to "halt the car to permit
Bighorn Mountain Sheep to get off the
roadway near Banff." His second
showed the progress of a mountain
climbing expedition up the 13,000 feet
high Mount Robson, under the direc
tion of "an imported mountain chape
ron from Switzerland"; and his last
gave glimpses of bull moose, white
tailed deer, and bear photographically
"shot" from a canoe by an electric
camera. All the animals in the parks
were tame and easily approached by
visitors.
