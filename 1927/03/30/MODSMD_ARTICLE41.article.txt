# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There are outfields and outfields.
Then there is the trio of fly-chasers
who roam the outer gardens for the
Washington Senators. They weren't
bad last year, you know —Goelin, Rice,
and McNeely, with Joe Harris to help
out. if necessary. But look whom Clark
Griffith up and grabbed just after the
smoke of the scandal cleared away!
None other than Sir Tristram Speaker
of Hubbard, Texas, the Gray Ghost,
the Silver Fox —Old Spoke himself,
long considered one of the greatest
outfielders in the game!
So Mr. Speaker, late of Cleveland,
and formerly of Boston, where he and
Harry Hooper and Duffy Lewis formed
one of the outfields of all time, now
adds his prestige and ability to make
the Washington trio rank among the
best collection of hitting, fielding, and

base-running stars on one club. True,
they may be outhit by Heilmann, Man
ush, and Fothergill, of Detroit, or
Cobb, Wheat, and Simmons, of the
Athletics, but where else in the Ameri
can league can you find such a classy
all-round triumvirate?
Last season Speaker hit only .304,
in his nineteenth season, but his life
time average, including 1907, when he
played seven games for the Red Sox,
is .347. Tris will be 39 years old next
week, and in this, his Vindication
Year, he wants to play ball as he
never has played before. Rice and Gos
lin hit .337 and .354, respectively, last
year, Sam stealing 25 bases and
"Goose" eight. Each made over 200
hits, and they scored 203 runs between
them. There is no reason why they
should not continue the good work in
1927.
