## 
### 
Thomas Marshall, freshman at the
University of Colorado, went to call
upon a girl at a sorority house at that
university, one evening last week. He
had hardly entered the door, when a
health officer quarantined the house
for scarlet fever. Marshall has been
there ever since.
"I've led a dog's life," said Marshall,
in a statement made over the tele
phone; "they're all nice girls—all fif
teen of them —but still I don't think it
was fair that they made me wash the
dishes every night. And the way they
blackened the fudge pans was a
crime."
