# EVOLUTION BILLS LOSING FIGHT FOR PASSAGE LEGISLATURES TURN DOWN SEVEN MEASURES NARROW-MINDEDNESS OF PUBLIC IS DECREASING
## 
### 
Proof that the American public is
becoming aware of the narrow-minded,
ignorant attitude of the minority
groups proposing anti-evolution laws,
is offered by the fact that seven such
(tills have been voted down by state
legislatures within the last few
months, according to Professor Sam
uel J. Holmes, of the University of
California department of zoology,
chairman of the national committee
on freedom of teaching in science.
Through the activities of the com
mittee which he heads, Professor
iHolmes has kept closely in touch with
all bills presented anywhere in the
United States dealing with freedom
of teaching. In addition to the seven
that have just been voted down in
California, Louisiana, Missouri, Arkan
sas, Oklahoma, North Carolina, and
North Dakota; there are four others
waiting action in South Carolina, Ala
bama, Minnesota, and West Virginia.
Two States Pass Bills
In only two states have proponents
of such foolish legislation been suc
cessful, he points out, Mississippi and
â€¢Tennessee. In the former state no
trouble has yet arisen over the law,
nnd Tennessee was made the laughing
utock of the country by trying to en
force it.
One of the most exalting fights for
the right to teach and study the truth
as they see it, is now being waged by
the faculty and students of the Uni
versity of Minnesota, a report to Pro
fessor Holmes states. In that state,
fundamentalists under the leadership
of a W. B. Riley, are waging such a
campaign to excite the people against

| the freedom of teaching, that the uni
versity has felt it necessary to rise in
defense of its right. Nine deans of the
; institution have issued unqualified pro
tects against the bill, and the faculty
and student body are united in fight
ing against it.
Mass Meetings Held
In addition to mass meetings and
rallies the faculty has issued a state
ment of its stand for freedom which
, Professor Holmes quotes as applicable
: to the bill just voted down by the
California legislature: "We affirm our
| profound conviction that the purposes
i for which a university is founded can
!be realized only through the most
; complete freedom of research and
teaching on the part of its competent
! scholars; that the possible errors
which naturally arise in connection
with all human endeavors, there
! search of scholars not excepted, can
! best receive their correction through
the free and unrestrained mutual
! criticism of scholars by scholars; that
I the cause of scientific truth cannot be
: advanced by interferences, in such
I matter of those who are confessedly
i not scholars in the fields concerned.
"We call attention to the fact that
the sound scientific status of the
theory of evolution is affirmed bv
i practically the unanimous opinion of
! the world's scientists. We profess our
' faith in the unity and harmony of all
! truth, scientific and religious; we be
j lieve that the appearance of conflict
| which sometimes arises in our human
| endeavors to grasp the truth will al-
I ways eventually be dissipated under
: the stimulus of free inquiry and free
| discussion."
