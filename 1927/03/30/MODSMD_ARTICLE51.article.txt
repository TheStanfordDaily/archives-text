A fine of $200 was imposed upon
the freshman class of Queen's Univer
sity when that body broke the rules
laid down by the student government
of the institution and held a sleighride.
The freshmen pleaded that they were
justified in the act because the sopho
mores, knowing of their intended ride,
had not warned them of the conse
quences.
