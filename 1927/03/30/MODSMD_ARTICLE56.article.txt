# Mass Study Methods Abolished at Antioch
## 
### 
Antioch College has adopted a plan
of study that abolishes all mass meth
od and puts the student almost entire-)
ly on his own resources. The instruc
tor acts only as an advisor when the
student finds it impossible to continue
his study without help.
Each subject is fully outlined for
the year, and then it is up to the
student to master it in any way he j
sees fit. No quizzes or monthly tests ;
are given and all the student is re-;
quired to do, is to be able to pass the
examinations at the end of the year,,
Individual attention is given by the
instructors, and group discussions take
the place of classes.
