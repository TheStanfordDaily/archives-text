# BABES PUT THROUGH STRENUOUS DIAMOND SCRIMMAGE BY HUNT
## 
### 
With the first game of the Stanford-
California freshman baseball series
three days off, Coach Husky Hunt has
planned strenuous scrimmage for his
men this afternoon.
Prospects for a winning nine look
favorable, Coach Hunt believes. On
(he other hand, with only ten men out
the babes have returned to the old
days when "the Stanford nine" was
composed of only nine members. Poor
scholastic standing has cut the year
ling squad to the margin line.
Bianchi, shortstop, sprained his
ankle in the Berkeley High School
game, and this further cuts the Cardi
nal yearling squad. Berg has been
moved up in liis place and is playing
in good form, showing exceptional
speed and accuracy in throwing the
ball.
Simkins in the pitcher's box has
plenty of power and has thrown an ac
curate and well-mixed variety of ball.
Storey, second-baseman, has proved
to be one of the most reliable hitters
that Hunt has. Sparks, catcher, is
also good when it comes to batting.
