# FAMOUS TENOR GIVES CONCERT HERE TONIGHT
## Advance Ticket Sale Proves Largest Yet Recorded For Recital Here NEARLY ALL SEATS SOLD Tito Schipa Gains Fame as Individual Artist of Great Merit 
### Herbert Klein 
With a heavier advance ticket sale
for the Schipa recital in the pavilion
tonight than for any of the four pre
vious concerts in the Associated Stu
dents Series, Wilfrid Davis, manager
of the series, expects a completely
sold out house. "The last concert
should be the greatest in popularity
as well as seat sales," says Davis.
Very Popular
Schipa has recently given two re
citals in San Francisco and one in
Los Angeles. Reports from those who
heard, these recitals indicate that the
premier tenor of the Chicago Opera
Company still radiates the same mag
netism of personality and retains un
dimmed the vocal power that has made
him a favorite all over the country.
Is Caruso's Successor
Ever since the death of Enrico
Caruso there has been the expected
number of candidates advanced to be
"Caruso's successor" as the world's
greatest tenor. It seems safe to say
by now that Schipa has successfully
manifested his right to this imaginary
but valuable title. In all the roster of
lyric tenors there is 110 one name heard
quite so often, nor any voice used as
a standard of comparison for others
so consistently.
Recording Artist
Although Schipa himself will be a
new figure for most of the Stanford
audience tonight, many will be famil
iar with bis voice, for'he is among
the most popular of recording artists,
having made many records for a well
known phonograph company. Many of
these songs are on the program to
night.
