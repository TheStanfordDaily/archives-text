# CARD RUNNERS EXPECT STRONG U.S.C. OUTFIT
## Half-Mile, Broad Jump Will Be Real Battles of Saturday's Meet BOTH TEAMS POWERFUL Southerners Wish Revenge For Stanford Victories In Other Sports 
### Joe Carroll 
Down in Los Angeles, a certain Uni
versity of Southern California is con
fidently expecting to even up some
one-point losses in football and bas
ketball by a victory over Stanford in
track.
With a team hailed by many South
ern California critics as "the greatest
in years," the Trojans have been point
ing at their meet with Stanford this
Saturday. 1.C.4A. champions in 1926,
U.S.C. has indeed a reputation to up
hold. Revenge for defeats in other
sports is also desired.
Two Defeats
j, U.S.C. and L.A.A.C, were the only
two teams to Witt from Stanford last
year. They both won by the same
score, 67 to 64. With L.A.A.C. deci
sively put out of the way, the Cardinal
track men are preparing to do likewise
or even worse to the Trojans.
The U.S.C. team is strong, particu
larly in the sprints, pole vault, broad
jump, high jump, and hurdles. But the
Stanford squad possesses all around
power. Redshirted runners will score
heavily in many of the Trojans' favo
rite events.
High Jump
Regulation 1.C.-4A. standards will
be used in the high jump. The new
type used will permit the bar to fall
off on either side.
Bob King, who has done over 6 feet
6 inches, is favored to win this event.
Coggeshall, with a great pre-season
leap of over fi feet 5 inches, has only
cleared G feet 3-8 inches during the
season. Tom Work may beat him out

for second place. Bryant may be heard
from.
King, a junior, holds the 1.C.-4A.
title in the high jump. He was not
beaten last year, and lias not been
outjumped this season. Consistently
clearing 6 feet 2 inches, he is good
for first place in any college meet.
Captain Ed House and Charlie
Borah are expected to garner sixteen
points in the sprints. Borah's reputa
tion is well known. House has beaten
him in tlie hundred.
Chink Sauers beat Talbot of Cali
fornia last week, but he will have to
be content with a third place Satur
day. Syer or McGuire may even cut
him out of that.
Half-Mile
The half-mile will be a battle royal
with the final result a toss-up. Moss
and Clum, Stanford, and Lovejoy,
Gloege, and Adams, U.S.C., have all
run the 880 in about the same time.
Anyone of the five men can win The

1 Cardinal runners, however, should be
j goud for two places.
Rufe Ranney, Stanford, may win the
two-mile. Les Heilman, U.S.C.'s only
hope, ran a poor race last Saturday.
Field Events
The broad jump will be a real battle.
Hill and Kaer both cleared 23 feet
Saturday, each one going further than
they ever had before. Reynolds has
| done as well. Meeks, Zombro, and
: Dyer, however, are consistently above
1 23 feet. Their steady work gives the
edge in this event, although U.S.C.
will probably take a few points.
Pole Vault
Lee Barnes' best competitive vault
! this year has been 13 feet. Ward Ed
monds has also cleared this height,
j Eeither one may do 13 feet 6 inches to
win. Hulsman, if he does 12 feet (5
1 inches, as he can, should beat Wil
liams out of third place.
! Stanford is expected to win the
; relay.
