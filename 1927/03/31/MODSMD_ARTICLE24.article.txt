# CARD RUNNERS EXPECT STRONG U.S.C. OUTFIT
## Half-Mile, Broad Jump Will Be Real Battles of Saturday's Meet BOTH TEAMS POWERFUL Southerners Wish Revenge For Stanford Victories In Other Sports

track men are preparing to do likewise
or even worse to the Trojans.
The U.S.C. team is strong, particu

type used will permit the bar to fall
off on either side.
Bob King, who has done over 6 feet
6 inches, is favored to win this event.
Coggeshall, with a great pre-season
leap of over fi feet 5 inches, has only
