# They Rest on Sunday
## 
### 
Students at the University of Kansas labor for six days, and then on
the seventh they rest. But they do not like the arrangement. On the
Sabbath the Blue Laws exist at K.U. There are no Sunday movies, no
bridge playing, no dancing, and no tennis playing or other types of
sports. The students are allowed to study, and are allowed to walk in
the open if the weather permits; they are allowed to eat, and to sleep, but
that is about all.
1 he Daily Kansan bemoans the fact that entertainment is banned on
Sundays. If the student has a date and the weather permits, he may
take her for a walk, but "if the weather is bad, he can sit and discuss
books with her. Conversation is not banned. A game of bridge, however,
is unthought of on the first floor of a sorority house on Sunday. But
a game of tennis- No. A University ruling prohibits it. A movie? A
state law closes the theaters."
There is a possibility of a little "bootleg" bridge. The students might
sneak into a back room, lock the doors, pull down the shades, and indulge
in a short game of bridge. They can use the picture album as a substitute
of the moving picture shows. And they can always go to church or the
library.
What a life!
At Stanford, Sunday is queeners' day. It is the day the boy-friend
may call upon his lady-fair, and play bridge if he so wishes. Or he can
take her to any number of movies and see any number of wicked shows.
He can take her canoeing on the lake, or tennissing. Then he can take
her to the Memorial Church, too, if he and she are so inclined. And, of
course, the library is open to the more industrious members of the college.
The roads on the Peninsula are all open and beckoning on the Sabbath.
The hills are ideal places for rides or picnics, and they are taken advan
tage of by the large majority of the population of Stanford.
