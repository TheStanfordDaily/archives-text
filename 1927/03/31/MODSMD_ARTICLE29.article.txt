# 1930's Chance
## 
### 
With Coach Husky Hunt's freshman baseball squad diminishing almost
to the danger margin there comes an opportunity for the first-year men to
show that though they have discarded the dinks, they are still behind
Stanford's activities. Losses to the originally small squad have come
through injuries, scholastic difficulties, and a general attitude of disin
terestedness on the part of some of those who turned out.
There was a time when baseball almost ranked with football in student
interest as an intercollegiate sport. The rapid rise of professional baseball
in general popularity has frequently been given as the reason for the decline
of the interest in the college sport. However, this reason cannot be given
as the direct one for the scant turnout of freshman baseball candidates with
which Hunt has to work and to prepare material for future varsity squads.
An appeal in the old "rah-rah" way would be worse than useless to
get more candidates for Husky's team. The decline of that spirit has
resulted, it seems, for some of the sports to lose in general support. Be
that as it may, freshmen who have any ability or interest in baseball should
turn out to assist in the Class of 1930's chance to secure revenge for the
Golden Bear Cubs' victories in football and basketball.
