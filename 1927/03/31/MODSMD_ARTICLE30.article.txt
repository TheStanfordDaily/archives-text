# Stanford Out of Step
## 
### 
Johns Hopkins, which has a reputation of being a somewhat staid and
conservative university in the staid and conservative city of Baltimore,
had its student riot last week. It may not have been quite so tumultuous
as the one Harvard pulled off on its dignified campus or some other
recent college turmoils, but the police participated both offensively and
defensively before the affair was completed and in addition to many
minor casualties there was at least one skull so vigorously clubbed that
it may have been broken, and hospitals gave attention to several other
college men.
What's the matter with Stanford in this line of activity? Nearly
every university of standing in the country seems to be following the
fashion, which like many other fashions is a revival or reversion to
styles of older days, but Stanford has so far given no hint that it
realizes that recent styles of collegiate conduct, by which university
undergraduates behave themselves about the same as other young men
are expected to, have gone out that it is the proper thing now to dig up
the manners of the '60's, '7O's, and '80's.
But if the Stanford undergraduates can stand it to behave like
normal young men of their age, the rest of us will be able to stand it, too.
Here in Pak) Alto, certainly, we'd much prefer to have our police em
ployed in some other activity than in clubbing Stanford Students. â€”Daily
