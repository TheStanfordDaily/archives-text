TURNING BACK THE HANDS
For some reason or other the aver
age college faculty labors under the
misapprehension that there is a crying
necessity for protecting the young
men and women entrusted to their
caer from the temptations that beset
the ordinary mortal. The history of
American universities shows a start
ling number of examples in point. The
latest comes from Princeton, wfcere
the student body is still chaffing under
the action of the Dean in prohibiting
the use of automobiles on the campus.
This sort of thing is simply a legis
lative manifestation of the "good old
days" complex. Certain older people,
believing deep in their hearts that the
country is on its w r ay to the bow-wows,
seek an explanation. Ordinarily they
assume that there is some sort of con
nection between the superficial, mech
anical changes in the lives of two
generations and the mort fundamental,
moral changes. In this day one hears
that the fast, loose life of the modern
youth has something to do with the
rapid advances made in mechanical
development.
Acting on the supposition that the
moral laxity of the age is the effect
and the automobile the cause, the
faculties of certain universities con
vince themselves that they are doing
their students a favor by prohibiting
the use of machines.
All very well. It is a fine, fat theory.
But does it work out in practice? It
does not. The practical effect of such
legislation is to produce first and

| foremost an unfavorable reaction on
the part of the student body and to
ward the faculty. Next there is a
weakening of student character by
the arbitrary removal of temptations.
It is simply an unhealthy and un
natural continuation of the apron
string and hoarding school mode of
life. The student is robbed of an op
portunity to decide for himself
whether he will stay home and work
or go out in the car and play. Later on
in life he will have to decide that
same problem. College should by
; rights be the place where the average
young man or woman works out that
problem.
j Fortunately, at Stanford the matter
of automobiles has *been left in the
hands of the associated students. Some
few years ago a prohibitive statute
1 was proposed. At an election, the stu
| dent body promptly and intelligently
J quashed it. It is to be hoped that
Stanford will never have to cope with
i anything like Princeton's latest tribu
lation. There to be gained
| by arbitrarily imposing upon a college
! student body the conditions of life
: that prevailed a generation ago, even
on the theory that those conditions
! made for a higher moral standard.

A THRUST IN THE BACK
It may have been an error, but the
following appeared in a recent edi
torial in the Palo Alto Time,s:
. . . there was at least one skull
so vigorously clubbed that it may have
been broken, and hospitals gave at
j tention to many other college men."

TURNING BACK THE HANDS
For some reason or other the aver
age college faculty labors under the
misapprehension that there is a crying
necessity for protecting the young
men and women entrusted to their
caer from the temptations that beset
the ordinary mortal. The history of
American universities shows a start
ling number of examples in point. The
latest comes from Princeton, wfcere
the student body is still chaffing under
the action of the Dean in prohibiting
the use of automobiles on the campus.
This sort of thing is simply a legis
lative manifestation of the "good old
days" complex. Certain older people,
believing deep in their hearts that the
country is on its w r ay to the bow-wows,
seek an explanation. Ordinarily they
assume that there is some sort of con
nection between the superficial, mech
anical changes in the lives of two
generations and the mort fundamental,
moral changes. In this day one hears
that the fast, loose life of the modern
youth has something to do with the
rapid advances made in mechanical
development.
Acting on the supposition that the
moral laxity of the age is the effect
and the automobile the cause, the
faculties of certain universities con
vince themselves that they are doing
their students a favor by prohibiting
the use of machines.
All very well. It is a fine, fat theory.
But does it work out in practice? It
does not. The practical effect of such
legislation is to produce first and

| foremost an unfavorable reaction on
the part of the student body and to
ward the faculty. Next there is a
weakening of student character by
the arbitrary removal of temptations.
It is simply an unhealthy and un
natural continuation of the apron
string and hoarding school mode of
life. The student is robbed of an op
portunity to decide for himself
whether he will stay home and work
or go out in the car and play. Later on
in life he will have to decide that
same problem. College should by
; rights be the place where the average
young man or woman works out that
problem.
j Fortunately, at Stanford the matter
of automobiles has *been left in the
hands of the associated students. Some
few years ago a prohibitive statute
1 was proposed. At an election, the stu
| dent body promptly and intelligently
J quashed it. It is to be hoped that
Stanford will never have to cope with
i anything like Princeton's latest tribu
lation. There to be gained
| by arbitrarily imposing upon a college
! student body the conditions of life
: that prevailed a generation ago, even
on the theory that those conditions
! made for a higher moral standard.

A THRUST IN THE BACK
It may have been an error, but the
following appeared in a recent edi
torial in the Palo Alto Time,s:
. . . there was at least one skull
so vigorously clubbed that it may have
been broken, and hospitals gave at
