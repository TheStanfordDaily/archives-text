## Golh Alphabet—A 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
A Golf Alphabet is hereby launched
upon the water hazards of an eagerly
waiting public. Read, mark, and in
wardly digest, and you'll be surprised,
as I was, how many prominent link
stars there are and have been whose
last names begin with the first letter
of the alphabet.
We all know about Tommy Armour,
whose name has appeared up near the
top in so many tournaments this past
winter, and John G. Anderson who,
when he isn't running the Millrose
Games in New York City, has time
to drop over to France and bring back
the amateur championship of that
country, but how many others could
you name? Laurie Ayton and his
brother Alex are quite well known as
pros and tournament players, while j
Ellsworth Augustus is a prominent '
amateur of Cleveland, and "Scotty" !
Armstrong the same in Los Angeles.
Let us delve into the record books
and find A's of bygone days who have
achieved fame by keeping to the
straight and narrow path from tee to 1
green. Back in 1897 Willie Anderson
of Watch Hill, R. 1., was runner-up in
the United States open championship.
To show that he was no flash in the
pan, Willie won the tournament in
3901 after a play-off with Aleck Smith,
and then won it unchallenged in 1903,
1904, and 1905. One reason Anderson
didn't win in 190>2, was that another
"A," Lawrence Auchterlonie, of the
Glen View Club, captured the honors.
Auchterlonie, like Anderson, is a
famous name in golf history. David

'■ and William Auchterlonie are club
makers at St. Andrews, Scotland. Wil
! lie won the British open title in 1893.
Besides Lawrence, who strayed to
j America, there is also Tom. Some fam
jily! And don't overlook Mr. A. J. T.
Allan, winner of the British amateur
crown in 1897.
How about the ladies —the little "In-
I nocents A-broad" on the golf courses?
Miss Bessie Anthony was U.S. wo
; men's champion in 1903, the same year
i that Miss Rhona Adair won the British
j title for the second time. Miss Molly
| Adams was the runner-up in the U.S.
tournament three years later.
Also, Address the ball" —"Approach"
! —"Away"—and "Attaboy!"

Ellsworth Augustus is a prominent '
amateur of Cleveland, and "Scotty" !
Armstrong the same in Los Angeles.
Let us delve into the record books
and find A's of bygone days who have
achieved fame by keeping to the
straight and narrow path from tee to 1
green. Back in 1897 Willie Anderson
of Watch Hill, R. 1., was runner-up in
the United States open championship.
To show that he was no flash in the
pan, Willie won the tournament in
3901 after a play-off with Aleck Smith,
and then won it unchallenged in 1903,
1904, and 1905. One reason Anderson
didn't win in 190>2, was that another
"A," Lawrence Auchterlonie, of the
Glen View Club, captured the honors.
Auchterlonie, like Anderson, is a
famous name in golf history. David

'■ and William Auchterlonie are club
makers at St. Andrews, Scotland. Wil
! lie won the British open title in 1893.
Besides Lawrence, who strayed to
j America, there is also Tom. Some fam
jily! And don't overlook Mr. A. J. T.
Allan, winner of the British amateur
crown in 1897.
How about the ladies —the little "In-
I nocents A-broad" on the golf courses?
Miss Bessie Anthony was U.S. wo
; men's champion in 1903, the same year
i that Miss Rhona Adair won the British
j title for the second time. Miss Molly
| Adams was the runner-up in the U.S.
tournament three years later.
Also, Address the ball" —"Approach"
! —"Away"—and "Attaboy!"

A Golf Alphabet is hereby launched
upon the water hazards of an eagerly
waiting public. Read, mark, and in
wardly digest, and you'll be surprised,
as I was, how many prominent link
stars there are and have been whose
last names begin with the first letter
of the alphabet.
We all know about Tommy Armour,
whose name has appeared up near the
top in so many tournaments this past
winter, and John G. Anderson who,
when he isn't running the Millrose
Games in New York City, has time
to drop over to France and bring back
the amateur championship of that
country, but how many others could
you name? Laurie Ayton and his
brother Alex are quite well known as
pros and tournament players, while j
