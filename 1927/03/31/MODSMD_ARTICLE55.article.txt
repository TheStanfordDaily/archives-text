# Social Calendar "Borrowed" Dateless Quarter for "500" Campus Parties in Danger
##

j "No more dates, unless the Date
Book is returned." This strained situa
tion may become the bewailing cry of
members of both the 500<and five times
| the 500, unless some daring signer of
the Honor System pledge returns the
Executive Committee's Date Book.
The "social calendar" of the Uni
versity has been missing since the
; beginning of the spring recess. The
members of the Executive Committee
j here made an earnest request that the
; book return as soon as possible, in
j order that the campus social functions
can be carried on as pre-arranged.
