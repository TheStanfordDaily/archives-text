# OPENING GAME AGAINST BEARS SET TOMORROW
## Diamond Contest Starts at 3 O'Clock to Allow for Track Meet OPENS BASEBALL SERIES Wolter Says Only Morning Showers Will Cause Postponement 
### 
Although the recent rains have put a
temporary halt to baseball practicc and
threaten to cause the postponement of the
first game of the series with the Univer
sity of California scheduled for Satur
day, Coach Harry Wolter definitely an
nounced yesterday that the game with
the Bears will he played Saturday morn
ing or afternoon unless it rains.
Coach Wolter has not definitely de
cided upon his starting battery, but it is
expected that Captain Steve Collins will
be called upon to pitch, with Cook Sy
pher holding down his regular job behind
the bat. If Collins is unable to start, how
ever, John Sobieski will be used with Bob
Philippi as relief man.
Bears Receive Setback
The University of California received
a setback in the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association standing Wednesday
when Santa Clara took a thirteen-inning
contest from the Bears by a 1 to 0 score.
Stanford took two games out of three
from Santa Clara early in the season,
while California is now even with the
Broncos.
The Cardinal infield has been strength
ened considerably since the southern in
vasion during spring vacation, and as a
result Coach Wolter hopes to present a
formidable defense against Coach Carl
Zamioch's men. The infield will be made
up of Maguire at first, Garibaldi at sec
ond, Busch at shortstop, and Harder at
third. Nissen, Wilton, and Stewart will
compose the outfield, forming one of the
strongest combinations in the association.
Hard to Dope
While neither Stanford nor U.C. is
leading the association, a clean sweep by
either squad will make that team a dan
gerous contender for the California title.
However, both nines have won and lost
nearly the same number of games, and
the winner cannot be doped out by com
parative scores.
The contest is scheduled to start at 3
o'clock, in order that fans may attend
both the track meet and the baseball
game.
