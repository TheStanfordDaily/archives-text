# SCHIPA'S CONCERT CLOSES BRILLIANT A.S.S.U. SERIES
## SINGER HAS PERSONALITY Managers Are Making Plans For Similar Concerts Next Season 
### Herbert Klein 
Announcement that another-and- j
greater-concert series will be engaged
next year featured the successful re- j
cital of Tito Scliipa, premier lyric j
tenor of the Chicago Grand Opera j
Company given in the Basketball Pa- j
vilion last night. With the last notes
of Schipa's final encore of many
eagerly demanded encores, the 1926-27 !
Associated Students concert series
came to a brilliant close, with finan
cial success assured, and artistic suc
cess highly commended declared by
all its patrons.
Schipa proved himself a vocalist of'
sweetness and grace rather than of
power; he is well-termed a 1 yric,
rather than a dramatic, tenor. In his
upper registers, especially in his soft
head tones he showed to best advan- j
tave. His personality was charming,'
without the slightest degree of stiff
ness, yet totally devoid of all affecta
tion of gesture or mannerism in sing
ing. Schipa knows how to take his â– 
bows so that he is called back for
more.
Second Group Typical
His second group of operatic selec- j
I
tions, "Manon," and as an encore, j
"Ah, Like a Dream," from "Martha," |
gave an opportunity for just the sort
of thing that Schipa can do to per
fection. Whenever flowing, graceful j
melody was found, the sniger seemed
to literally swing into the spirit. A
later encore, Liszt's famous "Luebe
straum," was memorable. After hear
ing it, one could understand why it
has come to be one of the numbers
most often requested in his repertoire.
The swelling emotion and almost sen
timental longing contained in the
original piano version were retained
admirably i lithe vocal rendition.
In the last half of the program,
Schipa sang some of his most charm
ing and melodious numbers, spirited
and sunny Italian tunes, never
"heavy," provoking nothing more seri
ous than a smile, but never failing to
achieve that. Some were in synco
pated rhythm, almost jazzed, and all
were very much alive. Among the
many final encores the "Woman Is
Fickle" aria from Verdi's "Rigoletto"
and "O Sole Mio," sung last of all,
were undoubtedly the highlights. The
former was rendered with a careless
gaiety that seemed to mark Schipa as
being made for the part of the Duke
in the opera. "O Sole Mio" was a tri
umphant flood of mellow tone, worthy
to end the concert.
Jos6 Echaniz, the accompanist, was
rather heavy in his solo numbers. His
playing lacked the nuances of loud
and soft that a number like his first,
Chopin's "Scherzo," demanded, and
the imagination that another, a
Brahm's Waltz, should have had.
Technically, he was very capable.
