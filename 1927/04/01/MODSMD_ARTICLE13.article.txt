### 
In order to safeguard the informal
character of his Thursday Evening
Conferences at his home, Dr. Jordan
has requested that his talks on these
occasions shall not be reported In the
newspapers. He desires that the con
ferences shall retain their character
of informal talks with his guests and
that he be free to speak altogether
spontaneously without the necessity
of being on his guard lest some of his
off-hand remarks about minor matters
appear as expressions of opinion.
Dr. Jordan's purpose in holding
these weekly meetings at his home
with students and others who may be
interested, has been to keep the tone
much like tliat of a conversation
among friends, and if this tone cannot
be retained he says he would prefer
to end the conferences altogether.
