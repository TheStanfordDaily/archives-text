# Revivalist Open Fire On Ancient Stanford Custom
## 
### 
Revivals —ranging from l-pligious
meetings to Henry Ford's old-fash
ioned dances —are the thing this year,
so Skull and Snakes, with the co-opera
tion of Cap and Gown, are reviving an
old Stanford tradition in the all-cam
pus jolly-up, which is being held in
the Basketball Pavilion tonight. In
formal freshman jolly-ups—attended
mostly by upperclassmen—are given
quite frequently at Roble, but this is
the first time in several years that an
all-University dance has been held.
Skull and Snakes, men's honorary
society, has organized the festivities
in order to raise money for their fund
that they use to send books and
pamphlets concerning Stanford to
high schools. And, since every dance
of necessity needs women. Cap and
Gown, senior women's honorary or
ganization, has agreed to furnish
enough of the 500 to keep the stag
line busy.
During the week the two groups
have been perfecting plans for the
jolly-up. Men will be assessed the
paltry fee of fifty cents, and women
will not only be admitted free of
charge, but will be furnished free
transportation on trucks taxied by the
experienced Skullers and Snakers.
The Brooks-Worthington orchestra
will provide the music, beginning at 9
and ending at 1 o'clock.
