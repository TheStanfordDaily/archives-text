# "FRENCH PROBLEMS IN ITALY" ANNOUNCED AS JOFFRE DEBATE TOPIC
## 
### 
French problems in Italy since the
' armistice will be the general topic of the
; Joffre debate this year to be held here
! April 14. This general topic is given each
j year three months in advance of the de
bate and then two hours before the de
bate occurs a specific problem is chosen in
the field of the general topic.
Stanford's entrants are Beverly Mc-
Anear, John Truman, and Fred Com
bellack. McAriear is a sophomore, enter
ing his first intercollegiate debate. His!
work on the squad that is working on the
crime debate was of such a caliber as to
merit his transfer to the Joffre team.
Truman is a junior; he participated in j
the debate with California last fall on the
| open shop question. Combellack is a jun
j ior; he debated last year and went on the
eastern tour this year. Reports from the
! east credited him with exceptionally fine
j work on the tour.
The Joffre debate was established as an
j annual forensic event by Pierre de Cou
| bertin in 1895. Coubertin offered the
j medal in honor of Sadi Carnot, martyred
; French president. It was originally des
! ignated the ''Medaille Carnot' ; however,
I in 1917 it was changed to the "Medaille
! Joffre" in honor of France's great war
i marshal.
The medal is awarded to the student
!of California or Stanford making the
! best individual showing in an annual
| forensic contest between the two uni-
I versifies. The purpose of the debates is
jto encourage student interest in French
problems and politics.
Stanford won the debate from 1922
| through 1925. Two of the winners are
I still on the campus; they are Robert Lit
i ler and John Duniway. A California
| woman, Ruth Clouse, won the debate last
1 year. She was the first woman to entei
j the debate. This year California is enter
| ing another woman.
