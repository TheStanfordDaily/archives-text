# STANFORD-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CLASH IN DUAL MEET TOMORROW
## Individual Competition in Events Strong; Hard To Dope U.S.C. HAS POWER TO WIN Hoffman Will Insure Heavy Advantage for Cards In Weights 
### Joe Carroll 
\\ lien Cardinal meets Trojan in actual
combat tomorrow afternoon at the Sta
dium, the intercollegiate dual meet cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast will be
settled. Stanford University and the Uni
versity of Southern California arc both
possessed of powerful track squads, but
the Stanford men remember the U.S.C.
victory last year and are determined to
win from the Troajns so decisively that
there will be no doubt as to the final out
come.
Anyone is entitled to a guess as to the
outcome of the individual events. Under
stress of competition, and with so much
at stake, outstanding performances in all
lines may be confidently expected. Just
who will turn in these performances, how
ever, cannot be said in advance of actual
competition. This meet can hardly be
doped properly. Too many things must
be taken into consideration. Too many
men are capable of great effort. U.S.C.
could win if the Trojan performers equal
their best marks of the season.
Reynolds Important
Many Trojan points depend upon the
appearance of Cliff Reynolds, high hurd
ler, and the men entered in the high jump
and broad jump. Latest reports say that
Reynolds will compete only in the hurdles.
Hill and Kaer will handle the broad
jump.
The list of events with the names of
the men who wiH figure in the final out
come shows that an "upset" could occur
anywhere along the line.
Charlie Borah, Captain Ed House, and
Richman should take the places in the
sprints, tfte Trojans taking sixteen points
and Richman two.
Spencer, Captain Babcock; Syer, and
Sauers will do their part in the 444).
Clum, Moss, Dales, Stanford, and Love
joy, Gloege, and Adams are a toss-up in
the half.
Unruh Should Win Mile
Unruh should win the mile, with Mc-
Kinnon and Swain second and third.
Ranney may win the two-mile, with
Heilman second and anyone who can
finish third.
Reynolds and Webber are Trojan hopes
in the high hurdles. Nichols, West, and
Bu!lis will fight for points with them.
The three Stanford men will also enter
tain Kaer and Graham in the lows.
The broad jump is anyone's event, with
five or six men over 23 feet. Hill, Kaer,
and Reynolds, Trojans, and Dyer, Zom
bro, and Meeks, Stanford, all have a
chance.
Weights Stanford's
The shot put and discus look all Stap
fordr Biff Hoffman should be good for
ten points here. Forster and Fleishhacker
in the shot and Evans and Way in the
discus will garner seconds and thirds.

Aleski, Trojan strong man, is the U.S.C.
hope in both events.
Joaquin, Shipkev, and Sparling can
take a!! the places in the javelin Roellrr
is the only U.S.C. man capable of even
a third.
The pole vault presents tremendous
possibilities with Lee Barnes, Williams,
and Edmonds, who have all cleared 13
feet this season in competition. Hulsman
and Ruiz are both to be heard from.
King or Coggeshall?
The high jump is also due for strenu
ous work. Coggeshall has come close to
6 feet 6 inches. King has cleared 6 feet
6 inches. Work has been consistent at
6 feet 2. Bryant, Qfstad, and Bowen may
sneak into a tie for second or third with
any of these men.
Stanford will win the relay. "Practice
in passing the baton will help to cut
down the time. U.S.C., however, may
hold out a couple of fresh men in hope
of winning.
