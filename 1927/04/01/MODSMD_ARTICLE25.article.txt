# Another Waterloo
## 
### 
The Trojans are encamped 011 the outskirts of the Stanford stadium
â€”the Cardinal stronghold. The track squad from the south will attack
the Redshirts tomorrow at 2:15 o'clock in what is predicted to be the
greatest battle of the year. Last year the University of Southern Cali
fornia won the final encounter of the season by sweeping all before them
in the 1.C.4-A affair in the East, but the Trojans have not quite recovered
from the casualties of this meet. Houser, Dye, Grumbles, Niersbach, and
Cook, heroes all, fought their last battle for U.S.C. that day.
General Cromwell and Captain House brought their army of track
athletes back to Los Angeles to winter. They have been trying to reor
ganize the squad this spring, ami they have succeeded in no small degree.
So far this year the Trojans have advanced right through all comers,
until they have finally reached the Stanford stronghold. Both Stanford
and L T .S.C. will be fighting tomorrow for the honors of the coast.
This year Templeton's charges have made even more impressive per
formances than have Cromwell's men. While LT.S.C. has been advancing
from the south, Stanford has been camped in the north awaiting their
assault. The Redshirts are in a better position.
