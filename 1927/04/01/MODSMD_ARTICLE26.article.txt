Stanford and California meet tomorrow in the first game of the 1927
baseball series. The time of the contest has been so arranged that track
followers will be able to witness the greater part of the match after the
Stanford-U.S.C. track meet is completed.
With Stanford and California both having won one major sport this
season, the result of the baseball game is important. The supremacy of
the year rests largely upon the outcome of the diamond affair. A win in
baseball for California would mean that Stanford would have to be
victorious in the remaining two sports —track and tennis —to be pro
claimed the sport winner for the year 1926-27.
The game itself is interesting for the fact that both nines appear from
the dope from previous contests to be practically on a par. The pre
liminary matches of the two squads are about the same in view of
successes and failures.
