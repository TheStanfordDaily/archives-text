The Stanford Department of Journalism will be host today to a
number of visiting professional journalists. Editors and representatives
from a number of California newspapers will be on the campus today to
discuss matters of mutual concern in the journalistic field and to hear
the results of some research work conducted by members of the Stanford
Journalism Department.
It is well that such contact between the professional and the teaching
fields of journalism has been made, for each has much to offer the other.
When Pulitzer instituted the teaching of journalism at Columbia I ni
versity in 1912, bitter opposition to the move was made by many pro
fessional editors. However, since that time the curricula of the various
schools have been built up and modified so as to approach more accurately
what the "man in the field'' desires. Yet at the same time schools of
journalism have tempered the instruction with generalizations and ob
servations unobtainable in any other way â€”unless by valuable years
of work.
The meeting today is, then, but another step in the processes of per
fecting journalism instruction so as to provide more suitable material for
potential newspapermen and in giving editors a more clear understanding
of the professor's problems.
