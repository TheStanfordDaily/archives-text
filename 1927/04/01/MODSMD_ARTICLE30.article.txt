A RAY OF LIGHT—LITERALLY
AND FIGURATIVELY
In the news of an average day there
are innumerable items calculated to
convince the average young collegian
that the people of this world are a
low lot and that the days of idealism
are over. Occasionally, in an obscure
corner of a news page, he runs across
some little story that again arouses
hope for human nature. The other day
a yarn went over the wire from the
University of Wisconsin that proved
there is at least one unselfish humani
tarian alive in this age of material
ism.
He is Professor Henry Steinbock,
who recently patented a process for
putting certain qualities of sunlight
into cereal foods in such quantities

i as to prevent rickets, dread disease of
J the bones. Manufacturers of cereals
J offered Professor Steinbock millions of
dollars for the rights to his process.
He refused them, saying, "If I took
that money, it would mean that the
, purpose of my life had been per
verted. I am happy only in the en
j deavor to enhance the well-being of
humanity."
For five long years Professor Stein
bock worked in a laboratory to per
-1 feet his process. The story of his
achievement attracted little attention,
for it broke on a day when the guns
were roaring in Shanghai. It is un
! fortunate that civilization's great ad
vances are not a trifle more spec
tacular. If they were, the average
young collegian might be somewhat
more an optimist.
