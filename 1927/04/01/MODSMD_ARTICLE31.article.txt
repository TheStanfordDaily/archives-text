"UNDER THE TONTO RIM." By
Zane Grey. Harpers. New York.
Since Zane Grey became a writer of
books on fishing, shooting, and what i
not, he apparently has modified his
manner of writing western tales be
cause in "Under The Tonto Rim" the
first shot is not fired until page 176,
and then oflly a wild turkey is slain.
The first and only shot fatal to a man
in this novel does not arrive until
page 252, which indicates what one
may expect in Mr. Grey's most recent j
novel.
This, however, is far from adverse
criticism, because the author more
than makes up in the way of colorful
description and originality of plot what
has been sacrificed in the way of ac
tion.
The story concerns Lucy Watson,
who goes to the "high country" to do
welfare work among the isolated
backwoods people. She begins her
work in the Denmeade home, there
meeting Edd Denmeade, eldest son,
who is a wild bee hunter and a typical
backwoodsman. Edd and Bud Sprall,
a villainous sort of young addict to
white mule liquor, are enemies, and
when Edd takes Lucy to a .dance she !
unwittingly dances with Bud.
Later there comes to live with Lucy,
her youngest sister, Clara Watson,
who had eloped with a worthless cow
boy, only to be deserted before their
marriage. Clara and Joe Denmeade
fall in love and are secretly married,
soon after which the father of Clara's
son appears. During a scuffle Edd
shoots the scamp. Lucy informs Edd.
who, of course, loves her, that the)

man he killed was the father of her
own son, thereby protecting Clara.
Edd and Lucy are married, and
I Clara confesses her past to Joe and is
forgiven, so that it is a very tame
| story after all; since everybody other
| than Bud Sprall, who was badly
! mauled by Edd, and Clara's betrayer,
! who was slain, live happily ever after.

Apparently we are soon to get the
straight of this "the woman tempted
j me and I fell" business. Gossip has
j drifted this way to the effect that
! John Erskine, the scorner of mossy
j traditions, that demolislier of respec
table old idols, is now working on a
new version of the story of Adam and
Eve. One is disposed to point out the
lamentable example of a certain Mr.
Scopes,, and to stage-whisper a warn
ing: "Look out. John Erskine, or the
Fundamentalists will get you, too!"
Meanwhile it is to be assumed that a
! certain Mr. Mencken is rolling a deli
cious morsel under his tongue and
getting ready to point a new finger of
scorn at human credulity. Is it too
much to hope that the sub-title of
"Adam and Eve" will be: "Enough
! About the Apple to Refute Its Reputa
j tion"?

Arrived in this week's mail a volume
I entitled "Lucky Numbers;" perpetrated
by Mr. Montague Glass and printed by
Doubleday, Page & Co. This book will
not be left around my desk. I read
therein among other things: "A lady
who could still dance at 50 ain't got no
excuse why she shouldn't have gotten
i married at 20."
