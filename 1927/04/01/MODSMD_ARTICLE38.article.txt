# PORTENT OF GERMAN ENTRY INTO LEAGUE IS CONTEST SUBJECT
## Professor Cooper Announces Essay Competition for Attractive Prizes 
### 
"The Significance of Germany's En
trance into the League of Nations" is the
subject of a national essay-writing con
test, just announced here by Professor
William A. ( ooper of the German de
partment, who asks that any students who
are interested see him immediately.
The entrance of Germany into the
League on September 10, 1926, is gen
erally regarded as perhaps the most sig
nificant event of post-war history. It
marks, potentially at least, the passing of
an era in Franco-German relations during
which wars and the preparation for wars
were well-nigh constant and the begin
ning of a new period in which the co
operation of France and Germany in
maintaining peace in Europe may be an
example to the world.
Marks New Spirit
As the event is significant of a new
spirit on the part of both Germany and
France, it will have far-reaching conse
ciuences in the policies of all nations,
particularly Russia and Great Britain.
Possibly the United States will be influ
enced by it to a noticeable degree. Ger
many's post-war problems are now re
ceiving more sympathetic consideration,
and a spirit of tolerance and optimism
is beginning to replace the fear and sus
picion which characterized the years imÂ«
mediately after the war.
Student Prizes
Six prizes will be awarded college stu
dents, the first award being $100. Men
and women doing work in the depart
ments of modern languages, history., po
litical science, economics, and philosophy
are particularly urged to participate. The
papers must adhere strictly to the sub
ject "The Significance of Germany's En
trance into the League of Nations," but
may treat the topic in any way the writer
wishes and come to any conclusions which
seem justifiable to the writer.
Professor Cooper is a member of the
supervising committee in charge of the
project, which is open now and lasts
until June 30. He advises that preparation
should begin with a careful study of Doc
tor Streseman's and M. Briand's speeches
on the subject, and he will recommend
other reference books to students inter
ested in entering the contest.
