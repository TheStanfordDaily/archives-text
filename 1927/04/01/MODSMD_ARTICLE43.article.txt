Extra! Extra! Babe Ruth defeats
Jose Capablanca in a chess match!
Babe reached the finals, in spite of a
bad charley horse, by clean-cut de
feats of Bogojujubeebe, of Russia;
Tartar sauce, of Austria; and Chin
wisker, of Czechoslovakia. He got the
charley horse in his throat, it is
claimed, by trying to pronounce his
opponents' names.
When the referee called "Play
Chess!" the Bambino opened with a
counter gapibit off the right-field wall.
Capablanca succeeded in trapping
Ruth's bishop between first and sec
ond, and running it down, but in the
meantime our hero had scored from
K-84.
Here Capablanca made a master
stroke, putting over P-Rr, R-QSch, and
B x R in succession. "Check-mate,"
yelled the referee. To which the Bam

j bino expostulated so loudly that the
last one was a bit wide that Capa
blanca was forced to make another
move. He deliberated for fully half an
hour, complaining frequently that the
noise of Ruth's chewing tobacco dis
turbed him. Finally he played 16-K —
QK3, Tinker to Evers to Chance, and
a look of triumph came over ' his
swarthy countenance. When the Babe
realized what had happened, his chub
by face turned an ashen gray and
beads of perspiration stuck out on his
forehead. "My pawn!" he hissed be
tween clenched teeth. "He's got my
pawn!"
"Quite right," smiled Capablanca.
"Three balls make a pawn shop. Heh
| heh!" "But four balls mean a free trip
I to first base!" yelled the mighty Bam
i bino in a rage, and seizing his castle,
i he walloped his opponent's king com

pletely out of the stadium, then trot
ted slowly around the chess board, I
being careful to touch all the corners. !
"Good knight! I am rooked," moaned
Capablanca as he swooned away. The
band then played "Chess, we have no
bananas!"
