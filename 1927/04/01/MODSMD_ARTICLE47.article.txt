BERKELEY, Mar. 1.—Despite the
reputation that Coach Rusty Callow's
Washington crews have made for them
selves from coast to coast, the Calilornia
.varsity is now being given a new chance
to defeat the Huskies for the first time
since 1921. Yesterday the Bears swept
over the estuary waters in fine time, using
a rather slow but impressively powerful
stroke. Ebright is now using Donlon,
Fredericks, Thompson, Rylander, Dress
ier, Stalder, Hutchinson, and Von Tillow
in the shell.
