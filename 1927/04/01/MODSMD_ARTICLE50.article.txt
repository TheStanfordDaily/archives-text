# REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE DECLARED HARMFUL
## 
### 
"Selective admission requirements for
college entrance have thus far tended to
work in the wrong direction in matters
of health, for they spur on the highly
organized type of student to greater strain
with resulting over-fatigue and less
chance for ultimate success in life,"
claims Dr. William Emerson, special in
vestigator, in an article written for the
April issue of the Woman's Home Com
panion.
"Perhaps nowhere do we find a better
demonstration of the effects of low stan
dards of health and of low health intelli
gence than among students entering col
lege," he continues. "Half of these young
men and women are below par in weight
and a large group of from 20 to 30 per
cent exhibit practically all of the signs
of poor physical condition. A student who
has succeeded in meeting higher educa
tional standards at the cost of his health
needs to be physically 'conditioned.'"
The twenty men excelling in scholar
ship at Harvard last year achieved no
place in athletics, the article points out.
"Under our present system," Dr. Emer
son concluded, "an unfortunate choice is
necessary. The man who would excel in
mental achievement must sacrifice his
body, while the athlete cannot hope for
honors in both the physical and mental
fields without danger. One chooses the
out-of-door life necessary for physical
exercise and accomplishment. The other
accepts an indoor life which makes for
lowered health conditions, and is at a tre
mendous disadvantage mentally as well as
physically."
