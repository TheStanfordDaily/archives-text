# CALIFORNIA BASEBALL TEAM OPPOSES BABES SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## Small-Sized Cardinal Squad May Be Handicapped Through Injuries 
### 
Playing tlieir first gamÂ© of the Stan
ford-California freshman baseball
series at 3:30 o'clock tomorrow after
noon on the Berkeley diamond, the
Cardinal babes will be represented by
a squad which equals the strength of
the Bear Cubs, but which is decidedly
handicapped by a lack of players.
Coach Husky Hunt will take all of
his available men, twelve in number,
*to the University of California
grounds. His squad numbered twenty
five at the beginning of the season
but failure to meet the entrance and
scholarship requirements cut it to the
present size.
The men that will make the trip
are Haddenfeldt, first base; Storey,
second base; Laird, third base; Berg,
shortstop; Pease, right field; Levin,
left field; and Murphy, center field.
Simkins pitching, and Sparks catching;
will be the freshman battery. Substi
tutes will be Leverenz, pitcher, and
Nye, fielder. Bianchi, shortstop, who
sprained hie ankle last week, will go
with the team, although he will be
unable to play.
With Simkins in the box for the
Stanford beginners, and Meyers for
the Bears, a pitching duel is prom
ised. Simkins has shown plenty of
speed and good control and hop on a
fast ball. Hamilton will start behind
the plate for California.
The Cardinal infield is fast, although
the smoothness of its functioning was
liaulted by the shifting of Berg to
fill Bianchi's place at shortstop. The
outfield is not as strong, lacking ex
perience. It has been weak in previous
games, but in practice against the
varsity Wednesday afternoon, a de
| cided improvement was noticed.
A captain to lead the freshmen
through the series will be elected this
! afternoon.
