# CHINESE LECTORER TO SPEAK TONIGHT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## DR. HU SHIH REFORMER Intellectual Renaissance in China Topic of Noted Foreign Radical 
### 
I Dr. Hu Shih, considered the fore
i most modern thinker in China, will
speak on "The Chinese Intellectual
Renaissance" tonight at 8 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall.
Dr. Hu is professedly a radical in
his views. In 1917 he published a
series of articles advocating the radi
cal reform in the Chinese Literature
of abandoning the classic language for
the more common vernacular of the
people. It was through his efforts that
the Chinese "literary revolution" came
about.
He was ranked by a poll of Chinese
opinion as one of the twelve greatest
living men of his nation when he was
only twenty-seven years old.
Important Effect
The effect of the use of the vernacu
lar in writing books was to open
knowledge to great masses of people
from whom it had been hidden by the
difficulty of mastering the classical
tongue. Moreover, it led to the re
markable "Thousand-Character Move
ment," by which hundreds of thou
sands of illiterate Chinese, through a
j simplification of the written language,
have been taught to read during the
last few years, bringing about the most
rapid mass education achievement in
the history of any nation. This radical
change in the national language was
effective in promoting a complete
change in the social and intellectual |
attitude of the Chinese.
