# STANFORD SWIMMING CAPTAIN WITHDRAWS ENTRY IN MARATHON
## 
### 
Acting under the advice of Coach
Ernst Brandsten, Carl Stevenson,
I Stanford swimming captain, has with
drawn his intention to compete in the
Santa Cruz ocean marathon swim.
Brandsten believes that by May 20
Stevenson will not be sufficiently ac
-1 customed to the temperature of the
j Santa Cruz water, which will be be
tween 56 and 58 by the date of the
race. The water at Searsville Lake is
gradually becoming warmer, so that
there is no training place within rea
i sonable distance.
Stevenson ordinarily swims the half
mile and mile races, and the three
and-a-quarter-mile event in too cold
water would have a bad effect on him,
i Brandsten believes. Another cause for
the withdrawal is that the committee
in charge of the race have refused to
; shorten the course, as they had prom-
I ised to do.
