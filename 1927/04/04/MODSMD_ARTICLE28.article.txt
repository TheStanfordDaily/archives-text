Have piety and self-sacrifice and chastity and all the other homiletic
virtues vanished from Stanford? Can it be that those sacred principles
for which our forefathers shed the other fellow's blood no longer palpi
tate the pocketbooks of their biography-reading descendents? Nay!
(and more nays from the front benches in the irregular chorus). Amid
the clustering hills (see catalog for scenic location) and within commut
ing distance of San Francisco, Stanford rises proudly today, a strong
hold of many of the best advertised virtues there are.
Take, for instance, the Y.M.C.A. It costs ten thousand dollars a
year. But does Stanford grudge the money? On the contrary (second
chorus of nays) the services of the assistant registrar are freely con
tributed to help collect it —and who shall surpass the registrar's office
in that service?!
Ten thousand whole dollars, twenty thousand halves or one tenth of
a million dimes—think what we might buy with it and yet most nobly do
not:
For example, ten thousand dollars would buy eight hundred and thirty
four quarts of fairly good gin, that is one thousand six hundred and
sixty-eight pints, and perhaps cocktails also for those members of the
faculty who chose to be high hat. But do we buy with it one thousand six
hundred and sixty-eight pints of fairly good gin? Not No ! No ! We buy a
Y.M.C.A.
It would provide twenty thousand turkey dinners for Encina fresh
men with enough left over for hash all the next week.
Or, if specialization in any one of the virtues were desired, in line
with modern production methods, a high degree of efficiency could be se
cured. For instance, chastity. Ten thousand dollars would buy an al
most unbelievable amount of that.
Devoted to the purchase of Lucky Strikes, there would be enough to
make opera singers out of every man, woman and child 011 the cam
pus. For such a sum each of the ''500'' could be outfitted with enough
powder to last a month of rainy days and every "row" runabout con
verted into a coupe.
But does our high-minded and self-sacrificing institution spend the
money in any of these ways? Ah, 110! We take the ten thousand
dollars and buy a Y.M.C.A.
