Athletic officials at Stanford have been the target for some first-rate
criticism during the past two quarters. Without making any sweeping
statements, it can be said, with truth, that the most of the criticism has
been deserved. The Board of Athletic Control has made some mistakes
that the state legislatures could not equal. The students have not stood
aside and allowed all these errors to be made without a word of protest,
but it must be said, in favor of the board, that it has held up wonder
fully under all the adverse criticism.
Now the Board of Athletic Control adds another crime to its already
large list of atrocities. Last Thursday was the final opportunity for
students to purchase rooters' tickets to the track meet with California,
the date of which is still two weeks away. Sixteen days before the day of
the event the students are forced to dig into their jeans and buy space
in the Stanford stadium (seating capacity 74,400).
Why, Mr. B. of A. C., cannot rooters' tickets to the Big Meet be
obtained one week before the meet instead of three weeks previous?
"Don't you realize, Mr. Editor, that it costs money to keep a man at
the Union selling tickets?" was Mr. B's answer. Whereupon the editor
became very humble, and only wondered, to himself, whether it might
not be possible to have one more day on which tickets could be purchased,
just before the meet. The students would probably be willing to share
the extra $4 that it would cost to keep a man in the Union for the addi
tional eight hours' service. Or, even better, take the twenty cents that
was collected last Fall on the Big Game ticket applications which were
returned minus the twenty cents. That would pay for the additional
wages that you would be forced to pay and furnish the ticket seller cigars
to smoke during the day.
And, Mr. B. of A. C, we do want to thank you for sp intelligently
postponing the track meet with the University of Southern California
last Saturday. You realized as well as we did that it could have been
nothing but a mud fight, didn't you Mr. B.? The best contest of the
season would have been spoiled by a slow, wet track, to say nothing of
wet scats. Congratulations, Board of Athletic Control!
