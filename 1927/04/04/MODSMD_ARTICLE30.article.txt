THE BLUE PENCIL
Once again the Redwood City movie,
has been packing them in to see a j
picture with little claim to fame other
than the official disapproval of the j
Palo Alto censors. It must cheer the !
heart of the manager of the Redwood
City cinema sink (Apologies, Nathan)
every time the guardians of Palo Alto
morals get out the blue pencil.
If one did not already know enough
about the mind of any censor to under-:
stand that such optimism was un-;
warranted, one might feel that the!
happy day would come when the Palo'
Alto blue-stockings would realize the |
effect of their work. But one does,
know how the censor's mentality func- j
tions, and one understands in conse
quence that the august body in the
nearby town will continue to select
the local smut with the utmost care, I
even though the population should rise
up en masse and march to Redwood
to partake, figuratively, of the forbid- j

den fruit.

PRELIMINARY PRACTICE
Men's Rushing begins in one week.
As a means of swinging into the thing
gradually, The Bull Session would like
to offer a few suggestions to frater
nity men and freshmen. Try the fol
lowing events each day:
One: The handshake for enthusiasm.
Stand straight to the hips, and from
there upward bend forward at an
angle of forty-five degrees. Have a
cold fish handy, and reach out and
grasp it, shaking vigorously, mean
while repeating at a moderate rate:
"Mighty glad to know you, old man,
old man, old man."
Two: The smile for warmth.
Place a photograph (preferably from
any police album) on the mantle.
This exercise is especially beneficial
if a picture of one of the following
men can be secured: Scar-fare A1
Capone, Bull Montana, or Andrew
Volstead.
(This could go on indefinitely, but
you get the idea!)
