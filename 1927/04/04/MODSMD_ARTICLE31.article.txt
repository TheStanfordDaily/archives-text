RIVERS TO CROSS. By Roland Pert
ree. Houghton Mifflin.
Five long bleak years on the Congo
—then Nigel Praed came home and
fell head over heels in love with the
first girl he met. Life had beeji hard
for Nigel with his mysterious past
about which he was forced to keep
his lips locked —something in the way
of a secret duty during the war and
perfectly honorable, of course, and he
was primed for a holiday. Most of all
he was hunting a fluffy little morsel
whose curls were built to nestle com
fortably in the crook of his arm.
But instead business frowned early
and besides, he looked too long into
the dark eyes, very self-satisfied eyes,
of his train companion, daughter of
His Excellency "The Mule." For those
who did not take part in the Big
Show, be it known that "The Mule"
was Sir Francis Prothero, late of the
line and more recently military gov
ernor of that tropic smudge, Porto
Rico.
And there —to that mass of rock jut
ting out of the sea like a flower
dressed clown hat —Praed went to in
veigle the headstrong old gentleman,
whom he hoped some day to make his
father-in-law, into hearing and approv
ing plans for an airdrome.
Here Mr. Leland Boas enters the
game with real fervor, the prize being
Phillida, who already had said sweet
words in Praed's willing ear, and the
gambling concession of the lonesome
and hot little island. Papa Prothero
likes Boas' proposition—because cer

-I tain indiscreet letters force him to —
and thus Boas has the edge.
) Follows intrigue, mystery, and
1 downright dirty work, charges false
■ and otherwise. Praed gets his fill of
[ the one-sided fight, but not until he is
bested and fired by his company.
i "Rivers To Cross" ends as you would
• have it end, but there are moments
I when you would like mighty well to
• jerk off your coat and stand there
[ with Nigel Praed, your back against
! : the wall, and bruise your bare knuck
-! les against soft flesh. There are times
when you want to scream a warning,
. when you would like to dash a certain
, wilful gentleman into a tub of cold
water or tell him in good round tones
• i to go to where you would not want to
, i follow. "Rivers To Cross" gets under
r l your skin like that.
When Phillida telegraphs him that
: it's all off —but that is another part
- of the story. The climax is the kind
i that every red-blooded man glories in;
the kind every woman secretly hopes
• some day to take part in. Incidentally
• i there is an international angle that
; lends it considerable color.
, i Mr. Pertree is more than an enter
;! tainer. He knows human nature, lie
gives shut-ins and lienpecks and drab
souls a peep at the life they live in
their dreams.
There's romance and a kiss or two;
letters that should never have been
: written, and an American girl who
wafts through the story like a clean
summer breeze from across a rose
garden. —Emerson Spencer.
