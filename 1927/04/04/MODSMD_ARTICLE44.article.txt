# The 						Greatest and Most Eccentric Southpaw

"Waddell, George Edward, pitcher, |
Chicago, N.L., 1901; Philadelphia, A.L., |
1902-1907 inc.; St. Louis, A.L., 1908,
1909, 1910." So reads the brief para
graph allotted to the famous "Rube" I
in the Baseball Cyclopedia, published
by the Baseball Magazine Company, j
Too bad that they couldn't have given
at least a page to the brilliant south
paw! Connie Mack could write vol
umes about his experiences with the
childlike pitcher, who was forever
straying away from the fold to go fish
ins, tend bar. ride on a fire engine, or
lead a circ-iB parade.
Connie Mack knew well how to han
dle this great but simple-minded
pitcher, yet even Connie was taken
in by Rube once in a while. Waddell
was always broke. And he was forever
asking Connie for ten, twenty, or
thirty dollars. Connie knew that the
money would go for beer or whisky,

so he always kept two one-dollar bills
in a special pocket and handed them
out to Rube with regrets that that was
all he had with him. But once George
Edward had a brilliant idea. He told
Connie that he had lost his medal â€”
the championship medal that all the
Athletics wore in honor of winning the
1905 American League pennant. His
manager advised putting an ad in the
paper and offering a reward of $10.
This the Rube did. The next day he
told Connie that there was a man in
a saloon near the ball park who had
found his fob. Connie gave him the
ten, with which Rube retrieved the fob
from the bartender, with whom he had
hocked it the day before!

Andy Coakley. a team-mate of Wad
dell's, told me of a day in Philadelphia
in 1903 or '04. -when a fan razzed the
Rube so ihat he climbed up into the
stands and started a riot. His temper
was up, and going to bat he slammed
out a two-bagger, and then, when it
came time to pitch again, he struck
out Hemphill. Heidriek. and Burkett,
of St. Louis, on nine pitched balls.
For Waddell, when he wanted to set
his mind on pitching, was absolutely
unbeatable, and seemed to have every
thing, including blinding speed and
a great curve. He won many double
headers unaided, and delighted in
hearing the cheers of the fans as he
strode out onto the field to rescue a

| game that some fellow-pitcher was
tossing away. No pitcher ever lived
j who was so colorful, nor who so cap
tured the hearts of the fans of the
nation. After he was sent to St.
Louis, in 190S, he asked trt pitch
i against his former teammates and
; struck out sixteen of them! Dissipa
tion had long been taking its toll, or
I he might possibly have fanned them
| all. For he had the stuff to do it!
