# STUDENT CLUB WORK OUTLINED IN LETTER TO GRADUATE WOMEN
## 
### 
Two more letters concerning gradu
ate students' organizations on other
campuses have been received by the
Graduate Women's Club here, which
is engaged in making a survey of such
organizations.
The first communication is from
Arthur IT. Daniels. Dean of the Gradu
ate School of the University of Illinois.
He describes his organization as an
unofficial club of the graduate stu
dents and faculty. Its purpose is to
furnish an opportunity for those work
ing in different departments to be
come acquainted with one another and
thus to counteract the tendency to
ward narrowness which intense spe
cialization may sometimes induce. The
university has no provisions for the
living quarters of the women graduate
students.
Charles B. Lipman, Dean of the
Graduate Division of the University
of California, speaks of the Graduate
Students' Club at Berkeley as a club
entirely for social purposes. The mem
bers have meetings approximately
every two weeks and hold dances fre
quently. The men and women join in
the activities of the club, since there
is no special women's or men's or
ganization among the graduate stu
dents.
