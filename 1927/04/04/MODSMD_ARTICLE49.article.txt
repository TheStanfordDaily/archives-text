# Educators Disagree as to Worth of "A" Average Men
## 
### 
Students with a "B" average rank
ing in college have a better oppor
tunity to succeed in the business world
than "A" average men, according to
George Wadsack, University of Okla
homa registrar. He believes that "B"
average men engage in more outside
activities which in turn tend to pre
pare them more efficiently for their
future careers. However, Dr. J. S.
Buchanan, vice-president of the same
university, favors the straight "A"
average group.
