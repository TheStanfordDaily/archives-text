"Oregon, 0.A.C., and British Colum
bia are all taking up crew in the
North, and will probably be as suc
cessful as is Washington, where that
sport is more popular than football.
Naturally, popularity depends on win
ning teams, and Washington has cer
tainly had these."
Sonju, with his teammates, have

1 come to meet California next Satur
day and, if successful, will enter many
of the Eastern meets. "Almost all of
the big Eastern colleges have adopted
crew, and rate it equally as high as
football," he said. "This does not mean
that these universities have especially
attractive locations for training, for
Columbia, which is probably the best
1 in the East, must row on the Harlem
' river. And the Harlem, which is some
distance from the campus, is cluttered
up with launches and ferryboats."
Initial Outlay Large
Crew, like many sports, requires a
large initial outlay, bua a small yearly
expenditure. Sonju showed that nearly
all of the Washington expenses for
crew last year were for trips back
