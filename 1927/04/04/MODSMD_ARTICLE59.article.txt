# U.S.C. Changes Plans for Proposed Student Union
## 
### 
Important changes in plans for the
new student union building at the
University of Southern California have
just been announced by the committee
in charge of the project. Reducing the
size of floor space, it has been defi
nitely decided to erect a five-story
building, including a basement, of
North Italian Romanesque architec
ture. Work will probably begin at the
end of spring semester, and will be
completed and entirely finished by the
first of next year.
