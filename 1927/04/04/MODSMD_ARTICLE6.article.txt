# CONN STATES RULES FOR PROM PURCHASES
## 
### 
' Each member of any of the Junior
Prom committees who has anything
to buy must turn in an estimate of
the amount of expense to Harry Call,
class treasurer, before making the
purchase," stated Claude Conn, com
mittee chairman, at the first meeting
of the combined groups of those in
charge of the annual affair.
No one will have the authority to
buy anything for the Prom without a
requisition. This is done in belief that
it will simplify the payment of bills
and avoid trouble when the final time
comes for settling them.
Members of the Decoration Com
mittee, under the direction of A1 Cass,
will meet in Room 214 at 2 o'clock
this afternoon to discuss further the
ideas that hae been submitted for
the Prom decorations.
