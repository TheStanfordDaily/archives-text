# I928 Representatives Begin Drive for Collecting Dues
## 
### 
Junior class dues are now payable,
announced Harry Call, class treasurer,
yesterday. Blanks have been sent out
to representatives in all living groups,
and members are requested to co
operate with them in order that the
class may have sufficient funds to do
preliminary work on the Prom.
Dues will be $2 and must be paid
before bids to the Prom can be se
cured.
