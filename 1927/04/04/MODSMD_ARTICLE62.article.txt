# BACHELOR DEGREE IS NOT KEY TO SUCCESS, VANDERLIP DECLARES

j | "College education is not an open
sesame to great financial success in
the business world," declared Frank
A. Vanderlip, noted financier and for
mer president of the National City
■ Bank of New York, in a recent inter-
I view in the Daily Princetonian.
"Whether the college man is better
ii suited for banking than the man with
' out a bachelor's degree depends on
the characteristics of the individual
■ alone," he declared.
"Many men go to college with a
' i vague idea that they will get some
j economic benefit from four years's as
sociation with a group of young men
1 who wear clothes of the same cut and
i affect similar styles in haberdashery,
i That does not always prove true. You
1 can lead a youth to the fountain of
• knowledge, but can you make him
1 , drink from it?
i"The one habit the college graduate
i should have formed and should never
forget is that of studying. In his four
' | years he should have learned not
| merely to concentrate, but also to
i correlate facts and get at sources of
i information.
I "In hiring a man," explained Mr.
' Vanderlip, "I never employ one for his
j suit, nor his ability at bridge, nor,
least of all, for any skill he may have
gained during his undergraduate days
in 'beating the game.' When he has
certain qualities—the chief one of
which is willingness to work hard —I
: prefer the college man for the job,
because he has at least been associ
ated with an intellectual aristocracy."
