# FIVE BALL GAMES START INTRAMURAL TITLE COMPETITION
## DIAMOND SERIES OPENS Toro Meets Phi Kaps; Chi Psi's Encounter Sigma Nu's at Sequoia 
### 
Five games, the first on the sched
ule, open the annual intramural base-
I ball season this afternoon, when teams
of League I and League II tangle at
4:15 o'clock. The forty-two ball clubs
representing fraternities, eating clubs,
dormitory nines, and one independent
organization on the campus, are di
vided into seven leagues of six teams
each.
The games today are: diamond 1,
Phi Kappa Sigma vs. El Toro; dia
mond 2, Encina 4 vs.' Alpha Sigma
Phi; diamond 3, Sequoia vs. Phi Delia
Theta; diamond 4, Encina 3 vs. Theta
Delta Chi; Sequoia diamond, Chi Psi
vs. Sigma Nu.
Catholic Nine Favored
With eight men from its champion
ship team of last year eligible for an
other season of competition, the Juui
pero Serra nine is slated to ease into
the top position again, although the
freshmen of Encina, who played to
gether for a winning combination on
the diamond this year, will offer the
club serious competition.
Lack of Practice Felt
The inclemency of the weather has
eliminated all the chances for prac
tice of the participants, which should
materially affect the opening games.
In case of postponement of games in
the baseball series, they will be
played at the end of the season, and
not squeezed into the present sched
ule, states Coach Charles W. Davis,
director of intramural sports.
