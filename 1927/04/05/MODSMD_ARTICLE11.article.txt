Phi Gamma Delta firmly established
itself as a serious contender for the intra
mural baseball championship yesterday
afternoon in the second round of the
series, holding Alpha Tau Omega to a
shutout and at the same time scoring
thirteen well-earned runs.
In the only other game which was
played, Zeta Psi completely smothered
a hastily gathered Military nine, 14 to 2.
Gregory Has Fast Curve
Pitcher Gregory of the Fijis, with a
fast curve and a good change of pace,
was at all times master of the situation,
and pitched the whole game. He received
excellent support, however, considering
the treacherous field where judging of
grounders was next to impossible. Wil
bur Adams did some star playing when
he handled two hard chances in center
field without an error, to cut off scores.
Lacking their regular hurler, the losers
were at a decided disadvantage, but Win
ter, Fox, and Paine despite dieir inex
perience managed to keep the hits down
to a fairly small number.
Zetes Win Easily
The Zeta Psi's won their ball game in
the first inning, with eleven runs due to
hits in the outfield where there were but
two men to chase the flies. In this game
where any hit ball was good for a safety,
ragged fielding and poor pitching pre
dominated among the wearers of khaki.
Los Arcos and Encina Basement de
faulted 7 to 0 to Theta Xi and El Capi
tan, respectively, when their teams failed
to appear.

Diamond I—Sigma Alpha Epsilon vs.
Beta Theta Pi.
