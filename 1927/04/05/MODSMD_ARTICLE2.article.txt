# DEFINITE DATE SET FOR LITTLE BIG MEET: SCHEDULED APRIL 15
## 
### 
Final announcement from the Graduate
Manager's office yesterday sets the date
of the Stanford-California "Little Big
Meet" definitely for Friday afternoon,
April 15, the day before the Big Meet
itself. Various obstacles have caused the
shiifting of the date from the original
time, April 23, up to April 8, back to
April 23, and up again to April 15, which
will be final.
This Saturday the Stanford Babe track
men meet San Jose State College and
Modesto Junior College. The Modesto
men will provide the only real chance of
comparison between the two freshman
teams, as they were bested by the Cali
fornia freshmen by four points on
March 26.
