# Y.M.C.A. FAILS TO SECURE EXPECTED EXPENSE AMOUNT
## COWDERY MAKES REPORT Secretary Lays Shrinkage To Campus Opposition, Christmas Appeals 
### 
The money-raising department of the i
campus Y.M.C.A. has so far secured j
$1,535 from parents of students, 75 per j
cent of what it got last year and several i
hundred dollars less than was expected, j
says Karl M. Cowdery, assistant Uni- j
versity Registrar and member of the j
Y.M.C.A. Board of Directors.
In an official statement to the Daily, j
R. C. Bell, general secretary, declares: j
"The shrinkage is probably due to two j
things, the adverse criticism of the finan- j
cial policy of the Association printed in '
the editorial and campus opinion columns [
of the Daily and the fact that the appeal ;
for funds went to the parents of new j
students at Christmas time, when most i
folks have tied up their contribution |
money in presents for the family."
Of the $1,535 secured, only $350 was j
given by those who have not previously !
contributed. Letters were sent to former i
supporters several months ago and to j
the parents of new students who did not 1
make written objection.
The Y.M.C.A. has so far raised only |
a third of the total of $11,925 it hoped j
to get this year, part of which was to
pay off the two thousand dollars debt in- j
curred the past two years, Bell states.
Business men of Palo Alto are being j
solicited this week by a committee of |
which J. H. Borden, Palo Alto Furniture !
Company, is chairman. The committee |
is attempting to secure $2,500, a sum $250 I
more than was given last year.
