# GARDS RESUME TRACK TRAINING AFTER LAYOFF
## Inactivity of Last Week Forced by Rain, Wet Cinderpath STIFF MEETS SCHEDULED All â€“ Southern Conference Initial Contest in Series of Three 
### 
After the forced layoff caused last
week by rain aud a wet track, Stan
ford University's track and field men
are again going through their paces in
preparation for the series of three stiff
meets that they will have on the next
three Saturdays.
Beginning with the All-Southern
Conference battle next Saturday, the
Cardinal tracksters continue at top
speed through the Big Meet on April
16 and the U.S.C. meet, April 23.
The superiority of the Cardinals in
the field events and the quarter seems
to assure a Stanford victory.
Murray Schultz of Caltech, who has
run a 9.7 seconds hundred already
this year, will be a big feature of the
meet. He has bettered 22 seconds in
the furlong, also, so he looms as a
potential double-winner. Other South
erners will offer Richman a real battle
for places in both sprints.
No one from the South can touch
Spencer or Captain Babcock in the
quarter. The half-milers all run around
1:58, both Southerners aud Northern
ers.
The mile may go to McKinnon and
Swain. Faster time in the two-mile
seems to give Ramsey only a second
place.
The gathering of power from many
teams, and concentrating it against
one squad, points to a real battle
Saturday.
