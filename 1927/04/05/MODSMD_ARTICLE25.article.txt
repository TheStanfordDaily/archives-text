# STANFORD TO MEET U.S.C. TENNIS SQUAD IN RETURN CONTEST
## 
### 
Stanford will meet U.S.C. once more
this week, this time on the tennis
courts tomorrow at 3 o'clock, with all
chances of winning by more than one
tally. This is the second time that the
Cardinal racqueters have met the Tro
jans this year, and they are pointed to
take just as complete a victory to
morrow as when they won every
match from them in Los Angeles.
The Southerners are bringing four
men with them to play three singles
and two doubles matches. Topping
their rating is Theron Wilson, who
will play Captain Cranston Holman.
In the previous encounter, Holman did
not make the trip to Los Angeles, and
with his participation in tomorrow's
play, the victory will probably be a
decisive one.
Lionel Ogden will meet the second
man from U.S.C., Ken Faulkner, and
Ralph McElvenny will play James
Davis, third ranking Trojan. The
fourth Trojan, Bob Bagley, is matched
against Alan Herrington. The two
Stanford doubles teams will be com
posed of Holman and Ogden, and Mc-
Elvenny and Herrington.
