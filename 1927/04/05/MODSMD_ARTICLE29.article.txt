In a statement printed 011 page 1 of today's Daily, R. C. Bell, gen
eral secretary of the Campus gives as one reason for decrease
in contributions from parents of stndents '"the adverse criticism of the
financial policy of the Association printed in the editorial and campus
opinion columns of the Daily."
For the campus opinion column, of course, the Daily is not respon
sible one way or the other, but editorially it trusts 110 secret has been made
of the Daily's sincere conviction that some features of the Campus "Y"
are outdated, some unethical, and some downright ludicrous.
In its past history the "Y" has been a most valuable asset to the
Campus. The employment service began there. The freshman handbook
has been a "Y" publication, although from next year on it will be put out
by the Associated Students. At one time the "Y" performed in the halls
real services now delegated to the sponsors. Numbers of liberal speakers
have been brought to the Campus under Christian Association auspices
and those of the Fellowship .Forum.
That these services are mostly of the past is no reason for valuing
them less highly and the "Y" has much to which to point with pride.
But one "service" after another has been taken over by better equipped
groups. And the "Y" hasn't changed form to keep up with the times.
Instead, the "Y" has each year built up a larger overhead, developed
a more impressive "organization," until it has become an expensive shell.
Student participation has become less and less important until now not
even an up-to-date membership list is kept. As the sums of money to be
raised mounted by thousands, collecting it became more of a task, and
faculty, citizen, and professional aid was required, Last year hot much
more than a thousand dollars was collected by students for what was
supposedly their own organization. Fifty-six cents of every dollar raised
went to pay secretaries' salaries and twenty-two cents more for office
expense, a large part of which was fund-raising cost. Not even by solicit
ing parents, alumni, and distant friends of the University could this be
kept up, and the "Y" is now heavily in debt with 110 very bright prospect
of getting out soon.
President Wilbur and many others feel that there is a real place for a
distinctly Christian organization on the Campus. Certainly there is a place
for survey makers, for study groups, and for live forums. It may possibly
be desirable that a tactful and inspiring secretary be maintained as a
sympathetic adviser to whom the younger men may in confidence take
their problems. But a radical change from the "Y" as presently consti
tuted is not only an obvious good but it seems will be inevitably brought
about by the weight of sincere and informed public opinion both within
and without the organization.
