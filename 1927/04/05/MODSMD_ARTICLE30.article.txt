# All-University Day
## 
### 
Stanford is preparing for the annual University Day. April 16 has
been set aside as alumni day —the time when all the old boys (and old
girls) come back to see how the Farm has progressed since their time.
The returners on that day will be royally entertained from the minute
they place their feet on the red soil until they leave the Campus the next
day. Sports always amuse alumni, so Stanford will meet California on
the track, on the diamond, and on the tennis courts. Even alumni eat, so
an all-Stanford dinner will be held in the Memorial Court. Gordon Davis
is in charge of the entertainment for the dinner—enough said. For music,
the committee offers the Stanford Band. There is a tea for the ladies,
and a dance for all.'
Home-coming day is the alumni's pleasure time, but it is opportunity
day for the Stanford students. On that Saturday, the undergraduates will
have the chance to mingle with successful business men, and talk over
their own plans for the future. Men who have already learned what
awaits a college graduate when he steps on to the top of the world with
a diploma in his hand, are the ones who can best teach undergraduates
how to prepare for the future. Stanford alumni may be able to offer
students suggestions as to certain courses and studies to pursue in college
that they may especially fit themselves for work after the four pleasant
years have been completed.
As a suggestion on exactly how to approach an alumnus, it can be said
that the best way to get next to one of the old boys is to ask questions
concerning Stanford when he was a student. Ask him about Derby Day,
or about the freshman-sophomore fight, or about the ]»ig Game when
Stanford won in the last minute. He will be only too glad to give you any
such information, and the student might find it interesting, too. Then
when the alumnus is gloating over events of his day, and is quite unex
pectant, slip in a question about the business world and how to get started
in that great unknown. He will unconsciously tell you everything you
want to know, if you will just be diplomatic.
April 16 is called All-University Day because it is ltot only an alumni
reunion, but a reunion of all Stanford men and women, past and present.
Students are welcome at the dinner, the tea, the dance. The undergradu
ates are expected to take as much part in the activities of University Day
as are the alumni. It is everybody's day—All-University.
