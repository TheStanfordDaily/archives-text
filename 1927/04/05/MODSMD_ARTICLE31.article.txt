Today is the last clay that Senior Dues will be collected. Of course,

from paying of the dues. They should offer the small sum that is asked
merely because they are members of the senior organization. Every stu

takes money to make the mare go. Class organizations arc in no way

The class is contracting debts every day. Certain functions are re
quired of all classes, and these duties are even larger for the graduating
