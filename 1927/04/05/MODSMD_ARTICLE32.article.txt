"THE MAD LOVER," Richard Con
nell. Minton Balch and Co., New
York. 1927.
"The Mad Lover" is a delightful tale
about a young man so ( harming that
even traffic cops deferred to him. and
how he reversed the road taken by
his immigrant father.
Kevin Shannon has been the black
sheep of Glenkillen (it was confidently
expected that he would end on the
gallows) until a girl's black eyes sent
him to America, where he became a
millionaire in the conventional man
ner. And Kevin Shannon's son, Jerry,
was the playboy of Branton until an
other girl's black eyes sent him to
Ireland, where he became the founder
of the Glenkillen Industries, Incor
porated. The story ended before he
was quite a millionaire, but he was
well on the way—even the P of
W wore a Glenkillen sweater
when he descended from to
play golf.
Heretofore Mr. Connell has confined
himself to short stories, with "The
Mad Lover" as his first full-length
novel. Perhaps the new medium ex
plains a certain faint inaptitude in the
first half. There are spots where he
returns to his old manner, dnd the
incident and dialogue have his distinc
tive sparkle, but it is cut a little obvi
ously after the pattern of the funda
mentally worthwhile young man frit
tering himself away on polo ponies
until the girl with ideals snatches him
from the beautiful siren who wants
him only as a playmate.
From page 179 to the end. hoAvever,
the author finds himself, and more
than refutes any suspicion of inade
quacy with a joyous sequence mingling
hand-knitted sweaters and fist-fights
in a wholly unusual combination. We
are going right out to try to locate his
three volumes of short stories.

"CONGAI." Harry Hervey. Cosmopoli
tan Book Corporation, New York.
1927.
In French Indo-China, "congai"
means woman, but it means more, too,
among the French administrative of
ficers quartered there, ami "Congai"
is the story of Thi-Linh, a half-caste
courtesan.
This-Linh made her profession an
art, and attained not only security, but
and attained not only security, but
wealth. Still she was not wholly mer
cenary—of the five of her lovers whose
stories are told, to one she gave a son.
to another a book, peace to the third,
and to the fourth, belief. Chauvet, the
fifth, was never her lover save in the
most literal sense. To all of them she
was loyal, until they passed, and re
tained always a certain fundamental
integrity of spirit. Thi-Linh was never
merely an odalisque.
Harry Hervey knows his locale and
his characters, and he reproduces vi
tally the half-Oriental, half-European,
wholly tropical atmosphere of French
Indo-China, from the jungles to Sai
gon. "Congai" is written with a sensi
tive feeling of odor and color and
warmth.
And the best thing about the ntory
is that Thi-Linh stays in Indo-China —
she doesn't invade Europe to gather
the world at her feet through the
wiles of the latest Oriental dances.
She wouldn't even learn how to dance
because she had heard that one's
joints had to be broken in order to
do it successfully.
