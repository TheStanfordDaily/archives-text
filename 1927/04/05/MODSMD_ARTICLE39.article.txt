# BOOKS CHOSEN FOR PRINTING AND RINDING GIVEN TO UNIVERSITY
## Valuable Collection Gift of Albert M. Bender and Group of Friends 
### John Rogers 
Cbost-n because of their fine print
ing and binding, a valuable collection
of books, both old and modern, has
been given to the University by Al
bert M. Bender, of San Francisco, and
a group of his friends. Part of this
collection is now on exhibition in
especially constructed cases that are
in the Library in the passages be
tween the* catalogue and the periodical
rooms.
Nearly 200 volumes, illustrating
beautiful work in type, decoration, and
binding of books, have been presented
by this group. The books began ar
riving around last Christmas, but it
•was necessary to wait until the exhibi
tion cases had been installed before
they could be shown to the public.
Most of Books Modern
Although most of the volumes are
examples of modern work in printing
and binding, and show how the mod
ern styles are imitations of fifteenth
century printing—particularly of Nico
las Jensen and of the Elzevir Press —
a few older and more valuable books
are included in the collection.
These latter books include: a two
volume translation of "Don Quixote,"
printed by Tonson, London, in 1742,
which is a gift of Philip N. Lilienthal;
a four-volume set of Seneca, from the
Elzevir Press, given by Edward Bran-
a nine-volume set of Shakes
peare, issued by William Pickering,
London, in 1825, which was given by
Charles Bransten; a six-volume Cob
den-Sanderson Bible, printed by the
famous Doves Press, London, which
is a gift of Mrs. Sigmund Stern; and
"Laudes Creaturarum of St. Francis,"
donated by Mrs. Cobden-Sanderson.
Field Poem Included
Of particular interest to Stanford
people is the Phi Beta Kappa poem,
"Prayer," written by Charles Kellogg
Field, with a foreword by David Starr
Jordan. Field read this poem at the
University several years ago.
The other donors are The Book Club
of California and The Windsor Press,
both of San Francisco, Louis Sloss, Jr.,
and Julian Hart.
The hand-constructed cases, espe
cially designed for the exhibiting of
these books and which cost around
$500 each, are the gifts of Bender,
Jesse W. Lilienthal, Morgan A. tiunst,
and Lawrence Strasburger.
Bender is well known in San Fran
cisco as a lover of finely printed books,
handsome bindings, and other beauti
ful objects. He has made similar gifts
to other colleges—Mills some time
ago, and, more recently, to California
-—to inspire students with a love of
art.

Although most of the volumes are
examples of modern work in printing
and binding, and show how the mod
ern styles are imitations of fifteenth
century printing—particularly of Nico
las Jensen and of the Elzevir Press —
a few older and more valuable books
are included in the collection.
These latter books include: a two
volume translation of "Don Quixote,"
printed by Tonson, London, in 1742,
which is a gift of Philip N. Lilienthal;
a four-volume set of Seneca, from the
Elzevir Press, given by Edward Bran-
a nine-volume set of Shakes
peare, issued by William Pickering,
London, in 1825, which was given by
Charles Bransten; a six-volume Cob
den-Sanderson Bible, printed by the
famous Doves Press, London, which
is a gift of Mrs. Sigmund Stern; and
"Laudes Creaturarum of St. Francis,"
donated by Mrs. Cobden-Sanderson.
Field Poem Included
Of particular interest to Stanford
people is the Phi Beta Kappa poem,
"Prayer," written by Charles Kellogg
Field, with a foreword by David Starr
Jordan. Field read this poem at the
University several years ago.
The other donors are The Book Club
of California and The Windsor Press,
both of San Francisco, Louis Sloss, Jr.,
and Julian Hart.
The hand-constructed cases, espe
cially designed for the exhibiting of
these books and which cost around
$500 each, are the gifts of Bender,
Jesse W. Lilienthal, Morgan A. tiunst,
and Lawrence Strasburger.
Bender is well known in San Fran
cisco as a lover of finely printed books,
handsome bindings, and other beauti
ful objects. He has made similar gifts
to other colleges—Mills some time
ago, and, more recently, to California
-—to inspire students with a love of
art.
Cbost-n because of their fine print
ing and binding, a valuable collection
of books, both old and modern, has
been given to the University by Al
bert M. Bender, of San Francisco, and
a group of his friends. Part of this
collection is now on exhibition in
especially constructed cases that are
in the Library in the passages be
tween the* catalogue and the periodical
rooms.
Nearly 200 volumes, illustrating
beautiful work in type, decoration, and
binding of books, have been presented
by this group. The books began ar
riving around last Christmas, but it
•was necessary to wait until the exhibi
tion cases had been installed before
they could be shown to the public.
