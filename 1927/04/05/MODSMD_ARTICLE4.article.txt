# FRESHMAN DEBATE TEAM DOWNED BY CALIFORNIA CUBS
## ADVERTISING IS UPHELD Babes Condemn Modern Methods as Harmful To Consumer 
### 
The Stanford freshman debating
team lost to the University of Cali
fornia freshman team in the first of
two dual meets, which was held in the
Little Theatre last night, by a 2 to 1
judges' decision.
Stanford upheld the affirmative side
of the question, "Resolved, That the
modern methods of commercial adver
tising are harmful to the consumer."
Arthur D. Angel, Virgil K. Whitaker,
and George E. Bodle were the person
nel of the yearling squad and spoke
in the order named. The judges were
Frances Wilson of the Citizenship De
partment, Professor B. O. Brown of
the Journalism Department, and Pro
fessor V. H. Pelz of the School of
Business.
The main points of the argument
brought forth by the Stanford babes
on the affirmative side were: that
eighty-five per cent of the modern
commercial advertising is competitive,
that competitive advertising is harm
ful to the consumer in that it preju
dices his mind and makes him pay
higher retail prices for his commodi
ties; and that the only kind of adver
tising that is beneficial to the con
sumer is non-competitive advertising.
The latter would be beneficial in that
the consumer would have his commodi
ties offered for sale represented to him
in a fair and honest way.
Next Monday evening the Stanford
negative team will meet the Cubs at
Berkeley in the final clash of the de
bate series. These two contests are
the only ones scheduled for the Cardi
nal freshmen, Coach John Duniway
stated.
