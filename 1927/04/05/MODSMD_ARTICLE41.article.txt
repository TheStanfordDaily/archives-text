# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Wail, it's time for the annual car- J
toon on Walter Johnson, the "Tennv-1
son's Brook of pitchers!" 1927 makes ;
the "Big Train's" twenty-first vear in
major league baseball, and all with
one club, too, which is going some! j
"Sir Walter of the Side-arm Speed-j
ball" will be doing business at the old |
stand as usual, having reported at the I
training camp of the Senators in fine i
condition for another season in the j
uniform of the club he joined in 1907.
Think of it! Where were you and I
i
what were you doing in 1907? The!
same thing you're doing now? Twenty-j
one years is a long time to hold down j
a job, especially as a baseball player. I
Since Big Barney, the Kansas Cy- j
clone, joined the Washington Club, he |
has pitched in 754 games and won 4111
of them. Only "Cy" Young won more ]
games, and Cy turned in his 511 vie-j
tories in 22 years, spent in both the i
National and American Leagues. John-1
son has specialized in strike-outs and :
shut-outs, having led his league in the!
former twelve teams, and he leads |

| both leagues in the total number of
j both, having fanned 3,449 batters in
! his career and won 112 games without
; allowing his opponents a run! Last
year, in starting his twentieth season,
he not only began the game with his
, 5,555 th inning, but brought his strike
| out total to 3,333 and his shut-out vic
tories to 111! Let's hope he starts the
! 1927 season as auspiciously—although
j last year was the first time since 1922
| that Johnson did not have a won and
: lest average of .500 per cent for a
I season.
Another record held by this Old
Master is of pitching in three succes
| sive games against the Yankees and
I shutting them out each time! (Sept.
i 4. 5, and 7, 1908). The Big Train's
i world series performances are well re
| membered —how, in the Senators' tirst
i championship in 1924, he rose to su
| preme heights by wfhning the final
' game from the Giants, after losing his
| first two, and how, in 1925, the order
was reversed, and Johnson checked
! the Pirates twice only to lose the final
| contest.

The "Big Train" Starts
Wail, it's time for the annual car- J
toon on Walter Johnson, the "Tennv-1
son's Brook of pitchers!" 1927 makes ;
the "Big Train's" twenty-first vear in
major league baseball, and all with
one club, too, which is going some! j
"Sir Walter of the Side-arm Speed-j
ball" will be doing business at the old |
stand as usual, having reported at the I
training camp of the Senators in fine i
condition for another season in the j
uniform of the club he joined in 1907.
Think of it! Where were you and I
i
what were you doing in 1907? The!
same thing you're doing now? Twenty-j
one years is a long time to hold down j
a job, especially as a baseball player. I
Since Big Barney, the Kansas Cy- j
clone, joined the Washington Club, he |
has pitched in 754 games and won 4111
of them. Only "Cy" Young won more ]
games, and Cy turned in his 511 vie-j
tories in 22 years, spent in both the i
National and American Leagues. John-1
son has specialized in strike-outs and :
shut-outs, having led his league in the!
former twelve teams, and he leads |

| both leagues in the total number of
j both, having fanned 3,449 batters in
! his career and won 112 games without
; allowing his opponents a run! Last
year, in starting his twentieth season,
he not only began the game with his
, 5,555 th inning, but brought his strike
| out total to 3,333 and his shut-out vic
tories to 111! Let's hope he starts the
! 1927 season as auspiciously—although
j last year was the first time since 1922
| that Johnson did not have a won and
: lest average of .500 per cent for a
I season.
