# VAN VLECK TO GIVE SUMMER COURSE IN QUANTUM MECHANICS
## Visiting Professor Is Expert On New Hypothesis of Atomic Structure 
### 
Offering a course in the New Quan
tum Mechanics in the Stanford
Physics Department this summer, Dr.
Joliix Hasbrouck Van Vleck of Minne
sota University will discuss a subject
ho recent that information of it was
jiot available in the Encyclopedia
llritannica until the most recent ad
ditional volumes were printed. Nearly
sill information 011 the Quantum
Theory of Atomic Structure has been
published since 1925.
The visiting professor is himself the
author of a book written 011 the Quan
tum Theory. Van Vleck's book, written
for the National Research Council,
was so much in demand that the first
edition was sold out six months after
it was printed.
Expert on Subject
Van Vleck, who is an expert on the
new theory, studied with two world
authorities who have developed the j
Quantum Theory, Max Born at Copen
hagen, and Arnold Sommerfeld in Ger
many.
Since 1923 Dr. Van Vleck has been
at the University of Minnesota, where
he is now associate professor. Receiv
ing his A.13. degree at Wisconsin in
1920, he was granted a Ph.D. at Har
vard in 1922, where he was a John
Tyndall Scholar in physics. From 1922
to 192:} he was instructor in physics at
Harvard.
"Modern Physics" Listed
Modern Physics, a course ou the dis
coveries of the last few decades 011
the nature of matter and energy, will
also be given by Dr. Van Vleck this
summer.
Eight courses will be given in the
Stanford Physics Department this
summer, including Electromagnetic
Theory and lons and Electrons, which
will be given by Dr. David L. Webster,
head of the department, a Teachers'
Course in Physics, and one in Elemen
tary Meteorology which will be given
by Professor Joseph G. Brown, a regu
lar member of the Stanford depart
ment.
