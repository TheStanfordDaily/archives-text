# STANFORD RECEIVES LETTERS TELLING OF GRADUATE SOCIETIES
## 
### 
Letters from Northwestern Univer
sity and the University of Wisconsin
were recently received by the Gradu
ate Women's Club of Stanford as the
result of inquiries addressed to them
regarding the activity of their gradu
ate students' organizations. The club
is investigating the possibility of unit
ing Stanford graduate students in a
general organization.
A letter from the Dean of North
western University, J. A. James, states
that the meetings of the Graduate
Club draw an attendance of from fifty
to sixty students, a little less than
one-tenth of the graduate student
body. There is no separate organiza
tion for men and women, and the
Graduate Cluh has no participation
with the undergraduate activities.
Charles S. Slichter, Dean of the
Graduate School at the University of
Wisconsin, writes that the Graduate
Club there meets every Monday eve
ning for supper, cards, and dancing.
About once a month the club gives a
dancing party, and about twice a year
a formal. The latter have an attend
ance of about 300, while the Monday
evening suppers include from fifty to
seventy-five. The organization is en
tirely social, and has existed for a
number of years.
So far, letters have been received
from the University of Illinois, the
University of Chicago, Northwestern
University, the University of Wiscon
sin, and the University of California.
