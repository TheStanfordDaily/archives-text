''Faith and not science can solve the
doubt which assails the existence of the
physical world," Professor David F.
Swenson, of the Philosophy department
at the University of Minnesota, recently
declared. "There is no necessary con
flict between faith and knowledge. The
appearance of conflict emerges whenever
anyone tries to make knowledge do the
work of or faith do the work of
knowledge.
"Knowledge is nature's answers to the
questions we ask of her, while faith is
our answer to the questions life asks of
us," Professor Sw.enson said. "In the
laws of evolutionary science there is
nothing to guarantee any kind of progress
a.s a certainty, certainly not moral prog
ress in particular."
