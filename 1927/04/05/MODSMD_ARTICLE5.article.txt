011 the campus to lend a welcoming at
mosphere for Alumni Day have been
authorized by the Executive Commit
tee which met last night. This and the
granting of dates and the approving
of athletic awards constituted the busi
ness of last night's meeting.
The permission given to the Fresh
man Class to hold a barn dance in the
pavilion on April 29 was revoked and
permission to hold it in Encina Hall
was granted. This was done in the
belief that the pavilion dance would
be too expensive and that not enough
money could be secured to cover the
expenses.
