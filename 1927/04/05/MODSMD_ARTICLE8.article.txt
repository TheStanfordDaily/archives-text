# Half Of Seniors' Dues Yet Unpaid; Last Drive Opens
## 
### 
Today is the last day of the senior
drive for class dues and a final effort
is being made by the finance commit
tee to get every senior to support his
class. So far only $200 has been col
lected. This is only about fifty per
cent of the senior dues and is very
low in comparison with past years.
Fifteen or twenty per cent more wo
men than men have paid their dues.
Only 160 tickets will be placed on
sale for the Senior Ball this year and
tickets will not be sold to those that
have not paid their dues.
Members of the class living off the
campus have been particularly slow in
paying their dues. Only a very small
per cent of them have been heard
from yet. Off-campus seniors can mail
their dues to Treasurer of the Class
of 1927, Box 1304, Campus.
Seniors' living in the dormitories
may pay their dues to the following
men: Encina â€”Jack A. Turnbull,
Toyon; Peter J. Ferrante, Branner;
Robert L. Beardsley; and Sequoia,
William A. Glen.
Other members of the class who
have not been approached yet may pay
their dues to any members of the
finance committee. The members are:
Don E. Fritts, chairman, William A.
Glen, Ethel Haydock, Katharine Boyn
ton, William A. Evans, Jack A. Turn
bull, Peter J. Ferrante, Kathryn C.
Lunt-, Robert H. Cummings, and Lewis
W. Andrews.
