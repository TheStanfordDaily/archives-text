SUITS
of foreign fabrics '
$ 37
Young men accustomed to smartness will find these suits
tailored to their liking. Only the best of foreign woolens
are used in their construction—flannels, cheviots, and
worsteds. The White House standard in men's clothing
requires that nothing shall be held out on you in those
invisible processes of workmanship which give perma
nence to the fit and lines of your suit. Both single and
double breasted models—as you prefer.
