# STANFORD TRACK SQUAD HAS EDGE OVER ALL-STARS
## Cardinal Advantage in Field Events Doped to Pile Up Big Lead CALTECH SPRINTER FAST Southern Conference Teams Expected to Pick Best Men for Meet 
### 
While no definite entry list ha 3 been
received from the officials in charge
of the All-Southern Conference team,
fhe men chosen for Saturday's meet
with the Cardinal track artists will in
■all probability be picked from among
those who turned in the best marks
in the Conference meet held last Sat
urday.
Judging from the results of this
meet, which was won by Pomona, the
Cardinal advantage in the field and
certain track events will probably give
Stanford a controlling majority of the
points. The Southerners are strong in
the sprints, the half-mile, and the two
mile.
Murray Schultz of Caltech has loped
through a 9.7 seconds hundred and bet
tered 22 seconds in the furlong. Pen
dleton of Whittier, Darling of Caltech,
and Pinney of Pomona are all likely
contenders to keep Richman, Stanford
speed merchant, in the rear guard of
the sprinters.
Scovel of Oxy and Clark of U.C.L.A.
have both turned in fast times in the
half-mile, so the Southerners may be
conceded a little better than an even
break here. Wait's time of 9.54 in the
eight-lap event picks him for the win
ner, with Raney a probable second.
As has happened before this season,
the ltedshirts are due to clean up so
heavily in the field events as to as
sure them of the large end of the final
score. Shutouts can be predicted for
the shot, discus, high jump, broad
jump, and possibly the pole vault.
With the able work of Spencer and
Captain Babcock in the quarter and
Joaquin and Shipkey in the javelin,
Stanford can be expected to garner
most of the points from these two
events. Alex McKinnon may be picked
to break the tape in the mile, with
Swain close behind. West and Nichols
are capable of amassing sixteen count
ers in the barrier events. As usual,
the relay is undeniably Stanford's.
