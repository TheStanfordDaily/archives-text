# SPEAKER CLAIMS TURK HARO TO UNDERSTAND
## 
### 
"The Turk is topsy-turvy—no one
can understand him and he can't even
understand himself."
This is one of the impressions of
Turkey which Professor John Car
ruthers of Occidental College, recent
ly returned from the Near East, gave
yesterday afternoon in his lecture in
the- Little Theatre.
He summed up nis opinion with the
statement that "Anglo-Saxon ideas
will struggle to a realization in the
Eastern laboratory of mankind. The
Turk has the West in his blood but
the East must express itself."
Women Awakening
It is evident all over Turkey, ac
cording to Professor Carruthers, that
woman is beginning to take a place
like that of #her Western sisters. It
was only ten years ago, he said, that
women were sentenced to imprison
ment for going into a public place
with a man; they have just begun to
attend the public theatres. Incidental
ly Professor Carruthers noticed that
the movies, which are everywhere in
the Near East, have considerably af
fected the style of women's dress, and
that the women have been much
quicker to change to the European
style of dressing than the men, who
usually adopt only a coat, wear it over
the baggy Turkish trousers, and don't
accept the complete European dress
until three or four years later.
College Liberal
Women have complete privileges in
all departments of the University of
Stamboul, said the speaker, who ex
plained that the name Stamboul has
been substituted by the new Turkish
government for that of Constantinople.
Turkish amusements Professor Car
ruthers noted were these: promenad
ing in the parks, bathing (which is not
indulged in as much as should be),
smoking—an amusement in which the
women do not indulge publicly—cof
fee-drinking (which is an art), eating
the rich and semi-clean food, autoing,
bargaining and shopping, and dancing,
which they do "long and continuously,
and are wild on jazz-dancing in the
American fashion."
Professor Carruthers found that sex
degeneracy had followed after the
native reign, and that the Turkish had
adopted the tendency to organize vice
which was brought in by the French
soldiers. A flourishing Casino is now
operating in the old palace of the
Sultan.
"Turkey," explained the speaker, "is
now beginning a struggle between
Science and Religion, some of the re
strictions on the old religion having
recently been lifted. There is a fairly
free religious liberty in that Moham
medanism is not a state obligation,
but they have specified that the Chris-1
tian religion can be continued only if ;
it will not proselytize."
