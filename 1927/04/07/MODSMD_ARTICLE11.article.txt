# "CERTAIN STUDENTS" PUNISHED BY COUNCIL
## 
### 
Breaches of the honor system were
responsible for two of the three eases
taken before the Men's Council at their
meeting yesterday afternoon. The
third case was one of intoxication in
the halls.
Breaking the honor system in copy
ing a final report for two physics
courses was the reason for giving a
certain student four additional hours
to his graduation requirements. This
penalty was raised to twelve hours by
the instructor, who gave the student
a minus in both of the courses, which
totaled eight hours.
Eight additional hours on graduation
requirement was the penalty given to
a certain student for copying an Eng
lish theme from a magazine. Whether
the student should get a minus in the
course was left to the discretion of the
instructor.
Because of intoxication and boister
ous conduct in a University dormitory,
a certain student was punished by a
sentence of fifteen hours' work on the
Woodpile at the Convalescent Home.
