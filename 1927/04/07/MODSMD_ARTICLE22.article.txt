Pour singles, a walk, and four stolen
bases gave Phi Sigma Kappa a ball
game in the fourth inning yesterday
when their team smashed the ball all
over the field to take a 5 to 1 victory
from Alpha Delta Phi.
Cressy of the Phi Sigs started out
the batting fiesta when he knocked out
a clean single. No one else could hit,
however, and he died on third. Hughes
and Flohr turned in a double, and the
latter reached home when, in the sev
enth inning, he tripled to left and
scored when the third-baseman drop
ped a throw.
For three innings Keith, Alpha Delt,
and Bryant, Phi Sig, staged a great
pitchers' duel. In the fourth, Bryant
was nicked for one run, while Keith
was knocked for three. That stopped
the scoring until the last inning, when
Phi Sig brought in two more tallies.
Betas Win
The Betas made it a habit to knock
in a run or so every other inning while
Lewis held S.A.E. scoreless, and that
was all to that game, which the Betas
won 12 to 0. Both Lewis and LaÃŸue
pitched fine ball, and handed out very
Sypher's play all season, and as a re
sult, he is admittedly the most valu-!
able player on the squad. Maguire will
start at first, Garibaldi at second, and
Busch at shortstop.
Third Base Weak
Third base is the weakest spot on !
the Stanford infield, and fortunately;
there has been little play arouud that 1
bag lately. While Spud Harder has!
handled himself well at times, and !
has often proved valuable at the bat, 1
Stanford enthusiasts have developed 1
a habit of holding their breaths when j
a bouncer heads toward third. How-j
over. Coach Wolter feels that Spud 1
will come through the California >
series in good fashion, and plans to j
leave that sack in his care.
Consistent work in the field has as
sured the starting of Nissen, Wilton,
and Stewart against the Bears. Wilton
has been hitting regularly, while \
Stewart handles anything coming his ;
way in the left garden. Nissen has not;
lived up to expectations in hitting this 1
season, but should be due to coine ]

through by Saturday,
Nemecheck, veteran California
pitcher, will probably start against
Stanford, with Wyatt receiving. Coach
Zamlocb boasts a hard-hitting aggre
gation, and although errors have been
frequent since the start of the season,
his men should worry Collins and
Sobieski considerably, Jacobsen and
Hill will serve as relief men for
Nemecheck.
The game is scheduled to start at
2:30 o'clock Saturday afternoon in the
Stanford diamond. The second game
of the series will be played in Berke
ley on Tuesday, April 12, while the
final contest will be run off on April
16, following the track meet with the
University of California.
