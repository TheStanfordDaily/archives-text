# U.C. May Follow Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford has announced the adoption of ;i policy whereby only junior
college graduates or students of equivalent standing will be admitted
to the University. In other words, the freshman and sophomore classes
will be eliminated and all effort concentrated on the junior and senior
years and graduate work.
The Daily Californian is much upset over Stanford's decision, and
the paper at Berkeley goes so far as to say "Stanford is doomed." But
the paper states that the change is not significant as far as California is
concerned. "California will lose a rival whom she delights in humiliating,
yet the advantages of her university life will be so far superior to those
offered by Stanford that prospective candidates for entrance will overrun
the campus on registration days. We may be sorry for Stanford, but the
instinct of self preservation decrees that we rejoice in our status as a
state university, which seems to insure our remaining intact."
William John Cooper, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,
states that the University of California will soon follow the lead of
Stanford. "I do not see liovv California can long keep from adopting
a similar j>olicy to that inaugurated by Stanford," said Cooper.
So it looks like Stanford will have the opportunity of "humiliating"
California again—this time along educational lines. California appears
to be perfectly willing to go right along unconscious of the changing
conditions. The old system of education was good enough for their
fathers; why isn't it good enough for this generation: this is the way
the Daily Californian reasons. Why progress?
The majority of the people are sorry to see the old universities dis
appearing, but they realize that such a step is absolutely essential in order
to meet the changing conditions of the day. More people are requiring
learning today than they did yesterday. The present facilities are not
adequate; there must be a change. Some ask why the universities could
not be enlarged to accommodate the increased numbers. The answer is
that a larger university would only cheat those who really want to be
educated. The university should be the place where the few that actually
want higher learning can go and get it. A college degree is all right, but
universities were established to give an education, not a degree.
A two-year general course in a junior college is about all that a large
majority of high school graduates want. They do not care about learn
ing. They want a sweater with a block letter on it, baggy trousers, and
an Alpha Alpha Alpha fraternity pin. It can be arranged comfortably
for these things to be obtained at junior colleges.
One of the junior college heads of the state also was of th"e opinion
that California would be forced to follow in the footsteps of Stanford.
He said: "As I view the matter, 1 fail to see how the University of Cali
fornia can keep from following Stanford's lead. My belief is based on
economic reasons. With Stanford devoting alll its money to upper
division work, it can improve these courses tremendously while the Uni
versity of California under its present policy will be dividing its money
with lower classes whose instruction could just as easily be given in a
junior college. The two schools are in competition with each other, and
with Stanford improving its upper-division work and California standing
still, the state university will lose many of its best students. The logical
solution of the Berkeley problem is for them to require two years of
junior college."
We may be sorry for California, but the instinct of self-preservation
decrees that we rejoice in our status as a private university, which
seems to insure our remaining intact (apologies to the Daily Californian).

with Stanford improving its upper-division work and California standing
still, the state university will lose many of its best students. The logical
solution of the Berkeley problem is for them to require two years of
junior college."
We may be sorry for California, but the instinct of self-preservation
decrees that we rejoice in our status as a private university, which
seems to insure our remaining intact (apologies to the Daily Californian).
Stanford has announced the adoption of ;i policy whereby only junior
college graduates or students of equivalent standing will be admitted
to the University. In other words, the freshman and sophomore classes
will be eliminated and all effort concentrated on the junior and senior
years and graduate work.
The Daily Californian is much upset over Stanford's decision, and
the paper at Berkeley goes so far as to say "Stanford is doomed." But
the paper states that the change is not significant as far as California is
concerned. "California will lose a rival whom she delights in humiliating,
yet the advantages of her university life will be so far superior to those
offered by Stanford that prospective candidates for entrance will overrun
the campus on registration days. We may be sorry for Stanford, but the
instinct of self preservation decrees that we rejoice in our status as a
state university, which seems to insure our remaining intact."
William John Cooper, State Superintendent of Public Instruction,
states that the University of California will soon follow the lead of
Stanford. "I do not see liovv California can long keep from adopting
a similar j>olicy to that inaugurated by Stanford," said Cooper.
So it looks like Stanford will have the opportunity of "humiliating"
California again—this time along educational lines. California appears
to be perfectly willing to go right along unconscious of the changing
conditions. The old system of education was good enough for their
fathers; why isn't it good enough for this generation: this is the way
the Daily Californian reasons. Why progress?
The majority of the people are sorry to see the old universities dis
appearing, but they realize that such a step is absolutely essential in order
to meet the changing conditions of the day. More people are requiring
learning today than they did yesterday. The present facilities are not
adequate; there must be a change. Some ask why the universities could
not be enlarged to accommodate the increased numbers. The answer is
that a larger university would only cheat those who really want to be
educated. The university should be the place where the few that actually
want higher learning can go and get it. A college degree is all right, but
universities were established to give an education, not a degree.
A two-year general course in a junior college is about all that a large
majority of high school graduates want. They do not care about learn
ing. They want a sweater with a block letter on it, baggy trousers, and
an Alpha Alpha Alpha fraternity pin. It can be arranged comfortably
for these things to be obtained at junior colleges.
One of the junior college heads of the state also was of th"e opinion
that California would be forced to follow in the footsteps of Stanford.
He said: "As I view the matter, 1 fail to see how the University of Cali
fornia can keep from following Stanford's lead. My belief is based on
economic reasons. With Stanford devoting alll its money to upper
division work, it can improve these courses tremendously while the Uni
versity of California under its present policy will be dividing its money
with lower classes whose instruction could just as easily be given in a
junior college. The two schools are in competition with each other, and
with Stanford improving its upper-division work and California standing
still, the state university will lose many of its best students. The logical
solution of the Berkeley problem is for them to require two years of
junior college."
