The Executive Committee Tuesday night canceled the barn dance
that the Freshman Class had planned for the basketball pavilion. The
reasons given were that the class has been allowed to run wild with their
expenditures on dances, and should be forced to show how such a dance
could be made to pay for itself. The last attempt that the Encina Club
made at giving a dance ended with the Class of 1930 $700 in the hole.
Seven hundred dollars is usually money enough in itself for an organi
zation to use in giving a dance.
Jt was argued that the Freshman Class has not had the opportunity
to sponsor an evening this year, while Encina Club has already given
two such affairs. Drawing a distinction between the Freshman Class and
Encina Club ic rather difficult. Practically all the men of the class live
in the hall, and the women have not been asked to pay any dues into
the class treasury. ■ ,
