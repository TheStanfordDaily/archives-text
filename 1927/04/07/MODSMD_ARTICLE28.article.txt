## WHEN THE LOWER DIVISION PASSES— 
### 
With the recent announcements by j
President Ray Lyman Wilbur and by;
the California Alumni Board of Visi- j
tors that both Stanford and California j
are contemplating abolition of the;
lower division, there has arisen a de
sire upon the part of the undergrade'
ate body to discover the motives be
hind the proposed action.
For the benefit of those who have i
not previously considered the matter,
and who in consequence probably took
the announcements as something of a ;
shock, it might be well to go over the i
developments that have led to a con
sideration of this rather momentous |
step.
On the outside, conditions have
changed. The A.B. gained in one of |
the liberal arts was once considered j
the earmark of an educated man. A
college graduate, in whatever depart
ment. was looked upon as a trained
and therefore an especially competent
individual. This was natural, since
the average man up to a comparatively J
few years ago. stopped his educational j
activities at the end of grammar j
school. Today the A.B. has lost a great |
deal of prestige. It is true that a man j
who stops at the end of four years of j
college has little advantage over an
untrained man. And furthermore, if j
he had, he would still have to compete j
with the vast numbers of other Bache
lors of Arts who are over-running the J
land today. The cry is for men stu-!
dents who have specialized, and spe-1
cialization now means from four to!
eight years of intensive work.
Educators, however, realize . the j

necessity of some sort of broad pre
liminary training, both for those stu
dents who intend to do intensive work
in a single department and for those
who merely want a little cultural train
ing before they go about the matter
of earning a living in some business
that calls for no special preparation.
The Junior College is the answer to
this problem.
Now what about the changes that
have occurred within the universities
themselves? The average age of col
lege freshmen is becoming less with
each passing year. Consequently, the
problem of handling those freshmen is
becoming more delicate than ever. For
some time there has been a conflict
between the desire upon the part of
college faculties to protect and advise
the young student and the desire upon
the part of older students for indi
vidual liberty in matters of personal
conduct. There is another conflict be
tween the tendency of underclassmen
to stress extra-currichlar activities and
the growing tendency of upperclass
inen and graduates to concentrate
upon academic work.
The new plan, when adopted, may
provide a better place for the division
of student life than we now have. It
may, as its critics hav« claimed, kill
the colorful undergraduate life. Or it
may, and this seems more likely, pro
vide universities whose graduates will
be recognized for their intellectual at
tainments. It may prove the means of
giving back to the universities some
of that standing that the carefree un
dergraduate life had lost for them. It
is an experiment well worth trying.
