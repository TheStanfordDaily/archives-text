Thus ran a tearful little note
found pinned to the lamp-cord
late yesterday afternoon in a cer
tain Encina room. And, true
enough, for two wayward frosh
were last night released from the
Palo Alto jail to be brought up
for trial Friday.
Desire to appease their aes
thetic senses and to gain glory
led these men to take a large
mirror from the Stanford Thea
tre last quarter. The mirror has
been the delight of their friends
and also was of great worth to
themselves. It has since become
an object of greater importance,
for when two of them returned
home late yesterday they were
greeted at their door by two of
ficers, and escorted to the station
only after leaving the note for
their companion. He was still at
large late last night.
