# HOPKINS GRID REFORMS PROVOKE DISAPPROVAL
## 
### 
Strong disapproval of the plan for
football reform recently put forth by
President Earnest M. Hopkins of
Dartmouth College, has been voiced
in the recent Harvard Alumni bulletin.
The simultaneous playing of two
games, one at home and one at the
opponents' home field, smilar to the
plan carried out in many baseball and
debating leagues, is one of the most
strenuously argued points of the Hop
kins plan. It also proposes senior ineli
gibility and undergraduate manage
ment of play.
This plan has met with both favor
able and unfavorable comment among
the colleges cf the United States, and
carries authority, says the bulletin,
principally because of the prestige of
President Hopkins.
