# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
To those of you who are looking j
pessimistically about. among the 1
younger generation of tennis players j
for two or three names which, if added
to that of Big Bill Tilden's might pos- ;
sibly give a ray of hope for the sue-1
cessful defense of the Davis Cup next j
Hummer, 1 would suggest that you do
not overlook that powerful but erratic j
veteran of the courts, Francis T.
Hunter, of New York City. Hunter!
recently had an operation performed :
for "tennis elbow." following which, in
spite of the doctor's warning to "lay
off tennis for at least two months," he j
trekked to Florida and there distin- j
guished himself in various tourna-!
ments, winning the South Florida dou- j
bies title, for one thing, with Manuel
Alonso as his partner.
'Twas not so long ago that Tilden ;
stated that Hunter was a logical Davis ;
Cup player, and it seems that the i

words of the former national champion
may have inspired the big New Yorker
to go after that honor for all he is
worth. With Richards and Howard Kin
sey definitely out of it, and Billy John
ston more or loss a back number,
Hunter evidently thinks that the ward
ing off of the French invasion should
not be left to such youngsters as Ed
Chandler, Lewis White, A1 Chapin,
George Lott, and Wilbur Coen.
Hunter has had much experience in
big tournament play, and has come
out with high honors, as his Olympic
and Wimbledon doubles victories in
1924 attest. Paired with the now-out
lawed Vincent Richards, he beat
Borotra and LaCoste and then Brug
non and Cochet at Paris three years
ago, and at Wimbledon defeated that
great combination of Williams and
Washburn. Not only that, but Hunter
reached the final round of the 1923

Wimbledon tournament in the singles,
losing only to Billy Johnston.
The national indoor tournament,
now in progress, was won in 1922 by
Francis T. Hunter, and the same name
graced the indoor doubles trophy the
two following years. Hunter ranked
fifth in 1923, and now wants to move
up into the first three, if possible. He
seems to have overcome a rather un
fortunate temper which handicapped
him a few years ago, and it is quite
possible that Tilden and Hunter will
form the backbone of the 1927 United
States Davis Cup team.
