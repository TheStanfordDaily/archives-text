# PROSPECTS BRIGHT FOR VICTORY OVER CALIFORNIA NINE
## COLLINS MAY SEE ACTION Trojan Series Loss Lessens Golden Bear Chances in Stanford Contests 
### 
Prospects for a Stanford victory in
the lirst game of the annual baseball
series with the University of Califor
nia are exceedingly bright as a result
of the victory of the University of
Southern California over the Bears in
their series, and the flashy work of
the Cardinals in their practice ses
sions.
Trojans Beat Bears
The Trojans had an easy time beat
ing the Golden Bear nine Tuesday
afternoon, slugging three California
pitchers for nine runs, while the U.C.
squad was tallying two runs. Four
errors by the Bears contributed to
their downfall, and the performance
of Coach Carl Zamloch's men was
none too impressive.
Captain Steve Collins and John
Sobieski. Stanford pitchers, ar£ in
such good form-that Coach Harry Wol
ter is at a loss to decide his starting
battery. Both men were effective in
the defeat of the Trojans Monday, Col
lins getting credit for the victory and
Sobieski saving the game by bearing
down on the Southerners in the last
two innings.
Sypher still holds his unchallenged i
place behind the bat, and continues to
play the best ball on the entire team.
Consistent hitting, steady catching,
and excellent brainwork have featured
few walks, but the Betas hit the ball
in the right directions and won the
game. Their biggest inning was the
fifth, when they cleaned up six runs.
Only two doubles were hit during the
game, Anderson of S.A.E. taking one,
and Montgomery of the Betas account
ing for the others.
After the Junipero Serra batters had
walked across the plate eight times in
two innings, Churchill replaced Dail
on the mound for Gnclna IW. Al
though he did not win the game, he
turned in an excellent record for the
remainder of the play. The Junipero
nine took thrfee more runs to win by
an 11 to 3 score, but they were forced
to work for their tallies.
Harold in Form
Harold was the main reason why
the freshmen did not bring in more
runs. He did not have any such record
as Churchill, who fanned six out of
seven men in two innings, but he did
pitch steadily enough to get the credit
for the victory.
In the fourth scheduled game yes
terday.the I)ekes forfeited to Kappa
Sigma. Contests scheduled for today
are as follows:
Diamond i—Branner vs. El Tigre.
Diamond ll—Phi Kappa Psi vs. In

ing for the others.
After the Junipero Serra batters had
walked across the plate eight times in
two innings, Churchill replaced Dail
on the mound for Gnclna IW. Al
though he did not win the game, he
turned in an excellent record for the
remainder of the play. The Junipero
nine took thrfee more runs to win by
an 11 to 3 score, but they were forced
to work for their tallies.
Harold in Form
Harold was the main reason why
the freshmen did not bring in more
runs. He did not have any such record
as Churchill, who fanned six out of
seven men in two innings, but he did
pitch steadily enough to get the credit
for the victory.

series with the University of Califor
nia are exceedingly bright as a result

Southern California over the Bears in
their series, and the flashy work of
the Cardinals in their practice ses
sions.
Trojans Beat Bears
The Trojans had an easy time beat
ing the Golden Bear nine Tuesday
afternoon, slugging three California
pitchers for nine runs, while the U.C.
squad was tallying two runs. Four
errors by the Bears contributed to
their downfall, and the performance
of Coach Carl Zamloch's men was
none too impressive.
Captain Steve Collins and John
Sobieski. Stanford pitchers, ar£ in
such good form-that Coach Harry Wol
ter is at a loss to decide his starting
battery. Both men were effective in
the defeat of the Trojans Monday, Col
lins getting credit for the victory and
Sobieski saving the game by bearing
down on the Southerners in the last
two innings.
Sypher still holds his unchallenged i
place behind the bat, and continues to
play the best ball on the entire team.
Consistent hitting, steady catching,
and excellent brainwork have featured
few walks, but the Betas hit the ball

game. Their biggest inning was the
fifth, when they cleaned up six runs.
