# JUNIORS CANNOT BUY PROM TICKETS UNTIL CLASS DUES PAID UP
## 
### 
Junior Class dues are coming in very
slowly, declares Harry Call, treasurer.
Call asks that all juniors pay promptly
when approached as it will be neces
sary to get all of the class dues in by
Friday. The living groups have been
divided into sections and thirty-one
members of the class appointed to help
in the drive. Off-campus members of
the class are asked to mail their dues
to Class of 1928, Box 81, Campus.
The money is needed to pay the
preliminary expenses of the Junior
Prom, on which the work has already
been started. The class needs funds
for its many other activities, in addi
tion.
Only 340 tickets will be placed on
sale for the Prom and no junior will
be allowed to buy a ticket until his
dues are paid, declared Call.
