Battle Well-Drawn
The Independent-Phi Psi game, with
two good pitchers in the box, from the
very first was a close battle. George
Wilhelmy, the find of the interclass
baseball series, hurling for the former
nine, found an extra burst of power
after the allotted seven innings had
passed and had the fraternity team com
pletely under his control. Gene Kern
was not as fortunate during this same
period, and only the tight playing of the
infield on several occasions saved him
from defeat before Provan slammed out
his spectacular home run.
Both teams scored well-earned runs
during the first innings of the game, but
the Independents in a last-minute rally
tied the. score in the first half of the
seventh, to postpone the end of the con
test, after which the Phi Psi's were easy
outs for the fast-improving Wilhelmy.
George Pitches Well
In the other two games it was a case
of good pitching on the side of the win
ners. Rodney George of the Breakers
had little trouble with the Alpha Kappa
Lambda team, disposing of them in one,
two, three order, for the most part by
the strikeout route. He fanned the first
six men that opposed him, allowed one
walk, and then fanned another three. His
teammates could hit the fraternity pitch
er almost at will and hud little trouble
in slugging out enough hits to gain nine
runs.
The El Tigre team with Charles Hun
ter in the box and a well-balanced infield
had to be content with only a fivepoint
margin over P>ranner, but were decidedly
much superior, and are sure to be seri
ous contenders for the championship of
League V.

fault).
H. Trovan of the Independents
knocked a home run in the third extra
inning of the game against the Phi Psi
nine after his teammates tied the score
at 3-all in the seventh, thus breaking up
a hotly contested mixup yesterday, to
nose out the Row men, 4 to 3, in the
feature of the afternoon's intramural
series.
Of the other three games scheduled,
two were easy walk-aways for the vic
tors, while thO third was won by default.
El Tigre beat Branner, 6 to 1, and the
slugging Breakers club won from Alpha
Kappa Lambda. Encina V forfeited to
Delta Upsilon.
Battle Well-Drawn
The Independent-Phi Psi game, with
two good pitchers in the box, from the
very first was a close battle. George
Wilhelmy, the find of the interclass
baseball series, hurling for the former
nine, found an extra burst of power
after the allotted seven innings had
passed and had the fraternity team com
pletely under his control. Gene Kern
was not as fortunate during this same
period, and only the tight playing of the
infield on several occasions saved him
from defeat before Provan slammed out
his spectacular home run.
Both teams scored well-earned runs
during the first innings of the game, but
the Independents in a last-minute rally
tied the. score in the first half of the
seventh, to postpone the end of the con
test, after which the Phi Psi's were easy
outs for the fast-improving Wilhelmy.
George Pitches Well
In the other two games it was a case
of good pitching on the side of the win
ners. Rodney George of the Breakers
had little trouble with the Alpha Kappa
Lambda team, disposing of them in one,
two, three order, for the most part by
the strikeout route. He fanned the first
six men that opposed him, allowed one
walk, and then fanned another three. His
teammates could hit the fraternity pitch
er almost at will and hud little trouble
in slugging out enough hits to gain nine
runs.
The El Tigre team with Charles Hun
ter in the box and a well-balanced infield
had to be content with only a fivepoint
margin over P>ranner, but were decidedly
much superior, and are sure to be seri
ous contenders for the championship of
League V.
Following are the games scheduled for
