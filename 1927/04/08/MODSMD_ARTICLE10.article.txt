# CARDINAL NETMEN WIN ALL MATCHES FROM U.S.C. TEAM
## Squad Holds Final Practice Before Entering Annual California Meet 
### 
Stanford's crack tennis team moved
forward another place in the race for
Pacific Coast honors when it trounced
the University of Southern California
yesterday afternoon, six matches to none,
on the varsity courts. This is the last
intercollegiate practice for the team be
fore the annual meet with the University
of California on the Stanford courts
April 16.
Captain Cranston Holman, playing first
singles, had little trouble beating Everett
Miller, ranking U.S.C. man, 6-1, 6-0.
Holman was in fine fettle and bewildered
his opponent with the shots that two
summers ago won for the Stanford star
eighth place in the national tennis rank
ing list.
Ogden Beats Faulkner
Lionel Ogden won second singles from
Kenneth Faulkner, U.S.C., in two spe
tacular sets, 6-3, 6-2. Faulkner matched
a cannon-ball service against Ogden's
hard back-court driving.
Ralph McElvenny captured a close
third singles from Theron Wilson, 7-5,
6-3. McElvenny gained an early lead in
each set, only to lose it both times as
Wilson rallied in unsuccessful attempts
to save the match.
Herrington Forces
After fighting for the first set 6-3,
Alan Herrington warmed to his task and
gave Francis Hardy a good drubbing,
6-0, to win the match. Hardy had a
crafty servicc and some good volleys,
but once Herrington got hitting the ball,
his hard shots forced Hardy into errors.
Holman and Ogden made quick work
of Miller and Wilson, 6-3, 6-2, while
McElvenny and Herrington made it a
clean sweep for Stanford by trimming
Faulkner and Hardy in straight sets, 7-5,
6-3. Faulkner's hard service was an
obstacle for the Cardinals, each of them
breaking a racquet in attempting to
handle it.
