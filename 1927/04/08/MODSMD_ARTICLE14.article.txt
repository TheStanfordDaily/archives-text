# COMPARATIVE MARKS GIVE FRESHMEN EDGE IN SATURDAY'S MEET
## Babes Face San Jose State, Modesto in Last Clash Before U.C. Contest 
### 
Comparative records predict an over
whelming Stanford victory when the
1930 track men face the Modesto
Junior College and San Jose State Col
lege teams in a three-cornered contest
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning on
the old track, in their last appearance
before the "little big meet" next Tues
day, at Berkeley.
With Pogollotti in the hurdles and
possibly Berry in the pole vault loom
ing as the only Modesto winners, the
San Jose team's showing is uncertain.
Modesto's 59-63 loss to the California
babes early in the season should give
some basis of comparison between the
two freshman teams and may temper
the careless attitude of dopesters to
ward the Berkeley men.
Barring the hurdles, however, the
Cardinals stand to score heavily in
every event and to clean up on the
field. Modesto swept the shot against
California with a leading mark of 38
feet 1 inch, which at least three Stan
ford yearlings should best. Eric Krenz
is expected to lead the way in the
shot and discus, with Rothert second
in these events and first in the javelin.
He should throw the spear around 175
feet.
Dowell ought to take the broad jump
easily, with French. Adam√ü, and John
son showing well in the high leap.
Valentine is capable of 11 feet six
inches in the pole vault.
in the track events, Kingsbury, Mor
rison, Borden, and Clunie should ac
count for about five firsts. Kingsbury
has been regularly pressing Richman
in the sprints in practice, and Morri
son will probably not have much com
petition in the 440. The freshmen
should also take a majority of the
seconds and third 3.
