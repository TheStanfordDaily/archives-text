# STANFORD, CALIFORNIA CUB BASEBALL NINES START SERIES TODAY
## Cards Are Doped to Have Slight Edge in First Clash of Season 
### Merle Emry 
Following a last-minute change in
the freshman baseball schedule, the
Stanford Cubs will leave for Berkeley
this morning to meet the University
of California freshmen in the first
game of their annual baseball series.
From the results of the previous en
counters of the season and by the
comparison of scores, the two teams
are about evenly matched. If anything,
the odds swing a little toward the
Cardinals. Coach Husky Hunt states
that he has the strongest team that
Stanford has seen for some time and
that he looks for a good report from
his men, although the squad numbers
only twelve.
Bianchi Will Start
Because of the smallness of the
Cardinal team, if any of the players
should receive injuries, Hunt's men
would have rough sledding for the
other two games of the series. Bianchi,
shortstop for the yearlings, will prob
ably start in his position, but it is
doubted if he can play long because of
an injured ankle received while play
ing the Berkeley High School team.
