# RETURN OF CREW IS APPEAL OF FORMER STANFORD OARSMAN
## 
### 
"Crew should come hack to Stanford"
were the words of an old Stanford alum
nus in a fiery appeal to the rally com
mittee at their last meeting. The Stan
ford alumnus, whose name ii withheld
by request, was one of the foremost
men of Stanford's crew in his time and
was noted for pulling a mean oar.
"I hate to he sticking in'my txir,"
were his words, "but I can never help re
gretting that my old Alma Mater does
not have a crew. Even California has a
crew and it is the proud boast of one
friend of the Golden Bear that at least
we cannot beat them in crew."
"This is a situation that should not
and would not exist if Stanford men
and women could see the inspiring sight
of a crew race and watch the two famous
rivals fighting it out on the water as well
as the football field. There is nothing so
thrilling as to watch two boats racing
across the shimmering water and one
winning by a fresh coat of paint."
The rally committee felt that they
were not the proper group to undertake
an important question such as this but
finally appointed a representative to meet
with the Stanford alumni and possibly
sponsor plans to give the students of
Stanford a chance to see a crew race.
