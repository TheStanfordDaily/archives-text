# ALL-SOUTHERN CONFERENCE TEAM BATTLES CARDINALS IN STADIUM
## Potentialities of Visitors Is Practically Unknown By Local Experts BOB STREHLE TO COACH Stanford Field Stars Doped To Overcome Opponents' Track Advantage 
### Joe Carroll 
Tomorrow afternoon in the Stadium
the Stanford University track team,
whose potentialities are well known,
meets a more or less unknown quantity
when it faces a team gathered from the
ranks of the Southern Conference college
squads. Robert Strehle, Pomona coach,
whose team won the Conference cham
pionship last Saturday, will be in charge
of the stars who will travel north to
meet the Cardinals.
The power of the southern team can
not be correctly estimated, due partly to
the uncertainty that exists as to who
will compose the team that will meet
Stanford, and partly to doubts existing
as to whether the men who do come
north will be able to equal their best
marks.
The strength that the southerners are
known to possess is balanced in the
sprints, the half-mile, the two-mile, low
hurdles, javelin throw, and pole vault.
Lay-off an Aid
The Stanford team will take this meet
in full stride. Benefited to a certain ex
tent by last week's enforced lay-off, the
Cardinal stars must swing rapidly into
action. With the Big Meet on April 16
and the University of Southern Califor
nia struggle April 26, the contest Satur
day will start the Stanford trackmen
into a three weeks' period of stiff com
petition.
Irvin Tanner of Pomona has done 24
seconds flat in the low hurdles. If he can
repeat Saturday, he may win from Clar
ence West, the best Cardinal low liurd-
ler. Nichols and West, however, should
beat him in the highs, as his best time
this season has been 15 1-5, which both
Stanford hurdlers have bettered.
Competition in Sprints
Murray Schultz of Caltech, capable of
better than even time in both the 100
and the 220, and Pinney of Pomona, who
lias done the century in 10 seconds and
the furlong in 22 seconds, seem to be
the class of the field in the sprints. Rich
man will have a hard time getting better
than third in either of these races.
Scovel runs the half-mile and they
mile, but he will have his work cut out
for him if he competes in both events :
Saturday. He is best in the half.
Waite is under ten minutes in the two- !
mile. He may give Kanney the competi- I
tion that is necessary to bring the Car- |
dinal distance man up to his best efforts. I
A real battle may be expected when these !
two run eight laps. 1
Strong on Field
Stanford possesses too much strength
in the held events for the southerners. |
judging from marks made so far this I
season. Hoover has thrown the javelin
almost 190 feet, however, and he may
break up the Joaquin-Shipkey-Sparling i
combination.
One or two of the pole vaulters have :
done 12 feet and 12 feet 6 inches. Sev
eral men tied for third last week in the
Southern Conference meet, but Edmonds
and Hulsman should have little trouble j
collecting the major share of the points
in this event.

nia struggle April 26, the contest Satur
day will start the Stanford trackmen
into a three weeks' period of stiff com
petition.
Irvin Tanner of Pomona has done 24
seconds flat in the low hurdles. If he can
repeat Saturday, he may win from Clar
ence West, the best Cardinal low liurd-
ler. Nichols and West, however, should
beat him in the highs, as his best time
this season has been 15 1-5, which both
Stanford hurdlers have bettered.
Competition in Sprints
Murray Schultz of Caltech, capable of
better than even time in both the 100
and the 220, and Pinney of Pomona, who
lias done the century in 10 seconds and
the furlong in 22 seconds, seem to be
the class of the field in the sprints. Rich
man will have a hard time getting better
than third in either of these races.
Scovel runs the half-mile and they
mile, but he will have his work cut out
for him if he competes in both events :
Saturday. He is best in the half.
Waite is under ten minutes in the two- !
mile. He may give Kanney the competi- I
tion that is necessary to bring the Car- |
dinal distance man up to his best efforts. I
A real battle may be expected when these !
two run eight laps. 1
Strong on Field
Stanford possesses too much strength
in the held events for the southerners. |
judging from marks made so far this I
season. Hoover has thrown the javelin
almost 190 feet, however, and he may
break up the Joaquin-Shipkey-Sparling i
combination.
One or two of the pole vaulters have :
done 12 feet and 12 feet 6 inches. Sev
eral men tied for third last week in the
Southern Conference meet, but Edmonds
and Hulsman should have little trouble j
collecting the major share of the points
in this event.
Tomorrow afternoon in the Stadium
the Stanford University track team,
whose potentialities are well known,
meets a more or less unknown quantity
when it faces a team gathered from the
ranks of the Southern Conference college
squads. Robert Strehle, Pomona coach,
whose team won the Conference cham
pionship last Saturday, will be in charge
of the stars who will travel north to
meet the Cardinals.
The power of the southern team can
not be correctly estimated, due partly to
the uncertainty that exists as to who
will compose the team that will meet
Stanford, and partly to doubts existing
as to whether the men who do come
north will be able to equal their best
marks.
The strength that the southerners are
known to possess is balanced in the
sprints, the half-mile, the two-mile, low
hurdles, javelin throw, and pole vault.
Lay-off an Aid
The Stanford team will take this meet
in full stride. Benefited to a certain ex
tent by last week's enforced lay-off, the
Cardinal stars must swing rapidly into
action. With the Big Meet on April 16
and the University of Southern Califor
nia struggle April 26, the contest Satur
day will start the Stanford trackmen
into a three weeks' period of stiff com
petition.
