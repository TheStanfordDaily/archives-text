# Open Season for Rushing
## 
### 
With the women coming up the home stretch on the rushing race, the
last call lias been issued for the start of the men's event. The women will
finish the two-week run Sunday, and the winners will be announced on
Monday. The men start on their four-week grind Sunday, and the fra
ternity houses and the freshmen are already getting wanned up. Tomor
row most of the fraternities will be busy cleaning up the houses so that
the course will be cleared for action when the Inter fraternity Council
hres the starting gun.
The twenty-four houses at Stanford will be prepared for capable
crowds for the next month, while Encina will be practically vacated. Both
the freshmen left in the hall and those accepting dates 011 the Row will
be provided with the-best food that the campus can offer. During the
first period the fraternities will rush on alternate days, so hash, stew,
beans, and other nourishing foods will still be obtained on the Row
every 01 her day.
hor the next few weeks, both the freshmen and the fraternities will
be on exhibit. Ihe present system of rushing makes it practically impos
sible for the fraternities to fool the rushees, or for the freshmen to get
into a house on a good first impression. The evils of the old "cut-throat"
bidding have been eliminated by the Interfraternity Council. The fresh
men have as much right to be critical as has the Greek letter man. It is
impossible to keep an intelligent man in ignorance of your true worth
over a period of four weeks. The skeletons are bound to sneak out of
the closets sometime during so long a period.
It should be remembered that the honor system applies to every phase
of Stanford life. The rushing rules should be abided by because of the
gentlemen s agreement that exists between the twenty-four fraternities
011 the campus. But the freshmen are also 011 their honor. It is as much
the duty of the first-year men to see that no rules are broken in their
concern, as it is of the houses. \\ liile the honor system works well on the
whole in regard to examinations and studies, still there is the Men's
Council to check up 011 the few violations that do occur. So with rushing,
there is the Interfraternity Board of Control to receive reports of infrac
tions of the rules, and to punish the violators when the breach is deemed
to warrant it. If for no other reason than self-preservation, the frater
nities should report any violation of which they have knowledge.

marks."

finish the two-week run Sunday, and the winners will be announced on
Monday. The men start on their four-week grind Sunday, and the fra
ternity houses and the freshmen are already getting wanned up. Tomor
row most of the fraternities will be busy cleaning up the houses so that
the course will be cleared for action when the Inter fraternity Council
hres the starting gun.
The twenty-four houses at Stanford will be prepared for capable
crowds for the next month, while Encina will be practically vacated. Both
the freshmen left in the hall and those accepting dates 011 the Row will
be provided with the-best food that the campus can offer. During the
first period the fraternities will rush on alternate days, so hash, stew,
beans, and other nourishing foods will still be obtained on the Row
every 01 her day.
hor the next few weeks, both the freshmen and the fraternities will
be on exhibit. Ihe present system of rushing makes it practically impos
sible for the fraternities to fool the rushees, or for the freshmen to get
into a house on a good first impression. The evils of the old "cut-throat"
bidding have been eliminated by the Interfraternity Council. The fresh
men have as much right to be critical as has the Greek letter man. It is
impossible to keep an intelligent man in ignorance of your true worth
over a period of four weeks. The skeletons are bound to sneak out of
the closets sometime during so long a period.
It should be remembered that the honor system applies to every phase
of Stanford life. The rushing rules should be abided by because of the
gentlemen s agreement that exists between the twenty-four fraternities
011 the campus. But the freshmen are also 011 their honor. It is as much
the duty of the first-year men to see that no rules are broken in their
concern, as it is of the houses. \\ liile the honor system works well on the
whole in regard to examinations and studies, still there is the Men's
Council to check up 011 the few violations that do occur. So with rushing,
there is the Interfraternity Board of Control to receive reports of infrac
tions of the rules, and to punish the violators when the breach is deemed
to warrant it. If for no other reason than self-preservation, the frater
nities should report any violation of which they have knowledge.
"Last call for men's rushing. Fraternities and freshmen take your
marks."
