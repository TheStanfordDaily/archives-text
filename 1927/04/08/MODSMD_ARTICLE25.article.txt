By subscribing to the Intercollegiate Press Association, the Daily will
give its readers news, comments, features, and humor from the college
papers of the United States. The I.P. serv ice in the college world corre
sponds to the Associated Press and the United Press in the outside sphere.
In a recent questionnaire distributed among Stanford students, it was
found that the one demand of practically all was more college news in the
Daily. In an attempt to satisfy our readers, this new service was ob
tained. It consists of the latest news events happening at American uni
versities and colleges, it consists of the best editorials printed in student
dailies about the country, it consists of the spice of the college journalistic
humor, and it also consists of interesting feature articles.
The Daily feels that such a service will be welcomed by Stanford
students, for it will keep them in touch with the happenings in their
own world.
