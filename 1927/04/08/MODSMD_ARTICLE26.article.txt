# Another Championship Team
## 
### 
Tennis now takes its place alongside of the other championship ath
letic teams at Stanford. Tennis can now stand with football, track, and
swimming and hold its head high, for the Cardinal racket men rank with
the country's best. Yesterday Stanford defeated the University of South
ern California on the courts by a six to nothing score. The Cards won
all four singles matches and the two doubles games.
Tennis was made a major sport at Stanford mainly because of the
national ranking of the players on the Farm. Davis and Neer were thp
outstanding stars at the time when the sport was raised from minor to
major standing. Some feared that, when these two players graduated,
tennis would not deserve major sport rating. But this fear has not been
justified. Holrnan, Ogden, McElvenny, and Herrington are among the
best tennis players in the country today.
