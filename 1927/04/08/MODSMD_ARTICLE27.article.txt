G eorge Chumos, Kansas University speaker, who took third place in
the National Oratorical Contest, regards talking as a common evil. The
University Daily Kansan quotes:
"Talking is a trait I abhor. It nets nothing and usually is plain hot air.
History teaches that the greatest talkers wore not tho greatest thinkers.
Talking is an evil I am afflicted with, not in any way a virtue."
