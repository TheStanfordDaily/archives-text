A WORD FROM CORNELL
Writing with the frankness that conies
to college journalists at the end of their
career?, a retiring editor of the Cornell
Daily Sun recently wrote:
"Two so-called Cornell traditions are
at the bottom ui most of the present
undergraduate unrest and certainly have
been responsible for the sometimes hys
terical. extreme, and impassioned edi
torials which have filled these columns.
"One of these 'traditions' is that Cor
nell University usually conducts her
business in such a way as to disregard
undergraduate sentiment. By acting in a
rather arbitrary manner on some issues,
she tends to alienate the affections of
certain undergraduates.
"Our second 'tradition' which we
would dcprecate is the inherent apathy
which is characteristic of Cornell life.
The apathy of the faculty invites under
graduate apathy. We would like to see
faculty members hurling academic bricks
at each other. We would like to see
some personality, some life, some vitality,
some ideas expressed where everyone
could see them and" refute them, if pos
sible."
It is almost superfluous to say that
these criticisms can be applied to Stan
ford with a minimum strain upon the

| imagination. Time after time tire ad
! ministration antagonizes the local under
! graduates by taking action on one issue
ior another without going through the
the formality of apparently taking the
; student body -in on the secret. Ordinarily
jit is nothing more than careless over
! sight.
If the first criticism applies to the fac
ulty at Stanford, the second applies more
jto the student body. It is true that we
| have here a certain few faculty members
| who have dropped into a rut. However,
the larger part of the blame for the
! prevailing intellectual siesta on this cam
pus falls on the shoulders of the students
I themselves. It is a fact that a man who
J allows intellectual pursuits to dominate
his life is looked upon among his under
graduate associates as a queer fish. The
faculty, on the other hand, whether out
! of a sense of duty or out of genuine ad
miration, pays respect and attention to
| a student who really possesses an active,
inquiring mind.
The retiring editor of The Sun is to
ihc congratulated on calling attention to
these two causes of "undergraduate un
i rest." He has pointed out a vital need of
J the universitiesâ€”the need for closer co
, operation between student bodies and
I faculties.
