Elmer Gantry, by Sinclair Lewis. Har- I
court, Brace & Co.
"Klmer \jantrv" adds one more effigy j
to the hell of infamy in which Sinclair [
Lewis pillories types out of our national
life. They say that Sinclair Lewis j
walked up and down the land gathering ;
material for this latest novel of his, j
which has stirred up ruction from Maine ;
to California.
It was H. L. Mencken, 1 believe, who i
some time ago suggested that American j
novelists were overlooking a "bet" in the j
person of the American "preacher"—and j
intimated at the same time that no novel 1
worthy of the name with the minister for j
the hero had come from an American
pen. Mr. Lewis dedicates this novel
"with deep admiration" to H. L. Menc
ken.
Thus we have with us the Rev. Elmer !
Gantry, Baptist minister, farm imple- '
ment salesman, evangelist extraordinary, j
New Thought specialist, prosperity mon
ger, Methodist minister —and scoundrel I
de luxe. He was all of these, one after j
the other—and many other things that !
are not mentioned in polite society.
Elmer Gantry, as drawn by his crea- !
tor, is the perfect example of the wolf j
in the sheep's clothing. He is a blackleg j
in a frock coat. He is Satan masquerad- j
ing as the Good Shepherd. He is a
grinder out of unspiritual hallelujahs;
a shouter of glad tidings who has just
enough intelligence to know what the
words mean. I am unable to recall such
a perfect example of the unmitigating
blackguard in any literature, American
or otherwise. Would it be possible for
such a man as Elmer Gantry—liar, hypo
crite, betrayer of women—to rise to pre
ferment in any such calling as the minis
try? Are men so blind as to be oblivious
to the smoke where there is so much
fire ?
Certainly, not knowingly have I ever
met such a minister of the gospel as
Elmer Gantry—and if I ever do I shall
flee from him as from a pestilence. In
fact, I shouldn't worry much about his
profession, holy or otherwise —my pur
pose in life would be to get just as far
away from him as I ever could.
Throughout the whole novel there is 110
evidence of a single redeeming trait
worthy of the name.
But, since Elmer Gantry is a thing of
evil all compact—the hypocrite without
a peer since Judas —he is unforgettable.
He murders other men's lives as Macbeth
murdered Banquo; he rises on the ruins
of other men's lives to a mountain of
selfishness.
Many readers, mostly the orthodox
supporters of the church, have been
fighting to have the book suppressed.
Now, in my opinion, I can't sec how any
person of a calm and measured intelli
gence will construe this book as a "sav
age attack on the church." It may be a
savage attack 011 hypocrisy—but that is
nothing new. It is undoubtedly a fierce
indictment of modern sensationalism in
religion — particularly the evangelistic
phase of it. Elmer Gantry's career as an
evangelist covers many pages.
It should be borne in mind that Sin- \
clair Lewis is primarily a satirist—there
fore the portraits of Babbitt and Elmer
Gantry are not the representative Ameri- 1

can business man and the representative
American preacher—they are the novel
ist's way of calling our attention to our
natural meanness and lack of spirituality.
Therefore let this review of the career
of the graceless man of God end in a
holy key. Read "Elmer Gantry" with an
intelligent desire and you will understand
it as the author intended it to be. Read
it with a sense of rebellion because your
sins have found you out, and you will
miss the point. For all who understand
this aright it will be great literature.

which has stirred up ruction from Maine ;
to California.
It was H. L. Mencken, 1 believe, who i
some time ago suggested that American j
novelists were overlooking a "bet" in the j
person of the American "preacher"—and j
intimated at the same time that no novel 1
worthy of the name with the minister for j
the hero had come from an American
pen. Mr. Lewis dedicates this novel
"with deep admiration" to H. L. Menc
ken.
Thus we have with us the Rev. Elmer !
Gantry, Baptist minister, farm imple- '
ment salesman, evangelist extraordinary, j
New Thought specialist, prosperity mon
ger, Methodist minister —and scoundrel I
de luxe. He was all of these, one after j
the other—and many other things that !
are not mentioned in polite society.
Elmer Gantry, as drawn by his crea- !
tor, is the perfect example of the wolf j
in the sheep's clothing. He is a blackleg j
in a frock coat. He is Satan masquerad- j
ing as the Good Shepherd. He is a
grinder out of unspiritual hallelujahs;
a shouter of glad tidings who has just
enough intelligence to know what the
words mean. I am unable to recall such
a perfect example of the unmitigating
blackguard in any literature, American
or otherwise. Would it be possible for
such a man as Elmer Gantry—liar, hypo
crite, betrayer of women—to rise to pre
ferment in any such calling as the minis
try? Are men so blind as to be oblivious
to the smoke where there is so much
fire ?
Certainly, not knowingly have I ever
met such a minister of the gospel as
Elmer Gantry—and if I ever do I shall
flee from him as from a pestilence. In
fact, I shouldn't worry much about his
profession, holy or otherwise —my pur
pose in life would be to get just as far
away from him as I ever could.
Throughout the whole novel there is 110
evidence of a single redeeming trait
worthy of the name.
But, since Elmer Gantry is a thing of
evil all compact—the hypocrite without
a peer since Judas —he is unforgettable.
He murders other men's lives as Macbeth
murdered Banquo; he rises on the ruins
of other men's lives to a mountain of
selfishness.
Many readers, mostly the orthodox
supporters of the church, have been
fighting to have the book suppressed.
Now, in my opinion, I can't sec how any
person of a calm and measured intelli
gence will construe this book as a "sav
age attack on the church." It may be a
savage attack 011 hypocrisy—but that is
nothing new. It is undoubtedly a fierce
indictment of modern sensationalism in
religion — particularly the evangelistic
phase of it. Elmer Gantry's career as an
evangelist covers many pages.
It should be borne in mind that Sin- \
clair Lewis is primarily a satirist—there
fore the portraits of Babbitt and Elmer
Gantry are not the representative Ameri- 1

can business man and the representative
American preacher—they are the novel
ist's way of calling our attention to our
natural meanness and lack of spirituality.
Therefore let this review of the career
of the graceless man of God end in a
holy key. Read "Elmer Gantry" with an
intelligent desire and you will understand
it as the author intended it to be. Read
it with a sense of rebellion because your
sins have found you out, and you will
miss the point. For all who understand
this aright it will be great literature.
