# GEOLOGICAL PROBLEM SETTLED BY SCHENCK
## 
### 
A twenty-year-old difference of opin
ion concerning the age of certain sand
n
atones found in Western Oregon has
been more or less definitely settled by
Dr. Hubert G. Schenck, instructor in
the Geology department, as a result of
' his accurate studies of the regions in
volved.
According to Dr. Schenck, these
sandstones are of the Oligocene period
• in the earth's history, which closed
! about 10i,000,000 years ago. Stratigra
l pbic studies were hindered by climate,
vegetation, and scarcity of outcrops,
! because it is impossible to discover
a contact of two strata in Western
Oregon and follow it across hill and
i valley, as is generally possible in the
less humid climates of California.
