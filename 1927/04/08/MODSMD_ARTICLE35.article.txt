## 
### 
"Crime is naturally distasteful" and
"moral standards are high" among col
li ge men, declares Judge John Knox of
the United Stat< District Court in New
York in a recent article in the Daily
Princctonian commending the college
graduate as a citizen and upholder of
the law.
It is a "rare occasion" when a college
man appears in court, the judge avers.
"Hut,"' he adds, "whether they are better
behaved than less educated people or are
merely more skillful in escaping detec
tion is a question about which there may
well be two opinions." There is also the
possibility that the minority of college
graduates in the country's population
"may add to the impression that he ap
pears in cuurt seldom," believes Knox.
Speaking from his own observations
and experiences, however, Judge Knox
believes that college men naturally tend '
away from crime because of an inherited j
"better caliber" and a type of thought 1
and disciplinary training acquired in
preparatory school and college.
