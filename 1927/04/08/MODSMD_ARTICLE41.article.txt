# NEBRASKA FRATERNITY SUES Y.M.C.A. BRANCH FOR CANCELLED PRIZE
## Sigma Delta Chi to Demand Justice Before Council In Appeal for $20 
### 
Because the Y.M.C.A. of the Univer
sity of Nebraska refuses to pay the
local chapter of Sigma Delta Chi the
$20 prize that was offered for the best
Bkit submitted for production at the
annual University Night, the frater
nity is suing the Y.M.C.A. for the
money. The trial will take place April
19, with a professor in the law college
acting as judge, and the student coun
cil as jury.
Members of Sigma Delta Chi, na
tional professional journalism society,
â– claim that their skit was announced
as winning the competition, but that
the Y.M.C.A. has continually refused
to pay them the prize. On the other
hand, the Christian organization says
that the skit could not be performed
at the last minute because of conflict
with other numbers on the program,
and that the committee considered the
prize automatically cancelled.
The journalists cannot see the ques
tion in this light at all, so they have
brought suit to collect. They further
claim that the skit was deliberately
suppressed because of its nature. "Dur
>iam Time" is said to have been a
startling expose of fraternity politics.
