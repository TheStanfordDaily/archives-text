# PROGRAM TO INCLUDE TWO BACH SELECTIONS
## 
### 
Two selections from the pen of Bach
are listed on the organ recital program
planned by Warren D. Allen, Univer
sity organist, for tomorrow afternoon
at 4:15 o'clock. The first number,
"Fugue in E Flat," is of the type for
which Bach is famous. In his fugues
he has as many as eight themes being
played simultaneously, so entwined as
to make harmony and counterpoint.
The second composition is from the
"Chorale-Prelude" group from the Lit
tle Organ Book.
The Sherzetto in F Sharp Minor,
from "Twenty-Four Pieces" by Louis
Yierne, is one from the suite featured
in Tuesday's all-Vierne recital. Vierne
has been organist at the Cathedral of
Notre Dame in Paris for many years.
Although blind he has contributed to
the organ music of the world several
compositions which are considered im
perishable.
"Deep River," a negro spiritual, and
"Finale" from the "Grand Pi6ce Svm
phonique" by Cesar Frank, complete
the program.
