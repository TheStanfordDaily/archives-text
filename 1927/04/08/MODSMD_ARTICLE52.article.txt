# COLLEGE ACTIVITIES DECLARED BEST FOR TRAINING PUBLIC MEN
## 
### 
"There is no better training for public
life than the activities of a college," as
serted Charles F. Kerrigan, assistant to
Mayor Walker of New York, in a recent
interview given to the Daily Prince
tonian. "The pity is that so few of the
college leaders take up public careers.
They go into business or professional
life and seem to shun politics as 'bad
form.'"
Kerrigan believes that the two main
doors opening to a public career are law
and newspaper work. Lawyers naturally
gravitate toward law-making in the legis
latures and courts, while journalists are
a necessity to men in high positions as
well as to the millions of newspaper
readers.
