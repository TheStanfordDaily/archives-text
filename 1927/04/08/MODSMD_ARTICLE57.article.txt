Are you the Richard Barthelmess
"type"? Do you "emote" beautifully ;
and well? Have you aspirations for a
screen career? If so, you may be one !
of the knickered gentlemen who know
not the game of golf and who play 1
around the studios of Hollywood.
For First National Pictures at Bur-[
bank is sending two units —East and !
West —to make screen tests of the i
"ten most promising male personali-,
ties" at each of thirty-two colleges.
The budding possibilities selected will
be given eight weeks at reasonable
salaries at the studio at Burbank next
summer, with their fares paid both
ways in case an inglorious return
home is necessary. Those retained will
be given optional five-year contracts,
with chances for becoming stars.
Any one of the ten successful candi
dates, or all ten, will be offered one
of these five-year contracts, which call
for graduated salaries, starting at $100
for the first six months, and etidiug
with $750 a week for the last year.
Stanford, as well as the Universities
of California and of Southern Cali
fornia, are included in the western in
stitutions of higher learning that are
to be sifted for film talent, if any. The
Stanford campus will be visited on
May 8.
Each exploration unit consists of
the man in charge, with a camera man
and a make-up expert. John McCor-

Mick, Flint National's general man
j ager of West Coast production, will
pass 011 the tests. He is a college man,
and that is perhaps the reason why
he believes in "the value of youth,
personality, and virile earn pus charac
j teristics" in pictures.
