# CARDINALS FAVORED TO DEFEAT TROJAN MERMEN TOMORROW
## Van den Akker Selected to Take O'Connor's Place In Sprint Race 
### 
Stanford will meet the U.S.C. swim
ming team at 1 o'clock tomorrow in the
Encina pool with odds all in the Cardi
nals' favor to win. The Trojans have a
team this year that is not of champion
ship caliber, and the Cardinals are doped
to annex the majority of first and second
places.
Coach Brandsten has completed his
preliminary training period for the team,
and has a fairly definite idea of his start
ing lineup. During the past weeks he
has been trying to find a substitute for
Wally O'Connor, champion sprint star,
and has picked Van den Akker to fill his
place. This last week Karl Doerr, who
was expected to swim in the four-man
relay, left college because of a severe
attack of appendicitis,
Stanford is certain of first and second
in the 50, with both Williams and Van
den Akker having turned in exceptionally
fast times during practice. In the 100-
yard free style, Van den Akker will
probably take another first for Stanford.
Stevenson and Danford will start in the
220-yard event, while the former will
also swim in the back-stroke with Phil
Brooks. Ophuls and West will again
fight out the breast-stroke between them
selves, although U.S.C. may produce
someone who might upset the dope. Ted
Smith and Mills will be the Cardinal
entries for the diving. .
Stanford has decisively defeated every
outstanding swimming team on the coast,
including Oregon, L.A.A.C., and Cali
fornia, and if the Cardinals live up to
expectations tomorrow they will be un
disputed champions of the coast.
