# SPORTS OF 1927

"How doth the little busy 'B' im
prove each shining hour?" "Bye,
Baffy, Brassie, Bogey, Bisque—from
Bunker into Bower," I suppose, to
finish the famous question in keeping
with the Golf Alphabet. Truly the
"murmuring of innumerable B's" has
been going on ever since the inventor
of golf decided that the game should
be played with a Ball, and many a
champion and near champion's name
has begun with the second letter of
the alphabet.
Two of the most colorful of these
"B's" are Mary Browne and John
Black, runners-up, respectively, in the
women's national championship in
1924 and the United States open in
1922. Miss Browne is now awaiting
the decision of the United States Golf
Association in regard to her amateur

standing as a golfer, due to her tennis
activities as a member of C. C. Pyle's
traveling troupe of professionals;
while Black, now nearly 45 years old.
is still competing ar.d making good
scores in Western tournaments.
One of the latest golfing sensations
in America is William Burke, formerly
a caddie at Danville. Kv. In winning
the Florida open championship last
February, he not only broke the course
record at the Clearwater Country Club
with a G9, but defeated such famous
pros as Bobby Cruickshank, Bill Mehl
horn, Tommy Armour, and Mike
Brady. The last-named "B" tied for
the United States open title in 1911
and 1919. but had the misfortune to
lose the play-off both times. On Labor
Day, 1917, Brady distinguished himself
by shooting three holes-in-one in a

single round!
The British Isles have given many
famous B's to the game of golf. Among
them are John Ball, eight times win- ■
ner of the British amateur champion
ship; James Braid, five times British !
open champion, one of the longest
drivers In history, and the maker of
eleven holes-in-one; and Jim Barnes, j
United States open champion in 1921
and British open champion four years ;
later,
France has contributed Aubrey I
Boomer, French open champion in!
1921 and '22, and Baron Francois do ;
Bellet and his daughter, each of whom
won a French championship. Another
woman champion of France was
Gladys Bastin, of England; and the!
first United States women's tourna
ment was won by Mrs. C. S. Brown.:
Miss Georgiana Bishop won the crown
in 1904, and twenty-two years later
won the senior women's golf title for
the second time.

"How doth the little busy 'B' im
prove each shining hour?" "Bye,
Baffy, Brassie, Bogey, Bisque—from
Bunker into Bower," I suppose, to
finish the famous question in keeping
with the Golf Alphabet. Truly the
"murmuring of innumerable B's" has
been going on ever since the inventor
of golf decided that the game should
be played with a Ball, and many a
champion and near champion's name
has begun with the second letter of
the alphabet.
Two of the most colorful of these
"B's" are Mary Browne and John
Black, runners-up, respectively, in the
women's national championship in
1924 and the United States open in
1922. Miss Browne is now awaiting
the decision of the United States Golf
Association in regard to her amateur

standing as a golfer, due to her tennis
activities as a member of C. C. Pyle's
traveling troupe of professionals;
while Black, now nearly 45 years old.
is still competing ar.d making good
scores in Western tournaments.
One of the latest golfing sensations
in America is William Burke, formerly
a caddie at Danville. Kv. In winning
the Florida open championship last
February, he not only broke the course
record at the Clearwater Country Club
with a G9, but defeated such famous
pros as Bobby Cruickshank, Bill Mehl
horn, Tommy Armour, and Mike
Brady. The last-named "B" tied for
the United States open title in 1911
and 1919. but had the misfortune to
lose the play-off both times. On Labor
Day, 1917, Brady distinguished himself
by shooting three holes-in-one in a

single round!
The British Isles have given many
famous B's to the game of golf. Among

drivers In history, and the maker of
eleven holes-in-one; and Jim Barnes, j
