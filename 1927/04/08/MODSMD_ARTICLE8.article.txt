# CARDINAL BASEBALL TEAM CLASHES WITH BEARS AT BERKELEY
## Coach Wolter Is Confident That Cardinals Will Win First Tussle 
### 
By Edwin Randol
Coach Harry Wolter ran his Stanford
varsity baseball squad through its final
practice session yesterday before the first
'game of the annual series with the Uni
j versity of California, and feels certain
j that his men will win the Bear contest
|by a substantial score. Contrary to pre
! vious announcements, the game will be
j played in Berkeley tomorrow afternoon.
With the hardest series of the year
| ahead of it, the Stanford nine appears
; to be in an excellent state of mind, and
| the speed with which the Cardinal in
! field runs through practice points to
j ability of each man. The outfield is also
: showing up well, sensational catches
! featuring yesterday's workout.
Busch Is Star
Jim Busch, at shortstop, is by far the
i class of the infield. Nothing got by the
! inlielder in practice yesterday, while his
| throw to first from every position was
! unerring. Garibaldi displayed some good
fielding at second, while Maguire, at first,
! was scooping up grounders and receiv
jing throws excellently. Harder will start
I at third.
Wilton, Stewart, and Nissen continue
|to sparkle in the outfield, while their
j hitting in practice has improved consider
ably. Much is expected of Wilton and
Nissen in the game tomorrow, as both
1 have been getting the ball out of the in
j field consistently.
Pitchers Not Chosen
Coach Wolter was still undecided as
to his choice of pitchers, both Captain
Collins and Sobieski being in excellent
condition. It is probable, however, that
Collins will start with Sobieski finishing.
Philippi will l>e held in reserve, although
| Coach Wolter feels that he will not be
J needed.
Reports from Berkeley to the effect
| that the Bears are also showing tip well
|in practice indicate that the Cardinals
| will have their hands full. Coach Carl
Zamlocli has a heavy hitting aggregation,
| and it will take plenty of effort on the
part of the Stanford pitchers to turn
back such sluggers as Rollie Douthit.
The second game r. scheduled defi
nitely for Tuesday, April 12, at Stanford,
while the third contest will also be held
lon the local diamond on Saturday, April
16, immediately after the Big Meet with
the University of California.

the University of California.
By Edwin Randol
Coach Harry Wolter ran his Stanford
varsity baseball squad through its final
practice session yesterday before the first
'game of the annual series with the Uni
j versity of California, and feels certain
j that his men will win the Bear contest
|by a substantial score. Contrary to pre
! vious announcements, the game will be
j played in Berkeley tomorrow afternoon.
With the hardest series of the year
| ahead of it, the Stanford nine appears
; to be in an excellent state of mind, and
| the speed with which the Cardinal in
! field runs through practice points to
j ability of each man. The outfield is also
: showing up well, sensational catches
! featuring yesterday's workout.
Busch Is Star
Jim Busch, at shortstop, is by far the
i class of the infield. Nothing got by the
! inlielder in practice yesterday, while his
| throw to first from every position was
! unerring. Garibaldi displayed some good
fielding at second, while Maguire, at first,
! was scooping up grounders and receiv
jing throws excellently. Harder will start
I at third.
Wilton, Stewart, and Nissen continue
|to sparkle in the outfield, while their
j hitting in practice has improved consider
ably. Much is expected of Wilton and
Nissen in the game tomorrow, as both
1 have been getting the ball out of the in
j field consistently.
Pitchers Not Chosen
Coach Wolter was still undecided as
to his choice of pitchers, both Captain
Collins and Sobieski being in excellent
condition. It is probable, however, that
Collins will start with Sobieski finishing.
Philippi will l>e held in reserve, although
| Coach Wolter feels that he will not be
J needed.
Reports from Berkeley to the effect
| that the Bears are also showing tip well
|in practice indicate that the Cardinals
| will have their hands full. Coach Carl
Zamlocli has a heavy hitting aggregation,
| and it will take plenty of effort on the
part of the Stanford pitchers to turn
back such sluggers as Rollie Douthit.
The second game r. scheduled defi
nitely for Tuesday, April 12, at Stanford,
while the third contest will also be held
lon the local diamond on Saturday, April
16, immediately after the Big Meet with
the University of California.
