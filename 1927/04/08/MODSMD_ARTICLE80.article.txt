# LIGHT OPERA HERO IS FORMER SANTA CLARAN
## 
### 
Perry Askam, who will be seen in
the role of Prince Carol of Latavia in
"Castles in the Air" at the New Stan
ford Theatre Wednesday night, April
13, first became interested in theatri
cals while attending Santa Clara Uni
versity a few years ago.
In "The Passing Show of 1921" he
made his first professional appearance.
So pleased were the Shuberts with
the young baritone that they engaged
him to play with the original "Blossom
Time" company and subsequently with
the "Passing Show of 1923."
