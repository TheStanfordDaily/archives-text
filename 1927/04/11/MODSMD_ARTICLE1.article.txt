# BEAR BASEBALL TEAM TO MEET STANFORD HERE
## Opening Game of California Series Is Scheduled For Tomorrow INFIELD WORK STRESSED Wolter Will Start Captain Steve Collins Against California Batters 
### 
Although the opening game of the
annual Stanford-California baseball
series was slated for last Saturday,
rain again caused the postponement of
the contest. The opener is now sched
uled for tomorrow afternoon on the
Stanford diamond; the second en
counter will be held in Berkeley on
Thursday of this week, and the final
game will be played immediately after
the Big Meet here Saturday.
The enforced inactivity of both the
Cardinal and Bear squads may result
in sloppy infield work tomorrow, but
both coaches plan to have their men
on the field for long practice sessions
this afternoon, and hope to regain the
pitch of perfection reached late last
week. Infield practice will be particu
larly stressed.
Captain Steve Collins is expected
to serve in the box for Stanford for
the first encounter, Sobieski in the
second, and Collins and Philippi again
in the third. California's chances rest
with the performance of Nemecheck,
veteran hurler, Jacobsen, and Hill.
Busch and Garibaldi at shortstop
and second base, respectively, con
tinue to show up as the classiest com
bination of the two teams, while the
support of Maguire at first and Harder
at third makes the Stanford infield one
that will cause the Bears plenty of
trouble. The Cardinals also present a
hard-hitting aggregation, and if Coach
Harry Wolter's men can obtain an
early lead, an easy Stanford victory
is predicted.
