As Easter Sunday falls on April 17,

for Easter morning.
Dr. Charles Gardner will interpret

Memorial Church. A special musical
program is planned, including "Lo, the
Tomb is Empty," an anthem by
Coombs, with a contralto solo by Es

At 4 o'clock in the afternoon in the
Memorial Church, Warren D. Allen
has arranged a program of Easter mu

assisted by a ti'ombone choir. This
program will include "The Glorious
Day Doth Now Appear," op. 65, by
Sigfrid Karg-Elert; Prelude to "Lohen

on Mount Rubidoux," by Harvey B.
Gaul; "In Paradisum," by Dubois;
"Praise the Lord, 0 My Soul," op. G5,

rexit!" by Oreste Ravenello.
The Sigfrid Karg-Elert numbers are
choral-improvisations of an old Ger
man Easter hymn, "Ershcienen ist der
herrlich Tag."
