# MODESTO, SAN JOSE TRACKMEN WIN FROM CARDINAL FRESHMEN
## High Point Honors Won by Kingsbury of Stanford; Relay Race Slow 
### Doug Fuller 
! Combining encouraging strength in
: most events with mediocrity or utter
weakness in a few, Dink Templeton's
freshman track squad was forced to
! accept a 67*£ to defeat in the
rain Saturday morning at the hands
of the united Modesto Junior College
and San Jose State College teams.
Weakness in the hurdles was fatal
I to any chances the 1930 men had for
victory. In neither of the barrier races
did the Cardinal representatives get
j within shouting distance of the win
! ners.
Sprinter Looks Good
Kingsbury's showing was a treat to
Stanford supporters on the lookout for
| sprint stars. The Carmel sprinter took
both the century and furlong and
looked good in doing it.
1 Eric Krenz made his usual impres-
I sive showing in the weights. Rotliert
: tossed the shot 44 feet 5 inches, but
fell below his usual level in the javelin.
Babes Ready for Bears
Addition of the marks of Morrison
; in the 440 and Dowell and Beattie in
the broad jump to those in the sprints
and weights should be sufficient to
t trouble the U.C. babes when the fresh
men meet on the Berkeley track at
3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
