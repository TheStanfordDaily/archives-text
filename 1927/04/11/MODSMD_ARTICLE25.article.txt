# A 						Big Week Ahead
## 
### 
Today starts the biggest week of the spring quarter. With the excep
tion of the week of the big football game in November it is the most im
portant time of the whole year at Stanford. This week-end Stanford
meets its old rival, California, in three sports. This week the alumni
come back to the campus for a short visit. Besides the week is filled with
important events in all lines of activities.
The Big Track Meet is the center of interest. While Stanford is
conceded the edge in the annual meet, excitement always runs high when
the two universities don track togs. The results of the IJear-C ard track
meet is not decided until the relay race has been run, and the points added
up. And how many meets have been decided by that mile!
Stanford plays California in a three game baseball series this week.
The first contest is scheduled for Tuesday, the second for Thursday, and
the final game for Saturday after the track meet. Should the first two
contests be divided, Saturday's match would decide the baseball cham
pionship of the year. Stanford's tennis team will endeavor to prove its
superiority over California racket men in the morning, next Saturday.
For the benefit of the alumni and interested students, there will be
a mounted military < rill by the Reserve Officers Training Corps, and a
polo .tjame on the day of the P>i<j Meet. Nine classes will hold reunions
at luncheons SaturrUy noon. There will be a tea. an All-Stanford, supper
in the Memorial Court and an All-Stanford dance in the basketball
Pavilion on the same day. During the supper, the band and the glee club
will entertain with musical numbers. Gordon Davis is also arranging
several stunts for the supper.
But all the events are not scheduled for Saturday. A sport rally will
be held on the shores of Lake Lagunita Thursday night. The Rally Com
mittee is also staging a feature event at noon of the same day.
The debaters will have a busy week as well as the athletes. Tues
day is the date set for the Stanford-Nevada argument on the question:
"Resolved, That newspaper reporters should be barred from the court
room during trials." Then on Thursday night the annual J off re Medal
Debate will be held in the Assembly Hall. Stanford and California will
debate on the general question: "French problems in relation to Italy
since the Armistce." The specific question will be announced later.
Music lovers have not been neglected and left out of this gala enter
tainment. Roland Hayes, negro tenor, will sing in the Assembly Mail
on Tuesday, and on Friday a program of Choral preludes by Bach will
be sung by the University Choir in the Memorial Church.
Jt is also rumored that the scholarship department of the University
has a few events scheduled for the week. But an examination or two
cannot distract from the spirit of the time. It just rounds out the week's
program.

cannot distract from the spirit of the time. It just rounds out the week's
program.
Today starts the biggest week of the spring quarter. With the excep
tion of the week of the big football game in November it is the most im
portant time of the whole year at Stanford. This week-end Stanford
meets its old rival, California, in three sports. This week the alumni
come back to the campus for a short visit. Besides the week is filled with
important events in all lines of activities.
The Big Track Meet is the center of interest. While Stanford is
conceded the edge in the annual meet, excitement always runs high when
the two universities don track togs. The results of the IJear-C ard track
meet is not decided until the relay race has been run, and the points added
up. And how many meets have been decided by that mile!
Stanford plays California in a three game baseball series this week.
The first contest is scheduled for Tuesday, the second for Thursday, and
the final game for Saturday after the track meet. Should the first two
contests be divided, Saturday's match would decide the baseball cham
pionship of the year. Stanford's tennis team will endeavor to prove its
superiority over California racket men in the morning, next Saturday.
For the benefit of the alumni and interested students, there will be
a mounted military < rill by the Reserve Officers Training Corps, and a
polo .tjame on the day of the P>i<j Meet. Nine classes will hold reunions
at luncheons SaturrUy noon. There will be a tea. an All-Stanford, supper
in the Memorial Court and an All-Stanford dance in the basketball
Pavilion on the same day. During the supper, the band and the glee club
will entertain with musical numbers. Gordon Davis is also arranging
several stunts for the supper.
But all the events are not scheduled for Saturday. A sport rally will
be held on the shores of Lake Lagunita Thursday night. The Rally Com
mittee is also staging a feature event at noon of the same day.
The debaters will have a busy week as well as the athletes. Tues
day is the date set for the Stanford-Nevada argument on the question:
"Resolved, That newspaper reporters should be barred from the court
room during trials." Then on Thursday night the annual J off re Medal
Debate will be held in the Assembly Hall. Stanford and California will
debate on the general question: "French problems in relation to Italy
since the Armistce." The specific question will be announced later.
Music lovers have not been neglected and left out of this gala enter
tainment. Roland Hayes, negro tenor, will sing in the Assembly Mail
on Tuesday, and on Friday a program of Choral preludes by Bach will
be sung by the University Choir in the Memorial Church.
Jt is also rumored that the scholarship department of the University
has a few events scheduled for the week. But an examination or two
cannot distract from the spirit of the time. It just rounds out the week's
program.
