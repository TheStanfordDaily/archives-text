# Changing Its Mind
## 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the Stanford-California track meet this week-end
will be sold in the Old Union Thursday. The Hoard of Athletic Control
has reversed its stand, and will allow students one more chance to secure
rooters' seats for the Big Meet.
The Hoard of Athletic Control is to be congratulated fin this change
of policy. For the Board to have refused to change its plan despite ad
verse public opinion would have been the height of folly. To use power
in such an arbitrary manner would have been against the very principles
of democratic government (if such high sounding phrase can be used in
reference to an athletic organization.)
When it was announced that the seat sale would close two weeks be
fore the day of the meet, the Daily took a definite stand against the deci
sion because it was felt that the students were not being given a fair
chance to secure tickets. The Daily feels that it is the newspaper's duty
to see that the students are given a square deal, especially in reference
to a matter which is so close to the undergraduates, as buying tickets.
The track meet Saturday is for Stanford and California students, first,
and for the general public, second. The students should be given a fair
chance to secure the precious cardboards before the general public is
turned loose on them.
But the Daily's stand was misunderstood by the Athletic Board. The
Board felt hurt, and took the whole affair as a personal matter. There
should be no- feud between the two organizations, but rather a spirit of
co-operation.
So the dove of peace has again settled on the Stanford Campus.
