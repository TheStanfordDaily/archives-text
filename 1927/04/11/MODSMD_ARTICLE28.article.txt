Palmerston, by Phillip Guedella: Put
nam.
The career of Lord Palmerston,
stretching from the days of the Re
gency to the heyday of Victoria, cov
ered a period in the world's history
that taken as a whole cannot fail to
be of universal interest. It is in this
period that Phillip Guedella brilliantly
revives; and in the foreground stands
Palmerston, suave man of the world,
shrewd diplomat, and, above all, typi
cal Englishman.
The last phrase strikes the keynote
of Mr. Guedella's book, and provides
it with universal appeal. One need not
be interested in English history and
politics to read "Palmerston" with
pleasure; one need only to have a de
sire to know and understand an ex
traordinary personality which yet em
bodied most of the qualities which the
average Englishman — and for that
matter the average man in many
climes —holds dear.
Palmerston, the apostle of common
sense; Palmerston, the statesman of
undivided loyalty to the Empire; Pal
merston. who kept his diplomatic
nerve when others —even Prime Min
isters — wavered; Palmerston, who
rode horseback beside the young
Queen Victoria, with Lord Melbourne
on the other side; Palmerston, who
married at fifty-eight and was happy—
in short, a handsome, sane, well-bred
Englishman almost to his dying day—

, that is the interesting picture that Mr.
! Guedella draws. And how he draws it!
As to Lord Palmerston himself, says
youth—the ability to adjust himself
diplomatically whenever the sky of
Europe changed overnight—as it often
i did. Conservative enough to be sane,
but liberal enough to look ahead—
| that was Palmerston, and to that mid-
I die road of common sense, carrying
with it bold indifference to the shibbo
-1 leth of party, he undoubtedly owed
' the almost constant successes of his
i political career. He was the difference
between a politician and a statesman.
■ Thus does Mr. Guedella make an
j admirable and convincing figure of his
hero. "Palmerston" is perhaps the
j most spectacular book Mr. Guedella
! has ever written; and it is certainly
j among the most brilliant of biogra
! phies.
Introducing the fact that spring nov
els have begun to trickle in and in
crease the winter of our discontent.
] Not that we have to read them all.
No, indeed. That is what reviewers
j are for—and there are even more re-
I viewers than novelists. Boni & Live
right are printing "Napoleon, the Man
of Destiny," by Emil Ludwig, and
| Putnams are publishing this month
I "Wilhelm 11, the Last of the Kaisers,"
j by the same author. Mr. Ludwig by
j (lie way writes biography with the
j creative eye. These two books should
. do well.
