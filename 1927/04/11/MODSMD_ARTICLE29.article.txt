# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
During the past year there has been
considerable thievery in Palo Alto,
traceable to Stanford students â€”very
much to my regret as a Stanford man.
There have been instances of stealing
automobile tires, red lights from piles
of construction, various articles of
furniture from the theatres, bicycles,
chickens, and even automobiles. The
most recent case that has developed
is that of the taking of a mirror worth
$60 from the New Stanford Theatre
by three students from Encina Hall.
It would appear to me that honesty
should be at least one of the attri
butes of a Stanford man. Recognition
of property rights is fundamental; dis

1 regard of property rights has long
1 since ceased to be a joke. Up to the
present time the usual punishment
! meted out to offenders in such cases
has been the imposition of a small
fine. However, in the present, a jail
' sentence has been imposed with the
! proviso that it may be served out
I piecemeal on successive Sundays, and
hereafter jail sentences will be the
rule, rather than fines. I trust tliat
there will be no further occasions for
i Stanford men to appear in the Palo
Alto Police Court, or any other police
j court, for that matter.

i Judge of the Police Court of the City
of Palo Alto.
