PENDRAGON PLAYERS, Palo Alto
High School.
Stanford and ex-Stanford men and
i
| women carried off a large proportion
of the honors at the Pendragon Play
-1 ers' group of four one-act productions
! Kiven Friday at thr Palo Alto Union
High School, not only in acting, but
1 more particularly in writing. "The
Devil Loves You," by Webster Street,
author of the 1925 Junior Opera, was
easily the best of the group.
Professor Percy A. Martin as the
"Devil" was excelleftt, in spite of the
poor tit of his fights. He was a pleas
ant devil, a most-companionable, lik
able, good-sport devil throughout.
"Living Furniture," a translation
from the Russian by Mrs. Elizabeth
Lan?, dramatized by Genevieve Downs,
was an amusing fantasy in which a
man makes human beings into larrips,
chairs, bodks, wheel spokes, and even
designs on his wall paper, only to
have them revolt and overpower him
in the end.
"Youth" and"The Ballad of Reading
Gaol" completed the program. While
the former was a fizzle of bad direc
tion. bad acting for the mo,st part, and
glaring lights which cast silhouettes
of the people off-stage and kept the
principal actors mostly in a shadow,
the ballad, a dramatization of Oscar
Wilde's poem, rose to professional
heights in elocution qualities and scenic
and lighting effects,
