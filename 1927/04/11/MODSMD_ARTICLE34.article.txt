# ASSEMBLY LECTURER DISCUSSES AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN EUROPE
## Influence of U.S. History On League Traced by Sir Henry Lunn 
### 
"The British Commonwealth of Na
tions ;;oes forth to new life, having
learned the lesson of 'co-operation, not
domination' from the United States."
This was the final statement which
Sir Henry Lunn, British lecturer, made
in his address at Friday's assembly.
He traced through English and Ameri
can history since the Revolution evi
dences of American influence on Eu
rope and particularly on the workings
of the League of Nations.
Sir Henry stressed the nearness of
the nations today, as compared with
their state of isolation in Washing
ten's time which prompted his famous
policy, "no foreign entanglements,"
with the observation that "the world
is very closely bound together. The
distance between the United States
and England is now bridged by mod
ern inventions, bringing about, such
proximity of the two nations that it
makes the term 'foreign complications'
absurd in the light of history."

Comparing conditions in Europe
after the Great War with those in the
United States around 1786, Sir Henry
pointed out that the same problem of
the relative power of great and small
states has confronted both the Con
stitution Committee and the League of
Nations, and that the same difficulties
which recently troubled Europe often
endangered the young republic in
America. On this point he said that
"the treaty of 1814, with Great Britain,
set au example to the League of Na
tions of what a frontier ought to be
like.
"If it took three or four generations
for thirteen states to ac hieve national
unity," he continued, "is not inevi
table that the whole world, in at
tempting to bring war to an end,
would find many more difficulties in
the way?"
