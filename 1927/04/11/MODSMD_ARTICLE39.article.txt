# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"By the 'CV by the 'C,' by the beau
tiful 'C'," —Remember the popular one
step of twelve years ago, that went
something like that? It makes a rather j
appropriate lead for any discussion of j
golfers whose names begin with the
third letter of the alphabet, especially
when it is noted that the United States
title has been held on ten different
occasions by golfers of the fair sex
who spell their last names with a
capital "C." The men, however, have
not done so well in this respect, as no
United States or British amateur or
open championship was ever won by
a "C" golfer.
The present ruling queen of "Beau- j
tiful C's" is Mile Simone Thion de la j
Chaume, the "Lily of France," who is |
18 years old and holds the golf cham- ,
pionship of her native land by virtue
of a victory over the famous Cecil
Leitch of England. Glenna Collett,
U.S. titleholder in 1922 and"25, is the j
leading light among the "plain and I
fan-C" golfers at present, and will ]
soon be sailing to compete for the '
British women's crown. Miss Dorothy !
Campbell won the British women's j
title in 1909 and '11, and the U.S. title :
in 1909, '10, and '24, the last time as j
Mrs. Hurd. Other "C" champions are j
Miss Edith Cummings, winner in 1923; |
and the Curtis sisters, Margaret and '
Harriet, who won four titles and three i

runner-up positions between them. An
other "C-going whacker," Miss Doris
Chambers, won the British title in
1923.
There are, however, several very
prominent linksmen who come under
this category, chief among them being
three professionals, Bobby Cruick
shank, of Scotland and America;
Archie Compston, of England; and
"Lighthorse Harry" Cooper, of Texas.
Cruickshank tied with Bobby Jones in
the U.S. open at Inwood in 1923, and
has been one of the leading winners
of the recent winter season. Compston,
who is almost twice as big as "Wee
Bob," toured America early in 1926
with Arnaud Massey, coming over here
with a fine record as British profes
sional champion and the reputation of
being one of the longest drivers in
the game. Harry Cooper jumped into
in 1925 by shooting 18 holes in
60>, then won the California $10,000
open tournament in January 1926.
Henry Cinci and Louis Costello are
two other prominent pros, while
among the U.S. amateurs are Keefe
Carter, Don Carrick, Dexter Cum
mings, Capt. E. F. Carter, D. Clarke
Corkran, Ira Crouch, and Emerson
Carey, Jr. Dave Campbell, once New
Jersey open champion, is the youngest
of seven golfing brothers. W. Camp
bell was runner-up in the first U.S.
open championship, back in 1894.

step of twelve years ago, that went
something like that? It makes a rather j
appropriate lead for any discussion of j
golfers whose names begin with the
third letter of the alphabet, especially
when it is noted that the United States
title has been held on ten different
occasions by golfers of the fair sex
who spell their last names with a
capital "C." The men, however, have
not done so well in this respect, as no
United States or British amateur or
open championship was ever won by
a "C" golfer.
The present ruling queen of "Beau- j
tiful C's" is Mile Simone Thion de la j
Chaume, the "Lily of France," who is |
18 years old and holds the golf cham- ,
pionship of her native land by virtue
of a victory over the famous Cecil
Leitch of England. Glenna Collett,
U.S. titleholder in 1922 and"25, is the j
leading light among the "plain and I
fan-C" golfers at present, and will ]
soon be sailing to compete for the '
British women's crown. Miss Dorothy !
Campbell won the British women's j
title in 1909 and '11, and the U.S. title :
in 1909, '10, and '24, the last time as j
Mrs. Hurd. Other "C" champions are j
Miss Edith Cummings, winner in 1923; |
and the Curtis sisters, Margaret and '
Harriet, who won four titles and three i

runner-up positions between them. An
other "C-going whacker," Miss Doris
Chambers, won the British title in
1923.
There are, however, several very
prominent linksmen who come under
this category, chief among them being
three professionals, Bobby Cruick
shank, of Scotland and America;
Archie Compston, of England; and
"Lighthorse Harry" Cooper, of Texas.
Cruickshank tied with Bobby Jones in
the U.S. open at Inwood in 1923, and
has been one of the leading winners
of the recent winter season. Compston,
who is almost twice as big as "Wee
Bob," toured America early in 1926
with Arnaud Massey, coming over here
with a fine record as British profes
sional champion and the reputation of
being one of the longest drivers in
the game. Harry Cooper jumped into
in 1925 by shooting 18 holes in
60>, then won the California $10,000
open tournament in January 1926.
Henry Cinci and Louis Costello are
two other prominent pros, while
among the U.S. amateurs are Keefe
Carter, Don Carrick, Dexter Cum
mings, Capt. E. F. Carter, D. Clarke
Corkran, Ira Crouch, and Emerson
Carey, Jr. Dave Campbell, once New
Jersey open champion, is the youngest
of seven golfing brothers. W. Camp
bell was runner-up in the first U.S.
open championship, back in 1894.
