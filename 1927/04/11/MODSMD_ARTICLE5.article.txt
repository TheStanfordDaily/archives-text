# CARDINAL SWIMMERS WIN DECISIVE VICTORY FROM SOUTHERN TEAM
## Trojan Mermen Take Second Place Only in Slow Backstroke Race 
### 
The three teams that U.S.C. sent up
to battle against Stanford during the
past week received little kindness at
the hands of the Cardinals. The/Tro
jans lost their baseuall game 4-3, their
tennis matches 5-0, and Friday after
noon in their final try, their swimming
meet 51-8.
Stanford started in on the first event
and took every first and second place
with the exception of the backstroke
race. Since the U.S.C. swimmers did
not offer mucli competition, the times
were all unusually poor.
Van den Akker Wins
Van den Akker started the Cardinal
victories by capturing the 50-yard free
style, beating out Williams, also of
Stanford, and Chang, the Chinese
swimmer who was competing under
the Trojan colors.
Captain Carl Stevenson took the
first of his first places by passing
Bowers of the Trojans in the middle
of the last lap in the 100-yard back.
Smith Finishes Strong
Ophuls and Smith, both of Stanford,
placed one and two in the breast
stroke, beating out Bittke of U.S.C.
Ophuls was never bothered by either
of the others, but Smith took second
only after passing Bittke in the last
lap. Showing themselves clearly super
ior to Elliott, Van den Akker and
Christensen, who had the closest finish
of the day, brought eight points more
to the Stanford score in the 100.

Akker (S), Williams (S), Chang
