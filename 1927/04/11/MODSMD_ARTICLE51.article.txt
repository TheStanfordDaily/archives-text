# DR. STOREY EXPLAINS GRADING CHANGE IN MEN'S GYM COURSES
## Instructors Need Means of Checking on Interest, Work of Classes 
### 
"Men's physical education courses
have boen placed on an A, B, and C
grading basis for the same reasons
that other courses use that system,"
stated Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director
of Encina gymnasium, when ques
tioned concerning the factors behind
the grading change introduced in gym
classes this quarter.
"As in any other class," he ex
plained, "some method of checking up
on the interest and work of a student
is valuable, especially for purposes
of future reference and recommenda
tions.
"The instructor has always been
able to form a definite opinion of his
students' work; he could never express
the differences under the old plus
minus system. Now, except in very
Jarge classes, grading may be carried
on accurately, and the records will
show whether a student passed by the
'skin of his teeth' or did well."
The new system provides for grad
ing on four scores: intelligent effort,
acquisition of knowledge, control of
knowledge, practice of appropriate
health habits. The essence of the rule
is that "credit must not be recom
mended on the basis of mere attend
ance."
