# STUDENTS WILL VOTE ON NEW CONSTITUTION WITHIN THREE WEEKS
## 
### 
"The revised constitution of the
Student Body will probably be put to
a student vote on Quad in less than
three weeks," declared Robert C.
Littler, chairman of the Constitution
Revision committee.
The committee, which has been
working for several mouths on the
constitution, held a meeting Wednes
day afternoon to make minor changes
in the wording. A special grammar
committee has been working on the
grammatical perfection of the docu
ment. The final draft will be made
at a meeting next Wednesday after
noon from 4 to 6 in the A.S.S.U. office,
at which time it is hoped that the re
vised constitution can be completed.
It will then be submitted to the Execu
tive Committee the following week
and will have to be passed by that
body before it is put to a vote.
