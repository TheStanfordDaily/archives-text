# BIG CREW EXHIBITION PLANNED FOR CAMPUS BY RALLY COMMITTEE
## Alumnus Claims Stanford Has Plenty of Men For Two Shells 
### 
Stanford students will soon have a
chance to see an exhibition crew race
through the efforts of the Rally Com
| mittee and judge for themselves
i whether they wish to have the return
of this thrilling and exciting sport.
This decision came as the result of
the fiery appeal of a former Stanford
alumnus (name withheld by request).
A representative of the Rally Com
mittee sent to witness the Bear-Husky
race was so impressed that he de
clared it was the duty of the Rally
Committee to give Stanford men and
women a chance to see an exhibition
race. A committee has been appointed
to work with the Stanford alumnus.
"No one will ever know the great
' joy that it will bring to my heart if I
| can aid the return of crew at Stan
i ford," stated the alumnus, former
| Stanford oarsman, yesterday."I will
J do my best for this worthy cause. I
was nearly broken-hearted when I
| first came here to see if I could revive
this sport of kings, for it seemed that
! crew was nearly as extinct as the
| dink. One student said that a shell
I was something used in pistols. An
other thought that a bow was part of
' a tree.
j "The Rally Committee is entering
| into this plan whole-heartedly and has
j already made arrangements to secure
| two shells and the men to man them.
Since time is at a premium this work
is being done secretly. The time and
place of the race will be announced
later. I am confident that there is
plenty of material for crew on the
campus as I have seen a number of
men capable of developing a wonderful
stroke. *
"It will be a turning point in the
history of the University and a day
that will be remembered, when Stan
ford gets into the swim again. From
that time on the Cardinal will reign
! supreme on water as well as on land."
