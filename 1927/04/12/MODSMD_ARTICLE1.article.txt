# STANFORD BABE TEAM FAVORED IN TRACK MEET
## Morrison May Lead in 440; Victory in Relay Event, Hurdles Uncertain STANFORD FAST IN HEATS Eric Krenz Expected to Win Discus, Shot Put for Redshirt Squad 
### Douglas Fuller 
Dink Templeton's freshman track
squad will leave from the Union this
noon for Berkeley to meet the Bear
Cubs in the annual track and field con
test. The meet will start at 3 o'clock
this afternoon on the California track.
The Stanford team is favored to win
by a comfortable margin.
Over at Berkeley an even meet is
hoped for, but comparative records
give the Cardinals a definite edge.
Modesto Junior College gathered 59
points from the Bruins in a dual meet
held two weeks ago. Combined with
San Jose Teachers College last Satur
day, the same aggregation was only
able to collect markers in a
triple meet with the freshmen.
Eric Krenz to Star
On the track the teams appear to
be evenly matched, but the Cardinal
babes should ruu up many points on
the field. Eric Krenz, former inter
scholastic discus champion, is practi
cally a cinch for first places in both
the shot and discus, and is also sched
uled to break the existing records in
both events, made last year at 44 feet
inches and 132 feet 6 inches by
Herb Fleishhacker and Ray Tandy of
Stanford. Krenz bettered 146 feet in
the discus Saturday.
Do well, Beattie, and Kingsbury
should sweep the broad jump, and
Rothert is expected to capture seconds
in the shot and discus, and a first in
the javelin. No Bear frosh have ap
proached Cardinal fiejd marks except
in the high jump and pole vault.
Sprints Will Be Fast
Barring an upset, the sprint races
between Kingsbury and Colbourn, the
U.C. star, should result in victories at
fast times for the former. In the 440
MorrTSOn of the Cards seems due to
lead the way to the tape by a second
or two. He has no form to speak of,
but he is strong and his time of 51
flat in the San Jose-Modesto meet was
excellent.
The 880 is a toss-up with Borden
and Jeunings having the edge, since
Baker of California is declared ineligi
ble. Lyons of the Bears and Clunie will
probably stage a close finish in the
mile, with the Cub entry favored
slightly.
Hurdles Unpromising
Neither of the teams has any par
ticularly promising hurdlers entered,
but on the strength of last Saturday's
perfornvance at Stanford, one could
not go far wrong in conceding the
Cubs a pair of wins here. When it
comes to the relay event Stanford ad
herents will feel a lot safer if the meet
is already won. Neither relay team is
especially fast, but the Bears should
finish a fair distance ahead.
