# YEARLING TEAM MEETS CUBS IN SECOND TUSSLE
## Freshman Baseball Outfit May Win Championship In Return Game PRACTICE WITH VARSITY Bill Simkins Will Start in Pitcher's Box Against California Men 
### 
In spite of the rainy weather, the
freshman baseball squad, victors over
the 13ear Cubs, were sent through a
light practice with the varsity nine
yesterday in preparation for the sec
ond game of the Stanford-California
freslnnan series here tomorrow.
Players in Form
Batting, infield, and outfield prac
tice constituted the main workout. No
injuries have developed from the Cali
fornia game last Friday, and if the
men remain in their conditions. Coach
Husky Hunt's players should be at top
form.
From the manner in which the be
ginners went after the infield hits
and long-pitched fiies of the varsity,
a seriousness of purpose cannot be
mistaken. The freshmen are apparent
ly not over-confident from their 12 to
9 victory over the California team and
are set on winning the game and cap
turing the pennant a second time from
the Blue and Gold.
Strong Lineup
With Berg in the outfield and Cap
tain Laird 011 third, Storey on second,
Bianchi at shortstop, and Hadenfelt
covering first, the freshmen present a
strong infield and outfield combination
which proved effective at least in the
first game of the series. Simkins' arm
is in fine shape, Hunt reports, and he
should go even stronger in his second
appearance in the box than he did in
his fii'st. Leverenz will be ready to
relieve Simkins. Sparks will cover the
home plate for the babes.
