# FUNDS SOLICITED TO FILL Y.M.C.A. BUDGET ON STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
Four earnest young men today walk
the Campus.
They are soliciting money for the
support of the Y.M.C.A. They would
like to get at least $800 from the stu
dents for the support of the student
service organization, but are not ex
cessively optimistic. If the $800 is se
cured, it will represent a little less
than one-fifteenth of the $L1,9-i> the
Y.M.C.A. estimated it would need to
carry on its work this year among the
men of the University and the school
boys of Palo Alto. Finance campaigns
are now in progress among Palo Alto
business men and citizens, faculty,
and other friends. These efforts are
under the direction of Professor Rufus
L. Green, Karl Montague Cowdery, as
sistant registrar, and the "V board
of directors. More than $ 15P.5 was re
cently secured from parents of stu
dents, solicited by mail.
Soliciting funds on the Campus, how
ever, is not being done as a campaign.
The student body as a whole will not
formally be invited to contribute as in
former years. The committee will ap
proach only members of the Y.M.C.A.
and others who for any reason may
wish to financially aid the organiza
tion.
Contributions may also be left at
the*"Y" building on the Campus, with
the secretaries or any members.
