# WOMEN TO VOTE ON DANCING PRODUCTION QUESTION TOMORROW
## 
### 
A straw vote by Stanford women on
Hie question of a Fiesta or a dance
drama for next year will be held on
Quad tomorrow in connection with the
W.A.A. and Women's Council election.
The vote will not be final, but will be
used to obtain an indication of the
general feeling among the women on
the question.
Mrs. Ruth Calvin in a recent inter
view expressed herself in favor of an
other dance drama. "The salient dif
ferences between the two," she said,
"are that the fiesta is given outdoors
in spring quarter and includes all wo
men, whereas the dance drama <s
given indoors in winter quarter and in
cludes only those women who are dis
tinctly interested.
"The disadvantages under which a
fiesta must of necessity be produced
make it inadvisable to attempt another
one next year. There are no seating
facilities for outdoor productions of
this sort, and practically no lighting
facilities. Expenses for a fiesta are
several times greater than those for a
dance drama, last year's Fiesta costing
approximately $2500. whereas the
dance drama last quarter cost $150.
Weather conditions in the early spring
make an outdoor night production un
comfortable both for the performers
and the onlookers.
"If a dance drama were given next
year it would be put on on a Friday
night like any other campus dramatic
production. It could be made to pay,
and the profits either given over to
the W.A.A. or laid aside as a sinking
fund for future dance dramas."
