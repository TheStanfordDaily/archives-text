# BEAR TENNIS PLAYER DECLARED INELIGIBLE FOR STANFORD GAMES
## 
### 
Stanford's chance for a decisive
tennis victory over the University of
California next Saturday morning on
the campus courts has been consider
ably enhanced with the announcement
recently of the ineligibility of Brad
shaw Harrison, star Bear player.
Harrison has been attending the
dental school at Berkeley and last se
mester took tho regular dental course
of nine hours, which is insufficient to
qualify him for sport competition
under the University of California
rules. But as the course Harrison took
is the regular one in the dental school
and corresponds to the usual fifteen
hour college program, it is thought
(hat the eligibility board now con
sidering his case will qualify him to
play against Stanford Saturday.
Tom Stow, member of the inter
collegiate championship doubles com
bination of Chandler and Stow, now
ranks first at Berkeley, with John
Risso. famous one-handed player, sec
ond, and Richard Hoogs third. Stow
and Risso combine to form the first
doubles team and Hoogs and Dusty
Rhoades pair in the second.
