# "CASTLES IN THE AIR" TO RUN AT PALO ALTO
## 
### 
Something new in the way of enter
tainment will be offered at the New
Stanford Theatre tomorrow night
when Edward W. Smith's production
of "Castles in the Air" will be shown.
The book and lyrics by Raymond W.
Peck are romantic and fanciful, and
(he twenty-one musical numbers are
"hits," making the production a hilari
ous and tuneful comedy. Perry Askam,
tenor, who plays Prince Carol, and
Charles Miller, cast as the American
millionaire, divide the honors as the
male leads.
The action of the story is in Latavia.
