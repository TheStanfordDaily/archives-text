# CARD BASEBALL MEN MEET U.C. IN FIRST GAME
## Stanford Team in Excellent Mental State for Tilt With California STEVE COLLINS TO PITCH Both Squads Have Improved Work in Field During Past Two Weeks 
### Edwin Randol 
Coach Harry Wolter will lead his
Stanford varsity baseball team against
the University of California this after
noon at 3 o'clock on the Stanford dia
mond. The game will be thfe first of
the annual series played between the
two universities, and promises to be
one of the closest games in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Association this
year.
Although rain drove the Cardinals to
the showers after a short practice ses
sion yesterday afternoon, the confi
dence and speed of the entire squad
indicates an excellent state of mind
for the California contest. With this
element supplied, baseball critics feel
that the Cardinals have a good chance
of winning the opener, providing they
can bunch their hits and obtain an
early lead.
Collins Starts
Coach Wolter has definitely decided
to start Captain Steve Collins on the
mound against the Bears, with Cook
Sypher receiving. Nemechek is slated
to pitch for California, while Wyatt
will catch. Bob Philippi will act as re
lief man for the Cards, while Hill
serves in that capacity for the Bears.
Both pitchers will have plenty to
worry about, however, with California
presenting such hitters as Douthit,
Hill, Stevenson, and Clymer, and
Stanford offering Sypher, Nissen, Har
der, and Stewart. Field work should
be a feature of the day, as both squads
have improved greatly during the past
two weeks and errors have been
scarce.
Bears Leading
Today's game marks an unbroken
string of thirty-six years of diamond
competition. In this time, California
has taken 22 series to Stanford's 12,
the 1906 series, resulting in the only
tie. Since 1920, the Bears have won
five series, Stanford winning in 1924
and 1925.
The second game of the California
series will be played in Berkeley on
Thursday of this week, while the final
contest is scheduled for Saturday after
the Big Meet.
