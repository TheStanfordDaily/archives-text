# Washington Abolishes Tradition
## 
### 
On February 1, the Senior Council at the University of Washington
took the matter of enforcing college traditions into its own hands, and
organized the sophomore vigilance plan. The students were quite sure
that traditions should exist, and furthermore that they were personally
bound to uphold these important rulings. The Senior Council is a dis
tinctive group of young gentlemen with the weight of the world and the
future of the University of Washington resting on its shoulders.
The Council decided that it would be a crime for a freshman to
(1) talk with a woman,on the campus, (2) to walk on the grass, (3) to
.smoke on the campus, and (4) to stand on the front steps of a particular
Denny Hall. It was only after hours of deep deliberation that the Council
was able to segregate the worst evils that the freshman was apt to fall
into, and to prohibit the yearling from practicing them.
The Stanford Daily prophesied at the time the Washington body
enacted these rulings that "in a few years, depending upon how fast the
University of Washington advances, the Senior Council and the students
will see how useless and how ridiculous it is to force young men who
have almost reached their majority to obey silly little traditions. And the
Senior Council will see fit to abolish their four commandments."
Last week the traditions were abolished, and along with them went
the sophomore vigilance. But the disposal of all this nonsense was not
sponsored by the Senior Council or the students in general. The traditions
and sophomore discipline were abolished by an edict issued by the Wash
ington faculty. Following is the ruling through the interpretation of
which the faculty has banned all vigilance systems:
"Rule 50. Push-ball contest, tie-ups, and all other forms of class
conflicts are prohibited. Any form of hazing, or of interference by any
class or any member of any class with the personal dignity and liberty of
any member of any class, is a breach of discipline and is prohibited.
So the University of Washington has advanced with more rapidity
than even the strongest well-wishers of that institution could have hoped
for. But all this reform has originated from a queer source—the faculty.
Think of the credit that could have gone to the Senior Council if it had
taken the initiative itself to do away with freshman discipline. Instead
of favoring the faculty's ruling the Council is quite upset over the whole
affair. The members of the board have actually threatened to resign, but
it is doubtful if they will go as far as that. They have just heard how the
Senior Council at Princeton recently resigned because its decisions were
completely ignored by the faculty, and they thought it would be fine to
start such a movement on the Coast.
The University of Oregon is doing its best to abolish all worthless
traditions on the Eugene campus. The Oregon Emerald points out that
"a stock answer of the supporters of freshman rules has been : 'the fresh
man likes them.'" But the Oregon paper is not so sure the statement is
correct. John E. Winter of West Virginia University says in regard to
the subject: "It is impossible to compel one to be enthusiastic as it is to
compel him to hate or love. Coercion arouses resistance and the kindred
attitudes of aversion, disgust, resentment, and lays the foundation of
mal-direction or disintegration."
It would not pay for one to live in a glass house and still persist in
throwing stones. It was not many years ago that we had freshman tra
ditions at Stanford. The freshman was supposed to wear a ridiculous
looking head ■gear, he was expected to carry matches, he was supposed to
smoke none other than a corncob pipe, he was not supposed to walk with
a young lady on the Quad, and he was not allowed to do other immaterial
things. Today the freshman can do anything he pleases that any other
member of the student body is allowed to do. There is one exception to
this statement: there is still one bit of a rule that has persisted since the
"good old days." The freshman does not walk down the law steps, but
what would happen to him if he should, is hard to tell, for there is no
one whose duty it is to stand guard. There is no reason for this tradition
to hang on, for it is as worthless as the rest of them. In a few years it
will be dead along with the other rulings.
