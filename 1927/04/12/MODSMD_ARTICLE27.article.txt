Football's uplifting effect upon the younger generation is definitely
demonstrated by the action of Ernest Hudson, star tackle on the Southern
Methodist University football team, who has just organized a "Non-
Swearing Gub."
"Hoys of the university are signing up to join the club with the following
principles in mind (states an official bulletin):
"Inasmuch as it is ungentlemanly and injurious to one's mental status, in
addition to being wicked and injurious to one's vocabulary, we, the under
signed, will do our utmost to refrain from swearing in the future, and we
stand to be corrected by any of our fellows."
