WITHOUT BENEFiT OF BEDLAM
Last Saturday the track team gave
a little lesson to those people who
claim that an athlete exerts himself
only in response to the roar of the
grandstands.
In a driving rain and handicapped
by a low temperature, Alex McKinnon
ran the two best races of his career in
the mile and the half-mile, Bud Spen
cer cracked the coast record in the
quarter, and Phil Ranney fought every
stride of the last lap to take the two
mile by a matter of inches.
There were other good perform
ances, but these races were the kind
I hat make the heart beat faster. And
they were all run for the edification of
a mere handful of rain-soaked rooters
and the blas6 representatives of the
San E'rancisco press.

THOSE COMICAL FELLOWS
While it is a matter of policy with
the Daily to give the minimum of pub
licity to the occasional affairs in which
Stanford students become involved in
the meshes of the law, a recent inci
dent seems to deserve some comment
because it has all the earmarks of a

good, horrible example.
A few days ago, the judge of the
Palo Alto police court, himself a Stan-'
ford man, was forced to perform the j
unpleasant business of hurling a cou
ple of freshmen into the town brig. As I
an evidence of his sincere desire to :
allay a troublesome situation, lie wrote |
a letter to the Daily explaining his j
motives. This letter, published in yes- j
terday's paper, gave complete and con- i
vincing evidence of the desire of the j
J
Palo Alto police department to avoid j
trouble with Stanford men.
All that is really needed to abate
this nuisance is to create a new atti- j
tude of mind among the local colle- ;
gians. It is imperative to impress upon
the young and plastic minds the fact j
that this matter of carting off the
property of the honest residents of the
nearby town is not as comical as some
of the movie directors in Hollywood
would have one believe.
If the unpleasant experience of the
two freshmen who were apprehended
in the act of going south with a $CO
- serves to prevent recurrences
of similar thefts, they will have suf
fered for a good purpose.
