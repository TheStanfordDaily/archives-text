# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
I wonder what Cap Anson thinks, as
he looks down from his throne on base
ball's "Mt. Olympus," and sees the
National League begin its fifty-second,
and the American League its twenty
eighth season? For A. C, Anson was
not only one of the pioneers of the
game, but he was also one of its
super stars.
Even though Cobb and others may
take away the few remaining records
of this "Grand Old Man" that have not
already been equalled or surpassed,
no one can ever rob him of his good
name and his reputation for being a
true sportsman and a champion of
clean baseball under all circumstances.
Anson's word was as good as his
bond, and he was idolized by men and
boys all over the nation; unconsciously
he was preaching a great sermon, just
as the late Christy Mathewson was
while he lived.
But what does Pop think as he looks
down on Babe Ruth, who is getting
enough money in two years to have
bought the whole National League in
1576? Even $1,000 salaries were rare
when Anson first played ball. What
does he think as he sees Ty Cobb, the
only other player besides himself who
has hit for .300 or better for twenty
years or more? Cobb will have to go
several years rrrore to quit at 45, as

j Anson did. And I wonder what Old
I Cap thinks of the 50- and 70,000 crowds
i which are filling the huge stadiums in
i all the major league cities today?
Three thousand people made a good
| "house" when he was in his youth.
Adrian Constantin Anson, under
whose tread the baseball universe
rocked from IS7C until 1897, derived
his name from two Roman emperors
and proved himself a true monarch in
the game he did so much for. Besides
! batting over .300 in all but two of his
twenty-two seasons, Anson led the
| National League four different years,
1 and twice topped the .400 mark. He
| belongs to that select class of players
| who made over 3,000 hits, and as a
i manager won five pennants for the
i famous Chicago "White Stockings/' He
: died on April 14 five years ago. There
! will never be another Cap Anson.

Today s the Big Day
I wonder what Cap Anson thinks, as
he looks down from his throne on base
ball's "Mt. Olympus," and sees the
National League begin its fifty-second,
and the American League its twenty
eighth season? For A. C, Anson was
not only one of the pioneers of the
game, but he was also one of its
super stars.
Even though Cobb and others may
take away the few remaining records
of this "Grand Old Man" that have not
already been equalled or surpassed,
no one can ever rob him of his good
name and his reputation for being a
true sportsman and a champion of
clean baseball under all circumstances.
Anson's word was as good as his
bond, and he was idolized by men and
boys all over the nation; unconsciously
he was preaching a great sermon, just
as the late Christy Mathewson was
while he lived.
But what does Pop think as he looks
down on Babe Ruth, who is getting
enough money in two years to have
bought the whole National League in
1576? Even $1,000 salaries were rare
when Anson first played ball. What
does he think as he sees Ty Cobb, the
only other player besides himself who
has hit for .300 or better for twenty
years or more? Cobb will have to go
several years rrrore to quit at 45, as

j Anson did. And I wonder what Old
I Cap thinks of the 50- and 70,000 crowds
i which are filling the huge stadiums in
i all the major league cities today?
