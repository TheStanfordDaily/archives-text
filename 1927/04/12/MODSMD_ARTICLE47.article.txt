# HAMMER AND COFFIN FOUNDED APRIL 17,1906 HUMOR SOCIETY BIRTH ATTENDED BY QUAKE DISASTER OCCURS EARLY FOLLOWING MORNING
## 
### Jack Rogers 
Twenty-one years ago, late in the
night of the seventeenth of April, the
group of students who had been guid
ing the destinies of Chaparral gath
ered together and organized the moth
er chapter of Hammer and Cofiin. A
few hours later —early in the morning
of April 18, 1906 —dear old Mother Na
ture gave a flirtatious twitch of that
part of her anatomy on which the
Pacific Coast lies. Thus within a few
short hours two memorable events of
history were visited upon mankind —
the founding of Hammer and Coffin
and the start of the San Francisco fire.
The exact meeting place of the
group has not been left to posterity,
not because the participants were too
hazy afterward to remember it, but
because the following issue of Cha
parral was destroyed by the afore
mentioned-Mother Nature's fickleness.
However, lest they might be blamed
for the catastrophe of the earthquake,
the members of the new society
promptly disclaimed any responsibility
for the accident, and gave all credit
for it where credit was due.

Bristow Adams, 'Ofl, started the pub
lication of Chaparral, Stanford's hu
mor magazine. For several years the
publication passed from hand to
mouth, so to speak, until the staff
members of 1906 felt that the organi
zation should be more stable and per
manent, and hit on the idea of the
Hammer and Coffin society.
If the name, Hammer and Coffin,

has an esoteric or erudite significance
in its meaning, knowledge of the fact
is with members only. It is not only
an honor society, the members of
which are taken from the business,
literary, and art contributors to Chap
arral, from sophomores on up, but it
is also a professional and social or
ganization. Women who have distin
guished themselves for good work on
the publication are made honorary
members of Hammer and Coffin.
The society has four principles. It
stands for clean humor, co-operation
with the administration of the Uni
versity, freedom from student politics,
and co-operation with the Hammer and
Coffin chapters of other universities to
form one general unit.

Until 1919, the Stanford chapter of
the society was the only one in exis
tence. Then it was made a national
organization when eleven members
from Stanford went to the University
of Washington and formed a chapter
up there iu conjunction with The Sun
Dodger—now Ttoe Columns.
Since then five other chapters have
been organized. They are at Oregon
Agricultural College, "The Orange
Owl"; University of Oregon, "The
Lemon Punch"; University of Cali
fornia, "Pelican"; University of Chi
cago. "The Phoenix"; and Northwest
ern University, "The Purple Parrot."
The society is steadily growing, and
during the present year inquiries con
cerning it have arrived from many
eastern colleges and universities.

eastern colleges and universities.
Twenty-one years ago, late in the
night of the seventeenth of April, the
group of students who had been guid
ing the destinies of Chaparral gath
ered together and organized the moth
er chapter of Hammer and Cofiin. A
few hours later —early in the morning
of April 18, 1906 —dear old Mother Na
ture gave a flirtatious twitch of that
part of her anatomy on which the
Pacific Coast lies. Thus within a few
short hours two memorable events of
history were visited upon mankind —
the founding of Hammer and Coffin
and the start of the San Francisco fire.
The exact meeting place of the
group has not been left to posterity,
not because the participants were too
hazy afterward to remember it, but
because the following issue of Cha
parral was destroyed by the afore
mentioned-Mother Nature's fickleness.
However, lest they might be blamed
for the catastrophe of the earthquake,
the members of the new society
promptly disclaimed any responsibility
for the accident, and gave all credit
for it where credit was due.

Bristow Adams, 'Ofl, started the pub
lication of Chaparral, Stanford's hu
mor magazine. For several years the
publication passed from hand to
mouth, so to speak, until the staff
members of 1906 felt that the organi
zation should be more stable and per
manent, and hit on the idea of the
Hammer and Coffin society.
If the name, Hammer and Coffin,

has an esoteric or erudite significance
in its meaning, knowledge of the fact
is with members only. It is not only
an honor society, the members of
which are taken from the business,
literary, and art contributors to Chap
arral, from sophomores on up, but it
is also a professional and social or
ganization. Women who have distin
guished themselves for good work on
the publication are made honorary
members of Hammer and Coffin.
The society has four principles. It
stands for clean humor, co-operation
with the administration of the Uni
versity, freedom from student politics,
and co-operation with the Hammer and
Coffin chapters of other universities to
form one general unit.

Until 1919, the Stanford chapter of
the society was the only one in exis
tence. Then it was made a national
organization when eleven members
from Stanford went to the University
of Washington and formed a chapter
up there iu conjunction with The Sun
Dodger—now Ttoe Columns.
Since then five other chapters have
been organized. They are at Oregon
Agricultural College, "The Orange
Owl"; University of Oregon, "The
Lemon Punch"; University of Cali
fornia, "Pelican"; University of Chi
cago. "The Phoenix"; and Northwest
ern University, "The Purple Parrot."
The society is steadily growing, and
during the present year inquiries con
cerning it have arrived from many
eastern colleges and universities.
