# WOMEN WILL ELECT OFFICERS TOMORROW FOR A.W.S.. W.A.A.
## Vote on Davidson, Huneke For Holdover Members Of Women's Council 
### 
Election of women's officers for the
coming year in both A.W.S. and W.A.A.
will be held tomorrow on Quad from
9 to 12 and from 1 to 2 o'clock.
Through an error in the ballot sheet,
two names were erroneously included
in yesterday's list of candidates for
junior members of Women's Council.
The corrected list includes Dorothy
Brown, Janet Harris, Jane McCabe,
Margaret Owen, and Eleanor Patten.
Of the candidates for senior mem
bers of Council, three are to be voted
for. Since on6 of the members must
have already been a member of Coun
cil, one vote of the three must be cast
for either Eleanor Davidson or Helen
Huneke, who were junior members
this year.
The candidate for senior council
member who receives the highest num
ber of votes in the election tomorrow
will automatically become next year's
A.W.S. president. She who receives
the next highest number of votes will
I be vice-president.
