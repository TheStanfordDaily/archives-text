catches in the first and second in-j
nings. In the first, he speared Hill's j
liner over shortstop for the third Cali- j
fornia out. Collins walked Douthit to I
start the second, but Busch nipped a ,
rally when he made a shoe-string j
catch of Stevenson's drive, and dou-1
bled Douthit off firfit. After this point
Collins turned the Bears back in one
two-three order until the sixth inning.

and both Cusch and Watson showed
up well at that position. Busch ban- 1
