game postponed
Junipero Serra and the Indians
staged what promised to be the best
game of the day yesterday, keeping
within one run of each other for five
innings, but the Indians went off on a
riot in the sixth and broke up a good
ball game.
Harold, Junipero pitcher, and Wil
helme, of the Indians, kept control of
the game for several innings. The In
dians scored two runs in the first
inning, but the Junipero outfit came
back in the second when Purcel
cracked out a hit with the bases full.
When the dust cleared away three
runs had crossed the plate. The third
inning was scoreless, and the Indians
tied the score 3-3 in the fourth.
Indians Score
One more tally for the Indiana came
in the fifth, when Thompson doubled
to deep left to score Adams. The sixth
inning, however, was the big time for
the independent nine, for they banged
Harold all over the lot. Tully went to
bat with three on, and cracked out a
single. Adams doubled, and Wilhelmy
singled. The next man fanned, but
Thompson doubled to right and Reese
singled to center, but was out steal
ing second.
Harold held the Indians scoreless in
the seventh, and when Junlpero came
to bat they started a last inning rally.
Bases were filled up and Zipfol scored
all three with a long double. Two more
runs came in, but the Indiana stopped
the parade in time to win 11 to 8.
Phi Psi Wins
Phi Psi nearly blanked Branner, but
slipped up in the last frame to allow
the hallmen to sneak in a run. The
game ended 10 to 1. Kern of Phi Psi
hurled fine ball to the Branner bats
men, making a record of thirteen
strikeouts in six innings. On the other
side, Branner used three men, Carter,
O. Fry, and Hanak, but with little suc
cess.
The Phi Psis had their big innings
In the first and sixth, when they scored
three runs in each. They were held to
one run in every other inning. Two
doubles raid four stolen bas'js were re
sponsible for the scoring in the first,
while two triples accounted for the
runs in the sixth. The Phi Psis pro
duced a snappy infield and an excep
tionally good outfield.
Encina I Weak
Churchill, Encina I hurler, was hit
mercilessly by the El Tigre nine, who
won the third game of the day 14 to 1.
The Encina support was greatly re
sponsible for the batting orgy, missing
easy hits and throwing wide to the
bases.
The El Tigre pitcher, Noack, held
Encina down to one run, which they
took in the second, while his team
mates circled around the bases. The
club men had two big innings in the
third and sixth, when they piled tip a
total of eleven runs. A few husky hits
from El Tigre and a great many errors
on the part of the Encina players ac
counted for the lopsided score
