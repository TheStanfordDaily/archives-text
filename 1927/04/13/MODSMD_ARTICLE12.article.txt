game postponed
Junipero Serra and the Indians
staged what promised to be the best
game of the day yesterday, keeping
within one run of each other for five
innings, but the Indians went off on a
riot in the sixth and broke up a good
ball game.
Harold, Junipero pitcher, and Wil
helme, of the Indians, kept control of
the game for several innings. The In
dians scored two runs in the first
inning, but the Junipero outfit came
back in the second when Purcel
cracked out a hit with the bases full.
When the dust cleared away three
runs had crossed the plate. The third
inning was scoreless, and the Indians
tied the score 3-3 in the fourth.
Indians Score
One more tally for the Indiana came
in the fifth, when Thompson doubled
to deep left to score Adams. The sixth
inning, however, was the big time for
the independent nine, for they banged
Harold all over the lot. Tully went to
bat with three on, and cracked out a
single. Adams doubled, and Wilhelmy
singled. The next man fanned, but
Thompson doubled to right and Reese
singled to center, but was out steal
ing second.
Harold held the Indians scoreless in
