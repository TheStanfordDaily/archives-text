# ENCINA GIVES REPORT ON DEFICIT OF DANCE
## 
### 
Showing a deficit of $88<.59, the re
port of the dance committee for the
Encina Club formal on March 4 has
just been submitted to the Student
Manager.
Bob Lewis declares that this breaks
all records for dance deficits. The total
expenso was $1497.59, and the total
money realized from the sale of tickets
amounted to only $610. As a result,
the club expects to be forced to utilize
the breakage fund to clear up the defi
cit instead of using that money for a
scholarship, as had been previously
planned. Â»
