# Stanford Once Barred Cars Measure Was Disciplinary Founders' Team Frightened

### 
Automobiles were at one time barred
from the Stanford campus or approxi
mately five years, from 1900 to 1905,
although for the sake of safety rather
than for disciplinary purposes, as has
been the ease at Princeton and other
eastern universities within the last few
months.
There was but one automobile on the
campus before the regulation was made,
but that one car had the misfortune upon
a certain occasion to so frighten Mrs.
Stanford's team of spirited carriage
"horses as her coachman approached the
head of Palm Drive that there was a
near-runaway.
To prevent the recurrence of a similar
emergency, all motor vehicles were
banned from the roads of the campus,
a rule which remained in force until
"horseless carriages" became so nume
rous that the rule grew to be a nuisance.
A year later, in 1906, the automobile
justified its readmission to the campus
with the signal services performed in
Telief work after the earthquake.
