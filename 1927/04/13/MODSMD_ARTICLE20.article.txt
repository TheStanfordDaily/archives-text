# POSTPONEMENT OF RALLY CAUSED BY CONFLICTING DATES
## SCHEDULED APRIL 21 Committee Fears Changes In Plans Would Cut Down Attendance 
### 
Postponement of the Annual Spring
Rally to 7:30 o'clock Thursday night,
April 21, in the Lagunita bandstand
was made by the Rally Committee
yesterday afternoon. The change was
deemed advisable because the many
last-minute changes had confused stu
dents and because of the many con
flicts with other activities this week.
The feature crew race that was to be
part of the rally has also been post
poned.
The time of the rally was switched
from 7:30 to 7 o'clock last week due
to a conflict with the Joffre Debate
which had been scheduled for some
time. This time interfered wuh men's
rushing. It was also found that the
baseball team would not be there be
cause of the game with California.
Yesterday a change was made to
Wednesday night but it was found that
the speakers that had been secured
could not be there.
The Rally Committee is now making
plans to make this the most successful
spring quarter rally ever held. An out
side speaker is being secured and the
track, baseball, and tennis men, their
captains and coaches, will be on the
bandstand. Brooks-Worthington's orch
estra has been engaged to furnish en
tertainment. A system is being in
stalled to furnish light for the rally.
