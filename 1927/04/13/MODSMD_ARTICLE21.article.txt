# FOOTBALL MEN GIVEN SCRIMMAGES DAILY IN SPRING TRAINING
## 
### 
Pop Warner is giving his football
varsity scrimmages in the daily prac
tices, despite the incessant rain. About
sixty of the spring football aspirants
turned out in uniforms yesterday after
noon to go through their paces. Nearly
all varsity candidates not participating
in other sports are regularly showing
up for practice.
The scrimmages are hardening the
men rapidly, and spirited competition
is going on for places in the first-string
lineup. Spud Lewis has been exhibit
ing form in the quarterback berth as
a ball carrier. Moomaw has been
shifted from tackle to end and David
son from end to center, a fact which
gives evidence of Warner's worries
over the filling of the wing positions.
Vincenti is playing one end, but the
other has not been definitely selected.
