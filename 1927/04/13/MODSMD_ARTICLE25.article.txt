# BABES DEFEAT CUB TRACKMEN IN CLOSE MEET
## Cards Snatch Victory From Opponents in Final Event of Contest RELAY RECORD FALLS Stanford Team Establishes Three More New Marks; Ties Another 
### Doug Fuller 
Smashing the freshman relay rec
ord to snatch a last-minute 68 1-3 to
62 2-3 victory, Stanford's 1930 track
squad took the annual "Little Big
Meet" from California for the fourth
consecutive year on the Berkeley ov«I
yesterday afternoon.
Upsets of dope throughout the meet
held the Cardinal total down, and the
Stanford margin was but two-thirds
of a point when the relay was called,
an event in which California had been
conceded a win. With the meet in the
balance each Cardinal runner ran a
strong race to gain on his Blue and
Gold opponent, Morrison breaking tho
tape thirty yards in the lead in 3:31
4-5, which time bested the old record
of 3:32 held by California.
Three new records besides the relay
were established, all by Stanford men,
and in addition Kingsbury stepped a
pretty 10 flat century to tie the record
of Barber of California and Eddie
Sudden of Stanford.
Krenz Outstanding
Outstanding among all performers,
however, was Eric Krenz, the Stock
ton giant, who tossed the shot and
discus far into the future to break two
of the battered Stanford-California
freshman records and gain a double
victory.
Krenz's mark of 46 feet &Yz inches
shattered that made last year by Herb
Fleishhacker of Stanford at 44 feet
9% inches, and his last heave in the
discus, though below his best of the
season, bettered Ray Tandy's record
of 132 feet 6 inches set last year by
fully 11 feet.
The fourth record to fall succumbed
to the efforts of Morrison in the quar
ter-mile. In this, one of the closest
events of the meet, the Cardinal Btar
won from Rust In E0 3 5, clipping one
, | fifth of a second from the record of
Goeppcrt of California established in
1917.
A bright light in the contest was the
height of G f'iet 11 inches achieved by
French of Stanford in the high jump,
i It was his best of the Reason.
Cards Lose Distances
The Cardinals fr-ll before superior
class in the distances. Osborn's great
sprint in the SBo' and Henderson's
; steady race in the two-mile were too
much for tie Red shirt entrants.
In (hr- sprints, Stanford cleaned up,
allowing but a pair of third places for
the Cubs. Kingsbury ran in perfect
form and kept well in the lead.
Rothert came through with his ex
pected first in the javelin and second
in the Rhot, but was Bhut out by a
small margin in the discus. In the
broad jump, where Dowoll was doped
] to win, Pias of the Cubs came through
! in a surpriso victory.
The hurdles were all California,
"Togo" Thornton distinguishing him
self by outdistancing the favorite,
Werdell. The 220's looked like a shut
out, but Werdell lost his stride and
was passed near the tape by Helmke
of Stanford.

Smashing the freshman relay rec
ord to snatch a last-minute 68 1-3 to
62 2-3 victory, Stanford's 1930 track
squad took the annual "Little Big
Meet" from California for the fourth
consecutive year on the Berkeley ov«I
yesterday afternoon.
Upsets of dope throughout the meet
held the Cardinal total down, and the
Stanford margin was but two-thirds
of a point when the relay was called,
an event in which California had been
conceded a win. With the meet in the
balance each Cardinal runner ran a
strong race to gain on his Blue and
Gold opponent, Morrison breaking tho
tape thirty yards in the lead in 3:31
4-5, which time bested the old record
of 3:32 held by California.
Three new records besides the relay
were established, all by Stanford men,
and in addition Kingsbury stepped a
pretty 10 flat century to tie the record
of Barber of California and Eddie
Sudden of Stanford.
Krenz Outstanding
Outstanding among all performers,
however, was Eric Krenz, the Stock
ton giant, who tossed the shot and
discus far into the future to break two
of the battered Stanford-California
freshman records and gain a double
victory.
Krenz's mark of 46 feet &Yz inches
shattered that made last year by Herb
Fleishhacker of Stanford at 44 feet
9% inches, and his last heave in the
discus, though below his best of the
season, bettered Ray Tandy's record
of 132 feet 6 inches set last year by
fully 11 feet.
The fourth record to fall succumbed
to the efforts of Morrison in the quar
ter-mile. In this, one of the closest
events of the meet, the Cardinal Btar
won from Rust In E0 3 5, clipping one
, | fifth of a second from the record of
Goeppcrt of California established in
1917.
A bright light in the contest was the
height of G f'iet 11 inches achieved by
French of Stanford in the high jump,
i It was his best of the Reason.
Cards Lose Distances
The Cardinals fr-ll before superior
class in the distances. Osborn's great
sprint in the SBo' and Henderson's
; steady race in the two-mile were too
much for tie Red shirt entrants.
In (hr- sprints, Stanford cleaned up,
allowing but a pair of third places for
the Cubs. Kingsbury ran in perfect
form and kept well in the lead.
Rothert came through with his ex
pected first in the javelin and second
in the Rhot, but was Bhut out by a
small margin in the discus. In the
broad jump, where Dowoll was doped
] to win, Pias of the Cubs came through
! in a surpriso victory.
The hurdles were all California,
"Togo" Thornton distinguishing him
self by outdistancing the favorite,
Werdell. The 220's looked like a shut
out, but Werdell lost his stride and
was passed near the tape by Helmke
of Stanford.

Smashing the freshman relay rec
ord to snatch a last-minute 68 1-3 to
62 2-3 victory, Stanford's 1930 track
squad took the annual "Little Big
Meet" from California for the fourth
consecutive year on the Berkeley ov«I
yesterday afternoon.
Upsets of dope throughout the meet
held the Cardinal total down, and the
Stanford margin was but two-thirds
of a point when the relay was called,
an event in which California had been
conceded a win. With the meet in the
balance each Cardinal runner ran a
strong race to gain on his Blue and
Gold opponent, Morrison breaking tho
tape thirty yards in the lead in 3:31
4-5, which time bested the old record
of 3:32 held by California.
Three new records besides the relay
were established, all by Stanford men,
and in addition Kingsbury stepped a
pretty 10 flat century to tie the record
of Barber of California and Eddie
Sudden of Stanford.
Krenz Outstanding
Outstanding among all performers,
however, was Eric Krenz, the Stock
ton giant, who tossed the shot and
discus far into the future to break two
of the battered Stanford-California
freshman records and gain a double
victory.
Krenz's mark of 46 feet &Yz inches
shattered that made last year by Herb
Fleishhacker of Stanford at 44 feet
9% inches, and his last heave in the
discus, though below his best of the
season, bettered Ray Tandy's record
of 132 feet 6 inches set last year by
fully 11 feet.
The fourth record to fall succumbed
to the efforts of Morrison in the quar
ter-mile. In this, one of the closest
events of the meet, the Cardinal Btar
won from Rust In E0 3 5, clipping one
, | fifth of a second from the record of
Goeppcrt of California established in
1917.
A bright light in the contest was the
height of G f'iet 11 inches achieved by
French of Stanford in the high jump,
i It was his best of the Reason.
Cards Lose Distances
The Cardinals fr-ll before superior
class in the distances. Osborn's great
sprint in the SBo' and Henderson's
; steady race in the two-mile were too
much for tie Red shirt entrants.
In (hr- sprints, Stanford cleaned up,
allowing but a pair of third places for
the Cubs. Kingsbury ran in perfect
form and kept well in the lead.
Rothert came through with his ex
pected first in the javelin and second
in the Rhot, but was Bhut out by a
small margin in the discus. In the
broad jump, where Dowoll was doped
] to win, Pias of the Cubs came through
! in a surpriso victory.
The hurdles were all California,
"Togo" Thornton distinguishing him
self by outdistancing the favorite,
Werdell. The 220's looked like a shut
out, but Werdell lost his stride and
was passed near the tape by Helmke
of Stanford.
