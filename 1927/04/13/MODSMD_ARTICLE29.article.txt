The Stanford estate consists of more than 8000 acres of the finest
natural golf land in the country, and yet the intramural tournament is
held on the Emerald Lake Country Club course because there are no
links on the Stanford Campus. Golf enthusiasts are forced to travel some
six or seven miles in order to shoot a game.
It is estimated that a few over 200 play football on the campus in the
fall, and there are seven fields on which to accommodate the grid men.
About an equal number turn out for track, and there are 1080 yards of
cinder path for the trackmen to run on.and that is approximately five
yards per man. And so it is with practically every sport with the one
exception of golf. While a few hundred play basketball, and a few
hundred more play baseball, and a few hundred more run on the track,
everyone plays at-golf. Men, women, students, football men, track stars,
professors, and coaches (see Dink Templeton or Pop W arner for refer
ences)are all golf "nuts." It is the universal sport.
Football season is three months long, track season four months, base
ball five months. Golf season, on the other hand, is of twelve months
duration. A golf player can be seen with his putter, his driver, his
niblick, and his what-nots on every day of the year, except when there
is a little "unusual'' California weather.
There is the place, the desire, and the ambition to lay out a golf links
on the Stanford Campus, so the only other prerequisite is the money.
But with the cash that was taken in from football last season a course
could be built in everyone's back yard. Some of the money made on
athletic contests, at least, should be put back into athletics.
