# Skoal to the Committee!

### 
Four members,of tlie student body and the .M.C.A. on the Campus
deserve every kind word for the effort they are making on the Campus
this week. They compose a committee asking money from the students
for the Y.M.C.A. At the request of their chairman the Daily withholds
the names of the four, who will doubtless he aided by other members of
the local Christian Association.
These men exhibit the courage of their convictions in a way that can
only be admired. They really believe that the \ .M.C.A. should secure
at least one-fourteenth of its revenue from the students it serves and are
giving their time and effort for the cause. They realize that the organiza
tion is heavily in debt and every dollar is needed.
With organizations of students, for students, run by students, the
Daily is in heartiest sympathy. Only members and known friends of
the "Y" are being asked to contribute on the Campus this year, and this
fact will do much toward restoring the Christian Association to the
esteem in which it should stand.
Hail the day when the Campus "V" is an organization which will
command and have the respect and toleration of all right-minded students,
and the unapologetic and enthusiastic support of those more particularly
interested in its work. Meanwhile, a toast to the gallant four!
