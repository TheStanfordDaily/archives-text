# What About a Fiesta?
## 
### 
If you took part in lasF year's Fiesta either on the stage or in the
audience, you have formed an opinion of Fiestas. Are you content
merely to express your opinions vehemently in bull sessions? Your
chance comes now to take an open stand for or against Fiestas, for there
will be a straw vote on the question of a Fiesta or a Dance Drama taken
in the W.A.A. and AAV.S. election on Quad today.
The Daily feels that the Fiesta should be abolished. Tn the first
place, facilities for such a production arc lacking", seating arrangements
are unsatisfactory, and stage effects, especially lighting, are difficult to
obtain. Moreover, expenses for the Fiesta are enormous, expenditures
for that of last year amounting to approximately $2500, an amount much
too high for the pleasures derived.
Weather conditions of the spring make it uncomfortable for the per
formers and the audience. From the health standpoint the Fiesta i ; s
harmful, for on the night of the production a surprising number of colds
are caught, and the impairment of health caused the performers in their
many days and nights of intense rehearsals is sufficient reason to bar
the Fiesta.
In considering the Dance Drama as a substitute for the Fiesta it is
well to point out that the Dance Drama can be put on with less expense
and that Ix-tter facilities are available for its production. Moreover, seat
ing arrangements are more satisfactory, which is a vital factor in any
entertainment, for without comfortable seats, the beauty of any per
formance is practically lost.
