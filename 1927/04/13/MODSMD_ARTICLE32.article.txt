ON THE HIGHWAY
To those who have noticed the sud-!
den epidemic of chicken shacks pur- 1
porting indirectly to be run by some I
old-fashioned, matronly negress, it will
be interesting to note that your ob- j
servant correspondent recently dei
teeted a lady who he had reason to |
believe was the proprietress of such
an establishment. She wore, not the j
traditional gingham dress and ban !
dana. but a striking fur coat and a ,
small, modish hat. She might have!
been "Mammy" to someone, but to us j
she was Mrs. Epstein.
] Such is disillusionment in these dull j
days.

GOOD HUNTING
In a sudden burst of zeal, a motion
picture concern of national reputation !
has started an intensive search for
what we may term cinema talent in
American universities. Armed with a!
battery of cameras, a staff of direc-j
tors will superintend the process of j
photographing some three hundred i
aspiring collegians. And do you ask |

what is the reason for all of this?
The underlying motive, friends, is
the same as that which inspires the
vaudeville manager to sign a contract
with a notorious bandit, or a movie
producer to employ the services of a
well-known divorcee. The gentlemen
from Hollywood, always there with
the keen eye to get something for
nothing, are about to crash in on some
of the free advertising that the press
has so magnaniimously given to cer
tain aspects of college life. One may
soon expect to read "Harold Heming
way, the winner of the national motion
picture contest's prize contract, is not
only the proud possessor of beaucoup
sex-appeal, but is also a member of
one of Yale's oldest fraternities and
was the last man tapped for Bones."
And if one doubts it, he may read
the testimonials that Harold —abetted
by his press agent —writes for the
Sunday papers telling just how it feels
"to be a member of one of Yale's old
est fraternities and the last man
tapped for Bones."
