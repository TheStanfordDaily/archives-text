The Editor. Sir:
According: to the last few issues of
the "Daily," a Stanford alnmnus is
hard at work in an effort to revive
crew as a sport at Stanford. All power
to him, and here's hoping he succeeds!
And why not? We are no farther away
from available water than we were ten
or twelve years ago when crew was a
popular sport on Stanford's athletic
program. What's a few miles more or
less in this day and age of automobiles
in which it is so easy for one t0 4be
arrested for speeding? As for being
at>le to find enough men interested
enough to follow the sport and carry
it through to success and victory, I
have no doubt. I for one have always
hoped to be one of the "nine men in
a boat" in a full-fledged boat race. I
never advanced further than pulling
stroke oar in a high-school whale boat,
but the spirit was high even if the
execution was plebeian. I am sure there
are many other Stanford men who
would be as eager to support crew as
I would be if once given the oppor

| tunity. There are at least a few of us
! who realize that there are other kinds
i of shells besides those prefixed by sea,
1 egg, or cartridge, and that a bow isn't
part of a tree or some kind of a neck
tie, especially when it refers to a boat.
The financial barrier to the return
i of crew to Stanford lies principally in
the initial outlay, for the yearly ex
penditure for upkeep is nominal. Rac
ing shells are an expensive means of
i transportation for only nine men, but
the expense is forgotten in the thrills
of the sport, the pageant of the re
i gatta, the joy of victory, the satisfac
, tion that defeat was hard-fought. If
Stanford people will only join in and
i put their shoulder to the wheel Stan
ford might easily have its crew.
Our rivals across the bay have
proven that Californians can row a
boat as fast as anyone else. Here's
j hoping that Stanford may prove that
farmers can row a boat as well as win
a football game, and that there are
other oarsmen in the state besides
those who answer Ky Ebright's roll
l call. —Creagli, '27.

The Editor. Sir:
According: to the last few issues of
the "Daily," a Stanford alnmnus is
hard at work in an effort to revive
crew as a sport at Stanford. All power
to him, and here's hoping he succeeds!
And why not? We are no farther away
from available water than we were ten
or twelve years ago when crew was a
popular sport on Stanford's athletic
program. What's a few miles more or
less in this day and age of automobiles
in which it is so easy for one t0 4be
arrested for speeding? As for being
at>le to find enough men interested
enough to follow the sport and carry
it through to success and victory, I
have no doubt. I for one have always
hoped to be one of the "nine men in
a boat" in a full-fledged boat race. I
never advanced further than pulling
stroke oar in a high-school whale boat,
but the spirit was high even if the
execution was plebeian. I am sure there
are many other Stanford men who
would be as eager to support crew as
I would be if once given the oppor

| tunity. There are at least a few of us
! who realize that there are other kinds
i of shells besides those prefixed by sea,
1 egg, or cartridge, and that a bow isn't
part of a tree or some kind of a neck
tie, especially when it refers to a boat.
The financial barrier to the return
i of crew to Stanford lies principally in
the initial outlay, for the yearly ex
penditure for upkeep is nominal. Rac
ing shells are an expensive means of
i transportation for only nine men, but
the expense is forgotten in the thrills
of the sport, the pageant of the re
i gatta, the joy of victory, the satisfac
, tion that defeat was hard-fought. If
Stanford people will only join in and
i put their shoulder to the wheel Stan
ford might easily have its crew.
