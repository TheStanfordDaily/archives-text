ENGLAND, by William Ralph Inge;
(The Modern World Series). Scrib
ners.
Anxious or expectant souls have!
been discovering, these many years,;
cracks in the British Empire. They
shake their heads dismally at the
noble ruin. For some reason it doesn't 1
fall. Some day presumably the pro
phets will be justified, or perhaps the |
term "empire" will change its deflni-J
tion. Who knows? As for Dean Inge,
his gloom is not so black as it is
painted. To a certain degree he is an
optimist. After he has said all that is |
on his mind he bursts out with the
consoling assurance to his fellow coun- J
trymen that never (what never?) !
"have I been tempted to wish that 1
was other than an Englishman."
The applause subsiding, let it be;
said that the so-called pessimism of;
the so-called gloomy Dean is merely [
his English. It is the excess modesty
with which the Englishman is wont to
exalt himself by superlative depreca
tion. Dean Inge is proud of his coun
try. proud of the Empire, believes in
its future, and has a notion that great ;
events are yet reserved for it. Most
injpressivelv he believes in its human
integrity, its deserts, so to speak. This
all gleams on every page, for every
line of reproach is flanked and cush
ioned by several pages of congratula
tion.
;Hncial descent, language, religion,
social habits —all of these things and
many others he revinws, chiefly by
quotations from other writers, adding
his own little sernionette hero and
there, "viewing with alarm" so gontly

ments before he was "pointing with
pride."
Canada he treats with a fine imagi
native touch. He sees a growing politi
cal power of the Roman Catholic
church in the United States which is
an invitation to the French Catholics
of Canada. The chief safeguard of
Canada, he thinks, is really that it is
not the interest of the United States
to conquer it. He makes it clear that
if Canada ever is absorbed digestively
by the United States, he expects all
the nations of Europe, "enraged by
the bloated prosperity and airs of
superiority of the men who 'won the
war' to combine to draw Shylock's
death."

This isn't friendly. First the good
Dean invites us to sit in while he tells
the English some things that they
need to know and then, after giving
his countrymen as high a character
as they ever have received, he starts
to haw! us out.
As for England and the Empire,
which by the way is younger than the
United States, "plain living and high
thinking will be our salvation" —which
would make good hearing to the starv
ing miners, no doubt. He contemplates,
at some length, "the alleged deteriora-;
tion in the physical and intellectual
qualities of the nation as the results 1
of a dysgenic distribution of births."!
But because he finds that poverty and 1
fecundity apparently go together, he
thinks the solution lies in the law of
events by which the most gifted stocks
pre becoming poor and wealth is being
heaped on the heads of trade union
leaders and political agitators "who
are usually very undesirable citizens."
No, not a profound book, but an en
tertaining one, and, with a few excep- j
tions, every line will make an English
man feel that Inge is quite right. He
speaks so well of them. —E.L.S.

noble ruin. For some reason it doesn't 1
fall. Some day presumably the pro
phets will be justified, or perhaps the |
term "empire" will change its deflni-J
tion. Who knows? As for Dean Inge,
his gloom is not so black as it is
painted. To a certain degree he is an
optimist. After he has said all that is |
on his mind he bursts out with the
consoling assurance to his fellow coun- J
trymen that never (what never?) !
"have I been tempted to wish that 1
was other than an Englishman."
The applause subsiding, let it be;
said that the so-called pessimism of;
the so-called gloomy Dean is merely [
his English. It is the excess modesty
with which the Englishman is wont to
exalt himself by superlative depreca
tion. Dean Inge is proud of his coun
try. proud of the Empire, believes in
its future, and has a notion that great ;
events are yet reserved for it. Most
injpressivelv he believes in its human
integrity, its deserts, so to speak. This
all gleams on every page, for every
line of reproach is flanked and cush
ioned by several pages of congratula
tion.
;Hncial descent, language, religion,
social habits —all of these things and
many others he revinws, chiefly by
quotations from other writers, adding
his own little sernionette hero and
there, "viewing with alarm" so gontly

ments before he was "pointing with
pride."
Canada he treats with a fine imagi
native touch. He sees a growing politi
cal power of the Roman Catholic
church in the United States which is
an invitation to the French Catholics
of Canada. The chief safeguard of
Canada, he thinks, is really that it is
not the interest of the United States
to conquer it. He makes it clear that
if Canada ever is absorbed digestively
by the United States, he expects all
the nations of Europe, "enraged by
the bloated prosperity and airs of
superiority of the men who 'won the
war' to combine to draw Shylock's
death."

This isn't friendly. First the good
Dean invites us to sit in while he tells
the English some things that they
need to know and then, after giving
his countrymen as high a character
as they ever have received, he starts
to haw! us out.
As for England and the Empire,
which by the way is younger than the
United States, "plain living and high
thinking will be our salvation" —which
would make good hearing to the starv
ing miners, no doubt. He contemplates,
at some length, "the alleged deteriora-;
tion in the physical and intellectual
qualities of the nation as the results 1
of a dysgenic distribution of births."!
But because he finds that poverty and 1
fecundity apparently go together, he
thinks the solution lies in the law of
events by which the most gifted stocks
pre becoming poor and wealth is being
heaped on the heads of trade union
leaders and political agitators "who
are usually very undesirable citizens."
No, not a profound book, but an en
tertaining one, and, with a few excep- j
tions, every line will make an English
man feel that Inge is quite right. He
speaks so well of them. —E.L.S.
