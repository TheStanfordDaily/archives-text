# HAYES PLEASES CAPACITY AUDIENCE WITH CONCERT
## 
### Frank Mittauer 
A very la ire, hut. at first a some
what skeptical, audience greeted Rol
and Hayes, the negro tenor, at the
final concert of the 1927 season, which
was given last night in the University
Assembly Hall under the auspices of
the Peninsula Musical Association.
Some doubt seeijied to exist in the
minds of most of Hayes' hearers as to
whether the singer could overcome
the definite coolness which filled the
hall, but after his compelling rendition
of "When I Am Laid in Earth," the
first selection, the tension was broken
and the success of the conceit was
assured.
Stage Presence Excellent
Hayes' stage presence was excellent,
his demeanor being free from any af
fectation and modest in the extreme.
His enunciation was almost perfect, the
words of each selection being perfectly
distinguishable to everyone in the hall.
The tenor was at his best in his

execution of soft notes, to which he
gave a sweetness that was particularly
effective in the many numbers on the
program which had a lilting, crooning
quality. When sung at full volume,
Hayes' notes lost much of their purity;
at times the singer seemed to force
himself in delivering them.
Tones Differ
"Eviva Rosa," a song of the late
Italian renaissance, wjiich was given
partly in full tone, showed strikingly
the difference in the quality of the
artist's notes; in this selection, how
ever, the measures sung loudly served
as foils for the soft, lilting passages
in which the greater part of the selec
tion was given.
Two Schubert selections, "Nacht und
Traume" and "Der Jungling an der
Quelle" introduced the second group
with a thoughtful and quiet mood to
which Debussy's "Mandoline" formed
a nice contrast.
The work of Griffes, a contempo"avy
English composer, was represented on
the tenor's program by three numbers
in the third group, the fourth
the American, Roger Quitter's "I Will
Go with My Father a Ploughing."
Hayes sung this with rare understand
ing which eclipsed the most effective
.of the Griffes numbers, "The Lament
of lan the Proud."
It was in his interpretation of negro
spirituals, however, that the artis (
did his best work of the evening. Of
these, Hayes' own arrangement of
"The Great Camp Meetin'," a strongly
rhythmic expression of the primitive
faith of the negro, was mot appealing
although the final encore, the familiar
"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," was
given with all his vocal artistry in such
a way as to bring out every element of
beauty in the old spiritual.
Hayes was gracious with his en
cores, singing several request, num
bers, notably Massanet's "Dream
Song" from "Mignon" and the ever
popular "Songs My Mother Taught
Me," to each of which he brought new
beauties with his softness of rendition.
