# HAYES PLEASES CAPACITY AUDIENCE WITH CONCERT
## 
### Frank Mittauer 
A very la ire, hut. at first a some
what skeptical, audience greeted Rol
and Hayes, the negro tenor, at the
final concert of the 1927 season, which
was given last night in the University
Assembly Hall under the auspices of
the Peninsula Musical Association.
Some doubt seeijied to exist in the
minds of most of Hayes' hearers as to
whether the singer could overcome
the definite coolness which filled the
hall, but after his compelling rendition
of "When I Am Laid in Earth," the
first selection, the tension was broken
and the success of the conceit was
assured.
Stage Presence Excellent
Hayes' stage presence was excellent,
his demeanor being free from any af
fectation and modest in the extreme.
His enunciation was almost perfect, the
words of each selection being perfectly
distinguishable to everyone in the hall.
The tenor was at his best in his

execution of soft notes, to which he
gave a sweetness that was particularly
effective in the many numbers on the
program which had a lilting, crooning
quality. When sung at full volume,
Hayes' notes lost much of their purity;
at times the singer seemed to force
himself in delivering them.
Tones Differ
"Eviva Rosa," a song of the late
Italian renaissance, wjiich was given
partly in full tone, showed strikingly
the difference in the quality of the
artist's notes; in this selection, how
ever, the measures sung loudly served
as foils for the soft, lilting passages
in which the greater part of the selec
tion was given.
Two Schubert selections, "Nacht und
Traume" and "Der Jungling an der
Quelle" introduced the second group
with a thoughtful and quiet mood to
which Debussy's "Mandoline" formed
a nice contrast.
