# SECOND CONTEST OF 1930, BEAR BASEBALL PLAYERS SET TODAY
## Stanford Victory Predicted After Showing in First Game of Series 
### 
With one game tucked away to their
credit and odds in their favor to re
peat the performance of last week's
victory, the Stanford freshman base
ball players clash with their tradition
al rivals, the California Cubs, at 3
o'clock this afternoon on the varsity
diamond for the second contest of the
annual freshman series.
If Coach Husky Hunt's prodigies
can play the same brand of ball they
exhibited in the first game they should
come out winners again and thus tie
the results of the four major Stanford-
California freshman contests, having
won in track but lost in football and
basketball.

Play at Home
The fact that the freshmen are play
ing on their home field should add to
their chances to win and obliterate
the errors they made on the California
grounds. The babes are in the best of
condition with Simkins and Sparks,
the starting battery. Hadenfeldt, first
base; Story, second base; Capt. Laird,
third base; Bianchi, shortstop; Levi,
right field; Berg, center field; and
Murphy, left field, will complete the
lineup.
Coach Bert King of the California
yearlings will start Anderson in the
box and Hamberlin behind the bat.
Sellman, supposedly the Bears' best
pitcher, -will be kept on the bench for
reserve as he allowed too many Cardi
nal hits in the previous game. The
principal hitting strength of the Cali
fornia beginners is found in Rickson,
Valianos, and Sharp. These boys
should give the Stanford twirlers
plenty of trouble.

Laird, Berg Hit Well
Eoth Captain Laird and Berg are
strong hitters for Stanford. Laird
turned in a perfect score in Friday's
game, making five hits at five times
at bat. Story can also be depended on
to give a good account of himself in
knocking the ball.
If the freshmen win today there will
he no third game. If + hey lose, the
third game will be played at Berkeley
some time next week, the date to be
announced later.
