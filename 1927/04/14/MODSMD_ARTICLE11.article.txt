# Interfraternity Council Selects Adams As Head
## 
### 
Election of a new president and sec
retary and change of the final date of
rushing occurred at the meeting of the
Interfraternity Council yesterday after
noon at 3 o'clock. Wilbur Adams, for
mer secretary of the Council, was
unanimously elected president. Willis
Wolf was chosen secretary. The elec
tion was held due to the necessary
withdrawal of Karl Doerr from the
University on account of illness.
The final date of rushing was moved
back from 7 o'clock Friday evening.
May 6, to 8 o'clock Thursday evening,
May 5. Pledging will take place be
tween the hours of one and five Friday
afternoon, May 6, at the Old Union
where a lawyer selected by the Board
of Control will extend the bids. The
change in the date was made in order
not to conflict with the Junior Prom
which will be held Friday, May 6.
Orders for cards for the second period
of rushing are to be placed with the sec
retary at the next meeting of the Inter
fraternity Council Monday evening at
9 o'clock in the Old Union. The cards
will be ready Wednesday evening at 9
o'clock in the Old Union.
Bids will be delivered to a clerk ap
pointed by the Board of Control at the
Old Union between the hours of two
and four, Wednesday, May 4. The
Board of Control will meet Thursday
noon from 12 to 1 o'clock to consider
all violations of rushing rules. Those
violations that are considered serious
will prevent the violating freshman
from receiving his bid.
