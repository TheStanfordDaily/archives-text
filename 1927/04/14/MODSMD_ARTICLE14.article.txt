# CRANSTON HOLMAN IN FINE FORM FOR BEAR TENNIS COMPETITION
## 
### 
Stanford's hopes for a second con
secutive tennis victory over California
Saturday morning on the varsity courts
are especially high bj r reason of the re
turn to form of Cranston Holman,
Cardinal captain.
Two years ago Holman played in
wonderful style. He defeated Edward
G. Chandler, Bruin ace, in the annual
California-Stanford competition and
two months later reached the finals in
the national intercollegiate tournament.
His play throughout the entire summer
was so excellent that he was selected to
tryout for the American Davis Cup
team and at the end of the season was
rewarded for his skill by being ranked
eighth in America.
Holman Off Form.
Last year Holman could not play ten
nis shown the preceding season. He
lost to Chandler in the California
match and in the tournaments back
East was often eliminated by players
he had beaten on his first trip. To
ward the end of the summer he began
to win back some of his lost prestige,
but not soon enough to save his national
ranking, which slumped to seventeenth.
So far this year Holman has played
in his finest form. He won the Hunt
ington tournament without losing a set
despite an entry list of the best players
in both Northern and Southern Cali
fornia. A month before this he slipped
to Los Angeles over a week-end to trim
William T. Tilden in straight sets.
Saturday Holman will meet Tom
Stow, member of the Rear intercollegi
ate doubles championship team.
