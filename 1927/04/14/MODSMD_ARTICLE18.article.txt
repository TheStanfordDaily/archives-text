Intramural activity on the diamond!
yesterday was limited to only one I
game when three of the teams sched
uled to play failed to make their ap
pearance. Theta Chi, in nosing out
Kappa Alpha in a neck-and-neck strug
gle for sovfin innings, 9 to 8, packed
into the one game all the excitement
and interest that has marked a com
plete afternoon during the previous
contests of this season.
Pitchers Battle
As have most of the games played, 1
this one started off as a pitchers' bat
tle, with Bert Green, the Theta Chi
who brought his team from the box
to the finals last year, only to lose to
Junipero Serra nine, again pitching his
fast and steady game. As his opponent,
the Kappa Alphas used "Tiny" Sell
man, who had a good break on the
ball, and plenty of speed.
In the first inning, it was one, two,
three, via the strikeout route witli
Green in perfect form. It was the same
story with Theta Chi at bat, Sellman
having little difficulty disposing of the
top of the batting order.
Tight Ball Played
The pitchers eased up at intervals in
the next two innings, allowing a few
walks, and the game settled down to
tight baseball.
The strain broke in the fourth when,
with two outs and the Kappa Alphas
at bat, Green, having given Kirk Davis
a walk, was touched for a sizzling two
bagger by Sellman bringing in Davis.
Wright walked, and while Davidson
took first on an error, Sellman scored.
Hartwell ended the inning by striking
out, and the score stood 2 to 0 for K.A.
This spree brought Theta Chi to life.
Green, the first man up, singled, and
in the next two pitches, stole to third.
Helmke, on an error, took first, and
brought Green across the plate. Hanks
doubled, Uhle singled, to score
Helmke. Sellman was in a tight posi
tion with no outs against him, and
when he finally did retire the side, the
score stood 5 to 2 for Theta Chi.
Game Loosens
Green fared no better during the
next inning, with ten batsmen rotat
ing before him, bringing in four runs,
but this lead did not hold, as the for
mer's team scored again. Score at the
end of the fifth, 8 to
Morrill and Davis hit for a double
and single respectively in the ,first of
the sixth, to total the K.A. score to 8,
but three outs were taken before fur
ther damage could be done. With the
score tied, Sellman struggled in vain
