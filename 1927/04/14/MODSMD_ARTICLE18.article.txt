Intramural activity on the diamond!
yesterday was limited to only one I
game when three of the teams sched
uled to play failed to make their ap
pearance. Theta Chi, in nosing out
Kappa Alpha in a neck-and-neck strug
gle for sovfin innings, 9 to 8, packed
into the one game all the excitement
and interest that has marked a com
plete afternoon during the previous
contests of this season.
Pitchers Battle
As have most of the games played, 1
this one started off as a pitchers' bat
tle, with Bert Green, the Theta Chi
who brought his team from the box
to the finals last year, only to lose to
Junipero Serra nine, again pitching his
fast and steady game. As his opponent,
the Kappa Alphas used "Tiny" Sell
man, who had a good break on the
ball, and plenty of speed.
In the first inning, it was one, two,
three, via the strikeout route witli
Green in perfect form. It was the same
story with Theta Chi at bat, Sellman
having little difficulty disposing of the
top of the batting order.
Tight Ball Played
The pitchers eased up at intervals in
the next two innings, allowing a few
walks, and the game settled down to
tight baseball.
The strain broke in the fourth when,
with two outs and the Kappa Alphas
at bat, Green, having given Kirk Davis
a walk, was touched for a sizzling two
bagger by Sellman bringing in Davis.
Wright walked, and while Davidson
took first on an error, Sellman scored.
Hartwell ended the inning by striking
out, and the score stood 2 to 0 for K.A.
This spree brought Theta Chi to life.
Green, the first man up, singled, and
in the next two pitches, stole to third.
Helmke, on an error, took first, and
brought Green across the plate. Hanks
doubled, Uhle singled, to score
Helmke. Sellman was in a tight posi
tion with no outs against him, and
when he finally did retire the side, the
score stood 5 to 2 for Theta Chi.
Game Loosens
Green fared no better during the
next inning, with ten batsmen rotat
ing before him, bringing in four runs,
but this lead did not hold, as the for
mer's team scored again. Score at the
end of the fifth, 8 to
Morrill and Davis hit for a double
and single respectively in the ,first of
the sixth, to total the K.A. score to 8,
but three outs were taken before fur
ther damage could be done. With the
score tied, Sellman struggled in vain
nipped Laird off the base. Hadenfeldt
hit infield, and when Sharp missed
the throw from third base. Laird tallied
and Hadenfeldt was same. Rianchi was
hit by Anderson, filling the bags.
Pease knocked out a long fly to left,
and Uerg scored after the catch for
the fourth and last Stanford run. Sim
kins ended the inning by forcing
Pease.
The Rear Rabes almost put over a
run hi the fourth when Captain Vail*
anos singled but was doubled off, Sini
kins to Storey to Hadenfeldt. Sharp
was hit and Lubbock singled, but Sim
kins tightened down and fanned Niel
son to end the inning.
Cubs Tally in Eighth
Neither team threatened after this
point until California scored her only
run in the eighth. After fanning Van
Saut, hitting for Anderson, Simkins hit
Powers. Sullivan flied to Murphy for
the second out, but Yallianos and
llicksen singled in succession to score
Powers.
In their half of the eighth the Stan
sord frosh got a man on second and
third when Pease singled and was
forced by Simkins. Nevin connected
for his third hit of the day, a two
bagger, but Storey ended the inning
by flying out to Vallianos.
In the last inning, Simkins struck
out Lubbock, but Madanich, a pinch
hitter, singled. Red Rerg made a
pretty catch of Wohletz's pop fly, how
ever, and Simkins fanned Gilmore to
end the game.
Cards Have Strength
The Stanford squad was undeniable
at the bat, excellent in the field, and
well supported in the pitching box.
Simkins struck out nine men, allowed
eight scattered hits, and was in dan
ger but twice. The score:
R. H E.
California 1 18 4
Stanford . 4 10 2
Ratteries: California — Anderson,
Sellman and Hamberlin; Stanford —
Simkins and Sparks, Rerg.

hit by Anderson, filling the bags.
Pease knocked out a long fly to left,
and Uerg scored after the catch for
the fourth and last Stanford run. Sim
kins ended the inning by forcing
Pease.
The Rear Rabes almost put over a
run hi the fourth when Captain Vail*
anos singled but was doubled off, Sini
kins to Storey to Hadenfeldt. Sharp
was hit and Lubbock singled, but Sim
kins tightened down and fanned Niel
son to end the inning.
Cubs Tally in Eighth
Neither team threatened after this
point until California scored her only
run in the eighth. After fanning Van
Saut, hitting for Anderson, Simkins hit
Powers. Sullivan flied to Murphy for
the second out, but Yallianos and
llicksen singled in succession to score
Powers.
In their half of the eighth the Stan
sord frosh got a man on second and
third when Pease singled and was
forced by Simkins. Nevin connected
for his third hit of the day, a two
bagger, but Storey ended the inning
by flying out to Vallianos.
In the last inning, Simkins struck
out Lubbock, but Madanich, a pinch
hitter, singled. Red Rerg made a
pretty catch of Wohletz's pop fly, how
ever, and Simkins fanned Gilmore to
end the game.
Cards Have Strength
The Stanford squad was undeniable
at the bat, excellent in the field, and
well supported in the pitching box.
Simkins struck out nine men, allowed
eight scattered hits, and was in dan
ger but twice. The score:
R. H E.
California 1 18 4

Intramural activity on the diamond!
yesterday was limited to only one I
game when three of the teams sched
uled to play failed to make their ap
pearance. Theta Chi, in nosing out
Kappa Alpha in a neck-and-neck strug
gle for sovfin innings, 9 to 8, packed
into the one game all the excitement
and interest that has marked a com
plete afternoon during the previous
contests of this season.
Pitchers Battle
As have most of the games played, 1
this one started off as a pitchers' bat
tle, with Bert Green, the Theta Chi
who brought his team from the box
to the finals last year, only to lose to
Junipero Serra nine, again pitching his
fast and steady game. As his opponent,
the Kappa Alphas used "Tiny" Sell
man, who had a good break on the
ball, and plenty of speed.
In the first inning, it was one, two,
three, via the strikeout route witli
Green in perfect form. It was the same
story with Theta Chi at bat, Sellman
having little difficulty disposing of the
top of the batting order.
Tight Ball Played
The pitchers eased up at intervals in
the next two innings, allowing a few
walks, and the game settled down to
tight baseball.
The strain broke in the fourth when,
with two outs and the Kappa Alphas
at bat, Green, having given Kirk Davis
a walk, was touched for a sizzling two
bagger by Sellman bringing in Davis.
Wright walked, and while Davidson
took first on an error, Sellman scored.
Hartwell ended the inning by striking
out, and the score stood 2 to 0 for K.A.
This spree brought Theta Chi to life.
Green, the first man up, singled, and
in the next two pitches, stole to third.
Helmke, on an error, took first, and
brought Green across the plate. Hanks
doubled, Uhle singled, to score
Helmke. Sellman was in a tight posi
tion with no outs against him, and
when he finally did retire the side, the
score stood 5 to 2 for Theta Chi.
Game Loosens
Green fared no better during the
next inning, with ten batsmen rotat
ing before him, bringing in four runs,
but this lead did not hold, as the for
mer's team scored again. Score at the
end of the fifth, 8 to
Morrill and Davis hit for a double
and single respectively in the ,first of
the sixth, to total the K.A. score to 8,
but three outs were taken before fur
ther damage could be done. With the
score tied, Sellman struggled in vain
nipped Laird off the base. Hadenfeldt
hit infield, and when Sharp missed
the throw from third base. Laird tallied
and Hadenfeldt was same. Rianchi was
hit by Anderson, filling the bags.
Pease knocked out a long fly to left,
and Uerg scored after the catch for
the fourth and last Stanford run. Sim
kins ended the inning by forcing

top of the batting order.
Tight Ball Played
The pitchers eased up at intervals in
the next two innings, allowing a few
walks, and the game settled down to
tight baseball.
The strain broke in the fourth when,
with two outs and the Kappa Alphas
at bat, Green, having given Kirk Davis
a walk, was touched for a sizzling two
bagger by Sellman bringing in Davis.
Wright walked, and while Davidson
took first on an error, Sellman scored.
Hartwell ended the inning by striking
out, and the score stood 2 to 0 for K.A.
This spree brought Theta Chi to life.
Green, the first man up, singled, and
in the next two pitches, stole to third.
Helmke, on an error, took first, and
brought Green across the plate. Hanks
doubled, Uhle singled, to score
Helmke. Sellman was in a tight posi
tion with no outs against him, and
when he finally did retire the side, the
score stood 5 to 2 for Theta Chi.
Game Loosens
Green fared no better during the
next inning, with ten batsmen rotat
ing before him, bringing in four runs,
but this lead did not hold, as the for
mer's team scored again. Score at the
end of the fifth, 8 to
Morrill and Davis hit for a double
and single respectively in the ,first of
the sixth, to total the K.A. score to 8,
but three outs were taken before fur
ther damage could be done. With the
score tied, Sellman struggled in vain
nipped Laird off the base. Hadenfeldt
hit infield, and when Sharp missed
the throw from third base. Laird tallied
and Hadenfeldt was same. Rianchi was
hit by Anderson, filling the bags.
Pease knocked out a long fly to left,
and Uerg scored after the catch for
the fourth and last Stanford run. Sim
kins ended the inning by forcing
Pease.
The Rear Rabes almost put over a
run hi the fourth when Captain Vail*
anos singled but was doubled off, Sini
kins to Storey to Hadenfeldt. Sharp
was hit and Lubbock singled, but Sim
kins tightened down and fanned Niel
son to end the inning.
Cubs Tally in Eighth
Neither team threatened after this
point until California scored her only
run in the eighth. After fanning Van
Saut, hitting for Anderson, Simkins hit
Powers. Sullivan flied to Murphy for
the second out, but Yallianos and
llicksen singled in succession to score
Powers.
In their half of the eighth the Stan
sord frosh got a man on second and
third when Pease singled and was
forced by Simkins. Nevin connected
for his third hit of the day, a two
bagger, but Storey ended the inning
by flying out to Vallianos.
In the last inning, Simkins struck
out Lubbock, but Madanich, a pinch
hitter, singled. Red Rerg made a
pretty catch of Wohletz's pop fly, how
ever, and Simkins fanned Gilmore to
end the game.
Cards Have Strength
The Stanford squad was undeniable
at the bat, excellent in the field, and
well supported in the pitching box.
Simkins struck out nine men, allowed
eight scattered hits, and was in dan
ger but twice. The score:
R. H E.
California 1 18 4
Stanford . 4 10 2
Ratteries: California — Anderson,
Sellman and Hamberlin; Stanford —
Simkins and Sparks, Rerg.

Intramural activity on the diamond!
yesterday was limited to only one I
game when three of the teams sched
uled to play failed to make their ap
pearance. Theta Chi, in nosing out
Kappa Alpha in a neck-and-neck strug
gle for sovfin innings, 9 to 8, packed
into the one game all the excitement
and interest that has marked a com
plete afternoon during the previous
contests of this season.
Pitchers Battle
As have most of the games played, 1
this one started off as a pitchers' bat
tle, with Bert Green, the Theta Chi
who brought his team from the box
to the finals last year, only to lose to
Junipero Serra nine, again pitching his
fast and steady game. As his opponent,
the Kappa Alphas used "Tiny" Sell
man, who had a good break on the
ball, and plenty of speed.
In the first inning, it was one, two,
three, via the strikeout route witli
Green in perfect form. It was the same
story with Theta Chi at bat, Sellman
having little difficulty disposing of the
top of the batting order.
