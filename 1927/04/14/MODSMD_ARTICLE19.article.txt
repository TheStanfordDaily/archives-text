# FRESHMEN ME SEMES WITH 4-1 WIN FROM CUB BAIL NINE
## Simkins Pitches Good Ball, Gets Strong Support; Babes Bat Well BERRY REPLACES SPARKS Four-Run Lead in Third Puts Stanford Out Of Danger 
### 
Bill Simkins pitched the Stanford
freshman baseball team to a 4 to 1
victory over the University of Cali
fornia freshman nine on the Stanford
diamond yesterday afternoon, giving
the Cardinal Babes their second
straight win from the Bears and the
annual series. The Stanford yearlings
made all their runs in the third in
ning, and after this point Simkins was
in little danger.
The Cards started pounding Ander
son from the start, Levin meeting the
first ball pitched for a single to left.
Storey sacrificed him to second, and
after Murphy went out infield. Laird
and Berg drew walks, filling the bags.
Hadenfeldt failed to come through,
j however, and after a few futile pokes
I at the ball struck out to end the inning.
Sparks Retires
Another threatened attack was nip
| ped in the second by a timely double
; play. Bianclii singled to start the in-
J ning, and Sparks hit to third base,
! where the play started. Just before
! reaching first Sparks tore a ligament
; in his leg and fell to the ground. Red
j Berg proved himself an all-around
i star, coming in from center field to
' replace Sparks behind the bat, and
I playing an excellent game as catcher,
i Levin started the eventful third
! with another drive to left.. Storey
| fouled to first base, and Murphy
! singled over third. Powers made a
j pretty stop of the ball and almost
to hold the batting Theta Chis score- j
less. Rut Hogle tallied when Dye I
dumped a Texas Leaguer between
second and first. Morrill took over the
duties, and prevented further scor
ing. Rut the ball game was over, for ;
Green, throwing three successive |
strikeouts, put an abrupt end to the
contest.
Rreakers and Delta Chi, left without
opponents due to defaults, played a j
practice game for a few innings, j
