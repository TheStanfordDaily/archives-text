# Arousing the Aesthetic Sense
## 
### 
Aldous Huxley, English essayist says, "There is beauty in the moral
world and in the intellectual world; but there is also a beauty which is
neither moral nor intellectual—the beauty of the world of art. There are
men who are devoid of the power of seeing it There are others in
whom it is an overpowering passion ; happy men, born with the productive,
or at lowest, the appreciative genius of the artist. But, in the mass of
mankind, the aesthetic faculty, like the reasoning power and the moral
sense, needs to he aroused, directed, and cultivated; and I know not why
the development of that side of his nature, through which man has an ac
cess to a perennial spring of enobling pleasure, should be omitted from
any 'comprehensive scheme of university education."
Tuesday night Roland Hayes, negro tenor, sang on the Stanford cam
pus. Students had the opportunity of enjoying the beauty of which Hux
ley speaks. The students availing themselves of the opportunity com
pletely filled the Assembly Hall. It was an appreciative and enthusiastic
audience that greeted Hayes. If the students attended the concert with
the view of developing their artistic culture, they at least enjoyed the pro
cess.
The Roland Hayes concert was sponsored'by the Peninsula Musical
Association, but the Associated Students of Stanford themselves ar
ranged a series of similar concerts during the present academic year and
are now planning a second program for next season. Tito Schipa, Rosa
Ponselle, Louis Graveure, Mischa Elman's quartette, Alfred Hertz and
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra are the musical geniuses students
secured for their enjoyment this year. A list of artists as well known as
these is being engaged for the 1927-28 season. All this year's concerts
were well attended, and.the second series has been planned because of the
success of the first.
If the aesthetic sense needs to be aroused, directed, and cultivated
Stanford is doing its part toward artistic appreciation as it is in the fields
of moral and intellectual education. The most promising feature of this
kind of education is that the students have responded.
