# Last Chance for Tickets!
## 
### 
Students will be given their final chance today by the Board of Ath
letic Control to purchase rooters'.tickets for the Big Meet. By this last
minute sale Stanford will have a larger rooting section and many students
who for some reason or other did not obtain their tickets at the sale over
a week ago will be satisfied. The saving in the difference of prices of gen
eral admission and rooters' tickets will be the main reason for the satis
faction and the possession of seats in Stanford's rooting section will give
added satisfaction.
And so what was the cause of a flurry of excitement over the campus
is smoothed over by the announcement of another sale. The track meet
is for t\je students as well as the public but the rooting section is for the
students only and they should be. given every opportunity to get tickets
for it if they so desire. Tomorrow's sale corrects the original plan of
closing the rooters' ticket office window too early and satisfaction should
result.
MEETING OF THE EDITORIAL STAFF to be held in the Daily
office today at 1 o'clock.
Our "500"' is still maintaining its place in the limelight. The Wash
ington Daily says:
"The recent publicity given to the co-ed smokers of Stanford causes us to
wonder how far the habit of smoking will progress among college women. In
our opinion, the climax will probably lie reached when the sorority sisters
are taxed two bucks apiece in order to pay for the new lavender spittoons
in the living room."
Higher and higher education as it is done in the Middlewest and ex
posed in The University Daily Katisan:
"A three-day school in parenthood has opened, attended by more than
2000 fathers and mothers. The Kansas City Children's Bureau and the child
research of the University of Kansas, who are sponsoring the midwest con
ference on education for parenthood, hope to preserve the moral and integral
structure of America's youth, termed as 'the nation's most valuable asset'."
When the Daily Californian quoted President W. W. Campbell, of
the State University, as crediting the California climate with the lack of
student tragedies during the recent suicide wave, the Neiv Student made
this comment:
"It is reported from none too reliable sources that when this statement
appeared in the paper 500 students left their various colleges overnight and
took the first train for California; the price of carbolic acid dropped five
cents to the bottle in Rochester, N.Y., and the promoter of a new university
of Alaska dropped dead in the streets of Chicago."

"A three-day school in parenthood has opened, attended by more than
2000 fathers and mothers. The Kansas City Children's Bureau and the child
research of the University of Kansas, who are sponsoring the midwest con
ference on education for parenthood, hope to preserve the moral and integral
structure of America's youth, termed as 'the nation's most valuable asset'."
When the Daily Californian quoted President W. W. Campbell, of
the State University, as crediting the California climate with the lack of
student tragedies during the recent suicide wave, the Neiv Student made
this comment:
"It is reported from none too reliable sources that when this statement
appeared in the paper 500 students left their various colleges overnight and
took the first train for California; the price of carbolic acid dropped five
cents to the bottle in Rochester, N.Y., and the promoter of a new university
of Alaska dropped dead in the streets of Chicago."
Students will be given their final chance today by the Board of Ath
letic Control to purchase rooters'.tickets for the Big Meet. By this last
minute sale Stanford will have a larger rooting section and many students
who for some reason or other did not obtain their tickets at the sale over
a week ago will be satisfied. The saving in the difference of prices of gen
eral admission and rooters' tickets will be the main reason for the satis
faction and the possession of seats in Stanford's rooting section will give
added satisfaction.
And so what was the cause of a flurry of excitement over the campus
is smoothed over by the announcement of another sale. The track meet
is for t\je students as well as the public but the rooting section is for the
students only and they should be. given every opportunity to get tickets
for it if they so desire. Tomorrow's sale corrects the original plan of
closing the rooters' ticket office window too early and satisfaction should
result.
MEETING OF THE EDITORIAL STAFF to be held in the Daily
office today at 1 o'clock.
Our "500"' is still maintaining its place in the limelight. The Wash
ington Daily says:
"The recent publicity given to the co-ed smokers of Stanford causes us to
wonder how far the habit of smoking will progress among college women. In
our opinion, the climax will probably lie reached when the sorority sisters
are taxed two bucks apiece in order to pay for the new lavender spittoons
in the living room."
