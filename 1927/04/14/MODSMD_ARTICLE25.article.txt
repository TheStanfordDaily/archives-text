## PLEDGING—A MORAL VICTORY 
### 
Sororities on the Stanford campus, j
despite various restrictions placed upon
their rushing activities, recently pledged
seventy-nine women. Bids were offered ,
tu eighty-four. These figures do not j
include any post season pledging, al- i
though there will undoubtedly be some.'
,
Contrast the total number of women §
pledged with the number eligible for
rushing this year, one hundred and i
fifty. It will be noted that the large'
majority of women, after trying the
dormitory for the better part of a year,
have decided in favor of the smaller and
more intimate type of living group.
This observation is particularly per-j
tinent, coming at a time when it is
known that the administration favors
the abolition of sororities. It has been
stated repeatedly that the women them- j

| selves are dissatisfied with the sorority
j system and would be glad to have it
| abolished. A few years ago, an open
j forum was called with the idea in mind
jof discussing the matter. At that time
jit was made evident that there was little
or no agitation on the part of the
1 women themselves to do away with the
Ismail living groups. The results of the
! present rushing season would appar-1
| ently indicate that sentiment among the
| women is still in favor of sororities.
In the past the administration has
adopted the wise and temperate policy
of allowing the student body to decide
I matters of this type for itself. It is to
| he hoped earnestly that this policy will
ibe maintained just as long as the
women themselves believe that the
sorority system satisfies their needs.
