# SURROUNDING COUNTRIES OFFER MANY TRIPS LICK OBSERVATORY ONLY FORTY MILES AWAY MR. HAMILTON SCIENTISTS WELCOME VISITORS

### Hallie Keating 
Students whose spring; fever takes the
form of wanderlust will find many in
teresting trips in the immediate vicinity
of Stanford. Forty rough miles south
east from here, for instance, is the sec
ond largest telescope in the world.
The observatory at Lick is well worth
a visit. The big 36-inch refractor is
one of the "seven wonders of the world"
today, an dthe observatory is a fascinat
ing place because of its historical asso
ciations, its equipment .and the view
which it offers of the peninsula.
Visitors Welcomed
On every Saturday night of reason
ably clear weather Lick is open to vis
itors and its scientific staff is on public
duty. The observatory is also open
every day of the year from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m., and though daytime visitors do
not have the opportunity to look at
their favorite stars, they may go
through the buildings and have the me
chanics of the telescopes explained to
them.
The main buildings and the two big
domes are on the western peak of
Mount Hamilton, at a height of 4,209
feet. The view of San Jose, the bay,
and the peninsula from here is an in
ducement in itself to make the trip.
Water Power Used
On the central and eastern peaks are
large reservoirs which supply Lick with
water sor household and photographic

j purposes, and with power to operate the
! niovalile floor in the big dome. The j
j Crosseley reflector, used for photo- j
I graphic purposes, is located about half!
] a mile below.
The floor of the big dome was one of
i the first movable type to be constructed.
| It is 60 feet in diameter and can be j
j raised or lowered a distance of 16Yz j
feet, according to the position of stars i
under observation. The telescope is a |
mammoth affair, but is so perfectly ad- J
justed that its position may be changed
with the slightest effort. This instru
' ment has also a photographic correcting ,
| lens of thirty-three inches aperture, j
j and various auxiliary instruments, such
! as spectographs, seismographs, clocks,!
| chronographs, photometers, and such.
Donor Buried Here
One of the most impressive details of!
{ all is the bronze plate at the base of the
| big telescope which marks the grave of
I James Lick. His donation of his entire I
j fortune of $3,000,000 ,for the observa
| tory carried the sole stipulation that his I
. body be buried at the foot of the tele
! scope.
In 1874 James Lick executed a deed
i of trust providing for the construction
jof a telescope, ' superior to and more
! powerful than any telescope ever vet
j made, and an observatory suitable to he j
connected therewith." The construc-1
tion of the observatory was completed !
in 1888.
Investigational work of great value
has been accomplished at Lick. Prob
ably the most conspicuous of which has
been the study of binary stars. The j
( hile station of Lick observatory is 10-1
cated on the summit of Cerro San Cris-1
tobal.

a visit. The big 36-inch refractor is
one of the "seven wonders of the world"
today, an dthe observatory is a fascinat
ing place because of its historical asso
ciations, its equipment .and the view
which it offers of the peninsula.
Visitors Welcomed
On every Saturday night of reason
ably clear weather Lick is open to vis
itors and its scientific staff is on public
duty. The observatory is also open
every day of the year from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m., and though daytime visitors do
not have the opportunity to look at
their favorite stars, they may go
through the buildings and have the me
chanics of the telescopes explained to
them.
The main buildings and the two big
domes are on the western peak of
Mount Hamilton, at a height of 4,209
feet. The view of San Jose, the bay,
and the peninsula from here is an in
ducement in itself to make the trip.
Water Power Used
On the central and eastern peaks are
large reservoirs which supply Lick with
water sor household and photographic

j purposes, and with power to operate the
! niovalile floor in the big dome. The j
j Crosseley reflector, used for photo- j
I graphic purposes, is located about half!
] a mile below.
The floor of the big dome was one of
i the first movable type to be constructed.
| It is 60 feet in diameter and can be j
j raised or lowered a distance of 16Yz j
feet, according to the position of stars i
under observation. The telescope is a |
mammoth affair, but is so perfectly ad- J
justed that its position may be changed
with the slightest effort. This instru
' ment has also a photographic correcting ,
| lens of thirty-three inches aperture, j
j and various auxiliary instruments, such
! as spectographs, seismographs, clocks,!
| chronographs, photometers, and such.
Donor Buried Here
One of the most impressive details of!
{ all is the bronze plate at the base of the
| big telescope which marks the grave of
I James Lick. His donation of his entire I
j fortune of $3,000,000 ,for the observa
| tory carried the sole stipulation that his I
. body be buried at the foot of the tele
! scope.
In 1874 James Lick executed a deed
i of trust providing for the construction
jof a telescope, ' superior to and more
! powerful than any telescope ever vet
j made, and an observatory suitable to he j
connected therewith." The construc-1
tion of the observatory was completed !
in 1888.
Investigational work of great value
has been accomplished at Lick. Prob
ably the most conspicuous of which has
been the study of binary stars. The j
( hile station of Lick observatory is 10-1
cated on the summit of Cerro San Cris-1
tobal.
Students whose spring; fever takes the
form of wanderlust will find many in
teresting trips in the immediate vicinity
of Stanford. Forty rough miles south
east from here, for instance, is the sec
ond largest telescope in the world.
