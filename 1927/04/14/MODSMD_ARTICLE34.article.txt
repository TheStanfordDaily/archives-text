# ROLAND HAYES WILL BUILD SCHOOLHOUSES FOR NEGRO TRAINING
## Institution to Be Created From Concert Returns In Mother's Honor 
### 
Roland Hayes, negro lyric tenor who
appeared in a concert on the campus
Tuesday night, is in the act of building
an institution to commemorate his
mother, to whose efforts he offers all
his success.
Near Calhoun, Georgia, where Hayes
was brought up, he has purchased
some 600 acres on which he will con
struct schoolhouses from his concert
box office returns. The name of the
memorial is to be "Angelmo," a con
traction of "Angel mother."
Hayes says that it is to be h place
where inspiration, talent, and ambi
tion of any kind among his own peo
ple will be trained and given an outlet.
"The doors will never be closed to any
people," he declared. These are his
aims instead of providing impressive
buildings or equipment.
The negro singer believes that it
will take some time to complete con
struction as the ideals he has in mind
are "necessarily matters of slow
growth." 1 lis future concert activities
in behalf of the "Angelmo" will be in
regions and places where he has never
appeared before.
