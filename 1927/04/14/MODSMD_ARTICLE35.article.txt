"Unpreparedness for war is a deep
rooted psychological characteristic of
the American people, and will be hard
to eradicate," said General Mason Pat
rick, Chief of the Army Air Service, in
a recent interview in the Daily Prince
tonian.
"The United States has never been
prepared for a war, and never will be.
Evidently the American people take no
stock in the words of George Washing
ton: 'The best way to maintain peace is
to prepare for war.' In spite of the fact
that we have had a war almost every
'genertaion, America has relied on her
isolation and her strength to carry her
through any difficulties.
"Every one of our victorious wars
has been a disaster financially, and it
seems obvious that the people of the
United States would realize that a little
expenditure in preparation might save
much of the money lost in war," the
general said.
