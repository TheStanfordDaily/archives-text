# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Ott and Lott—what a pair! Not
world-famous right now, but who knows
but that in five or ten years the whole
world may be ringing with the praises
of "Ott, Uie greatest of outfielders,"
and "Lott, the greatest of tennis play
ers?" Stranger things have happened
in sports than that these two young
sters with the phonetically similar
names should go up together on the
ladder of athletic success.
First consider Melvin Ott, the heavy
hitting Giant, who is likely to have all
the fans yelling "Ottaboy" for years to
come. Ott was born on March 2, 1909,
when Grover Cleveland Alexander, one
of the pitchers he will bat against dur
ing the season, was beginning his pro
fessional diamond career. Melvin
learned his baseball at Gretna High
School, Louisiana, and in September,
1925, one Harry Williams sent the
youngster to McGraw for a tcial as a
catcher. Fhe Giant manager was quick
to recognize Ott's possibilities as' a
batter, and made him over into an out
fielder.
Cold figures glow with the warmth
of enthusiasm when used to tell 17-
year-old Ott's record with the Giants
during 1926, when he was kept around
as a" utility outfielder and pinch-hitter.
In thirty-five games he made twenty
three hits out of sixty times at bat,
scored seven runs, hit two two-baggers,
and stole one base. How many lads of
his age would have done half as well?
Now consider the slightly older
George Lott, who made something of a

reputation f 4 or himself around Chicago
as a high school baseball and basket
ball star, and by being ranked ninth
among the nation's tennis stars in 1924,
when he was the national junior cham
! pion. "Youth will be served," so the
saying goes, and in the finals of the
j Halifax singles championship at Or
mond Beach, Florida, on March 26,
I young George was served by and served
! back to that veteran king of them all,
Big Bill rilden. Here again cold fig
ures become hot—this time for Lott.
; The final score was 6-3, 0-6, 7-5, 6-3,
| with George Lott on the end. His
j youthful enthusiasm in "leaping and
j yelling like an Indian" after the match
j was over, was all good stuff. I'm for
I more of that in tennis. It's much too
J f |uiet a game still. We need more Jean
Borotras, Brian Nortons, and George
| Lotts, who do things a little differently!
