# Students at Northwestern Campaign for Movies, Fail
## 
### 
Despite an enthusiastic campaign to
restore Sunday movies, students of
Northwestern University must con
tinue to stay at home and play bridge
for Sabbath entertainment. Citizens
of Evanston, Illinois, voted down res
toration of Sunday amusements, al
though 300 students paraded the streets
carrying banners expressing a desire
for more movies.
