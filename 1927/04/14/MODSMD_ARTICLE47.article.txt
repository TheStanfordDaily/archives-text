# MILITARY BALL BIDS ARE STILL AVAILABLE
## 
### 
Ephraim Adams, chairman of the
general committee for the Military Ball
to be held here April 22, announces
that tickcts are still obtainable at the
Bookstore an dat the Acocunting Of
fice. However, they are almost all sold,
and so cannot be guaranteed after this
week.
As the Pavilion is now being used,
decorations have been held up, but all
materials are on hand, and the decora
tions committee will start work within
a few days. The outside court of a
medieval castle will be the motif fol
lowed in the decorations, stated Adams.
