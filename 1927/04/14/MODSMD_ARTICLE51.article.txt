## 
### 
Denver, Colo., April 13.—(IP) —Mrs.
Francis W. Conklin, white-haired i
grandmother, who is a co-ed at the I
University of Denver, thinks the cur-!
rent derogatory critici.-m of youth is all |
wrong.
She knows that modern youth is all
right, because she has been associating ;
with the younger gencrtaion for two
and a half years as a student of the
university here.
"Critics of modern youth," she says,;
"are sex-obsessionists . They are af- j
dieted with tangled complexes—or per-1
haps dyspeptic conceptions."
It had been Mrs. Conklin's life am
bition to attend college, but this pleas- j
ure was denied her until her children i
grew up. When her daughter gradu-1
ated, however, and her son was a senior, j
she entered Denver as a freshman. And ;
now she has come to the conclusion i
that "college life is not what the critics ;
say it is."
She declares that she is proud that!
her children have a better and health- j
ier attitude toward life than she did in j
her youth.
