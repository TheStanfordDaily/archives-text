# CARDS WILL COMPETE WITH BEARS TODAY IN SECOND DIAMOND TILT
## Sobieski to Start on Mound; Philippi Will Serve as Reserve Pitcher 
### 
What may be the deciding game of
the annual baseball series between the
Stanford and University of California
nines will be played this afternoon at
West field in Berkeley. The Bears have
the edge on the series, having defeated
the Cardinals at Stanford Tuesday by
a score of 3 to 1. The final game will
be played at Stanford following the
Big Meet.
Sobieski to Pitch
Stanford's chances today rest on
the performance of John Sobieski,
who will start on the mound against
the Bears. Sobieski pitched the last
part of Tuesday's game, and with the
exception of two two-base hits, had
the California men well in hand. Bob
Philippi will serve as reserve pitcher,
while Captain Steve Collins will be
saved for Saturday's game.
Much depends on the fielding of the
Stanford infield this afternoon, as the
five errors made Tuesday lost the con
test for the Cards. Jimmy Buscli is
apparently the only man who handles
himself flawlessly, although both Gari
baldi and Maguire are good men when
in form. Third base continues to be
Coach Ilarry Wolter's chief worry, as
Harder fails to fill that position to
any degree of excellency.
Outfield Strong
Stewart, Nissen, and Wilton may be
relied upon to take care of the out
field, while Cook Sypher's steady
game behind the bat contributes great
ly to the stability of the entire Stan
ford squad. The hitting of these men
has also been one of their chief attri
butes, euch of the men connecting for
at least one hit in the first game
against California.
Coach Carl Zamloch will start Jacob
sen in the box against Stanford in
the game today, while Wyatt will
catch. This combination has turned in
many good games this year, and will
undoubtedly trouble the Cardinal bat-
