# BIG MEET OFFERS STANFORD CHANCE TO TIE OLO SCORE
## CARDS HEAVY FAVORITES Golden Bears Hold 16 Wins To Cardinals' 15; Ties Resulted Twice 
### Joe Carroll 
Saturday afternoon, April 19 —The
Big Meet. Stanford University faces
the University of California in indi
vidual and team competition in track
and field events.
The thirty-fourth annual Big Meet
offers the Cardinals an opportunity to
even old scores with the Bears. Cali
fornia has won sixteen meets, Stan
ford fifteen, and two have been tied.
When Stanford meets California it's
a Big Event —the Big Game or the
Big Meet. No matter how overwhelm
ingly the dope may point to a Cardinal
or Bear victory, followers of sport
know that a real spectacle will be
presented where the two teams meet.
Dope this season favors th» Cardinal
outfit. But the California athletes are
being brought along slowly by Walt
Christie, Berkeley coach. They are
always rounded into shape for the Big
Meet.
By taking absolutely every break in
every event, California could squeeze
through for a win. It is this possibility
which has served to raise the Bears
to high hopes.
Stanford athletes are hoping to
break some records. The quarter-mile
seems doomed. Perhaps Emerson
Spencer, will crash the eleven-year-old
world's record.
Biff Hoffman has his last opportun
ity, in a Big Meet, of defeating Elmer
Gerkin, California weight heaver who
has bested him twice. Coach Christie
counts upon Gerkin to repeat again
this year.
But Biff will have something to say
about the matter. A potential world's
record-holder, with prospects of jour
neying to the Olympic Games next
year, Hoffman has been training stead
ily and faithfully.
His steady improvement in competi
tion leads Stanford followers to be
lieve that this year is Biff's year for
revenge.
This much can definitely be said
about the meet: it will be a battle all
the way. Several new records may be
set under the stress of competition.
For remember, this is the Big Meet.
