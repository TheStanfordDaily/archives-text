# CARDINAL TENNIS MEN FAVORED IN MATCHES WITH U.C. TOMORROW
## Holman to Face California For Last Time; Both Teams Undefeated 
### Milton Silverman 
The best team that Stanford has had
for years, including the finest player it
lias probably ever had, will face the Cali
fornia tennis squad at 10 o'clock to
morrow morning on the varsity courts.
Experts are predicting that the Cardinals
will win by a substantial score, and the
Stanford men themselves are confident
of a hard-earned victory.
Captain Cranston Holman, ranking first
man on the Stanford team, will meet
California for the last time tomorrow.
He, like his teammates, is in the best of
condition, and will doubtless show much
of the form that has won him numerous
championships during the past few years.
Team in Good Form
Lionel Ogden, number two man, has
been developing the best playing of his
career during the past season, and should
undoubtedly account for a victory tomor
row. The third ranking man, Ralph Mc-
Elvenny, has another year to play against
the Bears, as has Alan Herrington. Both
of these have been giving promise of dis
playing an excellent brand of tennis.
California, lacking the valuable aid of
Edward "Bud" Chandler, national inter
collegiate champion, has comparatively a
new team matched against the Cardinals.
Bradshaw Harrison, who is one of the
outstanding Berkeley men, is ineligible at
the present time, but efforts are being
made to restore his eligibility in time for
the match.
Holman Plays Stow
If Harrison does not play, however,
Holman will meet Tom Stow, Ogden will
meet Johnny Risso, left-handed player,
and McElvenny will meet Dick Iloogs
in the singles. For the doubles matches,
Holman will pair with Ogden, and Mc-
Elvenny with Herrington.
Both teams have passed through the
season without a defeat. The best means
of comparison lies in the matches against
the U.S.C. team which played both the
Bears and the Cardinals recently. The
Trojans lost to Stanford 5-0, and to
California 4-1. The Cardinal players did
not lose a set to the southerners.
