ish press of California, once the property
of General Vallejo, has been presented to
the University by W. B. Bourn, formerly
a trustee of the University. The book is
known as the Vallejo-Bosqui-Turrill vol
ume of Zamorano imprints, and is val

were printed at Sonoma on what is
called the Zamorano press, a hand press
that with a small quantity of poor type
was brought to Monterey from Mexico
by Governor Figueroa in 1833 and later
moved to Sonoma, where it was used
under the direction of General Vallejo.
General Vallejo, whose signature in the
volume that has now come into the pos
session of Stanford adds value, presented
it in 1878 to Edward Bosqui, one of San
Francisco's most distinguished printers.
Bosqui presented it in 1912 to Charles B.
Turrill, from whom it was obtained by
Mr. Bourn.
Ying Yuan Cheng, a student in Stan
ford from Peking, has presented the Uni
versity with twenty-nine volumes of rep

agreed to assist in properly classifying
and cataloguing them.
Alfred C. Elkinton of Berkeley notified
the trustees through President Wilbur
that he will arrange to provide $2000 for
a chair at Stanford next year on Oriental
affairs, particularly with regard to civili
zation and language. This will enable
Stanford to make progress in meeting
frequently expressed desires to offer more
courses in these subjects, especially in
languages.
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett, who
will be on the "University Afloat" next
year, will be replaced by Professor Blanks,
who is an assistant professor of public
speaking at the University of California.
Professor Blanks, who received his A.B.
and his M.A. at Vanderbilt University,

known as the Vallejo-Bosqui-Turrill vol
ume of Zamorano imprints, and is val
ued at $1,500. It contains seven items that
were printed at Sonoma on what is
called the Zamorano press, a hand press
that with a small quantity of poor type
was brought to Monterey from Mexico
by Governor Figueroa in 1833 and later
moved to Sonoma, where it was used
under the direction of General Vallejo.
General Vallejo, whose signature in the
volume that has now come into the pos
session of Stanford adds value, presented
it in 1878 to Edward Bosqui, one of San
Francisco's most distinguished printers.
Bosqui presented it in 1912 to Charles B.
Turrill, from whom it was obtained by
Mr. Bourn.
Ying Yuan Cheng, a student in Stan
ford from Peking, has presented the Uni
versity with twenty-nine volumes of rep
resentative Chinese literature, and has
agreed to assist in properly classifying
and cataloguing them.
Alfred C. Elkinton of Berkeley notified
the trustees through President Wilbur
that he will arrange to provide $2000 for
a chair at Stanford next year on Oriental
affairs, particularly with regard to civili
zation and language. This will enable
Stanford to make progress in meeting
frequently expressed desires to offer more
courses in these subjects, especially in
languages.
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett, who
will be on the "University Afloat" next
year, will be replaced by Professor Blanks,
who is an assistant professor of public
speaking at the University of California.
Professor Blanks, who received his A.B.
and his M.A. at Vanderbilt University,
has taught in several other universities,
including Ohio Wesleyan, Colgate Uni
versity, and the University of Southern
California.
Two gifts of unique interest and value
to the Stanford library, announcement
of provision for courses in the Chinese
language and civilization, and the ap
pointment of Professor Anthony F.
Blanks of the University of California to
the Stanford Division of Public Speaking
for next year during the absence of Pro
fessor Lee Emerson Bassett, were among
the interesting items in the regular month
ly meeting of the Board of Trustees yes
terday afternoon.
A collection of imprints from the Span
ish press of California, once the property

ume of Zamorano imprints, and is val
