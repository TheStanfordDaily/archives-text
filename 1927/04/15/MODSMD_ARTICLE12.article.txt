# BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE SHOULD FEATURE STANFORD-U.C. BIG MEET
## Cards Are Doped to Win by Wide Margin; Individual Work Will Give Thrills BEAR SPRINTERS GOOD New World Record in 440 Figured on Basis of Spencer's Times

\\ ith a possibility that Emerson Spen
; cer will break the world's record in the
| 440, and with real battles on tap in sev-
I eral events, the thirty-fourth annual Big
Meet between the University of Califor
; ilia and Stanford tomorrow afternoon
l promises to present a vivid and interest
t ing spectacle of track and field events.
This is true despite the fact that Stan
ford is doped to win by margins varying
| from a point or so .to more than twenty.
Individual competition is bound to lend
I interest even to a meet in which one
j team is such a heavy favorite.
Comparisons Look Bad
Based on a comparison of point win
i ners in the Big Meet last year, the Car
' dinals should fear California greatly,
j Only twelve of the points that California
| scored then were made by men who have
; now graduated, while about thirty Stan
| ford points were made by men who com
| peted for the last time under the red
| colors.
Bear Sprinters Good
j Ewing, Giguerre, and Van Gelder are
| the Bear sprinters. Ewing seems to be
the class of the lot, topping Richman,
Lauritzen, and Bly in the 100, but prob
j ably having to give way in the 220 to
j Richman or Lauritzen.
Elmer Boyden should be the class of
| the half. McKinnon, if he runs the 880,
I Clum, and McGuire are the Stanford
| hopes. Tom Moss, who showed up well
