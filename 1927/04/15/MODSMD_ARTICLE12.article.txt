# BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE SHOULD FEATURE STANFORD-U.C. BIG MEET
## Cards Are Doped to Win by Wide Margin; Individual Work Will Give Thrills BEAR SPRINTERS GOOD New World Record in 440 Figured on Basis of Spencer's Times 
### Joe Carroll 
\\ ith a possibility that Emerson Spen
; cer will break the world's record in the
| 440, and with real battles on tap in sev-
I eral events, the thirty-fourth annual Big
Meet between the University of Califor
; ilia and Stanford tomorrow afternoon
l promises to present a vivid and interest
t ing spectacle of track and field events.
This is true despite the fact that Stan
ford is doped to win by margins varying
| from a point or so .to more than twenty.
Individual competition is bound to lend
I interest even to a meet in which one
j team is such a heavy favorite.
Comparisons Look Bad
Based on a comparison of point win
i ners in the Big Meet last year, the Car
' dinals should fear California greatly,
j Only twelve of the points that California
| scored then were made by men who have
; now graduated, while about thirty Stan
| ford points were made by men who com
| peted for the last time under the red
| colors.
Bear Sprinters Good
j Ewing, Giguerre, and Van Gelder are
| the Bear sprinters. Ewing seems to be
the class of the lot, topping Richman,
Lauritzen, and Bly in the 100, but prob
j ably having to give way in the 220 to
j Richman or Lauritzen.
Elmer Boyden should be the class of
| the half. McKinnon, if he runs the 880,
I Clum, and McGuire are the Stanford
| hopes. Tom Moss, who showed up well
in early season work, has been taken to
the hospital with a touch of flu and will
not be able to run tomorrow.
McKinnon Likely Contender
Alex McKinnon's splendid showing
last Saturday makes him a likely con
tender in the mile, though Les Schwo
beda, U.C., is reckoned as the Coast's
best collegiate miler. Carter has been
running close to Schwobcda, which means
that Swain and Gooden, the other two
Stanford entries, will have their work
cut out for them to place.
Rufus Ranney's decided improvement
this year means that he will give Stevens
'a real battle for honors in the eight laps.
The Bear two-miler holds the present
Stanford-California record of 9 minutes
43 seconds.
The hurdles offer a real problem. John
son of California won the lows last year,
beating West and Spencer of Stanford.
But Johnson has made a poor showing so
far this season. Ragan looks.like a pos
sible second with Nichols third. Nichols
should win the highs, with West second
and Ragan third.
Sweeps Counted On
The broad jump and javelin are doped
to give Stanford eighteen points, with
Dyer, Meeks, and Zombro taking the
places in the jump, and Joaquin, Shipkey,
and Sparling shutting out the Blue and
Gold in the javelin throw. Bob King
ought to win the high jump. Tom Work
has a better record than Hampton, Cali
fornia hope, but Hampton tied for first
with these two last year. He may repeat.
Ward Edmonds has made a much better
showing in the pole vault this year than
has Hill of California, present record
holder. Walt Hulsman may tie Hill for
second or even beat him.
Gerkin, Hoffman Duel
The two great duels of the day will be
between Elmer Gerkin, California cap
tain and strong man, and Biff Hoffman,
Stanford fullback and weight heaver.
Gerkin has conquered Hoffman for two
consecutive years, but Hoffman has been
much more consistent this year. He is
easily the best in the shot, but Gerkin
may put the Indian sign on him again
in the discus.
Coach Templeton has developed a relay
team this year that bids fair to equal last
year's record-breaking squad, which was
about the best relay team that ever ran
for the Cardinals.
