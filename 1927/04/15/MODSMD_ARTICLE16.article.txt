# Howdy Alumni, Hop In
## 
### 
So they decided to call tomorrow All-Stanford Day. It used to be
known as Homecoming Day, and later as Alumni Day, but this year it
was thought better to set aside one day at which time all Stanford men
and women, young and old, would get together and celebrate. The under
graduates are expected to attend the luncheon tomorrow and sit right
along side of the graduates, and eat, drink '(water), and be merry to
gether. The students are expected to dance side by side in the Basketbalf
Pavilion. The old and young are expected to cheer in unison at the track
meet, the baseball game, and the tennis matches.
The undergraduates* cars on the campus have been stamped with
"Alumni Hop In" stickers. These posters are not decorations; they are
invitations to every Stanford man and woman. If you can prove you
ever "Made Checks Payable to Stanford University" you can enjoy free
taxi service tomorrow. It is the student's chance to demonstrate to alumni
that the old spirit of friendship still exists on the Stanford campus al
though freshman traditions have been put to rest underneath the red,
red sod.
And the alumni will find free beans and potato salad at all living
groups, for the fraternity houses and eating organizations have thrown
their doors open to the returning ones. The Row will stop rushing long
enough to entertain the homecomers, and what a welcome they should
get after all the practice the Greeks have had the past few weeks at
amusing the freshmen. The open house will keep the hand shake in good
shape, so the fraternities can get back into form when the fireworks start
Sunday again. The fraternities might even practice up on the graduate
and show him the new plaque the boys won, and the new rug in the
living room and the new cook in the kitchen.
It also appears as if it would be an All-Stanford day on the athletic
fields. Everyone is going to the track meet. Everyone is going there
expecting Stanford to win, and many are attending with the hope of
seeing one or more world's records fall tomorrow. They believe there is
no limit to how high King can jump, or to how far Hoffman can put the
shot or throw the discus, or to how fast Spencer can run the quarter
mile distance. There is likely to be a great downfall of Stanford-Cali
fornia and coast records when Templeton's men and Christie's charges
are set loose.
When the track meet is over, the crowds will "run, don't walk, to the
nearest exit," and.from there by the shortest possible route to the base
ball diamond. With Stanford and California playing the deciding baseball
game, every minute will be precious. California won Tuesday's game,
Stanford won Thursday, and it is hoped the best team will win tomorrow.
Come on, alumni, hop in with the undergraduates and forget your
worries for the day, and have a good old collegiate time.

along side of the graduates, and eat, drink '(water), and be merry to
gether. The students are expected to dance side by side in the Basketbalf
Pavilion. The old and young are expected to cheer in unison at the track
meet, the baseball game, and the tennis matches.
The undergraduates* cars on the campus have been stamped with
"Alumni Hop In" stickers. These posters are not decorations; they are
invitations to every Stanford man and woman. If you can prove you
ever "Made Checks Payable to Stanford University" you can enjoy free
taxi service tomorrow. It is the student's chance to demonstrate to alumni
that the old spirit of friendship still exists on the Stanford campus al
though freshman traditions have been put to rest underneath the red,
red sod.
And the alumni will find free beans and potato salad at all living
groups, for the fraternity houses and eating organizations have thrown
their doors open to the returning ones. The Row will stop rushing long
enough to entertain the homecomers, and what a welcome they should
get after all the practice the Greeks have had the past few weeks at
amusing the freshmen. The open house will keep the hand shake in good
shape, so the fraternities can get back into form when the fireworks start
Sunday again. The fraternities might even practice up on the graduate
and show him the new plaque the boys won, and the new rug in the
living room and the new cook in the kitchen.
It also appears as if it would be an All-Stanford day on the athletic
fields. Everyone is going to the track meet. Everyone is going there
expecting Stanford to win, and many are attending with the hope of
seeing one or more world's records fall tomorrow. They believe there is
no limit to how high King can jump, or to how far Hoffman can put the
shot or throw the discus, or to how fast Spencer can run the quarter
mile distance. There is likely to be a great downfall of Stanford-Cali
fornia and coast records when Templeton's men and Christie's charges
are set loose.
When the track meet is over, the crowds will "run, don't walk, to the
nearest exit," and.from there by the shortest possible route to the base
ball diamond. With Stanford and California playing the deciding baseball
game, every minute will be precious. California won Tuesday's game,
Stanford won Thursday, and it is hoped the best team will win tomorrow.
Come on, alumni, hop in with the undergraduates and forget your
worries for the day, and have a good old collegiate time.
So they decided to call tomorrow All-Stanford Day. It used to be
known as Homecoming Day, and later as Alumni Day, but this year it
was thought better to set aside one day at which time all Stanford men
and women, young and old, would get together and celebrate. The under
graduates are expected to attend the luncheon tomorrow and sit right
along side of the graduates, and eat, drink '(water), and be merry to
gether. The students are expected to dance side by side in the Basketbalf
Pavilion. The old and young are expected to cheer in unison at the track
meet, the baseball game, and the tennis matches.
