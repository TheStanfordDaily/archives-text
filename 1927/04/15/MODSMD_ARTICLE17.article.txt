The following telegram was received yesterday from The Oregon
Emerald, student paper at the University of Oregon:
"Editor Stanford Daily:
" i he Associated Students of the University of Oregon are
fostering a constitutional amendment making the Daily Editor
submit his editorial policies to final judgment of Publication
Committee which is appointed by the student body president.
Editorials must be submitted to the student'president for ap
proval to prevent disagreements. The matter is an outgrowth of
editorial criticism of council's acts. Please wire your opinion of
the situation."
It appears that some overly zealous student body president at Oregon
has the ambition to become a newspaper man, or at least not to have his
other political designs destroyed by the press. This so often happens when
a young man, who has been successful in politics in college, believes
himself capablc of running the entire university with his mighty hand.
But in most cases what does the student body president know about the
intricate problems of a publication? He probably has heard of galleys,
cms, linotype machines, and type lice, and that is about the extent of his
knowledge. Yet he wants to dictate the policy of the newspaper.
The editor of the Oregon Emerald is fighting for his rights; he is
fighting for his liberty; he is fighting for free speech. May lie have
success! If he wins his fight his next duty is to write an editorial criti
cizing the student body president.
