# BATTERED PLATTER USED BY BIFF HAS TAKEN LONG RIDES
## 
### 
Two worlcTs records, a trip to
the Olympic games, the Pacific
Coast Conference record, an 1.C.4A
record, an N.C.A. championship, a
National A.A.U. Junior record, a
Stanford-California record, a Stan
ford-U.S.C. record, and, latest, the
Stanford-California freshman rec
ord, are a few of the feats accred
ited to a battered old discus belong
ing to BifT Hoffman, varsity weight
thrower. These facts were brought
to light Tuesday when Eric Krenz
established a new record with it at
the freshman meet in Berkeley.
Originally used at Petaluma High
School by Hoffman, the discus,
which has a "P.H.S." carved on it,
has been in use for eight years of
record-breaking acheievements by
Biff. With it he has established
records, major and minor, scholastic
and collcgiate, too numerous to de
tail. It was a favorite of Ilart
ranft when the big blond attended
Stanford and helped him to a
world's record, though it balanced
this by breaking that record under
the guidance of Bud Houser last
year.
