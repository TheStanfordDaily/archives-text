PRINCETON AND THE
PETTICOAT

To those of us who formed our im
pressions of the undergraduate life of
Princcton University after reading F.
Scott Fitzgerald's "This Side of Para
dise'' recent news dispatches from old
Nassau are rather disturbing.
First, Dean Gauss prohibited the use
of automobiles. Next, someone (al
leged to have been Dean Gauss), on the
evening of the Junior Prom, instituted
raids on every known still within walk
ing distance of the campus. And then
the final blow in the form of an an
nouncement that Princeton had ac
cepted twenty millions of dollars from
the estate of the late Hetty Green, to
be used for the inauguration of co-edu
cation.
* * *
It is a sad day when the Princeton
undergraduate, traditionally carefree,
red-blooded and thoroughly masculine,
after having been deprived of his liquor
and his automobile, has the sacred pre
cincts of his campus profaned by the

I strange presence of eo-cds.
The tragedy may be attributed to the
i cruel circumstance that persons with a
proper regard for that happy combina
tion of drinking and song and sport
rarely amass a fortune of twenty mil
lions of dollars.
♦ * *
THE OLD GRAD
On Saturday the alumni return to see
the Big Meet and to try and resurrect
i something of the spirit of undergradu
; ate days. .
It is a fine tribute to college life that
men and women who have been out in
i the world so often return and try to live
j over again the years they spent in col
| lege. It is true that life on the Stanford
j campus is a much more endurable in
| stitution as a general thing than life
jin the world after graduation. One
| should try and remember this when the
| old grad returns and becomes misty
eyed as he gives the present generation
a perhaps elaborated account of his
; own college days.
