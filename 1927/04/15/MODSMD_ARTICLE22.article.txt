Lord of Himself. By Percy Marks :
Century.
Carl Peters, roommate of Hugh Carver,
who was the center of interest in Percy
Marks' "The Plastic Age," takes the lead
ing role in Mr. Marks' sequel to that
novel, "Lord of Himself."
Carl had a streak of common up his
back a yard wide and he knew it, though
he was smart; but it was his intelligence
that prevented him from being vulgar.
His mother, Ellen, an uncducated carpen
ter's daughter, also exerted an influence
over Carl, to the extent that he became
depressed after participating in two or
three wdd parties so common to his as
sociates.
"Lord of Himself" takes up the lives
of the group of "wild young people" five
years after the period of "The Plastic
Age." Cynthia, heartbroken, tells Carl
when he tries to philander: "I've played
hell with myself. I petted with just one
fellow too many. ... I made a mess of
something beautiful." She confesses that
she enjoys petting parties, and that if
Carl insists she will permit it, but that
from then on they are to be strangers.
Cynthia wins her point and Carl discovers
that he loves her.
The death of Ellen Peters leaves Carl
wholly at a loss because of his dependence
on her, though he is successful in busi
ness. Through pity, Cynthia offers to be
come Carl's wife, but knowing that she
does not love him sufficiently, he refuses
to permit her to make the sacrifice.
The outcome of the whole affair is
that Carl emerges from his quandary with
the following resolution: "I'm doing what
I feel is right. If I am common, I'm
common — and that's all there is to it.
I'm through with taboos. And I'm
through with social folderol, too. I've got
my friends and nobody can tell tne that
they aren't as fine as they are made.
I've got work that I like. I know where
I am going."
Percy Marks has injected into "Lord
of Himself" more than a mere interpre
tation of these "wild young people." He

has an insight into the psychology of this
younger set so much in the public eye
today. And he has spun a somewhat
tragic romance along with the customary
mother-love theme brought up to date.
Whatever "Lord of Himself" lacks, it
cannot be charged against Mr. Marks
that he has failed to weave an attractive
and readable story—especially for those
who are interested in the so-called psy
chology of young people who drink gin,
dance, and take part in necking parties.

that prevented him from being vulgar.
His mother, Ellen, an uncducated carpen
ter's daughter, also exerted an influence
over Carl, to the extent that he became
depressed after participating in two or
three wdd parties so common to his as
sociates.
"Lord of Himself" takes up the lives
of the group of "wild young people" five
years after the period of "The Plastic
Age." Cynthia, heartbroken, tells Carl
when he tries to philander: "I've played
hell with myself. I petted with just one
fellow too many. ... I made a mess of
something beautiful." She confesses that
she enjoys petting parties, and that if
Carl insists she will permit it, but that
from then on they are to be strangers.
Cynthia wins her point and Carl discovers
that he loves her.
The death of Ellen Peters leaves Carl
wholly at a loss because of his dependence
on her, though he is successful in busi
ness. Through pity, Cynthia offers to be
come Carl's wife, but knowing that she
does not love him sufficiently, he refuses
to permit her to make the sacrifice.
The outcome of the whole affair is
that Carl emerges from his quandary with
the following resolution: "I'm doing what
I feel is right. If I am common, I'm
common — and that's all there is to it.
I'm through with taboos. And I'm
through with social folderol, too. I've got
my friends and nobody can tell tne that
they aren't as fine as they are made.
I've got work that I like. I know where
I am going."
Percy Marks has injected into "Lord
of Himself" more than a mere interpre
tation of these "wild young people." He

has an insight into the psychology of this
younger set so much in the public eye
today. And he has spun a somewhat
tragic romance along with the customary
mother-love theme brought up to date.
Whatever "Lord of Himself" lacks, it
cannot be charged against Mr. Marks
that he has failed to weave an attractive
and readable story—especially for those
who are interested in the so-called psy
chology of young people who drink gin,
dance, and take part in necking parties.
