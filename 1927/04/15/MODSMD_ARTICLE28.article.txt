The Pliys Ed department will give
grades this quarter. Thus it befell:
Ist tennisser—Get an "A" today ?
2nd—Naw, the sun was shining in my
eyes that last set —I only got a "C."

Bargain Day
You want to take Biology?
Well, friend, here is the dope.
Don't draw what you see
In the bloomin' microscope.
Draw what the others draw
—Perhaps you'll get an "A."
The honor system's obsolete
—Just let your conscience pay.

Hermann Schultz, a transfer from Hei
delberg, observed that the daters of La
gunita had dropped two feet in the last
week. In a fever of excitement he wrote
a 46-verse "Ode to a Leak in the Lake
Bottom." A fragment of the master
piece is here published.
The pollywog
In Lagunita
Has a joyous time.
He wriggles his plump body,
In oozy, slipp'ry slime.
He'd better hurry now
And grow two sets of legs
For the lake will soon be down
To slimy, gooey dregs.

Cinderella Back Jlome
Ist Frosh Woman—Where you going
to eat dinner tonight?
2nd F-W —In "B" dining hall, dar-r-n-n
it!

Omar, Jr.
Some go to the "Libe"
To study books
And others to study—well, legs.
I don't know which
Is better—perhaps
A little of both.

Southern California football team now
uses airplane linen for suits.
Probably to make nose dives and tail
spins come natural.
