# SENIORS OBLIGED TO BOW TO FRESHMEN IN WATER POLO CONTEST
## 
### 
The class of 1927 was forced to bow
to the freshmen yesterday when the year
ling water polo team won a 2 to 1 victory
over the seniors. The freshmen scored
one goal in each half, while the seniors
made their tally just in time to save them
selves from a shut-out.
Reg Harrison was the outstanding man
on the victorious team, playing a fast
game at forward. He made the ball first
at the tip-off every time except the first,
when Bob Williams, of the seniors, beat
him by a yard. Both of the freshman
points were due to his clever throws.
Kinkead and Driggs, the other babe for
wards, were slower than Harrison in of
fensive, but they were excellent at guard
ing.
Hobdy Breaks Up Plays
Hobdy, giant freshman guard, consis- j
tently broke up senior plays, and tried '
throws for goal from nearly the middle I
of the pool. He was always able to stop
any dribbling on the part of the upper j
classmen, and his passes were accurate. I
Peters, another freshman guard, stopped!
senior scores twice when lie sneaked up j
in back of '27 forwards and broke up!
their plays.
Both Thornton for the freshmen and
Brooks and Poulson for the seniors played
well at goal guard. Thornton saved the
day for the babes many times when lie
stopped throws for the goal.
Christensen Makes Try
Christensen made the lone point for the
seniors, and was probably their best for-!
ward. Smith, who helped make the '27 :
score by dribbling the ball the length of !
the pool, and Stewart made themselves '
evident. Captain William â€¢ was the fastest j
man on the team, giving Harrison all the
competition he could stand. Graham
played a clever game, as did Stevenson,
who was later replaced by Brooks.
