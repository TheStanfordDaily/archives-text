# PRINCETON INSTITUTES PRECEPTORIAL SYSTEM
## 
### 
Princeton has recently instituted the ]
preceptorial system of study which is
similar to the tutorial system now used
at Oxford. Under this arrangement each
professor gives one general lecture course
of about two hours each week and de- ;
votes about six hours with a small group '
of about fifteen or twenty students to dis
cussion of the subject. Every professor j
is also a preceptor. This system has been
confined to junior and senior year courses I
primarily as it has proved too expensive ,
for under-class use.
