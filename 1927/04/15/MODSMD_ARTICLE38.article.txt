"Americans and Englishmen try too
much to distinguish between American
j and English literature," Francis Brett
| Young, noted English author, declared
! in a recent interview in the Harvard
i Crimson. "Actually, there is little dis- \
j tinction, for we are of the same blood
i and speak and think alike. To expect
I that the mere signing of the Declara
tion of Independence would change
I the whole spirit of a nation is foolish.
S "The literature of the two nations is
one," Mr. Young insisted. "Sherwood
Anderson, for instance, I consider just
! as much an English novelist as I do
1 myself an American. I have just as |
! many readers on this side of the Atlan
i tic as abroad. There is not as much 1
| difference between us as people like
' to believe. Why, you even try to main
| tain that your Babbitts are an exclu
i sively American product, but we have j
1 lots of them."
