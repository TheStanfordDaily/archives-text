# REPORT SHOWS THAT COLLEGE TOWNS LEAD IN MILK CONSUMPTION
## 
### 
More milk is consumed in Palo Alto
and Berkeley per capita than in any other
part of the state, citcs a report of the
California Dairy Council.
Sam 11. Green, secretary-manager of
the California Dairy Council, attributes
the large consumption of milk in college
communities to the fact that college stu
dents have a penchant for malted milks,
ice creams, and milk shakes, and that
the purchase of these foods necessarily
increases materially the use of milk.
Stanford students and others living in
Palo Alto during 1926 consumed on an
average 1.35 pints of milk per person daily!
while Berkeley is second in the state with
1.25 pints.
Over 200 gallons of milk per day is
provided for the 750 men and women
eating at the Encina and Roble dining j
halls, says Miss Etta Handy, director of I
the Stanford dining halls. Tea and coffee j
arc not even close seconds she avers.
