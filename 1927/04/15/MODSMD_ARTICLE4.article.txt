### Edwin Randol 
After winning yesterday's game,
the Stanford baseball team is tied
with California in the three-game
series, California having won the
first contest. The third and decid
ing game will be played after the
Big Meet tomorrow afternoon in
the sunken diamond, just south of
the stadium.
After fighting the California base- j
ball team for sixteen innings, the Stan- j
ford varsity nine broke through Jacob
sen's delivery for five runs and de
feated the Bears in the Second game
of the annual series by a score of
9 to 4. The game was the most sensa
tional contest ever seen at West Field
in Berkeley, and was witnessed by a
crowd of several hundred spectators.
Stanford started its scoring in the
second inning when Busch doubled to
center and scored on Nissen's single.
Two more tallies were added in the
sixth, Cook Sypher driving the ball
out of the lot for a home run, scoring
Busch ahead of him. Harder brought
in the fourth Stanford score in the
next inning with another home run
down the first base line.
Sobieski Blanks Bears
Sobieski held the California squad
| scoreless until the eighth, when he
I momentarily weakened and allowed
i four singles. An error by Garibaldi
i also allowed a run, and at the end of
! the inning the score was tied at 4 to 4.
; Coach Carl Zamloch showed good
! judgment, sending in three pinch-hit
j ters, all of whom delivered.
For seven more innings Jacobsen
and Sobieski battled, neither giving
ground until the former finally blew
up in the first of the sixteenth. Stew
j art started the rally by drawing a base
on balls, and when Maguiro, Busch,
i and Garibaldi, Sypher, Nissen, and
1 Rogers followed with singles in rapid
succession, five Stanford tallies were
1 rung up, and the Cardinals had the
game sewed up.
Fighting to even the annual series,
i the entire Stanford team played sen
\ sational ball. Jimmy Busch at short
| stop was the outstanding star of the
| contest, while the Cardinal outfield

managed to stumble over the rough
outfield at West Field to save many
long hits by making pretty catches of
hard-hit balls.
Jacobsen, sophomore pitcher for
California, pitched an excellent game
until the final inning, although he al
lowed fourteen hits. Sobieski struck
out thirteen men during the game.
Record Crowd Expected
With the series evened, a record
breaking crowd is expected for the
final and deciding game at Stanford
Saturday afternoon. The Stanford
squad will rest this afternoon in pre
paration for tomorrow's contest. Cap
tain Steve Collins will be called upon
to pitch, with Bob Philippi acting as
relief man, according to Coach Harry
Wolter. The game will start immedi
ately after the Big Meet.

California 4 10 3
Stanford 9 14 3
