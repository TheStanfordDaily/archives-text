## 
### 
"Spring football practicc should be |
abolished," Coach John J. McEwan, of!
the University of Oregon, has stated, j
"Under the present system, too much im- j
portance is placed upon football, and lim- |
iting it to the fall season would overcome I
any objections regarding the over-cmpha- j
sis of the sport."
Instead of spring practice, Coach Mc- j
Ewan suggested that in the interests of
scholarship and safety of players, fall i
practice be extended, starting on Septem-1
her 5, ten days earlier than the present
conference ruling allows. Even a week
earlier would be of benefit.
Except for an opportunity to outline !
fundamentals and give the coach a view
of the qualities of new material, McEwan
claimed that the evils outweigh the ad
vantages of spring practicc. "Football in
the colleges should he a game, not a busi- ■
ness," McEwan concluded. "Let's keep
it so, by eliminating the tendency of over
stressing its importance."
