# ROLLER SKATING NEW SPORT FOR SORORITY WOMEN IN MINNESOTA
## 
### 
Roller skating has been inaugurated !
as the new collegiate spring sport by
sororities' at the University of Minnc-:
sota. Urgent requests have been made
for fraternities to pave their driveways
with smooth cement, and for the city to |
improve the sidewalks and streets.
''The principles which arc involved in
the art," state members of Kappa Kappa ;
Gamma, most faithful followers of the |
new "art," "is that of putting one foot
ahead of the other, pushing so as to
generate motion, and consequently cov- j
ering territory, and at the same time in-1
dulging in glorious exercise."
Offering competition to the roller
skating craze, the Gamma Phis are j
planning to start scootering. A promi
nent member of that sorority states, "If
one should fall while scootering, the
sidewalk is that much nearer to the
essary to be expended in order to set
rider; again the amount of energy ncc- j
one in motion is comparatively small,
and finally, the smooth condition of the
sidewalks and streets is not of such j
vital importance in scootering as it is
in roller skating!
