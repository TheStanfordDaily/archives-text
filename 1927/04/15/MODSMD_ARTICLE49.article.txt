## 
### 
An exploding shell in the magazine |
of the automatic pistol he was firing
caused the injuries sustained by Ed
mund Jones Wednesday while he was
engaged in target practice held by the
Military department. The right side of
his face and his eye were burned by
powder, and the ejected shell caused
an abrasion on his nose. Jones was j
treated at the Palo Alto Hospital
where it was stated that the injury is '
slight.
Major Geary, who was instructing!
the class in pistol firing, said that the j
accident was unique in so far as he j
knew. However the entire lot of shells ;
from which the defective one was
taken will be confiscated to prevent
recurrence of the accident.
