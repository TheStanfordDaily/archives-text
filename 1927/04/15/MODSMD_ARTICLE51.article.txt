# CHRISTIE EXPECTS RECORDS TO FALL
## 
### (By Ed Salgrath, Daily Californian 
Faced with the prospects of meeting one of the
best teams in the nation, but nevertheless possessing
j an outside chance to win, the California track team
will meet Stanford tomorrow afternoon at 1:45
o'clock in the Cardinal stadium. The performances
of the men on both teams have been exceptional in
the meets so far this year, and if the day is good,
an unprecedented number of records may fall.
Evidently Coaches Christie of California and Tera
pleton of Stanford are planning a number of sur
prises, for they are very close-mouthed as to which
events the various men will run. Among the possi
bilities of this sort is that E. Spencer will run in
either the 220-yard dash, or the hurdles in addition
to running the quarter mile, that "Skinny" Johnson
of California may be able to run the low hurdles, or
that Schwobeda may run in either the half or two
mile events.
While Coach Christie refuses to definitely name
the three men who will enter each of the events

it is prac-
I tically certain that
j no one who stands a
chance of competing
has been omitted i
from the following
list of eligible com
petitors:
Baily, broad jump; i
Baxter, Benzinger,;
and Thompson, jave
lin; Bliss, high hur
dles; Boyden, S80; i
Carlson, high jump;
Carter, 880 and mile;
Cherry, 880 ; Enos, !
low and high hur- 1
dies; Ewing, dashes;
Fitz, high jump;
Gerken, weights; Gi
guiere, dashes and
440; Hampton, high

jump, broad jump, and high hurdles;
Hill, Matthews, Lutz, and Shaw, pole
vault; Jackson, two mile; Johnson, j
440; Keil, dashes; Levy, weights;
Marcus, broad jump; O'Neill, 440;
Phillips, weights; Ragan, low and
high hurdles; Schwobeda, mile; Se
gure, broad jump; Smith and Stevens,
two mile; Talbot, 440; Ulsh, low and
high hurdles; Vantress, 440; Watkins,
