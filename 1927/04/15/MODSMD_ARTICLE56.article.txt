# CARDINAL GOLFERS FAVORED AGAINST CALIFORNIA SQUAD
## Thomas Only Consistent Man on Bear Squad; To Meet Eddie Meyberg 
### 
For the first time since dual golf
matches have been played between
Stanford and California, the Cardinal
golfers will enter as heavy favorites.
The matches will be played next i ues
day morning at 9:30 o'clock and after
noon at 1:30 o'clock at the Beresford
Country Club.
Weakened by the graduation of Cap
tain Jack Nounan and Scotty "I ait, first
and second men on last year s team, the
Bears have failed to show a great deal
of strength in any of the tournaments
in which they have participated. Cap
tain Lloyd Thomas is the only man who
lias been playing good golf with any
degree of consistency. In 1925 he was
runner-up in the California Intercol
legiate Championship.
Felton Turner, Ben Rucker, Jack
Dalzel ,and Fred Ehrman are also cap
able of playing excellent golf and should
they be right may give the Cardinals a
great deal of trouble.
Meyberg Star
Eddie Meyberg, present California
Intercollegiate Champion, is the ace of
the Stanford team and will play Captain
Lloyd Thomas in the feature match. If
Meyberg is playing up to form, he
ought to have little difficulty in dispos
ing of the California captain .
Dick Lang, last year's captain, has
won his match for three years and is
out to make it four straight. Lang has
been playing both good and bad golf
this year, but his familiarity with the
Beresford course should bring him a
victory. Captain Bob Vermilya, after
playing rather mediocre golf in the
early part of the season, has at last
started to play the golf of which he is
capable.
Sophomores Play
Ward Edmonds, Robert Syer, and
Herbert Fleischhacker will probably be
the remaining three men on the team.
They all have come up from last year's
freshmen and played excellent golf in
the recent Intercollegiate Champion
ship at Pebble Beach. Fleischhacker
won the qualifying round, while Ed
monds and Syer were both semi
finalists.
Doug White, a transfer, has been
fighting it out with Fleischhacker for
the last place on the team, and will
probably take the latter's place in the
doubles matches in the afternoon.
