# PALO ALTO POLICE SHOW HIGH MEDIAN IN MENTAL TESTS
## 
### 
Policemen of Palo Alto have a
higher intelligence median than col
lege freshmen or army officers, is the
conclusion based on a survey of the
Police Department made by Miss
Maude Amanda Merrill, associate pro
fessor of psychology.
While college freshmen have a rat
ing of 129, the police officers average
136.5 on the army Alpha tests. As the
two-year period, during which the tests
were given, progressed, the police
median went up to 143.5 with the em
ployment of new men. These thirty
men, chosen to fill vacancies, had been
working in trades, and it was expected
that scores of lower intelligence levels
would result. Seven had been police
men before the new system was
started; four had been doing clerical
work; three were mechanics; and the
rest ranged from day laborers to fed
eral prohibition agents.
Besides rating the men on intelli
gence, Chief Zink had interviews with
the candidates and selected them ac
cording to experience, personality, and
appearance. After one year he again
rated the men according to appear
ance, discipline, efficiency, and moral
qualities.
