# A 						RÁCE RICE IN ROMANCE
## 
### Feg Murray 
Among the entries in the thirty-first I
annual Patriot's Day Marathon to be
run next Tuesday from Hopkinton to
Boston, Mass., will be a former four
time winner of the event, Clarence De
Mar, a forty-year-old Sunday-school
teacher of Melrose, and Johnny Miles,
a 19-year-old boy from Sidney Mines,
Nova Scotia. Youth beat age last April
nineteenth, for Johnny finished first, j
defeating Albin Stenroos of Finland, |
the 40-year-old Olympic champion, and
De Mar, setting a new world's record
for the distance of 2 hours, 25 min
utes, 40 and 2-5 seconds. "Chuck"
Mellor, of the Illinois Athletic Club,
won the 1925 race, and in 1924 De Mar
set a world's record of 2.29:40 1-5.
This quaint custom of running 26 j
miles, 385 yards is not a new one; in ]

fact, it is 2417 years old. Pheidippides,
a champion runner of antiquity,
started it all, and there is no race in
the history of athletics that is so
steeped in tradition or so rich in ro
mance. There is plenty of drama and
inspiration in Plieidippedes' death, as
he gasped out the two Greek words
meaning "Rejoice! We have con
quered!" or in the miraculous victory
of S. Loues, the Attic farmer who won
the Marathon race over the identical
course on which Pheidippedes ran, in
the first of the modern Olympics in
1896.
The Greeks of today, as every one
knows, are not the athletes that their
ancestors of the Golden Age were, and
as each day of the IS9G games passed
without a victory for any of his coun-

Itrymen, young Loues took it very much
' to heart. While he had never competed
in a race in his life, he was in superb
physical condition, thanks to the out
j door life he had led, and because he
had sometimes carried dispatches over
the neighboring hills. At any rate, his
last minute entry into the race, and
his victory for his country, proved that
a lack of training and experience may
sometimes be overcome by an uncon
querable spirit and a deep patriotic
and religious fervor.
The Athenians in the stadium sang
and wept with joy as Loues staggered
in a victor in the only modern Olympic
Marathon race ever won by a Greek.
The King embraced him and assisted
him to his dressing room, and later
■ made him a member of his own per

sonal bodyguard. He was everywhere
hailed as the savior of the honor of
Greece. It is one of the most remark
able feats in all sports history.

defeating Albin Stenroos of Finland, |
the 40-year-old Olympic champion, and
De Mar, setting a new world's record
for the distance of 2 hours, 25 min
utes, 40 and 2-5 seconds. "Chuck"
Mellor, of the Illinois Athletic Club,
won the 1925 race, and in 1924 De Mar
set a world's record of 2.29:40 1-5.
This quaint custom of running 26 j
miles, 385 yards is not a new one; in ]

fact, it is 2417 years old. Pheidippides,
a champion runner of antiquity,
started it all, and there is no race in
the history of athletics that is so
steeped in tradition or so rich in ro
mance. There is plenty of drama and
inspiration in Plieidippedes' death, as
he gasped out the two Greek words
meaning "Rejoice! We have con
quered!" or in the miraculous victory
of S. Loues, the Attic farmer who won
the Marathon race over the identical
course on which Pheidippedes ran, in
the first of the modern Olympics in
1896.
The Greeks of today, as every one
knows, are not the athletes that their
ancestors of the Golden Age were, and
as each day of the IS9G games passed
without a victory for any of his coun-

Itrymen, young Loues took it very much
' to heart. While he had never competed
in a race in his life, he was in superb
physical condition, thanks to the out
j door life he had led, and because he
had sometimes carried dispatches over
the neighboring hills. At any rate, his
last minute entry into the race, and
his victory for his country, proved that
a lack of training and experience may
sometimes be overcome by an uncon
querable spirit and a deep patriotic
and religious fervor.
The Athenians in the stadium sang
and wept with joy as Loues staggered
in a victor in the only modern Olympic
Marathon race ever won by a Greek.
The King embraced him and assisted
him to his dressing room, and later
■ made him a member of his own per

sonal bodyguard. He was everywhere
hailed as the savior of the honor of
Greece. It is one of the most remark
able feats in all sports history.
