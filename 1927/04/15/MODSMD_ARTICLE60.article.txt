# EDWARDS, PYLE SAY 'PRO' FOOTBALL HAS BEEN UNPROFITABLE
## 
### 
Big Bill Edwards, czar of profession
al football, and C. C. Pyle, promoter
of Red Grange, Suzanne Lenglen, and
other athletic luminaries, have admit
ted that the professional gridiron
sport, as far as they are concerned, is
about to go on the rocks.
Continued bad weather upset the
American Professional Football league
last fall. Grange's New York Giants,
in which Pyle is interested, failed as a
money-making proposition.
The college spirit is lacking in pro
fessional games, both in the bleachers
and field. The only other inducement,
that of seeing stars of past years in
action, has not proved sufficient in
more than a few cases to bring out
the howling, cheering mobs that at
tend the college games.
Edwards' plan was to provide the
people without college affiliations an
opportunity to see high-class games.
The project has not worked out and
he is now sure that it is only the
college game that interests the fans.
The one salvation of the professional
game is the limiting of the season to
a fixed number of games and deciding
the winner of each league by the num
ber of games won.
