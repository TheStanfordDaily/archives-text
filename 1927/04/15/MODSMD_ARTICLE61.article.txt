EMORY UNIVERSITY, Ga., April
j 12. â€”Because he failed to make a pass
ing grade in English, L. T. Poe, 60-
l year-old school teacher-student, has
| filed suit against Emory University
for recovery of $25 representing ma
triculation and course fees in the col
lege extension department.
He was unable to hear the instruc
tors distinctly during their lectures,
he averred, and his failure to make a
passing grade partly prevented him
from obtaining a teacher's certificate
in Kentucky.
Two law students of the university
j will represent the school in the litiga
j tion, the first of its kind on record
; here.
