# OREGON INAUGURATES NEW UNDERGRADUATE SYSTEM NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
Radical educational reforms have just
been announced at the University of
Oregon as a result of student protest
against the existing system. Student
and faculty committees have agreed
upon a new plan which will be inaugu
rated next fall, and by which it is hoped
to eliminate the poor students and to
stimulate the capable. Specific changes
will be made in the present educational
scheme.

The four-year college course will be
I divided into two units of two years
I each, including a junior college for
| freshmen and suphumores. Believing
| that high schools do not train their
students for real university work, the
student plan provides for this introduc
tory schooling. The granting of a cer
tificate at the end of the first two years
will sift the registrants, and it is sup
posed that those who continue will be
better able to do high caliber work be
cause of the intermediate training.
; 1 hose persons who are not desirous or
j capable of pursuing their education fur-
J tlier will be dropped at this stage.
