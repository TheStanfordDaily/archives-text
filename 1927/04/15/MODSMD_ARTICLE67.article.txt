# STANFORD CULINARY DEPARTMENT THIRD IN U.S. STUDIES DON'T INTERFERE WITH FOOOD PROBLEM UNIVERSITY CONTROLS CAMPUS DINING HALLS
## 
### John Rogers 
College students cannot subsist upon
food for thought alone ,and one of the
most active and essential, as well as one
u\ the most talked of, departments of
the University is the one that dispenses
jthc staff of life for those who have the
Strength to carry on the pursuit of
knowledge. For while most collegians
jdo not let studies interfere with their
pleasure, they all now and then must
e<it.
In actual point of size the food dis
pensing department at Stanford is third
among the universities of the United
States, the one at Chicago University
being the largest and that at Simons
C ollege in Boston coming second.
Instituted by Roth
The idea of such a department at
Stanford had its beginnings several
3 ears ago when the present comptroller,
Ahnon E. Roth, '00, used to have to
tf ivcl the miles to Mayfield whenever
lie felt the gnawing pangs of hunger.
His gastronomic longings generated a
dieain of there being sometime on the
campus, wtihin the reach of all students,
an abundance of good, hot, wholesome
food. When he became Comptroller lie
did not forget the long, hungry walks
<o> his youth.
At that time there? were several pri
vately owned lunch counters and eat
ing places under various stages of mis
management on the campus, but it
seemed to Roth that all dining halls and
fciores should be under one central man
agement run at cost and in co-operation
.with the students.
Planned by Handy
In 1921 he asked Miss Etta Handy, a
graduate of Simons College and a
ti.tined dietician, to look over the situa
tion at the University, study the ways
in which the dining-hall problem bad
been met at other educational institu
tions, and to work out a feasible plan
for Stanford. The old Stanford tradi
tion centered around the idea that fac
ulty and students would all live on the
ouiipus with something of a general
family life. With this in mind Miss
.Handy has devoted a great deal of time
and study to preserving the informal
home-like and democratic idea which
was so inseparably a part of the early
Stanford life, and at the same time to
meeting the demands created by the
growth of the University.
rhe University dining halls are di
vided into three groups, with a director

who is responsible to Miss Handy over
each group. About one-third of the
3,000 students come under the direct
jurisdiction of this department. The
Stanford Union is the largest of the di
visions. Besides the a la carte dining
room that serves an average of 175
meals daily and the cafeteria that aver
ages 525 meals a day, there are two
stores under its jurisdiction—the "Cel
lar," with professional, unhurried wait
resses, where students may safely hi
bernate during the bitter winter even
ings, and "Roughs' Roost," the quick
lunch store.
Students Make Money
Besides the student orchestra of four
members, 110 of the 200 employees of
the Union are students. In fact, $3,500
a month in food and cash goes to these
student workers. The ice cream plant,
which turns out 60 gallons of many
varieties of ice cream a day, is also lo
cated in the Union building.
Miss Hilda Longyear, as assistant
director of Encina Commons—the much
maligned restaurant of the freshmen—
plans the meals and sends in purchas
ing orders to Miss Handy for eight
dining rooms. Four of the rooms are
devoted to eating clubs, and the other
four harbor the 550 babes. This divis
ion also supports the store, stiuated in
the basement of Encina Hall, where the
studious and not-so-studious forsake
the midnight oil for hot coffee and choc
malts.
Roble Hall, the third division, is di
rected by Miss Katherinc E. Lees. It
has two dining rooms, each accommo
dating about 100 girls, with tables
serving eight. Two hashers wait on
three tables, and as there are men and
women hashers in about equal numbers,
each woman has a man for a partner,
which seems to add considerably to the
gaiety of the work. The Roble store—
the "Hole"—is a little niche in the base
ment.
Responsible to Roth
Miss Handy is directly responsible in
her work to the Comptroller, who in
turn is responsible to the President.
Roth, Miss Handy, and her three as
sistants are ex-officio members of the
student communities, elected by the dif
ferent halls, which hold regular meet
ings to determine the rate of board and
all general policies of the halls, and
which are responsible for all questions
of discipline. Roth has veto power over
any decisions of these student commit
tees.

members, 110 of the 200 employees of
the Union are students. In fact, $3,500
a month in food and cash goes to these
student workers. The ice cream plant,
which turns out 60 gallons of many
varieties of ice cream a day, is also lo
cated in the Union building.
Miss Hilda Longyear, as assistant
director of Encina Commons—the much
maligned restaurant of the freshmen—
plans the meals and sends in purchas
ing orders to Miss Handy for eight
dining rooms. Four of the rooms are
devoted to eating clubs, and the other
four harbor the 550 babes. This divis
ion also supports the store, stiuated in
the basement of Encina Hall, where the
studious and not-so-studious forsake
the midnight oil for hot coffee and choc
malts.
Roble Hall, the third division, is di
rected by Miss Katherinc E. Lees. It
has two dining rooms, each accommo
dating about 100 girls, with tables
serving eight. Two hashers wait on
three tables, and as there are men and
women hashers in about equal numbers,
each woman has a man for a partner,
which seems to add considerably to the
gaiety of the work. The Roble store—
the "Hole"—is a little niche in the base
ment.
Responsible to Roth
Miss Handy is directly responsible in
her work to the Comptroller, who in
turn is responsible to the President.
Roth, Miss Handy, and her three as
sistants are ex-officio members of the
student communities, elected by the dif
ferent halls, which hold regular meet
ings to determine the rate of board and
all general policies of the halls, and
which are responsible for all questions
of discipline. Roth has veto power over
any decisions of these student commit
tees.
College students cannot subsist upon
food for thought alone ,and one of the
most active and essential, as well as one
u\ the most talked of, departments of
the University is the one that dispenses
jthc staff of life for those who have the
Strength to carry on the pursuit of
knowledge. For while most collegians
jdo not let studies interfere with their
pleasure, they all now and then must
e<it.
In actual point of size the food dis
pensing department at Stanford is third
among the universities of the United
States, the one at Chicago University
being the largest and that at Simons
C ollege in Boston coming second.
Instituted by Roth
The idea of such a department at
Stanford had its beginnings several
3 ears ago when the present comptroller,
Ahnon E. Roth, '00, used to have to
tf ivcl the miles to Mayfield whenever
lie felt the gnawing pangs of hunger.
His gastronomic longings generated a
dieain of there being sometime on the
campus, wtihin the reach of all students,
an abundance of good, hot, wholesome
food. When he became Comptroller lie
did not forget the long, hungry walks
<o> his youth.
At that time there? were several pri
vately owned lunch counters and eat
ing places under various stages of mis
management on the campus, but it
seemed to Roth that all dining halls and
fciores should be under one central man
agement run at cost and in co-operation
.with the students.
Planned by Handy
In 1921 he asked Miss Etta Handy, a
graduate of Simons College and a
ti.tined dietician, to look over the situa
tion at the University, study the ways
in which the dining-hall problem bad
been met at other educational institu
tions, and to work out a feasible plan
for Stanford. The old Stanford tradi
tion centered around the idea that fac
ulty and students would all live on the
ouiipus with something of a general
family life. With this in mind Miss
.Handy has devoted a great deal of time
and study to preserving the informal
home-like and democratic idea which
was so inseparably a part of the early
Stanford life, and at the same time to
meeting the demands created by the
growth of the University.
rhe University dining halls are di
vided into three groups, with a director

who is responsible to Miss Handy over
each group. About one-third of the
3,000 students come under the direct
jurisdiction of this department. The
Stanford Union is the largest of the di
visions. Besides the a la carte dining
room that serves an average of 175
meals daily and the cafeteria that aver
ages 525 meals a day, there are two
stores under its jurisdiction—the "Cel
lar," with professional, unhurried wait
resses, where students may safely hi
bernate during the bitter winter even
ings, and "Roughs' Roost," the quick
lunch store.

management on the campus, but it
seemed to Roth that all dining halls and
fciores should be under one central man
agement run at cost and in co-operation
.with the students.
Planned by Handy
In 1921 he asked Miss Etta Handy, a
graduate of Simons College and a
ti.tined dietician, to look over the situa
tion at the University, study the ways
in which the dining-hall problem bad
been met at other educational institu
tions, and to work out a feasible plan
for Stanford. The old Stanford tradi
tion centered around the idea that fac
ulty and students would all live on the
ouiipus with something of a general
family life. With this in mind Miss
.Handy has devoted a great deal of time
and study to preserving the informal
home-like and democratic idea which
was so inseparably a part of the early
Stanford life, and at the same time to
meeting the demands created by the
growth of the University.
rhe University dining halls are di
vided into three groups, with a director

who is responsible to Miss Handy over
each group. About one-third of the
3,000 students come under the direct
jurisdiction of this department. The
Stanford Union is the largest of the di
visions. Besides the a la carte dining
room that serves an average of 175
meals daily and the cafeteria that aver
ages 525 meals a day, there are two
stores under its jurisdiction—the "Cel
lar," with professional, unhurried wait
resses, where students may safely hi
bernate during the bitter winter even
ings, and "Roughs' Roost," the quick
lunch store.
Students Make Money
Besides the student orchestra of four
members, 110 of the 200 employees of
the Union are students. In fact, $3,500
a month in food and cash goes to these
student workers. The ice cream plant,
which turns out 60 gallons of many
varieties of ice cream a day, is also lo
cated in the Union building.
Miss Hilda Longyear, as assistant
director of Encina Commons—the much
maligned restaurant of the freshmen—
plans the meals and sends in purchas
ing orders to Miss Handy for eight
dining rooms. Four of the rooms are
devoted to eating clubs, and the other
four harbor the 550 babes. This divis
ion also supports the store, stiuated in
the basement of Encina Hall, where the
studious and not-so-studious forsake
the midnight oil for hot coffee and choc
malts.
Roble Hall, the third division, is di
rected by Miss Katherinc E. Lees. It
has two dining rooms, each accommo
dating about 100 girls, with tables
serving eight. Two hashers wait on
three tables, and as there are men and
women hashers in about equal numbers,
each woman has a man for a partner,
which seems to add considerably to the
gaiety of the work. The Roble store—
the "Hole"—is a little niche in the base
ment.
Responsible to Roth
Miss Handy is directly responsible in
her work to the Comptroller, who in
turn is responsible to the President.
Roth, Miss Handy, and her three as
sistants are ex-officio members of the
student communities, elected by the dif
ferent halls, which hold regular meet
ings to determine the rate of board and
all general policies of the halls, and
which are responsible for all questions
of discipline. Roth has veto power over
any decisions of these student commit
tees.
College students cannot subsist upon
food for thought alone ,and one of the
most active and essential, as well as one
u\ the most talked of, departments of
the University is the one that dispenses
jthc staff of life for those who have the
Strength to carry on the pursuit of
knowledge. For while most collegians
jdo not let studies interfere with their
pleasure, they all now and then must
e<it.
In actual point of size the food dis
pensing department at Stanford is third
among the universities of the United
States, the one at Chicago University
being the largest and that at Simons
C ollege in Boston coming second.
Instituted by Roth
The idea of such a department at
Stanford had its beginnings several
3 ears ago when the present comptroller,
Ahnon E. Roth, '00, used to have to
tf ivcl the miles to Mayfield whenever
lie felt the gnawing pangs of hunger.
His gastronomic longings generated a
dieain of there being sometime on the
campus, wtihin the reach of all students,
an abundance of good, hot, wholesome
food. When he became Comptroller lie
did not forget the long, hungry walks
<o> his youth.
At that time there? were several pri
vately owned lunch counters and eat
ing places under various stages of mis
management on the campus, but it
seemed to Roth that all dining halls and
fciores should be under one central man
agement run at cost and in co-operation
.with the students.
