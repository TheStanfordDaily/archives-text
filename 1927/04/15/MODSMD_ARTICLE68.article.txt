"Actors are born, not made," stated
Ben Lyon, film star, in a recent inter
view in the Harvard Crimson. "To be
Kure, an actor can be trained just as
an athlete can, but no matter how
well trained he may be. he is not
likely to succeed unless he has some
abilities to build on.
"The best training for the screen,"
said Mr. Lyon, "is the traveling stock
com puny. Traveling actors live a hard
life, and in every way this prepares
them for the strenuous life of the
moving picture actor."
Commenting on the plan of College
Humor and First National Pictures
Corporation, whereby thirty colleges i
will be visited in an effort to discover i
new men for the screen, Mr. Lyon l
.said, "I am in favor of the project,
but I believe it will prove quite ex
pensive. Only the experiment will de
termine its expediency. At present
there, are not many college men in
Hollywood who have advanced far as
Actors, but more are coming there
every year."
