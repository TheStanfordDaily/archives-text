# MINNESOTA MAN SAYS ADVERTISING IS CAUSE OF WOMEN'S SMOKING
## 
### 
"Increased smoking by university
womon is due to an organized cam
paign of the tobacco interests, and the
high-powered advertising being car
ried on by American cigarette com
panies is shameful," charged Professor
Anthonk Zeleny of the Physics depart
ment at the University of Minnesota,
in a recent interview in the Minnesota
Daily. Ah a leading officer of the Anti-
Tobacco League, he is making a thor
ough investigation of women's smok
ing at Minnesota.
"Tobacco companies have hired wo
men to attend other universities who
have encouraged other women to
smoke by their oxample," stated Pro
feflsor Zeleny. "The increase in wo
men's smoking at Minnesota is hard
to account for in any other women.
Educators should take a definite stand
and prohibit tobacco ads in all school
papers, because such advertising is
particularly insidious. '*
