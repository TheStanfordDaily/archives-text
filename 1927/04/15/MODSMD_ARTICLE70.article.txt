# PALO ALTO RATTLER FARM LOSES THIRTY PET VENOM-MAKERS
## 
### 
Losing thirty prize serpents, Leon
ard Keeler, a junior at Stanford, suf
fered a severe set-back. It has not
been determined whether Keeler's pets
died because of adverse climatic condi
tions or of an overdose of hamburger,
which they are fed in liberal portions
once a week in order to keep up their
venom-producing capacities.
Each week the snakes are "milked"
for their venom, which is sent to Oak
land to supply a manufacturing firm
with the basic ingredient for a rattle
snake serum.
In order to be eligible for the farm
a snake must be over five feet in
length and must have a large square
shaped head. These have the greatest
venom capacity in the fangs.
The snakes are extremely sensitive
to changes in temperature, eating very
little during the winter and spring
and feeding through the use of a stom
ach pump during these months.
Keeler penetrated the Hopi Indian
reservation in Arizona last fall in a
search for snakes, but was put out
by the Indians when they discovered
him making off with their sacred rep
tiles.
