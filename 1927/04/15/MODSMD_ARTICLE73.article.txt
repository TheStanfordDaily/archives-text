# HUNDRED YEARS AGO GRANDMOTHER SAID: "BEWARE THE GIRLS"
## 
### 
Styles in just about everything have
changed radically in the last 75 years,
hut here is some parental advice dated
Octobcr, 1853, which was sent to two
students at Alfred University, showing
that the style in this particular thing is
practically the same today as it was
long ago.
The following is part of the copy of
the letter as it recently was printed in
the Colgate Maroon:
"Dear Boys:
". . . . I wish to give you a few cau
tions. You are far from home. Your
credit depends on your behavior. You
must be careful to keep good company.
Do not associate with the rowdies if any
such be there Be careful of your
health as you have no one to look out
for you.
"You must take care of yourselves.
Do not go out in the rain and wear wet
clothes. Do not go out much evenings.
Take good care of your health. Do not
study much evenings. Set your light
behind you and it will not hurt your
eyes so much. Be careful to put on
your candle snuffer when you go to bed.
Take care of your fire in your stove.
Do not sit up late. Ask Mr. Kennoy's
(president of Alfred at that time) ad
vice when you are invited out as you
are strangers. Be careful of your
clothes. Forget not to keep your trunks
locked. You know there are all sorts
of folks in the world. Do not lose your
keys. You must take care and not burn
your boots and shoes. Be careful not
to set your curtain on fire with your
candle
"You must not neglect going to
meeting. .. . . Read your Bible. Be
good boys and you may be great
men
"My best love to you both.
"("Signed) Grandmother Sally Johnson.
"P.S Boys, look out for the
girls. Do not let them make spending
money of you; as I told you there are
all sorts of people in the world. Some
girls like to make spending money of
the boys and that is all they care for
them. Perchance, if the like of any
such are there, I want to caution you as
you are young."
