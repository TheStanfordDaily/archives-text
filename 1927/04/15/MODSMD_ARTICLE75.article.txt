## 
### 
Stanford contains more acreage in its j
campus than any other university in the
world. Extending from the San Fran-1
cisquito creek on the northwest to the
Matadero creek on the southwest, and
from the highway a distance varying
from three to six miles toward the hills, :
the holdings comprise some 8,600 acres, !
5,200 of which are rolling hills.
The original Stanford farm, as granted;
to the university, was 8,252 acres in ex-1
tent. The additions have been made !
gradually in an effort to consolidate the
holdings and to protect them from ac-,
tivities on the adjacent land detrimental!
to the welfare of the university.
A nine-acre plot of ground was pur-1
chased near Roble bridge to prevent the
continuance of a public picnic ground
there.
An area of 273 acres contiguous to '

j Seafsville lake was added a short time
ago, and another section of land amount
j ing to 124 acres in the same region was
purchased last year. In addition to
these purchases, several minor pieces
J of land were bought.
Jt was stipulated in the grant that
all the land, comprising the original
I farm, was given with a restraint against
alienation; that is, it cannot be sold.
I However, certain few pieces were sale
! able. The section in which the South
gate residential district is located was
, once part of the Stanford farm; like
: wise the property on which the Palo
I Alto high school is built belonged to
j Stanford. Much of the property be
tween the highway and the railroad be
; tween Menlo and Palo Alto belongs to
| the university. Within recent date, a
! total of sixty-four acres has been sold.
