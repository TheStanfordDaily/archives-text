"Tuition charges at universities should
be sufficient to cover the actual cost of
the courses given, without relying on a
philanthropic public," President James
Rowland Angell, of Yale University,
said recently in his annual report. "The
public will hardly respond indefinitely
to requests for added resources which
seem quite disconnected with ordinary
fiscal principles.
"It is often urged that the student
should be charged as nearly as possible
what his education costs," he ex
plained, "and there seems to be no good
reason why the student who can afford
it should not pay. But at Yale we are
wholly unwilling to enter upon the eco
nomic selection of our students which
such a course would involve if applied
immediately and rigidly to all students.
We should wish to loan funds and
scholarships sufficient to care for the
worthy self-supporting student."
College athletics were defended by
President Angell, who said in regard to
them, "The gain from wholesome sports
is so far in excess of the loss that no one
familiar with education would deny that
athletics are desirable."
