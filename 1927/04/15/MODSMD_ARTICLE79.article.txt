## URGE JUNIOR COLLEGES Guggenheim Laboratory Is Built from $195,000 Endowment Fund 
### 
The returning alumnus regards
the campus with the fond glance
bred of bygone memories. He
notices changes with the critical
eye of the doting parent; hence the
How of campus events is of great
interest to him. In view of this
fact, the following resume is sub
mitted.â€”Editor's Note.
Wants Junior Colleges
Much stir followed the address of
President Wilbur at the opening of the
two-day conference of the state depart
ment of education wherein arguments
for the establishment of junior colleges
were put forth again.
With the construction of the Daniel
Guggenheim Experimental Laboratory
of Aerodynamics and Aeronautic En
gineering on the campus, Stanford takes
its first step toward national leadership
in the field of aerodynamics. An en
dowment fund totaling $195,000, the gift
of Daniel Guggenheim, will subsidize
the laboratory.
The opening of the Ryan laboratory
for experimentation in high voltage
transmission and other highly technical
problems marked another epoch in
Stanford history. Dr. Harris J. Ryan,
director of the laboratory, produced a
ribbon of clectrciity, twenty feet long
and over two million volts in intensity,
in the laboratory last fall. This is the
highest voltage ever produced by man.
Wilbur in Orient
President Wilbur attended the third
Pan-Pacific Science Congress in Tokyo
during the fall; he is chairman of the
American group of the Institute of Pa
cific Relations. Dr. Bailey Willis, pro
fessor emeritus of geology, also at
tended the Congress.
Action has been taken toward the
realization of the new Law building on
the campus. A campaign has been
launched to raise $500,000 for the build
ing and $250,000 for the library endow
ment fund. Francis V. Keesling, '98, is
general chairman of the entire cam
paign and specific chairman for San
Francisco.
Three men having Stanford affiliations
were chosen by President Coolidge to
represent the United States at the
League of Nations' Economic Confer
ence at Geneva May 4. They are Dr.
Alomo E. Taylor, director of the Food
Research Institute, Henry M. Robin
son, chairman of the United States
delegates, and a meniber-at-large of the
Stanford National Board, and Norman
H. Davis, Under Secretary of State
during Woodrow Wilson's administra
tion and formerly a student at Stanford.
Professor West Dies
The death of Professor Victor J.
West is a severe loss to Stanford. He
was head of the Political Science De
partment since its foundation in 1919.
An arboretum ranking with the fore
most botanical gardens of the world
may be developed on the campus. The
Board of Trustees consented to set
aside one thousand acres of campus ter
ritory for such gardens if sufficient
funds arc raised and a satisfactory plan
presented to carry the project through.
Climatic and soil conditions here are
favorable to the growing of a wide
range of plants and trees.
New Bridge Planned
The old iron bridge that crosses San
Francisquito creek on the County Road
will be removed, and a new one built on
the site of the old Roblc bridge, for
merly known as Cedro bridge. The
University has ceded property to the
county of Santa Clara for a new route
to connect the new bridge with the
county road.
The will of Charles Brooker of Con
necticut bequeathed $50,000 as an en
dowment to Stanford to establish three
fellowships to the memory of Royal!
Victor his personal friend and attorney
and a Stanford graduate.
As to undergraduate activities of in
terest to alumni, two Stanford men
toured the East, debating a number of
prominent eastern universities, and won
the majority of their encounters. The
Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. have
formed a temporary combination called
the Stanford Fellowship. The Quad,
Volume XXXIII, took first place in a
national university year-book contest.
Women arc permitted by a special rul
ing to smoke in their living groups. The
Daily Palo Alto succumbs to be re
placed by the Stanford Daily. Seven
successful dramatic productions have
been staged. Chappie sponsored a
whisker contest, awarding the winner a
handsome mustache cup and ten dollars.
