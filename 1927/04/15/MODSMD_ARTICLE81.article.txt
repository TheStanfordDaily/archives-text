# GORDON DAVIS TO TRAVEL IN EAST, ABROAD FOR YEAR
## Dramatic Director Plans to Make Extended Tour of Central Europe 
### 
Gordon Davis, Director of Dramatics,
will leave next September for a year
of travel in the East and Europe for
the purpose of studying the theatre.
The trip will round out Davis' experi
ence with theatres throughout the
world, as during a year's leave in
1922-23 he toured the Orient with a
New York stock company.
The position vacated by Davis will
not be filled during his absence, but
tlie usual program of dramatic activi
ties will be carried on by the Dramatic
Council, assisted by the Theatre Work
shop under Leslie Kiler, with the aid
of a suitable director from the Bay
Region to be hired for each play.
Central Europe Goal
While abroad Davis plans to spend
most of his time in Central Europe,
where great advances are being made
in experimental and constructive thea
tre work. Berlin, Munich, Dresden,
Budapest, and especially Salzburg, the
home of Reinhart's theatre, are the
leaders of experimentation in Europe
and consequently the most valuable
and interesting places to go, declares
Davis. He is doubtful if it will be pos
sible for him to visit the home of the
Moscow Art Theatre whose company
came to New York last season, but
his itinerary includes a visit to the
theatre of Max Reinhart, well-known
producer of "The Miracle Play," in
Salzburg.
In Sicily he will be able to attend
the revival of old Greek tragedies held
in the original Greek theatre at Syra
cuse. The plays have been reintro
duced there in the true settings of
their origin, the movement being much
the same as the Shakespearean re
vival at Stratford-on-Avon. Returning
to New York some time in April he
will be there to review the season and
be on the lookout for the plays he
wishes to bring to Stanford.
Yale has a new theatre to house
Professor Baker's Graduate School of
Drama, an institution which Davis
looks forward to as a possible plan
to carry out at Stanford some day.
Cornell and Princeton also have new
playhouses of the latest construction
which are the result of the increasing
interest in the East to foster drama as
a regular college graduate study. Davis
plans to visit all these colleges.
Davis first directed plays at Stan
ford during his senior year, and since
his graduation in 1919 he has been
Director of Dramatics. During his six
seasons he has produced over fifty
shows, varying from old Greek plays,
through light comedies, to the most
modern type of play. This quarter
Davis will direct only two plays. The
first will be the Junior Opera, to be
given May 7, and the other will be
the annual Senior Farce, to be pro
duced at the close of finals week. Dur
ing summer quarter he will also con
tinue his work.

be on the lookout for the plays he
wishes to bring to Stanford.
Yale has a new theatre to house
Professor Baker's Graduate School of
Drama, an institution which Davis
looks forward to as a possible plan
to carry out at Stanford some day.
Cornell and Princeton also have new
playhouses of the latest construction
which are the result of the increasing
interest in the East to foster drama as
a regular college graduate study. Davis
plans to visit all these colleges.
Davis first directed plays at Stan
ford during his senior year, and since
his graduation in 1919 he has been
Director of Dramatics. During his six
seasons he has produced over fifty
shows, varying from old Greek plays,
through light comedies, to the most
modern type of play. This quarter
Davis will direct only two plays. The
first will be the Junior Opera, to be
given May 7, and the other will be
the annual Senior Farce, to be pro
duced at the close of finals week. Dur
ing summer quarter he will also con
tinue his work.
Gordon Davis, Director of Dramatics,
will leave next September for a year
of travel in the East and Europe for
the purpose of studying the theatre.
The trip will round out Davis' experi
ence with theatres throughout the
world, as during a year's leave in
1922-23 he toured the Orient with a
New York stock company.
The position vacated by Davis will
not be filled during his absence, but
tlie usual program of dramatic activi
ties will be carried on by the Dramatic
Council, assisted by the Theatre Work
shop under Leslie Kiler, with the aid
of a suitable director from the Bay
Region to be hired for each play.
Central Europe Goal
While abroad Davis plans to spend
most of his time in Central Europe,
where great advances are being made
in experimental and constructive thea
tre work. Berlin, Munich, Dresden,
Budapest, and especially Salzburg, the
home of Reinhart's theatre, are the
leaders of experimentation in Europe
and consequently the most valuable
and interesting places to go, declares
Davis. He is doubtful if it will be pos
sible for him to visit the home of the
Moscow Art Theatre whose company
came to New York last season, but
his itinerary includes a visit to the
theatre of Max Reinhart, well-known
producer of "The Miracle Play," in
Salzburg.
In Sicily he will be able to attend
the revival of old Greek tragedies held
in the original Greek theatre at Syra
cuse. The plays have been reintro
duced there in the true settings of
their origin, the movement being much
the same as the Shakespearean re
vival at Stratford-on-Avon. Returning
to New York some time in April he
will be there to review the season and
be on the lookout for the plays he
wishes to bring to Stanford.
