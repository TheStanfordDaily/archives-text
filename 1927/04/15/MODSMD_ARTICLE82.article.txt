# CROMWELL PLANS TO REVAMP TROJANS FOR MEET WITH STANFORD
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, 14.—Stan
ford's track victory over the Southern
California Conference all-stars has
caused Coach Dean Cromwell to
change some of his plans for the U.S.C.
meet with the Cards on April 23.
When Spencer ran the 440 in 47 4-5
seconds, and Babcock and Syer fin
ished so closely behind, that elimi
nated possibility of tho Trojans taking
any quarter-mile places, and only
Percy Wallace will be run in that
event.
McKinnon's mile and half-mile times
were both better than any Trojans
have made this year, and it looks as
though he will win both. The two-milo,
also considered a sure Trojan event,
went to llanney in tho remarkable
time of 9 minutes 56.4 seconds, which
means a Card first place in that race
The showing of Swain in the mile has
caused Cromwell to state he will run
only TTnruh in the four-lap event
against Stanford.
Inactivity caused by lack of oppo
nents during the past two weeks has
given Trojan injuries time to heal, but
has not produced needed efforts in
the various events. The final touch to
Southern California's strenuous train
ing program in preparation for tho
dual meet with Stanford will be pro
vided tomorrow afternoon when Dean
Cromwell will turn his entire varsity
and frvshman track teams loose in the
A.A.U. Championships at the Los An
geles Coliseum.
