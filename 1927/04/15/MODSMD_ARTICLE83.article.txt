# A 						FEW OF TEMPLETON-CHRISTIE RIVALS IN THE BIG MEET
## 
### 
Upper Row—l. Shipkey, who is favored to place second in the javelin
tomorrow; 2. Hoffman will be pitted against Gerkin in the shot and discus;
3. West, favored Card in the low hurdles, clearing one.
Below—l. Talbot is California's sole hope in the quarter mile tomorrow.
2. Gerkin, who last year bested Hoffman in both shot and discus, hopes to
repeat the feat.
The above men are ones counted on by Coaches Templeton and Christie
to score from one to ten points apiece. Talbot, Golden Bear 440 man, is
the only one who lacks certainty of placing. If the Cardinals score a clean
sweep in the 440 it will be the second successive time.
