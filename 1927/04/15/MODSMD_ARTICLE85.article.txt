## U.C. BABES WIN ON GRID Stanford Freshmen Lead in Minor Sports Laurels Gained in Year 
### 
Winning two out of four major
sports played, and winning two and
tieing one out of throe minor sports
played is the record to date turned in
by the Stanford freshmen against
their traditional rivals, the University
of California freshmen.

son reached its climax with the recent
victories of the Cardinal babes in base
ball and track. Up to this time, the
Blue and Gold had won both the foot
ball and basketball pennants. The final
Outcome of the year to break the tie
and determine the undisputed victors
Will depend on the result of the tennis
meet which was postponed on account
of rain. The Bear Cubs, however, have
won two matches of this event.
In the minor sports field, Stanford
won from the Hear Cubs in water polo
and swimming. The soccer contest was
a lie and no third game was played
to break it. The golf match was post-
Toned on account of the wet weather.
Freshman Team Heavy

of the heaviest teamr; that Stanford
has seen for some time, the line aver
aged from 180 to 190 pounds and the
backfield from 170 to 17JT, the freshmen
won victories from the majority of
thoir opponents. As a previous feeler
f(?r the Little Big Game, they beat the ,

Trojan yearlings by the decisive score
of 27 to 0. The Little Big Game was
another story. Although they made
twice as many first downs as the
California Bears, the freshmen did not
rise to expectations and lost by the
score of 44 to 20.
In the line of basketball, Stanford
won seven contests out of an eleven
game schedule. The first game of the

Cardinals in the relay, shot, discus,
and quarter mile. The record time of
the 100-yard dash was also equaled.
By taking the first baseball game
with a score of 12 to 9, and the second
game by the score of 4 to 1, the fresh
men won the California-Stanford title.
Some good players wero developed
which should find their way to the
varsity squad next year in the infield
positions.
The California beginners won the

| first soccer meet by the close score of
4-3 and the Stanford freshmen retali
: ated by taking the next game 2 to 0.

playing in all their matches.
Trounce Cub Swimmers
In the aquatic sports, the freshmen
i reigned supreme. Although not playing
up to their usual standard, the fresh
man water polo team downed the Blue

ming meet, Stanford took every first
! and second place in all the events
entered. Records were set by the year
lings in the 50- and 100-yard dashes,
free style, the relay, and the 100-yard
backstroke. In no other activity will

entered. Records were set by the year
lings in the 50- and 100-yard dashes,
free style, the relay, and the 100-yard
backstroke. In no other activity will
the freshmen contribute to the ranks
1 of the varsity teams as in the swim
ming events, several freshmen having
beaten the records set by the first
string varsity men.
Winning two out of four major
sports played, and winning two and
tieing one out of throe minor sports
played is the record to date turned in
by the Stanford freshmen against
their traditional rivals, the University
of California freshmen.
The Stanford-California athletic sea
son reached its climax with the recent
victories of the Cardinal babes in base
ball and track. Up to this time, the
Blue and Gold had won both the foot
ball and basketball pennants. The final
Outcome of the year to break the tie
and determine the undisputed victors
Will depend on the result of the tennis
meet which was postponed on account
of rain. The Bear Cubs, however, have
won two matches of this event.
In the minor sports field, Stanford
won from the Hear Cubs in water polo
and swimming. The soccer contest was
a lie and no third game was played
to break it. The golf match was post-
Toned on account of the wet weather.
Freshman Team Heavy
Starting the football season with one
of the heaviest teamr; that Stanford
has seen for some time, the line aver
aged from 180 to 190 pounds and the
backfield from 170 to 17JT, the freshmen
won victories from the majority of
thoir opponents. As a previous feeler
f(?r the Little Big Game, they beat the ,

Trojan yearlings by the decisive score
of 27 to 0. The Little Big Game was
another story. Although they made
twice as many first downs as the
California Bears, the freshmen did not
rise to expectations and lost by the
score of 44 to 20.
In the line of basketball, Stanford
won seven contests out of an eleven
game schedule. The first game of the
California series went to the Cubs by
the score of 40 to 22. In the second
game the Cardinals lost by one point,
the final tally being 26 to 25.
Cards Win Track Meet
Stanford's babes were not to be de
nied when it came to the annual track
and field meet, winning for the fourth
consecutive time by a score of 6S 1-3
to G2 2-3. The features of the meet
were the smashing of the records by
Cardinals in the relay, shot, discus,
and quarter mile. The record time of
the 100-yard dash was also equaled.
By taking the first baseball game
with a score of 12 to 9, and the second
game by the score of 4 to 1, the fresh
men won the California-Stanford title.
Some good players wero developed
which should find their way to the
varsity squad next year in the infield
positions.
The California beginners won the

| first soccer meet by the close score of
4-3 and the Stanford freshmen retali
: ated by taking the next game 2 to 0.
The babes showed aggressive and fast
playing in all their matches.
Trounce Cub Swimmers
In the aquatic sports, the freshmen
i reigned supreme. Although not playing
up to their usual standard, the fresh
man water polo team downed the Blue
and Gold 5 to 2. In the freshman swim
ming meet, Stanford took every first
! and second place in all the events
entered. Records were set by the year
