# VARSITY BASKETBALL FURNISHES WORST SETBACK TO SEASON OF BRILLIANT WORK
## 
### (By Bob Speers 
With one of the best teams in America on the gridiron, a
track aggregation which will unquestionably be known nation
ally, tennis players of country-wide renown, and successful
representation in a host of other sports, Stanford has made
and is making athletic history this 1926-27 season.
Cards at High Point
Glenn Warner's Cardinal eleven made last fall the heydey
of Stanford's glory. After trouncing the Bears from Berkeley,
annexing the Pacific Coast Conference title, the Cards met
and tied the championship Alabama team in a hectic battle
staged at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, New Year's Day.
Things didn't look any too rosy for "Pop's" pupils during
the first stages of the season, however. The boys fumbled
and blundered through the early games, managing to eke out
wins by some exceedingly uncomfortable margins.
When they began going, however, they went with speed
and vigor. The first big test came when the Stanford outfit
met U.S.C. and after a truly great football game defeated
the Southerners, 13 to 12. From then on the Cardinals bowled
them over with neat precision, climaxing the season with a
crushing win from California.
Basketball Drops
Basketball, coming as it did on the heels of a brilliant grid
season, was unfortunate in the contract furnished by its
predecessor. Any sport to receive favorable comparison
would necessarily have to be remarkable. For that reasou
the basketball season, though certaintly not good, was not
as dismal as it seemod.
At Stanford a team's success is more or less largely de
pendent on whether or not it scores a victory over California
and in that particular the Cardinal hoopnien failed this year.
In the other big series, that with U.S.C., Stanford met with
better luck and handed the Southerners two defeats. Taking
the season as a whole Hunt's men won five games and lost
seven.
Little can be said of Stanford's baseball because the big
test comes tomorrow when Wolter's charges tackle the Bear
diamond men in the final meeting of the series. California
was victorious in the initial contest played Tuesday. The
> second game was Wednesday. Stanford took tiie Trojans

into camp earlier in the season by winning a series with the Southern school. Before that
the Cards played a long string of practice til ts which furnished plent of experience.
Track in Limelight
"Dink" Templeton and his oval stars are at present occuping the limelight in the athletic
world of the Farm. According to most critics and according to the coach himself, the 1927
team is the greatest seen at Stanford in years—possibly the greatest ever seen anywhere.
By victories over Los Angeles Athletic Club, Hollywood Athletic Club, Olympic Club, and
the Southern California All-Stars, the Cardinals have earned a great reputation and have a
big edge over U.C. for tomorrow's meet.
Powerful Net Team
In tennis, too, Stanford has risen to formidable power. Cranston Holman is second man in
the recent rating of the Intercollegiate Ranking Committee of the United States Lawn Tennis
Association. Lionel Ogden, his teammate, shares with Holman second place in the national

doubles listings
These players
are outstand
ing, but they
are by no
means the only
high spots in
the Cardinal
outfit-
On the whole
Stanford has
also had a suc
cessful season.

also had a suc
cessful season.
With one of the best teams in America on the gridiron, a
track aggregation which will unquestionably be known nation
ally, tennis players of country-wide renown, and successful
representation in a host of other sports, Stanford has made
and is making athletic history this 1926-27 season.
Cards at High Point
Glenn Warner's Cardinal eleven made last fall the heydey
of Stanford's glory. After trouncing the Bears from Berkeley,
annexing the Pacific Coast Conference title, the Cards met
and tied the championship Alabama team in a hectic battle
staged at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, New Year's Day.
Things didn't look any too rosy for "Pop's" pupils during
the first stages of the season, however. The boys fumbled
and blundered through the early games, managing to eke out
wins by some exceedingly uncomfortable margins.
When they began going, however, they went with speed
and vigor. The first big test came when the Stanford outfit
met U.S.C. and after a truly great football game defeated
the Southerners, 13 to 12. From then on the Cardinals bowled
them over with neat precision, climaxing the season with a
crushing win from California.
Basketball Drops
Basketball, coming as it did on the heels of a brilliant grid
season, was unfortunate in the contract furnished by its
predecessor. Any sport to receive favorable comparison
would necessarily have to be remarkable. For that reasou
the basketball season, though certaintly not good, was not
as dismal as it seemod.
At Stanford a team's success is more or less largely de
pendent on whether or not it scores a victory over California
and in that particular the Cardinal hoopnien failed this year.
In the other big series, that with U.S.C., Stanford met with
better luck and handed the Southerners two defeats. Taking
the season as a whole Hunt's men won five games and lost
seven.
Little can be said of Stanford's baseball because the big
test comes tomorrow when Wolter's charges tackle the Bear
diamond men in the final meeting of the series. California
was victorious in the initial contest played Tuesday. The
> second game was Wednesday. Stanford took tiie Trojans

into camp earlier in the season by winning a series with the Southern school. Before that
the Cards played a long string of practice til ts which furnished plent of experience.
Track in Limelight
"Dink" Templeton and his oval stars are at present occuping the limelight in the athletic
world of the Farm. According to most critics and according to the coach himself, the 1927
team is the greatest seen at Stanford in years—possibly the greatest ever seen anywhere.
By victories over Los Angeles Athletic Club, Hollywood Athletic Club, Olympic Club, and
the Southern California All-Stars, the Cardinals have earned a great reputation and have a
big edge over U.C. for tomorrow's meet.
Powerful Net Team
In tennis, too, Stanford has risen to formidable power. Cranston Holman is second man in
the recent rating of the Intercollegiate Ranking Committee of the United States Lawn Tennis
Association. Lionel Ogden, his teammate, shares with Holman second place in the national

doubles listings
These players
are outstand
ing, but they
are by no
means the only
high spots in
the Cardinal
outfit-
On the whole
