# INDICATIONS FORECAST ATTENDANCE INCREASE AT SUMMER SESSION
## Professors From Foremost American Universities To Give Courses 
### 
With a much larger number of in
quiries and more applications for admis
sion being made now than ever before for
the coming summer quarter, there is every
indication of an increase in enrollment
over past years, reports John A. Sellards,
director of the summer quarter.
Last year the summer quarter enroll
ment of approximately 1200 students
showed a definite tendency toward gradu
ate work in spite of the fact that a pro
gram is always provided for undergradu
ates. More tljao. fifty per cent of those
enrolled last suni«tf>r were graduates, the
number of enrolled exceed
ing the entire nurtiber of graduates dur
ing the three regular quarters of that
year.
Activities Prominent
In speaking of activities other than
academic for the summer session, Sel- i
lards points out that every effort is being
made to provide extra-curricular diver
sions and entertainments. For those who
come to Stanford for the first time a
special attempt is being made to bring
new graduate students into close contact
with faculty members and with each
other.
The faculty of the summer term will
consist of about 150 members, including
forty visiting professors representing
leading American universities, and four
European professors. Dr. Louis Arnaud
Reid of the University of Liverpool will
offer "Introduction to Philosophy," and
"Truth and Its Place in Reality." Dr.
Tomas Navarro Tomas, of the Centro
de Estudios Ilistoricos, Madrid, who is
recognized as the greatest living authority
on Spanish phonetics, conies to the United
States for the first time and will give
several courses at Stanford.
European Professors
Professor Maurice Wilmotte of the
University of Liege, Belgium, will also
make his first visit to America to offer
courses in Romanic languages at Stan
ford during the summer quarter. The
University of Vienna will be represented
this year on the summer quarter faculty
by Dr. Karl Biihler, who will give courses
in psychology.
In addition to scheduled courses a large
number of special lectures by prominent
scholars from various parts of Europe
and the United States have been arranged.
During the first week, Professor C. K.
Webster of the department o£ Politics of
the University of Wales will lecture on
"The Present Status of the League of
Nations."
Special lecturers have been secured for
every Tuesday evening and every Wed
nesday afternoon with additional frequent
lectures in special fields planned. Each
Thursday there will be a musical event
in the form of a concert, a recital, or a
lecture on some musical subject.
