"Young people of today want to live
bravely, freely, and colorfully, making
life an adventure," said Dr. Bruce Curry,
of the Union Theological Seminary of
New York, to College of the Pacific stu
dents. "They do not want life to be dull
and drab, and they should question the
systems which have been forced on them
by older people.
"Thousands of Christian students are
smugly accepting old institutions. There
are some radical, even atheistic groups,
which are doing some clear thinking."
