# OLD BOY WILL AIR OPINIONS ON TRACK, ALUMNI IN CHAPPIE
## 
### 
With the Old Boy's pleasant mal
ice directed at the foibles of track
men and the idiosyncracies of home
coming old grads, the Track Num
ber of Chaparral will be in circula
tion today. In this mouth's issue
the magazine exposes all the weak
nesses of track meets and all the
peculiarities of alumni who have
returned to the Farm.
An innovation will be started in
the sale of Giaparral outside the
Stadium before the Big Meet to
morrow afternoon. This is being
done for the benefit of alumni and
others who have not subscribed to
the magazine and who have been
unable to obtain copies.
Alumni may also open subscrip
tions for next year at this time.
Copies of. the publication will be
mailed to regular subscribers this
afternoon, and will also be placed
on sale at the Bookstore and Union.
A delay in press work has necessi
tated doing away with the Quad
sale for Friday morning.
Herb Reynolds, '28, steals the
march on Tennyson with his illus
trated saga of "llow Knighthood
Went to Seed." Tl*s gripping trav
elogue concerns the heroic adven
tures of Sir Loin who sat at an
honored corner of the Table Round.
