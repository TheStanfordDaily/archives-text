# TEMPLETON HOPES TO WIN FOURTH STRAIGHT VICTORY FROM BEARS
## 
### 
When Dink Templeton sends his
Cardinals against Walter Christie's
University of California track team in
the stadium tomorrow he will be at
tempting a predicted fourth straight
victory over the veteran California
coach's cohorts.
Tomorrow's contest will be the sev
enth between the two coaches, Tem
pleton holding three victories, Christie
two, and one being tied.
Christie, now coaching the Bears for
his twenty-sixth season, defeated Tem
pleton in 1921 and 1923, when the
Cardinal coach had just graduated
from Stanford, and the California
teams were national champions, but
has been unable to finish ahead of
Stanford since. In 1922 the meet re
sulted in a tie.
Card Victory Decisive
The Cardinal victory in 1924 was
overwhelming. In 1925 there was a
two-point margin, and last year a
seven-point difference separated the
teams. Tomorrow, dope has it that
Stanford will win with a comfortable
lead.
Before coming to Berkeley in 1901,
Christie was a coach at Cornell and
Annapolis. Perhaps the greatest honor
he has won was to be appointed head
field coach for the United States Olym
pic team which captured the 1924
championships at Paris, the appoint
ment being chiefly due to his phenome
nal success in winning the 1.C.4A.
championships three years in succes
sion. He was also a coach in the 1920
Olympics, where he instructed Dink
Templeton, Stanford jump star, in the
high jump.
Though by far Christie's junior in
years and experience, Templeton in
his seven years at Stanford has fallen
into the habit of coaching track teams
ranking among the very best in the
nation. When he has no outstanding
performers, he has a way of develop
ing men and shifting thom about until
his teams present strength in every
event, and incidentally a few stars are
developed.
