Activity on the intramural diamonds
took a new spurt of interest yesterday
when for the first time this season all the
games scheduled for an afternoon's pro
gram were played. Eight baseball teams
played four games to advance the series
another step toward deciding the charf- !
pionships of the five leagues.
Phi Delts Win
Phi Delta Theta, after defaulting a |
game last week, offset its loss by trim
ming the El Toro club 17 to 4; Phi Kappa
Sigma made it two in a row to keep their
perfect percentage by downing Alpha
Sigma Phi, Bto 6; El Campo with little
trouble disposed of the first Encina or- |
ganization that has participated this sea
son, 23 to 2; and El Cuadro easily beat
Delta Tau Delta, 16 to 6.
Of the four games played, all were
walk-aways for the victors except the j
Phi Kappa Sigma - Alpha Sig contest.
The latter tried with a belated rally to
tie the score, but their opponents' infield
tightened, and the game was safe. Phi
Kappa Sigma started the game with a I
rush, scoring four runs before the other !
team was credited with a tally, as Walt j
Campbell was ineffective in the box in !
the early innings.
The Phi Delts presented a strong nine
against El Toro, fielding well, hitting in
the pinches, and taking advantage of
every break. Dan Frost held the club to
no hits for four innings, while B. Busch
was allowing the fraternity men two
binglcs. But he lost control of the game
after that, and the Phi Delts were never
headed.
Encina Enters Team
Encina 11, the first freshman group that j
has entered a team, played ragged ball '
against El Campo. Harlow Rothert, En
cina hurler, was effective, but received
little support. In the third inning, he
fanned six batters, only to have them
reach first on errors by cither the catcher
or the first baseman, and the club tal
lied six unearned runs.
El Cuadro, with Ralph McCall in the
box, scored continually from the first
frame while the unorganized Delta Tau
nine, lacking their regular pitcher, never
became dangerous.
Today's games, which mark the end j
of the second week of the baseball season, 1
are as follows:
Diamond I—Encina IV vs. Sequoia.
Diamond ll—Encina 111 vs. Sigma
Nu.
Diamond lll—Theta Delta Chi vs.

Diamond IV.—Chi Psi vs. Los Arcos.

Of the four games played, all were
walk-aways for the victors except the j
Phi Kappa Sigma - Alpha Sig contest.
The latter tried with a belated rally to
tie the score, but their opponents' infield
tightened, and the game was safe. Phi
Kappa Sigma started the game with a I
rush, scoring four runs before the other !
team was credited with a tally, as Walt j
Campbell was ineffective in the box in !
the early innings.
The Phi Delts presented a strong nine
against El Toro, fielding well, hitting in
the pinches, and taking advantage of
every break. Dan Frost held the club to
no hits for four innings, while B. Busch
was allowing the fraternity men two
binglcs. But he lost control of the game
after that, and the Phi Delts were never
headed.
Encina Enters Team
Encina 11, the first freshman group that j
has entered a team, played ragged ball '
against El Campo. Harlow Rothert, En
cina hurler, was effective, but received
little support. In the third inning, he
fanned six batters, only to have them
reach first on errors by cither the catcher
or the first baseman, and the club tal
lied six unearned runs.
El Cuadro, with Ralph McCall in the
box, scored continually from the first
frame while the unorganized Delta Tau
nine, lacking their regular pitcher, never
became dangerous.
Today's games, which mark the end j
of the second week of the baseball season, 1
are as follows:
Diamond I—Encina IV vs. Sequoia.
Diamond ll—Encina 111 vs. Sigma
Nu.
Diamond lll—Theta Delta Chi vs.
Theta Xi.
Diamond IV.—Chi Psi vs. Los Arcos.
Phi Delta Theta 17, El Toro 4.
Phi Kappa Sigma 8, Alpha Sigma
Phi 6.
El Cafripo 23, Encina II 2.
El Cuadro 16, Delta Tau Delta 6.
Activity on the intramural diamonds
took a new spurt of interest yesterday
when for the first time this season all the
games scheduled for an afternoon's pro
gram were played. Eight baseball teams
played four games to advance the series
another step toward deciding the charf- !
pionships of the five leagues.
Phi Delts Win
Phi Delta Theta, after defaulting a |
game last week, offset its loss by trim
ming the El Toro club 17 to 4; Phi Kappa
Sigma made it two in a row to keep their
perfect percentage by downing Alpha
Sigma Phi, Bto 6; El Campo with little
trouble disposed of the first Encina or- |
ganization that has participated this sea
son, 23 to 2; and El Cuadro easily beat
Delta Tau Delta, 16 to 6.
