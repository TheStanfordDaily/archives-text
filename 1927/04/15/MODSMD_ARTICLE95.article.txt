# ROOTERS
## 
### 
All rooters should be in their
seats for the Big Meet at 1:15
o'clock and must wear white
shirts and rooters' caps, declared
Cal Conron, chairman of the Rally
Committee yesterday.
Stanford men are especially
urged to sit in the rooting section
and to arrive early. No big stunts
will be carried out but there will
be a few with rooters' hats.
