# PRESIDENT WILBUR ANNOUNCES LOWER DIVISION ELIMINATION PLANS-TO MATURE IN 1934
## Stanford National Board Hears Proposal for "Senior" College DETAILS MADE PUBLIC Gradual Reduction to Start In 1929; To Be Completed By January 1934 
### 
President Wilbur, meeting with the
Stanford National Board during the
week-end, has put into definite form
his proposal that Stanford shall do
away with the freshman and sopho
more years. According to Dr. Wilbur's
plan, the University will start year
after next on a progressive system of
elimination of the Lower Division, to
be completed in 1934.
The plan provides for a gradual re
duction of the number of students ad
mitted to the Lower Division to keep
pace with the increasing number of
applicants from junior colleges as
those institutions continue to develop.
By January 1, 1934, when Dr. Wil
bur estimates that Stanford's present
junior college work will be entirely
absorbed by other institutions offering
such courses, all existing obligations
on the part of Stanford to accept
freshmen and sophomores, he believes,
will have expired, and only junior and
senior undergraduate work will be
done here.
President Wilbur has already taken
the proposal up with the Board of
Trustees, discussion with the Stanford
National Board being held prior to
making the decision public.
