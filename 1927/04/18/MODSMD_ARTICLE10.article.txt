# VARSITY RACKET TEAM SWAMPS BEAR REGULARS
## McELVENNEY DOES WELL Holman's Defeat of Bear Captain Boosts Title Chances 
### 
Sweeping four out of five fast
matches, Stanford's strong varsity ten
nis team thoroughly proved its superi
ority over the University of California
netmen Saturday on the Stanford
courts. The Bears' sole win was in
the second singles, ,where John Risso,
California one-armed player, downed
Lionel Ogden in a close struggle, 6-3,
6-3.
Cranston Holman, Cardinal number
one player, was too good for Captain
Tom Stow of California, and had little
trouble winning 6-1, 6-2, boosting his
chances for the intercollegiate title.
Ogden and Risso played a close game,
but the former's double-faults lost him
the match.
McElvenney Beats Hoogs
Ralph McElvenney played a great
game in the third singles and earned
a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Dick Hoogs of
the Bears. Paired with Alan Herring
ton, McElvenney also won a three set
doubles match, defeating Risso and
Andrew Burke. McElvenney was out
standing in the doubles, placing his
shots perfectly. Herrington seemed to
be off form.
In the other doubles Ogden shone,
the Holmau-Ogdeh combination smoth
ering Stow and Hoogs 6-4, 6-0. The
California pair got away to a 4-1 lead,
but Holman and Ogden cut loose with
a series of accurate volleys to carry
the next eleven games in speedy
fashion.
Their showing against the powerful
Bear players indicates that the four
Cardinals should make a really strong
bid for both the intercollegiate singles
and doubles titles if they are given
the chance to compete in the national
tourney this summer.

day's matches:
Cranston Holman (S) d. Tom Stow
(C), 6-1, 6-2.
