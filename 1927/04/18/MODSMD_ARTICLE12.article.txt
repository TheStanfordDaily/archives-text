### 
Edwin Markham, California poet and
author of the world-famous poem, "The
Man With the Hoe," will give a series
of readings from his own poetry, with
comments, Wednesday afternoon at
4:15 o'clock in the Littlo Theatre.
Has Been Lecturing
Mr. Markham has spent the last
week lecturing in Southern California
and will be in this vicinity only a short
time. It was partly through the efforts
of Miss Edith R. Mirrielees, assistant
professor of English, that the Public
Exercises Committee was able to se
cure him for the program.
"Edwin Markham has been a great
aid to beginning poets," said Miss
Mirrielees, "and has always had the
educator's attitude toward assisting
amateur work. He is, you know, the
third judge in the Irene Hardy prize
poem competition."
