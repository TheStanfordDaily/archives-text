# STANFORD TRACK TEAM TAKES OVERWHELMING VICTORY FROM INVADING GOLDEN BEAR SQUAD
## Three Records Broken by Cardinal Field Stars In Events STRONG WIND HINDERS Gerkin Unable to Qualify in Shot Put, Takes Second In Discus Throw 
### Joe Carroll 
Setting three new Big Meet records
and shutting out Blue and Gold ath
letes in three events, the Stanford
University trackmen handed the Uni
versity of California athletes the worst
beating in years, winning 90 2-3 to
40 1-3.
Fred Richman's two first places in
the 100 and 220, Alex McKinnon's win
ning race in the mile, Biff Hoffman's
discus throw, Fred Zombro's broad
jump record, and Tom Joaquin's jave
lin heave were high lights in a meet
that proved more of an exhibition than
a contest.
Wind a Handicap
The wind proved detrimental to men
striving for records o nthe track, but
aided javelin throwers, broad jumpers,
and discus throwers to a considerable
extent. High jumpers and pole vaulters
also suffered as the pole was blown off
the standards just as jumps were
being made.
Stanford shot putters came through
to completely shut out Captain Elmer
Gerkin of California, who won the
event in the last two Big Meets. Hoff
man took a first here which gave hini
a total Qf ten points, combined with
his winning throw in the discus.
A1 Forster and Herb Fleishhacker,
Stanford sophomores, came through in
competition by placing second and
third in the shot.
McKinnon Surprises
"When Alex McKinnon started the
sprint that carried him to victory in
the mile, over Les Scliwobeda, the
favorite, he ran two seconds faster
