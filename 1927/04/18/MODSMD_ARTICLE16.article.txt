# STANFORD TRACK TEAM TAKES OVERWHELMING VICTORY FROM INVADING GOLDEN BEAR SQUAD
## Three Records Broken by Cardinal Field Stars In Events STRONG WIND HINDERS Gerkin Unable to Qualify in Shot Put, Takes Second In Discus Throw 
### Joe Carroll 
Setting three new Big Meet records
and shutting out Blue and Gold ath
letes in three events, the Stanford
University trackmen handed the Uni
versity of California athletes the worst
beating in years, winning 90 2-3 to
40 1-3.
Fred Richman's two first places in
the 100 and 220, Alex McKinnon's win
ning race in the mile, Biff Hoffman's
discus throw, Fred Zombro's broad
jump record, and Tom Joaquin's jave
lin heave were high lights in a meet
that proved more of an exhibition than
a contest.
Wind a Handicap
The wind proved detrimental to men
striving for records o nthe track, but
aided javelin throwers, broad jumpers,
and discus throwers to a considerable
extent. High jumpers and pole vaulters
also suffered as the pole was blown off
the standards just as jumps were
being made.
Stanford shot putters came through
to completely shut out Captain Elmer
Gerkin of California, who won the
event in the last two Big Meets. Hoff
man took a first here which gave hini
a total Qf ten points, combined with
his winning throw in the discus.
A1 Forster and Herb Fleishhacker,
Stanford sophomores, came through in
competition by placing second and
third in the shot.
McKinnon Surprises
"When Alex McKinnon started the
sprint that carried him to victory in
the mile, over Les Scliwobeda, the
favorite, he ran two seconds faster
than his best previous time despite!
the wind.
Elmer Boyden won the half-mile, but
two Stanford sophomores, Bill Clum
and Don Moss, were second and third, j
Moss got out of the hospital Friday
after a touch of flu, so his showing
was good.
Shutout in Javelin
The javelirt throwers, Tdm Joaquin,
Bill Sparling, and Ted Shipkey, com
bined to shut out California. So did
Fred Zombro, Sid Meeks, and Ken
Gyer, broad jumpers, all of them clear- j
ing 23 feet and Zombro going 24 feet
3-4 inches. Clarence West ran the best ;
low hurdle race of the season. In spite:
of the wind, he ran 25 seconds flat.,
Ilichman's time in the 220 was 24 sec- j
onds. West cleared the barriers in j
very goo dstyle. His race with Mor-J
ton Kaer, the U.S.C. star, next Satur- j
day, should be a beautiful one.
Nichols Disqualified
Ross Nichols won the highs, but ■
knocked over three hurdles, so he
was disqualified. Ragan won, West sec
ond, and Bullis came third.
A1 Stevens won the two-mile all by |
himself, Rufus Ranney came second, i
and John Truman finished third to j
win his Block "S." Three years of hard
work earned its reward when Johnny
took the point necessary for his letter.
Records Not Intercollegiate
The records made will probably be
allowed to stand as Stanford-California
marks. They will probably not be ac-l
cepted by intercollegiate governing
bodies, however, because of the wind.
Lank Talbot beat Captain Larry Bab
cock to second place in the quarter
mile, finishing after Emerson Spencer.

Setting three new Big Meet records
and shutting out Blue and Gold ath
letes in three events, the Stanford
University trackmen handed the Uni
versity of California athletes the worst
beating in years, winning 90 2-3 to
40 1-3.
Fred Richman's two first places in
the 100 and 220, Alex McKinnon's win
ning race in the mile, Biff Hoffman's
discus throw, Fred Zombro's broad
jump record, and Tom Joaquin's jave
lin heave were high lights in a meet
that proved more of an exhibition than
a contest.
Wind a Handicap
The wind proved detrimental to men
striving for records o nthe track, but
aided javelin throwers, broad jumpers,
and discus throwers to a considerable
extent. High jumpers and pole vaulters
also suffered as the pole was blown off
the standards just as jumps were
being made.
Stanford shot putters came through
to completely shut out Captain Elmer
Gerkin of California, who won the
event in the last two Big Meets. Hoff
man took a first here which gave hini
a total Qf ten points, combined with
his winning throw in the discus.
A1 Forster and Herb Fleishhacker,
Stanford sophomores, came through in
competition by placing second and
third in the shot.
McKinnon Surprises
"When Alex McKinnon started the
sprint that carried him to victory in
the mile, over Les Scliwobeda, the
favorite, he ran two seconds faster
than his best previous time despite!
the wind.
Elmer Boyden won the half-mile, but
two Stanford sophomores, Bill Clum
and Don Moss, were second and third, j
Moss got out of the hospital Friday
after a touch of flu, so his showing
was good.
Shutout in Javelin
The javelirt throwers, Tdm Joaquin,
Bill Sparling, and Ted Shipkey, com
bined to shut out California. So did
Fred Zombro, Sid Meeks, and Ken
Gyer, broad jumpers, all of them clear- j
ing 23 feet and Zombro going 24 feet
3-4 inches. Clarence West ran the best ;
low hurdle race of the season. In spite:
of the wind, he ran 25 seconds flat.,
Ilichman's time in the 220 was 24 sec- j
onds. West cleared the barriers in j
very goo dstyle. His race with Mor-J
ton Kaer, the U.S.C. star, next Satur- j
day, should be a beautiful one.
Nichols Disqualified
Ross Nichols won the highs, but ■
knocked over three hurdles, so he
was disqualified. Ragan won, West sec
ond, and Bullis came third.
A1 Stevens won the two-mile all by |
himself, Rufus Ranney came second, i

win his Block "S." Three years of hard
work earned its reward when Johnny
took the point necessary for his letter.

Stanford shot putters came through
to completely shut out Captain Elmer
Gerkin of California, who won the
event in the last two Big Meets. Hoff
man took a first here which gave hini
a total Qf ten points, combined with
his winning throw in the discus.
A1 Forster and Herb Fleishhacker,
Stanford sophomores, came through in
competition by placing second and
third in the shot.
McKinnon Surprises
"When Alex McKinnon started the
sprint that carried him to victory in
the mile, over Les Scliwobeda, the
favorite, he ran two seconds faster
than his best previous time despite!
the wind.
Elmer Boyden won the half-mile, but
two Stanford sophomores, Bill Clum
and Don Moss, were second and third, j
Moss got out of the hospital Friday
after a touch of flu, so his showing
was good.
Shutout in Javelin
The javelirt throwers, Tdm Joaquin,
Bill Sparling, and Ted Shipkey, com
bined to shut out California. So did
Fred Zombro, Sid Meeks, and Ken
Gyer, broad jumpers, all of them clear- j
ing 23 feet and Zombro going 24 feet
3-4 inches. Clarence West ran the best ;
low hurdle race of the season. In spite:
of the wind, he ran 25 seconds flat.,
Ilichman's time in the 220 was 24 sec- j
onds. West cleared the barriers in j
very goo dstyle. His race with Mor-J
ton Kaer, the U.S.C. star, next Satur- j
day, should be a beautiful one.
Nichols Disqualified
Ross Nichols won the highs, but ■
knocked over three hurdles, so he
was disqualified. Ragan won, West sec
ond, and Bullis came third.
A1 Stevens won the two-mile all by |
himself, Rufus Ranney came second, i
and John Truman finished third to j
win his Block "S." Three years of hard
work earned its reward when Johnny
took the point necessary for his letter.
Records Not Intercollegiate
The records made will probably be
allowed to stand as Stanford-California
marks. They will probably not be ac-l
cepted by intercollegiate governing
bodies, however, because of the wind.
Lank Talbot beat Captain Larry Bab
cock to second place in the quarter

Setting three new Big Meet records
and shutting out Blue and Gold ath
letes in three events, the Stanford
University trackmen handed the Uni
versity of California athletes the worst
beating in years, winning 90 2-3 to
40 1-3.
Fred Richman's two first places in
the 100 and 220, Alex McKinnon's win
ning race in the mile, Biff Hoffman's
discus throw, Fred Zombro's broad

lin heave were high lights in a meet
that proved more of an exhibition than
a contest.
Wind a Handicap
The wind proved detrimental to men
striving for records o nthe track, but
aided javelin throwers, broad jumpers,
and discus throwers to a considerable
extent. High jumpers and pole vaulters
also suffered as the pole was blown off
the standards just as jumps were
being made.
