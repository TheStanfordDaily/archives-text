### 
Encina IV 10, Sequoia 14
Encina 111 4, Sigma Nu 6 (five
innings)
Theta Delta Chi 7, Theta Xi 10
Chi Psi 13, Los Arcos 2
An orgy of batting and poor fielding
marked all the intramural baseball
games last Friday afternoon. The
pitchers did not seem able to hold the
batters in ohefk and the high wind
baffled many of the outfielders in at
tempts to catch the balls.
Sequoia Defeats Encina IV
Nelly Smith hit a home run for En
cina and Lew Snyder, of Sequoia,
knocked out a tliree-bagger with three
men on bases in the Encina IV-Se
quoia game. Quinn pitched for Sequoia
while Swain caught, but was later re
placed by McCuen. Encina led 7 to 3
during the first five innings, but Se
quoia made eight runs during their
part of the fifth and consequently won
the game by the score of 14 to 10.
Sampson and Cathcart was the battery
for Encina IV.
The closest tilt of the afternoon was
between Encina 111 and Sigma Nu.
Though the game only lasted five in
nings, the score. 4-6, indicates the
playing during the contest. Clover
made a home run during the sixth.
The battery for Sigma Nu was Harry
Todd and Bob Murphy, and for Encina
111, Revel and McMicking.
Los Arcos Loses to Chi Psis
Due to the lack of men Los Arcos
lost 2-13. During the game, McArcarta,
of Chi Psi, knocked out a homer. Van
King pitched and McArcarta caught
for the fraternity men, while Jim Wilt
hurled the ball and Sid Madden re
ceived for Los Arcos.

for a home run while the rest of the
Theta Xi team gained most of the 10
runs against the Theta Delt outfit
during the first inning. Herb Crisp and
Barry Casad composed the battery for
Theta Xi and Ernie Patchett and
Mark Freeman handled the ball for
Theta Delta Chi.
