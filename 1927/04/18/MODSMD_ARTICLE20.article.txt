# HULME WILL SPEAK TOMORROW EVENING ON "THE FAR LOOK"

"We must find out what the social'
forces are that are actuating humanj
society today, if we are to orient our- j
selves to them. *We must find them !
and then discover purposes to direct j
them â€”the main things man must con-!
trol."
Following out this line of reasoning,
Professor Edward Maslin Ilulme, mem
ber of the Stanford History depart
ment and author of the textbook now
used in the English history course, will
speak on "The Far Look" tomorrow
night, attempting "a wide look over
society today." The lecture will begin
at 7:30' o'clock in the Little Theatre.
His talk will be divided into two
general parts. He will try first to
ascertain the fundamental forces hold
ing our present society, and following
their establishment he will attempt
to discover the social ends needed to
direct these forces. "Then," Professor
Hulme added, "we'll know where we
stand."
