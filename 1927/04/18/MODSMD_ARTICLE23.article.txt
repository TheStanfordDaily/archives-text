Like the proverbial growth that most people have on their heads, the
Lower Division is going", going, and will be gone on January 1, 1934, ac
cording to the recommendation by President Wilbur to the Board of
I rustees. A few years ago the University began restricting the ad
mittance of freshmen to Stanford, at the same time encouraging
students from other institutions and junior college graduates to trans
fer here. Starting the academic year 1928-29 further limitations will
be made in the numbers of students accepted in the Lower Division in
proportion to the number of applications received from junior college
students.
In the past, Stanford has been known as the Yale, or the Harvard
or the Princeton of the West. In this movement of abolishing the Lower
Division, and establishing junior colleges as a substitute for the first two
years of a university, Stanford has taken the lead. It is not impossible
to foresee the day when universities on the Atlantic slope will be known
as the Stan fords of the East.
In President Wilburs report to the I rustees, belaid down certain
points which cover the main benefits to be derived from the new system
along with the possible difficulties that might be encountered. Extracts
from the report are printed here.
I lie type of student who is fitted for university work is matured
under the changes that have taken place in our public school system so
so that he is ready for college at fifteen and sixteen years of age. With
the development of junior colleges these students will come to Stanford
at approximately the same age as they have come in the past, but they
will be entering the junior year.
\\ ith teaching" courses, medicine, law, engineering, and business
administration all over three year courses, there will be an average
longer campus residence for students than at the present and such activi
ties as athletics, fraternities and dramatics, can be conducted on a bet
ter basis than at present. I his means also that there will necessarilly
be some change in the one year dormitory rule, some readjustment in the
eligibility for athletics of students possessing the Bachelor of Arts
degree.
The quality of instruction in the junior college is at least equal to that
given in the university. The things required for this period of instruc
tion are good teaching, small classes, small library facilities and moderate
laboratory facilities. 1 hese can be provided at a minimum of expense.
This is Stanford's opportunity to obtain national and international
prestige as a university. It is organized on such a basis that it can take
leadership and initiative and does not have to wait upon political expedi
ency or to be driven by force of circumstances to reluctantly adopt a
forward-looking educational program.

leadership and initiative and does not have to wait upon political expedi
ency or to be driven by force of circumstances to reluctantly adopt a
forward-looking educational program.
Like the proverbial growth that most people have on their heads, the
Lower Division is going", going, and will be gone on January 1, 1934, ac
cording to the recommendation by President Wilbur to the Board of
I rustees. A few years ago the University began restricting the ad
mittance of freshmen to Stanford, at the same time encouraging
students from other institutions and junior college graduates to trans
fer here. Starting the academic year 1928-29 further limitations will
be made in the numbers of students accepted in the Lower Division in
proportion to the number of applications received from junior college
students.
In the past, Stanford has been known as the Yale, or the Harvard
or the Princeton of the West. In this movement of abolishing the Lower
Division, and establishing junior colleges as a substitute for the first two
years of a university, Stanford has taken the lead. It is not impossible
to foresee the day when universities on the Atlantic slope will be known
as the Stan fords of the East.
In President Wilburs report to the I rustees, belaid down certain
points which cover the main benefits to be derived from the new system
along with the possible difficulties that might be encountered. Extracts
from the report are printed here.
I lie type of student who is fitted for university work is matured
under the changes that have taken place in our public school system so
so that he is ready for college at fifteen and sixteen years of age. With
the development of junior colleges these students will come to Stanford
at approximately the same age as they have come in the past, but they
will be entering the junior year.
\\ ith teaching" courses, medicine, law, engineering, and business
administration all over three year courses, there will be an average
longer campus residence for students than at the present and such activi
ties as athletics, fraternities and dramatics, can be conducted on a bet
ter basis than at present. I his means also that there will necessarilly
be some change in the one year dormitory rule, some readjustment in the
eligibility for athletics of students possessing the Bachelor of Arts
degree.
The quality of instruction in the junior college is at least equal to that
given in the university. The things required for this period of instruc
tion are good teaching, small classes, small library facilities and moderate
laboratory facilities. 1 hese can be provided at a minimum of expense.
This is Stanford's opportunity to obtain national and international
prestige as a university. It is organized on such a basis that it can take
leadership and initiative and does not have to wait upon political expedi
ency or to be driven by force of circumstances to reluctantly adopt a
forward-looking educational program.
