# On to Victory
## 
### 
Stanford stored its greatest victory in track over the Golden Rear
Saturday. The Cardinal trackmen came within a fraction of a point
from making the largest score in the history of track competition be
tween the two universities. In the words of Lincoln "The world will
little note or long remember what we say here, but it can never forget
what they did here."
It was through the competitive ability of every Stanford athlete
that the Cardinal waves supreme today. Stanford demonstrated the
same "come-through" fight that was so famously phrased "The Stanford
Spirit" during the dark years between 1919 and 1024 when the Cali
fornia athletes won every sport from football to tiddle-de-winks.
With the California meet a thing of the past, the athletes and their
followers are ready for the University of Southern California. It is
the U.S.C. meet rather than the California competition that should be
termed the P>ig Meet this season. I loth the Trojans and the Cardinals
have been rather busy thinking about each other since the begining of
the year. They have been wondering if Richman is capable of beating
Boren and House in the sprints. They are wondering whether Kaer
and Reynolds arc better hurdlers than West and Nichols. They have
been thinking about the meeting of King, Work, and Coggeshall in the
high jump, and of Barnes and Edmunds in the polevault. They almost
had their thoughts settled and their minds put to rest two weeks ago,
but the rain dampened the situation and the track, and the meet was
postponed until next Saturday. So everyone had an extra two weeks to
think. The Stanford-California meet last week-end gave the supporters
of tnc Trojans a little additional food for thought.
The meet last Saturday was just a final practice for Stanford before
going against Southern California, and the Cards looked capable of
greater things in that final workout. Stanford realizes that U.S.C. is
the last hurdle before the Coast Meet, and the Trojans know that the
Cards are the last obstacle in their path towards the I'acinic Coast Title
in track for 1927.
