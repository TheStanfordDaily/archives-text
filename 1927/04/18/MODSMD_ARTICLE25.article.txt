On llie day when every paper in the
country carried banner headlines con
cerning the "rumored" intentions of
certain radicals to bomb the American
embassies the world over, obscure j
back pages carried the information
that the dean of the Harvard Law
School had denounced the entire
Sacco-Vanzetti case as a farce upon
justice.
From the outside it is somewhat;
hard to render a fair judgment of the
Sacco-Vanzetti matter. But the dean of'
the Harvard Law School is not in the,
habit of committing himself in the!
press on a matter of that type unless
he is rather well informed. And the j
dean of the Harvard Law School may
be presumed to know a great deal
about American criminal procedure.,
Anil when he states that Sacco and
Vanzetti are about to be executed not
for murder but for adhering to certain
economic theories it is a matter of j
considerably more importance than
any number of rumors concerning the i
proposed bombing of American em- j
bassies.
From the very fact that a hysterical j

| importance is attached to rumors of
threatened bombings in this case
would seem to indicate that Sacco and
Vanzetti have been made the victims
;of the panicy state of the public mind.
That there is an unusual hysteria
prevalent concerning the matter of
radicalism has been apparent for some
time in the behaviour of the state de
partment. There, it has manifested
| itself by a confusion of issues. It is
highly probable that the same sort of
thing might occur in the criminal
| courts. The one man who could be
considered well informed and who
could be considered to be impartial has
| said that the evidence against Sacco
: and Vanzetti is of the flimsiest sort
and that this fact lias been lost in a
wave (if public sentiment against radi
: calism.
It is too much to hope that the voice
of this scholar will be heard. For. tlie
j American public has formed the habit
! of reading newspapers from the front
page to the back. And to the American
| public Sacco and Vanzetti are two
I dangerous Reds whose friends may
' momentarily destroy every American
j ambassador in the world.
