### DOOMSDAY. By Warwick Deeping. Albert R. Knopf 
If the public has any conception of
high merit in novel —and there are
many signs these days that it does —
it con prepare to read with ease Mr.
Deeping's latest novel, while he can
sit and smoke quietly at his home in
Weybridge, England, and prepare to
endorse some checks which are in
scribed some pleasant figures. For
"Doomsday" is the kind of a novel
that can be read high and low, near
and far, by rich and poor, maid and
widow, youth and graybeard. It is a
novel about peoples as human as the
neighbors; it is furthemore one in a
thousand from the point of artistic
conception and execution.
A story of the Sussex country in
England today, it comes perhaps as
near to the power of Thomas Kardy
in the delineation of character and
background as anything that has ap
peared in years. It lacks that master's
tragic depth; one is not forever sensi
ble of that brooding destiny which
stands relentlessly over Tess and Jude
—perhaps Mr. Deeping hesitates to try
unadulterated tragedy; but the char

acters of Mary Viner and Arnold Furze
stand out nevertheless in unshaken
reality; they live and move and have
! their being by the sure hand of their
creator's genius.
The story of Mary Viner and Arnold
Furze —their ascent by devious ways
! to happiness—is largely the record of
: a woman who has to learn that wis
dom is more precious than rubies, and
that love is only metal untarnished by
years. This, she found at the end, is
; no moralist's dream, no sentimental
: ist's fancy, but the ripe apple of ex
perience which alone is sweet to the
1 taste of spirit. She learned it by physi
cal shock and spiritual travail —but
j she learned it Then, though life
i bore a humbler garb, it leaned no more
1 on the crutch of appearances. It
, walked upright and feared no evil.
There are remarkable descriptive
! passages in the book; there is even
! plenty of high society in the London
| suburbs/ and a honeymoon in the
! south of Europe; but its vitality is
| that of the Sussex heath, and it is
| there that the author leaves his hero
I and heroine, at home with their love
| where it first blossomed. —E.L.S.
