Susie Smith, a Mills transfer, read
about Hetty Green giving twenty mil
lion dollars to Princeton to establish
co-education. So incensed was Susie
that she penned this verse, a red-hot
wave of spirit for "dear old Mills."
Says Susie:
"Hetty Green gave twenty millions
To Princeton the other day.
Having a lot of co-eds around
Is the way Princeton will pay.
Now why can't some wealthy gugs
Leave US some coin in wills?
Less than twenty dollars
Would start a million men to Mills."
—V.C.

"Popular dancing as one sees it done
today is nothing more than a compli
cated form of hugging," declares in
terpretive dancer Ruth St. Denis.
Well, who would give up just be
cause a thing is complicated?

Paly-3-100 is a phone call
Often heard.
Freshman women get the calls.
—Now this is absurd.
Frosh women do not know
