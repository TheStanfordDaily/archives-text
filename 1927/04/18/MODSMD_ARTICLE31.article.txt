Fewer Fans and more athletes, with
every man in the University of Cali
fornia a gentleman, sportsman, and
scholar," said Professor Frank L.
Kleeberger, head of the physical edu
cation department for men, in discussing
the state university's aim of providing
adequate physical development for all its
students, as essential to thoroughgoing
education.
"Three thousand men are at present en
gaged in eighteen activities under the di
rection of this department," lie stated,
"li education in general may he con-'
sidered as the business of preparing indi- j
viduals to meet successfully the issues of
life, the physical phase of education may
justly be looked to primarily to prepare !
the individual for physical tests'which he '
is apt to encounter. These tests may be j
merely those of health, endurance, and
vigor in carrying on the routine work in
a physically monotonous existence.
"On the other hand," Professor Klee
berger asserted, "even the most unadven- ■
turous individual may be thrown into an
emergency demanding skill in fighting or }
swimming. lie must also be prepared to :
act quickly and aecurately in case of
eccident. This ability—not a winning I
score —is the goal of the University of!
California's sports program.
