# JUNIOR COMMITTEES HAVE PLANS IN HAND FOR CLASS WEEK-END
## Lake Carnival to Be Done Away With; Cord Ball On Tennis Court 
### 
Plans for Junior Week, which will be j
from May 5-7 this year, although still !
in an early stage, are going forward j
rapidly under the direction of the com- j
mittees.
The class has decided .to do away j
with the Lake Carnival, which has for- !
merly been held at this time, even
though Lagunita will he full enough to '
warrant its being put on. It has been I
agreed almost unanimously that the
carnival is not enough of a success to
justify its continuance.
Cord Ball on May 5
The week-end will be opened on the
afternoon of Thursday, May 5, with the
Cord Ball. Attempts are now being
made to secure a tennis court either at j
the Phi Kappa Psi house or some other
place on the campus.
The outstanding event of the occa
sion will be the Junior Prom which will
come on Friday night. The committee J
in charge of the affair has arranged for
the creation of decorations quite novel
in their design. A sort of woodland ef
fect will be carried out by the murals, |
and novel lighting will serve to make
this realistic in appearance.
Saturday morning will be occupied by
lake sports. These consist of a cross
lake swim, a diving exhibition by uni
versity divers, canoe tilting and canoe
races, and the Swedish marathon. Be
tween the events the crowd will be en
tertained by stunts. Lagunita is in ex- j
cellent condition this year for an affair j
of this sort, which should guarantee its j
success.
The week will be concluded by the

Junior Opera on Saturday night. The
plot, which revolves around quite a hu
morous situation, is of the modern mu
sical comedy type. For the first time
in many years Gordon Davis will have
charge of its direction.
