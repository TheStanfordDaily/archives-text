# COMING PROM TO HAVE NOVEL DECORATIONS, PROMISES COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Something new and different in
decorations that has never before been
tried at a Stanford dance will be at
tempted by the class of '28 at the Junior
Prom on May 8, states A1 Cass, head
of the decorations committee.
The theme of the decorations will be
an enchanted forest. That this offers
an opportunity to work out some won
derful effects is self-evident.
The dance floor will be surrounded
by a green network, which will have
trees worked out as silhouettes. These
will be formed into arches, the branches
join at the top. In the background, up
against the walls, various scenic effects
of all sorts of natural beauties will be
depicted.
a group of flood lights placed both at
the top and bottom of the walls. Be
sides giving illumination to the scenic
backdrops, the lights will serve to ac
centuate the silhouettes on the network.
These floods will serve as the sole il
lumination for the dance floor, which
will consequently be semi-dark.
Tickets for the prom will be placed
on sale to Juniors on Wednesdays,
Thursday, and Friday afternoons at
the Old Union. Next week other upper
classmen will be allowed to purchase
tickets.
