# STANFORD BASEBALL NINE LOSES SERIES TO CALIFORNIA TEAM
## Good Pitching by Collins Is Wasted When Cardinal Support Weakens 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's Stanford var
sity baseball team lost the final and
deciding game of the series with the
University of California last Saturday
afternoon on the Stanford diamond by
a score of 3 to 1. The Bears took an
early lead in the first inning, and were
never headed by the Cardinals. Cali
fornia won the series two games to
one.
Collins, Nemechek Rival Pitchers
Captain Steve Collins and Gus
Nemechek faced each other for the
second time during the week, and the
California moundsman again proved
victorious by the same score as the
first contest. Pitching his last game
for Stanford, Collins allowed only four
hits, but a timely blow by Rollle Dout
liis, U.C. outfielder, and Stanford er
rors, gave the Bears an advantage
that could not be overcome.
Douthit was elected captain of the
1928 Bear varsity Saturday night at a
baseball banquet.
With two out in the first inning,
Millett was walked and RoUte Douthit
followed with a home run to score
two runs. California added another run
in the third on errors by Garibaldi and
Maguire, Captain Ike Robie scoring the
final tally.
Only Score in Fourth
Stanford made its lone tally in the
fourth when Garibaldi doubled with
two out, Went to third on Sypher's
single and scored when Nissen hit
safely to center field. Rogers fanned to
end the inning. One of the main rea
sons for the Stanford defeat was the
inability of the Cardinal batsmen to
deliver in the pinches, several men
being left on bases during the contest.
Garibaldi Leads at Bat
Garibaldi led the day at bat, getting
two two-baggers in four trips to the
plate. Douthit's home run was the fea
ture of the contest. California gave
Nemechek good support in the field,
while the Cardinal infield made five
errors.
The score: R. H. E.
California 3 4 0
Stanford 1 5 5
Batteries: California — Nemechek
and Wyatt; Stanford —Collins and
Sypher.
