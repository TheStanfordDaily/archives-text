10-Day Sale
ENDS APRIL 25TH ON THIS FAMOUS
TUFTLESS MAT,TRESS
NOW you can own a genuine Sealy for the price
of an ordinary mattress. For a ten-day period
we have been authorized by the factory to reduce
the price of the Sealy from $55.00 to $39.50.
It
The exclusive principles by which the Sealy is
made give the maximum of sleeping comfort. The
Sealy needs no tufts as the long staple, pure white,
vigin cotton is so woven and interwoven by the
patented Sealy air-weaving process into a single
giant inseparable batt that it cannot grow lumpy
or separate.
At the same time all the natural buoyancy and
"life" of the cotton is preserved in the Sealy and
will last for years and years. _
' j
Place your order early as we only have a limited
number of Seaiys to sell at this special price. Re
member, after April 25th, the price goes back to $55
