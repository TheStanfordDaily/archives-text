# EX COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER REVISED RULES
## New Draft Corrects Major Defects in Present A.S.S.U. Laws STUDENT VOTE PLANNED Constitution Group, Headed By Littler, Completes Work on Document 
### 
Work of revising the constitution of
the A.S.S.U. has now been completed
by the special committee, of which
Robert M. C. Littler is chairman, cho
sen for that purpose. The revised con
stitution will come up for approval at
the Ex Committee meeting tonight,
and will be voted upon by the students
at a special election to be set in the
near future.
Although the content of the consti
tution has been fully worked out by
the committee, its form is being sub
jected to minor changes. This week
mimeographed copies of the tentative
constitution are being sent to those
interested, from whom suggestions for
improvement are expected.
Defects Corrected
The new draft of the constitution
corrects many defects that formerly
existed in the document. Awards, sport
managerial appointment systems, ob
scure wording, and conflicts in arti
cles are the chief matters cleared up.
Few changes in the actual machinery
of student body government have been
made, although the length of the old
constitution has been reduced by
about The chief revisions
involve to the present
practice. ''lHthe system for choos
ing sport managers is made to con
form to that which now actually is in
use on the campus, the system which
was officially in force being a dead
letter.
New Charters Added
Charters for* the Rally Committee,
the Debate Council, the Dramatic
Council, and the Publications Council
constitute one of the principal addi
tions. All of these bodies with the ex
ception of the last are provided for in
the old constitution, but the new revi
sion makes their respective fields and
powers clearer.
At Dean Yost's suggestion, the
powers of the Executive Committee
are more clearly defined, and author
ity is given the body to change means
of student control.
