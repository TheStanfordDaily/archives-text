Attempting a survey of modern so
cial conditions, Professor Edward Mas
lin Huline will lecture on "The Far
Look" tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
Professor Hulme, who is a member
of the Stanford history department,
will first discuss the fundamental so
cial forces motivating society today,
and then will try to trace what meth
ods of control are needed to direct
these forces. "We must find out what
they are," he said, "so that we can
orient ourselves to them."
