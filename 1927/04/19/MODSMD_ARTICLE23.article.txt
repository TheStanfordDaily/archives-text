# BATTLE LOOMS FOR CARDINALS IN U.S.C. MEET
## Templeton Trains Distance Men to Face Heilman, Southern Miler CLOSE CONTEST CERTAIN Stanford Conceded Better Chance Than Earlier Times Indicated 
### Joe Carroll 
Once again the Stanford University
track and field athletes turn their at
tention to the University of Southern
California stars. Delayed in meeting
the Trojans because of an oversupply
of rain a couple of weeks ago, the
Cardinals are now ready to battle the
U.S.C. men in what promises to be the
best intercollegiate dual meet ever
staged on the Pacific Coast.
The period spent in defeating Cali
fornia and preparing for the Trojan
meet was devoted to the developing
and seasoning of performers in the
half, mile, two mile, and hurdle races.
Injuries Hurt Trojans
Two weeks ago the Trojans ap
peared to be handicapped because of
injuries to Cliff Reynolds, high hurdler,
the illness of Lester Heilman, two
miler, and the but lately displayed
powers of Morton Kaer, low hurdler
and broad jumper.
Reynolds is now back in shape;
Heilman is in as good condition as he
will be this season; and Kaer has
been through enough meets to pre
pare him for the competition he will
face Saturday.
In spite of the confidence that Tro
jan supporters feel now that these
men are back in harness, the Cardi
nals seem to have a larger edge than
the one they held previously.
Stars Improve
This is due to the development of
Tom Moss and Bill Clum, half-milers;
Alex McKinnon, miler; Rufe Ranney,
two-miler; and lloss Nichols and Clar
ence West, hurdlers.
Many of the doubtful points of the
meet are centered around these com
petitors. McKinnon and Ranney may
be counted on for first place in the
mile and two mile. The duel in the
high hurdles between the Stanford
stars and Cliff Reynolds, Trojan
speeder, and in the lows with Morton
Kaer opposing the two Cardinals, may
easily decide the margin of victory.
