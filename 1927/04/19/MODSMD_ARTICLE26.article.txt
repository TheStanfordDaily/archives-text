Seniors and graduate students have been asked to provide some
valuable information for the next generation. Such a privilege is not
often offered to college men and women. Professor K. K. Strong and
Karl M. Cowdery, assistant registrar, have asked the older students of
the University to fill out the Vocational Interest Tests that were sent
out some weeks ago, and so far only about fifty per cent of the blanks
have been properly filled and mailed to the Psychology Department.
In the main, the students that have returned the blanks have all been
of one type, talit is, the more or less studious type, while the more
"hardy" men have not taken the trouble to accommodate the professors.
Professor Strong said yesterday that he wished answers from the "hard
boiled" fellows, the men who know little about the subject of psychology,
for in this way statistics about a more representative group can be
secured.
These blanks should be filled out honestly as well, for they are not
provided in order that students may demonstrate their collegiate humor.
The men carrying on this test desire information, not a good laugh.
When it is asked whether you prefer men who chew tobacco (one of the
questions) vou should answer correctly, for the question has been asked
for a reason. When some history students at Stanford were asked to
route the passage of a ship to the Great Lakes from Duluth to Mew
York, one young wit wrote that the ship was sunk just out ol Duluth.
That is very funny but is of no value in Vocational Interest 1 ests.
Professor Strong explained that, in taking the lest, different groups
of applicants mark the blanks in different ways. For example, all
ministers mark the tests in generally the same manner, and all engineers
in another. And the engineering and ministerial groups differ widely
from each other, thus enabling psychologists to tell what professions
men should follow.
When the results of these tests have been discovered, the department
will be of great use to the students of Stanford who are not certain of
their life occupations. By taking an hour off to till i nthe blanks carefully
that are in the hands of the students now, years will be saved for the
college men of the next decade.
