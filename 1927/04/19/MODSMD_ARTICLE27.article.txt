# No Freshmen, No Traditions
## 
### 
The abolition of the Lower Division should he tried at some of the
universities that are wasting their time worrying about the enforcement
of freshman discipline. 1 112 these universities are unable, 01 unwilling,
to do away with freshman traditions, just abolish the entire class and the
traditions are bound to go with it.
It is doubtful if even the most ardent supporters of the freshman
traditions would insist that these rules would be transferred to the
shoulders of the junior college graduate. It is queer the distinction
that can be drawn between a young man that is entering college as a
freshman and the one starting in as a junior, but such a distinction is
drawn-by all colleges where such traditions exist. On its very face, it is
inconsistent.
