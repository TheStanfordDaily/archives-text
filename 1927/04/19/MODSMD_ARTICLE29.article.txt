A NEW EPOCH
President Wilbur's announcement of
a definite policy in regard to the abo
lition of the lower division has raised
a number of questions in the minds of
persons interested in Stanford. Chiefly
these questions concern the probable
effect of the adoption of the proposed
policy upon athletics and undergradu
ate social life.
So far as athletics are concerned,
the problem is merely a matter of ad
justing eligibility requirements. The
solution should not be difficult to find.
Both Annapolis ana West Point have
faced the same issue and have made
satisfactory arrangements. At present
these institutions, while not strictly
graduate schools, because of the pe
culiarly specialized nature of the in
struction they offer, take in graduates
of other universities. These men are
allowed to participate in intercolle
giate competition. As an example in
point, Wilson, the great Army back of

| last year, played three years for Penn
before he entered the academy.
Student social life will probably un
dergo a reorganization. There is no
; reason why the present structure
i should necessarily collapse. Fraterni
ties and sororities should be able to
keep chapters at a university where
; the course of instruction will begin at
i the present junior year. As a matter of
I fact, a number of the present prob
' lems of such living groups would be
solved automatically by the increase
I in the age of the men and women
eligible for rushing.
It is the manifest duty of Stanford
students and alumni to co-operate in
this move, which is obviously intended
1 for the betterment of the university.
The administration will have its hands
full revising the curriculum. It is up
to those of us who already take an
| interest in extracurricular matters to
! see that the other side of business is
handled efficiently.
