The Editor, Sir:
The Spring Election being in the
offing, I wish to bring against the Stan
ford student body a charge of very evi
dent unfairness, both to certain of its
elected officers and to itself.
Suppose a business man wishes to
hire a stenographer, who is to do typ
ing and shorthand. Our business man
interviews a number bf applicants,
having each demonstrate her ability as
a typist, but not even mentioning
shorthand. He hires an excellent typ
ist. and then curses the poor girl when
he discovers that she has only the
vaguest notion of shorthand. Business
like? Not very.
And yet that is just the kind of
thing we of the student body do when
we select our yell leaders on the basis
of months of tryouts in leading yells,

[ and then, having selected them, order
I them to begin leading songs. The good
! yell leader may be equal to the very
I different task of leading a song; too
often, he is not.
We want to continue the custom of
singing at games and rallies. Let's
' take time at the U.S.C. meet next Sat
urday to see what these yell leader
tryoutees can do to a song.
—C. Sharpe Minor.
The Editor, Sir:
Is (here any good reason why who-
I ever is in charge of that sort of thing
; can't induce the telephone company
lo install directories of later vintage
than October 1920 in the Halls. There
are times when even a college man
| may want to call Palo Alto. —Union.
