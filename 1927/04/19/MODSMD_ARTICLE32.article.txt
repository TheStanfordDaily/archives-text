# G.H. STUART CHARGES U.S. FOREIGN POLICY IS CHAMELEON-LIKE
## Imperialism Will Occur in Caribbean as Long as Trade Continues 
### 
"Mexico has always been with us,"
says Professor Graham 11. Stuart, of the
Political Science department, "but Nica
ragua has just come into the focus of
vision of the man on the street. He has
suddenly discovered that the United States
has a chameleon-like foreign policy."
"The present problem is not new ; it is
merely a recurrence and will recur again,"
continues Professor Stuart. "Unfortu
nately this time the combination of trou
ble in Mexico and Nicaragua at the same
time, both colored with the red specter
of Bolshevism, was too much for the
State Department. It lost its head, issued
violent statements, and found all Latin
America and a good part of the United
'States rising in opposition."
"As long as we buv practically all our
bananas from Central America, most of
our sugar from Cuba, oil from Mexico,
and finance to a large extent all the trade
in this area from the" Rio Grande to
Panama, we are going to have trouble in
the Caribbean," lie goes on to say.
"The real problem is to recognize that
if this means imperialism we are im
perialistic and can't be otherwise; but we
can and should formulate our policy in
Washington and not on the battleships in
the Caribbean," he concludes. "Further
more, our policy should be such that its
own citizens could support it without
apologies, let alone the foreign relations
committee of the Senate. And if it is to
be successful it will have to depend upon
stronger support than playing off one
party against another in weak countries
like Nicaragua and it will have also to
avoid arousing the sentiment of Latin
America against us."
