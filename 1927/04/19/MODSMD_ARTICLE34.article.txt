# PRINCETON PROFESSOR DECLARES PHYSICS IS KEY TO ALL SCIENCES
## 
### 
"Physics is in the key position of
all the sciences," asserted Professor
Karl T. Compton, of the Physics de
partment at Princeton University, in
a recent address to students of that
university. "When a man has a general
grounding in physics, there are many
openings for him in allied subjects
such as chemistry, biology, and geo
logy.
' "R* search work can now be carried
out with three instruments," Professor
Compton continued, "a pencil, a piece
of paper, and a brain. This is because
1 ho subject has expanded past the field
of more experimental science and now
appeals to imagination and reason."
