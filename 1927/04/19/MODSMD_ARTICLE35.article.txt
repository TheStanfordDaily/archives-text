# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
It would be fine to be able to say i
that Lord Burghley is tbe overlord of
i Hurdlers, i < such is not the case.!
True, his lordship leaps in a likely,
though not faultless fashion, and he
was good enough to win two first
places in the Oxford-Cambridge track
meet recently, but 1 would hazard a
guess that there are at least a dozen !
athletes in the United States today
who could defeat the titled timber-i
topper in a 120-yard high-hurdle race.
But be that as it may, this very lik-'
able and very democratic young aristo
crat, "the scion of a noted English
family whose history dates back to
the Norman Conquest," will compete ;
in two special events at the Penn
relays a week from next Friday and j
Saturday on Franklin Field, Philadel
phia. The time of the Norman con- j
quest was 1066, and Lord Burghley!
runs in the 400-meter hurde race. Add- j

ing 400 to 1066, we have 1466 which,
if halved by a decimal and changed
into seconds, would still be shy of the
world's best time for the 120-yard high
hurdles, the other event in which His
Leaping Lordship competes. This rec
ord is 14.40, and is held by another
"nobleman," "The Earl of Thomson."
Two years ago "Dave," as he wants
to be called, won the 400-meter three
foot hurdle race soon after disembark
ing from a very rough passage over
the Atlantic. He failed to qualify in
the shorter race over the three and
one-half foot barriers, but proved him
self as good a loser on Saturday as he
v is winner on Friday, and returned
to his ancestral castle in Stamford
with one trophy and the memories of
many new friendships made. "His
Daveship" will, no doubt, be given a
rough voyage over the 400-meter hur
dles next week by Johnny Gibson, of

Fordham University, who lias no titles
except those won on the cinder-path,
but who is a duke, a lord, and a count
combined when it comes to'hurdling.
