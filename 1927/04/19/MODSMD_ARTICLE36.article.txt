# OREGON BASKETBALL COACH OPPOSES NEW DRIBBLING LIMITATION
## 
### 
"The new basketball rule limiting a
player to one dribble in a single play
will help percentage basketball, but at
the same time remove the spectacular
play for the spectators," Bob Hager,
Oregon Aggie coach, said recently
"Even though the change in rule may
strengthen my hand, I am opposed to
it. I believe the change will spoil the
game for the spectators.
"I have seen the game develop from
the stage where only a handful of
spectators were attracted to a game
which now taxes the capacity of the
country's largest pavilions," Hager
continued. "The dribble has done more
to make the game reach the high
popularity it now enjoys than any
other part of the sport. Basketball is
only a sport after all, and we may
differ with the East's ruling and cause
no difficulty thereby. The coast con
ference should refuse to accept this
'new-old' rule." Â®
