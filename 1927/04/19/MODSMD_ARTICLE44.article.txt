### 
Freshmen who enter Syracuse Uni
versity in the fall must present a personal
rccord and a scholastic record, Dr. Ross
Ilaker, acting director of admissions, has
recently stated. By the creation of a
Personnel Division, it is intended to se
cure a personal estimate of each appli
cant from those who have watched the
progress of the student in his high school
work. This estimate will be based on the
character of the student as well as on
Jiis mental aptitude.
