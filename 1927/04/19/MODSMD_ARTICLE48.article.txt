# POP WARNER DECLARES UNCERTAINTY OF POSTS WILL MAKE FOR STRONG VARSITY
## McCreery, Robesky Sole Remnants of 1926 Line; Bogue Only Man Missing from Last Fall's Backfield 
### Ben Maddox 
"No man on the squad can be abso
lutely sure of his position on the 1927
varsity," Coach Pop Warner declared
when interviewed in regard to spring
football practice, which is now in full
swing, and the outlook for next year.
"Leftovers from last season's' team
will meet with keen competition from
the new men, but this uncertainty
should develop a strong team. There
are several of equul merit trying for
each job. Stanford may expect a good
team next year, but I doubt if we will
have as strong a varsity in the fall
as we did in 1926. *
"Our whole line is gone, except for
Robesky and McCreery; the material
to replace it is fair. We will be just as
strong from tackle to tackle, but we i
cannot hope for such good ends as
Shipkey and Walker. The prospects
for guards and tackles, while lacking j
experience, should show up well as
forwards later in the season. With the
loss of Bogue, our best ground-gaining j
back, we will have no outstanding j
men, although other backfield men will
play again."
Harder Tries for End
In discussing the men who are out !
for the various positions, Coach War- i
ner said, "Harder is at present the j
best end candidate, and his experience i
as sub for Walker will serve him well. |
Vincenti, Moomaw, who has hereto-!
fore played tackle, Preston, of the 1926 J
freshman team, Worden, and Mont-!
gomery and Steinbeck, of the 1930 i
freshman squad, and several others j
look fairly good as ends.
"Freeman and Sellman are nearly
as good as the regular tackles last'
year, and so far have the call on these
positions. Artman, Everett, and Hein-!
ecke will give them a good battle, how
ever.
"For guards we will have Robesky
back, and he should be better this
year than last. Seraphim Post, who
was on the squad two years ago,
Kazanjian, Morley, Schultz, Doyle,
Macabee, and Ingram, all of whom
were out last year or the season be
fore, will be eligible. This does not
take into consideration the freshman
prospects, of which little is yet known.
McCreery May Return
"McCreery may return as center,
but he will have a hard time holding
the job over such men as Vermilya,
Cook, Davidson, who was a substitute
end last year, and Tcnipleman, of the
1930 team. Behind the line we will

| have Hyland, Wilton, Murphy, of last
i year's squad, and the freshmen at left
j halfback.
"Hill and Sims of the 1926 varsity
â–  are outstanding for right halfback, but
| Sims, who injured his knee badly in
' winter practice, may not be sufficiently
recovered by fall. The freshmen, in
cluding Frentrup, Simkins, and Mur
phy, all have more weight, and may
replace the older men for this rea
-1 son."
The change in rules making the
quarterback run with the ball will in
; fluence selection for this post, Coach
! Warner stated. "Quarterback candi
dates are scarcest of all," he continued,
| "but Post and Lewis look fairly good
I for quarter. Post, because of little ex
i perience in running with the ball, may
\ be more valuable in the line or back
! field.
Hoffman Good Passer
"Hoffman will have spirited competi
-1 tion to face in placing as fullback, be
! cause, despite his ability at forward
j passing, he lacks the crashing power
; and punting essential to the position.
' Fleishhacker, Smalling, of the 1925
! freshmen, Simkins, and Hobdy, of this
! year's frosh, will all be contenders for
I fullback. Jf Joseph and Patcliett re~
| turn, Patchett may be tried out at
i half or quarterback, because he is a
' little light for fullback," Coach Warner
| said.
| Spring practice is now in full swing,
! and most of the men who are not out
' for track and baseball are getting
| valuable experience. The coaches are
] now experimenting on a different style
of play than that used heretofore. In
I speaking of the new rules, W T arner
! stated: "They should prove more ad
> vantageous to Stanford, because our
offense uses double and triple passes,
| and there is more chance of fumbling
| when passes are not made. The new
| rules on the lateral and back pass will
| mean that we will be less likely to
lose the ball on these fumbles."
When questioned as to the possibil
ity of post-season games next season,
! Warner declared that no such games
were being contemplated at this time,
i "California will have a better backfield
{this year, and will improve all around
under Price's coaching," the football
mentor thinks. "As for U.S.C., they
have lost some good men but have
strong reserve material. If they use
their freshmen who were ineligible
i last year, they should develop some
| excellent players."
