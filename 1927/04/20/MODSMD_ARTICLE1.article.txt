and educator, will be on the Stanford
campus this afternoon to give a series
of readings, with comments and ex
planations, from his own poetry. He

Theatre.
Famous Poems
Besides his world-famous poem,
"The Man with the Hoe," Markham
has written several books of poetry
and prose. Perhaps his next most fa
mous poem is "Lincoln." "The Chil
dren in Bondage," a compilation of
magazine articles covering the whole
problem of child labor, and "California
the Wonderful," a descriptive book
about his native state, are his chief
prose works. In addition, he spent
twelve years in selecting and editing
Remarkable Pages from Thomas Lake
Harris.
Two Famous Poems
Many will recognize the opening
lines of "The Man with a Hoe," which
describe the peasant in Millett's fa
mous painting of that name:
"Bowed by the weight of centuries
he leans
Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,
The emptiness of ages in his face,
And on his back the burden of the
world."
The end of his poem, "Lincoln," is
equally well-known:
"And when he fell in whirlwind, he
went down
As when a lordly cedar, green with
boughs,
Goes down with a great shout upon
the hills,
And leaves a lonesome place against
the sky."
Led Colorful Life
Markham has led a colorful life.
During his boyhood in California he
worked variously at farming, black
smithing, and herding cattle and sheep.
He was educated at the San Jose Nor
mal School and has received degrees
from two Western colleges. He has
held the position of superintendent of
public schools of California. He is also
a member of the National Institute of
Arts and Letters, and honorary presi
dent of the Poetry Society of America.
He gave a baccalaureate sermon at
Stanford in 1897, on the subject, "The
Social Conscience."
