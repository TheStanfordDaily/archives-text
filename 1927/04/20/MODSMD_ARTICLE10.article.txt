# Three Intramural Baseball Rounds End As Foretold; One Upsets Dope
## 
### 
Breakers 12, Sigma Chi 0
Theta Chi 19, El Cuadro 2
Delta Tail Delta 7, Encina II 0
(default)
El Campo 7, Kappa Alpha 3
All intramural games finished ac
cording to advance dope with the ex
ception of the upset which Kappa
Alpha received from El Campo when
the fraternity men, with enough runs
choked off at third base to win several
ball games, played in a bad slump.
Breakers Score
Breakers, improving at every start,
with a 12 to 0 win over Sigma Chi,
their rivals of the intramural basket
ball series, has firmly established
itself as a serious contender for title
honors in their league. Rodney George,
a speedy hurler with a good change
of pace, allowed the Sigma Chi nine
only three hits, two of which were col
lected with a single and a double, in
four times at bat. At the same time
his teammates were pounding Adams
for ten bingles, errors contributing to
swell the mass of runs crossing the
plate.
Theta Chi Wins
Theta Chi continued its victorious
record, keeping its slate clean by eas
ily winning from El Cuadro, 19 to 2.
Bert Green and Helmke, handling the
ball for the Row men, performed in
good style, with the two runs of the
club scored as a result of errors in
the infield. The consistent hitting by
the victors has marked then' games
to date, and with the Breakers they
appear to be the most formidable nine
on the field.
The freshmen of Encina II forfeited
New rules governing classes in
to Delta Tau Delta by failure to put
the required number of men on the
field, but played a four-inning practice
game during which the fraternity
piled up a big lead.
Surprise Act
The defeat of Kappa Alpha, who
held the fast-traveling Theta Chi team
to a 9 to 8 victory last week, was the
surprise act of the afternoon. The club
team started the game with a bang
when Gardner hit a home run in the
first half of the first inning with two
men on the bases. Kappa Alpha threat
ened in every inning, getting men on
the bags by hits and errors, but lacked
the extra punch to bring them over
the home plate on various occasions.
"Tiny" Sellman on the mound for the
losers, was hit often and hard, and
was replaced by Morrill, who fared
little better.
Third Week Begins
These games marked the beginning
of the third week of the present sea
son, leaving two more weeks of pre
liminary games before the champions
of the respective leagues are crowned.
