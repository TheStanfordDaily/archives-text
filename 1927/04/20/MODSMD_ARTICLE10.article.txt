All intramural games finished ac
cording to advance dope with the ex
ception of the upset which Kappa
Alpha received from El Campo when
the fraternity men, with enough runs
choked off at third base to win several
ball games, played in a bad slump.
Breakers Score
Breakers, improving at every start,
with a 12 to 0 win over Sigma Chi,
their rivals of the intramural basket
ball series, has firmly established
itself as a serious contender for title
honors in their league. Rodney George,
a speedy hurler with a good change
of pace, allowed the Sigma Chi nine
only three hits, two of which were col
lected with a single and a double, in
four times at bat. At the same time
his teammates were pounding Adams
for ten bingles, errors contributing to
swell the mass of runs crossing the
plate.
Theta Chi Wins
Theta Chi continued its victorious
record, keeping its slate clean by eas
ily winning from El Cuadro, 19 to 2.
Bert Green and Helmke, handling the
ball for the Row men, performed in
good style, with the two runs of the
club scored as a result of errors in
the infield. The consistent hitting by
the victors has marked then' games
to date, and with the Breakers they
appear to be the most formidable nine
on the field.
