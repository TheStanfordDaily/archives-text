# MURAL HORSESHOE SCHEDULE TO BEGIN EARLY NEXT MONTH
## 
### 
Intramural horseshoes will start on
May 2, C. W. Davis, director of intra
mural athletics, announced yesterday.
This will be the first time that this
sport has been included in the intra
mural group. Regulation courts will be
built next to the gym on the site for
merly occupied by the varsity tennis
courts.
Davis advises living groups to lay
out regulation size courses to use in
practice. The distance between the
stakes should be forty feet. Regulation
shoes may be secured at the gym.
In scoring, a ringer counts three
points. A leaner counts only one point.
Any shoe must be within six inches
to count at all. If one player throws
a ringer over an opponent's ringer
they cancel each other instead of
counting three points for each person.
