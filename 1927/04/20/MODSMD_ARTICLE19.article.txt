# CONSTITUTION DRAFT SECURES APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE BODY
## Article Concerning Officers Referred for Action to Revision Committee 
### 
Approval of all but one provision
was given to the draft of the tenta
tive A.SS.U. constitution, submitted by
the revision body, by the Executive
Committee at its meeting last night.
The mooted provision involved the
advisability of including the Union |
Board of Governors, the Board of Ath
letic Control, and the offices of as
sistant yell leader in the section of
the document on officers of the student
body. The matter was referred back
to the Constitution Committee for con- ]
sideration.
Since representatives on these'
Boards and two assistant yell leaders
are elected by the student body, the
Executive Committee deemed it ad
visable to have some provision in the
Constitution relating to their selec
tion.
Unqualified acceptance of the docu
ment as submitted by the revision
committee, with the exception of this
provision in the section on elections
and minor changes in the granting of
awards for boxing and wrestling, was
made. This change provides that a
man competing in half or more of the
intercollegiate matches in case Cali
fornia is not met, shall be granted a
circle German S.
By-laws of the student body and
charters of the Dramatic Council, Pub
lications Council, and Rally Committee
will be submitted to the Executive
Committee for approval at its meet
ing next week. The date for the spe
cial election for the purpose of voting
on the Constitution will also be set
at that time.
Following are the notes:
M.S.C. That the following dates be
granted: April 24, Toyon Club Musi
cale; May 20, Delta Chi formal; June
3, Alpha Phi formal.
M.S.C. That the proposed constitu
tion be approved, but that the question
of including the Union Board of Gov
ernors, the Board of Athletic Control,
and the offices of the assistant yell
leaders be referred back to the Con
stitution Committee for consideration.
