versity when the two track and field
teams compete against each other next
Saturday afternoon in what promises

New Men Developed
For they realize that the Trojans
won the national championship last
year. Although several of the stars of
the 1926 team are out of collegiate
competition, Southern California sup
porters point to new men developed ia
nearly all of the events where ath
letes were lost by graduation.
The heaviest loss suffered by the
Trojans was the graduation of Bud
Houser, world's discus throw record
holder and champion shot putter. The
Cardinals figure on scoring heavily in
these two events. A complete shutout
in the shot, and at least a first and a
third in the discus will add to the
Stanford total.

Charley Borah, Captain Ed House,
Herschel Smith, and Johnny Parsons
form a quartet of sprinters who are
counted on to score heavily in their
events. Borah is easily the class of
the coast in both of the dashes. House
has been consistently second to
Borah. Smith strives for the third
point in the hundred, and Parsons
runs the two-twenty.
Fred Richman's showing last Satur
day, combined with Johnny Lauritzen's
development this spring, however,
gives Stanford followers a hope for
some points, at least, in the sprints.
