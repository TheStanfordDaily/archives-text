# Prudery
## 
### 
Germany has decided that the study of biology in mixed classes is
immodest. Or, in other words, Germany 1-yis decided that the study of
life, the study of the why of things, is immodest, and should never be
mentioned when one of the opposite sex is present.
Such prudery is altogether wrong. College students should he able
to discuss and study biology and similar subjects, for they are old
enough to be introduced into the mysteries of life. It is only when such
subjects are talked about in ignorance that there is any semblance of
vulgarity connected with them. The very large majority of college men
and women are capable of studying biology with clean minds.
There are many today who still believe that the youth should be kept
in ignorance of the world and the life of the world. But such people
belong to the sixteenth century, when men and women were not allowed
to learn anything except how to make a living without offending, the
church or the king. As Lafcadio I learn said, "Innocence and youth are
by no means all that make up the best attributes of women; character is
more than innocence."
Judge Ben l>. Lindsey, who is considered by prominent educators
throughout the country as the writer of one of the best books ever
written about the situation among youth of college age, says in one part
of the account: "How lamentable that our young folks are ridden by the
inherited tradition that there is something shameful and immoral in the
sexual act itself, even when prompted by sincere love and emotional
exaltation. How unfortunate that they should have been made blind to
the fact that the problem here is not one of outwardly imposed morals,
but rather of voluntary internal restraints on the conduct of individuals
that will serve to maintain human society on a workable basis窶馬ot a
taboo which forbids this or that kind of conduct, but an enlightened
freedonrwhich confers, like a crown of life, the liberty and the ability
to do right."
It is the belief of Judge Lindsey that whenever youngsters have a
false and rotten idea they have probably inherited it as one of the super
stitions and traditions that have enslaved their elders; and that as a rule
whenever they have an honest, candid, clear-thinking moment, they have
dug it up for themselves.
Students often gather together in "bull" sessions to discuss the prob
lems of existence, and the talkers in these groups are sincere and clean
minded. Such gatherings are beneficial, and how much more so are
courses on the same subject when taught by college professors.

dug it up for themselves.
Students often gather together in "bull" sessions to discuss the prob
lems of existence, and the talkers in these groups are sincere and clean
minded. Such gatherings are beneficial, and how much more so are
courses on the same subject when taught by college professors.
Germany has decided that the study of biology in mixed classes is
immodest. Or, in other words, Germany 1-yis decided that the study of
life, the study of the why of things, is immodest, and should never be
mentioned when one of the opposite sex is present.
Such prudery is altogether wrong. College students should he able
to discuss and study biology and similar subjects, for they are old
enough to be introduced into the mysteries of life. It is only when such
subjects are talked about in ignorance that there is any semblance of
vulgarity connected with them. The very large majority of college men
and women are capable of studying biology with clean minds.
There are many today who still believe that the youth should be kept
in ignorance of the world and the life of the world. But such people
belong to the sixteenth century, when men and women were not allowed
to learn anything except how to make a living without offending, the
church or the king. As Lafcadio I learn said, "Innocence and youth are
by no means all that make up the best attributes of women; character is
more than innocence."
Judge Ben l>. Lindsey, who is considered by prominent educators
throughout the country as the writer of one of the best books ever
written about the situation among youth of college age, says in one part
of the account: "How lamentable that our young folks are ridden by the
inherited tradition that there is something shameful and immoral in the
sexual act itself, even when prompted by sincere love and emotional
exaltation. How unfortunate that they should have been made blind to
the fact that the problem here is not one of outwardly imposed morals,
but rather of voluntary internal restraints on the conduct of individuals
that will serve to maintain human society on a workable basis窶馬ot a
taboo which forbids this or that kind of conduct, but an enlightened
freedonrwhich confers, like a crown of life, the liberty and the ability
to do right."
It is the belief of Judge Lindsey that whenever youngsters have a
false and rotten idea they have probably inherited it as one of the super
stitions and traditions that have enslaved their elders; and that as a rule
whenever they have an honest, candid, clear-thinking moment, they have
dug it up for themselves.
