What is the up-to-date girl wearing in the form of head-dress this
year? During the last decade the college girls were cutting off their
golden locks to keep up with the styles, but that is very old-fashioned in
this year of 1927.
Xow for instance at Vassar College, of the twenty-two girls selected
to carry the daisy chain at the annual commencement exercises this year,
but five have bobbed hair. Just five relics left of the good old days
when bobbed hair was the height of correctness. The carrying of the
daisy chain is considered the highest honor that can come to a Yassar
student, and consequently only the leaders of the college are chosen.
Mobbed hair is going out at Cloudier College, too. Tiny knots at the
back of the head are rapidly taking the place of the shaven neck, and
the girl with shingled hair is now the exception rather than the rule.
The girls declare, however, that the long hair does not mean that they
are going back to old-fashioned customs of conduct.
"We can be just as flapperish." said one fair student, "with long hair
;is with the bob. We will just look different, that is all."
So girls put away the shears, and get out the hair restorer, and keep
up with the times.
