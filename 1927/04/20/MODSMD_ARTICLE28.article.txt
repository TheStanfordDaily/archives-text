A recent Associated Press dispatch
from Princeton University seems to
deserve reprinting in full despite the
fact that Princeton news has Hooded
the press for some few months:
"Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jeffer
son, Benjamin Franklin, and Grover
Cleveland would never have received
degrees from modern American uni
versities in the opinion of Professor
Walter L. Whittlesey, of the politics
faculty of Princeton University.
"'lt is not very likely that Lincoln
would have come to college today,'
Professor Whittlesey said, 'for the cost
would have been prohibitive. More
over, a mind like his would have out
run all bounds and been unwelcome in
the average university.'
"The mind of Cleveland, who arrived
at conclusions deliberately, and well,
was too slow to answer the glibness
demanded by educators today, accord
ing to Professor Whittlesey.
"Jefferson and Franklin would have
been 'fired,' early in their college
careers, Professor Whittlesey believes,
because they probably would not have
submitted to the restraint placed upon
present day students.
"College entrance examinations are
made for the student with a good

memory and the 'quick-ready-to-wear, i
served hot-with-mustard,' type of mind, 1
according to Professor Whittlesey.
" 'If the tendency of the colleges to
turn out a uniform type of mind con- j
Unites,' he said, 'their graduates will
soon be nothing but Ph.D.'s. True in-,
sti tut ions of learning should send forth j
many men and women into every walk i
of life from acting to zoo-keeping'." i
These remarks constitute a consider
able indictment against American uni
versities, already the subject of a:
great deal of well-grounded criticism. |
The American tendency toward mass
production has struck the universities, i
and there is really little encourage- j
ment of initiative and individuality.
Professor Whittlesey has overlooked ;
one point, a point of enormous im- j
portance. Initiative and individuality'
thrive quite well without encourage- [
ment. Degrees from American univer-1
sities are today remarkably scarce 1
among the men who dominate Ameri
can life, it is true. Hut is it anything
to worry about? Is it not a condition j
that has always prevailed?
