Comes now "The Whispering Gal
lery," by an ex-diplomat, and alleges
that Britain's proud and great are not
what they seem. Mr. Cecil Rhodes
represented as behaving like a fish
wife; Lord Kitchener pictured as say
ing uncomplimentary things behind his
hand (if that is a crime); Gen. Towns
hend of Kut as an infant mind in a
military uniform (we refrain here
from the plain Anglo-Saxon); and
many royal and ex-royal personages
honored with left-hand decorations.
Most amusing are those parts of
the book (and it is amusing, facts or
no facts), that have to do with Rud
yard Kipling, G. Bernard Shaw, Arnold
Bennett, Hilaire Belloc, and other
literary light. Mr. Kipling, especially,
is presented as the central figure in
two or three situations that would
make anybody chortle.
Upshot of all this: no more copies
to be had in England for any number
of shillings. But wait —what about
America? Certainly, sir, published by
Boni & Liveright. Bulletin! The
American publishers have just written

i to say that in spite of the action in
Great Britain they intend to sit tight.
"A loud denial," they say (referring to j
the British howls that greeted the ;
book) "does not necessarily,disprove j
facts." Rude or not, the book is au
thentic, is their contention. So there!
