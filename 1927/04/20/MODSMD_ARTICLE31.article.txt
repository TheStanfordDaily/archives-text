# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
In all the excitement over the grand
and gala opening of the New Giants at
the Polo Grounds today, there is one
athlete who should not be overlooked
—Edd J. Rousli. The cynosure of all
eyes will undoubtedly be the world
famous stock and bond man, Rogers
Hornsby, but do not forget that there
are others worthy of notice in the
team that McGraw has put together
for his jubilee pennant bid. Burleigh
Grimes, George Harper, A1 Devormer,
and Bevo Le Bourveau, are well worth
a couple of looks apiece, and Edd
Rousli is worth five or six. It wouldn't
surprise me at all if Roush stole all
of Hornsby's thunder ifi today's game,
for he has been playing superlative
ball for years without getting half the
credit that is due him.
Even Roush's record since 1916, ;
when he was traded with the immortal
"Matty" and Bill McKechnie to the j
Reds for Her'og and Wade Killifer, j
does not do him justice. Ten straight j
years with Cincinnati and only batting !
as low as .321 once, and that year j
leading his league anyway, and for
the second time! Never has the versa-!

I tile Edd made 200 hits or scored 100
runs in one season, yet his yearly
! average is always close to those fig
ures,and for four straight years with
t the Reds he batted .350.
These figures by themselves don't
[ show that Roush finished second or
third in batting in the National League
j on three occasions, once losing the
leadership of the circuit to Zack Wheat
j only because a game in which he made
| three hits was thrown out. Nor do
| they show that the the ball
park at Cincinnati, where each year
| he had to play half the season's games,
j certainly did not help him get any
i hits, whereas certain other batters
were aided greatly by the short
I fences in their home parks.
John McGraw may have acquired a
! Giant rival for Babe Ruth when he got
j Rogers Hornsby, but F. C. Lane, in
j the "Baseball Magazine," says that the
j quiet, studious, persevering Roush,
| who is conspicuously lacking in the
I fine arts of showmanship, is a greater
outfielder than Babe Ruth ever will be,
j a better base-runner, and a more
j scientific batter!

outfielder than Babe Ruth ever will be,
j a better base-runner, and a more
j scientific batter!


He Fills a Big Gap
In all the excitement over the grand
and gala opening of the New Giants at
the Polo Grounds today, there is one
athlete who should not be overlooked
—Edd J. Rousli. The cynosure of all
eyes will undoubtedly be the world
famous stock and bond man, Rogers
Hornsby, but do not forget that there
are others worthy of notice in the
team that McGraw has put together
for his jubilee pennant bid. Burleigh
Grimes, George Harper, A1 Devormer,
and Bevo Le Bourveau, are well worth
a couple of looks apiece, and Edd
Rousli is worth five or six. It wouldn't
surprise me at all if Roush stole all
of Hornsby's thunder ifi today's game,
for he has been playing superlative
ball for years without getting half the
credit that is due him.
Even Roush's record since 1916, ;
when he was traded with the immortal
"Matty" and Bill McKechnie to the j
Reds for Her'og and Wade Killifer, j
does not do him justice. Ten straight j
years with Cincinnati and only batting !
as low as .321 once, and that year j
leading his league anyway, and for
the second time! Never has the versa-!

I tile Edd made 200 hits or scored 100
runs in one season, yet his yearly
! average is always close to those fig
ures,and for four straight years with
t the Reds he batted .350.
These figures by themselves don't
[ show that Roush finished second or
third in batting in the National League
j on three occasions, once losing the
leadership of the circuit to Zack Wheat
j only because a game in which he made
| three hits was thrown out. Nor do
| they show that the the ball
park at Cincinnati, where each year
| he had to play half the season's games,
j certainly did not help him get any
i hits, whereas certain other batters
were aided greatly by the short
I fences in their home parks.
John McGraw may have acquired a
! Giant rival for Babe Ruth when he got
j Rogers Hornsby, but F. C. Lane, in
j the "Baseball Magazine," says that the
j quiet, studious, persevering Roush,
| who is conspicuously lacking in the
I fine arts of showmanship, is a greater
outfielder than Babe Ruth ever will be,
j a better base-runner, and a more
j scientific batter!
