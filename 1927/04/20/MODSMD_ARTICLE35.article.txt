In an effort to collect data, these I
tests have been sent to the seniors '
and graduate students of the Univer- '
sitv. The number mailed approximated i
about a thousand. Out of these, only !
540 have been returned to date, 43 per j
cent of the seniors and 52 per cent of
the graduate students complying with i
the request.
Professor Strong said yesterday that I
it is necessary t# have the blanks re- \
turned to him at once. "For the most i
part," he said, "those students who |
have returned the tests are those who i
are interested in psychology, and thus J
we are getting information about only j
one kind of student. What we want j
are answers from the 'hard-boiled' fel- j
lows, the men who know little about j
the subject, for in this way can we i
get statistics about a more representa
tive group.
Better Data Needed
"There are still some professions," j
he remarked, "in which it is difficult j
to distinguish one group from the j
other in these tests, and it is for this j
that we need more perfect data. So i
we desire the co-operation of all those !
men to whom we sent the tests."
The object of Professor Strong in :
giving these tests is to follow them I
up later and check up on the men
when they are in business, and com
pare their business successes and plac-;
ings in the tests.
