# EQUILIBRIUM ORGAN DISCOVERED AT U.C.
## 
### 
One of the chief organs enabling
animals, probably including man, to
maintain their equilibrium and orien
tate themselves even when blindfold,
ed, has been definitely determined to
be the "utriculum otolith," a tiny mass
of pasty white substance located near
the central chamber of the inner ear.
Announcement of this fact has just
been made by Dr. S. S. Maxwell, chair
man of the division of physiology at
the University of California, as a re
sult of extensive experiments on the
dogfish and the frog, which proved
also that other otoliths have nothing
to do with this function.
