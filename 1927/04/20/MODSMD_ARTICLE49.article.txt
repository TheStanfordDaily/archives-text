I out in his lecture in the Little Theatre i
last night that the Renaissance, "a
period of swift and sweeping change,"
resembles ours in all fundamental re-1
spects and is therefore valuable for!
determining present social factors.
Three Forpe Act
"The main forces actuating human
society," said Professor Hulme, "are
three: changes in laws and institu
tions, making inventions and discov
eries, and change in the ideal of life."
During the Renaissance, he said, the
first force was evident in the move
ment from rural to urban life, in the
tendency of intellect to take prece
dence over aristocracy, and in the
turning from implicit faith to reason,
though under the last point he added,
"I still insist that we're in the Dark

Ages—the modern world has dawned
yet only for a few.
Forces in Society Today
"These forces can be found in so«
ciety today. The greatest change in
laws and institutions has been the
coming of democracy; though now we
are simply trying its machinery and
must give it a longer time for it to
demonstrate itself. Everyone knows
the place of modern inventions in this
Age of Iron. But the most potent of
all the forces is the last, whereby man
has become more concerned wiih his
fellowmen. Social service is the pres
ent man's religion."
