squad are accompanied by Professor
Takasugi and Coach T. Ichioka, while
they will be led in the Stanford series
by Captain T. Himuro. While the
itinerary of the university men is
made according to possible baseball
games, one of the main purposes of
the tour is to make an educational
study of America. Following the games
here, the Japanese will travel to Los
Angeles, and will probably play the

Arriving on the campus Monday
evening, the Waseda squad held its
first practice session yesterday after
noon. Judging from appearances, the
Japanese have more class 1 than any
team playing on the local diamond
this year, and the Cardinals will have
to hustle to win.
The best work of the practice was
displayed by the Waseda outfield, the
diminutive Nipponese showing speed
and judgment in catching flies. Two
home runs were made in batting prac
tice, indicating great strength at the
bat. The Waseda third baseman, who
is known as "the Babe Ruth of Japan,"
lived up to his name and hit consist
ently in practice.
It is probable that Coach Harry Wol
ter will start John Sobieski in the box
for Stanford in the first game, with
Captain Collins pitching in Saturday's
contest. Cook Sypher will receive in
both games, and the remainder of the
lineup will be the same as that used
in association games this season.
