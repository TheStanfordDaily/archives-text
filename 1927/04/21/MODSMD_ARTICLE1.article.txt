# FINAL DECISION ON ENDOWMENT SET FOR TODAY
## Insurance Policies System Is Found Unsatisfactory By Committee NEW PLAN WORKED OUT Senior Meeting Scheduled For Discussion of Problem 
### 
Seniors will meet in Room 214 today
at 12:45 to make a definite decision on
the report of the Class Endowment
committee. A plan new to the Stanford
campus will be submitted by the com
mittee and will provide for all seniors
to sign a pledge to contribute an op
tional fixed amount each year to an
endowment fund. Samples of the Sen
ior Week Program and commencement
announcements also will be displayed
«t the meeting.
Each year the senior class has fol
lowed the custom of providing an en
dowment fund for the University and
for the past few years various kinds
of insurance plans have been used. At
the outset the committee branded this
system as impractical, and has at
tempted to establish a more satisfac
tory plan. The new idea gives the trus
tees an opportunity to use the money
whenever necessary instead of wait
ing for the policies to mature.
Payments Made Easier
The plan also gives the member of
the class an opportunity to revoke any
payment in case of inability to pay,
and on the other hand offers the oppor
tunity to contribute as much as is
desired each year.
The money is handled by the Board
of Trustees under an account separate
from the University and is known as
the 1927 Class Fund.
A definite decision will be made to
day and the verdict of those present
if favorable will set the solicitors to
work at once.
The Senior Week Program and An
nouncements committee plans to start
a sales campaign next Monday, and
will display the samples at the meet
ing. All sales will lie made in advance
this year and only the number pur
chased by the seniors during the two
£
week campaign will be ordered.
