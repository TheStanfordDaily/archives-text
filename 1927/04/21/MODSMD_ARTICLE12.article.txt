# CARDS HEADED FOR IC-4A TRACK TITLE
## Results of U.S.C. Meet Will Determine Chances in National Contest 
### Joe Carroll 
Last year the University of Southern
California track team came up to
Stanford doped to lose. They won, 67
to 64. Later they captured the IC-4A
national title.
The L.A.A.C. team was the only one
besides the Trojan outfit to defeat the
1926 Cardinals. Already the Stanford
squad has beaten L.A.A.C.
Now the Cardinals have turned to
the meet with the Trojans. Here again
is an opportunity to secure revenge for
last year's defeat.
May Win IC-4A
Also, the Stanford team will prob
ably prove by its showing Saturday
that it possesses point scoroj-s enough
to win the IC-4A championship if it
takes the trip back East next month.
The showings made last Saturday by
the Trojans at the A.A.U. champion
ships in Los Angeles were none too
convincing for the greater part.
The sprinters, however, performed
up to expectations. Charley Borah,
Captain Ed House, Weldon Draper,
Johnny Parsons, and Herchel Smith
will make the going hard for the Stan
ford pair, Fred Ricliman and Johnny
Lauritzen.
Morton Kaer turned in a 23.8 sec
onds flight of low hurdles. Clarence
West, however, who did 25 seconds
in the face of a strong wind, ran his
best race this season. He should give
Kaer a stiff fight. Third place will be
between Ross Nichols and Alex Gra
ham. Cliff Reynolds should be in shape
for a real flight of high hurdles, fight
ing for first with Nichols. Graham and
West will be striving for third here.
Great Dual Meet
The greatest dual meet of the year
â€”this is easily predicted. With the
Stanford team headed for the national
title, and with U.S.C. rated as its
strongest opponent, this meeting will
provide a line upon further results
this season.
