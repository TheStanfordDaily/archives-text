# STANFORD BASEBALL TEAM OPENS SERIES WITH WASEDA NINE
## Japanese in Fast Workout, Knock Out Four Homers In Practice Game 
### 
Led Captain Steve Collins, the
Stanford varsity baseball team will
meet the Waseda University nine on
the Stanford diamond at 3 o'clock this
afternoon. The contest will be the first
of a two-game series with the boys
from Tokyo, Japan, the second tussle
being scheduled for Saturday after
noon.
If speed has anything to do with
this afternoon's contest, Coach Harry
Wolter's men will have their hands
full, for the Japanese appear to be
the fastest and cleverest<fmtflt seen on
the local diamond this year. Practice
sessions have also disclosed plenty of
power in hitting, the feature of yes
terday's workout being four home
runs made by one of the visiting
pitchers. Captain T. Himuro at third
base is one of the heaviest hitters on
the squad, and brings a reputation of
being the home run king of Japan.
Infield Good
The Waseda infield combination
works with clock-like precision, com
pleting all its play in snappy fashion
and making few errors. In the out
field Coach T. Ichioka has three of
the best fly-chasers seen around Stan
ford in some time. The visiting team's
battery is undecided, but Coach lichi
oka will make his choice from five
regular pitchers.
Coach Wolter also ran his men
through a short practice yesterday,
drilling them on hitting. Captain Col
lins is Wolter's choice to start on the
mound for Stanford tomorrow, while
John Sobieski will be used Saturday.
Bob Philippi will serve in his regular
capacity of relief man. The Cardinal
infield will be composed of Maguire
at first base, Garibaldi second base,
Busch shortstop, and Rogers third
base. Harder will replace Rogers if
Coach Wolter sends in a pinch hitter
for Rogers during the contest.
Sypher to Catch
The same Stanford outfield combina
tion of Stewart, Wilton, and Nissen
will .start the game, while Cook
Sypher will catch. With the regular
season over, Coach Wolter will prob
ably use a few substitutes if the op
portunity is afforded, although no
chances will be taken.
If the Cardinal batters can deliver
in the pinches this afternoon, the
Waseda pitchers will have plenty
about which to worry. Inability to hit
will undoubtedly mean defeat for
Stanford, since the invaders boast a
record of few losses this season.

mound for Stanford tomorrow, while
John Sobieski will be used Saturday.
Bob Philippi will serve in his regular
capacity of relief man. The Cardinal
infield will be composed of Maguire
at first base, Garibaldi second base,
Busch shortstop, and Rogers third
base. Harder will replace Rogers if
Coach Wolter sends in a pinch hitter
for Rogers during the contest.
Sypher to Catch
The same Stanford outfield combina
tion of Stewart, Wilton, and Nissen
will .start the game, while Cook
Sypher will catch. With the regular
season over, Coach Wolter will prob
ably use a few substitutes if the op
portunity is afforded, although no
chances will be taken.
If the Cardinal batters can deliver
in the pinches this afternoon, the
Waseda pitchers will have plenty
about which to worry. Inability to hit
will undoubtedly mean defeat for
Stanford, since the invaders boast a
record of few losses this season.
Led Captain Steve Collins, the
Stanford varsity baseball team will
meet the Waseda University nine on
the Stanford diamond at 3 o'clock this
afternoon. The contest will be the first
of a two-game series with the boys
from Tokyo, Japan, the second tussle
being scheduled for Saturday after
noon.
If speed has anything to do with
this afternoon's contest, Coach Harry
Wolter's men will have their hands
full, for the Japanese appear to be
the fastest and cleverest<fmtflt seen on
the local diamond this year. Practice
sessions have also disclosed plenty of
power in hitting, the feature of yes
terday's workout being four home
runs made by one of the visiting
pitchers. Captain T. Himuro at third
base is one of the heaviest hitters on
the squad, and brings a reputation of
being the home run king of Japan.
Infield Good
The Waseda infield combination
works with clock-like precision, com
pleting all its play in snappy fashion
and making few errors. In the out
field Coach T. Ichioka has three of
the best fly-chasers seen around Stan
ford in some time. The visiting team's
battery is undecided, but Coach lichi
oka will make his choice from five
regular pitchers.
Coach Wolter also ran his men
through a short practice yesterday,
drilling them on hitting. Captain Col
lins is Wolter's choice to start on the
mound for Stanford tomorrow, while
John Sobieski will be used Saturday.
