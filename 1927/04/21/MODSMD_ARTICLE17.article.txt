New rules for making up absences
in physical education have
been posted on the bulletin board
of Encina Gym by Dr. T. A.
Storey, director of physical edu
cation. All men enrolled in gym
classes are asked to examine
tUÂ«>se very carefully. Chief among
these is that If an absence in
curred in a physical education
class is not made up by the week
following the absence, a minus
will be given for the quarter's
work.
