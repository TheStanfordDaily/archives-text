# Edwin Markham Charms Audience With Wit, Poetry
## 
### 
Charming his audience with flashes
of kindly humor and bits of trenchant
criticism, Edwin Markham, 75-year-old
California poet, read selections from
his own poems and commented on
poetry in general yesterday afternoon.
So large an audience had gathered to
hear hini that the Assembly Hall had
to be substituted for the Little Thea
tre, where he had been scheduled to
speak.
"Poetry springs out of man's think
ing heart," he said. "It does not exist
primarily for the thought—prose does
that. Thought is only the basis for
emotions in poetry.
"At the head of all the arts is reli
gion; when clearly understood, it is
the art of life. Ileally, though, there is
only one art and one attempt to ex
press its wonder: poetry, painting,
music, and sculpture are its languages.
Poetry goes to the center of man.
Science lays the groundwork for
poetry, but poetry begins where sci
ence ends."
Markham warned against being di*
I (lactic in poetry, saying that the poet
"must never directly preach—only by
innuendo and insinuation," In an at
tempt to define poetry, he quoted au
thors from the ancient Persian who
i said that poetry attempted to "make
! apparent the unapparent," through
Aristotle, Bacon, and Poe, to Shakes
peare, whose description beginning,
, "The poet is of imagination all com
-1 pact " Markham considers the best
; of all definitions.
He commented in passing on several
; literary figures. Of Poe he seemed par
' ticularly fond, saying that he was "the
greatest literary critic America has
' villified by jealous rivals. He was a
j villified" by jealous rivals. He was a
1 high-minded gentleman with a pro
j found respect for women. Although he
j was narrow in his attack on life, what
, he did see, he saw beautifully." Emer
son he considered "perhaps the great
j est thinker in his line that America
; has produced."
The poet read thirteen of his own
poems. Best-received of his minor
: poems were "Child of My Heart," writ
. ten about his son Virgil when he was
i four years old, at what Markham
; called "an abbreviated omnipresence";
I "What Am I, A Man Or a Moth?"
| which William Dean Howells once de
i scribed as touching the deepest prob-
J lem of philosophy; and a ballad about
j the French balladist, Villon, in which
j the last line is "A man is one, but the
Fates are three."
! Markham commented variously on
j others of his poems; some of his re
marks follow: "Our real business is to
: make men, to make character." "Two
j thirds of the poetry in the world is
based on the effect of nature on man's
j soul." "Every line of poetry is death
less; that is the miracle of poetry."
j "Art takes the most tragic incidents
| of life and turns them into a beautiful
thing—consider the works of Homer
1 and Shakespeare."

Charming his audience with flashes
of kindly humor and bits of trenchant
criticism, Edwin Markham, 75-year-old
California poet, read selections from
his own poems and commented on
poetry in general yesterday afternoon.
So large an audience had gathered to
hear hini that the Assembly Hall had
to be substituted for the Little Thea
tre, where he had been scheduled to
speak.
"Poetry springs out of man's think
ing heart," he said. "It does not exist
primarily for the thought—prose does
that. Thought is only the basis for
emotions in poetry.
"At the head of all the arts is reli
gion; when clearly understood, it is
the art of life. Ileally, though, there is
only one art and one attempt to ex
press its wonder: poetry, painting,
music, and sculpture are its languages.
Poetry goes to the center of man.
Science lays the groundwork for
poetry, but poetry begins where sci
ence ends."
Markham warned against being di*
I (lactic in poetry, saying that the poet
"must never directly preach—only by
innuendo and insinuation," In an at
tempt to define poetry, he quoted au
thors from the ancient Persian who
i said that poetry attempted to "make
! apparent the unapparent," through
Aristotle, Bacon, and Poe, to Shakes
peare, whose description beginning,
, "The poet is of imagination all com
