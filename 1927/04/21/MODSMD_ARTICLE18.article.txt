# Edwin Markham Charms Audience With Wit, Poetry
## 
### 
Charming his audience with flashes
of kindly humor and bits of trenchant
criticism, Edwin Markham, 75-year-old
California poet, read selections from
his own poems and commented on
poetry in general yesterday afternoon.
So large an audience had gathered to
hear hini that the Assembly Hall had
to be substituted for the Little Thea
tre, where he had been scheduled to
speak.
"Poetry springs out of man's think
ing heart," he said. "It does not exist
primarily for the thought—prose does
that. Thought is only the basis for
emotions in poetry.
"At the head of all the arts is reli
gion; when clearly understood, it is
the art of life. Ileally, though, there is
only one art and one attempt to ex
press its wonder: poetry, painting,
music, and sculpture are its languages.
Poetry goes to the center of man.
Science lays the groundwork for
poetry, but poetry begins where sci
ence ends."
