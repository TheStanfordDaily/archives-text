"Russia will accomplish one of her
objects in regard to China, but will
fail completely in the other," said Pro
fessor Henry Lanz of the Department
of Slavic Literature, recently. "I be
lieve that China, with the aid of Rus
sia, will drive out imperialistic inter
ference, but she will never take over
the Russian ideals of communism."
Dr. Lanz, who is well-acquainted
with the Asiatic fiasco, shows that
Russia has been preparing China for a
revolt for many years. The soviet gov
ernment has established a university
in Moscow which is entirely for Chi
nese students. These Orientals are
trained in the art of communistic
propaganda and are sent back to China
to spread the seeds of Russian bol
shevism.
"The break between the Chinese
forces is likely to be a serious handi
cap to the progress of the Russian
scheme," Dr. Lanz stated, "and will
probably force Russia to attack the
army of Chang-Tso-Lin. Report's that
Russian forces are gathering near the
Manchurian border might easily be
due to plans of Borodin to give mar
tial aid to the Chinese anti-imperial
ists."
