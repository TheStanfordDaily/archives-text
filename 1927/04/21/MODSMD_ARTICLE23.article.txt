# STANFORD LAW SCHOOL PLANS MANY CHANGES
## Adoption of Harvard Plan Of Study to Raise Law Graduate Standards FIVE COURSES CREATED Securities Classes Combined Into One Division; No Change in Staff 
### 
Putting the Stanford School of Law
on a par with a majority of the East
ern law colleges of high standing, Dean
Marion It. Kirkwood has announced
drastic changes in the curriculum of
the law department to become effec
tive next fall. The new arrangement
will initiate live new courses, combine
several existing subjects, and elimi
nate a number of the minor divisions
of the school.
The most radical change will be
made in the adoption of the Harvard
plan of study. Law students will now
be required to take final examinations
at the end of the school year on a ma
jority of the work studied during the
previous three quarters. This will
eliminate "cramming" before the final
examination, and the added severity
of the tests will tend to raise the
standards of graduation and give the
Stanford law graduate a much higher
rating than at present.
Courses Grouped
The most unique combination of
courses will be that of grouping all
elements of securities into one six-unit
subject. The existing course in Con
tracts will be lengthened from eleven
to thirteen units, eight of which are
to be taken in the first year of study
and the remaining five in the second
year. Constitutional Law will be en-!
larged to include Trade Regulations •
and several sections of Public Utili
ties.
The remaining courses in Public j
Utilities will be combined with Bail- j
ments and Carriers to form a new
division under the former name. The
four Property subjects now offered
will be combined into two longer and j
more intensive groups. 1
New courses will be offered in Prob
lems of Administration of Civil Jus- ■
j tice, Problems in Administration of
! Criminal Justice, Problems in Prac-1
tice, Problems in Administrative Law, j
| and Problems in Comparative Law.
I These subjects will furnish a back- :
I ground to actual law practice by plac- j
ing the student in real and theoretical
j situations.
I Following a unanimous vote by the
| law department in favor of the above- j
j stated and many other minor changes, ;
| great enthusiasm was expressed by
I department professors and the success |
! of the plan was predicted by Dean'
j Kirkwood. Despite the number and
J importance of the alterations, no
! change will be made in the staff.

eliminate "cramming" before the final
examination, and the added severity
of the tests will tend to raise the
standards of graduation and give the
Stanford law graduate a much higher
rating than at present.
Courses Grouped
The most unique combination of
courses will be that of grouping all
elements of securities into one six-unit
subject. The existing course in Con
tracts will be lengthened from eleven
to thirteen units, eight of which are
to be taken in the first year of study
and the remaining five in the second
year. Constitutional Law will be en-!
larged to include Trade Regulations •
and several sections of Public Utili
ties.
The remaining courses in Public j
Utilities will be combined with Bail- j
ments and Carriers to form a new
division under the former name. The
four Property subjects now offered
will be combined into two longer and j
more intensive groups. 1
New courses will be offered in Prob
lems of Administration of Civil Jus- ■
j tice, Problems in Administration of
! Criminal Justice, Problems in Prac-1
tice, Problems in Administrative Law, j
| and Problems in Comparative Law.
I These subjects will furnish a back- :
I ground to actual law practice by plac- j
ing the student in real and theoretical
j situations.
I Following a unanimous vote by the
| law department in favor of the above- j
j stated and many other minor changes, ;
| great enthusiasm was expressed by
I department professors and the success |
! of the plan was predicted by Dean'
j Kirkwood. Despite the number and
J importance of the alterations, no
! change will be made in the staff.
