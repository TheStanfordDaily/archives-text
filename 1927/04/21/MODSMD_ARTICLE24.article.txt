# CENSORSHIP OF NEWS DECRIED BY AUDIENCE IN EUPHRONIA DEBATE
## 
### 
That newspaper reports of criminal
trials should not be censored by the
State was the decision made by the
audience attending the debate on that
question held last night between Eu
plironia and members of the Crime
Debating squad.
Lewis Baer, Laurence Hedges, and
Leonard Kirkpatrick took the nega
tive of the question for Euphronia.
The affirmative team was comprised
of Fred Thon, Gordon Slialleuberger,
and Dan Smith.
Newspapers were accused of inciting
crime, blackening reputations, and
creating disregard for law, by the af
firmative. A counter thrust was landed
by the negative in stating that reports
of trials show up the rottenness of
the courts and in the end will bring
about reform as has been the case in
New York State.
Announcement was made at the
close of the debate by William H.
Levit. president of the society, that an
open forum meeting will be held next
Wednesday at which President Wil
bur will discuss the abolishment of
the lower division.
