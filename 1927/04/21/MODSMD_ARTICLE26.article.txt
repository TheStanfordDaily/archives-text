# An International Affair
## 
### 
Stanford will be the scene of an international athletic contest today,
when the Waseda University baseball team meets the Cardinals 011 the
varsity diamond. The Japanese nine is making a tour of the United
States, and Stanford will offer the first competition of the tour.
Judging from the headlines in the Daily and also in the San Fran
cisco papers, it might be supposed that the Waseda students had made
the ocean tour merely for a game of bridge or poker—"Waseda Nine
Will Play Cards Tomorrow"; "Japanese Nine to Play Cards in Two
Games"—but the game is baseball, and it is rumored that the Orientals
are stealing America's national game, and are actually playing it better
than we can ourselves. Whether this is true or not can be determined
today, and anyone interested in the test is welcome to witness the game
this afternoon.
