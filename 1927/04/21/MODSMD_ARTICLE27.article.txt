Stanford's All-University boxing tournament opens a week from
today and the entry list for the event closes Saturday night. Harry
Maloney, in charge of the event, reports that at present there are only
about half as many entries as are needed to make the tourney a success.
Maloney is trying to keep boxing 011 a high plane at Stanford and this
year's poor showing has disappointed him.
This annual athletic affair has one bit of sentiment attached to it—if
boxing tournaments may have sentiment in the generally accepted sense
of the word. Former University champions offer the medals which are
awarded to the winners of each of the seven weight divisions.
Maloney feels, and rightly so, that this tournament should have a
larger tournout than the sixteen who have thus far signed up for it. It
is his desire to have at least four entries in each of the seven weight
divisions. Men who have any talent and interest in the sport should
sign up if only for the competition and experience to be gained.
