"Dr. Thomas Reed Powell, of Harvard university, who spoke to the
students of the College of Law here recently, told a story which could
well be pondered by students everywhere.
"The speaker, in telling the story, was showing up the disadvantages
of a curriculum, a designated and distinct set of courses, in our educa
tional system.
"The illustration concerned a young fellow who had an impediment
in his speech. He decided to attend a school which purported to correct
stammering and stuttering. He went to such a school and exposed
himself to the required number of lessons.
"After a tin* the young fellow returned to his native haunts sup
posedly being in such a shape that his stuttering was gone. When he
arrived home he was greeted by his father, who asked:
" 'Well, son, do you think your study and training did you any good?'
" 'W-w-well,' lie answered, *1-1-1 h-a-ve learned to s-s-say: "Peter
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers," but tha-t's used s-s-o s-s-el-dom
in c-c-con-ver-sation.'
"The young fellow had learned to say the phrases taught him without
stuttering quite correctly but he had not learned to make practical use of
the teachings that had been imparted to him.
"How characteristic of so many students! They study one particular
course, they think they know the course. So many students fail to make
practical use of the value of that one course in relation to knowledge
from other courses."
