The national basketball rules committee recently enacted a new piece
of legislation that has brought unfavorable comments from all sides.
The rules committee in its last meeting abolished the dribble, and enacted
the "one bound" dribble provision. The new rule applies to all amateur
contests throughout the nation and will go into effect next season.
The provision was made to speed up the contest and to force teams
to play a passing game, but it appears that the opposite results will be
obtained. The spectacular dribbling game will be replaced by a play
that resembles "take away" more than it docs basketball.
But we can sympathize with the rules committee. They meet every
so often, and the public expects them to make some changes in the
rules. Otherwise what would be the purpose of meeting? So if there is
nothing wrong with the game, they merely change the first thing they lay
their hands on. What difference docs it make whether they ruin the
game by doing away with the most vital features of the match ?
