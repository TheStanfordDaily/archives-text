MORE RED TAPE
The department of physical training
yesterday published a newer and more
irritating set of rules than those for
merly governing its, classes and ap
pended to them an admonition that
they would be enforced to the point
where one cut would mean failure in
the quarter's work.
It is easy to understand why a pro
fessor in certain courses feels that it
is imperative for his students to be
present at each meeting of the class
lest they miss the continuity of the
course. But it is quite difficult to see
why it should be of major importance
if a man, say two or three tynes in a
quarter, simply does not feel in the
mood to exercise.
Furthermore, if he does cut a class
in physical training, it is hard to see
any justification for the complicated
formalities he must perform in order

I to be excused, provided he has a legiti
| mate reason for failing to attend.
From the outside it would seem that
1 a great deal of trouble both to the
| student and the instructor, would be
i obviated if a reasonable margin were
! allowed each quarter for failure to
attend physical training classes.

what he does with his time outside of
the two or three hours he spends lec
turing:
"It takes all day to prepare to talk
for two or three hours. And you never
an tell when your studies will be in
terrupted by some wise guy in the
class who has primed himself on some
point and has come in to get you!"
