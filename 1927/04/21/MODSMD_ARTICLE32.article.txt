The Editor, Sir: 4
Is it not possible for the University
administration to see that things are
done above-board without publishing
what should be a personal matter to
a morbidly curious student body? I
refer to the conspicuous publicity
given to scholarship awards.
As everyone knows, the scholarship
committee awards numerous scholar
ships each quarter as a financial aid
to students who could not otherwise
afford to come to college. Although
scholarships are in a way conceded to
be an honor, as high marks are neces
sary to obtain them, the financial as
pect is equally as important.
The award of a few hundred dollars
may be a great blessing to certain in
dividuals, but it is not so great a boon
to have this blessing advertised in
the campus paper and in the "bawl
out."

"Bull Sessions" are perhaps the
most popular institutions on the cam
pus, and the "bawl-out" is almost al
ways present <it these meetings. Is it
always with the kindliest intentions
that the pages devoted to "scholars"
are turned to?
The ulterior motive behind this pub
licity is that it is undesirable to have
athletes given secret financial backing,
yet it is conceivable that all money
can come through the committee with
out so much publicity. —B.C.

"Union" may be interested to know
that the telephone company did not
make delivery of the telephone direc
tories for the dormitories until April
19th, although official inquiry was
made as to the reason for. their non
delivery on April 15th. —E. H. Ayres.
