I'LL HAVE A FINE FUNERAL. By
Pierre La Maziere. Brentano's.
TWILIGHT. By Count Edouard Von
Keyserling. Macaulay.
In a spring season not so far not
able for its novels these two deserve j
the attention of the discriminating.
reader for at least one reason —they
are written by men who know how. |
It will take a discerning critic to dei
tect in them that mark of the ama-!
teur which is so plain in the great run j
of fiction these days.
A glance at the authors will reveal j
the fact that one is an unknown j
Frenchman; the second a relatively!
unknown German. Nevertheless, as far
as most readers are concerned, the
unknown Frenchman will probably
carry'off the palm; for, although this
book may lack the sustained artistry
and atmosphere to be found in Count
Keyserling's novel —he strikes a more
living and universal notp, and it rings
deep in the heart of today.
M. La Maziere, in effect, asks in his
novel whether, in the present state of
society, it pays to be honest; and if
you take the career of the hero for the
answer, replies that it is not. His hero
succeeded only when he put morality
in his pocket and took the current
when it served. He ended a rich man
and a senator in France. The book is
a fierce indictment of modern business

ethics; and as a satire it is a notable
performance. It undoubtedly deserved
the encomiums with which noted
French critics and literary men greet
ed it. It is a novel that provokes
thought because it uncovers the
springs of human conduct. But it is
none the less dangerous doctrine.
Count Edouard von Keyserling's
"Twilight" records the decay of a
proud social class —the old North Ger
man barons. In its simple, but beauti
ful prose it recalls the German "novel
len" so familiar to the studies of our
youth. There is the same romantic
characterization—romantic, but never
theless convincingly human. The at
mosphere of the story is perfect. The
author's art leaves little to be desired
—tragedy is inevitable and is accepted
by the reader as such. Few novels re
cently published can be so unreserved
ly recommended to those who like real
literature. His personal acquaintance
with his subject matter and his mature
outlook doubtless account for this fine
novel. —E.L.S.
