# STUDENT VIEWS OF FOREIGN SITUATIONS SOUGHT BY WILBUR
## Results to Be Compiled for Second Conference of Pacific Relations 
### 
Questionnaires to obtain the opin
ions or a representative group of stu
dents at Stanford on the situation in
the Orient and the Occident have been
given to 100 freshmen and 100 seniors
through President Wilbur. The results
will be used at the Second Conference
of the Institute of Pacific Relations,
which will assemble in Honolulu in
July, by the Americans on the com
mittee, who wish to understand the
opinion of representative citizens. The
committee will be composed of about
120 men and women from Japan,
China, United States, Canada, the
Philippines, Korea, Australia, New
Zealand, and Great Britain.
The circular requires the person to
put down his feelings on different
points of the eastern question by
marking one of six possible impres
sions. It also asks the person's feel
ings toward the different races. There
is a time limit on this as the person's
immediate reaction is required.
Another part of the circular marks
certain statements about oriental
problems and requires (he person to
give his opinion as to their truthful
ness. Those answering the question
naires are asked to fill in certain in
formation about themselves â€” their
age, residence, nationality, the race
they know the most about, and the
books and magazines that they have
read.
All that have been given these cir
culars are asked to fill them in care
fully and quickly. The seniors are re
quested to bring theirs to the class
meeting at 12:45 o'clock today.
