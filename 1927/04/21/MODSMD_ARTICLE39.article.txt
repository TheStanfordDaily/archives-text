# FORBES' PAINTINGS ON EXHIBITION THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Helen Forbes, whose paintings of
Mexican scenes are being shown at the
Stanford Art Gallery until April 30, has
had wide technical training and is a
painter with a distinctly modern view
point. Most of her work was done in
Guanajuato, an abandoned mining
town north of Mexico City.
Included in the exhibit are colorful
scenes of the old cities of Mexico, the
cactus hillsides, and village natives,
all painted in bold, vigorous technique.
There are also a few flower studies,
landscapes, portraits, and out-of-door
subjects.
