# FOUR TEAMS QUALIFY IN MURAL GOLF PLAY
## 
### 
Three hotly contested matches fea
tured the play in the first elimination
round of intramural golf yesterday at
the Emerald Lake links. Alpha Tau
Omega defeated the Kappa Sigma
team 2 up; Encina Basement took its
match from Encina IV, 5-4; Alpha
Delta Phi beat Alpha Sigma Phi 4-2;
and the Independents defaulted their
match to Beta Theta Pi.
The A.T.O.'s played a good game
of golf but had difficulty in taking
their match from the Kappa Sigma
teams, which turned in a 170 score.
