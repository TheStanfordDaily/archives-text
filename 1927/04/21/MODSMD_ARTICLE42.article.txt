# UNIVERSITY FUND IS BIG ACHIEVEMENT OF ALUMNIâ€”M'DOWELL
## Plan Offers First Chance for Graduate Body to Aid Stanford

"It's the biggest thing the Alumni As
sociation has ever done," said John E.
McDowell, Alumni Secretary, as he ex
pressed his opinion of the University
Fund recently created by Stanford gradu
ates.
At a meeting held March 3, 1927, the
Executive Committee of the Alumni As
sociation voted to establish an organiza
tion for the purpose of encouraging gifts
and contributions to an alumni fund, the
money accumulated to be transferred an
nually to the Board of Trustees of the
University.
Campaign New
This is the first time that the alumni,
through their own association, have had
an opportunity to contribute voluntarily
to the support of the University. In 1920
the University made an appeal for con
tributions to the First Million, and later
the Board of Athletic Control asked for
contributions to the stadium; but at no
time has the Alumni Association made a
campaign for funds.
According to the committee's statement
the important features of the plan are
that each graduate and former student
will have an opportunity to contribute to
the University according to his means;
contributions may be made for any period,
in any amount, and for any specified pur
pose; the entire fund is to be devoted to
University purposes as an emergency
fund, in a general way; and no intensive
campaign or drive is to be made.
Alumni Head Approves
Paul M. Downing, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, in an edi
torial in this month's Illustrated Review
said:
"What the Association has done is (a)
set up the machinery for handling in
the simplest possible way contributions,
bequests, etc., that alumni, former stu
dents, and friends of the University will
want to make; (b) to give wide publicity
among prospective donors and others that
such machinery has been provided; and
(c) to impress upon all a realization of
the fact that the work being done at the
University is such as to warrant not only
their moral but also their financial sup
port."
Similar Plans in Use
The newly adopted plan is similar to
that now in use at Yale, Harvard, Co
lumbia, Michigan, Northwestern, Cor
nell, and several other universities. Fig
ures from their alumni associations are
significant in that they indicate the rapid
growth of the various alumni funds and
emphasize the large amount of extra re
sources made available to the university
for unexpected needs.
Already one alumnus, Dr. G. Alfred
Lawrence, '92, hearing of the new plan,
has remitted a check for $100 as a con
tribution to the fund; another, Charles
M. Cram, '96, has pledged $250 annually
for life, his contribution to be devoted
to the current funds of the Law School.
All contributions or pledges to the
Stanford Alumni Fund should be sent to
the Stanford Alumni Association, Stan
ford University.
