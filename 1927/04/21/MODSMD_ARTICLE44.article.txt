# BRANDSTEN'S MERMEN HAVE FLASHY SEASON OF RECORD-SMASHING
## Long End of 37-22 Score Is Nearest Cards Come To Defeat 
### 
Eight Stanford-California records
and three Pacific Coast intercollegiate
records have gone by the boards in
the four meets that Coach Ernie
Brandsten's Cardinal mermen have
entered this season.
The first meet was against the Uni
versity of Oregon, champions of the
Northwest. Stanford triumphed over
the Webfooters 53 to 6, allowing them
only six third places. Captain Carl
Stevenson smashed the Pacific Coast
record for the 150-yard backstroke
when he made the time of 1:55 3-5.
Wally O'Connor took eight seconds off
the existing time ol' 2:35 2-5 for the
220. The four-man relay team, com
posed of Christensen, Doerr, O'Connor,
and Williams, took a second off the
relay time.
Defeat Hollywood
The Hollywood Athletic Club, re
puted to be one of the best of the
South, came to Palo Alto only to be
defeated by a score of 37 to 22. The
outstanding feature of this meet was
the four-man 400-yard relay, which
Stanford won with a time of 3:56.
Fletcher of Hollywood won the breast
stroke, Harris and Jarvis took the 50-
yard free style, and Ploessel captured
the back. Stanford came closer to a
defeat in this contest than in any
other this year.
Stanford swamped her old rival,
California, under a score of 58 to 11.
It was in this meet that the Cardinals
broke most of the Stanford-California
records. The Cardinal freshmen
showed up especially well in their
meet, breaking more records than did
the varsity, and bettering some of the
varsity times.
Captain Stevenson smashed the 100-
yard backstroke record by swimming
the distance in 1:12 1-10. Hobdy, of
the freshmen, swam the distance in
1:07 5-10. O'Connor made a new mark
in the 100-yard free style with a time
of 0:56. A team composed of Steven
son, West, and O'Connor set a time
of 3:32 4-5 for the 300-yard medley.
The freshman trio, Hobdy, Doerr, and
Driggs, made 3:45 3-5. For the remain
der of the freshman records, Conradi
broke the breaststroke time, and Har
rison that of the 50-vard free style,
and of the 100-yard free style.
The most unsatisfactory meet, espe
cially in regard to the times made,
was the U.S.C. contest, which Stanford
won 51 to 8. However, the Cardinals
took all first places and all seconds
but one.
