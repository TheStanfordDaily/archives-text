# MEN'S COUNCIL HEARS COMMUTATION APPEAL
## 
### 
An appeal for commutation of sen
tence was the only case heard before
the Men's Council at its meeting yes
terday afternoon. A certain student,
who had appeared before the council
a year ago last fall on the charge of
passing nearly a dozen worthless
checks, was given the penalty of fif
teen additional hours on his gradua
tion requirements.
Since President Wilbur had at that
time recommended the punishment,
the council has asked the President
to take charge of the case.
