### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Helen Jacobs must have received I
quite a thrill the other day when she
learned that she had been named as a <
candidate for the United States Wight-1
man Cup team that meets the British i
I
women challengers at Forest Hills, i
Long Island, next August. Miss Jacobs |
will try out for a place with such fa- j
maus stars as Helen Wills, Molla Mai-1
lory, Elizabeth Ryan, and Eleanor j
Goss, and as two of this quartet are j
nearly twice as old as Helen is, and j
as they have undoubtedly seen their j
best days as racket-wielders, the i
chances of the young Berkeley girl '
making the team are not so hopeless j
at that.
Helen Jacobs was born on August 6,
1905, which means that she missed the 1
big party her home district staged
twenty-one years ago last Monday. San
Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley were
pretty much laid waste on April 19th,
1906, with the earthquake of the morn
ing before, and the numerous fires wip
ing out block after block soon after
wards, so it was just as lucky that she
wasn't around. Helen Wills was there
though. She was six months old at the
time.
Queer how parallel are the careers
of these two Helens of Berkeley. Both
started their tennis at about the same
age, both came East at the ago of
fifteen to win the junior champion
ships, and both successfully defended

I their titles in the year following their
J first victories. Both wear the now
\ famous eye-shade, and both were tu
| tored on the coast by W. C. "Pop" '
i Fuller. Will the younger Helen go on I
j to gain national championship honors j
las the older Helen did?
Many tennis experts have said that'
| Helen Jacobs' play is superior to that
j of Helen Wills in several departments.
! Her footwork, they point out, is better
1 because she is on her toes more, is
I lighter on her feet, faster in getting
I about, and hence covers more court.
| Miss Jacobs' service, it is claimed, is
better than Miss Wills,' and so is the
overhead play of the younger girl.
Perhaps the Lady-in-waiting will de
throne the Queen in the not-far-distant
future!
