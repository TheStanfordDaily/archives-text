# BOXING TOURNAMENT MAY BE CANCELLED DECLARES MALONEY
## Nine Entries Must Be Made Before Deadline Date To Insure Bouts 
### 
Possibilities of cancellation of the
annual University boxing tournament,
unless there is an increase in the entry
list before the deadline, Saturday,
April 23, were expressed last night by
Coach Harry W. Maloney, who is
handling the arrangements.
With only sixteen men signed up in
the seven weight divisions, Coach Ma
loney was fearful that the event would
have to be disregarded this season on
account of lack of entries.
The tournament is scheduled for
Thursday, April 28, and is open to all
students registered in the University
except those who have previously won
such a title, which makes ineligible in
the competition six of the men who
performed on this year's varsity box
ing squad.
The weight divisions range from
bantam to unlimited as follows: ban
tam, 119 pounds; feather, 129 pounds;
light, 139 pounds; welter, 149 pounds;
middle, 163; light-heavy, 175; and
heavy, 175 pounds.
Pairings will be made for prelimin
ary bouts to be fought before the tour
nament, to decide bi'ackets for the
semi-finals and finals. The winners
will be given medals, presents of for
mer students who were Stanford cham
pions while here.
