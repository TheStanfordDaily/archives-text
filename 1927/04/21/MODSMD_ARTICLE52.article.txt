# "B" Students Better Prepared, for Business Thinks Oklahoma Dean
## 
### 
Students who make a "B" average
in college have a better opportunity
to succeed in the business world than
"A" average men, in the opinion of
George Wadsack, University of Okla
homa registrar. He claims that "B"
average men participate in more out
side activities which tend to prepare
them more efficiently for their future
careers.
Coming to the rescue of the "A"
students, Dr. J. S. Buchanan, vice
president ol the same university, says;
An 'A is an 'A', and it is gained
only by the cream, the intelligentsia,
the cognoscenti, the illuminati, the
best, the finest, the fittest, the superla
tive, the red-blooded bouiul-to-succeed
at-any-cost students. We faculty see
to that If George Washington
had gone to the University of Okla
homa he would have been an 'A' stu
dent. So would Abraham Lincoln,
Napoleon, or Catherine the Great. But
Judas Iscariot, tliohgh he might have
made *B's\ would never have been an
'A' man."
