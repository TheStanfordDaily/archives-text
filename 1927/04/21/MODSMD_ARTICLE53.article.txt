# OHIO GLEE CLUB TOO WEIGHTY FOR ROADS
## 
### 
ELYRIA, Ohio, April 20.— (1.P.) —
When a bus carrying twenty-nine mem-
I hers of the Men's Clee Club of Ohio
Northern University entered this city,
: traffic officers suspected it of being
j over-weight.
Escorting it to a coal scale, it was
found to be too long for weighing all
j at once, and so it was weighed in sec
i tions, the front wheels and then the
back. By this method it was found
j to exceed the lawful weight, but some
i engineering students on the bus ob
; jected on the grounds that the correct
! weight of the bus could not be de
: termined in this manner, or they didn't
1 know their physics.
It was a Northern alumnus, a prac
| ticing attorney in Elyria, who finally
' secured the release of the driver and
| his load of songsters.
