Pitching shut-out ball and allowing
â– only five scattered hits, Captain Steve
Collins led the Stanford varsity base
ball nine to a 7 to 0 victory over the
"University of Waseda on the Stanford
diamond yesterday afternoon. The
game was cinched in the first inning
when four singles, an error, and a
stolen base netted the Cardinals four
runs.
Wilton started the opening inning
with a single, and Stewart was safe a
moment later, Mizukami, Waseda
pitcher, fumbling his sacrifice bunt in
front of the plate. Maguire singled,
scoring Wilton, and when Busch drove
a fast grounder between shortstop and
third base, Stewart crossed the platter.
Garibaldi and Sypher flied out, but
Nissen delivered with another single,
scoring Maguire. With Busch on third,
Nissen allowed himself to be caught
off first, and Busch tallied on the
play.
Maguire Scores
Maguire, first up in the third, drove
a triple to center, and scored on Gari
baldi's sacrifice fly. In the fifth, Wil
ton reached first on I. Nishimura's
error. In attempting to force Wilton
at second on Stewart's infield hit,
Nishimura again fumbled and both
runners were safe. Maguire sacrificed,
and Wilton scored on Busch's single to
left. Garibaldi lofted a sacrifice fly,
and Stewart tallied after the catch
with Stanford's final score.
The Cardinals did not threaten again j
until the ninth when Sypher doubled
and Wilton and Collins walked. With
two out. Wilton hit to Mizukama, who
tagged Sypher for the third out. The
invaders from Tokyo failed to perforin i
as expected, making four errors and 1
failing to hit Collins effectively. Each
of the Waseda club's five singles were |
made in separate innings and Collins
was in danger but once during the |
contest.
The Nipponese filled the bags in |
the sixth, but Collins pulled himself j
out of a bad position by fanning Itami :
to end the inning. Two Waseda men !
reached first in the second and ninth,
but no damage was done.
Collins Stars
Collins' pitching was easily the fea
ture of the contest, the Cardinal
moundsman serving for the last time
in a Stanford uniform. Errors by his
teammates caused him considerable j
worry, but his ability to tighten up in
the pinches credited him with a well-1
earned victory. Sypher continued his
consecutive hitting record by connect-;
ing for a two-base hit in his last trip j
to the plate, while Busch led the day j
with two timely hits.
