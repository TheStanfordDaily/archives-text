the race from the English corner to
the Postoffice, comparatively dry land
since the Volstead Act.
The speedy shells were two cast-off
i rowboats of ancient and disreputable
! appearance. A1 Cass acted as cox
! swain for one scow and John Truman
i
I for the other. Both shouted a heady

[ came when Cass' crew forged into the
lead as a result of Truman's scow los
ing a wheel. Thus the race ended in a
blaze of glory as everyone rushed to
