night in the Lagunita bandstand, held
to arouse enthusiasm for the meet to

would have the climatic advantage of
having the meet on the campus, and
also that the moral support of the
large rooting section was a factor in
her favor.
Templeton also expressed confidence
in his team winning a victory as did
Captain Larry Babcock.
About four hundred students were
present at the rally and created as
much enthusiasm and noise as there
has been at any such gathering this
year. Entertainment was furnished by
the Brooks-Worthington orchestra,
which played between yells and
speeches. The track team appeared on
the bandstand, wtyh colored lights
playing on them, as did the baseball
team of the University of Waseda,
Japan, which is playing a series with
the Stanford team. The Orientals sang
their university hymn and gave one
of their university yells.
The six remaining tryoutees for yell
leader led a few yells. They will ap
pear at the U.S.C. meet tomorrow for
the last time before being voted on.
The rally was closed by singing Stan
ford songs and the hymn.
