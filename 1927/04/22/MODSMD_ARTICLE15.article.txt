# STANFORD PROFESSOR DEFENDS U.S. POLICY IN CHINESE TROUBLE
## 
### 
"China is facing great problems of
internal reorganization and readjust
ment of her foreign relations." This
was the central idea expressed by
Professor Payson J. Treat of the His
tory department in an address given
yesterday at the Conference on China
now being hel dat the St. Frances
Hotel, Sau Francisco. The subject of
his speech was: "The Historical Ap
proach to the Present Problem."
He described the origin of the "un
equal treaties" which form the major
complaint of the Chinese Nationalists.
Under existing conditions Professor
Treat believes in the policy of the
United States in protecting the lives
and property of American citizens in
China, while refraining from any in
terference in internal difficulties. "The
recent dissensions in the Nationalist
party were not unexpected, but their
effects cannot be clearly foreseen,"
was Professor Treat's concluding
statement.
