# EDUCATION ONLY CURE FOR WESTERN INERTIA DECLARES DR. WILBUR
## University Head Addresses China Conference in San Francisco 
### 
"All that is stirring in the Pacific
is education, and the cure will have
to be more education," said President
Wilbur yesterday afternoon in an ad
dress given before the Conference on
China convening at the St. Francis
Hotel, San Francisco. Extensive study
and research in resources, population,
standards of living, and culture con
stitute the most imminent needs of
the Orient, he believes.
"China is now the center of world
irritation," he continued, "and there
are many nations, many races looking
on; they know that one nation is
going through a period of civil war."
Deplores Trade Idea
During his discussion of influences
operating to discount the favorable
effects of education, he mentioned
"trade which leads to dollar-thinking"
as one of the most pernicious. On this
subject, he declared. "We can't build
bur knowledge of China on emotions
and prejudices and lack of knowledge.
"Only the slow process of research,
contact, understanding," Wilbur con
cluded, "will enable us to look at the
great problems about the Pacific in an
intelligent way. Only education, un
prejudiced and broad, can point the
way."
