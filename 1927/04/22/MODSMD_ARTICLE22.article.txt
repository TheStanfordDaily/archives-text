# GREATEST INTERCOLLEGIATE TRACK MEET SCHEDULED AS CARDINALS. TROJANS CLASH
## Records Expected to Fall in Quarter, Hurdles, Relay, And Century BABCOCK MAY RUN 100 Winning Team Is Favored To Take IC-4A Contest At Philadelphia 
### Joe Carroll 
In the greatest intercollegiate dual
meet of the season, the Stanford Uni
versity track team meets the Univer
sity of Southern California athletes in
track and field competition tomorrow
afternoon in the stadium. The first
track event starts at 2:15 o'clock,
while the javelin throw commences at
2 o'clock sharp.
The greatest intercollegiate dual
meet:
First, because of the battle of supre
macy between the two teams.
Second, because of the galaxy of in
dividual stars, each supreme in his
own event.
Third, because each team is pointed
for the national championship.
Results Pertinent
The team that wins tomorrow will
be rated as having the best chance
of any college in the United States to
capture the IC-4A championship and
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title.
Records are expected to fall in the
quarter mile, the low and high hur
dles, and the hundred-yard dash, if
the weather that has been prevailing
keeps up. Spencer has been 011 the
verge of breaking the 440 record all
season. In the hurdles, either West or
Nichols have a good chance of exceed
ing their former times, aH they will be
pressed by Kaer and Reynolds, who
are fast competition. Charlie Borah is
doped to either tie or break the exist
ing record in the century.
McKinnon Favored
Beginning with the mile, which Alex
McKinnon, on the .basis of his show
ing against California, should win over
Unruh, many stars will be seen in
action.
Charlie Borah, Captain Ed House,
Weldon Draper, Herschel Smith,
Johnny Parsons, of IT.S.C., face Fred
Richman and John Lauritzen in the
100' and 220. Babcook also may run the
100, and Spencer the 220.
Then Bud Spencer and Captain Bab
cock are figured to finish first and
second in the 440, with Syer and Wil
son fighting for third place.
880-Men Equal
The 880 brings together six men of
about equal ability. Lovejoy, Gloege,
and Adams of U.S.C. run against Mc-
Kinnon, Moss, and Clum of Stanford.
Any one of these six may win.
Rufus Ranney, Bob Swain, and Les
Heilman should furnish an interesting
two-mile race.
Stanford will doubtless sweep the
shot sput, and perhaps the javelin
throw. Hoffman, Forster, and Fleish
hacker are expected to win the shot.
Hoffman and Evans, and perhaps Way,
will undoubtedly beat out Aleski, Tro
jan strong man, in the discus.
Strong in Javelin
The triumvirate, Joaquin, Shipkey,
and Sparling—nine points in the jave
lin.
King, first, Coggeshall, second, and
Work, third, will provide thrills in
the high jump. Coggeshall may sur
prise in this event.
The broad jump will offer a merry
battle. Six men, three from each squad,
have cleared twenty-three feet. The
Stanford jumpers are more consistent.
Zombro's twenty-four-foot leap last
week gives him first call.
Pole Vault Spectacular
With Lee Barnes, Olympic champion,
back in form, a thirteen-foot six-inch
height seems imminent. Edmonds may
beat Jack Williams for second place.
Hulsman may also be heard from.
The relay will prove close, and very
interesting, for the Trojan team has
done with in 2-5 of a second of the
Cardinal four's best mark.
Stanford will win the meet —if neces
sary, by one point. Probably the mar
gin of victory will be more conclusive
than one point, however. This is our
story, and we'll stick to it.

Weldon Draper, Herschel Smith,
Johnny Parsons, of IT.S.C., face Fred
Richman and John Lauritzen in the
100' and 220. Babcook also may run the
100, and Spencer the 220.
Then Bud Spencer and Captain Bab
cock are figured to finish first and
second in the 440, with Syer and Wil
son fighting for third place.
880-Men Equal
The 880 brings together six men of
about equal ability. Lovejoy, Gloege,
and Adams of U.S.C. run against Mc-
Kinnon, Moss, and Clum of Stanford.
Any one of these six may win.
Rufus Ranney, Bob Swain, and Les
Heilman should furnish an interesting
two-mile race.
Stanford will doubtless sweep the
shot sput, and perhaps the javelin
throw. Hoffman, Forster, and Fleish
hacker are expected to win the shot.
Hoffman and Evans, and perhaps Way,
will undoubtedly beat out Aleski, Tro
jan strong man, in the discus.
Strong in Javelin
The triumvirate, Joaquin, Shipkey,
and Sparling—nine points in the jave
lin.
King, first, Coggeshall, second, and
Work, third, will provide thrills in
the high jump. Coggeshall may sur
prise in this event.
The broad jump will offer a merry
battle. Six men, three from each squad,
have cleared twenty-three feet. The
Stanford jumpers are more consistent.
Zombro's twenty-four-foot leap last
week gives him first call.
Pole Vault Spectacular
With Lee Barnes, Olympic champion,
back in form, a thirteen-foot six-inch
height seems imminent. Edmonds may
beat Jack Williams for second place.
Hulsman may also be heard from.
The relay will prove close, and very
interesting, for the Trojan team has
done with in 2-5 of a second of the
Cardinal four's best mark.
Stanford will win the meet —if neces
sary, by one point. Probably the mar
gin of victory will be more conclusive
than one point, however. This is our
story, and we'll stick to it.
In the greatest intercollegiate dual
meet of the season, the Stanford Uni
versity track team meets the Univer
sity of Southern California athletes in
track and field competition tomorrow
afternoon in the stadium. The first
track event starts at 2:15 o'clock,
while the javelin throw commences at
2 o'clock sharp.
The greatest intercollegiate dual
meet:
First, because of the battle of supre
macy between the two teams.
Second, because of the galaxy of in
dividual stars, each supreme in his
own event.
Third, because each team is pointed
for the national championship.
Results Pertinent
The team that wins tomorrow will
be rated as having the best chance
of any college in the United States to
capture the IC-4A championship and
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title.
Records are expected to fall in the
quarter mile, the low and high hur
dles, and the hundred-yard dash, if
the weather that has been prevailing
keeps up. Spencer has been 011 the
verge of breaking the 440 record all
season. In the hurdles, either West or
Nichols have a good chance of exceed
ing their former times, aH they will be
pressed by Kaer and Reynolds, who
are fast competition. Charlie Borah is
doped to either tie or break the exist
ing record in the century.
McKinnon Favored
Beginning with the mile, which Alex
McKinnon, on the .basis of his show
ing against California, should win over
Unruh, many stars will be seen in
action.
Charlie Borah, Captain Ed House,
Weldon Draper, Herschel Smith,
Johnny Parsons, of IT.S.C., face Fred
Richman and John Lauritzen in the
100' and 220. Babcook also may run the
