In the greatest intercollegiate dual
meet of the season, the Stanford Uni
versity track team meets the Univer
sity of Southern California athletes in
track and field competition tomorrow
afternoon in the stadium. The first
track event starts at 2:15 o'clock,
while the javelin throw commences at
2 o'clock sharp.
The greatest intercollegiate dual
meet:
First, because of the battle of supre
macy between the two teams.
Second, because of the galaxy of in
dividual stars, each supreme in his
own event.
Third, because each team is pointed
for the national championship.
Results Pertinent
The team that wins tomorrow will
be rated as having the best chance
of any college in the United States to
capture the IC-4A championship and
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title.
Records are expected to fall in the
quarter mile, the low and high hur
dles, and the hundred-yard dash, if
the weather that has been prevailing
keeps up. Spencer has been 011 the
verge of breaking the 440 record all
season. In the hurdles, either West or
Nichols have a good chance of exceed
ing their former times, aH they will be
pressed by Kaer and Reynolds, who
are fast competition. Charlie Borah is
doped to either tie or break the exist
ing record in the century.
McKinnon Favored
Beginning with the mile, which Alex
McKinnon, on the .basis of his show
ing against California, should win over
Unruh, many stars will be seen in
action.
