# Itâ€™s Just Too Bad

In one respect Stanford is unfortunate in having a world's champion
ship track team. That is because none of the teams that have met the
Cardinals this season have been able to offer the Stanford runners and
field event men any competition, and consequently the crowds that have
witnessed the meets have sat in the stadium the whole afternoon without
enjoying a thrill except when the Redshirts have neared world's records.
The Board of Athletic Control, realizing the scarcity of superior com
petition, scouted around the country for a team that is on Stanford's level.
They located the last year's winners of the I.C.A.A.A.A. and immediately
signed up the University of Southern California varsity for a meet in the
stadium bowl tomorrow afternoon.
The Trojans will offer Dink Templeton's men all the competition that
any coach could ask for. U.S.C. comes with athletes that are capable of
forcing Stanford to the limit of its ability. It is fairly safe to predict that,
with such competition in every event, records of all kinds and varieties
will be broken tomorrow. There is little doubt that Stanford-U.S.C.
records will be made; it is very probable that Pacific Coast times and
distances will be bettered; and it is quite possible that national and
world's records will be established in the stadium this week-end at
Stanford.
Serving the University of Southern California to the Stanford fans
as the last dual meet of the year is similar to serving dessert at the end
of dinner. The best should always be kept until the end, and this year,
with the aid of Mr. Jupiter Pluvius, the dessert will be served as the
book of etiquette prescribes.
