A baseball game without a single argument with the umpire was the
exceptional feature of yesterday's contest between Stanford and Waseda
Universities. Not once during the afternoon did the players of either
team question the decision of the official. Stanford won by seven runs,
and so did not need to argue, but the Japanese nine, who were the under
dogs from the first irming, did not once blame their losing onto the ump.
It is a custom in Japan to accept the referee's word as law, and
without grumbling. The Americans go to games expecting to see bottles
thrown at the umpire, and they are seldom disappointed. The batter who
is called out, believes it is his duty to look "dirty" at the ump and mumble
something concerning blind people. Spectators have learned to like this
disagreement, but is actually a non-essential part of baseball.
The Japanese have borrowed our national game, and have learned to
play it in a cleaner way than the Americans themselves. Cheering is
allowed but never booing. The game runs along more smoothly, and
everyone leaves the contest satisfied. If the team loses it is the players'
fault, not the umpire's.
In college football, booing is not allowed. In basketball the spectators
are not supposed to ridicule the players or the referee. In track the
rooters cheer every man, even the last place runner who stubbornly fights
his way to the tape. But college baseball is different. The students have
taken up a professional sport, and have not discarded the bad points of
the game.
America should copy Japan in its attitude toward the arbitrators at
baseball games. Even the best umpire makes his mistakes, but yelling
and booing do not correct these errors.
