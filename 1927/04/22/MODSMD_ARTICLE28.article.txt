# A 						Fling for Free Speech
## 
### 
Gerald Fling, of Kansas City, whoever he may be, has the right idea
011 free speech, and the freedom of the press, and especially the college
press. He said in an address before the Midwest Student Conference
last week that a student who is dismissed from college for offering criti
cism of the authorities is better off than the one who is willing to accept
the dictates of the authorities.
Fling declares that the college newspaper is the salvation of the col
lege. That may be true, and then again it may be an exaggeration, but it
is the duty of a college paper to criticize the things about the university
that the students feel arc wrong. If it were not for the paper, the
students would have no medium by which to express their disapproval of
the actions of the faculty, of the student government, or possibly of the
athletic board. And, of course, it is not criticism if the paper's editorial
policy has to be okehed by some sort of a censorship board before it can
be published.
The student council at the University of Oregon is requesting a vote
by the student body to place the editor of the student publication, The
Emerald, under its control in the future. As reason for this move the
members cite the past year's evidence of disagreements of the editor with
school policies as outlined by them. The editor of The Emerald has done
his duty in criticizing the council. If the criticism is unjust, it will be
disregarded. The Council at Oregon evidently realize that the criticism
is true, but because it is against their policy it should be suppressed. If
the Council is right they have nothing to fear from the newspaper.
The editor should keep right on printing his criticism, and if the
administration finally dismisses him, it is because they are afraid of him,
and he has won a victory. He may be out of a job, but he still has his
own mind, and he still can use it.
