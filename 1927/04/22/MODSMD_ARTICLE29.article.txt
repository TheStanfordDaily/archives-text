TWO EXTREMES
In a single issue of the Daily it is
announced that the already difficult
law course will be made even more
difficult and it is predicted that Stan
ford will take the national champion
ship in track.
This will serve as an example of the
tendency of individual coaches and
faculty members to become so inter
ested in their own work that they fail
to offer the student an opportunity to
properly co-ordinate several different
types of endeavor. The result is that
one rarely hears any more of a "well
rounded man."
It is obviously almost a superhuman
task for a man going through the law
school under the new regulations to
compete for a national championship
on the track or field. One may ask
whether or not it is of any importance
that he does compete for a national
championship. The answer is prob
ably in the negative. But it is of im
mense importance that the interest
that students as a whole have devel
oped in athletics be maintained. And

jit is obvious that this interest will not
be maintained if scholastic require
ments force them to degenerate into
a series of courses in sitting up exer
i cises.
For the benefit of saying, "I fold
you so," twenty years from now, your
columnist is going to venture a predic
tion on his own account. Mark it well.
If Stanford is going to save her dig
nity and self-respect, coincident with
the abolition of the lower division, it
behooves it to abolish athletic rela
tions with universities that do not
maintain a scholastic standing equiva
lent to its own. Otherwise Stanford
will be placed in the embarrassing
position recently occupied by Harvard,
which had its athletic relations with
Princeton severed by the latter institu
tion only after Princeton had dealt
Harvard a series of stinging defeats.
At the same time Stanford should en
courage her students to participate in
athletics, intramural and intercollegi
ate. only in so far as the type of coin
petition already mentioned is avail
-1 able. —Stephen O'Donnell.
