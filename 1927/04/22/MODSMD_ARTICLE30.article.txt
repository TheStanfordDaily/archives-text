While the public snaps up War
wick Deeping's new novel, "Dooms
day," at the rate of hundreds—or it
may be thousands —a week, the critics
wax dyspeptic over it, and are never
tired of picking flaws, real or other
wise. Clearly it is a case of "you can't
keep a good man down," and the public
knows it and is to be congratulated on
having more discernment in this case
than the critics. When one critic says
that the machinery of the novel is
well-oiled and another that "the joints
creak," what good are reviews, any
way?

The House of Mcßride announces as
the great event of 1927 the publica
tion of the Storisende Edition of the
works of James Branch Cabell. The
first three volumes will appear in the
autumn. This edition will bring out
the novels in chronological order, not
in the order of publication as hereto
fore.

We might at this time mention
"Rhapsody," by Arthur Schnitzler.
There is something to muse over, this

, notion, at the heart of Schnitzler's
; latest novel, that "no dream is entirely
a dream," and that reality, as we inter
pret our waking hours, is never the
whole truth. "Rhapsody"—its German
title is "Traumnovelle" —is indeed a
dream novel, and absorbed in its
pages one has the impression of being
: slipped into a dream. This noted Aus
| trian, as we all know, writes with
great art and a delicate bit of psy
chology, and this book is no exception.
