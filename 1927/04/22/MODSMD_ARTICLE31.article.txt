CLASSICAL LIT
Theseus was a husky guy—
Lycurgus got "in clutch,"
Resulting in an absent eye
(Which really isn't much).
Romulus hit Remus
A left jab to the head.
Remus couldn't take a punch
And tumbled over dead.
Solon was a Phi Bete,
The wisest of the Greks.
He'd tell the boys some subtle jokes
To puzzle out for weeks.
The Prof? He makes a castle
Of an ancient Grecian hovel.
You've heard about "The Man With a
Hoe"?
—Well, this prof likes a shovel.

LYRICAL MODERN DRAMA
Entitled:
"Who's Coat Is That?"
She wasn't rushed
By the Theta Crowd.

For she was a "perfect 36"
While they hit 32. —V.C.

Wonder if they'll Bing "Sweet Ade

Here lie the bones of Sophomore Pink,
Who told a Frosh to wear his dink.
