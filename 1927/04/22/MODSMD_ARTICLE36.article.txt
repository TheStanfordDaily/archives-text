# EXCESS EXPENDITURE FOR IDAHO ATHLETICS IS OBJECTION CAUSE
## 
### 
If expenditures by the athletic board
of the University of Idaho are not
soon brought within reason, that uni
versity will not long be allowed to
remain a member of the Pacific Coast
Conference, according to the execu
tive board of the A.S.U.I.
The ire of the board was aroused
by a report submitted for the expenses
of one man sent to "scout" a game at
Chicago, in which the expense account
allowed $18 for meals on the diner be
tween Chicago and Moscow, a trip of
approximately two and one-half days.
The board also objected to other ex
penses of the football and basketball
teams, which it termed as "unneces
sary."
