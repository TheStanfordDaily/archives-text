# ALUMNI OF HARVARD, YALE COMMEND PLANS ON GRIDIRON REFORM
## 
### 
Both the Harvard Alumni Bulletin
and the Yale Alumni Weekly have
commended the plan for football re
i
form put forth recently by President
Hopkins of Dartmouth University.
The Bulletin has this to say:
"The fact that other forms of sport
now depend on football earnings
should not stand in the way of sub
stantial corrections in the game if
they are greatly needed. If men who
are competent to pass judgment on
the situation as a whole are con
vinced that football has become or
soon will be a real menace to educa
tion in the American college, gate re
ceipts must not be permitted to block
the way to better things."
Future development of intercolle
gite sports is in line with President
Hopkins' plan, the Yale Alumni Week
ly says. In a irecent editorial the
Weekly stated:
"The football reforms which the
president of Dartmouth has recently
proposed to an interested and atten
tive public have in them the outstand
ing merit that they put the college
before the stadium and the real pur
pose of American higher education be
fore the demand for public college
sports. As such they deserve more
than passing notice and need to be
given thought."
