## Golf Alphabet—D 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
A well-known four-letter oath that
! begins with a capital "D," and is usu
ally followed by a Dash in all well
ordered golf cartoons showing a
; Divot-tee of the ancient and horrible
i pastime trying to blast his way out of
| a Ditch, is not the only word that be-
I gins with the fourth letter of the al
phabet that is connected with the
game of golf. There is Leo Diegel for
; instance, George Dupncan, and
| Frank Dolp, and many another D-ter
i mined young men who knows what it
is to play this "D-vine comedy" known
as cow-pasture pool, wherein D-spair
and D-light follow each other in rapid
| succession.
i
, Leo Diegel is a very well-known
professional golfer, who, like Abe
Mitchell, Mac Smith, and Bobby
I Cruickshank, has never won a United

I States or British open championship.
He has, however, won the Canadian
open title twice, and numerous lesser
championships. He is a hard fighter
with a sunny disposition and a power
ful pair of shoulders, which enabled
him, in 1920, to tie for second in the
United States open.
Another D-mon golfer is George Dun
can, the fastest player of them all,
one of the longest drivers, and the
holder of the world's lowest score for
I ;i6 holes. The canny Scot won the
British open championship in 1920, and
the French title in 1913.
Other D's who D-serve a place in the
Golf Alphabet are Frank Dolp, the 21-
year-old Portland, Oregon, lad who
won the 1926 Western amateur title;
Eddie Driggs, of Long Island, known
as one of the leading exponents of the

art of football and golf; Frank Dyer,
prominent New Jersey amateur who
has hold many championships; Mrs.
Temple Dobell, of England (formerly
Gladys Ravenscroft), who won the
United States women's tournament in
1913; Findlay S. Douglas, United
States amateur champion in IS9B, and
runner-up in *99 and 1900'; and Willie
Dunn, who won the very first United
States open competition back in 1894.
Last, but not least, are three promi
nent golf writers and authorities; Ber
nard Darwin, of London; Seymour
Dunn, and John Duncan, the last
named being the author of "A.B.C. of
Golf."
