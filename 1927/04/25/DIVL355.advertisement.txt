Serving is the best way
of Selling in the bond business
IT IS a disproven idea that bond selling is inertly
a matter of making friends and using them as a re
ceptive outlet for whatever issues come to hand. The
worth-while bond house docs not want its bonds sold
that way. It trains its representatives to work more
constructively.
When the house and the man representing it are
known for their carefulness in fitting the bond to the
investor, it builds confidence and subordinates sell
ing to serving.
Men who represent Halsey, Stuart & Co. are
trained in this policy. It enables them to grow in the
bond business and to find a worth-while outlet for
their capacity and ambition.
College men should find out all they can about the
bond business before deciding for or against it as a vo
cation. That will correct any erroneous ideas they
may have about it or their own fitness or lack of fit
ness for it.
You ivill find accurate and helpful information on this
uibjict in a pamphlet ive ha-ve prepared forcollege men.
