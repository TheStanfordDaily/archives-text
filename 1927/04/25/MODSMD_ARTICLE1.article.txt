Losing a ten-inning contest to the
Waseda University of Japan, the Stan
ford varsity baseball team closed its
1927 baseball season on the Stanford
diamond last Saturday. Leading up to
the seventh inning, the Cardinals were
tied and nosed out by the visiting
squad, 5 to 4. Sobieski pitched an ex
cellent game for Stanford, but four
errors by his teammates allowed the
Japanese to win the contest and even
the series.
Stanford got off to an early start in
the first inning, scoring one run. For
three innings Sobieski blanked the in
vaders, but in the first of the fourth
the score was tied by Waseda. Stan
ford came back strong in their half
of the inning, Stewart and Busch
scoring on John Rogers' double to
center. Nissen was tagged out at third
on the play, killing chances for an
other run.
Waseda Ties in Fifth
Waseda scored another run in the;
fifth, and Stanford added another in
the last of the sixth when Maguire
tripled to right field and scored on
the next play. With two men on base
in the first of the seventh, and with
only one out, Garibaldi lost an easy
chance for a double play when he
forced a runner at second and failed
to throw to first. A moment later
Himuro drove out a two-base hit, scor
ing two men and tying the score. In
trying to stretch the hit into a triple,
Himuro made the third out. Rogers
made a pretty put out on the play.
Sobieski and Haraguchi then battled
for two innings, but the Waseda team
finally squeezed over a run in their
half of the tenth. A single started the
inning, and the runner was advanced ,
to third on sacrifice hits. Captain J
Iguchi connected for another single, i
and the winning run crossed the plate, j
Nissen hobbled the ball, but his throw (
to second caught the husky third base- !
man off the sack. •
Rogers Star of Game
John Rogers was the outstanding!
star of the game, making several
flashy plays in the field and delivering
with a timely hit in the fourth. Never
theless, Coach Harry Wolter sent in
Marks to hit for Rogers in the tenth,
and he was easily fanned by Hara
guclii. Segi, Waseda lead-off man, led j
the day at bat with four singles and a 1
walk in five trips to the plate.
The Japanese nine will travel to Los |
Angeles where they will start an edu- j
cational tour of the United States, j
Coach Wolter plans to disband the ,
Stanford team, no further post-season {
