Forging ahead in the final frames of
their game with Zeta Psi last Friday
afternoon, Phi Gamma Delta captured
the most closely contested intramural
encounter of the afternoon by an 8 to
C> score. Beta Theta Pi took the meas
ure of Kappa Sigma by an 8 to 3
score; Sigma Alpha Epsilon won from
Alpha Delta Phi, 14 to 3, and Delta
Kappa Epsilon forfeited to Phi Sigma
Kappa in the other intramural con
ests of the week-end.
The lead in the Fiji-Zete game see
sawed back and forth during the en
counter. The Fijis scored three runs
in the first three innings, but lost this
lead in the third frame when the
Zetes tallied four times. Five more
runs by the Fijis in the fifth and sixth
innings proved too much of a lead for
the Zetes to overcome and a rally in
the last frame fell short two runs.
Gregory was on the mound for the
winners and struck out 17 men. Hanna
did the pitching for Zeta Psi. Heavy
hitting on the part of Russell and sev
eral costly errors on the part of the
Zetes aided in the Fiji victory.
Doug Lewis hurled the Betas to
victory in a game which was closely
contested until the last few innings.
In the sixth frame, A1 Herrington of
the winners clouted out a three-base
hit with the bases loaded which gave
his team a commanding lead. Wolf,
Kappa Sig hurler, did good work on
the mound and pulled out of several
bad holes by strikeouts.
S.A.E.'s Run Wild
Three pitchers were needed to stop
the batting spree of the S.A.E. nine in
its game with the Alpha Delts. Keigh,
Jayred, and Dennis were all used in
the order named. Three runs in the
first inning gave the S.A.E.'s a lead
which was never overcome. Several
untimely errors by the Alpha Delts,
together with heavy stick-work by
Ettinger and Peters, gave the S.A.E.'s
the majority of their tallies. La√üue
did the mound work for the winners.
