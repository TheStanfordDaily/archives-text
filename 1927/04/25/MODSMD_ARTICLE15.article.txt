### 
With 35,000 students and 53 camps,
the Citizens' Military Training Camps
will have the largest enrollment in
1927 they have ever had in their six
years' existence, Major W. D. Geary,
U.S.A., professor of Military Science
and Tactics at Stanford, announced
today.
Since a large number of students en
rolled in the local R.O.T.C. unit par
ticipate in the annual summer en
campments, this announcement will
create much interest, Major Geary be
lieves. Any who are interested, whe
ther they are in the R.O.T.C. or not,
may obtain information from the Mili
tary Department offices.
The government pays all transpor
tation expenses to and from the
camps, and also provides uniforms,
lodging, equipment, and food to the
C.M.T.C. students while at the various
camps. In addition to the regular mili
tary features, sports play an important
part in the thirty days' training period,
Major Geary pointed out. Many ex
pert coaches of national renown are
employed to give expert instruction to
the students. The whole purpose of
the camps is to develop tho youth of
the nation and teach them tho respon
sibilities of American citizenship, and
to do this young men of high ideals
are brought together on a common
basis of equality and under the most
favorable conditions of outdoor life,
he said.
These camps are a part of the gov
ernment's scheme to carry out the re
quirements of the National Defense
Act of 1920.
