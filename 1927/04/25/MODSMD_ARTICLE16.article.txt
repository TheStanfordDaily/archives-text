# ARTISTS CONTRIBUTE DISTINCTIVE MUSICALE IN TOYON HALL LOBBY
## Esther Allen Pleases All With Her Brilliant Contralto Voice 
### 
A program of distinctive musical se
lections was given last night in the
third annual musicale sponsored by
Toyon Club. Five artists, contributing
to the program, were called to give
frequent encores.
Esther Houck Allen gave a group of
contralto solos accompanied on the
piano by Warren 1). Allen. Iler rich
contralto was pleasing to hear, and
the warmth of her tones in her first
selection, Voci di Donne, was a marked
contrast to the brilliance of the encore,
Cuckoo.
Intermezzo and Ballade from
Brahms opus 18 were the two piano
solos rendered by Mary Elizabeth
Moynihan as the second group on the
program.
Singing a capella, Dr. Margery
Bailey interpreted folk songs of Eng
land, Norway, Ireland, and Scotland
in characteristic style.
Harold Griffin, a Stanford freshman,
placed himself in the class of contem
porary concert pianists by his display
of technical mastery of the instru
ment and artistic interpretation.
Winifred Estabrook, well known on
the campus for her performance in
"Princess Ida," renewed her popular
ity last night. Her personality supple
ments an unusual soprano voice to
make her a true artist.
