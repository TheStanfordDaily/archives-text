# BOARD SANCTIONS I.C.4A TRIP AFTER TRIUMPH OVER U.S.C.
## Records Set by Stanford Men Promise Victory In Nationals MANY UPSETS IN MEET Tilt Saturday Replete With Thrills; Broad Jumpers Make Fine Showing 
### Joe Carroll 
Shortly after the Stanford Unl
versity track team had defeated
the University of Southern Cali
fornia athletes, 75 to 56, the Board
of Athletic Control sanctioned a
trip to the IC-4A championships to
be held May 28. The number of
men to be taken will be decided
later.
Due to Saturday's victory over the
Trojans, Stanford will enter the 10-4A
favored heavily to win the national
championship. Then comes the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate meet June 3
and 4.
Final Events Decided Meet
The result of the meet was in doubt
until the last two events were decided.
Competition was so close that the
crowd was constantly on edge. Upset
after upset continually changed fore
casted results.
Captain Larry Babcock was shut out
of a place in the 440 when Sauers and
Lewis of Southern California placed
second and third to Bud Spencer.
Questionable tactics on the part of
U.S.C. competitors forced Speaker to
the outside of the track, keeping him
from making fast time, as well as
throwing Babcock off his stride.
When Hill, U.S.C., cleared 24 feet,
7 inches on his last leap, he was the
third contender to make a fair jump
of more than 24 feet. Dyer and Zombro
took second and third. Sid Meeks had
one jump over 24 feet. 7 inches, but it
was foul by a fraction of an inch.
Three men over 24 feet is something
of a record in dual meet competition.
McKinnon Starts Victories
Alex McKinnon's drive to victory in
the mile after being elbowed halfway
round the last lap by James Hussey,
Trojan, started Stanford off. He beat
Ches Unruh, Southern California star,
in the excellent time of 4:23 4-5.
Referee John Elliott disqualified ■
Hussev, giving Gooden of Stanford j
third place. The mile seems to cause '
a great deal of trouble in any Stanford-
U.S.C. meet. Considerable unfavorable !
comment was aroused both this year 1
and last due to Trojan tactics in at-1
tempting to win this event.
Bob King's 6 feet, 6 inch leap in the
high jump, Charlie Borah's victories in '
the 100 and 220, and Biff Hoffman's
double win in the shot and discus
were outstanding performances.
Card Hurdlers Rank High
Ross Nichols and Clarence West
proved their superiority in the hut dies.
These two are undoubtedly among the j
best hurdlers in the country.
Nichols won the high hurdles with i
West second. West won the lows with ;
Kaer second, and Nichols pulling up i
rapidly to take third only inches be- j
bind the Trojan.
Bob Swain and Rufus Ranney com-;
bined to take first and second in the |
two mile. Swain won his block "S" in
the last race that he will run for Stan-j
ford. The time was slow, but with
Ranney's co-operation, the majority of
the points in this event went to Stan- j
ford.
Run Relay in Fast Time
If the relay team had handled the
baton better, the time might have b.jen
very close to the best made by last
year's four, claimed to be the best t-U'.t
ever ran for Stanford. As it was, they
came within a second of the best time
made last year. 3.18 4-5, Saturday, com
pares favorably with the 3.17 3-5 rec
ord made last year.
Lovejoy's time in the half, 1:56 3-5, j
was the best that any half-miler on
either squad has made this year. Moss |
finished strong to take third, Gloegr:
of U.S.C. being second. The summary:

Ross Nichols and Clarence West
proved their superiority in the hut dies.
These two are undoubtedly among the j
best hurdlers in the country.
Nichols won the high hurdles with i
West second. West won the lows with ;
Kaer second, and Nichols pulling up i
rapidly to take third only inches be- j

Bob Swain and Rufus Ranney com-;
bined to take first and second in the |
two mile. Swain won his block "S" in
the last race that he will run for Stan-j
ford. The time was slow, but with
Ranney's co-operation, the majority of
the points in this event went to Stan- j

Run Relay in Fast Time
If the relay team had handled the
baton better, the time might have b.jen
very close to the best made by last
year's four, claimed to be the best t-U'.t
ever ran for Stanford. As it was, they
came within a second of the best time
made last year. 3.18 4-5, Saturday, com
pares favorably with the 3.17 3-5 rec

Lovejoy's time in the half, 1:56 3-5, j
was the best that any half-miler on

Shortly after the Stanford Unl

of Athletic Control sanctioned a
trip to the IC-4A championships to

Due to Saturday's victory over the
Trojans, Stanford will enter the 10-4A
favored heavily to win the national
championship. Then comes the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate meet June 3
and 4.
Final Events Decided Meet
The result of the meet was in doubt
until the last two events were decided.
Competition was so close that the
crowd was constantly on edge. Upset
after upset continually changed fore
casted results.
Captain Larry Babcock was shut out
of a place in the 440 when Sauers and
Lewis of Southern California placed
second and third to Bud Spencer.
Questionable tactics on the part of
U.S.C. competitors forced Speaker to
the outside of the track, keeping him
from making fast time, as well as
throwing Babcock off his stride.
When Hill, U.S.C., cleared 24 feet,
7 inches on his last leap, he was the
third contender to make a fair jump
of more than 24 feet. Dyer and Zombro
took second and third. Sid Meeks had
one jump over 24 feet. 7 inches, but it
was foul by a fraction of an inch.
Three men over 24 feet is something
of a record in dual meet competition.
McKinnon Starts Victories
Alex McKinnon's drive to victory in
the mile after being elbowed halfway

Trojan, started Stanford off. He beat
Ches Unruh, Southern California star,
in the excellent time of 4:23 4-5.
Referee John Elliott disqualified ■
Hussev, giving Gooden of Stanford j
third place. The mile seems to cause '
a great deal of trouble in any Stanford-

comment was aroused both this year 1

Shortly after the Stanford Unl
versity track team had defeated
the University of Southern Cali
fornia athletes, 75 to 56, the Board
of Athletic Control sanctioned a
trip to the IC-4A championships to
be held May 28. The number of
men to be taken will be decided
later.
Due to Saturday's victory over the
Trojans, Stanford will enter the 10-4A
favored heavily to win the national
championship. Then comes the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate meet June 3
and 4.
Final Events Decided Meet
The result of the meet was in doubt
until the last two events were decided.
Competition was so close that the
crowd was constantly on edge. Upset
after upset continually changed fore
casted results.
Captain Larry Babcock was shut out
of a place in the 440 when Sauers and
Lewis of Southern California placed
second and third to Bud Spencer.
Questionable tactics on the part of
U.S.C. competitors forced Speaker to
the outside of the track, keeping him
from making fast time, as well as
throwing Babcock off his stride.
When Hill, U.S.C., cleared 24 feet,
7 inches on his last leap, he was the
third contender to make a fair jump
of more than 24 feet. Dyer and Zombro
took second and third. Sid Meeks had
one jump over 24 feet. 7 inches, but it
was foul by a fraction of an inch.
Three men over 24 feet is something
of a record in dual meet competition.
McKinnon Starts Victories
Alex McKinnon's drive to victory in
the mile after being elbowed halfway
round the last lap by James Hussey,
Trojan, started Stanford off. He beat
Ches Unruh, Southern California star,
in the excellent time of 4:23 4-5.
Referee John Elliott disqualified ■
Hussev, giving Gooden of Stanford j
third place. The mile seems to cause '
a great deal of trouble in any Stanford-
U.S.C. meet. Considerable unfavorable !
comment was aroused both this year 1
and last due to Trojan tactics in at-1
tempting to win this event.
Bob King's 6 feet, 6 inch leap in the
high jump, Charlie Borah's victories in '
the 100 and 220, and Biff Hoffman's
double win in the shot and discus
were outstanding performances.
Card Hurdlers Rank High
Ross Nichols and Clarence West
proved their superiority in the hut dies.
These two are undoubtedly among the j
best hurdlers in the country.
Nichols won the high hurdles with i
West second. West won the lows with ;
Kaer second, and Nichols pulling up i
rapidly to take third only inches be- j
bind the Trojan.
Bob Swain and Rufus Ranney com-;
bined to take first and second in the |
two mile. Swain won his block "S" in
the last race that he will run for Stan-j
ford. The time was slow, but with
Ranney's co-operation, the majority of
the points in this event went to Stan- j
ford.
Run Relay in Fast Time
If the relay team had handled the
baton better, the time might have b.jen
very close to the best made by last
year's four, claimed to be the best t-U'.t
ever ran for Stanford. As it was, they
came within a second of the best time
made last year. 3.18 4-5, Saturday, com
pares favorably with the 3.17 3-5 rec
ord made last year.
Lovejoy's time in the half, 1:56 3-5, j
was the best that any half-miler on
either squad has made this year. Moss |
finished strong to take third, Gloegr:
of U.S.C. being second. The summary:
