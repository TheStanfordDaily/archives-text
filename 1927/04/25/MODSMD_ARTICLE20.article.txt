Shortly after the Stanford Unl
versity track team had defeated
the University of Southern Cali
fornia athletes, 75 to 56, the Board
of Athletic Control sanctioned a
trip to the IC-4A championships to
be held May 28. The number of
men to be taken will be decided
later.
Due to Saturday's victory over the
Trojans, Stanford will enter the IC-4A
favored heavily to win the national
championship. Then comes the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate meet June 3
and 4.
Final Events Decided Meet
The result of the meet was in doubt
until the last two events were decided.
Competition was so close that the
crowd was constantly on edge. Upset
after upset continually changed fore
casted results.
Captain Larry Babcock was shut out
of a place in the 440 when Sauers and
Lewis of Southern California placed
second and third to Bud Spencer.
Questionable tactics on the part of
U.S.C. competitors forced Spencer to
the outside of the track, keeping him
from making fast time, as well as
throwing Babcock off his stride.
When Hill, U.S.C., cleared 24 feet,
7 inches on his last leap, he was the
third contender to make a fair jump
of more than 24 feet. Dyer and Zombro
took second and third. Sid Meeks had
one jump over 24 feet, 7 inches, but it
was foul by a fraction of an inch.
Three men over 24 feet is something
of a record in dual meet competition.
McKinnon Starts Victories
Alex McKinnon's drive to victory in
the mile after being elbowed halfway
round the last lap by James Hussey,
Trojan, started Stanford off. He beat
