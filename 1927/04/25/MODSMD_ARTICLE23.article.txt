# The 						Wrong Kind of Fight
## 
### 
All the pleasure is taken out of meeting" the University of Southern
California in athletic matches, because of the poor sportsmanship that
the 1 rojans exhibit in every type of encounter. Poor sportsmanship is
a mild name for the deliberate "dirty" running" of several of the U.S.C.
men last Saturday.
In the mile, one of the Trojan runners forced McKinnon past the
middle of the track by elbowing" and pushing" the Stanford man 011 the
curve of the last lap. It was "dirty," it was deliberate, and it was crude.
In the quarter mile. Spencer, who had drawn the inside lane, was forced
to run to the other side of the track to keep from falling" when one of
the Trojan pace-setters twice tried to trip the StanforcTman. Of course,
the Southern California runners were coached to run in that manner,
but that does not excuse the men that carry out the orders.
Track, above all sports, should be clean. Track athletes are before
the public eyes as individuals, not as a part of a team. The track and
field men can demonstrate their strength, skill, and speed in a way no
other type of sport affords. A runner who disgraces himself in such an
exhibit should be prohibited from ever running another race.
U.S.CVs spirit has been demonstrated to Stanford before. In the
last basketball game this season, the Trojan captain was asked to leave
the floor. In the other cage matches, the referee had to run for self
protection after one of his decisions. The less said about football the
better for U.S.C.
Stanford should eliminate Southern California from its list of oppon
ents. Who cares whether songs are started about "Stanford refuses to
play the Trojans because they treat our boys too rough," et cetera? Stan
ford should refuse to play the Trojans, and keep sports 011 the Coast
011 the right basis.
