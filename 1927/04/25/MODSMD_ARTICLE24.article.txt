# On Practical Theology
## 
### 
Dr. Hugh Black will talk in the Memorial Church tonight, opening a
series of Raymond Fred \\ est Memorial Lectures on immortality, human
conduct, and human -destiny. "The Adventure of Faith" is the topic
chosen for tonight's talk. This series of lectures is the very thing that
University students have been waiting for. Dr. Black is a teacher of
practical theology; he is an upholder of the modern scientific view of
the world. lie maintains that today the theory of evolution and all other
attempts of science to explain things on the basis of experience are not
to be questioned.
Students are very skeptical about religion, and this series of lectures
will give these young men and women the chance to hear a professor of
practical theology. Dr. Black has a reputation of being a preacher who
is extremely popular with university students. Students all over the
country have have listened to him, and always with the highest respect,
for he builds up his arguments from a sound foundation. Men and
women of university age have little patience with discussions on religion
when they are based on a limited knowledge and end at no satisfactory
conclusionâ€”the end is just as vague as the beginning.
Students are interested in the general subject that Dr. Black is to
talk about. This interest is shown by the topic that bull sessions tend to
follow. The subjects of the West lectures are about the same that
students talk about when a group of men or women gather in a room at
late hours. The subjects of bull sessions are usually on such topics as
"If a Man Dies Shall He Live Again?" "Why We May Believe in Life
After Death," and "What Is Man?" Even the hardest boiled man at
Stanford enjoys expressing his opinion 011 such subjects'and hearing
others talk about them. It is an opportunity to be able to hear a gentle
man, who has studied such things, give his opinion 011 these questions.
