# At the Stroke of Nine
## 
### 
The Dartmouth newspaper prints the following box on the top of
the front page of an edition last week:
1930 Rules Off
"All Freshman Class rules and restrictions will be with
drawn promptly at 9 o'clock this evening."
At the stroke of nine freshmen will be transformed into men, unham
pered by restrictions and able to do a little thinking on their own part.
It's just like the fairy talc of Cinderella being changed at a minute's
notice from a kitchen maid to a princess, and then back to a kitchen
maid again.
