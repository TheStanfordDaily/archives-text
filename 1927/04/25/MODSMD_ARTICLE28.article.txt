INCIDENTAL TO A VICTORY
Newspaper accounts of a track meet j
such as the one in which Stanford
triumphed over the University of
Southern California are necessarily
written in a businesslike manner
which entails the omission of details
that are of great interest to violent
partisans. Last Saturday, aside from
the matter of winning the meet, Stan- -
ford men did several things that are
worthy of special mention.
For instance, something should be
said of that two-mile, and the way in !
which Bob Swain came through to
win his Block S, while Ranney con
tented himself with a second place,;
jockeying the leading Trojan into a !
third.
Some mention should also be made
of the mile, and of McKinnon's fight
ing finish, made after his anger had 1
been aroused by the most unsports
manlike gesture seen on a Stanford
track in many years.
And while the subject is under dis
cussion, let us say something else
about these boys who just came
through this season. So much mention
is always made of the outstanding
performers in these affairs.
In the Big Meet, who was there whew
was not glad to see John Truman
make his letter. For three years Tru

man lias run the longest aiul most
gruelling race on the track. And for
three years Truman has been told that
he was forcing himself to race over
the long route. But in every race he
has finished. And in every race he
has sprinted for the finish, even
though three men had crossed it he
fore him. And last week, in the last
Dig Meet of his career, he stuck to
his work as usual. And was it not a
sort of justice that only three men
should finish the race and that John
Truman should be one of them?
To have Stanford men distinguish
themselves by winning track mee.3
is getting to be rather a regular
thing, thanks in large measure to the
efforts of the great Stanford man.
Dink Templeton. But it will never be
too common a matter for comment *.o
have Stanford men distinguish them
selves by commendable performances
like those mentioned.
The end of the regular season of
dual meets is truly a time for all
Stanford people to feel proud of their
University, and of the men who repre
sent her 011 the track and field.

The end of the regular season of
dual meets is truly a time for all
Stanford people to feel proud of their
University, and of the men who repre

At the "Arts Ball" Friday night the
'orchestra rendered "Sons of the Stan
ford R£d." There was a large and en
thusiastic vocal chorus from the floor.
INCIDENTAL TO A VICTORY
Newspaper accounts of a track meet j
such as the one in which Stanford
triumphed over the University of
Southern California are necessarily
written in a businesslike manner
which entails the omission of details
that are of great interest to violent
partisans. Last Saturday, aside from
the matter of winning the meet, Stan- -
ford men did several things that are
worthy of special mention.
For instance, something should be
said of that two-mile, and the way in !
which Bob Swain came through to
win his Block S, while Ranney con
tented himself with a second place,;
jockeying the leading Trojan into a !
third.
Some mention should also be made
of the mile, and of McKinnon's fight
ing finish, made after his anger had 1
been aroused by the most unsports
manlike gesture seen on a Stanford
track in many years.
And while the subject is under dis
cussion, let us say something else
about these boys who just came
through this season. So much mention
is always made of the outstanding
performers in these affairs.
In the Big Meet, who was there whew
was not glad to see John Truman
make his letter. For three years Tru

man lias run the longest aiul most
gruelling race on the track. And for
three years Truman has been told that
he was forcing himself to race over
the long route. But in every race he
has finished. And in every race he
has sprinted for the finish, even
though three men had crossed it he
fore him. And last week, in the last
Dig Meet of his career, he stuck to
his work as usual. And was it not a
sort of justice that only three men
should finish the race and that John
Truman should be one of them?
To have Stanford men distinguish
themselves by winning track mee.3
is getting to be rather a regular
thing, thanks in large measure to the
efforts of the great Stanford man.
