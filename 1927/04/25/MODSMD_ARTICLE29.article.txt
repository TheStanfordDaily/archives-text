ZERO, by CoUinson Oven. Dodd, Mead,
Co.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, by Irvin
S. Cobb.
Suppose you were forty or there
abouts, and life was not going well
with you—wife indifferent, son too
young to understand, nothing to inter
est you except writing novels —your
only purpose in the world, to all ap
pearances, to pay somebody else's
hills. Would there not he in your heart
a desire to wipe the old slate clean
and start over again from zero?
If you were a man like John Garth,
Mr. Collinson Owen's engaging hero,
you would feel just that way—only
you would probably not get the chance
to do it, as John Garth did. It is easy
to see, therefore, that what happened
to John Garth when he started over
again must make interesting reading
—and it does, from the time he starts
on his journey to the South of Europe
until he tells the reporters all about
it in the last chapter.
Of course, with such an idea for a
novel, only a bungler could make any
thing else than a good story—and Col
linson Owen, though I have never
heard his name before, is no bungler.
If his story limps a little at the start,

I it travels at top speed once it gets
I under way, and you follow the for
: tunes of John Garth and he suddenly
I becomes another man, far, far into the
j night. Few stories of recent issue will
i better repay the reader who likes his
J stories clean-cut and exciting, yet
j withal probable.

The idea of starting over again from
j zero seems not to have been patented
; by Mr. Owen, however. You will find
jit in all its purity, though in a very
different setting, in Mr. Cobb's new
book of short stories, "Ladies and Gen
tlemen." It is the theme of a tale
I called "Two of Everything," which I
| vote one of the great short stories of
j recent years. O. Henry could well have
been proud of this one; and Rudyard
Kipling would have no cause to be
ashamed of it.
I There are eight or ten other stories
in the book, some of them redolent of
(he humorist America knows so well;
)thers with a deep vein of pathos. All
of them, however —and this is no.
facile exaggeration—show the mark
of an artist; the man who can create
characters and devise unusual situa
tions. These things stay with you for
awhile; they are hewn out of Ameri
can life by one who knows it.

on his journey to the South of Europe
until he tells the reporters all about
it in the last chapter.
Of course, with such an idea for a
novel, only a bungler could make any
thing else than a good story—and Col
linson Owen, though I have never
heard his name before, is no bungler.
If his story limps a little at the start,

I it travels at top speed once it gets
I under way, and you follow the for

jit in all its purity, though in a very

I called "Two of Everything," which I

ZERO, by CoUinson Oven. Dodd, Mead,

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, by Irvin
S. Cobb.
Suppose you were forty or there
abouts, and life was not going well
with you—wife indifferent, son too
young to understand, nothing to inter
est you except writing novels —your
only purpose in the world, to all ap
pearances, to pay somebody else's
hills. Would there not he in your heart
a desire to wipe the old slate clean
and start over again from zero?
If you were a man like John Garth,
Mr. Collinson Owen's engaging hero,
you would feel just that way—only
you would probably not get the chance
to do it, as John Garth did. It is easy
to see, therefore, that what happened
to John Garth when he started over
again must make interesting reading
—and it does, from the time he starts
on his journey to the South of Europe
until he tells the reporters all about
it in the last chapter.
