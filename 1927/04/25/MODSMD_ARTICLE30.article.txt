# SWALLOWS REAPPEAR WITH GOOD WEATHER IN INNER QUADRANGLE
## 
### 
While passing back and forth on the
inner Quad, most students seem com
pletely oblivious to the near-by exist- \
ence of about two hundred representa
tives of Petrochelidon lunifrons.
Stanford's own colony of cliff swal- j
lows, eave swallows, or mud-daubers, I
as they are commonly called, has re
turned to its group of nests under the |
eaves of the Inner Quad and the Me
morial Court after its yearly migration I
to some part of Central or South
America. They made their first ap
pearance on spring quarter registra
tion day, and have since come back
on two of the warmest days of the
past week. Although they are migra
tory birds, Professor John O. Snyder
of the zoology department is unable
short flights.
The swallows' return signifies the j
start of the breeding season. They j
must rebuild the nests they have used
during the past years since all were
destroyed by campus janitors recently.
The birds have already begun building
the "gourd or retort shaped structure,
neck downward, made of pellets of
mud mixed with a few straws and 1
lined with feathers" which are their
nests.
The swallow itself is distinguishable
in the field by its brownish plumage, 1
squarish tail, duffy forehead, and the
purring note in its call.
Many more unmarried than married
people are arrested, statistics show.
