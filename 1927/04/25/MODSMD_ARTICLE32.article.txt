THE ROMANCE OF RESEARCH
He went down to the chem lab;
"Test everything," they said,
"Take no one's word for anything,
"From now until you're dead."
He went upon a party,
Where water, it was said,
Would never mix with alcohol;
He tried it —now lie's dead. —E.W.C.

THAT HELLO SPIRIT
I passed a tall, husky senior.
I said, "Hello!"
But he walked on.
He didn't speak.
I met an overgrown baboon in cords.
I said, "Hello!"
But lie must have forgotten our custom,
lie didn't speak.
1 saw a pale, anaemic little guy
About 104 and five-two.
I said, "Hello!"
Lucky for him
He spoke! - —V.C.
