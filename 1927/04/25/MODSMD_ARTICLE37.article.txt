# BASEBALL'S TWO RAREST FEATS
## 
### Feg Murray 
The two rarest feats in baseball gj-e |
â– the perfect game'and the triple play,
unassisted. Oddly enough, there have j
been five of each in the history of.
major leagues. Only live times in!
I
over fifty years has a pitcher sent I
twenty-seven enemy batsmen hack to
the bench without one of them reach- 1
ing first base, or has an infielder re-j
tired three opponents on one play
without receiving any help from a.
team-mate. ,
The five "no-hit, no-run, no-player I
reaching first base," heroes listed in :
baseball's Hall of Fame are as fol-.
lows: J. Lee Richmond, of Worchest- j
er;John M. Ward, of Providence; Den-j
ton Teehumseh Young, of Boston (A. j
L.) ; Adrian C. Joss, of Cleveland;
and Charles C. Robertson, of the
Chicago White Sox. For a time
George Washington Bradley of St.

| the Indians, against Brooklyn in a |
Louis was listed as the first of them ;
I all, hut it was since proved that he i
walked one man, and that possibly
| another opponent reached first on an
error.
It is a very curious thing that Rich-1
! moiul and Ward pitched their perfect J
games only five days apart. Rich- j
| mond shut out Cleveland without a !
hit on June 12, 1880, while Ward's |
; record was made against Buffalo on j
: June 17. Over twenty-four years
I elapsed before "Cy" Young joined the
Immortals by beating the Athletics 3
I to 0 without letting one of them reach 1
first, on May 5, 1904. On October 2,;
1908, Addie Joss of Cleveland pitched
| to only twenty-seven of the Chicago
White Sox and beat Ed Walsh 1 to 0.
"No-hit Charley" Robertson, who is j
now with the Braves, after a brief j
lapse into the minors, whitewashed

the hard-hitting Detroit Club in sev
eral ways on April 30, 1922, in his
second week in the majors! As Ethel
Barrymore was wont to ssay, "That's
all there is, there isn't anymore!"
To return to that other rarity of
the diamond, the unassisted triple
play, it must be said that some rec
ords, notably "The Little Red Book,"
of Spalding's Athletic Library, credit
Paul Hines of Providence with mak
ing such a fielding play against Bos
ton on May 8, IS7B, but I leave that
out because Ernest J. Lanigan in the
"Baseball Cyclopedia," says that the
late William M. Rankin investigated
this performance and could find no
proof of it. Those who have officially
done this difficult stunt are as fol
lows: Neal Ball, of Cleveland, July
19, 1909, against the Boston Red
Sox; William Wambsganss, also of

! world series game, October 10, 1920;
CJeorge Burns, Red Sox vs. Cleve
land, September 14, 1923; Ernest K.
Pargett, Boston Braves vs. Phillies,
second game, October 6, 1923 (it was
Padgett's second week in the majors),
and Glenn Wright, of the Pirates, vs.
St. Louis, May 7, 1925.
It should be noted that Cleveland
j figures in three of these fielding class
| ics, and in one of the pitching per
j formances.
