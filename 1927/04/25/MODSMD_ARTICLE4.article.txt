# CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING BOUTS ASSURED; WILL BE FOUGHT THURSDAY
## Ample Number of Men Sign Up to Insure Success Of Mitt Tourney 
### 
Since at least four men in each of
the weight divisions had signified their
intentions to compete for the Univer
sity boxing championships, by 6
o'clock Saturday night, Henry W. Ma
loney, boxing coach, announces that
all of the bouts will be run off as
originally scheduled.
Because there are more than four
men lined up for several of the weight
classes, preliminary bouts will take
place Tuesday evening, April 26, in
the gym in order to reduce the number
of entrants to four for the semi-final
and final rounds of the tournament. At
7:30 o'clock Thursday evening, April
28, the latter bouts will be held at the
Basketball Pavilion.
Admission to those having student
body cards is free both to the pre
liminary and final pugilistic encoun
ters. The general admission charge
will be 50 cents on Thursday night.
