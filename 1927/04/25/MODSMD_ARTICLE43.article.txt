OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, April 21. â€”Seniors in civil en
gineering are building a fifty-eight
foot bridge of the truss type for the
W.C.T.U. children's farm home near
here. When the original bridge was
washed away by high water last win
ter, the local student chapter of the
American Society of Civil Engineering
formed itself from a purely technical
society into a public service organiza
tion by offering to replace the ruined
structure with a new one. Students
made their own plans and drawings,
estimated the amounts of material
used, and are working on their own
time at the site.
