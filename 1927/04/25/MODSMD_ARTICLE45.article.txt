"In spite of the blinding glare of |
glory that surrounds the college foot- j
ball hero during his undergraduate
days, in after life he must yield the '
crown of success to other less spec
tacular classmates, who excelled in
scholarship, and obtained prominence
in other student activities." This state
ment was made by Robert Sibley,
executive manager of the University
of California alumni association, after j
he had completed a survey of the life j
accomplishments of the twelve greatest
football heroes, and the best-known
Phi Beta Kappa students, who gradu
ated during the period of 1597 to 1904.
"It is my conclusion," he says, that [
there is a very definite relationship
between distinguished scholarly j
achievement in undergraduate life and
its fuller fruition in the business and
professional world. Only one of the
twelve football heroes had his name
in 'Who's Wbo,' while all twelve of
the honor students were listed in that
volume."
