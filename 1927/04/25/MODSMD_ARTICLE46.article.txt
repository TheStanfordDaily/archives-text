# Butterflies Not Wanted At University of Texas
## 
### 
;
"The University of Texas has*"no
place for the girl who comes to col
lege for the purpose of living the life :
of a social butterfly." This is the |
opinion of Miss Ruby Terrill, dean of
women at that institution. This is one j
of the three types of which the dean '
disapproves. "Another of these is the
student who has not yet reached a
sufficiently mature age to make wise,
common-sense decisions, while the
third is the one who has barely man
aged to slide through her final high
school work."
