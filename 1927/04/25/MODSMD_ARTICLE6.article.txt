### 
Fifty per cent of the youth of the
nation who plan to enter college this
fall will do better if they go directly
into business, says President William
H. P. Faunce of Brown University in
thq current issue of the American
Magazine.
President Faunce declares that most
of the boys who go to college are fail
ures, in the sense that they fail to
graduate. There is no other career,
for which men are so definitely pre
pared, in which there is such an apal
ling proportion of failures.
