# CAST, CHORUSES OF "WICKED WILLIAM" START WORK ON INTENSIVE REHEARSALS
## Finishing Touches Given Manuscript; Musical Plot Finished by Wakefield, Wiggin; Sent to Orchestrator 
### 
llflTH all the preliminary work finished, the cast and choruses of "Wicked
William," the 1927 Junior Opera, have started on their final two weeks
of intensive rehearsals for the night of nights, Saturday, May 7, which marks
the presentation of the musical comedy and the culmination of Junior Week.
Originally written by R. Frank Baker and Winston Norman, the manu
script has been given the finishing touches in the past two weeks' rehearsals
by an expert group of gag-makers, including the authors, Gordon Davis,
Director of Dramatics, and the cast.
Last Friday the musical plot was completed and has been sent to the
orchestrator. The best songs for the comedy have been written by two
familiar campus musicians and composers, Jean Wakefield and Jack Wiggin,
veterans of previous Stanford operas and vaudevilles. Wiggin directed the
music in last year's Ram's Head show and Junior Opera, for which he also

>wrote several of the popular songs.
Miss Wakefield has had some of her
music played by the inimitable Paul
Whiteman. She has written the lyrics
for her own songs, and Wiggin, in
collaboration with Robert T. Paine, of
Chaparral and beard fame, has com
posed the others. The musical plot is
being directed and supervised by Gor
don Hall.
Francis Boone, dance director, is
putting the three choruses through
daily rehearsals of the intricate steps,
and, furthermore, is teaching them to
co-ordinate their dancing with their
singing—and they have plenty of
songs and dances.
Even the cast of "Wicked William"
is holding daily rehearsals and is
whipping the lines into polished condi
tion. Hal Boomer has been definitely
cast as Count Anchova, and Kenneth
Lloyd fills the part of Count Pushov.
These two characters form the comedy
center of the plot. Dorothy Garner, as
Isabel Potter, and Charles Moore, in
the role of her husband, William —
from which the opera derives its name
—are the characters around whom the
play revolves.
Tickets for the musical comedy will
be placed 011 sale Wednesday, at ?1
and $1.25.
