# LEVITT, INDEPENDENT, WINS FIRST IN GOLF DRIVING COMPETITION
## 
### 
Jack Levitt, Independent, was the
victor in the 1927 driving contest last
Saturday morning in the polo field.
Levitt hit his best tee-shot out 258
yards, which is good considering the
slippery stance with which all com
petitiors had to contend. This was
just long enough to take first place
away from Bill Clough, Encina, who
had been leading with a drive of 251
yards since the early part of the con
test. Third place went to Neil Miller,
Alpha Delta Phi, with a drive of 247
yards.
Nearly thirty men turned out in this
contest for the C. W. Holt trophy. The
marks, however, did not come up to
those made last year, probably be
cause of the heavy grass which pre
vented the balls from rolling.
Before the contest Eddie Meyberg
and Dink Templeton hit out some ex
hibition shots which measured about
265 yards.
