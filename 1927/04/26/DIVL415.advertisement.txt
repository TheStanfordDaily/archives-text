AUTOMATIC ADDS HOURS TO
YOUR SUNDAY OUTING
Do you pet a late start on your Sunday outing because
of preparing lunch in the morning? Not necessary with
an Automatic. You can make up your sandwiches and
other good things the evening before and preserve them
safely until you go. Will be just as fresh and tasty
when taken out as when put in.
Come in and see the Automatic in all the different sizes,
and at prices you can afford to pay.
