Fourth week of the intramural base
ball season opened yesterday after
noon with three games played and
three forfeited. A victory by Encina IV
over Phi Kappa Sigma on the Sequoia
diamond gave the race for league
leadership an unexpected turn.
Phi Kappa Sigma, after emerging
victors from two hard contests, and
tying the heavy-hitting Phi Delta
Theta nine last week to establish
themselves as serious contenders for
the title, showed a complete reversal
of form yesterday, and the freshmen
of Encina easily took a win.
Poor Pitching
The two fraternity pitchers, Ed
munds and Evans, were equally inef
fective, the former allowing seven
runs, and the latter six more, while
Pettingil, although being hit frequent
ly, gave good support in the pinches.
Nelson Smith at third base, and Cath
cart behind the plate, starred for the
freshmen.
Theta Delta Chi, using Painter in
the box and Hartley as catcher, held
the Chi Psi nine helpless during most
of the game, at the same time estab
lishing a good lead in the early in
nings which was never headed. In the
first frame, Orton knocked out a home
run with two men on base for the
winners, scoring three runs. Van King
in tlie box for the losers, had a good
curve and plenty of speed but weak
ened at times, and with some wobbly
support in the infield, was hit for the
winning runs.
Sequoia played in championship
form yesterday, hitting hard and often,
getting good pitching, and giving able
support. Quinn on the mound had the
El Toro players completely under con
trol, allowing only scattered hits and
a few walks after having a winning
lead. Lou Snyder put the hall team
ahead in the very beginning with a
home run, scoring two in front of him,
while hits in every inning thereafter
counted for many runs.
