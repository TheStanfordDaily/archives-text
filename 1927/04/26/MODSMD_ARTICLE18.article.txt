# PALO ALTO LIBRARY SEEKS TO RETURN WANDERING BOOKS
## 
### 
"Where Are My Wandering
Books Tonight?" the song of the
Palo Alto librarian, will, after
next week, be changed to "Hail,
Hail, the Gang's All Here." For
during next week no fines will
be charged for overdue books at
the Palo Alto Public Library. A
"Bargain Box" will be placed in
the entrance hall of the building
and hooks which are long past
due may be dropped in this box,
and no questions will be asked.
College students are particu
larly asked to observe this Home
coming week for prodigal books
that have strayed, unintention
ally, and which are now drifting
around the campus with no one
to properly care for them.
