# BUILDING UP NATIONAL SPIRIT MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM IN BRAZIL
## Professor Martin Talks on Social Conditions in South America 
### 
"The people of Brazil are more
friendly toward the United States
than any other South Americans, with
the possible exception of the Peru
vians," declared Professor Percy A.
Martin, of the History department, at
the Cosmopolitan Club meeting in the
Women's Clubhouse last night. "Equal
ing our country in size, and possessing
enormous natural resources, Brazil
considers itself the natural leader of
the southern continent. Its people do
not suspect the United States of im
perialistic designs as do many other
South American nations."
Informally discussing his recent trip
throughout South America, Professor
Martin touched on the social condi
tions in all the countries he visited,
emphasizing those in Brazil. "Negroes
are given equality of opportunity
there," he said, "which is a striking
contrast to their position in our own
country. Many colored men hold high
professional positions, but are not re
ceived as social and political equals.
Despite the great number of negroes,
Brazil is in no danger of becoming
mulatto because the negro mortality
is much higher than the white, and
there Is a steady stream of white im
migrants pouring into the country.
Brazil's biggest problem at present is
the creation of a national spirit, its
provinces being very far flung and
poorly united."
