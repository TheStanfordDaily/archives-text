tain of the 1928 Stanford track
team at a meeting of the varsity
track squad yesterday afternoon.
Fifteen men will represent Stanford
University at the West Coast Relays
to be held Saturday in Fresno. The
track and field carnival will be the
main afternoon attraction for the
Raisin Day Festival. Nearly 500 en
tries have been filed in Fresno for
Saturday's events. Stars from all over
California will compete.
Nichols to Run
The Cardinals are entered in every
event open to them excepting the
hundred-yard dash. There are only two
track events in the meet, the 100 and
120 high hurdles. Ross Nichols will
compete in the high hurdle race.
Captain Lawrence Babcock, 'Emer
son Spencer, Clarence West, and Rob
ert Syer will run in the half-mile and
mile relays. Each man runs 220 yards
in the half-mile relay, and 440 in the
mile.
Tom Moss, Bill Clum, Jack Dales,
and Alex McKinnon will each run a
half mile in the two-mile relay.
Robert King is entered in the high j
jump, which he is favored to win.
Hoffman to Take Events
Biff Hoffman should take first in
both the shotput and the discus throw,
the two events in which he will com- I
pete.
Ted Shipkey is to go down to Fresno :
for the javelin throw. Tom Joaquin j
will not make the trip, due to an in- j
jured shoulder. Coach Dink Temple- j
ton intends to give Tom a rest so that |'
he will be in shape far the I.C.A.A.A.A. |
championship meet next month.
Fred Zombro and Kimball Dyer are I
expected to take places in the broad I
jump. Ward Edmonds should score'
some points in the pole vault.
Competition in the relays should be 1
especially keen, as some very fast 1
squads from Southern California col
leges will strive for honors in these
races. The University of Southern
California is sending its regular teams
and first-string competitors to Seattle,
but is expected to enter freshmen and
second-string outfits in several of the j
events. ~
