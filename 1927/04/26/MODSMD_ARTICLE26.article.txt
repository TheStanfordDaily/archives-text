# Leaders of Men
## 
### 
Now that all major sport competition with the University of I ali
fornia is over for the year, the problem of choosing' captains tor the
teams for the next season is before the students. The football and
basketball squads preferred to elect their leaders after the beginning of
the next seasons. Ihe benefits to be derived from deferred elections
have already been elaborated upon. Now the problem is whether the
baseball and tenuis teams will pass rulings similar to the action made
by the football and basketball men.
Yesterday the track squad elected Bud Spencer as track captain, and,
as it appears today, no better man could have been chosen for the position.
Spencer is undoubtedly the outstanding star 011 this years \arsit\, he
sides being a most likeable fellow. Ihe possibility of Spencer being oil
form next year appears very slim right now. Spencer is surely the
logical man for captain of the 1 track team. But this does not
change the situation as far as the other sports are concerned, for excep
tions never prove the rule. Besides Spencer would have undoubtedly
proved his ability at the beginning of next season, and have been elected
captain at that time.
If a captaincy is a mere compliment for action during the season, it
may be that the present system of election is suitable, but there is the
possibility that a captain is an important cog in the working of a smooth
running athletic machine. The most capable man should be chosen to
pilot the team to victory, and port "victory" is more likely to be reached
if a superior athlete is elected as pilot.
Comparing an athletic team to a business, it is perfectly conceivable
to imagine the board of trustees of a concern choosing a very nice fellow
for the presidency, but it is much more probable that the directors will
pick the man who is most capable of running the firm in a successful
manner. Greater profits will be realized for the corporation by such
careful selection. Money profits and honor gains are not so different.
Next season, if this year's teams will make the decision, the whole
squads can meet and be able to choose a man for leader who is capable
of carrying the honor during that season.
