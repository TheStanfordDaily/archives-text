# Violating Their Own Rules
## 
### 
With the rushing - season going down the last stretch and nearing the
final curve, rumors of violations are circulating about the campus. When
fraternities see the end of the race approaching, they often become
desperate and rules are forgotten in the rush for the tape.
If the fraternities would realize that in breaking a rule, they are
violating the gentleman's agreement that exists among the twenty-four
houses on the campus, they might be more honest about their rushing
parties. The rushing system at Stanford is reputed as being one of the
best in the country, and it is up to the Greeks to keep it so.
So far this season no violations have been reported officially, but there
are some murmurs going around about this house or that house taking
freshmen to the City or San Jose. A house that is forced to go to such
trouble to demonstrate its prowess is evidently in a weak position on the
■campus. The beauty of the present system of rushing is that the fresh
iflen have the chance to see the fraternity men in their natural state of
consciousness.
