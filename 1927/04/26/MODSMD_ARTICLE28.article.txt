There is a large number of foreign languages—French, German,
Italian, Japanese, Italian, Hungarian—but the college student has a
language all his own. Tune in 011 a conversation of a couple of collegiate

"Listen, kid, don't be a green pea and date her, she's a gold-digger."
"Ah, you're all wet, I know a mean number when I see one. I'm
going to favor her by dragging her to the skid tonight."
"Well, all right, but don't try to hang any goobers."
The baby in the crib coos forth a queer dialect, and the grammar
school boy his pig Latin, but nothing can equal the language of the
American college student.
