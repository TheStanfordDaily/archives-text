One Professor Snow of Wesleyan University has discovered what
the wonderful something is that has been missing from our lives. He

Everything he sees is constructed with an eye to beauty. At least that is what
used to be the life of the Eskimos; now they are carving pictures of Mutt
and Jeff (who, they think, are the American gods.)"
