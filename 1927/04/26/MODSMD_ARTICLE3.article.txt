# HUMOROUS SITUATIONS LEND SPARKLE TO CLEVER COMEDY, "WICKED WILLIAM"
## Gold-Digging by Two Masculine Posers of Greenwich Village Intelligentsia Forms a Plot for Play 
### John Rogers 
COMEDY, similar to that used in Junior Operas of the "good old days"
before female impersonations were barred from the campus stage, is
plentiful in "Wicked William," the current Junior Opera which will be
produced Saturday night, May 7. The lines and songs of the musical comedy
are broad in their humor, and abound in gags that put Chaparral to shame.
The comedy does not rely on a subtle play 011 words, but in situations that
in themselves are intensely humorous.
The two bogus counts, Benito Anchova and Ivan Pusliov, are the characters
around whom the comic situations develop with increasing speed. They,

accompanied by their playmate, Adele,
of their lines and their antics, and

draw most of the humor, both because
-'they furnish some of the freshest
• comedy that has ever been used in a
Stanford production.
Hal Boomer plays the part of An
chova, formerly of the New York gut
ters, but recently of the Greenwich
Village intelligentzia. Boomer is a
dramatic find of last year, appearing
first in the "Football Show" and hav
ing the comedy lead in "Meet the
Wife." He has further achieved every
comedian's ambition by playing the
part of Hamlet, when it was given in
modern dress last year. K. Lloyd, who
takes the role of Pushov, Anchova's
fellow literatus, recently made his ap
pearance on the campus stage as the
King in "A Kiss for Cinderella."
Duryea's First Role
The counts' companion artiste,
Adele, is played by Helena Duryea,
who was chosen for the part after
great competition. This is Miss Dur
yea's initial appearance in Stanford
dramatics.
Ancliova and Pushov are the leaders
of a Greenwich Village cult of aes
thetes, to which position they have
risen from occupations in and around
the sewers of New York. In their
present elevated condition they let it
j he known that they are from the cul
, tured land of "Roussia."
Gold-Digger Missing
They discover that Isabelle Potter,
i "wicked" William's wife, is a veritable
gold mine—for once here is a play in
which a girl is not the gold-digger—■
and the two constantly-broke and in
separable poseurs sponge off Mrs.
J Potter at her husband's expense.
Pushov is the guardian spirit of the
duo, and often he finds it difficult to
smooth over and hide Anchova's bril
linnt faux pas, that the latter manages
to make practically every time he
; opens his mouth.
The culmination of the phenomenal
rise of the pseudo-continental and
shabbily-dressed counts ends in their
appointment to positions in the Holly
wood motion picture studio of Bulwar
Buchowitz, temperamental director of
the super-classic-jewel, "Women I
i Have Known."
Comedy Sustained
Throughout the play, these comedy
I parts are well sustained and devel
j oped, and are not afflicted with the
customary let-downs that hamper so
many amateur productions. Pushov
! and Anchova are perfect foils for each
other and for the other characters of
i
' the musical comedy, and are the main
j factors that keep the action always at
I a high comedy pitch.
j Tickets for "Wicked William" will
! be placed on sale at $1 and $1.25 to
morrow at 1 o'clock in the Old Union.

Ancliova and Pushov are the leaders
of a Greenwich Village cult of aes
thetes, to which position they have
risen from occupations in and around
the sewers of New York. In their
present elevated condition they let it
j he known that they are from the cul

Gold-Digger Missing
They discover that Isabelle Potter,
i "wicked" William's wife, is a veritable
gold mine—for once here is a play in
which a girl is not the gold-digger—■
and the two constantly-broke and in
separable poseurs sponge off Mrs.
J Potter at her husband's expense.
Pushov is the guardian spirit of the
duo, and often he finds it difficult to
smooth over and hide Anchova's bril
linnt faux pas, that the latter manages
to make practically every time he
; opens his mouth.
The culmination of the phenomenal
rise of the pseudo-continental and
shabbily-dressed counts ends in their
appointment to positions in the Holly
wood motion picture studio of Bulwar
Buchowitz, temperamental director of
the super-classic-jewel, "Women I
i Have Known."
Comedy Sustained
Throughout the play, these comedy
I parts are well sustained and devel
j oped, and are not afflicted with the
customary let-downs that hamper so
many amateur productions. Pushov
! and Anchova are perfect foils for each
other and for the other characters of
i
' the musical comedy, and are the main
j factors that keep the action always at
I a high comedy pitch.
j Tickets for "Wicked William" will

COMEDY, similar to that used in Junior Operas of the "good old days"
before female impersonations were barred from the campus stage, is
plentiful in "Wicked William," the current Junior Opera which will be
produced Saturday night, May 7. The lines and songs of the musical comedy
are broad in their humor, and abound in gags that put Chaparral to shame.
The comedy does not rely on a subtle play 011 words, but in situations that
in themselves are intensely humorous.
The two bogus counts, Benito Anchova and Ivan Pusliov, are the characters
around whom the comic situations develop with increasing speed. They,

accompanied by their playmate, Adele,
of their lines and their antics, and

draw most of the humor, both because
-'they furnish some of the freshest
• comedy that has ever been used in a
Stanford production.
Hal Boomer plays the part of An
chova, formerly of the New York gut
ters, but recently of the Greenwich
Village intelligentzia. Boomer is a
dramatic find of last year, appearing
first in the "Football Show" and hav
ing the comedy lead in "Meet the
Wife." He has further achieved every
comedian's ambition by playing the
part of Hamlet, when it was given in
modern dress last year. K. Lloyd, who
takes the role of Pushov, Anchova's
fellow literatus, recently made his ap
pearance on the campus stage as the
King in "A Kiss for Cinderella."
Duryea's First Role
The counts' companion artiste,
Adele, is played by Helena Duryea,
who was chosen for the part after
great competition. This is Miss Dur
yea's initial appearance in Stanford
dramatics.
