The Editor, Sir:
The Rally Committee is very in
genious. The "crew race" staged on
Lasuen was the masterpiece of a crea
tive genius. It seems that that piece
of hokum was the culmination of the j
Committee's efforts to revive crew as j
a collegiate sport here at Stanford.
Two weeks ago on April 11, the
Daily published an article which set
forth as a statement of fact that a ;
former Stanford alumnus had ap
peared before the Rally Committee to j
issue an appeal for the return of crew. |
The article quoted the words of the j
alumnus. It was very thrilling. Being ,
but one of the gullible public who be
lieve what they read in the news
papers, I forgot to look for the "nigger
in the woodpile" and believed what i
the article said. I wasted a half hour I
and a two-cent stamp writing an arti-'
cle for this column on the subject of j
the revival of crew.
It seems that the "former Stanford j

alumnus" was a second "B6om"
Drumni. Being a Stanford person 1 !
should have read between the lines
and discovered the real significance of |
the article. The true import of said
article was more hidden than it was j
in the ballyhoo over Harvey L.
Drumm; hence it was beyond my mea
ger powers to see through it all.
I should like to ask the Daily a
question: Did a Stanford alumnus api
pear before the Rally Committee in
an attempt to revive collegiate crew,
and if he did not may I inquire why
this paper published such a statement
as a representation of fact? If such j
person did appeal to the committee
for the aforementioned purpose and t
if in fact the article was bona fide
believed by the publishers to be true,
I offer my sincere apologies to the
Daily for presuming to doubt its vera
city, and present my hearty congratu
lations to the Rally Committee for
its successful revival of "crew."
