"It is the great experiment, and I
am proud to see Stanford make it," j
declared Dr. Rufus B. von KleinSmid,
president of the University of South-
California, when questioned 011
his opinion concerning the abolition
I of the lower division at Stanford.
"The Junior College as an institu-
I tion is here to stay," the educator con-
Itinued. 'it is only right, with state
i supported junior colleges, that the tax
' payers should not be required to bear
I a double burden in providing four-
I year university courses. This step, to
ward which education has been logi
cally progressing, is inevitable, and
the stronger schools should lead J.he
way in taking, it."
Will Encourage Graduates
"One obvious advantage in the sepa
ration of the junior and senior divi
sions is the encouragement it will give
to graduate work. When the pre-medic
thinks of his course as six years
rather than eight, and the law student
as four or five, the effort will not ap
pear so great; the same will hold true
in every field," said the Southern Cali
fornia president. "Graduate work will
become the natural and logical step,
as will the correlating of lower divi-1
sion and secondary schools.
"Another advantage will come from
these qualities of leadership and indi
vidual ability which competition with
the upperclassmen tends to retard or
discourage. "Students will enter the
senior colleges better trained, know
ing more surely what are their capa
bilities."
Problenp of Today
The vital problem in present day
education, that of meeting adequately
the growing demand for higher educa
tion, can be met in no other way than
through the junior college, thinks von
KleinSmid.

I
"The fine line between S4 and S5 is
as imaginary as the equator, and when
selection has to be made on such a
basis as this the problem is a serious
one. The junior college will make
higher education possible to a large
number. Another thing it will do, is !
to take care of those students who
come to college largely as a social
obligation. The two-year course will
give them ample opportunity to fulfill
all such, and if they go on it will be ,
because of a serious purpose."
No Social Change
Social life the president does not
believe will be materially altered, nor
does he think fraternities will neces
sarily be abolished in the senior col
lege. "The instinct to form groups is
natural to us all, and the campus fra
ternal organizations will continue to
serve the function the clubs provide
in outside life," asserted the educator.
"Selection will undoubtedly become
more intelligent and seasoned, and the
idea of a fraternity as a social instru
ment not such a prominent one. They
will change very little, however, and I
do not think they will go."
