# DR. BLACK DISCUSSES ADVENTURE OF FAITH IN MEMORIAL SERIES
## Lecturer Discovers Evidence Of Religious Belief in Present-Day Life 
### 
"Faith is a venture which the mind
of man makes on the world for knowl
edge, and which the soul of man
makes upon God for human life."
Variously defining faith and finding
evidences of it in our social, scientific,
and moral worlds, Dr. Hugh Black
last night opened the West Memorial
Lecture series with the first talk of
his general subject, "The Adventure
of Being Men." On Wednesday night
he will speak about the Adventurer
and on Friday will conclude his series
with a discussion of the Last Adven
ture, giving, as he said last night, "my
point of view on what is the funda
mental in religion.
World Big as Man
"Being men is itself an adventure,"
Dr. Black began with his decided
Scotch accent. "The world of man is
just as big as man is big enough to
inhabit it, and when we go to find ad
venture we find ourselves."
He stressed the fundamental im
portance of faith and its essential
broadness as a foundation, tracing its
presence through religion and science.
In regard to the latter, he said, "The
scientist takes a great deal for
granted; the real scientific man says
we have., only partial knowledge. He
assumes the coherence of the world
and the rationality of mind, then he
gaily throws out a hypothesis. There
never was a hypothesis yet that cov
ered all the ground—not even in sci
ence can we infallibly demonstrate
the truth of anything.
Believes in History
"I am not afraid," he concluded. "I
believe in history; I see a track of
light which gives unity to the past,
and then I see a track of light where
God shall be. I would venture all upon
that risk.
