# GRADUATION DEPLETES LIST OF STAR BEAR TRACK PERFORMERS
## Three First, Seven Second Place Winners in Big Meet Are Seniors 
### 
That graduation is bound to hurt
California's prospects for a winning
track squad next spring is evident
from the number of place-men who
will not be available for next year's
varsity.
The results of the Big Meet showed
that California took three first places,
seven seconds, three thirds, and a
three-cornered tie for a third. Of
these, all tiiree of the first places were
taken by graduating seniors, four of
the seconds, and one of the thirds. In
other words, next year's team will
have as a nucleus no first place men,
two second place men (since two of
the seconds were taken by the same
man), and three third place men left
over from the Bear squad which met
Stanford.
Boyden Graduates
The graduating seniors are Elmer
Boyden, Albert Stevens, A1 Ragan, Les
Sc-hwobeda, Elmer Gerkin, Oathter
Hampton, and "Nibs" Hill. Those re
maining of the point winners are Cap
tain "Lank" Talbot, who took second
in the quarter mile; Russ Ewing, who
took two seconds in the sprints; Ho
mer Van Gelder, who took third in the
220-yard dash; Irvine Phillips, who
took third in the discus; and Frank
Fitz, who tied for third in the high
jump.
Freshmen Promising
Californians are consoling them
selves with the showing of their fresh
man squad when they held the Stan
ford babes to within a few points of a
tie score last week. Of the four rec
ords broken, however, and the one tied
in the meet, all were by Stanford men.
Various remedies for the situation
have been offered on the Berkeley
campus, among them the suggestion
that all able-bodied men on the cam
pus bo tried out on the track even if
they have never done anything there
before, and that more football men
turn out for this form of spring ath
letics.
