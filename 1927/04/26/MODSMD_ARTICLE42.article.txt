## 
### 
"College men quickly lose any per
sonal desire to engage in stage work
after graduation, however interested
they may have been in amateur pro
ductions during their university life,"
said John Drew, famous stage star, to
a Daily Princetonian reporter. "From
my own* observation I would say that
such an education might be a great
aid to making a success in dramatics.
All the culture one can attain is neces
sary in artistic development.
"Eighteen, the age when most boys
go to college," explained Mr. Drew,
"is the age when a prospective actor
should begin his stage work. As a pro
fession the drama is long, tedious, and
discouraging, with remuneration far
below that of other professions. If a
person is unwilling to endure these
trials, jie had better follow the tradi
tional college method and enter his
father's business, presumably at the
bottom."
