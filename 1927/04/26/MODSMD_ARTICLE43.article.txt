# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The gentleman shown above, in the
act of solemnly contemplating a page
from his past, is George Sisler, who,
as all the world that follows baseball
knows, fell into a terrible slump last
year and was accompanied down by
the team which he could not manage,
the St. Louis Browns. Poor George,
due to worry over the standing of his
club, and his inability to be a hard
boiled manager, slipped in his batting
form from .345 to .289, while his team
dropped from third place in 1925 to
seventh in 1926.
There is no doubt in any one's mind
about the fact that the George Sisler
of 1927 is a vastly changed player
from the Sisler of a year ago. Gone is
the tired look around his eyes, the
tell-tale wrinkles in his forehead, the
haggard, worried expression that made
his friends exclaim so often last sea
son, "George, you look ten years
older!"
It is hoped, but it is a rather forlorn
hope, that the Sisler of 1922 will come
back again to startle the fans with his
marvelous fielding, send them into
ecstasies over his timely batting, and
bring them to their feet with his speed
and daring on the base-paths. The
records that Sisler set in 1922, when
he easily won the American League
reward as its most valuable player,
have been equaled or bettered by very
few modern players.

| .00017 points less than Sisler in 1922,
but scored thirteen more runs, made
more hits, and stole thirty-two more
bases. Tris Speaker's best all-round
season was in 1912, when he tallied
136 times, made 222 hits, stole fifty
two bases, and batted .353. In Ruth's
1 greatest year, 1921, his record shows
177 runs, 204 hits, seventeen stolen
. bases, and an average of .378. Hornsby
topped Sisler's batting average in 1924,
when he hit .424, but his other marks
were well below his rival from the
Mound City. In 1922, Sisler's great
year, Hornsby scored seven more runs,
and made four more hits, but stole
only a third as many bases and batted
nineteen points less.
I, for one, will get a tremendous kick
out of it if the graceful, hard-hitting
University of Michigan graduate at-
J tains once more the form he flashed
five years ago.

knows, fell into a terrible slump last
year and was accompanied down by
the team which he could not manage,
the St. Louis Browns. Poor George,
due to worry over the standing of his
club, and his inability to be a hard
boiled manager, slipped in his batting
form from .345 to .289, while his team
dropped from third place in 1925 to
seventh in 1926.
There is no doubt in any one's mind
about the fact that the George Sisler
of 1927 is a vastly changed player
from the Sisler of a year ago. Gone is
the tired look around his eyes, the
tell-tale wrinkles in his forehead, the
haggard, worried expression that made
his friends exclaim so often last sea
son, "George, you look ten years
older!"
It is hoped, but it is a rather forlorn
hope, that the Sisler of 1922 will come
back again to startle the fans with his
marvelous fielding, send them into
ecstasies over his timely batting, and
bring them to their feet with his speed
and daring on the base-paths. The
records that Sisler set in 1922, when
he easily won the American League
reward as its most valuable player,
have been equaled or bettered by very
few modern players.

| .00017 points less than Sisler in 1922,
but scored thirteen more runs, made
more hits, and stole thirty-two more
bases. Tris Speaker's best all-round
season was in 1912, when he tallied
136 times, made 222 hits, stole fifty
two bases, and batted .353. In Ruth's
1 greatest year, 1921, his record shows
177 runs, 204 hits, seventeen stolen
. bases, and an average of .378. Hornsby
topped Sisler's batting average in 1924,
when he hit .424, but his other marks
were well below his rival from the
Mound City. In 1922, Sisler's great
year, Hornsby scored seven more runs,
and made four more hits, but stole
only a third as many bases and batted
nineteen points less.
I, for one, will get a tremendous kick
out of it if the graceful, hard-hitting
University of Michigan graduate at-
J tains once more the form he flashed
five years ago.
