# WESLEYAN STUDENTS ADD WAR COURSE TO CURRICULUM BY VOTE
## 
### 
A course In "War: Its Causes and
Cure," has been favorably voted for
by students of Wesleyan University.
The reasons for introducing such a
course into any college curriculum are
to be found in the presont interna
tional situation and America's position
of isolation. Recent developments of
ncienoe have made the possibility of
another war the nightmare of the hu
man race. If proper attitudes based on
a knowledge of essential facts are not
established, America may be plunged
into conflict with her debtors.
"The purpose of such a course," say
the students asking for it, "would be
to give a background < ? facts on the
subject of war as a method of
tling international disputes, so that
educated men would be capable of rec
ognizing the various factors making
for conflict when they appear on the
horizon of current events, and could
more confidently take steps to elimi
nate them.
