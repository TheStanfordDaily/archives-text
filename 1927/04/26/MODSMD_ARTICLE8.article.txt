# JUNIOR PROM TICKETS WILL SELL FOR LAST TIME TODAY AT UNION
## 
### 
Tickets for the Junior Prom will be
on sale for the last time from 1 to 3
o'clock this afternoon in the lobby of
the Old Union. Although it was
planned to sell them tomorrow as
well, the great number sold yesterday
precludes the possibility of their last
ing that long. Only a few of the 300
remain unsold.
Bids will be sold only to juniors,
seniors, and graduates. Juniors must
pay their class dues before they will
be allowed to purchase the paste
boards.
