Where dependability Is vital
IN connection with a new pumping station at Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, additional feeder mains were required. It was
necessary that one of these should carry an unusually large
proportion of the water supply, and 54-inch pipe was decided
upon. Although pipe ot material other than cast iron had a
lower first cost, Cast Iron Pipe was chosen bccause the possibil
ity of interruption to service had to be reduced to a minimum.
The photograph above shows a section of pipe being lowered
into the ditch in the process of laying it.
