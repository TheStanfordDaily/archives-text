" One gallon, Dad, and lift anchor. We gotta make Newport by dark."
"Only one?"
"Sure! Wbered'ya think we're goin'—Shanghai? Read the nameplate—it's an
Erskine Coupe!"
FINALS (ugh)... then Commencement (ah)... and sum
mer just ahead! Vacation days...soaking up sunshine
at the beach . . . evenings spent with that chic blonde you
met at the homecoming game ... a smart car ... your own
personal car—an Erskine Six Custom Coupe.
Undergraduate America's new car—the Erskine Six —
miles out in front of the res»t. Dietrich, without a peer
among custom body carrossiers, designed it; moulded its
lines, endowed it with Continental sophistication. Trim
as a silken ankle... inside; room no end for two... rumble
seat behind built just for a double date. High hat in every
thing but price.
And can it do its stuff? Yes, sir, and how... slips through
jumbled traffic with the ease of an inspired eel. . . hangs
onto the road at sixty like a co-ed at her first prom ...
climbs up a ski slide in high... handles, wheels around
and pulls up like a polo pony.
Summer is beckoning —so is "The Little Aristocrat" —
a real companion for vacation days.
The L'.rskine Six Custom Coupe, as illustrated, sells
for $995 /. o. b. factory, complete uith front and
rear bumpers and self-energizing q-wbeel brakes.
