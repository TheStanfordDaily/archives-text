# FIGHTERS WAGE NOVICE BOXING PRELIMINARIES
## Finals of Tourney Scheduled For Tomorrow Night In Pavilion STROMQUIST, HILL WIN Harold Defeats Milligan in Best of Afternoon's Three Bouts 
### Robert Speers 
Three preliminary bouts, staged yes
terday afternoon in Encina Gym, fired
the opening gun of the University box
ing championships which are to be
held tomorrow night. All the fights
were in the middleweight class.
The Harold-Mllligan haymaking duel
was the feature of the afternoon's
menu. Harold won, hut only after an
extra round of wild swings and furi
ous footwork. The quality of boxing
displayed may not have been the best,
but there was nothing wrong with the
quality of spirit displayed by the
battlers.
Stroinquist outpointed his opponent,
Prather, by a comfortable margin in a
fight that contained only spots of ac
tion. Prather had a fairly strong finish,
but didn't seem able to reach Stroin
quist.
Haymakers were the outstanding
points of the Hill-Simatovich bout
which Hill managed to get under his
belt. The two boys floundered through
their three rounds, doing little except
land blows o nthe nose. The final re
sult was not a pleasant sight to see.
Thursday night finals will be held
in the Basketball Pavilion at 7:30
o'clock. Twenty-three men have en
tered these and some real exhibitions
of fisticuffs are promised. The men
will weigh in at the gymnasium at
32:45 o'clock.
As a special added feature the Uni
versity fencing championships will be
held at the same place and at the
same time. The Stanford fencers have
completed a long, hard season, and are
in good shape for the meet.
