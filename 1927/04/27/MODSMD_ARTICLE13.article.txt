The elimination of the lower divi

that will be held -this evening in the
lobby of the Old Union at 7:45 o'clock.
Dr. Wilbur will be present to give an
opening discussion of the subject and
will answer all questions concerning
it.
Stanford is taking the lead in this
new system of university education
and there is the possibility that other
institutions will follow Stanford's
example. Articles have appeared in
various publications concerning the
change, but the meeting this evening
will be the first wherein students will
have an opportunity to express theirs.
All the curriculum and extra-curricu
lum activities will be affected by this
change. The open forum discussion
will give the student reaction to these
changes. The meeting is open to the
public.
