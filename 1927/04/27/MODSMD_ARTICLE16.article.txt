# LECTURER PICTURES JOHNSON'S CAREER, CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
## Ellsworth Describes Spirit, Customs of Eighteenth Century England 
### Maxine Cushing 
Proving conclusively that "we know
his personality rather than his books"
by detailing accounts of Johnson's life
and character, William Webster Ells
worth last evening delivered an illus
trated lecture on "Doctor Johnson and
His Circle." He succeeded in giving a
graphic picture of eighteenth century
England and of the men and women
who figured most prominently during
those times.
Johnson he described as "limbering,
large, sloyenly, with a twitching of
arms and legs that fascinated many; a
tremendous eater. He never overcame
his misfortunes —he rose above them.
He read much and never forgot what
he read —he had a tenacious memory
and hoarded knowledge, which result
ed in the verbal facility that made him
supreme in talk. No one ever dis
puted his leadership. Today the man
most like him is Gilbert Chesterton,
in England."
Johnson Read Much
Johnson was irregular in his college
reading, the lecturer said. He found a
religion for himself among his books,
and liked Horace's Odes best, though
on his introduction to Shakespeare
he was "terrified by Hamlet's ghost."
While at Pembroke College, where his
room has been kept sacred, his one
enjoyment was the exercise of his
mind; often he obtained lectures sec
ond hand because unable to afford
them otherwise. He left without a
degree after three years there; later
Oxford "honored itself by presenting
him with the degree of LL.D."
"His dictionary," said Ellsworth,
"was strange. Johnson's personality
dominated it. For instance, his defini
tion of a fishing pole was 'a stick with
a fool on one end and a worm on the
other.' There were twelve dictionaries
before Johnson's, but his was the first
to contain quotations and to be in
teresting.
"Johnson was fond of Boswell," he
continued. "His biography gives the
reader a lasting impression of the
man's greatness, and one who lias not
read it has missed a treat." The two
were friends for twenty years, he ex
plained ; when Boswell was twenty
three the other was sixty-four. They
were actually in each other's company
only two years, during which time
Boswell made his famous observations.
He did not write in shorthand but in
scribed his records at the first con
venient interval.
Johnson's circle was composed of
many prominent figures. David Gar
rick was there, one of the most lov
able. He came to London with John
son, and they were buried side by side
in Westminster Abbey after a long
life together. Edmund Burke, the fa
mous politician; Boswell, the biogra
pher; Oliver Goldsmith, the happy-go
lucky author of "She Stoops to Con
quer" and"The Vicar of Wakefield";
Hogarth and Reynolds, the famous
painters—all formed (he nucleus of a
group which always gave to Johnson
its undisputed leadership.

large, sloyenly, with a twitching of
arms and legs that fascinated many; a
tremendous eater. He never overcame
his misfortunes —he rose above them.
He read much and never forgot what
he read —he had a tenacious memory
and hoarded knowledge, which result
ed in the verbal facility that made him
supreme in talk. No one ever dis
puted his leadership. Today the man
most like him is Gilbert Chesterton,
in England."
Johnson Read Much
Johnson was irregular in his college
reading, the lecturer said. He found a
religion for himself among his books,
and liked Horace's Odes best, though
on his introduction to Shakespeare
he was "terrified by Hamlet's ghost."
While at Pembroke College, where his
room has been kept sacred, his one
enjoyment was the exercise of his
mind; often he obtained lectures sec
ond hand because unable to afford
them otherwise. He left without a
degree after three years there; later
Oxford "honored itself by presenting
him with the degree of LL.D."
"His dictionary," said Ellsworth,
"was strange. Johnson's personality
dominated it. For instance, his defini
tion of a fishing pole was 'a stick with
a fool on one end and a worm on the
other.' There were twelve dictionaries
before Johnson's, but his was the first
to contain quotations and to be in
teresting.
"Johnson was fond of Boswell," he
continued. "His biography gives the
reader a lasting impression of the
man's greatness, and one who lias not
read it has missed a treat." The two
were friends for twenty years, he ex
plained ; when Boswell was twenty
three the other was sixty-four. They
were actually in each other's company
only two years, during which time
Boswell made his famous observations.
He did not write in shorthand but in
scribed his records at the first con
venient interval.
Johnson's circle was composed of
many prominent figures. David Gar
rick was there, one of the most lov
able. He came to London with John
son, and they were buried side by side
in Westminster Abbey after a long
life together. Edmund Burke, the fa
mous politician; Boswell, the biogra
pher; Oliver Goldsmith, the happy-go
lucky author of "She Stoops to Con
quer" and"The Vicar of Wakefield";
Hogarth and Reynolds, the famous
painters—all formed (he nucleus of a
group which always gave to Johnson
its undisputed leadership.
Proving conclusively that "we know
his personality rather than his books"
by detailing accounts of Johnson's life
and character, William Webster Ells
worth last evening delivered an illus
trated lecture on "Doctor Johnson and
His Circle." He succeeded in giving a
graphic picture of eighteenth century
England and of the men and women
who figured most prominently during
those times.
Johnson he described as "limbering,
large, sloyenly, with a twitching of
arms and legs that fascinated many; a
tremendous eater. He never overcame
his misfortunes —he rose above them.

he read —he had a tenacious memory
