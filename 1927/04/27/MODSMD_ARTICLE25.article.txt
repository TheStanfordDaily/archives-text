# Palmer on Junior Colleges
## 
### 
George Herbert Palmer, professor-emeritus of philosophy at Harvard
University, sees the junior College idea as the very antithesis of the best
element in American educational ideals. According to Professor Palmer,
the one good element which has characterized American education as dis
tinct from European education is its ability to send out into the business
world men who, although their chief interest is business, nevertheless
have been in contact with the cultural side of life and consequently arc
prepared to pass on the cultural spirit to the communities in which
they live.
Professor Palmer evidently thinks that junior colleges are not capable
of supplying the student with the culture that the universities now pro
vide. It is perfectly reasonable to believe that high school graduates could
be given the opportunity for a broad education at a junior college in the
same way that they are given that opportunity in the lower division at
universities today. Then universities would be reserved for those inter
ested in professional studies. Universities would be a place of higher
learning, and not a high school annex.
Professor Palmer wants the old-fashioned type of education that was
applied to him when he was a student. At that time men with A.B.
degrees were the leaders in the communities. But today it is not the
graduates that have completed a four-year course that are leading the
world, but rather the students who have applied themselves for a great
many more years.
Unless the Junior College idea is checked the average student in the
future will go directly from school to business, and the glorious peculi
arity of American education will disappear, according to Professor
Palmer. But how this conclusion is drawn is hard to ascertain, for it
would appear that under the Junior College plan even a greater number
of students would receive an additional two years of study than secure
this additional education today. Certainly all the students who enter
college now, will in the future go to junior colleges for two years, and
besides there will undoubtedly be others enrolling in such institutions
who would not have been able to attend universities because of financial
and other reasons. Those who showed themselves capable of higher
learning after two years of junior college would then go on up to uni
versities. And the students at universities would tend to be a more
serious lot of young gentlemen than they are now.
