# More Recognition for Stanford
## 
### 
Three Stanford tennis players left today to represent their University
at the Ojai tournament. Captain Holman was not able to make the trip,
but Ogden, McElvenny, and Herrington will play for the University this
week-end. McElvenny and Herrington will enter the intercollegiate
singles and doubles, and Ogden will play in the open singles and will pair
with Neer, a Stanford graduate, in the open doubles.
With victories over all comers this season, the Stanford varsity is
entering the college closed event the favorite, but Stanford is handicapped
by the absence of its captain. Holman is undoubtedly the best college
player in the United States, and his recent victory over Tildeu gives him
prestige in national circles. Ogden also has national recognition, and Mc-
Elvenny and Herrington are just coming up and will he heard about later.
