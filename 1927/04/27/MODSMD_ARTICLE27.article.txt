The Stanford Class of 1917 had hopes of presenting a short history
of their organization at a Los Angeles meeting recently until their plans
were shattered by telegraphic word from the Stanford campus to the
effect that female impersonation in dramatics has been barred at Stanford.
The skit prepared by Herbert S. Marshutz, '17, was to depict the
changing collcgc woman â€”types from the year 1913 through the present
era to the gay and glorious future in 1937. No female talent being avail
able among the alumni of the class, a Stanford student offered the assist
ance of 1 hammer and Coffin's vast body of female impersonators.
Plans to present the sketch with their assistance were progressing
when Marshutz and Swigart, who were arranging the entertainment, re
ceived a wire from the certain student who offered the assistance, stating
that he had forgotten President Wilbur's anti-impersonation ruling.
The ruling does not apply to alumni so perhaps the Class of '17 can
secure some old grad to portray the part of the present-day smoking
co-ed.
