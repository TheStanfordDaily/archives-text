## "HARK HOW THE BLEACHERS CHEER" 
### 
While the athlctic authorities of the ;
University have taken no action on
the matter'," ji jtf evident that last Sat
urday's little HftHjj* with the so-called
Trojan varsity has left a very un
pleasant impression with Stanford stu
dents, In the past there has been a 1
marked tendency to distort the fact*
in discussions involving brewchfes of
athltllc etiquette: For the sake of
clarifying the issue, it might be well
to review a few features of the meet
that seem to bear directly upon the
controversy opened Monday in the edi
torial column of the Daily.
It will be remembered that the Stan
ford rooters booed Hussey when he
elbowed McKinnon to the middle of
the track. They gave him as thorough
and' sincere a ragging as a man has
been given on this campus for a long
while. It is unfortunate that they
could not have managed to vent their
ire upon his coach, Dean Cromwell.
The absence of this gentleman at such
a critical moment, coupled with the
traditional exclusion of soda pop ven
dors from the stadium probably ac
counts for the failure of the rooting
section to commit a homicide that at
the time would have been entirely
justifiable.
It will also be remembered that the
rooting section showed every evidence
of giving deserving rival athletes their
just share of applause. Hill's record
breaking broad jump rated a big cheer
from Stanford. The courage of the

diminutive U.S.C. two-miler, who stuck
to his race after being hopelessly out
classed by three or four competitors
called out a roar of encouragement.
The point in mentioning all of this
is to impress upon the public mind the i
fact that the antagonism of the stu
dent body Saturday was originally di
rected against certain men, not—as
will undoubtedly be claimed in certajr. ■
quarters — because they represented
the University of Southern California,
but because they represented an ex
tremely unsportsmanlike attitude.
The indictment made editorially
later on against the entire southern j
university and all of its athletic de
partments was based upon the state
ment that spirit of an inferior sort
lias been demonstrated by U.S.C. on
previous occasions in the past. That
statement was quite true.
On previous occasions, however, the
objectionable actions have occurred in
the heat of contest, and in sports —
such as football and basketball —where
close personal contact demanded by
the nature of the play often leads men
to lose their tempers. Saturday, how
ever, the impression was given that
U.S.C. athletes had been coached to
do ungentlemanly things. It is no won
der that there has been an editorial
demand for a break in relations. There
is nothing to be gained by athletic
competition with another institution
so long as repeated infractions of the
gentlemanly code produce the impres
sion that the athletic policies of that
institution are dictated by bounders.
