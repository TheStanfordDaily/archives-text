Whether history can at the same
time be made a living thing and a
record of days tlmt are dead, may still
he a doubtful question in the mind of j
Mr. Dryasdust, but the following four
volumes of living history should go
far to prove to the lay reader that|
such a thing is possible. Experts may
question the facts presented, but it
will be a dull reader who can find
these books dull.
I am speaking of "Europe Since i
Waterloo," by William Stearns Davis,
published by Century; "The American
People," by Thomas Jefferson Werten
baker, published by Scribner's; "The
People Next Door," by George Creel, ;
published by John Day; "Miniatures
of French History," by Hilaire Belloc,
published by Harpers.
They embody, largely, the modern
method of erecting great human fig
ures on the stage of their- endeavor
and allowing them to speak for them
selves. They dramatize the relations
of men and movements, and thus j
carry the conviction that men of flesh
and blood made history. They make i
the dead past a faded metaphor.
It has taken much searching of
musty records and documents by mod- i
ern scholars to make this possible, j
The "human interest" in history often ,
moulders in forgotten cabinets and
dusty archives. Records of the com
mon humanity that binds great men
to their fellows often escapes the eyes
of generations—yet the element of I
common humanity, if discovered, is
what makes grist for the mill of the j
modern historian.

Popular approval does not usually !
mean that an author has reached the
dignity of a classic, but the seal of I
public favor has undoubtedly stamped
John Galsworthy's reputation with
permanence. It came only after many
years of writing for the select and cul
tured, but the large sales of such re

cent books as "The White Monkey" ;
: and"The Silver Spoon" show that the i
people have taken him up.
| If the critics establish you, that usu-j
ally means that you have a special
gift; but if the people accept you, that
! means that you have a universal ap
peal. If you are inclined to scoff at
the popular taste, just consider this
and remove your highbrow laurel
wreath. There isn't a novelist or a
j poet living who wouldn't give the
house over his head for a public
, clamor —not so much because it means
fame and fortune a-s because it proves
he has something to say which the
world wishes to hear. If you think
that is easy just try it on a do~en of
your closest friends.
All his is by way of announcing that
the progressive House of Scribners is
now issuing an eighteen-volume set of
Galsworthy in convenient pocket-size
at $1.25 per volume. —E.L.S.
