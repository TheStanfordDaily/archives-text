# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"While it is quite true that many
people will he attracted to the Penn
relays at Franklin Field, Philadelphia,
next Friday and Saturday to see the
timber-topping activities of Lord David
Burghley, of Cambridge University,
England, yet 1 venture to state that
just as many will journey to the City
of Brotherly Love to take a peek at
Roland Locke, of (lie University of
Nebraska. Roland Locke, holder of
the American record of 20V> seconds
for the 220-yard dash, is to compete
in two special sprint races at 100 and
220 yards with "Hank" Russell, for
merly of Cornell University, Eastern
intercollegiate outdoor sprint cham
pion for 1026, and Jackson Scholz,
Olympic '200-meter champion and win- j
ner of countless indoor and outdoor
championships. j
Locke made his record on May 1,
1026, at Lincoln, Nebraska, running
on a slightly curved track. He later i
ran the furlong in the Missouri Valley |
Conference meet in 20.7, which also
broke the accepted world's record of
20.S held by Charley Paddock. Twice 1
he ran ICO yards in !) 3-sths and once
in 9.5, although this last time was not
accepted, while Paddock's 9.5 was.
When Locke ran his "century" in bet
ter than world's record time, he
splashed through a muddy track, hut
was aided by a strong wind. As Russell
has run the 220 in 21 flat, and the 100
in 9.7, and Scholz is unofficially cred
ited with the shorter distance in 9.5
and holds the Olympic record for 200
meters, the races between these three
performers should be worth going
miles to see.
Locke has no intercollegiate compe
tition this year, as he finished his last
year of varsity competition in 1926, |

and has been taking a fifth year to
complete his law studies. He will be
24 years old on July 30, is 5 feet, 11
inches tall, weighs IGÂ£, pounds, and
plays football and baseball, and can
run a first class low-liurdle race. One
of his legs is a quarter of an inch
shorter than the other, due to a knee
injury sustained in high school.
His name may be Locke, but he sure
has the Key to Sprinting Success!
