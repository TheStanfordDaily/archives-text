sity crews, champions of the Pacific
Coast by virtue of their double victory
over Washington on April 9, will begin
training again on May 9, in prepara
tion for their eastern invasion this
summer. Participation by the Varsity
in the I'oughkeepsie regatta on June
29 has been definitely assured, as the
Associated Students have voted the
necessary funds. If sufficient money
can be raised among alumni, students,
and friends of the university, the Jay
veo boat will also go East to the na
tional races.
