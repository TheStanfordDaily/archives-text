Arcos (default)
Large scores necessitating the early
calling of all games played featured
yesterday's program of intramural
baseball in which Sigma Nu, Chi Psi,
and Phi Delta Theta were winners
and Theta Delta Chi won by default.
The Theta Xi nine bowed to the Sigma
Nu's by a 19-2 score in a five-inning en
counter. Phi Delta Theta had no diffi
culty in routing the Alpha Sigma Phi
team 15 to 0, and Chi Psi downed
Encina 111 in the closest game K the
afternoon, 6 to 4.
Sigma Nu Wins Easily
With Todd on the mound and
Murphy behind the plate, the Sigma
Nu's had little trouble holding the
Theta Xi's. Murphy led the batting
attack of the winners with two three
baggers, one coming while the bases
were loaded. The third inning was the
only one in which the Sigma Nu's
failed to cross the plate, and by the
fifth inning they rolled up such a lead
that the game was called by mutual
consent.
Scoring six runs in the third inning,
the Chi Psi nine took the lead in its
game with Encina 111 and was never
headed. The freshman team tallied
four times in the fourth inning, but
the game was called at the end of
this frame, making the final score G
to 4. Ankele and McCargar formed the
Chi Psi battery, and liavell, Smith, and
McMicking did the heavy work for
Encina.
The Phi Delt-Alpha Sig game de
veloped into a farce and was finally
called when all the Alpha Sig men
had batted once. Five home runs by
David, Long, King, Frazee, and Bryant
added to the Phi Delt total. Frazee's
homer came when the bases were
loaded. Frost and David formed the
Phi Delt battery.
