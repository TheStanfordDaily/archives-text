Demonstrating the gathering
| strength of the leaders in their respec
tive leagues, the winners of the three
intramural baseball games played yes
: terday shut out their opponents, at
; the same time running up imposing
| scores themselves. Two of the games
| on the schedule were won by default.
Beta Theta Pi won from Phi Sigma
i Kappa, 11 to 0; Zeta Psi batted in a
13 to 0 victory; and Kappa Sigma de
j feated Sigma Alpha Epsilon by a like
score. Phi Gamma Delta and Alpha
i Tau Omega were given 7 to 0 wins
1 over the Military Department and En
' cina Basement, respectively on default
| of the latter.
Doug Lewis Stars
Doug Lewis, star pitcher of the
i Betas, found little difficulty in mow-
I ing down the opposing batsmen, and
! keeping his team in the ice for the
: league title. With Lewis on the mound,
1 and most of their hard games already
! easily disposed of, it is expected that
this team will be one of the contenders
' for the finals, the play-offs starting at
1 the end of next week's games.
The same may be said of Zeta Psi,
who with Hanna on the mound, have
evoked grander epics. Consider the
! eighth Psalm—in it we find the mod
ern reaction of 'the littleness of man'
when compared to his universe, and
| we find also his next reaction of great
! ness." Though it is a swift change,
I he explained, that of humility to mas
tery, it is inevitable; "a world without
man's appreciation would be nothing."
Theology he defined as an "attempt
> of the mind of man to understand the
facts and experience of religion. Like
j science, its statements must change
I to conform with contemporary knowl
' edge, and so a new theology cannot
1 alter the facts—it merely calls forth
; new relations."
Basic Faith Needed
In Dr. Black's opinion men are "re
! ligious by nature," even though their
inconstancy, as set forth by "disap
j pointed reformers," may seem to prove
J the opposite. The attitude of these
! critics, he said, who "lift their heads
more in democratic America than in
Europe, sneering at the ideal of de
mocracy," is logical because it comes
from a school of unbelievers. "For a
' democracy a fundamental faith is
necessary," he added.
"Christianity has abolished in prin
j ciple all barriers between men," Dr.
j Black continued, "and this step im
plies an end to war and social injus
! tice. The only final sanction for demo-
J cracy is faith in the worth of a single
j soul." *
