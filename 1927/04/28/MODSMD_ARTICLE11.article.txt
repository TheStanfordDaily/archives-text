# YEARBOOK SCHEDULED TO GO ON PRESS IN LAST WEEK OF MAY
## 
### 
I Work on the 1927 Quad is progress
! ing rapidly, and tlie editorial staff,
| headed by Allan Klauber, expects to
j send the publication to press inside of
1 a month. Second proofs of more than
i half the book have already been re
j ceived from the printers, the last color
, work on the covers is being done, and
the borders and color work of the An
nual are due to be completed by the
j end of this week.
Roy Partridge, a professor at Mills
j College and an etcher of national repu
tation, who is doing the etchings for
the Quad, has agreed to design a fifth
j one, although his original contract
: called for only four. The frontispiece
i is being done by Maurice Logan. The
' drawings of both these artists are of
| campus subjects.
The Ilaza Section staff has promised
j to play no favorites in regard to the
dark secrets its members unearth
! about the different University organi
j zations and prominent people. In fact,
j they claim that it will be an insult of
j the first degree to the group that
! escapes from their scathing wits.
