The first event on the program will
be the cross-lake swim, a little less
than a quarter of a mile in length.

and ends at the boathouse. In l'J25 the
swim was won by Arne Borg, the'fa
mous Swedish swimming star who was
then out here on a tour of the country.
Last year Carl Stevenson took first
honors, and should make a strong bid
for another win this year.
Divers to Perform
This will be followed by a diving
exhibition by the varsity divers, who
will perform on the forty-foot board
at the boathouse.
Canoe races and canoe tilting will
make up the next series of events.
The races will all be doubles and will
be held in heats. In the tilts one man
is armed with a pole to upset the
opposing battlers, while the other is
supposed to paddle the canoe into an
advantageous position.
The final race will be the Swedish
marathon. This last i3 a team race
between the four classes. Fifteen men
compose a team, with each man swim
ming fifty yards.
r>etween the various events, Dclmai
Daves and A1 Cass have agreed to
entertain the crowd with their antics
and stunts which have gained such a
reputation around the campus.
The lake is in excellent condition
for the sports this year as the water
level has been sinking very slowly.
