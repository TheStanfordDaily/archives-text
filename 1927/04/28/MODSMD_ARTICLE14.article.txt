# STANFORD WINS LAST CRIME WAVE DEBATE WITH AUDIENCE VOTE
## 
### 
Stanford won the final crime wave j
debate last night by an audience de-1
c-ision based on the merits of the ques- i
tion. The vote was 1G to 7. The ques- j
tion for debate was, "Resolved, That [
newspaper reporters should be barred
from the courtroom during criminal
trials."
"The affirmative was upheld by rep
resentatives from the California Insti
tute of Technology. A vote taken be
fore the debate found 15 supporting
the negative and 8 the affirmative. One
person was won over to the negative.
Owing to a misunderstanding both
teams came prepared to uphold the
affirmative. As this was not discov
ered until time for the debate to start,
the Stanford team took ten minutes
off to prepare themselves to defend
the negative.
Stanford was represented by Dan T.
Smith and Gordon P. Shallenberger,
and Caltech by Ward D. Foster and
Robert T. Ross. Everett W. Smith,
professor of journalism and director
of publicity at Stanford, presided.
The chief arguments for the affirma
tive were: that constant suggestion of
crime by the newspapers make it seem
like an accepted occurranee; that
judges and jury will not be threatened
! by the public; and that it will make
i juries more unbiased.
i The negative argued freedom of the
| press and the right of the public to
! know what the government is doing.
1 Their main point, however, was that it
i was impractical; that merely keeping
• reporters out of the courts will not
| prohibit newspapers from getting
; news. They will stand outside the
j doors and ask the people coming out
I "who wept, and who had grey hair?"
