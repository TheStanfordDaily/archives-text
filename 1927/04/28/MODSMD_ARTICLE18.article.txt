# MAN RELIGIOUS BY NATURE---DR. BLACK
## Science Leaves Undecided Questions of Worth, Declares Lecturer 
### Maxine Cushing 
"The venture of faith has to be made
here: we may believe the worst of
man and excuse anything base by
calling it 'human nature'; or we may
put emphasis on the moral and spir
itual and say that it's a case of re
version to type, that baseness and be
trayal are not a necessity of human
nature. Both sides are human, but
which is natural?"
Dr. Hugh Black, West Memorial lec
turer, questioned man's moral status
last night in his second talk of the
series, and again found faith
ing all his activities. The theologian's
answer to "What Is Man?" was an
indictment of those who habitually
think man base and an unqualified
sanction of those who have Jesus'
fundamental faith in his essential
worth.
To the field of science he again re
ferred, showing a basic understanding
of its principles. "The greater part of
what we call science is description,"
he said; "the more accurate the de
scription, the greater the science. Evo 4
lution is merely a description of a
process; while determining the ques
tion of man's origin it still leaves un
decided the question of its worth, and
it is this question which calls for a
venture of faith, an intellectual revo
lution.

"Man has always wondered about
himself," he continued. "The relative
position of modern man in the uni
verse is the same as ancient man's,
and though his conception of it was
puny in comparison, ancient man
come through their past two games
with ease. A forfeited .game in the
first of the season will prove the only
obstacle to clear sailing through for a
league championship. The game yes
terday with the strong El Capitan nine
was won in a convincing manner, both
teams playing tight ball with only the
pitching of Hanna outstanding. The
fraternity runs were a result of heavy
hitting which has characterized their
playing to date.
Kappa Sigs Down S.A.E.
Kappa Sigma hit Rowe of S.A.E.
effectively while Willie Wolf kept his
opponents' hits well scattered. S.A.E.,
with very little strength this season,
played with many errors, while the
Kappa Sigmas, hitting strongly, were
decidedly superior.
This game was shoved up from to
day by mutual consent, leaving the
contests on the schedule for this after
noon as follows:
Diamond I —Delta Kappa Epsilon vs.
Alpha Delta Phi.
Diamond II —Junipero Serra vs. Phi
Kappa Psi.
Diamond III —Encina I vs. Branner.

come through their past two games
with ease. A forfeited .game in the
first of the season will prove the only
obstacle to clear sailing through for a
league championship. The game yes
terday with the strong El Capitan nine
was won in a convincing manner, both
teams playing tight ball with only the
pitching of Hanna outstanding. The
fraternity runs were a result of heavy
hitting which has characterized their
playing to date.
Kappa Sigs Down S.A.E.
Kappa Sigma hit Rowe of S.A.E.
effectively while Willie Wolf kept his
opponents' hits well scattered. S.A.E.,
with very little strength this season,
played with many errors, while the
Kappa Sigmas, hitting strongly, were
decidedly superior.
This game was shoved up from to
day by mutual consent, leaving the
contests on the schedule for this after
noon as follows:
Diamond I —Delta Kappa Epsilon vs.
Alpha Delta Phi.
Diamond II —Junipero Serra vs. Phi
Kappa Psi.
Diamond III —Encina I vs. Branner.
"The venture of faith has to be made
here: we may believe the worst of
man and excuse anything base by
calling it 'human nature'; or we may
put emphasis on the moral and spir
itual and say that it's a case of re
version to type, that baseness and be
trayal are not a necessity of human
nature. Both sides are human, but
which is natural?"
Dr. Hugh Black, West Memorial lec
turer, questioned man's moral status
last night in his second talk of the
series, and again found faith
ing all his activities. The theologian's
answer to "What Is Man?" was an
indictment of those who habitually
think man base and an unqualified
sanction of those who have Jesus'
fundamental faith in his essential
worth.
To the field of science he again re
ferred, showing a basic understanding
of its principles. "The greater part of
what we call science is description,"
he said; "the more accurate the de
scription, the greater the science. Evo 4
lution is merely a description of a
process; while determining the ques
tion of man's origin it still leaves un
decided the question of its worth, and
it is this question which calls for a
venture of faith, an intellectual revo
lution.
Man Wonders
"Man has always wondered about
himself," he continued. "The relative
position of modern man in the uni
verse is the same as ancient man's,
and though his conception of it was
puny in comparison, ancient man
