In today's Campus Opinion column is reprinted a letter received from
an indignant Stanford alumnus. It is worth reading, but hardly worth
criticizing, for the reasoning in it is so obviously poor, and it is quite
evident that the writer of the letter was not able to attend the recent
track meet with U.S.C. and so did not even know what the editorial
remarks concerning the mile and the quarter-mile, referred to, were
about. If M. Kuzell is a true sportsman, and we have no reason to believe
he is not, he would have been as "hot-headed as the Stanford rooters
were at the crude running of the Southern visitors.
The Southern alumni should be given the chance to see Stanford com
pete without traveling some four hundred miles for the privilege, but if
U.S.C. cannot offer the right type of competition, the only thing left for
the graduates living in Los Angeles to do is to make an occasional trip
to the North. With the University of California at Los Angeles, now
a member of the Pacific Coast Conference, there is the possibility that the
Bruins will not find the prevailing spirit at U.S.C. contagious, and will
offer Stanford the type of competition that the Cardinals want and need.
Kuzell remarks that "you have not taken into consideration the ter
rible nervous strain that an athlete is under when in competition. Being
a former track athlete, I speak from experience." But Mr. Kuzell is
wrong, for "the hot-headed school boy" did take that into consideration,
and he knows a little about the subject of track himself. No possible
amount of nervous strain would make a decent athlete run the mile or
the quarter-mile the way they were run Saturday by our friends, the
Trojans.
