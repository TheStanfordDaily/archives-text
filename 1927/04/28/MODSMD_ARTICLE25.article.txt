# Making Voting Easy

Hie Daily takes quite an avuncular interest in the Campus Y.M.C.A.,
Dutch uncle perhaps, but nevertheless one not inconsistent with the fact
that the "Y" is supposed to be an all-campus student organization and
the Daily is the official student publication.
The "Y" boys do the funniest, most naive things.
For instance, this election.
A committee of three on the "Cabinet"' or inner circle of the asso
ciation nominated one man for each of the four offices to be filled
next year. Cooler heads suggested at the time that a minimum of two
men ought to be nominated for each office to give the thing at least the
semblance of being democratic. But the committee couldn't see it.
Elaborate arrangements are being made to send ballots by mail and
everyone who belonged last year or has contributed any money will be
permitted to vote —less than 300 in all. But there will be the name of
only one nominee for each office printed on the ballot although a space
will be left where others may be "written in."
The joke is that the inner circle which devised the scheme can't
see anything the least bit fishy about it. Anyone who has ever belonged
to an organization knows that, unless there is a militant and well
organized anti-administration party, there isn't a Chinaman's chance of
anybody else being elected if only one name is on the ballot.
The Y.M.C.A. tried to get nearly eleven thousand dollars for its
work on the campus this year. It is supposed to be a student all-campus
organization. It represents Stanford as a whole in the minds of many
who are not familiar with local conditions.
But the old Farm has indeed fallen upon evil days when the leaders
of the Campus Y.M.C.A. are so unsophisticated that they mail out a
printed ballot with only one set of nominees and seriously think they are
conducting an election .
