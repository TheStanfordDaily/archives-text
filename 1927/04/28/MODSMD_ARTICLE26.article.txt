# A 						Graduate Student Society

### 
Graduate students are meeting tonight in an effort to form a graduate
student organization on the campus. With the announcement that Stan
ford will be a graduate university before many years, the need for such
a club is even more pronounced now than ever before. Even now there
is a large number of men and women on the campus who have no affili
ations with any group, and who are therefore left out in the open as far
as social life is concerned.
The proposed plan of the graduate students is to form a social rather
than an educational club. The student who graduates from Stanford
without any connections except through classroom acquaintances, has
lost something of value that the University offersâ€”fellowship. The plan
of the organization is to create friendships between law graduates and
philosophy graduates and engineering graduates, for they all have some
thing in common and have something to offer each other.
There are a great number of worthless societies on the Stanford
campus, but there seems to be a place for a worthwhile organization in
the form of a graduate students' club. The plans outlined by the inter
ested graduates call for something more than an election of members
followed by an initiation, then a group picture for the Quad, and then
disbandment.
