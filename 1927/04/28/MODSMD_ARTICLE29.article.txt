The Editor, Sir:
I note your article which was writ
ten in connection with Saturday's
track meet with the University of
Southern California relative to the in
cident of Jim Hussey elbowing Mc-
Kinnon in the mile run. First of all 1
want to say that my sympathies at all
times have been with Stanford being
a member of the Class of 1919 but did
not graduate. Also have never at
tended U.S.C. It seems to me that your
article is very much uncalled-for and
will only help to make matters worse.
It sounds like a hot-headed school boy
trying to stir up a lot of trouble be
tween two great schools just because
a track man of a competitive school
loses his head in an exciting event and
elbows our man. I noted that the
referee immediately disqualified this
U.S.C. man and gave third place to our
Stanford miler. Why raise all the howl
and immediately ask that athletic re
lations between these two schools be
stopped. This is pure bunk. The South
ern school was punished a few years
ago on account of scholastic standing
of their athletes and I understand that
they are leading the straight and nar
row path since California and Stan
ford both dropped U.S.C. from their
schedules.
The point of this letter is: why start
a feeling of unfriendliness between
two great schools by writing such a
ridiculous article? The Harvard Lam
poon did a lot of damage between
Princeton and Harvard which was en

tirely unwarranted and such articles
is you wrote might do such damage
also. The fact of it is: when I attended
Stanford, fully sixty per cent of the
student body consisted of Southern
California students. Many of these are
now alumni. Why deprive these good
old students an occasional view of our
splendid athletic team, to do so. Many
of the old grads are not fixed finan
cially so that they are unable to make
the trip to Palo Alto to see various
athletic contests and their only salva
tion is the competition that we have
with U.S.C.
Politically, our state" is already di
vided, and there is not a very cordial
feeling between Northern California
and Southern California. Why help
this feeling of enmity along by asking
for a severance of relations between
the two schools? It seems to me that
your article was written in a hasty
way and you have not taken into con
sideration the terrible nervous strain
that an athlete is under when in com
petition. Being a former track athlete,
I speak from experience. One some
times does things in an athletic con
test that he is not responsible for and
why blame the entire University of
Southern California for dirty tactics
when this one kid Hussey elbows Mc-
Kinnon?
I think that you had better resign
your position of editor of the "Daily"
for the good of the school.
Very truly yours,
Dudley F. Kuzell.

want to say that my sympathies at all
times have been with Stanford being
a member of the Class of 1919 but did
not graduate. Also have never at
tended U.S.C. It seems to me that your
article is very much uncalled-for and
will only help to make matters worse.
It sounds like a hot-headed school boy
trying to stir up a lot of trouble be
tween two great schools just because
a track man of a competitive school
loses his head in an exciting event and
elbows our man. I noted that the
referee immediately disqualified this
U.S.C. man and gave third place to our
Stanford miler. Why raise all the howl
and immediately ask that athletic re
lations between these two schools be
stopped. This is pure bunk. The South
ern school was punished a few years
ago on account of scholastic standing
of their athletes and I understand that
they are leading the straight and nar
row path since California and Stan
ford both dropped U.S.C. from their
schedules.
The point of this letter is: why start
a feeling of unfriendliness between
two great schools by writing such a
ridiculous article? The Harvard Lam
poon did a lot of damage between
Princeton and Harvard which was en

tirely unwarranted and such articles
is you wrote might do such damage
also. The fact of it is: when I attended
Stanford, fully sixty per cent of the
student body consisted of Southern
California students. Many of these are
now alumni. Why deprive these good
old students an occasional view of our
splendid athletic team, to do so. Many
of the old grads are not fixed finan
cially so that they are unable to make
the trip to Palo Alto to see various
athletic contests and their only salva
tion is the competition that we have
with U.S.C.
Politically, our state" is already di
vided, and there is not a very cordial
feeling between Northern California
and Southern California. Why help
this feeling of enmity along by asking
for a severance of relations between
the two schools? It seems to me that
your article was written in a hasty
way and you have not taken into con
sideration the terrible nervous strain
that an athlete is under when in com
petition. Being a former track athlete,
I speak from experience. One some
times does things in an athletic con
test that he is not responsible for and
why blame the entire University of
Southern California for dirty tactics
when this one kid Hussey elbows Mc-
Kinnon?
I think that you had better resign
your position of editor of the "Daily"
for the good of the school.
Very truly yours,
Dudley F. Kuzell.
The Editor, Sir:
I note your article which was writ
ten in connection with Saturday's
track meet with the University of
Southern California relative to the in
cident of Jim Hussey elbowing Mc-
Kinnon in the mile run. First of all 1
want to say that my sympathies at all
times have been with Stanford being
a member of the Class of 1919 but did
not graduate. Also have never at
tended U.S.C. It seems to me that your
article is very much uncalled-for and
