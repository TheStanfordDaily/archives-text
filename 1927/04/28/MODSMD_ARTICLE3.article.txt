# GRADUATESTUDENTS WILL MEET TO FORM ORGANIZATION PLANS
## 
### 
Graduate students attending the
University will hold an organization
meeting in the Women's Clubhouse at
7:30 o'clock tonight. John Duniway,
the principal speaker, will outline the
purposes of the organization to the
gathering. Prominent graduate stu
dents will also speak.
Membership is open to any student
taking graduate work here, whether
or not he has been a Stanford under

the club will fill a long-felt need for
joining graduates together in a way
similar to class organizations.
