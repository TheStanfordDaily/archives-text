CARNALITY
(Don't sing—howl)
Hot April breeze,
Gargle, and sneeze,
Hayfever wand'ring around
Sunburn in bloom,
Noses maroon,
Sleepy studes prone on the ground.
Out on the lake,
There they will bake,
Each afternoon 'til past four.
Then, as they spill,
Each one will trill,
"Dip me, dip me, some more —you
w.e.h.r.l.b.b.* —J.R.

Why does he miss
The joy and bliss
Of one sweet kiss?
Is it amiss
That he should kiss
So sweet a miss?
They heard him hiss,
"Why should I kiss
My own kid sis?" —E.W.C.

Fable: A college student was so im
