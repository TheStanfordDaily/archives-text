# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The fifth letter of the Alphabet
affords a slight breathing spell, as it
may be clone with more "E's" than
any other letter except I, Q, U and I
that ever-present trio X, Y, and Z. |
1 have and quite rightly too, grouped j
Von Elm with the "V's," although the
"Golfer's Handbook," an English pub- ;
lication, includes him with the "E's."
Here then, are the all important gent
lemen to be taken up today: H. Chand
ler Egan and his cousin Walter,
Charles Evans, Jr., the six Espinosas
(only five of whom are gentlemen, as
the sixth is a lady), the late J. Douglas
Edgar, who once finished sixteen
strokes ahead of Bobby Jones to win
tho Canadian open championship, and I
who was killed in Atlanta in 1921, and
Victor J. East, the well-known pro of
Australia and the U. S. A,
H. Chandler Egan, the wealthy Ore
gon orehardist, won the United States
amateur championship back in 1904
and 1905. He was known as a long j
driver, and it is said that he developed
into a hard hitter by practicing throw- j
ing the hammer while a student at |
Harvard. He got his first tournament
experience in 1902, when he defeated i
his cousin, Walter Egan, for the West->
year before, and Chandler again
reached the final round in that tourna- j
ment in 1909. Then he dropped from!
sight as a tournament player litil
recent years, and by winning the 1926 i

California state amateur title, he
showed that he still retains his skill,
his courage, and his wallop. •
| "Chick" Evans is one of the best
i known and most-popular of all Ameri
| can amateurs. He has figured promi
i nently in national golf for twenty
| years, and his numerous titles include
the national amateur championship
twice, the national open once, French
championship once, Western open
once, and Western amateur eight
times. In 1916, "Chick" wore both the
amateur and the open crowns of his
native land.
The Espinosa family, five brothers,
Abe, Al, Romie, Henry, and Raymond,
j and one sister, Annette, are all pro
fessionals, and all learned their game
on the Del Monte links, as the family
estate —Rancho de los Pajores—is lo
cated just outside Monterey, Calif.
Abe and Al are the best-known, and
have held several titles and broken
many course records.
