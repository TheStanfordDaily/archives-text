# ATHLETICS, FRATERNITIES WILL SURVIVE LOWER DIVISION CHANGES, SAYS WILBUR
## "Those Questioning Elimination Direct Doubts Only Toward Future Status of College Sideshows" 
### 
"Those who question the elimination ;
of the lower division at Stanford," :
stated Dr. Wilbur in his talk at the
open forum meeting of Euphronia last
night, "direct their doubts toward the J
future status of the sideshows of the
University; that is, athletics and fra
ternities â€”not toward the University
itself. I have confidence enough in
both athletics and fraternities to be
lieve that they are capable of stand
ing such a change.
"It is absurd to use private endow
ment for instruction of university stu
dents in high school work," he con- j
tinued.
"University facilities are unable to j
cope with the ever-increasing number
of University applicants. The junior
college is becoming a necessity to
meet this situation," declared Dr. Wil- .
bur.
Concerning the reaction of alumni,
he stated: "The slowest thing in
America is the advance of education, |
because people who have passed
through the education curriculum in- |
sist that those who follow take the j

identical studies in the same manner.
It is this reverence of tradition that
is holding education back.
'"The demand for trained specialists
becomes greater ae the years pass by.
With the lower division eliminated
more time and effort can be expended
in training these specialists. This
change will greatly increase the num
ber of students who know what they
want to do. I think that Stanford is
going to be one of the most inspiring
campuses in the world.
"California is stiffening its require
ments, thus keeping out a largo num
ber of people who desire higher educa
tion. The junior colleges will be built
by the pressure brought about by
those who fail to gain entrance into
California and other like institutions.
"This change," he declared, "is no
new thing. It has been under consider
ation since my inauguration. Several
years ago it was considered by Cali
fornia. In all the states but ten or
twelve, junior colleges have been es
tablished. This is a trend toward the
gradual elimination of the first two
years in all universities." y
