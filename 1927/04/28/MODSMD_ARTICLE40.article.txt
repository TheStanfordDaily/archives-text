"Japan has been conspicuous among
interested powers in manifesting clear
understanding of the underlying prin
ciples and causes of the present situa
tion in China," stated Professor
Yamato Ichihashi of the History de
partment in an interview yesterday
concerning the Japanese perspective
on the present Chinese conflict.
Because Japan passed through a
similar ordeal during the period 1894-
1911, it is able to sympathize with as
pirations of the Nationalist party in
China, said Professor Ichihashi. Com
plete relinquishment of extra-territor
iality was not realized in Japan until
1899 and tariff autonomy was not
achieved until 1911, in spite of the fact
that a treaty was signed in 1594 by
foreign nations promising these things
at once.
China Far Behind
Although he believes that China is
not as far advanced even yet as Japan
was in 1894, the latter country, he be
lieves, hopes that the ideals it has
realized will become consummate in
China. For instance Japan is the only
country which has restored a terri
tory (the Shantung province) to the
Chinese.
"Since the rise of the Nationalist
party, Japan has been pursuing a pol
icy of non-intervention consistently,"
he said. Japan's "diplomatic blunder"
in making the 21 demands on China
in 1915 is the last unfriendly move it
has made. "That is important," de
clared Professor Ichihashi, "because
of the peculiar position Japan occupies
in the Far East." Although Japan is
vastly interested economically, lie said
Japan is the only country which has
not shown a threat against China. It
has large investments in Manchuria;
it operates a flourishing industry in
beans from the port of Dairen on the
Liaotung peninsula; about S5 per cent

of the foreign population of China is
Japanese; yet it feels that military
aggression is not necessary.
Japan Sympathetic
Unlike Japan, which had unity in
1894, when it began to throw off the
; foreign yoke, China is divided into at
least three de facto governments. In
addition there are innumerable mer
cenary war lords called "Tuchuns"
vho are opposed to a harmonious pa
triotic unification of the whole coun
try. However, as long as the internal
j struggle in China is conducted "with a
; certain degree of decency," Japan is
disposed to view sympathetically the
, attempt of the Chinese to secure na
tional unity, concluded Professor lchi
i hashi.
