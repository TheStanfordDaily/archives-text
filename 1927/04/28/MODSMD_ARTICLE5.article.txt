# BURGESS TO DISCUSS CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL SYNDICALISM RULING
## Unique Civil Liberties Law Relic of "Hate" Period In State History 
### 
Just possessing an I.W.W. member-1
ship card in the free and
state of California, even if the holder;
lives the most law-aiding and blame- j
less life possible, is enough to threaten!
him with several years in the peniten- j
tiary—
Under a law framed during thej
"hate" period when fear created crowd
hysteria dulled the civic consciences '
of the people—
The truth of these statements and :
the general situation with regard to 1
California's much-discussed and al- j
most unique Criminal Syndicalism j
Law will be discussed tonight by R. L.
Burgess at an open meeting of the j
Stanford Fellowship.
Burgess is a member of the execu- !
tive committee of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
He is a recognized authority on the |
Criminal Syndicalism Law, having ad-!
dressed large audiences and testifying j
before state committees in Sacra-!
mento.
The meeting will be open to the pub-;
lie and will be held in the Little
Theatre beginning at 7:30.
