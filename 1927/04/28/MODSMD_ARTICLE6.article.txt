# DAVIS URGES MURAL TEAMS TO TURN OUT FOR FINAL CONTESTS
## 
### 
With the fifth and last round of the \
intramural baseball season starting j
next Monday afternoon and ending on I
Friday with the last games played on'
that date, Coach Charles W. Davis, j
director of intramural activities, re
quests all teams to appear for their |
j games according to the schedule.
"For every forfeited game each team j
j loses two points of the original ten
| received for entering a team in the J
| competition, thus cutting down their
| total for championship rating, depriv
! ing the teams that they are scheduled J
j to meet of an afternoon's play, and!
! eliminating the purpose of the intra-
I mural sports calendar," said Mr. Davis.
The race for leadership in each of j
I (he seven leagues is very close, and a I
1 last-minute defeat or victory of any
I team would seriously affect the final
| standings.
