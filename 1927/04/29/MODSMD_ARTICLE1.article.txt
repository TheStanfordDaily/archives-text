## Captain Zucco Successfully Maintains Title in Foil Battles LAST EVENTS SPIRITED Finals Won by Levit, Irvine, Treanor, Dillon, Hanna, Rochford, Dorman 
### 
Levit, Irvine, Treanor, Rochford,
Dillon, Hanna, and Dorman conclu
sively demonstrated their superiority
in Stanford fighting circles, winning
the bouts in their respective divisions
last night in the finals of the Univer
sity boxing championships.
Captain Zucco successfully defended
his title by again winning the Univer
sity fencing championships, which
were held as an added attraction.
Adams, Coolidge, Alden, and Scotten
followed in the order named.
Four Bouts Good
Probably the four best bouts on
(he night's program came last on the
list. The Treanor-Birch battle was spir
ited and bitter until the final round
when the boys seemed to lose their
punch from sheer exhaustion. Trea
nor, who had already gone
the mill once during the evening, had
to fight both the added fatigue and a
fast, aggressive boxer, but he man
aged to come through with a win.
Gardner and Rochford carried their
bout into an extra round and furnished
plenty of excitement and action. Roch
ford finally took the decision and the
title.
Dillon Bout Fast
Dillon and Harold's spectacular fight
doubtless won the greatest interest of
the evening. For sheer fire and action
their mix-up had no peer. They slugged
and pounded through three hectic
rounds, Dillon showing a marked
superiority only in the final moments.
