Four Bouts Good
Probably the four best bouts on

list. The Treanor-Birch battle was spir
ited and bitter until the final round

gram. His opponent, Burt Simmons,
rroved himself a cool, efficient, heady

ness. He managed to hold off the win
ner until the final frame when the

list. The Treanor-Birch battle was spir
ited and bitter until the final round
when the boys seemed to lose their
punch from sheer exhaustion. Trea
nor, who had already gone
the mill once during the evening, had
to fight both the added fatigue and a
fast, aggressive boxer, but he man
aged to come through with a win.
Gardner and Rochford carried their
bout into an extra round and furnished
plenty of excitement and action. Roch
ford finally took the decision and the
title.
Dillon Bout Fast
Dillon and Harold's spectacular fight
doubtless won the greatest interest of
the evening. For sheer fire and action
their mix-up had no peer. They slugged
and pounded through three hectic
rounds, Dillon showing a marked
superiority only in the final moments.
Dick Dorman successfully defended
liis title iii the last match of tlie pro
gram. His opponent, Burt Simmons,
rroved himself a cool, efficient, heady
ringman, but because of poor condition
could not match Dorman in aggressive
ness. He managed to hold off the win
ner until the final frame when the
latter was clearly putting up a combat
of winning calihre.
