# PLANS FOR SWEDISH MARATHON REVEALED BY COACH BRANDSTEN
## 
### 
Plans were announced yesterday by
Ernst Brandsten for the formation of
teams to represent each class in the
Swedish marathon, which will be held
in Lake Lagunita on May 7.
As in the Irish marathon trials, any
man may he timed for the 50-yard
dash. The fifteen men with the best
times in each class will be chosen to
form the team. Timing will be held
from 4 to 6 o'clock on Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons next week. Ac
cording to present plans, each man
will be timed only once.
The seniors have a fast team and
are doped to win, although the fresh
men have a few individual swimmers,
such as Harrison, Hobdy, Driggs, and
Peters, who can all probably swim
better than 25:3, the rest of the team
will be composed of men without the
speed of this quartet. The sophomores
will give the freshmen a hard race.
With the exception of Van den Akker,
Danford, and Harris, the juniors have
no exceptionally fast mermen, but
their average times are expected to be
equally as high as those of the fresh
men.
