### 
Twenty men leave for Fresno today
with Coach Dink Templeton to com
pete for Stanford University in the
West Coast Relays. The track and
| field carnival tomorrow will be staged
; as (he main afternoon attraction for
! the San Joaquin Valley's annual fes
| tival, Raisin Day.
| More than 300 athletes are entered
| in the different relays and track and
! field events scheduled. Clubs, colleges,
j junior colleges, and high schools from
j all over California will be represented.
U.S.C. to Compete
The University of Southern Cali
| fornia is sending fourteen men to
j Fresno. California has entered five,
with a possibility that more will go.
Stanford's representatives are Hoff
; man, Fleishhacker, Evans, Shipkey.
! Sparling, Goodcell, Bryant, Zornbro,
! Dyer, Edmonds, Hulsman, Nichols,
] Babcock, Spencer, Richman, Syer, Mc-
Kinnon, Dales, Moss, and Clum.
Cards Have Edge
The Cardinal prospects for victory
iin the club and college group are
(bright. Cardinal stars entered should
| finish well up in the relays and high
!in the individual events. Hoffman,
; Shipkey, Zombro, and Nichols are
| doped to win firsts in their events.
I Nichols will probably have a close
| race, however, since he faces Leist
! ner, Maxwell, Reynolds, and Webber,
â–  all possible Olympic Gamej material,
j Zombro, too, will doubtless have tough
! going against Joss Hill of U.S.C., who
beat him out in the dual meet last
Saturday.
Captain Lawrence Babcock, Emer
; son Spencer, Fred Richman, and Bob
i Syer compose the half-mile and mile
j relay teams. Alex McKinnon, Jack
Dales, Tom Moss, and Bill Clum will
; each run a half mile in the two-mile
! relay.
