# Strengthening the Honor System
## 
### 
Violators of the Honor System, if found guilty by the Men's Council,
■will henceforth be required to withdraw from the University, according
to an announcement yesterday by the Council. The punishment, while
tantamount to capital punishment insofar as student government is con
cerned, may seem drastic and severe, but the Council's step is in keeping
with the wording of the pledge by which every student registered here
agrees to withdraw from the University if he violates the Honor System.
lhe policy makes the Honor System of a more serious complexion
than ever. 4 Students contemplating violations will not think twice before
committing a violation—they will think many more times than twice
and then may probably decide against the action. Upon the Council, too,
is placed a greater responsibility.
The announcement of the Men's Council removes any possibility of
the pledge becoming a dead letter, ignored and for use only as a last
resort. Instead, the Honor System is strengthened and the pledge is to
be put to the use for which it was originally designed.
