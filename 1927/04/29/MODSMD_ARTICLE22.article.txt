# What the Public Demands
## 
### 
"Newspapers give too much space to college athletics and too little
to more important college events," the Dartmouth College newspaper
complains. The Dartmouth overlooks the fact that such news is the
type that the campus readers demand. Modern newspaper policy is to
provide the public with the news that it likes, and it is another question
altogether whether those stories are the type which is best for the people.
A football game draws as many as 100,000 spectators, and it is the
duty of the college newspaper to give this large mass of supporters all
the news available about football. A campus debate can seldom fill a
university auditorium, and a story written about a forensic activity is
of interest to only a small group of students, and the space given for
such an affair has to be given in reference to its general interest.
It is true that a newspaper could try to create an interest in scholastic
activities such as debating, fmt when it is proved that the campaign has
become useless, the paper should turn again to athletics where the public's
interest lies. The debaters will still find their activity written up in a
conservative way on the front page of the campus daily.
