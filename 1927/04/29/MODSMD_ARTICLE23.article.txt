# "One Dribble" Basketball
## 
### 
Coach Schlademan of Washington State College believes the Pacific
Coast Conference will refuse to accept the "one dribble" rule drafted by
the National Basketball Rule Committee in their last meeting. The
Cougar coach says,"The new rule may be better for youngsters of the
grades and high schools, but college men like the old rules, college crowds
like the thrill of the dribble and the faster game, and, at least in this
section of the conference, the coaches are for leaving things as they are."
The Pacific Coast Conference will meet at Corvallis, Oregon, on
May 27 and 28, and the matter of accepting or rejecting - the new ruling
in basketball will be considered at that time. It is regrettable that there
cannot be uniform rules over the whole country, but at the same time the
Coast should not ruin its own style of play just to abide by the National
Committee regulations. Next year the National Rules Committee will
meet again and will have to make some changes in the conduct of the
game, and it is perfectly reasonable to believe they will change the rules
back again to their original wording.
