A two-hour course in camp cooking meets every Tuesday and Thurs
day at the University of Oregon, and has become so popular that it has
been divided into sections in order that the students may do their own
laboratory work. The course was planned primarily for men, but is
being taken also by the women students of Oregon who make a habit of
doing Girl Scout and Campfire Girl work during the summer.
It is not known whether the unique course will include instructions
on such things as: how to keep bugs out of the coffee and the ants out
of the sugar; how to keep the smoke from the campfirc out of the eyes;
how to keep the bacon from burning while the student is chopping more
wood for the fire; or how to keep the dispositions pleasant when other
details just do not go right.
