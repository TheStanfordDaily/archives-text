## "TWO TO FIVE YEARS" 
### 
Exasperated beyond endurance by
comic supplement humorists who an
nually send him scurrying over the
campus to extinguish burning hay
stacks, Fire Chief Dugan has declared
his firm intention of bringing charges [
of arson against anyone who starts a 1
fire this year—if he can catch him.
One is forced to sympathize with
Chief Dugan. He is employed as a fire ,
chief. His job is to prevent fires on
the campus if possible, and to extin
guish them if necessary. Yes, one is j
forced to sympathize with Chief Du- 1
gan. j
But at the same time, one feels a
tug at the heartstrings when the chief
resorts to such stern measures to
stamp out a form of entertainment
that has—in the past few years—be- 1
come an integral part of the social life
of the campus. What sport is offered
locally that can compare with a heated j

I chase after a burning haystack? What
a picture the thought conjures—Chief
Dugan himself, his face in an angry
scowl, sitting hunched over the wheel
as he sends the little red chemical
wagon careening up the Row, and be
hind him every car on the campus,
; loaded to the top with howling, excited
' students.
Alas! Is this to be no more? Cannot
something be done to preserve this
dear tradition? What if it is expen
sive? Let the hat be passed on the
Quadrangle. Let the women stage a
! tag day. Let u.s buy all the hay on the
campus, and more if necessary. And
I let us have fires on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings of alternate weeks
throughout the remainder of the quar
ter.
And let us award letters to the
heroes who light the fires. For they
run the risk of being put in jail for a
term varying from two to five years.
