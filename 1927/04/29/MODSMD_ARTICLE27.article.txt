The Editor, Sir:
I read with interest your editorial
in the Stanford Daily of April 26th in
the Berkeley Gazette and wish to con
gratulate Stanford University on hav
ing a student with sufficient courage
to publish an article advocating the
elimination of the University of South
ern California from the list of Stan
ford's athletic competitors.
U.S C. should be eliminated from the
list of every University west of the
Atlantic ocean and then, after the
process, should be kept eliminated,
for they are coached to play dirty,
have played dirty, do play dirty, and
will play dirty. Their motto seems to
be "Win the game, by fou. means or
fair, but win," and they have been
living up to that motto for a good
many years.
Several years ago I was unfortunate
enough to witness a football game
played in Los Angeles between Stan
ford University and the University of
Southern California in which U.S.C.
deliberately put out four of Stanford's
star players, one after the other. It
was done in such an open-handed way
that my companion, a student at the

time in U.S.C., exclaimed, "For
shame."
This type of athletics does no good
to either university.
Yours for clean sportsmanship, win
or lose,
A. Earl Patterson, U.C., '13,
Construction Engineer,
U.S. Public Buildings.
