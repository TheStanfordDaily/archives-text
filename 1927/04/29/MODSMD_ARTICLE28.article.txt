The Editor, Sir:
For the last year a great deal of
effort has been spent to put Stanford
and U.S.C. athletic relations on a satis
factory basis. Last Saturday's incident
is one to be deplored, and yet is a
single editorial in the Daily going to
put all this work to naught?
U.S.C. has punished the guilty man
by suspending him from her team.
This, I think, is an apology on her
part. Yet you, the editor, have not
acknowledged her apology, and have
complicated matters by favoring a
break. We are passing through a crisis
in re-establishing our relations with
the Southern school. The editorial
pulled in the wrong direction; how
about one in the right direction?
—Robert Hardison.
