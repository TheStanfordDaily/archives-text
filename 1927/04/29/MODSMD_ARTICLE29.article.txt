# THE 						REVIEWER
## EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE. By Felix Reisenberg. Harcourt, Brace & Co. 
### 
New York —gay, gaudy, heartless
New York, is pictured as it has never
been pictured before in Felix Reisen
berg's new novel, "East Side, West
Side."
Although the book is written in;
novel form, it is in reality a history '
of America's greatest city, and Mr.
Reisenberg uses his characters merely
to illustrate the growth of the city
and its relentless grip on the people.
Mr. Reisenberg knows his New York,
knows its misty, opalescent Hudson; j
its Ghetto, that teeming crowded set-;
tlement far down on the East Side, !
with its narrow, crooked streets, its 1
dark tenement houses, strange smells j
pouring from dark doorways; its
Bowery with its hock shops and honky- !
tonks, its frowsy bums, painted wo-!
men in its streets, its becapped toughs,'
its brown-derbied dandies — cheap, 1
tawdry Bowery.
Mr. Reisenberg also knows the other
side of his New York, knows its Fifth
Avenue, with its brownstone fronts'
of the middle fifties and its high- j
powered automobiles, its dinner jack-!
ets, its cutaway coats, its silk hats.
Reisenberg's book is breathing, j
teeming history of actual ovents in |
New York as well as its many-sided
life.
Reisenberg bares a city of para-'
doxes, and of entrances and exits, a
fireful, alluring, magnetic city of lies, I
the home of harlots, preachers, j
princes, janitors, and housewives — i
Sodom, Gomorrah, Babylon, Jerusalem,
Kansas City, all in one—wicked, noisy, !
rich and cruel.
A city where there are Columbuses ;
without ships, or oceans, or conti-1
nents; where there are a million Isa-!
Bellas without jewels, and hock shops

handy on every avenue. A city of
Galileos without telescopes or stars,
of Newtons without apple trees. Con
geries of blind Balboas. Catch basin
of failures of the world.
A roaring city welcoming kings,
queens, princes of the world, lauding
heroes —and forgetting them; a city
of scandals, wine baths, milk baths,
beauty contenders, channel swimmers,

and trunk murders; a gay, youthful
city, delightful in headlines; a city of
false values, of tinsel; a city of
trandscendent vaporings, of miasmic
humors; a city where there is no room
to die and all must live with care; a
city of internal combustion, a city of
flames, city of Ur.
Mr. Reisenberg has written a name
for himself among European authors
with a pen of fire in this book.
