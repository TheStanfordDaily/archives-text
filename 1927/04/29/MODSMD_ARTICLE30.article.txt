Ode to a Woman on a R.O.T.C. Horse
"Horse —"
Said my pretty maid,
"Stop horsing me.
"Why should you, my
"Galloping beast, seek
"To kick me?
"Now. please, nice horse,
"Stop jumping so,
"Or off I'll go."
My pretty maid was near
To tears because of
That bad R.O.T.C. horse.
L'envoi
Said she, all bruised
And mad and sore,
"I'll ride never more!"
—J.L.S.

It costa certain denomination more
than $20,000 to get its missionaries out
of China one jump ahead of the con
verts.
How it rejoicetli our heart to think
that we helped in this noble work—
one penny a Sunday for fourteen
years!

I rubbed my eyes,
Was this Stanford?
Three women standing
Around one man!
Then Isa
White felt
On a red sweater.
I stared again,
Was this Stanford?
Three women standing
Around one man!
Then Isa
A snappy car
In the background.
I looked beyond
And there I saw
Three men and a woman
Standing beneath
A cool arch —talking.
This WAS Stanford! —V.C.
