# THIRTY HIGH SCHOOLS WILL PARTICIPATE IN CHAMPIONSHIP MEET
## University Will Be Host to 300 Trackmen Entered In N.C.S. Events 
### 
With thirty high schools entered
and some 300 trackmen participating,
Stanford will be host to the largest
meet of the North Coast Section of
C.I.F. tomorrow afternoon. The events
are scheduled to begin at 2 o'clock in
the stadium.
Due to the recent ruling prohibiting
contenders from taking part who have
not placed before, competition is ex
pected to be unusually keen. In pre
vious seasons the entry list has been
so large that the events were hard to
handle and consequently there was not
much opportunity for establishing new
records.
Seven Squads Entered
Seven schools are sending complete
teams, but others are listing only the
men whom they expect to win events.
Those signing up for entire teams are:
Berkeley, Hayward, Healdsburg, Hoi
lister, Palo Alto, San Mateo, and
Tamalpais.
At present dopesters figure that the
three teams with the best chances for
winning are San Jose, San Mateo, and
Berkeley. Berkeley took second last
year, losing to Palo Alto by one point,
and is expected to provide stiff com
petition. Palo Alto High School is
given little chance to win, although it
may come through with a high-point
average.
