# "WICKED WILLIAM" IS SOPHISTICATED THEME; REFLECTS CONTEMPORARY LIFE
## Dorothy Gamier, Feminine Lead, on Professional Stage Previously; Charles Moore Known for Former Campus Performances 
### John Rogers 
"Wicked William" differs from the
usual run of amateur productions in
that its locale and situations deal with
modern places and affairs in a sophis
ticated manner, and its characters are
counterparts of the men and women
of today who are always getting their
names in the papers.
The leads around whom the dra
matic plot develops are played by
Dorothy Gamier and Charles Moore,
who take the parte of Isabelle Mon
taigne Potter and William Potter, re
spectively. Miss Gamier is new to
Stanford dramatics, but she is not a
newcomer to the stage, for she has
just recently completed six months of
professional dramatic work in the
southern part of the state. Besides
having an excellent stage presence,
her voice is well adapted to musical
comedy, as it has a tine quality and
range. Her "blues" number is particu
larly good.
Moore's Tenor Good
Moore has an excellent lyric tenor
voice, which is especially iglapted to
his songs. He has previously appeared
in campus productions, singing in
"Faust" in the last year's Glee Club
show and playing one of the leads,
Cyril, in "Princess Ida," which was
given last quarter.
In the Junior Opera, William Potter
is a serious-minded chap about thirty
years old, and he is, incidentally,
quite wealthy. But he is consumed by

I an uplifting ambition to invent a pro
cess whereby the egg-laying propensi
ties of the nation's hens will be in
, creased. In fact, he is so wrapped up
! with his peculiar studies that he
i
drives his young wife, Isabelle, to dis
traction, and even to the point of
1 doubting his love.
A Career Interferes
Isabelle has aspirations to be a
noted authoress, and, convinced by
her Greenwich Village spongers, de
sides to turn Lucy Stoner and use her
maiden name, Rlontaigne. She is fur
ther annoyed by William's mundane
invention, which is too prosaic for her
i romantic tendencies, and she becomes
thoroughly bored with marriage.
Marital troubles occur. Husband and
wife have a heated spat, and decide
to sever connections. So Isabelle goes
off to Florida with her artistic friends
and her saucy French maid, Chiquette,
! played by Julia North, who is known
i for her work in "Princess Ida." Then
William gets "wicked," and what he
and his valet, Samuels —played by
Robert Watkins —do not do, isn't
worth relating.
All Ends Well
Just how all the difficulties are
smoothed over, and how others occur,
are takn up in the rest of the comedy.
