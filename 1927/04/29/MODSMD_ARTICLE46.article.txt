# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The decoration shown above is not
a design for a stained glass window in
the Sports B*y of the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine in New York City. It j
is merely a drawing of one of the most j
attractive of the "younger married|
set," whose play on the courts during j
the past year has entitled her to be I
chosen among the select few who are j
considered good enough tennis players i
to try out for a place 011 the United j
States Wightman Cup international;
team. Credit for the graceful border |
around the young lady must be given i
| to Ghiberti, the fourteenth century I
| Florentine sculptor, but I doubt if he
would have wanted a better model for
any of his statues than Mrs. Alfred H. j
Chapin of Springfield, Mass.
To be a good tennis player is all j
very fine, but also to be able to com- j
bine beauty of looks with grace and !
beauty of play is not given to every '
girl, and Mrs. Chapin belongs to that i
lucky group which includes the former
champion, Helen Wills, and the Span
ish senorita, Lili R'Alvarez. There are 1
not many ladies who can win tennis
prizes and beauty prizes both, and A1
Chapin, seventh ranking tennis player
of the U.S.A., showed a bit of rare
judgment when he got into this "love 1
set" with the former Charlotte Hosmer 1
of San Francisco.
Mrs. Chapin is at present in fifth !
position in the national ranking, hav
ing moved up two notches over her
last year's standing. There are many

who have already visualized her sit
ting in (lie throne now occupied by
Mrs. Molla Mallory, as queen of the
nation's tennis stars. The remarkable
Molla defeated Mrs. Chapin in the
round before the semi-final of the wo
men's national singles championships
last August, but Mrs. Chapin defeated
Mrs. Wightman, and, in the doubles,
reached the final round with Mary
Browne as her partner. Her husband
'ins beaten Bill Tilden, and it is not
impossible that they both should be |
champions together some year!
