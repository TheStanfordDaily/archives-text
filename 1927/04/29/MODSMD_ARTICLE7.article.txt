# STATE LAW PERMITS ARREST FOR OPINION, IS BURGESS' CHARGE
## Editor Says Imprisonment Without Overt Act Authorized 
### 
"Californians can be sent to prison
for holding an opinion, regardless of
whether they commit any overt act,"
R. L. Burgess, editor of the San Jose
Evening News, charged in his attack
on the state syndicalism law at the
Stanford Fellowship's open meeting in
the Little Theatre last night.
"The law not only authorizes such
action, but it orders the arrest of any
one suspected of sympathy with a
radical organization. This denial of
the right of free speech is being up
held by the big business interests, who
are determined that the workingman
shall be kept in his place," explained
Burgess.
Attacks Law
As an executive committee member
of the American Civil Liberties Union,
which is campaigning for the repeal
of the syndicalism law, Mr. Burgess
detailed with authority the manner in
which the act restrains personal lib
erty. "In Sacrament othe district at
torney even went so far as to issue
a blanket injunction forbidding any
one to associate with a radical group;
anyone so accused could be rushed
into court and convicted for contempt
of the court's order. Passing such a
law is more than useless, for it harms
all social progress. Members of a
minority should be studied and not
jailed."
The I.W.W.'s were declared to be
the chief cause of the law's passage
at a time when post-war hysteria and
a world-wide movement of repression
was at the peak. Many prominent lib
erals, including Dr. David Starr Jor
dan, are agitating for its repeal, but
the speaker declared that big monied
interests were opposing them. Stu
dents and others interested in politics
were named responsible for the move
ment to improve the mechanism of
government by repealing such unjust
laws.
