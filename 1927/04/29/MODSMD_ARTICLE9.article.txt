# STATEMENTS MADE BY U.S.C., STANFORD ON SPORT QUESTION
## TROJANS ARE DEFENDED Hussey's Interference With McKinnon Deplored by Southern Faculty 
### 
Official statements from both sides
in the controversy over the mile run
and the 440 in the Southern California-
Stanford track meet last Saturday
have heen issued by both parts is to
the argument.
Hugh C. Willet, chairman of the
faculty athletic committee of the Uni
versity of Southern California, in a
letter addressed to Dr. Storey, head
of Stanford athletics, takes official
cognizance of the situation arising out
of the occurrences of last Saturday's
meet. The action taken by the U.S.C.
committee was expressed in these
words:
U.S.C. Apologizes
"The faculty athletic committee of
the University of Southern California
has investigated the incident that oc
curred at the Stanford-California track
meet last Saturday and deplores Mr.
Hussey's interference with Mr. Mc-
Ivinnon in the one-mile run. The com
mittee is convinced that Mr. Hussey's
offense was not premeditated and that
he was not coached to use unfair
methods; but the fact remains that
rules were violated, and that Mr. Hus
sey was quite properly disqualified for
his interference.
"It has been deemed best to with
draw Mr. Hussey from competition for
the present, and use this occasion to
impress upon all that the University
of Southern California will not toler
ate unfair tactics, nor unsportsman
like conduct on the part of any of its
representatives."
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, who saw
Hussey commit iiis foul, gave the fol
lowing statement to thi press in vindi
cation of Coach Dean Cromwell of
U.S.C.:
"The fact that everyone at the meet
saw the foul makes it apparent that it
was an outgrowth of momentary tem
perament 011 the part of the boy who
committed it. Such things are liable
to happen at any meet. Public senti
ment against such acts will do more
toward checking them than any inves
tigation or athletic break could ever
do. There will be no action 011 our
part."
