# DOCTOR BLACK GIVES FINAL WEST LECTURE ON LIFE AFTER DEATH
## "Immortality Is Bound Up With God," Declares Theologian 
### 
Discussing the problem, "If a man j
die, shall he live again?" Dr. Hugh |
Black, in his last West Memorial
series lecture Friday night, said, "it •
is intellectually inconceivable that per-!
sonality can be annihilated, and it is '
morally inconceivable to believe in j
God and deny immortality, for in the \
last issue immortality is bound up with j
God."
Four Ways of Approach
Dr. Black pointed out four ways of i
approach to the question besides the;
"natural way—as an adventure": the I
scientific method, giving 110 assurance j
of the soul's surviving the shock of |
death but still not doubting hope; j
philosophical arguments, basing every- j
thing on personality; moral and etlii-!
cal arguments, wishing to provide a j
future to satisfy "man's deep passion j
for justice" and trying to explain the !
disparity between man's moral nature j
and the facts of life; and finally human
nature itself, out of selfishness desir- j
ing a permanent satisfaction of in- 1
stinct.
"Your proof of immortality," said |
Dr. Black, "must be part of your proof
of God. Likewise, our view of human
destiny depends on our conception of
human nature, and if we accept the
essential dignity of human nature, we
are compelled to believe in eternal j
life.
"Belief in God is a conviction tr.at j
moral worth reigns in the universe, i
and so we look for immortality be-'
cause we want to see value crowned.
Faith an Adventure
"We don't make a real venture in
the adventure of faith, for we are,
always drawing back to a static con
dition. Yet we do revolt against a
static heaven. To us extension of life
would be nothing; there must be a
moral elevation in our scale of life, aj
scope for progressive development, a j
fruition of rudimentary capacities.
"According to Shaw's 'Back to Me- j
thuselah' it is hardly worth while to j
live —he says we need at least 300 j
years. To me it is a pretty cogent j
argument, 'needing more time' for a
motive. But what a motive it might be
if man would act on the faith that he
would live forever! 'If a man die, shall
he live again?' If a man lived for-'
ever !"

destiny depends on our conception of
human nature, and if we accept the
essential dignity of human nature, we
are compelled to believe in eternal j
life.

Faith an Adventure
"We don't make a real venture in
the adventure of faith, for we are,
always drawing back to a static con
dition. Yet we do revolt against a
static heaven. To us extension of life
would be nothing; there must be a
moral elevation in our scale of life, aj
scope for progressive development, a j
fruition of rudimentary capacities.
"According to Shaw's 'Back to Me- j
thuselah' it is hardly worth while to j
live —he says we need at least 300 j
years. To me it is a pretty cogent j
argument, 'needing more time' for a
motive. But what a motive it might be
if man would act on the faith that he
would live forever! 'If a man die, shall
he live again?' If a man lived for-'
ever !"
Discussing the problem, "If a man j
die, shall he live again?" Dr. Hugh |
Black, in his last West Memorial
series lecture Friday night, said, "it •
is intellectually inconceivable that per-!
sonality can be annihilated, and it is '
morally inconceivable to believe in j
God and deny immortality, for in the \
last issue immortality is bound up with j
God."
Four Ways of Approach
Dr. Black pointed out four ways of i
approach to the question besides the;
"natural way—as an adventure": the I
scientific method, giving 110 assurance j
of the soul's surviving the shock of |
death but still not doubting hope; j
philosophical arguments, basing every- j
thing on personality; moral and etlii-!
cal arguments, wishing to provide a j
future to satisfy "man's deep passion j
for justice" and trying to explain the !
disparity between man's moral nature j
and the facts of life; and finally human
nature itself, out of selfishness desir- j
ing a permanent satisfaction of in- 1
stinct.
"Your proof of immortality," said |
Dr. Black, "must be part of your proof
of God. Likewise, our view of human
destiny depends on our conception of
human nature, and if we accept the
essential dignity of human nature, we
are compelled to believe in eternal j
life.
