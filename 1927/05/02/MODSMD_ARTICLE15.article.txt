Intramural baseball will swing into
the final week of the schedule this
afternoon when five games in the fifth
round will be played on the four intra
mural and Sequoia diamonds. At the
close of the fourth round last Friday
Sequoia, Phi Gamma Delta, Beta Tlyda
Pi, El Tigre, and Delta Chi held top
honors in their leagues, and Theta Chi
and El Campo, and Theta Delta Chi,
Chi Psi, and Sigma Nu were tied for
first in Leagues II and VII.
El Tigre Wins League
Friday's games caused a consider
able change in the standings which
probably will determine the champions
of two leagues. El Tigre eliminated
the Independents froip. the title race
and ended their season with five vic
tories and no defeats. They are the
first team to capture the champion
ship of a league. Delta Chi defeated
the strong Breakers' nine 4 to 0 to
place themselves at the top of League
VI, and in the position of probable
winners of the championship.
The El Tigre-liulependents encoun
ter developed into a free hitting con
test and was anybody's game until
the last inning. Both teams scored in
nearly every frame, and numerous
home runs were a feature of the game.
Delta Chis Lead
Delta Chi jumped into the lead in
League V by their 4 to 0 victory over
Breakers, the team that had been
doped to take the title in this division.
The game was one of the few of last
week that went the full seven innings
and was marked by fine playing on
both sides. However, Salsman, Delta
Chi hurler, had Breakers' batters
%
guessing, and succeeded in blanking
them while his teammates, aided by
two Breakers' errors, tallied four
times.
Games scheduled for this afternoon
are listed elsewhere in today's paper.
