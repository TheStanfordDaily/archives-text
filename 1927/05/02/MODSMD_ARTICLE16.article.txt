### 
As the outstanding feature of the
1926-27 all-University swimming pro
gram, Coach Ernst Brandsten an
nounced the plans last night for the
fitst annual All-University Gold Medal
swimming championships. The compe
tition will begin this week, culminat
ing in the finals on May 12.
Seven championships are attainable,
and will be awarded to winners in the
following events: 100-yard free style,
220-yard free style, 440-yard free style,
150<-yard breaststroke, 150-yard back
stroke, fancy 10-foot diving, and a
four-man 400-yard relay.
Entries are open to any men regis
tered in the University, with the ex
ception of holdovers and graduates.
A man may enter as many events as
he desires, but will not be allowed to
compete after he has once taken a
first, place. The relay will not be
counted under this ruling.
Brandsten advises all men intend
ing to enter the competition to regis
ter early for their respective events so
that heats can be held wherever neces
sary.
