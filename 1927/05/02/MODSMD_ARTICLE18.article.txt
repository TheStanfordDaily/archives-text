Dr. Gardner Commends
In recommending this drive to the
students, Dr. 1). Charles Gardner,
president of the board of directors,
stated: "I commend the appeal of your
student committee on behalf of the
Stanford Convalescent Home. This is
the one charity—the one bit of social
service backed by Stanford students.
It means the constant care of forty
children, struggling out of weakness
toward health and strength. It costs |
$33,000 a year. We need $5000' from
our local friends to balance our budget
for this year."
