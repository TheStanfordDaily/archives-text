# SOPHOMORES VICTORS IN FINAL INTERCLASS TENNIS COMPETITION
## Class of 1929 Loses Only One Match in Seven Against Seniors 
### 
Dropping but one match of seven,
the 1929 interclass tenuis team came
through with its expected victory over
the seniors Friday afternoon in the
final contest of the series and became
undisputed interclass champion.
The seniors did not have a chance
at any time during the match, their
only win being in the final struggle.
In the singles Wheatley rtnd Howard
of the sophomores had little trouble,
and Renzel was not really extended,
his accuracy in placing marking him a
certain winner.
The only real contests were in the
ragged third and fourth doubles,
where the lead continually see-sawed.
Superiority of the sophomore racket
ers has been in evidence throughout
the interclass series. They dropped
only two matches to the freshmen and
made a clean sweep against 1928.
