A committee appointed for the purpose of revising the constitution
of the Associated Students of Stanford University will present the
student body with a brand new book of rules very soon now. Ihe con
stitution committee, itself, iebls that the new laws are excellent and should
be accepted by the students, but Stanford is not forced to accept the
committee's generous gift. An election will be held within the next, few
weeks to allow students to decide for themselves whether the new rules
are good.
As a matter of principal, every student should be interested in the
laws under which they arc to be governed, livery man and woman at
Stanford should take half an hour off to read the revised provisions on
student government, for the shortness of the new body of rules is one
of the features that the committee points to with pride. Superfluous
material has been eliminated.
It was decided that a special election should be held for the purpose
of allowing the students to pass on their new laws, rather than placing
the proposition on the general election ballot on the last Tuesday in May.
The reason given for this action is that it is believed that a more interested
vote would be cast under this plan. Few would take the trouble to vote
at a special election unless they knew what they were voting for, while
if the constitution were voted 011 when the student body officers are
chosen, the student would feel he should vote "yes" or "no ' to complete
his ballot. He would be voting in the dark, and bis vote would be of 110
use or importance. The Executive Committee believes it would be better
to have one hundred students vote who have read the new constitution
and therefore know what they were voting for, than to have one thousand
students cast ignorant votes.
The final draft of the constitution that is to be voted upon, is now
being drawn up, and when it is ready to be made public, it will be posted
011 the bulletin boards about the campus. It should be read before voting
for there is the possibility that the new rules are taking away some of
the students' personal liberty. A person would never sign away his life
or buy Brooklyn Bridge if he investigated the proposition before him.
