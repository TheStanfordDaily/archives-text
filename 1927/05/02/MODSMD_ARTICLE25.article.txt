# Every Dog Has Its Day

### 
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Junior Week! The Class of 1928 will
hold daily meetings in the Basketball Pavilion, where entertainment will
be furnished at all hours of the day and night. Both men and women
are asked to participate in the doings at the Pavilion, in order that the
main tent will be in order by Friday night for the Prom.
The Prom sets the ball rolling, and the following dayâ€”Saturday, will
be filled with activities of all sorts and varieties. Lake sports, the
Corduroy Ball, and the Junior Opera have been arranged for the amuse
ment of the campus on Saturday. The Juuiors are the hosts, and every
student at Stanford is their guest this week-end.
