With the present rushing season at
tention has again been turned to the
old, old problem of fraternities and
freshmen. One salient fact is appar
ent. In spite of the introduction of
deferred rushing, and in spite of the
creation of a complicated mess of
rules, rushing is still characterized by
an abnormal emotional intensity that
precludes any possibility of appropri
ately sane and careful judgment on
the part of either freshmen or fra
ternity men.
This condition has prevailed in the
past possibly to a greater degree than
it does now. It certainly prevails now
to a degree that is wholly undesirable
and objectionable. And what is the
Cause of it?
It is caused by the confusion in the
conception of a fraternity of the honor
society with the living group. Primar
ily, a fraternity house is a place where
a man will live during the four years
he is in college. However, a fraternity
has assumed in the minds of a num
ber of college men a sort of social im
portance. It is considered a particular
honor to belong to a certain fraternity,
just as it is considered no distinction
to belong to another.
A freshman choosing a fraternity is

I therefore faced with the problem of
I compromising between the group in
| which he would like to live and the
| group to which he would like to be
! come affiliated because of its reputa
; tion. In the same way a fraternity, as
a matter of policy, is forced to con
sider the men whom it is taking in,
i not only from a point of view of tem
peramental compatability with the
j men already in the house, but from a
point of the prestige they will add to
I the chapter.
A suggested method of alleviating
j this situation is hereby offered for
! what it is worth, in the full knowledge
that it is premature. The great fra
| ternity problem is to separate the
I living group from the honor society
j in the fraternity. In the future this
j may be done by perpetuating the pres
| ent fraternities as purely social or
-1 ganizations, corresponding in nature
to town clubs. At the same time a sys
tem of living groups could be intro
j duced that would be organized as
loosely as possible, leaving all indi
viduals, whether or not they belonged
to fraternities, the utmost latitude in
j choice of a place to live, and it neces
, sarily follows choice of living com
j panions. â€”Stephen O'Donnell.
