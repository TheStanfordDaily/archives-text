# FOREIGNERS PRESENT STANFORD PROBLEMS
## 
### Maxine Cushing 
Do foreign students on the Stanford
campus present a problem? They do, I
both to themselves and to the student ;
body, educationally and socially. And i
there is a definite solution, These are i
conclusions drawn not from an indi
vidual glimpse into the foreign student j
situation but from a series of inter
views with men and women whose
time, partially or wholly, is spent with
foreign students on the campus and
with foreign students themselves.
Professor Yamato Ichihashi, associ
ate professor of Japanese History and
Government, expressed the prevailing j
sentiment when he said, "The main
difficulty, the biggest adjustment, is
learning the language. Either the im
migration law should be revised so
that students could have three months
in America to learn English before at
tending school, or Stanford could
make it compulsory for foreign stu
dents to take a special course unless |
they can pass an English test.
"Stanford has less prejudice than
the University of California," was his i
opinion, "and Palo Alto people are
more sympathetic with Chinese and
Japanese than Berkeley people. There
is a certain degree of prejudice, how
ever, and the foreign students must j
expect it, because it is the same as
the American would receive in a for
eign country unless he were excep
tional. The trouble is that Americans ;
expect foreigners to be Americans.
They must be generous and sympa-j
thetic, and Chinese and Japanese must j
realize on their part that conditions
are not the same as they are at home.
"The Cosmopolitan Club is doing a
good work," he added, "although more
American students should be inter
ested."
Orientals Chief Problem
Professor Ichihashi referred particu
larly to the Japanese and Chinese
students on the campus when speak
ing of a foreign-student problem; the
fact that all who were interviewed
took the same view seems to indicate !
that Oriental students are the only
foreigners who present any problem j
of assimilation.
This theory was upheld by Miss
Constance Schottel, Belgian exchange!
student taking a post-graduate law
course, who said: "Conditions are dif-,
ferent here, but we just ask, 'how is
this? how is that?' and we soon get :
adjusted." She agreed that an made- i
quate knowledge of English was the j
main trouble.
Rex Bell, Stanford Y.M.C.A. secre-1
tary, holds the same opinion in regard
to the difficulties facing a foreign stu- i
dent who is not well acquainted with
the language. "Learning English is
the biggest problem facing a foreign
student," he said, "but there is also j
the question of making contacts with
the American students on the campus. |
Both sides will gain by working to- 1
get her; the problem is how to bring !
this about.
"The Japanese and Chinese are the
ones I speak of particularly. They aro
anxious to make contacts and have a
decided contribution to make, but they
are naturally timid and rebuffs dis
courago them.
Housing Emphasizes Problem i
"Their isolation is a real problem, <

however, and it is emphasized by the
housing situation here. Americans
should take the lead in avoiding this
! complete isolation." Considering the
: whole question, Bell said that there
was "no positive discourtesy, but
l there is indifference."
An explanation as to why foreign
i students hesitate to take a prominent
part in campus life was offered by
Miss Bessie Jeong, American-born
Chinese student, who said: "They get
an inferiority complex because they
must take an unimportant place in
University life here after having been
leaders in their own colleges. Ameri
j can - born foreigners don't have as
I much trouble, but the Chinese and
j Japanese must make adjustments—
j they have to learn the language and
customs."
Bean Mary Yost took an optimistic
viewpoint. She remarked that "There
are not enough foreign students on
| the Stanford campus to make a differ-
I ence (there are 107 out of 3,304 stu
dents), but on a campus where there
: are many, as at California, foreign
J students give it a non-provincial at
j mospliere. Their presence at least ex
poses the whole student body to view
points other than their own."
Americans Self-Sufficient
Walter Gieseke, instructor in the
I Germanic Languages department and
; a Stanford graduate, took rather an
! opposite attitude. He said:
: "Slfall I always be a foreign stu
j dent? Yes —as long as so many Ameri
| cans feel to be foreigners—and as
1 lons as the intellectual, the highbrow,
is a caricature in college comics.
"The foreign student is isolated in
many ways. America is self-sufficient
in every way; it does not need to
know other people, other nations,
: their languages, their culture.
"We cannot understand our fellow
I citizens for everyone talks another
language; much less do we under
stand other people, other nations, oth
er civilizations.
"Because the foreign student is not
used to sports, he feels alone men
tally."
The problem of a foreign group on
i the campus is generally recognized.
I The University of Washington Daily
concludes after a survey of its own
campus, as follows:
"One gathers: That even among the
recognized intelligentsia the color of
I the skin determines the extent of as
| sociation among peoples; that the for
j eign students are seeking to discover
' the extent of their problems and as
' sist in clearing them; that foreign stu
j dents have formed associations of
j their own in order to have compan-
I ionship which they fail to receive
from the general student body."
