# AIR SERVICE LOCATES ON CAMPUS TO MARE SOUND OBSERVATIONS
## Spot-Lights to Place Planes In Night Flights Made Over University 
### 
Locating the position of flying planes
by sound rather than by sight will
constitute the manoeuvers of Battery
A of the 63rd Coast Artillery, Anti-
Aircraft Division, from Fort Scott,
San Francisco, which is making its
headquarters- on the campus for a
period of five weeks. The night work
consists of making sound "observa
tions" by which the plane is located
at the intersection of spot-light beams.
Aircraft Service Aids
The work is carried on in conjunc
tion with the aircraft service planes
coming from Crissy Field, San Fran
cisco, and operating from a landing
field near Redwood City. The planes
fly above the campus at night, guided
by two pilot lights between here and
the landing field. Listening devices,
known as exponential sound horns,
are operated by a crew of four men
each. One listens for direction of sound
in a horizontal position, or the azimuth
as it is called. Another listens in a
perpendicular plane to the first in
order to determine the elevation of
the craft; the remaining two men read
the scales giving the angle of the
azimuth from the true north, and the
angle of elevation.
The data is then sent to a plotting
room by a field telephone and is there
corrected for sound lag, atmospheric
density, and wind. After a series of
complicated calculations the informa
tion is given to the light crew which
is also equipped with azimuth and
perpendicular scales. At the command
"in action" the light is thrown on, and
if everything has been properly han
dled, the plane is spotted.
Ratio One to Six
One direct hit in six is considered
a good average. A battery of other
lights at different spots sweep the area
about the tip of the first beam in
order to pick up the plane if it is not
found on the initial trial. The work
must be done rapidly or the plane will
be in a different portion of the sky
before the light is turned on. Usually
an interval of three minutes elapses
from the time the sound is first picked
up until the light goes on.
After the preliminary practice,
which is now being held, is com
pleted, regular mock warfare will be
carried on, lighted flares being used
to simulate bombs.
