# ATHENS CLUB'S TEN PIECE ORCHESTRA TO PROVIDE PROM MUSIC
## 
### 
Music for this year's Junior Prom
will be furnished by the new Athens
Club Orchestra of Oakland, announced
Dick Worden, chairman of the music
committee for the dance. This ten
piece orchestra has caused quite a sen
sation in the East Bay district and
promises to furnish the kind of syn
copation that is required at a Prom.
Work (yi the decorations will be
started today as the sets will arrive
from the California Decorating Com
pany of San Francisco either this
morning or this afternoon. These will
be rather difficult to hang as there
will be back panels as well as network
drops to arrange, and skill in handling
will be necessary to obtain the proper |
effect for an enchanted forest.
A1 Cass will be in charge of this i
branch of the work and has requested i
that all members of the Class of 1928
be at the Pavilion either this after- J
noon or tonight.
Women are urged to be present this
afternoon and to bring scissors with !
them for work on the decorations. j
Entertainments will be held at vari- j
ous times throughout the day in order j
to alleviate the work, while fifteen-1
minute dances will be held and re- ]
freshments served periodically. The J
arrangements for this are being car-'
ried out by Anne Hartwell.
