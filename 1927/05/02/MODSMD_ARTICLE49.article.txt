# TWO CROWNS WANTED!

"Two souls with but a single i
thought, two hearts that beat as one."
That familiar line fits the cases of
Glenna Collett and Helen Wills very
well indeed. In 1926 both of these |
young queens lost their crowns and j
they want them back —oh, how they
want them back! Glenna, national wo-j
men's golf champion, was beaten in
the third round at Merion last October ,
by little Miss Virginia Wilson. Helen, I
national women's tennis champion,!
was unable to play in defense of her 1
title at Forest Hills last August, be- !
cause she ,ha<J not sufficiently recov- !
ered from the appendicitis operation ;
she underwent in France during the j
early summer. Two married ladies
copped their titles —Mrs. G. Henry
Stetson won the golf tournament, and
Mrs. F. B. Mallory (the famous Molla)

the tennis tournament.
(llenna and Helen have much in
common besides the fact that they are
both on the war-path to regain their
lost laurels. Each wants to make her
"come-back" complete, and so the
greatest girl golfer of American will
try to win the English women's cham
pionship, and is planning to sail this
month for that purpose, and the great
est girl tennis player of America
wants to win the Wimbledon tourna
ment. I3oth young ladies were frus
trated in their invasions of England
last year, Glenna by the industrial
strike and Helen by the aforemen
tioned appendix.

I was surprised to find out that
these two famous athletes had never |
met. In all their wanderings for
sport's sake, the paths of Miss Collett.
of Providence, R. 1., and Miss Wills, of,
Berkeley, Calif., have not yet crossed. 1
I looked them both up in New York
not so long ago and found out the
following things about them: Glenna |
has tried tennis, but doesn't like to'
play it, and Helen has tried golf, hut
can't see it a-tall! Helen was taught
to swim by her father to make her
strong and healthy, but doesn't like
it. Glenna loves to swim, but gets
quite tired doing it. Neither one will
ever try to swim the English Channel, i

Both love the game they are famous
for most of all, of course, but Helen is
deeply interested in her stuly of art
and wants to be an illustrator, while
Glenna is busy promoting the new
Westchester Women's Golf and Tennis
Club.
Glenna will be 25 in June, Helen 22
in October. Both are about the same
size and build, and neither one has
bobbed hair. No flappers, these two,
yet full of pep, with keen senses of
humor, and a natural love for sports
and dancing. I asked each one if she
was very nervous before an important
match, and Helen said "no," but that
she was "more excited the night after
a big match than the night before,"
and she likes the excitement of tour
nament play. Glenna, on the other
hand, is quite nervous just before the
match starts, but this all wears off
after the first hole is played.
