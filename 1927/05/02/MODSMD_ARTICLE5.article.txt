# CONCLUDING WEEK OF RUSHING WILE CLOSE SATURDAY
## PLEDGING FRIDAY NOON Houses Must Hand in Bids To Clerk at Union On Wednesday 
### 
After several weeks of preliminary
anxiety and turmoil, the final period
of fraternal rushing begins today, and
the grand finale takes place Friday in
the Old Union when freshmen go be
fore the lawyer appointed by the In
terfraternity Board of Control and
choose their living quarters for the
next three or more years.
Wednesday afternoon between 2 and
4 o'clock, all bids must be delivered
in the Old Union to a clerk, also ap
pointed by the board. Each fraternity
must type its bids and arrange them
in alphabetical order.
Rushing ends Thursday night at 8
o'clock. On this last day, from 5:30 to
5 o'clock, each freshman may visit as
many of the fraternities as he wishes.
Friday morning is designated as
"quiet period," and during this time
there is to be no rushing whatsoever.
Any violations of this order will be
dealt with at noon, Friday, by the
Interfraternity Board of Control,
which meets then in the Old Union to
hear all complaints. If it is found that
any of these complaints are justified,
the freshmen involved will not be al
lowed to pledge the houses guilty of
the violations.
This last rushing period extends
over four days—from Monday through
Thursday—at the usual times, from
11:30 to 2 o'clock and from 5:30 to 8
o'clock. The freshmen may accept as
many dates as they wish from each
fraternity during this final period.
