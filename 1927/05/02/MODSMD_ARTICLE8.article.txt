IVTOT only are the comic and dramatic leads of "Wicked William" well
chosen, hut also the supporting roles are played by campus actors noted
for their abilities and previous performances.
As Nadine Fairchild, Lucie Bentley again portrays a scheming divorcee,
similar to the part she played in last year's Junior Opera, "Ride a Cock-
Horse." Mrs. Fairchild is a clever women in her thirties —though she would
never admit it —who is very much interested in "wicked" William, and it is

>because of her designs on him that
she assuihes a friendly attitude to
ward his wife.
Fitz Is "Hello" Girl
Kathleen Fitz, in the part of Dolly
O'Shea, is a snappy, gum-chewing tele
phone operator in an Atlantic City
hotel, where she comes in contact
with the world-famous moving-picture
stars who are engaged in making the
colossal triumph, "Women I have
Known." Dolly's incessant ambition is
to be an actress, and she tries her best
to achieve it. Miss Fitz is a dramatic
find of last year when she played the
lead in the "Book of Charm."
Speegle Plays Bell-Hop
Dolly's companion in crime at the
hotel is the stuttering bell-hop, Oscar,
played by Paul Speegle. He and two
counts, Anchova and Pushov, carry
most of the comedy of the opera.
Speegle previously appeared this year
as one of the young princes in "The
Swan." Ben. the hotel clerk, who is
complicated with Dolly and Oscar, is
portrayed by Stevens llalstead, new
to the Stanford stage.
