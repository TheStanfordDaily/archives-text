# BABE SOCCER ELEVEN BLANKS SOPHOMORES IN INTERCLASS GAME
## Second-Year Men Unable to Break Through Defense In Drive for Goal 
### 
Coming through with an expected
victory, the freshman soccer team de
feated the sophomore eleven by scor
ing four goals yesterday afternoon in
the first interclass soccer play. Two
goals were made by Joe Borden, while
Homer Hartzell and John Jennings
each scored one.
The sophomores were unable to get
beyond the freshman defense in their
offensive, while the yearlings ran
through the other team consistently.
Borden, playing inside left for the
freshmen, was the outstanding player
of the afternoon. Ben Frost, playing
center half, stopped many of the
drives of the Class of '29.
For the sophomores, A1 Gibbs, cen
ter forward, and Wally Fell, center
half, starred.
Next Wednesday afternoon the sen
iors will meet the juniors in the second
day of play in the interclass series.
