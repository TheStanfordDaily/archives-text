One more league championship in
intramural baseball was settled yes
terday afternoon in the first day's play
of the fifth and last round of the tour
ney when Dick Gregory pitched the
Phi Gamma Delta nine to a 13 to 3
victory over El Capitan. In the only
other game played, Theta Delta Chi
and Sigma Nu battled to a 9 to 9 tie,
which further complicates the race for
leadership in League VII, for with Chi
Psi, these teams were in a triple tie
for the title.
Zetes Win by Forfeit
Zeta Psi and Encina 111 finished
their season's baseball by taking 7 to 0
wins by forfeit from Encina Basement,
and Los Arcos respectively, while the
Chi Psi-Theta Xi game was postponed
due to a misunderstanding.
Coming through in fine style in its
last game, and with over a week in
which to practice for the preliminary
play-offs for the championship, the
Fiji nine will put in a serious threat
for the University championship. Greg
ory, a veteran on the mound, struck
out seventeen of the El Capitan bats
men yesterday, and with a fast curve,
and a good change of pace, will keep
his team in the running through the
semi-finals, the only serious opponent,
according to the dope, being Delta Chi.
Display Teamwork
The Fiji team shows good teamwork,
having plenty of batting ability and a
strong outfield. The only noticeably
weak point in the defense was an un
steady infield in handling the ground
ers o nthe choppy polo field.
