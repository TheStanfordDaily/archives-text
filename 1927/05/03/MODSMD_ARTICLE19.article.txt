# LATEST DANCE STEPS TO APPEAR IN JUNIOR OPERA
## 
### John Rogers 
With an expert corps of directors
working on "Wicked William," this
year's Junior Opera promises to be
one of the most finished productions
of the Stanford stage. Gordon Davis,
Director of Dramatics, is generally
supervising the entire comedy, but,
more particularly, is managing the
strictly dramatic part, leaving the
other sections, to assistants.
Davis Directs
"Wicked William" and the Senior
Farce will be Davis' only work on the
campus this quarter, and after sum
mer quarter he will leave for a year's
travel in Europe. This is the first
.Timor Opera he has directed for some
lime, the one last season being man
aged by students.
Frances lioone, noted for her dance
direction in "Princess Ida," is super
vising the three choruses. To keep
step with the sophisticated air of the
production, she got one of the chorus
girls of "Castles in the Air" to teacli
her several steps new to tlie metropoli
tan stage, and they will appear in
"Wicked William." Miss Boone lias

formerly appeared in several campus
vaudevilles in novelty solos.
Large Orchestra Used
The music for the opera is under
the supervision of Gordon Hall, who
was also musical director of last
year's "Football Gaieties." Hall has
pieced together the musical plot,
superintended the writing of the
lyrics, and is conducting the special
twelve-piece orchestra. The orchestra
tion of the opera songs has been com
pleted by Emil Hreitenfeld, who does
the work for Rube Wolf.
E. Leslie Kiler, who has designed
the sets of most former productions,
has spent more than the usual effort
in making the settings for the comedy
exceptional. Three changes of scenery
are used, and each calls for an elabo
rate setting. The first, act takes place
in a room in "wicked" William Potter's
house, the second in an Atlantic City
hotel lobby, and the last in a moving
picture studio.

A few tickets at $1 and $1.25- aro
still on sale at the ticket, office in the
Old Union every afternoon from 1 to 5
o'clock.
