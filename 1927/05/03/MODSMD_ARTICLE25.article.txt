### Joe Carroll 
Fresh from a victory in their divi
sion in the West Coast Relays held
at Fresno last Saturday as a main
feature of the Raisin Day celebration,
Coach Dink Templeton and his Stan
ford University track squad are now
looking for more fields to conquer.
As a result of this aspiring to
greater honors, the Cardinals will
enter the P.A.A. championships to ha
held in San Francisco May 14. Every
man who wishes to compete will be
entered, says Coach Templeton. A full
and complete freshman team will also
take part.
Many Prizes Won
Sixteen wrist watches and a large
cup denoting championship honors in
the Class A section of the West Coast
Relays were the spoils of victory car
ried oft' by Stanford University track
and field stars in their victorious trip
to Fresno last week-end.
Eight relay runners captured twelve
watches, members of the half-mile and
mile squads gathering in two apiece.
The two-mile team members each
gained a watch while they were set
ting a Pacific Coast record.
The two-mile record will stand only
on the hooks of the West Coast Re
lays, due to the fact that the fast
Washington outfit, led by Captain
Charteris, and pushed by the U.S.C.
quartet, ran the distance two seconds
faster than the Cardinal sophomores
did.
Biff Hoffman gathered in two
watches by heaving the shot 49 feet
2 inches and hurling the discus 154
3V& inches. Victory for the Cardinal
star was doubly sweet, due to the fact
that Bud Houser was forced to take
second to Biff in both events.
Fred Zombro earned his wrist watch
by jumping 24 feet 5% inches. He also
Jess Hill, Trojan btar, who
won the event in the Stanford-U.S.C.
meet. <â€¢
Ross Nichols won a watch through
his ability as a speech-maker. He was
disqualified in the morning heats be
cause he knocked over too many hur
dles. Convincing officials that he
should be allowed to compete, he tied
the Coast record by running the flight
of high hurdles in 14.6 seconds.
Runners Star
Captain Larry Babcock, Fred "Rich
man, Bob Syer, and Bud Spencer were
the runners who received two watches.'
Babcock gave one of his to Wallace
Denny, trainer.
Alex McKinnon, Tom Moss, Bill j
Clitm, and Jack Dales formed the two
mile relay team.
