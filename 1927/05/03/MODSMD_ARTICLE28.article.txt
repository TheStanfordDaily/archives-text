# A 						Stanford Charity

livery man, woman, and child should, if financially able, give some
thing each year towards a recognized charitable home. Stanford is
fortunate in having such an institution on the campus in the form ol the
Convalescent I tome. The money that the students are asked to donate
goes to a purely local, and purely Stanford, charitable cause, and should
therefore appeal to University students.
The students are requested to contribute $5000 toward the fund. If
anything, this sum is too small. Surely not too large. Such a charitable
undertaking deserves the support of Stanford I'niversity, for it is a part
of the University's undertakings, if the students could take a sufficient
interest in the I lome, and actually keep the institution solely through
their own efforts, it would be a college activity unique on this campus.
Men and women of college age can not, as a rule, afford to give to
national charities or relief funds, and besides such campaigns are usually
handled by the folks at home, but the Convalescent Home is Stanford's
own attempt at charity work, and should be treated accordingly.
The Convalescent Home has been established for over seven years,
and during that time, the facilities have been improved, the medical force
has been enlarged, and the success of the charitable work has increased,
but all these improvements have meant an increase in the running
expenses of the institution. Help of all kinds has been given gratis ;
women about the state have made clothing for the children; clubs have
sent toys and magazines; and now the students are asked to do their part
by giving a small donation this week and by working a few hours on
the grounds next week. It may be of interest to know that even the A1 (j.
Barnes circus sends a troup of clowns to the home every year when the
circus visits Palo Alto.
The I lome took care of 209 sick and crippled children during the
year of 1926, and out of this list of invalids all except nineteen showed
improvement before they were released. ()f these nineteen, all but three
were forced to leave the home before the completion of convalescence.
The $5000 that is asked for is so small an amount and for so good a
cause, that the money should be raised promptly.
