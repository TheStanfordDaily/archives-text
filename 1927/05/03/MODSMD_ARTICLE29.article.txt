Sorority rushing at the University of Utah costs the girls $3000 this
year, according to the Utah Chroiiiclc. The newspaper states that the
figure is very conservative, but adds that, in any event, it is a staggering
and criminal amount.
Plenty of unfavorable comment has gone around about the system of
rushing at Stanford both for men and women, but at any rate Stanford's
system is cheap. 'J'he sororities on the campus are not allowed to decorate
their houses in any way during rushing season, and so the only expense
connected with rushing here is the extra money spent for better food
during the week. The girls could eat pheasant every day.and furnish
the freshmen with imported Turk ; sh cigarettes, and still not be able to
spend anywhere near $3000.
As for the men, the increased expense during rushing season at
Stanford is hardly enough to mention. Five or six extra plates can be
added to the house's table for a few additional dollars fx week. Rushing
begins to cost money when entertainment and parties have supplied
for the freshmen's amusement, and such diversions are not allowed at
Stanford.
Returning to Utah, the Daily would like to join with the Utah
Chronicle in saying that an expense of $3000 is certainly staggering and
criminal. For young college people to spend so much of their family's
money (for that is where it comes from) is a crime, and should be
stopped by action of the sororities themselves.
