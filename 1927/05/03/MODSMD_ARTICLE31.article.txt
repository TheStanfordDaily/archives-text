New York college students may eb curbed of all suicidal impulses
by a new and novel preventive. Assemblyman Louis A. Cuvillier, of
New York City, advocates the following state ruling:
"Uniforms of some reasonable material and simple design, prescribed by
the state department of education for all college students, is the best solution
to the suicide problem. Pernicious cliques arising more or less directly from
varying financial conditions have a most depressing effect on the impression
able minds of our youth."
