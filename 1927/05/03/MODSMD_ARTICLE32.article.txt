APRIL FOOLS
An Associated Press dispatch con
tains the information that the editors
of the Daily Princetonian have been
forced to explain editorially that the
story printed in their paper to the ef
fect that Hetty Green had donated ten
million dollars to the university to be
used for the inauguration of co-educa
tion was an April Fool joke. The ex
planation was demanded by the fac
culty after several college papers—in
cluding this one —had treated the
story seriously, and after one man had
altered his plans of sending his son to
Princeton.
This is one of those rare bits of
humor, like the business of informing
a man that a dear relative is dead,
only to tell him a few moments later
that you simply wanted to alarm him.
As a matter of fact, the editors of
the Daily Princetonian are guilty of
rather poor taste, it. takes no particu
lar intelligence to concoct a rather
alarming lie, and to disseminate it
through the press as legitimate news.
Everyone reading it is practically cer
tain to take the thing at its face value.
The result will be —as in this case it
was —to make everyone involved in
the matter appear ridiculous.

INTRAMURAL
The prevailing enthusiasm surround
ing intramural baseball inspires some
editorial comment on an institution
that has come to play a prominent
part in the life of the campus.
Despite the fact that college ath

leties have been made the target for
any amount of criticism, no one has
ever attempted to deny the existence
I of the manifold virtues of intramural
j sports. Intramural athletics, while pre
j serving the spirit of competition, give
i an unusually large percentage of the
| student body an opportunity to par-
I ticipate. Furthermore, the few who do
J not actively participate are so closely
| associated with those who do that they
j feel a sort of personal interest in the
I outcome of the games.
Upon intramural athletics falls a
! large part of the responsibility of
maintaining the equilibrium of the
i rather top-heavy athletic structure
| which has been erected at Stanford, as
i at other universities, in response to
I the insistent demands of the public.
I A large part of the credit for develop
i ing the present system goes to Charles
! W. Davis.
Davis rates as one of those unsung
! heroes. His teams cannot have a con
sistent record of victories since he
coaches both sides. And his chances
of getting a great deal of publicity are
further dimmed by the fact that his
athletes are not usually stars. How
; ever, it should be remarked that in
j the past, two or three years, Davis has
J succeeded in creating a high degree of
interest in intramural sports. His meri
j torious work has resulted in a general
! benefit to the health of the male stu
dent body, and has tended to make
| for friendly relations between the vari
ous living groups of the campus.
