# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
After reading in silence for four
( years the editorials in the Daily. I feel
' privileged to be loud and candid. The
present editorialist, short-sighted and
vacuous even for the Daily, has within
the last week advocated severing ath
letic relationships with U.S.C. and lias
endorsed the capital punishment plan
for violators of the honor pledge sys
tem. Without investigation of, or re
flection upon, the conditions surround
ing Hussey's breach of sportsmanship,
he has attempted to stir up a hard
feeling already too strong against
U.S.C. The heads of the two universi
ties involved are striving to reach a
peaceable understanding despite an
ancient and lamentable enmity. When
everything should be done to clamp
down the lid on the pot of seething
emotions, the editor puts more fire
under it. ft is to be hoped that the
apologies and explanations from U.S.C.
are sufficient show-down for his illiber
ality.
ITis next break is to hit us on a long
sore spot by reminding us that we
have pledged loyally to support (lie
honor system. Well, the rest of Stan
ford and T signed on the dotted line
because we had no choice in the mat
ter. Figuratively, we signed at the
point of a gun, none the less threat
ening because it was administrative
instead of blue steel. 1 do not like
cheating in ex's, but I prefer it to a
compulsory support of a compulsory
honesty. The honor system, in becom
ing an aggressive law, defeats its own
purpose of killing the meaning of
honor. Although honesty is a matter
of individual behaviour and mutual
trust without juridicial action and
without superintendence, the system
now claims a stringent punishment
committee, a forced signature, and a'
vow to tattle. When the professor
leaves the room it is now a mere for
mality, or perhaps a confession of mis
trust as to his adequacy as a police
man; one pair of eyes is dismissed in
order that 100 pairs may scan the!

j rows for a culprit. I cannot see why
! this farce is still called an honor sys
| teni when there is no consideration of
! honor left in it: it is merely a penal
| code with self-appointed officers and
| an expulsion committee. Thus, if I may
! argue by inference, if we were once
| complimented by being treated with
j the respect of an honor system, we are
now being insulted by a frame-up which
| throws into our eyes the dust of an old
' name. The editorialist seems either to
1 be blinded by the terminology of the
I hoax or impervious to insults.
Tlianx for the attention. —E.P.O.
The Editor, Sir:
This morning while walking along
11lie Quad we noticed that the janitors
i were sweeping down tlie swallows'
nests. It seems that the janitor had rcv
l ceived his orders from "headquarters."
Is this consistent with the general
policy of the biology department in
; bird conservation? Of course, it is
j hoped that the birds will nest else
j where, but they will create less trou
ble in the Inner Quad than on the
| eaves of the buildings. This action
! seems very near-sighted and if one
1 may judge from articles printed in
i the Daily it seems that you are in
' sympathy with us, and the swallows.
—We're Indignant,
