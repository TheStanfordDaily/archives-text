# VISIT TO MYSTERY HOUSE OFFERS UNUSUAL SIGHTS
## 
### Hallie Keating 
A visit to the Winchester Mystery
House near Los Gatos is a good jaunt
for a warm spring afternoon. This
rambling jumble of rooms, a memorial
to the superstition and fears of an
eccentric woman, is interesting not
only as a curiosity, but as a warning
lesson to all faddists.
Stairs that make nine turns to rise
eight feet, steps two inches high, doors
that open on blank walls, or on empty
air with sheer drops, meaningless bal
conies, double windows built of optical j
glass, are a few of t.he curiosities. The '
house consists of 160 rooms, so con-1
strutted that, in the trip through, no 1
single room is entered twice. There is !
even a secret passage.
Directed by Spirits
The house was built by Mrs. Win-
Chester, wife of the son of the inven-,
tor of Winchester arms. She was her j
own architect, and believing she was j
directed by departed spirits, planned J
most of the rooms for their comfort, j
Her income of $1000 a day gave her (
plenty of leeway to add all the details ;
that might make them feel quite at j
home.
Building was begun in 1886, and for j
thirty-six years the house was under I
continuous construction. After the j
death of her husband, Mrs. Winches-1
ter maintained a controlling share in j
the Winchester Arms Company. Ter-1
rifled by the responsibility she felt '
she had incurred for the lives of all |
who had died from Winchester wea-!
pons, she consulted a medium in Con
necticut how to soothe her conscience. !
The spiritualist told her that as long;
as she kept building and "hammers!
rapping," she would be "safe from the j
hand of Death."
Lived Alone
Mrs. Winchester came to California, j
and buying the eight-room farmhouse i
that is the nucleus of the whole struc
ture, began her building. She lived j
absolutely alone, but kept a staff of |
about tifty persons continually work-1
ing on the house. Many of the rooms ;
were never finished, although every-j
where are eccentric details, added
simply to take up time and stave off j
her death.
The house is situated about eighteen
miles from Stanford, on the Los Gatos
road. The best way to reach it is by '
the highway to the San Antonio road, j

and down the Stevens Creek road. The
Mystery House is open from D to 6
o'clock every day, and by special ap
pointment to parties over ten, in the
evening. There is a charge of fifty
cents for the trip through the house.
It is advisable to allow about an hour
and a half to have the full amount of
amusement and entertainment.

pons, she consulted a medium in Con
necticut how to soothe her conscience. !
The spiritualist told her that as long;
as she kept building and "hammers!
rapping," she would be "safe from the j
hand of Death."
Lived Alone
Mrs. Winchester came to California, j
and buying the eight-room farmhouse i
that is the nucleus of the whole struc
ture, began her building. She lived j
absolutely alone, but kept a staff of |
about tifty persons continually work-1
ing on the house. Many of the rooms ;
were never finished, although every-j
where are eccentric details, added
simply to take up time and stave off j
her death.
The house is situated about eighteen
miles from Stanford, on the Los Gatos
road. The best way to reach it is by '
the highway to the San Antonio road, j

and down the Stevens Creek road. The
Mystery House is open from D to 6
o'clock every day, and by special ap
pointment to parties over ten, in the
evening. There is a charge of fifty
cents for the trip through the house.
It is advisable to allow about an hour
and a half to have the full amount of
amusement and entertainment.
A visit to the Winchester Mystery
House near Los Gatos is a good jaunt
for a warm spring afternoon. This
rambling jumble of rooms, a memorial
to the superstition and fears of an
eccentric woman, is interesting not
only as a curiosity, but as a warning
lesson to all faddists.
Stairs that make nine turns to rise
eight feet, steps two inches high, doors
that open on blank walls, or on empty
air with sheer drops, meaningless bal
conies, double windows built of optical j
glass, are a few of t.he curiosities. The '
house consists of 160 rooms, so con-1
strutted that, in the trip through, no 1
single room is entered twice. There is !
even a secret passage.
Directed by Spirits
The house was built by Mrs. Win-
Chester, wife of the son of the inven-,
tor of Winchester arms. She was her j
own architect, and believing she was j
directed by departed spirits, planned J
most of the rooms for their comfort, j
Her income of $1000 a day gave her (
plenty of leeway to add all the details ;
that might make them feel quite at j
home.
Building was begun in 1886, and for j
thirty-six years the house was under I
continuous construction. After the j
death of her husband, Mrs. Winches-1
ter maintained a controlling share in j
the Winchester Arms Company. Ter-1
rifled by the responsibility she felt '
she had incurred for the lives of all |
who had died from Winchester wea-!
