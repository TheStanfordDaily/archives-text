### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Tonight, in Brooklyn, N.Y., Young
Stribling of Macon, Georgia, fights
Tommy Loughran of Philadelphia, Pa.
• —for 110 particular reason, that I can
think of. Although he is only 22 years
old, William L. Stribling is one of j
those chaps whose future lies behind ■
him. Having fought at the rate of one '
battle every twelve days for six years, j
he is "burnt out" before most boxers :
have begun to reach their best years. j
He is a fine example of flaming youth !
with the flame put out, and why the
referee didn't put him out of the ring
in his so-called fight with Paul Berlen
bach in New York City last June is
something I never could figure out.
Tommy Loughran is well known as a i
master boxer without a wallop, and as j
the gent who showed those who were j
willing to see, what Demps'ey's true !
condition was at his training camp at ;
Atlantic City before the Tunney fight. !
Tommy boxed rings around William
Harrison Dempsey and made the
movie-champ look very foolish indeed ]
Loughran appeared in a six-rounder |
011 the same card with Jack and Gene,
and finished giving the late Jimmy j
Delaney an artistic trimming before 1
it started to rain. He was one of the I
few things about the whole evening
that wasn't "all wet."
But to get down to the business at 1
hand, the two lads have met twice I
before and Stribling has won both j

times. You heard a lot lately about ;
Tommy Loughran being feared by j
most of the heavyweights and light- j
i heavyweights in the country, and also
j about Young Stribling being a made- i
over fighter since he came under Walk |
! Miller's management. But Walk Miller |
j managed Billy when he put up that j
j sad exhibition against Eddie Huffman j
! in Madison Square Garden not so long j
j ngo, and Loughran has knocked out j
; about four men in the last six years,
J so it shouldn't be a very bloodthirsty
affair.
i guess that Promoter Humbert ;
Fugazy realized that since it was the
first week in May and the Brooklyn
| ball club was playing across the river,
| he'd better stage an outdoor show. Oh !
J well, it probably won't snow, anyway, j

think of. Although he is only 22 years
old, William L. Stribling is one of j
those chaps whose future lies behind ■
him. Having fought at the rate of one '
battle every twelve days for six years, j
he is "burnt out" before most boxers :
have begun to reach their best years. j
He is a fine example of flaming youth !
with the flame put out, and why the
referee didn't put him out of the ring
in his so-called fight with Paul Berlen
bach in New York City last June is
something I never could figure out.
Tommy Loughran is well known as a i
master boxer without a wallop, and as j
the gent who showed those who were j
willing to see, what Demps'ey's true !
condition was at his training camp at ;
Atlantic City before the Tunney fight. !
Tommy boxed rings around William
Harrison Dempsey and made the
movie-champ look very foolish indeed ]
Loughran appeared in a six-rounder |
011 the same card with Jack and Gene,
and finished giving the late Jimmy j
Delaney an artistic trimming before 1
it started to rain. He was one of the I
few things about the whole evening
that wasn't "all wet."
But to get down to the business at 1
hand, the two lads have met twice I
before and Stribling has won both j

times. You heard a lot lately about ;
Tommy Loughran being feared by j
most of the heavyweights and light- j
i heavyweights in the country, and also
j about Young Stribling being a made- i
over fighter since he came under Walk |
! Miller's management. But Walk Miller |
j managed Billy when he put up that j
j sad exhibition against Eddie Huffman j
! in Madison Square Garden not so long j
j ngo, and Loughran has knocked out j
; about four men in the last six years,
J so it shouldn't be a very bloodthirsty
affair.
i guess that Promoter Humbert ;
Fugazy realized that since it was the
first week in May and the Brooklyn
| ball club was playing across the river,
| he'd better stage an outdoor show. Oh !
J well, it probably won't snow, anyway, j
