# UNIVERSITY OF OREGON DEFEATS MEASURE TO CUT PRESS FREEDOM
## 
### 
Freedom of (he press won another
victory recently at the University of
Oregon, when an amendment to shift
editorial control of "The Oregon Daily
Emerald" to a committee appointed
by the Student Council was defeated
by an overwhelming majority of the
student body. The vote was 1329 to
386.
Control of the paper's policy became
an issue when the Daily Emerald pub
lished criticisms of certain actions of
the student body president. In de- 1
tense the president started a campaign
for the measure, just defeated, where
by control of the sheet would fall into
j his own hands.
