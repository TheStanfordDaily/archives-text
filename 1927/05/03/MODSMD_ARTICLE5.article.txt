# BASKETBALL PAVILION TO BE CHANGED INTO MAGIC FOREST FOR JUNIOR PROM
## Cass Requests Third-Year Men to Report This Afternoon To Give Much-Needed Assistance in Decorating 
### 
>TtHE transformation of the Basketball Pavilion into something like an
enchanted forest for the Junior Prom was begun yesterday afternoon by
A1 Cass, chairman of the decorations committee, and such Juniors as turned
out to help him. The work of hanging the different drapes was hardly more
than started, though, because of the great lack of assistance from the
Class of '28.
The canvasses for the walls depict various woodland effects. Between the
trees are giant spiders, giant toadstools, and giant frogs painted in garish
colors. A few feet out from each wall will be a green network with trees

$ silhouetted on it. These are formed
j into arches and will serve to frame the
murals. ,
Flood lights placed between the two
i sets of drops will accentuate these sil
; houettes and will also serve to illu
. minate the paintings.
Waterfall Planned
Directly opposite the entrance and
! behind the orchestra will be a water
-1 fall. It will be made to appear more
, realistic by a ripple-producer which
' will be placed in back of it.
; In view of the great amount of work
which will have to be done, Cass has
requested the help of all Juniors who
' can be at the pavilion either this after
noon or this evening.
The time spent at the pavilion will
not be all work as Anne Hartwell has
: arranged for entertainment and danc
; ing which will be held periodically
throughout the day. Refreshments will
also be served to workers from time to
l time.
