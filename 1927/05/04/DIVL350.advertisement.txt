sJtiCvister Lather
Smoother Shaves
WILLIAMS Shaving Cream works up
fast into a rich bulky lather simply
saturated with moisture. This super-moist,
saturated lather soaks into the heard
bristles until they are completely softened.
That's why there is no razor "pull" with
Williams, why all blades seem sharper.
Williams leaves the face glove-smooth. Two
sizes, 35c and 50c.
