"Still setting the style pace, aren't youl Clad I'm not the parent who pays
and pays and pays.
"Ah, that's the point. It's an Erskine Six and economy is its secret passion.
Don't <udge its cost by its appearance."
SPEAKING frankly, who cares a fig for bore and stroke,
cubic displacement and all of that. The car of today
is the one that slips through traffic like an All-American
halfback wriggles through a broken field; turns on a
dime with nine cents change and pops into a parking
space with a hair's breadth clearance front and rear.
To match the spirit of American youth a motor car must
have "It.""It" is the ability to chase the horizon all
day without panting; smart good looks that do credit
to the intelligence of its owner and riding comfort that
wins a sigh of complete ease.
That's why the Erskine Six Custom Coupe is taking
America's youth by storm. Style conceived in Paris—•
design by Dietrich, the master designer—speed that lets
you decide whether or not the car behind will pass. And,
will it stand up? Studebaker builds it—Q. E.D.
Take possession of an Erskine Six today. Drive it over
roads other cars fear. Forget the gearshift lever. Revise
all your notions of motoring. You're riding in a car
that has set a new pace for others to try and follow.
The Erskine Six Custom Coupe, as illustrated, sells for $qqj 112. o. b. factory,
complete with front and rear bumpers and self-energising 4-wbeel brakes.
