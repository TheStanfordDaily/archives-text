Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president
emeritus of the University of Califor

Credited with being the person most
responsible for the growth of the uni

stitution from 1899 to 1919, when he
was succeeded by Dr. David P. Bar
rows. Dr. Wheeler, who would have
been 73 years old on July 15, rebuilt
the entire structure of California.
He graduated from Brown, taught
at Cornell for thirteen years, and came

Both he and Dr. David Starr Jordan

building up California and Stanford.
Dr. Wheeler won the gratitude of the
Berkeley students when, in 1899, he
called together a committee of repre

ing with an offender of the university
regulations. From this committee grew
the California system of student self
government.
