Phi Sigma Kappa and Kappa Sigma
were winners in the only two intra
mural baseball games played yester
day afternoon, the former winning
from Sigma Alpha Epsilon 9 to 5 and
the latter downing the Alpha Delta
Phi nine 11 to 6. Delta Kappa Epsilon
forfeited to Beta Theta Pi, making the
Betas champipns of their league. The
Military department defaulted to
Alpha Tau Omega in the other sched
uled contest.
Phi Sigs Win
Seven runs scored in the second
inning sewed up the Phi Sigma Kappa-
S.A.E. game for the winners early in
the contest. A home run by Jacobs
and a two-base hit by Smith in this
frame materially helped in making the
Phi Sig total.
Bryant did good work on the mound
for the winners, striking out 15 men.
McKeown fanned six Phi Sig batters,
and received good support from his
teammates in all but the second frame.
Max Stevenson made two sensational
catches from the outfield and Peters
completed a double play unassisted.
Shipkey Hits
Aided by the heavy hitting of Ship
key, who clouted three safe bingles in
three trips to the plate, the Kappa
Sigma nire h d Kttle trouble in down
ing the Alpha Delt nine. Two runs in
each of the first three innings and
five runs in the sixth inning accounted
for the winners' total. Wolf did good
mound work for the Kappa Sigs, and
Dennis, Alpha Delt hurler, made the
longest hit of the game, a three
bagger, in addition to pitching a fair
game.
