# LAKE SPORTS PLANS ALMOST COMPLETED, CHAIRMAN REPORTS
## Swedish Marathon Tryouts Held Daily at Encina Gymnasium Pool 
### 
Plans for the lake sports which will
be held at Lagunita at 10 o'clock 011
Saturday morning are practically com
pleted, announced Robert Harris,
chairman of the committee, last night.
Tryouts for the Swedish marathon
are being held daily in Encina pool.
The four classes have fifteen-man
teams, each member of which swims
fifty yards. Captains for each of the
teams have just been announced; they
are: Bob Williams, seniors; Kryne
van den Akker, juniors; Tom Thur
low, sophomores; and Iteg Harrison,
freshmen.
Trials Open
Anyone who wants to try out is
asked to get in touch with the cap
tain of his class team or to go to the
swimming pool this afternoon and have
himself timed for a length of the tank.
The cross-lake swim, the only other
swimming event on the program, is
the first race on the program. The race
starts at the far side of the lake and
ends at the boathouse, a distance of
about 455 yards. Carl Stevenson, last
year's winner, is favored in this event
again. He will probably be closely
pressed by Van den Akker, Harrison
and Driggs. University medals will be
presented to the first three men to
reach the boathouse.
Entries Come Fast
Entries are coming in fast for the
canoe races and tilts. About fifteen
pairs of men are entered for each. The
race will be over a triangular course
around the lake, while the tilts will
be held in heats with the losers elimi
nated each time. Merchandise prizes
will be presented to the winners of
both. These are being donated by Palo
Alto merchants.
Dave Fall, Olympic games diver,
will appear in a number of exhibition
dives from the board at the boathouse.
He will be assisted by Walt Mills,
varsity diver, and Ed Throndson of
this year's frosh.
Between the events Delmar Daves
will put on some skits which he guar
antees are new and different.
