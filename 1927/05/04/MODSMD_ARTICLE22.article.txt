family," declared Dr. S. J. llolmes, of the University of California, an authority
on eugenics and social control, last night in the Little Theatre.
"Human ability varies enormously; there are few geniuses and few morons.
In between lies the great bulk of humanity whose character traits follow
fairly definitely the laws of segregation and combination of factors formulated
