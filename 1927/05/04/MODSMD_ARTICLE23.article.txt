to get away from the formal work, and
emphasize the less formal that will
carry over into after college life.
Stress is put on horseback riding, golf,
and swimming, instead of the organ
ized games and Swedish gymnastics.
"Danish gymnastics, allowing more
freedom and individuality, replace the
Swedish at Wisconsin. Everywhere
there is a tendency toward less for

merely shows that people are keeping

"Before this spirit has much effect
on Stanford, the public, not the stu
dents, must be educated to it."
