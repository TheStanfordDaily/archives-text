# DEBATE ON PRESENT STYLES TO BE HELD
## 
### 
Were the sweeping, full skirts, the
leg-of-mutton sleeves, and the jaunty
sailor hats measuring six feet from
wing to wing, of twenty-five years ago
more appropriate than the brief and
abbreviated skirts, the rolled hose,
and the bobbed hair of today?
The "Pacific Weekly" of the College
of the Pacific and the "Student Life"
of Pomona College will shortly engage
in a journalistic debate on this and
kindred subjects. The question pro
posed by the "Pacific Weekly" reads,
"Resolved: That the styles of the
ladies' dress of twenty-five years ago
wore more appropriate than the mod
ern, up-to-date styles."
