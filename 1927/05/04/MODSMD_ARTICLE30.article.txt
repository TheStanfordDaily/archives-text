Benjamin kle Wheeler, one of California's greatest educators, died
yesterday. University of California mourns its loss and Stanford grieves
with her sister university.
David Starr Jordan makes the following statement:
"I was much shocked to hear of the death of my old friend and
colleague in education, Benjamin I. Wheeler. Me was a man of broad
and accurate scholarship, well versed in the knowledge of what a uni
versity ought to be and capable in all administrative matters. The present
high standing of the University of California is due mainly to his wisdom
and tact in the choice of associates."
President Kay Lyman Wilbur's statement follows:
"Benjamin Ide Wheeler was one of the outstanding figures in the
university education of America during the period of rapid increase in
the number of students and in the resources of the universities. He
found in California a suitable field for his unique talents. Although
brought up in the East and in the classical school of thought, he readily
accommodated himself to a new and virile civilization, meeting the prac
tical problems associated with the development of a new commonwealth.
"His capacity for leadership and for adjustment was so great that
within a few years of his arrival in the state he was looked upon as one
of the leading Californians. Much of the striking advance made by the
University of California has been due to him. His determined interest
in the present building plan, which has made the University of California
one of the most attractive campuses in the world, is illustrative of the
type of service which he rendered the university.
"Stanford University joins with the University of California in ad
miration of the great service rendered by President Wheeler to education
and to the state of California."
