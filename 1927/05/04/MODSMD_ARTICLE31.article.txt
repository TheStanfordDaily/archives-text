# Honor the System
## 
### 
In the Campus Opinion column yesterday Mr. E. P. O. criticized the
Daily for its stand on the honor system, and from the criticism we
gather that our stand on the whole matter is misunderstood by the writer.
The Daily maintains that, as long as there is a pledge to which every
student signs his or her name on registration day, the enforcement of the
rule should be more exacting. The Daily did not mention whether it
believed the pledge itself was a good thing or not, and therefore Mr. O.
is attacking the wrong person.
The honor system should not have to be maintained by a forced
pledge, for that action does away with the spirit of the system. The
observance of an honor system should be a matter of ethics, wherein
each student would be "on his own." No student refuses now to sign
the pledge even should he intend to cheat in his studies. But realizing
that all Stanford students have signed on the dotted line, the rule should
not be ignored. No law should be left a dead letter. It should be either
enforced or repealed. The Daily feels that the Men's Council did the
only right thing in tightening up on their policy. If it is found that the
rule cannot or should not be enforced then the next step is to repeal the
ruling.
The honor system is now only partially enforced. That is, the large
majority of Stanford students, it is safe to say, would be highly indignant
if they were told they do not support and comply with the honor system,
but, nevertheless, these same students do not report infractions of the
rules when they see them committed. They do not cheat themselves, but
they allow their next-door neighbor to violate the honor system without
uttering a word.
The honor system should be supported; it should be wholly complied
with; and it should be observed without a forced pledge.
