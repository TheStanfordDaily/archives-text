# No Note-Taking Allowed

### 
Students in Professor S. E. Harris' course in Money and Banking
at Cornell University are not allowed to take notes. At the suggestion of
their instructor the members of the class are spending all their time in
the classroom assimilating the lectures and discussions.
The plan should he a success if the professor has the personality to
hold the attention of his students. It is merely an attempt to arouse the
interests of young men and women on educational subjects without the
inducement of marks. When a plan has been arranged whereby students
will work and study a course for the information connected with the
subject, the present system of marking will probably disappear to make
room for a more intelligent way of conducting university courses. Pro
fessor Harris' plan may be just the system that educators have been
looking for.
The Cornell newspaper comments upon the new plan as follows:
"Under this plan the students are obliged to pay strict attention if they
are to gain the substance of the work and at the same time have the
added advantage of being able to think about certain questions. Continu
ous note-taking is not conducive to intelligent thought. If professors and
colleges hope to promote intelligent thought among the undergraduates
they may do well to try this plan."
The Cornell Daily Sun explains that the experiment should do away
with the necessity of cramming for final examinations, which is one of
the evils of the present-day system of college education.
