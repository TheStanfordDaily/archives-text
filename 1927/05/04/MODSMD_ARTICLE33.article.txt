"The basketball pavilion," claims a
recent Daily headline, is "to be
changed into a magic forest for the
Junior Prom."
In all due respect to the designers
of the decorations for this annual and
mammoth social event, may we be
permitted to doubt this. What will
really happen to the basketball pa
vilion is that it will be literally cov
ever with miles of gauze or crepe
paper or papier mach6 and when the
job is all done it will look exactly
like a basketball pavilion covered with
miles of gauze or crepe paper or
papier mach6. However, in all due
frankness, we have never seen a magic
forest, and for all we know a magic
forest may' look like a basketball
pavilion covered with that sort of
thing with which they cover basket
ball pavilions for junior proms.
And anyhow the point to writing all
of this was to ask everyone in the

— vm 1
' junior class to turn out and help poor
old A1 Cass, who is having the very
devil of a time turning the basketball
: pavilion into a magic forest all by
j himself.
* * /*
A MATTER OF TIME
I With the return of Dean Culver from
; the conference of Deans of Men the
information is received that honor
systems are rather bogging down all
over the country.
So long as the topic has thus been
brought to attention, it might be well
to note that the Stanford honor sys
tem has begun to go to the dogs. The
decay of the honor system dates from
the time that that ludicrous oath was
embodied in the registration book.
J With every student in the University
I forced to submit to the insult implied
in the requirement of signing that
oath, it is only a matter of time until
, the honor system is abolished here as
|it lias already been abolished else
