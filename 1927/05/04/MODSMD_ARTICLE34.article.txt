"THE LAST OF MRS. CHEYNEY"
at the Columbia. The world's
famous crook comedy featuring
Ina Claire. A hit in New York
for years.
"THE FIREBRAND" at the Wilkes.
A rampant and witty comedy of
the danger days of Florence. A
preat cast consisting of lan Keith,
William Farnum, and Ethel Clay
ton.
"THE JUDGE'S HUSBAND" at the
Curran. William Hodge scores a
great success in a coundedly
funny comedy. The play has been
mounted and cast well and
Hodge's dominating acting leaves
little for discussion.
"LAFF THAT OFF" at the Presi
dent. The third mirthful week of
a real farce. There is little to
add, at this moment, to the ear
lier reports of its success.
"THE PATSY" at the Alcazar. Sel
dom is there a chance to offer for
approval a more delightful farce.
Henry Duffy returns to the foot
lights and along with Dale Win
ter makes the show.

Ina Claire, still not unwilling to
wear an exquisite pajama ensemble
along toward the middle of the play,
still making that characteristic fur
tive gesture toward her back hair, and
more than ever the consummate com
medienne, shading the stop and go
signals of restraint and abandon into
the march of full-flavored comedy, is
Mrs. Cheyney. She it is who rings the
bell in the great house in the middle
of the night and thereby calls the bluff
of the man who has seen her make a
pass for the pearls and thinks this is
only the beginning.
Roland Young, with that same con
trol of the contemplative epigram that
distinguished him in "The Beggar on
Horseback," is Lord Arthur Dilling.
And his ways with women are reputed
to make a modern Francois Villon en
vious. The reputation doesn't much
disturb him. Good men, he grants, may
be valuable as husbands, "but I've
noticed that the co-respondents are
always bad men."
He meets Mrs. Cheyney, the ambigu
ous widow who says she comes from
Australia, and he tells her he likes
her. She reminds him that when a man
declares a woman is liked, it is a
slander equivalent to alleging her un
derclothes are made of linoleum. He
changes the phrase and swears he
loves her. Presently he does.
Then, after the pajamas and pearls
and bell-ringing, Lord Dilling erases
his silhouette of a blackguard, as they
have called him, by waking up an Eng
lish bishop long before breakfast time,
to make a date with the prelate at a
convenient church that he, Lord Dil
ling, may marry Mrs. Cheyney, who
came from Bloomsbury, not Australia.
Brittle and freighted with epigrams
which you hope you will remember be
fore the other folks at the dinner party
get to the show, the play is spined up
with a whole vertebral system of melo
dramatic incidents, each a tingling
nerve-center of interest. Well-bred
melodrama, to be sure, but vital and
vivid.
One of those nerve centers is Lord
Elton, who, himself, probably hasn't
a nerve-cell in his body, or his soul.
Just before she goes after the jewels
Mrs. Cheyney receives from the lord a
proposal of marriage. It's the first he
has ever made. Accordingly he com
poses a letter, the movie rights of

; which ought to be considerable. He
adds a postscript in which he gives a
snappy and unlordlike summary of the
characters of the other guests at the
house party.
So when Mrs. Cheyney rings the bell
and hands over the pearls the whole
house party begs the girl not to go to
jail and have the letter read in a nasty
democratic police court. For the sake
of England's aristocracy, they implore
| her to take some money, go back to
Australia, and give them leave to dis
miss the policeman.
She takes the check and tears it up.
