Lawrence. George Doran Co.
"Wonderful," is the word that has
i been most applied to this book by
| those critics and readers who have
I had the privilege of seeing in its vari-
I ous incarnations, from the original
\ text entitled "The Seven Pillars of
; Wisdom" to this American abridged
J edition of 335 pages, 16 illustrations,
! and a map.
It is perhaps the only English word
that will apply with anything like
verity either to the book or to the
author. For great literature as the
book undoubtedly is, its author evi
dently was greater. Any young man
of 28, frail in body and poor in purse,
| who could so take unto himself the
! ordering of destiny and the fate of a
| nomad nation as Lawrence did, de
serves to have some poet celebrate his
| deeds in a great modern epic. Law
rence, however, chose to be his own
minstrel. Thus we have this splendid
saga of the desert, which perhaps in
days to come will take the place with
Anabasis of Xenophon and other im
mortal records of warfare.
They say Lawrence, under the name
' of El Ourens, is already a legend
among the Bedouin Arabs. He bids
fair to become one in the English
; speaking world. His is a book of heroic
deeds: how he won the support of the
famous Emir Feisal at their first meet
ing; how he donned Arab dress and
directed the exploits of the revolt of
many tribes; how he composed dif
ferences between chieftains and kept
blood feuds quiet to further the vic
tory over the Turk; how he rode on
his camel Wodheiha over leagues of
scorching plain into freezing valleys;
how he pushed through to Damascus
and triumph at last and thus founded
a nation —all these things he tells with
a simplicity and poetic vigor that
! mark him the true genius—a Caesar in
Barbaric head-dress, a Napeleon of the

Nomads.
What was the secret of his success?
Undoubtedly, if you take this book
for testimony, a courage and resource
that never failed him; and secondly,
an understanding of men that amount
ed to genius. He was the natural cap
tain, the peerless leader.
The book blazes with all the bar
baric sheen of the sun on the desert
sands and spires of flint; it rings with
the wild shouts of Arab cavalry flying
to the charge; then it becomes melo
dious with the low music of the wind
in the shady siestas under the tent
or overhanging rock—or perhaps un
der the steady brilliance of the desert
stars. Here is indeed the true exam
ple of Victor Hugo's classic of criti
cism: "The style is the man."
El Ourens, wrecker of engines and
uncrowned king of the desert, has no
need to strain after effects. He lived
poetry. All he had to" do was to set it
down. His book is himself. —E.L.S.
