# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Babe seems to be a popular nick
name for baseball players. Besides the
great clouter of circuit crashes, his
Homeric Highness, Babe Ruth, there
are three other "Bambinos" who have
been connected with the national pas
time recently. I refer to Babe Adams,
late of Pittsburgh; Babe Pinelli, third
man of the Reds; and Babe Herman,
sometime first-sacker of the Brooklyn
Dodgers.
Let me say iij the first place that
this Babe Herman is no relation to
the prize-fighter of that name, who
was recently "knocked out" by Sid
Terris. Babe Herman, of the ring, hap
pens to be a featherweight and an
Italian, while Babe Herman of the
Rollicking Robins is a heavyweight
and as American as can be. And the
last-named Babe has a wallop that is
many times more potent than the
boxer, who almost won the world's
featherweight from Kid Kaplan in
Connecticut back in 1925.
It is Herman's hitting ability that
won him a job at first base on the
Brooklyn team, and it is in all proba
bility his heavy stick work that caused
the fans to dub him with the same
nickname made famous by the great-

I est of liome run hitters. Last year, 111
| 137 games, Babe Herman hatted .319,
not at all bad for a rookie, and in
: eluded among his bingles were 35 dou
bles, 11 triples, and 11 homers. Babe's
field was not of the best in 1926 —his
1 average being .985 in 100 games at
; first and .955 in 36 games in the out-
I field —but he batted in 81 runs, which
I
1 placed him eighth in the league's list
of slugging percentages.
, 1 have read that Herman won some
sort of a prize in high school for bril
liance, yet his play at first sometimes
makes that fact hard to believe. His
1 "daily error" was a feature of the
Robins' spring training season for
' awhile, and in one game recently he
! made the horrible slip of forgetting to
touch first when he had an easy put
j out waiting.
The Babe was born in Buffalo in
; 1903, and moved to California at the
1 age of two. Under the influence of the
w.k. climate he grew up to be six
feet, four inches tall, and distinguished
himself on the gridiron. Sometimes
Uncle Robbie thinks that Herman was
tapped a bit too roughly on the dome
in one of the football games he took
part in. Then Babe comes through
with a timely hit and all is forgiven.
