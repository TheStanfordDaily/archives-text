# ARRANGEMENTS MADE TO INCREASE SIZE OF PASADENA ROSE BOWL
## 
### 
Changing the present "horseshoe" |
shape of the Rose Bowl at Pasadena
into a completely closed stadium, the
seating capacity of the howl will be !
increased from 52,400 to 76.0Q0, Harry j
M. Ticknor, president of the Tourna- [
ment of Roses Association announced '
recently. Plans for the work have
taken definite form, and the contract
will soon be let.
It is estimated that the addition to j
the stadium will cost approximately I
$150,000. Hopes are held that the job |
may be completed in time for the 1928
New Year's classic. The new seats will
be constructed in the open end on the
"horseshoe."
To help finance the project, the as
sociation plans to sell five-year per- i
manent seats to the New Year's Day j
games to the extent of $50,000. The j
addition is necessary, the association
declares, to care for the immense
crowds that apply each year for tick
ets. Last year more than $150,000 had !
to be returned to applicants unable to i
be cared for in the demand for seats j
to the Stanford-Alabama game.
