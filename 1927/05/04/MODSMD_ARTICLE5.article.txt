# MOVIE THRILLS FOUND IN "WICKED WILLIAM" PLOT
## 
### John Rogers 
All the glamor and unexpectedness
of a moving picture studio, as well as
rare comedy and a startling ending,
are contained in the third act of
"Wicked William." The scene is laid
in the Eastern studio of Bulwar Bucho
witz, who is directing the super
classis-jewel, "Women I Have Known,"
and he is assisted by a cumbersome
staff of stars, yes-men, and clumsy
extras.
Buehowitz is played by Alfred Hurt,
a freshman who made nis first appear
ance in Stanford dramatics last quar
ter in "A Kiss for Cinderella." The
director is overflowing with uncon
trollable temperament which he lav
ishes on his associates to a disgusting
degree. Like the two counts, who have
risen to astounding positions in his
employment, it is suspected that his
so-foreign accent and attitude were
acquired after he left New York's
Bowery.
Cooper, Powell Cast
The two artistic and exotic leads of
the cinema triumph are Flora de
Fauna, imported Hungarian beauty,

and John Beaumont, played by Helen
Cooper of John Ferguson fame, and
Powell Carpenter, new to the campus
stage. Artistic temperament of these
two screen actors hopelessly involve
the pair in their situations under the
Kleig lights and add to the comedy
of the final act.
Jones, Buchowitz's leading yes-man,
is taken by Robert Keerl, who had a
part in "The Green Goddess." Jones,
assisted by a clamorous chorus, just
about wears out that one word of the
English language as he agrees with
his director with vim, vigor, and
vitality.
Sets Technically Correct
This is the first Junior Opera that
has ever been laid in a moving picture
studio, and Leslie Kiler has spent a
great deal of effort to make the scene
technically correct. The stage is bare
except for one part, of any organized
scenery, and the rest of it is cluttered
up with cameras, weird ligtlis, yes
men, and beautiful girls, so natural
that all the people from Hollywood
are going to feel at home as soon as
the curtain rises.
