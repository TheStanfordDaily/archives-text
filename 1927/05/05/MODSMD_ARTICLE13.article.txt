# JAZZY LYRICS NUMEROUS IN JUNIOR OPERA MUSIC
## 
### John Rogers 
With music and lyrics as modern
and excellent as the dramatic lines of
the opera, "Wicked William," prom
ises to be one of the few musical
comedies of the Stanford stage that
has ever been worthy of metropolitan
comparison. The quality of the songs
is uniformly high, and the kinds used
in the comedy range all the way from
a "blue" number to a sophisticated
tango.
Although many contributions were
received for the musical score, in its
finished condition it is chiefly the
work of Jean Wakefield and Jack
Wiggin, two campus composers who
have written popular successes of pre
vious Stanford vaudevilles and musi
cal comedies.
The orchestration for the twelve
piece orchestra, that has been prac
ticing under Gordon Hall, musical di
rector of the show, was done by Emil
Breitenfeld, who arranges for Rube
Wolf's orchestra. Because the pianist
originally engaged for the Junior
Opera is unable to play for the per
formance Saturday night, Hall will
fill in at the piano, with Wiggin sub
stituting as conductor. The change
made just recently, as no one was
able to learn the piano scores in the
short time. Wiggin has had much pre
vious experience in this line, as he
was musical director of the produc
tions of 1925-26.

Miss Wakefield has composed two
! masterpieces of jazz: "We Called It
Love" and "Brand New Man." The
former is written in tango rhythm and
is such a fine piece of work that it
deserves its place as the theme song.
A new note is struck in this number
1 as it is completely removed from the
ordinary tango ballad and is built
: around a striking harmonic scheme.
Kathleen Fitz sings "Brand New
Man," and the combination of her
voice and the piece will probably make
it the senstation of the show; even
1 more of a riot than "Mama's Goin'
Bye-bye," Miss Wakefield's hit of the
Football Show that even the master
of syncopation, Paul Whiteman,
praised.
One-Step Used
Wiggin has composed the title song.
One would never guess it, but it's
called "Wicked William." With its
companion piece, "Up in an Attic,"
the two mark a return to the fast
moving one-step, which keeps the
: choruses going, and going fast. This
! is the first time for some years that
) a one-step has been used in a campus
production.
The choruses and cast have been
strenuously rehearsing their songs
and dances for the past several weeks,
until everything is at last running
smoothly, and only tcniglit and to
i morrow are left to polish up the few
. rough edges that remain.
