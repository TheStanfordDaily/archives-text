# SWEDISH MARATHON BIG EVENT OF LAKE SPORTS FESTIVITIES
## New Ruling Made to Allow Contestant to Swim Only One Lap 
### 
The outstanding event on the program
of the lake sports carnival, which will
be held at 10 o'clock this Saturday morn
ing as part of the Junior Week festivi
ties, will be the Swedish marathon. This
is a fifteen-man relay race in which each
member of the squad swims fifty yards.
A new ruling has been made for the
j event this year, by which each contestant
will be allowed to swim only one lap.
This will do away with the old practice
of having a six or' seven-man team and
have each member of it swim three or
four times.
Although the freshmen and seniors
seem to have almost enough men to make
up a team, recruits for the second- and
j third-year teams are sadly lacking. The
I juniors won the event last year but
unless more men turn out they will stand
very little chance in the coming relay.
The canoe races and tilts have few
entries as yet, but more are expected be
fore the time for them arrives. Those
desiring to participate may sign up on a
i sheet posted at the boathouse. The races
I will be around the lake over a triangular
course.
The tilts will be fought out with twelve
foot poles. All men in the University are
eligible to enter. Bob Harris, who will
be in charge of the sports, is arranging
for merchandise orders from various
places in Palo Alto which will be given
out as prizes.
The cross-lake swim is always an in
teresting event and with such stars as
i Carl Stevenson, Krytie Van den Akker,
land Reg Harrison entered should prove
I to be a very close race.
j Diving exhibitions by Dave Fall, Walt
' Mills, and Ed Throndsen and stunts by
J Del Daves will complete the program.
