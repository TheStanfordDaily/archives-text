# WORK ON DRAPES FOR PROM DECORATION IS MOVING FASTER-CASS
## 
### 
The hanging of the decorations for the
Junior Prom in the Basketball Pavilion
is proceeding at a very encouraging rate,
announced A1 Cass yesterday. The large
numbers of men who turned out yesterday
i afternoon and night made this unexpected
i speed possible.
There is still no time to slack up on
the rate set as many things remain un
finished. The drapes are nearly all hung
on the walls and the ceiling is completed.
Much remains to be done to put the floor
J in proper shape, and a great deal of fur
niture must be brought from the neigh
boring halls.
All men of the class of '28 who can
be at the pavilion today are requested to
be there, particularly if they have not as
yet done any work,
