# 1927 QUAD WILL HAVE NEWS PICTURES FROM I.C. 4-A. EVENTS
## 
### 
Although the 1.C.4-A track meet will be
held fully a week after the 1927 Quad
goes to the binders, a page describing the
event and illustrated with actual photo
graphs will be inserted in the Annual at
that late date. If it is found that air
planes cannot rush the pictures to San
Francisco in time for the work, they
will be transmitted by wire from the
East.
Part of the Year Book went to the
printers Tuesday, and for the remainder
of the week different sections of the pub
lication will be sent. It is scheduled to be
off the press by May 20, and will imme
diately be delivered to the binders.
If everything moves forward without
a hitch, subscribers will receive the Quad
on June 5, says Bob Paradise, business
anager. The circulation this year is 2,300,
which far excels any previous record, and
the average subscription, two out of every
three studentsâ€”is the highest of any
college annual in the country.
