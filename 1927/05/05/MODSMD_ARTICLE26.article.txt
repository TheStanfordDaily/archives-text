# The 						Younger Generation

### 
When the llnited Feature Syndicate recently proposed to buy and I
publish a series of articles by student writers telling what their generation !
is alleged to be thinking, thc*half-baked editorialists of the country im
mediately rushed to their typewriters and ground out miscellaneous state
ments to the effect that this was another laudable evidence of the growing
public interest in the affairs of youth.
As a matter of fact, the public at large, and least of all the daily press,
lias a very slight interest indeed in what the younger generation is really
thinking. It may be said that the amount of space the daily press devotes
to individual members of the younger generation is in inverse ratio to
the amount of serious thought of which they are capable.
Let a member of the younger generation make a perfect ass of
himself and the press will spread his exploits over any number of col
umns. But let him live his life intelligently and moderately and he will
never break into print. This statement may be enlarged to cover indi
viduals of whatever generation, but it applies in particular to young
people because of their exceptional capacity for doing something out of
the ordinary.
Possibly the United Feature Syndicate is interested in what the youth
of today is thinking, and possibly the result of the request for articles will
be the dessemination through the national press of the best thought of
which that generation is capable. However, it is a great deal more prob
able that the United Feature Syndicate is interested in exploiting the
reputation that this generation has acquired for a certain liberality in its
attitude. And it is quite probable that the articles published will have
nothing in them of what real thought is going on in the younger genera
tion. Instead they will endeavor to satisfy the public's craving for the
details of the presumably hell-bent youth of 1927.
