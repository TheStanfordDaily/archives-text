Ohio University students are being perfected in the art of war of the
primitive type when nothing but fists were available. Last week more than
400 students fought in the streets of Athens. The affair started when
freshmen rebelled against being ducked and 200 of them held their own
after ducking an equal number of sophomores. In the course of the
flight one student received injuries which resulted in concussion of the
brain while another received a broken bone in his face.
This is the type of amusement that is fast disappearing from the
modern universities in this country. This is the type of amusement that
has already been bttricd at Stanford, never to rise again.
The very fact that the methods used by the rioting Ohio students are
so obviously primitive is enough to put a ban on such fights. They
couldn't get to first base in a riot in the streets of Chicago. If students
are to be educated in warfare, why not teach the modern methods of the
game and furnish the men with rifles, and grenades, and poison gases?
