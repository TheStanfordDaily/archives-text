No criticism of the United States was allowed at the recent meeting
of the University of Washington Students' Emergency Committee for
Peace with China. This ruling was made by the Washington faculty. The
faculty decree specified that no Chinese student would be allowed to criti
cize the American policy in China, and in fact, no criticism of any type
was allowed, by any student, of any nationality.
It gives one a feeling of great confidence to realize that the United
States is perfect in its every act, and is at all times above rcproach. What
good a meeting of the type that was held at Washington University could
possibly do, is more than can be figured out. Without criticism, the meet
ing must have been a total loss. The members of the committee no doubt
stood in a great circle, slapped each other on the back, sang the Star
Spangled Banner, and then adjourned.
