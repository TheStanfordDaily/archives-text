It is coming to pass that a day's news
seems incomplete unless some erudite
graybeard bursts into print with an ex
pression of opinion on the younger gen
eraiton. lie opens his remarks by claim
ing either that the youth of the land are
going to hell or that they are not. And
then he elaborates his theme with a col
umn or so of piffle in which lie gets into
specific details.
The flappers are showing their knees,
he says, because they have learned of the
beneficial effect of the ultra-violet solar
rays, or they are doing it to lure a butter
and-egg man into saying something suf
ficiently incriminating to furnish grounds
for a breach of promise suit. In the
same way, the adolescent males of this
broad country are said to be drinking
more or less than their ancestors and
are holding it better or worse.
When one comes right down to it, is
there anyone who is really qualified to
tell us who constitutes this younger gen
eration, and if there is can he tell us
whether or not it is collectively en route
to the bow-wows ? And it might be added,
if so, how?
So far as a personal opinion on the
younger generation is concerned we would
prefer not to voice one. This decision is
reached largely because we consider the

I younger generation a less interesting phe
i nomena than the aforementioned erudite
| graybeard who expresses his opinion upon
! the said younger generation.
As a matter of fact, the younger gen
| eration itself presents a normal psycho-
I logical situation, whereas the erudite
graybeard is an abnormal and consc
; quently more interesting phenomenon. He
is an old man, deprived of the fire and
1 enthusiasm of youth—yet, by virtue of
a public demand, faced with the responsi
! bility of commenting upon the matter—
finding himself in the unusual position of
a presumed authority upon a matter of
which he knows very little indeed. For,
j when one comes right down to it, what
' can a graybeard (however erudite) know
j of the reasons for which a flapper exposes
j her knees, or of the amount of liquor
consumed by a drug-store cowboy or the
| manner in which lie holds it?
In short, we are growing immensely
tired of repeatedly hearing the erudite
jgraybeards of the land expressing them
; selves in public on this matter of which
| they (of all people) are least qualified to
I know anything. And we voice the fer
i vent hope* that the general public will use
! the powerful instrument of its own bore
dom to throttle these particularly per
nicious pests.
