William Hodge in "The Judge's Hus-1
band" coming to Curran Theater.
Throughout the East and Mid-West a I
season of playgoing is scarcely a season I
at ail unless the popular star and ex
ponent of cheerfulness, William Hodge,
comes along with a comedy from his
own pen and to which lie lends his dis
tinctive acting method. The star will
appeared in San Francisco for the first
time since his unforgettable "The Man
from Home" when he opened a brief en
gagement at the Curran Theater Monday
night of this week in his latest Eastern
comedy success, "The Judge's Husband."
The timely play presents the inimitable
actor in a role that permits him to sparkle
at his best—a part that has all the easy
going, whimsical, droll, and witty charac
teristics of Mr. Hodge's personality. New

York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and
other large Eastern cities have heartily
received Mr. Hodge's laugh-provoking ve
hicle and pronounced it "easily the best of
all the Hodge plays"—to use the words
of the New York Sun.
The comedy has perhaps the most
unique courtroom scene in the annals of
i stage trials—a scene wherein a woman
ljudge presides over and is also a witness
I in her own divorce case. Charming Glad
| ys Hanson is Mr. Hodge's leading woman
| and in her experienced hands is the role
j of the judge. Among others in the origi
! nal New York cast to be seen at the Cur
; ran, are Ruth Lyons, Dorothy Walters,
! Marie Haynes, Richard Gordon, Philip
| Rhodes Thorn, Mark Sullivan, Jessie
j Crommette, Francesca Hill, and Betty
! Webb.
