The Editor, Sir:
I heartily agree with "We're Indignant"
in his note in today's Daily, and I'm glad
to sec that he apparently represents more
than one person. 1 would like to know
just where that janitor gets his authority,
il any, and why. For my part, I cer
tainly fail to sec the point for the ob
jection to the cliff swallows constructing
their interesting little "adobe" homes
along the caves of the Inner Quad.
Now I ask you—suppose you were a
representative of Pctrochelidon Lunifrons
(and you really have to be somebody to
get a name like that), had traveled all
the way from South America, Central
America, and way points, up to Stanford
University, and had decided to honor the
students, faculty, and others (excepting
janitors) by stopping and nesting once
again in the very heart of that college—
in the Inner Quad. And then after you
had been extremely busy for two or three
weeks carrying wet mud for the basic

I construction material clear from the road
| over at the corner of the Chemistry
building, where the lawn sprinklers had
! left little puddles of water, back to the
I eaves of the Inner Quad where the pains
' taking business of nest building was pro
! cceding apace—then to discover suddenly
i one morning that a frowsy janitor with
| a long pole was knocking down all the
| half-built nests and even crippling some
j of your friends—would you think it was
| very nice? Now I ask you.
Remember how their nests were all
! numbered and so carefully observed last
j spring by the ornithology class ? And
| now this reception this spring 1 Professor
j Snyder and his class in Zoology 2 should
i have something to say.
Yours truly,
