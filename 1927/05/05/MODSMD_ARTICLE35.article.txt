"Every collcge man should have an
athletic hobby," declares Professor Frank
L. Klceberger, head of the department of
physical education at the University of
California. "No student can study all
day, and sports offer the necessary adven
ture after hard study."
Besides the benefits of a practical edu
cation in athletics, Professor Klceberger
points to the development of social values.
"The generous and courageous good
sportsmanship which is its aim, is put
into every athletic attempt. The man is
taught square dealing, honesty, persist
ence. He is not only shown how to en
dure but also how to come back.
"Then there is an influence exerted on
the cleanliness of his life," lie Concludes.
"Men sec immediately how essential the
proper control of food, drink, and hours
is to their ability to succeed in any com
petition, mental as well as physical."
