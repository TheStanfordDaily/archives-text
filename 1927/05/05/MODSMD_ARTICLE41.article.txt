# STANFORD WILL ABOLISH LOWER DIVISION WORK WILBUR SAYS TIME FOR CHANGING IS PAST PRESIDENT SAYS "TRAIN HAS ALREADY GONE BY"

### Milton Silverman 
Stanford will carry out its plan for
abolition of the lower division. The
program is definitely established, and
work will begin to carry it to com
pletion.
"It is too late to get excited about
it," said President Wilbur, speaking
before the Education Club on the
campus Sunday night. "The train has
already gone by."
More Men Eligible
"For those who are concerned over
fears for losses in the athletic field, I
wish to call attention to the fact that
there will be more men eligible for
athletics under the new plan than
before. Under the present system,
many men are barred for the first one
or two years. Under the new plan, all
of our students will be eligible for
these activities. We shall have more
men than ever before.
"Athletics are based upon the old

institutions of the fighter and the
hunter. Athletics are not transient;
they are permanent. They are here to
remain and must be recognized.
"Fraternities go back to the old
group organizations of the savage
days. They will survive under the new
system if they are, indeed, men's or
ganizations, and will live with re
newed vitality in the atmosphere of
a real university."
Conceived Idea
Dr. Wilbur said that he had con
ceived the idea of the change when
he was dean of the medical school in
1909, and had further developed it
when he became president of the Uni
versity in 1915.
Pointing out that the new plan has
already been given serious considera
tion in other institutions, Professor
John P. Mitchell, University Regis
trar, who has recently returned from
an Eastern trip, stated that Johns Hop

kins University has definitely signified
its intention to abolish the lower divi
sion. Many other colleges have shown j
considerable interest in the change, j
but Johns Hopkins is the only one to j
take any definite steps.
Since it would not be necessary to ;
decrease the total enrollment in the
university, Mitchell remarked, athletic
coaches would have 2500 men from
whom to pick their teams, instead of
only 2000. The only serious change
would be the dropping of freshman
sports.
Statistics Given
The registrar answered the criticism
of many alumni in regard to the poor
scholastic qualifications of graduates
of junior colleges when he cited the
statistics that had been taken over a
period from September 1923 to June
192 G. A comparison of the ability of
graduates of junior colleges, with that
of those who entered the upper divi
sion from other institutions, and with
those who advanced from the regular
freshman and sophomore years at
Stanford, shows definitely the superi
ority of the first group.
A comparison of actual achievement
in the University showed that the
junior college entrants furnished a
larger proportion of students with
superior records than the native Stan
ford group.
All of these findings with reference
to actual achievement, however, are
tentative, and incomplete, since they
are based only on the records of the
junior year. A study of the same stu
dents in their senior year is planned
for next year.
Stanford will carry out its plan for
abolition of the lower division. The

work will begin to carry it to com

system if they are, indeed, men's or
ganizations, and will live with re
newed vitality in the atmosphere of
a real university."
Conceived Idea
Dr. Wilbur said that he had con
ceived the idea of the change when
he was dean of the medical school in
1909, and had further developed it
when he became president of the Uni
versity in 1915.
Pointing out that the new plan has
already been given serious considera
tion in other institutions, Professor
John P. Mitchell, University Regis
trar, who has recently returned from
an Eastern trip, stated that Johns Hop

kins University has definitely signified
its intention to abolish the lower divi
sion. Many other colleges have shown j
considerable interest in the change, j
but Johns Hopkins is the only one to j
take any definite steps.
Since it would not be necessary to ;
decrease the total enrollment in the
university, Mitchell remarked, athletic
coaches would have 2500 men from
whom to pick their teams, instead of
only 2000. The only serious change
would be the dropping of freshman
sports.
Statistics Given
The registrar answered the criticism
of many alumni in regard to the poor
scholastic qualifications of graduates
of junior colleges when he cited the
statistics that had been taken over a
period from September 1923 to June
192 G. A comparison of the ability of
graduates of junior colleges, with that
of those who entered the upper divi
sion from other institutions, and with
those who advanced from the regular
freshman and sophomore years at
Stanford, shows definitely the superi
ority of the first group.
A comparison of actual achievement
in the University showed that the
junior college entrants furnished a
larger proportion of students with
superior records than the native Stan
ford group.
All of these findings with reference
to actual achievement, however, are
tentative, and incomplete, since they
are based only on the records of the
junior year. A study of the same stu
dents in their senior year is planned
for next year.
Stanford will carry out its plan for
abolition of the lower division. The
program is definitely established, and
work will begin to carry it to com
pletion.
"It is too late to get excited about
it," said President Wilbur, speaking
before the Education Club on the
campus Sunday night. "The train has
already gone by."
More Men Eligible
"For those who are concerned over
fears for losses in the athletic field, I
wish to call attention to the fact that
there will be more men eligible for
athletics under the new plan than
before. Under the present system,
many men are barred for the first one
or two years. Under the new plan, all
of our students will be eligible for
these activities. We shall have more
men than ever before.
"Athletics are based upon the old

institutions of the fighter and the
hunter. Athletics are not transient;
they are permanent. They are here to
remain and must be recognized.
"Fraternities go back to the old
group organizations of the savage
days. They will survive under the new
system if they are, indeed, men's or
ganizations, and will live with re
newed vitality in the atmosphere of
a real university."
