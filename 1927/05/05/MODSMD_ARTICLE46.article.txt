# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY WINS REPUTATION FOR INTERNATIONAL SCOPE
## Experts Sent to Europe to Obtain Best Materials For Collection 
### Ey Elizabeth Clark 
The Hoover War Library differs
from the other War Libraries through
out the world in that it is more inter
national and less antiquarian in in
terest. A number of the national war
libraries in Europe have the limited
objective of seeking to preserve the
record of the part, played by their own
nations in the war, whereas
the aim of (he Hoover library has been
to secure all works that have real his
torical value, in whatever language
they may be written, wherever they
may be published, and whether they
appeared during the war or since.
Experts Employed
In order to obtain the very best
material for scholarly research,
trained experts have been sent to Eu
rope to collect documents and pamph
lets. Documents concerning the Wash
ington Conference, the League of Na
tions, the Paris Peace Conference, and
a number of other international bodies
liave been gathered with unusual care.
During the Paris Conference Professor
Ephraim D. Adams of the Stanford
history department called upon all the
national delegations in order to secure
from them copies of the documents
they were using in presenting their
claims. This collection of "Delegation
Propaganda" numbers about two thou
eaid titles.
The Library was founded in 1919
"with funds provided by Herbert
JHoover, *95. In five years, under the
direction of Dr. Adams, it acquired
over 125,000 items, half of which,
being either unprinted or out of print,
are irreplaceable. In 1924 Mr. Hoover
Kave the Library a permanent endow
ment., which is now administered by a
body of directors under the chairman
ship of Adams.
Lutz Called In
After compiling an initial collection
to start the library, Professor Adams
called in Ralph H. Lutz, now associate
professor of history, who was then
nerving in the army. Adams and Lutz
went to Europe together in 1919. Pro
fessor Frank A. Golder was then added
to the list of collectors and made a
trip to the continent in 1920. Since
♦ hen Adams, Lutz, and Golder have
each made individual trips. Lutz re
turned from his last visit, which lasted
six months, just before Christmas last
year.
The Hoover Library collection in
cludes important official documents of
every nation of the world throughout
the war period and the period of re
construction following the war, news
papers and periodicals, pamphlets,
books, and manuscripts.
In carrying out the book-purchase
program, the aid of several eminent
European scholars has been enlisted,
notably of Professor Ifanotaux in
Paris, Pribram in Vienna, Hirn in
Helsingfors, Pokrovshy in Petrograd,
Stephanove in Sofia, and the Hon.
Nelson Gay in Italy.
The manuscript collection consists
of reports and communications bear
ing on conditions in Europe during
war and post-war times, and so-called
"personal memorabilia." These last
are copies of the private papers of
men who were active in world affairs.
Many of these are locked away for a
term of years in compliance with the
•donor's restrictions. Among this type
of material are papers of President
Masaryk of the Czecho slovak Repub
lic, and the late Count Stephen Tisza,
who ruled Hungary during the war.

The Hoover War Library differs
from the other War Libraries through
out the world in that it is more inter
national and less antiquarian in in
terest. A number of the national war
libraries in Europe have the limited
objective of seeking to preserve the
record of the part, played by their own
nations in the war, whereas
the aim of (he Hoover library has been
to secure all works that have real his
torical value, in whatever language
they may be written, wherever they
may be published, and whether they
appeared during the war or since.

lets. Documents concerning the Wash
ington Conference, the League of Na
tions, the Paris Peace Conference, and

liave been gathered with unusual care.

from them copies of the documents
they were using in presenting their
claims. This collection of "Delegation
Propaganda" numbers about two thou
eaid titles.
The Library was founded in 1919
"with funds provided by Herbert
JHoover, *95. In five years, under the
direction of Dr. Adams, it acquired
over 125,000 items, half of which,
being either unprinted or out of print,
are irreplaceable. In 1924 Mr. Hoover
Kave the Library a permanent endow
ment., which is now administered by a
body of directors under the chairman
ship of Adams.
Lutz Called In
After compiling an initial collection
to start the library, Professor Adams
called in Ralph H. Lutz, now associate
professor of history, who was then
nerving in the army. Adams and Lutz
went to Europe together in 1919. Pro

Stephanove in Sofia, and the Hon.
Nelson Gay in Italy.
