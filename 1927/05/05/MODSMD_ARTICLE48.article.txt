# MEANWELL FAVORS ONE-BOUND DRIBBLE RULE IN CAGE GAME
## 
### 
"I am more convinced than ever,
after due experimentation and actual
practice with the new one-bound drib
ble rule, that basketball will be ma
terially improved by it," Dr. Walter
E. Meanwell, veteran coach of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin and member of
the National Rules Committee, said
recently.
"The new rule restricts the number
of fouls and violations very greatly,
speeds up the game, necessitates more
teamwork and better teamwork, prac
tically eliminates the stall and the
delayed offense, and in my judgment
will make the game of basketball a
finer game by far than any we have
had to date. It will not eliminate the
feint and bounce. In fact," Dr. Mean
well concludes, "that play is going to
be very, very frequently used, but will
be succeeded by a pass, which is a
type of game that the Rules Commit
tee has always desired to promote."
