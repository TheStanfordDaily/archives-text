"American student suicides are due to
the fact that all efforts are bent on pro
ducing a few star athletes instead of com
pelling every student to indulge in out
door exercise," Dr. Walter Tvrell Brooks,
coroner of Oxford University, asserts.

He claims that English universities have
not been affected with the "suicide wave,"
because they do not put all the emphasis
on a few athletes.
