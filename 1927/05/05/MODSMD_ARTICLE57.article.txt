# COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP NOT WHAT SHOULD BE DECLARES U.C. HEAD

"Scholarship in the University of
California and in other American uni
versities is not what it should be or
could be," President W. W. Campbell,
of the University of California, re
cently declared. "This is because large
numbers of the young men and women
now composing student bodies in the
colleges did not receive parental disci
pline in intellectual matters, as well
as in other affairs of life, as they
should have received it and as many
of the parents could have given it."
Parental attention has reached its
lowest ebb in years, the president
thinks, although a slow upward ten
dency is now in evidence. "In much
greater degree than is now the case,
the college students of fifty years ago,
and still earlier, came from families in
■which there was an intellectual atmos
phere. Now we have the automobile,
the movie, and what not, to distract
them. In no field of school and college
endeavor is the change from the past
to the present more apparent than in
the subject of English; in the lower
degree of accuracy with which the
English language is written and
spoken; in the imperfect knowledge
of those great books which have lived
for centuries and will continue to
live."
President Campbell believes thor
oughness cannot be accomplished
■with a great multiplicity of subjects
in the elementary schools. In the high
schools, he thinks, the trouble has re
sulted in a flood of pupils from the
so-called part-time law, necessitating
the employment of teachers not pre
pared for their positions.
