# U.C. FOOTBALL HEAD APPROVES DROPPING OF SPRING PRACTICE
## 
### 
BF/RKKLF.Y, Mav 4.â€”"A mightv good
idea" is the wav "Nibs" Price, U.C. var
sity football cnach, views a recent sug
gestion from President Hall and Coach
McEwan of the University of Oregon
that spring football practice be abolished.
In its stead an extra week of fall prac
tice with but one workout a day would
be substituted.
Heretofore, U.C. has worked under a
handicap during fall practice, as the col
lege year begins August 15, and when
conference practice opens on September
15 practically all men out for football
must get whatever instruction they can
after classes, between 4 o'clock and dark
ness. This means an actual average of
less than three hours a day.
Tt has been the general consensus of
opinion among medical advisers and
trainers that many early season football
injuries are due to lack of conditioning.
Another week of fall practice before
games are played should materially re
duce injuries and thus remove one cause
for criticism of the game.
