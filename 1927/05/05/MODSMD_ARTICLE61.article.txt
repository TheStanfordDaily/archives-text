the psychology department and erst
while resident of ltoble Hall, lias just
earned fame with Katherine Waters,
daughter of the mayor of Chico and
senior member of Kappa Delta soror
ity at U.C., as the first trans-Pacific
collegiate female stowaways.
Identically dressed and smiling tboir
farewell to the captain of the Maui,
which sailed from San Francisco last
week, the two girls hurried from the
ship as soon as it docked and received
their suitcases at the Honolulu post
office, where they had previously been
mailed by parcel post. After two days
out from San Francisco, the girls were
discovered by the Maui's officers and
given -cabin freedom. It was under
stood, however, that they were to be
transferred at sea to the Matsonia,
which was bound for the mainland. A
few hours before the latter appeared,
the young ladies developed serious
symptoms of seasickness, and at the
advice of the ship's surgeon they were
not transferred. When the smoke of
the Matsonda had disappeared on the
California horizon, the stowaways re
covered.
Miss Applegate has been prominent
in Stanford activities, debating against
LT.C. two years ago on the Women's
Debating Team. "We were just look
ing for adventure," she said when
asked for an explanation of the esca
pade.
