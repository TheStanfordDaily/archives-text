# DANGER OF TOO MANY ENGAGEMENTS KEEPS WOMEN FROM CRUISE
##

"Of course many of our students be
came engaged on the voyage," said Mrs.
P. M. Fogg, Dean of Women on the
Holland-American liner "Ryndam," first
American co-educational floating uni
versity, which recently docked in New
York after a seven months' tour of the
world. "It was only a perfectly natural
outgrowth of propinquity and attachments
formed during the trip. But aside from
this—or better, including this—l can state
quite positively that the co-educational
aspect of the cruise was a success in every
way."
The second world tour, which will be
gin in September, will not be co-e<taca
tional, however. Dr. James Lough, Dean
of Men, stated that the girls provide
something of a distraction on a long
cruise, and that it was rather difficult to
find proper accommodations for the girl
students on the field excursions.
