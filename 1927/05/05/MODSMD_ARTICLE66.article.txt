"F's" are few and far between, as
far as the Golf Alphabet is concerned.
Besides "Fore!," "fairway," "four
some," and club "faces," there are not
so many well-known names in golf
that begin with the sixth letter. But
the quality of the few more than
makes up for the lack of quantity. Five
golfers like Fownes, Farrell, French,
Mrs. Fox, and Mrs. Fraser are worth
five hundred who shoot nine holes in
fifty.
The current president of the United
States Golf Association is the very
efficient William C. Fownes, Jr., of
Pittsburgh. Pa. Bill Fownes is more
than a mere executive —he is a fine
golfer, good enough seventeen yearts
ago to win the United States amateur
championship, being the only "F" who
ever reached the finals.
When Glenna Collett "came back"
to rewin the women's national title in
1025, her opponent in the final round
at the St. Louis Country Club was Mrs.
W. G. Fraser, of Montreal, Canada. As
Alexa Stirling, of Atlanta, Georgia,
Mrs. Fraser had won the championship
three times running, in 191G, 1919, and
1920. (No tournament was held in 1917
and 1918.) She also finished second
in 1921 and 1923.
So much for the champions. Now
for the near champions. Johnny Far
rell. of New York, is a near champion
if one ever lived. He has come close
to a national open title on several oc
casions, and has won so many lesser
championships that folks have begun
to call him "the Abe Mitchell of Amer
ica." Mitchell, you will remember,
while being one of Great Britain's
greatest golfers for years, has never
won the U.S. or British open. Farrell
has won the title of "Champion Med
alist," and, like Mitchell, is a long and
accurate driver. In fact, he once won
a $1,000 bill by outdriving Mitchell
and two other pros in a contest in
Florida. *
Emmett French, of Ohio, is another
pro who has never reached the top,
yet has many titles and course records

to his credit. His wife is also a fine
golfer.
Mrs. Caleb Pox, a 66-year-old grand
mother, has beaten Glenna Collett
twice, and has failed to qualify in only
one women's national championship in
the last twenty-seven years, if mem
ory does not fail. She reached the final
round in 1899.
