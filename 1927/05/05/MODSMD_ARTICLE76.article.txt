# OHIO STATE PROHIBITS DUCKING OF FRESHMEN
## 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio (f.P.).â€”One of
Ohio State's oldest traditions was put in
the discard when President George W.
Rightmire issued the order that "any man
who is in any way connected with throw
ing a freshman in the lake, by force, will
sever his connections with this univer
sity."
For years it had been the custojn of the
Bucket and Dipper, whose duty it was to
enforce freshman regulations, to throw
disobedient frosli into the lake in the
center of the campus.
Tn taking his stand against this form
of hazing, the president declared that no
one group has a right to force another
group to do anything which it does not
want to. A student has a right to do as
he pleases, Dr. Rightmire said, so long
as he does nothing wrong, and the per
sonal liberty of the student must not be
interfered with.
