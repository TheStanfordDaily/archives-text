# BILL PASSED, FUNDING 1932 OLYMPIC GAMES
## 
### 
The Olympic Games bill, authorizing
California to issue $1,000,000 worth of
bonds to finance the 1932 games in Los
Angeles, has just been signed by Gover
nor Young and is a law.
William May Garland, Los Angeles
financier, is father of the move to bring
the 1932 event here, and Assemblyman
Woolwine of Los Angeles is one of the
authors of the bill.
The 1928 Olympic Games will be held
in Amsterdam, Holland. Extensive plans
for a huge stadium there have already
been prepared and preliminary arrange
ments begun.
