resorts, 1 maintain the contact and at
mosphere of the first two years are bene- i
ficial enough to the thousands who go for
learning's sake to justify the terms."
Such was the comment of Dr. Emery
Fibey, dean of the Down Town College [
of the University of Chicago, yesterday
on Stanford's action in destruction of the
