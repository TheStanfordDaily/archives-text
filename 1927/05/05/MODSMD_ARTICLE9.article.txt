Bill Noack pitched a no-hit game
against the Junipero Serra nine yesterday
afternoon while his teammates pounded
out enough hits in three innings to win
two or three ball games, and the El Tigre
team cinched the championship of League
V, with five games won and none lost.
Three forfeits marred the rest of the
afternoon's schedule as follows: Delta
Upsilon to Sigina Chi, Phi Kappa Psi
to Encina 1. and Branner to Independents.
The El Tigre nine started to pile up a
big lead in the first inning, when, with
two three-baggers, a home run, several
walks, and errors by the Junipero Serra
outfield, six tallies were scored.
The latter, however, were seriously
handicapped when Frank Harold, regular
moundsman who brought the University
championship to his team last year, was
forced to relinquish his due to a strained
arm, and Guthrie with little practice was
unable to stop the heavy stickwork of
the winners.
