Bill Noack pitched a no-hit game
against the Junipero Serra nine yesterday
afternoon while his teammates pounded
out enough hits in three innings to win
two or three ball games, and the El Tigre
team cinched the championship of League
V, with five games won and none lost.
Three forfeits marred the rest of the
afternoon's schedule as follows: Delta
Upsilon to Sigina Chi, Phi Kappa Psi
to Encina 1. and Branner to Independents.
The El Tigre nine started to pile up a
big lead in the first inning, when, with
two three-baggers, a home run, several
walks, and errors by the Junipero Serra
outfield, six tallies were scored.
The latter, however, were seriously
handicapped when Frank Harold, regular
moundsman who brought the University
championship to his team last year, was
forced to relinquish his due to a strained
arm, and Guthrie with little practice was
unable to stop the heavy stickwork of
the winners.
Noack Clever
Noack, alternate hurler for Hunter of
El Tigre, forced his opponents out in one,
two, three manner in the first, with pop
flies to the infield.
The second saw the winners on another
batting rampage. With two outs against
them, they loaded the bases, and Stock
bridge, fourth man up, knocked out a
home-run. This started another spurt,
and alter two more got on base G. Prizin
zano hit a clean two-bagger, forcing them
home, later coming home himself 011 an
other hit.
Junipero Scrra got a man on base in
their half of the inning, due to an error,
but a double play choked off any possi
bility for a run, and the El Tigrc men
came to bat again.
This la-st inning saw four more runs
pounded across the plate when, with two
011, Jack Prizinzano slammed out another
home run, scoring three. The fourth tally
was forced in when Zipfel walked four
men in a row.
Game Called
One error got another Junipero Serra
on base in the last half of the frame, but
three straight outs from the infield ended
the inning and the game was called by the
losers at that time.
Tomorrow's schedule will sec only three
games, as the contest for the champion
ship of League VII between Thcta Chi
and El Campo has been postponed until
Friday. The remaining contests are as
