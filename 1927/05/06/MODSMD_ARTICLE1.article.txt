# CLASS OF 1928 HOLDS SWAY WITH WEEK-END FESTIVITIES
## Clever Plot, Catchy Music, Good Dancing Combined In Junior Opera DIRECTION COMMENDED Humorous Situations Excel Those of Former Shows Given on Campus 
### John Rogers 
Syncopation—catchy tunes —clever
dancing—fine acting—and an honest
to-goodness plot—all of these are in
"Wicked William," the Junior Opera
that will be staged tomorrow night at
8:20 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Even last Wednesday night at the first
dress rehearsal, when things are usu
ally in a hectic uproar and mess, the
production went along with a smooth
ness that is customarily found only
in public performances—and then not
too often.
The authors, R. Frank Baker and
Winston Norman, have written a play
that, in dramatic and humorous situa
tions, far surpasses previous campus
musical comedies and is quite the
equal of productions of the same kind
that have recently visited the Coast.
The gags are really funny, the situa
tions modern and sophisticated, and
the dramatic unity of the play has
not been sacrificed to make a mean
ingless farcical mixture of bright
cracks, burlesque songs, and chorus
antics.
Direction Excellent
The direction of all parts of the pro
duction are as near to perfection as
is possible. Gordon Davis has availed
himself of every opportunity to bring
out the comedy of the lines, situations,
and characterizations. The orchestra,
which Gordon Hall has been rehears
ing, plays the jazz pieces in a finished
manner. Three choruses —pony, beau
ty, and male — coached by Frances
Boone, have mastered some of the j
most intricate stfeps that have ever \
been given to campus dancers, and
they do them well. And the sets, de
signed by E. Leslie Iviler, are among
the best and most-novel —particularly ■
that depicting an Atlantic City hotel j
—that have been used on the Stan-J
ford stage.
Acting Shows Finish
The members of the opera cast, j
chosen for their abilities to act and j
to sing, present the most finished work j
that has been seen in this kind of a|
show. The leads do not dummy for j
sticks when the choruses —who, by the '
Marathon, canoe races, canoe tilts, and
j exhibition diving.

the dramatic unity of the play has
not been sacrificed to make a mean
ingless farcical mixture of bright
cracks, burlesque songs, and chorus
antics.
Direction Excellent
The direction of all parts of the pro
duction are as near to perfection as
is possible. Gordon Davis has availed
himself of every opportunity to bring
out the comedy of the lines, situations,
and characterizations. The orchestra,
which Gordon Hall has been rehears
ing, plays the jazz pieces in a finished
manner. Three choruses —pony, beau
ty, and male — coached by Frances
Boone, have mastered some of the j
most intricate stfeps that have ever \
been given to campus dancers, and
they do them well. And the sets, de
signed by E. Leslie Iviler, are among
the best and most-novel —particularly ■
that depicting an Atlantic City hotel j
—that have been used on the Stan-J
ford stage.
Acting Shows Finish
The members of the opera cast, j
chosen for their abilities to act and j
to sing, present the most finished work j
that has been seen in this kind of a|
show. The leads do not dummy for j

Marathon, canoe races, canoe tilts, and

Only ten men will swim on each team
in the Swedish marathon this year in
stead of the customary fifteen, announced
Ernst Brandstfn yesterday. Tentative
teams for the relay were announced yes
terday by the four captains: Seniors—
Williams, captain, Stevenson, Fletcher,
Brooks, Stewart, Christianson, Bruner,
Smith, Ward, and Kocher; juniors—
Van den Akker, captain, Klein, Harris,
Smith, Danford, Hunter, King, Sims,
Jcssup, and Ryan; sophomores—Thurlow,
captain, Strong, West, Bramel, Burns,
Cole, Thon, Chichester, and Valentine;
freshmen — Harrison, captain, Hobdy,
Driggs, Pahl, Thornton, Peters, Thrond
son, Conradi, Kincead, Neef, and Mc-

Six Canoe Race Entries
Six entries have been received for the
; canoe races and five for the canoe tilts.
! Last-minute entries in both of these
(events will be received on Saturday morn
j i«g-
Dave Fall, Olympic diver, Walt Mills,
land Ed Throndson will make some ex
ihihition dives from the high board on the
! boathouse, and Del Daves will entertain
! with his stunts.
Roos Bros, and Wideman's have each
(contributed a merchandise order as first
jand second prizes for the canoe races.
Syncopation—catchy tunes —clever
dancing—fine acting—and an honest
to-goodness plot—all of these are in
"Wicked William," the Junior Opera
that will be staged tomorrow night at
8:20 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Even last Wednesday night at the first
dress rehearsal, when things are usu
ally in a hectic uproar and mess, the
production went along with a smooth
ness that is customarily found only
in public performances—and then not
too often.
The authors, R. Frank Baker and
Winston Norman, have written a play
that, in dramatic and humorous situa
tions, far surpasses previous campus
musical comedies and is quite the
equal of productions of the same kind
that have recently visited the Coast.
The gags are really funny, the situa
tions modern and sophisticated, and
the dramatic unity of the play has
not been sacrificed to make a mean
ingless farcical mixture of bright
cracks, burlesque songs, and chorus
antics.
