# CLASS OF 1928 HOLDS SWAY WITH WEEK-END FESTIVITIES
## Clever Plot, Catchy Music, Good Dancing Combined In Junior Opera DIRECTION COMMENDED Humorous Situations Excel Those of Former Shows Given on Campus 
### John Rogers 
Syncopation—catchy tunes —clever
dancing—fine acting—and an honest
to-goodness plot—all of these are in
"Wicked William," the Junior Opera
that will be staged tomorrow night at
8:20 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Even last Wednesday night at the first
dress rehearsal, when things are usu

manner. Three choruses —pony, beau
ty, and male — coached by Frances
Boone, have mastered some of the j
most intricate stfeps that have ever \
been given to campus dancers, and
they do them well. And the sets, de
signed by E. Leslie Iviler, are among
the best and most-novel —particularly ■
that depicting an Atlantic City hotel j
—that have been used on the Stan-J
ford stage.
Acting Shows Finish
The members of the opera cast, j
chosen for their abilities to act and j
to sing, present the most finished work j
that has been seen in this kind of a|
show. The leads do not dummy for j
sticks when the choruses —who, by the '
