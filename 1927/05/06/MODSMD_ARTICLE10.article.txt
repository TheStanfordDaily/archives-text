# MONDAY WILL OPEN STUDENT CAMPAIGN FOR CHARITY QUOTA
## Convalescent Home Is Sole Institution Stanford Has to Support 
### 
Monday will be the opening day of
j the Stanford Convalescent Home drive
| lo raise the Stanford students' share
of the $5000 which has been set as
j the quota for this vicinity. A meeting
of the committee, under the chairman
ship of Charles W. Dickenson, was
held yesterday to make plans for the
drive.
"The Convalescent Home is the one
charity that Stanford students sup
port. It means the constant care of
forty children. They come to the home
weak, sick, and undernourished, and
go out in the world stronger, healthier,
and happier. It is a cause worthy of
your support," said Dickenson yester
day.
Yearly Increases Rated
During the year 1926 the Convale
scent Home took care of 209 children,
ninety-five per cent of whom were
from San Francisco, an average of
13.5 per cent over 1925. The average
cost for each child per day was $2.28
of the 209 children, which was an in
crease of twenty-five over the previous
year, sixty-five per cent came from
Lane Hospital in San Francisco,
twelve per cent from the University
of California clinic, and the balance
from the bay district and San Jose.
The average age of the children was
seven years and seven months. The
youngest was two years and eight
months, and the oldest twelve years.
The home receives children under five
years with some hesitancy, but the
demand was so heavy that they took
in thirty-nine.
Many Outside Friends
Children of the Convalescent Home
have many friends. Alternate groups,
including the housemothers of sorori
ties on the campus, meet every Thurs
day to mend clothes. Stanford Wo
men's Clubs in the southern part of
the state send up clothes regularly.
Different organizations on the campus j
and in Palo Alto give parties on all j
the holidays. Each month a birthday j
party is given, and children, who have
a birthday during that month, receive
a gift.
Some of the children become so
attached to the home that they hate
to leave it when transferred or dis
missed, report the attendants. One
boy comes back every Christmas to j
spend that day at home. The record, j
which is kept for every child, shows |
that practically every patient shows a I
marked improvement before he leaves.
The home was recently left $40,000
in the bequest of Mrs. Harry Babcock.
This will be used to build another
unit, which will accommodate about
twenty more people. The Auxiliary
Board has made a gift of $35,000 to â– 
provide a new Administration Build- \
ing which is badly needed at the j
home.
