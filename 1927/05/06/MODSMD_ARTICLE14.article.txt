# DR. WILBUR, SELLARDS URGE ADVANTAGES OF SUMMER ATTENDANCE
## Students Have Opportunity To Broaden Contacts, Develop Interests 
### 
President Wilbur and John A. Sel
| lards are enthusiastic over prospects
| for the coming quarter. Both for stu
| dents continuing their regular course
at the University and for visitors from
other institutions, they believe that
the summer session will afford un
usual opportunities.
Wilbur states: "The Summer Quar
ter is now on an established basis.
Each year shows a steady increase in
the number of students in attendance,
in the quality of the work offered, and i
in the number of students pursuing
! advanced studies. The climate of the
j Santa Clara Valley is ideal during the
I summer months.
Faculty Distinguished
Besides the increasing number of
| the faculty offering courses, many dis
! tinguished scholars and teachers are
j coming to Stanford from other uni-1
j versities of the United States and j
I Europe. There is a broadening influ- j
ence from these visitors, and students j
in attendance during other quarters j
should carefully consider the possible :
advantage to themselves of remaining
; for <i summer of study at Stanford." j
Sellards Enthusiastic
John A. Sellards, Director of the
j Summer Quarter, also expresses him
: self enthusiastically over the advan
j tages offered in the summer session
i program. He says:"The program for
I the coming Summer Quarter has been
planned to meet, as far as possible, j
the needs of students who remain at
the University, as well as to provide
| for several hundreds of visitors who
come here for summer study only.
Last year more students who had pre
viously been enrolled at Stanford
registered for the Summer Quarter
than at any time in the past, and a
further increase is expected this year.
Free from many of the college activi
ties and distractions of other Quarters,
students have an excellent chance not
only to advance their standing but to
explore new fields, develop new inter
ests, and to lay the foundations of a j
broader culture."
