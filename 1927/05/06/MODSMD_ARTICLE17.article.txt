# SCOPE OF SUMMER QUARTER PRESAGES HEAVY ENROLLMENT
## Social Life of Campus Taken Care of With Dances, Teas, Receptions STEADY GROWTH IN SIZE Student Activities Slacken During Fourth Quarter; Dramatics Remain 
### 
The Summer Quarter this year, the
tenth since the University adopted the
four-quarter plan, has been broadened in
scope in every direction, and all indica
tions point to a larger enrollment than in
any previous summer. Beginning in 1918
with a student body of something more
than 300 and a half-dozen visiting edu
cators to supplement the small faculty of
regular Stanford professors, the growth
lias been steady until last summer there
were 1200 students. This summer there
will be forty visiting faculty members,
including a number of the most eminent
European scholars.
While the Stanford Summer Quarter
is on exactly the same academic plane as
the other three terms of the year and is
of regular length, so that credit for work
counts full value toward a degree, there
are considerable difference:'.
Few Student Activities
One of these is the greatly decreased
amount of student activities, dramatics
being practically the only campus activity
during the summer. To a considerable
degree a substitute for these is provided
in the organizations centering around the
departments of University work. The,
lessened pressure of student activities also
affords opportunity for devoting the sum
mer to specialized work along new lines
of study of individual interest.
The climate of the campus makes it
possible t;o engage in active exercise
throughout the summer, and there are
ample facilities for all sorts of games
and recreations, with two swimming
pools, an abundance of tennis courts and
play fields, besides the opportunity for
swimming and boating at Searsville Lake,
for hikes and horseback rides in the sur
rounding hills, and for golf on nearby
links.
The social life of the campus is fully
cared for during the summer, various
groups arranging for dances, teas, and in
formal receptions, while the cultural side
is taken cognizance of by an increased
number of lectures and concerts.
.Since a considerable portion of the
summer student body is composed of ad
vanced students carrying on special work,
the schools and departments offering
courses for them, such as the School of
Education and the Law School, have al
ways been particularly strong. But with
the steadily increasing proportion of un
dergraduates from Stanford and else
where, particular attention has been paid
to courses to meet their needs. In the
languages departments, in history, eco
nomics, and the sciences, there are many
courses especially designed for freshmen
and sophomores and beginners in these
subjects.
On the other hand, the presence of emi
nent scholars from other American and
European universities attracts a consid
erate number of advanced and special
students who come particularly for the
courses these men give.

of study of individual interest.
The climate of the campus makes it
possible t;o engage in active exercise
throughout the summer, and there are
ample facilities for all sorts of games
and recreations, with two swimming
pools, an abundance of tennis courts and
play fields, besides the opportunity for
swimming and boating at Searsville Lake,
for hikes and horseback rides in the sur
rounding hills, and for golf on nearby
links.
The social life of the campus is fully
cared for during the summer, various
groups arranging for dances, teas, and in
formal receptions, while the cultural side
is taken cognizance of by an increased
number of lectures and concerts.
.Since a considerable portion of the
summer student body is composed of ad
vanced students carrying on special work,
the schools and departments offering
courses for them, such as the School of
Education and the Law School, have al
ways been particularly strong. But with
the steadily increasing proportion of un
dergraduates from Stanford and else
where, particular attention has been paid
to courses to meet their needs. In the
languages departments, in history, eco
nomics, and the sciences, there are many
courses especially designed for freshmen
and sophomores and beginners in these
subjects.
On the other hand, the presence of emi
nent scholars from other American and
European universities attracts a consid
erate number of advanced and special
students who come particularly for the
courses these men give.
The Summer Quarter this year, the
tenth since the University adopted the
four-quarter plan, has been broadened in
scope in every direction, and all indica
tions point to a larger enrollment than in
any previous summer. Beginning in 1918
with a student body of something more
than 300 and a half-dozen visiting edu
cators to supplement the small faculty of
regular Stanford professors, the growth
lias been steady until last summer there
were 1200 students. This summer there
will be forty visiting faculty members,
including a number of the most eminent
European scholars.
While the Stanford Summer Quarter
is on exactly the same academic plane as
the other three terms of the year and is
of regular length, so that credit for work
counts full value toward a degree, there
are considerable difference:'.
Few Student Activities
One of these is the greatly decreased
amount of student activities, dramatics
being practically the only campus activity
during the summer. To a considerable
degree a substitute for these is provided
in the organizations centering around the
departments of University work. The,
lessened pressure of student activities also
affords opportunity for devoting the sum
mer to specialized work along new lines
of study of individual interest.
