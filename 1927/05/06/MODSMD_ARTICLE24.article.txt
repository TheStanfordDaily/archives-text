# The 						Annual Question
## 
### 
Where are you going - to spend your summer vacation? Ilot weather
is unknown in the Evergreen Playground of Stanford University. For
here is an invigorating summer climate tempered by cool salt breezes
blowing down the Bay, pure mountain air from the beautiful snow
capped (?) Santa Cruz range. You will spend every day in perfect
physical comfort—you will welcome blankets at night in the hills, (adv.)
And yet, why waste the whole summer time? Use your vacation in
training for business advancement. You can climb while others dream—
if you will, (adv.)
But to be serious, the Stanford summer school offers a varied and
interesting program for both graduates and undergraduates. Prominent
teachers from leading institutions of the United States and Europe have
been added to the already expert faculty. Dr. Navarro Tomas is offering
courses in Spanish, along with Stanford's own Professors Alfred Coester
and Aurelio M. Espinosa. Professor Karl Buhler of the University of
Vienna will be teaching full time in the Psychology department, with
Dr. Kate Gordon of the University of California at Los Angeles and
Professors Stone, Merrill, and Terman of Stanford.
Dr. Louis Arnaud Reid of the University of Liverpool will offer "In
troduction to Philosophy" and a more advanced course, "Truth and Its
Place in Reality." A visiting professor of note will offer courses in
Romanic Languages at Stanford this summer. And so, in every depart
ment in the University, courses have been strengthened by visiting
experts.
The University has also arranged concerts, lectures, and recitals for
the entertainment of the summer students. Athletics and dramatics will
have their place in the activities of the quarter, along with dances, teas,
and whatnots. The Cactus Gardens will be open every evening during
the summer months from 9 until 1 o'clock, and later for special parties.
San Francisco will still be one hour's ride from the campus, and the
beaches at Santa Cruz two hours. The students may take their books to
Yosemite or Lake Tahoe for the week-ends, where the atmosphere may
be more conducive to study.
And so the undergraduate who seeks to shorten his course or to make
up work lost; the graduate student who is a candidate for an advanced or
professional degree; the teacher or school administrator who needs ad
vanced training, certification, or merely the mental stimulus of certain
selected courses—all these will find work to meet their requirements at
Stanford this summer. The program for the Summer Quarter has been
planned to meet the demands of both undergraduate students and those
who are working for higher degrees, and an unusually interesting selec
tion of courses has been arranged for both groups this year.

courses in Spanish, along with Stanford's own Professors Alfred Coester
and Aurelio M. Espinosa. Professor Karl Buhler of the University of
Vienna will be teaching full time in the Psychology department, with
Dr. Kate Gordon of the University of California at Los Angeles and
Professors Stone, Merrill, and Terman of Stanford.
Dr. Louis Arnaud Reid of the University of Liverpool will offer "In
troduction to Philosophy" and a more advanced course, "Truth and Its
Place in Reality." A visiting professor of note will offer courses in
Romanic Languages at Stanford this summer. And so, in every depart
ment in the University, courses have been strengthened by visiting
experts.
The University has also arranged concerts, lectures, and recitals for
the entertainment of the summer students. Athletics and dramatics will
have their place in the activities of the quarter, along with dances, teas,
and whatnots. The Cactus Gardens will be open every evening during
the summer months from 9 until 1 o'clock, and later for special parties.
San Francisco will still be one hour's ride from the campus, and the
beaches at Santa Cruz two hours. The students may take their books to
Yosemite or Lake Tahoe for the week-ends, where the atmosphere may
be more conducive to study.
And so the undergraduate who seeks to shorten his course or to make
up work lost; the graduate student who is a candidate for an advanced or
professional degree; the teacher or school administrator who needs ad
vanced training, certification, or merely the mental stimulus of certain
selected courses—all these will find work to meet their requirements at
Stanford this summer. The program for the Summer Quarter has been
planned to meet the demands of both undergraduate students and those
who are working for higher degrees, and an unusually interesting selec
tion of courses has been arranged for both groups this year.
Where are you going - to spend your summer vacation? Ilot weather
is unknown in the Evergreen Playground of Stanford University. For
here is an invigorating summer climate tempered by cool salt breezes
blowing down the Bay, pure mountain air from the beautiful snow
capped (?) Santa Cruz range. You will spend every day in perfect
physical comfort—you will welcome blankets at night in the hills, (adv.)
And yet, why waste the whole summer time? Use your vacation in
training for business advancement. You can climb while others dream—
if you will, (adv.)
But to be serious, the Stanford summer school offers a varied and
interesting program for both graduates and undergraduates. Prominent
teachers from leading institutions of the United States and Europe have
been added to the already expert faculty. Dr. Navarro Tomas is offering
courses in Spanish, along with Stanford's own Professors Alfred Coester
and Aurelio M. Espinosa. Professor Karl Buhler of the University of
Vienna will be teaching full time in the Psychology department, with
Dr. Kate Gordon of the University of California at Los Angeles and
