("hiaybej during the afternoon in preparation for the Junior Opera which
will be presented tomorrow evening in the Assembly Hall; and then they
will end the glorious Junior week-end by attending the cast dance.
The Junior Class never puts things on half-way. Everything points
to one success after another this week-end for the Class of 1928. The
Junior have even asked the ruffs to enjoy the Prom at their expense after
11 o'clock. But this courtesy extended to the ruffs should be returned
by those accepting. It must be remembered that the trees, foliage, and
sky of the Enchanted Forest are just rented for the evening, and should
not therefore be carried away in the ruffs' pockets. Or in other words
"Do Not Pick the Flowers."
