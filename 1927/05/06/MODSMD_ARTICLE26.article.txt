The baseball teams finished practice for the year, but the Physical
Education department insists that they keep in shape for next season by
signing up for some other form of gym work for the remainder of the
year. The ball team has been out for practice five days a week and its
members have played a game on the sixth day for the last two quarters,
and yet these men are forced to sign up for swimming or boxing or some
thing.
Varsity and freshman players have already done enough physical
work for the quarter, and should be allowed to have the rest of the year
to themselves for studying or pleasure. The teams practice longer in the
afternoon than men signing up for gym teams, and they have therefore
earned their unit of credit without this additional work.
