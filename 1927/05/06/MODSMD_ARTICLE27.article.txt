HIGH PRESSURE

Whether or not high pressure sales- j
manship has been in any way respon
sible for creating a condition of pros-1
perity in this country, high pressure
salesmen are getting to be something
of a nuisance. Particularly is this true
on a college campus such as this,
where the prevailing hospitable atti- j
tude allows easy access to living
groups.
Taking advantage of the courtesy
extended to all strangers, the sales
man makes it his practice to drop in
at meal times. After enjoying the
gratuitous beans he spreads his wares
all over the house, converting it for
the time being into a salesroom. He
thinks nothing of interrupting the cus
tomary friendly chatter with his bor-:
ing line of patter regarding the merits I
of the particular firm he represents
! and the particular articles lie is dis
pensing.
The fellow is trained to ignore the
patent fact that he is unwelcome. It I
is part of his business to act at all j
times as though he considered himself
the life of the party.

The annoying part about the whole \
affair is that the sales made "by men j
of this type apparently justify the ex- j
pense of putting them in the field. For j
they are constantly growing more j

numerous.
It strikes us that something should
he clone to abate this nuisance. We
should bo immensely pleased to see
the day when the hospitality of the
campus living groups was refused to
those who abuse it by turning it to
their own profit.

FINE DAY!
Yesterday was the last day for the
payment of syllabus fees. Today an
assessment of two dollars will be
levied on the unforTfrnates who failed
to pay them in- time. While the cir
cumstance has been remarked before,
it would not be out of place to repeat
that the two-dollar fine is out of all
proportion to the extra labor involved
in receipting the bill a few days late.
The attitude of the administration
in matters of this typo has always
been a source of personal annoyance
to us. It has been held that the fine is
levied as a punitive and corrective
measure. With no desire to be un
pleasant about it, may we voice a
slight misgiving concerning this mo
tive. The fine, to our mind, is levied
with the purpose in view of getting
the two dollars. And a more irritating
method of getting two dollars could
not possibly have been devised.
