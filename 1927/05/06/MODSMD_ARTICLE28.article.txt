SCOTLAND YARD. By George Dilnot.
Houghton, Mifflin, Co.
Standing on the Thames embank-!
ment on an ironic site originally in- j
tended for a theatre, its gray walls !
1
peopled with all the ghosts of mys- ;
tery, glamor, and tradition, Scotland j
Yard raises its austere bulk, fashioned |
in 2500 tons of granite by convicts of i
Dartmoor.
Coldly, and without romance, Mr. j
George Dilmot lifts the veil, and mys-!
tery gives place to facts, glamor to
common sense; only tradition re
mains. It is a police history covering
ninety-seven years.
There is a strange lure to Ameri
cans about Scotland Yard. It breathes
of mystery, of spies, of international ;
intrigue. It connotes something of old |
world conspiracies, seems to be a fit
ting spell of Charing Cross, Piccadilly |
Circus and Rotten Row. But Scotland :
Yard, called a prosaic police headquar
ters would lose immeasureably. For
it has the magic of a name.
Mr. Dilnot's book goes exhaustively
into London police history, telling of
early days when watchmen with lan
terns were the only protection, and
how Bow street runners, or detectives,
traced "rascals and rogues." It men-:
tions John Townsend as the most |

celebrated of these runners, a quaint
character in fearful dress and remini-
I scent of Dickens. There is hardly a
! phase of police work that this book
j does not cover. The romance that is
I Scotland Yard is not treated as such,
i Rather the book is the cold analysis
;of a century's record, giving credit
and blame impartially and dealing at
length with the duties of the various
divisions of the Metropolitan Force.
The most interesting part of the
' book is that devoted to the Criminal
Investigation Department. Celebrated
; cases are explained in detail, including
Jack the Ripper and the Dr. Crippen
! slaying mystery. But little is told of
' the diplomatic branch of the Yard, for
there state secrets lurk.
i The impelling force behind Scotland
| Yard is to prevent crime by prepared
ness; and, second, detection of crime
| after commission. The scientific meth
: ods used to detect criminals and the
merciless certainty of British courts
and justice give weight to the former.
As for the second factor, the book
'abounds in the cold statement: "The
| acused was convicted and hanged."
Only one thing is lacking to make
the story complete. Mr. Dilnot fails to
reveal why it is the Yard at all and
: what Scotland has to do with it.

SCOTLAND YARD. By George Dilnot.
Houghton, Mifflin, Co.
Standing on the Thames embank-!
ment on an ironic site originally in- j
tended for a theatre, its gray walls !
1
peopled with all the ghosts of mys- ;
tery, glamor, and tradition, Scotland j
Yard raises its austere bulk, fashioned |
in 2500 tons of granite by convicts of i
Dartmoor.
Coldly, and without romance, Mr. j
George Dilmot lifts the veil, and mys-!
tery gives place to facts, glamor to
common sense; only tradition re
mains. It is a police history covering
ninety-seven years.
There is a strange lure to Ameri
cans about Scotland Yard. It breathes
of mystery, of spies, of international ;
intrigue. It connotes something of old |
world conspiracies, seems to be a fit
ting spell of Charing Cross, Piccadilly |
Circus and Rotten Row. But Scotland :
Yard, called a prosaic police headquar
ters would lose immeasureably. For
it has the magic of a name.
Mr. Dilnot's book goes exhaustively
into London police history, telling of
early days when watchmen with lan
terns were the only protection, and
how Bow street runners, or detectives,
traced "rascals and rogues." It men-:
tions John Townsend as the most |

celebrated of these runners, a quaint
character in fearful dress and remini-
I scent of Dickens. There is hardly a
! phase of police work that this book
j does not cover. The romance that is
I Scotland Yard is not treated as such,
i Rather the book is the cold analysis
;of a century's record, giving credit
and blame impartially and dealing at
length with the duties of the various
divisions of the Metropolitan Force.
The most interesting part of the
' book is that devoted to the Criminal
Investigation Department. Celebrated
; cases are explained in detail, including
Jack the Ripper and the Dr. Crippen
! slaying mystery. But little is told of
' the diplomatic branch of the Yard, for
there state secrets lurk.
