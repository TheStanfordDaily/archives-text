# Fantastic Woodland Scenes, Garish Colors Feature Prom Decorations
## CORD BALL FIRST EVENT Lake Sports Carnival Takes Place Tomorrow; Daves To Provide Fun 
### 
Starting its three-day reign over the
campus, the Class of 1928 ushered in
Junior Week yesterday afternoon with
; the Cord Ball. The festivities will be
| continued tonight with the Junior Prom,
j Tomorrow morning will be taken up by
I the annual lake sports carnival at Lagu
j nita, while in the evening the Junior
! Opera will bring the period to a close.
Fantastic woodland retreats, grotesque
I trees, and gigantic insects painted in gar
ish colors have transformed the Basketball
Pavilion into an enchanted forest for the
Prom. These paintings are hung in pan
els, each one being framed by silhouetted
trees, their branches twined into arches
overhead.
Weird Effects Given
Nearly all the lighting will be indi
rect, and the semi-darkness thus created
will add to the weird and grotesque effect.
The music for the dance is being fur
nished by the future Athens Club Orches
tra under the direction of A1 Lissner. The
orchestra will be placed on a slightly
raised platform directly opposite the en
trance. Behind them will be a waterfall
which will emulate the real thing by the
use of a ripple producer. The east end of
the pavilion will be left open, and roughs
will be admitted after 11 o'clock.
Lake Sports Tomorrow
Lake sports will be held tomorrow
morning from 10 o'clock until 12 on
Lagunita under the direction of Bob Har
ris. Five events make up the program;
these are the cross-lake swim, Swedish
way, sing as well as they dance, and
look as well as they do each of the
others —do their stuff, but, taking a
hint from metropolitan productions,
get in and dance with them.
Music Striking
And the music—it is unquestionably
the best that has ever graced a cam-1
pus musical comedy, and it would not j
be the least surprising if some of the |
songs gained national popularity. Jean
Wakefield's theme song, a tango,
merits its place of importance, while
her "Brand New Man" is one of the
neatest blue numbers that she has
composed. Jack Wiggin, leader of the
orchestra, has contributed two one- [
steps that nearly overwork the chor-1
uses in their dances.
No Mediocre Part
When the entire opera is on a par
of perfection it is impossible to pick
out individual bits of excellence, for
there are no spots of mediocrity that
mar the whole. The best thing to do
is to go and see it —and there are still
a few good seats left, but only a few.
They are on sale at $1 and $1.25 today
from 8:30 to 5 o'clock in the Old Union
and/at Crandall's. Tomorrow they can
be obtained at the Union from 8:30
o'clock to noon and from 8 until 3
o'clock at Crandall's. They will be sold
at the Assembly Hall box office —if
there are any left —beginning at 7
o'clock tomorrow night. Roughs' seats
will be sold then at 75 cents apiece.
