# MOVE FOR JUNIOR COLLEGES ROUSES INTEREST IN EAST
## Mitchell Reports on Trip, Describes Plans Made At Stanford 
### Gunnar Norberg 
''I found a very broad general interest
among the Eastern universities in the
development of the junior college," said
Professor'J. P. Mitchell, University Reg
istrar, on his return from an Eastern
trip recently.
Johns Hopkins University is the only
in titution which has definitely signified
its intention to abolish the lower division
although others are much interested in the
discussion concerning its elimination, ac
cording to Professor Mitchell. Professor
Dempster, registrar at Johns Hopkins,
read a paper on the "Adaptation of the
University to the Junior College," at the
registrars' convention held last month at
Atlanta, Georgia.
In connection with the tentative plan to
abolish the lower division at Stanford,
Professor Mitchell said that because so
many students are attempting to secure
admission into Stanford the total en
rollment would not change if the work
<>i the freshman and sophomore years
were eliminated. Concerning the effect of
such a change on the athletic prospects
of the University, Professor Mitchell
stated that there would be 500 more men
from whom positions on the various var-j
sity teams could be filled. At present the
S(H) freshmen cannot try for positions on
the varsity squads. Since there would
still be approximately 2500 men in the
upper division, instead of that number in
cluding freshmen as at present, the ath
letic prowess of Stanford would not be
adversely affected, he believes.
Investigation Made
In a letter written recently by Profes
sor Mitchell in response to an inquiry
concerning the facts proceeding from an
investigation conducted at Stanford on the
junior college problem, he says:
"A detailed comparison has been made
in this office this year of the ability and
achievement of students entering the
upper division of Stanford University
from September, 1923, to June, 1926, from
junior colleges, with that of students en
tering the upper division during the same
period from other institutions, and with
upper division students who took their
entire academic work at Stanford. 1 hi>
junior college group comprised 80 stu
dents (6') men, 20 women) which was
compared with 564 students from other
institutions and with 587 'native Stan
ford' students.
"A comparison of ability on the basis
of the r l horndike intelligence, test -score,
which is required of all undergraduate
entrants, showed that the junior college
entrant- made scores significantly higher
than the native Stanford group, and
slightly higher than those entering from
normal schools, teachers' colleges, stan
dard four-year colleges, or foreign insti
tutions.
Achievement Less
"A comparison of actual achievement
in the University, based however only
upon the record of one year or less,
showed an average scholastic record for
junior college entrants very slightly (con
siderable overlapping ot" probable error)
lower than that of the native Stanford
group and of the group from standard
four year colleges, and considerably lower
than the group from normal scliools and
teachers' colleges.
"A further analysis of the junior col
lege group showed that they furnished a
larger proportion of students with su
perior records and also a larger propor
tion of students with inferior records than
the native Stanford group—but a corre
spondingly smaller proportion of student.-,
with average records.
"When the two groups of students (na
tive Stanford and junior college) were
grouped on the basis of ability as judged
by equivalent Thorndike scores,' only
slight and probably not significant differ
ences in achievement were found, between
comparable groups.
Findings Tentative
"All of these findings with reference to
actual achievement, however, arc tenta
tive and incomplete, since they arc based
only on the records of the junior year,
and need to be completed by following the
same students through their senior year—
a study which is planned for next year.
"A study of 572 members of the graclu
ating class of 1926 showed that of the
group which had entered from junior
colleges, 30 per cent were awarded fitia
honors at Commencement on the basis o
their entire academic record, while tin
distinction came to but 15 per cent of the
class as a whole."
