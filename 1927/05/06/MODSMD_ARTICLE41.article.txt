# DAVIS TO DIRECT THREE SUMMER QUARTER PLAYS
## 
### 
Three plays are being planned for
production during summer quarter by
the Dramatic Council under the direc
tion of Gordon Davis. Tentative dates
for the performances are July 8, July
2'J. and August 12.
A light comeay, a fantasy, and a
drama, in the order named, are tlie
types of plays considered for produc
tion by Davis. As a vehicle for the fan
tastic comedy lie has chosen the "Wis
dom Tooth" by Marc Connelly. The
other two plays have not yet been
decided upon, although Davis is trying
to obtain "Craig's Wife" for the last
production at Stanford under his di
rection before he leaves for a year's
tour of the East and Central Europe.
Comedy Chosen
Whimsicality and a bit of sentimen
tality permeate the very elaborate
and spectacular production, the "Wis
dom Tooth," which has twelve scenes
and carries a cast of about thirty
characters. It is a purposeful little
comedy, with a New York setting, in
volving a clerk in one of the larger
business houses of the great city, and
an obstreperous wisdom tooth that
changes the course of his existence.
The fantastic note is sounded during
a reverie i nwhich he re-lives a por
tion of his past life.
The "Wisdom Tooth" is included in
Burns Mantle's "The Ten Best Plays
of 1925-26," despite the fact that it is
the first play from the pen of Marc
Connelly since the dissolution of his
playwrighting partnership with George
Kaufman. Previously the two collabo
rated most successfully on "To The
Ladies," "Beggar on Horseback,"
"Dulcy," and "Merton of the Movies."
Ambitious Production
"It will be quite the most ambitious
thing of the summer," is Davis' opin
ion of the production. "Summer has
always proved very popular and strong
dramatically," he summarized. "As a
great many serious students come for
special dramatic work during that
time, excellent talen is always avail
able for Summer Quarter productions.

In fact, we usually produce our very
best plays then. 'Hamlet,' 'Arne't We
All,' and "llay Fever' enjoyed great
success last summer. The fact that
dramatics is really the only campus
activity during this quarter also tends
to make productions successful.
"In 'Craig's Wife' we have a power
ful modern drama of married life,
which has enjoyed wide popularity,
including a run of at least two years
in New York."
Davis Leaves in Fall
Davis plans to leave the campus in
September on his tour of the East and
Europe for the purpose of studying
stage technique. He lias been Dra
matic Director at Stanford since 1919,
and during the past eight years has
produced more than fifty plays, rang
ing from musical comedy to "Hamlet"
in modern dress, and from the serious
"Hell Bent Fer Heaven" to the fan
tastic comedy of "A Kiss for Cinder
ella."

ful modern drama of married life,
which has enjoyed wide popularity,
including a run of at least two years
in New York."
Davis Leaves in Fall
Davis plans to leave the campus in
September on his tour of the East and
Europe for the purpose of studying
stage technique. He lias been Dra
matic Director at Stanford since 1919,
and during the past eight years has
produced more than fifty plays, rang
ing from musical comedy to "Hamlet"
in modern dress, and from the serious
"Hell Bent Fer Heaven" to the fan
tastic comedy of "A Kiss for Cinder
ella."
Three plays are being planned for
production during summer quarter by
the Dramatic Council under the direc
tion of Gordon Davis. Tentative dates
for the performances are July 8, July
2'J. and August 12.
A light comeay, a fantasy, and a
drama, in the order named, are tlie
types of plays considered for produc
tion by Davis. As a vehicle for the fan
tastic comedy lie has chosen the "Wis
dom Tooth" by Marc Connelly. The
other two plays have not yet been
decided upon, although Davis is trying
to obtain "Craig's Wife" for the last
production at Stanford under his di
rection before he leaves for a year's
tour of the East and Central Europe.
Comedy Chosen
Whimsicality and a bit of sentimen
tality permeate the very elaborate
and spectacular production, the "Wis
dom Tooth," which has twelve scenes
and carries a cast of about thirty
characters. It is a purposeful little
comedy, with a New York setting, in
volving a clerk in one of the larger
business houses of the great city, and
an obstreperous wisdom tooth that
changes the course of his existence.
The fantastic note is sounded during
a reverie i nwhich he re-lives a por
tion of his past life.
The "Wisdom Tooth" is included in
Burns Mantle's "The Ten Best Plays
of 1925-26," despite the fact that it is
the first play from the pen of Marc
Connelly since the dissolution of his
playwrighting partnership with George
Kaufman. Previously the two collabo
rated most successfully on "To The
Ladies," "Beggar on Horseback,"
"Dulcy," and "Merton of the Movies."
Ambitious Production
"It will be quite the most ambitious
thing of the summer," is Davis' opin
ion of the production. "Summer has
always proved very popular and strong
dramatically," he summarized. "As a
great many serious students come for
special dramatic work during that
time, excellent talen is always avail
able for Summer Quarter productions.

In fact, we usually produce our very
best plays then. 'Hamlet,' 'Arne't We
All,' and "llay Fever' enjoyed great
success last summer. The fact that
dramatics is really the only campus
activity during this quarter also tends
to make productions successful.
"In 'Craig's Wife' we have a power
ful modern drama of married life,
which has enjoyed wide popularity,
including a run of at least two years
in New York."
