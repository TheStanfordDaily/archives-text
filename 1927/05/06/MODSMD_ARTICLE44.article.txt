# STANFORD INSTRUCTOR URGES EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN COLLEGE
## 
### 
Stanford ranks third among Ameri
can universities having "productive
electrical engineering departments,"
show figures given by Frederick E.
Tennan, Stanford engineering instruc
tor. in his article, "The Electrical En
gineering Research Situation in the
American Universities" in the current
issue of "Science."
Massachusetts Institute of Techno
logy and Johns Hopkins lead Stanford,
the basis of comparison being re
search contributions published during
the past five years. However, Ter
man says,"The proportion of produc
tive electrical research coming from
the colleges is surprisingly small." Ho
urges more stress on research work.
