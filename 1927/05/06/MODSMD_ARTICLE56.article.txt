# IMPROVEMENTS PLANNED ON SEARSVILLE GROUNDS
## 
### 
Searsville Lake Park, in the hills
back of Stanford, will be the scene of
increased activity during the coming
summer. Under the direction of Ernst
Brandsten, nationally famed aquatic
coach, many improvements have been
made at the lake.
Stanford University has completed
the purchase, from the Spring Valley
Water Company, of an additional 140
acres of land which lies on the west
side of the lake. This gives the Uni
versity clear title to 350 acres of land,
including the area of the lake.
New Road Available
This acquisition of land gives ac
cess to a new direct road to Sears
ville from the Woodside-Portola high
way, which in turn shortens the dis
tance from the campus to the lake.
The Sandy Hill road has already been
improved.
New improvements include the re
moval of all bathing and boating ac
commodations to the west side of the
lake. New dressing rooms of concrete
structure with tile showers have been
built. Additional rafts, diving equip
ment, and swimming facilities have
been installed. Several trails for
hikers have been laid out, and all the
roads throughout the grounds have
been improved as well as new ones
built. Two miles of pipe have been laid
in order to provide drinking water
throughout the grounds.
Camping Facilities Good
Searsville Lake Park is equipped to
handle campers as well as those
merely going for a day's outing. Saddle
horses and pack horses may be rented
and the services of experienced guides
may be secured by those wishing to
take trips into the surrounding coun
try.
Ernst Brandsten, who is in charge
at Searsville, has been actively en
gaged in improving the park for the
last five years. During the past winter
the University has constructed a fine
residence for him on the grounds.
Brandsten has arranged for two div

ing championships, two or three swim
ming meets, and a rodeo, all to be
held during the summer to make the
resort additionally attractive.
Fishing Assured
Searsville lake has recently been
stocked with bass so that the day is
not far away when good fishing can
be enjoyed, along with boating, swim
ming, picnicing, barbecues, and lake
parties. There are seating facilities
and tables to accommodate 3000 peo
ple. Fire places are provided and wood
may be obtained near at hand for
patrons wishing to do their own cook
ing. The grounds are wired through
out with electric lights.
