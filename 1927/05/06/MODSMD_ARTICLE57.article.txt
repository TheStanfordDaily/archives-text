# VARIED SOCIAL LIFE FEATURE OF COMING QUARTER'S ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
With a smoker for the men students
the first week of the summer quarter,
a series of receptions to the faculty
and students, summer dances at Toyon
and Roble, dances after the plays
sponsored by the Dramatic Council,
social events will not be neglected
during the Summer Quarter. This is
the conclusion of John A. Sellards,
director of Summer Quarter.
The Department of Education will
hold weekly luncheons while Warren
D. Allen will conduct group singing if
there are enough to warrant the time.
An organization of graduate students
will endeavor to promote social activi
ties.
Teas to be given at Roble will be
of an informal nature to which all
students and faculty are invited. Sel
lards announced that many additional
social affairs will be arranged later.
