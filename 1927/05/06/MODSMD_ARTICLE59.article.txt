# SUMMER COURSES IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION PLANNED BY STOREY
## Gymnasium, Tennis, Boxing, Included in Sports Schedule 
### 
A larger number of courses than
have ever been open in the past in
the various sports will be offered this
summer quarter by the Physical Edu
cation department, it was announced
yesterday by Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
director of Encina Gymnasium.
Courses in swimming, tennis, box
ing, gymnastics, and other sports
given during the regular sessions of
the University will be included.
In commenting upon the new plans
of the department, Dr. Storey stated,
"Work in the Physical Education de
partment at Stanford is now in a
transitional and developmental stage.
This summer's work will be helfway
between that of past summers and
what is planned for future years.
Work Important
"I believe that the summer quarter
calls for unusual effort on the part of
the Physical Education department.
People who are unable to attend dur
ing the regular year come here during
that session. They want coaching, ad
vanced instruction, new information
along the latest and most advanced
lines of physical education and direc
torial work."
Summer Quarter draws a majority
of its students from the ranks of
teachers, professors, graduate stu
dents, and others interested in ad
vanced work. For this reason Dr.
Storey believes special efforts should
be made to give them something that
they will be able to put into immedi
ate practice.
