# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
A DOUBLE STAR
Some people can play a fancy game
of tennis, but as skaters they are j
pretty rank. Not Nat Niles, of Boston,
however. He is a fancy skater and
has been a ranking tennis player for
years. Have you ever seen him, clad
in white tennis clothes, volleying and :
thundering liis way about the dark j
green courts, or, clad in a dark skat
ing costunj£, gliding and pirouetting
gracefully about on the white-green j
ice? Versatility is Nat's middle name, j
and he can double in brass on the j
rink or the grass. In other words, he's !
equally nice on the turf or the ice. |
Bill Tilden's name has appeared in !
the lists of the country's first ten!
ranking tennis players nine times, j
But Nathaniel W. Niles has made the !
"First Ten" ten times, and, even j
though he is approaching his forty-'
first birthday, he can still play a very j
good game. Nat ranked eighth in \
190S, fourth in 1909 (above McLougli- j
lin), sixth in '10 and '11, fifth in '12,
sixth again in '13, '15, and '18, ninth
in '20, and tenth in '21. And in 1900,
when he played tennis only two years,

!he won the national interscholastic
j championship.
| So much for the court side of Mr.
j Nile's athletics. Now comes the hard
part, the ice. Do you know what
"rifl's" and "roffs" and "ribs" and
| "robs" are? They are technical names
pertinent to the various curves your
I skates make as you perform the diffi
! cult twisting loops, glides, and circles
pecular to figure-skating, one of the
most graceful of all sports. A lob on
j the tennis courts may be hard to
j master, but a "rob" 011 the ice is much
| more difficult.
1 While Nat Niles will never become
: rich or very famous from his ice act
,ivities, as Red Grange did. nevertlie
i less he was recently chosen to re
; present America at the winter sports
!at the 1928 Olympics. Nat was a
I member of the United States team
!in 1920 and also in 1924. Last Feb
! ruary he won the singles figure-skat
j ing championship of the U. S. A. for
i the fifth time. With Mrs. Theresa
Weld Blancliard, also of Boston, Niles
has won the national pair champion
ship for the last ten years. He's good,
this fellow is!

Some people can play a fancy game
of tennis, but as skaters they are j
pretty rank. Not Nat Niles, of Boston,
however. He is a fancy skater and
has been a ranking tennis player for
years. Have you ever seen him, clad
in white tennis clothes, volleying and :
thundering liis way about the dark j
green courts, or, clad in a dark skat
ing costunj£, gliding and pirouetting
gracefully about on the white-green j
ice? Versatility is Nat's middle name, j
and he can double in brass on the j
rink or the grass. In other words, he's !
equally nice on the turf or the ice. |
Bill Tilden's name has appeared in !
the lists of the country's first ten!
ranking tennis players nine times, j
But Nathaniel W. Niles has made the !
"First Ten" ten times, and, even j
though he is approaching his forty-'
first birthday, he can still play a very j
good game. Nat ranked eighth in \
190S, fourth in 1909 (above McLougli- j
lin), sixth in '10 and '11, fifth in '12,
sixth again in '13, '15, and '18, ninth
in '20, and tenth in '21. And in 1900,
when he played tennis only two years,

!he won the national interscholastic
