# APPOINTMENT OFFICE OFFERS ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING WORK
## 
### 
The Appointment Office engages in an
exceptionally large amount of work dur
ing the Summer Quarter, obtaining both
full- and part-time positions for men and
women.
Last Summer Quarter, when 1,150 stu
dents were enrolled, 737 of them men
and 413 women, records show that 59 per
cent of the men and 19 per cent of the
women were partially or wholly self
supporting. Statistics of the Appointment
Office show that over $7,500 was earned
by students who obtained their jobs
through the office.
Work ranging from "hashing" to secre
tarial positions is available, and the wages
run from board-to over a hundred dol
lars a month. Palo Alto is noted for its
increased activity during the summer
months, and thus provides an increased
number of openings for employment, de
clares Mrs. Snell, Appointment Secretary.
