# TRISECTION OF ANGLE CALLED IMPOSSIBLE BY CAMPUS SAVANTS
## 
### 
"It's sheer nonsense. The trisection of
all angles by use of geometric processes
is impossible," said Professors Rufus L.
Green and Robert E. Allardice, of the
Mathematics Department, when confront
ed with the claim made yesterday by Ber
ticc C. Hastings, Seattle high school
teacher. Hastings says he has solved a
problem which lias been a matter of con
troversy for over 2000 years, but the
campus authorities have little faith in
the claim.
The Seattle man is reported to have
explained the problem with the aid of a
ruler, a compass, and certain established
geometrical principles. He says his pro
cess is too technical to be understood
by the layman without the use of ex
tensive diagrams, but he predicts that its
practical application will be of great value
to engineers, designers, and draughtsmen.
Nevertheless, the Stanford professors
maintain that the feat is impossible. Pro
fessor Allardice thinks the claim just
as absurd as the statement that the moon
is made of green cheese. "By the use of
a geometrical process," he says, "is meant
a process by which only straight lines and
circles are used. Trisecting of an angle
and squaring of a circle can be done in
many ways, but these ways are never
geometrical."
