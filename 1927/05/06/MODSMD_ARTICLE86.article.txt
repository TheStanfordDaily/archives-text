# FOUR DORMITORIES REMAIN OPEN FOR SUMMER STUDENTS
## 
### 
Two men's dormitories and two wo
men's will remain open during the
summer quarter for students. Added
to the men's quarters are
ternities and private homes on the
campus and in Palo Alto.
Toyon Hall and the Union accom
modate about 275 men. Other men
students, with the exception of fresh
men, are allowed to live wherever
they can find room. The only restric
tion on freshmen is that they cannot
live on the Row.
Nearly 260 women find quarters in
Ruble and Madrono halls. A few sorori
ties and private homes take women as
boarders. Freshman women must stay
at Roble, however.
The Roble dining halls and the main
dining room of the Union cafeteria,
together with the "Roost," will be the
only places where food is obtainable.
LTp to eighteen hundred meals can
be served each day in the Union, al
though the usual amount equals about
nine hundred. At Roble all the women
living there will be served three times
a day, at a charge of $90 for jthe quar
ter. The Union, giving regular cafe
teria service, will provide especially
low-priced meals.
