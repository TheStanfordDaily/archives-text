# MINNESOTA PHYSICIST TO DISCUSS RECENT DISCOVERIES IN FIELD
## 
### 
Offering a course in the New Quantum
Mechanics in the Stun ford Physics de
partment this summer, Dr. John Has
brouck Van Vleck of Minnesota Univer
sity will discuss a subject so recent that
information of it was not available in
the Encyclopedia Britannica until the most

recent additional volumes were printed, j
Nearly all information on the Quantum I
Theory of Atomic Structure has been,
published since 1925.
The visiting professor is himself the
author of a book on the Quantum Theory. \
Modern Physics, a course on the dis-'
coveries of the last few decades on the
nature of matter and energy, will also
be given by Dr. Van Vleck this summer.
Since 1923 Dr. Van Vleck has been at j
the University of Minnesota, where he is
now associate professor. Previous to this
he was instructor in physics at Harvard. I
He has studied with two world authori-,
ties who have developed the Quantum:
Theory, Max Born at Copenhagen and |
Arnold Sommerfield in Germany.
