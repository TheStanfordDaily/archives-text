Sequoia Wins League IV
Sequoia captured the title in League
IV by its 6 to 5 victory over the Phi
Kappa Sigma nine in the best game of
the afternoon. After leading through
out the entire game, the Phi Kaps
weakened in the last half of the final
inning and allowed the Sequoia team
to put over the tieing and winning
runs.
The Phi Kaps started out with a
rush and scored four runs in the first
inning. Another in the third gave
them a H to 4 lead at the beginning of
the final frame. Sequoia then started a
rally, and two men crossed the plate
with the winning runs after one out
had been made. Quinn did the hurling
for Sequoia, and Edmunds and Evans
divided the mound work for the Phi
Kaps.
El Toro Triumphs
El Toro won from Alpha Sigma Phi
in a not too exciting contest as the
game was marked by a number of
errors and rather ragged playing. El
Toro tallied three times in the first
half of the first inning to sew up the
game almost before it had started.
Two more were scored in the third,
while the Alpha Sigs scored their two
in this frame also.
Encina II Defaults
Encina II failed to appear on the
field so El Cuadro won by default. The
Phi Delta Theta-Encina IV game was
called off by mutual consent of both
teams due to fraternity bidding and
unsettled weather.
Sequoia and El Tigre will battle on
the varsity field tonight in the first
playoff game, while five other games,
postponed from the rainy spell a few
weeks ago, are scheduled for the four
intramural and Sequoia diamonds.
Tie Game Scheduled
The Sequoia diamond will be re
served for the Sigma Nil's and Theta
Delta Chi's in order that they may
play off a tie game. These two teams
are now tied for second place in
League 11, and the winner today will
go into a tie for first place with Chi
Psi.
The schedule of today's games is as
follows:
Diamond No. I—Alpha1—Alpha Tau Omega

The Phi Kaps started out with a
rush and scored four runs in the first
inning. Another in the third gave
them a H to 4 lead at the beginning of
the final frame. Sequoia then started a
rally, and two men crossed the plate
with the winning runs after one out
had been made. Quinn did the hurling
for Sequoia, and Edmunds and Evans
divided the mound work for the Phi
Kaps.
El Toro Triumphs
El Toro won from Alpha Sigma Phi
in a not too exciting contest as the
game was marked by a number of
errors and rather ragged playing. El
Toro tallied three times in the first
half of the first inning to sew up the
game almost before it had started.
Two more were scored in the third,
while the Alpha Sigs scored their two
in this frame also.
Encina II Defaults
Encina II failed to appear on the
field so El Cuadro won by default. The
Phi Delta Theta-Encina IV game was
called off by mutual consent of both
teams due to fraternity bidding and
unsettled weather.
Sequoia and El Tigre will battle on
the varsity field tonight in the first
playoff game, while five other games,
postponed from the rainy spell a few
weeks ago, are scheduled for the four
intramural and Sequoia diamonds.
Tie Game Scheduled
The Sequoia diamond will be re
served for the Sigma Nil's and Theta
Delta Chi's in order that they may
play off a tie game. These two teams
are now tied for second place in
League 11, and the winner today will
go into a tie for first place with Chi
Psi.
The schedule of today's games is as
follows:
Diamond No. I—Alpha1—Alpha Tau Omega
vs. Zeta Psi.
Diamond No. 2 —Theta Chi vs. Delta
Tau Delta.
Diamond No. 3 —Beta Theta Pi vs.
Alpha Delta Phi.
Diamond No. 4 —El Campo vs. El
Cuadro.
Sequoia—Sigma Nu vs. Theta Delta
Chi.
