# LAWRENCE STRAUSS, WELL-KNOWN TENOR, TO SING ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Lawrence Strauss, San Francisco I
tenor of world renown, will give a j
recital at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow night j
j in the Assembly Hall, presenting a;
I program of German and French num-l
; hers and two groups of English folk j
j songs. He will be accompanied on the j
j piano by Elizabeth Alexander.
Strauss, who is conceded by critics j
I to be the most engaging tenor in the ;
ii
I West, has sung before London and j
j New York audiences and has appeared i
as co-artist with .Schumann-Heink, j
Alice Gentle, Povla Frijsh, Eva Gau-1
tier, Tina Lerner, Claire Dux, Mario |
Chamlee, and others. He is noted both j
for bis "rare gift of interpretation" j
and his "style."
As a tenor Strauss has a voice
strongly suggestive of the baritone;
his high range is not purely lyric, nor
yet robust. He is said to have an ,
unusually clear diction and a sensitive j
comprehension of how to sing his
j chosen songs.
I From London come reports that he
has a "tenor voice of full and reso
nant quality. He sings easily and
phrases well, and he gave genuine j
pleasure in songs of many styles, from J
lieder to traditional airs."
