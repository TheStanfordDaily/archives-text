# A 						Stanford Production
## 
### 
Wicked William was born and raised on the Stanford campus, and he
is a member of the Class of 1928. lie is a true son of Stanford, although
his stay on the campus was..rather short. Saturday night he made his
first and last public appearance, and now he takes his place among the
respected alumni.
The fact that the Junior Opera was written and acted by under
graduates is significant. The plot was the best that has been originated
at Stanford, if our information is correct. The music was by far the
best that has been composed for any former Stanford production. Most
of the acting was good. And the whole opera was received by a most
appreciative audience.
"Wicked William" has possibilities of a popular success about the
United States. The comedy needs perfection, and the chorus needs more
practice, but when it is remembered that Gordon Davis had only about
a month to coach the actors and actresses and Frances Boone had the same
length of time to teach the choruses their steps, the results were really
surprising.
It has become a habit of universities to send football and other athletic
teams about the country demonstrating their wares, and to send glee clubs
and bands about the United States, along with debaters and student body
presidents. Why not send a musical play that is written and acted by
students? It's as truly a student activity as any of the other enterprises.
