Following is a letter by Dickenson, chairman of the appeal:
"Today marks the beginning of a two-day drive to secure really
needed funds for the Stanford Convalescent Home. Here forty children
are maintained and given the privilege of living in the same healthful
surroundings as you and I. They come to us from some fifteen hospitals
and clinics throughout the bay region. They are sent here to develop.
"What do I mean by the word 'develop'? To most of us it means
the training of our minds and bodies to cope with the problems of life;
putting it rather coldly, it means equipping ourselves to carry on in the
great struggle for existence. But on the other hand, the Struggle for
Existence as implied has never gathered many Stanford students into its
fold—this includes the self-supporting students as well.
"We come here endowed with good health, which brings us back to
the word 'develop' as understood by our little Convalescent Home friends.
Child for child it would be safe to say that the greater percentage of these
children are as well endowed as we were except for physical handicaps.
"They arc victims of circumstances; we were born lucky. Take two
examples: The mother of a good intelligent and respectable family be
comes a widow; she is forced to seek employment; shortly afterward her
little four-year-old son has both legs broken while playing in the street.
The mother can't stay home and nurse him; neither can his little eleven
year-old sister. Now, since the mother must earn a livelihood, and since
it is out of the question to retain the services of a nurse, isn't it a nice
solution if her little son can be sent to a nice, big, comfortable mansion
like Senator Stanford's old home, there to receive the services of Palo
Alto's doctors free of charge, to receive good, well-balanced food, to be
instructed in kindergarten work, and last, but not least, the mother has
been allowed to suffer the minimum anxiety?
"Take another case: A little girl, a victim of malnutrition, insufficient
vitamins. Result—swollen joints, rickets. So easily cured under the
right sort of treatment, then sent back home, or, perhaps, put in an
orphanage.
"1 he fact is, fellow students, that some of our children might be
victims of circumstances. Aren't we willing to forego a movie, a choc
malt, a packagae of cigarettes, in order to promote and carry on such
a worth-while, constructive work? The Convalescent Home is an integral
part of Stanford. Show what it means to you by giving until it hurts,
and 011 top of that do a good half-day's manual labor next Wednesday
afternoon."
Sincerely yours,
CHARLES DICKENSON
Chairman, Stanford Convalescent Home Appeal Committee.
