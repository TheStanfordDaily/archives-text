Of the two hundred and forty fresh
men receiving bids this season, all but
twenty pledged on the formal day set
aside for the purpose. Of this twenty,
some will pledge shortly. In addition
to that, more men will be pledged be
fore the spring quarter is over.
It was remarked in this column on
a previous occasion, and it is here re
marked again. Whatever else can be
said for the Greek letter organiza
tions, a startlingly large percentage
of students go into them voluntarily.
Propaganda circulated concerning '
their unpopularity with the students is |
pure hooey.

We have waited until rushing sea
son was over to make some of these I
remarks for fear of being accused of
ballyhooing. Now that the dust has
settled and the fraternities have their
classes, it is not indiscreet to state a ;
few relevant facts, particularly since
those facts will never come to the
attention of next year's freshmen.
The history of student social or- j
ganization at Stanford is a particular-1
ly satisfactory story. Without undue |
influence from anyone, the undergradu-;
ates in the early days organized along j
lines best suited to their tempera-:
ments.
In addition to the fraternities and
sororities common to most college
campi, the local students organized |

eating clubs that are still, with two
exceptions, in existence today. The
exceptions became fraternities. To off
set these is the story of one club re- 1
fusing the offer of a charter from one
of the oldest and most distinguished
fraternities in the country.
However, we are wandering from
the point. That point was that at the
present time there are firmly estab
lished organizations offering nearly
every conceivable type of student life, ■
with varying degrees of individual
; freedom. And there is an allowance
! made for complete freedom from any
! organization whatsoever.
Hardly a campus in the country can
boast of haviug made such a conscien-
I tious effort to meet the problem of
i student social organization. Today j
there are even rules forbidding undue
coercion of freshmen in rushing for
| the various groups.
Stanford today stands at the thresh-;
hold of a new epoch in her history, j
J Some adjustment may be necessary
j in the matter of living groups as well
as in other matters. Let us hope that
' the same sanity and forethought that
: characterized the organization of the
first students on the campus will pre
j vail in the future. Let us hope that if
! the fraternities are able to survive |
they be allowed to survive, and if they
: are not that they be not artificially I
I maintained. —Stephen O'Donnell.
