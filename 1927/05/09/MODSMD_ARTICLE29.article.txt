KEEPING THE HOUSE
EXCLUSIVE
Being the candid history of the
Kappa Rho Alpha Pi house during
rushing season at Fordstan University.!
First Week —
Rush ninety men.
Second Week—
Rush forty men.
Third Week —
Rush the ears off twenty men. Eats,
shows, talk —and so on.
Committee chairman proposes the
names of twenty-five, padding the list
a little to give the chronic knockers a
chance to ease their feeling with j
blackballs.
Excited session lasting late. Chair-1
man pleads amid fog of smoke for the j
brothers for godsake to be reasonable
once and not pass up these perfectly
luscious nuggets!
Brothers for some reason unknown
become suddenly most select in their (
tastes. The famous speech beginning: |
"Ill's a good enough fellow and I don't
dislike him myself, but " is again
heard in the land.
Much dinging as of knells while the ;
rushing committee weeps in a corner.

| Bids at last sent out to sixteen,
i Three pledge.
j (Subsequently the brothers publicly
i proclaim the exclusive three to be the
j pick of the class; privately, the whole
; blame is shifted to the twitching shoul
j ders of the rushing committee —and
j normal life resumes again.)

Fable: The fellow down the hall
stumbled in about 9:30 a.m., Sunday.
I "Believe it or not," he said, "I lost my

: to wait for daylight." His roommate
believed him.
