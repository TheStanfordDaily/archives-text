## 
### 
OBERLIN, Ohio (LP.). â€” Although j
the college authorities recently placed a J
han 011 midnight serenading at Obcrlin :
College, the students arc going to have 1
their tradition. Soon after the college
had announced that it had requested vil
lage authorities to enforce the ancient
ordinance against disturbing the peace of
this village after 11 p.m., a group of j
students appeared under the windows of 1
a women's dormitory at 6:30 p.m., and !
while the sun shone sang lustily to the j
co-eds in the windows above, at the same j
time strumming banjos and guitars.
Placards stuck in the grass about the 1
singers poked fun at the new ruling. "Our
mammas say we must go to bed early,"
read one, while another explained that "If
we can't sing to the moon, there's always
the sun."
