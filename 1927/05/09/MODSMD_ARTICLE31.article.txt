## 
### 
Helen Wills, tennis star from the
University of California, left Berkeley
yesterday for the East. She will sail
for England in a short time for the
Wimbledon Tournament. Unable to
compete in the women's nationals last
year because of the effects of an ap
pendicitis operation, she lost her title
to Molla Mallory. In an attempt to
stage a "come-back" she will play first
in the Wimbledon Tournament, and
then in several other English and
continental tourneys.
