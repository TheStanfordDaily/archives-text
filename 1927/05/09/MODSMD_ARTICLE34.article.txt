# ATTENDANCE AT HIGH SCHOOL STEADILY ON INCREASE SAYS BOLT
## 
### 
Non-attendance in high had
a steady decline in the past eight years,
according to a study of attendance rec
ords made by Professor Richard A. Bolt
of the child hygiene department of the
University of California.
Dr. Bolt has made a detailed study of
the records of attendance at the Univer
sity High School, which afford an es r
pecially good field as they are complete
and uniform. The result of this study
has just been published in an article in
the University High School Journal.
Attendance Increases
"There has been a regular decrease in
the percentage of non-attendance at the
University High School for both boys and
girls over the entire period 1919-20 to
1926-27. An especially large drop took
place between 1923 and 1924. This can
be accounted for to some extent by the
aftermath of the influenza epidemic and
by the closing of the schools for a period
on account of the smallpox situation,"
according to Dr. Bolt.
Dr. Bolt ends his article by saying, "It
is reasonable to expect that a complete,
full rounded health program, including a
linking up of all the facilities for health
education with an adequate medical and
nursing service, would not only further
the reduction of absenteeism but also add
to the health and efficiency of the whole
student body."
