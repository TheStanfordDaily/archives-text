# GEORGIA PUBLICATION SAYS ATHLETES GET TOO MUCH ATTENTION
## 
### 
The University of Georgia gives its
athletes too much attention, the Icono
clast, men's student publication at that
university, has just announced. "Athletes
who are endowed with scholarships of
free tuition and spending money by pa
triotic alumni and come to college, win
their letter in sports, enjoy the company
of co-eds, and occasionally attend classes,
are spending money that could be used
more beneficially for the good of the
'spindly-shanked scholar,'" the paper
claims.
"To spend $200,000 for a useless sta
dium, colossal in proportions, and not one
red cent for a much-needed dormitory, is
one of the biggest incongruities of the
decade." The Iconoclast claimed that the
Red and Black, regular student publica
tion, fails to publish certain happenings
which should be published, including the
proposed expenditure for the athletic sta
dium. >
