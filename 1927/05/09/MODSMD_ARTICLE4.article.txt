# 'WICKED WILLIAM' PROVES NEAT INFORMAL COMEDY
## 
### Staff Reviewer 
Speaking of hits and such, the
Junior Opt ra took possession Satur
day night in the presentation in the
Assembly Hall of an elaborate, loose
jointed hut withal fairly routine musi
cal comedy, smacking more than a
little of the variety halls. The name
of the piece, "Wicked William," did i
little to enlighten you toward the na- J
ture of the show.
The authors, Winston Norman and ;
Frank Baker, fashioned a charming i
comedy, informal and neat, but little j
more than an incident in its dramatic i
value. Their play and Jean Wakefield's ;
lyric axul music tell the story of a j
very successful campus production.!
From the dramatic point of view, j
"Wicked William" was not so ideas-'
ing. Too long for so mild a theme, al- j
most as verbose as the gentlemen it,
portrayed, leisurely directed, it pro-!
gressed more like an animated pano-;
rama. The directors were ambitious j
with their costuming and scenery; and •

if "Wicked William" stimulated the
ear with its music it pleased the eye
no less thoroughly.
Score Distinguished
The authors' score was sufficiently
distinguished to require the exposi
tion of good music, rather than dra
matic commentators. The musical
; score accented the prancing rhythms
j of jazz, and the score included sev
j eral lyrical and solos, accord
j ing to the mood of the play. As the
! lovely Isabella Potter, Dorothy Gar
j nier's singing was pleasing, and her
! voice has considerable range. In sev
' eral becoming passages she acted the
role of tlie blushless wife. Hers was ai
! valid impersonation and was frequent
[ ly believable enough to overcome its
, glazed surroundings. As she slowly
discovered her husband's radical egg
; theories did not apply to her own fire
side and her esthetic friends she added
needed honesty to the theme.
Kathleen Fitz, representing a wliole
_
j some and beautiful telephone girl, ad
] dieted to the movies, was, as is her
practice, good in her part. Nothing
could have set off in higher relief the
perfections of Kathleen Fitz than her
singing of "Bran' New Man" and "Sing
A Little Song." She sang beautifully
I with a sweet, earnest sincerity.
' Charles Moore, as the husband,
failed to perform zestfully at times,
j and his contributions, for the most
i part, were not up to standard. Arthur
Hurt as Bulwar Buc-howitz, the Holly
wood temperamental producer, came
to grip in the last act, and gave a good
exhibition in any quantity of audible,
tense, reticent, first-clenching, and lip
biting directing.
At last a women's yell leader has
been found, for Helena Duryea, with
her gesticulations and "mellow or
ange" tones, took full advantage of
her role and produced an effect that,
while a trifle overacted at times, was
very humorous. Another character that
could have been used more to good
advantage was Paul Spppgle, in the
part of Oscar, the stuttering bell-hop.
His acting was always consistent, and
his "motorcycling" was clever.
Among the alleviating features also
listed in the production were the chor
uses staged with opulence and unim
peachable good taste and the dancing,
which was ingeniously worked out and
well staged. Among the happily danc
ing performers were Don Marquis and
Joe Diet rick, Barbara Eubanks, Laura
Miller, Frances Boone, and Ferdinand
Mendenhall, all affording applause for
encores. Hose Taff's singing of "Poor
Black Butterfly" was one of the best
numbers on the program.
As a whole, the show was natural
and unspoiled by rehearsals. It ex
hibited none of the blighting marks of
painstaking calculation, no evidence of
having been made sterile by too much
preparation, but only the fine, spon
taneous carelessness of a show that
was unaffected and vivacious. There
was in it the amateurs' scorn for being |
confined to the merely skillful.

was in it the amateurs' scorn for being |
confined to the merely skillful.
Speaking of hits and such, the
Junior Opt ra took possession Satur
day night in the presentation in the
Assembly Hall of an elaborate, loose
jointed hut withal fairly routine musi
cal comedy, smacking more than a
little of the variety halls. The name
of the piece, "Wicked William," did i
little to enlighten you toward the na- J
ture of the show.
The authors, Winston Norman and ;
Frank Baker, fashioned a charming i
comedy, informal and neat, but little j
more than an incident in its dramatic i
value. Their play and Jean Wakefield's ;
lyric axul music tell the story of a j
very successful campus production.!
From the dramatic point of view, j
"Wicked William" was not so ideas-'
ing. Too long for so mild a theme, al- j
most as verbose as the gentlemen it,
portrayed, leisurely directed, it pro-!
gressed more like an animated pano-;
rama. The directors were ambitious j
with their costuming and scenery; and •

if "Wicked William" stimulated the
ear with its music it pleased the eye
no less thoroughly.
Score Distinguished
The authors' score was sufficiently
distinguished to require the exposi
tion of good music, rather than dra
matic commentators. The musical
; score accented the prancing rhythms
j of jazz, and the score included sev
j eral lyrical and solos, accord
j ing to the mood of the play. As the
! lovely Isabella Potter, Dorothy Gar
j nier's singing was pleasing, and her
! voice has considerable range. In sev
' eral becoming passages she acted the
role of tlie blushless wife. Hers was ai
! valid impersonation and was frequent
[ ly believable enough to overcome its
, glazed surroundings. As she slowly
discovered her husband's radical egg
; theories did not apply to her own fire
side and her esthetic friends she added
needed honesty to the theme.
Kathleen Fitz, representing a wliole
_
j some and beautiful telephone girl, ad
] dieted to the movies, was, as is her
practice, good in her part. Nothing
could have set off in higher relief the
perfections of Kathleen Fitz than her
singing of "Bran' New Man" and "Sing
A Little Song." She sang beautifully
I with a sweet, earnest sincerity.
' Charles Moore, as the husband,
failed to perform zestfully at times,
j and his contributions, for the most
i part, were not up to standard. Arthur
Hurt as Bulwar Buc-howitz, the Holly
wood temperamental producer, came
to grip in the last act, and gave a good
exhibition in any quantity of audible,
tense, reticent, first-clenching, and lip
biting directing.
At last a women's yell leader has
been found, for Helena Duryea, with
her gesticulations and "mellow or
ange" tones, took full advantage of
her role and produced an effect that,
while a trifle overacted at times, was
very humorous. Another character that
could have been used more to good
advantage was Paul Spppgle, in the
part of Oscar, the stuttering bell-hop.
His acting was always consistent, and
his "motorcycling" was clever.
Among the alleviating features also
listed in the production were the chor
uses staged with opulence and unim
peachable good taste and the dancing,
which was ingeniously worked out and
well staged. Among the happily danc
ing performers were Don Marquis and
Joe Diet rick, Barbara Eubanks, Laura
Miller, Frances Boone, and Ferdinand
Mendenhall, all affording applause for
encores. Hose Taff's singing of "Poor
Black Butterfly" was one of the best
numbers on the program.
As a whole, the show was natural
and unspoiled by rehearsals. It ex
hibited none of the blighting marks of
painstaking calculation, no evidence of
having been made sterile by too much
preparation, but only the fine, spon
taneous carelessness of a show that
was unaffected and vivacious. There
was in it the amateurs' scorn for being |
confined to the merely skillful.
