# 'WICKED WILLIAM' PROVES NEAT INFORMAL COMEDY
## 
### Staff Reviewer 
Speaking of hits and such, the
Junior Opt ra took possession Satur
day night in the presentation in the
Assembly Hall of an elaborate, loose
jointed hut withal fairly routine musi
cal comedy, smacking more than a
little of the variety halls. The name
of the piece, "Wicked William," did i
little to enlighten you toward the na- J
ture of the show.
The authors, Winston Norman and ;
Frank Baker, fashioned a charming i
comedy, informal and neat, but little j
more than an incident in its dramatic i
value. Their play and Jean Wakefield's ;
lyric axul music tell the story of a j
very successful campus production.!
From the dramatic point of view, j
"Wicked William" was not so ideas-'
ing. Too long for so mild a theme, al- j
most as verbose as the gentlemen it,
portrayed, leisurely directed, it pro-!
gressed more like an animated pano-;
rama. The directors were ambitious j
with their costuming and scenery; and •

if "Wicked William" stimulated the
ear with its music it pleased the eye
no less thoroughly.
Score Distinguished
The authors' score was sufficiently
distinguished to require the exposi
tion of good music, rather than dra
matic commentators. The musical
; score accented the prancing rhythms
j of jazz, and the score included sev
j eral lyrical and solos, accord
j ing to the mood of the play. As the
! lovely Isabella Potter, Dorothy Gar
j nier's singing was pleasing, and her
! voice has considerable range. In sev
' eral becoming passages she acted the
role of tlie blushless wife. Hers was ai
! valid impersonation and was frequent
[ ly believable enough to overcome its
, glazed surroundings. As she slowly
discovered her husband's radical egg
; theories did not apply to her own fire
side and her esthetic friends she added
needed honesty to the theme.
