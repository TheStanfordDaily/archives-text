# DERBY DAY---ONE WEEK AWAY

"It won't be long how" until about]
80,000 pop-eyed enthusiasts jam the j
lioautiful race-course at Churchill
Downs, near Louisville, Kentucky, to
e-heer madly while the fifty-third an-1
»iual derby, most famous of all race '
classics in American turf history, is!
run. On next Saturday afternoon —at !
about five o'clock, to be exact —the
Inirrier will snap and the pick of the i
three-year-olds of America, augmented '
l>y several imported horses, will race
the mile and a quarter that leads to
fame and a blanket of roses for the
winner, and a gold cup, about $60',000
in cash, and more fame, for the win
ner's owner.
Last year, Rubbling Over won the !

| Derby by five lengths from his stable [-
| mate, Baggenbaggage. Both horses
I were from the Idle Hour Farm Stable,
1 owned by E. R. Bradley, the same j
I Col. Bradley who owns the big gamb-
I ling casino at Palm Beach. The
; double triumph of his two "B" beauties
! caused the stoic poker-faced Virginian
the biggest thrill of his life, even!
i greater than when his horses Behave |
I '
Yourself and Black Servant finished
first and second in the same classic
five years before. Only one other man
has owned two Derby winners. He is
George Long. Nearly all of Bradley's j
horses, as you probably know, have'
names that begin with the letter "13."
; Bewithus, Buddy Bauer, Belgenland, '■

! Bit o' Love, 800, M. C. Birley, and
Black and White were nominated by
him last winner for this, the most
j sought-after plum of the American turf.
Horse's names always did interest
me, ever since I suggested a name to
Mr. Alexander Cochran, which he
i used for one of his thoroughbreds.
| In looking over the list of 160 entries,
j of which about thirty will probably
face the barrier on May 14, certain
names catch the eye, appealing either
I to one's imagination or one's sense of
J humor. Names like Enthusiastic Ed
, ward, Indian Love Call, Shasta Bullet,
' and Flying Jib Boom take my fancy
more than such cognomens as Painted
j Lady, Rolled Stocking, Step In, and

The Dago.
There i.s 110 sense in worrying about
the winner—at least not until after
1 the Preakness is run on Monday. It
would he very interesting if the race
! should prove to be an international
duel between The Satrap, Du Pont's
$100,000 importation, and Scapa Flow,
the progeny that most nearly resem
j bles its sire, the famous Man o' War.
Du Pont has another strong bid in
Fair Star, winner of the Pimlico Fu
turity. Only one filly has won the
Derby, H. P. Whitney's Regret in 1915,
hut Mr. Du Pont can take it as a good
omen that two other "Star" horses
have finished first: Day Star in IS7B
and Pink Star in 1907.

$100,000 importation, and Scapa Flow,

Du Pont has another strong bid in
Fair Star, winner of the Pimlico Fu

Derby, H. P. Whitney's Regret in 1915,
