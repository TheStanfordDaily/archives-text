### 
Continuing the tendency shown last
year toward a decrease in the size of
graduating classes, the number of can
didates for degrees at the University
of California this year is 13S less than
in the spring of 1926.
The total of candidates for degrees
to be awarded at Commencement, May
11, is 2219; while last year the total
of candidates was 2357; and in 1925
the total was 2443. On the basis of
these figures, allowing for those who
fail in examinations, the number of
graduates will probably be slightly less
than 2100. Each year a certain per
centage of the candidates, in the past
few years varying between 125 and
200, fail to complete the requirements,
and must postpone their graduation.
