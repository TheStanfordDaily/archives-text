## President Shows Advantages Of Eliminating Lower Division Years 
### 
"Fortunately for us our organization
' is such that we can take leadership
j and promptly use our own initiative,
| since we do not have to wait upon
, political expediency," President Wil
i bur says in restating the desirability
| of the junior college system in a letter
mailed to the alumni and friends of
i the University Saturday.
At the request of various alumni,
i the president has made another state
ment about the abolition of the lower
! division in which he attempts to clear
up the discussion aroused by inaccu
rate press reports. Several thousand
copies of the letter have been sent out.
Stanford Pioneers
Declaring that Stanford has a
chance to pioneer in what is sure to I
1 be a national and natural movement, j
; the president declares, "Since the Uni- j
S versity of "California organized the j
1 lower division nearly twenty years!
; ago, there has been a quiet but sound ;
! growth of the junior college activity
in this state. Now there are practi
; cally as many students doing the work i
J in them which leads up to the junior
| year at Stanford and the state univer
! sity as there are students in the lower
! divisions of these two institutions."
University to Profit
Stanford will profit greatly by the
j change, the letter shows, for three or ,
four years here will give the man who
wants a cultural education the oppor
tunity to really secure it, rather than
to cover the ordinary college course
which has been so blomed for its evi
dent inadequacy. Athletics will be
benefited by the deve'opment of a
school of physical education, and more
men will be available for intercollegi
| ate competition.
In regard to fraternities, Wilbur
Jsays: "They will he in a better posi
i tion to develop as sound organiza
-1
I tions than at present, and the proper
i handling of fraternity affairs at Stan
; ford will give us as strong organiza
tions as there are in the country. In
short, campus life will be fuller and
better than in the past, and a larger
number of students will get a longer
: and better training."
