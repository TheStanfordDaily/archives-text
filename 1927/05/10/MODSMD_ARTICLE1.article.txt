# STANFORD POLO SQUAD LEAVES FOR CORVALLIS
## Hopes for Victory Based on Yesterday's Win Over San Mateo Outfit THREE TEAMS IN MEET Rothrock, Weymouth, Post, Trotter, Thomson to Make Trip 
### 
Leaving at 9 o'clock this morning:,
Mhe Stanford polo squad journeys
north to Corvallis for the annual
Western Conference tourney to be
held there Friday and Saturday. The
Cardinals making the trip are Cap
tain Fred E. Trotter, Chauncey O.
Thomson, Edward H. Post, Frank W.
Rothrock, and Lawrence B. Wey
mouth.
The teams that will be in the meet
besides Stanford are from the Univer
sity of Washington and Oregon Agri
culture College. The Stanford poloists
will meet the Washington players on
Friday and play the Aggie team on
Saturday. This is the first time that
there will be three schools entered in
the tournament as the University of
"Washington is sending a team, al
though there is no R.O.T.C. unit lo
cated there.
To Use O.A.C. Mounts
The Stanford men will use the
O.A.C. mounts which.may prove either
a handicap or an aiding factor. They
■will arrive at Corvallis Thursday after
noon and will have little time to get
accustomed to their ponies before the
matches.
By winning the Pacific Low Goal
and Novice Tournament yesterday, the
Cardinal poloists feel hopeful of being
able to return with the conference
cup. By the 5 to 4 victory over the
San Mateo team yesterday, Stanford
came up from a seemingly hopeless
position to make three goals in the
seventh period and to win over a well
balanced and strong team. Tevis and
Eliralde, riding for San Mateo, are
considered two of the best players in
this part of the country. Saturday, the
Cardinals won by a larger score of
14 to 4.
Washington Weak
Another reason that the Cardinals
are figuring for a victory is their two
decisive victories over the O.A.C. team
here during the Christmas holidays.
They beat the Aggies 14 to 3 and 12
to 1. The Washington team is not
counted on for great strength due to
the newness of the sport at that uni
versity.
