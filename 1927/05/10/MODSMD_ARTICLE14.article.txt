# GENERATOR INSTALLED AT AIR LABORATORY; NEW CAMPUS SERVICE
## 
### 
The Guggenheim Aeronautic Labora
tory, which for the past several
months had been using the main part
of the current generated by the 150-
kilowatt generator in the sub-station,
has been given the generator for its
own. Connections were switched yes
terday morning, and the new source
of electricity for campus service, a
General Electric 30-kilowatt motor
generator, was put in operation.
The location of the new unit is tem
porary, for the big motor will be
moved Into the Guggenheim building.
The complete installation will be com
pleted in a short time. It will be neces
sary to construct, new foundations in
the laboratory, and change nil the wir
ing. Until the work has been com
pleted. the small generator in its tem
porary location will be able to supply
all the necessary current.
