# TROJAN GLEE CLUB IN RECITAL TODAY
## Singing Will Take Place in Court of Old Union At 4 O'clock 
### 
This afternoon at 4 o'clock the Uni
versity of Southern California Glee
Club will give a program in the Union
Court. This is a reciprocal action fol
lowing the appcarance of the Stanford
Glee Club before the Trojan student
body last spring recess. The U.S.C.
club is on its Oregon tour, with con
certs at way points, accompanied by
the university band.
The repertoire of the Trojans in
cludes both classical and modern num
bers. The program is composed of a
group of college songs, including a
medley of those of the Pacific Coast
universities, some popular numbers,
and some classics. The band will not
play this afternoon.
The Stanford Glee Club was the
second one in the United States to do
away entirely with the "rah-rah" pro
gram and adopt the more classical
kind. Now all the Western colleges
are following Stanford's lead, and part
of U.S.C.'s program will be composed
of numbers similar to those sung by
the University club.
The concert is open to the public.
No admission will be charged.
