# ALLEN WILL RENDER BORODIN, KORSAKOW NUMBERS ON ORGAN
## 
### 
Five selections will be played by
i Warren D. Allen, University organist,
for his regular recital at 4:15 o'clock
I this afternoon. Perhaps the most in
; teresting composition will be Boro
din's "In the Steppes of Central Asia."
; Russian folk songs and melancholy
Oriental melodies are cleverly em
ployed by the composer to depict a
| scene on the central Asiatic steppes.
"Hymn to the Sun," by Rimsky Kor
sakow, will also be featured by Allen.
Like other Korsakow compositions
; the "Hymn to the Sun" has been popu-
I larized by Paul Whiteman. "Within a
i Chinese Garden," by R. S. Stoughton,
and "Spring," by Herbert Hyde, are
two dainty songs that are a direct
! contrast to "Rhapsody in D Major"
l by Rosetta G. Cole.
