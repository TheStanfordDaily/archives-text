# Reviewing the Review
## 
### 
Wicked Williams' boy and girl friends registered protests against
1 iie Stanford Daily in general and the Stall Reviewer in particular,
because of the report of the Junior Opera that appeared in yesterday's
issue of the paper. The actors and others claimed that the article is not
fair and does not give credit where credit is due.
In the past certain reviewers have believed it was their duty to praise
every phase of campus plays merely because they were Stanford pro
ductions. Any "boots" on the part of the characters always happened
when the reporter was looking in the other direction. This attitude of
overlooking all faults is just as wrong as severely criticizing the show
from curtain to curtain. But there is a happy medium that should be
aimed for by all reviewers.
The reviewers must take into consideration the limited length of time
that is available for rehearsing a campus production. They must realize
that it is an amateur affair and cannot be compared to a finished profes
sionl play. It is true also that the show is presented before a rather
appreciative and amateur audience, which is not too critical for it knows
a few of the actors or actresses personally.
It should be remembered that a signed review is merely the opinion
of one person. No two accounts of the merits or of the faults of any
production are alike. This fact is evident when one is asking the opinion
of another concerning a particular moving picture show. Half the
campus will say the movie was poor, while the others will praise the
acting and plot to the skies. It is because of this reason that the campus
newspaper gives nothing but favorable comments on a campus show
before the evening of the performance. Each student should be allowed
to attend and decide for himself whether the play is good or bad.
The large producers in New York at one time objected to newspaper
reviews. They claimed an unfavorable review of a new show would
mean disaster the production and would cost them thousands of
dollars. And if tfic general public wants to accept a reviewer's opinion
of the show and to plan its amusements accordingly, the objection is a
sound one. But one person's objections should not be enough to ruin a
clever production, and it probably does not. If the show is so thoroughly
rotten that all reviewers are of the same opinion, the play should be
suspended and so save the public its ticket money.
Yesterday's review of "Wicked William" had its share of criticism,
both favorable and unfavorable. The reviewer did not sit down to write
the account of the production with a program before him and then pro
ceed to hunt through his memory and see what favorable comments
could be made about each and every person connefcted with the Opera.
That system of reporting campus productions has been used in the past,
but it is hoped that it will not be done in the future.

reviews. They claimed an unfavorable review of a new show would
mean disaster the production and would cost them thousands of
dollars. And if tfic general public wants to accept a reviewer's opinion
of the show and to plan its amusements accordingly, the objection is a
sound one. But one person's objections should not be enough to ruin a
clever production, and it probably does not. If the show is so thoroughly
rotten that all reviewers are of the same opinion, the play should be
suspended and so save the public its ticket money.
Yesterday's review of "Wicked William" had its share of criticism,
both favorable and unfavorable. The reviewer did not sit down to write
the account of the production with a program before him and then pro
ceed to hunt through his memory and see what favorable comments
could be made about each and every person connefcted with the Opera.
That system of reporting campus productions has been used in the past,
but it is hoped that it will not be done in the future.
Wicked Williams' boy and girl friends registered protests against
1 iie Stanford Daily in general and the Stall Reviewer in particular,
because of the report of the Junior Opera that appeared in yesterday's
issue of the paper. The actors and others claimed that the article is not
fair and does not give credit where credit is due.
In the past certain reviewers have believed it was their duty to praise
every phase of campus plays merely because they were Stanford pro
ductions. Any "boots" on the part of the characters always happened
when the reporter was looking in the other direction. This attitude of
overlooking all faults is just as wrong as severely criticizing the show
from curtain to curtain. But there is a happy medium that should be
aimed for by all reviewers.
The reviewers must take into consideration the limited length of time
that is available for rehearsing a campus production. They must realize
that it is an amateur affair and cannot be compared to a finished profes
sionl play. It is true also that the show is presented before a rather
appreciative and amateur audience, which is not too critical for it knows
a few of the actors or actresses personally.
It should be remembered that a signed review is merely the opinion
of one person. No two accounts of the merits or of the faults of any
production are alike. This fact is evident when one is asking the opinion
of another concerning a particular moving picture show. Half the
campus will say the movie was poor, while the others will praise the
acting and plot to the skies. It is because of this reason that the campus
newspaper gives nothing but favorable comments on a campus show
before the evening of the performance. Each student should be allowed
to attend and decide for himself whether the play is good or bad.
The large producers in New York at one time objected to newspaper
reviews. They claimed an unfavorable review of a new show would
mean disaster the production and would cost them thousands of
dollars. And if tfic general public wants to accept a reviewer's opinion
