# An Education in Vice

### 
"An education in vice is what students are being taught at collcge"
was the interesting but astonishing statement of Bernarr Macfadden in
a New York paper recently. "Under the guise of biology and psychology
college professors teach so-called 'free love' and 'self-expression.' And
when the doctrine of free love is paraded under the banner of scicnce,
and assisted by booze, the undoing of the young is to be expected."
Macfadden did not enlighten us as to what colleges are giving de
grees in "vice," consequently transferring on such doubtful information
is quite uncertain, bor that matter, his statement gives the impression
that such a course is a universal practice at all colleges. Kansas denies
the assertion, and so do we at Stanford unless there are courses in the
University that have been kept a secret.
The Daily Kansan comments on Macfadden's statements as follows:
"Kansas, true to tradition, seems to be far behind in its educational
program. Ihe schools that Mr, Macfadden loves to talk about make our
beloved K.U. appear as innocent and pure and behind-the-times as Little
Susie Corntassel, who thought that spooning was a course in the home
economics department designed to teach babies how to eat."
In Macfadden's article a society queen of Chicago is quoted as say
ing, "All I got out of my college life was a knowledge of petting parties,
gin, and night life." All we can say to this statement is, "Poor girl, but
heaven will protect you."
But Macfadden has something against the women, for he says,
"Women are to blame, of course, for all the underworld activities. Men
have been blameless ever since Adam set the precedent of blaming wom
en. Gin is delivered at the back door of sorority houses on the day before
big parties." Tf the latter fact is true, the women must have a way with
the bootleggers, for such service as back-door deliveries is not even
known at fraternity houses at Stanford.
