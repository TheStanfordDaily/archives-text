CHARITY
There is such a thing as growing
too used to a good thing. Here at Stan
ford, where the student has the ad
vantage of a temperate climate, ade
quate facilities for exercise, and ample
food, it is hard to realize that there
are many who are not nearly so for
tunate. And it is particularly hard to
realize that quite close to home one
can find any number of examples of
the detrimental effects of improper
living conditions.
The local student body is made up
largely of robust healthy young peoplo
who in their youth were given every
opportunity to develop normally. It is
unfortunate but rather natural, that a
special effort is necessary to call the
attention of the student body to the
urgent need for helping other young

sters not so well off as we ourselves
were in childhood.
Right on the Stanford campus in
the Convalescent Home there are forty
children struggling to overcome the
tremendous handicap of ill health 111
youth. They may have great possibili
ties of developing into useful men
and women. But those possibilities
will go to waste unless they are given
an opportunity to become well and
strong.
This week the campus is being so
licited for the year's quota.
Last week-end the student body en
tertained itself at a cost of about six
or seven thousand dollars. If that
amount can be raised for a single
week's entertainment, surely the
smaller sum can be raised for this
worthy cause. â€”Stephen O'Donnell.
