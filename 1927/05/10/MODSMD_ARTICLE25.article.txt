"Eastern universities which have of
fered the independent study plan have
found, like Stanford, that despite the
enthusiasm of students over the pros
pect of it,s possibility, practically none
have entered upon the plan after its
establishment," declared Dean Mary
Yost in an interview yesterday. Miss
Yost has just returned from a five
weeks' tour of the East, where she
attended the biennial National Con
vention of the American Association
of University Women, the Gilbreth
Conferences at Columbia University
on home-making, and a meeting of the
National Board of the Vassar Alumnae.
"As at Stanford, other universities
hav- found that students are not so
ready to follow their studies in an in
dependent manner as was indicated
by their declaration for it before it
was established.

"The question of the abolition of the
lower division at Stanford will mean
dealing with a new situation which we
are anxious to be prepared to meet
when the time comes. Any analogies
or suggestions in other universities
which might be applied to conditions
here are being carefully sought after."
At the convention of the American
Association of University Women in
Washington, D.C., Dean Yost declared
that she witnessed a most impressive
demonstration of college ability. "The
organization has just relieved itself
of a $150,000 debt incurred by the
building of a national headquarters
and clubhouse in Washington. It is
fast completing a million-dollar fund
for scholarships to be conferred on
graduate women who have completed
their first year of graduate work and
desire to go on with the second and
third.

"The American association is to get
$500,000 of this sura, and the other
$500>,000 is to go to the International

scholarships will allow of an inter

universities and our own."

Yost visited Vassar College, Columbia

Three From California
j Miss Yost was one of the three wo
men from California who attended the
Convention of American Association
of University Women. President Aure
lia Rheinhardt of Mills College and
Miss Noonan of San Francisco were
j the other two.
"Eastern universities which have of
fered the independent study plan have
found, like Stanford, that despite the
enthusiasm of students over the pros
pect of it,s possibility, practically none
have entered upon the plan after its
establishment," declared Dean Mary
Yost in an interview yesterday. Miss
Yost has just returned from a five
weeks' tour of the East, where she
attended the biennial National Con
vention of the American Association
of University Women, the Gilbreth
Conferences at Columbia University
on home-making, and a meeting of the
National Board of the Vassar Alumnae.
"As at Stanford, other universities
hav- found that students are not so
ready to follow their studies in an in
dependent manner as was indicated
by their declaration for it before it
was established.
New Problems
"The question of the abolition of the
lower division at Stanford will mean
dealing with a new situation which we
are anxious to be prepared to meet
when the time comes. Any analogies
or suggestions in other universities
which might be applied to conditions
here are being carefully sought after."
At the convention of the American
Association of University Women in
Washington, D.C., Dean Yost declared
that she witnessed a most impressive
demonstration of college ability. "The
organization has just relieved itself
of a $150,000 debt incurred by the
building of a national headquarters
and clubhouse in Washington. It is
fast completing a million-dollar fund
for scholarships to be conferred on
graduate women who have completed
their first year of graduate work and
desire to go on with the second and
third.
European Interchange
"The American association is to get
$500,000 of this sura, and the other
$500>,000 is to go to the International
Association of University Women. The
scholarships will allow of an inter
change of students between European
universities and our own."
During her stay in the East, Miss
Yost visited Vassar College, Columbia
University, New Haven, Boston, Fall
River, Wellesley College, Smith Col
lege, Terre Haute, where she ad

| dressed the state organization of
American University Women, and
