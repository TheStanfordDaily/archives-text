# ALL PEOPLE NOT FIT FOR COLLEGE, STATES PRESIDENT OF BROWN
## 
### 
Should all parents try to send their
children to college? No, says Dr. Wil
liam H. P. Faunce, president of Brown
University. It is tragic, he insists, for
parents to have the universal desire to
give their offspring a higher educa
tion.
"The trouble," says Dr. Faunce, "is
not that we are sending too many boys
to college, but that we are sending too
many of the wrong kind of boys. Men
are not alike, whereas our traditional
college trainings are very much alike.
We are making the mistake of assum
ing that education can be obtained
only in colleges, and that a college
diploma is good for everybody."
Dr. Faunce cites the case of a fa
mous institution in which G2 per cent
of the students enrolled failed to com
plete their courses. These, either
through discouragement or through
expulsion from the classroom, leave
college entirely disappointed, and with
their self-confidence shattered, with
the label "mentally incapable," when
probably with the same intelligence
they could have made brilliant suc
cesses in other fields of endeavor.
