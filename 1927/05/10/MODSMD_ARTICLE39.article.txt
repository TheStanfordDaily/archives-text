# OLYMPIC GAMES OF MODERN TIMES DATE FROM EARLY GREEKS
## 
### 
A foot race of 210. yards was the I
origin of the modern Olympic Games, j
The "stadion" was won by Coroebus
in 776 8.C., and from that date the
Olympiads have been reckoned.
Crowds would gather along a sta
dium of banks of sloping earth, and
cheer the nlide sprinters as they left
the marble slab' that was used for
footholds In the races of olden days.
The finish, unlike in modern times,
was always at the same place, the
starting point varying for the different ,
events.
Although the races were mostly
sprints, the jump for distance was a |
highly developed art. The javelin was j
a light spear, thrown with the aid of j
a strap. The discus was at first a plate i
of bronze, lens-shaped, and much
heavier than the present plate. The
best mark recorded was 95 feet.
The Olympics continued until 394
A.D., when they were suppressed by
Emperor Theodosius, supposedly on
the grounds that they were opposed to
Christianity. They were restored, how- j
ever, in 1596, mostly through the ef- !
forts of Baron Pierre de Coubertin.
