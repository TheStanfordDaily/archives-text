# STANFORD FRESHMEN END EXCITING TRIP IN BASTILE
## 
### 
Four Stanford freshmen, out to re
construct the life of the Barbary
Coast, went up to San Francisco Sat
urday night. They returned Sunday,
and although their Barbary Coast mis
sion failed in part, they finished the
evening off with a pleasant visit to the
city jail. The visitors were: David
Crabtree, John Neef, Arthur Pigott,
and John Hunt.
Starting out to the city in a Ford,
ownership and contents known only
to one of the quartette, they continued
the evening with a round of the night
clubs. Hours later, leaving the fourth
resort in high spirits, they sought to
vary the montony by a ride through
the dark and wayward San Francisco
alleys.

At length they parked the Ford in
front of a ramshackle hotel and tried
to decide on their next haunt. As they
sat there, a shabbily-drossed vagrant
approached them and asked for a con
tribution toward a night's lodging. But
a burly policeman drew near and told
them to move elsewhere. They com
plied. and drove around the corner to
a restaurant, where they partook of
further refreshments.
While the four were in the l'estau
rant, fearful robbery was taking place
in the nearby hotel. A woman was
bound and gagged; burglars ransacked
the room. The police who were search

ing for the robbers encountered three
of the freshmen sitting in their car
once more, waiting for their com
panion who busily watching a
passing fire eflgine.
Beaten and Jailed
These officers, having previously
warned the youths, suspected that
they were in some way connected with
the robbery, and attacked without fur
ther ado. The three victims, unable to
cope with their assailants, took a se
vere beating, one —he who knew the
history of the Ford —receiving a blow
which brought concussion of the
brain. The fourth man, returning from
the fire chase, was speedily dis
patched, and all four were bundled
into a waiting patrol wagon.
The freshmen spent the rest of the
early morning in a jail cell. Sunday
morning they were released on bail,
and the one who had received the seri
ous injury was taken to an Oakland
hospital. Yesterday they once more
appeared before the judge, but His
Honor dealt lightly with them.
"Case Dismissed"
"We have all done such things in
our time," he said, among many other
things. "Youth will have its fling.
Case dismissed!"
And today the adventurous four
anxiously wait upon the pleasure of
President Wilbur, who will render a
decision that will dceide their future
at Stanford.

resort in high spirits, they sought to
vary the montony by a ride through
the dark and wayward San Francisco
alleys.

At length they parked the Ford in
front of a ramshackle hotel and tried
to decide on their next haunt. As they
sat there, a shabbily-drossed vagrant
approached them and asked for a con
tribution toward a night's lodging. But
a burly policeman drew near and told
them to move elsewhere. They com
plied. and drove around the corner to
a restaurant, where they partook of
further refreshments.
While the four were in the l'estau
rant, fearful robbery was taking place
in the nearby hotel. A woman was
bound and gagged; burglars ransacked
the room. The police who were search

ing for the robbers encountered three
of the freshmen sitting in their car
once more, waiting for their com
panion who busily watching a
passing fire eflgine.
Beaten and Jailed
These officers, having previously
warned the youths, suspected that
they were in some way connected with
the robbery, and attacked without fur
ther ado. The three victims, unable to
cope with their assailants, took a se
vere beating, one —he who knew the
history of the Ford —receiving a blow
which brought concussion of the
brain. The fourth man, returning from
the fire chase, was speedily dis
patched, and all four were bundled
into a waiting patrol wagon.
The freshmen spent the rest of the
early morning in a jail cell. Sunday
morning they were released on bail,
and the one who had received the seri
ous injury was taken to an Oakland
hospital. Yesterday they once more
appeared before the judge, but His
Honor dealt lightly with them.
"Case Dismissed"
"We have all done such things in
our time," he said, among many other
things. "Youth will have its fling.
Case dismissed!"
And today the adventurous four
anxiously wait upon the pleasure of
President Wilbur, who will render a
decision that will dceide their future
at Stanford.
Four Stanford freshmen, out to re
construct the life of the Barbary
Coast, went up to San Francisco Sat
urday night. They returned Sunday,
and although their Barbary Coast mis
sion failed in part, they finished the
evening off with a pleasant visit to the
city jail. The visitors were: David
Crabtree, John Neef, Arthur Pigott,
and John Hunt.
Starting out to the city in a Ford,
ownership and contents known only
to one of the quartette, they continued
the evening with a round of the night
clubs. Hours later, leaving the fourth
resort in high spirits, they sought to
vary the montony by a ride through
the dark and wayward San Francisco
alleys.
