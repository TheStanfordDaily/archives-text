# HONOR SYSTEM FAILS SAYS NORTHERN DEAN
## 
### 
"Oust the whole system and start
on a new basis," Dean of Men James
E. Gould, of the University of Wash
ington, advises in regard to the honor
system at. that university. He claims
the code is a failure because it is not
comprehensive, and because it is<
purely punitive and not corrective.
"What good is a code that selects
the single subject of cheating and ig
nores petty thievery, drunkenness, and
like misdemeanors?" ho demands.
"And how many will report a fellow
student for cheating when punishment,
not help, is the almost certain result?
I would like to see a complete change
in the administration of the Washing
ton Code."
