Easter may be over, but the rabbit
will be long remembered. Half of
Roble Hall was served chicken for
dinner yesterday noon and the other
half rabbit. The rabbit won. By dinner
time last night Mrs. Stearns, Roble
house mother, had thirteen on her
sick-list and additions were still com
ing strong.
A little over two years ago, Roble

canned apricots that claimed some

special nurses were engaged for the
occasion.
