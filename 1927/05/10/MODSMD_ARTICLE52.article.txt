A Redbird Quartette

Behold the "Big Four" of the St.
Louis Cardinals' mound staff, the quar
tet that the Mound City fans are hop
ing will be able to pitch the Red Birds
to another world's championship, in
spite of the loss of tlieir former man
ager, Rogers Hornsby.
Alexander, Sherdel, Haines, and
Rliem, what a foursome! And what a
variety! Alex, 40 years old, crafty,
sunning "Old Pop"; Sherdel, the soutli
paw, ten years younger than Alex,
called "Wee Willie," yet really not
small at all; Jesse Joseph Haines, ap
proaching 34, and with the build, and
the initials of a heavyweight cham
pion; and lastly, Flint Rhem, only 25,
the biggest of the four, and signed by
the Cardinals while a student at Clem
son Agricultural and Mechanical Col-'
lege, South Carolina.
This quartet is today starting its j
first series against the New York
Giants, picked by nearly all the "ex- j
perts" as the team to beat for the |
National League pennant. Alexander,
it will be remembered, pitched the
opening game for the Cards against
Chicago. His world series reputation
evidently didn't affect his former team-1

mates, for Old Pop was rudely batted
out of the box early in the game. He
came back, however, in his next start,
and beat the Reds on April 17. Haines,
Sherdel, and Rhem all began the 1927
season by holding their opponents tq>
two hits, but "Wee Willie," with his
usual hard luck, lost to the Cubs by
one run, scored on Hack Wilson's
homer. Haines, who pitched the only
shut-out in the last world series, won
his third start on April 25, pitching
the Cards into the league leadership,
supplanting the Pirates.
The last year's records of *these
pitchers show that they performed
best against the Braves, winning
eleven games in all from the Bean
eaters. Cincinnati was the hardest
team for the Big Four to defeat, only
three victories being scored over the
Reds. Rhem and Sherdel were unable
to defeat the Rhinelanders at all in
1927. Sherdel found Brooklyn the
easiest, winning six games from the
Robins, while Rhem beat the Phillies
five times. In all, these four flingers
turned in fifty-seven varieties of vic
tories for St. Louis, and only two
other teams in the National League,

Giants, picked by nearly all the "ex- j
perts" as the team to beat for the |
National League pennant. Alexander,
it will be remembered, pitched the
opening game for the Cards against
Chicago. His world series reputation
evidently didn't affect his former team-1

mates, for Old Pop was rudely batted
out of the box early in the game. He
came back, however, in his next start,
and beat the Reds on April 17. Haines,
Sherdel, and Rhem all began the 1927
season by holding their opponents tq>
two hits, but "Wee Willie," with his
usual hard luck, lost to the Cubs by
one run, scored on Hack Wilson's
homer. Haines, who pitched the only
shut-out in the last world series, won
his third start on April 25, pitching
the Cards into the league leadership,
supplanting the Pirates.
The last year's records of *these
pitchers show that they performed
best against the Braves, winning
eleven games in all from the Bean
eaters. Cincinnati was the hardest
team for the Big Four to defeat, only
three victories being scored over the
Reds. Rhem and Sherdel were unable
to defeat the Rhinelanders at all in
1927. Sherdel found Brooklyn the
easiest, winning six games from the
Robins, while Rhem beat the Phillies
five times. In all, these four flingers
turned in fifty-seven varieties of vic
tories for St. Louis, and only two
other teams in the National League,

Behold the "Big Four" of the St.
Louis Cardinals' mound staff, the quar
tet that the Mound City fans are hop
ing will be able to pitch the Red Birds
to another world's championship, in
spite of the loss of tlieir former man
ager, Rogers Hornsby.
Alexander, Sherdel, Haines, and
Rliem, what a foursome! And what a
variety! Alex, 40 years old, crafty,
sunning "Old Pop"; Sherdel, the soutli
paw, ten years younger than Alex,
called "Wee Willie," yet really not
small at all; Jesse Joseph Haines, ap
proaching 34, and with the build, and
the initials of a heavyweight cham
pion; and lastly, Flint Rhem, only 25,
the biggest of the four, and signed by
the Cardinals while a student at Clem
son Agricultural and Mechanical Col-'
lege, South Carolina.
This quartet is today starting its j
first series against the New York
Giants, picked by nearly all the "ex- j
perts" as the team to beat for the |
