El Tigre won the first intramural
playoff game from Sequoia yesterday
afternoon. Beta Theta Pi and El
Campo captured league titles by down
ing the Alpha Delta Phi and El Cuadro
nines. Sigma Nu went into a tie with
Chi Psi for the lead in League II by
defeating Theta Delta Chi.
Behind the excellent pitching of
Hunter, the El Tigre team had little
trouble winning its way into the semi
finals for the University title. Hunter
held his opponents hitless for the first
five innings and allowed only two hits
in all during the game. Hunter also
led his team's batting attack in the
fourth inning with a three-base hit. A
double by Prisinzano and three singles
accounted for four runs. Another was
made in the fourth inning when Prisin
zano scored from third on an over
throw, and two more came in the sixth
frame.
Betas Swamp Rivals
Beta Theta Pi batters knocked one
Alpha Delt pitcher out of the box
while rolling up their total of 15 runs.
Dennis started the game for the Alpha
Delts, but was replaced by Miller in
the seventh inning after the Betas had
scored seven times. The Beta nine
completed its season in League IV
without suffering a defeat and will
make a strong bid for the intramural
title in the playoff series this week.
The expected good game between
Sigma Nu and Theta Delta Chi failed
to materialize as the Theta Delts could
muster only six players. The game
was played regardless, but at the end
of the second inning Sigma Nu led
20 to 0; so the slaughter was ended
by mutual consent. Sigma Nu will
meet Chi Psi this afternoon for the
championship of League 11.
Ends in Three Innings
The El Campo-Cuadro game was
another comedy of errors, El Cuadro
furnishing the league titleholders an
afternoon of batting practice. After
three innings the game was called
with El Campo leading 19 to 0.
Zeta Psi bowed to Alpha Tau Omega
in a free hitting contest which ended
12 to 11. Hanna and Cass formed the
Zete battery, and Wood and Fox did
the heavy work for the A.T.O. nine.
Fox made the longest hit of the game,
a three-bagger.
This afternoon, on the varsity dia
mond, Phi Gamma Delta will meet
Delta Chi in the second playoff game
between the winners of the seven
leagues.

meet Chi Psi this afternoon for the
championship of League 11.
Ends in Three Innings
The El Campo-Cuadro game was
another comedy of errors, El Cuadro
furnishing the league titleholders an
afternoon of batting practice. After
three innings the game was called
with El Campo leading 19 to 0.
Zeta Psi bowed to Alpha Tau Omega
in a free hitting contest which ended
12 to 11. Hanna and Cass formed the
Zete battery, and Wood and Fox did
the heavy work for the A.T.O. nine.
Fox made the longest hit of the game,
a three-bagger.
This afternoon, on the varsity dia
mond, Phi Gamma Delta will meet
Delta Chi in the second playoff game
between the winners of the seven
leagues.
El Tigre 7, Sequoia 2
Alpha Tau Omega 12, Zeta Psi 11
El Campo 19, El Cuadro 0 (three
innings)

(two innings)
Beta Theta Pi 15, Alpha Delta Phi 0
Theta Chi 7, Delta Tau Delta 0

El Tigre won the first intramural
playoff game from Sequoia yesterday
afternoon. Beta Theta Pi and El
Campo captured league titles by down
ing the Alpha Delta Phi and El Cuadro
nines. Sigma Nu went into a tie with
Chi Psi for the lead in League II by
defeating Theta Delta Chi.
Behind the excellent pitching of
Hunter, the El Tigre team had little
trouble winning its way into the semi
finals for the University title. Hunter
held his opponents hitless for the first
five innings and allowed only two hits
in all during the game. Hunter also
led his team's batting attack in the
fourth inning with a three-base hit. A
double by Prisinzano and three singles
accounted for four runs. Another was
made in the fourth inning when Prisin
zano scored from third on an over
throw, and two more came in the sixth
frame.
Betas Swamp Rivals
Beta Theta Pi batters knocked one
Alpha Delt pitcher out of the box
while rolling up their total of 15 runs.
Dennis started the game for the Alpha
Delts, but was replaced by Miller in
the seventh inning after the Betas had
scored seven times. The Beta nine
completed its season in League IV
without suffering a defeat and will
make a strong bid for the intramural
title in the playoff series this week.
The expected good game between
Sigma Nu and Theta Delta Chi failed
to materialize as the Theta Delts could
muster only six players. The game
was played regardless, but at the end
of the second inning Sigma Nu led
20 to 0; so the slaughter was ended
by mutual consent. Sigma Nu will
meet Chi Psi this afternoon for the
championship of League 11.
