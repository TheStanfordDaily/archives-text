j- n v/f K "Hey, hey .. . smart! Lots of good looks, trim lines, sophisticated air .. .
If jf / \\ 112 112 | plenty pep, too, I bet!"
V // j y I "Right, but you're a bit late .. . she's wearing a Deke pin tiow." j
"/ mean the car, you ham —that new Ersktne Coupe!"
JUNE DAYS . . . Youth steps on the gas. A round of
golf . . . sailing, with rails awash . . . tennis ... a
dip in the surf ... a spin down the road at twilight. . .
June nights . . . white flannels ... a dance at the
country club. A riot of music . . . white hot. The girl
with the asbestos slippers ... on with the dance. Then
home —the way silvered with June moonlight —in your
Erskine Sport Coupe.
Dietrich, America's peerless custom designer, has
styled it with the sophisticated Parisian manner for
America's youth. Trim as a silk glove, yet at no sacrifice
of roominess . . . two in the commodious lounge seat
and two more in the rumble seat —just a foursome.
Youthful in its eager performance too. Rides any
road at sixty — smoothly as a drifting canoe. Goes
through traffic like a co-ed through her allowance.
Skyrockets up the steepest hill like a climbing pursuit
'plane. Stops in its own length, turns in its own shadow
and parks where you want to park.
Joyous June, All too short. . . lots of glorious living
to be crowded into one month. Make the most of it —
with an Erskine Coupe — the car that matches the
spirit of Youth.
The Erskine Six Sport Coupe, as illustrated, sells for $995
112. o. b. factory, complete with front and rear bumpers and self
energizing 4 wheel brakes. See it at any Studebaker showroom.
