# HARVARD, PRINCETON JOIN FOR ART WORK
## 
### 
Although the student bodies of Har
vard and Princeton have been sepa
rated on the athletic field, they are
now to be united in the field of art.
A joint publication, "Art Studies," will
be produced through a grant of $7500
provided by a Harvard graduate.
The donor desires to have his gift,
emphasize the fact "that friendly re
lations between great universities
should be thought of in terms of co
operative scholarship rather than in
the over-emphasized field of intercol
legiate athletics."
