# SIGMA NU DEFEATS CHI PSI NINE FOR LEAGUE II TITLE
## Errors by Losers in Initial Frame Put Victors Well Ahead CONTEST SETTLES TIE El Toro Bows to Los Arcos, Theta Delts, in Second Round Matches 
### 
Sigma Nu won the intramural base
ball championship of League II and
the right to enter the semi-finals by
defeating Chi Psi 7 to 4 yesterday
afternoon. They will meet Beta Theta
Pi in the first game tomorrow. Harry
Todd, on the mound for the winners,
with good support at the bat, kept
Sigma Nu always in the lead, and from
the first they were never headed.
Chi Psi Makes Errors
Two errors by the Chi Psi infield in
the initial frame, coupled with good
base-running, put Sigma Nu out in
front with a three-run lead. In the
next, another run was added to the
total while the losers were garnering
only one tally.
Van King was thereafter effective
in the box for Chi Psi and Todd weak
ened, allowing a three-run spurt to
bring the losers within one run of
tying the score. But this rally ended
the scoring for this nine, and the vic
tors, annexing three more runs in the
remaining three innings.
