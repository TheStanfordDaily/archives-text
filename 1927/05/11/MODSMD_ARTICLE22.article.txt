### 
Scenes from Leningrad, by A. P.
Ostromuovoa, Russian artist, were re
cently put on display in the Hoover
War Library exhibition cases in the
University Library.
Leningrad, the capital of the Soviet
government in Russia, substituted for
the name of St. Petersburg by the
Bolshevist regime. The city was origi
nally known as Petrograd.
The sketches show vistas on the
river Neva and some of the many
canals which traverse the city. Ad
ministrative buildings, both of the new
and the old regime and a Greek Catho
lic cathedral also figure in the views.
