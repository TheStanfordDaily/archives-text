# SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GLEE CLUB, BAND GIVE AFTERNOON PROGRAM
## "Come Join the Band," U.C., Washington Marches In Finale Hit 
### John Rogers 
Yesterday afternoon the militant
Cardinal and Gold Glee Club and Band
invaded the Women's Clubhouse and
started off with a bang—three of them.
So great was the volume of the instru
ments and so small is the room in
which they played that the results
were, to say the least, a trifle deafen
ing. But for all that, they were good.
The band, under the direction of
Hal Roberts, first played the "United
States Field Artillery March," a stir
ring piece—and noisey, thanks to loud
drums and a revolver. This was fol
lowed by the "Cavalry Charge," a
longer piece that had a tendency to
drag at first but in the second half
picked up to a lively march, full of
galloping horses and such.
Under the leadership of J. Arthur
Lewis, the glee club's first number
was "To Arms," a stirring song with
good harmony and volume. This was
followed by a medley of snatches of
old songs sung in close German har
mony.
The hit of the afternoon was the
finale —a group of Western university
marching songs, which included
Yale's "Boola Boola," California's and
Washington's marches, "Come Join
the Band," and "Fight On,"the Tro
jan march. In this group the glee club
was accompanied by the band.
The saxophone sextette —turned
quintette for the afternoon —played
two pieces, not unusual, but which
were well received.
Berwyn Riske, who sang "Wake Up,"
has a pleasing baritone that is clear
in tone and has a good range. "Twi
light Dreams," played on the cornet by
Stillman Weils, was played well —but
the Clubhouse is no place for brasses.
