Coast making a vaudeville tour. It
was through Maloney's influence that
Tunney was persuaded to visit the
campus.
The letter from the famous heavy

know I received a great deal of pleas
ure in visiting you and being your
guest at the University. You are doing
great work, Harry, and it must be a
source of great gratification to you, as
you look over that group of young
men who are under your supervision
and see the splendid types of virile
manhood your instruction and coach
ing makes."
