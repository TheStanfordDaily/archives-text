## 
### 
"American college songs are inferior
because they are too sentimental," de
clared Olin Downes, New York Times
music critic and a judge of tlie recent
Intercollegiate Glee Club contest, to a
Daily Princetonian reporter. "For one
good one there are half a dozen bad
ones. At present they are too lachry
mos; they should be more virile and
healthy and symbolic of the true life
which undergraduates lead."
