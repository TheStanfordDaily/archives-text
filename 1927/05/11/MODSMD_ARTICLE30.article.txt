# No Pacifists Wanted

It does not take long for students to learn that they seldom receive
something" for nothing", and so from experience, they cease hunting for
the improbable. But young men and women do learn at college that
good pay is worth seeking after, and often obtained. This afternoon
Stanford University will pay its students exceptionally well. For four
hours' work at the Convalescent Home, the laborers will receive five
dollars' worth of food, entertainment, and good time.
An army of students equipped with hoes, axes, rakes, shovels, and
brooms will attack the Home, and 110 slackers are wanted. The troops
will go over the top at 1 o'clock sharp when Captain Harvey Lytel gives
the signal. The motor transports and foot troops leave from Roble at
the appointed hour.
It is expected that the Home will be captured by 5 :30 o'clock this
afternoon and at that time the army will be feasted and be entertained.
Sam Mac Donald, whose reputation is already made, will be in charge
of the mess-hall, and the food will be distributed to the deserving ones
in generous helpings.
But what would a war be without the women folks? What would be
the object of fighting if the fairer sex were not concerned to some
degree? What an awful failure any war would be without the Red Cross
nurses. But all these things have been attended to in the local war this
afternoon, for the Stanford women have been enlisted to help their brave
brothers in the fight for the Home.
And when peace is declared tomorrow morning, the troops can go
back to their civilian life feeling that they have fought for a cause as
good as for the children of Belgium or Franceâ€”the children at the
Convalescent Home.
