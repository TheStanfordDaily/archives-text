# Concerning Football

Liberty Magazine (adv.) sent us a copy of the April issue and asked
us to give them some publicity in connection with an editorial defending,
in general, the status quo of collegiate football.
It seems that one Dr. Hopkins, President of Dartmouth, has pro
posed (1) that intercollegiate football be limited to members of the
Junior and Sophomore classes; (2) that games be reciprocal, with two
varsity teams playing doubleheaders each week—one at home, one away;
and (3) that coaching be restricted to undergraduates.
Liberty proposes that Dr. Hopkins "be penalized fifteen yards three
times for being off-side in his theories." The criticism sounds about as
dignified as an editorial on Student Council.
But even if Dr. Hopkins were as woozy as Student Council, we
could hardly back Liberty in its stand. We have always thought mem
bers of the Student Council should be majors in the R.O.T.C. We might
add that the editor of Liberty should be a second lieutenant.
They represent a type, perhaps a noble type. Their attitude is hinted
at quite adequately in Liberty's quotation from Coach Jesse Hawley of
Dartmouth: "Nowhere on the football field, do boys in our colleges learn
discipline—and, by God, they learn it there!"
In other words, we're going to like things as they are, or, by God,
they'll make us!

We of the Weekly are advocates of experimentation. No matter
how well present arrangements are working out, we think they could
be better. Perhaps Dr. Hopkins' proposals arc not the solution to the
football problem; but he should be encouraged in any experiment to im
prove a condition which has aroused so much criticism.—Pitt Weekly.
