Offering the latest angle on one of the greatest collegiate social
problems, the Oregon Daily Emerald maintains:
"When the boy friend gives his girl a fraternity pin the couple are not
necessarily engaged. Students at the University of Oregon have just held a
mock trial on this question, the woman in the case bringing suit for breach
of promise. The defendant insisted that when he planted his fraternity pin
on her he had no intention of making the lady his forever. William G. Ilale,
dean of the Law School, acted as judge and rendered the decision which is
expected to serve as a valuable precedent for real life cases of a like nature."
