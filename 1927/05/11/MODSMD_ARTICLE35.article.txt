WILHELM HOH ENZOLLERN, The
Last of the Kaisers. Ey Emil Lud
wig Putnam.
This biography of the man, who
more than all the others, has been
held responsible for the World War,
has two merits that recommend it to
all readers who desire an authentic ;
record: the fact that the author is a
German, and more important still, that
William Holienzollern is reconstructed
from the records left by his friends .
and his counsellors, all Germans —and j
not from the prejudiced accounts of j
his enemies.
Therefore, when the "last of the
Kaisers" is presented as a man whose |
very existence meant disaster to him-;
self, his nation, and the world, men of
all shades of opinion will be disposed |
to listen with respect, for the point of |
view and the evidence are both de- 1
prived of their customary bias.
The picture of the former German .
Emperor painted by this German bio- i
grapher is not flattering—it amounts,
in effect, to a severe indictment, as j
some critics have already observed.
Yet it is only an indictment in the
sense that a man, rendered incapable j
by physical handicap and unfavorable i
environment, got himself into a seri
ous trouble —as such a man is likely
to do.
As to the responsibility for the

| World War, the biographer declares
! that the wrangling of the ministers
, and the impossible tangle of interna
tional relations brought it about —not
any one man or any one king. The Ger
man Emperor, he says, aggravated the
international situation chiefly by his
braggadocio talk and his childish tele-
I grams and cablegrams. In his heart he
did not desire war —but was not in
telligent enough to keep out of it.
I Ludwig presents the former Em
; peror as an absurd and swaggering
I ac tor cast in the role of King; and if
his source is admitted to be reliable,
I convinces the reader that an absurd
j and swaggering actor is all he really
' amounted to. lie was a pilot unfitted
by defect of will and nervous insta
-1 bility that amounted almost to disease
! to guide the ship of state. His chief
1 ministers being his bosom friends and
1 yesmen who put private advantage be
; t'ore common good—what could hinder
: the tempest that broke and the wreck
that costa throne? He gives scores of
j instances to show that the former Em
: peror's love of display amounted to
almost a mania—an inferiority com
| plex trying to satisfy its craving.
All in all this is about the most con-
I vincing document on the subject of
William Hohenzollern that has yet ap
peared; and it has the advantage of
being as interesting as most novels.
