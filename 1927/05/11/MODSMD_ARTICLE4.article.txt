# LAWRENCE STRAUSS WINS ADMIRATION OF AUDIENCE
## 
### Hubert Gagos 
Lawrence Strauus, San Francisco
tenor, singing in the Assembly Hall
last night, won the admiration of a
large audience when he continued
with his program in spite of darkness
in the hall caused by a break in the
main power line. His accompanist
completed the song he was singing
when the room was pitched into dark
ness, and played the remainder of the
dark period to the light of a hand
torch.
But Strauss had won the audience
with his art even before the interrup
tion occurred. Lilting, crooning, then
bursting into powerful passages, he
clearly demonstrated that reports of
his ability were not exaggerated.
Program Grouped
The program was in three groups.
Group one contained four songs in
the German language by Mendelssohn,
Schubert, and Brahms. They were
well adapted for his voice and range.

His encore, a soft lullaby in falsetto
voice, was Jbetter than the preceding
selections.
An eighteenth century folk song,
"Les Anes du Caire," the last French
number, drew the greatest applause of
the second group. It was a rapid, hu
morous melody typically French.
Strauss enunciates all of his songs
very clearly and nowhere in the pro
gram was this more evident than in
the rapid French.
Sings Folk Songs
His last two groups in English in
cluded four old English folk songs.
"Lord Randal," one of these, was sung
recently at the Toyon Musicale by Dr.
Margery Bailey. Strauss was at his
best in this sad song of a young lord
who was poisoned by his sweetheart.
"Windy a short song in the
same group, had to be repeated.
Strauss appeared under the auspices
of the Committee on Public Exercises
in place of the regular Tuesday eve
ning lecture.
