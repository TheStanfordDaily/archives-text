# KY EBRIGHT STARTS CREW PRACTICE FOR POUGHKEEPSIE MEET
## 
### 
BERKELEY, May 10.â€”Satisfied that
his choice of a good combination was
demonstrated by the convincing vic
tory of the Bears over the Huskies in
their dual regatta last month, Coach
Ky Ebright has begun training his
varsities with the first shell-line intact.
The varsity, junior varsity, and fresh
man crew will be sent East to try to
win the Poughkeepsie cup. The na
tional cup has never yet been taken
by a San Francisco Bay region uni
versity.
Since the Californians proved their
superiority over Washington in brute
strength, the finer points of technique
are now being developed. The Navy
appears to be the chief contender in
the East, and the coach is training his
crew with the progress of the Navy
kept well in mind. Alumni and stu
dents are raising $17,000 in a state
wide drive to send the three crews
East.
