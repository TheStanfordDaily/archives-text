# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
If you happened to be at the last
1.C.4-A track meet at the Harvard Sta
dium, you probably noticed a tall,
studious-looking gent who adjusted a
small movie camera on the concrete
railing in front of the first row of seats
near the high-jump and shot-putting
pits and cranked furiously whenever
Bud Houser, Bob King, or some other
champion was performing. The t. and
s.-l. gent was Harry Hillman, track
coach at Dartmouth College, and one
of the smartest mentors there is in
the business. The movie camera he
uses as an aid in coaching the young
sters at Hanover, New Hampshire, in
just how the best athletes do their
stuff, and it is an example of one of
the modern methods that help make
Harry Hillman such a successful
coach.
But Harry, though up to the minute
in all his ideas of form and execution
in things pertaining to track and field,
is an old-timer himself, and will show
you, if you urge him enough, numerous
cups and medals that he himself won
on the cinder-path in competitions

| years ago. Harry Hillman was a fa
mous athlete around 1904, and in the
last seventeen years has added con
siderably to his fame as a producer
of other athletes and record-breakers.
The genial and efficient coach at
Dartmouth has a three-fold past. He
competed in three Olympic games, he
won three Olympic championships at
St. Louis in 1904, and he holds rec
j ords in three-legged racing. Besides
that, he won four national champion
| ships and probably would have won
\ added honors in the 1906 Olympic
meeting at Athens had he not been
severely injured on the way over when
a huge wave banged him against the
rail of the ship in which the team
| was traveling.
Hillman was a low-hurdler and quar
j ter-miler, and for a time held the
world's 400-meter record. His famous
indoor GOO-yard races with John Tay
lor, Mel Sheppard, and Burt Parsons
j will always be remembered by those
old-timers lucky enough to have wit
i nessed them. Since going to Dart
| mouth to coach in 1909, Harry has de

veloped such famous athletes as Earl
Thomson, Mare Wright, Harry Wor
thington. Fat Spears, Laddie Myers, '

Le√üoy Brown, and his present liurd
ling prodigy, Monte Wells.
