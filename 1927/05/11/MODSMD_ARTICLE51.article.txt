SEATTLE, May 10.â€”Colored flood
lights and huge searchlights stationed
on a bridge covered with serpentine
illuminated the annual University of
Washington Mardi Gras, held recently

Organized houses were paired in
groups to produce canoe entries, and
there were many unique effects in the
parade of floats. An orchestra played
during the procession, which formally
honored the Junior Queen and her
