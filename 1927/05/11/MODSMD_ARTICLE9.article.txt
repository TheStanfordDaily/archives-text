# FINAL DRIVE CLOSES TODAY FOR STANFORD CHARITY FUND QUOTA
## More Than $1000 Pledged By Living Groups in First Canvass 
### 
Today will be the final day of the
Stanford Convalescent Home appeal
to raise the Stanford students' share
of the $5000, which is the quota for
this district, Charles Dickenson, chair
man of the appeal, stated yesterday.
The pledges will be collected by the
committee during the week.
More than $1000 was pledged dur
ing the first canvass of the living
groups, some averaging as high as $3
a person in their donations. In a few
days the amount given by each group
will be published, Dickenson stated.
Off-campus members are requested to
make their checks payable to the Stan
ford Convalescent Home and mail
them to Clifford Schink, Box 555,
Campus.
The drive is commended by Rev. D.
Charles Gardner who says, "This is
the only charityâ€”the only social wel
fare that Stanford students do. It is
a worthy cause, aiding weak, silk chil
dren struggle back to strength and
happiness. The operating expense of
the home for a year is $33,000. We
need $500 from our friends in this
community to balance our budget for
the year."
