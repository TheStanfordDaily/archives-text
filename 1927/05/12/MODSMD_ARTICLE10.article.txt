"A moral tale—so flexible is language—
is often a piece of writing immoral, but
its special mark is this: that in it cer
tain approved spiritual qualities are as
sured of fat material reward." That is
the definition that Miss Edith Ronald
Mirrielees, assistant professor of English,
gives to a tale with a moral in her article,
"Moral Tales, Past and Present," in the
Atlantic Monthly for May.
In the eighteenth century the first moral
commandment, as the moral tale records
it, was "Stay quiet in your assigned social
place; reverence those placed above you,"
for on assigned social place and the rever

"In the nineteenth century," says Miss
Mirrielees, the commandment has shifted
a little: "Stay quiet in your assigned
mental place; appreciate only what we
have proved by handling and buying and
selling to be good. (Otherwise—"
But the present tale frowns on such
delay. Its favorites are still young, are
vigorous and actively enjoying when their
good things arrive to them. Somewhere
between twenty-five and thirty is the
favorite period for wisdom to reap its
harvest. Just as the tale is preaching,
"Take risks," it is also preaching, "and
take them now."
