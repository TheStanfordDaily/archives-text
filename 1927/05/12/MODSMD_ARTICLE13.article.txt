; If you are a man between 5 feet 10
inches and G feet 1 inch in height—if
! you are of athletic build and slender —
! if your hair and eyes are dark —why
! then, reports Ned Holmes, head of the
' First National Pictures-College Humor
Western screen-testing unit, your
| chances of being one of the ten em-
I bryonic motion pictures stars chosen
from Stanford for the final elimination
i are best.
Incidentally, in the other universi
ties already visited, seniors and mem
! bers of the Sigma Chi fraternity num
-1 ber most among those who have
passed the rigid tests of the camera
nit.
However, Holmes advises that men
who do not come in the above cate
gories also try out tomorrow at J2
I o'clock in the Basketball Pavilion,
i when the tests will be held at the
University.
Crowds numbering from one to
three or four hundred have turned out
at the other thirty-two colleges that
i have been visited. At the Universities
of Michigan, Purdue, and Wisconsin,
| the aspirants fairly swamped the test
ing unit.
| And not only have the students
; shown interest in these tests, but men
of national reputation have posed
; with groups that were finally selected
i from the different colleges. "Hurry-
I Up" Yost, Michigan football coach,
\ Jim Phelan, football coach at Purdue,
| Tom Robertson, Northwestern swim
i ming coach, Governor Fred R. Zimmer
j men at Wisconsin, and Dr. Hall, presi
| dent of Oregon, have lined up with
: the lucky ten for a "movie," Holmes
i says.
! "In ordey to make certain that the
' best available talent mill report for
! inspection, no limit whatsoever has
; been placed upon the qualifications
deemed necessary," reports Holmes.
■ "Our only regret is that we have to
! limit the tests to ten men."
When the negatives of all the tests
have been developed at the First Na
j tional laboratory at Burbank, near
! Hollywood, John McConnick, manager
i of productions, will decide which are
| the ten men who possess the most
I attractive and interesting screen per
j sonalities.
I These ten will be brought to the
studios in California —all their ex
j penses being paid—and will be given
| eight weeks' work in pictures with
I famous stars. If any of the ten de
velop unusual talent, five-year con
tracts will be offered them. The con
tracts call for a graduated scale of
j salary, starting at $75 a week for the
! first six months, and mounting rapidly
' to $750 a week for the fifth year.

Western screen-testing unit, your

who do not come in the above cate
gories also try out tomorrow at J2

University.
Crowds numbering from one to
three or four hundred have turned out
at the other thirty-two colleges that
i have been visited. At the Universities
of Michigan, Purdue, and Wisconsin,

ing unit.

of national reputation have posed
; with groups that were finally selected

deemed necessary," reports Holmes.
■ "Our only regret is that we have to

When the negatives of all the tests
have been developed at the First Na

I attractive and interesting screen per
j sonalities.
I These ten will be brought to the
studios in California —all their ex
j penses being paid—and will be given
| eight weeks' work in pictures with
I famous stars. If any of the ten de
velop unusual talent, five-year con
tracts will be offered them. The con
tracts call for a graduated scale of
