# FALSE NEWS REPORTS CAUSE FRENCH ANGER OVER AVIATORS-LUTZ
## Paris Mob Places Blame for "White Bird" Loss Upon United States 
### 
"The dissemination of news is probably
at the base of the French flare-up," said
Ralph H. Lutz, associate professor of
history, last night, in discussing the re
sult of the attempted Paris to New York
flight by Coli and Nungesser, war-famed
French aviators.
Professor Lutz explained that the Pa
risian dailies, unlike American papers, are
not delivered to subscribers, but are sold
entirely on the streets. As a result the
readers, discovering that certain dis
patches were denied, that the authority
for others had been shifted on to both
the French and American governments,
and that the flight had not succeeded,
merely succumbed to ordinary mob opin
ion.
Newspapers Hasty
It is quite probable that the newspapers,
ready to be sent to press with news of
the successful completion of the flight,
were shot on to the streets by some vague
dispatch, veracity unproved. Later, when
A.P. and naval reports were received,
the papers denied the former stories.
The entire populace of Paris was sub
jected to feelings of suspense, expecta
tion, delirious joy, doubt, and then re
morse, and subsequently bitterness. Real
izing the feeling of competition between
American and French aviators, the public
was easily led to believe that the Ameri
cans, in this spirit of competition, had
sent false weather reports, and started
Coli and Nungesser off in a thunder
storm.
Le Matin Arouses Anger
Le Matin, generally known as a strictly
reliable paper, is one of the several Paris
journals that have been "taken in" by this
flare-up. As a result, the people have
directed their anger toward it, then to
ward the French government, and as a
last recourse, toward America.
Professor Lutz believes that Ambassa
dor Herrick is amply justified in advising
American aviators to postpone their New
York-Paris flights until something more
definite is known of the Coli-Nungesser
plane. Under the present conditions, the
French people would consider it extremely
discourteous, if not a distinct insult, for
an American to so much as attempt the
flight.
The entire affair is due to a number of
misunderstandings, he says, enhanced by
disillusionment and anger. At all events,
if the American aviators refrain from
any discourteous actions, the "flare-up"
will die down as quickly as it started.
