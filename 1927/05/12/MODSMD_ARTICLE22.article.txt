# U.C. UNDERGRADUATES AWARDED CASH PRIZES
## 
### 
Cash scholarships totaling more than
$36,000 have been recently awarded to
approximately two hundred undergradu
ate students of the University of Cali
fornia on the basis of character, need, and
scholarship standing, by the Board of
Regents.
The scholarships are awarded both as
prizes for outstanding work, and for the
purpose of assisting needy students who
give promise of making something of
themselves. The funds from which the
scholarships are drawn come partly from
the university budget provided by the
State Legislature, and chiefly from private
endowments. In amount they vary from
$125 to $500 each.
