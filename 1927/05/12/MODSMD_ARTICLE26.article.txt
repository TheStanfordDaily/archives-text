With the gray fog of the North Atlantic mantling the fate of Captains
Nungesser and Coli comes an unpleasant touch to what would have been
only a gallant failure of an effort to advance the science and achievements
of aviation. The French airmen, reducing their food and fuel .supplies
to the barest minimum; sought to fly across the Atlantic in a plane which
if forced down in a rough sea could not remain long afloat.
While international attention was centered on the Nungesser plane,
several Americans were making final preparations for a similar trans
atlantic flight, starting from New York. In France the two flights were
■viewed in the light of a race, while in the United States interest lay in
the progress of Nungesser and Coli.
The touch of bitterness came to the whole affair when a Parisian
mob accused the United States of promulgating false weather reports
causing the failure of the French transatlantic attempt presumably to
give the Americans a chance to win the "race." In answer to these
charges Dr. Charles F. Marvin, head of the United States Weather
Bureau, asserted that no aid or advice had been requested from his
department.
The French anger, culminating in the removal of American flags from
display places, was due simply to an overstressing of the element of
competition when more of a feeling of co-operation should have been
developed. It was a phase of "mob psychology" in which the most
handy excuse, appealing to the popular, excitable mind, was seized upon
without consideration of the facts in the case.
