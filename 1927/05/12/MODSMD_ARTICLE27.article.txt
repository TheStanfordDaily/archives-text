Lovers of the true and the beautiful will agree with the Bookman in
its suggestion that, for the good of American literature and increased
sales, certain authors forbid the dissemination of their photographs. One
cannot look at Joseph Hergesheimer for any length of time and still
remain confident in the belief that he has taken tea with Corrine Griffith
as many times as lie says he has. Christopher Morley undoubtedly has
a very kind face but he does not appear to be as whimsical as his pub
lisher's blurbs would have led his readers to believe. And, as the
Bookman points out, Will Durant's goatee is a splendid goatee as such
but its insouciance little becomes a best selling philosopher.
That Edna St. Vincent Millay does not destroy the illusion which her
henchmen and harpweavers have created is small compensation for the
fact that Mr. Mencken resembles a well-fed lodge member. Colonel
Lawrence's profile is sufficiently romantic. Ring Lardner's face is
tinged with the traditional gloom of the comedian, and Sherwood Ander
son, fortunately, gives an impression not incongruous with his writing.
But these are exceptions. They cannot counterbalance D. PI. Lawrence's
beard nor Ford Maddox Ford's chins. And all the world now knows
that the authority on behaviorism in blondes is herself a jet brunette.—
