# Come on Skates!

### 
It has come to pass that Princeton and the University of Illinois break
into print only when something or other is forbidden there. But that
doesn't hurt publicity for the institutions as deans and other verboten
artists are glad to work overtime. The latest taboo is on roller skating
at Illinois. There the youth preparing for the nation's leadership is very
properly warned to keep off the paved streets lest motorists bounce it to
a land where the paving is all gold or good intentions.
How long will it be before roller skating and the craze for it tem
porarily speeds our own sober pacing among the arches? We fear a
swarm of wheeled pedestrians and shudder sympathetically with the
students who didn't learn in their youth.
At that, it wouldn't be a bad idea. There are enough sidewalks. In
view of the number of women who have learned swimming, enough in
structors to teach them to skate could probably be found. Skates are
always better when well oiled and doubtless enough of the fellows would
demonstrate this.
And how convenient skates would be when rushing back home to
Roble to beat the lockout!
