"College songs are too sentimental,"
says Olin Downes, New York Times
music critic, suggesting mat they
should be less lachrymose and more
symbolic of the true life undergradu
ates lead.
Stanford is very fortunate in this
respect. There was something about
the Far West virility of our early
days that avoided the sob stuff and
the ultra sophistication of the last few
years has had the same effect. Stan
lord hasn't many songs, nor remark
ably original ones, but they are less
ridiculous than those of many other
universities.
May what sentimentality there is in

them continue. The undergraduate's
daily conversation is not larded with
pious invocations of Alma Mater or
talk of "tender vistas ever new" but
sung under the right circumstances
these phrases send a tingle through
the spine that's worth coming to col
lege for.
It's not the words but the rhythm
land the spirit of the crowd that gets
you, the surging, almost aching emo
tional identification of the one with
the many that lifts an ordinary, un
romantic undergraduate into that
1 gloriously sentimental daze where a
collection of classrooms becomes an
Alma Mater and natural exuberance
over an athletic victory the Triumph
of an Ideal. —Donald Gledhill.
