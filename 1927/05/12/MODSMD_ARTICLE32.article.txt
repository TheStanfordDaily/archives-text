# SIDELIGHTS on LABOR DAY
## 
### 
Labor Day is a unique exhibition.
Whenever a horde of pen-pushing stu
dents forsakes the daily routine to take
up hoes, spades, axes, and other pioneer
instruments, and sets forth to conquer the
wilderness, peculiar things are bound to
happen. In the first place, there was en
tirely too much unprofessional enthusi
asm shown yesterday for the work. Two
woodcutters were observed vying with
each other in an attempt to cut a log in
the fewest strokes. Moreover, only about
two hundred dropped their tools when the
five-o'clock whistle blew. These were dis
turbing facts that brought anger and dis
gust to the hearts of the union truck
drivers engaged in hauling weeds.
* * *
A check of figures furnished by Jerry
Stewart, chairman of the barbecue com
mittee, shows that the following amounts
of food were supplied :
850 pounds of mutton (25 sheep)
50 gallons of coffee
1000 rolls
5000 sandwiches (2000 from Roble,
3000 from the sororities)
850 bricks of ice cream
40 gallons of beans
Sam McDowell, general superintendent
of yards of the University and sometime
barbecue cook, prepared the mutton.

The Santa Claus department was one
of the attractions of idle laborers looking
about at the sights. A dozen men, under
the direction of Don McCarty, were re
pairing, renovating, greasing, and paint
ing all the broken toys in need of atten
tion.
* * *
Considerable disruption of the routine
was caused when the Kinograms photog
rapher prevailed upon two of the 500 to
mount the tractor for an appealing pose.
Further effort went to waste as six hoers
of weeds were lured from their work to
pose with their hoes in the children's
dsandpile.
* * *
It was suspected that the band played
most of the time at allegro and presto in
order that the rhythm of the hoeing,
woodchopping, and sawing might be
speeded up. There was a noticeable slow
ing down in number of strokes per min
ute when "Marche Slave" was rendered
to the breeze.
"The girls are putting their own in
genuity and individuality into the making
of the doll's costumes," said Margaret
Carrithers, women's chairman, in re the
activities of the girls in designing and
fitting modish frocks for the children's
Mary Anns. No account was kept of the
number of times thimbles slipped off
fingers or needles drew blood.
* * *
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, president of
the Convalescent Home Board of Trus
tees, was present nearly all afternoon and
beamed happily as he watched the feverish
progress of the work.

woodchopping, and sawing might be
speeded up. There was a noticeable slow

to the breeze.
"The girls are putting their own in
genuity and individuality into the making
of the doll's costumes," said Margaret
Carrithers, women's chairman, in re the
activities of the girls in designing and
fitting modish frocks for the children's
Mary Anns. No account was kept of the
number of times thimbles slipped off
fingers or needles drew blood.

Dr. D. Charles Gardner, president of
the Convalescent Home Board of Trus
tees, was present nearly all afternoon and
beamed happily as he watched the feverish
progress of the work.
Labor Day is a unique exhibition.
Whenever a horde of pen-pushing stu
dents forsakes the daily routine to take
up hoes, spades, axes, and other pioneer
instruments, and sets forth to conquer the
wilderness, peculiar things are bound to
happen. In the first place, there was en
tirely too much unprofessional enthusi
asm shown yesterday for the work. Two
woodcutters were observed vying with
each other in an attempt to cut a log in
the fewest strokes. Moreover, only about
two hundred dropped their tools when the
five-o'clock whistle blew. These were dis
turbing facts that brought anger and dis
gust to the hearts of the union truck
drivers engaged in hauling weeds.

A check of figures furnished by Jerry
Stewart, chairman of the barbecue com
mittee, shows that the following amounts
of food were supplied :
850 pounds of mutton (25 sheep)
50 gallons of coffee
1000 rolls
5000 sandwiches (2000 from Roble,
3000 from the sororities)
850 bricks of ice cream
40 gallons of beans
Sam McDowell, general superintendent
of yards of the University and sometime
barbecue cook, prepared the mutton.

The Santa Claus department was one
of the attractions of idle laborers looking
about at the sights. A dozen men, under
the direction of Don McCarty, were re
pairing, renovating, greasing, and paint
ing all the broken toys in need of atten
tion.

Considerable disruption of the routine
was caused when the Kinograms photog
rapher prevailed upon two of the 500 to
mount the tractor for an appealing pose.
Further effort went to waste as six hoers
of weeds were lured from their work to
pose with their hoes in the children's
dsandpile.

It was suspected that the band played
most of the time at allegro and presto in
