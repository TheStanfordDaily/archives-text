# BERKELEY ATHLETES LEAVE U.C. CAMPUS FOR SUMMER TRIPS
## 
### 
BERKELEY, May 11.â€”With the re
cent departure of the baseball team
on the S.S. Tenyo Maru for Japan the
annual summer hegira of University
of California athletic teams has begun
again.
On May 22, shortly after midnight,
the track team, including eight men
and Coach Walter Christie, will leave
for the I.C.A.A.A.A. Immediately after
that event, the Boars will return to
Los Angeles, where they will enter the
Pacific Intercollegiates on June 3-4.
California's two-man tennis team,
Tom Stow and Dick Iloogs, will leave
for the East June 6 to defend the
national intercollegiate tennis title,
won in 1925 and again in 192 G.
Last, but not least either from the
point of view of numbers or import
ance, the California crews will depart
about June 15 for the Poughkeepsie
regatta to be held on the Hudson
River June 29. It is certain that the
Blue and Gold will be. represented by
both Varsity and Junior Varsity crews,
and it appears probable that the fresh
men will also go, as less than $5000
remains to be raised in the drive to
guarantee the trip for all three shells.
