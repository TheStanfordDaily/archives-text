# "WHAI PRICE GLORY?" IS AUTHENTIC DRAMA OF WAR
## 
### 
A departure from the usual flag-waving '
war comedy in that humor is subordinated I
to the authors' terrific arraignment of the i
futility of war, "What Price Glory," cur-!
rent Pendragon Players' offering, draws !
a vivid picturc of unvarnished and un- i
decorated war as it really is. The play,
written by Laurence Stallings and Max- j
well Anderson, the latter a Stanford grad- |
uate, will be presented Saturday night at
the Palo Alto high school auditorium, and j
is the club's last production of the year.
Stanford students make up a large pro- !

portion of the cast, with Delmer Daves as
Captain Flagg and James Quinby, '18, as
Sergeant Quirt, about whose affairs with
Charmaine, daughter of a French inn
keeper, the plot is woven.
Bull Session Found
The army's equivalent of a campus bull
session takes place in the first act, while
Sergeants Lipinsky, Goudy, and Kiper
discuss manners, morals, and the big mix
up. The soldier's religion is revealed
with unerring simplicity, in an emphatic
and informal fashion.
Those of the uninitiated who have
nursed a picture of warfare as a parade
of movie extras will be interested and
perhaps shocked at the second act, laid in
a cellar under a disputed town where the
most dramatic moments of the play are
mittee from the American Legion, who

I managed to picture with great fidelity the
have given valuable technical advice.
: Margaret Shedd Kisich, director, has
enacted. In placc of the sugar-coated
! heroics of fiction, Captain Flagg's ma
rines, mud-coated heroes of reality, live
I again the nerve-breaking stress of the
real thing, with all its attendant misery
| and hysteria, enlivened by the rollicking,
tenacious humor of the American soldier.
Service Men Aid
! Material aid in production is offered by
! the ex-service men in the cast, and a corn-

atmosphere and color of the war-torn
village in which the action of the play
takes place and of its occupants.
Behind all the comedy of speech and
character lies an accurate, serious por
trayal of the reaction of individuals to
the grim business of battle. Nervous ten
sion brings strange reversions to men
while under the strain of waiting for
that Something which always is lurking
around the corner in war. Among all the
myriad of post-war plays, "What Price
Glory" stands out first and alone as a
true representative of the experiences and
philosophy of fighting men under the
harsh, exacting conditions of modern war
fare.
Tickets are on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore, and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.

: Margaret Shedd Kisich, director, has
enacted. In placc of the sugar-coated
! heroics of fiction, Captain Flagg's ma
rines, mud-coated heroes of reality, live
I again the nerve-breaking stress of the
real thing, with all its attendant misery
| and hysteria, enlivened by the rollicking,
tenacious humor of the American soldier.
Service Men Aid
! Material aid in production is offered by
! the ex-service men in the cast, and a corn-

atmosphere and color of the war-torn
village in which the action of the play
takes place and of its occupants.
Behind all the comedy of speech and
character lies an accurate, serious por
trayal of the reaction of individuals to
the grim business of battle. Nervous ten
sion brings strange reversions to men
while under the strain of waiting for
that Something which always is lurking
around the corner in war. Among all the
myriad of post-war plays, "What Price
Glory" stands out first and alone as a
true representative of the experiences and
philosophy of fighting men under the
harsh, exacting conditions of modern war
fare.
Tickets are on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore, and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.


JUST A FRIENDLY GAME OF CRAPS, INDULGED IN
BY "WHAT PRICE GLORY?" SERGEANTS
A departure from the usual flag-waving '
war comedy in that humor is subordinated I
to the authors' terrific arraignment of the i
futility of war, "What Price Glory," cur-!
rent Pendragon Players' offering, draws !
a vivid picturc of unvarnished and un- i
decorated war as it really is. The play,
written by Laurence Stallings and Max- j
well Anderson, the latter a Stanford grad- |
uate, will be presented Saturday night at
the Palo Alto high school auditorium, and j
is the club's last production of the year.
Stanford students make up a large pro- !

portion of the cast, with Delmer Daves as
Captain Flagg and James Quinby, '18, as
Sergeant Quirt, about whose affairs with
Charmaine, daughter of a French inn
keeper, the plot is woven.
Bull Session Found
The army's equivalent of a campus bull
session takes place in the first act, while
Sergeants Lipinsky, Goudy, and Kiper
discuss manners, morals, and the big mix
up. The soldier's religion is revealed
with unerring simplicity, in an emphatic
and informal fashion.
Those of the uninitiated who have
nursed a picture of warfare as a parade
of movie extras will be interested and
perhaps shocked at the second act, laid in
a cellar under a disputed town where the
most dramatic moments of the play are
mittee from the American Legion, who

I managed to picture with great fidelity the
