# INTRAMURAL BALL TEAMS NARROW TO THREE FOR FINALS
## CAMPO MAY TAKE TITLE Gregory Will Bear Brunt of Delta Chi Attack; Has Good Backing 
### 
When the last man has been put out in
tomorrow's games, only three intramural
teams will remain to fight out the base
ball championship of the University. All
contests will start at 4 o'clock, and will
be played for seven innings.
On the varsity diamond will be staged
the Delta Chi-Phi Gamma Delta battle.
This game will be on the order of the
irresistible force and the immovable ob
ject, with the first slip carrying a victory
with it.
Gregory Bears Brunt
Gregory, Fiji pitcher, will bear the
brunt of the Delta Chi attack. He has
shown exceptional ability throughout the
season, and has been backed up by a good
outfield. He found most of his difficulties
in the Zete game, which he won 9-7. The
interesting part will be the result when
the Delta Chi batsmen step up to Greg
ory's pitching. These batsmen have won
the record of being the best all-around
team in the series. Not only do they hit,
but under Salzman, their pitcher, they
catch and throw with noticeable accuracy.
When any team can beat the Breakers 4-0,
as did the Delta Chi's, such a team enters
any other game heavy favorites to win.
El Campo will have a chance to win
back the championship that they lost last
year when they play El Tigre on the
Sequoia. The El Campo nine, well bal
anced, but with no outstanding men, will
have a hard time, however, to beat their
opponents.
Tigre Good
Smashing their way through every game
thus far, the El Tigres have already de
feated Sequoia jn an elimination game.
They have literally walloped the ball all
over the lot, led by Brown and Stock
bridge. If the El Campo pitcher once
weakens, the game will be all over but
chasing the balls. El Tigre furthermore
has a good hurler in Robinson, who al
lowed Sequoia only two hits.
By far the closest clash of the after
noon should be between the Betas and
Sigma Nu. The Betas have the best
pitcher in the league, but little else. The
Sigma Nu's have a hard-hitting team,
but take the hard luck end of all the
breaks. As a result, they were forced to
play off a tie for the league champion
ship.
Lewis Must Work
Doug Lewis of the Betas will have a
pretty task set out for him. He will have
an infield behind him that might go to
pieces if it is much encouraged to do so.
Opposing him will be Harry Todd, not
as good, but a calm, steady pitcher, with
plenty of stuff on the ball.

ory's pitching. These batsmen have won
the record of being the best all-around
team in the series. Not only do they hit,
but under Salzman, their pitcher, they
catch and throw with noticeable accuracy.
When any team can beat the Breakers 4-0,
as did the Delta Chi's, such a team enters
any other game heavy favorites to win.
El Campo will have a chance to win
back the championship that they lost last
year when they play El Tigre on the
Sequoia. The El Campo nine, well bal
anced, but with no outstanding men, will
have a hard time, however, to beat their
opponents.
Tigre Good
Smashing their way through every game
thus far, the El Tigres have already de
feated Sequoia jn an elimination game.
They have literally walloped the ball all
over the lot, led by Brown and Stock
bridge. If the El Campo pitcher once
weakens, the game will be all over but
chasing the balls. El Tigre furthermore
has a good hurler in Robinson, who al
lowed Sequoia only two hits.
By far the closest clash of the after
noon should be between the Betas and
Sigma Nu. The Betas have the best
pitcher in the league, but little else. The
Sigma Nu's have a hard-hitting team,
but take the hard luck end of all the
breaks. As a result, they were forced to
play off a tie for the league champion
ship.
Lewis Must Work
Doug Lewis of the Betas will have a
pretty task set out for him. He will have
an infield behind him that might go to
pieces if it is much encouraged to do so.
Opposing him will be Harry Todd, not
as good, but a calm, steady pitcher, with
plenty of stuff on the ball.
When the last man has been put out in
tomorrow's games, only three intramural
teams will remain to fight out the base
ball championship of the University. All
contests will start at 4 o'clock, and will
be played for seven innings.
On the varsity diamond will be staged
the Delta Chi-Phi Gamma Delta battle.
This game will be on the order of the
irresistible force and the immovable ob
ject, with the first slip carrying a victory
with it.
Gregory Bears Brunt
Gregory, Fiji pitcher, will bear the
brunt of the Delta Chi attack. He has
shown exceptional ability throughout the
season, and has been backed up by a good
outfield. He found most of his difficulties
in the Zete game, which he won 9-7. The
interesting part will be the result when
the Delta Chi batsmen step up to Greg
ory's pitching. These batsmen have won
the record of being the best all-around
team in the series. Not only do they hit,
but under Salzman, their pitcher, they
catch and throw with noticeable accuracy.
