# BODANSKY PREPARES BIOCHEMISTRY WORK
## 
### 
Word has just been received that Dr.
Meyer Bodansky, who was at Stanford
last year as acting assistant professor of
biochemistry, is now preparing a labora
tory manual to accompany his text "An
Introduction to Physiological Chemistry"
which came off the press in January.
Dr. Bodansky is a member of the faculty
of the University of Texas Medical
School.
Bodansky's text, published by John
Wiley & Son, has already been adopted
by fifteen institutions, and Dr. Graham
Lusk of Cornell Medical College says
of it,"I think it is one of the best presen
tations of the chemistry of physiology
which we have in the English language."
