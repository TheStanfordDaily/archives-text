# CHINA WANTS TO RECLAIM SOVEREIGNTYâ€”CHENG SUN YAT SEN'S PRINCIPLES FURNISH MOTIVE CHINESE SUPPORT MOVEMENTS. NOT INDIVIDUALS

What cio the Chinese themselves think !
about the present- confused state of af- j
fairs in China? Y. V. Cheng, president |
of the Chinese Students' Club on the cam- :
put, said recently: "We don't want to j
drive out all foreigners, but we want to I
reclaim our sovereignty. If you crusl#the I
militarists you crush foreign imperial- j
ists." He added, however, that the Chi- j
nese people desire that foreign capitalists j
should develop the resources which the j
Chinese themselves are unable to exploit!
for the present. However, China wishes,
to retain those functions which belong j
properly to any independent nation. She |
wants tariff autonomy, the elimination of .
foreign concessions, and the return of all
territories within China now held by for
eign powers. The return of the Shan
tung province to China by Japan was a
step in the right direction, he believes.
Unity Sought
The principal aim of the Chinese peo
ple is to secure unity, he said. The Brit
ish and Japanese governments pay the !
Chinese militarists to crcate a state of
civil war. Although the Chinese have
ideals that ire essentially similar, money
is sufficiently alluring to inspire the war
lords to create perpetual strife. Since
l f JlB, when the so-called "literary revo
lution" took place, there has been an
"awakening of a national consciousness,"
hays Cheng.
The principles of Dr. Sun Yat Sen are

those which furnish the motives for the
people in their struggle against foreign
imperialism, according to Cheng. Nation
alism, democracy, and socialism are the
central criteria or Dr. Sun's teachings.
Hankow Cited
The attempt to create a civil govern
ment superior to the military leaders has
almost become consummate in the Han
kow government, Cheng asserted. Chiang
Kai Shek was the chief commissioner of
this government until he became the cen
tral figure in the more conservative Nan
king government. The purposes of the
factions both at Hankow and Nanking
are the same, Cheng said, but Chiang
wants to force out foreign imperialists
slowly whereas the commissioners at
Hankow want immediate evacuation by
all those individuals or governments
which are usurping the sovereignty of
China.
"The Chinese will no longer support
merely a person, but a movement," said
Cheng. If Chiang Kai Shek allows him
self to become opposed to the true inter
ests of the Chinese nationalists, the peo
ple will secure a new leader, he believes.
However, he attributes the success of the
nationalists to the military genius of
Chiang. In spite of this fact, Cheng
stated, the Chinese are sufficiently en
lightened to be able to desert him when
his selfish ambitions intensified by foreign
encouragement might cause him to make
himself dictator.
