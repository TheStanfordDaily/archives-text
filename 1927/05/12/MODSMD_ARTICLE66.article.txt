# FOOD PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION STUDIED AT CAMPUS INSTITUTE
## Research Commenced Under Carnegie Foundation At Close of War 
### 
A scientific study of food production
and distribution, nutrition, and dietetics,
with the aim of laying a foundation for
the determination of sound national poli
cies with respect to food, is the objective
of the Food Research Institute. The In
stitute was proposed by 1 lerbert Hoover,
'95, Food Administrator during the World
War, and was founded in 1921 by the
Carnegie Corporation of New York and
the Trustees of Stanford University. The
Carnegie Foundation guarantees funds
for the work for a period of ten years,
and Stanford provides the necessary
quarters.
The Institute is housed in Rooms 30
to 35 in the inner quadrangle, formerly
the German building. Experimental re
search is carried on in the chemical and
botanical laboratories.
Doctors Carl L. Alsbcrg, Joseph S.
Davis, and Alonzo E. Taylor are the
three directors of the Institute. They also
offer occasional courses in the depart
ments of Chemistry and Economics, and
guide the researches of certain graduate
students registered in these departments.
The directors emphasize the economic
phases of food problems, though without
disregarding the scientific aspects of food
production and consumption. It was felt
that there was a special need for intelli
gent, concentrated study of these phases
by an organization which was subject to
no political or business influence, which
can attack its problems patiently and
without bias, and which can afford to
speak freely on controversial matters,
j It was decided not to deal with food
problems in general, but to concentrate
first upon one important food product.
Wheat was chosen as the dominant factor
in the world food situation.
The objective in this direction is a
thorough understanding of the wheat,
flour, and baking industries at home and
abroad, and of the laws which govern
the production and flow of wheat and
wheat products. Instead of sending field
workers about the country, the directors
determined to utilize the information al
ready being collected, and to encourage
the compilation of additional data by
organizations in a position to dp such
work economically.
The Institute is now issuing a serial
publication, "Wheat Studies," published
by the University Press.
