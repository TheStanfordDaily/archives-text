# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Oh G! on the Green at last!" A i
study of the Geography of this huge
Golf Ball called the earth discloses a
goodly number of champions and near
champions whose names begin with
the eighth letter of the alphabet. !
Searching through the records, it is !
possible to find two former. United
States amateur champions, one former I
United States women's champion, and i
one former British women's title
holder who belong in the "Golf Alpha
bet —G."
Foremost among the G's hi golf his
tory is Robert Gardner, of Chicago and
Yale, twice winner of and twice run-'
ner-up in the U.S. amateur champion-,
ships. Gardner also gained fame as I
the holder of the world's pole-vault r
record of 13 feet, 1 inch, made in 1912. j
He won this country's highest golf I
honor in 1909 and 1915, finished sec-;
ond in 1916 and 1921, and reached the '
final round of the British amateur
tournament in 1920.
The victor over Gardner in the U.S. !
amateur championship at St. Louis in
1921 was another G. Jesse Guilford, of
the Woodland Golf Club, called the;
"Boston Siege Gun," because of his |
terrific hitting power and long driving
ability.
Chief among the iadies, for whom ,
kind fate has played the "Song of
Victory" (on the G string, I suppose!)

are Miss F. C. Griscom, U.S. champion
back in 1900; Miss M. Graham, winner
of the British title a year later; Miss 1
Elsie Grant-Suttie, the winner in 1910;
Jean Gassiat, French champion in
1912; Miss Mary Gourlay, French
champion in 1923; and Mrs. Percy:
Garon, runner-up in the 1926 British
women's tournament.
Three cheers and a Tiger should go
to Mrs. W. A. Gavin, thrice winner of
runner-up position in the U.S. women's
national championship. The Tiger is
for the French title, which she won in
1922. I believe she was also Canadian
champion.

i (J —whiz! I almost forgot Watts
Gunn, who upset all dope and preee
| dent by reaching the final round of
! the first amateur championship he
j ever played in! Bobby Jones took him
! along to Oakmont in 11>25 for "experi
-1 ence" —and Jones nearly got the ex-
I perience.
Honorable Mention: the New York
! Pro, John Golden; the five British
j players, George Gadd, Herbert Gaudin,
| Harold Gillies, George Glennie, and
I John Graham; the Englishman by
I adoption, Douglas Grant; and the
! French tennis player-golfer. Andre
| Gobert.
