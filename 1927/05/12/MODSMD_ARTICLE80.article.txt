# GIL DOBIE, CORNELL COACH, SAYS SPRING PRACTICE ESSENTIAL
## 
### 
"Spring football? We have to have it,"
says Gil Dobie, coach of the Cornell
eleven. "The game is getting to be too
intricate to make it safe to depend en
tirely on fall work. Critics fail to con
sider the fact that tnen are in college for
the purpose of gaining knowledge in the
classroom and laboratory."
If the students had nothing else to do,
nothing else to think of, he states, per
haps the men could learn with some thor
oughness this new game of football in
two or three years. At present, though,
that is impossible if they are to pay ade
quate attention to college work.
Dobie believes that football would be
a far better game with the lateral pass,
the shift, the spread plays, and the huddle
taken out entirely. Football is too com
plex as it is, and with such unnecessary
features, the players have an exceptionally
difficult time to learn all the plays and
rules.
"I lecture," the Cornell coach contin
ued, "before football classes in the Uni
versity of Illinois summer school for six
weeks each year. In that time, devoted in
tensively to football, it is possible to do
little more than scratch the surface of the
most intricate sport in existence. Yet I
have to try to teach the same things to
my squad here in the fall when they re
port to mc at 5 or 5 :30 cach evening after
a long day in classrooms and laboratories,
arid they are still facing a couple of hours
of study later on in the evening."
