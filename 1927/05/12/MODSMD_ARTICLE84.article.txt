Josephine was first married to Beau
harnais, but after he was guillotined
for being a revolutionist she met
Napoleon. She was imprisoned at this
time, but at the fall of Robespierre she
was freed. A charming woman, she
was prepared for a fine marriage, but
was disappointed to have married only
a viscount. She was true neither to
her first husband nor to Napoleon.
Napoleon's family was most influen
tial in Ajaccio, and of their many chil
dren he showed force superior to the
rest of the family. At the age of six
teen he was made second lieutenant
and soon advanced to commander. He
married Josephine, who was older than
he, and was given command of the
army in Italy. While Napoleon con
ducted the campaign, Josephine con
ducted herself in an ignoble fashion
in France. He left Egypt when he
heard of the fall of the Directorate,
and arrived in Paris In 1799. He gave
enormous salaries to his officers, and
wanted a luxurious society to be the
result.
In 1804 Napoleon was made Em
peror. He was forced to divorce Jose
phine "for the good of the state." He
saw that she was well provided for,
since he loved her, but Josephine was
always in debt. After her death, Napo
leon thought and spoke lovingly of
her until his last days at St. Helena.
