# GRADUATE ATHLETES ARE HELD TO BLAME FOR SPORT TROUBLES

"One great trouble with iniereollegi- i
ate sports is that the alumnus athlete
of an older generation cannot realize
the change in athletics, cannot realize
how much more time and thought are
given tothem, how much more like a
big industry they have become, how
they have been stripped of all fun,"
writes Jefferson D. Burrus, Jr., in
"The Present Intercollegiate Athletic j
System," published by the University
of Wisconsin "Union."
The booklet is a critical essay on
the present sports system, and, accord- i
ing to the publishers, is probably the
first comprehensive study of the situa- :
tion ever written by\ student-athlete. |
The author's participation has appar-!
ently not made him bitter toward ath- j
letics; his love of sports lies at the j
root of his desire that they be placed
on as high a plane as possible.
In his argument, Burrus writes that
the present problem is the affixing of
athletics to their proper sphere in uni
versity life. For its present condition, j
he says, the athletic phase of collegi
ate life has run away with itself.
"Too much emphasis upon football
in any person's life," Burrus claims, j
"seems absolutely ridiculous unless
that person intends to become a foot-1

ball coach. And this is just as true of
any other sport. As they now stand,
any sport a collegian enters into be- !
comes profession with him."
"One great trouble with iniereollegi- i
ate sports is that the alumnus athlete
of an older generation cannot realize
the change in athletics, cannot realize
how much more time and thought are
given tothem, how much more like a
big industry they have become, how
they have been stripped of all fun,"
