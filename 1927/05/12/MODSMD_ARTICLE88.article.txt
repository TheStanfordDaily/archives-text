# CALIFORNIA LEADS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY USE
## 
### 
California citizens have a per capita
library book consumption thirty-five j
per cent greater than any other state
in the Union, and more than three
times as large as the average for the
country, figures compiled by the Na-!
tional Education Association show.
Figurs for the survey were gathered
from the library records of the vari- !
ous states during the year 1925. Cali
fornia also has a smaller percentage
of its population without library ser
vices near at hand than any other
states except Connecticut and New
Hampshire.
