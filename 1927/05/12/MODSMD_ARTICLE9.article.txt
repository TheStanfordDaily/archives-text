Monotyping is a freehand method of
producing prints. An oil painting is
made on a piece of metal and a damp
paper is placed over it. Printing con
tact transfers the painting from the
metal to the paper. This produces an
neitirely different printed surface than
any other method. Practically all the
well-known artists of Europe take up
monotyping work as a hobby. It has,
however, but recently been introduced
into America, according to Pedro
Lemos, director of the Stanford Mu
seum and Art Gallery.
