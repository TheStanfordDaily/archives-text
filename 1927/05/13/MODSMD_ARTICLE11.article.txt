## 
### 
Phi Gamma Delta 10, Delta Chi 3
Beta Theta Pi 8, Sigma Nu 0
El Tigre 7, El Campo 2
Narrowing the field down to three
teams in the final spurt for the Uni
versity intramural baseball championship,
Phi Gamma Delta, Beta Theta Pi, and
El Tigre will enter the semi-final round
next Monday as the result of victories
yesterday afternoon in preliminary play
offs.
In the first game of the afternoon, Phi
Gamma Delta took an unexpected win
from Delta Chi, 10 to 3; Beta Theta Pi
then swept through Sigma Nu by an
8 to 0 score; and El Tigre took a clean
cut victory from El Campo, 7 to 2.
Fiji's Stage Upset
The Fiji win was the only upset of the
day's play, both the other teams having
been given the edge in the dope. With
seven errors chalked up for the Delta Chi
fielders in the first inning, three hits by
the victors was enough to put ten men
across the home plate, and the game was
won. From then on Salsman was mas
ter of the situation and the Fijis went
scoreless for six consecutive frames.
Gregory pitched good ball for the vic
tors, to hold the heavy-hitting Delta Chi
nine to only four runs, one of which was
made in the ragged first inning. Biag
gini tripled after Jeffers got on by a
single, to score the latter. In the third,
Jeffers again featured, singling, stealing
second, and home on an error.
Betas Formidable
Beta, in shutting out Sigma Nu, estab
lished itself as the most serious contend
er for the championship. Doug Lewis,
on the mound for the victors, pitched
nearly perfect ball, allowing only three
scattered hits, besides playing an error
