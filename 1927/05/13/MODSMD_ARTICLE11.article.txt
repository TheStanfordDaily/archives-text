yesterday afternoon in preliminary play
offs.

Gamma Delta took an unexpected win
from Delta Chi, 10 to 3; Beta Theta Pi
then swept through Sigma Nu by an

Fiji's Stage Upset
The Fiji win was the only upset of the
day's play, both the other teams having
been given the edge in the dope. With
seven errors chalked up for the Delta Chi
fielders in the first inning, three hits by
the victors was enough to put ten men
across the home plate, and the game was
won. From then on Salsman was mas
ter of the situation and the Fijis went
scoreless for six consecutive frames.
Gregory pitched good ball for the vic
tors, to hold the heavy-hitting Delta Chi
nine to only four runs, one of which was
made in the ragged first inning. Biag
gini tripled after Jeffers got on by a
single, to score the latter. In the third,
Jeffers again featured, singling, stealing
second, and home on an error.
Betas Formidable
Beta, in shutting out Sigma Nu, estab
lished itself as the most serious contend
er for the championship. Doug Lewis,
on the mound for the victors, pitched
nearly perfect ball, allowing only three
scattered hits, besides playing an error
less game in the field. The eight Beta
runs came from ten hits, very few errors
contributing to scores.
Kissinger started the tallying in the
first inning by slamming out a home run
after Thomas got on first by an error.
Jn the second another run was added
when Watt singled, scoring Tibbe ahead
of him. In its half of the frame, Sigma
Nu had what proved to be its only chance
to chalk up a run. After Watt stopped
a hot liner in short, Todd singled, stole
second, and was in a position to score
when Retuel hit into a force-out at the
plate.
McKey Homes
McKey started the third for the Betas
with another home run, and before
Thomas fanned for the third and last
out, the score stood 7 to 0.
Robertson, who collected two of the
three hits for the losers, batted a single
in the last half of this inning, but was
caught on the hidden ball stunt a second
later to end all hopes.
The last run for the Betas came when
McKey hit his second home run in the
fourth. In the remaining three innings,
the winners threatened several times, but
Todd tightened up at critical moments
and his otherwise weak infield came to
his rescue.
El Tigre Sews Up Game
El Tigre sewed up their game in the
first inning after their opponents made
one of their two scores, by forcing in
four runs. H. Brown took first after
being hit by a pitched ball, Cohen and D.
Brown got on by errors, after which
Stockbridge singled, scoring three, later
being forced home, helped by another
error.
One more tally was added in the fifth,
and two were brought across the plate in
the sixth. El Campo started a belated
rally in their half of the seventh after
two were out. Two men got to base on
an error and a hit, and when Garibotto
muffed Britten's hit in short, one run
came across the plate and Ross struck
out to finish the game.
Hunter Fans Eleven
Charles Hunter, on the mound for the
victors, allowed ten hits, but fanned
eleven batsmen and with good support
was never in danger.
The three teams, scheduled to fight it
out for the coveted championship, will be
paired for the concluding semi-final to be
played on Monday, the finals date to be
set later in the week.

and two were brought across the plate in
the sixth. El Campo started a belated

Fiji's Stage Upset
The Fiji win was the only upset of the
day's play, both the other teams having
been given the edge in the dope. With
seven errors chalked up for the Delta Chi
fielders in the first inning, three hits by
the victors was enough to put ten men
across the home plate, and the game was
won. From then on Salsman was mas
ter of the situation and the Fijis went
scoreless for six consecutive frames.
Gregory pitched good ball for the vic
tors, to hold the heavy-hitting Delta Chi
nine to only four runs, one of which was
made in the ragged first inning. Biag
gini tripled after Jeffers got on by a
single, to score the latter. In the third,
Jeffers again featured, singling, stealing
second, and home on an error.
Betas Formidable
Beta, in shutting out Sigma Nu, estab
lished itself as the most serious contend
er for the championship. Doug Lewis,
on the mound for the victors, pitched
nearly perfect ball, allowing only three
scattered hits, besides playing an error
less game in the field. The eight Beta
runs came from ten hits, very few errors
contributing to scores.
Kissinger started the tallying in the
first inning by slamming out a home run
after Thomas got on first by an error.
Jn the second another run was added
when Watt singled, scoring Tibbe ahead
of him. In its half of the frame, Sigma
Nu had what proved to be its only chance
to chalk up a run. After Watt stopped
a hot liner in short, Todd singled, stole
second, and was in a position to score
when Retuel hit into a force-out at the
plate.
McKey Homes
McKey started the third for the Betas
with another home run, and before
Thomas fanned for the third and last
out, the score stood 7 to 0.
Robertson, who collected two of the
three hits for the losers, batted a single
in the last half of this inning, but was
caught on the hidden ball stunt a second
later to end all hopes.
The last run for the Betas came when
McKey hit his second home run in the
fourth. In the remaining three innings,
the winners threatened several times, but
Todd tightened up at critical moments
and his otherwise weak infield came to
his rescue.
El Tigre Sews Up Game
El Tigre sewed up their game in the
first inning after their opponents made
