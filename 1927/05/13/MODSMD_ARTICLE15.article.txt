# ENTRIES IN 100-YARD FREE STYLE PRESENT FORMIDABLE ARRAY
## Harrison, Williams, Van den Akker, Christensen Are Champion Four

Prospective entries for the University
100-yard free style swim on May 18
look like an array of Pacific Coast cham
pions. Reg Harrison, Kryne Van den
Akker, Bob Williams, A1 Christcnsen
are more than enough to make the cen
tury race an interesting one.
Since the rules of the championships
prohibit one man from competing after
winning one first place, each entrant is
pointed for one special race, although he
may enter several others. Harrison, Van
den Akker, and Christensen are banking
principally on the 100 for their medal.
Wally O'Connor will not compete in any
event, and thus the results should be ex
ceptionally interesting.
Seven Entries in 220
Probable entries for the 220 free style
are Carl Stevenson, Reg Harrison, Kryne
Van den Akker, Ogden Driggs, Joe Pe
ters, Bob Williams, and Hadley Bramel.
Driggs, Williams, and Bramel will pro
vide the excitement in this event, for all
three have proved during the week
that they are capable of making good
times. Driggs has won the Junior P.A.A.
220-yard championship. Brarr|el raced
Carl Stevenson across Lagunita with
startling speed. Williams has already
proven his capability in varsity meets.
Stevenson Favored
Stevenson is pointed for the 440. and
will suffer little from Kinkead, Pahl,
Driggs, and Bramel. In the 220-yard
breast stroke, both Ophuls and West,
the two outstanding entrants, have been
making the same times during practice.
Thornton and Conradi of the freshman
team will press these two throughout the
race for third place.
As Hobdy haS decided not to enter
the backstroke, the medal should go to
either Ted Smith or Phil Brooks. If
Stevenson, however, enters this race, he
should win it without any difficulty. Walt
Mills is doped to .win the diving, with
Smith second, and Throndson third.
