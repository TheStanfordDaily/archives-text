## 
### 
Far from the haunts of the jang
ling typewriter, the green eyeshade,
and muttered curses of the desperate
night editor, the hard-working mem
bers of the Stanford Daily staff will
commune with nature and weiner
wursts at the annual Daily picnic
to he held Saturday, May 28.
Plans for the occasion are already
being laid under the direction of a
committee headed by Maxine Gush
ing, and the day in tlie great wide
open spaces where men are men and
type-lice are temporarily wood-ticks
is contemplated with delight by the
entire staff.
