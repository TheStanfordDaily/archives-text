# SAME QUALITIES OF SUCCESS IN COLLEGE AID FOR LATER WORK
## Assembly Speaker Discusses New Opportunities in Industrial Life 
### 
"The qualities which lead a man or
woman to make good in college—a
willingness to work, a desire for co
operation, and a "liking for people—
are the same as those which cause you
to make good in industry. Take these
things out into industry and make it
interesting!"
Bringing this enthusiastic message
to the University assembly yesterday
morning, Mrs. Lillian Moller Gilbreth,
one of America's foremost engineers,
discussed "New Opportunities in In
dustry." She emphasized particularly
that "young men and women coming
into industry have a chance to come
in much better informed than their
elders already in office."
Belief in Work Stressed
Among the new industrial develop
ments Mrs. Gilbreth finds that the
chief prerequisite is a "re«\l belief that
work is a satisfaction." In her opinion
the American business man, with his
devotion to his woik, is admitted to
have the right system, and she be
lieves also that the prevalent belief is
erroneous which takes it for granted
that our universities are sending out
students who think that work is a
necessary evil, or a means to an end
of leisure; rather, they are teaching
the philosophy which she gives to her
prerequisite to success in industry.
"A new type of economics is coming
to the fore," she said. "The idea of
increased output is being more and
more favorably received by the work
ers.
"No one can make a success in in
dustry without some training in psych
ology," she continued, "and the ability
to sell one's self a!hd one's subject to
the workers being tested is most es
sential. There are many opportunities
waiting for you who have had training
in the newer type of psychology." In
this regard she noted especially the
increased usage of tests in the various
industries, offering increased oppor
tunities to skilled workers in this field.
"But stand on the side of tests that
are worthwhile," Mrs. Gilhreth warned.
"Tie up with industries that are pro
gressive enough to keep records of
some sort, for the time will come when
everyone seeking a job will have the
right to set some requirements, just
as the employer now sets his stand
ards. The worker will be privileged to
demand a living wage, and more, ade
quate records to show what he has
done."
Technique Important
She stressed the progress made in
teaching facilities during the last five
years, declaring that all educational
problems, especially in industry, must
be measured with the latest technique.
Department stores are leading this
field, but still they have as a whole
unstandardized education.
"Sex has made no difference to me
nationally or internationally, and sex
differences in industry are so slight,
women should have no fears about
entering any field," concluded Mrs.
Gilhreth.
