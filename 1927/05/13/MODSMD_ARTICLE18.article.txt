# SAME QUALITIES OF SUCCESS IN COLLEGE AID FOR LATER WORK
## Assembly Speaker Discusses New Opportunities in Industrial Life 
### 
"The qualities which lead a man or
woman to make good in college—a
willingness to work, a desire for co
operation, and a "liking for people—
are the same as those which cause you
to make good in industry. Take these
things out into industry and make it

"No one can make a success in in

this regard she noted especially the
increased usage of tests in the various
industries, offering increased oppor
tunities to skilled workers in this field.
"But stand on the side of tests that
