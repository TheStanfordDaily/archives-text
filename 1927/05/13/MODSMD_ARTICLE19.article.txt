## 
### 
"The University gives a firm but nar- j
row foundation upon which we must pro-!
ceed to build laterally before we can
hope to reach toward the sky," said Dr.
Stanley Herold speaking on "Preparation
for Success" at the annual spring smoker
of the Geological and Mining Society held
at the Old Union last night.
The transformation in the teaching of i
mining and geology at Stanford as dis- j
cussed by Herold, who expressed the hope I
for a six-vear instead of a four-yitir!
course in geology in the future.
Dean Hoover of the School of Engi- j
neering advised his hearers not to become i
discouraged despite the gloomy outlook j
in the mining industry but, "to throw a i
blanket over their shoulders, get in a j
flivver, and go find a job."
Speaking of geology as a profession,
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, head of the Geol- j
ogy department, told his audience "not to |
hunt the job, but to let the job hunt you, J
and to be prepared when the offer comes." i
