# Our Lucky Day

'I here was a tifiie that most people were sure disaster was in the air
when the thirteenth of the month fell on a Friday, and thought there was
110 secure moment for them until the day had passed, and the fourteenth
had dawned. Mainly through the aid of education the modern world has
learned to disbelieve these superstitions. Today we go to work as we
would 011 any other day, and would probably never guess that there was
ever any historical significance connected with Friday the thirteenth if
it were not for feature stories appearing in the world's press. Even
broken mirrors and black cats are now relics of by-gone days.
A test was made at the University of California recently to see just
how superstitious college students really were. A ladder was placed near
the entrance of the university and only five out of 1,385 passers-by
stepped aside to avoid walking under the ladder.
Education has done its work, and Fridays, even when they are con
nected with the thirteenth of the month, are indicative of nothing un
pleasant except fish any more.
