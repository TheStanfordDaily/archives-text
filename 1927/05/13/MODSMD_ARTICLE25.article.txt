# One of a Thousand

### 
The University of California staged a mob scene in the form of the
annual commencement exercises Wednesday morning in the Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley. Over two thousand students were given paper
(sheep skin was just out) certificates for their four years' pleasure at
the institution. The most impersonal ceremony imaginable was staged
in the great football bowl. But the services could not have been other
wise with so many applicants for graduation.
The commencement exercise at Berkeley was just one of many similar
performances that will be staged about the United States this Spring.
It typifies the modern system of education that is designed for the
masses. The Wooster Voicc says in a recent article: "It is undoubtedly
true that too many students are graduated from colleges. Either quantity
or quality must be sacrificed. There is not room for both of these 011 the
same campus."
At California and other large state universities quality is being sacri
ficed at the expense of quantity. In the past college graduates have led
the community and the world, but with the rate that state institutions are
turning men and women out into the world with diplomas under their
arms, there will soon be no one to follow their lead. In other words the
ranks have been raised, and all the privates have been made lieutenants.
The leaders will have to be developed more carefully in the future, and
more time will have to be spent on their training. The college graduates
will have to be lead by someone. The grhduate universities will undoubt
edly be the training schools for the leaders of men in the future.
