# Applying Grid Methods to Studies
## 
### 
Hamilton Holt, president of Rollins College, spoke as follows con
cerning college football:
"Football has the great merit of being the only thing really well
taught in our colleges. Imagine a coach keeping a duffer or quitter on
the squad. Imagine a candidate being granted six cuts from practice.
Football is taken too seriously for that. No such rigid standards are
attempted in the classroom. The coach demands and gets the best in a
man. Every graduate of an American college knows that fully a third of
the degrees are unearned.
"If American colleges will not live up to the amateurism in athletics,
which they profess, or publicly adopt the professionalism, which they
practice, I submit that no college that pretends to hold up moral standards
before the young can take part in intercollegiate athletics."
President Holt admits that the system used in football brings results,
but instead of endeavoring to apply the same system to studies he advo
cates that the present athletic system, which brings such good results, be
torn down. There seems to be very little reasoning there. A football
coach either because of the interest that is in the sport, or because of the
prize that is offered for making the team, is able to obtain results. It is
therefore a good system. Now, if Mr. Holt wanted to do something
constructive, he would try to figure out some plan by which chemistry,
economics and English can be made as interesting, and establish the same
football spirit in academic work.
