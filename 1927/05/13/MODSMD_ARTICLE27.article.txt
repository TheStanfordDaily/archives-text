The University of Washington just can't let the poor girls alone.
Now its daily paper asks : Should women affect masculinity or femininity?
"Now there is a sudden reaction to women's physical education (which
gives women tho masculine attitude). Men are said again to prefer the girl
who 'clings.' Several Washington men have declared that tliey always did
prefer a 'clinging' girl. Perhaps this is because somo men like to believe
themselves king of their little worlds, and the 'clinging vino' is more con
ducive to this belief."
