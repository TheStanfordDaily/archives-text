The Stanford stage has been kept
clean in the past and we intend to
keep it clean in the future, said Presi
dent Wilbur. So tonight Palo Alto
High School Auditorium will run the
risk of contamination from "What
Price Glory?"
Stanford hud an opportunity to have
that play, written hv a Stanford man,
and universally applauded by critics
produced on its own stage. But the
president would have none of it. The
play was not sponsored, he said, by
the campus dramatic authorities and
besides it was not, he implied, the
type of play that we had produced
here in the past or intended to pro
duce in the future.
This first cause sounds somewhat
like a legitimate one for refusing the
Stanford auditorium for the produc
tion.'We would have given a great
deal to have had the president let it
go at that. Granting, for purpose of

argument, that the exact point where
a play becomes unclean is rather hard
to locate, we are nevertheless ob-
I sessed by the thought that the presi
dent's expressed opinion on this mat
ter will, in many quarters, put Stan
ford culturally, in the category of
j Dayton, Tennessee.
So far as we know the play "What
Price Glory?" is the most noteworthy
contribution any Stanford man has
ever made to the written drama. What
| ever vulgar passions and manners its
characters may possess the general
i effect produced by the drama is of
! such a nature as to put it above any
j sort of censure, Certainly it. is dedi
cated to an ideal more noble than that
| behind the larger part of the plays
j presented at Stanford.
Jt is sincerely to be regretted that
the president of the University has
left so much room for misunderstand-
I ing in the attitude he has taken.
