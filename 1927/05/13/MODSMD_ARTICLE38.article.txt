# FLORIDA PROFESSOR CONDEMNS ATHLETIC POLICY IN COLLEGES
## 
### 
"If American colleges will not live
np to the amateurism in athletics
which they profess, or publicly adopt
the professionalism which they prac
tice, I maintain that no college that
pretends to hold up moral standards
before the young can take part in
intercollegiate athletics," President
Hamilton Holt, of Rollins College,
Florida, declares in a sweeping con
demnation of collegiate athletic poli
cies in the "Review of Reviews" for
May.
"If it is impossible to find enough
colleges geographically proximate to
play with under purely amateur condi
tions, I am ready to suggest that we
abandon our pretense of amateurism
and come out open and above-board
for professionalism." President Holt
concluded his challenge by saying, "I
would be perfectly willing to print in
our catalog just how much we pay our
pitcher, quarterback, and high-jump
er."
