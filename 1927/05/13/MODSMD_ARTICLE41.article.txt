# OPERATOR PHOTOGRAPHS PICTURES ON PHOTOSTAT

Taking pictures of pictures is the ,
specialty of the L T niversity photogra
phic "studio" located at the Corpora
tion Yard Substation. Technically
speaking, this process is known as (
photostating, but, as Powell Tliomp- ,
son, who acts as head photographer,
says, "It's just about like taking pic- ,
tures of people except that I don't \
have to flatter my subjects to keep i
their trade."
Tho "sitters" in this case consist j
largely of drawings of different kinds, |
such as graphs, building plans, maps
and diagrams of machinery sent to j
be photographed by the various de- !
partments. The School of Engineering j
depends on the photostating process, J
together with blue-printing, for the j
hundreds of prints used in Engineering ;
courses. The Psychology department :
is also a steady patron of the photo- ;
staling studio, where graphs and
charts can be reproduced at a moder- !
ate cost. Besides technical matter,
printed pages and black and white il- j
lustrations from rare books photgraph
clearly; collectors of fine books in
Palo Alto and the vicinity, as well as
at the Stanford Library, make use of .
the photostating process for this pur-1
pose.
Resembles Camera
The photostating machine itself
looks something like a large camera 1
and operates on much the same princi- I

pies. Specially prepared photostat
paper serves as the film, and the sub
ject to be photographed is "posed"
under a heavy piece of plate glass,
which keeps it flat during the expo
sure. After being exposed, this film is
automatically run through a fixing so
lution and is then washed and dried.
A blue-printing machine is a second
important feature in the equipment of
this studio. To make a blue-print, black
ink drawings must be made on spe
cially prepared transparent paper or
on very fine linen. Blue-print paper,
which is sensitive to light, is then
placed underneath, are exposed to
strong light produced by mercur?
"daylight tubes." After being exposed
for a short time the original drawing
is removed, and the blue-print paper
is left bearing the impression of the
lines in the original drawing.
This condition results from the fact
that the portion of the blue-print
paper which was protected from the
action of the light by ink lines has
remained white, while the rest of the
surface, which has been exposed to
the light, has turned blue. Tlie blue
print paper, as this impression is
called, is then washed in clear water
to make the impression permanent.
"Van Dyke" prints are made by a simi
lar process on a different sort of paper,
and are the same as bitie-prints ex
cept that the background is black in
stead of blue.
