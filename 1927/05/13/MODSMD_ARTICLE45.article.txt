# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Ask almost any read judge of horse
manship who is the greatest jockey
How in the business of booting home
thoroughbreds, and nine out of ten
%viU answer you, "Laverne Fator, of
the Rancocas Stable." Some will go
Csven farther and will say that Fator
Is one of the two greatest American
Jockeys of all time.
Be that as it may, Laverne Fator,
fcvho rides for Harry Sinclair, has never
tmd the thrill of bringing in a Ken
tucky Derby winner, and it may be
that his ambition will be realized dur
ing the present week. For if the Ran-
Cocas stable has no entry at the big
race in Louisville tomorrow, it is quite
possible that Fator will ride for some
o>her outfit. He has had the leg up on
three mounts in past Kentucky Der
bies, but, to use his own words, "has
pover been even close." Laverne rode
IV. R. Coe's Pompey in 1926, and the
Rancocas Stable's Mad Play and H. P.
Whitney's Wildair in former years.
Fator, liko Albert Johnson, who
piloted last year's Derby winner, and i
Earle Sande, came from the real j
Jockey country, the~Great Northwest,
and took part in rodeos as a cowboy
before he became a jockey. He has two

brothers who also ride, and he is about
thirty years old. Last year Laverne
ranked third in actual winnings. Of
the $195,915 which Fator's mounts ac
counted for during the 1926 season,
$65,980 was won by Scapa Flow in the
Belmont Futurity.
The 1927 season did not start auspi
ciously for this, the cleverest of all
jockeys. He went to Havre de Grace
especially to ride Crusader in the
Philadelphia handicap and, thanks to
all sorts of bad luck, went unplaced.
But he came back with a bang two
days later at Jamaica to bring Silver
Fox in a winner in the Paumonok han
dicap on April 25 by a brilliant display
of horsemanship. He seemed to fairly
lift his thundering charger over the
line to win by inches in one of the
most masterly exhibitnos he has ever
put up.

thirty years old. Last year Laverne
ranked third in actual winnings. Of
the $195,915 which Fator's mounts ac
counted for during the 1926 season,
$65,980 was won by Scapa Flow in the
Belmont Futurity.
The 1927 season did not start auspi
ciously for this, the cleverest of all
jockeys. He went to Havre de Grace
especially to ride Crusader in the
Philadelphia handicap and, thanks to
all sorts of bad luck, went unplaced.
But he came back with a bang two
days later at Jamaica to bring Silver
Fox in a winner in the Paumonok han
dicap on April 25 by a brilliant display
of horsemanship. He seemed to fairly
lift his thundering charger over the
line to win by inches in one of the
most masterly exhibitnos he has ever
put up.


What Fate for Fator?
Ask almost any read judge of horse
manship who is the greatest jockey
How in the business of booting home
thoroughbreds, and nine out of ten
%viU answer you, "Laverne Fator, of
the Rancocas Stable." Some will go
Csven farther and will say that Fator
Is one of the two greatest American
Jockeys of all time.
Be that as it may, Laverne Fator,
fcvho rides for Harry Sinclair, has never
tmd the thrill of bringing in a Ken
tucky Derby winner, and it may be
that his ambition will be realized dur
ing the present week. For if the Ran-
Cocas stable has no entry at the big
race in Louisville tomorrow, it is quite
possible that Fator will ride for some
o>her outfit. He has had the leg up on
three mounts in past Kentucky Der
bies, but, to use his own words, "has
pover been even close." Laverne rode
IV. R. Coe's Pompey in 1926, and the
Rancocas Stable's Mad Play and H. P.
Whitney's Wildair in former years.
Fator, liko Albert Johnson, who
piloted last year's Derby winner, and i
Earle Sande, came from the real j
Jockey country, the~Great Northwest,
and took part in rodeos as a cowboy
before he became a jockey. He has two

brothers who also ride, and he is about
thirty years old. Last year Laverne
ranked third in actual winnings. Of
the $195,915 which Fator's mounts ac
counted for during the 1926 season,
$65,980 was won by Scapa Flow in the
Belmont Futurity.
