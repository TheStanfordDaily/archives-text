# MUSSOLINI HAS PUT ITALY ON PATH OF PROGRESS—ELLIOT
## Registrar Emeritus Speaks Before Palo Alto Club On Italian Trip 
### 
"Mussolini has developed the fascist
syndicalist state, embracing both cap
ital and labor, all trades and employ
ments," Dr. Orrin L. Elliot, registrar
emeritus, declared at the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce luncheon Wed
nesday. "Capitalistic Industry has been
favored by tariffs and the furtherance
of foreign loans. Labor has been fa
vored by the steady job and by bring
ing about a partnership association
■with capital in industry."
Citing his own impressions of Italy's
great leader, Dr. Elliot described the
country as he saw it during his recent
trip, abroad. "What the tourist par
ticularly notes is that Italy is clean,
that its railway trains are on time,
that its officials are courteous and ef
ficient, that beggars have mostly dis
appeared, that industry is prosperous,
the people cheerful and busy, that
there are no strikes or lockouts, and
very little unemployment.
Finance Policy Praised
"Italy's problem of finance has been
wisely and conservatively handled,
and there are few critics of Musso
lini's policy in this respect. The re
forms in education have been sweep
ing and have involved a complete
change of methods, and the introduc
tion of rigid discipline. Many favors
have been shown the Vatican, and the
dictator has insisted on a respectful
and dignified consideration of all the
offices of religion.
"Plans for beautifying and improv
ing Rome are already under way, and
the pride of all Italy is aroused in an
effort to restore the glories of the
ancient Imperial City. No important
interest of the state has been over
looked. Hygiene and sanitation, em
ployment, housing of the people, agri
cultural experiment stations, better
roads and emigration, and many other
problems have received intelligent and
vigorous consideration. Not spectacu
lar legislation, for the most part, but
solid, constructive work puts Italy
well to the front among progressive
modern states."
Mussolini Sincere
Dr. Elliot feels that the chief criti
cism of Mussolini has come because
of his dictorial policy, and the sup
pression of criticism of the govern
ment. Yet he believes that the "Duce"
sincerely thinks facism is the one and
only agency through which the soul
of Italy can be expressed.
"Mussolini does not believe there
will be no more wars, and he wants
his country armed and disciplined for
whatever may happen. He knows, how
ever, that the greatest misfortune
which could happen to Italy at this
time is war."
