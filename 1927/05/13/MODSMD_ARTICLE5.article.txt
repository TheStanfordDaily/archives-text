### 
Playing their first game of the West
ern Conference polo tourney, the Stan
ford **juad meets the University of Wash
ington four this afternoon at Corvallis.
The Cardinal team composed of Cap
tain Fred E. Trotter, Chauncey O.
Thompson, Edward 11. Post, and Frank
W. Rothrock, is given the edge over the
Washington men. This is the first time
that the Huskies have been represented
by a polo squad in the tournament and
hence they are not expected to show much
strength.
Aggies Formidable
More competition will be offered by the
Aggie poloists, as they will be playing
on their home territory and will have
their own mounts. The Stanford men
are handicapped by having to use the
O.A.C. ponies, to which they are unac
customed. The Cardinals have a good
chance to win as they defeated the
Aggie squad in the matches here during
the Christmas vacation, the scores being
14 to 3 and 12 to 1.
The Stanford men won the Pacific Low
Goal and Novice championship held at
San Mateo last week, besides gaining vic
tories over the 76th Field Artillery in
early season meets. In the San Mateo
contests, the Cardinals showed a well
balanced and hard-riding team. The work
of Captain Trotter at goal guard was
outstanding in warding off the fast rushes
of Tevis and Eliradle of the San Mateo
sqfiad.
