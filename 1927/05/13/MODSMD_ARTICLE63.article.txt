# OLD BOY BREAKS INTO PRINT WITH FUND OF SUICIDE INFORMATION
## Goal of 1,000,000 Deaths by 1930 Is Mark Chappie Editor Shoots At 
### 
"One-hundred thousand by 1930e"
Today, Friday the thirteenth, the Old
]V>y releases his Suicide Number of
Chaparral for the purpose of propa
gating the number of student suicides
in the United States. So overwrought
lias the nation become over the increas
ing number of untimely deaths of the
last few weeks that Chappie feels that
lie must have a hand hi the festivities.
•For with the 700,000 college stu
«knts "who are at present bankrupting
their fathers, living three in a room, and
poking each other in the ribs every time
♦hey cut meat at the table," the Old Boy
feels he can, with a little propaganda,
work wonders toward the fulfilment of
fiis desires.
No Occasions Repeated
So, in his next to last number of the
quarter, he explains several methods of
discarding this present life, and they are
methods that are fit for any and every
occasion, formal or informal.
The illustrators are vivid and exciting,
and the cut, drawn by Hardie Gramatky,
shows at a glance one of the most popu
lar types of suicide of the age.
Contributions Prominent
Among the literary contributors to the
magazine are Helen Stanford, with a
couple of casual, sophisticated pieces,
Herbert Reynolds, with an engrossing
'"History of Suicide," and Ralph C. Mc-
Call, who tells of some unique and ter
ribly effective ways of surcease. And
R. Frank Baker, who got his newspaper
training on The Stanford Daily, takes
off a lurid tabloid, with tales of love,
arson, and hari-kari.
