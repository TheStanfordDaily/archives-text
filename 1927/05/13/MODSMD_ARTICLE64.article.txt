# Washington Scribes Put Out Seattle Star Edition
## 
### 
Journalists who put out the Univer
sity of Washington Daily recently took
a day off to edit the Seattle Star. With
the exception of syndicated features
used regularly by the city paper, all
material was secured and written by
the students. Four editions were put
out during the day. The college jour
nalists had charge of the office, and
each edition went to press on time.
