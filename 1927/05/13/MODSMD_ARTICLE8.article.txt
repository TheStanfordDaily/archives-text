### 
! Beginning in the Basketball Pavilion
at noon today and continuing through
1 the afternoon, the First National Pic
tures-College Humor screen-testing
unit, under the direction of Ned
! Holmes, will "shoot" the embryonic
! Stanford movie stars who appear for
, the film test. All aspirants for work
iin Hollywood are urged to report
! promptly, ia order that the selection
of candidates and the filming may be
| finished as soon as possible. All tests
! will be made privately.
Men who have had previous dra
j matic experience on the stage are par
! ticularly requested to report at the
i Pavilion, but this does not eliminate
I those who are new to the stage. Also,
j Holmes says, men ranging from 5 feet
! 10 inches to 6 feet 1 inch in height,
| who are slender and of athletic build,
! and who have dark hair and eyes,
j have the best chances to succeed in
i the final elimination.
Blondes Eligible
This does not mean, he added, that
i blondes with blue eyes are not con
j sidered. In the search for college men
| with attractive screen personalities
! no one who reports will be overlooked,
j If the same condition prevails at
j the University today that has at the
i other institutions visited by the
j camera men, a crowd of from one to
j three or four hundred will show up
at the Pavilion to try for chances for
, picture stardom. As only ten from
; number will be selected, the competi
! tion will necessarily be keen.
Elimination Necessary
With the testing units picking ten
candidates from each university vis
ited, John McCormick, manager of
First National Pictures' productions,
will have to decide which ten of the
j 320 possibilities brought to him will be
I best suited for studio work on the
I basis of the most attractive and in-
I teresting screen personalities. He will
have to formulate his judgments from
films that the testing units deliver
to him.
In June the final ten will be brought
to the studios at Burbank, California,
and there will engage in trial work
for eight weeks. They will appear in
pictures with popular screen stars, in
cluding Norma and Constance Tal
madge, Corinne Griffith, Milton Sills,
and Richard Barthelmess.
Of the ten, those who develop un-
J usual screen talent will be given five
| year contracts, starting at $75 a week
! for the first six months, and ending
I at $750 a week for the fifth year.

cluding Norma and Constance Tal
madge, Corinne Griffith, Milton Sills,

at noon today and continuing through
1 the afternoon, the First National Pic
tures-College Humor screen-testing
unit, under the direction of Ned
! Holmes, will "shoot" the embryonic
! Stanford movie stars who appear for
, the film test. All aspirants for work
iin Hollywood are urged to report
! promptly, ia order that the selection
of candidates and the filming may be
| finished as soon as possible. All tests
! will be made privately.
Men who have had previous dra
j matic experience on the stage are par
! ticularly requested to report at the
i Pavilion, but this does not eliminate
I those who are new to the stage. Also,
j Holmes says, men ranging from 5 feet

| who are slender and of athletic build,
! and who have dark hair and eyes,
j have the best chances to succeed in
i the final elimination.
Blondes Eligible
This does not mean, he added, that
i blondes with blue eyes are not con
j sidered. In the search for college men
| with attractive screen personalities
! no one who reports will be overlooked,
j If the same condition prevails at
j the University today that has at the
i other institutions visited by the
j camera men, a crowd of from one to
j three or four hundred will show up
at the Pavilion to try for chances for
, picture stardom. As only ten from
; number will be selected, the competi
! tion will necessarily be keen.
Elimination Necessary
With the testing units picking ten
candidates from each university vis
ited, John McCormick, manager of
First National Pictures' productions,
will have to decide which ten of the
j 320 possibilities brought to him will be
I best suited for studio work on the
I basis of the most attractive and in-
I teresting screen personalities. He will
have to formulate his judgments from
