JOHN BARRYMORE
The Screen's Greatest Star in
the great adaptation of Lord
Byron's Classic —
"DON JUAN"
With a cast of thousands includ
ing the most celebrated players.
MR. and MRS. PUBLIC: Any words
we might use here, descriptive of this
great photoplay, seem inadequate. You
know without our telling you, here is a
picture that has been lauded throughout
the nation, yes and the world. It has
played or is .still playing iti New York,
Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, Detroit, and
other large cities at an admission price
of $2.00. To those who like the thrilling
romances of Douglas Fairbanks as well
as of the late Rudolph Valentino, we
say, Barrymore has out-stunted, out
thrilled both, and is indeed, the greatest
lover of all the agrs.
