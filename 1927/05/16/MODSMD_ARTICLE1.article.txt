CORVALLIS, Ore., May 15. â€” The
smooth-working Stanford team re
tained the Pacific Coast intercollegiate
title here yesterday by defeating Ore
gon Agricultural College, 12 to 3, in
the final game of three-game series.
The University of Washington had
previously been eliminated by defeats
by both Stanford and O.A.C.
Stanford was matched with Wash
ington Friday, downing them 24 to 0.
Oregon had taken the Huskies into
an overwhelming victory the day be
fore. Edward "Bud" Post, Stanford
No. 2 man, led the attack on the
Huskies with 10 of the 24 points. The
Stanford team showed up especially
well, since they were handicapped by
being mounted on unfamiliar ponies.
Rothrock scored 3 goals, Post 10,
Thompson 5, Trotter 5, and Weymouth
1.
"Tex" Thompson starred for the
Cardinals yesterday in the final game,
scoring six of the twelve goals against
O.A.C. The entire contest was char
acterized by good horsemanship and
stick work throughout the play. The
Stanford quartet took the lead from
the start, and ran up a lead of three
points. In the second half, the O.A.C.
horsemen were held scoreless while
Stanford made six more goals.
Although Thompson was the big
scoring star, the Stanford victory was
as much the result of the cool han
dling of the team by Captain Trotter,
who also added two points to the total.
The Cardinals easily excelled in hit
ting ability, and showed better team
work. The Northerners had trouble in
finding the goal after working the ball
down by daring riding. The score:
Stanford O.A.C.
Rothrock (2) 1 Huffman
Post (2) 2 Ivenney (2)
Thompson (6) 3 Beckley (1)
Trotter (2) 4 Henderson
