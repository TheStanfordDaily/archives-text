### 
Through special agreement
with Stanford and California,
KPO, the broadcasting station of
Hale Brothers and the Chronicle,
will give the only broadcast of
football games in both the Stan
ford stadium and the California
Memorial stadium. The arrange
ment was made with Alfred Mas
ters and William Monohan, gradu
ate managers of Stanford and
California, respectively.
Under the terms of the con
tract, the decision as to which
game is to be broadcast each Sat
urday during the 1927-28 season
rests entirely with the graduate
managers of the two universities.
This schedule will include all
regular contests, as well as all
post-season games.
