Board of Trustees, preliminary work
has already started on the Adminis
tration Building addition to the En
cina Gym. Construction, which will
he done mostly during the summer
quarter, is promised to be completed
before October.
The new building marks the-first
step in the material formation of the
Department of Physical Education and
Hygiene, which has been under the
guidance and support of Dr. Thomas
A. Storey, director of the gym. Dr.
Storey has been planning the forma
tion of a department which would
vastly improve the present system of
physical education.
The Board of Athletic Control is
financing the entire structure, which
will cost approximately $100,000. This
sum will be obtained from the regular
Board of Athletic Control fund which
has been set aside for such a purpose.
The new project will provide more
room for the numerous offices which
are now taking space needed for
locker rooms for visiting teams and
physical education students.
