# TEN STANFORD MEN CHOSEN FOR FUTURE TRYOUTS ON SCREEN

"Fve got to hand it to Stanford;
this place has the best buncli of good
looking fellows Fve seenjit any of the
universities we've visited," said Ned
Holmes, director of the First National
Pictures - College Humor Western
screen-testing unit that came to the
campus yesterday afternoon. And
then he scanned the crowd of between
two and three hundred men, rustled
mostly from the luncliers at Encina
Commons, and after much deliberation
picked ten possible screen stars.
Four blondes and six brunettes were
chosen for final competition with 320
other men garnered from thirty-two
colleges of the country. Those who
were smeared with grease paint and
who grinned into the $3500' camera
are Henry Beaumont, Powell S. Car
penter, Harold Griffin, John L. Hare,
George S. Heller, Clifford P. Hoffman,
Henry E. Keyes, Leonard K. Schwartz,
Ted E. Shipkey, William J. Travers,
and Frederick A. Zitkowski. 4
Close-ups and long shots of the ten
embryonic stars were taken on the
lawn in front of the Basketball Pa
vilion. The negatives of all the 330
tests will be developed at the studios
in Burbank, and the ten winners of
this lot will be announced about the
end of this month. These will be
brought to the studios in June for
eight weeks' trial work, and if any
of thorn are exceptionally good they
will be given five-year contracts.
Holmes said that the total coat of
the tests would run near $50,000, but
that if only one famous star is devel
oped through them, that cost would be
cheap. "It is not so much looks as it
is personality that counts," lie re
marked. "And you can never tell how
a man will register on the screen by
looking at him. You have to see his
finished picture."
