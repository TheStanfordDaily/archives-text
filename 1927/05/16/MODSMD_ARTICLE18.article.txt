INTRAMURAL STANDINGS
Beta Theta Pi 125
Delta Chi 114
Breakers 110
Sequoia I 110
Sigma Chi 105
Alpha Tau Omega 98
El Tigre 91
With seven teams in a close race for
the annual intramural, the winner will
be decided in the intramural track and
relay event, starting Monday, May 23,
the latest standings by C. W. Davis,
director of intramural athletics, shows.
It is still possible for any of these
teams to top the column by finishing
strong in the remaining events.
The Betas hold an undisputed lead
with an eleven-point margin over the
nearest team and a good chance to add
another ten points by winning the
baseball series. El Tigre is still in the
baseball series with a strong team,
however, and if they secured the addi
tional points they would stand an even
chance to win the trophy.
Each team will get ten points for
entering for track and five points for
entering the relay. The winner in
track gets 30 points, and the others
20, 15, 10, and 5, respectively. The
winning relay team gets 15 points, and
the others 10, 5, 3, and 1.
Any of the low-score teams stands
a chance to win the annual trophy by
winning in these two events if the
leaders place high. The Breakers will
put in a strong bid for track and relay
honors as they were winners in each
of these events last year. But the
Betas could still finish ahead by taking
a few points in the track and relay
events if they won the baseball series,
so intramural fans are awaiting the
outcome of the final games.
