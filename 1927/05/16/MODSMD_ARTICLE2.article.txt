# HARVARD PROFESSOR LAYS FLOOD BLAME ON MAN, NOT NATURE
## 
### 
K. F. Mather, professor of Geology,
at Harvard University, considers man,
not nature, responsible for the pres
ent disastrous flood of the Mississippi
river. He speaks as follows:
"The blame for the great flood
should fall upon man and not upon
Nature. The Mississippi has never
risen to such great heights as it has
in this most recent flood, because all
the water of its tributaries has been
immediately concentrated into the one
great river, instead of being retarded
in the wide river beds and bottoms of
the smaller streams as it used to be
before so many levees were built to
hold the water in narrow channels."
