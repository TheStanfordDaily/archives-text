# That's Where the Money Goes

The prospects of Stanford having a new assembly hall, new law
buildings, or new dormitories became a little more dubious Friday when
the Board of Trustees approved of the plans to build a $100,000 physical
education building which will contain offices for the director, the general
manager, the medical department, and the coaching staff. All other
improvements must wait until the physical education department is well
housed and more money has accumulated.
The medical advisors and physical training instructors already have
offices that are about as comfortable as those the professors of the
University are offered. And surely the proposed offices are not the most
crying need of this institution. An assembly hall is the show-off place in
any university. It is the reception room where all notable visitors are
entertained. It is a gathering place for students, faculty, alumni, and
outsiders. Yet it is in the same condition today as it was years ago.
While $100,000 would not build a new assembly hall it would be a nice
sum from which to start a campaign for a new building for official
campus gatherings.
A few years ago the University saw fit to build a large and beautiful
stadium on the campus. At the time it was constructed it surpassed
anything on the Coast for size, and it still is in a class by itself for
natural beauty. The stadium is possibly used ten or twelve times during
the football season, and four or five times for track and field sports
during the springtime. With practically 110 exceptions, it is not used
during the rest of the twelve months. Now on the other hand, an assem
bly hall is used on an average of once a week during the college year.
The athletic facilities at Stanford cannot be equalled in the West", but
the same cannot be said regarding the physical facilities for academic
work at this University.
