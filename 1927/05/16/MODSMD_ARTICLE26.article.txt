# Free Publicity

### 
The Stanford Daily may be said to be viotlating the rule of "'free
publicity" by running a contest for the best essay on "Why people are
buying the small Marmon," and it was only after a meeting of the edi
torial board of the paper that the Marmon dealers were allowed to
publicly announce their essay contest in the news columns of the paper.
In discussing the matter the board felt that it was a mattor of duty
to the students to allow the contest. The three money prizes could well
be used by Stanford men and women, and the Daily would be depriving
them of the opportunity of securing this cash if it were to prohibit the
competition. Besides, an essay contest fits into the scheme of college
education. The Marmon people are teasing students with a bait that they
are most fond of. The automobile dealer is challenging the brains and
the pens of the Stanford student body.

In theory it would seem that every student in the University would
contribute a short essay in an effort to win the $25 or the $10 or possibly
the $5 prize. Every man and woman at Stanford should have enough
confidence in his or her writing ability to submit a paper. "Why people
are buying the little Marmon" is a good subject for the English compo
sition classes to write about this week. A good essay would win money
as well as an "A" mark.
