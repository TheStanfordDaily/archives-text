# Sing a Little Song
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Men's Glee Club will be held this afternoon, and
any male student who can sing, whistle, or hum is wanted and needed
at the meeting. The Glee Club offers the students an activity that is as
worhy of a position on the Stanford campus as any other extra
curricular endeavor.
At other universities the Glee Clubs are important. Positions in the
organization arc actively sought by men, their programs are well received,
and their members are respected on the campus. The University of
California has sent its singers to all parts of the world. This year the
Berkeley organization was sent East to compete in the national glee club
competition. The University of Southern California offered a concert at
Stanford last week as a part of its tour this year.
I here is no reason why Stanford students can not sing as well as they
can play football, or debate, or act on the stage. But if there is to be a
first-class singing club on the campus, there must be a large tryout list
from which to choose the first team. No football coach ever developed
a championship team from eleven tryoutees.
