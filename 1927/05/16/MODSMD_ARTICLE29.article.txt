SHINING THE FRUIT
Students everywhere adopt a sort of
jokiifg attitude toward the matter of
making social advances toward a pro
fessor with the ulterior motive in mind
of raising a poor grade. Few stop to
realize the far-reaching consequences
of this thoroughly despicable practice.
Locally, the phrase "apple polishing"
is used to describe this business, it is
considered in certain circles rather
the smart thing to substitute insincere
pleasantries for conscientious work.
Many students would rather wheedle a
mark out of a professor by gaining
his good-will than earn it by studious
endeavor.
The regrettable part of the matter
is (hat it results in msny professors
adopting a suspicious attitude toward
any student, however earnest, who
approaches them out of class hours.
Now nothing serves so well to blight
the ambition of a sincere student as
to have a favorite professor greet him
with that cold and fishy salutation

I ordinarily reserved for a gentleman
entering the second-story window after
dark.
Occasionally one finds a faculty
member sufficiently confident of his
own insusceptibility to bamboozling
that he entertains no fears regarding
the danger of free association with his
students. Or again one runs across a
professor who knows that lie will not
allow any amount of personal regard
for a student to affect that Student's
mark.
To get back, however, to that other
! class of professors—those who have
I
, followed a reaction to apple polishing
j to remove the lining from their silver
cloud (metaphorical). Let us hope
j that with the rise in scholastic stand
ing at Stanford and the necessary
concomitant increase in the propor
tionate number of sincere and earnest
students in the University that this
type of professor will disappear as the
j cause for his existence disappears.
