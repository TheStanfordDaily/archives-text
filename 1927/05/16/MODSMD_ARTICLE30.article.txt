"WHAT PRICE GLORY," Per.dragon
Players, Palo Alto.
The situation was well in hand, and
the Marines landed a knockout suc
cess in "What Price Glory," Pendragon
play presented Saturday night in the
Palo Alto high school auditorium.
Numbering in its cast five Stanford
students and" eight graduates, most of
whom managed to lose themselves ef
fectively in their characterizations, the
play was distinctly a Stanford success.
All the important parts with the ex
ception of Charmaine, played, and suc
cessfully, by Olive Presler, and the
comedy relief, Corporal Kiper, by J. P.
Neifling, were taken by Stanford men.
The authors reveal a remarkable
knowledge of mental action and reac
tion in the interplay of comedy, sus
pense, tragedy, and pathos found in
every situation. The most joyful mo
ment of all, when the much-needed
Alsatian lieutenant is captured, an
event which will give the entire com
pany a month's release from action, is
shattered by the pitiful death of Lewi
sohn.
Portrays Canton Life
The first act, in the headquarters
behind the front, gives a clever and
sympathetic insight into the canton
life of the Marines. Men hold forth
on those good old bull-session topics—
religion, women, drink, and "how I got
away with it" —and laugh after laugh
follow, with Corporals Lipinsky and
Kiper as the expert gagmen.
The übiquitous Daves scored an
other success as Captain Flagg, whose
many-facet character was clearly de
picted. Moments when his softer na
ture appeared moved smoothly into
his usual hard-boiled attitude with
never a hitch. His voice modulation, a
possibility in the small auditorium,
was made of particularly telling effect
in the second act when he was trying
to calm the hysterical Lieutenant
Moore, whose platoon were dying on
their feet. One of the most tensely
dramatic moments of the play, it was
heightened by the emotional power of
Stanley Mullin as the lieutenant.

James Quinby, '18, as Top Sergeant
Quirt, carried his part of the love'm
and leave'm soldier to a point of worth
to be gained only by one who was
"Over There."

That the soldier is married to his
trade and drops everything for the
call to action is only one of the subtle
warnings against training men in that
trade. Both Flagg and Quirt, hardened
troopers and rivals for the affections of
Charmaine, easily give up those effer
vescent affections to answer the call
of steel.
Howard Wickersham as Corporal
Lipinsky, Clarence Ricklefs as Private
Lewisohn, Richard Raoul-Duval as
Pete de la Cognac, Charles W. Davis
as General Cokeley, and Theodore
Matson as Lieutenant Cunningham
gave outstanding performances.

The first act, in the headquarters
behind the front, gives a clever and
sympathetic insight into the canton
life of the Marines. Men hold forth
on those good old bull-session topics—
religion, women, drink, and "how I got
away with it" —and laugh after laugh
follow, with Corporals Lipinsky and
Kiper as the expert gagmen.
The übiquitous Daves scored an
other success as Captain Flagg, whose
many-facet character was clearly de
picted. Moments when his softer na
ture appeared moved smoothly into
his usual hard-boiled attitude with
never a hitch. His voice modulation, a
possibility in the small auditorium,
was made of particularly telling effect
in the second act when he was trying
to calm the hysterical Lieutenant
Moore, whose platoon were dying on
their feet. One of the most tensely
dramatic moments of the play, it was
heightened by the emotional power of
Stanley Mullin as the lieutenant.

James Quinby, '18, as Top Sergeant
Quirt, carried his part of the love'm
and leave'm soldier to a point of worth
to be gained only by one who was
"Over There."

That the soldier is married to his
trade and drops everything for the
call to action is only one of the subtle
warnings against training men in that
trade. Both Flagg and Quirt, hardened
troopers and rivals for the affections of
Charmaine, easily give up those effer
vescent affections to answer the call
of steel.
Howard Wickersham as Corporal
Lipinsky, Clarence Ricklefs as Private
Lewisohn, Richard Raoul-Duval as
Pete de la Cognac, Charles W. Davis
as General Cokeley, and Theodore
Matson as Lieutenant Cunningham
gave outstanding performances.

"WHAT PRICE GLORY," Per.dragon
Players, Palo Alto.
The situation was well in hand, and
the Marines landed a knockout suc
cess in "What Price Glory," Pendragon
play presented Saturday night in the
Palo Alto high school auditorium.
Numbering in its cast five Stanford
students and" eight graduates, most of
whom managed to lose themselves ef
fectively in their characterizations, the
play was distinctly a Stanford success.
All the important parts with the ex
ception of Charmaine, played, and suc
cessfully, by Olive Presler, and the
comedy relief, Corporal Kiper, by J. P.
Neifling, were taken by Stanford men.
The authors reveal a remarkable
knowledge of mental action and reac
tion in the interplay of comedy, sus
pense, tragedy, and pathos found in
every situation. The most joyful mo
ment of all, when the much-needed
Alsatian lieutenant is captured, an
event which will give the entire com
pany a month's release from action, is
shattered by the pitiful death of Lewi
sohn.
