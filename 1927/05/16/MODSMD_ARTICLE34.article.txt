# U.S.C. ABOLISHES ALL RUSHING REGULATIONS FOR FRATERNITY MEN
## 
### 
Abolishing all rushing rules for the
coming year, the Interfraternity Coun
cil of the University of Southern Cali
fornia has decided to allow pledging
the first day of classes each semester.
After the trouble caused by the fra
ternity regulations during the past
year, the council believes that the
rules were stumbling blocks rather
than helps in simplifying rushing.
Only enough supervision will be kept
to see that the rushing does not inter
fere with university functions and
rules.
