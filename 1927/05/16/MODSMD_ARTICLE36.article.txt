# HEALTH AUTHORITIES CONCLUDE INSPECTION OF CAMPUS KITCHENS
## 
### 
Inspection for the month of April,
covering campus fraternities, clubs,
and other eating places, included 151
grounds and kitchens of which 135
were clean, 15 were fair, and 1 was
j dirty, it was announced by University
health authorities.
The general sanitary conditions of
the premises are looked into. On the
inside, the kitchen, the walls, the ceil
ing, ice box, pantry, and dining room
are inspected.
In addition to this, the milk served
at each of these places is tested.
When the result shown is unsatisfac-
I tory, both the dairy and the consumer
[are notified.
The regulations provide that the
| inspector notify those in charge of the
i establishment, and in case no action
| is taken after this first warning the
j matter is referred to the University
I for more drastic measures. The first
j warning has proved sufficient thus far.
Reports from month to month are
, published on the bulletin board at the
medical advisor's office in Encina gym
nasium. A steady improvement has
been shown sinee the inspections were
instigated last summer by Dr. Bar-
I rows.
