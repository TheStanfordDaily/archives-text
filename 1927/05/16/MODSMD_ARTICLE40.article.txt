# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Behold the Bill Roper of track and
field sports at Princeton! Keene Fitz
jmtrick, one of the grand old men of
the cinder-path, has been connected
with the spiked-shoe game so long
that he can tell you about the time
when all runners wore mustaches and
tasseled caps, and the crouch start
Was as unknown as Peaches Browning.
Since 1910 Keene has been track and
lield coach and athletic trainer at
fPrinceton, and during that time he
lias developed such splendid athletes
Â«s Billy Moore, J. Coard Taylor, Ralph
llills, Harrison Thompson, Caleb
Gates, and Bill Stevenson.
Fitzpatrick, like many other college
coaches, began as a professional run
ner and took part in many of those
famous fire musters that featured ath
letic events in the "mauve decade."
With "Mike" Murphy, "Pooch" Dono
van, Johnny Mack, Steve Farrell, now
coaching at Michigan, and others of
note, "Fitz" ran foot races or pulled
the fire hose cart for money prizes. In
3 890 Keene accepted a job as coach
at Yale, went to Michigan in 1893-94,
was at Yale again the next two years,
back at Michigan from 1897 till 1910,
and then moved to Princeton to be
come the best-loved fixture among Old
Nassau's walls of learning and ath
letics.
Princeton won the very first 1.C.4-A
meet back in 1876, and has never won
another. Fitzpatrick's dearest ambi

tion is to have his "boys" finish first
in this, the greatest of all Eastern
track and field championships. The
orange and black fiag of his adopted
university flew in second place in
1920, 1922, 1923, and 1925, but only
a victory will satisfy Keene. While he
coached at Yale in 1895 and 1596, the
Blue won the intercollegiate title.
Those two victories are the only ones
in this meet that Keene has enjoyed,
but his lads have won many a stirring
dual competition.
"Steve" Bradley is one of Fitz's
hopes in the coming meet. In the
rain and mud of the Penn Relay Car
nival last month. Bradley upset the
dope by tying for first in the pole vault
with Victor Pickard of Pittsburgh. He
cleared 12 feet BV2 inches to defeat
the famous Sabin Carr of Yale, with
whom he tied for first in the indoor
intercollegiates last March. "Steve"
is a hound for deadlocks, having also
shared first place honors in the 1926
relays with Harrington of Notre Dame.
