"Greeks rest on oars," said the regis
trar of the University of lowa. Statis
tics compiled by that official show that
the grades of the majority of fraternity
men slump after initiation. Out of the
252 new fraternity members initiated
at lowa last spring, 182 received lower
grades, while 70 initiates produced a
nominal increase over the two preced
ing quarters.
