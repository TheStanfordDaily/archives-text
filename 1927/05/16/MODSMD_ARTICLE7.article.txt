# WORK OF REVISING A.S.S.U. CONSTITUTION COMPLETED BY SPECIAL BOARD FRIDAY
## Official Sanction Will Be Given Document by Executive Body REFERENDUM IS MAY 24 No Action on Question of Awards Offered to Athletes 
### 
Final revision of the new A.S.S.U.
constitution was accomplished by the
committee appointed for that purpose
at its last meeting Friday.
Official sanction will be given to the
document by the Executive Committee
tomorrow, when that body will set
May 24 as the date for a special
student body election held for the pur
pose of accepting or rejecting the new
rules. This is the announcement of
Stanley Weigel, who is a member of
both the Constitution and Executive
committees.
Appointment of the student manager
by the general manager without the
necessity of resorting to the approval
of the Executive Committee, and a
provision governing nominations of
freshman class officers were two
changes made in the previous draft by
the committee. The President of the
University instead of the Dean of Men
was given the joint power of appoint
ment with the Council chairman for
the spring quarter of the summer
Council, as well as the right to ap
point the faculty representative on the
Dramatic Council on the recommenda
tion of the Executive Committee.
Elimination of the provision in the
Debate Council Charter requiring that
a member of Delta Sigma Rho be one
of the five candidates for the Debate
Council was also sanctioned. The wo
man's debate manager was given a
vote on the Council instead of being
an ex-officio member.
Soccer Clause Revised
The recommendation of Coach Ma
loney changing the playing time neces
sary for awards in soccer games with
California was acted on favcyably. The
new rule allows a man to complete
only one-half of the playing time of
one soccer game or part of two games
with California and yet gain his
jiward. This change was recommended
because of the peculiar rule in soccer
which provides that once a man is
taken from a game he cannot be put
back in. Thus, men injured during the
game will not now be precluded from
gaining their letters.
Any election to vote on the removal
of any officer of the A.S.S.U. was re
quired to be called by the Executive
Committee within two weeks after the
l eceipt of a petition for such an elec
tion signed by fifty members of the
association. No time limit had been
heretofore set.
Other Changes Minor
Except the provision that class of
ficers elected at the May election
should take office at the beginning of
the summer quarter, all other changes
were of a grammatical or technical
nature or involved sequence of sec
tions.
No action was taken by the commit
tee on recommendations concerning
awards, as it was felt that matters of
that nature should be voted on by the
student body separately. Chief among
these recommendations was one made
by Coach Charles Davis, Director of
Intramural Sports, that handball be

elevated to the position of a second
| class minor sport. The carry-over
1 value of the sport, and the fact that
U.C. at Los Angeles and other coast
colleges had it on their schedule were
his main arguments in favor of the
sport. The question of elevating golf
I to the position of a first-class minor
I sport was also shelved for the same
I reason.
