announced yesterday.

Friday, May 20, for art work, and
Saturday, May 21, for literary copy
have been set as deadlines for con
tributors. "We refuse to divulge the
title of the issue at present," Norman

sanity, however, and humor on any
subject from A to Z will be welcomed."

Since this is the last opportunity of
the year for campus laugh-provokers,
old and new contributors are urged
by the Old Boy to go insane on paper.
"Try to find the spindle in the office,
or mail your copy to Box 15," panted
