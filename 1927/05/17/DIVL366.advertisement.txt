"PICKING" the stitches
MOST shoe repairing is done without remov
ing the original stitches from the welt. New
stitches are sewed over the old ones—and the holes
are enlarged. This causes the edges of the welt
to give way—and all too soon your shoes look
ragged.
On the other hand, our skilled cobbler, Preston
Pulley, "picks" the original stitches .... holes
are not enlarged. Then, with leather chosen per
sonally from the tanneries, he fashions a repair
job that defies detection.
Haven't you shoes that need and deserve re-new
ing? Give them this expert service.
