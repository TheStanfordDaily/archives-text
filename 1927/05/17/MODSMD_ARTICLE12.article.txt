# REPAIRS CONSIDERED TO KEEP LAKE LEVEL HIGH UNTIL SUMMER
## 
### 
The rapid decrease in the level of
Lagunita, noticeable since Junior
Week-end, is due to the usual seepage
plus the cutting off of the regular
supply coming by flume from San
Francisquito creek.
"If the head of water now going to
waste were diverted into the lake
again," Dave Fall, custodian of the
boathouse, declared yesterday,"the
water level would rise regardless of
seepage, swimming would be im
proved, and the weeds would not flour
ish so well in the colder water."
Roy Button, superintendent of the
corporation yard, when told of the
leak, announced that an examination
of the flume would be made and if the
stream were considered likely to con
tinue for any length of time immediate
repairs would be made. Indications
are that drainage of the lake will not
be carried out as early as last year,
with the probability that there will be
a navigable amount of water until the
end of the quarter.
