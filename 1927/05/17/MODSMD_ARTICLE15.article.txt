# AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES GERMAN UNIVERSITY LIFE
## 
### Ey Ben Maddox, Jr 
Stealing away for a few minutes
from the reception committee which
was showing him the sights of the
campus yesterday afternoon, His Ex
cellency Ago Baron von Maltzan, Ger
man ambassador to the United States,
chatted informally for the benefit of
Daily readers on the advantages of
the student exchange movement be
tween American and German universi
ties, and the differences existing be
tween our colleges and those of his
native country. As one of the foremost
leaders in the student exchange
scheme, he enumerated with great en
thusiasm the national and internation
al results which he foresees.
Favors Interchange
"This sending of your students to
study in German schools, where they
will absorb our traditions and customs,
walk in our quaint old streets, and
learn to know our people by living
with German families, has a great cul
tural and political meaning. In the
same way German students are com
ing to this country to learn American
ideals of service, notice your speed of
life, and acquire your pep. Science is
international, and this interchange o?

i youthful thought is the best guarantee
| of future peace that we have.
"American students who go to Ger
-1 many will also have an opportunity to
I discover the charm of the slow buggy
ride," the ambassador added with a
! c huckle.
Schools Differ
German universities are run very
differently from ours, he said. "In
Europe there are fewer rich people
to give vast sums of money for educa
tion. German students learn together,
but they do not live together as yours
do. We have no dormitories like these
at Stanford; all our pupils reside with
private families or in boarding houses.
"One advantage you at Stanford
have is your splendid location away
from the city. Universities located in
big centers of population cannot give
their students the attention they
| should have, and the students are too
| distracted by the metropolitan pleas
! ures to do their work well."
| The ambassador is making an offi
i cial tour of the West, and is spending
three days in San Francisco and this
vicinity. The purpose of his trip is to
further commercial relations and build
better political and economical feel
ing between America and Germany.
He says that Germany's hope for the
future lies in the Dawes plan. If the
outside world will have faith and con
tinue the present policy of economic
helpfulness, he is certain his country
will discharge all her obligations.
Noteworthy Career
Baron von Maltzan has had a note
worthy diplomatic career. After serv
ing as Germany's Foreign Office chief
on the eastern front during the World
War, he represented his people for
three years at The Hague. He later
became Secretary of State under Von
Hindenburg, and in 1925 was appointed
to his present position in Washington.

The ambassador, accompanied by Dr. I
Kurt Ziegler, German consul in San
Francisco, was received by Professor
Robert E. Swain, acting president in
the absence of President Wilbur, and '
a committee of professors. After a
crowded hour spent in seeing the Me
morial Chapel, the Hoover War Li
brary, and other buildings of interest,
the noted visitor sped away down

Palm Drive for the city in his Pierce- j
Arrow limousine, escorted by two
traffic policemen, to attend an official
banquet tendered him last night in |
the Palace Hotel by the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce.
