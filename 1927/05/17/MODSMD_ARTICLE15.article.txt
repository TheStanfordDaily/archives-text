### Ey Ben Maddox, Jr 
Stealing away for a few minutes
from the reception committee which
was showing him the sights of the
campus yesterday afternoon, His Ex
cellency Ago Baron von Maltzan, Ger
man ambassador to the United States,
chatted informally for the benefit of
Daily readers on the advantages of
the student exchange movement be
tween American and German universi

Europe there are fewer rich people
to give vast sums of money for educa
tion. German students learn together,
but they do not live together as yours
do. We have no dormitories like these
at Stanford; all our pupils reside with
private families or in boarding houses.
"One advantage you at Stanford
have is your splendid location away
from the city. Universities located in
big centers of population cannot give
their students the attention they
| should have, and the students are too
| distracted by the metropolitan pleas
! ures to do their work well."
| The ambassador is making an offi
i cial tour of the West, and is spending
three days in San Francisco and this
vicinity. The purpose of his trip is to
further commercial relations and build
