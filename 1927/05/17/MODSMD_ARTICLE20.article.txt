### Joe Carroll 
This afternoon the Faculty Athletic
Committee will pass upon the names
of the men that Coach Dink Temple
ton has chosen to represent Stanford
University at the 1.C.-4A. meet to be
held in Philadelphia May 27 and 28.
The names of the men who will make
the trip will probably be released to
day or tomorrow.
Permission has been granted Coach
Templeton to take a squad of eighteen,
if he can find that many men who can
score a point or more back East. But
the committee has the final say as to
who will make the trip.
Bud Spencer, captain-elect, will prob
ably be the only runner to go. The long
train ride is harder on runners than
it is on field event men. Alex McKin
non is the only other Card runner
who has shown enough to warrant
being taken East. He would be in
better shape for the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate meet, however, if he did
not go to the 1.C.-4A.
The race between McKinnon, Cap
tain Gillette of Montana, Ches Unruh
of Southern California, and Les Schwo
beda of California on June 4 in Los
Angeles will be well worth the trip
South.
Coach Templeton will count upon
his field event men and weight
throwers to garner the 1.C.-4A.' meet.
With Bud Spencer, Bob King, and Biff
Hoffman almost certain to bring in
twenty points for the Cardinal, Stan
ford will have a margin of safety to
work on that will permit Coach Tem
pleton to use all of the men that ha
thinks will come through.
