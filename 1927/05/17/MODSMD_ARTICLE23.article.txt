# Completing the Cycle

### 
All fraternity rushing rules, except such as are necessary to prevent
conflict with university functions and regulations, were abolished at a
recent meeting of the inter fraternity council of the University of South
ern California. Such an announcement in a time of increasing rules on
fraternities conies in the nature of a surprise, but when the reasons given
for the step are considered, the action of the Trojan council may be more
easily understood.
' The council believes that the rules had proved to be "stumbling
blocks rather than helps in simplifying rushing." Furthermore, when
the nature of the Southern California campus is considered, with the
fraternity houses scattered about, it is evident that checking up on
violations of the rules would necessarily be a difficult task.
One possible disadvantage of the Trojan action comes with the
announcement that pledging will be permitted on the first day of classes.
This seems to be a reversion to the "knock down and drag out" system
which was formerly one of the great arguments against fraternities.
However, in the case of U.S.C., which lays down no rule requiring first
year men to live in a dormitory, the retrogression may be permissible.
Additional disadvantages of the newly adopted policy are bound to
rise and rules will necessarily be formulated to curb these tendencies.
If enough of such cases occur it is possible that the U.S.C. fraternity
council of 1932 will be faced with the same problem which the present
one solved by dropping all barriers. Should such a situation arise the
cycle will again have been completed and the ultimate solution to the
question of fraternity rushing rules will be as distant as ever.
