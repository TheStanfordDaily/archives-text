# Rugby—A Stanford Game
## 
### 
The announcement that the Olympic Games Committee has dropped
Rugby from the program of the 1928 Olympic Games is a blow to
Stanford and to California. In the past the American Rugby teams
have been chosen from men in this section of the country. A majority
of the players on the victorious team that represented the United States
at the last Games was composed of Stanford students and graduates.
Besides, the teams have been coached by a Stanford man—Harry
Maloney.
Maloney was personally delegated with the task of organizing and
training a Rugby team to represent this country in 1928. Eliminating
the sport from the program of the Olympic Games is disappointing to
Stanford, for to have a university team chosen to represent the country
against all the other nations of the world is a honor that can well be
sought by any institution.
General Charles Sherrell, American representative to the International
Olympic Games committee which is meeting in France has not given up
hopes for Rugby as yet. He is still trying to convince the nations that
Rugby football should be kept among the list of sports. No reasons were
given for dropping the game. America has been supreme in the field, and
this fact may have been the reason for discontinuing Rugby.
