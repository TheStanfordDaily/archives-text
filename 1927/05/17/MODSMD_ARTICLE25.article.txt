# "Men of Purpose"
## 
### 
Stanford won the Pacific Coast title in polo by defeating the Univer
sity of Washington 24 to 0 and Oregon Agricultural College 12 to 3.
Now the team is returning to the campus with a little favor to ask from
the student body. The polo artists are asking each Stanford man and
woman to spend a pleasant evening at a moving picture show.
"Men of Purpose" is being shown in the Assembly Hall both Friday
and Saturday nights of this week. The money taken in at the per
formances goes toward defraying the expenses of sending the polo team
to the North. Spending an evening watching actual pictures of the
World War is a very simple way to repay the athletes who competed at
Corvallis, Oregon. The polo players made good before they asked the
support of the students, and now it is up to the students to return the
favor.
There is still another possibility in connection with the moving picture
show and its benefits upon the polo squad. There is a possibility that
the team will be sent to the National tournament at Princeton if enough
money is secured from the gate receipts of "Men of Purpose." There
is the possibility that another national championship will be secured by
Stanford University this year.
