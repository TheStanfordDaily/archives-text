"THE ICEY FORAY"
There is no occasion to lose hope of
a national track championship because
a crippled team failed to win the P.A.
meet last Saturday, particularly when
in that meet the officials literally gave
away perfectly good points for a couple
of events that haven't been seen on a
collegiate field since John Brown
graduated from Harvard.
No indeed, all is not yet lost, as
they say. "Dink" Templeteon and his
representatives on the turf and cinder
have several tricks to perform before
they give away the bacon at the meet
ing of the Intercollegiate Amateur
American Athletic Association or the
Intercollegiate Association of Athletic
Amateur Americans. (You'll just have
to get used to it. We don't know any
more about what that means than you
do!)
However that may be, the point we
are making was, let us be hopeful, but
not too hopeful. Let us send the var
sity away with a rousing cheer, but let

us not greet it with a rousing jeer in
case someone else steals the laurels.
For there are any number of good
track teams entered in the 1.C.-4A.
Stanford's is among the best, if not
the best when competing under favor
able conditions. If there are any
breaks for the Cardinal back at the
nationals we need not worry over the
outcome. If there are not, we may be
sure that the men who are.represent
ing Stanford will give a stubborn ac
count of themselves before yielding
the victory in the biggest meet of a
highly successful season.

REAL HUMOR
Yesterday's paper contained an an- i
nouncement of tryouts for the Senior
farce. We cannot refrain from men
tioning that our own idea of the real
Senior farce is for the entire class to
pay two dollars a head for the privi
lege of signing the class roll, only to
march out quite solemnly and bury it
in the Inner Quadrangle.
