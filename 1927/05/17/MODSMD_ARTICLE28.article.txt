YOUNG ANARCHY. By Phillip Gibbs.
George Doran Co.
A story of the great masses (and
classes) of the Young Idea on strike
against tradition, all picketing their
own homes, and every one of them a
walking delegate of that vast invisible,
voluble, onrusliing union of Today or
ganized against Yesterday.
They would "kill the umpire"—with
laughter instead of pop bottles.
It is, too, an epic tragedy of the
younger generation, squirming in ten
der impotence or raging in far-fetched
brutal futility, striving to retain lead
ership while the younger set can not
be bothered by a sedate code of hypo
crisy, suspicion, and that dirt in \yhich
Old Lady Grundy scratches as she
clucks disapproval, of these things she
herself no longer enjoys.
There is a striking picture of a high !
churchman, a bishop whotries to em- |
ploy outworn nursery methods in a
righteous attempt to make his grown
children conform to his own mental
pattern. The Bishop in this book is
a tyrant in his home who exacts im- !
plicit obedience from his wife, his '
daughter, and his son; demands and
expects that they assume his own
stern mental and spiritual atitude to
ward a wayward world.
Pictured as almost lacking natural
parental love —at least most of the
time —the Bishop finally is bereft of
the association of his children; but
when his brutality is made to cast out j
his vivacious young daughter, whose
sin is that she is the author of a "best
seller," Sir Phillip Gibbs asks a bit
too much; the character is well nigh
unbelievable, as if neurotic or sugges- j

tice of the pathological.
Not the least important thing about
"Young Anarchy" is a sort of a con- !
viction likely to leap out of the pages
near the finish that Sir Phillip is
overly anxious to prove England never
was in danger of a revolution during
the great strike. Sir Phillip has a slap
on the wrist for labor leaders who
quote Karl Marx without having read
him.
And —oh, yes, Sir Phillip says "that
the small group of revolutionists, mes
merized by Moscow .... were like
school bullies who whined that they
didn't mean it when threatened with
a flogging."
In clean type—just like that!

the association of his children; but
when his brutality is made to cast out j
his vivacious young daughter, whose
sin is that she is the author of a "best
seller," Sir Phillip Gibbs asks a bit
too much; the character is well nigh
unbelievable, as if neurotic or sugges- j

tice of the pathological.
Not the least important thing about
"Young Anarchy" is a sort of a con- !
viction likely to leap out of the pages
near the finish that Sir Phillip is
overly anxious to prove England never
was in danger of a revolution during
the great strike. Sir Phillip has a slap
on the wrist for labor leaders who
quote Karl Marx without having read
him.
And —oh, yes, Sir Phillip says "that
the small group of revolutionists, mes
merized by Moscow .... were like
school bullies who whined that they
didn't mean it when threatened with
a flogging."
In clean type—just like that!

YOUNG ANARCHY. By Phillip Gibbs.
George Doran Co.
A story of the great masses (and
classes) of the Young Idea on strike
against tradition, all picketing their
own homes, and every one of them a
walking delegate of that vast invisible,
voluble, onrusliing union of Today or
ganized against Yesterday.
They would "kill the umpire"—with
laughter instead of pop bottles.
It is, too, an epic tragedy of the
younger generation, squirming in ten
der impotence or raging in far-fetched
brutal futility, striving to retain lead
ership while the younger set can not
be bothered by a sedate code of hypo
crisy, suspicion, and that dirt in \yhich
Old Lady Grundy scratches as she
clucks disapproval, of these things she
herself no longer enjoys.
There is a striking picture of a high !
churchman, a bishop whotries to em- |
ploy outworn nursery methods in a
righteous attempt to make his grown
children conform to his own mental
pattern. The Bishop in this book is
a tyrant in his home who exacts im- !
plicit obedience from his wife, his '
daughter, and his son; demands and
expects that they assume his own
stern mental and spiritual atitude to
ward a wayward world.
Pictured as almost lacking natural
parental love —at least most of the
time —the Bishop finally is bereft of
the association of his children; but
when his brutality is made to cast out j
his vivacious young daughter, whose
sin is that she is the author of a "best
seller," Sir Phillip Gibbs asks a bit
too much; the character is well nigh
unbelievable, as if neurotic or sugges- j

tice of the pathological.
