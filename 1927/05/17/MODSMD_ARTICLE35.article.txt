# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Strange bedfellows, baseball and
tennis. About all they have in common
is that both sports are played with a
bat and a ball on a smooth, level field,
while the differences in the two games
make them seem as far apart as the
two poles. Yet various major league
ball stars have tried their hands at the
net game and liked it, and the great
est baseball player of all time has
more than a passing interest in tennis
because his son is a promising young
player.
You who peruse the sports pages
diligently each morning may have
been struck, as I was, by the coinci
dence in the two dispatches about the
Cobbs, Senior and Junior, in the pa
pers of Wednesday, March 30. Ty, the
benevolent father, it seemed, had spo
ken harsh words to Umpire Frank
Wilson in an exhibition game between
the Boston Braves and the Philadel
phia Athletics some days before, caus
ing the hard-boiled arbiter to forfeit
the game to Boston, and on March 29
Judge Landis announced that Cobb
must pay a fine of $100. At Augusta,
the same day, Ty Junior was playing
in a tennis tournament, and, though
beaten in the singles, put up a gallant
fight. On March 30, the young Tyrus
and his partner, Bill Deas, were elimi
nated from the doubles by Bill Tilden
and Sandy Wiener, while George Lott

of Chicago, himself a fine baseball
player, was winning his quarter-final
match in the singles.
Imagine the row that would have
been caused if Ty Cobb, Jr., had hurled
abusive language at the umpire in the
tennis match! Jones Mersereau, the
Judge Landis of the United States
Lawn Tennis Association, would not
have slapped a $100 fine on the red
headed youngster, for that would
smack of professionalism, but he
would certainly have barred the "sec
ond McLoughlin" from playing in fu
ture tournaments over which the as
sociation has control. Sam Hardy
tells me that young Ty wants to kill
every ball, and if he carries baseball
ethics into tennis, he'll surely attempt
mayhem on some of the near-sighted
linesmen.
And say!â€”just imagine Ty Cobb,
Senior, adopting in baseball the tennis
custom of throwing a point to your
opponent when you are sure the um
pire has erred in your favor! Don't
make me laugh!
