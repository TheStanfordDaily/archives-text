"Begging rides is a dangerous prac
| tice; it sets a bad example and it
saves no time," the California State
! Automobile Association says in an
open letter to college students.
"We are all imitators to a greater
or less extent. Caul ion is a fashion
; that is coming into style. Boys who
| beg rides are doing nothing to develop
i tiie 'safety manner,' and college men
; have a positive duty to perform by
I setting a good example," the associa
tion heads declare.
