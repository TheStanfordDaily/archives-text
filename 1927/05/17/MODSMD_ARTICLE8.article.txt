## 
### 
With the pitching of Doug Lewis,
1 Beta Theta Pi took another step to
| ward the intramural baseball title in
j the semi-final game of the series yes
i terday afternoon when they scored a
I shutout victory of 6-0 over the Fijis.
| Gregory, hurling for the Fijis, had
; difficulty in keeping the Beta hitters
from running riot, his infield support
I saving his team from greater disaster.
; Errors in the infield and outfield were
; frequent and proved costly. Several
Beta pop-flies were missed by Fiji
fielders and three-baggers made out of
; them when the most should have been
: but a first base. The infielders also
: muffed easy hot-box plays and allowed
| Beta runners to slide % on bases to
' deadly effect. Broenkow, supporting
j Gregory in the battery, did his part
| to keep the Beta score lower by cover
ing home plate carefully.
Excellent Pitching
Doug Lewis pitched a wonderful
1 game for the Betas. The Fijis received
fourteen strikeouts at his hands and
| were forced to be content with but
; three hits. Watt completed the bat
| tery, exercising a fast peg to second
| base whenever necessary. The Beta
1 infield was fast, Montgomery cover
i ing third especially well, putting sev
eral Fiji runners out with the aid of
Lewis and Watt. In the sixth inning,
when a Fiji score seemed near, Greg
ory was caught napping at third by
this trio. Watt feigned a throw to
! second by throwing a fast one to Lewis
who promptly saw the ball on its way
j to third, where Gregory was just start
ing for home. This is a favorite Beta
1 P!ay.
The Betas scored three runs in the
I first inning, one in the third, a home
! run in the fourth, and a run each in
! the fifth and sixth, not taking their
i last inning at the bat after they had
j retired the Fijis for their last inning.

; three hits. Watt completed the bat
| tery, exercising a fast peg to second
| base whenever necessary. The Beta
1 infield was fast, Montgomery cover
i ing third especially well, putting sev
eral Fiji runners out with the aid of
Lewis and Watt. In the sixth inning,
when a Fiji score seemed near, Greg
ory was caught napping at third by
this trio. Watt feigned a throw to
! second by throwing a fast one to Lewis
who promptly saw the ball on its way
j to third, where Gregory was just start
ing for home. This is a favorite Beta
1 P!ay.
The Betas scored three runs in the
I first inning, one in the third, a home
! run in the fourth, and a run each in
! the fifth and sixth, not taking their
i last inning at the bat after they had
j retired the Fijis for their last inning.
Final Game Friday
l Yesterday's game having eliminated
the Fijis, the intramural baseball
honors now remain to be fought for by
i the Betas and El Tigre. In this game
i to take place next Friday afternoon,
| the battle will be put up mainly by
the Beta battery and the El Tigre out
: field which has been largely responsi
j ble for the eating club's victories.
With the pitching of Doug Lewis,
1 Beta Theta Pi took another step to
| ward the intramural baseball title in
j the semi-final game of the series yes
i terday afternoon when they scored a
I shutout victory of 6-0 over the Fijis.
| Gregory, hurling for the Fijis, had
; difficulty in keeping the Beta hitters
from running riot, his infield support
I saving his team from greater disaster.
; Errors in the infield and outfield were
; frequent and proved costly. Several
Beta pop-flies were missed by Fiji
fielders and three-baggers made out of
; them when the most should have been
: but a first base. The infielders also
: muffed easy hot-box plays and allowed
| Beta runners to slide % on bases to
' deadly effect. Broenkow, supporting
j Gregory in the battery, did his part
| to keep the Beta score lower by cover
ing home plate carefully.
Excellent Pitching
