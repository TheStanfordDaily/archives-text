# El Tigre Opposes Strong Beta Nine For Championship
## 
### 
Alter nearly two months' prelimin
ary games, El Tigre and Beta Tlieta
PI will close the intramural baseball
season this afternoon with a game to
decide the championship of the Uni
versity. The contest will be held on
the varsity diamond, and will start at
4 o'clock.
El Tigre entered the finals by virtue
of victories over Sequoia and El
Campo. The Betas won through to the
last game by defeating Sigma Nu and
Phi Gamma Delta. The fraternity men
have a more imposing record, smash
ing through Harry Todd of the Sigma
Nu's for eight runs, including four
circuit hits. They drove Gregory of
the Fijis to despair, winning 6 to 0.
On the other hand, El Tigre had a
hard time to down Sequoia, and did
not have much of a margin in winning
the El Campo game.
The game today is expected to be a
duel between Lewis, Beta hurler, and
the efforts of Robinson, Stockbridge,
Thompson, and the other heavy-hitting
Tigre batsmen. If Lewis can handle
the ball as well as he has been doing,
these self-same batsmen will have a
good-sized job to garner hits. When
the Betas come to bat, they will face
Robinson, who has turned in several
good games, with a practically air-tight
outfield.
