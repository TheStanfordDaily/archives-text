# SKEEN MATCHED WITH BRADLEY IN FINALS OF HORSESHOE MEET
## 
### 
Bradley, playing for Encina IV, and
Skeen, playing for the Union, will
meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon to
decide the horseshoe championship of
the University. The game was sched
uled for yesterday but it was too late
to play after the finals in each group
had been played.
The match will probably be very
close as each man defeated his op
ponent yesterday with little difficulty.
Both are experienced in the art of
barnyard golf, as Bradley is tenth
ranking player of California, while
Skeen placed second at the Utah tour
ney.
In the first game, Bradley scored a
win over Johnson of the Fiji team by
winning two straight games 50-30 and
50-15. Bradley tossed eighteen ringers
the first game and nineteen the sec
ond.
Skeen showed his superiority over
Mack of Sequoia by taking the first
two games of the match 50>-38 and
50-36. He threw eighteen ringers the
first game and seventeen the second
game.
