# SPECIAL VOTE ON NEW CONSTITUTION PLANNED MAY 24
## MILITARY DATE ALLOWED New Rules for Off-Campus Dances Are Passed by Ex Committee 
### 
Setting of May 24 as the date of
the special election to pass on the
revised constitution, which was given
official sanction, approval of the dates
for the Polo Association moving pic
ture, passing of new rules governing
off-campus dances and amendment of
the election by-laws, was the principal
work of the Executive Committee at a
stormy meeting last night.
Picture Permitted
Permission was granted the Polo
Association to exhibit "Men of Pur

performances. The action of the Asso

was definitely understood that the ac

should set no precedent, as such per
formances encroached on the pre
serves of the Dramatic Council.
Under the new rules governing off
campus dances, no organization may
have more than one such dance in
two years. At every off-campus dance,
there must be two official representa
tives, chosen by Men's and Women's
Councils, respectively, who shall, with
the president of the organization giv
ing the dance, be responsible for
proper conduct. Application to hold
such a dance must be made to the
Executive Committee, with the ap
proval of the appropriate dean, by the
president of the organization request
ing permission. No class is allowed to
give a dance off the campus. These
