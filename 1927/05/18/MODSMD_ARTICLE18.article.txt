# SPECIAL VOTE ON NEW CONSTITUTION PLANNED MAY 24
## MILITARY DATE ALLOWED New Rules for Off-Campus Dances Are Passed by Ex Committee 
### 
Setting of May 24 as the date of
the special election to pass on the
revised constitution, which was given
official sanction, approval of the dates
for the Polo Association moving pic
ture, passing of new rules governing
off-campus dances and amendment of
the election by-laws, was the principal
work of the Executive Committee at a
stormy meeting last night.
Picture Permitted
Permission was granted the Polo
Association to exhibit "Men of Pur
pose" in the Assembly Hall next Fri
day and Saturday nights, despite the
opposition of Robert E. Cecil and the
Dramatic Council. Although the senti
ment of the Executive Committee was
definitely against granting such per
mission, it was felt that it was ex
pedient to do so in view of the fact
that tickets had been sold and adver
tising expenses incurred for the two
performances. The action of the Asso
ciation in going ahead before secur
ing the approval of the Executive Com
mittee was severely censured, and it
was definitely understood that the ac
tion of the body in granting the dates
should set no precedent, as such per
formances encroached on the pre
serves of the Dramatic Council.
Under the new rules governing off
campus dances, no organization may
have more than one such dance in
two years. At every off-campus dance,
there must be two official representa
tives, chosen by Men's and Women's
Councils, respectively, who shall, with
the president of the organization giv
ing the dance, be responsible for
proper conduct. Application to hold
such a dance must be made to the
Executive Committee, with the ap
proval of the appropriate dean, by the
president of the organization request
ing permission. No class is allowed to
give a dance off the campus. These
provisions were recommended by Dr.
Wilbur, Dean Culver, and Dean Yost,
as the only effective means of regu
lating conduct at off-campus dances,
By-Laws Amended
The election By-Laws were amended
to provide for nominations for spring
elections to be opened on Wednesday,
May 25, instead of on Monday, to
allow the new constitution to go into
effect.
Recognition was given to the report
of the Y.M.C.A., submitted by the Stu
dent Manager, showing a deficit of
$1735.02. Notification was authorized
to be sent to the officers of the or
ganization to appear before the Com
mittee at its next meeting.

pedient to do so in view of the fact
that tickets had been sold and adver
tising expenses incurred for the two
performances. The action of the Asso
ciation in going ahead before secur
ing the approval of the Executive Com
mittee was severely censured, and it
was definitely understood that the ac
tion of the body in granting the dates
should set no precedent, as such per
formances encroached on the pre
serves of the Dramatic Council.
Under the new rules governing off
campus dances, no organization may
have more than one such dance in
two years. At every off-campus dance,
there must be two official representa
tives, chosen by Men's and Women's
Councils, respectively, who shall, with
the president of the organization giv
ing the dance, be responsible for
proper conduct. Application to hold
such a dance must be made to the
Executive Committee, with the ap
proval of the appropriate dean, by the
president of the organization request
ing permission. No class is allowed to
give a dance off the campus. These
provisions were recommended by Dr.
Wilbur, Dean Culver, and Dean Yost,
as the only effective means of regu
lating conduct at off-campus dances,
By-Laws Amended
The election By-Laws were amended
to provide for nominations for spring
elections to be opened on Wednesday,
May 25, instead of on Monday, to
allow the new constitution to go into
effect.
Recognition was given to the report
of the Y.M.C.A., submitted by the Stu
dent Manager, showing a deficit of
$1735.02. Notification was authorized
to be sent to the officers of the or
ganization to appear before the Com
mittee at its next meeting.
Setting of May 24 as the date of
the special election to pass on the
revised constitution, which was given
official sanction, approval of the dates
for the Polo Association moving pic
ture, passing of new rules governing
off-campus dances and amendment of
the election by-laws, was the principal
work of the Executive Committee at a
stormy meeting last night.
Picture Permitted
Permission was granted the Polo
Association to exhibit "Men of Pur
pose" in the Assembly Hall next Fri
day and Saturday nights, despite the
opposition of Robert E. Cecil and the
Dramatic Council. Although the senti
ment of the Executive Committee was
definitely against granting such per
mission, it was felt that it was ex
pedient to do so in view of the fact
that tickets had been sold and adver
tising expenses incurred for the two
performances. The action of the Asso
ciation in going ahead before secur
ing the approval of the Executive Com
mittee was severely censured, and it

tion of the body in granting the dates
