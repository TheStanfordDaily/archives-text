# QUAD TRYOUTEES FOR NEXT YEAR TO MEET TOMORROW IN UNION
## 
### 
"It is imperative that all men and
women who will not be of more than
sophomore standing next fall quarter,
and who wish to try out for either
managerial or editorial positions on
next year's Quad should be present at
a meeting tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock in the Trophy Room of the Old
Union," said Mac√üoyle Lewis, man
ager of the publication, yesterday.
There are six salaried positions
open. The tryoutees work during their
sophomore year and are graded as to
ability by the point system. Office
hours spent are given so many points,
and credit is given according to the
amount of advertising and books sold.
In both the editorial and managerial
departments the tryoutees will be able
to gain business experience. Although
the actual work on next year's book
will not start until fall quarter, work
will be given out now for which points
may be gained to go on next year's
credit rating.
