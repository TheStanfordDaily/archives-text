A guest of the University of Kansas recently, in recounting his
college experiences, was responsible for the following illuminating state
ment :
"While at school I was so busy I had no time to read books."
Too busy to read! Impossible, at least at college. The Kansan visitor
evidently did not care to read, and preferred to spend his spare moments
at other diversions. The best results from reading are to be obtained
when it is done in the light of amusement, and not that of studying in
search of facts. The facts and the information will be secured without
the reader realizing it if he will sit down and read when he feels tired and
when he feels the need of pleasure. There is no one who does not have
some time every day for his own recreation.
The student who, after a hard day of studying, comes back to his
room with the one wish that he could just leave his work and go and
travel, turns to a book of travels and for an hour he enjoys the mysteries
and beauties of foreign lands as he would il he were there bodily as well
as mentally, lie may desire romance, and not have the facilities. The
second best, and sometimes even the best, is a book of romance. He
may want to be cheered up; he may want to laugh. There are plenty of
volumes chucked full with laughs and fun.
Stanford University permits each student to receive credit for four
units of pleasure reading during his undergraduate years. The present
system of reading suggested by the English department is splendid. The
student is allowed to wander about in the world of books with absolutely
110 aim in mind except pure enjoyment. He is allowed to stop here and
there and get a better picture of the works of some author or of some
subject. But he is not compelled to do so. lie can try to make a record
trip over the entire field, with just a hasty glance at each phase of
writing. lie can spend his whole time in one location getting intimately
acquainted with one particular phase of reading, if he so wishes.
If compulsion did not ruin the flavor of all types of work, it would
be suggested that a student should be forced to do from five to ten hours
of free reading a week during each of his four years at Stanford. An
extra unit of credit a quarter could be given, for a prize must be offered
if the plan is to succeed among college folks.
