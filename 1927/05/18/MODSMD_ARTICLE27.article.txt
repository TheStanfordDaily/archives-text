# Carrying Our Name to the Front

### 
As Stanford's varsity tennis teams leaves for the Northlands, the
Cardinal polo players are returning from Oregon. As the two teams pass
each other on the road the tennis men will shout a word of congratulation,
while the polo stars are offering a word of confidence to their sport
brothers. But to the mass of Stanford students who neither have repre
sented the University, nor will represent the institution, there are two
duties to be performed. The students should cheer the; tenuis squad off,
and at the same time welcome the polo team hack.
Teams are traveling about the country and bringing credit to Stan
ford, and we at the University are enjoying the proud name that our
representatives arc making for us. We have seen our football, basketball,
baseball, track, tennis, polo, golf, and swimming teams leave the campus
and come back with glories. We have seen our debaters and musicians
win victories in their fields. Olticcrs from various organizations of the
student body have been sent to conventions and meetings, and they have
all taken active parts in the conclaves and again brought credit to
Stanford.
Stanford is rated highly about the country, largely because of the
achievements of the students who are sent out to represent the institution
on> the various fields of work and play. It is true that these delegates
secure honor for themselves, but they are not selfish with favors, for they
are spread out to cover the whole of the University. Their victories are
our wins for they carry the name of Stanford with them wherever they
may go.
