AN OPEN LETTER TO THE WOMEN
OF STANFORD U N I VERS (TY AND
TO WHOM IN ADDITION IT MAY
CONCERN:
My Dear Young Ladies, et al:
For a number of years now we have
been lending a patient ear to more or
less heated disc ussions concerning the
many rules governing your conduct
and particularly those rules that dic
tate the exact time at which you must
come home.
Recently, we are informed, certain
representative women gathered to
gether to discuss the matter of en
forcement of these lockout rules. The
result of their conference appeared in
an announcement made last Monday
to the effect that enforcement of the
rules for the remainder of this quarter
will be more strict than heretofore and
that there will be a curtailment of
late leave.
This announcement was followed
naturally enough by a certain amount
of conversation. It has been our for
tune to hear a part of the discussion
of this step. Despite efforts to the
contrary we have been unable to lo
cate a woman who does not think that
the rules, already quite irritable, bid
fair to become intolerable. Further
more, we hear on every hand the bald
implication that the women are not
allowed much freedom of choice in
making these rules, but that they are
dictated indirectly from the office of
the Dean of Women. In view of the

| fact that the administration presum
ably favors self-government, either
this implication is ill-founded or the
| administration is hypocritical.
What we should like to know is do
the women of Stanford University ac
tually make all these rules without
any pressure being brought to bear?
Having made them, why do they not
enforce them by the honor system by
the use of which tlie men insure them
selves the utmost latitude in matters
of personal conduct? Furthermore, do
they make them just to be doing some
thing, or on the supposition that con
stant surveillance in college strength
ens the character of women and pre
pares them to handle their own affairs
, after they get out?
In short, we would like to hear the
whole story behind the fact that on
this campus, where men students are
allowed complete freedom in matters
I of personal conduct (except on those
| infrequent occasions when one of them
receives unpleasant publicity) the wo
: men, who our experience has taught
| us, are predisposed to behave them
! selves better than the men, are re
stricted to a degree that is both an
insult and a nuisance. We sincerely
| hope to bring out a perfect avalanche
! of correspondence on this matter and
| remove for once and for all the ob
i scurity in which this whole business
has always been shrouded by virtue
of a sort of unwritten taboo on the
! subject.
Sincerely, Stephen O'Donnell.

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE WOMEN
OF STANFORD U N I VERS (TY AND
TO WHOM IN ADDITION IT MAY
CONCERN:
My Dear Young Ladies, et al:
For a number of years now we have
been lending a patient ear to more or
less heated disc ussions concerning the
many rules governing your conduct
and particularly those rules that dic
tate the exact time at which you must
come home.
Recently, we are informed, certain
representative women gathered to
gether to discuss the matter of en
forcement of these lockout rules. The
result of their conference appeared in
an announcement made last Monday
to the effect that enforcement of the
rules for the remainder of this quarter
will be more strict than heretofore and
that there will be a curtailment of
late leave.
This announcement was followed
naturally enough by a certain amount
of conversation. It has been our for
tune to hear a part of the discussion
of this step. Despite efforts to the
contrary we have been unable to lo
cate a woman who does not think that
the rules, already quite irritable, bid
fair to become intolerable. Further
more, we hear on every hand the bald
implication that the women are not
allowed much freedom of choice in
making these rules, but that they are
dictated indirectly from the office of
the Dean of Women. In view of the

| fact that the administration presum
ably favors self-government, either
this implication is ill-founded or the
| administration is hypocritical.
What we should like to know is do
the women of Stanford University ac
tually make all these rules without
any pressure being brought to bear?
Having made them, why do they not
enforce them by the honor system by
the use of which tlie men insure them
selves the utmost latitude in matters
of personal conduct? Furthermore, do
they make them just to be doing some
thing, or on the supposition that con
stant surveillance in college strength
ens the character of women and pre
pares them to handle their own affairs
, after they get out?
In short, we would like to hear the
whole story behind the fact that on
this campus, where men students are
allowed complete freedom in matters
I of personal conduct (except on those
| infrequent occasions when one of them
receives unpleasant publicity) the wo
: men, who our experience has taught
| us, are predisposed to behave them
! selves better than the men, are re
stricted to a degree that is both an
insult and a nuisance. We sincerely
| hope to bring out a perfect avalanche
! of correspondence on this matter and
| remove for once and for all the ob
i scurity in which this whole business
has always been shrouded by virtue
of a sort of unwritten taboo on the
! subject.
Sincerely, Stephen O'Donnell.
