"THE SHANGHAI GESTURE" at the
Curran Theatre, San Francisco.
If you are shocked when you stroll
through a poultry yard of a May eve
ning. after feeding time, or when you
devote the afternoon of a wet Monday
in March to a burlesque show, you'll
be shocked by the new monkeyshines
in the Adelphi. Otherwise, it is, if you
take your sense of unwitting fun with
you to the tlieatre, the most interest
ing show of the season.
Mr. r'olfoii, who takes credit for
writing it, means that it shall be dirty,
and that any policeman who tries to
interfere shall be greeted with a kiss
at the portals of the theatre and asked
where he'll have a couple of quarts
delivered. Well, let's get. right down to
it.and say that it is dirty, and let it
go at that. You may, whether or not
you think it comical, hear the inci
dence of sex discussed as within no
other play Within my easy memory.
Mother Goddam is the Mother War
ren of China, and is, as she tells it, a
go-getter, who finds the best outlet
for her varied virtuosity in running a
Place in Shanghai. The d6cor of the
establishment seems to have been
modelled on extravaganza. She's got
something on everybody else in the
world." 'Twas she, it seems, who had
Mr. Samuel Hill put off Queen Marie's
train, arranged for the acquittal of
Governor Small at Waukegan, and in
fluenced the pint-once-in-ten-days deci
sion. Her hatchet men have instruc
tions to kill all guests wearing the
double-breasted dinner coat. She is so
busy that she hasn't time for a mani
cure, so that her gold-plated finger
nails are nine inches long and worth

; their weight in uncut Scotch.
The old girl makes clear in the sec
ond act the conditions precedent
1 through the medium of one of those
long, long speech stunts that were
in vogue when Grover Cleaveland was
in his second term. She has in for
dinner all the distinguished Latins
and Nordics in Shanghai, entertains
them by selling a naked white girl at
j auction to a mob of Chinese sailors,
and, when Sir Guy (who is really an
i ornery cuss) (l ies to interfere, she
I puts on the disc beginning, in effect,
"Twenty years ago." Before she has
spoken more, than the first nine thou
sand words, he knows her for who
she is—Madge! Madge! herself: little
Madge Foo-Foo, who took the Famous
Players-Lasky prize for the prettiest
I Manchu princess in Fond-du-Lac twen
ty years before. She's had a tough
life, she explains, since Guy, damn
I him! led her on with fair promises,
j and then sold her down the river to
the junk-men. And so, and so, and so,
until she runs upstairs and, finishing
| her speech on the landing, walks from
i sight through a solid wall.
Then the play goes on with a per
| feet plot which to teli would spoil
your appreciation of a good theme.
Miss Florence Reed, with a part re
quiring effectiveness, is effective in
the plain terms of the piece—which, 1
| may say, bears the same relation to
drama that a crossing cop bears to
1 moving traffic. Many strange noises
! are emitted by her in the course of
the show, meaning of many things.
The other players are the other play
ers, and are, most of them, a support-
J ing cast —and that's all. —E.L.S
