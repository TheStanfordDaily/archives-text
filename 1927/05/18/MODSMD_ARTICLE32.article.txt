# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
So we are to have a new $100,000
physical education building at Stan
ford! That's fine. And the benefits will
be —more room for the directors' of- i
fices which are now taking space
needed for locker rooms for visiting
teams and physical education students. '
But what about those plans for two I
more men's dormitories to form a
quadrangle with Toyon and Branner?
Are they never to be fulfilled?
There is a large number of Stan
ford students who are compelled to
live off the campus because they can
not get into any of the halls. They j
must sock ont rooms somewhere —in
Palo Alto or neighboring towns. They
walk up and down from the campus or
miss classes waiting for that baffling !

hell-on-wheels known as the
ville Trolley." Living off by them
selves they lead more or less secluded
lives: they are missing out on campus
life. Their classes are their only con
tacts. The magic phrase "Going away
to college" should mean something
more than merely gaining scholarly
knowledge; it should mean an oppor- 1
tunity to gain culture, to make social
contacts, to make friends. What
chances for doing this do lectures
offer to the man living off the campus?
None.
My application for a room in one
of the halls has been in for over a
year now, and 1 am beginning to de
spair of ever living on the campus
again. If, while a freshman, I had
realized that Encina might be the only

• liall I would ever room in, I would |
j have given less time to studying and
more time to the enjoyment of living
with other follows. Freshmen, enjoy
yourselves while you can, for you may
not get another chance as good, unless
you are of the minority that are asked ;
to join fraternities. I am under the !
impression that the heads of this Uni- !
versitv are against the frats, but I !
can't see that they offer much as an i
alternative.
And how about that soul-inspiring j
quality known as "College Spirit"?
Does Stanford have it? Stanford men,
scattered throughout the surrounding |
country, do not have much of a chance I
to feel that "get-together" spirit. How i
will these off-campus residents look
back on their college days? What will i
their memories have to hold dear, to !
i recall with softened joy and fondness? I
Lectures.
It seems to me that our overwhelm- 1
ing need here at Stanford is more !
halls for the men to live in, and I j
should think the University would ful- |
fill this need at the first opportunity.
A new physical education building
will be useful, but more halls for the
men would be more useful. It seems !
to me that the University is slighting j
its own sons, buying us boxing gloves
when they should be giving us more
needful objects according to those
well-known lines:

yourselves while you can, for you may

It seems to me that our overwhelm- 1

halls for the men to live in, and I j
should think the University would ful- |
fill this need at the first opportunity.
A new physical education building
will be useful, but more halls for the

The Editor, Sir:
So we are to have a new $100,000
physical education building at Stan
ford! That's fine. And the benefits will
be —more room for the directors' of- i
fices which are now taking space
needed for locker rooms for visiting
teams and physical education students. '
But what about those plans for two I
more men's dormitories to form a
quadrangle with Toyon and Branner?
Are they never to be fulfilled?
There is a large number of Stan
ford students who are compelled to
live off the campus because they can
not get into any of the halls. They j
must sock ont rooms somewhere —in
Palo Alto or neighboring towns. They
walk up and down from the campus or
miss classes waiting for that baffling !

hell-on-wheels known as the
ville Trolley." Living off by them
selves they lead more or less secluded
lives: they are missing out on campus
life. Their classes are their only con
tacts. The magic phrase "Going away
to college" should mean something
more than merely gaining scholarly
knowledge; it should mean an oppor- 1
tunity to gain culture, to make social
contacts, to make friends. What
chances for doing this do lectures
offer to the man living off the campus?
None.
