We strongly disapprove of Sequoia
Club and its chorus girls. It certainly
is unkind to subject our poor hard
working "500" to the competition of
professionals.

It certainly makes one feel aristo
cratically exclusive. Here there were
only 200 smoke-ups sent out altogether
and we got one of them!

Eighteen good, strong men from
Sequoia!
Went down to San Hosie
Hurrahia!
And brought eighteen beauties I
To Breakfast!
At Sequoia!
Oh Boyia E.W.C.

Supply and Demand
More hay than ever before will be
harvested on the campus this year.
Also there will be more graduates.

This Doesn't Mean Anything
"Huh! That girl still believes in
Santa Claus."
"Knowing her as I do, I should say
that was a very nice way to put it."

We don't go much on religion,
The preacher we leave in the lurch;
But when visitors come the first thing
we do,
Is take 'em and show 'em the church.
