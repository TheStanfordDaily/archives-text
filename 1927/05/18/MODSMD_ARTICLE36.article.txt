# NO BOSTON TEA-PARTY
## 
### Feg Murray 
When in the course of human events
it becomes necessary for two Grade B
heavyweights to fight for the right to
7neet the champion of the world, who
himself is no James J. Jeffries, it
necessarily reflects no little bit upon
the quality of the present day gladi
ators. Too bad that there is no real
â€¢way of comparing the Sullivan, the
Corbett, the Jeffries, and Johnson with
the fighters of today, and have these
endless arguments settled. I, for one,

( while admitting that Gene Tunney is
I greatly underrated by the average
j fight fan, would be forced to cast my
! vote for the champions of the past.
But to get down to the business at
j hand, which is the forthcoming meet
ing between Jimmy Maloney, the Irish
man, and Jack Sharkey, the Lithu
i anian, both of Boston, for the possible
right to meet J. J. Tunney for the
j championship of the world next Sep-
I tember. Get out the scales and we'll

see upon which side are the argu
ments.
On Sharkey's side, place the fact
that he ig faster on his feet, and add
to that that he is a quicker thinker.
Place the weighty statements that Mr.
Cuccosky is more aggressive when
the o<y:asion demands, that he has a
better left hand, and is a more skillful
counterer. On Maloney's side, place
the arguments that Jim is about ten
or twelve pounds heavier, that he is
a harder hitter with his right, and has

I more knockouts to his credit than has
liis rival.
In Sharkey's favor, add his victories
over Harry Wills and Mike McTigue;
and on Maloney's side, the victories
over Jack Delaney and Harry Persson.
And when you add to Sharkey's scale
his two victories over Maloney, to one
victory over Jack for Jim's side, it
appears that the balance shows a dis
tinct list in favor of the Lithuanian.
But, unfortunately, fights very sel-
I dom go the way they are doped.
