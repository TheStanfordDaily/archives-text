# AMERICA WANTS RUGBY RESUMED IN OLYMPIC CONTFSTSâ€”MALONEY
## 
### 
Although latest advice states that
rugby football has been dropped from
the program of the 1928 Olympic
Games, America is making effort to
have the change cancelled, Harry Ma
loney, rugby coach, stated last night.
No reasons for the change were
given in the letter that Maloney re
ceived from the Olympic Games com
mittee. Possible causes, he said, may
be based around the friction between
several European countries. England,
Ireland, Scotland, Roumania, and
France, participate in rugby. Soccer
is the most popular European game
on that style, and rugby is diminishing
in favor.
General Charles Shorrell. American
representative to the International
Olympic Games committee, which is
now meeting in Nice, France, is trying
to induce the committee to restore
rugby to the schedule. Stanford had
been virtually given authority to sup
ply the rugby team for the 1928 games.
If the ruling is not changed, Stan
ford will probably abandon all rugby
work, Maloney said, although the
Board of Athletic Control would have
final judgment on the matter, and
games scheduled with Vancouver and
British Columbia teams for next win
ter would be cancelled.
