# MICHAUD SHOWS AUDIENCE UNCONVENTIONAL BEAUTY

### 
"I am going to shock you," an
nounced Professor Regis Michaud in
beginning his lecture last night on
"The New Art in France." "I am going
to show you things which you will call
ugly, because they do not follow the
conventional ideas of beauty," the
Frenchman continued as an introduc
tion to his slides, taken from repre
sentative painters of the modern
French school. Michaud, associate pro
fessor of French at the University of
California, is a recognized authority
on modern art forms, especially as
presented in the French school.
"Musicians do not limit their ex
pression; they do with notes what
they will, interpreting their vision.
Why should not painters do the same
thing?" questioned Professor Michaud.
"It is the dream that counts, not the
exact proportion and distribution of
natural objects."
Cesanne Cited
In his slides, Professor Michaud
showed the works of such modernists
as Cesanne, one of the leaders of the
impressionistic school, beginning with
some of the earlier departures from
the classical technique, and continuing
through to the unreal interpretations
achieved through deliberate and diffi
cult distortion of all normal perspec

tive and objects. One of the modern
expressions he cited was a statue of
Don Quixote in Paris done entirely
of stove-pipes.
"All art is progressing toward the
unreal," asserted the lecturer. "Syn
thetic and interpretative representa
tion of all material, to fit the artist's
vision, is the goal. These men and
women are adventurers, as Columbus
was, trying to discover the new at
whatever cost.
Artists Pioneers
"In painting, this has led to a dis
regard of perspective and proportion.
Distortion is striven for, and only the
bare essentials are included in the
delineations. Modern paintings are
symphonies born from a dream," con
tinued Michaud. "Some of them are
difficult for us: we do not understand
them, but our children will."
In this work of pioneering, of dis
covering an idealistic and interpreta
tive idiom for artistic expression in
painting, Michaud displayed and ex
planed in particular the works of such
modernists as C6sanne, Rousseau,
Derain, Matisse, and Picazzo.
"To interpret, to be divorced entire
ly from what we know as real: this
is the aim and goal of modern art,"
concluded the lecturer.
