# WORLD WAR PICTURE SHOWS SCENES FROM ACTUAL ENCOUNTERS
## 
### 
Actual battle scenes, attacking,
i blocking, and hand-to-hand fighting,
j constitute the greater part of the
i authentic world war film, "Men of Pur
pose," which will be presented by the
Stanford Polo Association Friday and
Saturday nights, May 20 and 21, to
defray the expense of sending the polo
team to Oregon for the Western Col
legiate Championships, and to gain, if
possible, sufficient funds to enter the
j squad in the National Championships.
All of the film records, with the ex
, ception of that part showing the as
| sassination of Archduke Ferdinand at
Sarajevo, are official, having been
' taken by the photographic sections
i attached to the Signal Corps of the
! Allied and Central powers. The pic
i tures cover the entire course of the
I war, with especial attention to battles
; and actions in which the United States
[ troops participated. One section shows
| the drive on St. Mihiel, where a mil
j lion Americans fought.

Two showings of the films are to be
given each night, at 7:30 and 9:30
o'clock. Tickets, which may now be
obtained from student canvassers, are
fifty cents each.
