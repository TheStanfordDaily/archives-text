# FAST EVENTS APPEAR CERTAIN IN TODAY'S SWIMMING TOURNEY
## Four Stars to Fight for Victory in Century; Furlong Close 
### 
Three races loom as outstanding fea
tures in the All-University swimming
championships today. The meet, which
begins at 4:15 o'clock in the Encina
pool, is open to all men registered in
the University, with the exception of
graduates and holdovers.
In the 100 yard dash. Bob Williams,
Kryne Van den Akker, A1 Christen
son, and Bill Danford will fight out
a grudge of long standing. The race
will be more interesting in that Reg
Harrison will not be eligible after
winning the previous race, the 50,
which in all probability he will do.
If Carl Stevenson enters the 440-
yard free style, he will be a heavy
favorite to win. The following race,
the 220, will thus be a struggle be
tween Hadley Bramel and Ogden
Driggs. Both men are in mid-season
form, and should race to a sensational
finish.
The 220-yard breast stroke looks to
be a race between Cecil West and
Clarence Ophuls, both of the varsity,
and Nort Thornton of the freshmen.
All have been making the same
times during practice. Ted Smith will
enter as a newtomer into the back
stroke ranks, and a dark-horse entry
in the 150-yard swim. Warner Hobdy,
who has beaten every backstroke time
of the Pacific Coast, will not enter,
and Phil Brooks will have to uphold
the honor of the veterans.
Smith is also likely to enter the
diving, where he is on more familiar
ground. In this event he will face
Walt Mills, of the varsity, and Ed
Throndson, of the freshmen.
The last race of the day will be an
exhibition relay between two picked
four-man teams. The eight men that
will compete are undoubtedly the fast
est free style swimmers in the Uni
versity. On the Whites will be Chris
tenson, Stevenson, Van den Akker,
and Williams. The Reds will be
Driggs, Bramel, Brooks, and Harrison.
