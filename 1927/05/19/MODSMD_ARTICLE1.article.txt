# FOURTEEN MEN TRAINING FOR I.C.4A. MEET
## West, Nichols Expected to Take High Places in Hurdle Events QUARTER MAY BE CLOSE Spencer, King, Hoffman Are Scheduled to Take Twenty Points at Nationals 
### 
Fourteen men are busily engaged in
the final bit of training that will put
them in first-class shape for their trip
to the 1.C.-4A. meet next week. Mean
while Coach Templeton is making up
his mind as to just who he will take
East.
Stanford has an excellent chance for
a victory at Philadelphia. The three
"B's," Bud Spencer, Bob King, and
Biff Hoffman should contribute twenty
points to the Stanford total all by
themselves.
Spencer May Set Record
With over a week's time in which
to recover from the long ride across
the continent, Spencer will be in a
position to give all the quarter-milers
present a stiff race. Considering the
opposition that he will face, Bud may
break the world's record.
Alex McKinnon will also have the
advantage of a week's work under
Eastern climatic conditions. It is ex
pected that lie will be able to round
into shape before time for the meet
It is hoped that the additional time
will give him opportunity to render
a full and complete account of himself
to the distance runners who will be
entered.
Clarence West was high-point man
for Stanford last year, placing second
in the high hurdles and fourth in the
lows. Leighton Dye won the highs in
14.7 seconds, and Kenneth Grumbles
the lows in 23 4-10.
Nichols, West Hurdle Hopes
Since both of these men graduated.
West and Ross Nichols stand good
chances for high places in the two
hurdle events. Nichols has turned in
some outstanding records in the
highs, with West making his best time
in the lows.
King, Hoffman, West, and Tom
Work are the only members of this
year's team who Avon points last year.
Ted Shipkey made the trip East, but
did not qualify in the javelin throw.
He has been consistent at 190 feet this
year, which should place him well up
in this event.
