# CHARTER SYSTEM BEGUN WITH NEW CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
117ITH two outstanding characteristics, the introduction of the charter
" system in student self-government, and the allowance of more freedom
in individual student activities, together with closer co-operation with the
student government, the revised constitution of the A.S.S.U. will be submitted
for approval to the Quad on Tuesday, May 24.
"The constitution represents a new deviation in student government,"
Stanley Weigel stated last night, "based on the general plan of operating
student activities under charters. These charters will include debating
publications, and the work of the rally committee."
The advantage in the charter system lies in the fact that the charters,
being subject to changing conditions, may be easily altered without changing

the entire constitution. This policy is
in line with the general plan of the
committee, which intended to include
in the constitution only matters which
are permanent and fixed.
The committee, which worked on
the revision for six months, has con
sulted with every person interested in
the work. When the committee had
finished its preliminary draft, it sent
copies to student leaders, to Dr. Wil
bur, to all interested members of tho
faculty, to athletic coaches, and to
practically every one of any authority
on the campus. All these people were
requested to submit any criticisms
and suggestions they desired. Most of
these suggestions have been incor
porated in the present draft.
