# M'DOWELL ENDORSES ENDOWMENT PLAN AS FOSTERED BY SENIORS
## 
### 
Enthusiastic approval of the 1927
Class Fund was expressed yesterday
by J. E. McDowell, alumni secretary.
He says, that coming at this time
when the establishment of the Alumni
"University Fund has just been an
nounced Â«and before it is barely
launched among the alumni, this early
and enthusiastic support of the fund
assures the success of the plan &nd
will undoubtedly prove a strong stimu
lus to alumni contributions.
McDowell feels that this scheme
adopted by the Class of 1927 is far
superior to the old insurance plan
which has been in effect for several
years, and he anticipates that because
of greater simplicity of organization,
a more hearty response will be made
to the appeal.
Yesterday was the first day of the
drive, which closes Sunday. Seniors
may sign pledges for contributions,
payable annually over an indefinite
period of years, with the privilege of
changing or even revoking the pledge
should it become necessary.
