# BETA THETA PI WINS BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP
## Score Tied at Last Inning Of Game; Both Nines In Final Spurt TEAMS ALMOST EQUAL Fraternity Downs El Tigre 6 to 2 in Last Game Of Mural Nines 
### Doug Fuller 
Putting over a five-run rally in the
final inning to break a 1 to 1 deadlock,
the Beta Theta Pi baseball crew yes
terday won the University intramural
baseball championship from the El
Tigre nine, 6-2. Though El Tigre
staged a desperate rally in their half
of the inning, the five-tally lead proved
too great.
Teams Almost Even
Strong pitching and clean fielding
was in evidence throughout the con
test, with the teams as a whole prac
tically even. Charley Hunter of El
Tigre had the hurling edge, if there
was any, in the first part of the con
test, with Doug Lewis. Beta pitcher,
leading toward the end by virtue of
strikeouts at decisive moments to hold
down the heavy-hitting eating club
men.
More precision and faster work in
the infield was chiefly responsible for
the Beta win. El Tigre had the dan
gerous habit of allowing a runner or
two on base before getting down to
business. Pretty fielding plays were
frequent on both sides, with Gainey
Prisinzano shining at third for EI
Tigre, and the whole fraternity infield
playing practically errorless ball.
After pulling out of some tight holes
in the early stanza, Brown made first
on a low throw with two down, stole
second, and scored on Hunter's single
through short. Stockbridge added an
other single, but the rally died there.
A one-run lead looked big with the
type of ball exhibited.
Tibbe scored for the Betas in the
fifth on a single following a few hectic
infield plays and close decisions, tieing
the count and making extra innings
look probable. Don Brown was holding
the Row men on first with accurate
throws to second base. Two Betas
were left waiting on base in the sixth,
when Hunter retired the side with a
strikeout, grounder, and fly to short.
Gomer Thomas knocked out a clean
single with the count three and two

to open the decisive seventh. Watt
went out, and Kissinger hit a hard
single to score Thomas. Montgomery
then knocked a Texas leaguer just be
yond the shortstop's fingertips, Kis
singer scoring. Doug Lewis came
through to score Montgomery, and El
Tigre errors allowed Lewis and An
drews to complete the tallying.
In a last attempt to win the game,
Stockbridge and McKeclinie got on
base in the final half of the inning,
and Thompson singled to score Stock
bridge and raise the El Tigre total
to two. Lewis then worked hard and

managed to retire the next two on a
strikeout and an easy grounder to end
the game.
Totals for the contest showed that
the winners made nine hits and two
errors as against five hits and six
errors for El Tigre. The strong batting
line-ups of the two teams cut down
the rival pitchers' usual strikeout
totals, Lewis striking out six, and
Hunter, three.
The victory gives the Betas a sub
stantial lead toward the year's intra
mural trophy, as they were already
ahead.
