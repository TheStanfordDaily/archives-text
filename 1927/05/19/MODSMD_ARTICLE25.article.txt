# The 						Winds of Freedom Blow
## 
### 
Once again it appears that Women's Council lias undertaken to shelter
the women of Stanford University, to protect their health, their morals,
and incidentally to foster resentment and thorough and justified indig
nation.
The most recent infringement, beginning this week, upon women—
that of more stringent regulation of late leaves during the rest of the
quarter —merely serves as a match for the already smoldering resentment
against regulations for lockouts, late leaves, and hours which must be
observed by the women.
However, Council should not be condemned too severely, for that
body is responsible for the enforcement of the regulations as they now
exist, and the recent tightening up in enforcing these rules merely brings
up for consideration the entire late leave and hour regulation problem.
r l he root of the difficulty may be found in the rules themselves, and the
problem is one which should be taken up by the women as a whole.
Suggestions and action for changing the entire system of late leaves and
lock-outs should originate among the women themselves and should be
presented before Women's Conference, which is the legislative body of
student self-government as delegated to the Associated Women Students.
Stanford University is not a boarding school; it is an institution for
the training of young men and women who, were they not in college,
would be thrown upon their own resources in the world without an over
solicitous group of leaders to dictate the time they should come behind
locked doors to spend a night free from temptations.
It is a university's business to train, not to shield; to aid students to
develop, not to hold them in check. They are mature enough to take care
of themselves. Psychologically, over-restraint during university days is
not unlikely to lead to uncurbed action and the use of an unschooled
judgment when undergraduate life is completed.
Another obvious absurdity in the curtailment of women's freedom
is the fact that, academically, students alone are responsible, for pro
fessors can scarcely find time to prod each student to tell him that if
his assignment is not in by noon tomorrow his character will suffer.
Hardly! An assignment is given, and the student fulfills it or takes the
consequences—in grades. J lie consequences of staying out until mid
night should be taken in the same way. ()ne is never too young to develop
responsibility and good judgment, and certainly college women should be
allowed the freedom of judging the night hour for their arrival at living
groups.
The argument that the reputation of the University would suffer
were women allowed to remain out later than at present, is a foolish one.
for if it is a reputation which the women themselves are not ashamed of,
there is little justification for making hypocrites of them by enforcing
the present regulations. Moreover, Stanford will always have plenty of
women seeking admittance—women who are capable of looking out for
their own welfare, too.
This is no longer an age of prudery and false respectability; it is an
age of responsible freedom. It is surprising that Stanford women are
so slow in demanding this freedom.

develop, not to hold them in check. They are mature enough to take care
of themselves. Psychologically, over-restraint during university days is
not unlikely to lead to uncurbed action and the use of an unschooled
judgment when undergraduate life is completed.
Another obvious absurdity in the curtailment of women's freedom
is the fact that, academically, students alone are responsible, for pro
fessors can scarcely find time to prod each student to tell him that if
his assignment is not in by noon tomorrow his character will suffer.
Hardly! An assignment is given, and the student fulfills it or takes the
consequences—in grades. J lie consequences of staying out until mid
night should be taken in the same way. ()ne is never too young to develop
responsibility and good judgment, and certainly college women should be
allowed the freedom of judging the night hour for their arrival at living
groups.
The argument that the reputation of the University would suffer
were women allowed to remain out later than at present, is a foolish one.
for if it is a reputation which the women themselves are not ashamed of,
there is little justification for making hypocrites of them by enforcing
the present regulations. Moreover, Stanford will always have plenty of
women seeking admittance—women who are capable of looking out for
their own welfare, too.
This is no longer an age of prudery and false respectability; it is an
age of responsible freedom. It is surprising that Stanford women are
so slow in demanding this freedom.
Once again it appears that Women's Council lias undertaken to shelter
the women of Stanford University, to protect their health, their morals,
and incidentally to foster resentment and thorough and justified indig
nation.
The most recent infringement, beginning this week, upon women—
that of more stringent regulation of late leaves during the rest of the
quarter —merely serves as a match for the already smoldering resentment
against regulations for lockouts, late leaves, and hours which must be
observed by the women.
However, Council should not be condemned too severely, for that
body is responsible for the enforcement of the regulations as they now
exist, and the recent tightening up in enforcing these rules merely brings
up for consideration the entire late leave and hour regulation problem.
r l he root of the difficulty may be found in the rules themselves, and the
problem is one which should be taken up by the women as a whole.
Suggestions and action for changing the entire system of late leaves and
lock-outs should originate among the women themselves and should be
presented before Women's Conference, which is the legislative body of
student self-government as delegated to the Associated Women Students.
Stanford University is not a boarding school; it is an institution for
the training of young men and women who, were they not in college,
would be thrown upon their own resources in the world without an over
solicitous group of leaders to dictate the time they should come behind
locked doors to spend a night free from temptations.
It is a university's business to train, not to shield; to aid students to
develop, not to hold them in check. They are mature enough to take care
of themselves. Psychologically, over-restraint during university days is
not unlikely to lead to uncurbed action and the use of an unschooled
judgment when undergraduate life is completed.
