When the Phy. Ed. department gets
into that office, they'll have to equip
xv-ith some new red tape to make Ret
ting a cut excuse a little more diffi
cult, and to justify the move.

CUSTOM
While moonlight shines
On shadowed lake,
Concentric lines
Move out and break
Beneath the willows —
'Round the floats.
Are wavering forms
Of drifting boats.
Who ride in this
Uncharted way.
TTnguided on
The surface sway?
"They like a course
That's undefined —
The occupants aren't
The paddling kind!"
—L.B.V.C.

VACATION
Four weeks more—
Then home.
What to do? I don't know —
Perhaps I'll sell tin
Aluminium
P'raps magazines to
Village queens—
Probably I'll live
Off my old man.

SEQUEL
Page a nurse
For Tommy Clister —
On Labor Day he
Raised a blister.
* * *
The bootlegger sold him some juniper
juice
To mix up a stiff little toddy;
lie poured in the gin and he tossed
down a sluice—
Oh, what'll we do with the body?
—L.B.
