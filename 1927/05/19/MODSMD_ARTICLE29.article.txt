MOTHER MILITANT
A glance at the Campus Opinion
Column will serve to convince the
reader that response is not wanting to
yesterday's plea for a public discus- |
sion of a topic that has already been
thoroughly discussed in private. For
tunately the controversy lias started
under way just as the Women's Con
ference is holding a series of discus
sions to straighten out a few existing
misunderstandings in the present sys- j
tem, To date the conference, we have
been informed, has taken no action
to make the rules more stringent than ;
they have been.
Of today's contributors "Stanford \
Mother" offers the most vulnerable !
object for criticism, because she dis-!
agrees. The whole tone of her letter
leads us to believe that she wrote it
on the assumption that lockout rules j
accomplish the objects which they are
intended to accomplish and further
more that those objects are desirable.
"Stanford Mother" speaks of the
necessity of shielding* the women. She
does not mention from what they are
to be shielded. We assume therefore
that they are to be shielded from any
opportunity to meet circumstances
exactly analogous to those they will
encounter when they leave Stanford. j
She assumes furthermore that the
rules accomplish this object, that they
do exercise a restraining influence. It
is our contention that they do nothing
of the sort. Under the rules as they
now stand a woman may stay out un
til 1:30, or she may even stay out all
night if she but request permission.
Just what end is served by insistence

I upon this request is beyond us. Speci
fically, if a woman asks permission to
' stay off the campus all night she may
i do so. If she does not and stays off
I anyhow, she is subject to expulsion.
Just how this annoying regulation re
acts to the benefit of the woman es
capes us.
"Stanford Mother" quotes to some
effect or other concerning the possi
bility of "individual liberty becoming
licence." We hold that, as a matter
j of fact, the women of this University
| are and for years have been depend
i ent upon their own strength of char
acter to curtail their own liberty; so
| that it would not approach anything
! resembling license. We feel further
more that the existing rules, or any
! imaginable set of rules would not be
! able to place in the hands of any
governing body the real responsibility
i for a woman's conduct. Furthermore,
it has been our observation that Stan
ford women, being of a high type in
tellectually and morally, may be
trusted to handle their own affairs in
ladylike manners.
In closing, we are still convinced
that the lockout rules as they stand
are involved and burdensome, that
they fail of accomplishing their object
which is of itself of doubtful value,
|
! that they entail an amount of trouble
that is out of all proportion to the
good they would do if they worked
perfectly. Partially due to the letter
from"A Senior" and partially because
of a number of conversations on the
subject, we rather feel that a number
of women agree with us on this mat
ter. We would still like to hear from
them. —Stephen O'Donnell.

they have been.
Of today's contributors "Stanford \
Mother" offers the most vulnerable !
object for criticism, because she dis-!
agrees. The whole tone of her letter
leads us to believe that she wrote it
on the assumption that lockout rules j
accomplish the objects which they are
intended to accomplish and further
more that those objects are desirable.
"Stanford Mother" speaks of the
necessity of shielding* the women. She
does not mention from what they are
to be shielded. We assume therefore
that they are to be shielded from any
opportunity to meet circumstances
exactly analogous to those they will
encounter when they leave Stanford. j
She assumes furthermore that the
rules accomplish this object, that they
do exercise a restraining influence. It
is our contention that they do nothing
of the sort. Under the rules as they
now stand a woman may stay out un
til 1:30, or she may even stay out all
night if she but request permission.
Just what end is served by insistence

I upon this request is beyond us. Speci
fically, if a woman asks permission to
' stay off the campus all night she may
i do so. If she does not and stays off
I anyhow, she is subject to expulsion.
Just how this annoying regulation re
acts to the benefit of the woman es
capes us.
"Stanford Mother" quotes to some
effect or other concerning the possi
bility of "individual liberty becoming
licence." We hold that, as a matter
j of fact, the women of this University
| are and for years have been depend
i ent upon their own strength of char
acter to curtail their own liberty; so
| that it would not approach anything
! resembling license. We feel further
more that the existing rules, or any
! imaginable set of rules would not be
! able to place in the hands of any
governing body the real responsibility
i for a woman's conduct. Furthermore,
it has been our observation that Stan
ford women, being of a high type in
tellectually and morally, may be
trusted to handle their own affairs in
ladylike manners.
In closing, we are still convinced
that the lockout rules as they stand
are involved and burdensome, that
they fail of accomplishing their object
which is of itself of doubtful value,
|
! that they entail an amount of trouble
that is out of all proportion to the
good they would do if they worked
perfectly. Partially due to the letter
from"A Senior" and partially because
of a number of conversations on the
subject, we rather feel that a number
of women agree with us on this mat
ter. We would still like to hear from
them. —Stephen O'Donnell.
