Mr. Editor:
Criticism should always be welcome,
stimulating, and helpful, but when a
man starts to criticize women's af
fairs (on which he can never hope to
have any light, save the very dimmest
glimmer)—then wo women laugh.
If Mr. O'Donnell had a daughter at
Stanford, he, in common with many
(if not with all) parents, would wel
come the existing rules, which make
for the health, happiness, and safety
of our girls. We send our girls to
Stanford to study and for success in
this, a regulated, well-balanced order
of existence is necessary. Some of our
girls, however, are like young colts,
overflowing with life and vigor, and
these forces, for the good of their
owners and everybody else must be
bridled and trained in the right direc
tion. When "self government" becomes
self-license, some authority must step
in and we all respect a firm ruler who
knows and enforces his laws more
than one who is fatally lax.
If the rules to which Mr. O'Donnell
objects do emanate from the office of

| the Dean of Women, that is quite suf
ficient to hall-mark them, for every
body who knows Stanford at all, knows
that the Dean is the kindest, wisest,
: most impartial and most sympathetic
Dean any university could have. She
is a tower of strength, a comfort and
an inspiration to every woman on the
campus. The women know the rules
and if they are not willing to obey
them and so help in keeping up the
high reputation Stanford women right
ly enjoy, they are free to go elsewhere,
where the rules are more to their
taste.
I think some of Mr. O'Donnell's fel
low students will rather resent his
desire for the women to have equal
freedom with the men, also his drag
-1 tring in the honor system in connec
tion with "(he utmost latitude and
complete freedom" they enjoy.
' Mr. O'Donnell's letter is ill-advised
and ignorant. It may have been written
for one and all but it strongly savors
of taking up the cudgels for the "one."
Is this the reason why it did not come
I from the Women's Editor? I hold no
