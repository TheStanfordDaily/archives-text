### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Englishmen are supposed to drop
their H's. If that popular supposition
is (rue, plenty of them must have been
dropped on the various golf courses of
the world, for there are no less than
half a hundred more or less prominent
tournament players whose last names
begin with the eighth letter of the
alphabet.
Truly, "the H's hold the Heights in
the golfing world," and no further
proof of that fact is necessary than
to state that an "H" golfer has won
the British amateur championship
eleven times, the British open seven
times, the American amateur cham
pionship thrice, and the United States
open three times! Besides that re
markable record, add eight United
States women's titles won by H's,
three British women's crowns, and
French, Canadian, professional, and
minor championships too numerous to
mention.
What "H," then, has won the most
ma jo? titles? Most of you would prob
ably say Walter Hagen. But. Sir Wal
ter, in spite of two United States open

victories and two British open titles
to his credit, does not lead the list,
although if you added his wins in the
Professional Golf Association tourna
ments, it would be a different story.
Harold H. Hilton (please notice the
three H's), an English amateur, is the
champion "H" of all, having won the
Great Britain or the United States
amateur or open championship of
seven times. Hilton finished first in
the British open in 1892 and 1897, won
the British amateur in 1900, 1901, 1911,
and 1913, and the United States ama
teur in 1911.
The Hezlet family of Ireland de
serves a paragraph whenever "H"
golfers are mentioned. May Hezlet
was thrice British women's champion
and runner-up once, and her two sis
ters, Florence and Violet, accounted
for three second places in 1907, 1909,
and 1911. Major Charles Owen Hezlet
was runner-up in the British ama
teur in 1914. and was a member of the
British Walker Cup team in 1924 and
1926.
Hooks, Hazards, Honors, and Holes
in-one must not be H'omitted.
