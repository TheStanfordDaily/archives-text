Just to prove there is nothing new |
under the sun, records have come to ,
light which show that Xenophanes, a
Greek philosopher in the seventh cen
tury 13.C., wrote verse deploring the j
over-appreciation of athletes and the I
lack of recognition for the wisdom of j
the sort he boasted.
He railed in no uncertain terms j
over the way his fellow citizens ac
corded the front seats at entertain
ments to men who "had gained a vie- j
tory in the foot races, the pentathlon, j
the wrestling matches, in that brutal
sport, boxing, or in the most fearful 1
of all contests, the pancratium, which I
I
is a hand-to-hand fight with nothing ;
barred." He believed it was wrong to ;
feed the city's athletes from the com- i
inon store and to give him a trophy
as a gift from the municipality.
