# ART GALLERY SHOWS TWO TYPES OF WORK IN PRESENT DISPLAY
## Color Monotypes by Edith Stellman Included in Collections 
### Margaret Mudgett 
The Stanford Art Gallery is now
showing two different kinds of picture
exhibitions which will continue until
May 29. One is a collection of color
monotypes by Edith Kinney Stellman
and the other is a collection of water
colors by Lucile Hinkle.
There are about forty montotypes
covering a wide range of subjects, de
picting the wild and rugged beauty of
California scenery, the age-mellowed
grandeur of the Old World, and bits
of San Francisco. These monotypes
have a depth of color that gives them
an oil painting quality. Mrs, Stellman
experimented in monotype painting
until she achieved, through scientific
combination of pigments and imported
papers and methods, this virility and
beauty of color application.
Paints on Metal
To produce a monotype the artist
paints the picture on some non-absorb
ant flat surface, which is usually of
metal; it is then transferred or printed
from the metal onto the paper by
the use of a press.
Each print or impression requires
repainting; or, in other words, one
print is made from each painting,
hence the name, monotype, which
means "one printing."
The worth of a monotype lies in the
fact that with a permanent outline
repaintings can be made quickly, thus
facilitating the making of a number
of the same subject. Also the print
method gives the monotype a charac
ter or quality distinctly its own.
Mrs. Stellman began her art studies
in the California School of Fine Arts
and later went to Europe, remaining
some time in London and Paris, from
where she has returned to continue
work at her studio in San Francisco.
In addition to her monotype, Mrs.
Stellman is experienced in various
other methods of art expression, such
as oil, tempera, and charcoal, having
devoted herself for a time to por?
traiture painted in tempera.
Watercolors Like Oils
Her water colors show a direct tech
nique which is a desired quality, espe
cially when painting with transparent
watercolors.
