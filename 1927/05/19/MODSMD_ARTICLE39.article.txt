# Englishman Derides Yells Effort Is Larynx-Racking Cheers Ascribed to Madness
## 
### 
According to the University of Red
j lands "Campus," Thomas Burke, the
' English author, is credited with the
| following description of a college yell:
i"I understand that the essentials of
a good college yell is that it be utterly
j meaningless, barbaris, and larynx
j racking. It should seem to be the work
of some philologist who has suddenly
gone mad under the strain of his
; studies and has attempted to converse
| with an aborigine . . .
The "New Student" adds this com-
I ment:
"Some college yells do not go back
to the aborignes, but only to ancient
Greece, 'Brek-ek-ek-ek-ek-ek-ek Coax
Coax,' part of Yale's battle cry, is
| borrowed from 'The Frogs' by Aris
j tophanes."
