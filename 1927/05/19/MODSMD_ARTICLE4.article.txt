# MEDALS AWARDED TO PLACE WINNERS IN AQUATIC MEET
## MANY UPSETS ARE MADE West, Harrison, and Bramel Chalk Up Speedy Victories Over Fast Field 
### 
Seven sets of gold, silver, and bronze
medals, each bearing the seal of the
University, were awarded to the swim
mers and divers that were adjudged
the best in the All-University cham
pionships yesterday afternoon. The
first two races went as expected. West
took the 220-yard breaststroke in the
fast of 3:11 2-5, with Ophuls and
Thornton second and third. Reg Har
rison splashed his way to first in the
50-yard free style, pressed only
Pahl, who surprised the spectators by
coming in a good second.
Upsets Order of Day
Beginning with the 440-yard free
style, upset followed upset with regu
larity, favorites left in the rear and
rank outsiders leading the
Bramel and Stevenson met for the
second time this month in a quarter
mile race. In the Lagunita swim, the
two raced stroke for stroke for nearly
300 yards, Stevenson winning by a bit
of clever maneuvering. Yesterday the
two again raced stroke for stroke to
the last, when the gritty sophomore
spurted ahead to take a two-yard re
venge over Stevenson.
Ted Smith, another dark-horse
entry, won his way to a gold medal
by defeating a veteran varsity swim
mer, Brooks, in the backstroke. The
winner easily pulled away at the start
and kept a good lead throughout the
race. Brooks, who began sl6wly, came
up at the end to pass Jessup.
Van den Akker raised considerable
havoc in the 100-yard free style by
speeding in the last five yards to be
awarded a tie for first place with
Chistenson. Although the judges
called the race a tie, Christenson ap
peared to have touched first under
water.
Winning his last race in University
competition, Bob Williams captured
the 220-yard free style, beating out
Driggs and Peters, two of the fastest
freshman swimmers. Williams and
Driggs fought for the lead to the very
end, when the senior won out.
A relay team composed of Steven
son, Christenson, Van den Akker, and
Williams defeated Brooks, Bramel,
Pahl, and Harrison. Mills won over
Throndson in the diving.
