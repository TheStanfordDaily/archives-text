## 
### 
President Lowell, of Harvard Uni
versity, has requested the resignation
of four policemen of the Cambridge
force for "unnecessary brutality" in
connection with the student "riot" of
February, as a result of which a num
ber of Harvard students were arrested,
tried, and fined for disorderly conduct.
The Harvard Crimson has welcomed
the president's request as an indication
that "the other side will now be
brought into the light of investiga
tion."
