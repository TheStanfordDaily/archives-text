terday. Entries will be for individual
events, with all R.O.T.C. members
eligible.
Twelve Events Planned
Twelve events will make up the pro
gram for the show, with a Roman
race as the starting performance. One
of the most spectacular of the races,
this contest will find each cadet rid
ing standing on two horses.
Following will be a mounted tug-of
war, with teams from two of the bat
teries mounted bareback with no
equipment except a snaffle bridle. The
half-mile "free-style" race will be third
in order.
Women to Take Part
Two events will be staged for wo
men, members of the women's riding
class participating. Those scheduled
are a ladies' musical chair contest and
a ladies' horsemanship contest. A new
event, mounted archery, with the
archers shooting at a gallop, will be
introduced.
Competitive military jumping, com
prising two rounds around a four-jump
course, graded on the best perform
ance, and a one-mile steeplechase,
over six jumps, are the jumping
events. The steeplechase will be the
final event.
In the Cossack race, a survival of
the Russian horseman's method of
defence, contestants will stand in their
stirrups, which are crossed over the
saddle. Mounted wrestling teams from
two batteries will also tilt in an at
tempt to dismount each other.
One Mixed Contest
The horsemanship contest, a main
event, includes an exhibition of horse
manship at a walk, trot, canter, and
over one jump. The only mixed con
test will be a potato and spoon race.
The show is to take place on the
Encina polo field, where a grandstand
will be provided. The Stanford Band
will play. Judges are: Professors P. J.
Treat, J. P. Mitchell, W. J. Crook,
W. H. Barrow, W. B. Owens, and C. B.
Wing, and Major H. B. Johnson. Fred
Trotter will act as starter.
