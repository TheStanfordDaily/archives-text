impirts an Oxford
Hearkening back to the romance and beauty which was
Rome in the days of the Borgias, the Don Juan Oxford
embraces the very spirit of this greatest lover and swords
man of all time. A plain, slipper-like toe, close fitting
heel, trussed around the arch with a saddle drawn with
laces, withal light in weight—that's the DON JUAN —a
shoe which is at once, of the daring, fleet-footed cavalier,
and of the grandeur and dignity of Culture's most Mag
nificent era. Dedicated to the modern-day
Soldier of Fortune!
