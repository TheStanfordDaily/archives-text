tA "Right Start" in Business
is Half the Battle
HOW many know definitely what they want to
do after college—or, what they are fitted to do,
successfully? The undecided man is likely to lose
valuable time striking around for a right start.
Investigate the lines of business which interest
you. Find out all you can about them. Compare the
requirements with your own aptitudes and training.
Try to start on a solid basis—with a strong firm, in
work for which you are logically suited.
Are you considering the bond business on the basis
of fact or hearsay? It is a field of great possibilities
for men who have certain qualifications. For others
it might obviously be the wrong choice.
Our booklet, "The Bond Business as an Occu
pation for College Men," will give you the kind
of information you need, if you are interested in
this field of business.
