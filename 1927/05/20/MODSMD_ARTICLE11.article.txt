# Constitution Has Minor Changes In Old Sports Rules
## 
### 
The revised constitution, which will
be submitted for approval to the stu
dents on May 24. contains only minor
changes in the provisions referring to
athletics. Classification of the sports
remains the same as in the present
constitution, although some alterations
were made in the award plan.
Baseball, basketball, football, tennis,
and track are the major sports. Under
the name of first-class minor sports
are listed boxing, polo, soccer, swim
ming, and weight basketball. The con
stitution committee declared that al
though weight basketball will prob
ably not be on the program this year,
it fel that it had no power to eliminate
this sport after the recent election on
the question.
Minor Sports Same
Fencing, golf, gymnasium, and
wrestling are named as second-class
minor sports. Again the committee
felt that it would be inadvisable to
alter these classifications, even though
a demand was made to raise golf to a
first-class minor sport, and despite the
fact that Stanford does not engage in
intercollegiate wrestling.
The feeling was expressed that if
the student body desires to change
any of the classifications, or to drop
any of the sports, such action should
be made by separate amendment.
Bringing a discussion of the merits
of this provision would serve to divert
the attention of the voters, is the
belief of the committee.
Awards Same
The award of block, circle, and Ger
man "S's" will be continued under the
present plan, according to the section
on athletics, with but one exception.
In soccer, any man who competes
against California one half or more
of the playing time of one game, or
part of two games, will be awarded a
circle block "S." The present constitu
tion rules that the player must com
pete for one full game.
A new form of recognition, the ex
ceptional award, has been designed
for the man in each major and minor
sport whose exceptional work during
the season gives him the unanimous
vote of the captain and coach of that
sport, the general manager, and the
executive committee.
