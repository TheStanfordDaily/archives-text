Blanche Bates when the comedy
opened in New York in 1925. The big
comedy role, Katlierine Everett, is

daughter who does not want to be au
actress in spite of her mother's ambi
tions, is acted by Jane Piumb, a new
comer to Stanford dramatics. Delight's

leads of "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," is

forceful drama, replete with high
comical situations. The play is one
of the main events of Senior Week,
and will be presented the night of

Davis said that this comedy gives
an unusual light on the tradition that
parents should keep their hands off
the futures of their children, and while
it does not attempt to moralize, is a
forceful drama, replete with high
comical situations. The play is one
of the main events of Senior Week,
and will be presented the night of
June 15, at the end of finals.
