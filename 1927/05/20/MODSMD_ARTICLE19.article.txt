# ALL SENIORS SHOULD GIVE TO CLASS FUND, CHAIRMAN DECLARES
## Pledge Cards Distributed to Living Groups Due by Next Monday 
### 
"Every senior should be able to con
tribute to the 1927 Class fund of the
alumni University Fund. The mini
mum is $5, and the first payment is
not until November 1, 1927." This is
the opinion expressed by Robert H.
Bolman, chairman of the endowment
fund committee, yesterday, in com
menting on the new plan.
The purpose of the new scheme is
to turn over all donations to the Uni
versity annually to form an emergency
fund to be used by the Board of Trus
tees when the need is greatest. Each
student is offered an opportunity to
contribute what he can to the Univer
sity, contributions to be made annu
ally over an indefinite period of years,
with the privilege of changing, in
creasing, or even revoking the amount
should it become necessary.
Class Controls Fund
Control of the fund will be in the
hands of the Permanent Executive
Committee of the class, which will act
as a class committee in matters per
taining to the fund. A member of the
class will be elected by the committee
to be its agent or representative in
dealing with the University on mat
ters pertaining to the fund. In case
there are delinquencies to be col
lected, they should be taken care of
by the class agent acting in conjunc
tion with the Comptroller's office of
the University.
A special sub-committee will be set
up to bring in all those who are taking
advanced degrees in 1927, and who
have not affiliated with any Stanford
class. Graduate students who are
transfers should become members of
the Class of 1927.
More than 500 cards have been dis
tributed among committee members
in the various livnig groups, which
should be signed by the first of the
week. Kenenth Graham and Victor
Greisser are in charge of the pledges
for the fraternities, and Ivatlireen
Clock is the head of the sorority
group, with Bob Rraser representing
the halls. Bolman announces that all
committee members should turn in
their pledges to the respective heads
of the committees by Monday.
