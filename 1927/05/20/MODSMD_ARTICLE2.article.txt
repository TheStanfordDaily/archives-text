# ENGLISH DEPARTMENT AWARDS IRENE HARDY PRIZE TO JOHN HIATT
## 
### 
John M. Hiatt, '28, has been awarded
the Irene Hardy Poetry Prize for the
year of 1927 for his poem entitled "The
Battle of Picardy." This is the second
time Hiatt has won the prize of twenty
live dollars, offered by the English de
partment for the best undergraduate
verse. Last year his poem entitled "Busi
ness" was given first place.
Honorable mention was given by the
judges in the order named to the fol
lowing : "Sea Death," by Marshall
Kirby; "Hobo," by Walker Wells; "Epi
taph," by Walker Wells; "To My Broth
er," by Clarence Ricklefs; "From the
Steps at Stanford," by Nanelia Sieg
fried; "Rain," by Nanelia Siegfried.
Hiatt's work is a lung narrative poem
in heroic couplets, and is admirably sus
tained throughout. Although a number
of contributions were received for this
contest from various undergraduates,
and there was a high rate of quality in
all the work submitted, the choice nar
rowed down to the work of a few. The
manuscripts were submitted unsigned,
with the name of the author in a sealed
envelope, so the judges were not aware
that any one author was given more than
one place.
