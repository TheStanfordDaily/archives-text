Herb Fleishhacker, and Stew Way, shot
and discus; Taffy Evans, discus; Bob
King and Tom Work, high jump; Fred

throwers; and Ward Edmonds, pole
vaulter, are the men who will make the
trip, unless last-minute changes are made.

Seven sophomores are making the trip.
McKinnon is in the East now. Forster,
Fleishhacker, and Way are entered in
the weight events. Zombro, Sparling,

sistently above 47 feet, and has done 1
better than 48. His hand lias bothered
him recently.

putter.-., both having beaten 46 feet. Way I
has been having some trouble staying in i
the ring for the discus throw, but has \

heave the javelin in the neighborhood '
of 190 feet. None of the men from col- !
leges competing in the 1.C.4-A. have bet- i
tered that mark, consequently both of !
the Stanford men should place in this j
event.
Edmonds Consistent
Ward Edmonds has cleared 13 feet 3 j
inches in the pole vault and is consistent |
at 13 feet. Edmonds will have a battle j
with Sabin Carr of Yale, and Lee Barnes j
