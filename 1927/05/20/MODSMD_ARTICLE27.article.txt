# The 						Stanford Constitution
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily is offering the students reading matter for the
week-end in today's issue. The new Associated Students' Constitution is
run in its entirety on the insert. It is not printed here to fill up space, as
may be supposed by some who know the tricks of newspaper publishing,
but it is run for the benefit of Stanford University.
No one should cast a vote in the election next Tuesday who has not
read the revised constitution, but everyone should carefully study the
new rules and then decide in the ballot whether he or she approves or
disapproves of the new laws. It is also the opinion of the Daily that the
student should approve, and it is our belief, that, if he will compare the
new rules with the old laws, he will cast an intelligent vote in favor of
the constitution.
The outstanding feature of the new constitution is its brevity, its con
ciseness, and its accuracy. It is the work of a committee that has spent
the better part of six months studying the defects of the old body of rules,
and correcting these weaknesses. Every change that has been made was
effected only after hours of discussion and reasoning.
The constitution is modern, and has been prepared with the view of
taking care of changed conditions on the campus. An example of this
is the change in the organization of the Executive Committee. Formerly
there were three seniors elected to the board from the student body. This
has been altered, and now there are two seniors chosen and in addition a
graduate student. When the junior college ruling goes into effect, the
constitution will be ready to take care of the new situation.
