# Jumping at Conclusions

A short time ago Jlarvard University refused a $60,000 gift that had
been left by Dr. J. Ewing Mears for the study of eugenicsâ€”the science
of improvement of the human race. Dr. Mears was especially interested
in the treatment of defectives and criminal classes. Newspaper experts
about the country took it upon themselves to question the wisdom of
Harvard's actions. The editorial writers in every section of the United
States could see no good reason for refusing the generous oiler.
Arthur Brisbane commented on the university's refusal as follows:
"Eugenics at present is more guesswork than science. Ninety per cent
of the alumni will approve the action of the Harvard trustees. If in John
Harvard's day somebody had offered a legacy to develop the possibility
of getting power out of boiling water, or harnessing lightning, they would
have rejected it with general approval. Fifty years ago if anyone had
offered Harvard $1,000,000 for the study of flying he would have been
told, 'You must not make this great university ridiculous.' Eugenics in
days to come will be the greatest, most important of all sciences."
Everything that Brisbane said is true, but still there are many people
in this country who believed that Harvard had a good reason for reject
ing the offer. They felt that there was something behind the refusal. And
these prophets were correct, for now the truth of the whole incident is
made public. It seems that Dr. Mears had added one condition to his
offer. The stipulation was that the money should be used at all times for
instruction in accordance with his own teachings. Harvard did not care
to have its hands tied for years to come, and so rightly turned down the
endowment. In a few years, Dr. Mears's theories may become obsolete,
but, had Harvard accepted the money, it would have been necessary to
have carried along under the old system.
A large amount of support is received by American universities from
endowments, and therefore to turn down a $60,000 offer means cutting
into the very life-blood of the university, but Harvard refused the money
on a good principle and one well worth following by other educational
institutions in the country. Today Dr. Mears's system of teaching eu
genics is probably one of the best, but tomorrow it may be one of the
worst. Harvard did not want to take the chance.
