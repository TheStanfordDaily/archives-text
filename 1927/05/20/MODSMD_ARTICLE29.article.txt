# Changing Their Minds Again
## 
### 
The recent action of the joint basketball rules committee, limiting the
use of the dribble, has been rescinded and the rules will remain un
changed for the coming season. The reason given for changing the rule
back to its original standing was because of the difficulty involved in
putting the rule into force immediately. The committee did not think of
this when they made the change in the first place. It was only after many
coaches in the country, combined with as many newspapers, objected to
the action.
The Basketball Rules Committee has not given up the idea of chang
ing the game yet. J hey still hope to put the rule into effect after one more
season is passed. The committee urges players, coaches, officials and
others associated with the game to make a thorough study in the meantime
in order that suggestions might be brought before the meeting next year.
That is the scientific way to make a change, and the committee should
have completed its research before they made the change this year. At
least the committee has learned something.
