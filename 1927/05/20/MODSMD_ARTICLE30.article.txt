REFORM
With more letters on file in the of
fice than can be printed on the edi
torial page in one day, and with more
coming in, the discussion on lockouts
started in this column three days ago
is assuming the proportions of a mass
debate. Apparently the supposition
that there was already a great inter
est in this matter under the surface
was entirely justified.
From all that we can gather the
women are in favor of adjusting the
rules. Furthermore, they are in a posi
tion to change the rules. All that is
needed is to substitute action for con
versation and the rules will be
changed.
Today space has been given to two
correspondents. They occupy different
points of view. One interesting feature
of their letters is that they both join
in defense of the dean of women. The
dean, it appears from all available
information, has acted in the past al
together in an advisory capacity, as is
her duty. Once before this year—in
the matter of allowing smoking—Dean
Yost gave the women complete free
dom of action. The presumption is that
in this case she would do the same.

I What is needed now is for the wo j
men to assert themselves. They have
all the machinery available to accom-;
plish a reform, a reform which they :
need and which they apparently desire !
quite earnestly.
The reform should be far-reaching j
in its effect. The women should take j
into consideration that such a reform ,
would not entail removing responsi- j
! bility for the action of individuals. It i
I would simply mean placing that re-1
sponsibility in word where it has al- j
ways been in fact, on the shoulders j
| of the individual. As a matter of fact
! the only strong restraining influence
j on Stanford women today, the only
| influence that can justly be given
i credit for the high moral tone that
prevails among the women is the
• strength of character of the women
themselves. The lockout rules are of
no assistance whatever. They are, to
our mind, merely a weak concession
i to outside public opinion. They serve
| to assure the public that Stanford
women are being watched. We should
; prefer to have Stanford women inform
! the public of the evident truth, that
' they need no watching.

REFORM
With more letters on file in the of
fice than can be printed on the edi
torial page in one day, and with more
coming in, the discussion on lockouts
started in this column three days ago
is assuming the proportions of a mass
debate. Apparently the supposition
that there was already a great inter
est in this matter under the surface
was entirely justified.
From all that we can gather the
women are in favor of adjusting the
rules. Furthermore, they are in a posi
tion to change the rules. All that is
needed is to substitute action for con
versation and the rules will be
changed.
Today space has been given to two
correspondents. They occupy different
points of view. One interesting feature
of their letters is that they both join
in defense of the dean of women. The
dean, it appears from all available
information, has acted in the past al
together in an advisory capacity, as is
her duty. Once before this year—in
the matter of allowing smoking—Dean
Yost gave the women complete free
dom of action. The presumption is that
in this case she would do the same.

I What is needed now is for the wo j
men to assert themselves. They have
all the machinery available to accom-;
plish a reform, a reform which they :
need and which they apparently desire !
quite earnestly.
The reform should be far-reaching j
in its effect. The women should take j
into consideration that such a reform ,
would not entail removing responsi- j
! bility for the action of individuals. It i
I would simply mean placing that re-1
sponsibility in word where it has al- j
ways been in fact, on the shoulders j
| of the individual. As a matter of fact
! the only strong restraining influence
j on Stanford women today, the only
| influence that can justly be given
i credit for the high moral tone that
prevails among the women is the
• strength of character of the women
themselves. The lockout rules are of
no assistance whatever. They are, to
our mind, merely a weak concession
i to outside public opinion. They serve
| to assure the public that Stanford
women are being watched. We should
; prefer to have Stanford women inform
! the public of the evident truth, that
' they need no watching.
