# CAMPUS OPINION
## REVEREND DIVINE TO GIVE SERMON SUNDAY 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
After reading the communications
in "Campus Opinion" and the editorial
which appeared in the Stanford Daily i
of May 19, we feel that these com-1
munications are based on a misconcep- i
tion of the principle of student self
government on which the women's or- j
ganization is based. When the Presi
dent delegated his power to control [
the social life of the women to the
women themselves, he delegated it not
to them as individuals, but to them
as a group, and they decided on the
machinery through which this group
control should be exercised. The group
is democratically organized, as the
representative power is in the hands
of the representatives of all the living
groups, and any changes or modifica
tions of the existing regulations are
their responsibility. The responsibility
of the council is to enforce these regu- J
lations as they have been formulated '
by the representative body.
The formulation of the standards as j
well as the formulation of the specific \
regulations which express them,
therefore, is the concern of the wo
men themselves. During the history
of the organization never once has
the President of the University with
held his approval of changes in the
regulations which expressed the care-!
ful thought of the group as a whole, i
I, therefore, cannot feel that these
regulations could be regarded in any
way as superimposed upon us, or as
similar to the regulations which gov
ern hoarding schools.
The specific criticism which has
arisen in the last few days is entirely
due to misunderstanding. In the past,
there has sometimes been unfair dis
crimination in the matter of granting
late leave and in the administration
of the lockout system. Wishing to cor
rect this, we are working on a system
nf graduated late leave and of uni
form administration of the lockout:
rules. It is probably through a mis- j
understanding of the nature and pur
pose of this plan that false rumors as
to changes have been circulated.
May we remind the women that our i
present rules were adopted by them
only last quarter. At that time every
effort was made to get suggestions.
That was the time to bring out criti
cisms and new ideas, but we are al
ways glad of them.
Council and Conference are the first
to welcome a more alert public opinion
among the women.

similar to the regulations which gov
ern hoarding schools.
The specific criticism which has
arisen in the last few days is entirely
due to misunderstanding. In the past,
there has sometimes been unfair dis
crimination in the matter of granting
late leave and in the administration
of the lockout system. Wishing to cor
rect this, we are working on a system
nf graduated late leave and of uni
form administration of the lockout:
rules. It is probably through a mis- j
understanding of the nature and pur
pose of this plan that false rumors as
to changes have been circulated.
May we remind the women that our i
present rules were adopted by them
only last quarter. At that time every
effort was made to get suggestions.
That was the time to bring out criti
cisms and new ideas, but we are al
ways glad of them.
Council and Conference are the first
to welcome a more alert public opinion
among the women.

The Editor. Sir:
After reading the communications
in "Campus Opinion" and the editorial
which appeared in the Stanford Daily i
of May 19, we feel that these com-1
munications are based on a misconcep- i
tion of the principle of student self
government on which the women's or- j
ganization is based. When the Presi
dent delegated his power to control [
the social life of the women to the
women themselves, he delegated it not
to them as individuals, but to them
as a group, and they decided on the
machinery through which this group
control should be exercised. The group
is democratically organized, as the
representative power is in the hands
of the representatives of all the living
groups, and any changes or modifica
tions of the existing regulations are
their responsibility. The responsibility
of the council is to enforce these regu- J
lations as they have been formulated '
by the representative body.
The formulation of the standards as j
well as the formulation of the specific \
regulations which express them,
therefore, is the concern of the wo
men themselves. During the history
of the organization never once has
the President of the University with
held his approval of changes in the
regulations which expressed the care-!
ful thought of the group as a whole, i
I, therefore, cannot feel that these
regulations could be regarded in any
way as superimposed upon us, or as
similar to the regulations which gov
ern hoarding schools.
The specific criticism which has
