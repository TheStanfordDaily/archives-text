Mr. Editor —also Bull Session:
At the risk of being unethical or
foolish, I'm sending in a masculine
viewpoint—aided, it is true, by a class
discussion —of this agitation concern
ing women's lock-outs. "Stanford
Mother" says a man can have only I
the "dimmest, glimmer" on women's
affairs. Evidently she still believes in j
the absurd distinction between the
masculine and the feminine mind.
At a cursory glance, "Stanford 1
Mother's" letter implies about the j
dirtiest thing one can say about a j

I
I girl. Her attitude is deliberately i
nasty. Some women, she says, are
"young colts" who, if they stay out i
after lock-out time, are going to com
| mit something vicious and immoral. I
As though immorality begins at 10': 30
o'clock —(1:30 with special permis
| sion).
Of course, there is a certain amount
i of viciousness that goes on between
j the men and women at Stanford;
there is at any co-educational institu-:
tion; there is in any phase of life. |
I That there would be any more when j
the women are not forced to come i
home at an absurdly early hour or !
else suffer a penalty is quite fallacious.
The men are not hindered by lock
outs. If they are less virtuous, it can't
bo laid to their freedom to stay out
as late as they wish. If a woman de
i cides chastity, a 10:30 lock out can't
: stop her.
If a girl can't, when she comes to
Stanford, distinguish a "bad" man
| from a "good" one —which after all is
! a relative matter of contemporary
• morals —she does not belong here. The
! University cannot, start at the begin
i ning and give the women the early
i and sane training they should have re
| ceived at home. It should not have to
| tell them when to come in at night. If
| a woman, intellectual enough to come
j to college, does not know how to care
for'herself, both morally and physi
cally, she should go back home.
This is neither the eighteenth nor
the nineteenth century. It is today.
And the old, sneaking idea that a wo- j
man has one virtue —chastity—and !
only one, has long since gone into the i
i limbo of the suppressed virtue of cor- j
sets. Some girls always will wear cor
sets —some always will exalt chastity

over and above every other thing. Rut
there are instances when the other
virtues —as temperance, tolerance,
frankness —far outdistance chastity.
The Women's Council must find
itself in a very embarrassing situation,
for it allows the women of the Uni
versity to smoke —ssh, upstairs and in
private—yet it demands that they be
at home by 10:30. (Three hours later
by special permission) a time when
fifteen-year-olds are being sent to bed.
It can't be for reasons t>f health, for,
once in the hall or the house, they
stay up until 2 or 3 o'clock bulling or
studying. It can't be to make them
study —for that can't be enforced. So
it must be for moral reasons. And,
may one point out, the rules are easily
evaded, and if a girl does not wish to
violate them, it's dark by 8 o'clock
anyway.
The fault does not lie with Dean
Mary Yost. She let the women decide
the smoking rules; surely she'll let
them decide their lock-out regulations.
She knows that she is dealing with
women, not infants. So the fault lies
with the women themselves. They sit
around and squawk and talk a lot, but
they do not do a thing to alleviate
the present conditions. If women don't
know how to care for themselves when
in college, they never will.
