The Editor, Sir:
Yea, verily, the way of a Senior
woman is hard! Now we have the
benevolent maidens of Council solici
tously reminding us that finals are
only four weeks off, and that hence
we must be in by 10:30 every night.
Their concern for our scholarship is
touching. If WE are likely to forget
our coming graduation, THEY, at
least, will do their best to usher us
; safely out of the University.
It is as though, in strangely per
| verted preparation for the terrific step
I from within the college walls out into
what we oddly call LIFE —as though
we had not been living for the past
twenty years or so —we must undergo
: a period of Lenten self-denial. The
I logic is superb; tomorrow we are to
j be harnessed to the heavy wagon of
life's responsibilities; therefore, today
we must keep our muscles tender by
j abstinence from exercise—so, even
; small carts we might be tempted to
1 draw are put under lock and key.
Are we to forego the pleasures of
living and enter upon a solemn term
! of inner contemplation? Who can say
! how much benefit we might indeed
I derive from such a pre-graduation
I Lent? But the women of the Council
1 do not complete their salutary scheme.
« They impose the restrictions without
! furnishing moral preceptors to regu
! late our shut-in time. Are they so
naive as really to suppose that we
shall retire earlier because we cannot
go out of doors, or that we shall study
for finals one moment before the ac
tual pressing necessity is upon us?
We absolve all the women of the 500,
:even Council, from the possession of
such innocence. Therefore, when they
;ive us such excuses for the refusal
to grant further late-leaves, we are
forced to conclude that the real rea
son is their lack of confidence in their
iwn ability to discriminate when a
leave is justifiable and when it is not.
