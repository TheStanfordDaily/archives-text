# GROUND BROKEN FOR BRIDGE ON WESTWOOD HOMESITE OF U.C.L.A
## Contracts Signed Last Week For Construction of New Structure 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May I»\—Ground
was broken last week for the magnificent
new bridge to span the arroyo on the
Westwood campus of the University of
California at Los Angeles—the lirst
structure to arise on the new homesite
of the University.
Final Contracts Signed
Final contracts for the construction of
the bridge were signed and executed by
executives of the State University and
Salih Brothers, contractors for the job,
last week, and the work is now under
way. Under the terms of these contracts,
the bridge must be completed within five
months. The bridge will cost close to
$100,000.
It will span the arroyo about I.U(K) feet
west of the main entrance and will be a
uniquely-decorative structure of rein
forced concrete, faced with brick and
terra cotta, to harmonize with the build
ings planned for the new campus, which
are to be constructed in the immediate
112 uture.
The bridge is to be 310 feet long, 76
feet wide and about 50 feet in height.
Architectural plans for the structure
were drawn by George W. Kelham of
San Francisco, supervising architect for
the building program on the new West
wood site of the University. Decision to
erect the bridge as the first unit of the
building program was reached in order
to make the sites of the buildings on the
campus more easily accessible for trucks,
so that materials can be hauled directly
to the sites where these buildings are to
rise.
Two buildings are now planned and
bids for these will be called for in the
near future. They are the library and
classroom and auditorium building. The
architectural plans for the library are
being drafted by Kelham, while the plans
for the classroom and auditorium build
ing plans are in the hands of Allison and
Allison of Los Angeles.
Work Started
A sum of $100,000 was recently allot
ted by the Regents of the University for
road construction and general campus
improvement on the new site. This work
has already started and will be pushed
as fast as possible.
However, no great amount of grading
is to be done on the new University site.
]t is intended to take advantage of the
natural contour of the land, thus effect
ing economies in building and adding to
the natural beauty of the campus.

was broken last week for the magnificent
new bridge to span the arroyo on the
Westwood campus of the University of
California at Los Angeles—the lirst
structure to arise on the new homesite
of the University.
Final Contracts Signed
Final contracts for the construction of
the bridge were signed and executed by
executives of the State University and
Salih Brothers, contractors for the job,
last week, and the work is now under
way. Under the terms of these contracts,
the bridge must be completed within five
months. The bridge will cost close to
$100,000.
It will span the arroyo about I.U(K) feet
west of the main entrance and will be a
uniquely-decorative structure of rein
forced concrete, faced with brick and
terra cotta, to harmonize with the build
ings planned for the new campus, which
are to be constructed in the immediate
112 uture.
The bridge is to be 310 feet long, 76
feet wide and about 50 feet in height.
Architectural plans for the structure
were drawn by George W. Kelham of
San Francisco, supervising architect for
the building program on the new West
wood site of the University. Decision to
erect the bridge as the first unit of the
building program was reached in order
to make the sites of the buildings on the
campus more easily accessible for trucks,
so that materials can be hauled directly
to the sites where these buildings are to
rise.
Two buildings are now planned and
bids for these will be called for in the
near future. They are the library and
classroom and auditorium building. The
architectural plans for the library are
being drafted by Kelham, while the plans
for the classroom and auditorium build
ing plans are in the hands of Allison and
Allison of Los Angeles.
Work Started
A sum of $100,000 was recently allot
ted by the Regents of the University for
road construction and general campus
improvement on the new site. This work
has already started and will be pushed
as fast as possible.
However, no great amount of grading
is to be done on the new University site.
]t is intended to take advantage of the
natural contour of the land, thus effect
ing economies in building and adding to
the natural beauty of the campus.
