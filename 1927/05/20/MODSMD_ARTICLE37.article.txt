# AERONAUTICS NEEDS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS BELIEF OF LESLEY
## Operation of Unknown Laws Governs Safety Factor Says Professor 
### 
"Aeronautical engineering depends as
I perhaps no other branch of engineering on
j scientific research, especially in physics,
chemistry, mathematics, and metallurgy."
This was the point most stressed by
1 Everett P. Lesley, professor of mechani
cal engineering, in an address at the
i State Aeronautical Conference of the
j California Development Association,
held at the Hotel Whitcomb, San
j Francisco, recently.
! While the cost of construction of com-
J mercial airplanes must be reduced to a
I minimum and the weight of materials
! used in their manufacture must be made
I as small as possible, the primary require
ment is that the planes be safe. Human
j lifes are at stake. "Maneuver ability" is
j the essential requisite of planes used in
warfare. Consequently they may be less
stable than commercial planes. In civil
| aviation safety is the most important fac
tor.
Laws Tested
"The operation of unknown or little
understood laws determines the safety of
aircraft, and the only way facts can be
j determined is through careful scientific
j research such as we are carrying on here
lat Stanford," said Professor Lesley. "In
our wind tunnel we can create the con
j ditions of flight which would occur with
aircraft traveling at a speed up to 90
i miles per hour," he continued. Since the
| entire apparatus is subject to control dur
ing experiments, aircraft models may be
subjected to forces that are varied at
will and without the hazard that attends
experimental flight."
In aircraft "weights have to he reduced
! to the minimum consistent with safe op
' eration." If it is found that the usual
stress an ordinary structure must be
built to withstand is ten pounds, it might
be proportioned to resist successfully a
pressure of a hundred pounds and thus
provide for emergencies. However, the
accompanying increase in the weight if
such a plan were applied to aircraft
would preclude the possibility of flight.
Research Expedient
"As we reduce the weight and conse
quently the 'factor of safety,' we have to
be more sure of what the forces acting
are, in order that the operation of the
aircraft may not be dangerous, and the
I only way to determine the forces, their
nature and variation is through careful
scientific research and investigation," con
; eluded Professor Lesley.
