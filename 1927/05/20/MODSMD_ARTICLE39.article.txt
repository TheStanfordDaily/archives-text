# FOUR YEARS DEVOTED TO PROEUCTION OF WAR FILM
## 
### 
Nearly four years of work have been
devoted to assembling the world war
film, "Men of Purpose," to be shown
by the Stanford Polo Association to
morrow and Saturday nights at the
Assembly Hall for the benefit of the
polo fund.

The film, which occupies about two
hours, is a composite of pictures cov
ering the whole period of the war and
nearly all of the participating armies.
All the scenes are official, having been
taken by the signal corps of the Allied
and the Central powers.
The picture shows what actually
happened in Europe during the World
War. There are no motion picture
heroes in the cast, for all the heroes

| are fighting men attached to the ;
armies which took part in the struggle. j
It is compiled in the form of a pic- j
torial history of the war. The actual
operations of all branches of the ser-;
vice are shown in detail, and one of
the high spots of interest is a duel in :

I the air between an American plane
and a German airship with the enemy
aircraft finally landing in flames less
than a hundred feet from the camera
j man.
Two showings will be made each
! night, at 7:30 and 9:30 o'clock. Tickets
! are fifty cents each and half of the
proceeds will go to defray the ex
: penses of the polo team on its recent
trip North.
