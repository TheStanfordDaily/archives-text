"That's fine," says Robert S. Dollar,
president of the Dollar Steamship Com
pany. "But you really haven't a chance
of getting a job."
If you come from college and speak of
shipping out to Captain Dollar, he will
probably throw up his hands in despair,
even th'ough you have the best letters of
recommendation imaginable. The Dollar
Line receives thousands of applications
from travel-inclined collegians who are
willing to do almost anything to get al
most anywhere, particularly around the
world, and gives out almost no jobs.
More Ships Needed
"If we gave all the college men jobs
who apply," said "Cappy Ricks" in an
interview given to The Stanford Daily
yesterday, "there wouldn't be room for
a single passenger and we would be
forced to put on additional ships."
Asked what positions collcge men usu
ally filled on shipboard, Captain Dollar
laconically remarked, "No positions." All
the jobs, possibly excepting the ship's or
chestra, are filled with men who regu
larly follow the sea. The only way to

hop, skip, and jump out of college and
land on a Dollar boat is by producing
sufficient evidence to convince the steam
ship officials that you intend to make
sailing your life work. Apparently the
Dollar company is hard to convince, as
Captain Dollar was unable to recall any
skipper or officer with a college edu
cation.
Looking for Men
Despite the chilly reception one re
ceives when looking for a berth for the
summer, the Dollar people are eager to
\ find men who will work for them. But

hop, skip, and jump out of college and
land on a Dollar boat is by producing
sufficient evidence to convince the steam
ship officials that you intend to make
sailing your life work. Apparently the
Dollar company is hard to convince, as
Captain Dollar was unable to recall any
skipper or officer with a college edu

Looking for Men
Despite the chilly reception one re
ceives when looking for a berth for the
summer, the Dollar people are eager to
\ find men who will work for them. But
I "work" is spelled with capital letters and

seas and romance; for he who would go
to sea must first cool his h cc ' s under an
office table. All aspirants must start at
the absolute bottom, regardless of what
is or isn't written on a diploma, and if
merit shows through, the college gradu
ate or the grammar school graduate will
be promoted to the docks, thence to a
ship's office, and then back to port again.

to work my way around the
world this summer," says Joe College
Man.
"That's fine," says Robert S. Dollar,
president of the Dollar Steamship Com
pany. "But you really haven't a chance
of getting a job."
If you come from college and speak of
shipping out to Captain Dollar, he will
probably throw up his hands in despair,
even th'ough you have the best letters of
recommendation imaginable. The Dollar
Line receives thousands of applications
from travel-inclined collegians who are
willing to do almost anything to get al
most anywhere, particularly around the
world, and gives out almost no jobs.
More Ships Needed
"If we gave all the college men jobs
who apply," said "Cappy Ricks" in an
interview given to The Stanford Daily
yesterday, "there wouldn't be room for
a single passenger and we would be
forced to put on additional ships."
Asked what positions collcge men usu
ally filled on shipboard, Captain Dollar
laconically remarked, "No positions." All
