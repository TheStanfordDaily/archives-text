# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Glorious Youth! As the former "boy
wonders" and girl prodigies in sports
pass on to maturity and become "has
beens" at 23 or 24 ("Young" Stribling,
for instance), new youngsters arrive
to take their places until they, in turn,
are beaten by those still younger.
It seems that just the other day
Johnny Weissmuller was startling the
Hports world by breaking the swim
ming records of Norman Ross and
Duke Kahanamoku, and was hailed
everywhere as the infant aquatic
champion of all time, and now along
comes George Kojac, of DeWitt Clin
ton High School, New York, and not
only beats Weissmuller in the 150*-
yard backstroke race at the national
indoor championships, but breaks
Johnny's world's record as well. Then,
a week or so later, just to show it
wasn't an accident, he swam an exhi
bition in Philadelphia and broke the
world's best mark for the 220-yard
backstroke event. George won't bo
old enough to vote for four more
years, and long before that time should
bold most of the records at his spe
cialty. He is a fine free-style swimmer,
too, and should help the American
Olympic team materially in 1928.
Another water-baby, whose career
wil) be watched with great interest, is
little Dorothy Poyton, of the Holly
wood Athletic Club, who placed third
in two diving events at the women's
indoor national swimming champion
ships at Buffalo last winter. She is 13
years old now, and will be about ready
lo win an Olympic championship next
summer at Amsterdam, as Aileen llig
gin did at (hat age at Antwerp in 1920.
Freddie Lindstrom, erstwhile baby

I of the New York Giants, is three years
I older than his team-mate, Melvin Ott,
! who has already been called a "left
handed Hornsby" because of his fault
less style at the plate. "The infant"
played his first full game of the season
on April 23, made one hit, scored one
| run, stole one base, and fielded fault
lessly. He is already a great drawing
! card in New York.
] Over in England they have a child
j tennis wonder, who bids fair to make
I Helen Jacobs, 18, and Helen Wills, 21,
look to their laurels. Betty Nuthall,
i who last year startled the critics by
I defeating many of her elders at Wim
bledon while wearing shoulder-length
i curls, has now bobbed her hair, having
; reached the advanced age of fifteen.
On April 30 she won the women's lmrd
! court championship of England. You'll
hear more of this little miss this surn
! mer.
