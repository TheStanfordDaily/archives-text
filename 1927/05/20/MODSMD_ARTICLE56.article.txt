# CHEAPER DAMS NEED OF WATER PROJECTS, SAYS CHARLES MARX
## 
### 
That a more economical form of dam
construction, lighter but with all the fac-
I tors of safety of the massive gravity
dam, is an important need in the water
i power and irrigation projects of the
j country, is the opinion of Charles D.
| Marx, professor emeritus of engineering.
I He advanced this theory in an illustrated
J lecture yesterday on the "Progress of
! the Stevens Creek Project" before a gen
eral assembly, sponsored by
the local chapter of the American So
ciety of Civil Engineers.
I I)r. Marx is one of the leaders in the
Stevens Creek test dam project, which
is backed by interested engineers and
public service corporations. The South
ern California Edison Company was the
! largest contributor, donating $25,000.
! The total cost of the dam is $110,000.
) If the use of models for actual con
' struction tests proves satisfactory, the
I
factors of safety will tie increased and
cost of dam construction will be lowered,
believes Professor Marx.
