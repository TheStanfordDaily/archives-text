# Enema Gymnasium Will Build Set of Driving Nets for Golf Players
## 
### 
Six driving nets for amateur
golfers are being constructed in
the space southeast of Encina
gymnasium and will probably be
ready for use in another two
weeks.
These nets are the first step
in the establishment of a course
for "dub" golfers which will be
conducted on a trial basis next
autumn quarter, with Coach
"Dink" Templeton in charge.
Classes will be conducted daily
from 2:00 to 4:00 o'clock. No
credit will be given next fall, but
if a sufficient number of men are
interested in the work the course
will be given on a more formal
basis in the future.
