# MISSISSIPPI FLOOD IS GREATEST IN CENTURY GEOLOGIST DECLARES
## River Spreads Over Flood Plain into Region of Cotton Lands 
### 
"The Mississippi flood began to
gather last September and during (he
winter one after another of its big
tributaries overflowed, flooding the
Ohio and Arkansas river valleys," said
Dr. Eliot Black welder of the Geology
Department yesterday. "These, added
to tlie normal flood, accumulated in
one big deluge this spring."
The Mississippi, like all big rivers,
has been in the habit of overflowing
and spreading over its flood plain,
much to the discomfort, trouble, and
expense of the people who have set
tled in the region. The river over
flows a little every year, but only a
few times in a century does it cause
big floods, Dr. Blackwelder explained.
In relating the previous history of
tlie Mississippi Valley. Blackwelder
said that the lowlands w f r<; settled
about a century pro, becaust of the.
rich lands which are ideal for cotton
and other products. As these lands
were subject to flooding, the banks
of the river were artificially built up
to keep the river in the channel. This
was successful except in cases of oc
casional disasters. Before confined, the
river would often change its course.
He declares that it is lengthening
itself by building its channel with
sediment out'into the gulf. Although
the channel bed has risen but little,
it makes the river more liable to break
from its banks. While these levees
hold for a while, in the long run they
make the situation worse.
Blackwelder recommends that be
fore steps be taken to remedy this
situation, a careful study of the entire
problem ought to be made by a group
of experts, including geologists, en
gineers, economists, financiers, and
statesmen. Opinions on this problem,
as well as funds, are necessary, he be
lieves.
