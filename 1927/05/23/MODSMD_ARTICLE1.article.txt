# DR. BAILEY EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE IN WOMEN; DEAN UPHOLDS RULES
## "Time Not Ripe for Action" Says Dean; Requests Women to Wait 
### Virginia Voorheis 
In response to a request from the
Daily, Dean Yost lias submitted the fol
lowing statement as to her attitude on
the question of a change in women's
lockout regulations:
"I have read the statement made by
the Women's Council in regard to the
social regulations of the women, and
it seems to me clear and accurate in its
description of the grants of power given
to them by the President and of the
representative machinery through which
they exercise their power.
Democracy on Trial
Any woman through her Conference
representative can get any question
brought tq) for discussion in the legis
lative body ,and both Conference and
Council invite suggestions to build up a
responsible public opinion, so that they
promote not only their interests, but the
standards which the women feel will
widen interests of the University shall
he based on a vital sense of what the
actual situation is and shall be loyally
supported, as the price of their "respon
sible freedom." Their problem is the
problem of all democracies —to keep the
constituents alive to their individual and
collective responsibilities, and to promote
informed, rational discussion on common
problems. Here as elsewhere democracy
is on trial.
Not Enough Time
"In regard to the present situation,
there is of course no question of the
right of the women to discuss any modi
fication or change in their social regula
tions, and when only formulated and ap
proved by the Conference, to forward
them to the President for his approval.
The only qdestion now is, is this, so near
the end ol the spring quarter, a favor
able time to undertake such a considera
tion ?
"Since I have never seen wise and
broadly considered decisions to be made
by a group when acting in a hurry or in
i time of excitement, by advice to the
women is to ask Council to get from the
outgoing seniors in writing any construc
| tive suggestions fur changes which their i
I experience leads them to consider wise j
1 for the interests of Stanford, ami to use
j these in considering the whole matter in
I the autumn.
Women Should Formulate
In the meantime, each woman should
J be urged to think over and formulate
| this summer what changes or modifica
[ tions, if any, she would like to see adopt
j ed, and to be ready to join in making
! the decision in the fall. She would thus
1 have time to see all the bearings of the
! subject, to realize that our group is dis
| similar in many ways; in age, back
ground, training, and maturity of judg
ement; and that the University is re
i sponsible to the parents and to the gen
j eral public for providing a social life
! which will be an organic part of the
! education we offer here. Moreover, this
arrangement would have the further ad
vantage of having the group which made
the decision, the group which would have
to live under it and test it out.
Sorority Problem Imminent
"Not only is the time to examinations
a short one, but there is another ques
tion for the women to decide which has
been asked for lirst and which will take
J both time, thought, and energy. When j
;i returned from the East, Pan-Hellenic j
J asked me to consider the wisdom of I
I changing rushing and bidding from the j
i spring quarter to the winter.
As this is a question which concerns
i not only the sorority women but' the
Hall women as well, I was unwilling to
! make a decision without having all the ;
j women discuss the matter and give me
their opinion. I have taken up the matter ;
I with Conference, the body representing I
! all the living groups, and have told them j
| that I shall talk the matter over sepa-!
. I
rately with the sorority women, the in- j
dependent women in Roble, and the |
pledges.
These conferences will be called as
| soon as Pan-Hellenic answers definitely
; certain questions which will state ex-
I actlv what it wishes considered. In view :
of the entire situation, therefore, 1 ad
vise against taking up the matter of a
( change in social regulations now.
"May one wonder, since the men will |
not claim that they have solved all their
j problems, if this would not be an ad
! vantageous time for them to begin to j
! meditate on some of their own most'
j pressing ones?"

J both time, thought, and energy. When j
;i returned from the East, Pan-Hellenic j
J asked me to consider the wisdom of I
I changing rushing and bidding from the j
i spring quarter to the winter.
As this is a question which concerns
i not only the sorority women but' the
Hall women as well, I was unwilling to
! make a decision without having all the ;
j women discuss the matter and give me
their opinion. I have taken up the matter ;
I with Conference, the body representing I
! all the living groups, and have told them j
| that I shall talk the matter over sepa-!
. I
rately with the sorority women, the in- j
dependent women in Roble, and the |
pledges.
These conferences will be called as
| soon as Pan-Hellenic answers definitely
; certain questions which will state ex-
I actlv what it wishes considered. In view :
of the entire situation, therefore, 1 ad
vise against taking up the matter of a
( change in social regulations now.
"May one wonder, since the men will |
not claim that they have solved all their
j problems, if this would not be an ad
! vantageous time for them to begin to j
! meditate on some of their own most'
j pressing ones?"
