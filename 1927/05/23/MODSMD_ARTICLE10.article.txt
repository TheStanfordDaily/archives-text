I
I.C. 4A. title next Friday and Saturday.
Harry Maloney and Bill Ellington
1 are in charge of the men who are
; journeying East. Track Manager Lee
! McCulloch is also making the trip, tak
ing charge of the affairs en route,
j Clarence West and Ross Nichols,
! hurdlers; Biff Hoffman, A1 Forster,

Templeton May Leave
There is a possibility that Coach
Dink Templeton may be able to leave
I today or tomorrow, arriving in Phila
delphia in time to guide his men
j through the finals.
i Sidney Meeks jumped 23 feet 8
I inches Friday afternoon to earn liim
i self a trip to Philadelphia. He has
; been handicapped by a bad stone
I bruise on his take-off foot.
This provides Stanford with three
| broad jumpers capable of clearing 24
j feet. All of them are consistently
' above 23 feet 6 inches.
With Jesse Hill of U.S.C. and Jake
| Kabelitz of California, also competing,
! Eastern jumpers will be hard put to
| earn a place in this event.
Coach Templeton has been giving
Tom Work some strenuous tryouts
j during the past month in an effort to
; get him back into form.
Work to Attempt Repeat
; Last year Tom cleared G feet
inches at the 1.C.-4A. meet after a
mediocre season. Perhaps he will re
| peat this performance Saturday,
j Bob King should retain the cliam-
pionship that he won last year in the
high jump, with the possibility that
he may break his own record, 6 feet
S 1 inches. Bob has cleared 6 feet 6V&
inches on occasions this year.
"Ward Edmonds, sophomore, is the
only Cardinal entry in the pole vault.
His consistent conquering of 13 feet
coupled with his leap of 13 feet 3
inches at the Fresno Relays should
place him well up in this event.
Team Injured by Illness
Injuries and illnesses have handi
capped the Stanford team to a con
siderable extent during the past few
weeks. Tom Joaquin, star javelin
thrower, counted on for a first place
in this event, has a sore arm. He will
not compete any more this season.
Bob King and Ross Nichols are still
recuperating from attacks of flu. Biff
Hoffman had a severe cold when he
left Saturday that will keep him from
putting forth his best efforts unless
he conquers it before Saturday.
A1 Forster hurt his fingers several
weeks ago putting the shot. They are
still tightly taped.
