# GREATER BREVITY, CLARITY FEATURE NEW CONSTITUTION
## Document Takes Cognizance Of Importance of Graduates 
### Milton Silverman 
Simplification is the keynote of the
revised constitution, which will be of
fered for the approval of the student
body tomorrow. With this simplifica
tion has been included a clarification
of vaguely defined provisions that
were themselves useless.
Such committees as the Social Ser
vice Board, the endowment fund com
mittee ,the senior flower committee,
tho sophomore convalescent home
committee, and the senior control com
mittee have been left out entirely. The
Social Service Board, for example, was
dissolved by the unanimous consent
of the members. The endowment fund
committee is at present non-existent.
Others exist only, as the saying has
it, to have their pictures in the Quad.
Committee Relations Simplified
Relations have been simplified and
clearly defined between the Ex Com
mittee and all other councils and com
mittees. Although there has been a
general understanding in the past that
both the Men's and Women's Council
were under the authority of the Ex
Committee, there is no definite clause
to that effect in the old constitution.
In the new draft, and especially at the
request of Dean Yost, the position of
the Councils is defined in relation to
the Ex Committee. The A.W.S. has
likewise been delegated certain well
