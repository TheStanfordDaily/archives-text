# GREATER BREVITY, CLARITY FEATURE NEW CONSTITUTION
## Document Takes Cognizance Of Importance of Graduates 
### Milton Silverman 
Simplification is the keynote of the
revised constitution, which will be of
fered for the approval of the student
body tomorrow. With this simplifica
tion has been included a clarification
of vaguely defined provisions that
were themselves useless.
Such committees as the Social Ser
vice Board, the endowment fund com
mittee ,the senior flower committee,
tho sophomore convalescent home
committee, and the senior control com
mittee have been left out entirely. The
Social Service Board, for example, was
dissolved by the unanimous consent
of the members. The endowment fund
committee is at present non-existent.
Others exist only, as the saying has
it, to have their pictures in the Quad.
Committee Relations Simplified
Relations have been simplified and
clearly defined between the Ex Com
mittee and all other councils and com
mittees. Although there has been a
general understanding in the past that
both the Men's and Women's Council
were under the authority of the Ex
Committee, there is no definite clause
to that effect in the old constitution.
In the new draft, and especially at the
request of Dean Yost, the position of
the Councils is defined in relation to
the Ex Committee. The A.W.S. has
likewise been delegated certain well
noted powers.
Doubtful Provisions Cleared
Many doubtful provisions, such as
the amount of authority the Ex Com
mittee holds over the publications is
definitely decided in the charter sys
tem. This charter system, in taking
over publications, dramatics, debate,
and rally committee, has practically
cut the size of the constitution in half.
Publications alone took an overwhelm
ingly large amount of the old docu
ment.
Definite recognition has been taken
of the importance of the number of
graduate students in the University.
This recognition has led to changing
the provisions for membership on the
Ex Committee. Instead of having three
senior and no graduate representa
tives on the committee, it is planned
to have two seniors and one graduate.
Instead of requiring that all A.S.S.U.
officers be undergraduates when
elected, it is planned to allow either
graduates or undergraduates to be
elected. #
Class Offices Outlined
Class officers were given scarcely
any mention in the old constitution,
whereas the new one definitely names
them and mentions their duties and
powers.
In only two cases were distinct ad
ditions made to the old laws. One is
the provision that all proposed amend
ments be submitted to the head of
the Political Science department to
check on the form of the amendment.
This change would prevent any hasty,
ignorant amendments, and would keep
the constitution from being cluttered
lip with a number of useless, bother
some clauses.
The second major change is the in
troduction of the rules on athletics
into the constitution proper. Although
the revision committee believes that
athletics should be retained in the by
laws, the student body, in an election
last year, voted in favor of the change.
