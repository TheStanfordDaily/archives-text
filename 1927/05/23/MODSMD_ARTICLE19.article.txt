## Washington Defeated Five Matches to One in Finals Saturday DECISIVE PLAY SHOWN Stanford Team Loses Only Two Matches in Whole Tournament 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., May 22. —Stanford
University's powerful net team won
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate tennis
title here yesterday by decisively beat
ing the University of Washington, five
to one, in the final matches. The
Cardinals downed Oregon Agricultural
College Friday and the University of
Oregon yesterday morning.
The Aggies, the first to fall before
Stanford, were crushed six matches
to none. None of the Cardinal players
was at all hampered by the Northern
ers, although they experienced some
difficulty with the smooth cement
courts, unusually slippery because of
the constant drizzle which lasted
throughout the tournament.
Henry Neer, brother of Phil Neer,
former Stanford tennis star, was the
only Oregon man to take a match
from the Cardinals in the matches
yesterday morning. He defeated Ralph
McElvenny in three sets, 0-G, 6-4, 11-9.
The remainder of the matches were
captured easily.
Washington, which had been win
ning its matches handily, took a sound
beating, five to one, from Stanford,
thus giving the Southerners the title.
Lionel Ogden was the one to lose in
this contest, being defeated by
Dranga, ranking Huskie player, in
three close sets, 8-6, 4-6, 6-4.
Although Stanford was the favorite
to take the coast title, Northern ex
perts were surprised to see Washing
ton and Oregon, the outstanding con
tenders, beaten by such decisive
scores. Washington won the North
western section honors last year, with
Oregon runner-up.
