# Rules Fit Only for Children Should Be Abolished Says Professor
## 
### Elizabeth Clark 
"The women of this University should
abolish rules which both the men and
women of Stanford know to be tit only
for the government of little girls, and
which are moreover the cause of con
stant annoyance and ill feeling, and the
opportunity of a great deal of that small
tyranny which is inseparable from the
administration of petty rules."
This is the opinion expressed by Dr.
Margery Bailey, assistant professor in
the English department, on the subject
of women's lockouts.
Women's Own Fault
Dr. Bailey stated that it is the fault
of the women students as a whole and
not the Women's Council that the lock
out system is as it is. The Council has
always been open for suggestions, but
none have been forthcoming. She went
on to say:
"Co-education from time to time seems
to be trembling on the brink of dissolu
tion. Reasons given invariably against
co-education are that women, in spite of
the fact that they earn good grades and
make witty or intelligent reports in class,
are not really capable of thinking in
mature terms as men are and hence that
they retard education very seriously.
Fault Is Result of Training
"The fault does not lie entirely with
the women themselves; it is a result of
their training, which in truth is the re
sult of some two centuries of narrow
social training; for years it was con
sidered unladylike for a woman- to be
intellectual. In the eighteenth century it
was distinctly unladylike for women to
be authors, and even in the nineteenth
century the Bronte sisters and George
Eliot published their works under mas
culine pseudonyms.
"Fortunately any number of changes in
society and in methods of education have
made women more independent, more
capable, more self-respecting, and less
apologetic. It is still true, however, that
many even of the intelligent women are
slow to act in asserting their rights and
capacities because they do not wish to
appear aggressive and unwomanly, and
many women actually endeavor to con
ceal the fact that they have any intelli
gence at all in the hope that they may
be considered elegantly charming.
"A third type, the girls who want to
live all their lives exactly as they lived
in the nursery merely because they have
been told it is proper, and who want
everybody else to live in the same way,
frequently forms the group that in any
self-governing student body likes to
make the laws. This is in no wise to be
construed as criticism of the present
Women's Council or of the Council just
preceding, both of which appear to be
open-minded and willing to take sug
gestions.
Need More Consistency
"Somebody must begin and carry
through a means of making the rules
governing the life of the women of the
campus more consistent and more sens
ible than they are now in an effort to
demonstrate the equality of women with
men. The women not long ago insisted
on being allowed to smoke freely. This
was a pitiful move toward independence
—asserting the right to practice a petty
habit—and in the minds of many per
sons goes iar to prove what the critics
of co-education have to say.
" 1 he women in a university ought to
be of an age and character to know how
to take care of themselves. Certainly in
England this is accepted as self-evident.
If they are not of an age the University
should reject their applications for ad
mission, and it is quite capable of rid
ding itself of any ill-prepared and ill
trained women if they should manage to
matriculate.
"Women who need to be protected or
who have to be watched are extremely
difficult to teach and seldom have any
ideas worth offering to classes.
"It is at once gratifying and some
what amusing to see that it is Stanford
men who appear chiefly anxious that the
women shall appear in their proper light
as self-respecting and inherently decent
adult human beings." *
