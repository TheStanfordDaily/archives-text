# Stanford Wants Prohibition!
## 
### 
The latest propaganda sheet to appear before the public is the Inter
national Student which is the official organ of the Intercollegiate Pro
hibition Association. It has chosen the following for a motto: "To aid
students everywhere in an intelligent study of the world problem of alco
holism."
In the May issue is printed a special article written by E. Everett
Cortright, professor of education of New York University, on "Objective
Evidence of College Student Opinion in the United States abbut Pro
hibition." In this article we find that Stanford University voted 94 per
cent strong for the rigid enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment. In
the next paragraph we find that 69 per cent of the voting Stanford stu
dents did not want the Eighteenth Amendment abolished.
In the files of the Stanford Daily for November 17, 1926, the day
after the polls were held on the prohibition question, we find that modi
fication of the present laws to permit light wines and beers received the
largest number of votes of any of the three proposals on prohibition. A
total of 1189 votes were cast, of which 420 favored the existing situation,
311 repeal, and 458 modification. And the Bull Session commented on the
vote at that time by saying that "Stanford went as wet as a barkeeper's
towel."
Professor Cortright must have a queer system of arithmetic. He evi
dently uses a method by which results desirable to his research can be
obtained, lie is a great little fixer. He lists a number of other colleges
which carried on similar ballots, and in every case he shows that the stu
dents want prohibition. How many, if any, of these institutions actually
voted to respect the present situation, is hard to determine.
Such an article and such propaganda can never win a campaign.
Sooner or later the truth of the matter will be found out. "You can fool
all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time,
but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time."
