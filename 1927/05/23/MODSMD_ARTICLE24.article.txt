# Heading East
## 
### 
Fifteen Stanford athletes arc heading East. Two other Cardinal stars
are already at Philadelphia training for the national track and field cham
pionship for 1927. A week ago these seventeen track men were favored
to win the national title, but since then an incident, which borders on
disaster, has occurred. Their coach is confined to the hospital and did
not leave with the team Saturday morning.
It is often the case that when the final meets of the year have rolled
around, the coach takes a back seat, for his task of getting the athletes
into shape is finished. Not so with Dink Templeton. Templeton's greatest
contribution to his men is his ability to watch his stars and detect over
training or under-training among them, lie knows how to handle men
who are in the habit of acquiring a nervous attitude before meets. He
knows how to inspire that nervous feeling in others who are lacking in
that faculty.
Templeton is not a coach who is ever harping at his men. One never
hears him saying "don't do this'' and "don't eat that." Ifc watches the
man's physical condition only as it is reflected through his mental attitude.
In most cases, Templeton realizes that each man should be his own coach
and should be able to regulate his own diet and his own hours. Templeton
advises rather than commands. And it is largely in this faculty of aiding
the track men that he has won the name lie now possesses.
The track teqm has not lost the 1.C.A.A.A.A., but the Stanford squdtl
enters the meet handicapped. The Cardinal athletes left the Coast Satur
day determined to win the championship, for Stanford and for themselves,
but mainly for Templeton.
