On Tuesday the women's conference
meets. Stanford women will have an
opportunity to present any suggestions
they may have for alleviating the in
convenience engendered by the pres
ent lockout system.
We have yet to meet any Stanford
women who hold a brief for the pres
ent arrangement. It merely remains to
be seen if they have enough collective
enthusiasm to put through a reform.
From what has been learned of the
mental attitude of the women in the
past few days, this prediction is ven
tured.
The lockout system, for all that it is
odious, will probably not be abolished
in its entirety. You ask why? Because
long years of propaganda cannot be
offset by a half-dozen editorial articles,
however pertinent or however in
spired. And long years of propaganda
have convinced not only Stanford wo
ment but the women of other universi
ties that the presence of some sort of
lockout system is the only assurance
that the outside world has that they
are not immoral. They are not to be
blamed too much, therefore, if they go
about this matter somewhat carefully.
Particularly are they not to be blamed
by the men, who have contributed their

share toward the false conception of
propriety which places so much stress
upon the time element.

"PROUD AND SATISFIED"
As this controversy progresses we
hear again and again that familiar
bromidic reference to the presumed
connection between the ten-thirty clos
ing rule and the moral integrity of
Stanford women. Are we to assume
that Stanford women are locked up
at ten-thirty for fear of what they
might do if they were not? Or are we
to assume that they are locked up at
ten-thirty because their own intelli
gence is not equal to the problem of
assuring themselves sufficient sleep
to protect their health?
The most vehement supporter of the
present rules signs herself "a proud
and satisfied Stanford mother." Proud
because she considers it necessary to
lock her daughter up at night? Satis
fied because the present rules provide
ample surveillance for her daughter?
Our personal conception of a Stan
ford mother with reason to be proud
and satisfied would be one who could
send her daughter away to Stanford
confident that she was capable of tak
ing care of herself. â€”Steve O'Donnell.
