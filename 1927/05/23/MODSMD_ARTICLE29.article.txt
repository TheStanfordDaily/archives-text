# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
While fully agreeing with you that
all things relating to Stanford student
life should be freely discussed, I think
the subject under debate at present
occupies a position by itself. Only the
Dean and Council have inside knowl
edge of this matter and for obvious
reasons, they cannot justify them
selves by revealing any of that knowl
edge. Cannot we trust them to do the
very best they know for the 500, with
out making a very difficult and often
painful task, any harder?
No one will deny that there are
weak links in the 500 chain and the
rules, I assume, are to help these weak
links to keep a proper balance between
study and pleasure. I surmise that
late leave has been suspended for the
I remainder of the quarter, in order that
the girls may have more time to pre
pare for the finals, and a good thing
too. It is not fair to faculty or parents
for the students to regard the Univer
sity as a Country Club, pushing studies
into a very secondary and unsatisfac
tory place, as so many of the students
do at present.
No doubt the Council will feel deep
ly grateful to your Women's Editor
for not condemning them "too severe
ly," but why does she condemn them
at all, when she asserts that "the rules
themselves" are to blame? The trend
of present-day action is to abolish and
destroy things, right and left, right or
wrong. This taken by itself without
relation to other things and without
thought of replacement, when neces
sary, is highly dangerous and inevi
tably disastrous. Will the Women's
Editor tell us what would happen if
the present "leave" rules were abol
ished? Would those girls who would
stay out as late as they wish have
latchkeys or would the doors of their
houses and halls be left on the latch
all night? What prospect of rest would
there be for those retiring early? How
is a girl to stand shortened hours of
sleep, night after night, without be
coming a nervous wreck?
Nothing that has appeared in your
paper so far has altered my conviction
that "lockout rules accomplish the ob
ject which they are intended to accom
plish and that those objects are de
sirable." I continue to be a proud and
satisfied —Stanford Mother.

The Editor, Sir:
While fully agreeing with you that
all things relating to Stanford student
life should be freely discussed, I think
the subject under debate at present
occupies a position by itself. Only the
Dean and Council have inside knowl
edge of this matter and for obvious
reasons, they cannot justify them
selves by revealing any of that knowl
edge. Cannot we trust them to do the
very best they know for the 500, with
out making a very difficult and often
painful task, any harder?
No one will deny that there are
weak links in the 500 chain and the
rules, I assume, are to help these weak
links to keep a proper balance between
study and pleasure. I surmise that
late leave has been suspended for the
I remainder of the quarter, in order that
the girls may have more time to pre
pare for the finals, and a good thing
too. It is not fair to faculty or parents
for the students to regard the Univer
sity as a Country Club, pushing studies
into a very secondary and unsatisfac
tory place, as so many of the students
do at present.
No doubt the Council will feel deep
ly grateful to your Women's Editor
for not condemning them "too severe
ly," but why does she condemn them
at all, when she asserts that "the rules
themselves" are to blame? The trend
of present-day action is to abolish and
destroy things, right and left, right or
wrong. This taken by itself without
relation to other things and without
thought of replacement, when neces
sary, is highly dangerous and inevi
tably disastrous. Will the Women's
Editor tell us what would happen if
the present "leave" rules were abol
ished? Would those girls who would
stay out as late as they wish have
latchkeys or would the doors of their
houses and halls be left on the latch
all night? What prospect of rest would
there be for those retiring early? How
is a girl to stand shortened hours of
sleep, night after night, without be
coming a nervous wreck?
Nothing that has appeared in your
paper so far has altered my conviction
that "lockout rules accomplish the ob
ject which they are intended to accom
plish and that those objects are de
sirable." I continue to be a proud and
satisfied —Stanford Mother.
