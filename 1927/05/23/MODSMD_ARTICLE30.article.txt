The Editor, Sir:
The realization came as a shock to
me that the women on this campus j
have waited around until one of the
men students brought the fact to their
attention that Ihey are living under a |
supposed self-government, with rules
with which they are far from satisfied
and doing absolutely nothing to im
prove the situation.
Every woman I have conversed with
on the subject has been in favor of a
change, and I feel confident that some
thing definite will come out of the Dull
Session article. I think it is a wonder
ful indication of the co-operation of i
the Stanford men with tho women's i
affairs that Mr. O'Donnell should pro
mote a campaign against the present j

lockout system. It will get us nowhere
j to vaguely talk about the abolishment
of lockouts. A definite plan of change
should be considered. The first step,
I think, would be the abolishment of
i
| the signing-out system. People who
have been on the campus for a year
or more know that it has developed
into a perfect farce. One signs out for
! the City if she plans to go any place
between Santa Rosa and Berkeley. If
! one does not want to have to be in at
lockout time she signs out for some
i where overnight. It is an unnecessary
strain on the few families of Stanford
! women living in Palo Alto to have to
keep open hours at all hours of the
night for overnight guests. It is only
| by accident such as the arrival of a
i telegram that anyone neglecting to
sign out at all is followed up.
I The door could be locked at a defi-
I nite time and anyone arriving after
i that would have to ring. Tn Roble the
! bell could be sounded in the social
J secretary's room, as was done three
years ago. Anyone with malicious in
tentions can easily get around the
! rule as it is now and the normal, well-
I meaning woman will bo at liberty to
, change her mind. This would also
' eliminate the entirely unnecessary
j waste of having some older person
j stay up to let people in.
| It would probably be entirely too
much to expect to have lockouts en
' tirely abolished right off the bat, but
, we could begin by abolishing the sign
ing-out and lengthening the time the
women can stay out, at least the upper
' classmen. —One of the 500.

The Editor, Sir:
The realization came as a shock to
me that the women on this campus j
have waited around until one of the
men students brought the fact to their
attention that Ihey are living under a |
supposed self-government, with rules
with which they are far from satisfied
and doing absolutely nothing to im
prove the situation.
Every woman I have conversed with
on the subject has been in favor of a
change, and I feel confident that some
thing definite will come out of the Dull
Session article. I think it is a wonder
ful indication of the co-operation of i
the Stanford men with tho women's i
affairs that Mr. O'Donnell should pro
mote a campaign against the present j

lockout system. It will get us nowhere
j to vaguely talk about the abolishment
of lockouts. A definite plan of change
should be considered. The first step,
I think, would be the abolishment of
