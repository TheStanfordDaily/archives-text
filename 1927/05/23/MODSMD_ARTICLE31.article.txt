The Editor, Sir:
I quote from that fount of knowl
edge, that acme of toleration, that
demon of moderness, so familiar to
every freshman student of this great
and august institution of learning
("where the winds of freedom blow"),
Problems of Citizenship, by Crothers
and Hudnut: "Woman is the mother
of the rare. Her strength is its
strength, her liberty is its liberty, her
progress the progress of humanity.
Can either sex advance to its fullest
development unless each is allowed
the same opportunity, neither sacri
ficed to the other?" This comcs at the
conclusion of approximately seventy
pages of soul-stirring recital of the
wrongs of womankind.
Here at Stanford we hear much of
the school's modernism; much of the
freedom it grants to its students;
much of free thinking and free mov
ing: much of equality.
The recent, additional curtailment,
of the nocturnal activities of this Uni
versity's feminine contingent moves
one to wonder if perhaps Stanford is
•"ailing to practice what it so loudly
•readies. The situation, as it. was be
fore, put the school in a sufficiently
hypocritical light, but this adds insult
'o injury. Surely tlie Stanford Women
are quite as capable of conducting
themselves without, meddling interven
tion as are the Stanford men.
In conclusion, permit, me to con
gratulate the Stanford Daily upon its

stand. Nothing* may come of it, but at j
least some people may be led to do a j
little thinking. —A Mere Man.
