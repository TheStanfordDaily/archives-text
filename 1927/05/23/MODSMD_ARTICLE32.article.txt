The Editor, Sir:
"The semi-culture of the intellect, \
which is all a mere student can lay
claim to, will but help to lead astray j
those who lack the strength of moral
purpose." This thought comes to me
apropos of the ungentlemanly behavior i
on the part of some of the Encina Hall
residents who throw bottles and other :
sundry missiles into the court below, 1
to the annoyance of us less fortunate
ones who inhabit the lower rooms.
It seems to me, in my crude way of j
reasoning, that "if in college the
youth does not learn to govern and j
control himself —to obey and do right
in all things, not because he has not j
the power to disobey and do wrong,
but because he has not the will —noth-
ing else he may learn will be of great
service." Wasn't it Seneca who said:
"now the world is filled with learned
men, good men are wanting"?
