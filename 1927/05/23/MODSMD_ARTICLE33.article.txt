The Editor, Sir:
The reporter who wrote the "Hay"
story in today's issue surely has ab
sorbed enough "agri"-culture from liv
ing on the Farm to know that hay is
not harvested with a dipper.
Since on two occasions, however, he
insists on having the hay "bailed," in
stead of "baled," I reach the conclu
sion that such is not the case. Since
"none has been spoiled by the rain"
the dipper method is decidedly out of
place in an agricultural journal. Hur
rah for crime! â€”A Kansas Farmer.
