"ON THE TRAIL OF THE RUSSIAN
FAMINE." By Frank Alfred Golder
and Lincoln Hutchinson. (Stanford
University Press, 1927.)
For non-fiction, this volume is ex
ceedingly interesting—if you like this
sort of thing: a glorified notebook',
appended by statistics and footnotes
and actual photographs. For profes
sors, the authors have collaborated to
produce a work that is not, like most
lectures, boring to the point of fatigue.
As one earnest freshman naively put
it: they are more like gentlemen than
professors.
Except for the matter of form, the
notes of the two men —Frank A. Gol
der, history professor at. the Univer
sity, and Lincoln Hutchinson, engaged
at present with Golder in research
work in the Russian Revolution —have
been unchanged. These two were sent,
in 1921, as special representatives for
the American Relief Administration
into the famine districts of Russia,
the Ukraine, and the Caucasus. Theirs
is not the usual diary wherein one
gets up at seven, and eats, and goes
places and sees things, and goes to
bed at nine. It is a human account,
obviously expanded and "lecturized'
in places, of their contacts with Rus-

; sians—young and old, rich and poor,
; powerful and downtrodden. It is a
record of their experiences and im
pressions of the new, weak, and
starved Russia of the years following I
the Revolution.
In parts of the book, the descrip
tions are vivid —vivid as only actual
contact with the subjects can make
them. Their interviews with different
; people are actual, and, what is more
unusual, unbiased by the authors' own
opinions of what the Russian political
and social order should be. For the |
j fictionist, it is regrettable that the
human tone has to be dropped at times
j for scientific statistics and discussions.
But, as students of social science,
they have recounted as objectively as j
possible the atmosphere and impres
; sions of the country they saw and of
] the people who lived through the j
, Revolution.
Pedro J. Lemos, curator of the
Museum, designed the cover and the
! end map-sheets. For those who have
a penchant for maps, these will at
once attract attention. They show
I graphically the travels of the authors ion
| on their nine trips from Moscow, and
I are notable for their striking borders !
I and decorations. —J.B.R. j
