# STANFORD AND THE IC4A MEET
## 
### Feg Murray 
Imagine an automobile loaded down
with the best college track teams of
the East. In it are athletes repre
senting Yale, Harvard, Syracuse, Penn
State, Georgetown, Cornell, Pennsyl
vania, and so on. The car is bound
for the annual IC4A track meet, to be
held this next Friday and Saturday
at Franklin Field, Philadelphia. Sud
denly the driver slows down as a huge
sign by the roadside. It reads
"Dangerous Curve Ahead," and the
curve is drawn there below the warn
ing, shaped like a bright red.
In recent years the danger that sign
warned of has proven all too fatal.
The blue and gold "C" of the Univer
sity of California was the curve that
wrecked the Eastern teams in 1921,
1922, and 1923. Yale managed to
navigate the road to victory in 1924,
but the next two years saw the hopes

of the Atlantic seaboard again shat
tered by those dangerous western
curves when Southern California won
in 1925 and 1926. Now, unless all the
dope goes astray, as dope has a habit
of doing occasionally, Stanford Uni
versity should win its first champion
ship at the fifty-first annual meeting
of the Intercollegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America on May
27 and 28.
How are you going to stop 'em,
those red-skirted, bronzed youths,
whom Dink Templeton, youngest of
track mentors, has gathered together
out on the "farm" where Senator Le
land Stanford raised his famous trot
ters and pacers? The Cardinals from
Palo Alto beat the University of Cal
ifornia worse than the St. Louis Cards
beat the Yankees, and followed this
up by a 75 to 56 victory over IT. S. C.
Look over these names, with the

j records that each has made, and see
j if you can figure how any team, even
j Dean Cromwell's doughty Trojans,
j can keep the Stanford boys from pil
. ing up close to forty points:
j "Biff" Hoffman, two sure first places
1 in the weights, with his shot-put and
j discus-throw records of 49 feet, 8%
j inches and 153 feet, I*4 inches, respec
tively; Ross Nichols, high hurdles in
; 14:4-5 seconds; Clarence West, low
! hurdles in 24:1-5 seconds. (West
I placed second in the "highs" to Dye
| last year, and fourth in the "lows." He
has run the high hurdles in 15 sec
' onds.)
Then there are Emerson Spencer,
holder of the Pacific Coast record of
j 47:4-5 for the 440-yard dash; Bob King,
[ who last, year won the high jump in
the 1.C.-4A. meet with a mark of 6
feet, 5% inches and who this year has
I jumped G feet GVi inches; Tom Work,

6 feet, inches in the high jump;
Kim Dyer, broad jump, 24 feet, 3 3-8
inches; Fred Zombro, broad jump, 24
feet, 5% inches; Sid Meeks, broad
jump, 23 feet, inches; Ward Ed
monds, 13 feet in the pole-vault; Tom
Joaquin, 195 feet, 9 inches in the
javelin throw.
Oh yes, Templeton also has a good
sprinter and a fair miler, but he's often
told me that held event men and
hurdlers stand the trip from the coast
best. It appears that be has these in
quality as well as quantity.
