# CAST FOR SENIOR FARCE IS SHIFTED AFTER REHEARSAL
## Roles Changed to Stress Character Types for Production 
### 
As the result of further critical
analysis and reading of "Mrs. Part
ridge Presents" on the part of both
Gordon Davis and the cast, a partial
shifting of roles was decided upon as
making it easier to produce this play,
which particularly demands type char
acterizations.
Mrs. Partridge will be played by
Elizabeth Wilbur, while Sarah Mar
garet Burns has been shifted from the
title role of the ingenue lead, Delight
Partridge. Elizabeth Wilbur is known
to campus dranfatics through her
work in "The Dover Road" and the
two Greek plays, "Oedipus Rex" and
"Agamemnon," taking the part of
Clytemnestra in the latter; and more
recently as Lady Frinton in "Aren't
We All?" She also played Lady
Blanche in "Princess Ida."
Katherine Everett, the comedy role,
will be played by Edwina Ewiug,
rather than by Velma Randall, who
found herself unable to continue with
the play. Edwina Ewing made her
initial appearance as Mrs. Wilson in
the sophomore play, "The Book of
Charm." She has since taken the part
of Symphorosa in "The Swan."
The two minor male parts which re
main to be cast are still undecided, and
will not be chosen until later. Othei*-
wise the present arrangements will
probably be permanent, and rehearsals
are under way.
