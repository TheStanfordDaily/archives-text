# STUDENT HUT MIS TODAY ON NEW RULES
## Only Provisions Favored by Public Opinion Altered By Committee ELECTION BOARD CHOSEN Voting Will Take Place on Quad for Revised Constitution 
### 
Marking an important development
in student body government, a new
constitution, the result of months of
investigation, is submitted today for
the approval of the A.S.S.U.
Carolyn Shepard has been appointed
chairman of the special election board,
■which consists of Ruth Mason, Robert
Fraser, Robert Mclnnes, and Winston
Norman. The polls at the Law Steps
and the Classical Languages building
are to be open from 8:30 o'clock to
12, and from 1 to 2 o'clock.
Committee Confident
Members of the revision committee
are confident that the measure will
pass, basing their belief on the fact
that they have changed, dropped, and
added only such provisions that public
opinion desired changed, dropped, or
added.
The charter system, which is inau
gurated in the fields of dramatics,
journalism, debate, and rallies, has
cut the old constitution to nearly one
half its present size. The charters will
serve to protect the A.S.S.U., not in
every possible case, but in such situa
tions that are likely to happen.
No Objections Foreseen
"As far as I know," said Robert
Littler, chairman of the revision com
mittee, "there are no objections to
any of the provisions in the new draft.
Each article covering each activity
was taken up with those interested
in the activity. In a few cases, they
made suggestions which we were un
able to follow, but an understanding
was reached in each case. If there are
any provisions in the new constitution
that are considered unsatisfactory, I
am sure we have heard nothing about
it."
