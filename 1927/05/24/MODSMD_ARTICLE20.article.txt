# FORMER REGISTRAR TO SPEAK TONIGHT ON FASCIST ITALY
## Dr. Orrin L. Elliott Believes Mussolini Influenced By Machiaveili 
### 
Endeavoring to explain clearly the
present situation in Italy, Dr. Orrin L.
Elliott, registrar emeritus, will speak
011 "Italy and Fascismo" at 7:30
o'clock this evening in the Little
Theatre. He will trace the rise of
Mussolini following the World War,
the Fascisti struggle with the "red"
elements, and the prospects for Italy's
future.
Dr. Elliott, recently returned from
a trip to Europe, believes that Musso
lini's ideas have been moulded by the
writings of Nietzsche, Machiavelli,
and Mazzini, curiously blended with
the hard experiences of the post-war
reaction that swept Italy. The Fascisti
state implies a reversal of the princi
ple of democracy, in Elliott's opinion,
and exalts patriotism to the nth de
gree.
Several weeks ago Dr. Elliott ad
dressed the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce on the same subject. At
this time the former registrar stated
that Mussolini has modernized his
country within the last five years, and
that the Italians look to him as their
political saviour. Mussolini, however
patriotic his ideals may be, intends to
run the government himself, Elliott
believes. The duce's theory is that the
people should be governed not by
kings or presidents, but by men who
have proved themselves capable for
the work.
