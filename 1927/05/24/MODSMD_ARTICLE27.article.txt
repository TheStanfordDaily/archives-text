### JOE CARROLL 
Templeton is still very weak but is
able to get around slowly. His rapid
comeback should act as a great spur
upon the Stanford men who will com
pete for the Cardinal Friday and Sat
urday.
Templeton's journey Eastward
should be well repaid by the showing
that his weight star will make under
his expert coaching. The strength of
this year's squad lies in the men who
heave the shot, hurl the discus, throw
the javelin, pole vault, broad jump,
and high jump. Templeton will be of
invaluable assistance to these men
when they go up against the stiff com
petition that they will face this week
end.
Some Injuries
Biff Hoffman had a severe cold when
he left; A1 Forster has a finger that
is tightly bandaged; Bob King and
Ross Nichols are recuperating from
sojourns in the hospital.
When it is remembered that Dink
himself won a second place in the
high jump and a third place in the
broad jump at the 1.C.-4A. during his
last year of competition, one can eas
ily see that he will be able to give
his men the last bit of advice that
will mean the difference between
winning and losing an event.
Faith in Field Events
The faith that Templeton has in his
field event stars is well shown by the
number of men in the different events
that are at present on their way East.
