# Two Mile Race Ignored
## 
### 
For years California and Stanford have been turning out great teams,
frequently the best in the country. Southern California has risen recently
to the great heights of the Cardinals and Bears. No matter what the
East or the Middlewest may turn out, it is a certainty that the three great
track schools of the Golden State will be just as strong, and generally
a little bit stronger, than any other three teams in a given section.
Sprinters and hurdlers of front rank seem to thrive on the coast; the
middle distance men are of front rank, although the long trip to the
Eastern intercollegiate meet at Cambridge or Philadelphia, or the national
meet at Chicago has often dulled their form.
In the field events, the three great California teams rule supreme.
Their weight throwers, jumpers, and vaulters are in midseason form in
March while the Eastern and Middlewestern athletes are still cooped up
in gymnasiums.
The shot putters may hit 49 feet in the coast meets, the discus boys
will be over the 150 foot mark, there will be great high jumpers, pole
vaulters, javelin throwers, and broad jumpers, the sprinters will nearly
always beat :10, the hurdlers are usually under : 15, and the middle dis
tance men in the 440 and SBO have nothing to be ashamed of.
Whenever California, Stanford, and Southern California hook up in
a dual meet there is certain to be a staggering class of performances,
except in two events, the mile and the two mile. This year there are
several great niilers on the coast, including McKiunon of Stanford,
Unruh of Southern California, Scovel of Occidental, and Sclnvobeda of
California, and to move into the Northwest, there are Clayton of Oregon
State College and Divine of Washington State College.
But the two mile on the coast is terrible. Seldom do the best men
from the three great California track schools beat 10:00, and a 9:45 is
almost a miracle, while in the East and Middlewest there are always
several 9:30 men in a season and it is a poor dual meet in which some
man does not step under 9 :50.
It isn't only this season, but is true every year. In every event
except the two mile, the coast bows to no section, but in the long race
they don't even reach first base.
It is all rather difficult to understand. The climate is offered as the
reason, but that hardly seems to satisfy. There seem to be two better
reasons for the total eclipse of the Far Western two milers. In the first
place, cross country running is an undeveloped sport on the coast —and
that is where two mile stars are developed. And secondly, the California
state two milers don't often beat 9:50 because they are not forced to do so.
The coast teams seem to have acquired the ten minute complex, and they
won't get over it until some 9 :30 runner happens along to force the pace.
