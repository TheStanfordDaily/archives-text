Jt is asking a great deal from students to request them to vote twice
in as many weeks, but the Daily, with all the confidence in the world,
is asking Stanford men and women to vote for the new constitution
tomorrow, and then, after resting seven days, to go to the polls again
and cast a ballot for the officers for next year.
One of the most esential pieces of furniture to be found in every
newspaper's office is a bakers' dozen of canned editorials to be used for
all occasions. There is the "Welcome" editorial for the first paper of
the quarter; there is the "Thanksgiving" editorial; and the "Christmas"
editorial; and the "Study for Finals" editorial; and many others. But
the one that is used most frequently is the "Election" editorial.
So to refrain from boring our gentle readers we will refer you to
the edition of the paper last year at this time. In that paper is an
editorial which speaks about the duty of students to get out and vote,
and many other trite expressions. But, if you go to the trouble of
voting today, be sure to cast your ballot in favor of the new constitution.
For that matter we do not care how many walk to the polls today, as
long as those that do vote know what they are voting for. We feel
assured that if they know the issue, the old constitution will quietly pass
away this afternoon.
