After months of brute labor the con
stitutional revision committee is pre
senting for student body approval a
new and simplified version of the con
stitution. The changes that have been
made are largely those which tend to
improve the governmental machinery
of the student body. Only in a very
few instances have any actual changes
been made in the provisions of the
various articles. And in these in
stances the changes in question were
made with the hearty approval of the
parties directly affected.
The committee is to be congratu
lated on its work. For that matter all
committees are always congratulated
on their work. In this case, however,
the praise has been earned a number
of times over. Without recompense
the committee members have given
their time to a task that at best must
have been boring. They approached
the matter with a degree of honesty
and vigor that cannot be too highly
commended.
Their meritorious attitude toward

j their work is reflected in the finished
i product. The new constitution pro
t vides that any amount of irrelevant
j detail be left out of the body of the
|-constitution; so that it will no longer
be necessary to call a special Quad
; election two or three times a year to
settle some matter that is not of gen
j eral importance or interest.
Need it be added that one should
vote for the new constitution? Cer
( tainly everyone who votes at all will
J vote for it. Only one point, therefore,
j remains to be raised in this article,
j Since the new constitution is there-
I suit of a year of conscientious en-
I deavor and since it has been created
I after seeking the advice of anyone
who might be presumed to be able
: to offer constructive suggestions and
since its originators have worked
' long, hard, and intelligently it is only
: fitting that they be rewarded by such
a turnout as will convince them that
I they have not been working on behalf
I of a lot of uninterested Dodos.
