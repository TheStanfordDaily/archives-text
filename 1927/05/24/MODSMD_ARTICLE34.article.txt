Luther Burbank with Wilbur Hall.
(Houghton, Mifflin Co., Boston and
New York. 1927. $4.00).
For those who think that biography
should be a factual record of dates
and events, or a treasury stocked with
spicy anecdotes, "The Harvest of the
Years" will fall far short. But for
those who seek in the life-story of a
man a picture of his personality, this
study of Luther Burbank, compiled by
himself and Wilbur Hall from a mass
of journals, notebooks, and letters,
should be nearly perfect.
Mr. Burbank is a figure of interna
tional reputation gained through his
experiments in plant-breeding. In the
course of the fifty-odd years devoted
to what he affectionately calls his
"profession," he developed thousands
of absolutely new species, including
flowers, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and
such miscellany as the spineless cac
tus, which he himself, by the way, con
siders his most important single
achievement. His occupation gained
for him the title of "The Plant
Wizard," which he resented bitterly,
contending that his almost miraculous
results were no magic, but the product
of applied scientific methods, infinite
experimentation, and a great deal of
hard, physical labor.
"The Harvest of the Years" tells
the story of several of the most inter
esting of Burbank's developments, be
ginning with the Burbank potato, and
including a new plum, the Shasta
Daisy, a pea created to meet the re
quirements of the canneries, and the
spineless cactus. It is in the discussion
of this latter that the scientific inter
est of the book finds its most precise
expression, although it permeates the
whole.
In short, Burbank believes that
heredity and environment are but two
aspects of the same force, that here

j dity is the "sum of all past environ
| ments," thus affirming categorically
I the inheritance of acquired character
i istics, which is a moot point with all
i biologists. Through "reptition, repeti
! tion, repetition," any given character
istic or group of characteristics, of
which the organism is capable can be
j fastened upon it so firmly that they
will become a part of its inheritance,
and it will continue to breed true.
This belief was the basis of Mr. Bur
bank's methods of work, and certainly
I he appears to have offered undeniable
! empirical evidence of its truths. Con
| centrated, controlled, and selective en-
I vironment was the scientific law at
I the bottom of his plant creations.
These same rules he applies to his
| theories of humanity, and through
j them also works out his philosophy of
life. To illustrate a single point, he
j declares that influence is the source
I of immortality. "It is the one sure,
certain, permanent, eternal thing we
i can know anything about," he says,
.... and "without it we should be
cells swimming in salt water today."
j Life is not a substance, but a force,
| working always in two directions,
! positive and constructive, negative or
destructive. It is within the power of
each individual to co-operate with
either side he chooses, and through
the exercise of influence to become
"ephemeral, inconsequential," or to
j "sing through the years."
Certainly Luther Burbank has lived
up to his ,own philosophy in its fullest
degree, and this story of his life gives
us the tale of how he did it as well as
j a portrait of a keen, unusual, and in
telligence; a personality kindly and
tolerant and sincere, and, to give it
i humanity, just a little hit garrulous.
The book should be of special in
terest to Stanford people because of
! the friendship between Mr. Burbank

and Dr. Jordan, and because Burbank
once gave a course of lectures here.
Also, Wilbur Hall, co-author who con
tinued the record after Mr. Burbank's
death, was director of the Fiesta last
spring. Incidentally, he has done an
excellent job of his collaboration, for
so completely has he become saturated
with the style and manner of his sub- ]
ject that one cannot pick out the parts I
which he finished independently.
