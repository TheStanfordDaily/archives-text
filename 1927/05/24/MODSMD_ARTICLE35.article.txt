TO WOMEN
When they tip their hats and smile,
When they sit and chat awhile,
They only want to be polite,
You know they do not want to slight;
But when they slip their arms around
you,
Whispering, "At last I've found you."
Then beware —they're men of purpose.
TO MEN
When they poke you in the ribs,
Saying gaily, "How's his Nibbs!"
Then you know they're only kiddin',
You can tell they're only boobin';
But when they poke you with a gat,
And say, "Hands up!" and all of that.
Then beware—they're men of purpose.

If Encina and Toyon and Branner,
Sequoia, the Row, and the rest,
Housed two thousand five hundred
women,
And Rob'e held five hundred men;
What a gosh awful place this would
be for the women,
But oh, what a heaven for men!

CA( bbages OPINION COLUMN
Dear Cabbages:
I don't quite know what this is all
about but I'm sure if the Dean and i
Council have any reasons they have
to keep secret they must be awfully
good ones.
I think it is perfectly all right that
the men should be locked in the halls j
at sunset. Otherwise what hope is
there for mankind, which would ■
promptly go to the bow-wows. Surely
the Dean can think of other good rea
sons, too.
There isn't anything that can keep
me from being a proud and satisfied —
Stanford Fawther.
