# LINDBERGH'S FLIGHT HAS NO IMMEDIATE TRADE ADVANATGES
## Lesley Points Out Poor Economics of Cross Atlantic Flight 
### 
"Although the feat of flying from
New York to Paris was a great per
sonal achievement for Captain Charles
Lindbergh, it does not presage any
commercial possibilities within the
next decade." Such is the opinion ex
pressed by Professor Emeritus Wil
liam Frederick Durand, member of the
National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, and Professor Everett
I'arker Lesley, director of the recently
endowed Guggenheim Aerodynamic
Laboratory.
Air Lines Foreseen
"We may expect transatlantic air
lines eventually," said Dr. Durand,
"but 1 anticipate the use of lighter
than-air ships, rather than the heavier
than-air machine."
Professor Lesley, in commenting on
the flight, also brought out the eco
nomic inefficiency of running air
planes across the Atlantic. "One of
the unsolved problems of aviation to
day," he explained, "is to make a craft
that will carry fuel enough for long
trips and still be able to carry a
cargo. The fact precludes the use of
present airplanes for transatlantic
flights on any commercial basis. Lind
bergh could have taken one passenger
at the most.
Praises French
"The sportsmanship of the French
people in their enthusiastic reception
of Lindbergh, after the reported ani
mosity toward American attempts im
mediately following the French disas
ter, is noteworthy," Professor Lesley
continued. "The personal bravery of a
lone man staking everything in a
single motor and his own ability to
keep awake overcame any adverse
feelings toward foreign competitors."
The plane used by Lindbergh was a
slightly modified Ryan Monoplane
equipped with the Wright Whirlwind
motor, both recent developments.
