Fencing is now being advocated as
a cure-all by Melvin Williamson, in
structor in the University of Texas.
"One of the most notable cases," he
says, "was that of a boy who had a
very bad case of rheumatism when
he entered the university. When he
flrst became interested in fencing, he
had to handle his sword while sitting
in a chair.
"After a while he was able to walk
on crutches. Finally he threw away
the crutches and got a cane. Mean
while he was developing into an ex
cellent fencer. Now he is almost
cured of rheumatism and is, in
cidentally, an assistant in the sport
he likes."
