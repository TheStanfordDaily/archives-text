# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Take a look at the elongated face
of Mr. William Tatem Tilden, 2nd, of
Philadelphia. Here he is, a king with
out a crown, yet a dethroned monarch
brave and game enough to go to the
home courts of his rivals —to seek the
lions in their own lairs, as it were —
rather than wait until they come to
him at home.
The preliminary skirmishes with
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and
France now being out of the way, Big
Bill is face to face with the first of
the four chief objectives that caused
him to give up the drama and movies
and go into intensive training last
winter. The French hard court cham
pionships, which begin tomorrow, the
Wimbledon tournament, from June 20
to July 2; the defense of the Davis

Bonne Chance, M. Bill!

I Cup at Philadelphia, and the United
States national singles championships
! in September are the four major ac
i tions in which the play of the former
1 champion will be watched with the
greatest interest by tennis followers
| the world over.
In u conversation the other day with
Mr. Sam Hardy, a former United
States Davis Cup captain, I learned
several interesting things about Bill
Tilden's campaign. In the first place,
there is no question about Long Wil
| liam's "coming back," except in ac
tually regaining his singles title. He
' was playing as well as he ever did
at the time he sailed, and if his knee
holds up he should win all three
I singles championships—French, Eng
| lish, and American. At Wimbledon he

will play in the mixed doubles with
Mrs. Molla Mallory, instead of with
Helen Wills. Tilden paired with "Lit
tle Miss Poker Face" would be a very
popular—and probably winning—com-
bination, but Tilden prefers to play
with the Norse girl.
I asked Mr. Hardy what player he
thought had the best forehand, back
hand, serve, volley, lob, and so forth.
His reply was most interesting. "Til
den's best shots," he said, "are better
than those of any other player in the
world. That is, when he wants to, and
is on his game, he can outdrive John
ston with his forehand, LaCoste with
his backhand, out chop Wallace John
son, outvolley Richards, and outserve
Dick Williams."
Aud, it seems, since he is keener
for tennis than ever before, and he
has embarked on this campaign as the
"great adventure of his tennis lite,"
that quite likely he will want to out
play everybody he meets in every
way.

hand, serve, volley, lob, and so forth.
His reply was most interesting. "Til
den's best shots," he said, "are better
than those of any other player in the
world. That is, when he wants to, and
is on his game, he can outdrive John
ston with his forehand, LaCoste with
his backhand, out chop Wallace John
son, outvolley Richards, and outserve
Dick Williams."
Aud, it seems, since he is keener
for tennis than ever before, and he
has embarked on this campaign as the
"great adventure of his tennis lite,"
that quite likely he will want to out
play everybody he meets in every
way.

Take a look at the elongated face
of Mr. William Tatem Tilden, 2nd, of
Philadelphia. Here he is, a king with
out a crown, yet a dethroned monarch
brave and game enough to go to the
home courts of his rivals —to seek the
lions in their own lairs, as it were —
rather than wait until they come to
him at home.
The preliminary skirmishes with
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and
France now being out of the way, Big
Bill is face to face with the first of
the four chief objectives that caused
him to give up the drama and movies
and go into intensive training last
winter. The French hard court cham
pionships, which begin tomorrow, the
Wimbledon tournament, from June 20
to July 2; the defense of the Davis

Bonne Chance, M. Bill!

I Cup at Philadelphia, and the United
States national singles championships
! in September are the four major ac
i tions in which the play of the former
1 champion will be watched with the
greatest interest by tennis followers
| the world over.
In u conversation the other day with
Mr. Sam Hardy, a former United
States Davis Cup captain, I learned
several interesting things about Bill
Tilden's campaign. In the first place,
there is no question about Long Wil
| liam's "coming back," except in ac
tually regaining his singles title. He
' was playing as well as he ever did
at the time he sailed, and if his knee
holds up he should win all three
I singles championships—French, Eng
| lish, and American. At Wimbledon he

will play in the mixed doubles with
Mrs. Molla Mallory, instead of with
Helen Wills. Tilden paired with "Lit
tle Miss Poker Face" would be a very
popular—and probably winning—com-
bination, but Tilden prefers to play
with the Norse girl.
I asked Mr. Hardy what player he
thought had the best forehand, back
hand, serve, volley, lob, and so forth.
His reply was most interesting. "Til
den's best shots," he said, "are better
than those of any other player in the
world. That is, when he wants to, and
is on his game, he can outdrive John
ston with his forehand, LaCoste with
his backhand, out chop Wallace John
