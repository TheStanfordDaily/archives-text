CHICAGO, 111., May 24.—The
Stanford track team worked out
this morning on the Stagg Field;
a real bright California morning.
Hoffman made six puts. One forty
nine feet one inch, one forty-nine
feet three inches. Al Forster put
forty-eight feet seven inches;
Fleishhacker, forty-six feet six
inches; Stewart Way, forty-six
feet. Men are in fine shape. Wire
received from Hon. H. C. Hoover
stating that President Coolidge
would meet the track team Thurs
day noon in Washington for a
group picture. Needless to say this
appointment will surely be kept.
OMAHA, Neb., May 23.—The
team had a splendid workout to
night at Omaha. Biff Hoffman is
trying to throw the discus out of
one state into the other. Ross
Nichol's physical condition is much
improved. Bob King's back is now
well. Tom Work remarked that he
feels the old pep coming back to
his legs.
The team sent a wire to Gene
Tunney inviting him to be our
guest at the meet Saturday. We
hope that Dink is progressing
nicely. We miss him. The boys
will present both Dink and Stan
ford with a championship Satur
day.
