## 
### 
As a substitute speaker for Count
Felix von Luckner, who late Monday
night sent word that he would be un
able to address the annual Cosmopoli
tan banquet last night because of his
wife's illness, Captain A. I. Eagle of
the Crissy Field Air Corps at San
Francisco gave the main address of
the evening, stressing particularly the
important part aviation has played in
unifying the world.
Captain Eagle stated the position
which army men have taken in regard
to peace moves. "The American army
will welcome peace," he said. "At
present they desire only to carry out
the United States' policies, and at
present the United States wants to
disarm the rest of the world. I believe
the time is coming when we won't
have to preserve peace by arms."
Dr. Jordan talked informally. His
main point was that "in every country
you'll find young people doing very
much the same as you in this club
are doing, though perhaps in a differ
ent way."
