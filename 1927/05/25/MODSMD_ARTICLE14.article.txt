# Davis Announces New Presentation For Senior Farce
## 
### 
Permission was granted Gordon
Davis, director of dramatics, in a wire
received yesterday from New York, to
produce "So This Is London," a com
edy in three acts, by Arthur Goodrich,
for the Senior Farce on June 15.
Although casting for "Mrs. Partridge
Presents," the proposed farce, had
been completed and rehearsals had
been conducted for several days, Davis
believes that the new play will be
more successful for a campus produc
tion. "Mrs. Partridge Presents," in
being only a light comedy, is not
strictly a farce, as is "So This Is Lon
don."
The entire work of casting will not
be gone through again, for wherever
possible, parts will be filled by those
who have been cast in "Mrs. Partridge
Presents." For those roles which are
not filled in that way, the characters
will be chosen from those who previ
ously tried out for the Kennedy-Haw
thorne play. Rehearsals will begin al
most immediately, and little incon
venience will result from the loss of
time.
The story of the new play is rich
in action, mainly more or less comic,
but at times deepening into sentiment
or drama, when the feeling between
parents and children and the relations
between the lovers are involved. The
play, which embodies the idea of in
ternational understandings, is termed
authentic in its representation of vari
ous types of English and American
character. Successful from its first
night, it has won general favor during
its long run in New York.
