# PRIZES TO BE GIVEN FOR ALL EVENTS OF R.O.T.C. HORSE SHOW
## 
### 
With the date of the Eighth Annual
R.O.T.C. Horse Show two days off,
final plans are rapidly being completed,
Lieutenant Charles S. Whitmore
stated last night. Prizes for first three
places in every event which have been
received from Palo Alto and San Fran
cisco merchants will not be announced
until presented to the winners Friday
afternoon, Whitmore said.
The steeplechase bids to be the most
interesting event of the show with
nineteen entries in it so far. The
jumps, eight in all, will be from three
to three and one-half feet high and
fifteen feet in width. The handicap
jumps will be constructed of brush,
barrels, bales of hay stood on end, and
rails. There will be plenty of room
from the starting line to the first
obstacle, Lieutenant Whitmore de
clared. One of the criticisms of the
race last year was that there was not
enough room between the first jump
and the starting point to enable the
horses to be spread out, but this will
be remedied, he said.
Besides the steeplechase, an arch
ery contest with cadets shooting from
running horses seems popular from
the number of entries scheduled to
take part in it. Other events include
the half-mile race, military jumping,
horsemanship contest, mounted tug-of
war, mounted wrestling match, Roman
race, Cossack race, and potato and
spoon race.
This is the first year that women
will be allowed to participate in the
show and only members of the wo
men's equitation class are eligible to
take part. There will be three events
for them, the ladies' musical chair con
test, ladies' horsemanship contest, and
the potato and spoon race.
