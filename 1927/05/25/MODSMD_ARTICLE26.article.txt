# Time for Action
## 
### 
Time for action on women's social regulations seems at hand with the
sentiment at Roble Ilall in favor of considering and acting upon thfse
issues during the present quarter. Women's Conference, the legislative
body, meets tonight and suggestions for changes in the present social
rules will be submitted by women at large at that time.
It has been pointed out that since little time remains before the close
of the quarter it is inadvisable to consider changes in the lockout system.
When we recall that it has been assumed that there is sufficient time this
quarter to take up the question of winter quarter rushing, we can hardly
agree that the time is too short to take some definite action on the matter
of social regulations, for surely the women are as capable of considering
one problem as the other or of considering two problems during the same
period.
If there is an atmosphere of excitement and hurry, it is the women
themselves that have created this attitude. It is certainly a reflection upon
their mental stability, an intimation which they should attempt to prove
false by taking up the question of social regulations at the present time.
Moreover, i is highly inconceivable that the women of this University
have not been considering the present social regulations as long as such
rules have been in existence and as long as these women have been in the
University. The innumerable bull sessions held quarterly on this subject
are proof that the matter is ever under consideration with the women.
Though Women's Conference has not as yet signified its inability
because of lack of time to formulate new regulations, it is to be hoped
that this body with the aid of suggestions which will be submitted today
will find sufficient time during this week to draw up several alternative
rules and regulations for each of the phases of the problem such as hours
of return and rules governing signing out.
Each alternative plan for each phase of the problem should be placed
upon a ballot for a straw vote by all women. Following this vote, which
must be held next week, the proposals for each specific phase of the
problem receiving the most support should be combined into a set of
regulations to be submitted for the approval or disapproval of President
Wilbur.
If in view of the fact that Conference membership is changing (due
to new elections) it is impossible to make final decisions on the social
regulation problem, then at least Conference should immediately appoint
a committee to draw up and present to the women before the end of the
quarter regulations which are to be voted upon at the beginning of
fall quarter.

quarter to take up the question of winter quarter rushing, we can hardly
agree that the time is too short to take some definite action on the matter
of social regulations, for surely the women are as capable of considering
one problem as the other or of considering two problems during the same
period.
If there is an atmosphere of excitement and hurry, it is the women
themselves that have created this attitude. It is certainly a reflection upon
their mental stability, an intimation which they should attempt to prove
false by taking up the question of social regulations at the present time.
Moreover, i is highly inconceivable that the women of this University
have not been considering the present social regulations as long as such
rules have been in existence and as long as these women have been in the
University. The innumerable bull sessions held quarterly on this subject
are proof that the matter is ever under consideration with the women.
Though Women's Conference has not as yet signified its inability
because of lack of time to formulate new regulations, it is to be hoped
that this body with the aid of suggestions which will be submitted today
will find sufficient time during this week to draw up several alternative
rules and regulations for each of the phases of the problem such as hours
of return and rules governing signing out.
Each alternative plan for each phase of the problem should be placed
upon a ballot for a straw vote by all women. Following this vote, which
must be held next week, the proposals for each specific phase of the
problem receiving the most support should be combined into a set of
regulations to be submitted for the approval or disapproval of President
Wilbur.
If in view of the fact that Conference membership is changing (due
to new elections) it is impossible to make final decisions on the social
regulation problem, then at least Conference should immediately appoint
a committee to draw up and present to the women before the end of the
quarter regulations which are to be voted upon at the beginning of
fall quarter.
