# Athletes and Business
## 
### 
Floyd A. Rowe, Michigan track captain in 1908, and now director
of physical welfare in the Cleveland public schools, condemns the attitude
of the average college professor in looking down on the college athlete.
He says that athletes get good average grades. From a personal investi
gation, in which he looked up the records of 1000 Michigan graduates,
Rowe found that in 500 letter men there was a far greater number of
successful business men than in an equal number of graduates who wore
Phi Beta Kappa keys.
Rowe is correct in his conclusions, and the reason that athletes do
succeed because they obtained something on the athletic field that can
he learned in no phase of college life. A football man learns that
when he is in a football game, he is a very important part of a great
machine. He receives the feeling of responsibility, and of importance.
When he fails to do his share in the working of a football play, he sees
the formation fail, and he is immediately taken from the game. If he
fails, the team fails.
Rowe thinks that athletics help a man to suceed in business because
the athlete must think quickly and clearly. But the discipline and the
training that a man receives in a game is of equal importance. If a man
is to succeed in football, he must demonstrate his ability. There is no
apple polishing with coaches. Ability and willingness are the prerequi
sites for "A" grades on athletic fields.
