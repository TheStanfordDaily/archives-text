CAUTION
Yesterday the dean of women ad
jured the women of the University to
exercise caution in approaching the
problem of altering the lockout rules.
Her advice in a limited sense is very
much to the point.
As has been pointed out in this
column the lockout rules are only the
local phase of a condition that pre
vails throughout the country and that
has at one time or another prevailed
throughout the larger part of the
civilized world. It is not to be expected
or desired that the women should rush
pell-mell into any hasty action that
might result in a too sudden adjust
ment of a situation to which they have
become thoroughly acustomed by their
training.
However, this does not alter the fact
that the present lockout rules are
wholly undesirable and that they fail
utterly to meet the conditions of mod
ern life. Because they are so deeply
rooted in the tradition of university

life it is hard to bring about a change
in them. Just at this time, however,
a certain amount of interest has been
stirred up in the subject. The women
would be foolish to allow this moment
to pass without taking advantage of
the fact that they now have a certain
psychological advantage.

QUERY
In all due seriousness, could we in
quire just what was in the minds of
the thirty-six benighted individuals
who voted against the new constitu
tion?
After a year of intensive effort, the
special committee appointed for the
task succeeded in revising that con
stitution to the point where it was
improved measurably in a mechanical
sense without altering its provisions.
If thirty-six persons are murdered in
cold blood as they lie in their little
cots tonight, it is our sincere wish
that every member of the constitu
tional committee be allowed to go scot
free. They are only human.
