To the Editor: I
Since the gratifying success of my i
last letter, in which I pleaded for in- ,
telligent plays, I have foregone the
pleasure of writing the Daily because
I have been too busy going to the
Shanghai Gesture. However, pleased
as I am that we are now presenting
better plays, I must protest against the
connotations that, in some miraculous
manner, have been derived from the j
bombast issuing from"A Mere Man" j
in Monday's Daily. The author of the
epistle succeeded in making his work
so vital, so pleasing to the ear, so j
utterly desirable, that I am being sus- .
pected of having written it. The odd
part of the story is, that I did NOT
write it; raving a meager claim to
pride I wish therefore to enter my

protest against libel to the contrary.
But, since people seem to desire that
I decry something, I'm more than
willing to utter a final, feeble whisper
against Encina food. It continues on
the rapid decline. The year's best joke
was the article written by a Daily re
porter (who wisely did not sign his
name to the article) who professed to
have eaten at Encina. Waving a pen
and crying wildly, "I don't see any
thing wrong," he proceeded to make
out Encinaites as being a pack of in
discriminate idiots. If Daily reporters
thrive so well on the preparations
served in Encina, I suggest that they
kindly change places with the weary
freshmen, whose stomachs are already
sadly and irreparably damaged.
