# TWO GROUPS STUDY MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 35 STUDENTS ARE REGISTERED IN DEPARTMENT MANY GRADUATES OF SCHOOL BECOME PROMINENT

Mechanical engineering at Stanford
is now composed of two groups, those J
students finishing up the old four-year i
departmental curriculum, and those ;
who will enroll for graduate study j
after receiving their A.B. degree from
the School of Engineering. In detail
ing the important facts about his de
partment, Professor Arthur B. Domo
noske says:
"It is extremely hard to state just I
what the prospects of the graduates
of our department will be. Employ
ment depends on the condition of the
financial market for those men who
intend to engage in construction work.
Monetary remuneration depends on
the type of man; usually the purely
technical man interested in the de
tails of design does not advance as far
as the more commercial type of man.
No one can say, however, that the
purely technical but lesser paid indi
vidual is of smaller service to the
community or to his employer."
Stanford Staff Notable
At the present time there are thirty
five students majoring in mechanical
engineering. The teaching staff, in
cluding four professors, three associ- ,
ate professors, three assistant profes- ,
sors, and three teaching specialists, 1
boasts some of the most noted men in I
the United States.
Although there are no women regis
tered now, there is no question as to
whether women can pass in mechani
cal engineering, says Professor Domo
noske. "Two women have graduated
from the University of California, one
in civil and the other in electrical
engineering. They are somewhat han
dicapped due to their environment
which precludes much knowledge of
machinery and mechanical processes
before entering colleges.
"On the other hand, we must re
member that many men are taking
engineering who have had but little
more contact with machinery than the
average girl. On graduation women
would probably find their field of ac-!
tivity limited to the clerical and draft- !
ing room."

Among the better known graduates
of the mechanical engineering depart
ment at Stanford are: *
R. E. Maynard, '94, vice-president of
the General Petroleum Corporation;
D. S. Kimball, '96, Dean of the College
of Engineering at Cornell University;
N. A. Carle, '98, vice-president of the
Public Service Corporation of New
Jersey; L. E. Schulz, '05, project en
gineer of du Pont de Namours & Com
pany; C. F. Braun, '07, president of
C. F. Braun & Company; W. W. Jour
din, 'OS, consulting engineer for the
Anaconda Copper Mining Company;
C. Breer, '09, executive engineer for
the Chrysler Corporation; J. I. Thomp
son, '09, vice-president of the Koppers
Construction Company; H. H. Blee,
'10, senior business specialist for the
Aeronautics Branch of the Department
of Commerce; and W. R. Finney, '13,
superintendent of the Midwest Refin
ing Company.
"The field of employment is broad,"
explains Professor Domonoske, "since
motive power apparatus, transmission
of power, and the manufacture and
maintenance of machinery must be
common to all fields of engineering en
deavor whether they be civil, elec
trical, mining, or industrial engineer
ing. However, there is no fixed line of
demarcation between the above fields,
and a civil engineer may be in charge
of the work usually delegated to the
mechanical engineer, or the reverse
may be true."
