# UNITED STATES LED BY FRANCE IN NOVEL DEVELOPMENT-CLAIM
## 
### 
"France is ahead of the United
States in the development of the novel
by a matter of a quarter of a cen
tury," stated M. E. Coindreau in an
interview published in the Daily
Princetonian recently.
"Many of the recent American nov
els," he said, "are similar in tone to
those which created a stir in France
some twenty-five years aÂ£o. For in
stance, take 'Elmer Gantry.' While it
is not without merit and is excellently
written in spots, no French author
would even think of writing such a
book today."
On being asked what the conditions
were which gave the French an ad
vantage over the American authors,
M. Coindreau replied: "The attitude of
the Frenchman toward literature gives
the author greater freedom. You see,
there is no longer any attempt at cen
sorship in France, which proves that
the French are, as I have said, more
up-to-date. A French author can now
treat any subject with impunity. The
result has been that, there is a ten
dency toward greater seriousness and
deeper thought. I do not wish to seem
aggressive in saying that the French
are ahead of the Americans. The mod
ern school here is considered very
good in France. But these moderns
are really ahead of their time."
