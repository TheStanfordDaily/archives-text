# "SCOUTING" OF GRID CONTESTS WILL BE ABOLISHED AT YALE
## 
### 
Several major gridiron reform meas
ures have been introduced at Yale
since the last football season. Scout
ing of games has been abolished and
a plan to assure the neutrality of
referees suggested.
Tad Jones, head coach at Yale, has
long looked with disfavor on the cur
rent practice of scouting games as
detrimental to the spirit of amateur
athletics, and with its 1927 schedule
is an agreement—approved by Yale's
opponents—Bowdoin, Georgia, Brown,
Army, Dartmouth, Maryland, Prince
ton, and Harvard —to refrain from this
practice, which has developed into one
of the most expensive formal features
of the game. Jones last year made an
agreement with Bill Roper of Prince
ton, not to scout each other's games.
In place of the scouting feature, the
several universities may invite oppos
ing coaches to their games.
Jones also proposed a conference to
select a "dictator" who would choose
officials for the most important games,
and in this way avoid any feeling of
indebtedness on the part of officials to
coaches or schools instrumental in
securing their appointment.
