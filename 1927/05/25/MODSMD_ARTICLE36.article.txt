# EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WRONG, SAYS DARROW
## 
### 
Clarence Darrow, noted criminal
lawyer, declared to Dartmouth stu
dents recently that the public school
system of today is wrong and that
crime cannot be eliminated until steps
are taken to remedy the educational
system. "Most of us want to work with
our hands," he said, "and we should
have schools that meet this urge. We
shbuld fit our schools to the boys and
not our boys to the schools.
"Everything happens by natural law
â€”there are no accidents and no mir
acles," Darrow declared. "Life is an
eternal sequence and we can, by study
of the past, judge what is to happen
next. Man is a creature of heredity
and environment."
