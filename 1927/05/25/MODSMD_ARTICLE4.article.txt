# MUSSOLINI PRAISED BY ELLIOTT AS FASCIST HEAD
## 
### 
' The whole of Italy is behind Musso
lini and his lit'e is important to the
state," was the belief expressed by
Dr. Orrin L. Elliott, registrar emeritus
of the University, who spoke last night
in the Little Theatre on "Italy anil
Fascismo."
Dr. Elliott compared fascism and
bolshevism, saying that the latter is
the more easily understood of the two.
He outlined the history of modern
Italy up to the advent of the black
shirt party, analyzing the situation
and the character of the Italian people
to account for the ultimate result of
the uprising.
Traces Life
The life of Benito Mussolini with
all its romantic and exciting aspects
was pictured by the speaker in trac
ing the rise of the man, son of a
village blacksmith in tracing the rise
of the man, son of a village black
smith. to the tinal peak of his power.

The suppression of freedom in j
speech and press by the Fascisti re- |
gime has been emphasized by the |
American newspapers rather than its i
extensive program of reform and prac- j
tical improvement, according to Dr. 1
Elliott.
Mussolini Praised
"The secret of Fascism lies in the ;
character and ability of its leader," |
he said. The regime, four and one-half j
years old, has been marked by strides
of advancement.
Mussolini's foreign policy has been
a source of worry to both Europe and
the United States, Dr. Elliott stated.
He demands that the promises made I
by the Allies to Italy concerning post
war division of territory be fulfilled.
The cause of the man's achieve
ments is laid by Dr. Elliott to the
fact that "Mussolini succeeds because
he knows the Italian people and how
far and how fast they may be pushed." j
