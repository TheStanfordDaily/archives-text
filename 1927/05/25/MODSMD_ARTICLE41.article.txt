# CRIME COMMISSION'S WORK RESULTS IN STATE LEGISLATURE ACTTIVITY
## Chester G. Vernier Declares Majority of Proposed Reforms Passed; Governor Expected to Approve Bill 
### Gunnar Norberg 
That more than ninety bills and pro
posed amendments which advocated
| changes in certain principles of the
present law were introduced as a di
j rect result of the findings of the Cali
fornia Crime Commission appointed by
I the legislature at its 1925 session, was
the information given by Chester G.
Vernier, professor of criminal law, re
cently.
"The majority of the bills have been
passed by both the Assembly and the
I Senate, and it is fully expected that
they will be signed by the governor;
i in fact, some of them have already
; been signed by him," he Added.
"A series of bills whose tesign was
j to speed up procedure was introduced
so that the time used to try and con
vict a criminal might be greatly cut
down," Professor Vernier said. One of
the most conspicuous of the bills, in
troduced by the commission, is one
intended to reduce the number of fake
I pleas of insanity.
Insanity Law Changed
"If a man who has committed a
crime is found insane, instead of let
ting him go free as at present, he will
be sent to a hospital for the criminally
insane, where he must stay until he
has proved that his sanity has been
restored. Since he must remain in the
asylum at least one year before he is
allowed to institute proceedings to
prove his sanity, pleas of insanity are
expected to become more infrequent."
This, according to Professor Vernier,
is one of the most important altera
tions in the penal code made by the
present legislature.
In order to be able to plead insanity
at all, the person charged with the
commission of a crime must plead first
"not guilty" and then "not guilty by
reason of insanity." If he is found in
sane at the second trial after having
been found "guilty" during the first
trial, disposal is made of him as stated
above.
Under the law as it has hitherto

existed, if a defendant is found "not
guilty" by reason of pleading insanity,
he has usually been allowed to go en
tirely free. "The new law will keep
such an individual in an'insane asylum
at least a year," Professor Vernier
stated.
Habitual Offenders
Another bill passed by the Legisla
ture and receiving the signature of
Governor Young last week is one
strengthening the law on the habitual
| offender. After being convicted of his
fourth felony the criminal will be pun
ished by life imprisonment without
ever being privileged to secure parole.
The felonies for which this ultimate
penalty is to result are robbery, bur
glary, burglary with explosives, rape
with force or violence, arson, murder,
grand theft, bribery of a public of
ficial, perjury, subornation of perjury,
train-wrecking, feloniously receiving
stolen goods, and felonious assault
with a deadly weapon.
"Grand theft" is the new general
designation in which category the
crimes of larceny, embezzlement, and
the securing of property under false
pretenses have been combined.
Escape Harder
"Before the passage of this law, a
man might escape the just penalty for
his crime by first pleading his case
under one of the three classifications
and later altering his plea to that of
another of the three, thereby making
conviction on the basis of his original
plea impossible," said Professor Ver
nier.
"Because the legislature believes
that it ought not to be so easy to get
bail and then forfeit it, several bills
have been passed tending to make
the present law in relation to the ob
taining of bail more strict," he added.
A bill was also passed and has been
signed by the governor authorizing
the creation of a new crime commis
sion to make a further study of the
causes of crime and make a report to
the 1929 legislature.

existed, if a defendant is found "not
guilty" by reason of pleading insanity,
he has usually been allowed to go en
tirely free. "The new law will keep
such an individual in an'insane asylum
at least a year," Professor Vernier
stated.
Habitual Offenders
Another bill passed by the Legisla
ture and receiving the signature of
Governor Young last week is one
strengthening the law on the habitual
| offender. After being convicted of his
fourth felony the criminal will be pun
ished by life imprisonment without
ever being privileged to secure parole.
The felonies for which this ultimate
penalty is to result are robbery, bur
glary, burglary with explosives, rape
with force or violence, arson, murder,
grand theft, bribery of a public of
ficial, perjury, subornation of perjury,
train-wrecking, feloniously receiving
stolen goods, and felonious assault
with a deadly weapon.
"Grand theft" is the new general
designation in which category the
crimes of larceny, embezzlement, and
the securing of property under false
pretenses have been combined.
Escape Harder
"Before the passage of this law, a
man might escape the just penalty for
his crime by first pleading his case
under one of the three classifications
and later altering his plea to that of
another of the three, thereby making
conviction on the basis of his original
plea impossible," said Professor Ver
nier.
"Because the legislature believes
that it ought not to be so easy to get
bail and then forfeit it, several bills
have been passed tending to make
the present law in relation to the ob
taining of bail more strict," he added.
A bill was also passed and has been
signed by the governor authorizing
the creation of a new crime commis
sion to make a further study of the
causes of crime and make a report to
the 1929 legislature.
That more than ninety bills and pro
posed amendments which advocated
| changes in certain principles of the
present law were introduced as a di
j rect result of the findings of the Cali
fornia Crime Commission appointed by
I the legislature at its 1925 session, was
the information given by Chester G.
Vernier, professor of criminal law, re
cently.
"The majority of the bills have been
passed by both the Assembly and the
I Senate, and it is fully expected that
they will be signed by the governor;
i in fact, some of them have already
; been signed by him," he Added.
"A series of bills whose tesign was
j to speed up procedure was introduced
so that the time used to try and con
vict a criminal might be greatly cut
down," Professor Vernier said. One of
the most conspicuous of the bills, in
troduced by the commission, is one
intended to reduce the number of fake
I pleas of insanity.
Insanity Law Changed
"If a man who has committed a
crime is found insane, instead of let
ting him go free as at present, he will
be sent to a hospital for the criminally
insane, where he must stay until he
has proved that his sanity has been
restored. Since he must remain in the
asylum at least one year before he is
allowed to institute proceedings to
prove his sanity, pleas of insanity are
expected to become more infrequent."
This, according to Professor Vernier,
is one of the most important altera
tions in the penal code made by the
present legislature.
In order to be able to plead insanity
at all, the person charged with the
commission of a crime must plead first
"not guilty" and then "not guilty by
reason of insanity." If he is found in
sane at the second trial after having
been found "guilty" during the first
trial, disposal is made of him as stated
above.
Under the law as it has hitherto

existed, if a defendant is found "not
guilty" by reason of pleading insanity,
he has usually been allowed to go en
tirely free. "The new law will keep
such an individual in an'insane asylum
at least a year," Professor Vernier
