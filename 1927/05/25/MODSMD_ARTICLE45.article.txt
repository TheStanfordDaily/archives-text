His Might is left TUES. 24—
Will Robert Moses Grove lear the
Philadelphia Athletics out of the
Wilderness in which the White Ele
phants have roamed for the past
twelve years, and personally conduct
them into the Promised Land where
waves the American League Pennant?
Besides the appropriate middle
name of Moses, Bob Grove has some
thing else quite adaptable to lead
ing Connie Mack's "Antiques" to the
top of the American League, the same
being his good left arm, perhaps the
most remarkable left arm now in the
business of professional baseball.
That long, lanky arm of Grove's can
hurl a baseball with more speed than
Walter Johnson can today—and many
say that Sir Walter in his prime never
threw them as fast as the Philadelphia
southpaw. Old-timers are even rating
Grove as the best left-hander since
the immortal Rube Waddell, which is
the highest degree of praise.
Watching Connie's left-hander work
in the opening game of the season
against the Yankees at the Stadium,
I could not help but marvel at the
smooth-flowing motion with which Bob
propelled that little white ball towards
the plate. And talk about speed!
Zowie! The sphere whizzed by the
batter like a streak of lightening, and
on at least two occasions Catcher
Gordon Cochrane was literally "up
rooted" from the ground and dragged
backwards by the speed of Grove's
pitches.
Then the tall southpaw had a cross
fire that started about half way be
tween the pitcher's box and first base,
and seemed to be aiming towards
the Yankees dugout. For awhile he
was absolutely invincible.
Grove is about due to crash into
real greatness this season. He won
ten games and lost twelve in 1925,
broke even last year with thirteen

wins and thirteen' losses, and now
wants to turn in a record like the one
he compiled during his years with the
Baltimore Orioles, which caused Con
nie Mack to buy him from Jack Dunn
for the record price of $105,000.
