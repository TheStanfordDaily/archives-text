# STUART RECOMMENDS MANDATE SYSTEM IN WESTERN HEMISPHERE
## Stanford Professor Finds League's Procedure in Europe Valuable 
### 
"Although the United States has not
entered the League of Nations, the
Rockefeller foundation aloue has spent
more money on projects undertaken
111 the name of the League than all
of the countries of Europe put to
gether." This was the statement made
by Professor Graham Henry Stuart,
of the Stanford department of Politi
cal Science, 011 the subject of America
and the League of Nations.
Sent by the United States, Professor
Stuart spent a considerable part of
last summer at Geneva studying the
organization and powers of the League
of Nations. This body he pronounces
highly efficient and of great influence
in Europe. Its value in substituting
arbitration for hostilities in such
crises as the Greco-Bulgarian dispute
and the Mussolini-Corfu incident is
greatly appreciated in Europe.
"Progresses of the League fill the
front page columns of European news
papers. In Eastern United States, the
New York Times and the New York
World are not indifferent to its func
tions. With the single exception of
Chester Howell's newly-inaugurated
column in the Chronicle, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and Examiner both
ignore the League's very evistence.
The reason for the strong newspaper
opposition in this country is that
Hearst, who is against the League,
controls half of the papers in America.
"That the men in power are not
always sure of the sentiments of the
jpeople upon international subjects is
illustrated by two significant recent
events in world affairs. Although the
Senate wishes to arbitrate the Nicara
gua question, President. Coolidge
stated that there was 110 ground for
arbitration. On the other hand, Judge
Ralston of Palo Alto, Who has repre
sented the United States 011 many in
ternational affairs, holds that the situ
ation could be very effectively arbi
trated.
"Our ambassador in Paris advised
against Lindbergh's starting for
France for fear of his reception there.
Lindbergh delayed only for favorable
weather conditions. His friendly re
ception showed that Herrick's fears
were entirely unfounded."
In conclusion Stuart remarked that
the United States could utilize the
mandate system, instituted by the
League, in her Central American af
fairs, and thus in a way legalize her
now questional authority there.

highly efficient and of great influence
in Europe. Its value in substituting
arbitration for hostilities in such
crises as the Greco-Bulgarian dispute

"Progresses of the League fill the
front page columns of European news
papers. In Eastern United States, the
New York Times and the New York
World are not indifferent to its func
tions. With the single exception of
Chester Howell's newly-inaugurated
column in the Chronicle, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and Examiner both
ignore the League's very evistence.

opposition in this country is that
Hearst, who is against the League,
controls half of the papers in America.
"That the men in power are not
always sure of the sentiments of the
jpeople upon international subjects is
illustrated by two significant recent
events in world affairs. Although the
Senate wishes to arbitrate the Nicara
gua question, President. Coolidge
stated that there was 110 ground for
arbitration. On the other hand, Judge
Ralston of Palo Alto, Who has repre
sented the United States 011 many in
ternational affairs, holds that the situ
ation could be very effectively arbi
trated.
"Our ambassador in Paris advised
against Lindbergh's starting for
France for fear of his reception there.
Lindbergh delayed only for favorable
weather conditions. His friendly re
ception showed that Herrick's fears
were entirely unfounded."
In conclusion Stuart remarked that
the United States could utilize the
mandate system, instituted by the
League, in her Central American af
fairs, and thus in a way legalize her
now questional authority there.
