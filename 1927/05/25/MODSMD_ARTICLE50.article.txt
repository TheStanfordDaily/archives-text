Word received from John McCor
mick, general manager of West Coast

hopes that similar searches will be
held at various times in the future,
and that the later tests will be success
ful for men of all the schools of the
country, as there is a need in the mo
tion picture industry not only for
actors, but also for executives, pro
ducers, directors, technicians, and
other workers with a collegiate back
ground.
"We hope that all the men chosen
will conduct themselves with credit,"
