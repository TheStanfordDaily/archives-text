# Minnesota Savant Finds New Scarlet Fever Cure
## 
### 
Dr. W. P. Larson, head of the de
partment of bacteriology at Minnesota,
has discovered a castor oil soap which
tests indicate immunizes against scar
let fever. The immunization by means
of the soap consists in the neutralizing
action of the castor oil soap on the
toxins of diphtheria and scarlet fever.
It is claimed to be superior to the
usual anti-toxins and vaccines because
of its simplicity. Under this treatment
any amount of poisonous toxin is
mixed with the castor oil soap and the
operation is completed by injecting the
mixture into the patient's blood
stream.
