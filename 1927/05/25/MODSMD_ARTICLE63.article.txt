# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY COMPLETES FILES OF HUNGARIAN PLACARDS
## Edgar Yolland Selected to Arrange Material for Display Files 
### 
Said to be the best collection of
Hungarian Posters in this country, a
group of electionary, administrative,
and educational placards used in Hun
gary during the regimes of 1918 and
1919 has just been placed on file in
the Hoover War Library.
Although the posters have been in
the Library's possession for some
time, it has been impossible to lile
them because no one on the Library
staff could decipher the Hungarian —a
language unrelated to any of the lead
ing tongues of Europe. It was only
recently that Edgar H. Yolland, a for
eign exchange student from Hungary,
was obtained to do the translations
and so make the filing possible.
Most interesting of the posters are
those issued during the Bolshevist
regime, when the semi-democratic,
semi-liberal government under Karolyi
gained control of Hungary on March
21, 1919, and continued for five
months. The placards express anti
war and anti-entente sentiment, ap
pealing to the farmer and laborer
classes. They admonish the people to
keep clean, urge the protection of
women and children, and illustrate the
evils of alcohol. One result of the cam
paign was the almost complete abolish
ment of intoxicating liquors through
out Hungary.
Many of the posters painted for the
nationalists, who were conducting a
campaign to depose the existing Red
regime, were the work of Miltiades
Mannos, an uncle of Yolland who was
an officer in the Huzzars. These post
ers show the decentralizing effect of
the Bolshevist measures.
Most of the posters in the collection
consist merely of printed injunctions.
Some, howevel\ are pictures done in
vivid colors. All were issued for circu
lation among the various nations and
for posting in the schools and public
places of Hungary.
