# SOPHOMORES LOOM PROBABLE VICTORS IN WOMEN'S SPORTS
## Marion Holley, '30, Expected To Star by Breaking Three Records FRESHMEN ARE STRONG Field Day Events to Start At 2:00 O'clock With Archery, Track 
### 
I Sophomore women, last year's Field
j Day champions, are expected to win
; again in this year's contest which will
open with the archery and track
j meets at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Pre
j dictions are that the 1929 teams will
: take the first three places in archery,
; possibly a sweep, first in swimming,
! and second in track. They have al
j ready placed third and fourth in ten
' nis, Helen Bell, '29. losing to Ruth
Thatcher, '30, in the semi-finals yester
day.
Archery Winners
The sophomores have five women
entered in the archery tournament.
These include Margaret Melgaard,
last year's champion and holder of the
record, who is also the present arch
ery manager, May Abbott, a newcomer
on the Stanford archery field, who
has made some very high scores in
practice, and Martha Blackwelder,
whose scores in practice last year led
to the belief that she would place
high in the tournament, but who did
not compete for the cup. The remain
ing 1929 representatives are Helen
Adams and Katherine Miles. Lucy
Ritter, '30, and Astrid Arnoldson, '27,
are the other two entries. The juniors
will not be represented.
The first three places will probably
go to the three sophomores first
■ named, although in what order it is
difficult to predict. Ritter may pro
| vide a surprise by taking one of the
first three places, and will probably
take at least fourth.
Freshmen Favored
In track the freshmen are almost
j sure to win, with Marian Holley a
record-breaker in every event which
she has so far attempted, and re
' stricted only by the rule that no en
; trant may compete in more than three
j events other than the relay. Holley
has already broken both the 50-yard
dash and running broad jump records
i in practice, and will probably take a
1 good fir3t in the high jump. Her team
mate, Harriet Sutton, is doped as a
j double winner, to take first in the
; shot put and the hop-step-and-jump.
! Dora Matfield, '30, is expected to take
' second in the shot.
Second place in the 50-yard dash
will probably be fought out between
| Mildred Cole, '29, and Dorothy For
' dyce, '28, with Fordyce favored, as
! will also the 100-yard race. Cole will
j also be a contestant for third in the
I high jump, with Joyce Lyon, '29.
J. Lyon is favored in fhr> high hur
dles, and Ruth Landsburgli, '29 cap
tain, is doped as the probable winner
I of the low sticks.
Double Winner
The sophomores have another prob
| able double winner in Marion Klock
sen, who has so far made the best
distances in the basketball throw and
the standing broad jump. She has alsb
a good chance in the baseball throw,
in which she will compete for honors
with Frances Watson, '28. Watson is
slightly favored.
Other probable point-winners are
j Ruth Mason, '29, Lucille Lyon, '27,
I and Carolyn Shepard, '28.
j Honors in tennis lie between
1 Thatcher, '30, and Watson, '28. That
| cher won from Bell, '29, yesterday
J afternoon by a score of 6-1, 3-6, 6-1.
i The play went more evenly than the
j scores would indicate, with long ral
| lies and well-placed shots by both con
! testants. Bell played a low driving
j game, while Thatcher found her op

ponent's weak spot, the right-hand
reach, and made it tell at intervals.
The final tennis game will take place
as soon as Watson finishes competing
in the track meet this afternoon, prob
ably at about 3 o'clock.
The swimming meet, starting at 4
o'clock, will close the Field Day ath
letic program. No results can be pre
dicted other than that the sophomore
swimmers will probably take first hon
ors and the freshmen second, with
either of the upperclass teams fol
lowing with a close third.
Several new records ought to be set
this afternoon. Katherine Doyle, if j
pressed at all in the 25-yard back- 1
stroke, will probably cut the present |
record by at least two-fifths of a sec- J
ond; Jean Wakefield has a good
chance to do the same in the breast !
stroke. Both of the longer free style
events will be close, but the best race
of tlie day is expected in the one
length free style with Maxine Cushing ,
and Katherine Doyle fighting it out for
first place.
•* The diving at today's meet ought to
be the best so far this year. Clarita !
llunsberger, present Olympic cham
pion, will represent the seniors and
should easily take first place. Second
and third places could go to any of j
the other entrants, including Frances j
Foster, senior; Elizabeth van Loben |
Sels, sophomore; Chesterlyn Thomas, j
sophomore, and Maxine Cushing.
