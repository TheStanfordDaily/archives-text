Archery Winners
The sophomores have five women
entered in the archery tournament.
These include Margaret Melgaard,
last year's champion and holder of the
record, who is also the present arch
ery manager, May Abbott, a newcomer
on the Stanford archery field, who
has made some very high scores in
practice, and Martha Blackwelder,
whose scores in practice last year led
to the belief that she would place
high in the tournament, but who did
not compete for the cup. The remain
ing 1929 representatives are Helen
Adams and Katherine Miles. Lucy
Ritter, '30, and Astrid Arnoldson, '27,
are the other two entries. The juniors
will not be represented.
The first three places will probably
go to the three sophomores first
