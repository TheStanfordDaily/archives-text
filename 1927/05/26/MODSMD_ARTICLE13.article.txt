# PAYSON TREAT DESCRIBES CHINA SITUATION TO DATE
## 
### Elizabeth Clark 
"Nobody knows what will be the
outcome of the present situation in
China," was the verdict pronounced
by Professor Payson J. Treat of the
Stanford History Department and an
authority on the Far East.
The Nationalist party, which was
making great advances over the Mili
tarists in the North, was checked by
a split in its own ranks early in
March. A left wing of communists
was formed.
"At the present time the three politi
cal centers which must be watched
are: Peking, controlled by General
Chang Tso-lin, the Manchurian war
lord and head of a group of northern
militarists; Hankow, the capital of
the left wing of the Nationalists,
largely dominated by the small but
very active Communist element in
the party; Nanking, capital of Gen
eral Chiang Kai-shek, until recently
the generalissimo of the Nationalists,
but now head of a faction supported
by the Center and Right Wing of (he
Nationalists. In addition, several prov
inces are keeping aloof from the strug
gle, while the position of General
Feng Yu-hsiang, the formerly ac
claimed 'Christian General,' is not
clearly defined. Appointed to lead the
Hankow faction, lie has not, so far as
known, been able to join his forces
with those at Hankow.

"The recent action of General Chang
Tso-lin in raiding the outlying build
ings of the Russian Legation in Peking
furnished his police and military of
ficers wth information respecting the
Chinese Communists in the northern
centers, as well as the plans of the
Russians for breaking down the influ
ence of the foes of the Hankow group.
This has certainly hampered the pro
paganda campaign in the North, and
seems to have turned many of the
moderate Nationalists against the
Russian influence in their party.
"While it was always doubtful
whether a southern campaign could
proceed successfully as far as Peking,
it is now rendered even less probable
by the break within the Nationalist
party.
"Most of the Americans have been
evacuated from the interior of China,
although in a few instances they re
fused to leave. A strong naval force
is policing the coast and the Yangtze
river, while American marines are co
operating with the soldiers, sailors,
and marines of many of the treaty
powers in the defense of Shanghai,
the great center of international trade
with China. The American policy, re
peatedly announced, has been to pro
test American lives and property, so
far as possible, but in no case to inter
fere in the internal dissensions in
China."

This has certainly hampered the pro
paganda campaign in the North, and
seems to have turned many of the
moderate Nationalists against the
Russian influence in their party.
"While it was always doubtful
whether a southern campaign could
proceed successfully as far as Peking,
it is now rendered even less probable
by the break within the Nationalist
party.
"Most of the Americans have been
evacuated from the interior of China,
although in a few instances they re
fused to leave. A strong naval force
is policing the coast and the Yangtze
river, while American marines are co
operating with the soldiers, sailors,
and marines of many of the treaty
powers in the defense of Shanghai,
the great center of international trade
with China. The American policy, re
peatedly announced, has been to pro
test American lives and property, so
far as possible, but in no case to inter
fere in the internal dissensions in
China."
"Nobody knows what will be the
outcome of the present situation in
China," was the verdict pronounced
by Professor Payson J. Treat of the
Stanford History Department and an
authority on the Far East.
The Nationalist party, which was
making great advances over the Mili
tarists in the North, was checked by
a split in its own ranks early in
March. A left wing of communists
was formed.
"At the present time the three politi
cal centers which must be watched
are: Peking, controlled by General
Chang Tso-lin, the Manchurian war
lord and head of a group of northern
militarists; Hankow, the capital of
the left wing of the Nationalists,
largely dominated by the small but
very active Communist element in
the party; Nanking, capital of Gen
eral Chiang Kai-shek, until recently
the generalissimo of the Nationalists,
but now head of a faction supported
by the Center and Right Wing of (he
Nationalists. In addition, several prov
inces are keeping aloof from the strug
gle, while the position of General
Feng Yu-hsiang, the formerly ac
claimed 'Christian General,' is not
clearly defined. Appointed to lead the
Hankow faction, lie has not, so far as
known, been able to join his forces
with those at Hankow.

"The recent action of General Chang
Tso-lin in raiding the outlying build
ings of the Russian Legation in Peking
furnished his police and military of
ficers wth information respecting the
Chinese Communists in the northern
centers, as well as the plans of the
Russians for breaking down the influ
