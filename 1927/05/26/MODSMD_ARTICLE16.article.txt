# SHIPKEY WILL COACH LINE AT SACRAMENTO
## 
### 
Ted Shipkey, whose appointment to
the post of assistant physical educa
tion instructor at Sacramento Junior
College was announced in yesterday's
Daily, will act as line coach for the
school football team next fall, it was
made known yesterday. Arthur
Schuettner, the present coach, will
continue as head coach, leaving the
line work entirely up to Shipkey.
"1 am certainly pleased that Shipkey
is to be here next year," Schuettner
said yesterday. He believes that three
years' training under "Pop" Warner
should qualify Shipkey as a stellar
line coach.
