# PROGRAM FROM GREIG SCHEDULED BY ALLEN
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen will offer a pro
gram of Greig's music for his recital
at 4:15 o'clock today. Edward Grieg
was of Scotch descent but a native
of Norway, born in 1543. His position
in the world of music is noteworthy,
and his compositions are remarkable
for their originality of theme and
brightness of melody.
"Im Balladenton," a ballad, will be
the first selection to be played. "Sol
veig's Song" from the famous "Peer
Gynt Suite," "Thoughtfully I Wander,"
"Peasant's Song," and Triumphal
March from "Sigurd Jorsalfor," is the
remainder of the program.
