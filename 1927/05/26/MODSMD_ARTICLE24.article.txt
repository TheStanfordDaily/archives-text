# I.C.4-A TRACK SQUAD ARRIVES AT WINDY CITY
## Newspaper Experts Pick Cardinals to Win Contest COACH ARRIVES FRIDAY Biff Hoffman, Forster Have Equaled Rivals' 48 Foot Mark 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, May 25.—The
team arrived here in fit condition
for the meet. The weather is
cloudy with a little rain. The
squad worked out on Franklin
Field with Hoffman, Forster, Way,
and Fleishhacker still keeping up
their work in the shot and discus.
Track experts on the Philadel
phia papers pick Stanford to win
the meet with forty points, and
U.S.C. to take second with twenty
points. Personally, I think they are
right. The entry list is very large.
Coach Dink Templeton is ex
pected here Friday morning. Such
news is most welcome as we want
Dink to be present to see his team
bring home the bacon.

Stanford appears to have the edge
jr the competing teams in the 1.C.-4A.
meet, as the records in weight events
made by the Eastern squads are not
as good as those held by the Cardinals.
Outlook Rosy in Shot
In the shot put, only two teams
have entries who have done over 4S
feet while Hoffman and Forster have
previously equaled this mark. Fleish
hacker throws it at 46 feet 6 inches
and Way at 46 feet. In the discus,
Stanford again has the advantage as
Hoffman has tossed it 154 feet while
none of the entering schools have bet
tered the 145-foot mark. Evans is
counted on for a throw of 145 feet and
Way and Forster for 135 feet.
King, Work in High Jump
With King and Work entered in the
high jump, Cardinal opponents are as
sured of a high record to equal. In the
javelin, both Stanford men, Shipkey
and Sparling, have done 190 feet while
the best Eastern record is 186. Boetter
of U.S.C. has tossed the spear 188
feet.
The Eastern men have been doing
around 23 feet in the broad jump.
Zombro, Meeks, and Dyer all have
gone over 24 feet while Hill of U.S.C.
has made 24 feet 6 inches. Kabelitz of
California is the best hope for the
Bears with a 23 feet 8 inch jump to his
credit.

pected here Friday morning. Such
news is most welcome as we want
Dink to be present to see his team
bring home the bacon.
(Signed): Harry Maloney.
Stanford appears to have the edge
jr the competing teams in the 1.C.-4A.
meet, as the records in weight events
made by the Eastern squads are not
as good as those held by the Cardinals.
Outlook Rosy in Shot
In the shot put, only two teams
have entries who have done over 4S
feet while Hoffman and Forster have
previously equaled this mark. Fleish
hacker throws it at 46 feet 6 inches
and Way at 46 feet. In the discus,
Stanford again has the advantage as
Hoffman has tossed it 154 feet while
none of the entering schools have bet
tered the 145-foot mark. Evans is
counted on for a throw of 145 feet and
Way and Forster for 135 feet.
King, Work in High Jump
With King and Work entered in the
high jump, Cardinal opponents are as
sured of a high record to equal. In the
javelin, both Stanford men, Shipkey
and Sparling, have done 190 feet while
the best Eastern record is 186. Boetter
of U.S.C. has tossed the spear 188
feet.
The Eastern men have been doing
around 23 feet in the broad jump.
Zombro, Meeks, and Dyer all have
gone over 24 feet while Hill of U.S.C.
has made 24 feet 6 inches. Kabelitz of
California is the best hope for the
Bears with a 23 feet 8 inch jump to his
credit.
