# Unfortunate Mistakes
## 
### 
In carrying on any type of a campaign, a newspaper must be fair and
print the truth if its policy is to succeed. The publication cannot deliber
ately make mistakes, in order to favor its side ol the controversy. It is
for these reasons that the Daily sincerely regrets that certain mistakes
appeared in Dean Yost's statement in Monday's paper.
The errors were quite accidental and were caused by inefficient proof
reading and copy editing. Such mistakes happen all too often and the
Daily is not alone in this respect. The manner in which copy must be
rushed across the desk in order to make press time, is the only excuse
that we offer.
Because a line was transposed in the third paragraph and because of
several other minor proof errors, the sense of the several sentences was
lost. The paragraph should have read as follows: "Any woman through
her Conference representative can get any question brought up for dis
cussion in the legislative body, and both Conference and Council invite
suggestions. It is their aim to build up a responsible public opinion, so
that the standards which the women feel will promote not only their
interests, but the wider interests of the University shall be based on a
vital sense of what the actual situation is and shall be loyally supported
as the price of their responsible freedom."
Dean Yost "advised" women to wait before changing the existing
rules; she did not "request" them to make that action.
And now that we have corrected these technical errors, let the battle
be resumed.
