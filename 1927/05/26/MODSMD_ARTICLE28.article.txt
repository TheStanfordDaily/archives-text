# No Interest Shown

Now that the Stanford student body has a new constitution, they
might just as well make use of it. Next Tuesday is election day on the
campus and so far only sixteen students have been nominated for the
many offices that will be vacated next week. It may be the warm spring
weather that is sapping the student body of the little energy and interest
which is usually demonstrated around election time.
Practically every undergraduate position of any importance is open
and beckoning the politically inclined members of the University. Noth
ing is so conducive to the choosing of expert executives, as competition,
arid plenty of it. And usually nothing is so bad for an office as white
ballot elections. In addition to being bad for the office, it is disheartening
for the victorious candidate. There is no real thrill in winning a fight
when there is no one to battle with. And usually the student chosen in
such a way enters the position without the enthusiasm that follows a hard
fought victory.
A political campaign outside of college is a big event. A political
campaign at Stanford has become a boring necessity. Officers must be
elected to run the student body, so certain more ambitious members of
the college sacrifice their time and find a few people, who do no tobject,
to run for the positions and these men and women then run the Uni
versity for the ensuing year.
The rest of the student body will spend the whole of the next year
criticizing the administration. If the students do not nominate their
favorites now, and support them afterward, they should use discretion in
their commenting next fall.
