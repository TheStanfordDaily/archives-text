After a period of competition lasting over two months nine new
members are added to the staff of the Daily. Twenty-two men and
women reported for the first meeting for the tryouts this quarter and of
these, fifteen remained to the end of the competition. The new members
to be congratulated are Robert Brownell, Vernon Cordry, Richard D.
Cutter, Carl N. Mather, Jr., Stanley A. Milne, Gunnar-N. Norberg,
Arthui J. Schilder, Gale D. Wallace, and Herbert E. Wenig.
The new reporters will be assigned "beats" next autumn and will
work with the present staff members on the regular handling of news
beginning with the first issue of the Daily next October. During their
time spent as tryoutees the new reporters have been engaged in searching
for extra items of news which would not otherwise be obtained. Experi
ence of this sort has enabled them to ascertain what constitutes news as
well as to make it easier for them to follow out definite assignments.
