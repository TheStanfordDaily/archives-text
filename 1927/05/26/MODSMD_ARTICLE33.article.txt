# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
This beautiful spot on La Honda
Highway offers a most convenient
place for picnicking, the La Honda
Creek that runs between the two hill
slopes, with its clear running water,
reminds one of the many beautiful
streamlets in the lovely Swiss valleys,
which are attracting millions of peo
ple to the Swiss recreation grounds.
If creeks, woods, springs, squirrels,
wood peckers, and all the flowers that
grow among the lovely trees have in
spired poets and writers, La Honda
Vista certainly can!
Why don't we students think of a
most healthy investment proposition,
and either through the agency of
groups, living houses, fraternities, so
cial organizations or honorary socie
ties, build a log cabin on one of these
slopes, which although on the High
way offer such a comfort, and rest,
and during the time of hottest weather
remain so cool.
Let us think for a moment, that by
this we would be investing in some
thing bet'fer and more valuable than
rubber, coffee, or cotton, and that is:
a healthy week-end proposition.
If our living houses, fraternities, and
other organizations would have a log
cabin to offer their members for week
end trips—and so near to the campus

—how much more reconciled we would
feel to nature, and how much more
service value were to be found in a
membership with an organization.
