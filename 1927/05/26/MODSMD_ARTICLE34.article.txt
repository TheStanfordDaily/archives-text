The Editor, Sir:
We note with surprise the "gratify
ing success" of the latest communique
to the editor, and not being conceited
or anything, think we might get a
portion of the success others have in
getting free advertising.
In common with the former corres
pondent, we have neither rime nor
reason for writing, but as some ex
cuse is necessary in order to break
into print, we will rise up heartily to
contradict any insinuations to the ef
fect that the food in the Encina dining
hall is anything but delicious and
nourishing. Of course, if we should
ever attain the literary perfection of
our colleague, this humble fare would
doubtless not lay well on our sensi
tive gullet either.
We even like the plays presented
here, but for the sake of seeing every
one satisfied we would go so far as
to pull for a tag day and raise the
requisite $3.90 to send the critical
genius of the campus to the Shanghai
Gesture again, the extra 60c over $3.30
being bus fare to the city one way.
—J.P., '28.
