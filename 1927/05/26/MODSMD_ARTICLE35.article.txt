# STANFORD PROFESSORS TO TEACH ON WORLD'S CRUISE
## 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
Two Stanford professors, Dr. Henry
David Gray and Dr. Lee Emerson Bas
sett, of the English department, will
have charge of the English and dra
matic departments on the Floating
University which sails from New York
on September 21 for an eight months'
co-educational trip around the world.
Sixty faculty members in all have been
engaged, the Stanford men being the
only ones selected from the entire
Pacific Coast.
Dr. Gray, who is a nationally-known
Shakespearian critic and playwright,
will head the English department on
the Cunard liner "Aurania," the new
ship which has been secured for the
tour. Under his supervision such
courses as Composition and Rhetoric
(English A), Advanced Prose Compo
sition, Creative Writing, Types of
Literature, and The Modern Novel
will be offered.
Bassett Will Tour
Dr. Bassett will devote his time to
dramatic work and public speaking.
He plans to take his family with him
and when the second semester ends
next May he will tour Northern Eu
rope until fall quarter of 1928 opens
at Stanford.
Both professors are highly enthusi
astic about the Floating University
idea. Twenty-seven countries will be
visited on the cruise, six months being
spent on the sea and two in ports.
The originators of the college-afloat
scheme have abandoned the "Rhyn
dam," the ship they used this year, for
the new Cunard "Aurania," built in
1924 and equipped with all modern
conveniences, including the latest type
of forced draft ventilation. The "Rliyn
dam" will be utilized by another com

pany which is planning a tour for men
students only.
Co-education Favored
The Stanford men both favor co
education, and those on board the
Floating University will endeavor to
maintain the homelike and normal re
lationship between men and women
students. There will be a special sec
tion of the "Aurania" set aside for
the women, with a Dean of Women in
charge.
Pre-collegiate, undergraduate, and
graduate work will be offered the 550
students making the trip. The educa-"
tional organization on shipboard
makes it possible for closer relations
between student and faculty than is
possible ashore. The value of the trip
is not confined to the classroom, the
Stanford professors say, but to the
constant contact at all hours and
under all conditions between students
and faculty members selected from
the standpoint of personality and
character. Co-operation between gov
ernment officials and foreign universi
ties will make it possible for the Float
ing University students to visit places
not available to the usual tourist.
Stanford students interested in the
cruise may get complete details from
either Dr. Gray or Dr. Bassett.
