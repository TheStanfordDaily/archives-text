# PRINCETON MEN CALL HARVARD EFFEMINATE
## 
### 
Harvfrd, trailing only Smith and
Vassar, was voted the third most popu
lar women's college by Princeton sen
iors at their recent class banquet. It
also came in for its share of sarcasm
when many seniors answered the ques
tion: "What has 1927 done for Prince
ton?" by saying, "dropped Harvard."
The seniors voted women their fa
vorite study, and selected Norma
Shearer as the most popular feminine
film star, closely followed by Greta
Garbo.
