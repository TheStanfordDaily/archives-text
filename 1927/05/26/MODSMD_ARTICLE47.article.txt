# WORLD-WIDE EFFORT LAUNCHED FOR NEW STRATFORD THEATRE
## 
### 
"Certainly it must have been some
lovers of Shakespeare who were re
sponsible for the burning of the
Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford-On-
Avon, because it was an ugly building
that should have been torn down long
ago," said Professor Henry D. Gray of
the English Department. "Since it
has been burnt, a world-wide move
ment has been started to replace it by
ii theatre worthy of Shakespeare in
fvery way," he added.
Theatre Must Be Beautiful
The theatre will have to be beauti
ful, adapted to the production of plays,
and it must be in some manner the
expression of the universal love of
Shakespeare, explained Professor
Gray. The first two objects have been
well looked out for, and the third is
being sought by a campaign for .sub
scriptions by which the largest pos
sible number of people can express
their tribute to him. A subscription of
whatever one's genuine regard for the
writer leads him to want to give for a
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre is
being asked for in all the leading col
leges and cities of America and other
countries.
In this country it has become cus
tomary to appoint a committee of
three persons, consisting of two fac
ulty members and one student who
receive subscriptions, and send them
to the American Shakespeare Founda
t ion. Professor Gray, Doctor Margery
SHailey, and Barbara S. Probasco com
prise the Stanford committee and are
ready to receive and forward contribu
tions. A closing date for receiving sub
scriptions will be announced later.
The University of Washington rifle
team won second place in the annual
