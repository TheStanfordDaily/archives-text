# SUMMER GEOLOGICAL SURVEY TO BE HELD IN VENTURA COUNTY
## 
### 
The Stanford Geological Survey, .
composed of advanced students and ;
instructors of the Geology department,
will spend the summer conducting!
field work and mapping geological !
areas in the Coast Range region. The
Survey Mill be held this year in the
Santa Paula Quadrangle, Ventura
County, and the work will be a con- '
tiuuation of that done last summer.
Organized by Branner
The Survey was organized by Dr. I
John Casper Branner soon after Stan
ford was founded. Branner, later a
president of the University, was at
the time head of the Geology depart
ment, and he realized that while !
geologists had accumulated a few gen- |
eral notions regarding the geology of j
California, little detailed mapping had
been done and most of the data essen
tial for accurate knowledge was lack
ing. To remedy the situation he set his !
students to work gathering data re
garding California geology, and in
order to create a permanent corps to
carry on these investigations he es
tablished the Stanford Geological Sur
vey.
The Coast Range region was se
lected as being most suitable for the
instruction of embryo geologists and j
because it also offers many problems
for more advanced research. There- j
gion lias had a complicated structural !
history, and folds and faults on both
a large and small scale can be studied.
The stratigraphic column includes
many thousands of feet of exposed ;
sedimentary rocks which contain nu- j
merous interesting fossil assemblages. |
Economic value is attached to the i
geology of the region due to the abun- |
dance of oil there.
The work of the Survey is so or
ganized that each student has a chance
for independent work to be checked
up 011 later by the instructors. After
establishing camp and preparing note
books and maps, the entire party un-1
dertakes a general reconnaissance of
the region. Preliminary fossil deter
minations are made under the direc
tion of the paleontologist and the age
of the formations are thus determined.
Then a definite area is assigned to
every two students, who must work
out its geology in detail. The instruc
tors also prepare a map of the region
which is compared with that of the
students. The complex geology of the
California Coast Range calls for a
personal examination and study of
every rock outcrop.
