# HARK YE! HARK YE! REMOVED ORNAMENTS MAY BE RECAPTURED

"The Port of Missing Signs"
has been definitely located in the
Corporation Yard, where flam
buoyant signs of every hue and
description, bright red lanterns,
and other objects so dear to the
heart of the freshmen have been
collected.
Due to the effirts of zealous
janitors who collected loose deco
rations iu Em ilia Hall when the
occupants of the rooms were
away on Monday and Tuesday,
the original owners now have a
chance to reclaim their straying
signs. Those which are not re
covered by their rightful owners
will go to the junk-man, Univer
sity authorities state.
As this paper goes to press it
is reported that the signs have
been mysteriously removed from
the Corporation Yards by per
sons unknown. Where are they?
