# GUERARD ASSERTS HE IS INURED TO COMICS BUT NOT TO POLITICS

"During my residence in America, 1
have been won over to ice cream and
the Sunday comic papers, but not to
the American party system," said Dr.
Albert Gu6rard, Professor of General
Literature, speaking before the last
meeting of the French Club. His topic,
"The Bloc System in French Politics,"
emphasized the differences of the po
litical systems in vogue in the United
States and France.
"In England and the United States
there are a series of political revolu
tions, while in France there is a steady
evolution, but a study of French politi
cal methods helps us to understand
our own,", he declared. The American
system is rigid and non-responsive, ac
cording to Professor Gu6rard, and we
vote for a man because he is a Repub
lican or a Democrat and not because
of his stand on some issue, while the
French parties are flexible.
Election of officers for the coming
year resulted in Dorothy Meade being
elected president and Lily Chloupek
secretary-treasurer.
