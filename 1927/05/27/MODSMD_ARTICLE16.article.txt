# EDUCATIONAL PROCESS DAMAGED BY USE OF EXAMS-DR. JORDAN
## Chancellor Emeritus Agrees With Wilbur on Lower Division Problem 
### 
"I don't think there ought to be any
marks, and there should be 110 exami
nations, except in languages that re
quire supervision," Dr. David Starr
Jordan declared in his address at the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
luncheon Wednesday. "There is no
telling how much damage has been
done to English education by examina
tions. for it is impossible to standard
ize individuals."
In discussing athletics Dr. Jordan
said: "Athletics are a part of educa
tion, but when athletics become.com
mercialized, as they have at present,
it is the public that gets educated, not
the students."
Tracing the growth of the junior
college movement, the Chancellor
Emeritus declared that he was in com
plete accord with President Wilbur's
efforts to have the lower division abol
ished, as Stanford desires a group of
ladies and gentlemen and not a mob.
"Yale, Harvard, and the other private
universities will have to follow us," he
explained.
The elimination of the lower divi
sion was first suggested by Dr. Jordan
in 1907, when he realized the desira
bility of concentrating on a specialized
line of work.
