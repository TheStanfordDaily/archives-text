j Coach Ernst Brandsten will use in the
! open 880-yard swim at Searsville at 2:30
o'clock Sunday afternoon. The others are

den Driggs.
From the Athens Club will be De Silva,
who gave Stevenson strong competition
at the Healdsburg, Russian River, race
last year. Although other entries are not

: a large number of fast starters.
| The course at Searsville is nearly 880
| yards, and in two legs. The swimmers
I will start from the beach, and will have
to sprint for the first fifty yards to the
j turn in order lo keep in the race. From
; the turn to the end of the course, the
I men will swim in a straight line.
