PHILADELPHIA, Pa„ May
26.—"1 can't see anything but
Stanford,"' Coach Dean Cromwell
of U.S.C. declared today in con
ceding the superiority of the
Cardinals over his Trojans in the
1.C.4-A meet.
"Of course, I think my men
have a chance to upset if anything
goes wrong with Stanford, but
on first glance it looks as though
"Dink" Templeton's men will
win in a walk. They ..should
score almost forty points, which
would be near a record."

Trials this afternoon and finals tomorrow
will pick the winner of the 'Inter
collegiate Association of Amateur Ath
letes of America when the fifty-first an
nual meet is run oiT at Franklin Field,
