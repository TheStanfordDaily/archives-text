PHILADELPHIA, Pa„ May
26.—"1 can't see anything but
Stanford,"' Coach Dean Cromwell
of U.S.C. declared today in con
ceding the superiority of the
Cardinals over his Trojans in the
1.C.4-A meet.
"Of course, I think my men
have a chance to upset if anything
goes wrong with Stanford, but
on first glance it looks as though
"Dink" Templeton's men will
win in a walk. They ..should
score almost forty points, which
would be near a record."

Trials this afternoon and finals tomorrow
will pick the winner of the 'Inter
collegiate Association of Amateur Ath
letes of America when the fifty-first an
nual meet is run oiT at Franklin Field,
Philadelphia.
Expefts all over the United States are
picking the Stanford team, under the.
able guidance of Coach Robert L. "Dink
Templeton, to take their first 1.C.4-A
title, some even predict that they will
set a new record in scoring for the meet.
Strong in Field
Stanford's strength in the field events,
coupled with four stellar performers in
the quarter-mile, the mile, and the high
and low hurdles, is expected to be suffi
cient to win the meet, with a possibility
that the team may run up a total of 40
points.
Seventeen men are at present in Phila
delphia. together with Coach Templeton,
Harry Maloney, Bill Ellington, and Track
Manager Lee McCulloeh. All of the
track and held men seem to be potential
scorers.
Captain-cle<stHud Spencer in the quar
ter-mile, Alex McKinnon in the mile,
and Clarence West and Ross Nichols in
the high and low hurdles, arc the track
men who are counted on for points. The
performances made by each one of these
men in competition put them on a par
with the best that any college or univer
sity in the United States can offer.
Hoffman Favorite
Stanford has four shotputters who have
all bettered the marks that won places
in this event last year. They also seem
to have the edge over most of the other
weight men.
Biff Hoffman is scheduled to win the
shot put as well as the discus throw.
Three Stanford sophomores, Forster,
Herb Fleishhacker, and Stew Way, will
also probably be among the point scor
ers. Taffy Evans has bettered 145 feet
in the discus throw, and stands a good
chance to place well up in this event.
The broad jump was won at 23 feet I
1 y 2 inches last year. Eastern jumpers are j
ail around this mark. With Fred Zom
bro clearing 24 feet inches, Kim
Dyer 24 feet inches, and Sid Meeks
capable of better than 24 feet, Stanford
should score several points here.
Competition in Javelin
The East has one man, Heally of
Princeton, who has thrown the javelin
190 feet. Stanford has two, Ted Ship
key and Bill Sparling. Boelter of U.S.C.
has a mark of 188 feet.

PHILADELPHIA, Pa„ May
26.—"1 can't see anything but
Stanford,"' Coach Dean Cromwell
of U.S.C. declared today in con
ceding the superiority of the
Cardinals over his Trojans in the
1.C.4-A meet.
"Of course, I think my men
have a chance to upset if anything
goes wrong with Stanford, but
on first glance it looks as though
"Dink" Templeton's men will
win in a walk. They ..should
score almost forty points, which
would be near a record."

Trials this afternoon and finals tomorrow
will pick the winner of the 'Inter
collegiate Association of Amateur Ath
letes of America when the fifty-first an
nual meet is run oiT at Franklin Field,
Philadelphia.
Expefts all over the United States are
picking the Stanford team, under the.
able guidance of Coach Robert L. "Dink
Templeton, to take their first 1.C.4-A
title, some even predict that they will
set a new record in scoring for the meet.
Strong in Field
Stanford's strength in the field events,
coupled with four stellar performers in
the quarter-mile, the mile, and the high
and low hurdles, is expected to be suffi
cient to win the meet, with a possibility
that the team may run up a total of 40
points.
Seventeen men are at present in Phila
delphia. together with Coach Templeton,
Harry Maloney, Bill Ellington, and Track
Manager Lee McCulloeh. All of the
track and held men seem to be potential
scorers.
Captain-cle<stHud Spencer in the quar
ter-mile, Alex McKinnon in the mile,
and Clarence West and Ross Nichols in
the high and low hurdles, arc the track
men who are counted on for points. The
performances made by each one of these
men in competition put them on a par
with the best that any college or univer
sity in the United States can offer.
Hoffman Favorite
Stanford has four shotputters who have
all bettered the marks that won places
in this event last year. They also seem
to have the edge over most of the other
weight men.
Biff Hoffman is scheduled to win the
shot put as well as the discus throw.
Three Stanford sophomores, Forster,
Herb Fleishhacker, and Stew Way, will
also probably be among the point scor
ers. Taffy Evans has bettered 145 feet
in the discus throw, and stands a good
chance to place well up in this event.
The broad jump was won at 23 feet I
1 y 2 inches last year. Eastern jumpers are j
ail around this mark. With Fred Zom
bro clearing 24 feet inches, Kim
Dyer 24 feet inches, and Sid Meeks
capable of better than 24 feet, Stanford
should score several points here.
Competition in Javelin
The East has one man, Heally of
Princeton, who has thrown the javelin
190 feet. Stanford has two, Ted Ship
key and Bill Sparling. Boelter of U.S.C.
has a mark of 188 feet.
