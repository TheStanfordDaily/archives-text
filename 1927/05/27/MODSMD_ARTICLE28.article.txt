# Another Love Affair
## 
### 
A national championship in a new sport is staring Stanford University
in the face this week. For last few years Miss Track Title has been
flirting with the Cardinal team, but the Redshirts have never quite lost
themselves so completely as to fall for her. But it is doubtful whether
the Stanford squad able to withstand the temptation this year.
The calling is too strong, and Stanford is tired of playing second man
to her brothers on the Coast.
/Mr. Stanford met a young person by the name of Miss Football Title
and became so attached to her that he went out and won her the first of
this year. }sut it's a matter of "off with the old love and on with the
new," for Stanford is out for further conquests.
The preliminaries of the Intercollegiate American Amateur Athletic
Association track meet are scheduled for this afternoon at Philadelphia.
Much depends on the showing of the Coast athletes in the heats, for it
is in the races that Stanford has to make good if the championship is to
be made sure. The lield men usually weather the trip fairly well and
are able to do their best, but it will be the points made by the runners
that will put Stanford over the top.
Captain-elect Spencer runs today in the quarter mile race, and West
and Nichols are competing in the hurdle events this afternoon. The way
in which these three men place, will have a strong bearing 011 Stanford's
success. The Coast Universities have sent many real middle-distance
men to Eastern meets before, but the trip on the train has always ruined
their chances. The hurdlers in the past have stood the journey better.
Coach Templeton's idea of sending Spencer and McKinnon to the scene
of the battle two weeks ahead of time, was to try to avoid this hoodoo
that has been following coast distance men to the East.
Tictories by the runners today will give the field men confidence when
they take up their part of the task tomorrow afternoon. Confidence is
valuable to athletes and especially to track and field athletes. It is of
particular value when the men are on foreign groundsvand appearing
before a rival crowd.
The Eastern papers predict that Stanford will capture the meet with
forty points, but the dopcsters are basing their predictions 011 the records
made by the Cards 011 their home track. If the men have become
acclimated to the Eastern weather and the Philadelphia field, they will
do as well in the East as they have on the Pacific Coast this season. And
the Stanford supporters have confidence in their athletes. They have
seen them come through*before.

men to Eastern meets before, but the trip on the train has always ruined
their chances. The hurdlers in the past have stood the journey better.
Coach Templeton's idea of sending Spencer and McKinnon to the scene
of the battle two weeks ahead of time, was to try to avoid this hoodoo
that has been following coast distance men to the East.
Tictories by the runners today will give the field men confidence when
they take up their part of the task tomorrow afternoon. Confidence is
valuable to athletes and especially to track and field athletes. It is of
particular value when the men are on foreign groundsvand appearing
before a rival crowd.
The Eastern papers predict that Stanford will capture the meet with
forty points, but the dopcsters are basing their predictions 011 the records
made by the Cards 011 their home track. If the men have become
acclimated to the Eastern weather and the Philadelphia field, they will
do as well in the East as they have on the Pacific Coast this season. And
the Stanford supporters have confidence in their athletes. They have
seen them come through*before.
A national championship in a new sport is staring Stanford University
in the face this week. For last few years Miss Track Title has been
flirting with the Cardinal team, but the Redshirts have never quite lost
themselves so completely as to fall for her. But it is doubtful whether
the Stanford squad able to withstand the temptation this year.
The calling is too strong, and Stanford is tired of playing second man
to her brothers on the Coast.
/Mr. Stanford met a young person by the name of Miss Football Title
and became so attached to her that he went out and won her the first of
this year. }sut it's a matter of "off with the old love and on with the
new," for Stanford is out for further conquests.
The preliminaries of the Intercollegiate American Amateur Athletic
Association track meet are scheduled for this afternoon at Philadelphia.
Much depends on the showing of the Coast athletes in the heats, for it
is in the races that Stanford has to make good if the championship is to
be made sure. The lield men usually weather the trip fairly well and
are able to do their best, but it will be the points made by the runners
that will put Stanford over the top.
Captain-elect Spencer runs today in the quarter mile race, and West
and Nichols are competing in the hurdle events this afternoon. The way
in which these three men place, will have a strong bearing 011 Stanford's
success. The Coast Universities have sent many real middle-distance
men to Eastern meets before, but the trip on the train has always ruined
their chances. The hurdlers in the past have stood the journey better.
