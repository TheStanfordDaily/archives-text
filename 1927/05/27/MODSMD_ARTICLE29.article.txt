It is indeed gratifying that women of the University have already
started definite action toward changing social regulations governing
themselves. That they have not allowed their first flurry of agitation to
die but have attacked the problem calmly and with a view to bettering
their interests in promoting responsible freedom indicates that the women
are ready to show their ability to legislate for themselves.
Although it is somewhat astounding that the women have until the
last few days confined their agitation to mere bull sessioning dissatisfac
tion with the present system and have not made their opinions effective
in action, we ran at least be happy that in reality some of them are
championing the cause of liberality.
\\ ©men's Conference is to be encouraged and aided in its formula
tion of new rnles. Living groups should give the entire problem of
women's regulations in all its phases their careful-consideration in order
that the true sentiment on such matters may be obtained. Those women
who feel the need of changes in regulations should come forth with
constructive suggestions. There is little excuse for a knocker who cannot
substitute something for the rule which he condemns.
