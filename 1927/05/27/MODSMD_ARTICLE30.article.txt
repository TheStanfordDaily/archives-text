Purging of the consciencc, as two children of Kansas's fertile plains
accomplished it, reported by the University Daily Kansan:
" 'We hope to graduate this year, and we want to leave with a clear
conscience,' began a mysterious note which was sinned 'Two Would-be Grads'
and delivered, along with a largo box, by a special messenger who gave the
address from which the box was sent and explained that it was for Dean
Agnes Husband.
"Within the box was a silver loving cup won by the Phi Phi's for excellence
in swimming and 'much cherished by the Pi Phi's since it was the only one
they had ever achieved.'
"To the Kappa's the erstwhile burglars returned a silver butter knife
'since they felt certain the Kappa's would want it in the new house, which had
been much advertised.'
"The Chi O's received a letter rack and an expression of hope that 'They
would continue to receive as many letters in the future as they had in the
past."
