FIVE HUNDRED VOICES
When five hundred women talk
about the same tiling at the same time
something is bound to occur. We de
duce, therefore, tiiat some change in
(lie lockout rules is imminent; for
when the women's conference last met
its members were advised to discuss
with the members of their living
groups certain suggestions regarding
proposed reforms in the regulations.
It is almost superfluous to mention
that not even the prospect of approach
ing finals can erase the rosy glow in
which wo became wrapped upon re
ceipt of the news of this favorable
action. Nor is it necessary to remark
that we shall throw our typewriter in
off the deep end if the women confine
their efforts to mere conversation.

I the living groups on the campus have
; amassed one hundred and fifty-five
j points apiece Only one event, the

LUCK ,VARSITY!
While the Betas and Breakers are
j competing for supremacy within the
i walls, the varsity begins its two-day
j contest for what is, for all practical
I purposes, the intercollegiate track and
field championship of the civilized
world. Only a break here or there is
needed to make the Cardinal team
victorious. May tomorrow's prelimi
naries see Lady Luck favoring the
varsity. â€”Stephen O'Donnell.
