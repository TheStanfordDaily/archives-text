# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sirrah:
Taking courage from the fact that
all about us traditions are falling with
dull, sickening thuds, the writer rises
hesitantly to his feet and proposes a
further much-needed eradication.
No doubt most of us have had occa
sion to wear (feminine) or to observe
(masculine) the- gymnasium "cos
tumes" of our women students. Those
ladies who have ever had courage
enough to survey themselves in a full
length mirror whilst wearing the
blooming affairs must have burst into
immediate and prolonged hysterics.
Our Savior never bore such a cross.
If our reader is a man, and has
never had the peculiar fortune to see
one of the "costumes," either gambol
ing about on the women's field or
escorting itself to Roble Hall, he is
advised to sneak over that way some
day and take a look at his fiancde on
the tennis courts. Another romance
will be shattered.'
Furthermore, the darned things
aren't feasible. How anyone can navi
gate in such a is beyond
understanding. The lower half of the
outfit —consisting of enough material
to shroud a good-sized coffin, fashioned
into what are popularly known as
bloomers —must be a terrible hind
rance when the wind is blowing. Pic
ture a three-masted schooner heading
into a gale under full canvas—voilk.
In the spirit of Patrick Henry, "If

this he Tradition, let us not boast of
it." Now, that's unanimous. We all
want the things abolished. Let us
abolish them.
Condensing, in conclusion, the above
observations, boiling them down so to
speak into their bitter residue, we
are able to ladle out the following epi
gram:
Beauty, Brains, and Bloomers do
not jibe. As the saying goes,
A Mere Man.

The Editor, Sir:
A great deal of that indefinable but
potent something called Public Opin
ion has been aroused recently on the
subject of women's lockout rules. Dis
content with the present regulations
has been expressed on all sides, but
so far no suggestions for remedying
them has been offered; it is with the
idea of offering some possible con
structive changes that I am writing
this letter.
In the first place, practically every
writer who has expressed his opinion
on the subject through these columns
has agreed that the hour set when
doors shall be locked makes no par
ticular difference. The question is,
should the University control them as
far as possible through lockout rules?
Many of us believe that as Stanford
women we are old enough and wise
enough to be able to take the re
sponsibility of our own conduct, and

since this is the case, the obnoxious
lockout might well be abolished alto
gether. Looking at the case from a
purely practical standpoint, however,
it is evident that lockouts will never
be entirely done away with during
our college career. All the forces of
present-day convention are against it,
Stanford is a privately endowed Uni
versity and Mrs. Stanford's wishes
would undoubtedly be construed as
being against such a measure, and
lastly, many of ihe women themselves
would not approve of it. Believing,
then, that because of outside influ
ences we cannot at present put our
ideas into force, I would recommend
certain measures that would make the
prevailing system less irritating.
Briefly, I should suggest that:
1. 11:30 p.m. be the hour for week
day lockouts except for first, quarter
freshmen for whom lockout hour
should be 10:30 p.m.
2. 1:30 leave be automatically grant
ed to everyone on Friday and Satur
(>:; nirhts, and that 2 o'clock lea/t
-he granted by permission of women's
council on special occasions.
3. Late leave be granted more freely
than heretofore to Upper Division
women.
4. Each woman should be allowed
lockouts amounting in the aggregate
to a specified length of time without
punishment of any kind either from
Women's Council or from her living
group.
The adoption of the above modifica
tions of the present lockout rules
would, I believe, do away with much
of the existing discontent among the
Women and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire
of campus authorities, the frown of
outraged convention, the curse of yel
low press publicity, or any other evil
that might possibly fall on our wall
meaning but evidently very, very
young and inexperienced heads. —'28.

The Editor, Sir:
A great deal of that indefinable but
potent something called Public Opin
ion has been aroused recently on the
subject of women's lockout rules. Dis
content with the present regulations
has been expressed on all sides, but
so far no suggestions for remedying
them has been offered; it is with the
idea of offering some possible con
structive changes that I am writing
this letter.
In the first place, practically every
writer who has expressed his opinion
on the subject through these columns
has agreed that the hour set when
doors shall be locked makes no par
ticular difference. The question is,
should the University control them as
far as possible through lockout rules?
Many of us believe that as Stanford
women we are old enough and wise
enough to be able to take the re
sponsibility of our own conduct, and

since this is the case, the obnoxious
lockout might well be abolished alto
gether. Looking at the case from a
purely practical standpoint, however,
it is evident that lockouts will never
be entirely done away with during
our college career. All the forces of
present-day convention are against it,
Stanford is a privately endowed Uni
versity and Mrs. Stanford's wishes
would undoubtedly be construed as
being against such a measure, and
lastly, many of ihe women themselves
would not approve of it. Believing,
then, that because of outside influ
ences we cannot at present put our
ideas into force, I would recommend
certain measures that would make the
prevailing system less irritating.
Briefly, I should suggest that:
1. 11:30 p.m. be the hour for week
day lockouts except for first, quarter
freshmen for whom lockout hour
should be 10:30 p.m.
2. 1:30 leave be automatically grant
ed to everyone on Friday and Satur
(>:; nirhts, and that 2 o'clock lea/t
-he granted by permission of women's
council on special occasions.
3. Late leave be granted more freely
than heretofore to Upper Division
women.
4. Each woman should be allowed
lockouts amounting in the aggregate
to a specified length of time without
punishment of any kind either from
Women's Council or from her living
group.
The adoption of the above modifica
tions of the present lockout rules
would, I believe, do away with much
of the existing discontent among the
Women and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire
of campus authorities, the frown of
outraged convention, the curse of yel
low press publicity, or any other evil
that might possibly fall on our wall
meaning but evidently very, very
young and inexperienced heads. —'28.
The Editor, Sirrah:
Taking courage from the fact that
all about us traditions are falling with

hesitantly to his feet and proposes a
further much-needed eradication.
No doubt most of us have had occa
sion to wear (feminine) or to observe
(masculine) the- gymnasium "cos

gate in such a is beyond
understanding. The lower half of the
outfit —consisting of enough material
to shroud a good-sized coffin, fashioned
into what are popularly known as
bloomers —must be a terrible hind
rance when the wind is blowing. Pic
ture a three-masted schooner heading
into a gale under full canvas—voilk.
In the spirit of Patrick Henry, "If

this he Tradition, let us not boast of
it." Now, that's unanimous. We all
want the things abolished. Let us
abolish them.
Condensing, in conclusion, the above
observations, boiling them down so to
speak into their bitter residue, we
are able to ladle out the following epi
gram:
Beauty, Brains, and Bloomers do
not jibe. As the saying goes,
A Mere Man.

The Editor, Sir:
A great deal of that indefinable but
potent something called Public Opin
ion has been aroused recently on the
subject of women's lockout rules. Dis
content with the present regulations
has been expressed on all sides, but
so far no suggestions for remedying
them has been offered; it is with the
idea of offering some possible con
structive changes that I am writing
this letter.
In the first place, practically every
writer who has expressed his opinion
on the subject through these columns
has agreed that the hour set when
doors shall be locked makes no par
ticular difference. The question is,
should the University control them as
far as possible through lockout rules?
Many of us believe that as Stanford
women we are old enough and wise
enough to be able to take the re
sponsibility of our own conduct, and

since this is the case, the obnoxious
lockout might well be abolished alto
gether. Looking at the case from a
purely practical standpoint, however,
it is evident that lockouts will never
be entirely done away with during
our college career. All the forces of
present-day convention are against it,
Stanford is a privately endowed Uni
versity and Mrs. Stanford's wishes
would undoubtedly be construed as
being against such a measure, and
lastly, many of ihe women themselves
would not approve of it. Believing,
then, that because of outside influ
ences we cannot at present put our
ideas into force, I would recommend
certain measures that would make the
prevailing system less irritating.
Briefly, I should suggest that:
1. 11:30 p.m. be the hour for week
day lockouts except for first, quarter
freshmen for whom lockout hour
should be 10:30 p.m.
2. 1:30 leave be automatically grant
ed to everyone on Friday and Satur
(>:; nirhts, and that 2 o'clock lea/t
-he granted by permission of women's
council on special occasions.
3. Late leave be granted more freely
than heretofore to Upper Division
women.
4. Each woman should be allowed
lockouts amounting in the aggregate
to a specified length of time without
punishment of any kind either from
Women's Council or from her living
group.
The adoption of the above modifica
tions of the present lockout rules
would, I believe, do away with much
of the existing discontent among the
Women and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire
of campus authorities, the frown of
outraged convention, the curse of yel
low press publicity, or any other evil
that might possibly fall on our wall
meaning but evidently very, very
young and inexperienced heads. —'28.
