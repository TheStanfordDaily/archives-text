# BERKELEY PROFESSOR PERFECTS SMALLPOX VACCINATION METHOD
## 
### 
Another step in the perfection of
vaccination methods against smallpox,
which re-establishes the usefulness of
an immunity test perfected at the Uni
versity of California some years ago,
has just been announced by Professor
J. N. Force, Chairman of the Depart
ment of Hygiene on the Berkeley cam
pus, through the United States Public
Health Service.
Professor Force has found that by
the utilization of a special method of
vaccination, known as the intradermal
process, because it requires injection
of the vaccine between skin layers
without the commonly known scratch
ing or drill scarification, and utiliza
tion of a heated as well as the usual
cold solution of the vaccine, it is pos
sible to determine which persons are
immune to the disease within forty
eight hours after vaccination.
This determination is made on the
basis of an immediate reaction or
hypersensitiveness which is peculiar
to cases where a natural or previously
induced immunity is present. In place
of developing normally over a period
of nine days, the vaccination sore be
comes inflamed and red within twenty
four hours, and reaches its maximum
development in forty-eight hours. Pre
viously it was customary to revacci
nate perhaps several times before such
cases were definitely pronounced im
mune.
