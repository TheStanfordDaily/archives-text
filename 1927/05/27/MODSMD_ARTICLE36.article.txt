LAWRENCE, Kansas, May 22. —
(I.P.) —Seventeen students at the Uni
versity of Kansas have issued a vigor
ous protest against Dr. Sutton, who
lectured on the subject of India re
cently, on the grounds that he grossly
misrepresented the culture of the na
tion and insulted their fellow citizens.
The Indian students declare that
the speaker had only spent two weeks
in their native land and was unable to
study carefully in that time the char
acteristics of the nation.
"Dr. Sutton was representing the
bad side of India throughout his lec
ture," declared Anup S. Dhillon,
spokesman for the Hindus. "We could
go back to India and represent the al
most equally bad side of America if
we wished, but we know that there is
a good side also. Dr. Sutton overlooked
the good side of India."
