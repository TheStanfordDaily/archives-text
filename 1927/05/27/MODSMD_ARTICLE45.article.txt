# US. NICARAGUA ATTITUDE LEGITIMATE-MARTIN FEAR OF ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM EXAGGERATED SOLIDARITY OF SOUTHERN REPUBLICS GROWING
## 
### 
"Fear of United States economic im
perialism in South America has' been
exaggerated," stated Professor Percy
A. Martin of the Stanford History de
partment on the subject of the rela
tion between the United States and
Latin America.
Solidarity Growing
Commenting on an article which ap
peared in the New York Times Book
Review for May 8, "In Latin America
Nationalism is now the Watchword,"
Professor Martiu pointed out that a
growth of nationalism accompanied by
an increased feeling of solidarity
among the Hispanic-American coun
tries against any attempt at dictation
from without has been taking place
for a long time. This has been aug
mented by the attitude of the United
States.
The New York Times article cites
Bix recent books which express a
growing distrust of our policy toward
the Southern Republics. They indicate
that South America is afraid of our
economic imperialism and that Central
America fears our political expansion.
"It is only fair to state that these
yriters, though voicing the sentiments

of certain circles, do not necessarily
reflect the attitude of South America
as a whole," Martin asserts. "Brazil,
Uruguay, and Peru are friendly to the
United States, Argentina is less so,
whereas there is a certain suspicion
and hostility in Chili.
Less Interference, the Better
"In the main, our policy toward
South America has been legitimate,
but our interference in the affairs
north of the Isthmus is unfortunate.
The less we have to do with the in
ternal affairs of these countries the
better for the interests of both the
United States and the Carribbean re
publics.
"The South American papers are as
full of the Nicaragua situation as are
our own. They resent our interference
there. Some of the South Americans
are especially perturbed at the enor
mous expansion of loans, aggregating
to nearly one million dollars, which
have been floated in the United States
since the war. They fear that this may
be virtually a mortgage on the re
sources of the countries."
Professor Martin thinks that there
is no immediate danger of this.
