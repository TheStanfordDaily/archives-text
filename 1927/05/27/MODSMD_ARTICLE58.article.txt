# ORDER OF THE COIF INSTALLED RECENTLY ON BERKELEY CAMPUS
## 
### 
The Order of the Coif, legal honor
ary society, has been recently installed
at the University of California, with
fifteen charter members. Twenty-four
chapters of the order are now in exis
tence, one of which is at Stanford.
Election to the society, the highest
honor of the law school, is restricted
to the highest ten per cent of the
senior class in law.
The English Order of the Coif was
the most ancient and one of the most
honored institutions of the common
law; it probably antedated the Nor
man conquest. It was an association of
lawyers, never large, from whose
members exclusively the judges of the
court of common pleas were appointed
and who for centuries had the sole
right to appear as barristers in that
court.
The roll of members of the Coif in
cludes the names of many of the
greatest lawyers and judges in Eng
lish history, including Coke, Littleton,
Bacon, Blackstone, Blackburn, and
Coleridge.
The American Order of the Coif is
an outgrowth of earlier society, Theta
Kappa Nu, founded at Illinois in 1002.
In 1911 Theta Kappa Nu in a national
convention changed its name to the
"Order of the Coif."
