# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Back in 1919 a young athlete named
Carl Johnson won four first places
for the University of Michigan in the
annual Rig Ten Conference track meet.
His performances, made all the more
remarkable by the fact that there were
heats to be run in the hurdle races,
were as follows: high jump, 6 feet,
2\'\ inches; broad jump, 24 feet, 1
inch; 120-yard high hurdles, 15 and
two fifth seconds; 220-yard low
hurdles, 25 seconds.
Unless I am mistaken, no other
man has ever won four first places
in the Western Conference meet.
Alvin Kraenzlein won three firsts and
one second in the I C 4 A meet in 1899,
in itself a wonderful fedt. In these

; days of specialization, such records
i seldom occur, with the exception of
performances by iron-men like Paavo
Nurmi and Harold Osborn. But in
this year's Western Conference meet,
| to be held today and tomorrow, there
i are two remarkable all-around per
i formers who stand a fine chance of
: finishing first in at least three events.
I* Captain Charles McGinnis, of the
j University of Wisconsin, and Capt.
I Phil Northrup, of Michigan, both want
I to complete their college athletic
careers in a blaze of glory. Both
; athletes have built up enviable reputa
i tions as fine all-around performers,
! and each would like to help his uni
versity win the 1927 Big Ten meet by

grabbing off fifteen points in tomor
row's events. Charley McGinnis did
this in the indoor Conference meet at
Evanston, winning the 60-yard high
hurdles in time only one-tenth of a
second more than the world's record;
vaulting 12 feet, 10 inches; and set
ting a new record in the Irish jump
at 6 feet, 5 inches. He also won the

all-around test at the Illinois Relays.
Phil Northrup, who won the javelin
throw at the Penn Relays in April,
fared better than Iris rival in the f92G
Big Ten meet. He won the place in the
pole vault at 12 feet, 9V& inches; and
placed third in the broad jump with a
leap of more than 23 feet. McGinnis
tied for third place in the high jump,

and tied for fourth in the pole vault.
He has developed a since then,
and should equal Northrup's last year's
performance today and tomorrow.
