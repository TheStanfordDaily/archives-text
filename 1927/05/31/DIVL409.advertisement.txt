YOU *
The Graduating Seniors
Are facing the question

"WHAT TO DO
NEXT"
Some of you are well fixed; you
have a family business to work
with. It will be to your interest
to think about the new develop
ment, Group Insurance, which will
be a factor of increasing impor
tance in the relations of your
business to its employees.
Some of you have a decided bent,
and are going to follow it. One
way of making sure that you will
finish the course of life you have
chosen is to take advantage of
Annuity, Endowment, and Straight
Life Insurance.
Some of you have worked for
your education and must earn as
much money as you can, as quickly
as possible. The selling of Life
Insurance gives the most and
quickest return for hard work; it
aho offers the greatest freedom for
original enterprise. It is not a
push-button job. The John Han
cock is looking for men like you
and would like to hear from you.
Write to us in regard to any of
these points. We shall answer
your inquiries without any ob
ligation to you. Address the
INQUIRY BUREAU.
