# STANFORD TRACK TEAM INS NATIONAL TITLE AT I.C.A.A.A.A. COMPETITION IN PHILADELPHIA
## Cardinals Favored to Keep Championship Trophy For Another Year ONLY FOUR MEN LOST Other Representatives Are Either Sophomores Or Juniors 
### A. H 
Stanford's much-heralded track team j
came through last Saturday to win 36/> j
points in the I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet at I
Philadelphia and the track championship
of America, evidenced by a large and
handsome silver trophy which will be the
pride of students, faculty, alumni, and
relatives for at least one year.
A casual glance at the roster of Cardi
nal point winners would indicate, more
over, that the chances are excellent for j
Stanford to keep the trophy for at least
another year, since Hoffman, Evans,
Shipkey, West, and Mocks are the only
men lost to the team, in fact, with the
exception of King and Dyer, the rest of
the 1.C.4-A representatives from Stan
ford are only sophomores, and three of i
the five who just failed fo qualify also I
claim only one year's experience on the |
varsity. With such an array of talent
available next year, under the tutelage!
of "Dink" Tcmpleton, who has been com-j
ing nearer the coveted championship every |
year of his coaching career, it looks as if !
Stanford could well say "What Price!
Track Titles ?"
How It Happened
How did Stanford win the trophy with J
only one first place, and that in the discus, j
due to the efforts of one Biff Hoffman? j
By the simple expedient of annexing five j
third places, four fourth-place points, one j
second and a tie for another, and one ]
fifth place. That's power, even if the!
Cardinals failed to have a finger ir
I breaking the four meet records and tin
one world's, record which fell with re
sounding thuds.
The 220 record was accompanied by tlit
loudest crash, when Borah of U.S.C
stepped the furlong in 20,y seconds, break
i ing a record which had stood for thirty
! one long years. Sabin Carr of Yale
vaulted fourteen feet to fame and a
| world's record, not to mention a big meet
record. The broad jump and javelin were
j the other events in which comparatively
I recent records fell.
Cards Score in Field
Stanford figured heavily in the point
: column in the field events, placing in all
J but the hammer throw, which is not
scheduled on the Coast, collecting 2 c ) l />
: points there with only seven on the track.
Although West, Nichols, Spencer, and
Work failed to perform as well as was
expected, the remarkable showing of Ed
monds iu the pole vault and the consistent
performances of Shipkey, Meeks, Hoff
man, Forster, and Way made up for their
j deficiency.
Edmonds vaulted 13 feet 6 inches to
take third place in his event, this being
3 inches higher than he has ever gone
before. From just a good pole vaulter,
"Dink" has developed him into one of
the best. Although Sid Meeks almost
failed to make the trip, he beat out the
rest of the home competition in the broad
jump. Taffy Evans failed to place in the
Big Meet this year or win against U.S.C,
but has now earned a block "S" by taking
fourth in the shot. Shipkey and Forster
were both consistent, annexing thirds in
their events. McKinnon came through in
line style with a fourth in the mile, which
was won in the excellent time of 4: 21
2-10.
Hurdlers Slow
Although West won the fastest heat to
qualify in the semi-finals of the low
hurdles, he was left out in the finals.
Nichols taking only a third in the high
hurdles, with West fourth, with the win
ning time 14 8-10 seconds. Both men have
made the distance in that time on the
Coast this year.
King tailed to win the high jump but
tied for second with Coggeshall of U.S.C.,
whom he beat in the dual meet here.
The winning leap was 6 feet A/z inches
which is usually simple for him to nego
tiate. Gerkin beat out Hoffman in the
shot, hut the latter won the discus with a
splendid throw of 150 feet 7 inches. Phil
lips, of California, who took second, was
almost six feet behind him.
The qualifying time in Spencer's semi
final heat in the 440, in which he was
eliminated, was 49 7-10 seconds, much
slower than Spencer is capable of run
ning.
Zonibro and Dyer were consistent in
the broad jump. All five men placing iu
that event leaped over 24 feet.

eliminated, was 49 7-10 seconds, much
slower than Spencer is capable of run
ning.
Zonibro and Dyer were consistent in
the broad jump. All five men placing iu
that event leaped over 24 feet.
Stanford's much-heralded track team j
came through last Saturday to win 36/> j
points in the I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet at I
Philadelphia and the track championship
of America, evidenced by a large and
handsome silver trophy which will be the
pride of students, faculty, alumni, and
relatives for at least one year.
A casual glance at the roster of Cardi
nal point winners would indicate, more
over, that the chances are excellent for j
Stanford to keep the trophy for at least
another year, since Hoffman, Evans,
Shipkey, West, and Mocks are the only
men lost to the team, in fact, with the
exception of King and Dyer, the rest of
the 1.C.4-A representatives from Stan
ford are only sophomores, and three of i
the five who just failed fo qualify also I
claim only one year's experience on the |
varsity. With such an array of talent
available next year, under the tutelage!
of "Dink" Tcmpleton, who has been com-j
ing nearer the coveted championship every |
year of his coaching career, it looks as if !
Stanford could well say "What Price!
Track Titles ?"
How It Happened
How did Stanford win the trophy with J
only one first place, and that in the discus, j
due to the efforts of one Biff Hoffman? j
By the simple expedient of annexing five j
third places, four fourth-place points, one j
second and a tie for another, and one ]
fifth place. That's power, even if the!
Cardinals failed to have a finger ir
I breaking the four meet records and tin
one world's, record which fell with re
sounding thuds.
The 220 record was accompanied by tlit
loudest crash, when Borah of U.S.C
stepped the furlong in 20,y seconds, break
i ing a record which had stood for thirty
! one long years. Sabin Carr of Yale
vaulted fourteen feet to fame and a
| world's record, not to mention a big meet
record. The broad jump and javelin were
j the other events in which comparatively
I recent records fell.
Cards Score in Field
Stanford figured heavily in the point
: column in the field events, placing in all
J but the hammer throw, which is not
scheduled on the Coast, collecting 2 c ) l />
: points there with only seven on the track.
Although West, Nichols, Spencer, and
Work failed to perform as well as was
expected, the remarkable showing of Ed
monds iu the pole vault and the consistent
performances of Shipkey, Meeks, Hoff
man, Forster, and Way made up for their
j deficiency.
Edmonds vaulted 13 feet 6 inches to
take third place in his event, this being
3 inches higher than he has ever gone
before. From just a good pole vaulter,
"Dink" has developed him into one of
the best. Although Sid Meeks almost
failed to make the trip, he beat out the
rest of the home competition in the broad
jump. Taffy Evans failed to place in the
Big Meet this year or win against U.S.C,
but has now earned a block "S" by taking
fourth in the shot. Shipkey and Forster
were both consistent, annexing thirds in
their events. McKinnon came through in
line style with a fourth in the mile, which
was won in the excellent time of 4: 21
2-10.
Hurdlers Slow
Although West won the fastest heat to
qualify in the semi-finals of the low
hurdles, he was left out in the finals.
Nichols taking only a third in the high
hurdles, with West fourth, with the win
ning time 14 8-10 seconds. Both men have
made the distance in that time on the
Coast this year.
King tailed to win the high jump but
tied for second with Coggeshall of U.S.C.,
whom he beat in the dual meet here.
The winning leap was 6 feet A/z inches
which is usually simple for him to nego
tiate. Gerkin beat out Hoffman in the
shot, hut the latter won the discus with a
splendid throw of 150 feet 7 inches. Phil
lips, of California, who took second, was

The qualifying time in Spencer's semi
final heat in the 440, in which he was
eliminated, was 49 7-10 seconds, much
slower than Spencer is capable of run
ning.
Zonibro and Dyer were consistent in
the broad jump. All five men placing iu
that event leaped over 24 feet.
Stanford's much-heralded track team j
came through last Saturday to win 36/> j
points in the I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet at I
Philadelphia and the track championship
of America, evidenced by a large and
handsome silver trophy which will be the
pride of students, faculty, alumni, and
relatives for at least one year.
A casual glance at the roster of Cardi
nal point winners would indicate, more
over, that the chances are excellent for j
Stanford to keep the trophy for at least
another year, since Hoffman, Evans,
Shipkey, West, and Mocks are the only
men lost to the team, in fact, with the
exception of King and Dyer, the rest of
the 1.C.4-A representatives from Stan
ford are only sophomores, and three of i
the five who just failed fo qualify also I
claim only one year's experience on the |
varsity. With such an array of talent
available next year, under the tutelage!
of "Dink" Tcmpleton, who has been com-j
ing nearer the coveted championship every |
year of his coaching career, it looks as if !
Stanford could well say "What Price!
Track Titles ?"
How It Happened
How did Stanford win the trophy with J
only one first place, and that in the discus, j
due to the efforts of one Biff Hoffman? j
By the simple expedient of annexing five j
third places, four fourth-place points, one j
second and a tie for another, and one ]
fifth place. That's power, even if the!
Cardinals failed to have a finger ir
I breaking the four meet records and tin
one world's, record which fell with re
sounding thuds.
The 220 record was accompanied by tlit
loudest crash, when Borah of U.S.C
stepped the furlong in 20,y seconds, break
i ing a record which had stood for thirty
! one long years. Sabin Carr of Yale
vaulted fourteen feet to fame and a
| world's record, not to mention a big meet
record. The broad jump and javelin were
j the other events in which comparatively
I recent records fell.
Cards Score in Field
Stanford figured heavily in the point
: column in the field events, placing in all
J but the hammer throw, which is not
scheduled on the Coast, collecting 2 c ) l />
: points there with only seven on the track.
Although West, Nichols, Spencer, and
Work failed to perform as well as was
expected, the remarkable showing of Ed
monds iu the pole vault and the consistent
performances of Shipkey, Meeks, Hoff
man, Forster, and Way made up for their
j deficiency.
Edmonds vaulted 13 feet 6 inches to
take third place in his event, this being
3 inches higher than he has ever gone
before. From just a good pole vaulter,
"Dink" has developed him into one of
the best. Although Sid Meeks almost
failed to make the trip, he beat out the
rest of the home competition in the broad
jump. Taffy Evans failed to place in the
Big Meet this year or win against U.S.C,
but has now earned a block "S" by taking
fourth in the shot. Shipkey and Forster
were both consistent, annexing thirds in
their events. McKinnon came through in
line style with a fourth in the mile, which
was won in the excellent time of 4: 21
2-10.
Hurdlers Slow
Although West won the fastest heat to
qualify in the semi-finals of the low
hurdles, he was left out in the finals.
Nichols taking only a third in the high
hurdles, with West fourth, with the win
ning time 14 8-10 seconds. Both men have
made the distance in that time on the
Coast this year.
King tailed to win the high jump but
tied for second with Coggeshall of U.S.C.,
whom he beat in the dual meet here.
The winning leap was 6 feet A/z inches
which is usually simple for him to nego
tiate. Gerkin beat out Hoffman in the
shot, hut the latter won the discus with a
splendid throw of 150 feet 7 inches. Phil
lips, of California, who took second, was
almost six feet behind him.
The qualifying time in Spencer's semi
final heat in the 440, in which he was
eliminated, was 49 7-10 seconds, much
slower than Spencer is capable of run
ning.
Zonibro and Dyer were consistent in
the broad jump. All five men placing iu
that event leaped over 24 feet.
