### 
The cast for "So 1 his Is London,
senior farce by Arthur Goodrich to be
presented on June 15, has finally been
assembled by Gordon Davis, director, and
has held almost constant rehearsals dur
ing the week-end.
Davis took practically all of last week
to choose the cast after changing the play
from "Mrs. Partridge Presents" to this
production; he used as many of the origi
nal players as fitted the various character
requirements of "So This Is London' and
chose others to fill out the cast, so that
rehearsals are now running smoothly.
Sarah Margaret Burns has the leading
part and Leonard Schwartz the juvenile
lead. The complete list of players fol
lows :

Hiraiji Draper, Sr., John A twill; Mrs.
Draper, Louise Buxton; Hiram Draper,
Jr., Leonard Schwartz; Elinor Beau
champ, Sarah Margaret Burns; Lord
Beaurhamp, Howard Wickcrsham ; Lady
Beauchamp, Barbara Frick; Mr. Honey
cutt, George Mauser; Thomas, Dave Stol
lery; Flunkey, Douglas Gregg; Jennings,
Robert Scares.
"Mrs. Partridge Presents," the play
originally selected for the Senior Week
event, wa sdiscarded for "So This Is
London," as the latter more appropriately
fills the "farce'' theme desired. Notice
that the Garrick comedy could be pro
duced by the Stanford Dramatic Council
did not reach Davis until a cast had al
ready been chosen for the contemplated
production.
