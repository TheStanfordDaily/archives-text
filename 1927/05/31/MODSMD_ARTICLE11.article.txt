## 
### 
Several fraternity and sorority |
houses will offer rooms and board to j
summer quarter students, according to
reports being received by Director
John A. Sellards. Sellards has sent out !
a circular letter of inquiry in an en
deavor to gather exact information on
the subject for prospective students j
next term.
The Beta Tlieta Pi house will take
lodgers and will serve meals to out- j
siders as well as to those who live in i
the house. The Phi Kappa Sigma house 1
will be open for the members or the
fraternity.
Several sorority houses will prob
ably be open to non-member women,
but* so far only Pi Beta Phi has noti
fied Director Sellards definitely that it
will not close.
Branner Hall and the Old and New
Union will be open for men roomers,
with Encina available if there is need.
For women Roble will be open and
Manzanita also if there are more
women than can be cared for else
where.
Although there is not yet any basis
for exact estimates, indications are
that there will be a considerably
larger attendance of regular Stanford
students this year than in any pre
vious summer quarter.
