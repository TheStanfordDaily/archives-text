says the Old Boy, "it's peculiarly right
that the momentous question of why
women don't contribute more to Cha
parral be brought up." He stroked the
long gray beard-that-Chaparral-made
famous and smiled paternally.
"To date there are not more than
five or six feminine contributors on
the campus. On the part of our Stan
lord women there seems to be a sort
of fear of sending contributions to
Chaparral. As a matter of fact we are
exceptionally eager to see more of
their work. Their predecessors—Al
loiip Thorpe. '20, and Janice Dunker
Pershing, '22, turned out some of the
best stuff we've had."
"It" there are women who are inter
ested in the executive and business
side of Chaparral, there is a place for
them as office assistants, also," he
continued. "If women work in these
lines —contributions, and office, there
is the recompense in their possible
election to honorary membership in
Hammer and Coffin, an honor the
greater because it is infrequent."
The Old Boy raised his hand pro
phetically. "Let's make next year the
time that Stanford women will put the
feminine touch to Chaparral!"
