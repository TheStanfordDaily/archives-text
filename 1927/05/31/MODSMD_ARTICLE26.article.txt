# AUTHOR RECOMMENDS NEWSPAPER TRAINING FOR FUTURE WRITERS
## Gertrude Atherton, Popular Novelist of California, Honored by Tea 
### 
"Work on a newspaper, get married,
i or go on the stage if you want to write
novels," advised Gertrude Atherton,
| famous California novelist, speaking
at a tea given in her honor Saturday
; afternoon under the auspices of Theta
! Sigma Phi, women's national journal
! istic fraternity, and the newly organ
i ized student auxiliary of the Santa
i Clara Branch of the Penwomen.
"There are plenty of clever women
I who can write, Mrs. Atherton declared,
i "but the trouble is that they don't
, know anything. The very best thing
i for a woman to do if she is interested
j in writing is to go into a newspaper
i office for a year not as a feature writ
j er or a critic, but as just a plain re
j porter. You make splendid contacts
i in journalistic work, and you usually
[ get all fiif nonsense knocked out of
: you. But don't stay with it too long,"
she warned; "a year is long enough."
"If you don't want to report for a
newspaper, the next best thing to do
is to get married," Mrs. Atherton
says. "Then you get a man's view
point as well as your own. Playing on
the stage is good, too, but it is apt to
be pretty narrow," she said.
"College courses can help you in
writing," the speaker explained. "Al
though the large majority of writers
never studied anything, if you would
be really first class you must have a
finely organized mind. Logic, mathe
matics, and philosophy are the best
things you can take."
"But nobody can be taught to write
a novel," Mrs. Atherton concluded.
; "You can be taught the technique, but
! there must be something in you that
i keeps your book up and sustains in-
I terest in the characters to the end."
