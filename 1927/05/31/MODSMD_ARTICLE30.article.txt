# Where Isolation Is Narrowing

"At Stanford we are suffering too much from an isolated calm
—there is a real danger that the Stanford Farm will raise only
contented cows."
Though this statement when made merely aroused a bit of
laughter among most students, there are others who are inclined
to agree that the danger pointed out is without doubt a grave one
—for many Stanford students arc submerged in just such a calm—
a calm which prevails not only on the Stanford campus, but one
which may be found at many colleges. In the case of Stanford,
however, entire intellectual, social, and economic independence
and her peculiar self-sufficiency as an artificial community make
her more susceptible to a serenity and self-satisfaction not so
pronounced in other universities.
While there are real advantages in Stanford's compactness end
isolation in such matters of housing and classrooms, the disadvan
tages cannot be overlooked. Her conveniences are indeed superior
to those of other universities, for not only does the Farm have its
own buildings and plently of land, but it has its own water supply,
its own corporation yards where supplies of all sorts are handled,
including bookstore materials, hardware, supplies, lumber, and
nearly every commodity necessary for the mechanical upkeep of
the University housing facilities and University building and office
equipment. In all, Stanford is quite self-sufficient; most of her
students find it unnecessary to keep their fingers on the pulse of
commercial reality. They are apart from the world and revolve in
a sphere of their own.
Inasmuch as Stanford is a community, whose members are
living, working, playing together all on one Farm, it is not surpris
ing that the group is not confronted with grave difficulties socially.
There is no necessity for students to push themselves forward, for
they are thrown together by circumstances; they are not forced to
seek companionship. Community life has its advantages in that it
makes for security and unity, but it also has its disadvantages in
that it fosters provincialism and a self-sufficiency which is any
thing but broadening in its influence.
Intellectually, Stanford is self-sufficient and isolated, for al
though scholars of international reputation are on her faculty, her
students take these men for granted, attend lectures and know
little or nothing about their professors' universal outlook. In
ether words, students arc taking bouk knowledge, since the general
apathetic student attitude invites little such discussion from the
faculty. In other words, students are taking prepared knowledge
from their professors in the sole effort to earn grades and units
for a degree.
Isolation in the University fosters an isolation among the stu
dents themselves, for they think only of personal gain; they are
uninterested in the social and psychological problems of civiliza
tion confronting the world as a whole. And it is a surprising and
a disappointing fact that university students who arc heralded as
the leaders of tomorrow should be so oblivious to the present-day
world in its entirety. It is unfortunate that a university should
serve to narrow and not to broaden its students' outlook.
