# From the Editor's Wastebasket....

What has become of the golf course
agitation? Are there no supporters to
investigate the problem of such a
course? Action comes only when
there are active enthusiasts ready to
assume the responsibility for the de
velopment of their pet project.
Considering both the vast amount
of time spent in almost useless ac
tivity in clubs of somewhat ill-defined
purpose, and the accompanying ner
vous tension of those students who
go in for "activities," there should be
little wonder at the cries of 'too many
clubs," "Stanford is over-organized."
Now the question of winter quarter
rushing for women is under advise
ment, we trust that the feminists will
give this phase of women's problems
as judicious consideration as has been
given in the open discussion of new
women's social regulations.
However apparent the large extent
of dissatisfaction and discontent
among students at Stanford may be,
it is probably only an indication of
the youthful-restlessness to be found
anywhere among persons of college
age. Hov.'ever, it is not useless ad
vice to remind the seniors that now
is the time they should find some sort
of balance and serenity of outlook,
some steadiness of purpose, before
they are thrown on their own re
sources in the world.
Students who are aware of the
large number of fraternity men as
well as possible hall men living in
groups in private houses may well ask
if this moving out of University sur
roundings is not an indication of an
attempt to avoid the artificial com
munity of Stanford lifeâ€”in fact, an
indication of the desire for independ
ence from brotherhood and hall con
tact.
To the coming sophomore class an
editor hardly dares refuse advice, for
the babes resent an attempt to over
look their approaching emancipation
into the sophomoric stage. It is use
less to warn them to avoid the stage
of sophomorism; they have looked
forward to it for too many months.
We only hope it attacks them lightly.
Although the Board of Athletic
Control has been receiving an unfair
amount of criticism, there seems jus
tification for asking the following
question: Why, inasmuch as the wom
en of the University and their friends
contribute so materially to the gate
receipt profits of the Board of Ath
letic Control, do they receive only
approximately $250 a quarter for their
physical cutiLdiioii needs?
Not daring to slight the junior class
by omitting it from the wastebasket
scraps, may we ask them to avoid the
mistakes of the outgoing class and to
remember that their possibilities of
achievement are always greater than
the accomplishments of their prede
cessors.
