# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
Dear Bull Session:
\\ hile 1 don't pretend to be very much
up in the ways of society, 1 think we
ought to maintain the traditions of the
school. Now in this matter of corsages
for women —who ever heard of a Stan
ford man .sending a Stanford woman a
corsage? It's like the honor system—one
never does it.
In the second place, Stanford women
(the 500) should he willing to accept'
Stanford men as they are—who could
have any respect for a woman if he had
to "buy" the notice of a woman? We men
at Stanford hate to "bid" for a woman's
attention. It puts dating too much on a
monetary basis. It isn't that we can't
afford it—it's the principle of tlie tiling,
you understand.
There are many men on the Stanford
campus who are troubled with that spring
time affliction known as "hay fever."
Often men do not give women corsages
for this very reason—they believe that
women, too, are afflicted with this malady.
It seems that the time lias come for the
men to assert themselves since the women
of this campus have emancipated them
selves to a point of intolerance.
We men have got to organize, and from
recent discussions I have heard I believe
these conclusion 1 ": We do NOT believe in
corsages for Stanford women—it cheap
ens them—we want to regard them as
our sisters. Imports are something yet
again. We want to treat women as they
should expect to be treated.
Seriously,
