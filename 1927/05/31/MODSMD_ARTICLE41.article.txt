A glance at the Campus Opinion col
umn will bring to the mind of the reader
a public discussion of a topic that lias
already been thoroughly discussed in pri
vate the question of corsages tor Staii
ford women, at Stanford dances, with
Stanford men. This is only a local phase
of a condition that prevails throughout
the country and that has at one time or
another prevailed throughout the larger
part of the civilized world. On our cam
pus the custom of dragging flowerless
women to campus brawls is deeply rooted
in the tradition of University life.
The fact is, this is a problem that in
volves serious economic, physiological,
ethical, and esthetic phases. As has been
pointed out by Civil Engineer, '20, Posi
tively Not a Member of the Staff, this
hay fever difficulty has a lot to it. We
wouldn't enjoy going to a dance and
sneezing all evening—not even if we were
good old Helen of Troy herself, and the
Prince of Wales or George Gordon Byron
were dating us.
However, one of the most serious as
pects of this discussion is the economic.
This going to the Prom uncorsaged, while
your friend's roommate is in the back
eat with an Import, laden with lilies of
the valley and roses—that seems to us
extremely inconsistent and all wrong.
Why should a matter of geography and
transportation distance make the distinc
tion ?
Also there are a quantity of flower
stands up and-down the highway leading
to San Francisco. It our gentleman
friends are low in financial straits, we
don't see why they can't just as well put
themselves out enough to get a bunch of
sweet peas to decorate our rooms with as
to save their pennies fur an orchid for
the next San Mateo girl they bring to
their house formal. One time-honored
and hallowed custom is sending vegetables
to the lady you pick. Although the Bull
Session feels that the Stanford rough
would be rather self-conscious about
spending an evening with his peers in the

Pavilion with a lady upon whose bosom
was pinned a bunch of turnips and cab
bages, still the girl doesn't always have
the sense to wear them. Also, they help
make a tidy salad for the sisters at home
on the day after the big event.
We don't mind about throwing away
traditions if we get enough noise after
we've tossed them out, but surely the es
thetic side of this is worth considering.
One of tin.- greatest things about our lite
here is seeing these great big cut-dia
monds in the rough. We walk down on
Quad and mingle with the big strong
men, and are thrilled to the core with
their clever socks and shirts, jackets,
sweaters, knickers, and cords. We can't
even listen to our ten-o'clock prof be
cause one of these magnificent nature's
gentlemen obscures same pedagogue from
our view with his big broad shoulders, in
a red and black blazer. We admire them
tremendously. Now, how in the name of
common sense could we keep from flunk
ing out if one of these jewels went and
added to our thrills (lie having asked us
for the evening's date this same morning
while walking to class) by sending us a
corsage ?
Personally, we don't give a hoot about
what conclusion you reach on this matter
—in all seriousness, the Bull Session
never has—(and besides we have hay
lever ourselves, and we can with all the
other live hundred go out in vacation, in
the old home town, armed to the teeth
with gardenias), but the gist of the matter
is that Stanford Men, roughs, and gradu
ate students have fallen into a slough of
mental laziness. They are resting on a
tradition to save them the mental gym
nastics of solving this problem, and it's
high time they started training for some
mental acrobatics. Also, if we didn't
think they'd take some definite action,
now that it's brought to their minds, we'd
throw our roommate's fountain pen off
the deepest end. We should be glad to
hear more from you on this question.

is that Stanford Men, roughs, and gradu

mental laziness. They are resting on a
tradition to save them the mental gym
nastics of solving this problem, and it's

mental acrobatics. Also, if we didn't

A glance at the Campus Opinion col
umn will bring to the mind of the reader
a public discussion of a topic that lias
already been thoroughly discussed in pri
vate the question of corsages tor Staii
ford women, at Stanford dances, with
Stanford men. This is only a local phase
of a condition that prevails throughout
the country and that has at one time or
another prevailed throughout the larger
part of the civilized world. On our cam
pus the custom of dragging flowerless
women to campus brawls is deeply rooted
in the tradition of University life.
The fact is, this is a problem that in
volves serious economic, physiological,
ethical, and esthetic phases. As has been
pointed out by Civil Engineer, '20, Posi
tively Not a Member of the Staff, this
hay fever difficulty has a lot to it. We
wouldn't enjoy going to a dance and
sneezing all evening—not even if we were
good old Helen of Troy herself, and the
Prince of Wales or George Gordon Byron
were dating us.
However, one of the most serious as
pects of this discussion is the economic.
This going to the Prom uncorsaged, while
your friend's roommate is in the back
eat with an Import, laden with lilies of
the valley and roses—that seems to us
extremely inconsistent and all wrong.
Why should a matter of geography and
transportation distance make the distinc
tion ?
Also there are a quantity of flower
stands up and-down the highway leading
to San Francisco. It our gentleman
friends are low in financial straits, we
don't see why they can't just as well put
themselves out enough to get a bunch of
sweet peas to decorate our rooms with as
to save their pennies fur an orchid for
the next San Mateo girl they bring to
their house formal. One time-honored
and hallowed custom is sending vegetables
to the lady you pick. Although the Bull
Session feels that the Stanford rough
would be rather self-conscious about
spending an evening with his peers in the

Pavilion with a lady upon whose bosom
was pinned a bunch of turnips and cab
bages, still the girl doesn't always have
the sense to wear them. Also, they help
make a tidy salad for the sisters at home
on the day after the big event.
We don't mind about throwing away
traditions if we get enough noise after
we've tossed them out, but surely the es
thetic side of this is worth considering.
One of tin.- greatest things about our lite
here is seeing these great big cut-dia
monds in the rough. We walk down on
Quad and mingle with the big strong
men, and are thrilled to the core with
their clever socks and shirts, jackets,
sweaters, knickers, and cords. We can't
even listen to our ten-o'clock prof be
cause one of these magnificent nature's
gentlemen obscures same pedagogue from
our view with his big broad shoulders, in
a red and black blazer. We admire them
tremendously. Now, how in the name of
common sense could we keep from flunk
ing out if one of these jewels went and
added to our thrills (lie having asked us
for the evening's date this same morning
while walking to class) by sending us a
corsage ?
Personally, we don't give a hoot about
what conclusion you reach on this matter
—in all seriousness, the Bull Session
never has—(and besides we have hay
lever ourselves, and we can with all the
other live hundred go out in vacation, in
