# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
Seeing as it's the end of the quarter,
and we've revolted, considered, and
reorganized ourselves with a new con
stitution, and proposed new women's
rules, Cabbages would like to make a
few suggestions for consideration next
year, when the bolshevik fever again
hits us:
A Drivit Urself Chrysler agency
for the campus, supported by an
endowment from the Board of Ath
letic Control and Ex Committee.
The inauguration of the Second-
Cup-of-Coffee-Free custom at the
Roost.
Pony Express service at the
Cellar.
A fifty-cent rebate on all fines
for N.S.F. checks by A.S S.U. after
you get your first one back.
A Labor Day where the labor is
exerted on smoothing the bumps
out of the road on the other side
of the San Franclsquito Creek.
A nine-hole golf course in back
of the lake. (Let the engineers
little white stakes by.now).
Water wings for all Stanford
students boating on Lagunita who
haven't gotten around to passing
the canoe test. (Let the visitors
take care of themselves.)

PEON
May is going, June is near!
And also finals to bring us good cheer.
Trusts (L.233), and Contracts (L.104),
alas, my dear,
WILL KEEP ME STILL, AGAIN,
LINGERING HERE! _
But I don't care, nor do I mind,
Because one gleam of hope I find —
Though my education's far behind —
I CAN RUN THE MILE, AGAIN,
NEXT YEAR!

"Toonerville to Use Sirens"
Aha! Another woman's sport com
ing to the lore,

THE FRUIT COURSE (not coarse)
We met a friend of ours walking
down the street with an apple in his
hand.
"Where are you going?" we asked.
"To see the doctor's wife," was his
unblushing reply.
* * *
It was moonlight on Lagunita.
Ts there anyone who does not know
Of the moonlight on Lagunita?
And a youth beneath the moonlight,
Eternal youth beneath the moonlight,
The moonlight on Lagunita.
This youth began to wonder,
As young youths often do.
How would she be tonight?
How would she lake him?
Would she be cold?
He hoped not..
Forthwith he began to move
A tiny wee bit closer.
And then he began to move

A. little closer still
Until the emboldened youth
With a final sporadic gesture
Was she cold? —Brr — Was she?
Know ye not, ye who have plunged
Into the icy waters
'Neath the moonlight on Lagunita?

Cabbages nominates for the Hall of
Fame the gentlemen who, through
their loyal fraternal devotion, fell into
the clutches of the minions of the law
for sportively attempting to borrow
chutes from a children's playground.
