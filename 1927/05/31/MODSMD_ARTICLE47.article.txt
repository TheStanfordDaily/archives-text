# Pop Tells Views of Stanford Men
## 
### Maxine Cushnig 
It was the Women's Editor's idea,
this interview. She said something
about its being a good chance to print
a story übout what someone actually
thinks of Stanford men, since there
was no man around the office last
night to censor anything that might
be revealed, and so she sent me over
yesterday afternoon to interview Pop
Warner.
He and Charlie Winterburn, the
eminent backlield coach, were com
fortably ensconced in a couple of chairs
on tiie side lawn of Pop's house, ad
miring Charlie's new coupe and bull
ing about this and that. They weren't
exactly hilarious at my arrival, but
with a good show of grace Pop man
aged to find another chair and settled
down with a cigarette, waiting for the
worst.
Pop Guffaws
It was somewhat encouraging to
heur Charlie's and Pop's gulfaw at my
opening question: "Air. Warner, just,
what do you think of Stanford men?"
At least, I argued, the howl of glee
that went up should indicate the sort
of opinion that makes good copy—for
a women's edition. But carefully, quite
gracefully, Pop became serious; he
was almost voluble in his praise of
Stanford men, especially as compared
to Eastern college men he lias known,
and so tactfully avoided an incriminat
ing situation —though he could have
given such a good story! Ah, well
Just so long as the boys don't get
too dirty, Pop approves of the "rough"
tradition in dress. "It's much more
democratic," he drawled, looking
across the street and quite carelessly
spilling cigarette ashes all over his
vest.
"Back at Cornell (where he coached
for quite a while) the men dress like
1 anybody else, according to their
| means; but here a fellow, no matter
| if lie has money or not, can dress the
| same as the rest and not feel inferior.
: It's a better idea out here."
Pop thinks that the dormitory system
i here at Stanford has a lot to do with our
| putting out good teams, for even though
; the Stanford men are more or less se
lected according to their individual brain
j capacities and supposedly do not have the
j general athletic ability which is found in
j universities with non-selective enrollment,
j there is so much greater general inter
j est in athletics on this campus, due to
j intramural contests and whatnot, that the

stiff competition caused by numbers alone
forces the men to become good athletes,
sometimes even remarkable athletes.
(Charlie told me' afterward that some
hundred and five' men are enrolled in the
spring football training classes, all liglit
- j ing for eleven positions.)
More Athletic Competition
Top thinks, again, that there is a much
g greater general participation in all forms
t I of athletics on this Coast, due in part to
I a climate which permits all-year "play
-3 | ing," than at many points back East,
t ! where the men do most of their work
t j indoors. (By the way, Charlie said that
• j when he was playing out here with the
, I Pittsburg football team, around in 1923
j or thereabouts, every member of the team
, wanted to stay in California. He did.)
. ; i lie point is that Glenn S. Warner ap
i | proves of extensive general participation
. | in athletics and is pleased with what Stan
. i ford has done in that line.
j Just to break what seemed doomed to
1 be an interminable silence, 1 asked "Stan
* ! lord's grid mentor" what sport he thought
i j the most popular. Came the inevitable
1 answer of "football," but it was qualified
with the opinion that track is increasing
in popularity—a tactful reply considering
the events of last Saturday.
Card Men Have Ideals
i To give a certain tone to the interview,
;-j 1 decided to become high-minded and ask
; Pop if lie had found that Stanford men
! i have higher ideals, et al., than others he
; has known. "Yes," he said, flicking some
more cigarette ashes off, "1 think the men
i here are generally of a higher type;
| they're harder-boiled back East—especial
ly in colleges like Pittsburg where miners
j and lumbermen form most of the student
body.
1 "And,"he added quite earnestly, "Cali
j fo'rnia men seem to be more mature at,
say, nineteen than fellows in the East
: of the same age. They reach maturity
earlier out here. Maybe it's the climate—"
Whatever causes it, 1 thought the fact
most interesting, as well as most illumi
nating.
New Proposition Made
In order to make as graceful an exit
as possible 1 decided to discard my
i official capacity and end the interview j
I with a different proposition. It was

this: The Women's Athletic Associa
tion thinks that a series of talks on
"Football from the Spectator's Stand
point," given perhaps once a weeke in
fall quarter before tlie games begin,
might be able to educate some of the
women at least in tlie intricacies of
the game and do something to alleviate
their traditionally embarassing ig
norance. Pop became enthused. He
began to make plans immediately, say
ing that it was "a fine idea."
