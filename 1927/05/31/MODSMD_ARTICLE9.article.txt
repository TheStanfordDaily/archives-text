# Are You Voting Today?

### 
Today marks one of the most important events in the
student government of Stanford University, for it is the day
when men and women of the University must select the
leaders of their democracy for the coming year. It behooves
prospective voters to do their talking now, choose wisely,
and then prepare to follow their leaders next fall.
If you haven't already considered the candidates for this
election, refer to the list printed in the hight hand column of
the paper before you go to the polls, for it is a poor voter
who has not considered the names on the ballot before he
takes his pen in hand to cast his vote.
