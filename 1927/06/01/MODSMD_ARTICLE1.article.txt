# TRACKMEN DUE AT CONTEST IN L.A TOMORROW
## Athletes in Pursuit of Last Honor Available in Sports for Year COAST TITLE AT STAKE Babcock Leaves Tonight to Join Team; Will Run In Quarter Mile 
### Joe Carroll 
Stanford University's track squad is
expected to arrive in Los Angeles to
morrow noon, where the Cardinals will
compete for another title. With the
1.C.4-A championship already won,
Coach Dink Templeton and his track
and field athletes are after the last
honor that they can win this season:
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title.
Team entries are limited to fifteen
men in the meet this week-end, with
trials being held Friday and finals
Saturday.
Babcock to Leave
Captain Lawrence Babcock leaves
tonight for Los Angeles, where he will
run in the quarter-mile race, with Cap
tain-elect Bud Spencer, who failed to
qualify at Philadelphia.
Some of the men who competed in
the 1.C.4-A meet will not be entered
Friday, due to the limitation on the
number of entrants permitted each
team.
Coach Templeton will probably
choose the men who will represent
Stanford after workouts tomorrow
show who has stood up best under the
long trip across the continent and
back.
Spencer and Babcock should be well
prepared to make a good showing.
They meet competition which they
have run against before, with the ad
dition of fast men from the northern
section.
McKinnon to Run
Alex McKinnon, fourth in the mile
last Saturday, will run against some
very stiff competition in the form of
Captain Gillette of Montana, Schwo
beda of California, Unruh of U.S.C.,
and some of the milers from up North,
of whom little is known.
Stanford's set of weight-heavers
will meet some of their stiffest oppo
sition when the strong men from the
North combine forces with men from
other universities and attempt to de
feat tlie Cardinal stars.
All of the ttvents bring old oppo
nents into action, especially the hur
dles, the pole vault, the broad jump,
the shotput and discus throw, the jave
lin throw, and the high jump. Competi
tors in these events have battled each
other up and down the Coast, and
across the continent, and now will
conclude their struggle at the Pacific
Coast lntercollegiates.
