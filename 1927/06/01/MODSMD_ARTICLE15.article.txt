the business staff of the Stanford
Daily will begin today at 12:45 o'clock
when a meeting will be held in the
Daily office for men and women of
the freshman class who are interested
in taking up the work.
The first tryout period will consist
of acquainting the newcomers with
the general duties of the business
staff, and the fields open for advance
ment in the work.
An increase has been made in the
number of salaried positions. This

two years.

staff members are local advertising
manager, San Francisco advertising
manager, foreign advertising man
ager, merchandising manager, and
classified advertising manager. All of
these positions draw a salary.
In addition, there are minor offices
which lead to advancement, open to
the class of '30. Those in this capacity
compose the staff from which appoint
ments are made to the major positions
at the end of the year.
The business manager is chosen an
nually from those who hold the im
portant positions.
