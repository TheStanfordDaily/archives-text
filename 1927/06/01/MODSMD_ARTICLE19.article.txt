"Professional business schools are
concerned only with the possibilities
of the student's advancement in the
business world after several years of
experience," Professor J. Hugh Jack
son. of the accounting department in
the Graduate School of Business Ad
ministration, said in an address yes
terday to the Palo Alto Kiwanis Club.
"The vocational type of business
training school differs in that its func
tion is to prepare students for imme
diate acceptability in specific work.
However, both tyges of business edu
cat'on schools have developed from
the apprentice system of trades," he
