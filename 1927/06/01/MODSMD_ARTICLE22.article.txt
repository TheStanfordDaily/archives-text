# FOUR NEW PROVISIONS IN LAWS FOR DRIVING TAKE EFFECT IN JUNE
## 
### 
Four major provisions written into
the California Vehicle Act by the
Breed Amendment will go into effect
on July 29. Among the important
changes is the increase of the speed
limit oil California highways from 35
to 40 miles an hour.
Revocation of operators' licenses is
made automatic on three convictions
for reckless driving instead of for
speeding. Examination of new oper
ators of motor vehicles, formerly op
tional with the Division of Motor Vehi
cles, is now made mandatory. The
division is also granted authority at
any time to cancel all operators' li
censes that have been outstanding
three years or more and to require
renewal subject to examination, in its
discretion.
