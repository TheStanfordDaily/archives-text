# Is Vocational Training Education?
## 
### 
Our universities and colleges are fine institutionsâ€”except that they
dispense too much vocational training - and too little culture. So com
plains David Gray in an article, "The College and the Philanthropist,"
that appears in the May issue of Vanity Fair.
-Mr. Gray does not find fault with higher vocational training, but he
denies that, in the true sense of the word, it is educational. Jf vocational
training' is not education, Air. Gray should have enlightened the world
as to what it is. The dictionary says of education: The acquisition of
knowledge, skill, or discipline which furthers the happiness, efficiency,
and capacity for service. Either Webster or Gray is wrong, for they
disagree.
A young man 01* woman who has accomplished a college education
has certainly the facilities for a more enjoyable life. If they do not use
these accomplishments, then the training has been little or no good to
them. But it is a useless task trying to choke knowledge down a person's
throat, for the person will cease taking the doses when he is free anyway.
''The practical American," Gray writes, ''once awakened to the grav
ity of the case, will do something earnest, if not intelligent. Very pos
sibly we shall have 'Back to Personality' movements, 'drives' for the
Mark Hopkins idea. At Columbia a generous slice of Dr. Butler's sixty
millions will be devoted to the wholesale purchase of inspiring teachers.
Unfortunately, however, these are not a commodity that one may order
f.o.b. Parnassus. They are shy and fugitive. But, if our universities
should prove something analogous to the wild-life bird refuge, they
might wander in, just as golden orioles sometimes appear in city parks."
Vocational training as well as any ot her type of study should he ad
ministered by inspiring teachers, and we will agree with Gray that such
instructors are not over abundant." Probably if our universities were
similar to wild-bird refuges, the inspiring teachers would wander in just
as frequently as golden orioles appear in city parks. Hardly more
frequently.
There is a place for Gray's idea of a university, but it should not take
the place of the modern "vocational" institution of today. Right now, as
Gray points out, there is such an institution at Oxford. It is called All
Souls' College, and it is an exclusive club of intellectual swells, picked
graduates of other colleges who live at the expense of the foundation in
a kind of divine idleness. They have no duties to speak of. They may
read books or write t hem, or they may think, or they may do nothing at
all. "They ripen there in the sunshine of pure and unapplied learning;
their souls grow their wings; their intellects grow vigorous; their person
alities acquire flavor. At the appointed time those who.have the call to
teach descend from their citadel and take up their work at Oxford or in
the outer world."
Once again we repeat that there may be a place for such an institution
as All Souls' College in this country, but it can never do the work for
young men and women that the universities of the country are now doing.
