CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION
When one considers what a short
time ago it was that practically all of
Stanford's athletic victories were
"moral," the record of the present
year seems remarkable. In football the
varsity played a tie in the sectional
competition, in track Templeton's men
ran away with the honors over u 11
competitors, and in tennis the varsity
will enter the national intercollegiate
tournament favored to win.
It is worthy of note that, during the
slender years, a great deal was made,
conversationally, of the fighting spirit
of Stanford athletes. On all sides they
were complimented for their splendid
courage. This, it might be remarked,
is customary in the case of unsuccess
ful athletes. But what about the ath
letes who represent Stanford today,
when her name second to none in
sporting circles?
Their success is taken rather as a
matter of course. Because they enter
most events favored to win, there is
not so much ado abput their spirit. As
a matter of fact, hoWever, the evidence
would lead one to believe that their
spirit is at least as commendable —if
not more commendable —than that
demonstrated by their less successful
predecessors.
In football this year the varsity
gave up a Christmas vacation and ex
tended its season for weeks of extra
practice to play an extra game that
brought fame to the University. The
majority of the members of the track
team extended themselves in the na-

I tional meet to make unusually good
records. That sort of thing requires
spirit. It requires just as much spirit
as it does to lose stubbornly.

We haven't any idea how anyone
i else feels about it, but for future
! reference let us record our own reac
tion after seeing some four years of
| Stanford athletic contests, four years
. marked by a great development. We
i rec all quite vividly a sort of sick i'eel
! nig in watching those games, but
poorly directed elevens of the pre-
Warner era struggle vainly against
llie machine-like attack of Andy
j Smith's teams. In contrast we derived
an immense satisfaction out of watch
| ing the workmanlike mauling that the
: last few teams have given the Bears,
i In the same way we are very much
pleased at tho manner in which Tem
pleton's team have always acquitted
i themselves on the field since our ad
j vent (in the year of the tie meet, when
I the so-called Golden Bear made its last
i real bid as a track competitor). •
We are firmly convinced that there
i is as much spirit here as there ever
! war, if not a little bit more. However,
| that, spirit in the past few years has
been accompanied and governed by
| intelligence that has directed it into
! such channels that it might accom-
I plish some results more tangible than
j the creation of a great deal of hot air
j about itself. And as we were about to
> say, the mere contemplation of this
j changed state of affairs is enough to
make us feel very, very drunk with
| pure joy. —Stephen O'Donnell.
