# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I desire to say that in my opinion
whoever wrote "From the Editor's
Wastebasket" for the Women's Edi
tion of the Daily, mentioning the exist
ing golf situation at Stanford, hit the
proverbial nail squarely upon its head.
I may as well admit in beginning
that I'm probably the world's worst
golfer—the ace of dubs —but, never
theless, I'm strong for the game, and
have often wended my weary way to
Burlingame to hobnob with America's
aristocracy on the greensward there,
wasting many precious minutes in
traversing the distance from Palo Alto
northward,
T am fortunate in being the posses
sor of a car (well, maybe not a car,
but at least something that will run)
so I was able to play, but what of him
who has no Benzine Buggy, as Ser
geant Diggs termed them?
All this, however, is beside the
point, for a gift of all of Don Lee's
stock would be of no help to the
student who has no club affiliations
hereabouts. The Burlingame club has
withdrawn the privilege, and the Uni
versity has made 110 other provisions.
There are good, sound, financial rea
sons, no doubt, for Stanford not main
taining a links of its own. When al
most every fresh-water educational in
stitution in the country makes some
provision for its would-be Bobby
Joneses, however, it seems a little
strange that here, where large quanti
ties of good, hard cash are being spent
for physical education administrative
| offices, nothing is done. It's bad
I enough to have to trek twenty miles
to play, but when one cannot even do
; that, it's worse.
Maybe some golfer with a head for
I business (if the two ever go together)
could devise a system whereby stu
dents interested in the game might
contribute to a fund to be used for the
' purpose, with the sanction of the Uni-
I versity. At least, a little agitating
should be done. —R.D.S.
The Editor, Sir:
That Mr. Kirby should be suspected
of writing the outstanding article 011
I lock-out atrocities appearing in Cam
[ pus Opinion a few days ago, astounds
me; yet it glorifies and encourages
me. There is nt Stanford, by evidence
of his reply in an ensuing edition, at
least, one literary genius besides my
, self, who modestly prides himself in
' being able to present his ideas in a
clear, straightforward, and convincing
; manner.
Proudly and resolutely, T take this
firm stand in defense of Mr. Kirby,
who, I believe, has been unjustly at
-1 tacked. It is obvious that the gentle
man, "J.P.,'25," from whose pen drip

| perl the pungent words insidiously
aimed at Mr. Kirby, had "neither rime
I nor reason for writing," save to slan
der a gifted journalist. This he did par
excellantus; but, what was the
: achievement of his mud-slinging con
] notation? I leave it for you, dear
reader, to decide for yourselves.
| Should not the official mouthpiece of
this great and august institution of
| higher inspirations be used for some
-1 thing higher, something more praise
worthy, than personal slander?
—A Mere Man.

That Mr. Kirby should be suspected
of writing the outstanding article 011
I lock-out atrocities appearing in Cam
[ pus Opinion a few days ago, astounds
me; yet it glorifies and encourages
me. There is nt Stanford, by evidence
of his reply in an ensuing edition, at
least, one literary genius besides my
, self, who modestly prides himself in
' being able to present his ideas in a
clear, straightforward, and convincing
; manner.
Proudly and resolutely, T take this
firm stand in defense of Mr. Kirby,
who, I believe, has been unjustly at
-1 tacked. It is obvious that the gentle
man, "J.P.,'25," from whose pen drip

aimed at Mr. Kirby, had "neither rime
I nor reason for writing," save to slan

excellantus; but, what was the

reader, to decide for yourselves.

The Editor, Sir:
I desire to say that in my opinion
whoever wrote "From the Editor's
Wastebasket" for the Women's Edi
tion of the Daily, mentioning the exist
ing golf situation at Stanford, hit the
proverbial nail squarely upon its head.
I may as well admit in beginning
that I'm probably the world's worst
golfer—the ace of dubs —but, never
theless, I'm strong for the game, and
have often wended my weary way to
Burlingame to hobnob with America's
aristocracy on the greensward there,
wasting many precious minutes in
traversing the distance from Palo Alto
northward,
T am fortunate in being the posses
sor of a car (well, maybe not a car,
but at least something that will run)
so I was able to play, but what of him
who has no Benzine Buggy, as Ser
geant Diggs termed them?
All this, however, is beside the
point, for a gift of all of Don Lee's
stock would be of no help to the
student who has no club affiliations
hereabouts. The Burlingame club has
withdrawn the privilege, and the Uni
versity has made 110 other provisions.
There are good, sound, financial rea
sons, no doubt, for Stanford not main
taining a links of its own. When al
most every fresh-water educational in
stitution in the country makes some
provision for its would-be Bobby
Joneses, however, it seems a little
strange that here, where large quanti
ties of good, hard cash are being spent
for physical education administrative
| offices, nothing is done. It's bad
I enough to have to trek twenty miles
to play, but when one cannot even do
; that, it's worse.
