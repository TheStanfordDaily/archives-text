! Dear Oswald:
No, Oswald, (lice were not invented
! by T. Masefield Fordyce of Watts,
; Calif., in 1804. Far from it ! They came
originally from Asia, way back in the
Lime when hieroglyphics were A-B-C-s,
and Pharaohs faroed in their palaces,
j Old Sophocles wrote about the swell
crap game lie got into. It seems that a
"natural" was called a "Venus," and
!i'l Joe was called "the dog." This was
a variation of the old oriental game
(not to be confused with the old
, Army game), brought into Greece by
i the trade route salesmen. Sophocles,
or maybe it was Flo Ziegfield, is cred
ited with the famous line, "Let there
be more 'Venuses'."
Did those ancient "bones" (and I
don't mean those in tombs) have the
j same dots on 'em? Pure thing! Dice
' are dice no matter when, or who is
dicing them. Thus a Roman soldier
j could start "shooting" with the Egyp
i tian captives right after the conquest.
They got so clubby that Egypt re-
I mained a subject nation for centuries,
i The Romans were a slick bunch of
I gamblers — perhaps they kept the
Egyptians so poor that there wasn't
enough coin to start an insurrection.
Drop over to the Stanford Museum
some time and take a squint at those
j inlaid ivory dice used by Roman sol
diers stationed in Egypt IGOO years
ago! You'll find them in the Egypt
' ology room in a case near the north
j west corner. Read 'em and weep,
j Soptem veniat undecim! Come on
i "Venus"! By Vern Cordry.
