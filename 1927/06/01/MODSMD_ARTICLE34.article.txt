# SPONSORS MOVE TO CHECK DESTRUCTION OF ENCINA PROPERTY
## 
### 
Eniina Hall sponsors have an
nounced that any student found guilty
of the wanton destruction of Univer
sity or personal property in Encina
Hall will be denied the privilege of
living on the campus for the succeed
ing quarter of University registration.
Strict supervision will be enforced the
remainder of this quarter by all au
thorized bodies in the hall.
By succeeding quarter the summer
quarter is not meant, although for an
offense in the spring quarter the man
found guilty would not be allowed to
live on the campus for either the sum
mer or the next 'following quarter of
liis registration at the University. This
ruling by the Encina Hall sponsors
will be rigidly backed by the Men's
Council and the administration.
