# Wisconsin Withdraws From Regatta at Poughkeepsie
## 
### 
MADISON, Wis., May 31.—(LP.)—
Loss of men through illness and schol
arship disqualifications will prevent,
the University of Wisconsin from en
tering her eight-oar varsity shell in
the annual Poughkeepsie Regatta to
be held on the Hudson June 29th.
After training all spring, the crew
lost two of its best men, Horefall and
Orth, through scholastic ineligibility.
These men were replaced by reserves,
but bad luck hounded the Badgers and
the final decision to withdraw from
the race was made when it was found
that, two more of the star oarsmen
would be unable to compete because
of illness. This leaves the Western
Conference without a representative
at the regatta.
