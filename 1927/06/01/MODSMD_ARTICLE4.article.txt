# ARREST OF ACCOUNTANT REVEALS EMBEZZLEMENT
## 
### 
Embezzlement of nearly $5000 by
Howard Oliver of the accounting de
partment of the Board of Athletic Con
trol was disclosed yesterday when the
embezzler was arrested and sent to
the San Francisco jail. Inasmuch as
Oliver was bonded for $20,000 the
University will lose no money.
Although Oliver confessed to taking
funds a few minutes after a surprise
audit of his books on April 1 had re
vealed his shortage, his arrest was
not made until yesterday, after nearly
two months' investigation of the affair
by the Fidelity Bond and Deposit Com
pany of Maryland. The warrant for his
arrest was sworn out yesterday by A1
Masters, graduate managei\ at the
request of the bonding company which
will conduct the prosecution.
Oliver has been an employee of the

( Board of Athletic Control since De
j cember 1924. At that time Oliver han
dled arrangements for the Stanford
: Notre Dame football game at Pasa
; dena. He was first suspected of jug
' gling his accounts nearly two years
ago and for some time has taken small
! amounts.
Actual proof of the embezzlement
: was not disclosed until the surprise
: audit of April 1 which was followed
i by thorough investigation of all ac
! counts for several years by the bond
ing company. When his guilt was dis
' covered in April the bonding company
; assumed charge of the case.
Following his dismissal, Oliver,
j whose home was in Palo Alto, moved
to San Francisco. Oliver, who is twen
ty-eight years of age, has a wife and
j two children.
