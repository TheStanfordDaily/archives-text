# CAMPUS SPEED LAWS CHANGE TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN JULY
## 
### 
Campus residents will be allowed to
drive forty miles per hour after July
29 on portions of the local thorough
fares formerly under the old thirty
mile limit. This was the declaration of
Comptroller A. E. Roth last night. The
new speed rate is authorized by the
provisions of the Arthur Breed bill
signed by Governor C. C. Young yes
terday.
Roth stated that the forty-mile rate
would apply only to the lower part of
Palm Drive, as the remaining stretch
of the road is limited to fifteen miles
per hour because of the numerous in
tersections. Reckless driving past the
crossings will be punished as usual,
Roth declared.
