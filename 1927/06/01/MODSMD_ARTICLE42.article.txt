# "B" STUDENTS SUCCEED SAYS OKLAHOMA MAN
## 
### 
Students who make a "B" average j
in college have a better chance to sue- j
ceed in the business world than the j
"A" average man, in the opinion of
George Wadsack, registrar at the Uni-1
verity of Oklahoma. He claims that i
"B" average men participate in more ;
outside activities and thus prepare j
themselves better for their future
careers.
In defense of the"A" students, Dr.
J. S. Buchanan, vice-president of the
same institution, says: "An 'A' is an
'A,' and it is gained only by the cream,
the intelligentsia, the cognoscenti, the
illuminati, the best, the finest, the j
bound-to-suceed-at-any-cost students." j
