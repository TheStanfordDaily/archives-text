# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
At first glance the letter "K" didn't |
seem to offer much in the way of
golf. There were the two amateurs, j
Oswald Kirkby and Rudy Knepper, i
and the three pros, Joe Kirkwood,;
Tom Kerrigan, and Willie Klein. |
Those five were all that came to mind, j
But .1 little research disclosed the '
following, all capable golfers and j
worthy links-representatives of the j
eleventh letter of the alphabet:
There is Andrew Kirkaldy, the Scot- !
tish professional, who tied for the
British open title in 18S9 and won it j
in 1891, and in other years finished !
second, third, fourth, sixth, and
seventh. When Andrew was only !
thirteen years old, another "Iv" Tom
Kidd, won the British open title. That
was in 1873. A Mrs. Kennion won the !
women's championship of the British
Isles in 1906. Those three are the
only "K's" to win either the open, j
amateur, or women's crown of Britain
or America.
Then there is Alfred Kirbv. a British ;
pro. Shooting in the low 70's is poor
playing for this Soutliamptonite. A1
holds the pro record for the Asliford
course with a 65, Stoneham with a 64.
and Hayling with a 67! Besides that,
be has shot a 230-yard hole in one
stroke! Another English professional, I

James Kay, has done the course at
Seton Carew in 66 strokes.
Then there are the five Kyles (count
'em) of St. Andrews, Scotland, who
are almost as much of a golfing fam
ily as the Espinosas, of Monterey,
California. Dennis H. Kyle was a mem
ber of the 1924 British Walker Cup
team, and his brother Edward reached
the semi-final round of the 1913 Brit
ish amateur tournament. One sister,
Dr. Elsie, won the Scottish ladies
championship in 1909 and 1910, while
another, Audrey, was runner-up in the
same tournament in 1922. A third sis
ter, Ida, now Mrs. Provis, reached the
finals in 1911.
Perhaps the most interesting of the
five "K" golfers first mentioned is
Joe Kirkwood, the Australian. Since
winning the open title of his native
land in 1920, he has been unable to
finish first in a major tournament
either in England or America. Many
experts believe that the reason for
this is his many exhibition tours, in
which he specializes in displays of
trick shots. He was fourth in the 1923
British open.
Willie Klein, the young Wheatley
Hills pro, specializes in low scores for
nine holes. At Fox Hills, a year ago
lust August, he came home in 31 to

score a sizaling 66, and at Shawnee
on-tlie-Delaware he shot the last nine
holes in 19 to tie Willie MacFarlane,
former United States open champion,
with a terrific 283.
Rudy Knepper's chief claim to fame
is that he beat W. B. Torrence, Fran
ces Ouimet, and Cyril Tolley, all in a
row in the 1922 United States ama
teur championships.

holds the pro record for the Asliford
course with a 65, Stoneham with a 64.
and Hayling with a 67! Besides that,
be has shot a 230-yard hole in one
stroke! Another English professional, I

James Kay, has done the course at
Seton Carew in 66 strokes.
Then there are the five Kyles (count
'em) of St. Andrews, Scotland, who
are almost as much of a golfing fam
ily as the Espinosas, of Monterey,
California. Dennis H. Kyle was a mem
ber of the 1924 British Walker Cup
team, and his brother Edward reached
the semi-final round of the 1913 Brit
ish amateur tournament. One sister,
Dr. Elsie, won the Scottish ladies
championship in 1909 and 1910, while
another, Audrey, was runner-up in the
same tournament in 1922. A third sis
ter, Ida, now Mrs. Provis, reached the
finals in 1911.
Perhaps the most interesting of the
five "K" golfers first mentioned is
Joe Kirkwood, the Australian. Since
winning the open title of his native
land in 1920, he has been unable to
finish first in a major tournament
either in England or America. Many
experts believe that the reason for
this is his many exhibition tours, in
which he specializes in displays of
trick shots. He was fourth in the 1923
British open.
Willie Klein, the young Wheatley
Hills pro, specializes in low scores for
nine holes. At Fox Hills, a year ago
lust August, he came home in 31 to

score a sizaling 66, and at Shawnee
on-tlie-Delaware he shot the last nine
holes in 19 to tie Willie MacFarlane,
former United States open champion,
with a terrific 283.
Rudy Knepper's chief claim to fame
is that he beat W. B. Torrence, Fran
ces Ouimet, and Cyril Tolley, all in a
row in the 1922 United States ama
teur championships.


Golf Alphabet—K
At first glance the letter "K" didn't |
seem to offer much in the way of
golf. There were the two amateurs, j
Oswald Kirkby and Rudy Knepper, i
and the three pros, Joe Kirkwood,;
Tom Kerrigan, and Willie Klein. |
Those five were all that came to mind, j
But .1 little research disclosed the '
following, all capable golfers and j
worthy links-representatives of the j
eleventh letter of the alphabet:
There is Andrew Kirkaldy, the Scot- !
tish professional, who tied for the
British open title in 18S9 and won it j
in 1891, and in other years finished !
second, third, fourth, sixth, and
seventh. When Andrew was only !
thirteen years old, another "Iv" Tom
Kidd, won the British open title. That
was in 1873. A Mrs. Kennion won the !
women's championship of the British
Isles in 1906. Those three are the
only "K's" to win either the open, j
amateur, or women's crown of Britain
or America.

pro. Shooting in the low 70's is poor
