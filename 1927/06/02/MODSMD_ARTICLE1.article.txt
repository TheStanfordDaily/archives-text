# I.C.4-A. WINNERS SEEK FURTHER HONORS SOUTH
## Marks in Sprints, Dashes, Jumps, Mile Likely To Be Cracked BABCOCK JOINS TEAM Templeton, Athletes Arrive Today in Los Angeles For Coast Meet 
### Joe Carroll 
Coach Dink Templeton heads a
party of twenty Cardinals who are due
to arrive in Los Angeles at noon today
ior the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
track meet which will be held tomor
row and Saturday.
Seventeen track and field men, to
gether with Coach Templeton, Bill
Ellington, and Track Manager Lee Mc-
Colloch, compose the Stanford party.
Captain Lawrence Babcock left last
night for Los Angeles. He will run the
quarter mile with Captain-elect Bud
Spencer.
As the four-man one-mile relay is
to be an event of the meet, the two
quarter-milers, with Alex McKinnon,
miler, and Clarence West, hurdler,
will probably compose the team.
Stanford is defending the Pacific
Coast title won last year at the meet
held in the stadium.
In addition to this, the team will en
deavor to keep unsullied the title won at
the I.C.A.A.A.A. uncet in
i Philadelphia last Saturday.
Team entries are limited to fifteen men.
j With the addition of Captain Babcock to
the squad, probabilities are that Herb
Fleishhacker and Stew Way, weight man,
1 and Bill Sparling, javelin thrower, will
i not compete.
I his supposition will stand unless some
! other members of the squad are not in
j good condition because of the long train
ride to Philadelphia and back.
The U.S.C. and California sup
posed to be the Cardinal's strongest' op
ponents, will also be handicapped, as most
of their important scorers also journeyed
East.
Competition Heavy
Competition from Colleges and univer
sities of the northern section of the Pa
cific Coast, especially in the shot, discus, |
and mile run, is expected to cut consider-1
ably into the Cardinal's point total.
Every man who placed in the Pacific j
Northwestern meet at Corvallis, Oregon,
last Saturday will be in Los Angeles to
gether with many other northerners who j
did not make points in that sectional en- j
gagement. The Northwest is a threat be- |
cause athletes from universities in that
section arc just rounding into late season
form. On the other hand, the three Cali
fornia teams have been on edge since
late in March and may have grown stale,
in addition to having just returned from
Philadelphia.
In practically no event is there a sure
bet for a first place. Interesting duels are
certain in nearly every event.
Rccords May Fall
Records will probably fall in a majority
of the events. Marks for the 100, 220, 440,'
mile, two-mile, broad jump, and high j
jump arc almost sure to go, while the :
others are all in danger.
