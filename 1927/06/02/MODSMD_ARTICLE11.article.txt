# STANFORD NET TEAM OPPOSES RANKED STARS
## Last Exhibition Before Trip East for Intercollegiate Title Matches PLAY SINGLES, DOUBLES Bill Johnston, Peck Griffin, Gerald Stratford to Meet Cardinals 
### Milton Silverman 
Campus tennis fans have a treat in
store for them Saturday afternoon when
William Johnston, Peck Griffin, and Ger
ald Stratford, all nationally famous ten
nis players, oppose members of the Stan
ford tennis team on the new varsity
courts.
The matches probably will be the last
of any importance for the Cardinals be
fore they leave for the East. The men
will start immediately after finals to play
in the national intercollegiates at the
Mcrion Cricket Club, Philadelphia, dur
ing the last of June.
In the matches Saturday, Gerald Strat
ford will play Alan Herrington, his last
summer's doubles partner, in an exhibi
tion singles match at 1:15 o'clock. Strat
ford, former University of California star
and former holder of the intercollegiate
doubles championship with Gervais IT i1 -
lis of California, is one of the outstand
ing players of the West. Herrington,
ranking .fourth on the Stanford varsity,
has had a great development in his game
during the past year.
An hour later, Johnston and Griffin will
meet Cranston Holman and Lionel Og
den in the feature exhibition. The first
pair, not only famed as singles cham
pions, Johnston winning the California
state tournament last week, are holders
of numerous sectional championships. Be
sides twice winning the national title,
they have captured California and other
state honors too often to mention. Hol
man and Ogden in the intercollegiates this
year will be heavy favorites to win, since
they were only defeated in the finals of
the last tournament by the team of "Bud"
Chandler and Tom Stow of California,
which was broken by the graduation of
Chandler last June. Good doubles are
always interesting to spectators and with
Holman and Ogden in their present fine
form they should put up a stiff fight.
