# BREAKERS SOUSED BY RIVAL CLUBMEN IN WATER FIGHTS
## 
### 
Hall men Were treated to a
water fight de luxe immediately
following dinner last night when
members of the Breakers Club
were besieged by rival eating
groups. Water was in evidence
everywhere, and for once fresh
men were onlookers instead of
participants. When the Breakers
finally dared face the "thunder
ing herd" waiting outside their
doors, they were greeted with a
deluge that Noah would have ap
preciated.
The bucket-heaving squadrons
put on a scrap that was fast and
furious for the greater part of an
hour, finally declaring a truce
when leaders began losing the
last few tatters of erstwhile gar
ments. Encina's men were aston
ished and overjoyed at seeing
their "big brothers" misbehave
in such a sophomoric. manner,
and aided the scrap from time to
time with downpours of water
bags.
Prominent members of partici
pating clubs state that the entire
affair was prompted by the policy
of "good, clean fun" which has
pervaded the campus so success
fully this j r ear.
