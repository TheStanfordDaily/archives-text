Dr. Wilbur went to both the trials
and the finals of the track meet and
is enthusiastic about the team. "They
made a fine showing," he says. "They
went about the "business of winning
the meet in a way that showed they
knew what they were going to do.
They looked and acted like seasoned
athletes; they didn't get some first
places, maybe, that they hoped for,
but they knew that their business was
to pile up enough seconds and thirds
and fourths and fifths to win, and
they did it.
"Spencer didn't look to me as if he
were in quite as good shape as he had
been on the Coast, but apparently he
let down at the finish of the trial heat
in the quarter mile, thinking he had
won a place in the finals. He was fif
teen feet ahead before he slowed down
and was barely passed by two men
whom he did not see, just at the tape.
"I liked the way Edmonds fought it
out in the pole vault. Against a man
who beat the world's record, he stayed
in the fight to the finish, and his spirit
is shown by the way he vaulted three
inches higher than he had ever
reached before. He is a game man.
McKinnon's mile was a cause for
pride, too.
"The broad-jumpers all came
through, but it looked to me as if the
effects of the long railroad trip showed
in the high jump and hurdles.
"Borah is a beautiful runner. In the
220 he was like a rabbit ahead of a
pack of hounds."
