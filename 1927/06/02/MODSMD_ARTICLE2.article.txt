# SENIOR SQUAD BEATS SOPHOMORE POLOISTS BY TOPHEAVY SCORE
## 
### 
Defeating the sophomores 12 to 0
yesterday afternoon in the second
match of the interclass polo tourney,
the senior squad won the right to meet
the junior team Monday for the cham
pionship.
Led by Fred Trotter, captain of the
varsity, the seniors got under way at
an early start, scoring three goals in
the first chukker. In the second
period, the smooth and accurate play
ing of the 1027 men enabled them to
count five tallies, riding off the sopho
mores and holding them scoreless. In
the remaining two chukkers, the
sophomores tightened up their de
fense and held the seniors to two
goals for each period.
The failure of the sophomores to
spread on play formations counted
much for their defeat at the hands of
the hard-riding seniors. The upper
classmen showed more skill and ac
curacy in playing the ball as three
first-string men, Rothrock, Trotter,
and Evans, were riding for them.
The team line-ups and scores follow:
Seniors (12) Sophomores (0')
Rothrock (2) 1 Clark
Brown (1) 2 Hudson
Evans (2) 3 Stearns
Trotter (4) 4 Dill
Substitutes: Seniors â€”Lefler (2) for
Brown; Dailey (1) for Rothrock.
