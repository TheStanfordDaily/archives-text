# Leaving Their Marks
## 
### 
Any student living in Encina Hall who is found guilty of the wanton
destruction of University or personal property in Encina Hall will be
denied the privilege of living on the campus for the succeeding quarter
of his University registration. This was the edict of the Senior Sponsors.
The action was taken by the sponsors without a moment's hesitation.
The only question is whether the punishment is strict enough; whether a
man who deliberately destroys property should not be forced to move
to some other university altogether.
Jt will be remembered that last year the inhabitants of Encina Hall
decided to leave nothing but ruins behind them when they moved out of
their rooms at the end of the spring quarter. They performed their threat
well, and swept all before them. No thought was given to the freshmen
who were to take their places at the start of the next quarter. No thought
was given to anything; they just did not think. As an added bit of
damage, the freshmen threw colored ink on the stone on the outside of
the building. The ink came off after workers hail spent many hours with
chisels and hammers chipping the color out of the stone.
Such wanton destruction of property will not happen this quarter,
for the sponsors mean business. Already one man has been sentenced to
live in Palo Alto during the coming autumn quarter. In the past it "has
been somewhat of a tradition of the outgoing freshman class to destroy
everything before moving out, but, like the rest of the traditions, this
custom died with the present inhabitants of Encina Hall.
