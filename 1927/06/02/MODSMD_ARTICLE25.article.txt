# Earned Not Given

### 
Claude Conn has been appointed business manager of the Daily for
the coming year. The manager-elect earned his raise by consistent work
for the past three years.
The working of a newspaper is similar to that of an ocean liner. In
an ocean ship the captain of the boat is in charge of everything that goes
on above deck, but his power ends there, for the engineer is chief in the
engine room. The captain can order the engineer out of the cabin or off
the bridge, but the engineer can put the captain out of the engine room.
But for the best running of the ship, the two must combine their efforts,
and work together.
In the Daily the editor is supreme on the editorial side of the paper,
but, on other hand, the manager is chief on the business end of the
paper. If there is dissension between the two, the paper suffers. Conn
is an expert in his field, and besides is sympathetic toward the news side
cf the Daily. lie is boosting for the best interest of the paper, and his
aim is to do everything to advance The Stanford Daily. Speers,
editor-elect, and Conn, manager-elect, should work well together, and a
better newspaper should be the result.
