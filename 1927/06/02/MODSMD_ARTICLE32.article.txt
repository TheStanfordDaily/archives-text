The indifference that has characterized
Stanford student body elections for a
number of years was very much in evi
dence last Tuesday when twenty-seven
vacant offices were more or less filled. It
is customary for campus editorialists to
flay tlie student body for this indifference
as soon as the biennial fiasco is over. Ami
it has been customary, furthermore, to
blame this indifference for flaws existing
in the political management of the cam
pus.
This is merely reversing the order of
things. The true state of affairs is that
the nature of the campus political organi
zation is such as to cause (even to jus
tify) the utmost indifference on the part
of - the voters.
At a conservative estimate there arc
live elected or appointed officials on this
campus for every ope who is really need
ed. This is a small community, smaller
than the average tank-town. Yet there
are enough elected and appointed officials
here to manage the affairs of a large

[ metropolis. The only beneficial feature of
the arrangement is that it allows the
' maximum number of people to enjoy the
(sensation of election while necessitating
the mmimum amount Oi effort in office
i after election.
To offset this there is that noticeable
indifference toward the elections. And
that indifference will remain until a
sweeping reform eliminates the vast num
ber of unnecessary offices that now serve
to make the ballot a confusing puzzle.

An announcement has been made by
Fncina sponsors to the effect that fresh
men will be prohibited from wasting Uni
versity money in the traditional annual
I wanton destruction of all the interior fur
nishings of\ their dormitory.
It seems rather a shame that these same
sponsors could not use their inlluence to
advise the members of their own class
■ to adopt a similar economical reform by
doing away with the elaborate and ex
pensive hokum of commencement.
