Not of memorial chapels beloved of the Rubber- ' k Van,
Riding precisely on schedule, and stopping acc6ru; go plan
As mentioned in guide-books that tourists so eagerly scan —
Rather the freshman in tatters who fights till he dies,
Dazed with the water-fight battle the soph'mores devise —
The men with the broken heads, and the mud running into their eyes.
Not the museums where mummies and fossils are shown
Or the facts and statistics they shout through the loud megaphone,
But the strolls through the garden of cactus that cannot be known.
Not the libe, then, for me, but the Quad in the light of the moon,
The lazy canoe-rides of spring-time that end all too soon,
The hungry hordes hurrying homeward when chimes ring for noon.
The cheering at rallies, the bonfire that's ninety feet high,
Whose flames, bringing portent of victory, mount to the sky.
The Big Game, where Berkeley's belligerent hopes quickly die.
Others may sing of degrees and the courses they take,
Of oil burnd at midnight with Phi Beta Kappa at stake,
Mine be the Prom, the Cotillion, the sports on the lake.
Mine be the music, the color, the sunset's deep gold,
Mine the romantic traditions we keep as of old.
Of these shall my songs be fashioned, my tales be told.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY
.
(The author blushingly acknowledges indebtedness to John Masefield)
Not of memorial chapels beloved of the Rubber- ' k Van,
Riding precisely on schedule, and stopping acc6ru; go plan
As mentioned in guide-books that tourists so eagerly scan —
Rather the freshman in tatters who fights till he dies,
Dazed with the water-fight battle the soph'mores devise —
The men with the broken heads, and the mud running into their eyes.
Not the museums where mummies and fossils are shown
Or the facts and statistics they shout through the loud megaphone,
But the strolls through the garden of cactus that cannot be known.
Not the libe, then, for me, but the Quad in the light of the moon,
The lazy canoe-rides of spring-time that end all too soon,
The hungry hordes hurrying homeward when chimes ring for noon.
The cheering at rallies, the bonfire that's ninety feet high,
Whose flames, bringing portent of victory, mount to the sky.
The Big Game, where Berkeley's belligerent hopes quickly die.
Others may sing of degrees and the courses they take,
Of oil burnd at midnight with Phi Beta Kappa at stake,
Mine be the Prom, the Cotillion, the sports on the lake.
Mine be the music, the color, the sunset's deep gold,
Mine the romantic traditions we keep as of old.
Of these shall my songs be fashioned, my tales be told.
