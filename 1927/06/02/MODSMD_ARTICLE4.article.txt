# "SO THIS IS LONDON" HAS SURPRISE ARRANGEMENT
## 
### Ben Maddox 
With a surprise arrangement of acts
that is entirely distinctive from the
usual run of modern comedy-dramas,
"So This Is London," 1927 Senior
Farce, displays in an almost burlesque
fashion the comic attitudes both
Americans and English hold for each
other. With Gordon Davis in charge
of rehearsals, the play will be well
rounded into shape by June 15, when
it Avill be presented in the Assembly
Hall as a leading feature of Senior
Week.
Elizabeth Wilbur, as Lady Dux
worth. plays the guiding hand which
introduces the two widely-different
families and, after much misinterpre
tation on each side, she brings them
together happily. The first act of the
play is devoted to the American fam
ily: Hiram Draper, Sr., played by John
Atwill; Mrs. Draper, by Louise Bux
ton; and Hiram Draper, Jr., by Leon
ard Schwartz. Their idea of the mon
ocled, tea-drinking, exaggerated Eng
lish family is pictured in a hilarious

When the . curtain rises on the sec
ond act, one meets the English family
as it really is. Lord Beauchamp is
olayed by Howard Wickersham, Lady
Beauchamp by Barbara Frick, and
Elinor Beauchamp by Sarah Margaret
Burns. Following much heated discus
sion of the American family's ap
proaching visit, the audience is treated
to the British idea of the uncouth,
loud, ostentatious, and rather Wild-
West Americans.
In the final act the two families
actually meet, and when the Yankees
find that their Cousins are not nearly
as bad as anticipated, they exclaim
with more than heartfelt enthusiasm,
"So this is London!" The comic im
pressions of the two families as pic
tured by each is finally smoothed out
when the distrusting groups meet each
other.
Since "So This Is London" had long
runs in New York and other leadihg
cities, including San Francisco, Davis
feels assured of its popularity here.
