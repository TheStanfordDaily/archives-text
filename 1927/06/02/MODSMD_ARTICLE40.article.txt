# TONE ANALYZER INVENTED BY ELECTRICAL GRADUATE
## 
### 
With a prediction that it may revo
lutionize the tonality in vocal music, a
"tone analyzer" has been Invented and
tested by Marcel A. Lissman, a fellow
in electrical engineering. The device
is so simple that a child can operate
it, and it can be carried around as
easily as a portable typewriter.
Although he worked out his ma
chine merely as a problem in psych
ology, under Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
and engineering, under Professor
Frederick Terman, Lissman foresees
for it a career of practical usefulness,
particularly in the teaching of begin
ners in singing.
dotted disc, a flame, and a speaking
The tone analyzer appears to the
layman to be made up of a motor, a

tube. The flame is lighted, the motor
set in motion, the wheel revolves, the
dots all blur in moving circles. Then
the experimenter sings a tone into the
speaking tube. He sings, for instance,
middle C. His tone is true and the
row of dots that represent the proper
vibration for middle C appear sud
denly to stand still. If the experi
menter flats his tone slightly, the row
of dots slowly begins to move contra
clockwise. The more he sharps or flats
the tone, the faster the circle moves.
A return to the true tone brings ces
sation of movement.
In Lissman's explanation, he says
"the tone analyzer consists of a small
specially designed electric motor,
which runs at constant speed. It turns
a tone disc on which there are con
centric rows of dots, the number of
dots in successive tones in the musical
scale.

"Although there are rows corres
ponding to only two octaves on the
I disc, yet the indications of the ana
lyzer cover a range of five octaves.
This is more than ample for the or
dinary range of the human voice.
"A small sensitive flame is used
j which has been designed to be very
i sensitive to sustained vibrations, but
which is not sensitive to consonants
jor breathing. The vibrations in the
\ tone cause the flame to dance so that
jit sends out flashes of light at the
same rate as tlie vibrations. If the
I vibrations correspond to the number
of dots in one of the concentric circles
| of the tone disc, then these dots ap
| pear stationary. This is an optical illu
sion, because the dots are not illumi-

nated by the flame while they change
position.
"The advantage of the analyzer is
not in its-extreme accuracy, but in its
efficiency in correcting the student
without effort. Even though the teach
er could analyze as accurately the
tone sung, it is impossible for him to
convey that information to the pupil
without loss of time. For that reason
he will correct only the glaring
errors of the beginner.
"Besides being of great help in
studios, the tone analyzer will be in
valuable as an aid to music teaching
in the public schools. Here a practice
period similar to typewriter practice
will enable the conscientious student
to obtain a degree of skill and tech
nique which he could not possibly ob
tain otherwise on account of the high
cost of the individual instruction re
qured."

Lissman, Electrical Engineering Fellow, with his invention, the "Tone Analyzer"
—Courtcsv S.F. Chroniclc
With a prediction that it may revo
lutionize the tonality in vocal music, a
"tone analyzer" has been Invented and
tested by Marcel A. Lissman, a fellow
in electrical engineering. The device
is so simple that a child can operate
it, and it can be carried around as
easily as a portable typewriter.
Although he worked out his ma
chine merely as a problem in psych
ology, under Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
and engineering, under Professor
Frederick Terman, Lissman foresees
for it a career of practical usefulness,
particularly in the teaching of begin
ners in singing.
dotted disc, a flame, and a speaking
The tone analyzer appears to the
layman to be made up of a motor, a

tube. The flame is lighted, the motor
set in motion, the wheel revolves, the
dots all blur in moving circles. Then
the experimenter sings a tone into the
speaking tube. He sings, for instance,
middle C. His tone is true and the
row of dots that represent the proper
vibration for middle C appear sud
denly to stand still. If the experi
menter flats his tone slightly, the row
of dots slowly begins to move contra
clockwise. The more he sharps or flats
the tone, the faster the circle moves.
A return to the true tone brings ces
sation of movement.
In Lissman's explanation, he says
"the tone analyzer consists of a small
specially designed electric motor,
which runs at constant speed. It turns
a tone disc on which there are con
centric rows of dots, the number of
dots in successive tones in the musical
scale.

"Although there are rows corres
ponding to only two octaves on the
I disc, yet the indications of the ana
lyzer cover a range of five octaves.
This is more than ample for the or
dinary range of the human voice.
"A small sensitive flame is used
j which has been designed to be very
i sensitive to sustained vibrations, but
which is not sensitive to consonants
jor breathing. The vibrations in the
\ tone cause the flame to dance so that
jit sends out flashes of light at the
same rate as tlie vibrations. If the
I vibrations correspond to the number
of dots in one of the concentric circles
| of the tone disc, then these dots ap
| pear stationary. This is an optical illu
sion, because the dots are not illumi-

nated by the flame while they change
position.
"The advantage of the analyzer is
not in its-extreme accuracy, but in its
efficiency in correcting the student
without effort. Even though the teach
er could analyze as accurately the
tone sung, it is impossible for him to
convey that information to the pupil
without loss of time. For that reason
he will correct only the glaring
errors of the beginner.
"Besides being of great help in
studios, the tone analyzer will be in
valuable as an aid to music teaching
in the public schools. Here a practice
period similar to typewriter practice
will enable the conscientious student
to obtain a degree of skill and tech
nique which he could not possibly ob
tain otherwise on account of the high
cost of the individual instruction re
qured."
