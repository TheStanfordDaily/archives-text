# NEED OF RELAXATION RESPONSIBLE FOR USE OF ALCOHOL-PATRICK
## 
### 
Need of relaxation from the strain
of modern life is responsible for the
use of alcohol,' says Professor George
T. W. Fatrick, psychologist philoso
pher at the University of lowa.
Alcohol causes relaxation in two
ways, Patrick stated in an article on
the "Alcohol Motive" which appeared
in the April number of the Forum. It
relieves discord and tension in inner
life caused by the everlasting repres
sion of deep pulses and rests the
upper part of the brain by putting it
to sleep.
More stringent laws against the use
of alcohol are recommended by Pro
fessor Patrick, although he believes
that there must be a nation-wide un
derstanding of the physiology and
psychology of alcohol, and its good
and evil effects before prohibition can
be well enforced.
