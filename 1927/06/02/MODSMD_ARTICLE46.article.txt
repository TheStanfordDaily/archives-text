# FOUR KINDS OF FISH DESCRIBED AS HAVING ELECTRIC BATTERIES
## Jordan Publishes Article on Powers of Section of Finny Tribe 
### 
Pour kinds of fish which have bat
teries and can generate electricity are
described by I)r. Jordan in an article
entitled "Fishes that Can Shock You"
in the April issue of the Scientific
Monthly.
By stunning smaller fishes they are
easily able to secure food, but the
electricity is not produced in sufficient
amounts to ever be of any use to man
kind.
In 1882, when Dr. Jordan was work
ing on the fish of Key West, a tourist
brought him a small ray or skate, say
ing that, seeing it near shore, he had
stabbed it with a pocket knife and
received a sharp shock which for a
moment paralyzed his arm. The fish
belonged to the family of torpedoes
or electric rays, being locally known
to the Bahama and Key West fisher
men as numb-fish or cramp-fish. It is
found in all warm seas, mostly near
shore. Dr. Jordan describes its elec
tric organ as consisting "of a large
patch of six-sided honeycomb-like
cells, 'vertical hexagonal prisms,' some
400 in all in the largest species. These
B'e placed under the skin on each side
of the head, below and behind the eye,
and covering the base of the enlarged
pectoral fin.
Torpedo Shocks
"The torpedo yields a quick, sharp
tehock when touched, benumbing an
enemy for the time being. The shock
is well carried along a metallic con
dm tor, such as a knife or spear. It is
s;.id to have the qualities of magnet
ism. It is not dangerous. The exercise
of this power soon exhausts its pos
sessor and a period of rest is needed."
Quite different from the torpedo,
however, is the electric catfish of the
Kile. Its eiectrical apparatus 1.? com
posed of small structures hidden
under the surface of the skin along
the whole body. The nervps which
supply the batteries pass along the
Spinal cord but arc unusually 'arge.
Star-Gazer Weaker
A third type of electric fish is the
spotted Star-gazer, so called from the
position of its eyes, which are on top
of the head. Its electric batteries are
hidden under a patch of smooth skin
behind each eye. They are made up
of a series of thin layers called
'eleetro-plaxes,' separated from one
another by a jelly-like fluid. Dr. Jor
dan says of them: "The electric shock
given by these must be much less
severe than that given by the tor
pedoes, but of this species we have
few records, as it is rather rare, and
the fish hide along the shore, half
buried in the sand, from New Jersey
to Georgia. There are numerous spe
cies of star-gazers on the coast of
Japan and in Europe, but there is no
record that the bare skin behind their
eyes conceals a battery."
Eel Benumbs
"The electric eel, of the rivers of
Brazil and Guiana," says Dr. Jordan,
"is the most highly endowed of all
fishes in electric powers. It is not,
however, an eel, resembling eels only
in its elongated snake-like form. In
its actual make-up it is more like a
long-bodied catfish, although without
beards or spines. The organs in ques
tion are in two pairs, each made up
of a prodigious number of minute
cells, far smaller than those of other
A'lectric fishes. One pair of these is
-on the back of the tail, the other on
the anal fin. In Brazil, the electric eel
is said to reach the length of six feet.
The shock it gives, although not dan
gerous, is benumbing."
Experiments have been performed
showing that these electric fish give
shocks only when irritated or excited.
The shock grows less when the fish
Ss in captivity. It is communicated
along metallic or other good conduc
tors of electricity, and will not pass
through glass, silk, or other non-con
ductors. It has been claimed that the
shock is similar to that received from
a Leyden jar.
"It is certain that in electric fishes
tlia shock has some connection with
the nerves of the muscular system,"
Dr. Jordan concludes. "Although the
electric, battery is quite different in
structure in each of the four types of
electric fishes, these having no rela
tion to one another, yet in every case
it seems to arise from the muscular
system. The four types of batteries
have nothing in common except the
presence of a jelly-like fluid in each
cell, which causes peculiar effects on
the nerves of animals which touch or
come near the fishes which bear
them."

entitled "Fishes that Can Shock You"
in the April issue of the Scientific
Monthly.
By stunning smaller fishes they are
easily able to secure food, but the
electricity is not produced in sufficient
amounts to ever be of any use to man
kind.
In 1882, when Dr. Jordan was work
ing on the fish of Key West, a tourist
brought him a small ray or skate, say
ing that, seeing it near shore, he had
stabbed it with a pocket knife and
received a sharp shock which for a
moment paralyzed his arm. The fish
belonged to the family of torpedoes
or electric rays, being locally known
to the Bahama and Key West fisher
men as numb-fish or cramp-fish. It is
found in all warm seas, mostly near
shore. Dr. Jordan describes its elec
tric organ as consisting "of a large
patch of six-sided honeycomb-like
cells, 'vertical hexagonal prisms,' some
400 in all in the largest species. These
B'e placed under the skin on each side
of the head, below and behind the eye,
and covering the base of the enlarged
pectoral fin.
Torpedo Shocks
"The torpedo yields a quick, sharp
tehock when touched, benumbing an
enemy for the time being. The shock
is well carried along a metallic con
dm tor, such as a knife or spear. It is
s;.id to have the qualities of magnet
ism. It is not dangerous. The exercise
of this power soon exhausts its pos
sessor and a period of rest is needed."
Quite different from the torpedo,
however, is the electric catfish of the
Kile. Its eiectrical apparatus 1.? com
posed of small structures hidden
under the surface of the skin along
the whole body. The nervps which
supply the batteries pass along the
Spinal cord but arc unusually 'arge.
Star-Gazer Weaker
A third type of electric fish is the
spotted Star-gazer, so called from the
position of its eyes, which are on top
of the head. Its electric batteries are
hidden under a patch of smooth skin
behind each eye. They are made up
of a series of thin layers called
'eleetro-plaxes,' separated from one
another by a jelly-like fluid. Dr. Jor
dan says of them: "The electric shock
given by these must be much less
severe than that given by the tor
pedoes, but of this species we have
few records, as it is rather rare, and
the fish hide along the shore, half
buried in the sand, from New Jersey
to Georgia. There are numerous spe
cies of star-gazers on the coast of
Japan and in Europe, but there is no
record that the bare skin behind their
eyes conceals a battery."
Eel Benumbs
"The electric eel, of the rivers of
Brazil and Guiana," says Dr. Jordan,
"is the most highly endowed of all
fishes in electric powers. It is not,
however, an eel, resembling eels only
in its elongated snake-like form. In
its actual make-up it is more like a
long-bodied catfish, although without
beards or spines. The organs in ques
tion are in two pairs, each made up
of a prodigious number of minute
cells, far smaller than those of other
A'lectric fishes. One pair of these is
-on the back of the tail, the other on
the anal fin. In Brazil, the electric eel
is said to reach the length of six feet.
The shock it gives, although not dan
gerous, is benumbing."
Experiments have been performed
showing that these electric fish give
shocks only when irritated or excited.
The shock grows less when the fish
Ss in captivity. It is communicated
along metallic or other good conduc
tors of electricity, and will not pass
through glass, silk, or other non-con
ductors. It has been claimed that the
shock is similar to that received from
a Leyden jar.
"It is certain that in electric fishes
tlia shock has some connection with
the nerves of the muscular system,"
Dr. Jordan concludes. "Although the
electric, battery is quite different in
structure in each of the four types of
electric fishes, these having no rela
tion to one another, yet in every case
it seems to arise from the muscular
system. The four types of batteries
have nothing in common except the
presence of a jelly-like fluid in each
cell, which causes peculiar effects on
the nerves of animals which touch or
come near the fishes which bear
them."

teries and can generate electricity are

amounts to ever be of any use to man
kind.
In 1882, when Dr. Jordan was work
ing on the fish of Key West, a tourist
brought him a small ray or skate, say
ing that, seeing it near shore, he had
stabbed it with a pocket knife and
received a sharp shock which for a
moment paralyzed his arm. The fish
belonged to the family of torpedoes
or electric rays, being locally known
to the Bahama and Key West fisher
men as numb-fish or cramp-fish. It is
found in all warm seas, mostly near
shore. Dr. Jordan describes its elec
tric organ as consisting "of a large
patch of six-sided honeycomb-like
cells, 'vertical hexagonal prisms,' some
400 in all in the largest species. These
B'e placed under the skin on each side
of the head, below and behind the eye,
and covering the base of the enlarged
pectoral fin.
Torpedo Shocks
"The torpedo yields a quick, sharp
tehock when touched, benumbing an
enemy for the time being. The shock
is well carried along a metallic con
dm tor, such as a knife or spear. It is
s;.id to have the qualities of magnet
ism. It is not dangerous. The exercise
of this power soon exhausts its pos
sessor and a period of rest is needed."
Quite different from the torpedo,
however, is the electric catfish of the
Kile. Its eiectrical apparatus 1.? com
posed of small structures hidden
under the surface of the skin along
the whole body. The nervps which
supply the batteries pass along the
Spinal cord but arc unusually 'arge.
Star-Gazer Weaker
A third type of electric fish is the
spotted Star-gazer, so called from the
position of its eyes, which are on top
of the head. Its electric batteries are
hidden under a patch of smooth skin
behind each eye. They are made up
of a series of thin layers called
'eleetro-plaxes,' separated from one
another by a jelly-like fluid. Dr. Jor
dan says of them: "The electric shock
given by these must be much less
severe than that given by the tor
pedoes, but of this species we have
few records, as it is rather rare, and
the fish hide along the shore, half
buried in the sand, from New Jersey
to Georgia. There are numerous spe
cies of star-gazers on the coast of
Japan and in Europe, but there is no
record that the bare skin behind their
eyes conceals a battery."
Eel Benumbs
"The electric eel, of the rivers of
Brazil and Guiana," says Dr. Jordan,
"is the most highly endowed of all
fishes in electric powers. It is not,
however, an eel, resembling eels only
in its elongated snake-like form. In
its actual make-up it is more like a
long-bodied catfish, although without
beards or spines. The organs in ques
tion are in two pairs, each made up
of a prodigious number of minute
cells, far smaller than those of other
A'lectric fishes. One pair of these is
-on the back of the tail, the other on
the anal fin. In Brazil, the electric eel
is said to reach the length of six feet.
The shock it gives, although not dan
gerous, is benumbing."
Experiments have been performed
showing that these electric fish give
shocks only when irritated or excited.
The shock grows less when the fish
Ss in captivity. It is communicated
along metallic or other good conduc
tors of electricity, and will not pass
through glass, silk, or other non-con
ductors. It has been claimed that the
shock is similar to that received from
a Leyden jar.
"It is certain that in electric fishes
tlia shock has some connection with
the nerves of the muscular system,"
Dr. Jordan concludes. "Although the
electric, battery is quite different in
structure in each of the four types of
electric fishes, these having no rela
tion to one another, yet in every case
it seems to arise from the muscular
system. The four types of batteries
have nothing in common except the
presence of a jelly-like fluid in each
cell, which causes peculiar effects on
the nerves of animals which touch or
come near the fishes which bear
them."
