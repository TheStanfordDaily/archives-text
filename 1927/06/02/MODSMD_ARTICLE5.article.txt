# ACCOUNT OF TRIP TO I.C.4-A MEET GIVEN BY HARRY MALONEY
## Templeton and Track Team Lauded by Man Who Went East With Squad 
### 
Harry Maloney, with a great big smile,
walked into the Daily office last night ten
minutes after he arrived from Philadel
phia, surrounded himself with a dozen
reporters, and started answering ques
tions as fast as he could talk.
"Bud Spencer? Well, even if Bud had
qualified in the heats, I don't believe he
could have done much in the finals. I was
inspector on the last curve, and when he
passed me, he was tied for second place,
running elbow and elbow with the man
next to him. In the last few yards, two
runners passed him on his left side. Just
as he reached the tape, he faltered. Only
one judge, Feg Murray, awarded him a
third place, while the others gave him
fourth. Feg said that if Bud did not take
third place, lie tied for third."
Maloney said that the team was in the
best of spirits throughout the journey,
beginning from the time when Herb
Fleishhacker nearly missed the train at
Reno. The train was ready to start, with
no Fleishhacker in sight. The rest of the
team refused to get on the train, and the
conductor threatened to start off without
them. At last Herb walked out of a store,
saw the train ready to start, and sprinted
the two blocks to the station. In Chicago
the men had a short workout, with Hoff
man throwing the shot well over 49 feet.
In the trials on Friday, Stanford pulled
into a Rood start by qualifying twelve
men. King, who was having difficulty in
clearing 6 feet 2, had one more jump to
qualify. In his la-t trial he cleared the i
bar with almost six inches to spare. Ross !
Nichols was forced to run four races in j
one day, and finished first in every one.
"Little Ward Edmonds gave the prct- j
tiest exhibition of pole-vaulting I have
ever witnessed," said Maloney. "He i
cleared every height up to 12 feet 6 with- j
out missing. Barnes of Southern Califor
nia and Sahin Carr of Yale proceeded to
fight out first place. Barnes, trying for j
14 feet, made a perfect ascent, clearing
the bar by a .good margin. In coming
down he tipped the bar with his arm, and
lost out to Carr."

"Up in the grandstand were many Stan-1
ford graduates and professors. Biff Hoff- j
man had been having poor luck with the
discus, and picked up the platter for one j
more try. He looked into the grandstand,
saw Dink Templeton and Dr. Wilbur sit
ting there, and said, 'This one's going
into the audience!' And he threw the
discus for over 150 feet!
"Dink-helped out the boys a great d ; 1, '
weak as he was. The inspiration that he j
gave them certainly helped to bring us j
the title. After the meet was over, and
the photographer was ready to film the
trophy, Dink was dragged out of the I
stands and forced to stand by the cup. He j
stood there for a minute, watched the j
photographers grinding away; then lie'
walked away disgustedly."

best of spirits throughout the journey,
beginning from the time when Herb
Fleishhacker nearly missed the train at
Reno. The train was ready to start, with
no Fleishhacker in sight. The rest of the
team refused to get on the train, and the
conductor threatened to start off without
them. At last Herb walked out of a store,
saw the train ready to start, and sprinted
the two blocks to the station. In Chicago
the men had a short workout, with Hoff
man throwing the shot well over 49 feet.
In the trials on Friday, Stanford pulled
into a Rood start by qualifying twelve
men. King, who was having difficulty in
clearing 6 feet 2, had one more jump to
qualify. In his la-t trial he cleared the i
bar with almost six inches to spare. Ross !
Nichols was forced to run four races in j
one day, and finished first in every one.
"Little Ward Edmonds gave the prct- j
tiest exhibition of pole-vaulting I have
ever witnessed," said Maloney. "He i
cleared every height up to 12 feet 6 with- j
out missing. Barnes of Southern Califor
nia and Sahin Carr of Yale proceeded to
fight out first place. Barnes, trying for j
14 feet, made a perfect ascent, clearing
the bar by a .good margin. In coming
down he tipped the bar with his arm, and
lost out to Carr."

"Up in the grandstand were many Stan-1
ford graduates and professors. Biff Hoff- j
man had been having poor luck with the
discus, and picked up the platter for one j
more try. He looked into the grandstand,
saw Dink Templeton and Dr. Wilbur sit
ting there, and said, 'This one's going
into the audience!' And he threw the
discus for over 150 feet!
"Dink-helped out the boys a great d ; 1, '
weak as he was. The inspiration that he j
gave them certainly helped to bring us j
the title. After the meet was over, and
the photographer was ready to film the
trophy, Dink was dragged out of the I
stands and forced to stand by the cup. He j
stood there for a minute, watched the j
photographers grinding away; then lie'
walked away disgustedly."
Harry Maloney, with a great big smile,
walked into the Daily office last night ten
minutes after he arrived from Philadel
phia, surrounded himself with a dozen
reporters, and started answering ques
tions as fast as he could talk.
"Bud Spencer? Well, even if Bud had
qualified in the heats, I don't believe he
could have done much in the finals. I was
inspector on the last curve, and when he
passed me, he was tied for second place,
running elbow and elbow with the man
next to him. In the last few yards, two
runners passed him on his left side. Just
as he reached the tape, he faltered. Only
one judge, Feg Murray, awarded him a
third place, while the others gave him
fourth. Feg said that if Bud did not take
third place, lie tied for third."
