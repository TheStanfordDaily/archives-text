# ACCOUNT OF TRIP TO I.C.4-A MEET GIVEN BY HARRY MALONEY
## Templeton and Track Team Lauded by Man Who Went East With Squad 
### 
Harry Maloney, with a great big smile,
walked into the Daily office last night ten
minutes after he arrived from Philadel
phia, surrounded himself with a dozen
reporters, and started answering ques
tions as fast as he could talk.
"Bud Spencer? Well, even if Bud had
qualified in the heats, I don't believe he
could have done much in the finals. I was
inspector on the last curve, and when he
passed me, he was tied for second place,
running elbow and elbow with the man
next to him. In the last few yards, two
runners passed him on his left side. Just
as he reached the tape, he faltered. Only
one judge, Feg Murray, awarded him a
third place, while the others gave him
fourth. Feg said that if Bud did not take
third place, lie tied for third."
Maloney said that the team was in the
best of spirits throughout the journey,
beginning from the time when Herb
Fleishhacker nearly missed the train at
Reno. The train was ready to start, with
no Fleishhacker in sight. The rest of the
team refused to get on the train, and the
conductor threatened to start off without
them. At last Herb walked out of a store,
saw the train ready to start, and sprinted
the two blocks to the station. In Chicago
the men had a short workout, with Hoff
man throwing the shot well over 49 feet.
