## 
### 
Offices were opened in Palo Alto j
last week for the Palo Alto Country ;
Club, boon to be constructed on the
Mullen ranch back of the campus.
When finished, the Club will have an
eighteen-hole golf course, tennis
courts, a pool 40x100 feet, riding
stables, and trap-shooting. The club
house will be only fifteen minutes'
drive from any point on the campus,
the most accessible ofany country club
in the vicinity.
Construction will begin in the near
future, and the builders plan to have
one ninehole course in condition for
play by next fall. Cognizant of the
urgent need in the community for a
convenient country club with member
ships at a reasonable price, the pro
moters plan to offer preferential mem
berships to residents of Palo Alto and
Stanford University, especially to col
lege students.
The course will fill a long-felt need
for links on which to play off intra
mural matches, which heve heretofore
been forced to go to Los Altos, Emer
ald Lake, and other distant courses.
The company is headed by Mr. W.
O. Browne, who has just come from
the El Sereno Country Club, in Los
Angeles. The El Sereno is one of the
finest of the many country clubs re
cently constructed in the South, and
from rumors going the rounds, the
Palo Alto Country Club will be
least as fine.
