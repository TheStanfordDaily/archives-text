# THAT WASHINGTON INFLUENCE
## 
### Feg Murray 
When Hiram Conibear fell out of a
plum tree in 1917 and passed beyond
the realm of swivel oarlocks and slid
ing seats, he had no idea that the
rowing principles that he inaugurated
at the University of Washington
would spread until, ten years later,
their influence would be felt at half a
dozen major institutions throughout
the country.
I wonder what the spirit of Hiram
thinks now, as it looks down from Mt.
Olympus, where also sits the greatest
coach of all, "Pop" Courtney, and sees
Washington men teaching the Coni
bear stroke, or an adaptation of it, at
Yale, at Princeton, at Annapolis, and,
of course, at Washington. For Ky
Ebright at California, Fred Spuhn and
Max Luft at Penn, Ed Leader at Yale,

"Chuck" Logg at Princeton, Bob But
ler with the Navy, and Rusty Callow
at Washington, all learned their row
ing either from Conibear himself or
from his successors.
It is very interesting how this Wash
ington influence is spreading, and how
a stroke, based on facts worked out
by a trainer and bicycle-racer who
never rowed himself, is now in such
wide use. Ed Leader, the most famous
and most successful of all of Coni
bear's pupils, made such an impres
sion with his Washington crew in the
East iu 1922, when the "Huskies" fin
ished second, that he was signed up
by the Eli authorities to rescue the
Yale crew situation from the slough of
despond into which it had sunk. The
miraculous results accomplished by
Leader at Yale are familiar to all.

I Rusty Callow, who succeeded Leader
i at Washinton, gave the Pacific Coast
| its first victory in the Pouglikeepsie
j regatta in 1923, and followed this up
| by a second win in 1924. Washington
was forced to bow to the Navy the
| following year, but in 1926 Callow's
! men came back to win once more,
beating the Washington-coached Navy
| crew by one scant second.
Penn alone of the four members of
the Intercollegiate Rowing Associa
, tion is coached by a Washington man.
i Fred Spuhn, aiul his assistant, Max
Luft, captain of the 1925 Husky crew,
! are doing a fine job at Philadelphia,
I and perhaps the crew of a member of

j the T. R. A. may finish better than
• third this year for the first time since
1920.
California, coached by little Ky
, Ebright, who was coxswain of Coni
bear's crews in 1916 and 1917, looms
' as a new threat to the Eastern uni-
I versities at Poughkeepsie this month,
for California, for the first time in
I six years, defeated the University of
Washington, and will make a strong
bid to win its first intercollegiate row
| ing championship.
; And don't forget Bob Butler of the
| Navy! The middies are never beaten
| till the finish line is crossed, and more
I often than not they cross it first!

bear stroke, or an adaptation of it, at
Yale, at Princeton, at Annapolis, and,
of course, at Washington. For Ky
Ebright at California, Fred Spuhn and
Max Luft at Penn, Ed Leader at Yale,

"Chuck" Logg at Princeton, Bob But
ler with the Navy, and Rusty Callow
at Washington, all learned their row
ing either from Conibear himself or
from his successors.
It is very interesting how this Wash
ington influence is spreading, and how
a stroke, based on facts worked out
by a trainer and bicycle-racer who
never rowed himself, is now in such
wide use. Ed Leader, the most famous
and most successful of all of Coni
bear's pupils, made such an impres
sion with his Washington crew in the
East iu 1922, when the "Huskies" fin
ished second, that he was signed up
by the Eli authorities to rescue the
Yale crew situation from the slough of
despond into which it had sunk. The
miraculous results accomplished by
Leader at Yale are familiar to all.

I Rusty Callow, who succeeded Leader
i at Washinton, gave the Pacific Coast
| its first victory in the Pouglikeepsie
j regatta in 1923, and followed this up
| by a second win in 1924. Washington
was forced to bow to the Navy the
| following year, but in 1926 Callow's
! men came back to win once more,
beating the Washington-coached Navy
| crew by one scant second.

1920.
California, coached by little Ky
, Ebright, who was coxswain of Coni
bear's crews in 1916 and 1917, looms

I versities at Poughkeepsie this month,
for California, for the first time in
I six years, defeated the University of
Washington, and will make a strong
bid to win its first intercollegiate row

I often than not they cross it first!

When Hiram Conibear fell out of a
plum tree in 1917 and passed beyond
the realm of swivel oarlocks and slid
ing seats, he had no idea that the
rowing principles that he inaugurated
at the University of Washington
would spread until, ten years later,
their influence would be felt at half a
dozen major institutions throughout
the country.
I wonder what the spirit of Hiram
thinks now, as it looks down from Mt.
Olympus, where also sits the greatest
coach of all, "Pop" Courtney, and sees
Washington men teaching the Coni
bear stroke, or an adaptation of it, at
Yale, at Princeton, at Annapolis, and,
