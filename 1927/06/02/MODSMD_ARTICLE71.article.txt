# Los Angeles Drops Height Ban For Quake-proof City Hall
## 
### 
ANGELES' skyline goes up
to a new peaft with the con
struction of the City Hall, the tall
est building in town. The city had
to pass a special ordinance to al
low itself to exceed the 150 foot
height limit.
The structure is to be built in
a manner to minimize the danger
from earth tremors. It will be of
a steel frame with elastic joints
introduced in the facing material
at each story. The building is to
be faced with terra cotta, which
experience has shown gives the
best security against displacement
under earthquake shocks. With

the elastic joints It will be possible!
to avoid the rigidity in the appliedi
facing which leads to fracture un
der strains and stresses transmitted
by the steel frame.
The City Hail will be the onlyi
building In Los Angeles, with anl
outline similar to New York City's,
skyscrapers, built in accordance!
with the "setback laws."
One feature of the new edifice
will be a large forecourt, which i
will provide a setting for recep-i
tions suggestive of the early Span- :
ish days when the Governors were
inaugurated amid the most color
ful and romantic surroundings.
