# SOKOLOFF DIRECTS FIRST CONCERT OF SAN MATEO SERIES
## 
### 
As the Director of the first concert
of a series being given during June
and July at the Woodland Theatre,
Hillsborough, by the Philharmonic So
ciety of San Mateo, Nikolai Sokoloff,
of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra,
will present an essentially popular pro
gram on Sunday at 3:15 o'clock.
Tschaikowsky's Symphony No. 4
and the "Song of India" by Rimsky
Korsakoff are both familiar numbers.
They are balanced on the program by
Sibelius' "Finlandia," one of his most
often played compositions, and the
"P. T. Barnum" suite by Douglas
Moore, a group of highly descriptive
sketches.
