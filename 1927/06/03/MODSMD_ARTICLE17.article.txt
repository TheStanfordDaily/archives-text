# BOOKPLATE EPITOMIZES CARDINAL SPIRIT, SAYS ALUMNUS PUBLICATION
## 
### 
"The spirit which maintained and
animated the University in its early
days and which still persists is, in this
design, summed up and epitomized by
a master artist" â€”this we read in a
1913 Stanford Alumnus Magazine as
an explanation of the symbolism of the
book plate which appears on the fly
leaf of each one of the thousands of
volumes contained in the Stanford
Library.
The plate was designed by Edwin
Howard Blashfield, gne of the leading
artists of the country, and has been
reproduced by a special rotogravuring
process to keep the soft gradations of
light as they were in the charcoal
original.
Minerva Represented
At the right in the drawing appears
a seated figure representing Minerva,
goddess of wisdom, who extends a
winged statue, wreath and palm in
hand, emblematic of victory. At her
feet kneels Clio, the muse of history,
offering Minerva a chest of precious
jewels. To the outsider, these figures
are beautiful for their dignity and
classic simplicity, but those acquainted
with the early history of Stanford
realize in them a deeper significance.
Pearls Conspicuous
To them, and to the artist who drew
the plate, the string of pearls conspicu
ous in the chest which Clio holds,
represents part of the Jewel Fund
established by Mrs. Stanford shortly
before her death as an endowment for
the library. The fund was made up of
money derived from the sale of her
personal jewelry which she willingly
offered for purchase at a time when
lack of money threatened to close the
doors of the University. Thus the
pearls were offered to Wisdom mean
a sacrifice gladly made for Stanford,
and the statue of Victory represents
the victory and success which finally
came as a result of it.
