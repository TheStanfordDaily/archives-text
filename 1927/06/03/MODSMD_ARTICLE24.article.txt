# STANFORD, U.S.C.. FUMED TO WIN COAST INTERCOLLEGIATES
## West, McKinnon Scheduled To Run With Spencer, Babcock in Relay DEVINE SPEEDY IN MILE Stiff Competition Expected In Weights; Hoffman Favored in Discus 
### Jack Hodges 
Stanford and U.S.C. are ranked as
favorites in the first annual Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate track meet which displaces
the old Pacific Coast Conference meet,
to be held today and tomorrow at Los
Angeles. Ihe Cards, although winners
of the P.C.C. meet last year and holders
of the 1.C.4-A. championship this year,
are only given a slight margin over
IJ.S.C., as northern colleges have a nutn
lier of star performers who will take a~
lot of points from the Stanford total.
Captain Larry liabcock, 440 man, was
the only Stanford track man to make the
trip to Los Angeles who did not compete
i.n the I.C-.4-A meet.'* Since only fifteen
men are allowed to enter, it is probable
that Sparling, javelin thrower, and
Fleishhacker and Way, weight men, will
be kept out of competition.
McKinnon in Relay
As the four-mile one-man relay is to
be an event of the meet, McKinnon,
miler, and West, hurdler, are scheduled,
with Babcock and Spencer, to make up
the Stanford team. They will face strong
competition in both U.S.C. and O.A.C.
Peltret of Washington, Oulotte of
Washington State, and Talbot, captain
elect of California, will give Spencer and
Babcock a good race in the 440, although
Spencer is favored to win.
Gillette Fast in Mile
McKinnon will meet hard competition
in the mile with Gillette of Montana and
Devine of Washington State. Gillette
rules favorite in both the mile and two
mile if he chooses to enter both events.
If Sclnvobeda of California enters the
race he will also be a threat to McKin
non.
Nichols will have a hard run in the
high hurdles against Reynolds of U.S.C.,
who is in shape after an early season
injury, and Spaulding of Montana, who
has run close to 15 flat. West will prob
ably have difficulty with Thompson of
Idaho, who has made 24.4 this season.
