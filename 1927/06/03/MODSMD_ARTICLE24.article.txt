# STANFORD, U.S.C.. FUMED TO WIN COAST INTERCOLLEGIATES
## West, McKinnon Scheduled To Run With Spencer, Babcock in Relay DEVINE SPEEDY IN MILE Stiff Competition Expected In Weights; Hoffman Favored in Discus 
### Jack Hodges 
Stanford and U.S.C. are ranked as
favorites in the first annual Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate track meet which displaces
the old Pacific Coast Conference meet,
to be held today and tomorrow at Los
Angeles. Ihe Cards, although winners
of the P.C.C. meet last year and holders
of the 1.C.4-A. championship this year,
are only given a slight margin over
IJ.S.C., as northern colleges have a nutn
lier of star performers who will take a~
lot of points from the Stanford total.
Captain Larry liabcock, 440 man, was
the only Stanford track man to make the
trip to Los Angeles who did not compete
i.n the I.C-.4-A meet.'* Since only fifteen
men are allowed to enter, it is probable
that Sparling, javelin thrower, and
Fleishhacker and Way, weight men, will
be kept out of competition.
McKinnon in Relay
As the four-mile one-man relay is to
be an event of the meet, McKinnon,
miler, and West, hurdler, are scheduled,
with Babcock and Spencer, to make up
the Stanford team. They will face strong
competition in both U.S.C. and O.A.C.
Peltret of Washington, Oulotte of
Washington State, and Talbot, captain
elect of California, will give Spencer and
Babcock a good race in the 440, although
Spencer is favored to win.
Gillette Fast in Mile
McKinnon will meet hard competition
in the mile with Gillette of Montana and
Devine of Washington State. Gillette
rules favorite in both the mile and two
mile if he chooses to enter both events.
If Sclnvobeda of California enters the
race he will also be a threat to McKin
non.
Nichols will have a hard run in the
high hurdles against Reynolds of U.S.C.,
who is in shape after an early season
injury, and Spaulding of Montana, who
has run close to 15 flat. West will prob
ably have difficulty with Thompson of
Idaho, who has made 24.4 this season.
Graham and Kaer of U.S.C. must also |
he figured as strong contenders in this
event.
Big Threat in Weights
The biggest threat to the Cards comes
in the weights. Biff Hoffman will have
three strong contenders in the shot, with
Gerkin, who defeated Hoffman in the j
1.C.4-A, and Dixon of the Oregon Ag- j
gies, who has put the shot 49 feet 1(1 i
inches, and Brix of Washington, who!
has reached 48 feet \/ inches. Forster |
of Stanford will have to be at his best j
to place in this event.
Battle in Pole-Vault
The pole-vault will probably be a bat- i
tie between Barnes and Williams of
U.S.C. and Edmonds of Stanford.
Barnes made 13 feet 9'/i inches in the
1.C.4-A meet, and the other two cleared
13 feet 6 inches. The best that the north
ern men have done is 12 feet 6 inches.
Edmonds has improved in every meet
and may win the event.
Stanford's trio of broad jumpers may
again be counted on for points, as they
have all been doing over 24 feet con
sistently. The northern men have been
jumping around 23 feet.
King Favored
Bob King should take first in the high
jump and Work can be counted on to
place, as the northern colleges have only
one man capable o|f six feet. Hampton
of California is a strong contender in
this event.
Whitlock of 0.A.C., Pickctt of Idaho,
and Wetzel of Oregon have been throw
ing the javelin around 190 feet, so they
should cut into the southern points in ■
this event. Shipkey is capable of 190
feet himself, so the winner of the event
is a gamble.

IJ.S.C., as northern colleges have a nutn
lier of star performers who will take a~
lot of points from the Stanford total.
Captain Larry liabcock, 440 man, was
the only Stanford track man to make the
trip to Los Angeles who did not compete
i.n the I.C-.4-A meet.'* Since only fifteen
men are allowed to enter, it is probable
that Sparling, javelin thrower, and
Fleishhacker and Way, weight men, will
be kept out of competition.
McKinnon in Relay
As the four-mile one-man relay is to
be an event of the meet, McKinnon,
miler, and West, hurdler, are scheduled,
with Babcock and Spencer, to make up
the Stanford team. They will face strong
competition in both U.S.C. and O.A.C.
Peltret of Washington, Oulotte of
Washington State, and Talbot, captain
elect of California, will give Spencer and
Babcock a good race in the 440, although
Spencer is favored to win.
Gillette Fast in Mile
McKinnon will meet hard competition
in the mile with Gillette of Montana and
Devine of Washington State. Gillette
rules favorite in both the mile and two
mile if he chooses to enter both events.
If Sclnvobeda of California enters the
race he will also be a threat to McKin
non.
Nichols will have a hard run in the
high hurdles against Reynolds of U.S.C.,
who is in shape after an early season
injury, and Spaulding of Montana, who
has run close to 15 flat. West will prob
ably have difficulty with Thompson of
Idaho, who has made 24.4 this season.
Graham and Kaer of U.S.C. must also |
he figured as strong contenders in this
event.
Big Threat in Weights
The biggest threat to the Cards comes
in the weights. Biff Hoffman will have
three strong contenders in the shot, with
Gerkin, who defeated Hoffman in the j
1.C.4-A, and Dixon of the Oregon Ag- j
gies, who has put the shot 49 feet 1(1 i
inches, and Brix of Washington, who!
has reached 48 feet \/ inches. Forster |
of Stanford will have to be at his best j
to place in this event.
Battle in Pole-Vault
The pole-vault will probably be a bat- i
tie between Barnes and Williams of
U.S.C. and Edmonds of Stanford.
Barnes made 13 feet 9'/i inches in the
1.C.4-A meet, and the other two cleared
13 feet 6 inches. The best that the north
ern men have done is 12 feet 6 inches.
Edmonds has improved in every meet
and may win the event.
Stanford's trio of broad jumpers may
again be counted on for points, as they
have all been doing over 24 feet con
sistently. The northern men have been
jumping around 23 feet.
King Favored
Bob King should take first in the high
jump and Work can be counted on to
place, as the northern colleges have only
one man capable o|f six feet. Hampton
of California is a strong contender in
this event.
Whitlock of 0.A.C., Pickctt of Idaho,
and Wetzel of Oregon have been throw
ing the javelin around 190 feet, so they
should cut into the southern points in ■
this event. Shipkey is capable of 190
feet himself, so the winner of the event
is a gamble.
Stanford and U.S.C. are ranked as
favorites in the first annual Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate track meet which displaces
the old Pacific Coast Conference meet,
to be held today and tomorrow at Los
Angeles. Ihe Cards, although winners
of the P.C.C. meet last year and holders
of the 1.C.4-A. championship this year,
are only given a slight margin over
IJ.S.C., as northern colleges have a nutn
lier of star performers who will take a~
lot of points from the Stanford total.
