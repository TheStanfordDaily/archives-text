# Where Visiting Isn't Welcome
## 
### 
With the raising of the question of the rights of the "500" by the
recent agitation over lockout rules, there is a minor regulation which in
the large majority of cases seems to be unwarranted. It is a rule for
the students that a man intending to visit a woman in the Palo Alto
Hospital must obtain permission from the Dean of Women. Permission
must also be obtained in the reverse case, and an effort in both instances
is made to have an older woman, acting as chaperone, accompany the
visitor.
J his regulation, according to Dean Yost, was made at the request of
the hospital officials in order to reduce visiting by raising an artificial
barrier. Cutting down the visiting has been deemed a desirable object
both from the points of view of the hospital attendants and of the sick
persons involved. Furthermore, the argument is advanced that in ward
cases, visiting may serve to irritate and discomfort persons in the ward
other than the ones visited.
\ iewed in this light the rule seems to be entirely justified, but
instances do arise when the rule is irksome and- uncalled for. For
example, cases of poison oak, common enough in this locality, when in
private rooms would scarcely seem to demand enforcement of this rule.
It is true that cases can and do arise when any visiting at all would be
deleterious to the recovery of the patient, but there are not enough such
instances to warrant a blanket rule covering minor illnesses or accidents.
While it admittedly would be a bother to hospital attendants to have
more visitors, it would still be a pleasure for the unfortunate hypothetical
poison oak victim. In any other hospital, visiting is not regulated to such
an extent as is here the case. While modification of it would give
hospital attendants something more to do in directing visitors, the un
pleasantness of hospital confinement would be lightened.
