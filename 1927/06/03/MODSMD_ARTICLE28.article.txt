# Sophomoric For Once
## 
### 
The Columbia Spectators says,"The question of enforcing the exist
ing freshman rules is one of the most perplexing of the problems that
face the college leaders next year. . . . The sophomores have proven
themselves totally unable to enforce these few remaining regulations.
Either because they realize the futility of their effort or because they are
too lazy and disinterested to make the effort, they have ceased to make any
attempt at enforcement."
It would appear from the above that the sophomores at Columbia
are quite a live class, and yet the class is criticized because it is too lazy
and disinterested to enforce certain regulations. The sophomores are
â€¢criticized because they do not care to walk around the campus with a
paddle in their hands and because they do not use the said paddles when
a freshman is seen without the frosh cap on his head.
The sophomore class at Columbia passed through a year of traditions.
They were forced to wear ridiculous caps, and do simple things. When
they graduated from their freshman year they saw the folly of all these
regulations and did not care to make the next class go through the same
rules, and they decided to abolish them. They had suffered under the
ordeal.
Who had a better right to abolish the rules than the freshman
at the cud of their year of duties?
