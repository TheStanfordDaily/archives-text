# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Although I cannot say that I agree
with everything in David Gray's arti
cle on"The College and the Philan
thropist" printed in the May issue of
Vanity Fair, still I did think it was a
very exceptional article, and 1 did not
like the treatment it received in the
Daily editorial June 1. Mr. Gray made
the distinction between a really edu
cated man and a man with merely a
good fund of information perfectly
clear. The distinction is so commonly
made that I can hardly believe the
editor is entirely unacquainted with it;
so I can not understand why diction
ary definitions were quoted in the edi
torial. The present craze over ques
tionnaires is a result of popular con
fusion of education with mere informa
tion.
It seems to me that David Gray has
said a very vital thing. Our modern
civiUzation, because of its increasing
complexity, is demanding a little more
of each person and promises to con
tinue to demand more; the public
must be more enlightened in order to
cope with the new problems. Someone
has said, "The world is growing small
er every day,"and it is to meet this
greater compactness that a more en
lightened public is necessary. The uni
versities are helping to meet this
demand by turning out a flock of well
informed men and women, but they
are educating very few of their stu
dents. High production tends toward
standardization, and the universities
are getting more and more to be high
production plants.
My father graduated from college
twenty-four years ago, and the re
membrance of two or three inspiring
professors is the finest thing he has
retained from his college experiences.
Even in his day. however, the move
ment for promiscuous college educa
tion was already running rampant in
the United States, and personal con
tact with the professors was becom
ing more difficult. Our nation had
passed through the pioneer stages,
concentration of wealth in the hands
of the few had occurred, and universi
ties were becoming more numerous.
The increasing number of students in
cluded more of the ricli-man's-son type
and proportionately fewer real schol
ars. The new tyjie has developed the
"apple-polisher" so that now it means
almost certain ostracism even to speak
to a professor. I think the term should
be dropped from the vocabularies of
Stanford students. The professors are
not so dumb that they can not distin
guish between the sincere and the arti
ficial student. Among the seven things
that Thomas Arkle Clark, Dean of
Men at the University of Illinois, said
that he would do if he were in college
again was the advice to get acquainted
with the instructors.
The administrators of Stanford have
come to realize that even our school
is "going to the dogs" as far as real
education is concerned, but they have
taken a preventive measure. The Low
er Division is to be abolished so that
opportunities will be offered to the
real students to get a real education.
It seems to me that in doing this
Stanford has made the finest progres
sive step of any school in the country.
Stanford is not so tightly bound by
what is customary that she can not
see and act. I hope that under the new
arrangement something of the Mark
Hopkins spirit in education will reap
pear. When it comes to the place that
the "Daily" adopts an attitude such as

it did on David Gray's article it is
high time that something were done
if Stanford is to be saved from the
fate that has overtaken many univer
sities —the fate that has changed them
into great department stores of infor
mation.
Gray mentioned the importance of
athletics in modern universities. In
this we have gained greatly over the
ohl colleges which could not offer
proper facilities for athletics and did
not realize the importance of physical
as well as mental excellence. —W. 13.

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford has a medical school that
is noted for its efficiency and thor
oughness, and yet it has a medical de
partment in the men's gym that is a
disgrace to the profession. If one gets
by the doorkeeper the advisor looks
you over, writes out a long report, and
advises you to see a doctor in Palo
Alto. lie even refuses to lance a boil
or remove a splinter. On one occasion
I took in a man who had been gassed
during his work in the laboratory. The
"medical advisor" rang ui> a doctor
and asked him what to do!
As I understand it, we are charged
two dollars a quarter for medical fees,
which simply mean we pay six dollars
a year for being told to see a "good"
doctor. Many industrial firms and
other universities furnish professional
service and pay all hospital expenses
for injured men for a very nominal
monthly charge. It seems to me that
the University could at least furnish
us with one respectable doctor and
the materials which he requires.
