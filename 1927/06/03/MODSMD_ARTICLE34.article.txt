A handsome young grad from Eugene,
Invented a loving machine;
It was very complex,
It would please either sex,
'Twas the most affectionate thing you
ever saw. —E.W.C.
* * Mr
Professor John Erskine has been
elected director of a music school in
New York.
May we expect "The Private Life of
Irving Berlin," with enough of his
married life to explain his relations?

Our idea of the supreme punish

to Paris with four sandwiches from
the "roost."

Which reminds us that the best rea
son we have heard so far for the

graduate schools is so a freshman can
j get service in the "cellar" before he
j has to leave the University.

CABBAGES ALIBI CONTEST
Number One
The obliging Stanford "brother" is
meandering northward on the highway
| at sufficient speed. Under the back
j seat gurgle various jugs, say about
! twenty.
Chancing, oh, most unfortunately, to
! encounter a state policeman, with him
i the obliging student is chatting most
amiably. Suddenly, with a lupine snort,
the cop discovers
"Well, you see, it's this way" . . .
the student begins.
Number Two
"How do you happen to have poison
j oak in all those places? Couldn't you
; see the bushes?"
"Well, you see it was this way" . . .
