# GUGGENHIME MADE 1927-8 CHAPARRAL BUSINESS MANAGER
## 
### 
Richard E. Guggenhime, '29,
was chosen as Business Manager
of the Stanford Chaparral for the
coming year by Hammer and
Coffin Society yesterday. The ap
pointment was in doubt until all
the advertisements for the June
issue of the magazine were fig
ured up, so close was the struggle
for the position between Guggen
hime and George Force.
Guggenhime, who is registered
from San Francisco, has been on
the Chaparral staff since his
freshman year, as an office as
sistant and as an advertising
manager. He is also a member of
the 1927 Quad staff, and was re
cently elected to Hammer and
Coffin. He belongs to Branner
Club, and was on the 1929 Sopho
more Cotillion Committee.
