# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Tonight that energetic promoter,
Signor Humbert Fugazy, is putting on
another one of his fistic treats, this
time at the Polo Grounds in New
York City. As you know, Mr. Peter
Latzo, of Scranton, Pa., is defending
his world's welterweight title against
Mr. Joseph Dundee of Baltimore, Md.,
and though many seem to think that
Mr. Dundee will knock Mr. Latzo for
a row of polo ponies, I cannot see it
that way myself. Dundee's backers
probably base their opinions on the
fact that their man technically knock
ed out the w. k. Mickey Walker in
eight rounds, whereas the best that
Mr. Latzo could do was to defeat the
popular Mickey on points in ten
rounds.
But Mr. Dundee happened to come
along a month after Mr. Latzo had
"softened up" Mr. Walker, as the boys
say, and anybody who gets himself
knocked out in one round even by
Eddie Roberts, as Mr. Dundee did, is
not going to win Pete Latzo's title,
to my way of thinking. And don't
forget that Latzo knocked out Willie
Harmon, while Dundee merely won
the decision from Willie. However,
most of the interest in this fight seems
to center on the challenger's chances,
so let us take a look at Mr. Samuel
Lazzaro, which is Dundee's real name,
and see how he stacks up.
Joe is an Italian-American, he lives
in Baltimore, and he is managed by
the belligerent Max Waxman, who
was recently the victim of a cowardly
stabbing attack by one or more men
in a New York hotel. Joe's chief
claim to ring greatness, besides his
feat of stopping ex-champion Mickey

j Walker, was his game come-back
i against Eddie Roberts, in their second
bout, which took place before a packed
house in Madison Square Garden. In
the fourth round, Roberts knocked
I Dundee down with a right to the jaw.
' Joe showed that he was made of true
I championship timber wheu lie lasted
; out the round, and then went on to
j win the decision.
Dundee has been training in a tiny
i gymnasium over a delicatessen store
in Baltimore, the same place where
j Joe Gans, Kid Williams, Billy Whistler,
: Harry Scroggs, and Young Peter Jack
; son worked out in the days gone by.
He is a smart, keen boxer, and his
! fight with the clever Slovakian cliam
, pion should be full of thrills.

Tonight's Puzzle
Tonight that energetic promoter,
Signor Humbert Fugazy, is putting on
another one of his fistic treats, this
time at the Polo Grounds in New
York City. As you know, Mr. Peter
Latzo, of Scranton, Pa., is defending
his world's welterweight title against
Mr. Joseph Dundee of Baltimore, Md.,
and though many seem to think that
Mr. Dundee will knock Mr. Latzo for
a row of polo ponies, I cannot see it
that way myself. Dundee's backers
probably base their opinions on the
fact that their man technically knock
ed out the w. k. Mickey Walker in
eight rounds, whereas the best that
Mr. Latzo could do was to defeat the
popular Mickey on points in ten
rounds.
But Mr. Dundee happened to come
along a month after Mr. Latzo had
"softened up" Mr. Walker, as the boys
say, and anybody who gets himself
knocked out in one round even by
Eddie Roberts, as Mr. Dundee did, is
not going to win Pete Latzo's title,
to my way of thinking. And don't
forget that Latzo knocked out Willie
Harmon, while Dundee merely won
the decision from Willie. However,
most of the interest in this fight seems
to center on the challenger's chances,
so let us take a look at Mr. Samuel
Lazzaro, which is Dundee's real name,
and see how he stacks up.
Joe is an Italian-American, he lives
in Baltimore, and he is managed by
the belligerent Max Waxman, who
was recently the victim of a cowardly
stabbing attack by one or more men
in a New York hotel. Joe's chief
claim to ring greatness, besides his
feat of stopping ex-champion Mickey

j Walker, was his game come-back
i against Eddie Roberts, in their second
bout, which took place before a packed
house in Madison Square Garden. In
the fourth round, Roberts knocked
I Dundee down with a right to the jaw.
