# EIGHT RARE VOLUMES ADDED TO COLLECTION IN STANFORD LIBRARY
## Donor's Object to Foster Appreciation for Art Of Printing 
### 
Eight more rare books, notable
examples of beautiful printing, bind
ing, and illustrating, were added by
Mr. Albert Bender yesterday to the
collection of fine books which he has
been donating to the Stanford Library.
The additions are all copies from
limited editions and are very rare.
They include four volumes printed at
the John Henry Nash Press in San
Francisco, two done by the Grabhorn
Brothers of the same city, and two by
Bruce Rogers. Besides these, there
are thirty pages taken from various
books mounted for exhibition pur
poses.
Bender, a San Francisco business
man and a lover of fine books, has
already donated a number of rare
volumes to the library, with the idea
of stimulating an appreciation of the
printing art among Stanford students.
The show cases in the rotunda of the
library in which the Bender collection
is now on display are a gift of Mr.
Bender and three of his friends, Mor
gan Gunst, Lawrence Strassburger,
and Jesse W. Lilienthal.
