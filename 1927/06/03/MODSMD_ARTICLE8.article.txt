# ANGLO-RUSSIAN WAR TALK NONSENSE, EXPLAINS STANFORD RESEARCH EXPERT
## Soviet Politicians "Talking for Home Consumption," Economic Status Is Upset, Says Hutchinson 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
Scareheads about the Anglo-Russian
break in each new edition of the city
papers have stirred up new interest in
the mysteries of Soviet management.
First-hand information on the "inside"
situation existing in Russia today has
been obtained from one of the best
known authorities on the subject, Dr.
Lincoln Hutchinson, who is now on
the campus doing research work on
the present-day economic situation in
Russia.
Dr. Hutchinson has been professor
of economics at the University of Cali
fornia, special investigator under Her
bert Hoover of the recent Russian
famine, economic advisor of the
Czecho-Slovakian government, and
United States commercial attache at
London. For the past two years he has
been at Stanford.
Russian Trade Safe
"Russia's trade will not suffer from
the British break in diplomatic rela
tions," Dr. Hutchinson says. "Its trade
is affected by the economic status

within Russia, and ;f the country is
safe for foreign capital, trade will
flourish whether political relations are
good or bad. The basic trouble in Rus
sia is over-population, and the Soviet
government has failed because its
leaders lack not education but experi
ence. Some kind of stability must be
evolved to regain economic prosperity,
and for the last five years there has
been a decided trend back toward
private ownership.
"All talk, of war by Russian leaders
is meant for home consumption, for
politicians there are much the same
as in this country. Resentment is be
ing aroused against England merely to
gain more support for the Soviet
regime. The whole thing has been
exaggerated by the newspapers, and
the most important effect will be felt
within Russia itself," Dr. Hutchinson
believes.
Socialistic experiments on the eco
nomic side have proved almost fatal,
Dr. Hutchinson believes. His opinion
is that "the soviet government con
trols all big-scale production, and what
is left of the middle class engages in
small business enterprises only. The
administrative machinery controlling
production is top-heavy, inefficient,
and most unprofitable. Those in charge
are now endeavoring to establish a
balance by which as much government
ownership as possible can be recon
ciled with the private ownership
necessary to promote any kind of indi
vidual effort."
Dr. Hutchinson says the French re
volt was a mere nothing by compari
son to the Russian revolution, an up
rising started by idealists, then made
possible by the selfish motives of the
peasants and city laborers. Those
idealists who started the revolt had
good intentions, and those in charge
of the government now mean well. Yet
they intend to improve conditions in
their own way. So far they have
failed.
Recognition Belittled
Dr. Hutchinson belittles the impor
tance of official recognition. All the
important countries except America
and England are on diplomatic terms
with the Soviet, but the future of the
Russian people depends on their eco
nomic status alone. The United States
will not recognize Russia because the
Bolshevists have refused to recognize
debts owed this country, and have
refused to cease broadcasting of "red"
propaganda.

private ownership.
"All talk, of war by Russian leaders
is meant for home consumption, for
politicians there are much the same
as in this country. Resentment is be
ing aroused against England merely to
gain more support for the Soviet
regime. The whole thing has been
exaggerated by the newspapers, and
the most important effect will be felt
within Russia itself," Dr. Hutchinson
believes.
Socialistic experiments on the eco
nomic side have proved almost fatal,
Dr. Hutchinson believes. His opinion
is that "the soviet government con
trols all big-scale production, and what
is left of the middle class engages in
small business enterprises only. The
administrative machinery controlling
production is top-heavy, inefficient,
and most unprofitable. Those in charge
are now endeavoring to establish a
balance by which as much government
ownership as possible can be recon
ciled with the private ownership
necessary to promote any kind of indi
vidual effort."
Dr. Hutchinson says the French re
volt was a mere nothing by compari
son to the Russian revolution, an up
rising started by idealists, then made
possible by the selfish motives of the
peasants and city laborers. Those
idealists who started the revolt had
good intentions, and those in charge
of the government now mean well. Yet
they intend to improve conditions in
their own way. So far they have
failed.
Recognition Belittled
Dr. Hutchinson belittles the impor
tance of official recognition. All the
important countries except America
and England are on diplomatic terms
with the Soviet, but the future of the
Russian people depends on their eco
nomic status alone. The United States
will not recognize Russia because the
Bolshevists have refused to recognize
debts owed this country, and have
refused to cease broadcasting of "red"
propaganda.
Scareheads about the Anglo-Russian
break in each new edition of the city
papers have stirred up new interest in
the mysteries of Soviet management.
First-hand information on the "inside"
situation existing in Russia today has
been obtained from one of the best
known authorities on the subject, Dr.
Lincoln Hutchinson, who is now on
the campus doing research work on
the present-day economic situation in
Russia.
Dr. Hutchinson has been professor
of economics at the University of Cali
fornia, special investigator under Her
bert Hoover of the recent Russian
famine, economic advisor of the
Czecho-Slovakian government, and
United States commercial attache at
London. For the past two years he has
been at Stanford.
Russian Trade Safe
"Russia's trade will not suffer from
the British break in diplomatic rela
tions," Dr. Hutchinson says. "Its trade
is affected by the economic status

within Russia, and ;f the country is
safe for foreign capital, trade will
flourish whether political relations are
good or bad. The basic trouble in Rus
sia is over-population, and the Soviet
government has failed because its
leaders lack not education but experi
ence. Some kind of stability must be
evolved to regain economic prosperity,
and for the last five years there has
been a decided trend back toward
private ownership.
