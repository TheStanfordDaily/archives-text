YOU'D BE PROUD
TO OWN
If you are going home or just on
a little vacation, you will want good,
strong, substantial and practical luggage
by all means. You will want luggage that you
will not be ashamed to claim or carry should your
friends be with you. You will want luggage that will stand
the gaff of the baggage-smasher, too. By saving a few cents
on a case or bag you may lose several dollars' worth of your belong
ings. You do not need, necessarily, to pay a big price for what
you need, but you do need to be sure that it is of the quality that
will undergo the above test, and if it will do that it will fill the bill. You
will find every one of these requirements in our luggage and at the same time
at prices that will please those who must adhere to a limit in their purchases.
Our large luggage department beckons the
thrifty buyer to visit it at the earliest possible
convenience. In the basement of our store.
