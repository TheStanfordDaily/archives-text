# CARDINALS LOSE IN TWO EXHIBITION NET MATCHES
## HERRINGTON DEFEATED Visiting Doubles Team Wins Three Straight Sets From Stanford 
### Merle Emry 
Tennis on the Stanford campus for
this year came to a disappointing
close Saturday afternoon at the ex
hibition matches with both Cardinal
teams losing to the invading players.
In the first match of the day, Alan
Herrington, Stanford's ranking player
number four, lost to Jerry Stratford,
former U.S.C. net captain, by the
close score of 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. In the dou
bles contest Bill Johnston and Peck
Griffin of national fame won three
straight sets from Lionel Ogden and
Cranston Holman, the outcome being
6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
Herrington Shows Good Form
Starting out in the first set of his
match, Herrington showed true tourna
ment form, hitting the ball hard and
placing it with accuracy. His court
strategy was baffling to his southern
opponent who failed to meet the fast
offense established by the hard-driving
Cardinal.
At the beginning of the second set,
Herrington assumed a definite defen
sive game and replaced his drives
with snappy chops. This gave Strat
ford, who was better adapted to this
style of playing, the opportunity to
forge ahead and finally climax the
match by taking the third set.
Although the Cardinal pair failed to
win a set in the doubles contest
against the one-time winners of the
national doubles title, it put up a
splendid fight in face of the stiff oppo
sition of Johnston and Griffin, a fight
that proved its worth as an exhibition
match by thrilling the thousand-or-so
spectators time and again. "Little
Bill's" playing was acclaimed as the
best that has been seen on local courts
for some time. Both he and Griffin
covered their ground in a better fash
ion than did Holman and Ogden who
frequently bunched together and left
the alleys of the court open. In addi
tion, Holman had an off day as his
lobbing was poor and his net playing
not up to standard.
