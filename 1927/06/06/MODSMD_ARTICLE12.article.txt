# STANFORD ESTATES TO BECOME REFUGE FOR WILD GAME ANIMALS
## Entire University Territory Set Apart by State For Preserve 
### 
Stanford's Farm will become a same
refuge in accordance with a bill to
that effect signed recently by Gover
nor Young, according to word from
the Fish and Game Commission which
has just been received by the Comp
troller's Office. Tlie signature of this
bill is the culmination of a campaign
begun by the Stanford Zoology Club
in 1921.
Through the co-operation of the
State Fish and Game Commission and
Senator Herbert C. Jones, two bills
previously were presented to the legis
lature and passed by that body, but
each was vetoed by the former gover
nor.
The area of this new game refuge,
which will be one of the most unique
in existence, includes all of the cam
pus and all of the foothill and moun
tain properties of the University, mak
ing a total of over 7500 acres. Within
this area there are two lakes of con
siderable size, Searsville and Felt
Lakes, which will constitute a refuge
for water fowl.
Tliere is considerable brush and
timber land at the rear of the tract
which affords refuge for various wild
birds and small game animals and
even for deer. During the last few
years several deer have been ranging
on the ridge to the east of Searsville
Lake.
The low lands afford ground for
quail and doves which are numerous,
and for peasants, a few of which
have come on to the University prop
erty from the Alviso district. Several
bands of wild pigeons which recently
have returned to this area have been
almost wiped out by hunters. .
There are several unique features
about the new gÂ«me refuge, for this
refuge will probably be the most ac
cessible of the State Game Refuges.
The fact that a department of zoology
will be located in the center of this
game refuge is an unusual feature.
The bill provides that any person
who hunts, pursues, takes, kills or
destroys, or has in his possession any
species of bird or mammal, or parts
thereof, or any fire arms, in any game
refuge, except upon written permit
from the Board of Fish and Game
Commissioners, is guilty of a misde
meanor punishable by fine of not less
than $25 or more than $500, or by
imprisonment in the county jail not
less than 25 days or more than 150
days, or by both fine and imprison
ment.
