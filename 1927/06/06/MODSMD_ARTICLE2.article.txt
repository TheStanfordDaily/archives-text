# SENIOR, JUNIOR POLO TEAMS TO CLASH FOR CHAMPIONSHIP TODAY
## 
### 
Playing on the highway field at 2
o'clock this afternoon, the senior and
junior polo squads clash for the an
nual interclas-s championship title.
Both teams are about equal in
strength since the juniors beat the
freshmen 16 to 0, and the seniors won
from the sophomores 12 to 0' in previ
ous games. The fact that the '27 team
has two first-string men gives them
the slight edge for victory. The juniors
on the other hand have shown better
teamwork and made more accurate
shots in previous games.
The starting line-ups will probably
be:
Seniors Juniors
Rothrock 1 Austin
Evans 2 Cox
Drown 3 Weymouth
Trotter 4 Connolly
Substitutes: Seniors â€” Lefler and
Dailey.
