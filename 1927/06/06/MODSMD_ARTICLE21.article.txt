# To Dink Templeton

### 
An editorial to Dink Templeton is apropos at this time. A word or
two of praise is coming to the coach not because he has beaten the
University of California for the last three years, or because he defeated
the t niversial of Southern C&lifcYriila hi the dual meet this year, or
because lie brought a national title to Stanford by winning the LC.4-A
Competition at Philadelphia, or even because he won the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate track meet Saturday at Los Angeles, but rather we take
pen (typewriter) in hand to praise the "Boy Wonder" for the methods
he used in winning the before mentioned victories, lie has proved the
master strategist of the cinderpath.
l ie has used his men to the best of their ability, and at all times lie has
taken the welfare of the athletes into consideration. He never overworks
one of his charges. He refused to allow McKinnon to run in Los
Angeles because he felt the young man had competed enough for one
year. He figured another day of running might ruin a miler so young.
He did not care to ruin McKinnon's future chances even with the final
meet of the season at stake.
He withdrew Spencer from the P.C.I, entrance list when the captain
elect was obviously out of shape. Spencer was sure of placing well up
even though handicapped by his nervous condition, but Templeton saw
no need of taking the chance of injuring a college runner perhaps
permanently.
With McKinnon and Spencer out of the meet Templeton had to use
every bit of his reserve strategy in order to retain the title of the Coast,
which was captured last season. The Stanford coach was matched
against Christie of California, the veteran coach of the country; he was
matching his ability against Dean Cromwell of LT.S.C., and the best
coaches from the North. The story of how Templeton entered Goodccll,
a javelin thrower, in the mile, when only four men appeared at the start
ing pole, and how lie ran two high jumpers and a broad jumper in the
mile relay when only California and U.S.C. started teams, is well known
to the sport followers on the Coast by now.
The four points obtained in the relay and the mile run turned a
Trojan victory into a Cardinal success. It proved beyond doubt that
Templeton is the cleverest coach in this section of the country. It won't
be long before rules will be enacted in an effort to combat Templeton's
strategy on the track, as they have been made in the past to try to keep
up with Pop Warner on the football field.

against Christie of California, the veteran coach of the country; he was
matching his ability against Dean Cromwell of LT.S.C., and the best
coaches from the North. The story of how Templeton entered Goodccll,
a javelin thrower, in the mile, when only four men appeared at the start
ing pole, and how lie ran two high jumpers and a broad jumper in the
mile relay when only California and U.S.C. started teams, is well known
to the sport followers on the Coast by now.
The four points obtained in the relay and the mile run turned a
Trojan victory into a Cardinal success. It proved beyond doubt that
Templeton is the cleverest coach in this section of the country. It won't
be long before rules will be enacted in an effort to combat Templeton's
strategy on the track, as they have been made in the past to try to keep
up with Pop Warner on the football field.
An editorial to Dink Templeton is apropos at this time. A word or
two of praise is coming to the coach not because he has beaten the
University of California for the last three years, or because he defeated
the t niversial of Southern C&lifcYriila hi the dual meet this year, or
because lie brought a national title to Stanford by winning the LC.4-A
Competition at Philadelphia, or even because he won the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate track meet Saturday at Los Angeles, but rather we take
pen (typewriter) in hand to praise the "Boy Wonder" for the methods
he used in winning the before mentioned victories, lie has proved the
master strategist of the cinderpath.
l ie has used his men to the best of their ability, and at all times lie has
taken the welfare of the athletes into consideration. He never overworks
one of his charges. He refused to allow McKinnon to run in Los
Angeles because he felt the young man had competed enough for one
year. He figured another day of running might ruin a miler so young.
He did not care to ruin McKinnon's future chances even with the final
meet of the season at stake.
He withdrew Spencer from the P.C.I, entrance list when the captain
elect was obviously out of shape. Spencer was sure of placing well up
even though handicapped by his nervous condition, but Templeton saw
no need of taking the chance of injuring a college runner perhaps
permanently.
With McKinnon and Spencer out of the meet Templeton had to use
every bit of his reserve strategy in order to retain the title of the Coast,
which was captured last season. The Stanford coach was matched
against Christie of California, the veteran coach of the country; he was
matching his ability against Dean Cromwell of LT.S.C., and the best
coaches from the North. The story of how Templeton entered Goodccll,
a javelin thrower, in the mile, when only four men appeared at the start
ing pole, and how lie ran two high jumpers and a broad jumper in the
mile relay when only California and U.S.C. started teams, is well known
