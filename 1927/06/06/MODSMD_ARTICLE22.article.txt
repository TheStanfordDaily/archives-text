# Carrying Out Instructions
## 
### 
If a college student can not read instructions, comprehend them, and
then follow them, it would appear that a university education is a mere
waste of money and time. Last week at the primary elections for
A.S.S.U. officers a large number of votes were declared void because
they were not marked in the right manner, and yet at the top of each
ballot there is written (in English) perfectly clear instructions of how
to mark one's choice.
Tomorrow is' the day of the final vote, and it would be well if all
the ballots were marked in the prescribed manner. There are but four
simple rules to follow. Here they arc â€”study them:
1. Ballot is void unless marked in ink.
2. Any mark or marks on any part or parts of the ballot, except the
intended "X," makes the whole ballot void.
3. Do not fold your ballots. (About fifty per cent of the ballots were
folded last week.)
4. No names are to be "written in" on the ballot of the finals.
