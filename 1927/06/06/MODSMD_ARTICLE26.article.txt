# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Women's Conference met last Wed
nesday night; met to represent the
opinion of the women on the campus
regarding their newly discovered Right
to Independence. Since the men on
the campus were kind, but perhaps
tactless, enough to remind the women
recently that they are able to think
and even judge for themselves, there
has been much talk among the women
concerning the matter.
And on the whole, at first, they rath
er liked the idea of considering them
selves able to think intelligently. As
a result there has been among the
women themselves a veritable Fourth
of-July flare of theoretical independ
ence, the outcome of which has siz
zled down, as expressed through Con
ference, their representative body, into
frightened suggestions relating to the
advisability and expediency of half
hour or hour additions to present reg
ulations for upperclassmen.
The consensus seems to be that
freshmen and sophomores lack respon
sibility entirely and so must abide by
existing rules (although equal rights
with upperclassmen for week-ends
were considered in discussion). We
have two questions in mind: First,
just what is the factor which gives a
freshman an added sense of responsi
bility on Friday and Saturday over

mere week nights; we might even be
broad-minded and phrase the regula
tion to read "Fridays, Saturdays, and
holidays." And secondly, what exactly
is this subtle difference which distin
guishes an underclassman from an
upperclassman? Exactly when does
the flooding Sense-of-Responsibility de
scend upon her?
Granted, however, that a freshman
is in the nature of things utterly ir
responsible, and needs the kind and
all-wise mothering of maturely minded
upperclassmen, our frank opinion is
that these are not the freshmen Stan
ford wants. If a Stanford woman
cannot learn to stand on her own feet
with reasonable stability, as she must
surely learn to do eventually, the
sooner she departs the better.
Stanford women are afraid —afraid
to trust the other four hundred and
ninety-nine; afraid of what outsiders
will say; afraid to give themselves a
chance to show themselves that they
can think and judge intelligently. In
truth, we are a bit tired and dis
gusted with the whole thing and have
decided that Stanford women had bet
ter be given what they want. Has any
one yet considered changing the regu
lations to read nine o'clock? Perhaps,
after all, that would be safer and wiser
and more expedient.

sooner she departs the better.
Stanford women are afraid —afraid
to trust the other four hundred and
ninety-nine; afraid of what outsiders
will say; afraid to give themselves a
chance to show themselves that they
can think and judge intelligently. In
truth, we are a bit tired and dis
gusted with the whole thing and have
decided that Stanford women had bet
ter be given what they want. Has any
one yet considered changing the regu
lations to read nine o'clock? Perhaps,
after all, that would be safer and wiser
and more expedient.

The Editor, Sir:
Women's Conference met last Wed
nesday night; met to represent the
opinion of the women on the campus
regarding their newly discovered Right
to Independence. Since the men on
the campus were kind, but perhaps
tactless, enough to remind the women
recently that they are able to think
and even judge for themselves, there
has been much talk among the women
concerning the matter.
And on the whole, at first, they rath
er liked the idea of considering them
selves able to think intelligently. As
a result there has been among the
women themselves a veritable Fourth
of-July flare of theoretical independ
ence, the outcome of which has siz
zled down, as expressed through Con
ference, their representative body, into
frightened suggestions relating to the
advisability and expediency of half
hour or hour additions to present reg
ulations for upperclassmen.
The consensus seems to be that
freshmen and sophomores lack respon
sibility entirely and so must abide by
existing rules (although equal rights
with upperclassmen for week-ends
were considered in discussion). We
have two questions in mind: First,
just what is the factor which gives a
freshman an added sense of responsi
bility on Friday and Saturday over

mere week nights; we might even be
broad-minded and phrase the regula
tion to read "Fridays, Saturdays, and
holidays." And secondly, what exactly
is this subtle difference which distin
guishes an underclassman from an
upperclassman? Exactly when does
the flooding Sense-of-Responsibility de
scend upon her?
Granted, however, that a freshman
is in the nature of things utterly ir
responsible, and needs the kind and
all-wise mothering of maturely minded
upperclassmen, our frank opinion is
that these are not the freshmen Stan
ford wants. If a Stanford woman
cannot learn to stand on her own feet
with reasonable stability, as she must
surely learn to do eventually, the
sooner she departs the better.
