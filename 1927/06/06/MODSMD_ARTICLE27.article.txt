Lud-in-the-Mist. By Hope Mirrlees.
(Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. $2.50.)

Lud-in-the-Mist is the capital city of
Dorimere, which is just this side of
the Debatable Mountains beyond
which lie Fairyland. But don't think,
therefore, that Lud-in-the-Mist is a
fragile and sentimental tale about the
shy little dears that Conan Doyle
thinks still exist. On the contrary,
fairies and fairyland are in very poor
repute in sober, bourgeois Dorimere,
and fairy fruit —well, to say that any
one has eaten fairy fruit is equivalent
in the minds of all respectable Dori
merites to the foulest blasphemy, and
for anyone really to have tasted the
filthy stuff, the worst possible of
crimes.
We aren't sure just what Miss Mirr
lees means by "fairy fruit," but we
do like very much the satire on ethics
implied in making what are to us
quite ordinary words, the name of the
Unforgivable Sin of Dorimere. By a
process of deduction from its repu
tation in the minds of the unimagina
tive folk of Lud-in-the-Mist, and from
the symptoms immediately appearing
in those who have tasted it, we gather
that to eat fairy fruit means to dream,
to dare to depart from the common
place conventional sobriety, but one of
Miss Mirrlees' charms is that you are
never quite sure of anything.
Mingled with her fantastic irony,
Miss Mirrlees presents at least three
good mysteries: one, what bewitched
Ranulph, the son of the Lord Mayor
of Lud-in-the-Mist; two, what hap
pened to the lovely young daughters
of all the prominent townspeople after
they had eaten fairy fruit and danced
to Willy Wisp's fiddle; and three, the
solution of a thirty years' old murder,
and through it the discovery of the
manner by which fairy fruit was being
smuggled into Dorimere. And this
third mystery is as absorbing as any
modern detective tale. Let any reader
see if he can foresee the solution!
Miss Mirrlees has this i.i common
with Cabell, that she tells of the
strangest happenings in the most, mat
ter-of-fact way, and presents you with
facts that apparently ft re full of sig

nificance for her but which to you are
only symbols pregnant with a meaning
you feel must be there but which you
can't solve —like the shorn lock of
Don Manuel in Figures of Earth. And
in her own characteristic style, she
writes quite as beautifully as Cabell.
There are fused so many dissimilar
elements to make "Lud-in-the-Mist"
what it is that it should have a very
general appeal. There is satire and
irony for the cynic and the sociologist,
fantasy for some, a touch of mysticism
for others, rather a lot of humor, and
smuggling, murder, and sudden death.
The wholly literal minded, who like
to have everything demonstrated and
explained, will probably be the only
group both bored and annoyed.—Mar
