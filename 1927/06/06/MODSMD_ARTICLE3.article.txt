# DAVIS' STUDENTS GIVE CREDITABLE ONE-ACT PLAY PERFORMANCES
## Excellent Ability of Casts Adds Much to Success Of Performance 
### J. R 
It was a cmiitable performance
that the members of Gordon Davis'
play presentation class gave, when
j four one-act plays were presented to
I the public in the Little Theatre Friday
afternoon.
First Play Least Creditable
The first play, "The Managers," by
Joseph C. Lincoln, a Cape Cod comedy,
was the least creditable of the after
noon, due mostly to the fact that the
play itself is rather slow moving and
that the "surprise" outcome was too
apparent. The two "managing" uncles,
played by Robert Cathcart and John
Atwill, were splendidly portrayed, and,
in .comparison, the girl, played by
Edyth Allen, fell a little below the
standard of the afternoon.
"Meet the Missus" made up for any
deficiencies of the first play. Kenyon
Nicholson, the author, has put in it
lines and situations that are at once
natural and humorous. Robert Cath
cart, who was cast as the tipsy hus
band, made his interpretation less stiff
than in the first play. Dorothy Gamier,
as the wife, and Chesterlyn Thomas,
as the other woman, carried most of
the comedy well.
Dave Painter Praised
In "Simoon," written by August
Swindberg, the drama of the after
noon rose to a climax. David Painter,
in the role of the demented French
soldier, gave the best male per
formance of the afternoon in his in
terpretation of the part. Dorothy Gar
nier, as the girl, far surpassed her
performance in "Meet the Missus."
Parts Well Filled
The last play, "A Question of Prin
ciple," by Martin Flavin, while not
hilarious, was humorous, ran smoothly,
and the parts were all well filled.
Morris Doyle, the ditch-digger, gave
a convincing performance.
John Atwill, as the excitable banker,
and Clarence Ricklefs, as the judge,
gave logical interpretations of their
parts, but Powell Carpenter, as the
clergyman with "no hellfire," was the
best in the play. Robert Sears, as the
experienced Communist, was fair,
while the tough girl, played by Elsie
Snyder, though her part was small,
made the best of her meager lines.

formance of the afternoon in his in
terpretation of the part. Dorothy Gar
nier, as the girl, far surpassed her
performance in "Meet the Missus."
Parts Well Filled
The last play, "A Question of Prin
ciple," by Martin Flavin, while not
hilarious, was humorous, ran smoothly,
and the parts were all well filled.
Morris Doyle, the ditch-digger, gave
a convincing performance.
John Atwill, as the excitable banker,
and Clarence Ricklefs, as the judge,
gave logical interpretations of their
parts, but Powell Carpenter, as the
clergyman with "no hellfire," was the
best in the play. Robert Sears, as the
experienced Communist, was fair,
while the tough girl, played by Elsie
Snyder, though her part was small,
made the best of her meager lines.
