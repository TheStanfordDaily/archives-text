# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
After Molla Mallory defeated Eliza
beth Ryan in that thrilling three-set
match at Forest Hills, Long Island,
last August, the victor was immedi
ately surrounded by a milling mob of
friends and well-wishers, anxious to
congratulate the new champion. The
loser walked alone toward the club
house, almost unnoticed. A tall,
bronzed, athletic-looking man strode
after her, shook her by the hand, and
walked to the clubhouse with her. The
man was Sam Hardy. It was a kind,
courteous thing to do, which few
others would have thought of in the
excitement following Molla's splendid
victory. But Sam Hardy Is like that.
Mr. Hardy, who edits Spalding's
Annual Tennis Guide, has, in forty
years of tennis, won more champion
ships and cups and prizes than most
of the ranking players of today can
boast of. He began his winning ca
reer at the age of fifteen years, when
he and his brother Sumner won the
Pacific Coast doubles championship
for the first time. Young Sam liked
that title, and so kept either that or
the Coast singles crown in the family
from 1892 through 1900. Then he re
tired from tennis.
Ten years later we find a man
named Hardy in the semi-finals of the
doubles tournament at Wimbledon,
England. In 1911, partnered by J. C.
Parke, he reached the finals. Yes,
same fellow —Sam Hardy! In 1917
one S. Hardy, registered from Chi
cago, won, among many other titles,
the United States clay court singles
and doubles championship. He re-won
the doubles title in 1918 and 1919.
Sam Hardy again!

Nineteen twenty. Getting pretty old
now! So Mr. Hardy merely captained
the United States team that went to
England, New Zealand, and Australia,
and brought back the prized Davis
Cup. Sam returned via Manila, Japan,
and China, playing en route. In 1922
he won thirteen championships on the
Riviera, and in 1923, '24, and '25 he
aided in winning the veterans' doubles
championship of the United States.
Think the French will take the
Davis Cup? Get Sam Hardy to play,
and everything will be 0.K.!

A Hardy Perennial
After Molla Mallory defeated Eliza
beth Ryan in that thrilling three-set
match at Forest Hills, Long Island,
last August, the victor was immedi
ately surrounded by a milling mob of
friends and well-wishers, anxious to
congratulate the new champion. The
loser walked alone toward the club
house, almost unnoticed. A tall,
bronzed, athletic-looking man strode
after her, shook her by the hand, and
walked to the clubhouse with her. The
man was Sam Hardy. It was a kind,
courteous thing to do, which few
others would have thought of in the
excitement following Molla's splendid
victory. But Sam Hardy Is like that.
Mr. Hardy, who edits Spalding's
Annual Tennis Guide, has, in forty
years of tennis, won more champion
ships and cups and prizes than most
of the ranking players of today can
boast of. He began his winning ca
reer at the age of fifteen years, when
he and his brother Sumner won the
Pacific Coast doubles championship
for the first time. Young Sam liked
that title, and so kept either that or
the Coast singles crown in the family
from 1892 through 1900. Then he re
tired from tennis.
Ten years later we find a man
named Hardy in the semi-finals of the
doubles tournament at Wimbledon,
England. In 1911, partnered by J. C.
Parke, he reached the finals. Yes,
same fellow —Sam Hardy! In 1917
one S. Hardy, registered from Chi
cago, won, among many other titles,
the United States clay court singles
and doubles championship. He re-won
the doubles title in 1918 and 1919.
Sam Hardy again!

Nineteen twenty. Getting pretty old
now! So Mr. Hardy merely captained
the United States team that went to
England, New Zealand, and Australia,
and brought back the prized Davis
Cup. Sam returned via Manila, Japan,
and China, playing en route. In 1922
he won thirteen championships on the
Riviera, and in 1923, '24, and '25 he
aided in winning the veterans' doubles
championship of the United States.
