### 
Answering an alarm at the A.T.O.
house at 7:30 o'clock Friday morning,
the Stanford fire department found
flames spreading through the base
ment which resulted in burning the
stairs before the fire was under con

Upon later investigation no further
damage was reported except to wake
the inmates in time for "8 o'clocks."
The origin of the fire is believed to
have been from a hot water heater.
