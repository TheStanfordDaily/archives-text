(rJSjfWAY dull care! Note Book j
not in? I just can't hear you!
The last five minutes of May lec
tures... Eternity! Happier the song
of the Bumble Bee ... in the Hills.
Or the chug-chug of a Motor Boat
...down by the Sea! Test! Friday?
Professor, How Could You!
Worked like Holy Harry! Tough j
job, this getting ready for a career.
No foolin.' But it's all over now...
for a while. I'm sittin' on top o' the
world, under blue skies, and I'm
going to play... play... play...
I'll say it's a wonderful w0r1d....
So long, see you in September!
Well...have a good time... vet a good tan...
lot's o' luck to you... come back healthy and
happy!
