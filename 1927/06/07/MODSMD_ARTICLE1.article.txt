With two national athletic champion
ships already in the hag, Stanford seems
destined to add a third honor to the list
when the Cardinal varsity competes in the
annual intercollegiate net tournament at
the Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia,
beginning June 20. Cranston Holman,
Lionel Ogden, Ralph McElvenny, and
Alan Herrington will make the trip, leav

Holman Favored

paired with Ogden is expected to capture
the doubles. Holman has been runner
up in the singles in the past two years to
Edward Chandler of California, who
graduated last June.
The Stanford doubles team reached the
finals last year, losing to Tom Stow and
Chandler. In the recent matches with
California Holman and Ogden decisively
beat the ranking Blue and Gold team of
Stow and Dick Hoogs, and should have
no more difficulty than they have experi
enced in the past in whipping representa
tives from the eastern colleges.

team will enter the Wilmington tourna

considerable handicap, especially when
combined with the long train ride.
After the Merion play the team will
campaign in various tournaments through
out the summer. Holman, who ranked
eighth nationally two years ago, will at
tempt to regain his former position, and
will also be a serious contender for the
Davis Cup team. Ogden, McElvenny,
