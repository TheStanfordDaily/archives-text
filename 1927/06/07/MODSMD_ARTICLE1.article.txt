# RACQUET TEAM WILL COMPETE IN PHILADELPHIA
## Holman, McElvenny, Ogden And Herrington Will Leave for East OTHER MEETS PLANNED Wilmington Contests Will Offer Practice in Lawn Tennis for Men 
### Milton Silverman 
With two national athletic champion
ships already in the hag, Stanford seems
destined to add a third honor to the list
when the Cardinal varsity competes in the
annual intercollegiate net tournament at
the Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia,
beginning June 20. Cranston Holman,
Lionel Ogden, Ralph McElvenny, and
Alan Herrington will make the trip, leav
ing immediately after finals.
Holman Favored
Holman, three-year Stanford star, is
the heavy favorite to win the singles and
paired with Ogden is expected to capture
the doubles. Holman has been runner
up in the singles in the past two years to
Edward Chandler of California, who
graduated last June.
The Stanford doubles team reached the
finals last year, losing to Tom Stow and
Chandler. In the recent matches with
California Holman and Ogden decisively
beat the ranking Blue and Gold team of
Stow and Dick Hoogs, and should have
no more difficulty than they have experi
enced in the past in whipping representa
tives from the eastern colleges.
Preliminary Matches Set
Preliminary to the the
team will enter the Wilmington tourna
ment for a week's practice on grass. The
change from the asphalt courts at Stan
ford to the lawn courts in the East is a
considerable handicap, especially when
combined with the long train ride.
After the Merion play the team will
campaign in various tournaments through
out the summer. Holman, who ranked
eighth nationally two years ago, will at
tempt to regain his former position, and
will also be a serious contender for the
Davis Cup team. Ogden, McElvenny,
run so Templeton placed him, Spencer,
Sparling, and Stew Way on the bench and
then out of the Coast meet.
Victories this season augur well for
further honors next year. A great deal
of the strength of the 1927 team will be
carried over into 1928 and 1929. Many
sophomores as well as juniors earned
their letters.
The greatest loss to the team will be
the ending of the collegiate competition of
Biff Hoffman, shot and discus victor; Ted
Shipkey, javelin tosser; Captain Law
rence Babcock, quarter-miler; Fred Rich
man, sprinter: Bob Swain, miler and two
miler; Tom Work, high jumper; and Sid
Meeks, broad jumper.
Many Return
Captain-elect Bud Spencer; Clarence
West, hurdler; Rufe Ranney, two-miler;
Tom Joaquin, javelin thrower; Bob King,
high jumper; Kim Dyer, broad jumper;
Taffy Evans, discus thrower; and Jack
Bullis, hurdler, all have another year of
competition.
Spencer, Joaquin, King, and West
should all be particularly valuable to next
year's team. Ross Nichols, hurdler, has
two more years of competition. Alex Mc-
Kinnon, miler; Bill Clum and Tom Moss,
half-milcrs; Bob Syer and Jack Dales,
quarter-milers; and John Lauritzen,
sprinter, are sophomores who earned their
letters in track events.
Ward Edmonds, who has starred in the
pole vault; A1 Forster, Herb Fleishhack
er, and Stew Way, weight men; Fred
Zombro, broad jumper; Bill Sparling and
Ross Goodcell, javelin throwers, have won
their letters also during their first year
of varsity competition.
With the addition of Eric Krenz. star
shot putter and discus thrower; Gibson
Kingsbury, sprinter; John Morrison,
quarter-miler, and several other freshmen,
the 1928 Cardinal track and field varsity
bids fair to uphold the records set this
year.
