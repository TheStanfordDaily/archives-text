# Ticket Sale For 1927 Senior Play Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
Seats for "So This Is London," final
offering of the Dramatic Council's
1926-27 season, will be placed on sale
tomorrow at 1 o'clock at the Old
Union. Tickets for the Senior Farce,
scheduled for presentation the final
day of the school year, June 15, may
be obtained at prices of $1 and 75
cents, with the sale continuing from
1 to 5 o'clock each afternoon.
This week's rehearsals will end the
strenuous series of practices which
Gordon Davis has held in order to
whip the Goodrich comedy into shape
following its selection. With the play
practically ready for'presentation now,
only as many rehearsals will be held
next week as are necessary to keep
the play on edge for actual perform
ance and for shaping the action in
finished order.
Schwartz Plays
"So This Is London" piarks the
farewell of Leonard Schwartz, who as
the juvenile lead, "Junior" Draper,
will add another chapter to his past
work in "You And I," "Dulcy," "Polly
With A Past," "So This Is Eden," and
other Stanford plays of the past four
years. Draper, the young American,
and Elinor Beauchamp, the English
girl, are the two around whose love
"So This Is London" motivates, with
mutual parental dislikes checking the
romance.
Two Scenes Outstanding
The cleverest moments of the com
edy occur in the two "scenes-within
scenes," where the American shoe
manufacturer fantastically pictures
English incarnate stupidities, con
trasted with American Quietness and
tact, and where the English father
later reciprocates with an exaggerated
and biased conception of their Ameri
can cousins.
But the satirical concepts of the
two families are faced with an acid
test when, thanks to the two young
lovers and the connivance of Lady
Duxworth, played by Elizabeth Wil
bur, America meets England face to
face. And the result —well, that's the
reason for Stanford's presentation of
"So This Is London."
