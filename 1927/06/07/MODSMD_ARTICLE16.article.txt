# SENIOR POLO PLAYERS TAKE CLOSE VICTORY, TITLE FROM JUNIORS
## 1928 Men Lead Until Brown Breaks Tie by Last Minute Goal 
### Merle Emry 
Making a fifteen-yard goal just as
the final gong rang, the senior polo
squad won a closely fought 4-to-3 vic
tory over the junior team yesterday
afternoon and thereby captured the
interclass championship title.
The game was featured with excel
lent horsemanship, both sides riding
fast and making accurate shots. Tak
ing the jump at the beginning of the
first period, the junior men, riding for
the whites, asumed the lead. The sen
iors were unabte to get going and find
the line of the ball. Tex Thompson on
a quick turn played the ball down the
field and with his teammates riding
off the red-coated seniors made a well
executed shot for the first goal.
Seniors' Offense Strong
The '27 offense started functioning
in the second chukker, holding the
juniors scoreless. The third-year men
showed an equally good defensive
game by not permitting their oppo
nents to score.
Connolly, junior number four man,
opened the third period scoring by
making a shot from mid-field. This
signaled for the seniors to start their
scoring machine as Evans made their
first goal, llothrock, varsity player,
tied the score with an angle shot and
repeated soon again for the third
point which was made in a bunched
play on the junior goal line.
Juniors Tie Score
Weymouth brought the junior score
up to the seniors when he followed
Brown who missed three consecutive
shots. From then on until the last
minute the playing was done in the
middle of the field, neither side being
able to get away with the ball. Just as
the gong sounded, Brown made up for
his previous error and played a follow
up ball which was successful in get
ting through the players massed on
the junior goal line.
The line-up was as follows:
Seniors (4) — Juniors (3) —
Rothrock 1 Austin
Evans 2 Weymouth
Brown 3 Thompson
Trotter 4 Connolly
