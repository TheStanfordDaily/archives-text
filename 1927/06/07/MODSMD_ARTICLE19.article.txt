### 
Polls open at S:3O o'clock this morn
ing for the final vote on the five
A.S.S.U. and two class offices which
were left undecided after last week's
balloting. Men will vote at the Law
Steps, and women will ballot in front
of the classical literature department.
Both polls will close at 2 o'clock, while
in addition, the women's polls will
close from 12 o'clock to 1. During that
time the women may vote at the men's
polls.
Two Classes to Vote
Besides the regular A.S.S.U. ballots,
there will also be ballots for the
classes of 1028 and 1929. The class of
192S will vote between Claude C. Conn
and Bob King for president, while
the class of 1929 will vote on Carol
Gray and Jane Plumb for vice-presi
dent.
Since the Stanford Daily concludes
its publication for this year with this
issue, the results of the election will
be printed on special bulletins and
posted and distributed around the
campus. They probably will not be
off the press until late this afternoon,
and possibly not until after G o'clock.
