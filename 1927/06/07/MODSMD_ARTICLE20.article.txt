# POLO ASSOCIATION TO GATHER AT BANQUET FOR FINAL MEETING
## 
### 
To climax the current polo season,
the Stanford Polo Association will
banquet at 7:30 o'clock tonight at the
Sigma Nu fraternity house.
The final report of money taken in
by the polo organization picture, "Men
of Purpose." filmed here the past
month, shows that enough returns
were secured to pay the expenses of
the Cardinal team to the Pacific Coast
tournament but not enough to send
the squad East this summer
