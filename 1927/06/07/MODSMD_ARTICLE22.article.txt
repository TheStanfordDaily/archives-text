The Stanford Daily ceases publication for the quarter today. As
the presses are preparing for the last run, we have an opportunity to look
back over the year and see the material things that have been accom
plished. Jt has been the journalists' endeavor to keep the newspaper up
to the standards of the other activities at Stanford.
During the last nine months we have seen the University make great
strides along scholastic lines, with the adoption of the junior college plan
as a fitting climax of the college year. We have seen constant endeavors
on the part of the officials of the institution to make Stanford advance
with the leading colleges of the country, and the result has been that the
University has stepped out in the lead in many respects. New and inspir
ing instructors are added to the faculty in an endeavor to further higher
learning of the personal type.
The year 1926-27 has seen Stanford supreme in athletics on the coast.
National titles in football and track have also been achieved by Warner
and Templeton and their teams. Debating and dramatics have also ad
vanced during the past three quarters. There appear to be 110 retrogres
sive movements at Stanford.
With such a fast pace set by the other activities, The Stanford
Daily steps into the race. The first move taken by the journalists was
to change the name of the paper from the Daily Palo Alto to The Stan
ford Daily, a name with which the paper should have been christened
at birth. The time of publication was changed from afternoon to the
morning. This move was made to give the students the very latest news
of the University. The size of the paper was changed from six columns
to seven columns so that the readers would be provided with more and
larger accounts of their activities. This last change should have been
made long ago.
The paper has entered into a number of controversies during the
college year, and the result, we believe, has been to increase the students'
interest in their daily paper. The evils of the Y.M.C.A. were attacked, but
the "Y" itself was not criticized. W r e can make an "about-face" and sup
port the Association next year, if they have so rearranged their method
as to be above reproach.
The Board of Athletic Control has suffered criticism a number of
times for the way they did this and the way they did that. The Board
has not taken the comments in quite the fine spirit that the "Y" has, for
they feel the Board itself is being attacked, while in reality it is merely
the few failings of the organization that are being criticized. They jus
tify the erection of a $100,000 building by the fact that the rules of the
organization state that all money must be spent for athletic equipment.
We claim that the rules should be changed if that is the case. Even with
the rules as they are now, will anyone deny that the men's gymnasium
is a palace in comparison with the women's athletic building? Whether
the Board has $100,000 to spend 011 anything right now is also rather
doubtful. We approve of increasing the size of the stadium because the
expense of this addition will be paid for from the increased gate receipts,
and it will provide alumni additional space at Big Games.
The whole state was aroused by the editorial advising that University
of Southern California be expelled from the conference because of the
deliberate foul running of several of the Trojans in the dual meet with
Stanford. The Daily's stand was severely criticized by many, and it
was approved by others. In all of the discussions that took place over the
Trojan affair, every writer admitted the facts that U.S.C. had played
the game poorly, and where the disagreement came in was in the punish
ment to be administered to the college. Many felt that expulsion from
the conference was too severe, but we stood our ground, believing that
nothing could completely punish an institution that practiced unsports
manlike conduct in athletic contests.
The last bit of editorial campaigning was in the direction of correct
ing the present lock-out rules of the women of the University. Again it
was a sincere belief on the part of the editorial board that something
should be done to better the conditions of the women, that incited this
series of articles. The interest taken by the campus was evident by the
number of letters that were written to the paper by students et al. If
some reforms follow, the Daily feels that it has accomplished something
besides merely entertaining the University.
The Daily has at all times attempted to give the students the news
of their particular interests. It is not for the Daily to judge whether
it has been successful along these lines.

they feel the Board itself is being attacked, while in reality it is merely
the few failings of the organization that are being criticized. They jus
tify the erection of a $100,000 building by the fact that the rules of the
organization state that all money must be spent for athletic equipment.
We claim that the rules should be changed if that is the case. Even with
the rules as they are now, will anyone deny that the men's gymnasium
is a palace in comparison with the women's athletic building? Whether
the Board has $100,000 to spend 011 anything right now is also rather
doubtful. We approve of increasing the size of the stadium because the
expense of this addition will be paid for from the increased gate receipts,
and it will provide alumni additional space at Big Games.
The whole state was aroused by the editorial advising that University
of Southern California be expelled from the conference because of the
deliberate foul running of several of the Trojans in the dual meet with
Stanford. The Daily's stand was severely criticized by many, and it
was approved by others. In all of the discussions that took place over the
Trojan affair, every writer admitted the facts that U.S.C. had played
the game poorly, and where the disagreement came in was in the punish
ment to be administered to the college. Many felt that expulsion from
the conference was too severe, but we stood our ground, believing that
nothing could completely punish an institution that practiced unsports
manlike conduct in athletic contests.
The last bit of editorial campaigning was in the direction of correct
ing the present lock-out rules of the women of the University. Again it
was a sincere belief on the part of the editorial board that something
should be done to better the conditions of the women, that incited this
series of articles. The interest taken by the campus was evident by the
number of letters that were written to the paper by students et al. If
some reforms follow, the Daily feels that it has accomplished something
besides merely entertaining the University.
The Daily has at all times attempted to give the students the news
of their particular interests. It is not for the Daily to judge whether
it has been successful along these lines.
The Stanford Daily ceases publication for the quarter today. As
the presses are preparing for the last run, we have an opportunity to look
back over the year and see the material things that have been accom
plished. Jt has been the journalists' endeavor to keep the newspaper up
to the standards of the other activities at Stanford.
During the last nine months we have seen the University make great
strides along scholastic lines, with the adoption of the junior college plan
as a fitting climax of the college year. We have seen constant endeavors
on the part of the officials of the institution to make Stanford advance
with the leading colleges of the country, and the result has been that the
University has stepped out in the lead in many respects. New and inspir
ing instructors are added to the faculty in an endeavor to further higher
learning of the personal type.
The year 1926-27 has seen Stanford supreme in athletics on the coast.
National titles in football and track have also been achieved by Warner
and Templeton and their teams. Debating and dramatics have also ad
vanced during the past three quarters. There appear to be 110 retrogres
sive movements at Stanford.
With such a fast pace set by the other activities, The Stanford
Daily steps into the race. The first move taken by the journalists was
to change the name of the paper from the Daily Palo Alto to The Stan

at birth. The time of publication was changed from afternoon to the
morning. This move was made to give the students the very latest news
of the University. The size of the paper was changed from six columns
to seven columns so that the readers would be provided with more and
larger accounts of their activities. This last change should have been
made long ago.
The paper has entered into a number of controversies during the
college year, and the result, we believe, has been to increase the students'
interest in their daily paper. The evils of the Y.M.C.A. were attacked, but
the "Y" itself was not criticized. W r e can make an "about-face" and sup
port the Association next year, if they have so rearranged their method
as to be above reproach.
