The most pronounced change that will be made in the Daily at the
start of the fall quarter is the change in size of the paper. This year has
proved that the campus doings and events cannot be adequately handled
in seven columns, so the Daily will be increased to eight columns in
October, 1927.
A folding machine will be added to the Daily plant during the sum
mer. This new piece of machinery will enable the business department
to be justified in running six- and eight-page papers often during the
coming years. All these advances show that the college paper is trying
its hardest to keep up with the advancing Stanford.
