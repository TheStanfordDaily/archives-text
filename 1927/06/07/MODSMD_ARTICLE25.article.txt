AVE ATQUE VALE! !
Here the end of the year has arrived, !
as everyone expected all along. And '
it finds us writing the Bull Session ,
for the last time before we entrust it j
to the gentle care of another author. !
Under these conditions, convention
makes it almost obligatory to make a
profound editorial bow.
There is something about the final
editorial article that is remindful of
the gesture of a small boy, who, after j
having been engaged in a heated alter- j
cation with an associate, thumbs his ;
nose at this adversary and immediate
ly slams the door behind him to pre
clude any possibility of a reciproca
tion. It is the one opportunity for a j
.columnist to got the last word.
Like all collegiate journalists we '
have felt for some years that when I
this moment came we would vent upon !
an unprotected campus all the spleen
that had been withheld on various oc-'
casions in the past out of motives of ,
propriety or discretion. And, like all
our predecessors, we have found that j
the moment brings with it a sort of j
choking feeling, leaving us, after a j
manner speaking, unmanned and
incapable of performing the task we j
had set for ourselves in the fine and !
i
heartless manner in which we had j
expected to perform it.
However, we cannot in a moment of
weakness set aside a resolution of
several years' standing and shall
plunge ahead just the same to tell the j
campus what we think of it and then, i
like an umpire making a decision j
while on the dead run for the club- ;
house, w T e shall leave the campus to
tell the marines what it thinks of us.

The end of the year finds Stanford ,
at a critical point in its history. The [
administration is on the verge of tak-;
ing a momentous step in eliminating I
the lower division, a step that may
make the University in certain re
spects and may prove its undoing in
others.
Just now Stanford leads the field in
athletics. The success of the several
varsities during the past year has
spread the name of the University
from coast to coast. This success is
not accidental, but is the result of
years of painstaking effort on the part
of alumni, students, and coaches.
Whether or not the results of this
work are to be sacrificed at a single
move is an important question. To our
mind it would be a grave error to alter
the character of this University to the
point of making it a graduate school
with a curriculum of so intensive a
nature as to work any great damage ;
to athletics.
♦ ♦ *
Too, the end of the year finds the
women, after a fine outburst of hot
air, speaking timorously of the in
advisability at this time of allowing
themselves a degree of freedom gen-
I erally accorded to grammar school
! children. Their action has convinced |
us that Dean Yost is correct in im- :
plying that there are a number of
women here who need a protective in
fluence. We have altered our opinion
to the point of believing that the Dean
erred only in placing too conservative
an estimate on the number and age
of the women who do need that in
fluence.
In place of producing any construc
tive action, the turmoil over lockout
rules has fizzled off with a repetition
of three or four of those bromidical
remarks that have attained such a i
traditional importance at Stanford i
that the more mention of them is |
enough to end a discussion of any
kind.
Most annoying among those banal
epigrams is the one which implies
that any woman who feels a desire to j
express her personal liberty should i
do so, not by active objection to the
local restrictions, but by going some
where else where they do not exist.
The sentiment may be summed up
by lines from a poem, written by a
woman whose name, at this moment,
escapes us:
"If "you don't like the things I do,
To hell, my love, with you."
* * *
And speaking of this bromide re
minds us of the host of others. In the
future let yus offer a fervent prayer j
that official thought will be expressed |
in some form other than these brief I
remarks that sound so much like prov- ;
erbs from the Polish. Specific exam- j
pies of the objectionable items are:
"The Honor System is an institu- !
tion in this University, its existence t
and enforcement rest with every loyal !
student."
"Gasolino and alcohol do not mix." ,
" conduct unbecoming a Stan-1

ford man."

To extend the list indefinitely would
be quite possible—and quite pointless.
* * *
Here we are, after having mentioned
but two or three items, running wild
all over the page. And certainly there
is no good reason for going on fur
ther with these sage remarks; for they
will all be quite forgotten in the dis
tractions of approaching finals and
vacation.
There remains but to knock out the
customary "30," and to hope that some
few people have enjoyed reading this
column as much as we have enjoyed
writing it. But for all of that*, we are
glad to see the last one going to
press; for summer is upon us and we
are quite tired of it all.

There is something about the final
editorial article that is remindful of

having been engaged in a heated alter- j
cation with an associate, thumbs his ;
nose at this adversary and immediate

clude any possibility of a reciproca
tion. It is the one opportunity for a j

Like all collegiate journalists we '
have felt for some years that when I
this moment came we would vent upon !
an unprotected campus all the spleen
that had been withheld on various oc-'
casions in the past out of motives of ,
propriety or discretion. And, like all
our predecessors, we have found that j
the moment brings with it a sort of j
choking feeling, leaving us, after a j
manner speaking, unmanned and
incapable of performing the task we j
had set for ourselves in the fine and !
i
heartless manner in which we had j
expected to perform it.
However, we cannot in a moment of
weakness set aside a resolution of
several years' standing and shall
plunge ahead just the same to tell the j
campus what we think of it and then, i
like an umpire making a decision j

The end of the year finds Stanford ,
at a critical point in its history. The [
administration is on the verge of tak-;
ing a momentous step in eliminating I
the lower division, a step that may
make the University in certain re
spects and may prove its undoing in
others.
Just now Stanford leads the field in
athletics. The success of the several
varsities during the past year has
spread the name of the University
from coast to coast. This success is
not accidental, but is the result of
years of painstaking effort on the part
of alumni, students, and coaches.
Whether or not the results of this
work are to be sacrificed at a single
move is an important question. To our
mind it would be a grave error to alter
the character of this University to the
point of making it a graduate school
with a curriculum of so intensive a
nature as to work any great damage ;
to athletics.
♦ ♦ *
Too, the end of the year finds the
women, after a fine outburst of hot
air, speaking timorously of the in
advisability at this time of allowing
themselves a degree of freedom gen-
I erally accorded to grammar school
! children. Their action has convinced |
us that Dean Yost is correct in im- :
plying that there are a number of
women here who need a protective in
fluence. We have altered our opinion
to the point of believing that the Dean
erred only in placing too conservative
an estimate on the number and age
of the women who do need that in
fluence.
In place of producing any construc
tive action, the turmoil over lockout
rules has fizzled off with a repetition
of three or four of those bromidical
remarks that have attained such a i
traditional importance at Stanford i
that the more mention of them is |
enough to end a discussion of any
kind.
Most annoying among those banal
epigrams is the one which implies
that any woman who feels a desire to j
express her personal liberty should i
do so, not by active objection to the
local restrictions, but by going some
where else where they do not exist.
The sentiment may be summed up
by lines from a poem, written by a
woman whose name, at this moment,
escapes us:
"If "you don't like the things I do,
To hell, my love, with you."
* * *
And speaking of this bromide re
minds us of the host of others. In the
future let yus offer a fervent prayer j
that official thought will be expressed |
in some form other than these brief I
remarks that sound so much like prov- ;
erbs from the Polish. Specific exam- j
pies of the objectionable items are:
"The Honor System is an institu- !
tion in this University, its existence t
and enforcement rest with every loyal !
student."
"Gasolino and alcohol do not mix." ,
" conduct unbecoming a Stan-1

ford man."

To extend the list indefinitely would
be quite possible—and quite pointless.
* * *
Here we are, after having mentioned
but two or three items, running wild
all over the page. And certainly there
is no good reason for going on fur
ther with these sage remarks; for they
will all be quite forgotten in the dis
tractions of approaching finals and
vacation.
There remains but to knock out the
customary "30," and to hope that some
few people have enjoyed reading this
column as much as we have enjoyed
writing it. But for all of that*, we are
glad to see the last one going to
press; for summer is upon us and we
are quite tired of it all.

Like all collegiate journalists we '
have felt for some years that when I
this moment came we would vent upon !
an unprotected campus all the spleen
that had been withheld on various oc-'
casions in the past out of motives of ,
propriety or discretion. And, like all
our predecessors, we have found that j
the moment brings with it a sort of j
choking feeling, leaving us, after a j
manner speaking, unmanned and
incapable of performing the task we j
had set for ourselves in the fine and !
i
heartless manner in which we had j
expected to perform it.
However, we cannot in a moment of
weakness set aside a resolution of
several years' standing and shall
plunge ahead just the same to tell the j
campus what we think of it and then, i
like an umpire making a decision j
while on the dead run for the club- ;
house, w T e shall leave the campus to
tell the marines what it thinks of us.

The end of the year finds Stanford ,
at a critical point in its history. The [
administration is on the verge of tak-;
ing a momentous step in eliminating I
the lower division, a step that may
make the University in certain re
spects and may prove its undoing in
others.
Just now Stanford leads the field in
athletics. The success of the several
varsities during the past year has
spread the name of the University
from coast to coast. This success is
not accidental, but is the result of
years of painstaking effort on the part
of alumni, students, and coaches.
Whether or not the results of this
work are to be sacrificed at a single
move is an important question. To our
mind it would be a grave error to alter
the character of this University to the
point of making it a graduate school
with a curriculum of so intensive a
nature as to work any great damage ;
to athletics.
♦ ♦ *
Too, the end of the year finds the
women, after a fine outburst of hot
air, speaking timorously of the in
advisability at this time of allowing
themselves a degree of freedom gen-
I erally accorded to grammar school
! children. Their action has convinced |
us that Dean Yost is correct in im- :
plying that there are a number of
women here who need a protective in
fluence. We have altered our opinion
to the point of believing that the Dean
erred only in placing too conservative
an estimate on the number and age
of the women who do need that in
fluence.
In place of producing any construc
tive action, the turmoil over lockout
rules has fizzled off with a repetition
of three or four of those bromidical
remarks that have attained such a i
traditional importance at Stanford i
that the more mention of them is |
enough to end a discussion of any
kind.
Most annoying among those banal
epigrams is the one which implies
that any woman who feels a desire to j
express her personal liberty should i
do so, not by active objection to the
local restrictions, but by going some
where else where they do not exist.
The sentiment may be summed up
by lines from a poem, written by a
woman whose name, at this moment,
escapes us:
"If "you don't like the things I do,
To hell, my love, with you."
* * *
And speaking of this bromide re
minds us of the host of others. In the
future let yus offer a fervent prayer j
that official thought will be expressed |
in some form other than these brief I
remarks that sound so much like prov- ;
erbs from the Polish. Specific exam- j
pies of the objectionable items are:
"The Honor System is an institu- !
tion in this University, its existence t
and enforcement rest with every loyal !
student."
"Gasolino and alcohol do not mix." ,
" conduct unbecoming a Stan-1

ford man."

To extend the list indefinitely would
be quite possible—and quite pointless.
* * *
Here we are, after having mentioned
but two or three items, running wild
all over the page. And certainly there
is no good reason for going on fur
ther with these sage remarks; for they
will all be quite forgotten in the dis
tractions of approaching finals and
vacation.
There remains but to knock out the
customary "30," and to hope that some
few people have enjoyed reading this
column as much as we have enjoyed
writing it. But for all of that*, we are
glad to see the last one going to
press; for summer is upon us and we
are quite tired of it all.

Here the end of the year has arrived, !
as everyone expected all along. And '
it finds us writing the Bull Session ,
for the last time before we entrust it j
to the gentle care of another author. !
Under these conditions, convention
makes it almost obligatory to make a
profound editorial bow.
There is something about the final
editorial article that is remindful of
the gesture of a small boy, who, after j
having been engaged in a heated alter- j
cation with an associate, thumbs his ;
nose at this adversary and immediate
ly slams the door behind him to pre
