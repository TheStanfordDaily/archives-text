# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Representing the Palo Alto Hospital
Branch of the Stanford Daily, I wish to
heartily commend and endorse the edi
torial printed in June 3 paper. To us
sufferers swollen perhaps beyond
recognition or tormented by a million
minute fiery demons, the solace of a
visit by a member of the opposite sex
—who is willing to pay such a visit —
would mean much. Though eyes may
be shut, ears can still appreciate the
sound of a familiar voice. And the
University is wrong if it thinks that
the congestion would be very greatly
increased by permitting such visits.
However, to make this a typical,
orthodox viewpoint, it must have at
least an element of complaint. So why,
Mr. Editor, call us "hypothetical" suf
ferers from poison oak? We can as
sure you—and produce medical testi
mony that neither we nor our afflic
tions are hypothetical—though the re
sult may be unesthetical.
Yours for a 100,000 campaign to
exterminate poison oak on University
property. —H.A.K.

The Bull Session, Sir:
Would you explain in your column,
or anywhere else, just what is the
status of our dear old Kampus Kop
(the egg who plays hide-and-go-seek
with you) ? He is a state officer, I
understand, but according to law, state
officers may not use speed traps, nor
may they hide, as our friend here does.
Furthermore, he uses the blue Buick,
even though the law says that such a
practice is not to be continued. Jt
would seem from this that our friend
is operating contrary to the laws which
he strives so vigorously to uphold. I
have made some inquiries about this
with no satisfactory result; so I am
asking you, Mr. Bull Session who has
such an unfailing store of knowledge

and wisdom, to put me and the rest I
of the motoring public right on this j
question.—V.S. One of the 30's.
