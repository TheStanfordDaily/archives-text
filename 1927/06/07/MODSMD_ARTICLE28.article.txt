# PLAY PRESENTATION CLASS STAGES THREE ONE-ACT PRODUCTIONS
## "The Dickey Bird," Rated As Best of Friday's Performances 
### Jack Rogers 
■Always it is difficult for amateur 1
actors to stage convincingly plays in
which settings and costumes are mere- '
ly suggested and no make-up is used, j
but the members of Gordon Davis' ;
play presentation class, in spite of this ;
unfair disadvantage, successfully pro-1
duced three one-act plays in the Little !
Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Lines Forgotten
The first two plays were slightly
marred by forgotten lines, a fault that
was not apparent in the performances j
last Friday, but the last number on i
the program was a fitting ending for
the public work of the class.
"Prairie Doll," a Western comedy by
Edward Childs Carpenter, was the first
play of the afternoon, and though the
humor of the lines was often forced
and weak, the scene between Julia;
North, as the wilful girl, and John
Atwill, the man who conquers her,
saved the play from being a failure.
Acting Natural
The second play, "Finders-Keepers,"
by George Kelly, is a satirical comedy
that is done time and again in Little
Theatres, yet the natural acting of
Mvrile de Vaux and Edward Conner,
as the husband and wife, kept the
drama at an interesting pitch.
"The Dickey Bird" Scores
But the hit of the afternoon was
"The Dickey Bird," by Harvey O'Hig
gins. The comedy itself is delightfully
amusing, and was further enhanced by
the splendid acting of Myrtle de Vaux,
as the new r wife, and Julia North, as
the maid, Barbara Frick as the di
vorced wife, and Powell Carpenter
playing the maligned husband — the
"dickey bird" —were good, but the
other two were so much better that
they were far above the other indi-1
vidual performances of the afternoon, j
Because of the illness of Elizabeth i
Clark, "The Same Old Thing," in :
which she had a part, was not pro- i
duced.
