composition, which is extending to 250 !
Century," written by an Americanized j
Russian count and brought to Dr. Gray j
pages an original play, "Twentieth j

The author, writing under the name !
of John Pierpont Morgan, sent the play
in its original draft of 175 pages to
Dr. Gray with the request that it be
given to some group of students for
extension to the necessary length for
publication. The class will be paid
fifty dollars, to be divided among them,
for this service, and the play in its |
revised form will be published in the
latter part of the year.
