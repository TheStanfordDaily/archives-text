# ABOLITION OF SPRING FOOTBALL WORKOUTS STILL OPEN QUESTION
## 
### 
Whether spring football training should
be abolished or not still remains an open
question as the meeting of graduate man
agers of Pacific Coast Conference schools
failed to take any final action on the
question.
A1 Masters, Stanford graduate man
ager, who has just returned from the two
day conference at Los Angeles, said that
no definite action was taken on the report
of the committee of which lie was chair
man. It is possible that the matter may
be taken up at the next meeting of the
managers.
