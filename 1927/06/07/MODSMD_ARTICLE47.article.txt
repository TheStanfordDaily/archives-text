# INDICTMENT AGAINST COLLEGE REGISTERED BY SENIOR'S MOTHER
## 
### 
"Snob, loafer, and waster" are words
used in an indictment against the typical
college graduate, appearing in the June
Woman's Home Companion, written by
the mother of a senior in one of the larg
est and oldest Eastern universities.
The writer says: "College has turned
my son from a good democrat into a bit
of a snob. His present mental attitude is
anything but decently democratic. And
aside from the moral cheapness of snob
bery, I feel that it is a thing which he
must outgrow if he seeks business suc
cess.
"College has taught him absurd ideas
about women. He is without the faintest
conception of sex equality. He believes in
the double standard not only of morality,
but of propriety. He has notions which
have been imposed on him by four years
of living in a man-made college world,
a world of, by, and for men.
"He has a rigid and extravagant stand
ard of dress. He thinks he must continue
to clothe himself in the style to which
college has made him accustomed.
Extravagance Taught
"College has taught my son extravagant
and wasteful ideas of hospitality. When
he takes his first job, he must learn that
he can't relieve boredom by spending from
$30 to $50 on one girl for one party.
"He has an equally inflated notion of
his present economic value. He is a dawd
ler and shrinks from 'hustle.' I cannot
imagine his plunging into a job and work
ing his head off to make good, yet that
is the average employer's acid test for an
ambitious young man. He has a confirmed
habit of academic leisure.
"College has given him many fine
things, I am sure. But it seems a pity
that it has also given him these handi
caps."
