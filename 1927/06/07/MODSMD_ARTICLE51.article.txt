# ESSAY COMPETITION OPEN TO STUDENTS . OF GERMAN AFFAIRS
## 
### 
"The entrance of Germany into the
League of Nations on September 10, 1926,
is generally regarded as perhaps the most
significant event of post-war history,"
says Professor William A. Cooper, of
the German Department, in explaining an
essay-writing project for American stu
dents of German affairs.
Prominent citizens of the United States,
wishing to encourage interest on the part
of young men and women, have offered
prizes for the best essays or articles on
the subject of "The Significance of Ger
many's Entrance into the League of Na
tions."
As a member of the supervising com
mittee in charge of the contest, which
closes June 30, Professor Cooper stresses
its importance. He says of the subject
matter: "Germany's entrance marks po
tentially the passing of an era in Franco-
German relations during which wars and
the preparation for wars were well-nigh
constant. It is the beginning of a new
period in which the co-operation of
France and Germany in maintaining
peace in Europe may be an example to
the world. It will have far-reaching con
sequences in the policies of both nations
and of all nations, above all Russia and
Great Britain. Possibly the United States
will be influenced by it to a noticeable
degree."
Six prizes will be awarded college stu
dents entering the contest, the first being
$100. In scoring the papers the judges
will give due consideration to the definite
ness with which the writer sets forth his
thesis and the success with which he sup
ports it. Stanford students who are inter
ested may get detailed information from
Professor Cooper.
