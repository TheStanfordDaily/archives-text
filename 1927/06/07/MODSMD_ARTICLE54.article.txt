## 
### 
Fifty thousand dollars, half to a man
and half to a woman, is offered by the
\Y oodrow Wilson Foundation for the ar
ticles that most intelligently carry out the
title chosen for both awards: "What
Woodrow Wilson Means to Me."
The only qualifications of the contest
are that the contestants must be Ameri
cans between the ages of twenty and
thirty-five, that the essays must be type
written and must not exceed 25(H) words,
and that the articles must be received at
the office of the Foundation, in New York
City, on or before October 1 of this year.
An article may be presented by an indi
vidual or jointly by a group or organi
zation, provided that the age limit of
members is specifically observed. The es
says for the contest must seek to appraise
the ideals, standards, and principles of
Woodrow Wilson according to the per-
S' ial standpoint of the writer.
The announcement also says: "Since
the purpose is solely to induce young
people to study and understand the ideals
and principles of Wilson, it should be
perfectly obvious to contestants that these
awards neither call for articles of ful
some praise nor analytical criticism.
"As tlie articles submitted are to be lim
ited to writers of the years indicated, they
will be judged not for their literary style
but rather for the ideas contained."
