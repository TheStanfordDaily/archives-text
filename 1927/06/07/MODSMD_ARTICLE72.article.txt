# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Friends of Aaron Ward will welcome
him back to New York in his first ap
pearance at the Yankee Stadium as a
member of the Chicago White Sox.
The capable second-sacker has a host
of admirers in Gotham, who are quite
pleased to see him getting daily ac
tion once more, even if it is with a
team that might eventually beat out
the Yankees for the pennant.
"Wardie" is not yet thirty years old,
but knows what it is to bow to youth,
for he played in only twenty-two
games for Miller Huggins last year,
being used as a utility infielder while
the brilliant second-base combination
of Lazzeri and Koenig was being tried
out so successfully. It is probably a
great satisfaction to him to be getting
daily employment, and it would doubt
less give him quite a "kick" should
his own efforts be responsible for the
defeat of the Yankees in the four-game
series that starts today.
For Aaron Ward did a lot toward
bringing the 1923 world's champion
ship to the New York American
League club. He batted .417 in that
series with the Giants, he and his
rival second baseman, Frankie Frisch,
making the most hits of any players
on either team, and he and Casey
Stengel tying for the highest average.
Now all three, of those "heroes" have
been traded to other clubs by Hug
gins and McGraw ,and they probably
still ponder now and then on the
fact that there is no sentiment in
baseball.
But Ward had to go, as it was evi
dent that the Yankees must be re
built after the disastrous 1925 season.
Aaron's batting went steadily down
from a .306 in 1921 to ..Â°4G in 1925, so

Huggins benched him and finally trad
ed liira to Chicago for Grabowski and
Morehart.
I always liked Ward's play and his
| behavior on the field, and shall view
his work in this series with great
I interest. Few thought that the White
Sox, with Mostil and Collins out, would
be a pennant contender, but it seems
tliat the combination of new blood in
j Center Fielder Metzler and Second
Baseman Ward, and Ray Schalk's fine
! management, has fooled a lot of the
J "experts."
