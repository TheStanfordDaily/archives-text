Students wishing their spring quar
ter's grades before next registration
day should leave a stamped, self-ad
dressed envelope at the Registrar's
window before the quarter closes. To
save trouble, stamped envelopes may
be obtained at the window at 5 cents
each, the profits to go to the Conva
lescent Home.

penses were deducted. This is ap
proximately the same amount as the
previous quarter, which is consider
ably more than ever before. The Regis
trar's office makes no charge for its
service in mailing out the grades.
