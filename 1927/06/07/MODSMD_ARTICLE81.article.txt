# GRASS FIRE GIVES FIRE DEPARTMENT TIMELY WORKOUT
## 
### 
Very conveniently for the final
issue of the Stanford Daily,
which would rather not go to
press without a conflagration to
climax the year's news, the Uni
versity lire department consist
ing of one Ford and two students
made a thrilling run yesterday
afternoon in answer to a three
alarm grass fire 011 the Portola
road.
With the assistance of one
five-gallon can of water and sev
eral yards of burlap, in the hands
of members of interested by
standers who had been pressed
into honorary positions on the
department, the flames were soon
controlled.
