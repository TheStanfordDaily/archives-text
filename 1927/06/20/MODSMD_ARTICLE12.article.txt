# PRESIDENT RAY LYMAN WILBUR ADDRESSES GRADUATING CLASS ON "PACIFIC NEIGHBORS"
## Californians Are Beginning To Discover Pacific States President TURNING FACES WEST Wilbur Calls Upon Youth Of America for Vision Of the World 
### 
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work
