# PRESIDENT RAY LYMAN WILBUR ADDRESSES GRADUATING CLASS ON "PACIFIC NEIGHBORS"
## Californians Are Beginning To Discover Pacific States President TURNING FACES WEST Wilbur Calls Upon Youth Of America for Vision Of the World 
### 
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.

the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

It is better to build bricks into a firm

throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.

you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you

our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.

yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends

public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.

than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way bacl%into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.

It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this has been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.

In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.

In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the "you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours" type. Many of our most suc
cessful politicians owe their advance
to the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia in all fields is past If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Above all, do not satisfy your desire
for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest about this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.

Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can I get.
Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world lias become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation lias been established. The
major processes of ordinary affairs
have been speeded up. There has been
a marked increase in the number of
exposures of one country to another,
both as to ideas, goods, and people.
As we name over the countries bor
dering the Pacific we see grouped
about this arena the majority of the
great nations and peoples of the
world. History is full of the failures
in the relationships of the peoples
about the Atlantic. We wonder
whether there are any new methods
possible in the Pacific so that we can
develop mutual understandings in
stead of the chronic misunderstand
ings which have been so characteris
tic in the past. It is well for us here
in the United States to realize that,
our country is viewed by many of the
other peoples of the Pacific as the
problem of the Pacific Ocean. They
wonder what we are going to do with
our great power, our wealth, and our
dominating position. Certainly with
half of the people of the world gath
ered about the Pacific and with the
widest differences in race, creed, tra
dition. and philosophy we must nar
row the fields of controversy and at
tack those narrowed fields in the most
scientific manner by the application of
facts and good spirit if we are to
avoid a world tragedy. We must ask
the research workers of all other
countries to look for facts. We must
seek out the people of good-will. We
must face the truth, disagreeable
though it may be. Unpalatable truths
are often good to clear the mind of
that native fog which is built up out
of prejudice and provincialism. We
must recognize that prejudice is the
refuge of small minds and that there
are many such in every community
and in every country. Some wars have
been brought about cold-bloodedly,
but most of them are due to what we
might call glandular thinking. They
result from emotional storms based
usually upon fear. War is the supreme
tragedy coming from failure to under
stand. This failure to understand
comes largely from lack of informa
tion and of appreciation of the other
man's or other nation's point of view.
In the Pacific at tlie present time
with the great distances day-to-day
news between countries is most often
of the scarehead variety. If we view
our present relations with the Orien
tal countries we can perhaps evaluate
the situation. Up to date most of our
associations have been through the
business man seeking profits, the diplo
mat seeking political advantage, the
missionary seeking converts, tlie tour
ist seeking experience, or the author
seeking copy. Through various ave
nues. particularly through the foreign
students, there has been a transfer of
certain political ideas from one coun
try to the otln r. Those ideas that have
vigor enough to cross national bor
ders usually have strong fermentative
capacities. New ideas becoming wide
spread in old countries are apt to act
as new wine* in old bottles. We know
too that there is a wide variation in
racial traits. Recent scientific work

indicates that there is a different
mtabolic index in different peoples so
that transferred ideas, customs, food
habits, hours of labor, etc., may or
may not be of service to a nation or a
people. We find that there is a con
stant pressure toward change. Some
times this is slow and sometimes fast.
There is a flow in the lives of people
due to the driving power of human
aspiration. There constantly wells up
from the bottom the growing power
of youth seeking new experience and
change.
In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. In them
all there is a common love of justice
and a desire for fair dealing. There is
a growing racial and national con
sciousness which demands recognition
in various ways. There is a desire for
a share in the good things of the
earth and the products of human in
telligence. The great question is, how
can the countries of the Pacific help
each other in working out not only the
problems of the ocean itself but those
of the individual countries bordering
upon it. Fundamentally the peoples of
all these countries face the same ques
tions of food, housing, order, the care

against its enemies and of property
against loss. The world's food supply
at the present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu
man reservoirs of disease. One man
gets daily bread by the turn of a
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance.
Goods cross national lines in quanti
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the
development of a desire for sympa
thetic cooperation?

Here is a fertile field for the man
or woman of education, who is willing
to probe deep, exercise patience, and
to be a chronic optimist. Just what
the future of the human family is to
be can only be a surmise. There is a
general feeling that mankind is pass
ing through a process of progressive
betterment. The present generation
feels that it has sen the most remark
able contributions to that betterment
as yet recorded in history. Yet we
have seen destruction to an unparal
leled degree in the period of the exer-

cise of man's greatest constructive
genius. The will to destroy seems to
flourish as well as the will to build.
The last one hundred years has seen
transfers of population to various
parts of the globe beyond the scope
of any of the great migrations of the
past. The modern steamship has exer
cised a dominating part in mixing up
the inhabitants of the world and in
making difficult problems for it. We
must definitely face all of the implica
tions of immigration, including race
mixture, if we are to meet the present
situation in the Pacific.

There is enough difference in the
standards of living in the various
countries to bring up innumerable
questions associated with the ex
change of goods. Through all of this
series of difficulties there is constant
ly an element of fear which finds ex
pression in the creation of all forms
of defense. In the present state of
human relations such defense mechan
isms are evidently required, but there
is a limit to the amount of human
energy that can wisely be stored up
in military facilities and equipment.
There is a limit tft the amount of time
which nations can exact from their

citizens as a possible preventive
against aggression. May we not hope
that we can by increasing mutual un
derstanding of nations decrease those
expensive weapons originating through
the fear of misunderstanding?

In order to find out whether there
could be introduced into international
relations that type of conference

which has been productive in the pre
vention of or settlement of ordinary
disputes, two years ago a group of
unofficial and volunteer representa
tives from various Pacific countries,
to the number of approximately 150,
met in Honolulu as the Institute of
Pacific Relations for a two weeks' dis
cussion of the knottiest problems of
the Pacific. When it was discovered
that the devotees of Confucianism,
Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity
could calmly discuss just what their
religion meant to them and what it
held out for others confidence was
gained for the discussion of immigra
tion laws fcnd their effects, extrater
ritoriality, race biology, modern indus
trialism, and labor conditions in for
eign factories in China. In spite of
the sharpest feelings of injustice and
patriotism on the part of many mem
bers and the widest possible diversity
in points of view the methods of a
scientific assembly were adopted and
were successful. Those who knew the
solution of a question or had a pre
pared and universal formula for the
settlement of all international diffi
culties found themselves out of place.
There was a general desire to learn
the facts available, to start a search
for more facts, to listen, and to respect
the stand of others. To see yourself

as others see you, to view your own
country through the questioning eyes
of foreign neighbors, is a chastening
and wholesome experience and one
that millions must undergo if we are
to deal successfully across the great
ocean. It is good insurance to make
the effort to bring about understand
ing. It is true that distances on the
Pacific, in spite of rapid transporta
tion, are still great enough so that
clashes are apt to lead only to broken
communications and economic disaster
rather than to the desolation of vio
lence. We in America, and especially
those of us here on the West Coast,
must use every resource to clarify in
ternational questions.

While they may seem somewhat re
mote, they are, as a matter of fact,
of the most intimate interest to all of
us. The economic structure upon
which our safety depends is so sensi
tive that it can be affected by events
in any part of the world. On this
coast our dependence upon our Pacific
neighbors and their dependence upon
us is increasing each year. We are
already suffering from the effects of
pettiness of action and from a too
selfish point of view. The satisfaction
of the other fellow is a necessary part
of a bargain of any sort if bargaining
is to continue. We cannot now see

our way out of some of our immigra
tion and racial difficulties but we cer
tainly should avoid seeing our way
into any further misunderstandings
that can in any way be avoided.

In such fields as those of science,
ease of association, and the ready
transfer of ideas across oceans is com
paratively simple in spite of differ
ences in race, creed, or
the use of the methods of science, by
a study of human behavior and ac
tions, by analyzing racial traits and
studying the results of race mixtures,
there is no good reason why we should
not obtain information which we can
apply in the field of international re
lations. We must try to keep within
as narrow scope as possible the num
ber of questions of a purely political
and selfish character for which there
is apt to be no adequate solution and
where some form of adjustment to
conditions is the best we can hope for.

Man is above the brute because he
thinks, aspires, and has spiritual
qualities. If we can use these qualities
together with the illumination of mod
ern science and can think in terms of
the stronger nations giving their help
to those weaker ones which are striving
upward, then we may have pleasant
incidents to record instead of painful
ones. Certainly future generations will
not be justified in forgiving us unless
we make a gallant attempt to solve
the difficulties of the Pacific rather
than to permit them to pass into that
discord which is the inevitable result
of indifference and indecision, selfish
ness, and the short viewpoint. We call
upon the youth of America for that
world vision without which we perish.
