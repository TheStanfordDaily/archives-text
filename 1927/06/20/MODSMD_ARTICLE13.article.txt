# REV. HOWARD MELISH DELIVERS SERMON TO GRADUATES SUNDAY
## "Deposits from the Unseen" Is Subject Chosen by Eastern Clergyman 
### 
"Deposits from the Unseen" from
the Transfiguration was the sermon
text of Rev. Howard Melisli, of Trinity
Church, Brooklyn, at the Baccalaure
ate Service Sunday morning. "There
appeared unto them Elijah with
Moses: and they were talking with
Jesus."
Rev. Melisli cited Moses as repre
sentative of national ideals and Elijah
as the moral ideals. He continued,
"This means, I take it, that the politi
cal truth we have meant by Moses
and the moral truth w r e have meant
by Elijah, are summed up and ex
pressed in the truth we mean by
Christ. This is in line with Christ's
own thought that he fulfilled Moses
and the prophets.
"There are deposits from the un
seen all about us as even there are
deposits under our feet—Moses, Amer
ica's faith in man; Elijah, humanity's
faith in goodness; Christ, the motive
power of spiritual religion. Young
