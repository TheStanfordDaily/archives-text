# REV. HOWARD MELISH DELIVERS SERMON TO GRADUATES SUNDAY
## "Deposits from the Unseen" Is Subject Chosen by Eastern Clergyman 
### 
"Deposits from the Unseen" from
the Transfiguration was the sermon
text of Rev. Howard Melisli, of Trinity
Church, Brooklyn, at the Baccalaure
ate Service Sunday morning. "There
appeared unto them Elijah with
Moses: and they were talking with
Jesus."
Rev. Melisli cited Moses as repre
sentative of national ideals and Elijah
as the moral ideals. He continued,
"This means, I take it, that the politi
cal truth we have meant by Moses
and the moral truth w r e have meant
by Elijah, are summed up and ex
pressed in the truth we mean by
Christ. This is in line with Christ's
own thought that he fulfilled Moses
and the prophets.
"There are deposits from the un
seen all about us as even there are
deposits under our feetâ€”Moses, Amer
ica's faith in man; Elijah, humanity's
faith in goodness; Christ, the motive
power of spiritual religion. Young
I men and women you may go out into
life ignoring these three: and your
life will be as impoverished as a world

without the deposits of coal or gaso
line. You may go out with a vision of
these three; and your life will be en
riched spiritually by them as the
world has been materially by coal and
gasoline. The other day a gallant
youth making use of the deposits from
the unseen, and taking his courage in
both hands, liew through sunshine and
sleet from New York to Paris. May
Colonel Lindbergh be a symbol of
youth everywhere! Then would Wil
son's prophecy come true. 'Methinks
I see in my mind a noble and puissant
nation rousing herself like a strong
man after sleep, and shaking her in
visible locks; methings 1 see her as
an eage renewing her mighty youth,
and kindling her umlazzled eyes at the
full midday beam.'
"In this solemn moment, which will
j never again come to you or to me i
i my deepest wish for you is that your
j college commencement will indeed by
a mound of transfiguration; and that
i it will be said of you as of those
| young men of old time, 'There ap
peared unto them Moses and Elijah:
and they were talking with Jesus'."
