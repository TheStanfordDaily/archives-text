# We Offer a Newspaper

### 
It was only after hours of debate that the Stanford Daily decided
to publish this—the Senior Edition. We were afraid that by printing
such a paper a precedent would be started that would be about as worth
less and as nonsensible as some of the other traditions that run wild
about this beautiful campus about graduation time.
Did you know, that someone (you eventually) contribute to put a
five-dollar goldpiece under the senior plate on the Inner Quadrangle ?
Did you ever stop to think how primitive a gesture it is to sign a class
roster, an dthen bury that along with the precious gold ? Everything else
that it written or done during Senior Week is copyrighted and buried
under the red, red sod in the Inner Quad. A copy of the Stanford
Daily, a bawl-out, and a new yearbook are deposited with the roster and
the five-dollars.
Maybe it is a fact that journalists have not the right spirit—the right
sentiments, but yet we rather appreciated a good speech at •commencement
time ; we rather enjoyed the Senior Ball and the Senior I arce; and for
that matter we enjoyed the alumni dinner Thursday night from orange
juice to Dr. Wilbur's address. We like to receive a sheepskin along with
a large proportion of good advice that goes with it, but somehow putting
gold dollars under cement sidewalks, and promenading around a fountain
just does not seem to appeal to us.
It is with the thought of putting out an actual newspaper, that we
undertook this endeavor. We do not want it to become a tradition unless
it can stand on its own feet. If the four pages of news of graduation
and of senior activities actually interests the students, we are satisfied.
If nothing else, it is a cheap, and yet complete program of the week.
Here we are graduating from one of the most intellectual institutions
in the world, and yet before we can be acclaimed a full-fledged alumnus
we must hesitate long enough to bury a coin, a roster, a class poem, a
class history, a Quad, and a copy of the daily newspaper under the side
walk. May they all rest in peace.
