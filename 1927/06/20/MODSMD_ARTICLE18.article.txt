# When I Graduate

Following is quoted from "What Shall I Do When I Graduate," an
article appearing in Good Housekeeping for June and written by Mar
jorie Greenbie. It is primarily for women students, and can be taken for
what it is worth. It is at least an interesting summary of a question that
is foremost in many young people's minds today:
"Probably there is no reform in collegiate life which would make
everybody so happy as the discovery of some painless and prphylactic
method of removing frou the average senior's mind the question, 'What
Shall I Do When I Graduate?'
"The opportunities for college graduates increases all the time, and
every year more and more employers wake up to the fact that not only
the academic training, but the college life itself, and the whole range
of extra-curricular activities, have real vocational value.
"There are three ways of using the college education vocationally.
In the first place, the college girl may go into work for which her collegfe
education specifically prepares her and which would not be accessable
to her without that education. In the second place, she may begin at
the bottom of some profession, business, or industry, and trust that the
value of her training will quickly show in chances to rise above those
less mature and well-trained—as, if the girl is worth anything at all—it
almost invariably does. In the third place, she may start a business of
her own, and take anj job, however humble it may seem, which will serve
as an apprenticeship, depending on her college connections for patronage,
advertising, and general standing when the time comes to launch her
enterprise.
"And if the salary the college girl at first draws, and the kind of work
she has to do, seen much below the visions which college has given her,
she must remember that a college education, rightly used, assures her
gratis much that other people spend a great deal of money and work
very hard in order to get. Her college education is not something which
ca nbe used up, as it were, in a year or two after college, and discarded
if it does not prove immediately valuable. It is an asset which will last
her all her life, and of which the value will show increasingly, as she
herself increasingly learns how to work and how to live."
