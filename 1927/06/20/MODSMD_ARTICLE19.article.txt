They call it Senior Week
And I'm just learning why,
For five for my diploma,
And more for cap and gown
And ten to rate the senior jig,
Have surely got me down.
The senior dues come on by twos,
And that's not all by half;
Add themes, no job, and what not —
lots of what not,
And I ask you, haven't you enough
To make a senior weak? —E.W.C

Quad Pictures
Stanford women shout
Photography
Has improved
Tn every way.
I think I hear ,
Five hundred
Stanford women shout
"The hell you say!"

''More halos for commission men for
1928"—that's our motto. Read Gus Oliva's
little essay on "Commission Houses" in
the Quad.

Extra ! Extra ! Dr. Gardner now con
ducts Marine Station. Note picture in
the Stanford Quad. Probably one of
those places for saving the souls of that
gallant organization which won the war.

To hell with the exes! Let's go see
Clara Bow in "Rough House Rosie."—

Cabbages Opinion Column
The Editor, Sir:
I don't think the picture "Good Parlor
Technique" on page 103 is very nice. The
young lady should NOT be seated on the
arm of the chair. She should be on his
lap.
Yours for technique,
A. MEREMAN
