George Bogue takes time off from his
executive duties to play a little football

Today, the Class of '27 has arrived
at the end of four happy years at
Stanford. Words would fail to express
what we would like to say of what
all these years have meant to us. We
realize that the four best years of our
lives have been spent 011 this wonder
ful campus and that on the Quad in its
associations we have received the
foundation to build upon in our future
lives, as we go out in the professional,
scientific, and economical work that
is before us.
The memories of happy days will
ever be before us, days spent along
the cool colonades, in and upon the
lake, fend upon the fields of battle,
either partaking in the crushing of a
foe or cheering lustily for our teams
to bring home the victory.
The Class of '27 can well be proud
of her life at Stanford. I point with
pride to the fact that she was the first
class in fourteen years to defeat the
California Cubs 011 the football field.
She followed this with a tie in the
Big Game of '24 and with two decisive
wins in the next two years. Thus
Stanford—as represented by the Class
of '27 —has never been defeated by a
California team.
As we now enter the ranks of the
alumni, we must not forget that we
are still vitally a part of Stanford and
all that is Stanford, and we must
carry on aiding, cheering, and fighting
for our dear Alma Mater. Today we
have received the highest honor Stan
ford can bestow upon us —our diplo
mas; and as we scatter to the four
corners of the globe, we must take
Stanford with us. And when after a
few years have passed, and the class
has its reunion, T hope to see a hun
dred per cent representation. This,
more than anything else, will prove
that we are Stanfordites through and
through and that we will ever pay
homage to the wonderful institution
that mothered us so well in our days
of greatest need and endowed us with
the qualifications to be better men
and women. —George Bogue.
