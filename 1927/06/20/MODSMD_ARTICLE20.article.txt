The Editor, Sir:
This new problem of "Women's
Rights" is arousing more oratory than
an old-fashioned Fourth of July. It
seems quite thrilling, and surely the
phrase, "a Stanford woman has the
judgment to look out for herself," is
most pleasing to the ear, and had in
spired a most brilliant campaign for
"Freedom." And what is this glorious
"Freedom," this "Right of Stanford
Women" we are demanding so ar
dently? The right to stay out an hour
later every evening, without telling
anybody! The right to walk home
from the lib in an hour and a half
after it closes instead of sprinting to
get there in 40 minutes, the right to
sit out in front for an hour longer wait

ing for time to go in, the right to get
up and jaunt to the P.O. at forty min
ute of midnight if you feel like it, in
stead of so soon after dinner! And
the Stanford men are nobly rallying to
our support. Of course the girls have
a right to stay out as late as they do!
Maybe it's different when it comes to
giving Woman's Debate Manager a
vote like the two men, for instance,
but certainly a girl has a right to stay
at a movie just as late as she feels like.
And aren't the Stanford women
jubilant now to be finding out at last
that "Exercising their judgment"
doesn't mean showing taste and good
common sense after all, but demand
ing all the license they can get away
with? Sincerely:
â€”The-four-hundred-and-ninety-ninth.
