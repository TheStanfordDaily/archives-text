"GIANTS IN THE EARTH."—By O. E.
Rolvaag. (Harper & Brothers.)
With his wife and children and his
two rickety wagons—day after day
Per Hansa, swash-buckling adventurer
and pioneer, set out bravely across
the prairie. They were lost!
Day after day the tiny caravan
pushed its way through the tall grass.
The track that it left behind was like
the wake of a boat—except that in
stead of widening out astern it closed
in again. "Tish-ah!" said the grass
. . . . "Tish-ah! Tish-ah!"
If something didn't turn up soon —if
they missed the other settlers who
had gone on ahead —
That is how "Giants in the Earth"
by O. E. Rolvaag begins, with the
terrible and heartbreaking struggle of
the first Norwegian pioneers to settle
in the great Northwest and to win

from the great forces of the wilderness
some means of sustenance.
All the romance —and the terror —
of pioneering are in this book. No one
who has once seen the prairie can fail
to recognize the essential primitive
truth of this saga; but those who have
helped to settle the West or who know
by some subtle instinct of their own
the insidious, insistent urge of strug
gle and adventure will realize its pe
culiar power. For it is the Norwegian
settler's saga of America, the real
story of the men who settled the
Northwest.
As such it stands alone, for there is
no other book which so vividly tells
this story. It is exciting as only a
struggle for existence itself can be,
simple, close to the soil and to the
homely realities of birth and death as
are all living things.
