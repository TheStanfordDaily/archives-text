# 1927 CLASS POEM

### 
Four swift years have fled and left us standing
At the portals of another world.
The future—far-flung horizons commanding
Glories that are like the dawn unfurled.
Stanford, now we go from hence we came,
Back to all four corners of the wind.
Seeking Fortune, Happiness, and Fame,
At last to leave our college days behind.
The years have passed, and yet they are not gone,
We hold them graven in our memories.
Hot summer mornings, sprawling on the lawn;
Evenings spent with talk and revelries;
The subtle, lambent magic of the moon-
Bathed Quad: a charmed place, bewitched and still;
The distant foothills, verdant, on a golden afternoon;
A pipe, a book, a friend on wind-swept hill.
And now is time to make our final bow;
To take farewell of each beloved scene.
Alma Mater, may the passing years endow
Us with thy spirit, sweet, serene.
—Stuart Felicien Leete, '27.
