# CLASS ORATION

### 
Fellow members of the Class of 1927.
We are assembled here, in our last
meeting as a corporate body, as an
integral part of Stanford University.
A sad thought that is to be sure. Of
course, we all recognize what a great
loss the University is about to suffer,
and it is equally true that in our
saner moments it becomes painfully
evident what a great loss we are about
to suffer ourselves. For, though we are
all anxious to shake the dust of rou
tine classroom work from our shoes
and step out into the world as it is,
a world in which some of us will be
great and some not so great, there
are many common bonds among our
selves, and between us and the Uni
versity, that will be broken forever,
Monday afternoon.

j At this corner, one of the many
| corners of life, we are wont to pause
; a moment, to reflect, and to contem
plate. We think of what lies behind
us and what lies before. At such a
moment it is only natural that we
should be a bit saddened by the fact
that what lies behind cannot be done
again. Water once over the falls will
j never go over again. We may recall
| mentally, and I think we have many
beautiful gifts from Stanford in the
way of recollections, memories. Memo
ries of things, of places, of incidents,
of people, and of friends. We will come
back from time to time, and the clois
ters and arcades of the Quad, our
I Quad, will be filled with memories.
! Golden memories, memories that I
| hope you and I may never lose, and
i memories that will be kept beautiful,
memories that will always prove an
j inspiration.
There are other things, more tan
j gible things, that four years of Stan
| ford has given us. Knowledge, in vary
| ing quantities, training, mental and
! physical, and in recognition for efforts
; expended they have given us the right
| to wear these robes, and a sheepskin
. will be ours Monday, they say.
All these things are valuable, some
of them more so than others, but are
they really what we came to Stanford
I for, four years ago? Are they the
things Ave wanted from Stanford. They
are not. We came seeking training in
ways to get into and to play the glori
ous game of life. And from our Univer
sity career, what then are the things
that we should carry out into life.
Well, there are a great number, but
j amongst all the rest there is one that
: seems to me particularly valuable. It
is the right and the ability to think
for ourselves. We go into a most pe
culiar world, a place where we will
doubtless get many knocks and bumps,
where a flunkout means a disaster,
even to the point of hunger possibly,
and where there are no kind-hearted
professors to weaken and give us an
other chance. It is, unfortunately, a
world where the honor system does
not exist, and where justice is a doubt
ful quantity, and where suffering,
bigotry, and inequality seem to be
only too popular. It is, if anything,
our part and our duty to take it all
smilingly, and do our share in better
ing it.
In the University we have learned
something of science, what science
has done for mankind, and something
of what it may do in the future. We
have learned that man has, with vary
ing degrees of success, for many cen
turies been struggling with his en
vironment, and that now nature is
practically our hand-servant.
Colonel Lindbergh can fly to Paris
overnight, and we can see the pictures
of his reception the next day as a re
sult of this battle of science with the
elements, a battle in which Stanford
has played no small part. We may talk
to our friends in London, over the tele
phone, if we have the price, and we
may sit in on the World's Series, play
by play, and still be 3,000 miles away.
All these things and many, many
more, and yet it is not one whit easier
to solve the problem of ourselves, and
of the other human beings with whom
we shall come in contact.
In (his great problem, in learning
how to worship in the greatest of all
religions, the religion of humanity,
Stanford has given us her greatest
gift, a trained mind. From our fore

fathers, the builders of this great re
publican commonwealth, we inherit
the right of free thought, and from
this our University we inherit, and
should take the ability to use it. The
greatest heritage of the younger gen
eration today, greater now than ever
before, is this freedom of thought.
And as graduates of Stanford we
should have an intellectual training
that makes that heritage a very golden
one. We have been pushed and
crowded, and bumped, and guided into
using our minds for ourselves, for
four years. The field has been opened,
and the road has been pointed out,
and the horizon has been immeasur
ably widened. That ability to think, to
use the mind, and as Dr. Wilbur said
the other evening, to pursue an intel
lectual life, is Stanford's greatest gift
to us, the one we should cherish the
most, and above all use the most.
In this mental life, and the freedom
of thought, come schemes, ideas,
plans, dreams, and ideals. Ideals of
others, of the world, and of ourselves,
and what we ought to be. These we
have all gained largely from our Uni
versity experience. It is those ideals
of ourselves, that we must always
strive to keep, untarnished, and bend
our efforts to attain them. Be honest
with ourselves, each one of us, always.
And so there are many things to
consider, in leaving these arcades of
Stanford, and I have merely tried to
suggest a few of them. Looking back
ward, into the "never again," the

golden memories we will always have,
and looking to the future, in each to
morrow, as it becomes today, a trained
mind, and the right to use it is our
inheritance. May we be thankful for
it, and use it!

again. Water once over the falls will
j never go over again. We may recall

beautiful gifts from Stanford in the
way of recollections, memories. Memo
ries of things, of places, of incidents,
of people, and of friends. We will come
back from time to time, and the clois

I Quad, will be filled with memories.
! Golden memories, memories that I
| hope you and I may never lose, and
i memories that will be kept beautiful,
memories that will always prove an
j inspiration.
There are other things, more tan
j gible things, that four years of Stan
| ford has given us. Knowledge, in vary
| ing quantities, training, mental and
! physical, and in recognition for efforts
; expended they have given us the right
| to wear these robes, and a sheepskin
. will be ours Monday, they say.
All these things are valuable, some
of them more so than others, but are
they really what we came to Stanford
I for, four years ago? Are they the
things Ave wanted from Stanford. They
are not. We came seeking training in
ways to get into and to play the glori
ous game of life. And from our Univer
sity career, what then are the things
that we should carry out into life.
Well, there are a great number, but
j amongst all the rest there is one that
: seems to me particularly valuable. It
is the right and the ability to think
for ourselves. We go into a most pe
culiar world, a place where we will
doubtless get many knocks and bumps,
where a flunkout means a disaster,
even to the point of hunger possibly,
and where there are no kind-hearted
professors to weaken and give us an
other chance. It is, unfortunately, a
world where the honor system does
not exist, and where justice is a doubt
ful quantity, and where suffering,
bigotry, and inequality seem to be
only too popular. It is, if anything,
our part and our duty to take it all
smilingly, and do our share in better
ing it.
In the University we have learned
something of science, what science
has done for mankind, and something
of what it may do in the future. We
have learned that man has, with vary
ing degrees of success, for many cen
turies been struggling with his en
vironment, and that now nature is
practically our hand-servant.
Colonel Lindbergh can fly to Paris
overnight, and we can see the pictures
of his reception the next day as a re
sult of this battle of science with the
elements, a battle in which Stanford
has played no small part. We may talk
to our friends in London, over the tele
phone, if we have the price, and we
may sit in on the World's Series, play
by play, and still be 3,000 miles away.
All these things and many, many
more, and yet it is not one whit easier
to solve the problem of ourselves, and
of the other human beings with whom
we shall come in contact.
In (his great problem, in learning
how to worship in the greatest of all
religions, the religion of humanity,
Stanford has given us her greatest
gift, a trained mind. From our fore

fathers, the builders of this great re
publican commonwealth, we inherit
the right of free thought, and from
this our University we inherit, and
should take the ability to use it. The
greatest heritage of the younger gen
eration today, greater now than ever
before, is this freedom of thought.
And as graduates of Stanford we
should have an intellectual training
that makes that heritage a very golden
one. We have been pushed and
crowded, and bumped, and guided into
using our minds for ourselves, for
four years. The field has been opened,
and the road has been pointed out,
and the horizon has been immeasur
ably widened. That ability to think, to
use the mind, and as Dr. Wilbur said
the other evening, to pursue an intel
lectual life, is Stanford's greatest gift
to us, the one we should cherish the
most, and above all use the most.
In this mental life, and the freedom
of thought, come schemes, ideas,
plans, dreams, and ideals. Ideals of
others, of the world, and of ourselves,
and what we ought to be. These we
have all gained largely from our Uni
versity experience. It is those ideals
of ourselves, that we must always
strive to keep, untarnished, and bend
our efforts to attain them. Be honest
with ourselves, each one of us, always.
And so there are many things to
consider, in leaving these arcades of
Stanford, and I have merely tried to
suggest a few of them. Looking back
ward, into the "never again," the

golden memories we will always have,
and looking to the future, in each to
morrow, as it becomes today, a trained
mind, and the right to use it is our
inheritance. May we be thankful for
it, and use it!

things Ave wanted from Stanford. They
are not. We came seeking training in
ways to get into and to play the glori
ous game of life. And from our Univer
sity career, what then are the things
that we should carry out into life.
Well, there are a great number, but
j amongst all the rest there is one that
: seems to me particularly valuable. It
is the right and the ability to think
for ourselves. We go into a most pe
culiar world, a place where we will
doubtless get many knocks and bumps,
where a flunkout means a disaster,
even to the point of hunger possibly,
and where there are no kind-hearted
professors to weaken and give us an
other chance. It is, unfortunately, a
world where the honor system does
not exist, and where justice is a doubt
ful quantity, and where suffering,
bigotry, and inequality seem to be
only too popular. It is, if anything,
our part and our duty to take it all
smilingly, and do our share in better
ing it.
In the University we have learned
something of science, what science
has done for mankind, and something
of what it may do in the future. We
have learned that man has, with vary
ing degrees of success, for many cen
turies been struggling with his en
vironment, and that now nature is
practically our hand-servant.
Colonel Lindbergh can fly to Paris
overnight, and we can see the pictures
of his reception the next day as a re
sult of this battle of science with the
elements, a battle in which Stanford
has played no small part. We may talk
to our friends in London, over the tele
phone, if we have the price, and we
may sit in on the World's Series, play
by play, and still be 3,000 miles away.
All these things and many, many
more, and yet it is not one whit easier
to solve the problem of ourselves, and
of the other human beings with whom
we shall come in contact.
In (his great problem, in learning
how to worship in the greatest of all
religions, the religion of humanity,
Stanford has given us her greatest
gift, a trained mind. From our fore

fathers, the builders of this great re
publican commonwealth, we inherit
the right of free thought, and from
this our University we inherit, and
should take the ability to use it. The
greatest heritage of the younger gen
eration today, greater now than ever
before, is this freedom of thought.
And as graduates of Stanford we
should have an intellectual training
that makes that heritage a very golden
one. We have been pushed and
crowded, and bumped, and guided into
using our minds for ourselves, for
four years. The field has been opened,
and the road has been pointed out,
and the horizon has been immeasur
ably widened. That ability to think, to
use the mind, and as Dr. Wilbur said
the other evening, to pursue an intel
lectual life, is Stanford's greatest gift
to us, the one we should cherish the
most, and above all use the most.
In this mental life, and the freedom
of thought, come schemes, ideas,
plans, dreams, and ideals. Ideals of
others, of the world, and of ourselves,
and what we ought to be. These we
have all gained largely from our Uni
versity experience. It is those ideals
of ourselves, that we must always
strive to keep, untarnished, and bend
our efforts to attain them. Be honest
with ourselves, each one of us, always.
And so there are many things to
consider, in leaving these arcades of
Stanford, and I have merely tried to
suggest a few of them. Looking back
ward, into the "never again," the

golden memories we will always have,
and looking to the future, in each to
morrow, as it becomes today, a trained
mind, and the right to use it is our
inheritance. May we be thankful for
it, and use it!

We are assembled here, in our last
meeting as a corporate body, as an
integral part of Stanford University.
A sad thought that is to be sure. Of
course, we all recognize what a great
loss the University is about to suffer,
and it is equally true that in our
saner moments it becomes painfully
evident what a great loss we are about
to suffer ourselves. For, though we are
all anxious to shake the dust of rou
tine classroom work from our shoes
and step out into the world as it is,
a world in which some of us will be
great and some not so great, there
are many common bonds among our
selves, and between us and the Uni
versity, that will be broken forever,
Monday afternoon.

j At this corner, one of the many
| corners of life, we are wont to pause
; a moment, to reflect, and to contem
plate. We think of what lies behind
us and what lies before. At such a
moment it is only natural that we
should be a bit saddened by the fact
that what lies behind cannot be done
again. Water once over the falls will
j never go over again. We may recall
| mentally, and I think we have many
beautiful gifts from Stanford in the
way of recollections, memories. Memo
ries of things, of places, of incidents,
of people, and of friends. We will come
back from time to time, and the clois
ters and arcades of the Quad, our
I Quad, will be filled with memories.
! Golden memories, memories that I
| hope you and I may never lose, and
i memories that will be kept beautiful,
memories that will always prove an
j inspiration.
There are other things, more tan
j gible things, that four years of Stan
| ford has given us. Knowledge, in vary
| ing quantities, training, mental and
! physical, and in recognition for efforts
; expended they have given us the right
