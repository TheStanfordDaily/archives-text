By Class Historian
Viewed in the perspective of half a j
century, the achievements of the Class |
of 1927 could better be judged. We are j
still standing too near the events to i
be able to estimate their true worth.
We are, besides, too prejudiced a j
group to be able to accurately judge
the significances of the accomplish- j
ments of'this class. We are back stage, 1
so to speak. In this history facts alone I
will be related. No comments of their !
worth will be attempted. It can easily j
be seen what the class has physically 1
accomplished; the experiences which j
the organization has actually known
can be pointed out; but the signifi
cance of these accomplishments and
these '• experiences are beyond our
scope.
Looking back now to the fall of 1923
we see new men moving into Encina '
Hall and women taking up their abode j
in Roble. The gentlemen members of
this class were the first to have the j
privilege of living together in Encina. !
In remembering that one year in En-'
cina, it can be said with a great deal i
of sincerity that it was a privilege for j
the new class to be able to live in one (
hall and learn the first principles of ,
— — I

. Stanfordism together. From this close
j contact, the Class of 1927 became a
; united band which in later life will
never be separated in spirit despite
i the great physical severance that will
( take place Monday. From the first
; year of life together the members of
the class acquired a greater liking for
j each other and a greater love for the
j University.
When the 1927 freshman football
j team defeated the University of Cali
j fornia freshman eleven, the class was
hailed as the greatest athletic group
j that had ever entered Stanford, but.
the next year the freshman team
again defeated the Bears, and the
praise was transferred from 1927 to
1925. Nevertheless, the fact remains
that it was in the fall of 1923 that the
l present Senior Class started the ball
| rolling toward California's athletic
: downfall. It will be remembered that
the first freshman track victory in liis
i tory was registered in the spring of
| that same college year. The yearling
' tennis and basketball teams had like
j success in their particular sports.
But the 1927 freshmen's talents were
! not confined to physical excellency
I for the records show that the scholas
j tic rating of the class was the best
i made by any up to that time. The
l
i class contributed its share of quality
jto debating, dramatics, journalism,
and politics as well.
It has been an error in the past to
believe that a class - at Stanford con
sists of men only. The 1927 freshman
women, as small as they were in num
bers, would not be put in the back
ground. During the first year, and in
the three years that followed, they
I have asserted themselves and taken
j active parts in University activities —•
i both academic and extra curricular.
| Their attempts for personal liberty,
| which are always intellectual moves,
! have been demonstrated by their deci
j sion to smoke in their living groups
| instead of, behind the barn or in the
cactus gardens. The 1927 women's in
fluence is still being felt, and their
■beginning toward correcting the pres
ent lockout rules will be the paving
stones upon which future classes can
build their new rules and regulations.
Besides the present senior women
have shown that beauty and brains
are two qualities that can be mixed
in good proportions in a college co-ed.
The Class of 1927 smiled at most of
[ the established traditions. Believing
j many of these traditions worthless,
members of the graduating class have
! been instrumental in their downfall,
i The dink disappeared along with the
corncob pipe. Hazing in all forms was
j abolished.
And now we stand with a college
career behind us. We are leaving th;>
Quad —we hope in a better condition
than we found it. Wo are taking our
athletes, our debaters, our journalists,
and our regulars with us. We have
taken what the University has offered
and now are leaving. But this is not.
a selfish gesture, for these young men
and women will return some day after
they have given what thoy have to
offer to the world. The University will
then be repaid by its children who
have served the world well in reflect
ing what Stanford has given them.
