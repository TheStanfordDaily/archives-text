# AUDIENCE PLEASED BY PRODUCTION OF 1927 CLASS FARCE
## "So This Is London" Scores As One of Year's Best Entertainments 
### Dud Ross 
"So This Is London," the senior
farce by Arthur Goodrich, proved to
be exceedingly hilarious. Presented by
Gordon Davis last Wednesday night,
the comedy was well acted and re
ceived enthusiastically by the audi
ence. A take-off on the opinions held
of each other by Americans and Eng
lish, (he farce was one of the most
entertaining plays that has been pro
duced on the Stanford stage in sev
eral years.
The setting off of rabid Americans
against equally rabid Britishers proved
a truly great opportunity for a farcical
play, and Goodrich never lost a chance
to get a great amount of fun out of
the situations.
Goodrich's dialogue was particularly
apt and kept the rather flimsy plot
together so that there was no drag
ging to the action. Only once, during
the second act at the home of Sir
Percy Beauchamp, did the action of
the play become rather • slow. The
freshness of the play seemed to be lost
for a time during this scene. But in
the final act the meeting between the
two families was filled with humor.
The plot need not be criticized from
the point of reality, for in such a farce
reality is unnecessary and superfluous.
However, the two scenes in which
both the English and Americans pic
tured the other nation as they imag
ined it were surprisingly apt and un
derstanding.
Direction Excellent
The direction of Gordon Davis and
the work of Leslie Kiler in staging
"So This Is London" were immensely
good, and combined in making an ex
cellent production. The acting carried
out well the spirit of the play, and
there was little halting at any time
during the evening.
Honors in acting would be hard to
distribute, for the cast maintained a
high standard throughout the play. All
of the leads were well cast, so that
there were no misfitting types in the
production. The two difficult charac
terizations of the English and the
American business men and fathers
were well carried out, both John At
will and Howard Wickersham taking
their parts easily as Hiram Draper and
Sir Percy Beauchamp. Atwill por
trayed interestingly the American go
getter and general good fellow, while
Wickersham made an exceedingly good
type as the pompous old Britisher.
Plenty of Humor
Both Sarali Margaret Burns and
Leonard Schwartz provided a great
deal of humor as Elinor Beauchamp
and the young Draper 111 their efforts
to reconcile their families to the fact
that they had fallen in love with
someone not of their own country.
They were ambassadors extraordinary
in bringing England and America into
better mutual understanding. Both
were almost ideal in the role of the
two lovers.
The parts of the two mothers were
difficult ones in which to maintain
consistent interest, but Barbara Frick
and Louise Buxton succeeded in mak
ing them real. Miss Frick fitted well
into the place of the unassuming and
quiet Englishwoman, Lady Beauchamp,
while Miss Buxton's work was par
ticularly good in the interlude of the
second act.
Lady Ducksworth Capable
Elizabeth Wilbur as Lady Ducks
worth very capably filled her role. Her
stage presence never fails to carry
over a part which may have weak
nesses in itself. As Mr. Honeycott,
George Mauser made an engaging
characterization of the English busi
ness man.
In minor roles David Stollery, Doug
las Gregg, and Robert Sears completed
the good casting of the farce.

there was little halting at any time
during the evening.
Honors in acting would be hard to
distribute, for the cast maintained a
high standard throughout the play. All
of the leads were well cast, so that
there were no misfitting types in the
production. The two difficult charac
terizations of the English and the
American business men and fathers
were well carried out, both John At
will and Howard Wickersham taking
their parts easily as Hiram Draper and
Sir Percy Beauchamp. Atwill por
trayed interestingly the American go
getter and general good fellow, while
Wickersham made an exceedingly good
type as the pompous old Britisher.
Plenty of Humor
Both Sarali Margaret Burns and
Leonard Schwartz provided a great
deal of humor as Elinor Beauchamp
and the young Draper 111 their efforts
to reconcile their families to the fact
that they had fallen in love with
someone not of their own country.
They were ambassadors extraordinary
in bringing England and America into
better mutual understanding. Both
were almost ideal in the role of the
two lovers.
The parts of the two mothers were
difficult ones in which to maintain
consistent interest, but Barbara Frick
and Louise Buxton succeeded in mak
ing them real. Miss Frick fitted well
into the place of the unassuming and
quiet Englishwoman, Lady Beauchamp,
while Miss Buxton's work was par
ticularly good in the interlude of the
second act.
Lady Ducksworth Capable
Elizabeth Wilbur as Lady Ducks
worth very capably filled her role. Her
stage presence never fails to carry
over a part which may have weak
nesses in itself. As Mr. Honeycott,
George Mauser made an engaging
characterization of the English busi
ness man.
In minor roles David Stollery, Doug
las Gregg, and Robert Sears completed
the good casting of the farce.
"So This Is London," the senior
farce by Arthur Goodrich, proved to
be exceedingly hilarious. Presented by
Gordon Davis last Wednesday night,
the comedy was well acted and re
ceived enthusiastically by the audi
ence. A take-off on the opinions held
of each other by Americans and Eng
lish, (he farce was one of the most
entertaining plays that has been pro
duced on the Stanford stage in sev
eral years.
The setting off of rabid Americans
against equally rabid Britishers proved
a truly great opportunity for a farcical
play, and Goodrich never lost a chance
to get a great amount of fun out of
the situations.
Goodrich's dialogue was particularly
apt and kept the rather flimsy plot
together so that there was no drag
ging to the action. Only once, during
the second act at the home of Sir
Percy Beauchamp, did the action of
the play become rather • slow. The
freshness of the play seemed to be lost
for a time during this scene. But in
the final act the meeting between the
two families was filled with humor.
The plot need not be criticized from
the point of reality, for in such a farce
reality is unnecessary and superfluous.
However, the two scenes in which
both the English and Americans pic
tured the other nation as they imag
ined it were surprisingly apt and un
derstanding.
Direction Excellent
The direction of Gordon Davis and
the work of Leslie Kiler in staging
"So This Is London" were immensely
good, and combined in making an ex
cellent production. The acting carried
out well the spirit of the play, and
there was little halting at any time
during the evening.
