# SENIORS ADOPT NEW PLAN OF PLEDGING MONEY TO STANFORD
## 
### 
The Senior Class is pledging annual
contributions to the alumni university
fund that has been established this
year instead of giving toward an en
dowment insurance as has been done I
in the past.
These annual gifts, the size of which |
is according to each individual's de-1
cision. are to be made annually and
will be available for the University i
budget for such uses as the adminis- i
tration finds most desirable. The new 1
plan of gifts was adopted because it
provided that the money be immedi
ately available instead of being de
layed for the term of years required
for an endowment insurance to ma
ture.
Although contributors may, if they j
choose, specify the uses to which they j
desire their contributions devoted, the
majority are leaving the matter wholly
to the judgment of the University I
each year. Since pledges are still com- j
ing in, especially from those who have ;
graduated earlier in the year and are 1
not now on the campus, it is impos- j
sible to estimate the total subscrip- j
tion of the class.
Each student has the opportunity
to pledge the amount he wishes with 1
the privilege of changing or revoking
this amount should it become neces-1
sary. The amount will be payable an- j
nually over an indefinite period of 1
years, the first payment being due on !
November 1, 1927.
The class has also given the Unj-'
versity a drinking fountain for the \
last of the four corners of the Inner j
Quad, each of the three preceding
classes having given one.
