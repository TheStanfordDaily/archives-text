# OPEN ENCINA HALL AS STUDENTS FILL TOYON AND UNION
## Fraternity Houses Report Brisk Demand for More Accommodations ROBLE NEARS CAPACITY Requests by Women for Rooms May Cause Use Of Manzanita 
### 
Prospects of a record-breaking regis
tration for the summer quarter were
seen today with the announcement
that for the first time for a summer
quarter Eneina Hall has been thrown
open to take care of the demand for
rooms by men students.
Stanford Union and Toyon, also dor
mitories for men, are both filled. The
filling of the halls for men students
is significant as showing that the total
enrollment of the quarter will have a
good proportion of men, it was pointed
out on the campus today.
While there is a tendency in some
universities for the summer term to
take on the appearance of a young
women's seminary, the Stanford sum
mer quarter will be something very
different from a party for women only,
it was indicated.
Women Well Represented
Women, however, will be well repre
sented, it was shown. Roble Hall is
rapidly filling and the authorities are
prepared to open Manzanita Hall, also
for women, if the demand for rooms
continues.
In addition to the men's dormitories,
several of the fraternity houses are
open for the summer and all these re
port a brisk demand for quarters.
Definite figures on advanced regis
tration are not yet available, but it
is known that a large number of stu
dents taking work during jthe other
* three quarters were making plans to
register for the summer, and an unu
sually large number of students be
ginning their Stanford course as fresh
men is expected in addition to the en
rollment of men and women who are
taking only the summer quarter work
liere.
Come From Far Away
Students making application for
rooms at the dormitories are from
widely different parts of the country.
Many of those who will be in residence
for the quarter were also here last
summer.
For some time the officers of ad
ministration have been besieged with
â€¢students seeking rooms. The student
custodian of Stanford Union, thinking
business would be dull toward the end
of the spring quarter, obtained em
ployment on a building being erected
near the gymnasium. He soon had
prospective summer quarter students
following him around as he worked
and trying to get the best among the
rapidly disappearing number of avail
able rooms at the Union.
