# DAVIS CALLS FOR GENERAL TRYOUT FOR THREE PLAYS
## Summons at Once Those Who Seek Parts During Summer Quarter ALL CAN BE ENTRIES Candidates Asked to Appear Tomorrow Afternoon And Evening 
### 
Tryouts for parts in summer quar
ter plays will be held by Professor
Gordon Davis, Director of Dramatics,
in the Assembly Hall tomorrow, from
3 to 5 in the afternoon and from 7 to 9
in the evening.
Participation in the three perform
ances of the quarter is open to all stu
dents, without regard to whether they
are enrolled in special dramatics or
speaking classes or not, and all in
tending to try for roles are urged to
come out the first play, no matter
which play they are interested in.
No Limitation on Participation
There are no limitations on partici
pation in dramatic performances dur
ing the summer quarter. Students of
all classes, men and women, are eligi
ble to take parts, and a student is per
mitted to appear in more than one
play if his ability justifies his selec
tion.
"I want to get an early survey of
the dramatic talent available," Direc
tor Davis says,"and for this purpose
am eager that all who want to show
their ability for any play shall come
to this first day's tryout, rather than
wait for a time nearer the particular
play they think they want to have
parts in. If I can get a fairly good
idea of all the material we have I can
come nearer casting for all the plays
with the best effect than otherwise,
and those who demonstrate their abil
ity at once for later plays are likely
to be selected, at least tentatively, for
roles now."
Plays of Different Moods
Three plays, offering wide variety
of theme and mood, will be presented
during the quarter. The first will be
"Craig's Wife," by George Kelly, on
Friday, July 8. Three weeks later, Fri
day, July 29, Galsworthy's "Loyalties"
will be given. The third play, "The
Angel in the House," by Eden Phil
potts, will be offered Friday, August
12. â€¢
