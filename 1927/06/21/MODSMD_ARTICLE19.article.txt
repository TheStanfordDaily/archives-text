Theatre Recently Completed
The Woodland Theatre, recently
completed by the Hillsborough school
district, was inspired by the large at
tendance at last year's series of Phil
harmonic Symphony concerts. It is
set in the woods. The acoustics are
remarkably good.
Special prices for students and fac
ulty of the summer quarter have been
fixed as follows: Tickets for the series
of five concerts will be $2.50 or $5.00,
depending on the section in which
they are placed. All seats will be re
served. The Fortune Yellow Cab Com
pany has agreed to transport to and
from the campus by automobile all
subscribers to this series for the spe
cial price of fifty cents for the round
