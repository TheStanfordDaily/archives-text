### 
The Stanford student body during the summer quarter contains a
large proportion of men and women who are not taking continuous
courses here, but such students are just as fully and completely Stanford
students while they are here as any who are enrolled during the other
quarters. There are no strangers or aliens at Stanford. The men and
women who are here make up the student body while they are here; they
are Stanford University.
Our situation and character as a residence university, with the great
majority of the students and faculty living close together in the campus
community, make it easy for all to become quickly united in the Stanford
spirit.
The Stanford spirit is one of fellowship; it involves participation in
Stanford affairs, sharing in the interests of the community. The neces
sary first step toward this is for Stanford people to become acquainted
with each other, and provision is made for this at the very outset of the
quarter. The various informal gatherings have been arranged with this
purpose in view—to get Stanford people acquainted with each other as
quickly as possible in order that all of us may become Stanford men
and women without delay, and that we may have a real Stanford student
body from the beginning.
