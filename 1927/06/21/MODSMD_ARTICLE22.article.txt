The purpose of The Stanford Daily—it seems better to retain the
established name during the summer quarter in spite of the anamoly of
a daily published twice a week—is to tell the men and women of Stanford
what is going on in their community and to serve as a medium of the
expression of their opinions. In the absence of athletics and most of the
other manifold student activities which help to bring students together
in unified interests during the other quarters, the Daily serves as one
of the few centralizing influences during the quarter. It is extremely
eager to perform this function as completely as possible.
To this end the Daily welcomes communications from its readers
on any subjects pf common interest. Make it your paper; use it to
advance ideas that you believe would benefit the university. The Daily
will be glad to print communications from its readers on matters of
interest and offers its columns for the discussion of any topics that can
profitably be threshed out thus concerning Stanford affairs.
Please make your letters brief, not more than 200 or 250 words long
and shorter if possible, and as an evidence of good faith sign your name
—although your name need not be published if you prefer to have it
kept confidential. The paper will be made most interesting and useful
if its owners and readers, the Associated Students, of which all regis
tered students are automatically members, use it to the utmost as a
forum for the public discussion of matters of common interest.
