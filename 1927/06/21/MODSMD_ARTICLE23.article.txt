# Extra-Curricular
## 
### 
Summer quarter students at Stanford are. as a whole, serious-minded
and earnest men and women. They come here for definite purposes and
devote themselves rather intensively to their work. They select the
courses that meet their needs and pay strict attention to their knitting.
But not all the education to he obtained here this summer is arranged
in courses for university credit. Any student who applies himself too
exclusively to course subjects and omits all the various lecture series
will miss more than he will gain through "saving" the time for his
class work.
There is real danger that earnest students will overlook this; they
welcome absence of distracting "extra-curricular activities," but may not
appreciate that the kind of extra-curricular opportunities included in the
weekly music programs of Warren D. Allen, the presentations of literary
subjects by cultured men Wednesday afternoons, and the discussion of
significant topics by authoritative experts Tuesday evenings are as fully
educational as the courses that are registered for. In some ways these
lectures that are not "required" are of greater value than the others, for
breadth of interest and appreciation is an essential quality of a genuinely
educated, a really cultured man. These general lectures should be as
carefully included in the summer program as any for which the roll is
called.
