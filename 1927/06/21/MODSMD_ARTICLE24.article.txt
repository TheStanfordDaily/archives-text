# Call to Play Actors
## 
### 
The call has gone out for all aspirants for roles in any of the three
plays to be given this summer to report tomorrow in the Assembly Hall
for the preliminary tests upon which Director Gordon Davis will base
his selection of casts. Professor Davis will have all three of the plays in
mind in his estimate of the ability of the candidates. The first of the
plays will be presented 011 July 8, less than three weeks from now, so
that there is a very brief time for preparation for that performance. On
every account all who hope to take part in any of the plays should report
tomorrow.
Dramatics is one of the few "activities" that continue in full force
during the summer. Participation affords not only pleasant associations
but a most beneficial training for any who are capable of doing the work.
