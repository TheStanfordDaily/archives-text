# The 						Sunday Symphonies
## 
### 
There will be no need to urge upon those who attended the Sunday
afternoon symphony concerts at Hillsborough last summer the desirability
of taking advantage of the special rates to the series offered to Stanford
faculty and students. To those who appreciate good music the names of
the conductors and the known ability of the members of the orchestra is
sufficient guarantee of the excellence of this series.
Since last summer a new theatre has been completed, which is even
more attractive than the location that was employed then, and the con
venience of attending, for those who do not drive their own automobiles,
has been greatly increased by the provision of taxi service at fifty cents
for the round trip.
