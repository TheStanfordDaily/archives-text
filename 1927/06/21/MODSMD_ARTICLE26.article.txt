# “WHAT CAN I GIVE?” SHOULD BE STUDENT QUERY, SAYS WILBUR
## President Points Out Need For Scholars in Political Service 
### 
Speaking directly to the graduating
class, President Wilbur concluded his
commencement address yesterday by
an appeal for an attitude of service.
Stressing the need for scholarship in
politics and community service, the
president expressed the hope that the
students might each ask, "What can I
give?" and not "What can I get?"
His address follows:
"You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way back into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.
"It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
broad way this hcis been done in the
hope that you will make adequate re
turn as the result of this opportunity.
In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.
Needed in Politics
"In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the 'you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours' type.
"Many of our most successful
politicians owe their advance to
the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Many Ways to Serve
"Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
"One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia In all fields is past. If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first, and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Do Something
"Above all, do not satisfy your desire

for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest abouf'this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.
"Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
"In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can 1 get."

as far as modern transportation can

take up a wide variety of occupations

Needed in Politics
"In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the 'you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours' type.
"Many of our most successful
politicians owe their advance to
the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Many Ways to Serve
"Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
"One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia In all fields is past. If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first, and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Do Something
"Above all, do not satisfy your desire

for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest abouf'this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.
"Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
"In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can 1 get."
Speaking directly to the graduating
class, President Wilbur concluded his
commencement address yesterday by
an appeal for an attitude of service.
Stressing the need for scholarship in
politics and community service, the
president expressed the hope that the
students might each ask, "What can I
give?" and not "What can I get?"
His address follows:

turn as the result of this opportunity.
In an era of prosperity such as we
are passing through in this country,
it is easy to be swept off your feet by
the possibilities of the rapid accumu
lation of wealth or of power and to
forget or delay that service to the
public which is now a part of your
heritage.
Needed in Politics
"In the field of politics today in this
or in any other country the educated
man or woman who is willing to think
in terms of political life is greatly
needed. With the increasing complexi
ties that have come from our applica
tion of science to civilization the dan
gers of bad government are greater
than ever before. The attempt to har
ness economic forces by legislation
and the increasing control of ordinary
citizens and groups to obtain that
order necessary in a complicated so
cial mechanism demand unusual skill
and wisdom in the domain of politics.
Unfortunately, much of our politics is
based on pure selfishness of the 'you
scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours' type.
"Many of our most successful
politicians owe their advance to
the fact that they have been able
to accomplish some selfish purpose in
practically everything that they have
done. Our direct primary system lends
self-promoter. There is plenty of dis
itself to the type of man who is a
appointment and disillusionment
awaiting the man who enters the field
of politics, but great satisfactions are
also possible. Much of the immediate
future of the world depends upon the
actions of political leaders. Unless a
large percentage of men trained to
think scientifically and with a strong
sense of public duty enter this field,
we can anticipate human difficulties of
the major sort, no matter how rapid
our advance may be in the develop
ment of wealth, organization, or
science.
Many Ways to Serve
"Aside from the field of politics, pub
lic service in hundreds of different
fields offers a natural opportunity for
the university graduate. We hope that
you will take up your share of such
service in your own neighborhood.
Whether it is as a member of a school
board, community chest, board of man
agers of a hospital, or some other
form of service, is not so important
as it is to spend some of your time
on that unpaid public service which,
if well done, offers greater rewards
than can come from any financial
gain.
"One of our hopes for you is that
you will be able to speak authorita
tively in at least one field of human
knowledge. We trust that you have
learned when to call in the expert
and let him do the talking and make
the decisions. The day when a college
graduate was supposed to be a uni
versal expert and a vest-pocket en
cyclopedia In all fields is past. If you
are to gain respect you must know
what you are talking about. Just as
you have found in the classroom and
laboratory, you must study first, and
talk afterward. Some of our students
pass through many unnecessary diffi
culties because they use their brains
for the making of excuses and to ra
tionalize foolishness or unwise things
that they have done rather than to do
the day's work in a creditable manner.
Do Something
"Above all, do not satisfy your desire

for community service with simple
talk with your associates or with pub
lic forum letters or with letters of
protest abouf'this or that. Do some
thing! Then study the effects of what
you have done. The important thing is
to get your ideas formulated suffi
ciently so that you can act upon them.
"Scholarship does not mean isola
tion and mere self-polishing, although
there may be such periods in the life
of a scholar. Serviceable scholarship
means participation in the life about
you. Make your participation count in
the upbuilding of your surroundings.
It is better to build bricks into a firm
foundation than to keep them loose to
throw about on occasions.
"In brief, we hope that your attitude
toward the world will be, what can I
give, not what can 1 get."
Speaking directly to the graduating
class, President Wilbur concluded his
commencement address yesterday by
an appeal for an attitude of service.
Stressing the need for scholarship in
politics and community service, the
president expressed the hope that the
students might each ask, "What can I
give?" and not "What can I get?"
His address follows:
"You came to Stanford University
from many parts of the world, from
all sorts of educational institutions,
and with varied life experiences. For
some years you have joined in on the
common life of our campus, taken part
in certain activities of the Univer
sity, and you are now ready to find
your way back into the outside world.
We know that some of you will go
as far as modern transportation can
carry you. We know, too, that you will
take up a wide variety of occupations
and will continue that personal de
velopment which your work here has
furthered.
"It is our particular hope that you
will, from the beginning, sense the
definite responsibility which is yours
because of your education. Society has
made it possible for you to use a cer
tain amount of time beyond the aver
age in the preparation for life. In a
