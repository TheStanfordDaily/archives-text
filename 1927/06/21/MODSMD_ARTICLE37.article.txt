# WILBUR APPEALS FOR INCREASED INTEREST IN PACIFIC PROBLEMS
## Tells Graduating Class of Need for Study of Far East 
### 
Problems of the Pacific were
brought before the graduating class
yesterday by President Wilbur at the
graduation exercises. President Wil
bur's address follows in part:
Just Discussing Pacific
"Here in California we are just be
ginning to discover the Pacific. We
find that more and more we are turn
ing our faces to the West, watching
our ports, following our steamship
lines, and observing the affairs of our
neighbors to the north, south, and
across the great ocean. The Panama
Canal has compelled a new outlook
and the development of many new
contacts. This has come at the time
when the mistakes of those governing
the countries of the world peaked up
in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world has become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation has been established.
New Power in East
"In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. The great
question is, how can the countries of
the Pacific help each other in working
out not only the problems of the ocean
itself but those of the individual coun
tries bordering upon it. Fundamentally

the peoples of all these countries face i
the same questions of food, housing,
order, the care against its enemies
and of property against loss.
Many Common Interests
"The world's food supply at the
present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu- !
man reservoirs of disease. One man j
gets daily bread by the turn of a!
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must, not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance, j
Goods cross national lines in quanti-'
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the i
development of a desire for sympa- 1
thetic co-operation?"

in the great World War. Coming too
at a time when the world has become
the seat of applied knowledge based
upon research done in the world's
laboratories and factories, a new
structure of human relationships in
the fields of finance, trade, and trans
portation has been established.
New Power in East
"In this present era we see in Rus
sia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and
Mexico definite evidences of new
forces with new driving power. The
peoples of the world are on the move,
particularly in the Pacific. The great
question is, how can the countries of
the Pacific help each other in working
out not only the problems of the ocean
itself but those of the individual coun
tries bordering upon it. Fundamentally

the peoples of all these countries face i
the same questions of food, housing,
order, the care against its enemies
and of property against loss.
Many Common Interests
"The world's food supply at the
present time is held in common
and we all tap in on the common hu- !
man reservoirs of disease. One man j
gets daily bread by the turn of a!
spindle in one country, although his
food is grown in another. Industry
must, not only devise its machinery
for manufacturing operations but the
mechanisms of trade and finance, j
Goods cross national lines in quanti-'
ties beyond the reach of the imagina
tion and yet those lines can become
barriers almost instantaneously if mis
understanding develops. Shall we drift
along or intelligently try to control the
future by preparation, study, and the i
development of a desire for sympa- 1
thetic co-operation?"
