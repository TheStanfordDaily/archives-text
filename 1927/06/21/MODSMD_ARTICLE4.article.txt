# SELLARDS WOULD HA VE ALL SHARE SUMMER ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
The summer quarter opens today
with a program which has been es
pecially planned to combine intensive
study of the same academic character
as during the rest of the year with the
recreation which belongs naturally to
what has long been regarded as the
vacation period.
In addition to those members of
the regular student body who have
remained with us, a number of you
have come from a distance for the
present quarter only. Representatives
of most of the states of the Union and
of several foreign countries are here
for the summer. As Stanford is a resi
dence university, an unusual oppor
tunity is afforded students to know
one another and to enjoy the closer
relationship which our camput life af
ords.
Distinguished Lecturers Here
On the summer faculty are distin
guished scholars and teachers from
other universities of the United States

and Europe, in addition to those mem
bers of the regular staff who remain
on duty. Lecturers of prominence in
many fields will speak before campus
audiences in the course of the quarter.
Everyone here will have an oppor
tunity to broaden his interests as well
as to advance his academic standing.
In addition to the lectures and con
certs provided at the University, stu
dents have a rare opportunity to hear
good music on Sunday afternoons in
the Woodland theater at Hillsborough.
Through the efforts of the Philhar
monic Society of San Mateo County
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra will give a series of concerts under
distinguished guest conductors. Spe
cial student tickets are offered at a
very low price, and for those who have
not cars a low transportation rate has
been arranged through a local com
pany.
Plan Motor Trips
The summer climate is ideal and
there are many opportunities for out
door recreation. For those who are
strangers to the Santa Clara Valley,
or who have not yet visited the prin
cipal points in this interesting region
of California, a series of week-end
motor excursions has been planned to
enable students to make these trips
with congenial companions.
We want you to take full advantage
of the resources of Stanford < and also
to thoroughly enjoy your stay here. It
is a pleasure to welcome you to Stan- j
ford.

and Europe, in addition to those mem
bers of the regular staff who remain
on duty. Lecturers of prominence in
many fields will speak before campus
audiences in the course of the quarter.
Everyone here will have an oppor
tunity to broaden his interests as well
as to advance his academic standing.
In addition to the lectures and con
certs provided at the University, stu
dents have a rare opportunity to hear
good music on Sunday afternoons in
the Woodland theater at Hillsborough.
Through the efforts of the Philhar
monic Society of San Mateo County
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra will give a series of concerts under
distinguished guest conductors. Spe
cial student tickets are offered at a
very low price, and for those who have
not cars a low transportation rate has
been arranged through a local com
pany.
Plan Motor Trips
The summer climate is ideal and
there are many opportunities for out
door recreation. For those who are
strangers to the Santa Clara Valley,
or who have not yet visited the prin
cipal points in this interesting region
of California, a series of week-end
motor excursions has been planned to
enable students to make these trips
with congenial companions.
We want you to take full advantage
of the resources of Stanford < and also
to thoroughly enjoy your stay here. It
is a pleasure to welcome you to Stan- j
ford.

Director of Summer Quarter !
