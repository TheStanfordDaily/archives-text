# SUMMER QUARTER RECORDS BROKEN FOR REGISTRATION
## Reports That Unqualified Students Admitted Are Unfounded 1310 LISTED YESTERDAY Four Times Number Attend For Period Ten Years Ago 
### 
Since the total registration for the
present summer quarter had already
reached 1310 this morning, the number
of students enrolled which was 1127 at
the same time last year, had already
been far exceeded.
Of these 1310 students, 1157 had com
pleted all the essential details necessary
(or complete matriculation. This may
be compared with the 1017 who had fin
ished all the requirements at the cor
responding time lfist summer. 'I he re
ceipt of credentials from high schools
and junior colleges is the principal con
sideration thus far preventing com
pleted registration of the remainder of
the 1310 students admitted up to the
present date.
Sets New Record
When registration was finally com
pleted for last year's summer session
the grand total was 1194. Therefore
last year's final summer enrollment h°s
already been exceeded this morning.
Contrary to reports in the news
papers that students had been admitted
during the summer quarter who could
not have met the minimum require
ments during other quarters, it may be
stated that no such individuals have
been registered. Some students, how
ever, who had fulfilled these prerequi
sites to matriculation but who had not
been among the 450 admitted during
last year's regular autumn quarter, have
-entered during the present quarter in
order to seek more favorable considera
tion next fall by making good scholar
ship records during the summer.
Grows From 338 Total
At the first summer quarter con
ducted by Stanford in 1918, a total of 338
students were registered. This number is
approximately quadrupled during the
•quarter now in progress.
Although the four-quarter plan at
Stanford was begun in 1918, when all
the universities of the country, which
maintained Student Army Training
Corps units made it the rule to do the
.same, the plan to institute it had been
decided upon for that year, after con
sideration in several annual reports of
the president.
In the president's report published in
1917, the plan was formally adopted.
"During the year the plan of continu
ous session mentioned in my report for
1915-16 was fully developed by a sub
committee of the Executive Committee,
adopted by the Academic Council on
December 7, and approved by your
board December 28, 1916," states the
report.
