# STANFORD PICKED TO WIN NATIONAL TITLE IN COLLEGE TENNIS
## Holman Leading Contender In Merion Match Next Week 
### 
Stanford will be well represented at
the intercollegiate tennis championship
matches that are to be held at the Merion
Cricket and Tennis Club in Pennsylvania
the middle of next week. Four Cardinals
will take their places on the grass courts
â€”Cranston Holman, Lionel Ogden, Alan
Herrington, and Ralph McElvennv. Hol
man is regarded as likely to bring home
the title this year as he has been runner
up in the tournament for the past two
years, being beaten by "Bud" Chandler,
of the University of California, each
time. The latter is out of college compe
tition this season so that Holman's victory
seems almost inevitable.
The other three Stanford players are
also expected to do well, especially when
they team together in the doubles matches
of the tournament. Holman and Ogden
will form one team, and Herrington and
McKlvenny the second. The former is
regarded as a very strong contender for
the national doubles title, which would
mean a two-fold victory for Stanford if
Holman succeeds in the singles.
The four players will stay in the East
for about a month after the tournament
to play in various other matches.
Holman, who was eighth ranking ten
nis player in the United States two years
ago, and twelfth last year, has been of
fered a chance to try out this year for
the Davis Cup team, an opportunity
which is the greatest honor offered an
amateur tennis player.
