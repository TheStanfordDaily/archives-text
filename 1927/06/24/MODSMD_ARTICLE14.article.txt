# STANFORD PICKED TO WIN NATIONAL TITLE IN COLLEGE TENNIS
## Holman Leading Contender In Merion Match Next Week 
### 
Stanford will be well represented at
the intercollegiate tennis championship
matches that are to be held at the Merion
Cricket and Tennis Club in Pennsylvania
the middle of next week. Four Cardinals
will take their places on the grass courts
—Cranston Holman, Lionel Ogden, Alan
Herrington, and Ralph McElvennv. Hol
man is regarded as likely to bring home
the title this year as he has been runner
up in the tournament for the past two
years, being beaten by "Bud" Chandler,
of the University of California, each
time. The latter is out of college compe
tition this season so that Holman's victory
seems almost inevitable.
