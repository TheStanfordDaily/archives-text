# STANFORD ADOPTS PLAN TO REDUCE LOWER DIVISION
## Trustees Approve Measure Proposed by Dr. Wilbur And Give Him Power To Begin Action MOVE IS RESULT OF YEARS OF DISCUSSION Elimination of Freshmen and Sophomores Foreseen As a Result 
### 
Stanford will still further reduce the
number of students admitted to its
freshman and sophomore classes. The
Board of Trustees at a special meet
ing yesterday afternoon adopted a
resolution approving the recommenda
tion of President Wilbur that this be
done. In all the discussion of Presi
dent Wilbur's proposal that has de
veloped since he made it public, it has
been assumed that it would result ulti
mately in the elimination of the Lower
Division from Stanford.
Since the adoption of the recom
mendation. as formulated in the reso
lution in the adjoining columns, two
trustees have been quoted as holding
that the course that has been entered
upon does not mean a determination
to drop the Lower Division. The con
sensus, however, is that it will ulti
mately reach that end.
Discussion for a Decade
The idea has been under active dis
cussion at Stanford for more than a
decade and was crystallized into a
definite recommendation to the Board
by President Wilbur two months ago.
The plan as formulated by Presi
dent Wilbur and now adopted by the
Trustees, provides that, beginning
year after next, the number of Lower
Division students, already limited, be
further restricted as rapidly as the
development of other institutions pro
vide students prepared for the Stan
ford Upper Class Division classes. Dr.
Wilbur has estimated that the elimina
tion of the junior college years at
Stanford could be completed by Janu
ary 1, 1934, at which time all guaran
tees of preferential consideration to
various classes of applicants for ad
mission to Stanford will have expired.
Rate to Be Determined
President Wilbur will determine the
rapidity with which the Lower Divi
sion classes shall be reduced and
make recommendations to the Board
of Trustees from year to year.
President Wilbur has announced
that it will be the policy of the Uni
versity during the years of progressive
reduction of the Lower Division class
es to give special consideration to the
applications for admission from stu
dents who lack junior college facilities
as well as to children of alumni, who
now have a slight degree of prefer
ence.
President Wilbur's Proposal
The* first public announcement of
this plan now adopted was made by
President Wjlbur to the alumni on
the campus for University Day, April
16. He made the recommendation to
the Board of Trustees a few days be
fore and had laid it before the Stan
ford National Board, then in session
here. In this statement President Wil
bur, after reviewing the development
of the public school system, especially
in California, to provide the first two
college years, said:
"In order to meet the situation, to
protect the Stanford endowment, to
keep the prestige of the University,
and to maintain a position of leader
ship in education, 1 am recommending
to the Board of Trustees that, begin
ning with the academic year 1928-29,
further limitations bemade in the num
ber of students accepted in the Lower
Division in proportion to the number
of applications received from junior
college students. It seems probable at
the present rate of increase in the
number of junior college students that
by the time the present preferences
cease, January 1, 1934, our lower divi
sion work will practically be absorbed
by other institutions."
To Advance Stanford
In moving towards the elimination
of the junior coliege years from Stan
ford, the University authorities believe
that not only are they making the
Stanford endowment more effective
through dropping work that can be
done equally well elsewhere and con
centrating on the more advanced work
that it is especially equipped to offer,
but also that they are setting Stan
ford on a course which all other major
universities will adopt. They point out
that practically all larger universities
have in one way or another divided
the four traditional undergraduate
years into two parts, that many are
limiting the number admitted into the
first two years, that these two years
are organized with somewhat special
ized curriculums designed for the
needs of students at this stage of intel
lectual development, and that the
problems of these two years are be
coming increasingly difficult in the
administration of the institutions on a
university plane. Simultaneously the
work of these two years is being of
fered satisfactorily in a constantly
growing number of junior colleges,
which offer special advantages to stu
dents of junior college age, through
convenience of location near home,
low expense for tuition, and adapta
tion to the needs of boys and girls of
this age exclusively.
Evolution at Stanford
Stanford has been watching develop
ments along this line keenly for a

number of years and Is now organized
on a basis that renders it possible for
it to make this change with no jar or
shock of surprise or unpreparedness.
Twenty years ago Dr. Jordan, then
President of the University, made the
first suggestion at Stanford that the
logical and right thing would be for
Stanford to devote itself solely to
upperclass and graduate work. Every
annual report that Dr. Wilbur has
made since he became president in
1916, has discussed the matter in one
way or another.
Various changes in the organization
of the curriculum during his presi
dency liave prepared for the step that
has now been decided upon. The or
ganization of the Lower Division, with
its special curriculum, and successive
limitations in the numbers admitted
to the two lower classes enable the
University to carry its present policy
into effect merely by continuing simi
lar action.
Transfer Made Easy
The organization of the Upper Divi
sion and graduate years into schools
with general training in different
broad divisions of knowledge offered
beginning with the junior year, with
the abolishment of many former re
quirements imposed by departments
during freshman and sophomore
years, has facilitated the work of stu
dents transferring at the end of their
college sophomore year from junior
colleges and other institutions, and
makes it now possible for Stanford to
drop these two years altogether with
out other modification of its present
system.
Stanford will still further reduce the

freshman and sophomore classes. The

to the Board of Trustees that, begin

further limitations bemade in the num

Division in proportion to the number
of applications received from junior

To Advance Stanford
In moving towards the elimination
of the junior coliege years from Stan
ford, the University authorities believe
that not only are they making the
Stanford endowment more effective
through dropping work that can be
done equally well elsewhere and con
centrating on the more advanced work
that it is especially equipped to offer,
but also that they are setting Stan
ford on a course which all other major
universities will adopt. They point out
that practically all larger universities
have in one way or another divided
the four traditional undergraduate
years into two parts, that many are
limiting the number admitted into the
first two years, that these two years
are organized with somewhat special
ized curriculums designed for the
needs of students at this stage of intel
lectual development, and that the
problems of these two years are be
coming increasingly difficult in the
administration of the institutions on a
university plane. Simultaneously the
work of these two years is being of
fered satisfactorily in a constantly
growing number of junior colleges,
which offer special advantages to stu
dents of junior college age, through
convenience of location near home,
low expense for tuition, and adapta
tion to the needs of boys and girls of
this age exclusively.
Evolution at Stanford
Stanford has been watching develop
ments along this line keenly for a

number of years and Is now organized
on a basis that renders it possible for
it to make this change with no jar or
shock of surprise or unpreparedness.
Twenty years ago Dr. Jordan, then
President of the University, made the
first suggestion at Stanford that the
logical and right thing would be for
Stanford to devote itself solely to
upperclass and graduate work. Every
annual report that Dr. Wilbur has
made since he became president in
1916, has discussed the matter in one
way or another.
Various changes in the organization
of the curriculum during his presi
dency liave prepared for the step that
has now been decided upon. The or
ganization of the Lower Division, with
its special curriculum, and successive
limitations in the numbers admitted
to the two lower classes enable the
University to carry its present policy
into effect merely by continuing simi
lar action.
Transfer Made Easy
The organization of the Upper Divi
sion and graduate years into schools
with general training in different
broad divisions of knowledge offered
beginning with the junior year, with
the abolishment of many former re
quirements imposed by departments
during freshman and sophomore
years, has facilitated the work of stu
dents transferring at the end of their
college sophomore year from junior
colleges and other institutions, and
makes it now possible for Stanford to
drop these two years altogether with
out other modification of its present
system.
Stanford will still further reduce the
number of students admitted to its
freshman and sophomore classes. The
Board of Trustees at a special meet
ing yesterday afternoon adopted a
resolution approving the recommenda
tion of President Wilbur that this be
done. In all the discussion of Presi
dent Wilbur's proposal that has de
veloped since he made it public, it has
been assumed that it would result ulti
mately in the elimination of the Lower
Division from Stanford.
Since the adoption of the recom
mendation. as formulated in the reso
lution in the adjoining columns, two
trustees have been quoted as holding
that the course that has been entered
upon does not mean a determination
to drop the Lower Division. The con
sensus, however, is that it will ulti
mately reach that end.
Discussion for a Decade
The idea has been under active dis
cussion at Stanford for more than a
decade and was crystallized into a
definite recommendation to the Board
by President Wilbur two months ago.
The plan as formulated by Presi
dent Wilbur and now adopted by the
Trustees, provides that, beginning
year after next, the number of Lower
Division students, already limited, be
further restricted as rapidly as the
development of other institutions pro
vide students prepared for the Stan
ford Upper Class Division classes. Dr.
Wilbur has estimated that the elimina
tion of the junior college years at
Stanford could be completed by Janu
ary 1, 1934, at which time all guaran
tees of preferential consideration to
various classes of applicants for ad
mission to Stanford will have expired.
Rate to Be Determined
President Wilbur will determine the
rapidity with which the Lower Divi
sion classes shall be reduced and
make recommendations to the Board
of Trustees from year to year.
President Wilbur has announced
that it will be the policy of the Uni
versity during the years of progressive
reduction of the Lower Division class
es to give special consideration to the
applications for admission from stu
dents who lack junior college facilities
as well as to children of alumni, who
now have a slight degree of prefer
ence.
President Wilbur's Proposal
The* first public announcement of
this plan now adopted was made by
President Wjlbur to the alumni on
the campus for University Day, April
16. He made the recommendation to
the Board of Trustees a few days be
fore and had laid it before the Stan
ford National Board, then in session
here. In this statement President Wil
bur, after reviewing the development
of the public school system, especially
in California, to provide the first two
college years, said:
"In order to meet the situation, to

the abolishment of many former re
quirements imposed by departments
during freshman and sophomore
years, has facilitated the work of stu
dents transferring at the end of their
college sophomore year from junior
colleges and other institutions, and
makes it now possible for Stanford to
drop these two years altogether with
out other modification of its present
system.
Stanford will still further reduce the
number of students admitted to its
freshman and sophomore classes. The
Board of Trustees at a special meet
ing yesterday afternoon adopted a
resolution approving the recommenda
tion of President Wilbur that this be
done. In all the discussion of Presi
dent Wilbur's proposal that has de
veloped since he made it public, it has
been assumed that it would result ulti
mately in the elimination of the Lower
Division from Stanford.
Since the adoption of the recom
mendation. as formulated in the reso
lution in the adjoining columns, two
trustees have been quoted as holding
that the course that has been entered
upon does not mean a determination
to drop the Lower Division. The con
sensus, however, is that it will ulti
mately reach that end.
Discussion for a Decade
The idea has been under active dis
cussion at Stanford for more than a
decade and was crystallized into a
definite recommendation to the Board
by President Wilbur two months ago.
The plan as formulated by Presi
dent Wilbur and now adopted by the
Trustees, provides that, beginning
year after next, the number of Lower
Division students, already limited, be
further restricted as rapidly as the
development of other institutions pro
vide students prepared for the Stan
ford Upper Class Division classes. Dr.
Wilbur has estimated that the elimina
tion of the junior college years at
Stanford could be completed by Janu
ary 1, 1934, at which time all guaran
tees of preferential consideration to
various classes of applicants for ad
mission to Stanford will have expired.
Rate to Be Determined
President Wilbur will determine the
rapidity with which the Lower Divi
sion classes shall be reduced and
make recommendations to the Board
of Trustees from year to year.
President Wilbur has announced
that it will be the policy of the Uni
versity during the years of progressive
reduction of the Lower Division class
es to give special consideration to the
applications for admission from stu
dents who lack junior college facilities
as well as to children of alumni, who
now have a slight degree of prefer
ence.
President Wilbur's Proposal
The* first public announcement of
this plan now adopted was made by
President Wjlbur to the alumni on
the campus for University Day, April
16. He made the recommendation to
the Board of Trustees a few days be
fore and had laid it before the Stan
ford National Board, then in session
here. In this statement President Wil
bur, after reviewing the development
of the public school system, especially
in California, to provide the first two
college years, said:
"In order to meet the situation, to
protect the Stanford endowment, to
keep the prestige of the University,
and to maintain a position of leader
ship in education, 1 am recommending
to the Board of Trustees that, begin
ning with the academic year 1928-29,
further limitations bemade in the num
ber of students accepted in the Lower
Division in proportion to the number
of applications received from junior
college students. It seems probable at
the present rate of increase in the
number of junior college students that
by the time the present preferences
cease, January 1, 1934, our lower divi
sion work will practically be absorbed
by other institutions."
To Advance Stanford
In moving towards the elimination
of the junior coliege years from Stan
ford, the University authorities believe
that not only are they making the
Stanford endowment more effective
through dropping work that can be
done equally well elsewhere and con
centrating on the more advanced work
that it is especially equipped to offer,
but also that they are setting Stan
ford on a course which all other major
universities will adopt. They point out
that practically all larger universities
have in one way or another divided
the four traditional undergraduate
years into two parts, that many are
limiting the number admitted into the
first two years, that these two years
are organized with somewhat special
ized curriculums designed for the
needs of students at this stage of intel
lectual development, and that the
problems of these two years are be
coming increasingly difficult in the
administration of the institutions on a
university plane. Simultaneously the
work of these two years is being of
fered satisfactorily in a constantly
growing number of junior colleges,
which offer special advantages to stu
dents of junior college age, through
convenience of location near home,
low expense for tuition, and adapta
tion to the needs of boys and girls of
this age exclusively.
Evolution at Stanford
Stanford has been watching develop
ments along this line keenly for a

number of years and Is now organized
on a basis that renders it possible for
it to make this change with no jar or
shock of surprise or unpreparedness.
Twenty years ago Dr. Jordan, then
President of the University, made the
first suggestion at Stanford that the
logical and right thing would be for
Stanford to devote itself solely to
upperclass and graduate work. Every
annual report that Dr. Wilbur has
made since he became president in
1916, has discussed the matter in one
way or another.
Various changes in the organization
of the curriculum during his presi
dency liave prepared for the step that
has now been decided upon. The or
ganization of the Lower Division, with
its special curriculum, and successive
limitations in the numbers admitted
to the two lower classes enable the
University to carry its present policy
into effect merely by continuing simi
lar action.
Transfer Made Easy
The organization of the Upper Divi
sion and graduate years into schools
with general training in different
broad divisions of knowledge offered
beginning with the junior year, with
the abolishment of many former re
quirements imposed by departments
during freshman and sophomore
years, has facilitated the work of stu
dents transferring at the end of their
college sophomore year from junior
colleges and other institutions, and
makes it now possible for Stanford to
