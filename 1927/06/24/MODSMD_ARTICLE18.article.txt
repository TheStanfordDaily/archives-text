# STANFORD ADOPTS PLAN TO REDUCE LOWER DIVISION
## Trustees Approve Measure Proposed by Dr. Wilbur And Give Him Power To Begin Action MOVE IS RESULT OF YEARS OF DISCUSSION Elimination of Freshmen and Sophomores Foreseen As a Result 
### 
Stanford will still further reduce the
number of students admitted to its
freshman and sophomore classes. The
Board of Trustees at a special meet
ing yesterday afternoon adopted a
resolution approving the recommenda
tion of President Wilbur that this be
done. In all the discussion of Presi
dent Wilbur's proposal that has de
veloped since he made it public, it has
been assumed that it would result ulti
mately in the elimination of the Lower
Division from Stanford.
Since the adoption of the recom
mendation. as formulated in the reso
lution in the adjoining columns, two
trustees have been quoted as holding
that the course that has been entered
upon does not mean a determination
to drop the Lower Division. The con
sensus, however, is that it will ulti
mately reach that end.
Discussion for a Decade
The idea has been under active dis
cussion at Stanford for more than a
decade and was crystallized into a
definite recommendation to the Board
by President Wilbur two months ago.
The plan as formulated by Presi
dent Wilbur and now adopted by the
Trustees, provides that, beginning
year after next, the number of Lower
Division students, already limited, be
further restricted as rapidly as the
development of other institutions pro
vide students prepared for the Stan
ford Upper Class Division classes. Dr.
Wilbur has estimated that the elimina
tion of the junior college years at
Stanford could be completed by Janu
ary 1, 1934, at which time all guaran
tees of preferential consideration to
various classes of applicants for ad
mission to Stanford will have expired.
Rate to Be Determined
President Wilbur will determine the
rapidity with which the Lower Divi
sion classes shall be reduced and
make recommendations to the Board
of Trustees from year to year.
President Wilbur has announced
that it will be the policy of the Uni
versity during the years of progressive
reduction of the Lower Division class
es to give special consideration to the
applications for admission from stu
dents who lack junior college facilities
as well as to children of alumni, who
now have a slight degree of prefer
ence.
President Wilbur's Proposal
The* first public announcement of
this plan now adopted was made by
President Wjlbur to the alumni on
the campus for University Day, April
16. He made the recommendation to
the Board of Trustees a few days be
fore and had laid it before the Stan
ford National Board, then in session
