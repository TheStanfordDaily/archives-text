# Stanford Leads Again
## 
### 
A present trend toward higher education than has been offered, in the
past faces all universities. The need for further facilities along these lines
presents an almost alarming problem.
As late as fifteen years ago, an A.B. degree was rare in the business
world. Today, the condition is rapidly becoming reversed. The propor
tion of bachelors of art among business men is disquieting to those of us
who have planned to end our education with our undergraduate days.
It is a generally recognizable fact that the first two years of college,
instead of calling for specialized work of any sort, demand a ground work
for what is to follow in the last two years of undergraduate and the years
of graduate study, if they are to follow. The courses given are of a broad,
general nature, and are usually intended primarily for their cultural
value. Any set of well prepared educators can handle this type of work.
In this state, at least, has been growing up a system of secondary edu
cation which can more than adequately handle the equivalent of what is
now our first two years of university or college work. The junior college
system of California has witnessed a remarkable growth during the past
few years and is now as able as any university to cope with the more or
less general needs that students have during their first two years of educa
tion outside of high school. Why not utilize the junior colleges, then, in
order to release the facilities of our universities so that they may increase
the value of the last two years of undergraduate work, and more fully
meet the needs for higher degrees?
Thus we find the explanation of the latest move in the ranks of educa
tors, with Stanford leading the way. The true role of the university will
he in the future, not to lay the groundwork of education; but, leaving that
to competent hands, to add the superstructure of specialized education
which is becoming so vastly necessary in the complex life around us. This
will be the future of American universities, and we are proud that Stan
ford should blaze the trail.
