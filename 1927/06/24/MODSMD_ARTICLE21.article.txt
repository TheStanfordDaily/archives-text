# Week-End Trips
## 
### 
Faculty and students who have come to Stanford from a distance
will welcome the opportunity to visit some of the most interesting of the
nearby localities that is provided by the inexpensive and conveniently
arranged trips that have been planned by Director Sellards. Some of the
students who have attended Stanford for a considerable number of
quarters have not seen some of these places.
The Stanford campus is about the easiest place that can be found to
carry on steady, hard, intellectual work through the summer; we do not
have to struggle against enervating heat or the distraction of outside
interests here. But at the same time, it must he borne in mind that
summer is a normal time for recreation. Many of the students and
faculty members here this quarter will return to their regular tasks with
only the briefest actual vacation, if any at all, after the quarter ends.
The rest and stimulation of visiting new scenes, passing along roads
under giant redwoods, standing on the shore of the Pacific, gazing into
the depths of the starry universe through giant telescopes, will help to
keep body, mind, and spirit invigorated and fresh both for the work of
the present moment and that to which we shall turn after we leave here.
