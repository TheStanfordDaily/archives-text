Tomorrow is Circus Day at Menlo
Park. For the Children's Circus for the
benefit of Stanford Convalescent Home
for Children will be held there tomor
row afternoon at the Menlo Arena Club.
The circus is one 6f the social events of
the peninsula and has in the past raised
thousands of dollars for the home. It is
given by the Auxiliary, and since all the
materials are donated, the entire gate re
ceipts will go to the cause. Those who
have seen the circus rank it high among
the pleasures of the season. The people
who have given their services to the af
fair are all residents of the vicinity, com
ing from Atherton, Menlo Park, Palo
Alto, and Stanford.
The children have been practicing with
the horses and ponies until they can do
all manner of circus stunts. The stake
race for horses, the musical poles for the
ponies, and other events will be as pic
turesque as they will be interesting. The
barrel race, with boys falling down and
their barrels crashing under them, the
greased pig contest, and "Are You There,
Kelly," in which blindfolded boys fan the
air in an effort to hit one another, are
capital fun for all, those who have seen
the preparations declare.
