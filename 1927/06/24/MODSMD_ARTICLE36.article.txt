# HOHLFELD TRACES ENGLISH INFLUENCE ON POET GOETHE
## Begins Literary Lectures With Talk at Little Theatre FINDS AUTHORS ADMIRED Shakespeare, Sterne, Bacon Byron Held in High Regard 
### 
Siiakespeare, Sterne, Roger Bacon,
and Byron all had a share n moulding
the genius of German's greatest poet,
according to Professor Alexander
Hohlfeld in his lecture on "Goethe and
England," Wednesday afternoon, in
the Little Theatre.
Professor Hohlfeld, who is chairman
of the Department of German of the
University of Wisconsin, said that
every period of Goethe's literary
career shows traces of British influ
ence.
His lecture, the first of a series by
various professors on literary subjects,
showed the effect of English ideas and
of English philosophy on Goethe.
Goethe in his Strassburg period aban
doned French rationalism for the Eng
lish romanticism that kindled his
genius to many great works, the lec
turer said.
British Ideas in Faust
Later when the poet was seeking
new truth, the idea of finding a prac
tical expression for philosophy that he
incorporated in the second part of
''Faust" was influenced by British
ideas, Professor Hohlfeld said.
Goethe realized, according to the lec
turer, that there were elements in the
British and in the German national
temperments, which would comple
ment one another; the poet realized
that there would come a benefit to
both races if German thinking could
be combined with British acting.
Mention of Shakespeare
Goethe, according to Professor Hohl
feld, was in the habit of grouping the
figures he regarded highly in threes.
No name except (hat of Shakespeare
appears frequently in this connection
and Shakespeare is mentioned many
times. When he spoke of great drama
he mentioned "Moliere, Shakespeare,
and the Greeks," when he spoke of
the great forces for bringing nature
to men, he mentioned "Bacon, Homer,
and Shakespeare." At other times he
spoke of "Goldsmith, Fielding, and
Shakespeare," and "Spinoza, Linnaeus,
and Shakespeare." For what he called
health and cleanness in art, Goethe
named "Raphael, Mozart, and Shakes
peare," and in later life when he listed
what he called the demonical geniuses
lie named "Napoleon, Byron, and
Shakespeare."
Sterne and Goldsmith had a decided
influence. Professor Hohlfeld said.
While Goethe expressed hostility to
Newton and disliked a certain element j
of British tourists who came to see ,
him for curiosity only, Goethe was not !
unfriendly to the British as a people. I
