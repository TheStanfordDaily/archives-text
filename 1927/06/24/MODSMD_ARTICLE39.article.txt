# SWIMMING HAS PROVED MOST POPULAR SPORT FOR WOMEN THIS TERM
## 
### 
Nearly 100 of the 394 women en
rolled in tlie summer quarter are
going to take gymnasium, according
to the director of Roble Gymnasium,
Mrs. Ruth Calvin.
Of the courses offered, Mrs. Calvin i
states, swimming is proving by far the
most popular, perhaps due to the at
tractions of the sun-drenched pool of
clear water and the excellent equip
ment. The swimming courses are di
vided into elementary, intermediate,
and advanced, the majority being en
rolled in the intermediate class, which i
consists of those able to swim 75
yards by any stroke, and to hold their
own in deep water.
There are also two classes in diving,
elementary and advanced. All that is
needed for the first is courage enough
to fall off the springboard head first,
but for the advanced diving course all
kinds of fancy flip flops will be made ;
from another board ten feet above the j
water.
The work of medical examiner for |
the women students will be handled j
this summer by Dr. Ethel D. Owens in j
place of Dr. Clelia Mosher, who will be !
engaged in research work.
