# Sokoloff Leads Sunday Concert In Hillsborough
## 
### 
The first of five open air concerts by
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
in the Woodland Theater at Hillsbor
ough, to which summer quarter students
and faculty are given special rates, will
be given next Sunday.
Nikolai Sokoloff, conductor of the
Cleveland orchestra, who will lead the
orchestra Sunday, is eminently fitted for
the program which has been arranged,
since it is distinctly modern in its nature,
featuring Rachmaninoff, Debussey, and
Stravinsky. The first selection is a re
quest number, Rachmaninoff's Second
Symphony in E Minor. This is possibly
the composer's strongest work, full of
restrained fire and depth for which
Rachmaninoff is known. The second num
ber is for orchestra, soloists and a chorus.
It is the Blessed Damozel, a lyric poem
in music by Claude Debussey. he soloists
are Myrtle Clair Dollelly, soprano, and
Marguerite O'Dea, contralto. This num
ber is perhaps not so well known as the
Rachmaninoff number or the closing se
lection, but is one of Debussey's most ex
pressive and lyric numbers. The last
number of the famous Berceuse and fin
ale from the suite, the Fire Bird, by
Stravinsky.
Special Rates for Students
Special rates, half the regular prices,
have been arranged for students and
faculty of the summer quarter. These
special rates secure reserved seats at one

Open Air Theater Popular
The concerts are being given under the
auspices of the Philharmonic Society of
San Mateo. The Woodland Theater, in
which the programs are being given is
becoming one of the most famous out
door theaters in the country. It is situ
ated, as its name implies, in a grove in
Hillsborough, and is surrounded by some
of the most magnificent bay trees in the
vicinity. The odor of bay and the lovely
surroundings add much to the effective
ness of the concerts.
Solokoff an Innovator
Nikolai Sokoloff, conductor for this
Sunday's program, is distinctly an inno
vator in the field of orchestration. He is
able to give values to instruments and
instrument groups that few conductors
can approach in effectiveness. It is in
teresting to note that his orchestra, the
Cleyeland Symphony, is the only orches
tra which is tuned to the triangle, most
orchestras being tuned to the oboe.
Won Honors Early
Sokoloff* s musical reputation began
when he was a small boy. At twelve
years he won a scholarship at the Yale
University school of music. At seventeen
he joined the Boston Symphony, one of
the country's ranking orchestras at that
time. In 1914 he formed the Innisfail
String Quartette, and they played at the

Panama Pacific International Expo
sition at San Francisco. Although still a
young man lie has conducted most of the
great orchestras of this country as a '
guest conductor.
Bruno Walter, musical director of the
Municipal Opera in Berlin, has been for

years the guiding genius of the famous
Municipal Festivals. He has also been
conductor of the Munich Opera. He has
been a guest conductor in several large
American cities, and was for two years
with Walter Damrosch as guest conduc
tor of the New York Symphony.
