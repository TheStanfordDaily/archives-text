# Sokoloff Leads Sunday Concert In Hillsborough
## 
### 
The first of five open air concerts by
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
in the Woodland Theater at Hillsbor
ough, to which summer quarter students
and faculty are given special rates, will
be given next Sunday.
Nikolai Sokoloff, conductor of the
Cleveland orchestra, who will lead the
orchestra Sunday, is eminently fitted for
the program which has been arranged,
since it is distinctly modern in its nature,
featuring Rachmaninoff, Debussey, and
Stravinsky. The first selection is a re
quest number, Rachmaninoff's Second
Symphony in E Minor. This is possibly
the composer's strongest work, full of
restrained fire and depth for which
Rachmaninoff is known. The second num
ber is for orchestra, soloists and a chorus.
It is the Blessed Damozel, a lyric poem
in music by Claude Debussey. he soloists
are Myrtle Clair Dollelly, soprano, and
Marguerite O'Dea, contralto. This num
ber is perhaps not so well known as the
Rachmaninoff number or the closing se
lection, but is one of Debussey's most ex
pressive and lyric numbers. The last
number of the famous Berceuse and fin
ale from the suite, the Fire Bird, by
Stravinsky.
