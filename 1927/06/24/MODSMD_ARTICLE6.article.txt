# New Underclassmen Barred From Fraternity Houses
## 
### 
No entering Lower Division student
is permitted to live in a fraternity house
at Stanford unless he is a student from
another university where lie is a mem
ber of a fraternity which has a chapter
house at Stanford. This is a standing
regulation of the University and Dean
Culver has emphasized to entering
Lower Division men that it is in force
as completely during the summer quar
ter as in other terms. Disregard of the
prohibition will count against men who
desire to re-register for the autumn
quarter as effectively as will scholar
ship rating. There is no rule against
Lower Division men taking their meals
in fraternity houses that are open for
that purpose in the summer.
