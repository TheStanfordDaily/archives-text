# FINAL TRYOUTS OF "CRAIG'S WIFE" TO BE HELD TONIGHT
## Gordon Davis Satisfied With Wealth of Material On the Campus 31 MORE TO BE HEARD "Loyalties" and "The Angel in the House" Also to Be Presented Here 
### 
The final tryout for "Craig's Wife,"
the first play, which is to he put on July
8, is tonight in the Assembly Hall. Gor
don Davis, director of dramatics, asks
that everyone in the list below be there
promptly at 7 o'clock.
Expressing great satisfaction at the
number of people who have tried out
during the past two days, Davis announ
ces that he has found a wealth of ma
terial for all three production to be pre
sented this summer.
Still Chances for Many
A number of people, both men and
women, that he has not been able to use
in this first play, Davis has in mind for
parts in the other two plays, "Loyalties,'
by John Galsworthy, and"The Angel in
the House," by Eden Philpotts.
"Craig's Wife" is a stirring drama cen
tered about the selfishness and narrowness
of a woman who has no love but that of
herself and her scrupulously-kept home,
over which she reigns with a well-nigh
fanatical devotion. Making of each room
and each ornament a god, she worships
these things to the exclusion of all else,
even her husband.
One statement she makes during the
course of the play, gives away her entire
scheme to those who are observant. She
says,"A woman may lose everything,
even her husband, but if she manages
properly she can always have her home."
"Safety" is the one word which most
characteristically describes what Mrs.
Craig desires.
Mr. Craig, being totally in love with
his wife, sees none of this.
