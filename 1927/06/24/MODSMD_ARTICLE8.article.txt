# POSTAL MEN TO SOON INSTITUTE CAMPUS CARRIER SERVICE
## Stanford University Given As Advisable Mail Address 
### 
Postal authorities announce that carrier
service will be instituted as soon as the
proper equipment arrives.
Although the carrier route has not yet
been definitely outlined, it will probably
include all but the Hill and the dormi
tories. This delivery service will include
all classes of mail.
Under the present crowded condition,
with much of the mail going through the
General Delivery, postal authorities stress
the necessity of having mail addressed
properly to students of the University.
Mail should be addressed to Stanford
University, California. This address will
avoid delay and confusion.
Many students fail to receive mail
promptly because it is addressed to the
Palo Alto office. To eliminate the delay
it is urged that students see to it that
their mail is addressed to the local office,
which is a independent branch of the city
office.
