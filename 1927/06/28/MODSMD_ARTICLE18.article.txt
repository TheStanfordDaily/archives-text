# New Courses in Coaching Method Announced Here
## 
### 
Men contemplating entering the pro
fession of physical instruction or ath
letic 'coaching will receive an entirely
different type of education than here
tofore, according to an announcement
made by Dr. Thomas A. Storey, direc
tor of the Encina Gymnasium. Courses
in the method and technique of Ap
plied Physical Education and Hygiene
will be inaugurated this coming fall
quarter.
Courses will be given during next
year in each of the four main branches
of sport, under the direction of the
varsity coaches, and their staff of as
sistants. Football, baseball, track and
field, and basketball will each be han
dled in this manner. Dr. Storey will
exercise a general supervision over
the work that is done.
Wide Range of Courses
The work in each course will be di
vided into both elementary and ad
vanced. In material, the courses will
cover a wide range. First will be con
sidered the history of the particular
sport, and its growth in the colleges
and schools of the United States. Then
stress will be placed on the regula
tions of the game itself, and the stand
ard of sportsmanship which they re
quire. Finally, close study will be made
of conditioning methods, of the danger
of overemphasis, physical defects, and
immaturity.
These courses are especially calcu
lated to prepare teachers for service
in secondary schools, junior colleges,
and universities. They will involve not
only classroom lectures and chart
work, but actual field, court, and floor
demonstrations as well.
There has been a great need for the
development of such study in the field
of athletic coaching. In the past, sec
ondary school coaches have been sent
out merely equipped with a knowledge
of their particular sport, or sports, but
with little information as to the back
ground of the game, or as to the finer
points of training and physical and
mental fitness, except what they could
pick up for themselves on the side.
Checks Fitness of Men
Under such a system as this pro
posed, some check can be made upon
the fitness of various men as future
athletic coaches.
Dr. Storey, who is in complete
charge of the work, has had consider
able experience along these lines.
After graduating from Stanford in
1596, he assumed the position of Di
rector of Physical Education here.
After several years, he left to become
head of the Physical Education De
partment at the College of the City of
New York, where he has remained for
the past 20 years. Dr. Storey returned
to Stanford last year to resume his
duties here, upon the resignation of
Dr. Barrows.

sport, and its growth in the colleges
and schools of the United States. Then
stress will be placed on the regula
tions of the game itself, and the stand
ard of sportsmanship which they re
quire. Finally, close study will be made
of conditioning methods, of the danger
of overemphasis, physical defects, and
immaturity.
These courses are especially calcu
lated to prepare teachers for service
in secondary schools, junior colleges,
and universities. They will involve not
only classroom lectures and chart
work, but actual field, court, and floor
demonstrations as well.
There has been a great need for the
development of such study in the field
of athletic coaching. In the past, sec
ondary school coaches have been sent
out merely equipped with a knowledge
of their particular sport, or sports, but
with little information as to the back
ground of the game, or as to the finer
points of training and physical and
mental fitness, except what they could
pick up for themselves on the side.
Checks Fitness of Men
Under such a system as this pro
posed, some check can be made upon
the fitness of various men as future
athletic coaches.
Dr. Storey, who is in complete
charge of the work, has had consider
able experience along these lines.
After graduating from Stanford in
1596, he assumed the position of Di
rector of Physical Education here.
After several years, he left to become
head of the Physical Education De
partment at the College of the City of
New York, where he has remained for
the past 20 years. Dr. Storey returned
to Stanford last year to resume his
duties here, upon the resignation of
Dr. Barrows.
Men contemplating entering the pro
fession of physical instruction or ath
letic 'coaching will receive an entirely
different type of education than here
tofore, according to an announcement
made by Dr. Thomas A. Storey, direc
tor of the Encina Gymnasium. Courses
in the method and technique of Ap
plied Physical Education and Hygiene
will be inaugurated this coming fall
quarter.
Courses will be given during next
year in each of the four main branches
of sport, under the direction of the
varsity coaches, and their staff of as
sistants. Football, baseball, track and
field, and basketball will each be han
dled in this manner. Dr. Storey will
exercise a general supervision over
the work that is done.
Wide Range of Courses
The work in each course will be di
vided into both elementary and ad
vanced. In material, the courses will
cover a wide range. First will be con
sidered the history of the particular
sport, and its growth in the colleges
and schools of the United States. Then
stress will be placed on the regula
tions of the game itself, and the stand
ard of sportsmanship which they re
quire. Finally, close study will be made
