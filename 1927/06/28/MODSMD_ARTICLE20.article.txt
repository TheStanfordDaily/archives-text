# ROBLE JOLLY-UP IS INITIAL DANCE FOR QUARTER PROGRAM
## More Than 200 Present for Evening of Dancing, Cards 
### 
More than two hundred students at
tended the Roble Hall "jolly-up" Satur
day night. There was an overabun
dance of men, and many "cut in" in
the usual stag fashion. This was a
logical step in increasing the interest
of both men and women and helped
the making of acquaintances in "rapid
fire" fashion.
Dancing and cards were the two
main diversions of the evening. About
twelve tables for bridge were in con
santa use in the north end of the lobby
and the entire anteroom adjoining.
George Tackabury and his orchestra
furnished the dance music and, from
the general appearance of a constantly
crowded dance floor, it was greatly
appreciated. The music stopped at 12
o'clock.
The music stopped at 12 o'clock,
much to the disappointment of those
present.
Roble's next social event will be a
tea to be given this afternoon be
tween four and five-thirty for all who
wish to attend. Invitations for the tea
have been sent to visiting members of
the faculty. These events are only the
beginning of several which Roble Hall
is planning on giving through the
summer.
