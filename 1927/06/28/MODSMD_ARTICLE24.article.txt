# REGISTRAR'S OFFICE ASKS FOR REPORT ON CHANGE OF ADDRESS
## 
### 
Whenever a student changes his ad
dress, the Registrar's office urges that
it be informed of the alteration in resi
dence as soon as possible.
Frequently new students live at cer
tain places temporarily at the begin
ning of the quarter. Later, when they
take up their permanent quarters else
where, the Registrar's office is not
aware of it unless specifically notified.
There is a great deal of unnecessary
delay in forwarding letters to students
as a result of this condition.
