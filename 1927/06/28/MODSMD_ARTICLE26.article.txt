"Shall we intelligently try to control the future by preparation, study,
and the development of a desire for sympathetic co-operationasked
President W ilbur in his address to the graduating class; and lie answers
his own question affirmatively with a definite gesture —his projected trip
to Honolulu to attend the Institute of Pacific Relations to be held begin
ning July 15.
Among the delegates to this convention are included many learned
thinkers, men who have achieved the reputation of giving practical
decisions to difficult problems. College presidents, military men whose
opinions are recognized as authoritative, and experts in many lines from
all the nations bordering on the Pacific will make up the deliberating
body at this Institute. They are not aiming at any specific results, but
rather at the generalized goal of improving the mutual understanding of
the nations whose interests are bound up in the future policy on the
Pacific.
The recognition of the value of trained opinion is tin indication that
the University is beginning to gain a position as arbiter of the policy of
nations. In this conference will be heard the carefully weighed judgment
of men whose profession it is to think from the point of view of ethics,
practicability, and world-mindedness, rather than through the narrow
perspective of one nation's development^
The question of the Pacific will be considered by those from the
various nations who can see the people of these nations as men like
themselves, each interested in the furtherance of a policy that will benefit
the most of them, and militate against no one of them.
The universities which make the initial move to participate in formu
lating world policies will establish an enviable record for worthwhile
achievement. They will also take a lcflig stride in the direction of demon
stration to the matter-of-fact public that the theories of university trained
minds, so long held up to ridicule as Utopian dreams, can be applied
practically to solve most effectively the problems of present-day inter
national relations.
Stanford, to be represented at this Institute of Pacific Relations by
President Wilbur as chairman, whose opinions on the matter of Pacific
relations have already been made public, and by Professor Mears, who
will present to the Institute a stduy of the Oriental residents along the
Pacific Coast, takes a place as one of these pioneering universities. With
a Palo Alto man, J. Merle Davis, as organizer and director of the Insti
tute itself, the eyes of the Pacific nations are turned upon this university
in expectation of some signal contribution to the discussion, when these
men meet next month in an attempt by scholarly contact to solve some
of the phases of the intricate problems of immigration, trade, terri
torialitv, and even social relations.

opinions are recognized as authoritative, and experts in many lines from
all the nations bordering on the Pacific will make up the deliberating
body at this Institute. They are not aiming at any specific results, but
rather at the generalized goal of improving the mutual understanding of
the nations whose interests are bound up in the future policy on the
Pacific.
The recognition of the value of trained opinion is tin indication that
the University is beginning to gain a position as arbiter of the policy of
nations. In this conference will be heard the carefully weighed judgment
of men whose profession it is to think from the point of view of ethics,
practicability, and world-mindedness, rather than through the narrow
perspective of one nation's development^
The question of the Pacific will be considered by those from the
various nations who can see the people of these nations as men like
themselves, each interested in the furtherance of a policy that will benefit
the most of them, and militate against no one of them.
The universities which make the initial move to participate in formu
lating world policies will establish an enviable record for worthwhile
achievement. They will also take a lcflig stride in the direction of demon
stration to the matter-of-fact public that the theories of university trained
minds, so long held up to ridicule as Utopian dreams, can be applied
practically to solve most effectively the problems of present-day inter
national relations.
Stanford, to be represented at this Institute of Pacific Relations by
President Wilbur as chairman, whose opinions on the matter of Pacific
relations have already been made public, and by Professor Mears, who
will present to the Institute a stduy of the Oriental residents along the
Pacific Coast, takes a place as one of these pioneering universities. With
a Palo Alto man, J. Merle Davis, as organizer and director of the Insti
tute itself, the eyes of the Pacific nations are turned upon this university
in expectation of some signal contribution to the discussion, when these
men meet next month in an attempt by scholarly contact to solve some
of the phases of the intricate problems of immigration, trade, terri
torialitv, and even social relations.
"Shall we intelligently try to control the future by preparation, study,
and the development of a desire for sympathetic co-operationasked
President W ilbur in his address to the graduating class; and lie answers
his own question affirmatively with a definite gesture —his projected trip
to Honolulu to attend the Institute of Pacific Relations to be held begin
ning July 15.
Among the delegates to this convention are included many learned
thinkers, men who have achieved the reputation of giving practical
decisions to difficult problems. College presidents, military men whose
opinions are recognized as authoritative, and experts in many lines from
all the nations bordering on the Pacific will make up the deliberating
body at this Institute. They are not aiming at any specific results, but
rather at the generalized goal of improving the mutual understanding of
