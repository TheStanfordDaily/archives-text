# Equipping the Coach

The announcement that Stanford is about to install courses which
will deal with applied physical education and hygiene is a very gratifying
one. Dr. Storey, in inaugurating this work, is beginning something which
will doubtless have far-reaching results.
The idea behind the creation of such courses is that many of the
men now engaged in athletics here go out into high schools and colleges
as physical instructors, or as athletic coaches. If they can be equipped
with the scientific side of the sports which they will attempt to teach, so
much the better.
It is of interest to note that emphasis will not alone be put on the
history and rules of the so-called major sports, but that time will be
devoted as well to such subjects as sportsmanship, the danger of over
emphasis of athletics, and the hazard of immaturity.
Athletics, in this country, is a great institution. Strenuous physical
exercise has developed our citizens as the citizens of no other nation have
ever been developed, with the exception of the ancient Greeks. It is wise,
then, that the men who are to direct this work should be well equipped
with not only the fundamentals of their profession, but with a knowledge
of the higher purposes of competitive athletics. After all, it must be
remembered that competitive games not only train the body, but are a
powerful means of disciplining the mind as well.
Thus, it is wise that coaches be able to give their charges food for the
mind as well as exercise for the body. Lessons of this sort can well be
learned in the classroom, but they are especially apt to be gathered on
ihe athletic field, when in actual competition. And lessons learned on the
field are much more likely to stick than those learned elsewhere.
