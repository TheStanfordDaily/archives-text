# BURNS ATTACKS U.S. MATERIALISM SUNDAY IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
"National emphasis today is not
qualitative but quantitative," said the
Rev. Charles W. Burns, bishop of the
Methodist Episcopal Church of Cali
fornia, in his sermon at the Memorial
Church last Sunday. "We think in
terms of bigness," he continued, "but
are fairly illiterate in things of the
spirit. Our emphasis is on things rath
er than on thoughts. We have con
sidered God from the viewpoint of
thing-mindedness and we put a price
on devotion."
The Bishop stated that materialism
comes to its most vulgar point in the
remark made when a devout woma?
anointed Jesus with a jar of valuable
oil.
That phrase of Judas,' "it might
have been sold," has been the classical
remark of materialism in all ages, he
gaid.
