# DR. ACKERMAN WILL LECTURE TOMORROW ON TAPESTRY WORK
## 
### 
Dr. Phyllis Ackerman, in a lecture
tomorrow afternoon on "Life in the
Fifteenth Century as Illustrated in
Tapestry," will contribute not only to
the field of the art student, but to that
of the student of hitsory.
Although Dr. Ackerman has lectured
in many American art museums and
has published several catalogues of
tapestry collections in addition to a
book on "Wallpaper, Its History, De
sign, and Use," her interests have ex
ceeded the field of the art critic. Her
undergraduate work ut the University
of California was in law, and during
the war, after receiving her Ph.D., she
served as secretary to the third as
sistant Secretary of War.
In 1923-24 she was associate director
of the California Art Museum in San
Francisco. Bringing to her work as a
lecturer the benefit of broad experi
ence and interest, she possesses rare
equipment for interpretation in a little
known department of art. Her lecture
at Stanford will be concerned mainly
with the historical features of tapes
tries, illustrated by slides.
The lecture, which is open to the
public!, will take place at 4:15 in the
Little Theatre.
