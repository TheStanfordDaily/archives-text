# STANFORD STUDENTS TAKE CONTROL OF SAN CARLOS PAPER
## 
### 
Two Stanford students, H. B. Butler
and Hubert D. Swim, have leased the
San Carlos Enquirer for one year with
the option of buying the paper at the
end of this period.
Both Butler and Swim have had ex
perience in journalism. Butler worked
on The Stanford Daily and Swim was
editor of a city paper in Idaho. Butler
is registered for the summer quarter.
Swim expects to return in the fall.
The Enquirer is the only newspaper
carrying legal advertising in the San
Carlos district. Its district includes,
Belmont, Devonshire, San Carlos, and
the new Port San Francisco district.
It is estimated that twelve million
dollars will be spent in the develop
ment of this new harbor. Butler and
Swim expect this improvement to
bring new advertising and subscribers
to the paper.
