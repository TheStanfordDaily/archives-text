# MEN OF WIMBLEDON

### FEG MURRAY 
Although it 110 longer carries the
title of "championship of the world,"
the annual Wimbledon tournament
still is the last word in tennis compe
tition, and many an old-timer in "deah
old Lunnon" will be heard this week
speaking of the days of the Renshaws
and the Dohertys, and comparing the
play of S. W. Gore, the first champion,
with that of Jean Borotra, the present
title-holder.
The year 1880 was the advent of the

first of the great names of Wimbledon. 1
Then the Renshaw twins won the first j
of their seven doubles championships, J
and, a year later, William Renshaw ;
captured the first of his six successive I
singles titles. H. F. Lawford, inventor j
of the "Lawford Stroke," won the j
"All comers" singles in 1884-1887 in- j
elusive, but could not crash through
into the championship until the latter
year, when W. Renshaw did not de
fend his title.

! Tlije Dohertys flashed across the i
| Wimbledon horizon first in 1895, and !
! "Big and Little Do," by their grace j
; and skill, as well as their modesty
! and good sportsmanship, quite won the j
| hearts of the public. The Doherty
j epoch began two years later, and the
brothers had virtually an uninter-
I rupted reign in both the singles and
J doubles championships from 1897 to
: 1906 inclusive. Only in 1901 and 1906
l did they fail to annex both titles. The 1

great left-hander, Norman Brookes,
won his first championship in 1907,
and his compatriot, Tony Wilding,
reigned from 1910 to 1913.
Since the war, during which play
was suspended, the winners have been
Gerald Patterson, the giant Australian,
Bill Tilden (twice), Patterson again,
Billy Johnston, Borotra, LaCoste, and
then Borotra.
