# REGISTRATION HITS 1325 MARK AS MANY STILL ARRIVE DAILY
## Figures Continue to Remain In Excess of Totals Last Year 
### 
Registration for the summer quarter
has now reached a total of 1325, of
which number 1190 have completed
all of the requirements necessary to
matriculation for the present quarter.
On the corresponding day last year,
the total was 1147, while those who
had finished all requirements for ad
mission were 1052. Students continue
to arrive each day.
According to the Registrar's office,
there appears to be a greater number
of lower-division men entering for the
summer than was the case last year.
These students will attempt to make
good scholarship ratings and thus se
cure more favorable consideration
when regular registration for the suc
ceeding three quarters takes place.
As is usual during the summer, the
School of Education appears to have
the largest enrollment. Since many
secondary school teachers are regis
tered for advanced work in education,
the graduate department is receiving
a large number of summer quarter
students.
The results of last week's College
Aptitude test have not yet been com
piled. When this is done, the status
of those students who have not yet
finished all the details of registration
will be determined.
