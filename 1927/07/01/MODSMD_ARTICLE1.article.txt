# WILBUR TO SPEAK FOR AMERICA AT HONOLULU MEET
## To Present United States Views to Institute of Pacific Relations HAS BEEN A LEADER President Has Been Active In International Effort For Understanding 
### 
President Wilbur, who will leave to
morrow for Honolulu, will not only
preside as chairman over the second
session of the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions, which will he held there July
15-29, but he will also be called on
to make the presentation of the ideas
of the American group at the Institute,
as lie did at the first session in 1925.
President A. Lawrence Lowell of
Harvard University was to have been
the spokesman of the Americans in
this formulation of national views at
the opening of the conference, but lie
will be unable to leave Massachusetts
at this time on account of his partici
pation in the effort to prevent the exe
cution of Sacco and Vanzetti. In this
emergency Dr. Wilbur was selected to
take up once more the somewhat deli
•eate task of laying before the members
of the Institute at an early session
the attitude of the United tSates to
ward various questions that are be
fore the meeting for discussion. Repre
sentatives of the other nations repre
sented will make similar statements
on behalf of their own peoples.
Wilbur Has Been Leader
President Wilbur has taken a lead
ing part in the Institute ever since
the time when, outgrowing its first
I conception, it as sunned its present
! scope and character.
The [nstitute of Pacific Relations is
j a wholly unofficial, self-directing or
ganization of representatives of the
i nations that surround the Pacific
j basin, with the purpose of creating an
i informed opinion in these nations re
j garding their common problems, in
| order that this sound opinion may be
! come the basis of intelligent action to
! promote co-operation and minimize
| friction and misunderstandings.
In its present form the Institute is
the result of a course of development
and evolution from a much less com
prehensive proposal, that was first
broached as long ago as 1919. Origi
nally, the idea was a project of the
Y.M.C.A. to hold a conference in Hono
lulu to deal with the work and prob
lems of that organization among the
Pacific nations.
Broadens Its Scope
As plans were considered, the scope
and character of the prospective meet
ing were broadened. After many meet
ings, the project by 1923 had assumed j
the proportions of a conference to be i
held under the auspices of the !
Y.M.C.A., but concerned with a wide
range of Pacific problems, endeavor
ing to find solutions in which the j
Christian spirit should prevail.
Americans Prepare Plan
Finally, as interest in the possibili- j
ties of such an international forum
spread, the plan became that which 1
was put into operation—an Institute
of Pacific relations as a self-governing
and self-directing body concerned with
promoting the best relations between
the Pacific peoples to avoid misunder- 1
standings and conflicts and promote
friendship and co-operation. The i
Y.M.C.A. magnanimously withdrew as I
a directing organization in order to !
aid the new purpose.
Early in 1925 the plan had become 1
so well matured that a group of inter- j
ested Americans, of which Dr. Wilbur i
was one, called a meeting in New I
York City of forty-one men particular- \
ly acquainted with international and j
inter-racial attairs, to consider this |
proposed institute, its purpose, scope I
and method, and the nature of Ameri-1
can participation in it. This meeting j
was held on Washington's Birthday,
and, with Dr. Wilbur presiding, after a '
long and thorough discussion, en- j
dorsed the institute, making a number
of recommendations as to the charac- i
ter of the discussions in the institute
and suggesting the possibility of mak
ing the institute a permanent body.
Later the American group organized,
with an executive committee, of which
Dr. Wilbur was made chairman, and :
an advisory council, of which lie was j
a member.
Wilbur Gives American View
When the Institute met in Honolulu, j
President Wilbur was elected its chair-'
man and chairman of the executive i
committee which was formed with an
international membership. He had, i
therefore, not only to make the open- j
ing statement as a representative of :
the United States, along with spokes
men of the other nations, each pre

: senting the attitude of his own people,
I but to act as presiding officer of the
institute in its general meetings. This
year he will be under the same duties.
| The institute last year was wholly
successful, and laid the basis for fur
ther consideration of questions pre
sented in addresses and discussed in
j round tables during the two weeks of
the conference. Among the matters
i that received particular attention were
the effects of the industrialization of
the Far East, immigration and the
treatment of resident aliens in the dif
ferent countries, and various agencies
for bringing about international un
\ derstanding.
Stanford Men Are Members
Professor Payson J. Treat and Pro
: fessor Yamato Ichihashi of Stanford
were members of the American group
1 at the meeting two years ago. Profes
sor Treat addressed the institute sev
| eral times. This year Dr. Carl L. Als- j
' berg of the Food Research Institute j
and Professor Eliot G. Mears of the 1
j Graduate School of Business will be !
members. Dr. Mears has prepared a |
comprehensive report based on a sur- 1
[ vey of the situation of Orientals in
the Pacific Coast states, at the re
quest of the American group. This re
port, comprising nearly 550 pages, lias
just been completed by the University
Press, and copies will be placed in the
hands of the members of the institute.
Two other reports on the same gen
eral subject have been prepared. Dr.
G. G. Wilson, professor of internation
al law at Harvard, has compiled a re
port on the immigration laws of all
the countries of the Pacific, and Pro
fessor R. D. McKenzie of the Univer
sity of Washington has formulated the
results of a study of the actual opera
tion of American immigration laws as
they affect Chinese and Japanese.
Dr. Alsberg and Dr. Mears will sail
next week, President Wilbur leaving
early in order to be on hand for ar
ranging preliminaries to the institute
meeting. He will be accompanied by
Mrs. Wilbur and their youngest son.
