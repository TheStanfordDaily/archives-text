# Tuesday Last Day for Changing Study Lists
## 
### 
Tuesday, July 5, is the last day for
registration for this quarter. It is also
the last day for changing study lists
without a petition and the payment of
a fine.
When an additional course is taken
by a student after July fifth, he will
lie compelled to pay two dollars. A like
charge will be made for each course
dropped after that date.
The Registrar's office explains that
students must pay four dollars in
order to substitute a new course for
one which they already had on their
study list before July fifth.
