# PLAY COACHING CLASS PRESENTS PROGRAMS IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
English 118a, under the guidance of
Mrs. Oliver Kisich, who is director for
the Pendragon Players of Palo Alto,
gave its second presentation of plays
in the Little Theatre on Wednesday,
June 29. "Enter the Hero," by Heil
bron, and an episode from "Caesar
and Cleopatra," by Shaw, were given.
Direction of Plays Emphasized
Although this class produces plays
from time to time, their attention is
turned principally to the direction and
reading of plays, rather than to the
acting. This phase of the work is em
phasized because about ninety per cent
of the members of the class are Eng
lish teachers enrolled here for the
summer, who direct plays presented
in high schools.
Of the two plays given Wednesday,
the episode from "Caesar and Cleo
patra" was by far the better. Miss Ade
laide Mack very successfully por
trayed the part of the young queen.
She handled her voice well, and her
mannerisms and appearance were sin
cere and in keeping with the charac
ter which she obviously understood.
George Bruntz took the part of Julius
Caesar. Though no attempts were
made at realistic settings, the Sphinx
was artfully outlined beneath a green
drape; and a full moon and many
stars were suggested on the curtains.
In "Enter the Hero," Miss Monica
Latores, who took the part of the
small-town girl, showed possibilities
of being a very clever amateur act
ress. Miss Betty Chase and Miss Car
rol Lasater, who portrayed the part
of mother and sister, handled their
lines competently, and William Finck
was good as the young, innocent vic
tim.
Several Plays to Come
On July fi, the members of this
class will present "Finders Keepers"
by Hilby, a one-act play that has
proved to be very popular in amateur
dramatics. Also, on that day, there
will be given a scene from George
Bernard Shaw's "Saint Joan." Later,
on July 11, "When the Moon Falls,"
a play by Webster Street, a Stanford
j student, will be presented. "Near." by
Aase, will be staged on the same day.
These plays will all be given in the
Little Theatre at 2 o'clock on the dates
announced.

turned principally to the direction and
reading of plays, rather than to the
acting. This phase of the work is em
phasized because about ninety per cent
of the members of the class are Eng
lish teachers enrolled here for the
summer, who direct plays presented
in high schools.
Of the two plays given Wednesday,
the episode from "Caesar and Cleo
patra" was by far the better. Miss Ade
laide Mack very successfully por
trayed the part of the young queen.
She handled her voice well, and her
mannerisms and appearance were sin
cere and in keeping with the charac
ter which she obviously understood.
George Bruntz took the part of Julius
Caesar. Though no attempts were
made at realistic settings, the Sphinx
was artfully outlined beneath a green
drape; and a full moon and many
stars were suggested on the curtains.
In "Enter the Hero," Miss Monica
Latores, who took the part of the
small-town girl, showed possibilities
of being a very clever amateur act
ress. Miss Betty Chase and Miss Car
rol Lasater, who portrayed the part
of mother and sister, handled their
lines competently, and William Finck
was good as the young, innocent vic
tim.
Several Plays to Come
On July fi, the members of this
class will present "Finders Keepers"
by Hilby, a one-act play that has
proved to be very popular in amateur
dramatics. Also, on that day, there
will be given a scene from George
Bernard Shaw's "Saint Joan." Later,
on July 11, "When the Moon Falls,"
a play by Webster Street, a Stanford
j student, will be presented. "Near." by
Aase, will be staged on the same day.
These plays will all be given in the
Little Theatre at 2 o'clock on the dates
announced.
