j should bring their own boards and men
if possible. All spectators are welcome, i
Five years ago Smith played here, j

never lost a match, though they have
played telegraph games with the best j
teams in Chicago and other centers in
all parts of the country, he says.
During his vacations for a number :
of years Smith has enjoyed himself j
by playing matches in various parts !
of the state, with the result that he
has instigated the formation of a num
ber of thriving clubs in various towns
and cities. He is staying in Palo Alto ;
j for two or three weeks and will be
j glad to meet any local chess players ,
I at the Community House.
