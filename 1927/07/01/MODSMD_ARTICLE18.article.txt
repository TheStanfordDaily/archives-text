# NEW INGENUE DOES BRILLIANT WORK IN "CRAIG'S WIFE"
## Wins Role of Marion Young, Forced by Illness to Leave Stanford PLAY WELL ORGANIZED Free From Stilted Tricks, Composition Wins Critics' Praise 
### 
Barbara Lansburgh, who was last
night chosen to take the part of Ethel,
the ingenue in "Craig's Wife," has taken
over her work in brilliant style. She was
selected last night from a group of
women who tried out for the part.
Miss Lansburgh will make her first
appearance 011 the Stanford stage in this
play, having attended Mills College pre
vious to her matriculation at Stanford
this quarter. She has an amateur back
ground of considerable experience, how
ever, and a natural adaptation that tits
her well in the part of the sincere young
fiancee.
The change in the part of Ethel be
came necessary after it was learned that
the illness of Marian Young, who origi
nally had the part, has made it necessary
for her to discontinue her work at Stan
ford this quarter.
Leaves Out Tricks
Vaudcvillian fripperies and adornments,
which are so often the cause of criticism
in many of the modern plays, bless
"Craig's Wife," George Kelly's Pulitzer
Prize play, being presented a week from
today in the Assembly Hall, by their
conspicuous absence.
Kelly has been guilty of using this
artificial fretwork in some of his earlier
plays, such as "The Torchbearers" and
"The Show-off." Despite this fact both
of these shows were tremendous suc
cesses. He has, however, in "Craig's
Wife," made a conscious effort to free
himself from these stilted tricks, and
has developed a play which has won not
only the Pulitzer Prize, but also the
practically unanimous acclaim of New
York critics.
When the play was presented in Minne
apolis this spring by the New York com
pany, critics there claimed it was the best
production that had been seen in the
Middle West in years.
First Production on Coast
Since "Craig's Wife" has not yet been
played in this region of the coast, it will
be of interest not only to those who are
always interested in the shows presented
by Gordon Davis, but also to those do
siring to see this decidedly modern and
much-praised play. The Dramatic, Coun
cil procured the first rights of the play
for this section.
Miss Anna May Price, who is to take
over Gordon Davis' work next year, dur
ing his absence, has been continuing work
with the play while Davis has been at
the Drama League convention in Tacoma.
Davis will take over the rehearsals again
Monday and put the final touches on the
play.
Mis' Price, as well as being an able
technician, is a most inspired interpreter
of the ' author's ideas.
for the play will remain on sale
at the Old Union throughout the coming
week. a;t prices of 75 cents and $1.
