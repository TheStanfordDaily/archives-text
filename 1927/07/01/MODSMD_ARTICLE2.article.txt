# RAISING FUND TO HONOR FAIRCLOUGH ON HIS RETIREMENT
## 
### 
As a testimonial to Professor Henry
Rushton Fairclough of the Department
of Classical Literature, who becomes
emeritus at the end of tlie present aca
demic year, a number of his former stu
dents have started a fund to provide an
annual award bearing his name.
The movement was begun recently on
the campus and the sum so far raised,
without any campaign, is about $400. It
is the intention of those who have con
tributed this amount to establish with it
a "Fairclough Prize" for work in the
classics each year, unless the final amount
raised provides an income that will main
tain a scholarship or fellowship.
The collection of money has been in
the hands of Hazel Dorothy Hansen, a
graduate student in the department and
assistant in Greek, who has been ap
pointed to the Alice Freeman Palmer
fellowship of the American Association
of College Women and will carry on
work in the American School at Athens.
Professor A. T. Murray of the depart
ment will receive contributions to the
fund after she leaves the campus.
