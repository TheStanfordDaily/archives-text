### 
The position of President Wilbur as chairman of the Institute of
Pacific Relations is peculiarly appropriate, ilis training as educator and
physician fits him for the task. The business of the Institute is the
education of the nations bordering" the Pacific in the nature of their
common problems and in right ways to meet them; the members of the
Institute are like physicians in consultation to detect the causes of
possible disaster to these nations and to discover and prescribe preventa
tives. \
