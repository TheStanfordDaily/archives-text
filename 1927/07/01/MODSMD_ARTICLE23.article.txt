# Materialism and Idealism
## 
### 
Attacks are being made weekly by many spiritually minded men upon
what they term the "gross materialism of the American nation." For
example, take the case oflhe last Memorial Church speaker. Bishop
Burns, head of the Methodist Episcopal Church in California, cautioned
the students of the dangers of materialism, saying, in part: "We think in
terms of bigness, but are fairly illiterate in things of the spirit. Our
emphasis is on things rather than on thoughts.''
Bishop Burns, in his attack, made the serious tactical error of bringing
charges too comprehensive to be substantiated. It is apparent that
manv things which may be "grossly materialistic" in their use, or effect,
have had their conception in the purest range of imagination and
idealization. And even things which are purely material may have effects
which are diametrically opposite. The loaves of bread in the Xew Testa
ment story were purely objective, yet even the bishop cannot deny that
their ultimate effect was spiritual and ideal.
