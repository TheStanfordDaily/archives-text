# Non-Scouting Agreements
## 
### 
It is of interest to note that after what Princeton has termed the
"success of the Jones-Roper non-scouting agreement of last fall," it has
decided to make similar agreements with the other colleges upon its foot
ball schedule for the coming season. Of the six colleges approached, four.
Amherst, Lehigh, Washington and Lee, and William and Alary, have
accepted and agreed that they will make use of 110 pre-game information
concerning the Tiger eleven, in return for like "courtesy." Nothing has
been heard as yet from Ohio State, while Cornell wishes to hold the
matter in "abeyance."
The necessity of such agreements is extremely doubtful. '1 here is 110
question that it is undesirable for a head coach to leave his own team
during a game, in order to scout the next-week opponents. We recall
vividly the 0-0 tie which the California "Wonder Team" played with
Nevada during the absence of Coach Smith. But then, that is a risk
which a coach should decide for himself.
The real difficulty about the whole proceeding, however, seems to
lie in the fact that it is but another rule. It is a matter of experience that
whenever any such arbitrary rule is put through, others and still others
must follow in order to make it effective. And often, in the end, the
whole thing tumbles.
There is no surer way to create unfavorable criticism of college and
amateur athletics than to hedge them around with a lot of such rules
and regulations. But desirability aside, that coaches either would, or
could, live up to such a regulation as the abolition of scouting seems
very doubtful.
