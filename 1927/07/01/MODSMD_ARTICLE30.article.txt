# REGISTRAR CALLS ATTENTION TO LIMIT IN UNITS FOR CREDIT
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office calls atten
tion to the University regulation limit
ing undergraduate students to a maxi
mum of 18 units of credit for the
quarter's work, and of nine units for
the first half. A number of cards have
been filed with courses amounting to
more than this number of hours. ..Stu
dents may take these courses but, ex
cept for special exceptions which are
provided for, they will not be given
credit for more than the maximum.
Students are required to take at
least 13 hours for the full quarter or
seven for the first term, except by
petition.
For Lower Division students regis
tering at Stanford for the first time
the maximum of units for credit is
lower. Such students must register for
at least 13 hours for the quarter or
seven for the first term, and they will
not be given University credit for
more than 16 units for a quarter's
work or eight for the first half.
The same restrictions as for new
Lower Division students apply to all

students who have failures, conditions,
or withdrawals from class without
authorization on their previous Stan
ford records.
The Registrar's office finds some

confusion regarding the number of
hours for which some students who
intend to remain for only the first term
are enrolled. In some courses arranged
for the full-term students have been

permitted to take only the first half
but have not made the unit arrange
ments clear on their cards.
