## Hoffman, Forster, Krenz Among' Stars Who Will Compete 
### 
Twelve Stanford track athletes will
compete this afternoon in the annual
national A.A.U. track and field cham
pionships, at Lincoln, Nebraska. The
meet will continue for three days, with
final events in the senior meet being 1
run next Monday.
Hoffman Heads Group
Prominent on the Olympic Club
team are four Cardinal weight men.
These are )< j d by Clifford "Biff" Hoff
man, Pacific Coast Intercollegiate shot
and discus champion, and 1.C.4-A. dis
cus champion. Hoffman, who is steady
around 49 feet and 150 feet in the shot
and discus, respectively, is a likely
double winner. Following him closely
will be A1 Forster, who is consistent
ai better than 48 feet in the shot.
Herb Fleisli hacker, former interschol
astic champion, and Eric Krenz, should
also come in for some points in the
weights. Krenz was the particularly
bright star of last year's freshman
championship track team. He is good
for 145 feet in the discus.
Ross Nichols, Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate high hurdle champion, and
Hugo "Swede" Leistner, will be up
against a great field in the hurdles.
Leistner, probably the greatest com
petitive hurdler ever developed on the
Pacific Coast and holder of numerous
records, is good for 14.7 in the high
sticks when he is right, and should
have a fine chance to win this event.
Bob King Enters
Eob King, high jumper, is back in
shape again, and should have little
trouble in winning Iris event. He is
the finest high-jumper the Coast has
produced in years, and has cleared
better than 6 feet 6 inches several
times this year. If he is feeling good,
he may break the world's record.
Another Cardinal star competing for
the Club team will be Emerson Spen
cer, in the quarter mile. At present he
is national junior 440-yard low hurdle
champion, but will probably devote
himself to the quarter mile run this
year.
Kim Dyer, who is capable of better
than 24 feet in the broad jump, and
Ward Edmonds, now consistent at 13
feet 6 inches in the pole vault, are
the other Stanford athletes on the
Olympic Club team. Dyer should be
good for at least a third or fourth,
while Edmonds is picked to finish sec
ond to Barnes, the Olympic Games
pole vault champion.
Under Hollywood Colors
Two Stanford track stars are also
competing for the Hollywood Athletic
Club. Chuck Harlow, former 1.C.4-A.
champion in the javelin, should show
well. He is almost always good for
close to 200 feet' with the spear, which
should get him a first or second. Sid
ney Meeks, also competing for the
Southerners, has done about 24 feet.
3 inches in the broad jump, and may
do better any time.
All of the men mentioned, except
Krenz, who was a freshman this year,
Leistner, who is no longer eligible,
and Harlow, who was declared ineligi
ble during the dual meet season, aided
Stanford in winning the 1.C.4-A. cham
pionship this year. All of them at
tended the University during the past
year.
