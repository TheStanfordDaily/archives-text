# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, ’16 
A golf satistician, searching for M's,
need only take his spoon and dip into
a water hazard of alphabet soup to
find plenty of champions and near
champions splashing around. The thir
teenth letter is the last initial of many
a great exponent of the Scotch pas
time, beginning with Tom Morris,
Senior, who won the British open
championship in 1861, '64, and '67,
down to young Roland Mackenzie, who
was a member of the United States
Walker Cup team in 1925 at the tender
age of nineteen.
Where Tom Morris, Sr., left off, his
son began, and his father's title was
won by him in 1868, '69, '70, and '72.
One R. Martin copped in 1876 and '85,
and Armand Massy, a Frenchman, in
vaded England and won the British
open crown in 1907, and tied Harry
Vardon in 1911, but lost on the replay.
Massy won the open championship of
his own country four different times.
In our own open championship,
Freddie McLeod triumphed after a
play-off in 1908, and tied for second
thirteen years later. Tommy McNa
mara was runner-up in 1909, *12, and
'15, and then a native American, J. J.
McDermott, won twice in succession
in 1911 and 1912, after being second
in 1910. The last "M" to break through
in this tournament was Willie Mac
farlane, who won only after a tie and

; a double play-off with Bobby Jones in
1925.
| One of the favorites to win the pres
ent United States open tournament,
i now under way at Oakmont, is Wil
liam Mehlhorn, sometimes called the
"Wild Bill of the Pampas." This bow
j legged, blond buccaneer is one of the
j most famous of all professionals, and
{has yet to win his first major cham-
I pionship. Abe Mitchell is in a like fix,
though Abe, before he turned pro, was
; runner-up in the British amateur tour
! nament. Bob McDonald, the Chicago
pro, might crash through any year,
: too. There seems to be plenty of these
| "Mc" and "Mac' 1 golfers!
Max Marston, of Philadelphia, won
i the United States amateur crown from
I Jess Sweetser at Flossmoor in 1923,
; and another "M," C. B. Mac Donald,
| won the very first Championship back
; in 1895. British amateurs who have
| worn the title in their own land are
L. Balfour Melville, in 1895, and Rob
ert Maxwell, in 1909. Not forgetting
\ the ladies, there are Pauline Mack ay,
i United States champion in 1905, and
Ada McKenzie, Canadian title-holder
i last year.
Other M's of note are Jimmy and
! Stewart Maiden, Johnny McHugh,
| Ernest and Hutt Marlin, C. A.and
j W. A. Murray, Lionel Munn, Jack Mor
ris, Charles Mayo, Leslie Melville, and
Mrs. Allan Macbeth.
