## Conciliation of Germany and France Considered as Achieved RATES LOCARNO HIGH Mentions 1926 as Watershed Between European Peace And War 
### 
By bringing about the conciliation
of France and Germany without alien
ating Poland, the League of Nations
started a new epoch of diplomacy in
1926 that will have far-reaching ef
fects, Professor Charles K. Webster,
Wilson professor of International Poli
tics of the University of Wales, said
in a lecture at the Little Theatre Tues
day night.
"Lord Acton said in the closing years
of the Nineteenth Century that the
towers of Strassburg still dominated
Europe. Today this is no longer true,
and this is because of the action of the
League of Nations as incorporated in
the Locarno Treaty," the speaker said.
New Confidence Given
Among the things which have re
sulted from the Locarno treaty he
mentioned the following:
In the first place he said that Ger
many and France were reconciled be
yond the letter of the treaty, with a
consequent restoration of confidence
of far-reaching effect.
Further, as a result of this recon
ciliation. there has grown up a feeling
of continental unity throughout all
Western Europe. He said he has talked
with men of importance in 14 coun
tries I hat he has visited recently and
that they all feel the nations of Europe
are drawn together by common inter
ests to a degree never before known.
That there was a certain amount of
danger in this, he said. If continents,
were to act as national units in diplo
macy, there would be a chance that
disagreements between continental
groups might cause a war on a greater
scale than ever before. He believed
that the spirit of the League of Na
tions and the power of the members
of the British commonwealth of na
tions with strong members in each of
the five continents would prevent this.
Council Again Strong
Up until two years ago the Assem
bly of the League, contrary to the in
tentions of its founders, was getting
too much power. By international
diplomacy it was able to exert a great
influence 011 the course of interna
tional affairs. But the Locarno Confer
ence brought about a reverse.
Devoting « great deal of his lecture
to the Locarno Conference and its ef
fect on the League, Professor Webster
stated that 1926, the date of the
Locarno treaty, "was a watershed be
tween peace and war." This treaty ac
complished two great things. First it
removed for the first time since 1871,
the cause for the disputes between
France and Germany, when Germany
voluntarily agreed to give up forever
all claims to Alsace and Lorraine. In
the second place it brought about the
admittance of Germany into the
League.
War Makes Decisions
Summing up the value of the League
the speaker stated that it has taught
us a great deal about international
policies. In regard to its ability to end
war he stated that the League is a
step in the right direction. To prevent
war you must have something to take
its place. "War makes great deci
sions," therefore you must substitute
something for war to make decisions.
The World Court fills this need. It
has the machinery, and in due time,
will accomplish much toward doing
away with war.

yond the letter of the treaty, with a
consequent restoration of confidence
of far-reaching effect.
Further, as a result of this recon
ciliation. there has grown up a feeling
of continental unity throughout all
Western Europe. He said he has talked
with men of importance in 14 coun
tries I hat he has visited recently and
that they all feel the nations of Europe
are drawn together by common inter
ests to a degree never before known.
That there was a certain amount of
danger in this, he said. If continents,
were to act as national units in diplo
macy, there would be a chance that
disagreements between continental
groups might cause a war on a greater
scale than ever before. He believed
that the spirit of the League of Na
tions and the power of the members
of the British commonwealth of na
tions with strong members in each of
the five continents would prevent this.
Council Again Strong
Up until two years ago the Assem
bly of the League, contrary to the in
tentions of its founders, was getting
too much power. By international
diplomacy it was able to exert a great
influence 011 the course of interna
tional affairs. But the Locarno Confer
ence brought about a reverse.
Devoting « great deal of his lecture
to the Locarno Conference and its ef
fect on the League, Professor Webster
stated that 1926, the date of the
Locarno treaty, "was a watershed be
tween peace and war." This treaty ac
complished two great things. First it
removed for the first time since 1871,
the cause for the disputes between
France and Germany, when Germany
voluntarily agreed to give up forever
all claims to Alsace and Lorraine. In
the second place it brought about the
admittance of Germany into the
League.
War Makes Decisions
Summing up the value of the League
the speaker stated that it has taught
us a great deal about international
policies. In regard to its ability to end
war he stated that the League is a
step in the right direction. To prevent
war you must have something to take
its place. "War makes great deci
sions," therefore you must substitute
something for war to make decisions.
The World Court fills this need. It
has the machinery, and in due time,
will accomplish much toward doing
away with war.
By bringing about the conciliation
of France and Germany without alien
ating Poland, the League of Nations
started a new epoch of diplomacy in
1926 that will have far-reaching ef
fects, Professor Charles K. Webster,
Wilson professor of International Poli
tics of the University of Wales, said
in a lecture at the Little Theatre Tues
day night.
"Lord Acton said in the closing years
of the Nineteenth Century that the
towers of Strassburg still dominated
Europe. Today this is no longer true,
and this is because of the action of the
League of Nations as incorporated in
the Locarno Treaty," the speaker said.
New Confidence Given
Among the things which have re
sulted from the Locarno treaty he
mentioned the following:
In the first place he said that Ger
many and France were reconciled be
yond the letter of the treaty, with a
consequent restoration of confidence
of far-reaching effect.
