# CAST WORKS FOR THREE SOLID DAYS ON "CRAIG'S WIFE"
## Whip Production Into Form For Presentation on Friday Night PLAY BECOMES STORMY Sweeps From Light Comedy To Heavy Dramatic Thunder 
### 
Members of the cast of "Craig's
Wife" celebrated Independence Day
by concluding their third successive
day of rehearsing. All day Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday they worked on
the play which will be presented Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall under
the direction of Gordon Davis. Much
progress was made in whipping the
production into shape.
The more work the cast puts on the
play the more they are pleased with
it. Although there is plenty of dra
matic thunder and emotional storm in
the marital struggle portrayed,
"Craig's Wife" is convincing, those in
the cast believe.
Not Like "The Show-Off"
It is a far cry from Ceorge Kelly's
other most known successes, "The
Torch-Bearers" and"The Show-Off,"
which were spicy comedies, to "Craig's
Wife," which can only be termed a
comedy in that its wind-up has the
complete sympathy of the onlookers,
and in the two characters of Mrs. Har
old, the Irish housekeeper, and Maizie,
the maid.
Those who appreciate only come
dies find themselves converted to the
more serious portrayal of life as given
