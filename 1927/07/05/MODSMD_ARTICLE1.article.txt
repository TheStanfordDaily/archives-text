# CAST WORKS FOR THREE SOLID DAYS ON "CRAIG'S WIFE"
## Whip Production Into Form For Presentation on Friday Night PLAY BECOMES STORMY Sweeps From Light Comedy To Heavy Dramatic Thunder 
### 
Members of the cast of "Craig's
Wife" celebrated Independence Day
by concluding their third successive
day of rehearsing. All day Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday they worked on
the play which will be presented Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall under
the direction of Gordon Davis. Much
progress was made in whipping the
production into shape.
The more work the cast puts on the
play the more they are pleased with
it. Although there is plenty of dra
matic thunder and emotional storm in
the marital struggle portrayed,
"Craig's Wife" is convincing, those in
the cast believe.
Not Like "The Show-Off"
It is a far cry from Ceorge Kelly's
other most known successes, "The
Torch-Bearers" and"The Show-Off,"
which were spicy comedies, to "Craig's
Wife," which can only be termed a
comedy in that its wind-up has the
complete sympathy of the onlookers,
and in the two characters of Mrs. Har
old, the Irish housekeeper, and Maizie,
the maid.
Those who appreciate only come
dies find themselves converted to the
more serious portrayal of life as given
in this play, because of the sweeping
emotional structure which moves with
an intensity that holds all listeners
to a breathless attention. Everyone
finds in it something to intimate to
himself that he hangs 011 every line
to see if the stage character reacts
in the same manner he himself has
to a similar situation.
Husband and Wife in Contest
This trueness of understanding,
shown in the carefully worked-out
husband-wife duel, evolving as it does
from a fretful undercurrent to a rag
ing torrent, is perhaps the best part
of the play, members of the cast feel.
Admonitions not to smoke in the
parlor, not to sit 011 such-and-such a
chair, not to cross the kitchen floor
in muddy shoes, have been car
ried to the point of tyranny in "Craig's
Wife." Mrs. Craig idolizes every piece
of furniture in her house. The house
and its furnishings are her gods. At

this point the once humorously ac
cepted nagging becomes tragic. Light
ning ceases and the thunder and storm
break in.
In bringing home his one big theme,
Kelly lets no minor incidents deter
or swerve him. Where many authors
become sidetracked in interesting by

plays, and forget their main plots,
Kelly has picked up his incidents and
dropped them only as they are neces
sary to the general scheme of his one
central idea. As a result of this the
play sweeps through with an intensity
of dramatic structure that is sustained
to the end.
