# Sneak Thieves Pay Week-End Visit to Campus
## 
### 
Several small robberies on the cam-1
pus have been reported during the last j
few days.
For the third time within a month, j
the Phi Sigma Kappa house was .
broken into and robbed Sunday night, 1
while those at home were asleep. In- !
stead of going through the house after ;
personal property and money, the j
thief contented himself with the rug |
which he found in -the den. Shortly ;
before the end of spring quarter, a :
coat of an evening suit was stolen, and
during spring vacation, a banjo dis
appeared.
A room in Encina Hall was robbed
of personal clothing consisting of two
pairs of white knickers, a pair of trou-1
sers, a fountain pen, and a gladstone !
suitcase Saturday night. The same j
night several articles of clothing, a j
wrist-watch, and a valise were taken
from two rooms at the Union.
A Roble resident also reports the '
theft of a small sum of money.
