Professor Espinosa has been experi
menting in objective tests in Spanish
for the past three years. Last year
tests in grammar, reading, and vocabu
lary were given to 3000 students, di
vided between high schools and uni
versities .
The object of these tests was to
discover the norm of Spanish students
in general, and also to find out wheth
er the assumption that two years of
high school Spanish are equal to a
year's Spanish in college is correct.
In his lectures Professor Espinosa
will discuss his experiments, the pur
pose of the various tests given, and
what was discovered about the rela
tionship of high school and college
Spanish.
